All right, the time has come for me to choose an algorithm for my
time/speed system.  After doing some research it seems I have a few
options, so I'm going to field some ideas of what I want my time
system to support.

* Of course, I want some things to act faster than others.  That is,
some things should receive a greater or lesser amount of turns
depending on their speed.  A thing's speed can also change over time
(spells of hast/slowing).

* A thing's reflexes (number of turns per iteration) must be
independant of metabolic or natural processes such as health
regeneration, spell effect duration, and monster respawn rate.  How
fast or regular these things occur should also be tuneable though.
I want some creatures to regenerate health faster than others for
example.

* Forms of pillar dancing are a feature.  I want to emphasize the
tactics of my game, so the way that turns are scheduled for
everything should be fairly transparent.  I support tactics like
hack-and-back and strategic pausing, and I actually want certain
types of AI to be able to do these things.

For this reason I've been intrigued by the system described by Jeff
Lait for his games (Google Groups link: http://groups.google.com/
group/rec.games.roguelike.development/msg/edcfbfa20b04d40b; you
may have to copy and past the link).  The only thing that bothers me
is that I may want more than four discretations of creature speeds.

* Actions that take different amounts of time (costs different amount
of future turns I may say) may be interesting, but I'm not sure if I
need it or not.  I was originally thinking that every single action,
from item pickup to attacking, would take exactly one turn.  I've
read a suggestion somewhere though that suggested that attacking
could take twice as much &quot;time&quot; as moving.  This may lead to some
interesting tactics; if creature A attacks creature B, at least
creature A would have its turns delayed enough for creature B to add
some distance between them.  The point is, if I do have different
actions taking different amounts of time, how long each action takes
should also be fairly transparent and have effects obvious to the
player.  As an aside, I assume all actions are uninterruptable, and
that an action is performed immediately after the creature chooses
one.

* When scheduling the creatures in a new level, I want one creature to
act first no matter what its speed is (this is more than likely to
be the player).  I don't care how other creatures are scheduled, as
long as I have control over which creature actually makes the first
move.

* I don't want to just schedule creature player movement.  I also want
to schedule other events in the world like timed doors or
earthquakes.

I just wonder what kind of algorithm or data structure is suitable for
this.  I've tried a priority queue, but the turn order may be too
obsfucated for the player if I don't balance the creature speeds
right.  I also can't find a way to make a certain creature to act
first without messing up the turn order.  As I've said, Jeff Lait's
system seems nice and simple, but might be a bit inflexible for
monster variation (I doubt this was Jeff's concern, but it is for me.
:/ ).

I have a couple of lists that each hold a queue of actors in them and every
turn I go through the list and decide what to do with them. Then when they
are finished with their action/s I push them back into time at whatever
queue depending on how long they took to do their action. Sometimes the
actions take less time than it takes to get into the next queue, so the
actors get pushed to the back of the current queue. If you always wanted the
player to go first (it could only happen in whatever queue the player was in
though) then just push him to the front of the list whenever he gets pushed
back. I use 10 different queues (probably don't even need that many) right
now and if I need something to take a long time then I keep the total # of
queues the actor has to go through and whenever it gets back into play and
it has not reached 0 yet, it gets pushed ahead the max (10) # of turns or
however many are left.
I control when the heartbeats fire off during the actor's turn (because I
plan on having a nice # of actors and my god actor is doing plenty already)
and if it's heart beats are controlled by a heart beat timer so if it's
heart beat is faster then it's turn takes then it beats twice or however
many # of times, and if it is slower, then it only beats after its heartbeat
counter has been reached. Any poisoning/dying/suffocation or whatever is
handled here as well.
I have an ethereal god actor (actor # -9) handle all world-wide effects,
things growing, or decaying, I have the factions/gangs as actors too (&lt; -10)
and handle some tactics, the player is # 0  and everything else (enemies,
friends, special doors (which could be left out of the time queues
completely until the player or an actor does something like knocks so it is
not clogging up the queue) altars etc. ) is considered an actor ( &gt; 0).
Everytime an entity has taken a turn, they turn the current actor number
to -1 and my game loop knows to get the next actor # and everytime there is
nobody else in the queue the current actor number is -5 and the game loop
increases the actual game time ( a fraction of a second to a couple of
seconds per turn depending on how detailed you want to be keeping time),
goes to the next queue and does whatever else happens when time increases.
The only downside was that at first I had to be careful about where/how I
pushed (or failed to push) an actor back into the time stream since they
could fall out or be replicated exponentially in the time stream.

The system I have is not very transparent as to which actor will go next
though.

Oh yeah :

An actor's turn is independent of the # of things you can actually do during
your turn - during your turn you have a # of reflex points that you can use
to strike, dodge, throw things, put something in your pocket etc.. so if you
use them all up  in that round, you can not dodge, block etc. - which makes
combat more interesting and strategic and means that you can not be
surrounded by 8 people and block everybody (unless your are really
fast/reflexive/skilled or maybe have some special multi-block/many-attackers
skill) and gives you the chance to go all out in your attacks thus leaving
yourself wide open (I just need to have some effective aggressive, normal,
guarded settings so there is not any more micromanagement then is wanted)

so in essence, if you have a low refelx, but a high speed, you would get
more turns and could theoretically run faster (since movement is handled
differently), but be able to do less things per turn, if you have a high
reflex, but a low speed, you could do a lot of things per turn, but not run
as fast and be longer in between restoring your reflexes

Movement is different, and you are usually only allowed to move once per
turn, but you could strike and then move if you are reflexive enough or move
and then be attacked and be able to block (since that is a passive action) a
couple times etc.

I'm not sure how you mean to handle actions in the above?

How do you signify you are done taking actions and wish the turn to
end?  Do you include an &quot;End Turn&quot; command (or &quot;End Actions&quot; or
&quot;Process Turn&quot; or whatever you want to call it.  Even &quot;Defend&quot; might
work.)?  If so, that could become annoying in a long game, even if
movement were counted as an automatic turn ender (as it seems to be
in the above description.)

Is defense automatic if you have the reflex points to spare, or is
the player queried for response to every incoming attack as long as
he has points remaining?  The latter adds the annoyance of even more
keypresses, while the player might not care 90% of the time.  On the
other hand, when the player is attacked by two or more creatures of
different deadliness, he very likely will want to make sure his
defensive actions are applied to the attacks of the deadliest
creature and not wasted on the weaker ones.

If defensive action is chosen by the player (rather than automatic),
then would there be multiple defensive options?  Dodge, block, parry,
or even riposte/counter?  Or what of an additional reflex points
versus effectiveness trade-off, so that you could choose to put
minimal effort into defending a single attack that you don't care
about, but could also put maximal effort (in the form of many points)
into defending a single attack that you fear greatly?

I think you want segmented movement.

Divide your &quot;round&quot; up into 12 &quot;segments.&quot;  Let each creature move on
particular segments corresponding to its speed.  Here's a sample speed
chart.

speed:  segments:
0       none (paralyzed)
1       6
2       5 10
3       2 6 9  (normal speed)
4       1 4 7 11
5       2 4 7 9 12
6       1 3 5 7 9 11

You can play the same kind of game with more segments, if you want:
sixty's a pretty good number too.

Now you just build an array for each segment of the monsters that
act on that segment.

If you want one particular actor to go first, you can just suppress
the moves of all the other actors who would go before them, and then
continue as normal.

Somewhere on the display, you give the round and segment number and
people who memorize the time chart (and you know they will) can
hack-and-back, etc.

My game uses action time.  For example, movement might cost 200
points, meaning that it will take 200 &quot;turns&quot; (I use the term loosely,
since very few things act every turn).  Creatures with higher speeds
would have lower numbers.  A bat might only have to wait 50 turns
before it can act again.

I'm not how I will work this in with hunger though.  Probably, for
every action waited, you'll gain hunger equal to (1000 / original
cost).  So if movement cost 200 points, you'd have 5 hunger after you
moved.  The bat, on the other hand, would have 80 in the same amount
of time (1000 / 50 = 20, 20 * 4 = 80).  This is representative of a
high metabolism, but it seems kind of skewed.  I'll work on it
eventually.

I agree with Jeff's argument that time should be transparent - there is
no need for priority queues etc.  Given this, a wide variety of options
are still available.

The simplest method is probably to give each monster a speed and a
balance of accrued time.  When the player moves or acts, the amount of
time he used is given to every monster.  Monsters that have enough time
to move or act then do so.

This is what I use in my own game Lair in which you (and monsters) can
both move and act in a single turn, and turns can take up to ten
seconds.  But it is equally adaptable to games in which you move one
square or hit a monster; you can seamlessly drop down to this mode in
Lair, although you won't be making the most of your tactical options if
you don't sometimes use/abuse the option of making moves that are up to
ten seconds long. [My rationale for this is that planning and quickly
executing a long move followed by an action *should* be more effective
than tippy-toeing forward in a cowardly fashion while the monsters
watch.  I'm not sure if most players really 'got' this concept,
though...]

If the player is hasted (say) just give the monsters less time per
player move.  Conversely, if a monster is fast, it needs less time per
move.

Pillar dancing etc. works fine, whether you are taking long or short
moves.

Anyway, the same system can work well for timing in a roguelike.  In my
game you can mouse over a monster to see how much time it has stored
and how fast it moves and acts, so you can actually determine from on-
screen information which monsters will move after your turn, and what
they will have time to do.

[Note: all monsters that will move and/or act on a given turn will do
so in the same order they were created.  Lovers of priority queues etc.
may see this as a significant wart.  I don't think it matters at all.
Maybe they have more initiative or something.  Anyway it would be
possible to randomise it.]

It is prerequisite for fairness.  Lovers of priority queues would be
wise to enforce this as a tie breaking rule.

If I'm fighting someone the same speed as me, I expect both of us to
alternate moves.  This allows tactical planning as I can determine if
it is safe to attack another round or if I need to escape/heal/etc.
If turn order is randomized every turn, I need to allow for the enemy
getting a double move, adding more static to the simulation and less
room for tactical planning.

This also potentially allows munchkinning the speed system, and can in

Turn order should not be completely random _every_ turn, either, as this
is simply the other extreme.  But it is wise to be careful to _not_ make
your game's speed system too set in stone, as otherwise speed becomes an
absolute imperative to obtain for the tactical power it offers.

A certain amount of randomness is ideal to prevent players from simply
saying &quot;This monster can do 1d6, I have 7HP, I'm guaranteed to get in
one shot and then I can step away and heal.&quot;

I haven't begun to implement a speed system yet, and I don't know how
most roguelikes do it. But a simple yet powerful way of doing that,
which I have used not in a roguelike but in an interactive fiction
system, is the following:

while(1)
{
for each ( creature c in your world )
{
c.timer--;
if ( c.timer == 0 )
{
execute stored action;
decide which action to do next;
set timer = number of time units required for the next action;
}
}

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
}
">

where the number of time units required for the next action can be
dependent on the action itself and on the creature's speed. For
example, putting on a plate mail can have a base cost of 400 time
units, but a character with speed 1.2 (i.e 1.2x normal speed) would do
it on 400/1.2 = 333 time units.

Managing interruptions (such as a monster attacking you while you are
reading a spellbok, and having to ask if you want to interrupt the
action) can be done via events that bypass the timer: for example, if
a creature is attacked while executing an action, give it the
opportunity to reset the timer at that moment if it wants to interrupt
that action to start a new one.

To me, the biggest problem with double turns is that there is no
in-between.  You either get the normal damage range from a monster,
or you get double damage.

It makes it more difficult to balance damages, as a creature meant
to be dangerous now may randomly become deadly.  Damage values in
games generally seem to be designed around the idea of a consistent
turn order.  The possibility of random double turn throws off that
balance.  A creature meant to be very dangerous randomly becomes
capable of insta-kills.  And though players likely don't care, it
also throws off the monster health and defenses, as players may also
benefit from a double turn.

Also, if you think about it, it doesn't really make sense when a
creature that might normally gets four attacks between your actions
will suddenly get eight attacks.  Five attacks, maybe.  Six would be
pushing into the boundaries of luck.  But eight?  Or random double
moves, where something that normally can only advance 10 feet (or
yards or whatever your scale of choice) surges to 20 foot, or
conversely gets tagged twice before it makes a 20 foot run and then
manages to stay 10 feet ahead of you for following turns.

The jump is just so big.  Variable speed systems have similar
issues, but at least can still be consistent in when the faster
creature gets a double (or triple or quadruple or whatever) move.

And it is really the double move that is the deadly one, as that
is the jump that gives the most gain.

That is where our design theory differs.  I consider that an
advantage, not a disadvantage.

I think we focus too much on individual combat.  Sure, a character who
gets an extra moves every three turns can time it to constantly hit an
opponent with no risk.  If combats were isolated arena fights, this
would be a problem.  But they are in dungeons.  Longer you take, more
likely someone else gets involved.  Or you get closer to Hungry.

Yeah I have a Pause which waits until the end of that queue and I have a
Wait which waits a certain amount of time. Right now I have the AI set up to
be in aggressive mode, normal mode or defensive mode when attacking and they
hold back a certain number of points to defend or counterattack when struck
or whatever depending on their current mode. I do not have everything set up
for the player, but I am going to allow them to pick a certain # of points
to reserve every round (like in x-com with reserve long range shot, and
whatever else they had) and they can pick things like reserve x # of blocks
(still, you would not be able to dovery many blocks unless you are extremely
fast or you don't do anything that round except for attempt to block) or
reserve 1 counter-strike or whatever. - if you have waited or paused then
the ai will take over if you have enough points left to counterstrike or
defend depending on how aggressive/defensive you are and whether or not you
are pausing.
I was worried about all the querying as well and I plan to handle most of it
automatically and with different kinds of settings.
Yes, I have all those different defense options in, your weapon gives you a
parry skill which is computed when you are being struck at (before the
dodging/blocking) (as blocking an armed attack with no weapon is a lot
harder) - blocking is a lot faster (less point requirment than dodging) so
that will be used most often, unless the person is acrobatic or it is a
missile weapon then it is better to dodge because blocking is penalized
(unless it is a shield (unless it is something much more powerful than a
shield could block)) - I didn't have any thoughts about being able to
fortify a block or something, but that is a good idea, maybe they could do
that if they are terrified of the attacker, or if this attacker is much more
powerful, but I did not want to have to micromanage everything so much as
having to choose how many points to save
I would not know how to check if a certain actor actually did have a chance
to strike before the player has a chance to go again without going through
each queue and even then I do not know when exactly the player is going to
be placed back into the time stream (actually, I am wrong - I have the next
time the the actor is going to move stored within the actor too, so I guess
I could check on that, and if it is within a certain amount of time withold
a block for that attacker)
But this leads me down to some different paths and things I can do - I
already have a list of current enemies and the current target, so I could
have the player (or AI more effectively) utilize this by having the current
target be the focus of his attacks and consequently gain a minor bonus to
blocking versus other attackers besides the current target, or maybe a minor
reduction in the points it takes to block - but there is no chance to
counter-strike (and then using the tactics combat skill be able to have more
than one focus or more of a bonus or something) - which could lead to
different tactics vs a very powerful and a couple weaker - just focus on the
powerful and do not attack - just counterstrike (though that could backfire
pretty easily) Ok! that is enough of this!

It was something I had thought of for a combat system I'd never
actually put into a game.  The idea was that there might be specific
attacks that you'd really want to go out of your way to avoid, even
if the extra effort put you at a disadvantage elsewhere.

With special effects on certain attacks, you may find the desire to
avoid those attacks is much greater than normal attacks.  Automation
may be possible, but is potentially flawed if vulnerability varies
from situation to situation.

You might wish to avoid the sting of a giant scorpion even if you
resist poison, but you may find yourself frantic to do so if you are
especially vulnerable.

If an enemy can grapple you to put you at a disadvantage, you may
wish to put more effort into dodging that grapple than into dodging
its strikes.

If an enemy can strike twice, and either attack can take more than
half your current life, you may wish to put maximum effort into
avoiding a single strike rather than trying to avoid both.  You
might increase the odds of getting hit once, but decrease the odds of
dying because you got hit twice.  (While if either attack can take
all your life, and you are fairly certain it will hit twice, you'd
want to spread your defense evenly.)

If you have hit locations for attacks, a player may wish to put
extra effort into guarding vulnerable areas even if it didn't
actually increase the odds of complete avoidance, but instead added
the chance that the attack may land elsewhere.  If you have no head
armor, you may be willing to take a hit on the chest or arms if it
spares the head.  With special effects on some attacks, this can
become even more something a player might want to decide on the
spot.

Note: The system I was working on didn't specifically use action
points.  Rather, it used a discouragement system, where culmulative
actions built culmulative penalties for all following actions.
Expending more than normal effort added more than normal to the
penalties.  The system would either still have a limit on the number
of actions (which could itself give more reason to put extra effort
into individual acts when you were sufficiently skilled,) or
penalties would remain active over multiple rounds until you had
spent effort to recover.

I remember an old pen-and-paper role-playing game called Trolls and
Tunnels (apparently X&amp;X naming wash fashionable back then). In that
game, the combat turn was not described as &quot;you swing your sword at
the monster and hit/miss&quot;, but instead &quot;you combat with the monster
for some time, dodging his blows and trying to hit it&quot;. There was a
formula for computing how much damage you did and a formula for how
much damage the monster(s) did, depending on your and the monster's
stats, and skills, and equipment (I think you just rolled a dice to
see how many blows hit the target).

It sounds much more plausible than &quot;now your turn sir, hit me&quot; kind
of system, and it also eliminates a lot of artifacts, like the fact
that attacker gets one attack less and the pillar dancing.

It probably is more plausible, but I think it would go against
immersion. You feel more identified with the character when you
control every move (well, at least I do). And, if I ran into a troll,
attacked, got ten hits from him in a single turn and died, I would

Most games in which 'long turns' are used allow only a single action by

It's okay for the player to get away with the odd double hit, but it's

Yes, it does -- if those attacks come in sequences. (Eastern martial arts:

Going from one sequence to two is reasonable.  And if the time system thinks a

sensible.

In nearly any Roguelike with multiple attacks, you don't really
control every move anyway.  If you get four attacks in a round, you
can't choose to attack twice and then back away or drink a healing
potion.  You either attack four times or don't attack at all.

If an enemy is faster than you or naturally gets more attacks than
you, then you don't get to move away in the middle of its barrage of
attacks.  You ride the whole thing out.

For games that don't have multiple attacks in a round, they may
still on some level count combat as an abstraction of a round's
worth of attempts and defenses, even if it boils down to a single
hit or miss.  (That was one of the abstractions in D&amp;D from what I
recall, that despite a single to-hit and specific dice amount, and
attack wasn't necesssarily a single attack but rather the results
gained over a period of time.)

As for getting hit ten times versus getting hit five and healing,
it would really depend on the time slice.  If something hits you
fast enough, you won't be able to stop to cast a healing spell.
If the time slice is small enough, something of similar speed and
nature isn't going to hit you that much before you can change
actions either.

Even if you use the kata explanation, in a real fight you can still
interrupt a fixed sequence in the middle as well as at its end point.

Heck, kata don't necessarily work for Roguelikes combat anyway.  In
Roguelike combat, each attack is almost always separate from its
surrounding attacks.  With a kata sequence, attacks are often more
interdependent.  As well, breaking a kata would prevent the rest of
the attacks from even happening.  That doesn't happen in Roguelike
combat, where everyone gets their full run of attacks.

As well, you get a timing issue that you can't explain away when
you have multiple opponents.  If in five seconds, you can land 4
attacks and your opponent can land 4 attacks, you could claim you
each control the fight for 2.5 seconds.  If you get a double turn,
then you just kept control longer.  But then what of when you have
three opponents, and 16 attacks happen in five seconds?  At some point
you have to acknowledge that things are overlapping and the game
is just using an abstraction, and not something that needs be fixed
in stone.

If you want to emulate this sort of combat, you might consider
something like what World of Warcraft uses for the Rogue class.
Various attacks add 'combo points' to individual enemies (up to a
maximum of five per creature), then a 'finishing move' burns the combo
points on that creature for extra damage or some other effect (a debuff
on the creature or a buff on the rogue).  The more points there were on
the creature, the better the effect.

[I think the combo points disappear after about 20 seconds, so you
can't exploit by putting points on several weak creatures then zapping
each for buffs.]

It was a design decision, in the combat they were trying to simulate
the attacks were supposed to take place almost simultaneously, with only
a split second separating them -- so, obviously they couldn't notice the
monster has fallen, not to mention interrupting their attacks which were
surely conducted with full force.

More importantly, it makes the game of properly assigning who attacks whom
much more interesting and having much greater impact on the actual combat:
should I spread my attacks, and risk that this already weakened monster
survives another round, or should I concentrate them and potentially lose
some of potential damage this turn?

the speed with which you can hit, as well as the accuracy of the hits and

because it allows the human DM to make the combat much more interesting,
coming up with imaginative descriptions of what happened. Typically, you
and DM would roll dice, then DM would describe part of the combat, then
he would tell you what to change on your character sheet.

Of course, in a roguelike game, you would probably replace the single
dice roll with a lot of calculations involbing all kinds of stats, skills
and equipment bonuses. Plus facing, body position, moon phase and morale,
if you wish.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I remember an old pen-and-paper role-playing game called Trolls and
&gt; Tunnels (apparently X&amp;X naming wash fashionable back then). In that
&gt; game, the combat turn was not described as &quot;you swing your sword at
&gt; the monster and hit/miss&quot;, but instead &quot;you combat with the monster
&gt; for some time, dodging his blows and trying to hit it&quot;. There was a
&gt; formula for computing how much damage you did and a formula for how
&gt; much damage the monster(s) did, depending on your and the monster's
&gt; stats, and skills, and equipment (I think you just rolled a dice to
&gt; see how many blows hit the target).

&gt; It sounds much more plausible than &quot;now your turn sir, hit me&quot; kind
&gt; of system, and it also eliminates a lot of artifacts, like the fact
&gt; that attacker gets one attack less and the pillar dancing.
">

I was originally incorporating some ideas like this into my time-system as
well - I really liked the idea of  a couple of different actions combined
into one abstracted little combat round that could be interrupted or maybe
joined by other people, and be an easy way to determine who is busy with
combat and removes  and other things like that but I had to remove it when I
changed how detailed each round is - I originally wanted each round to be
3-4 seconds or something like that, but I did not like the fact that
somebody could move around so much at once so I made the rounds much more
detailed . but I guess I could put it back in and just have the combat
extend over a certain amount of time

It is also seems like it would be a little bit more interesting (as long as
your combat is relatively interesting something that is usually very sorely
lacking in most games. I don't know if they are afraid to get graphic with a
couple of random messages or just lazy?) to see a couple of different blows
and counterblows/ back and forth each turn of combat. Or more dramatic: You
both come together hammering blows down on each other back and forth and
then spring back a step until you gain another opening. Plus, combat is
usually chaotic, and unless you are fighting against somebody who doesn't
know what they are doing you will usually have to adjust what you are doing
to compensate for what they are throwing at you and that reaction may make a
backhand swing very advantageous to the attacker or it might lead to a jab
being much more useful/able to be landed or you may want to get away but not
be able to at the moment because of all of the attacking coming at you
This could even be affected by the skill of the attacker vs the defeneder -
one character with lots of skill may cause the other character to have less
of a chance of an effective shot and more of a chance of a less effective
shot.

And if you are one of the simplifiers you could use these as the types of
damage -
-each attack does a certain damage:
1 for poke
3 for slash
7 for overhead chop

and if you wanted some basic aggressive-normal-defensive settings you could
adapt the above example but make overhead chop cause a penalty to defense
the next round or something and poke give a bonus.

or if you wanted a more hpless simplified system -
poke doesnt hurt too much but keeps the other person off guard or something
cut hurts a little and might slow you down but can not kill
slash hurts and will slow you down and might kill you
overhead chop hurts a lot and will injure your body and will probably kill
you

It depends on what you think you're representing. If those multiple
attacks are a series of rapid blows after maneuvering for an opening
that lets you land them, then you won't save enough time by having the
foe drop dead in the middle to be worth representing. If you assume each

You can do that with or without a kata system of attacks.  They
can be implemented through various methods as well.

You can make bonus attacks that activate if the initial attack
succeeds.  These may or may not burn an action, depending upon
preference.  (Examples: If a vampire lands a grab, then it
automatically bites to feed.  If an elephant succeeds with a
charge, then it automatically gets an attempt to trample.)

You can have certain attacks put the target into special states.
Attacks that follow take advantage of that state.  Stuns could be
handled this way, as well as knock-downs and even grapples.  The
attacks that follow may gain special bonuses or even be altered
depending upon the state of the target.  (Examples:  A giant snake
has a constrict attack that entangles the target, but also does
extra damage if the target is already entangled.  A vampire may be
able to bite under any circumstance, but gets a significant bonus
to both success chance and amount healed when trying to bite a
target that is immobilized in some way (and perhaps &quot;bite&quot; follows
&quot;claw with chance to grab&quot; in its attack sequence.)  An elephant
may be designed so that all its attacks switch to &quot;trample&quot; if the
target is already in a &quot;downed&quot; state.)

For the above, the duration of the states is again a designer
decision.  They could last until the player actively does something
to change his status, last for a duration of multiple turns, last
until the end of the attack round (works okay for some kata-style
sequences), or only last until the next attack (though the next
attack may be designed to re-apply the state, like a wrestler
continuing to keep a damaging hold.)

You could implement some effects as simply time-based penalties,
similar to the special states idea.  Stunning in *bands could be
considered this.  Or bleeding.  Various attacks may have the chance
to for a duration negatively affect the target in various ways.

You could of course flesh out a wrestling unarmed combat system
with various grappling dependent attacks.

If you wanted, you could take the kata idea and build a combat
system almost entirely around dependent attacks.

An idea would be a combat system designed around learning various
attack forms.  Formless combat would be limited to one or two attacks
per turn, but attack forms allow three to five attacks.  Forms would
be dependent upon weapons, as a sequence designed around a two-handed
sword probably wouldn't apply to an unarmed fighter, just as a
quarterstaff form wouldn't apply to someone wielding a dagger.  There
could be overlapping forms though, such as multiple unarmed strings,
or generic versus specific strings (like &quot;holding two weapons&quot;
versus &quot;holding a sword and dagger&quot;.)  If strings are designed so
that one is always better than another, then which form is used at
any moment can be entirely automated.  Otherwise, you may have a
partial automation where the player can turn forms on or off in a
menu, and combat chooses the most specific form that applies for
current equipment.  (For example: You turn off &quot;sword1&quot;, and leave
&quot;sword1&quot; and &quot;sharp object&quot; active.  If you wield a sword in combat,
you use the &quot;sword1&quot; string.  If you wield an axe, you use the more
generic &quot;sharp object&quot; string.  If you wield a hammer, you use no
string and only attack once.)

Another idea is to let the player not just pre-define his own
attack string (as allowed in Omega), but take it a step further by
defining an attack tree.  More complexity and control could be added
by increasing the freedom in choosing your success/fail conditions.
You would want a variety of dependent attacks for such a system, as
well as likely just various modifiers.  Depending on how many options
you give the player (in both actions and conditions,) you might see
some pretty interesting trees develop.

I don't see any point in &quot;getting graphic with a couple of random

chrome - unless it is both ignorable and obviously meaningless - *tends*
to degrade a roguelike's UI.

I've thought more about what I want in my speed system, and I think I
can sum it up like this: a creature's speed determines the number of
turns it receives in a round.

A &quot;turn&quot; is the opportunity a creature gets to actually do something,
such as attacking or moving.  To the player, this is when he's aloud
to make a keypress (except for interface tasks such as examining his
stats).

A &quot;round&quot; is all of the turns that all creatures make on the current
level for one iteration.  A creature's speed is the number of turns it
will get in a round.  For example, say there are three creatures:

Creature | Speed
------------------
A |     5
B |     5
C |     5

Rounds will consist of 15 turns, and each creature will receive five
turn per round, acting in this pattern:

A B C A B C A B C A B C A B C   A B C A B C A B C A B C A B C ...

Since their speeds are equal, the creature's turn proceed in a
classic I-move-You-move pattern.  This would have the same pattern if
all of the creatures' speeds were 1, though the round breakdown would
be three.  Note that the player doesn't actaully see the round.

Now suppose the creatures's speeds are unequal (I use smaller numbers
so that I won't have to type such long patterns):

Creature | Speed
------------------
A |     1
B |     2
C |     1

The round will have four turns in total; creature B will get two of
them.  To both creature A and C, B will look like it is getting double
turns (especially if A and C can't see each other).  Indeed, if it was
just A and B, truly consecutive turns would happen:

A B B   A B B ...

However, B does not necessarily need to have two consecutive turns.
Here are some possible patterns when all three creatures are in play:

A B C B  A B C B ... **
A B B C  A B B C ...
A C B B  A C B B ...
B A C B  B A C B ... *
B A C B  B A B C ... *

The 2nd last and last patterns marked with a '*' are patterns
generated by a priority queue and an Angband-style energy system,
respectivally.  I prefer the topmost pattern marked with a '**' since
B's turns are evenly distributed among the turns in a round and
because it sticks somewhat closely to the creature order.  The middle
two I simply made up.

As an aside, my priority queue and energy algorithms also show bugs
for certain situations.  If I have two creatures with speeds seven and
two, and I let them act for three rounds, the first creature takes
twenty turns (it sould have taken twenty one turns) and the second
creature takes seven turns (it should have taken six).

Another thing about these rounds is that it is important that their
turn pattern stays (surely the player should be able to figure out
what the pattern is).  What I'm not sure about is what happens when a
creature's speed changes.  However, I'm not *too* concerned about this
as long as the turn pattern is able to stabilize itself.

Indeed, the player may not have to tell what the actual turn pattern
is.  He may instead figure out how many turns certain creatures get
relative to his own turns.  It would be usefull for there to be a
query that asks &quot;When I act, how many times will this creature X act
until my next turn?&quot;

I have to say that I'm in the same camp.  If you think about many turn
based strategies and wargames, alot of your management involves
positioning your units to attack without leaving them open to enemy
attacks.  I remember from playing Fire Emblem for the Gameboy Advance
that alot of my strategy involved keeping my soldiers just out of
reach of the enemy (and the game had a handy interface for showing how
far the enemy can move next turn).

&gt; you take, more likely someone else gets involved.  Or you get closer

">

Hmm.  I am actually concerned about individual combat, since I want
boss monsters at some point.  However, this may be addressed by
providing more ways for a creature to put distance between itself and
an enemy.  I think I remember that in Ultima 1 or 2 if a monster on
the overworld gets next to you there is simply no way to shake it off
without attacking (and this was without a speed system) and it is
something I want to avoid or minimize.

One possible way could be to make attacks take more &quot;time&quot; than other
moves, something I got from a previous thread (Google Groups:
http://groups.google.com/group/rec.games.roguelike.development/
browse_thread/thread/aeb95a18edf0ad48/).  I imagine that even if a
creature gets an attack, this will slow the creature down enough for
the target to get away.  I'm not sure how different-speed actions
would work in my theoretical system above though.

Something else that could help would be to have automatic dodging
(where you move a space away) and maybe counter-attacks.  At least a
dodge that makes a creature back away from the attacker would put some
distance between them, while counter-attacks would give the attacker a
hard time.  I'm thinking along the lines of dodging in Dwarf Fortress
adventure mode, where every time you get attacked you had some chance
of dodging and counter-attacking (you're also able to set whether you
would dodge or stay still when attacked).  I'll probably put dodging
in anyway since I want a fluid combat system where creatures flit and
dance around each other instead of just bash into each other.

That could work.

Reading the aforementioned thread, there was a lot about attack modes.
I agreed with R.Dan Henry at the end who suggested the use of only two
modes; berserk and normal, or aggressive and defensive, whatever.  But
I would accept a special defensive mode if it did something different,
like giving you an extra move away when hit.

Something like:

Normal: default damage calculations

Berserk: do double melee damage, take double melee damage.

Defensive: unable to attack or cast aggressive spells; a melee hit has
a 50% chance of moving you one square away from the attacker.  Melee
damage reduced by 25%.

Well, after browsing through the barrage of underscores, I can see a few
problems with your approach.

* You insert a new item using an external library function. This is not only
useless to those using other languages (not a good quality for example code),
but you also lose fine control on where exactly the new item should be placed
in case it's priority is equal to some other priority. I'd argue it should be
placed _after_ older items who have the same priority, but there is no way to
tell from your code if bisect.insort actually does that (I bet it doesn't).

* The priorities go to infinity as the time progresses. In a real game you'll
need average speed at least 10, because speed 1 creature versus speed 2 creature
is just not fair. You can imagine after a while the numbers will be quite big
and everything would break or become dog slow (depends on the implementation.
For example there is a chance someone will implement your algorithm in C++,
using ints and there would be a dreaded overflow after about 3000 turns). There
is really no need to keep all these big numbers, because they're usually
contained in some small range between x and x+n, where n is the longest time an
action could take. Here is a (bad) description of a better algorithm:

http://groups.google.com/group/rec.games.roguelike.development/browse...

Also, there have to be some modifications if the time is 0 (action cancelled, or
the player does meta-action, like saving game), in which case the other monsters
who have zero priority shouldn't get the opportunity to hit you. But that's not
hard to implement.

OK, I've removed the dependancy on the bisect library.  It's probably
for the better, since I can now compair just the priorities instead of
the whole tuple which Python seems to do.

This ends up with a different turn order, and the only way to make it
consistent is to insert the things with their delays at the very
beginning.  This does cause me to loose control over who acts first
(which I complained about earlier).  For that I might do what someone
suggested earlier and just suppress turns at the beginning until I get
the creature I want.  That is, things are popped and pushed back into
the queue, but don't have their AI's run in the middle.

That would make my example on RogueBasin:

b a c b b a c b ...

... look more like this (assuming I want 'a' to go first):

a c b b a c b b ...

I'd have to do some tweaks for the main game clock though if I do
that though.

As an aside, the bisect.insort actually does insert after older items,
at least according to the official documentation at
http://docs.python.org/lib/module-bisect.html .
