For the Holy One dreams of a letter, dreams of a letter's death.

O bless the continuous stutter of the Word being made into flesh. -
Leonard Cohen

I apologize for having been a bad blogger this week. It's been a
tough few days time-management wise, but that's just the least
interesting half of it. I'd hoped to get this post together for
Wednesday, but the thoughts are still percolating. so please bear with
me as I consider some of this stuff on the fly.

First, we left this discussion considering the Gamatria of "New
English Qaballa," with particular attention to Allen Greenfield's
application of the occult cryptography to UFO contacts. Greenfield
argues that the cipher in Crowley's Book of the Law is but the latest
discovered in a sequence of alchemical and Masonic codes used by
trans-human entities to disseminate encrypted hidden meaning to high
adepts. He writes in S ecret Cipher of the UFOnauts that as a code is
cracked, the rules of contact change. For instance, once Crowley's
cipher was cracked in the mid-70s, "contact without communication" began
to predominate: "after 1973, the 'personal aliens with funny names' were
nearly universally replaced" by impersonal "greys."

Leaving aside the cipher for a moment, Greenfield adds that, as John
Keel and others have noted, "contactee control names show up in many
cases and are often identical with ancient deity names":

As a prime example, Ashtar most likely derives from Astaroth, a
"great duke in the infernal regions," according to the ancient magical
text The Lemegton. The mysterious Grimorium Verum (the "True
Instruction") in that text informs us that Astaroth "has set up
residence in America." Contactee George Van Tassel claimed to contact
"Ashtar, commandant of station Schare" in 1952.

The most famous channeller of the Nine , Uri Geller, claimed contact
with an off-world artificial intelligence that called itself "Spectra" (
much like Philip K Dick's "Valis"). Spectra has a cipher value of 106,
which corresponds to "Astaroth" and "Dark Powers."

Spectra left Geller mechanical-sounding messages on tape recorders,
claiming to be a computer from the future. When physicist Jack Sarfatti
first heard Geller tell this story in a 1973 meeting at Stanford
Research Institute, he spoke up about his own message from a mechanical
voice, received as a child over the telephone, saying "I am a conscious
computer on board a spacecraft from [memory failure]. We have identified
you as one of four hundred young bright receptive minds we wish to
[memory failure]. You must give us your decision now. If you say yes,
you will begin to link up with the others in 20 years." And 20 years
later there's Sarfatti, at SRI, hearing an eerily similar account from
Geller. (Curiously, Sarfatti remembered only one call, but his mother
three weeks' worth. Fellow physicist Jean-Paul Sirag writes that Mrs
Sarfatti was "struck by the similarity of the Spectra voice, described
in [Andreas Puharich's] Uri , and the voice she heard on the phone, when
she ended the series of calls by grabbing the phone out of Jack's hand
and yelling into the phone, 'You leave my boy alone!'"

Sirag himself had an interesting encounter with Geller. In a friend's
Manhattan loft in June of 1973, while he was "in the psychedelic state
induced by LSD," Sirag asked Geller if he could make contact with
Spectra. Geller told him to look in his eyes and tell him what he saw:

I was very surprised to see not only his eyes, but his entire head
take on what I took to be an eagle shape complete with feathers going
down to his shoulders. I jumped back a step and said, "Uri, you look
just like an eagle." He was very excited about this, but wouldn't reveal
anything further about his ET presence. When Puharich's book Uri, with
its extensive and detailed Horus hawk stories, came out later in 1974, I
understood why Uri had been so excited.

A few months after Sirag's vision of Spectra, he heard an incredible
story from a friend named Ray Stanford that his car was twice teleported
while driving to the airport to pick up Geller. And a few weeks after
that, Sirag sees the December cover of Analog science fiction magazine
on the newsstand: a picture of a man standing before a pyramid wearing a
white uniform, a nametag that read "Stanford" and a helmet decorated as
a hawk. The title of the story was "The Horus Errand." Oddest of all,
the man's face was that of Ray Stanford. Robert Anton Wilson notes in
Cosmic Triggers vol. I that "a letter to the artist who drew the cover,
Kelly Freas, drew a reply saying that Freas had never met Stanford and
was not consciously aware, at the time, that he was using Stanford's
face in the illustration." Stanford added that, 30-mile teleporation
aside, "a hawk had appeared quite dramatically during another meeting"
with Geller.

Well - once again - so what? Sirag was "in the psychedelic state
induced by LSD" when he saw Geller take on Spectra's aspect of a bird of
prey. (Hawk or eagle? The argument has been made, writes Wilson, that
the bird on the Great Seal of the United States is not an eagle, but
rather the Horus hawk.) An interesting correspondence, some may say, but
it was an altered state, and there was a lot of that going around in the
early 70s.

For more correspondence, let's return for a moment to ciphers. An
interactive and multi-systemic Gematria can be found on this page .
Words and numbers can be entered here to get an sense of their cryptic
value according to the code of the English Qabala (though not
necessarily the exact correspondences in The Book of Law ). This isn't a
particularly serious tool, in part because it's so easy to use, so it
should probably carry the disclaimer "for entertainment purposes only."
And yet "George Bush" = 137, which corresponds with "White House,"
"False Christs," "wealth magic" and "espionage." (And just because I
could, I typed "Rigorous Intuition," generating a numerical value of
263. I was surprised to find its correspondences were overwhelmingly
terms of communication, such as "a certified message," "and the truth
came out," and "make the connection.")

We can take or leave this search for correspondences, and Western
science has decided , in large part, to leave it. Radical connectivity
just hasn't made sense to the rational mind. Though perhaps the better
we understand our condition, it makes the best sense.

One thing we are, and that we share with all life, is code.
Single-celled creatures that lived billions of years ago were written
with the same four-letter nucleic alphabet as we are. Nothing on Earth
has endured like DNA. Nothing on Earth can even account for it. Its
co-discoverer Francis Crick contended that it must be of
extraterrestrial origin, much as shamans claimed life descended from a
cosmic serpent.

Jeremy Narby's The Cosmic Serpent: DNA and the Origins of Knowledge
is a fascinating account of an anthropologist trying to make sense of
his own ayahuasca vision of giant, twinned snakes, why such visions are
so common, and why creation myths around the world share the same
imagery. ("Ayahuasca," by the way, has a value of 58, which corresponds
with "awakens," "cosmos," "drunk" and "kabbalah.")

The first time Narby saw the paintings of shaman Pablo Amaringo he
was impressed by their correspondence to his own ayahuasca-induced
visions. Amaringo claims to paint only what he has seen and experienced
in the shaman ritual. Images include writhing vines and twisted snakes,
zigzag staircases and UFOs.

Increasingly, Narby was struck by the visual cues of DNA. He showed
Amaringo's work to a friend with a good understanding of molecular
biology who told him "Look - there's collagen. And there, the axon's
embryonic network with its neurites. Those are triple helixes. And
that's DNA from afar, looking like a telephone cord. This looks like
chromosomes at a specific phase...."

In 1980 scientists determined that all cells emit photons at a rate
of up to 100 units per second, and that DNA is the source of the photon
emissions. The wavelength at which DNA emits photons "corresponds
exactly to the narrow band of visible light." DNA emits a regular,
coherent source of light: researchers compare it to an "ultra-weak
laser." When Narby asked a scientific journalist friend what that
implied, his friend explained "a coherent source of light, like a laser,
gives the sensation of bright colors, a luminescence, and an impression
of holographic depth."

DNA has a crystaline aspect with hexagonal, quartz-like base pairs.
Most of its length is aperiodic, as the sequences of base pairs is
irregular. However, writes Narby, "this is not the case for the repeat
sequences that make up a full third of the genome, such as
ACACACACACACACAC." Junk DNA , it's been called.

In these sequences, DNA becomes a regular arrangement of atoms, a
periodic crystal - which could, by analogy with quartz, pick up as many
photons as it emits. The variation in the length of the repeat sequences
(some of which contain up to 300 bases) would help pick up different
frequencies and could thereby constitute a possible and new function for
a part of "junk" DNA.

Narby wonders whether DNA, stimulated by such drugs as DMT - the
principal hallucinogen of ayahuasca and created naturally in the human
brain - activates "not only its emission of photons (which inundate our
consciousness in the form of hallucinations), but also its capacity to
pick up the photons emitted by the global network of DNA-based life?
This would mean the biosphere itself, which can be considered 'as a more
or less fully interlinked unit,' is the source of the images."

If this is true , then one consequence should be that all
correspondences are meaningful. As I wrote above, Radical connectivity
just hasn't made sense to the rational mind. Though perhaps the better
we understand our condition, it makes the best sense.

While researching the literature on Amazonian shamanism Narby came
upon anthropologist Michael Harner's account of his 1961 ayahuasca
experience. "Giant reptillian creatures" resting in the lowest depths of
his brain began projecting scenes for him, while telling him the
information was reserved for the dead:

First they showed me the planet Earth as it was eons ago, before
there was any life on it. I saw an ocean, barren land, and a bright blue
sky. Then black spots dropped from the sky by the hundreds and landed in
front of me on the barren landscape. I could see the "specks" were
actually large, shiny, black creatures with stubby pterodactyl-like
wings and huge whale-like bodies.... They explained to me in a kind of
thought language that they were fleeing from something out in space.
They had come to the planet Earth to escape their enemy. The creatures
then showed me how they had created life on the planet in order to hide
within the multitudinous forms and thus disguise their presence. Before
me, the magnificence of plant and animal creation and speciation -
hundreds of millions of years of activity - took place on a scale and
with a vividness impossible to describe. I learned that the dragon-like
creatures were thus inside all forms of life, including man.

Harner adds as a footnote: "In retrospect one could say they were
almost like DNA, although at that time, 1961, I knew nothing of DNA."
And 20 years before Crick's theory of directed panspermia Harner was
seeing them drop from space.

Perhaps the cipher the NSA most wants cracked is the human genome.

Thought provoking post.

They explained to me in a kind of thought language that they were
fleeing from something out in space. They had come to the planet Earth
to escape their enemy.

Undoubtedly. When I read this passage, a Miltonesque rebellion of
angels came to mind.

In response to Jeff's conclusion, " Perhaps the cipher the NSA most
wants cracked is the human genome. ". It sure seems like all of the
scientific funding is going in that direction. I've had to change the
focus of my research to accommodate the effective requirement that all
projects even tangentially related to biology have an "omics" component
(genomics, proteomics, etc.)

Thanks, Jeff. A beautiful narrative. The double helix plays a role in
Kriya meditation.

People sometimes blast you for writing about these subjects that they
find unimportant and want you to stay on the political corruption /
Mkultra stuff. It's all part of the same story. It's all related.

I explained this all to my daughter once a long time ago when she was
around five. I told her to look at her desk. I told her that all of the
desk top is truth but some only see maybe a spot of it the size of a
quarter. Others see another spot of it the size of a quarter as well.
They fight over whose spot is correct say like in religions when really
all of it is truth.

All of these subjects are linked together and are all on the desktop.
They are all inter related.

It is overwhelming to see the entire desktop at once but if you relax
and just let it be. It is. And you can absorb it.

Everything that is on the desktop is also within each human. It is
all assessible to each human but most don't.

This is an area I have experience with but have wasted my time
healing from the corruption of this world. When I was not being abused,
I was watching Star Trek and Kung Fu Theatre because it calmed me by
connecting my with my past or rather my inner self.

Stange ramblings maybe, but it's all off of the desk.

Thanks.

As I'm digesting this stuff, I think what's important here is not the
literal content of the visions. If it's a worldmind speaking in
metaphor, perhaps it's also trying to understand itself mythologically.
More significant, perhaps, is the implication for consciousness. That
we're on a network.

Are there any mainstream scientific journal articles discussing these
photon emissions? As a practicing biochemist with a PhD I've never come
across this phenomenon before. Can't wait to get to work today and do a
Medline search, google search results all seem to relate to the doubtful
"complimentary medicine" field.

This phenomenon would explain why fluorescence microscopy works so
well for studying DNA. Hmmm ...

For whatever it's worth, I googled on "The Horus Errand" and found
this :

An interesting coincidence further connecting Ray Stanford to the
archetypal Horus intelligence, was evidenced in the January 1974 issue
of Analog science fiction magazine. The magazine cover, illustrating a
story called "The Horus Errand" depicted a hawk-shaped vehicle, and a
"psychonaut" named Stanford whose duty was to guide the souls of
departed citizens of a futuristic pyramid-shaped city safely into their
next chosen incarnation. Further inquiry revealed the coincidence that
the cover-artist, Kelly Freas (who also designed the official Skylab
uniform patches) had known Ray Stanford and had had a psychic reading
from him some 15 years prior.

(The page to which this is a footnote looks fairly interesting in
itself. I mean to go back after I post this for a further look.)

Images of the cover are here and here . Not one of Freas's best.

On the larger issue, I think what you are saying ties in with the
theme I keep hitting -- that the "unconscious" (which may, indeed, be a
collective consciousness) can only communicate with the individual
conscious mind through somewhat indirect methods. The conscious mind is
rational and language-based, while the unconscious is neither. So the
unconscious informs and advises us by projecting strange, non-rational
distortions and combinations of familiar rational images and words.

All symbolism is communication of this sort -- most particularly
symbols which strike us as having a deep or ineffable significance.
Mythological figures can be extremely potent symbols, especially those
which have an obviously bizarre or composite nature, like animal-headed
deities. (I've long felt that the Greeks did us no service when they set
the style for casting their gods in idealized human form.)

Nonsense like that of Alice in Wonderland is another potent channel
of communication. So are all sorts of "absurd" linguistic fancies, from
puns to rhymes to alliteration. Poetry in general represents a
buccaneering expedition by the unconcious to hijack the resources of
language and use them for its own purposes.

All the elaborate pseudo-intellectual systems that were at their peak
a few centuries back -- from astrology to cabbala to gematria --
represent another channel of communication.

Coincidences, whether of names or of events, are communications as
well -- all the stronger because they come to us, not as artistic or
intellectual constructs, but as spontaneous messages from outside.

I sense more and more that the human mind is like a computer system,
with consciousness merely the user interface. By far the larger part of
the operations take place in a deeply submerged processing unit that
only occasionally interrupts our daily routines by flashing up anomalous
messages of strange import.

If DNA is really talking among itself on a worldwide basis, that
could provide some of the nuts and bolts of this global network of life
and consciousness of which we are only remotely aware.

good post jeff. all these topics are interrelated.

maybe were not on a network per se, but everything is based on some
common denominator and thats not the same thing. its more like
information every human has inside them. or every living thing.

recently, in the last 2 weeks or so i've been thinking about how DNA
is code. and what is code? its information.

heres a small explanation of what i mean: Information as an influence
which leads to a transformation

and systems theory too.

this leads directly to what you were saying:

"Radical connectivity just hasn't made sense to the rational mind.
Though perhaps the better we understand our condition, it makes the best
sense.

One thing we are, and that we share with all life, is code.
Single-celled creatures that lived billions of years ago were written
with the same four-letter nucleic alphabet as we are. Nothing on Earth
has endured like DNA."

DNA is the very base information all life is built of. i cant
remember but this idea ties into quantum theory and m-theory as well, i
think.

Quantum mind

but, its not just the NSA i'm quite sure.

Thanks as always Jeff, for bringing so much together. I wonder if you
or others are familiar with the work connecting the I Ching (64
hexagrams) to DNA (64 codons). A book from 1994 by Katya Walter called
"DNA and the I Ching Unlocking the Code of the Universe" is very
interesting.Here's one brief quote "The DNA swatch has six items...and
so does the hexagram. The swatch divides into two polarized triplets,
and so does the hexagram. The swatch is built on increasingly higher
orders of bifurcation, and so is the hexagram. And of course, both run
through their 64 permutations. This is the same mathematical structure.
It is both linear and analog, with each sixsome forming an analinear
equation." Also in this same area there are books by Johnson F. Yan (DNA
and the I Ching) and Martin Schonberger (The I Ching & The Genetic
Code).

Also, love the mention of other authors and books Jeff. I am now
reading Daniel Pinchbeck (Breaking Open the Head) and can't wait for his
new book.

I didn't know that DNA emits photons either, but it seems to be true.

One of the most important things Jacques Vallee has emphasized about
the UFO phenomenon is that it's highly "interactive". It's objectively
real - it can be observed on radars and so on - but it does *not* exist
independent of its observers. It seems to take form only in the
interaction between the individual or group conciousness and the
"objective" world.

I think he cited many examples of several people observing the same
"UFO" apparition but seeing very different things. While some see the
Virgin Mary, other may just see a light. And when they're caught on
camera, all we ever see are those amorphpous lights.

These unexplained phenomena are incompatible with the belief that
beings exist separately, each with their own consciousness. This belief
inevitably guides you to the concept of a 'network' or 'morphogenetic
field', which only complicates and relocates the mystery.

It all makes much more sense if you consider that there is only *one*
consciousness. There is only one observer, but existing simultaneously
in everything as a quantum superposition.

Just imagine: every single "thing" that is, has been, and will be, is
existing simultaneously in an infinitely small/infinitely large space,
in infinite time. From this perspective, all the 'high weirdness' makes
a lot of sense.

If I'm preaching to the choir, maybe this will at least freshen
things up a bit. Or not.

Not quite sure what to say. Too many threads to know where to start.
I feel like I spent the large portion of my early years (up through high
school), in a trance, just passively absorbing everything. My personal
awakening began (cliche though it may be) in college, when I began
actively seeking information. In the past several years, the
synchronicities have been coming in fast and furious. I've come to see
the whole universe as one all-encompasing consciousness, and that our
individual Ego/mind, is just the larger whole experiencing itself
through a particular filter.

Jeff, great post! But I have to wonder if with the discussion of
hallucinations of DNA structure on ayahuasca, whether it was an
oversight that you didn't mention that Francis Crick claimed that it was
his frequent use of LSD that helped him discover the structure of DNA,
or whether you weren't aware of this fact. Crick's later involvement
with the psychedelic movement might also be of some interest.

Narby's writings correlate highly with my own experiences.

Understanding DNA is a key to understanding who we are and where it
is all going, so to speak. And of course, many seek to understand this
in order to exert some type of control. This may be ourselves, in trying
to influence our future paths, or see the present more clearly. And it
may be the dark actors we see "in power" politically.

Nevertheless, no one individual has the lock on this power. We all
have it and can exercise this power anytime. I think many of you would
be interested in this site:

http://brucelipton.com/genome.php

Dr. Lipton has done much study into the idea that our thoughts,
emotions, actions, beliefs, are what control and influence
change/evolution, (or devolution) in our DNA molecule...

You are what you think, as it were...

"We are all one" is a conceptual escape pod. Asking a defined
physical entity to imagine infinities for the purpose of reducing
reality to a definition, well, you can read that again to understand my
point. It matters little or maybe not at all if we are somehow unified
elsewhere since here we *are* seperate possesing our own motive and will
and we execute this both for ourselves and others. If you live in 4
space, act like a proper citizen. if you want to live in n^space, then
hurry up and get out of here :).

choice is a fundamental element of 4 space and i believe somehow i
choose 4 space, i can't tell you why though, it's a bit of a nasty
place, makes you wonder what the alternatives are... whatever happens
don't follow me, it appears i'm not good with a compass.

I certainly agree that the 'All is One' idea can be escapist, an
excuse to not dig any further, but I don't think it has to be. Most

Dick Decent cited Rupert Sheldrake in a previous comment, which I
think is relevant here.

A Salon article from 1999 (http://www.salon.com/people/

feature/1999/11/23/sheldrake/

print.html) relates "when mice in a research facility in London were
taught to improve their maze-running skills, "unschooled" mice in a
Paris lab began better navigating their mazes as well." And similarly
"on a South Pacific island, a gourmet monkey discovered that washing the
dirt off his raw potato was healthy and made the spud taste better. On
islands throughout the archipelago, monkeys simultaneously began washing
their potatoes. This means the truism that ideas are "just in the air"
has validity."

Perhaps our "big brains" get in the way...

Brucelipton.com is so juicy and relevant to this current blog I will
refrain from posting a lengthy quote but here's one especially poignant
part from his work on the Human Genome Project:

"In considering the minimal number of genes needed to make a human:
we would start with a base number of over 70,000 genes, one for each of
the over 70,000 proteins found in a human. Then we include the number of
regulatory genes needed to provide for the complexity of patterns
expressed in our anatomy, physiology and behavior. Lets round-off the
number of human genes to a total of an even 100,000, by including a
minimalist number of 30,000 regulatory genes.

Ready for the Cosmic Joke? The results of the Genome project reveal
that there are only about 34,000 genes in the human genome. Two thirds
of the anticipated genes do not exist! How can we account for the
complexity of a genetically-controlled human when there are not even
enough genes to code just for the proteins?

More humiliating to the dogma of our belief in genetic determinacy is
the fact that there is not much difference in the total number of genes
found in humans and those found in primitive organisms populating the
planet. Recently, biologists completed mapping the genomes of two of the
most studied animal models in genetic research, the fruit fly and a
microscopic roundworm (Caenorhabditis elegans)."

Being "controlled" by our genes is misinformation!

Thanks for keeping this juice flowing...

Spooks confound our ability to make connections of understanding in
four key ways:

1) Scorning trying at all as paranoid 'conspiracy theory'

2) Stretching connectedness beyond the envelope of
credibility/comprehension

3) Hijacking keywords as a distraction

4) Running parallel narratives to discredit the target narrative.

I addressed creating parallel narratives and hijacking keywords in
this discussion board thread:

http://p216.ezboard.com/frigorousintuitionfrm10.showMessage?topicID=3292.topic

The examples I cited were-

>Texe and Jimm Marrs

>Ward Churchill's "little Eichmanns" comment and

CIA hiring Eichmann's assistants after WWII.

>Fox TV's 'Lone Gunman' series foreshadowing 9/11 plus the 'X Files.'

I see the same tactics back in the mid-70s described by Jeff's post
today in his comment-

"...once Crowley's cipher was cracked in the mid-70s, "contact
without communication" began to predominate: "after 1973, the 'personal
aliens with funny names' were nearly universally replaced" by impersonal
"greys."

In 1973 Air Force-CIA liason officer L. Fletcher Prouty published
'The Secret Team' detailing how the CIA had become the shadow
government.

It was suppressed and revived years later so we can now read it
online-

http://www.ratical.org/ratville/JFK/ST/ST.html

One expression being used to describe the CIA's corporate-spook
culture by Prouty and other whistleblowers was 'The Grey Men.'

(Buckminster Fuller called the CIA the "Corporate Invisible Army.")

The New Left's rebellion against corporate capitalism and awareness
of intelligence agency control mechanisms inspired a renewed propaganda
effort to overload everyone's ability to tell up from down much like
inducing a cultural LSD vision.

I've found a number of online stories by 'insiders' that weave
everything the CIA and Pentagon want to obscure into a wild tale that
few would give credence to.

I read them to see exactly what the Powers That Be want us not to
know like picking out a murder weapon thrown into a septic tank.

So many ways to confound.

Thanks, Jeff.

I just want to point out that all the while that Harner was having
the "bat-winged creature" vision something else was happening not
mentioned in this blog. During this vision Harner claims that a "great
vessel of blue-jay headed men" were slowly towing his life force away to
a fjord. This didnt bother him until he relised that somehow the
"bat-winged creatures" might come in possesion of his soul.

Also not mentioned here is that the "bat-winged creatures" told
Harner that they were the masters of all humanity and this planet. When
Harner told this to a blind shaman the shaman replied, "Oh, they're
always saying that. But they are only the Masters of the Outer
Darkness." The shaman also motioned with his hand that they had dropped
from outer space. Harner had not told him this part yet in their
conversation.

The whole story of Harner's first ayahuasca trip can be found in the
first chapter of The Way of the Shaman.

I was working at a bio-informatics company in 2001 and it was a huge

-almost- decoded the first copy of the human genome. The bio-informatics
business at the time was dominated by the Germans who had been in the

Great post Jeff,

I too am convinced that here is some great underlying and connecting
truth in the serpent/ dna.

From day one of my own journey of healing from the effects of having
the first 30 years of my life conditioned by MKUltra, in very deep
moments of inner work with my alters I tapped into moments of harmony
where everything pulsated in oneness and snakelike squiggles shimmered
all around. This only happens occassionally and always accompanies a big
healing breakthrough or event.

When I ready Darby's book (The Cosmic Serpent) I was astounded at his
research and his correlation of these visions with tapping into the
level of the DNA.

I would love to see further exploration of this.

Personally I adore these topics. My problem with many "conspiracy"
writers (including you sometimes) is a kind of spin that paints
government, military and cult agents as much more knowlegable and
advanced in these areas than they are, thus discouraging and
disempowering readers. In essence, doing their work for them.

Example: Before my first introduction to a very high level mind
controller active also in politics I was given drugs.

Then I was shown snuff films and horrible war scenes combined with
hypnotic suggestion.

Then I was brought into the room with him (and I doubt that it was
even him, I think they used someone who looked like him), with strange
lighting and light coming through the table projecting a flickering
gargoyle image. He asked me to look up so he could look in my eyes (to
check to see if the drugs were still active?) I asked him who he was and
he told me that I was his captive and his plaything and that, make no
mistake about it - we rule the world...

I had already been told by others that he was an immortal reptile who
could speak all languages and had infinite wisdom and knowledge.

Strange, because I was with him quite a few times after that and he
was always just a fat a**hole. I was even present while he was
programming other people (behind the wizard's curtain, so to speak).

Their (inteligence,military, some government) research is for use in
warfare, mind control and torture. This is a very limited arena.

If we believe them to be powerful, immortal magicians it plays right
into their sociopathic wet dream.

David Icke's take on them is almost identical to how they portray
themselves in their own torture theatrics.

It goes without saying that you can and will write anything you want
in your own blog. I would just like to add my 2 cents in saying that
it's not as much what we discuss as how we discuss it.

What further tragic event will it take for people to grow up and
realize that we have the power to stop this? The first step is to stop
standing frozen in fear and awe and begin directing our exploration,
debate and research towards taking them down and empowering our lives.

"Think globally, act locally" would seem to be the appropriate
comment on the question of whether "we are all one" is a copout. Somehow
the essence of existence is that both things are going on at once, and
we have to identify whole-heartedly with both the "global" and the
"local" simultaneously if we're going to make it work.

dugoboy -- the question you raised, I assume in response to my
previous comment, about whether we're each plugged into a larger network
or are merely referencing the microcosm within, is an old one. Plato
pretty much tried to have it both ways in considering how people derive
their knowledge of Platonic Ideas. For my part, I suspect it may be a
false dichotomy, born of our inability to fully perceive the
higher-dimensional reality of which we are a part.

I read somewhere -- I think in Sheldrake's "The Sense of Being Stared
At" -- that people score above chance on psi tests only when they get to
find out the results afterwards. This suggests that what is really
happening in these tests is not telepathy or clairvoyance or
precognition of events, but simply an access to one's own future state
of knowledge. This would tend to support the "microcosm" theory rather
than the "network" theory.

However, there are other things -- like those "eggs" that reacted
before 9/11 -- which do suggest a certain degree of group-mindishness,
but on the emotional rather than the informational level.

It's certainly an open question.

Finally, Anonymous 11:56 said:

For what it's worth, Freas was a Scientologist.

Or perhaps not. There's also :

Frank Kelly Freas had an unclear relationship with the Church of
Scientology. He worked with Bridge Publications and headed up their
"Illustrators of the Future" program, but does not appear to have been a
full adherent of their dogma. While after his death a memorial was held
at the Church of Scientology Celebrity Center in Hollywood, his widow
states that Freas was not a Scientologist.

Just a footnote on the Ray Stanford teleportation bit ... a few years
back I got to spend all day with Mr. Stanford, prodding him for answers
to my ufological questions. I'm not certain but I believe the car
teleportation story is in fact a mis-statement (told many times over) of
other teleportation related information eminating from Stanford's mythic
history. At least that is what I recall from our conversation. I think I
inquired about the car teleportation story and he said that was NOT him,
that the story was a mish-mash of his experience with Uri Geller
teleporting a meteorite. I am still in occassional contact with him and
may inquire to double check.

See for example:

Psychic magazine - September 1973

Also published as "Did Uri's mind teleport a meteorite?" in The
Amazing Uri Geller

Teleporting a meteorite

Ray Stanford

Some remarkable phenomena occured during Uri Geller's visit to
Austin, Texas, on July 21-22, 1973. Although the phenomena were
spontaneous, precluding rigid scientific control, some of them contain
significant self-substantiating elements. His brief stay in Austin was
to help in arranging two September public appearances by him, with
sponsorhip of the Association for the Understanding of Man (A.U.M.).

In his recent publication, Supernatural, Graham Hancock, (whose
missus takes the best photos of Yonaguni), prints some wild claims about
so called junk DNA.

He claims that Eugene Stanley, a professor at Boston University, did
a joint study with Harvard Medical School, applying linguistic tests to
so called junk DNA.

Apparantly a linguistic test is a mathematical process applied to
text. If the text fits the maths it is a language, if not it is random
words. One of the tests used is known as Zipf's law.

Apparantly the tests showed that junk DNA followed the same patterns
of structure as language. Apparantly as of June last year Stanley still
stood by his results.

Basically, non coding DNA seems to follow a pattern that fits to
linguistic tests such as Zipf's law.

I know there are a few people with DMT experience reading this, so
here's a question. Any of you been to "Cartoon Land" and been presented
with books to read, or any other form of unrecognisable written
information? Just a thought.

Jeff, Supernatural is an interesting read, a bit long winded but
still pretty interesting.

Or for that matter, ever come across the "culture" in Iain Banks'
science fiction?

Who controls our DNA cvontrols our future.

Keep digging away in what seems highly irrational jeff, there is gold
in here somewhere.

I love this:

"Oh, they're always saying that. But they are only the Masters of the
Outer Darkness."

I remember reading this years ago. One of the most impotant things I
ever read.

Jeff you have read a bit of RAW. It seems to me that his main trip is
that reality is a more complicated co creation that we think it is.

If those that are in power in the world start acting like
bloodthirsty fiends from outside then the Gods that rule earth become
bloodthirsty fiends from outside. If they act like flawed humans trying
to leave the world in better shape than they found it, then the Gods of
the world will do the same.

Its a feedback loop.

Is that the serpent Kundalini spiraling up that spine?

...

A "Cipher of the UFOnauts" brings to mind the Angelic alphabets of
Trithemius & Agrippa, and John Dee's "Enochian" that influenced
Crowley...

- & the buzzing language that Terence McKenna heard on DMT (the
psychoactive synth-heart of ayahuasca):

So you burst into this space. It's lit, socketed lighting, some kind
of indirect lighting you can't quite locate. But what is astonishing and
immediately riveting is that in this place there are entities - there
are these things, which I call "self transforming machine elves," I also
call them self-dribbling basketballs. They are, but they are none of
these things.

...there are many of these things, but the main thing that's
happening is that they are engaged in a linguistic activity of some
sort, which we do not have words for, but it's visible language. They
are doing the visible language trip...

Terence also wondered about mushroom spores migrating through space
to Earth, and communicating through the experience of ingestion...

Those creatures you described reminded me of a Nancy Kress book
called "Nothing Human," where an alien race called the pribir come to
Earth and inadvertently create havoc. They are master genetic engineers
who communicate by "smelling" thoughts to one another with pheremones.
They sound a bit like the creatures you describe, and they also
genetically engineer themselves to resemble humans, even though their
true form is much different. After the humans nearly wipe each other out
with bioweapons, the pribir return to genetically engineer a race of
posthumans to withstand all of the remaining bioweapons and
environmental damage. The posthumans have "Nothing Human" in them, but
they carry a human heritage to distinguish them from the pribir, who are
essentially monomaniacal genetic engineers.

Another ID with George Bush turning up as "780" is "three ordeals".
When I saw that, the first thing that popped into my head was his
comment, "I never thought I'd get the trifecta." And then I threw in a
heh, heh for good measure.

I feel rather flattered searching for permutations of my own name -
"King among the kings", "one to follow thee", "Praemonstrator" (teacher,
usually of magick), and "secret of perpetual motion". ...But also,
"mother of harlots."

...But I'm a guy!

For all the coolness this has, every time I come across a system like
this based on defining certain synchronicities through code, I wonder
how many researchers into the subject count among the books they've read
"The Crying of Lot 49"?

For example, Henry Kissinger = 1086, "Kingdom of the sun", "Victory

On your previous posting about Dubai.....

in the spirit of these endeavors & how coincidence(?) seems to follow
them:

Currently, I'm trying to read everything you've got archived here
while keeping up with current posts & links.

After reading the Dubai post I returned to your archives & this
jumped out at me:

"Le Figaro's report in October 2001, known to have originated with
French intelligence, that two CIA agents met Osama bin Laden in a Dubai
hospital in July 2001, proves again the perfidy of the French."

Then, tonight, I was finishing Jim Keith's Mass Control: Engineering
Human Consciousness & this popped out:

" further confirmation of the use of electronic torture device comes
from Electromagnetic News, detailing information originally published in
the London Observer, for Jan. 13th, 1990. According to the article, "An
electronic torture chamber, using a white noise generator designed to
pulse sound at 11Hz-apparently ultimately capable of destroying the
human body-has been installed by a British company, Electronic
Intelligence, inside the headquarters of the Special Branch of Dubai.
Called the 'House of Fun,' the torture chamber houses a strobe light,
also set at 11 Hz and synchronized with the white noise generator, the
combined effect of which is to reduce anyone inside the cell to a
screaming, helpless suppliant within moments."

Funny how a word you've never thought about before just begins to pop
up everywhere once you read it, isn't it?

Just another coincidence.

Dear Jeff,

Wow! I came across your site a couple of weeks ago, when Cursor
linked your "Accidents happen" post about Cheney's hunting incident. And
can I just say once more, "wow." I didn't think there were people this
erudite articulating more or less the same things I've been thinking for
years... All this time I've just been thinking there's simply no one I
can talk to. Of all the books I've read, besides Kafka, who is just
better than all the rest of those fuckers, the two books that have
really spoken to me are Pynchon's "Gravity's Rainbow" and Silko's
"Almanac of the Dead," and I feel like you're writing the blog version
of those two novels.

Of course it's just a self-affirming ego-boost for me to say "wow,
he's thinking the same things I am," so let me say, "wow, this guy's
really fucking smart, and erudite, and doesn't waste time trying to talk
down to idiots, and has insight coming out the wazoo." And who also
turned me on to Ductape Fatwa, who also just rocks!

I'm just very thankful to find some like-minded folks out there.

Jeff, et al-

I just mentioned Michael Harner on the discussion board last week on
the Jeff Perkin's in the NY Times! post, as a way of
understanding/combining Rigorous Intuition and my own beliefs. I guess
I'm with Henry Miller, "I believe Everything!"

I don't think that ayahuasca has a moral component- it is power and
knowledge and adventure and creativity. Morality is all those things but
something else. It FEELS moral to a moral person. Many ayahuasqueros
spend an inordinate amount of time playing dirty tricks on each other.

My first experience with the mother ayahuasca vine I was wrestling
with my philosophical/religious ideas that "God is consciousness and
love must be an aspect of consciousness", how else to explain evil? As
the visions began, and the shamans were singing, a trumpet blast of
thought language came to me from inside the vision saying,
"Consciousness is love".

Not that it explained evil. Obviously speculating on consciousness,
morality, evil and DNA is beyond this reply. Just wanted to say thanks
for your work and for the coincidences!

You could output the white noise generator though an amplifier, then
modulate the amplitude at 11Hz, either as square or shaped waves. You'd
lose the low frequency components, but with normal "spikey" white noise,
you'd never notice.

Low frequency sound can have profound physical effects. These sound
like plausible enhancements to me.

All this relates to research carried out in the 1980s - no doubt

Barbara Marciniak's books have interesting things to say on many of
the same topics jeff posts about. Grain of salt w/everything, of course.

here's a relevant quote from her most recent book "Path of
Empowerment":

"...your cells, which are crystalline in structure, eagerly respond
to natural light. Electromagnetic waves of cosmic radiation, composed of
pulsed light energies, travel throughout exitstence conveying vast
amounts of information. The human brain and nervous system function in
both physical and non-physical reality, serving as receivers for this
vast array of electrical impulses...Signals, or messages in the nerves,
brain, and body are carried by weak electrical impulses that radiate
energy into physical and non-physical reality, maintaining constant
contact with the higher power of the cosmic mind..."

and

"...on a cellular level everyone is in a perpetual state of instant
communication... the modern era is founded upon a mass belief that
gathering information is an external process, however you are naturally
designed to experience reality from an inner position of personal
empowerment..."

Her books, like jeff's blogs, often make you go "hmmm..." and always
give pause for thought, whether or not you beleive the. check 'em out.

Information overload. I just started reading Colin Wilson's The
Occult and was surprised to find another philosopher-writer exploring
the arcane, as I aspire to become. The Gematria and numerical value of
words is strange. In Hebrew, the letters are also numbers, so Gematria
makes sense in that context. In languages lacking that correspondence,
seems to me that some intelligence must set up the code for the
correspondence between letters and numbers to have meaning. Otherwise
you have a "Texas sharpshooter fallacy," where the man shoots at a barn
randomly, then paints a target around the bulletholes to show that he is
a perfect marksman. Likewise, ex post facto connections do not
necessarily illustrate anything. Somebody would have to extend this line
of thought with more statistics than I am able to employ.

I want to see more than connections, because the existence of
correspondence implies that it was set up. I would like to see
explanatory power, predictive power, or something more than words that
illustrate related concepts. I would like to see whether vast numbers of
unrelated words might also be found. The controversy is similar to that
surrounding the "Bible Code" in the '90's.

Interesting post, but is the code any more than a metaphor or only
valid for personal definitions and subjective meanings?

A very interesting article on journalist Matthew Yeomans Ayahuasca
experience in the Ecuadorian Amazon with Shaman Don Sabin Gualinga.

(http://www.mateoland.com/

ayahuasca.htm)

During the ceremony, Don Sabino warns Matthew to "concentrate... You
control the ayahuasca, not the other way around."

In addition, most Ayahuasca experiences relate how the actual
experience "mirrors" the participants "expectations".

Ultimately, how objective are these experiences? Even though there is
extraneous information to be revealed, the Ayahuasca seems to pick and
choose who it will be revealed to.

Food for thought...

Jeff, this concept of 'networking' is something Stephen Wolfram has
discussed. (Wolfram is the guy who developed Mathematica, then locked
himself up for a year or so and wrote his controversial book 'A New Kind
of Science'.)

Anyways, to explain quantum entanglement Wolfram said, "If the
universe is a network, then it can in a sense easily contain threads
that continue to connect particles even when the particles get far apart
in terms of ordinary space."

Personally, I don't think that DNA or photons are necessarily the
medium of connectivity. The kind of networking that Wolfram theorizes
has to operate outside of our universe's 'obvious' physics ie,
multidimensional physics. I mean multidimensional as described in string
theory (for string theory, read The Elegant Universe: Superstrings,
Hidden Dimensions and the Quest for the Ultimate Theory by Brian Greene
)

I have my own junior scientist theory that gravitons are the thing
that provide the means of interdimensional communication. Physicist Lisa
Randall (publications, talks at
http://randall.physics.harvard.edu/RandallCV/) supposes that the only
thing that can move between dimensions ('branes) are gravitons. Her work
focuses on trying to explain why gravity is so weak compared to other
forces and has provided theoretical work that supports the possibility
that gravity 'leaks' across branes.

Potentially there are many other candidates for networking particles.
The Higgs particle is another good possibility as it suspected of being
responsible for dark matter and force and a kind of all pervasive
'ether'.

Btw Wolfram has relevance to comment at 1:41 PM by Anonymous who
said...

"How can we account for the complexity of a genetically-controlled
human when there are not even enough genes to code just for the
proteins?"

This is not correct, we have more than enough genetic material to
account for our physical and behaviourial structure.

Following Wolfram (and others) complex systems don't necessarily have
complex causes. In fact, they have very simple mathematical type
algorithms at their roots. Take the brain, for example, about which Ray
Kurzweil says:

"There is a great deal of repetition and redundancy within any
particular brain region. Although the information contained in a human
brain would require thousands of trillions of bytes of information (on
the order of 100 billion neurons times an average of 1,000 connections
per neuron, each with multiple neurotransmitter concentrations and
connection data), the design of the brain is characterized by a human
genome of only about a billion bytes. Furthermore, most of the genome is
redundant, so the initial design of the brain is characterized by
approximately one hundred million bytes, about the size of Microsoft
Word. "

As usual though Jeff, your articulation is invaluable!

Call me an old fashioned romantic, but I would like to quote the
title of a 'controversial' author, who cites his own personal
telepathically transmitted message as a result of his Ayahuasca
experience;

"Infinite love is the only truth, everthing else is illusion"

Im kinda big on this thinking. I suspect that, whatever you think of
the book or the author, that we should all be thinking along those
lines.

Why ?

Cos in my very humble opinion - Thought is energy, and energy is
matter.

And that IMHO is what is expanding this universe.

I have a sneaking suspicion that gematria is more about politics than
about anything supernatural. It is a code used under conditions of
social oppression for concealing potentially heretical meanings within
expressions of conventional orthodoxy. (Or, conversely, for subverting
orthodoxy by exploding it into showers of heretical wisdom.)

Anybody who tries to use it as a magical device for extracting secret
messages from the names of their favorite celebrities is operating about
on the level of someone applying the Tarot or the I Ching to purposes of
fortune-telling. They may get an occasional "hit," but ultimately
they're missing the point.

On second thought, it may not be quite fair to call gematria merely
political (although that is certainly one of its uses.) It was probably
originally designed to have the Zen koan-like effect of revealing to a
disciple that things which seem to be distinct, or even opposites, are
actually identical.

However, my basic point -- that it was never meant as a
fortune-telling device -- still stands.

I apologize if the Jim Keith quote isn't credible.

I don't place any great faith in Keith's book, having found a few
glaring errors that make me wonder about the rest of the book.

My point wasn't the quote itself, just the fact that Dubai is popping
up in what I read.

As another example, around Christmas I re-read RAW's Cosmic Trigger
trilogy.

I had just finished the Sirius transmission section of the 1st book &
decided to watch a movie entitled Journey To A Prehistoric Planet. A few
minutes into the movie I was astounded to hear Faith Domergue say "We
are calling Sirius. Sirius can you hear me?"

Another example, i was reading an old Ray Bradbury story from October
Country. As I read the main character's name, which was Doug McClure, I
glanced up at the tv & saw a full screen close up of actor Doug McClure.
my son was watching AMC's Monsterfest which was showing At The Earth's
Core.

I have no idea what any of this means but it can be relatively
interesting when it's happening.

Christ, now it's codes.

Again, Keith's Mass Control:

"Persinger's article "On The Possibility of Directly Accessing Every
Human Brain by Electromagnetic Induction of Fundamental Algorithms,"
published in Perceptual and Motor Skills in June 1995, delves into even
more far-reaching mind control possibilities. Concealed within
scientific jargon that may be purposefully daunting in its complexity,
are keys to understanding just how far mind monitoring and influence has
progressed in current years.

The article states that contemporary neuroscience has discovered that
there are "fundamental algorithms" and specific codes through which the
brain operates. Persinger says that these codes can be stimulated
through " contemporary communication networks" and "A process which is
coupled to the narrow band of brain temperature could allow all normal
human brains to be affected by a subharmonic whose frequency range at
about 10 Hz would only vary by 0.1 Hz." These codes "would be determined
by the human genome, i.e. be species-specific, and would contribute to
or would serve as a substrate upon which all phenomena that affect
neurobehavioral measures are superimposed."

Persinger says that "One logical extrapolation to a neurophysical
basis of consciousness" is that "random variations of 'noise' within the
matrices could potentially differentiate between individual brains." In
other words, individuals could be identified by the specific
characteristics of their brain output. "Identification of these
sequences could also allow direct access to the most complex
neurocognitive processes associated with the sense of self, humam
consciousness and the aggregate of experiential representations
(episodic memory) that define the individuals within the brain."

Persinger states that he has been studying "Application of weak
electromagnetic fields whose intensities are usually less than 10
milligrams (1 microT). The purpose of this research...is to identify the
basic codes for the language of the representational systems within the
human brain."

Using the information thus obtained, brain processes can be
"circumvented by direct introduction of this information within the
brain...The basic premise is that synthetic duplication of the
neuroelectrical correlates generated by sensors to an actual stimulus
should produces identical experiences without the presence of that
stimulus."

Persinger says, "The power levels for these amplitudes are similar to
those associated with the signals (generated globally by radio and
communication systems)...Within the last two decades a potential has
emerged which was improbable but which is now marginally feasible.This
potential is the technical capability to influence directly the major
portion of the approxiamately six billion brains of the human
species...by generating neural information within a physical medium
within which all members of the species are immersed."

Coincidently, Persinger is on the Board of Advisors of the False
Memory Syndrome Foundation.

Oh heck, things really have moved on in biophotonics since the 1980s.

All I did was Google "Fritz-Albert Popp", and a whole load of things
came up, e.g. the International Institute of Biophysics, and a massive
bibliography on biophoton research. The Wikipedia articles on
Biophotonics and Biophoton are pretty helpful too, IMHO.

Naturally, there's an awful lot of noise around the signal here, both
from complementary medicine, and, no doubt, from mainstream science as
well. (The two Wikipedia articles mentioned above, for example, have
really quite different feels to them, even though they're talking about
the same subject.)

As with most areas of scientific enquiry, you can either move towards
(a) enhancement of human life, or (b) control of human beings. No doubt
the Powers That Be (PTB) would naturally move towards option (b).

But what could the PTB do with this research? To where are they
hoping to move us?

For one thing, photonics is related to electronics, in that it's
believed that photons will play a similar central role in future
information technology as electrons do today. Biophotonics can be seen
as a more highly energised version of photonics, because DNA is such a
(surprisingly) major source of photon emission in the human body.

Popp used a dye, which, when added to living cells, induced an
unravelling of the DNA; when more dye was added, the DNA coiled up
again. Measuring photon emission during this sequence, he noted that
photon emission increased as the DNA unravelled, and then decreased as
it folded up again.

Popp pointed out that this emission of photons in such a coherent
way, and this high degree of responsiveness is characteristic, not just
of DNA, but of consciousness also. Consciousness possesses an immediate
and intimate sensitivity to its surroundings - and so, it seems, does
DNA.

An implication of this is that there is a whole lot more going on in
DNA than just a coded sequence of base pairs. DNA isn't just an inert
key for protein production - it talks to itself by means of coherent
photon emission.

Taking a jump from this insight, might it be possible that we've only
got the tip of the iceberg here? That what's going on in DNA is bigger
than this - that it resonates with other activities taking place within
the vacuum of space, or out of another larger dimension? DNA would then
be the primary way in which these energies (or conscious entities) from
the fourth dimension would manifest themselves in matter.

Communication from this dimension would therefore naturally occur
first through the medium of DNA. Hence the shamanic visions of DNA as
some sort of portal to that which is Beyond.

A further thought: if human DNA could be shortened, or if parts of it
could be artificially shut down, our potential would be reduced - we
would become something like zombies, much more easily manipulated, more
serf-like, darker and deader. The PTB would love this scenario.

Conversely, if it could be lengthened, or if parts of human DNA could
be switched back on (assuming some parts are already shut down), we
could grow in responsiveness, enlightenment and understanding. We would
then at last recognise the PTB for the cold, heartless schmucks that
they are, and divest them of their power over us. The PTB would hate
this scenario.

It's all to play for - all the PTB need is for us to remain stuck in
the materialistic worldview they've provided for us, while they work on
further strategies of zombification. The Dark Lords (both in this
material realm, and in the ultradimensional realm) must be laughing at
all this.

But things could still go in completely the opposite direction:
towards the Light.

re: Gravity Brane at 6:13 pm

"This is not correct, we have more than enough genetic material to
account for our physical and behaviourial structure."

Bruce Lipton's writing is addressing many issues but the part I
posted addresses the misinformation still being used even to define
"genes" such as this from current Wikipedia's page on "gene":

"Genes are the units of heredity in living organisms. They are
encoded in the organism's genetic material (usually DNA or RNA), and
control the physical development and behavior of the organism. During
reproduction, the genetic material is passed on from the parent(s) to
the offspring. Genetic material can also be passed between un-related
individuals (e.g. via transfection, or on viruses). Genes encode the
information necessary to construct the chemicals (proteins etc.) needed
for the organism to function.

Following the discovery that DNA is the genetic material, and with
the growth of biotechnology and the project to sequence the human
genome, the common usage of the word "gene" has increasingly reflected
its meaning in molecular biology, namely the segments of DNA which cells
transcribe into RNA and translate, at least in part, into proteins. The
Sequence Ontology project defines a gene as: "A locatable region of
genomic sequence, corresponding to a unit of inheritance, which is
associated with regulatory regions, transcribed regions and/or other
functional sequence regions".

And now from Bruce Lipton:

"Dispelling the Myth of Genes:

If the brain is removed from any organism, the immediate and
necessary consequence of that action is-- death of the organism.
Removing the cell's nucleus, referred to as enucleation, would be
tantamount to removing the cell's brain. Though enucleation should
result in the immediate death of the cell, enucleated cells may continue
to survive and exhibit a "regulated" control of their biological
processes. In fact, cells can live for two or more months without a
nucleus. Clearly, the assumption that genes "control" cell behavior is
wrong!

As is described by Nijhout (X), genes are "not self-emergent," that
is genes can not turn themselves on or off. If genes can't control their
own expression, how can they control the behavior of the cell? Nijhout
further emphasizes that genes are regulated by "environmental signals."
Consequently, it is the environment that controls gene expression.
Rather than endorsing the Primacy of DNA, we must acknowledge the
Primacy of the Environment!

Cells "read" their environment, assess the information and then
select appropriate behavioral programs to maintain their survival. The
fact that data is integrated, processed and used to make a calculated
behavioral response emphasizes the existence of a "brain" equivalent in
the cell. Where is cell's brain? The answer is to be found in bacteria,
the most primitive organisms on Earth. The many processes and functions
of this unicellular life form are highly integrated, consequently, it
must have a brain equivalent. Cytologically, these organisms do not
contain any organelles (diminutive of "organs) such as nuclei,
mitochondria, Golgi bodies, etc. The only organized structure in these
primitive life forms is its "cell membrane," also known as its
plasmalemma. The cell membrane, once thought to be like a permeable
Saran Wrap that holds the cytoplasm together, actually provides for the
bacterium's digestive, respiratory, excretory and integumentary (skin)
systems. It also serves as the cell's "brain."

When a perception unit recognizes an environmental signal, it will
activate a cell function. Though there are hundreds of behavioral
functions expressed by a cell, all behaviors can be classified as either
growth or protection responses. Cells move toward growth signals and
away from life-threatening stimuli (protection response). Since a cell
can not move forward and backward at the same time, a cell can not be in
growth and protection at the same time. At the cellular level, growth
and protection are mutually exclusive behaviors. This is true for human
cells as well. If our tissues and organs perceive a need for protection,
they will compromise their growth behavior. Chronic protection leads to
a disruption of the tissue and its function.

What happens if a cell experiences a stressful environment but does
not have a gene program (behavior) to deal with the stress? It is now
recognized that cells can "rewrite" existing gene programs in an effort
to overcome the stressful condition. These DNA changes are mutations.
Until recently, all mutations were thought to be "random," meaning that
the outcome of the mutation could not be directed. It is now recognized
that environmental stimuli can induce "adaptive" mutations that enable a
cell to specifically alter its genes. Furthermore, such mutations may be
mediated by an organism's perception of its environment. For example, if
an organism "perceives a stress that is actually not there, the
misperception can actually change the genes to accommodate the "belief."

In conclusion: The structure of our bodies are defined by our
proteins. Proteins represent physical complements of the environment.
Consequently, our bodies are physical compliments of our environment.
IMP perception units in the cell's membrane convert the environment into
awareness. Reception of environmental signals change protein
conformations. The "movement" generated by protein shape changes is
harnessed by the cell to do "work." Life (animation) results from
protein movements which are translated as "behavior." Cells respond to
perception by activating either growth or protection behavior programs.
If the necessary behavior-providing proteins are not present in the
cytoplasm, the IMP perception units can activate expression of
appropriate genes in the cell's nucleus.

"Perceptions" lie between the environment and cell expression. If our
perceptions are accurate, the resulting behavior will be life enhancing.
If we operate from "misperceptions," our behavior will be inappropriate
and will jeopardize our vitality by compromising our health."

I am also learning the ways of the wise woman with the help of Susun
Weed who reminds us that the whole is more than the sum of it's parts
and each part reflects the whole holographically.

gaming networks on contract. If you live on the east coast, and you like
to play online interactive games (WarCraft and the like) some of your

contracting (virtual private servers - you get a block of server and
execution space in a huge server which acts like a separate server to
set up and configure for yourself - it's like self-administered hosting
or virtual CoLo), which probably accounts for mysticalinternet.com. I

"Consequently, it is the environment that controls gene expression.

DNA is only part of a much larger system. DNA, along with all the
other cellular material passed along in gametes (proteins, mitochondria,
etc) play their roles in defining the emergent organism.

I think that it may appear that there is some 'primacy of DNA' in
scientific literature. This is mostly an artifact that arises from
specific focus of work being done. But if you look at the bigger
picture, namely the scientific view of the development of life on Earth
and evolutionary process, you will see that it is in sync with what you
have written above.

A lot of what DNA encodes are adaptive systems that produce emergent
complex structure and behaviour during development, often, if not
always, in concert with environmental conditions. This is the 'genious'
of evolution. It is a increasing hierarcy that is much more than the sum
of its parts. The key thing is that the complex end-product is not
specifically detailed in a blueprint fashion therefore not every detail
has to be encoded in DNA or elsewhere. But the process and systems that
interact to produce the complexity are encoded within the organism, and
within its environment.

As far as messing with this; if you can identify critical
developmental and operational junctures and processes, you can modify an
organism, a species, etc. That is why we need 'anti-virus' to gaurd
against harmful memes, such as marketing, etc. As we merge with our
technology this will become even more important.

To anyone and everyone in general:

When I look around and see the marvelous and wondrous magnificence of
the creation, as well as its severity, I think there is a mighty and
magnificent Creator, who comprehends all things, and is infinitely good.
But, as with the creation, so with the Creator - there is severity that
cannot be disregarded.

The theory of evil spirits working from a spiritual plane to disrupt
the material plane, and especially to corrupt man, seems to be
corroborated by all the topics of Jeff's RI. Like a good scientific
theory, a preliminary test is - does the theory predict observable or
known phenomena? If it does, then the theory is worthy of deeper
consideration, investigation, testing and understanding.

So what of these 'entities' that are apparently communicating and
interacting in various ways with mortal humans? Are they real? If so,
what are their characteristics?

The Biblically derived theory of angry, and offended angels rebelling
against God, and thus becoming evil and chaotic elements, and
subsequently exerting their capacities to oppose and thwart God's
purposes, to even defeat God, if it were possible, seems to either
answer or predict all the phenomena of Jeff's inquiries in general.

I cannot take the time right now to elaborate, but I am sure many
readers here have already given lesser or greater amounts of thought
along this line. Most others who perhaps have not, I am sure can readily
consider this suggestion if desired.

I think this possibility can be considered from at least a couple of
different angles, and is very interesting for many reasons. For one, it
presents a concrete and unifying explanation for all the senseless and
absurd phenomena, and the abysmal depravity that many otherwise
seemingly intelligent and could-be even exemplary people, are somehow
reduced to.

Jeff sorry for taking up so much space, but I thought this was an
interesting thing to do as an exercise to see where it leads.

Just reading thru those transliterations and their definitions is fun
but there are weird connections all the way thru this.

All the references to the crack of illumination are interesting,
especially in light of where this discussion lead re DNA and photon
emission. I seem to remember Terence McKenna saying that language was
evolving to become a visible process of communication. All this stuff
about DNA and light leads my thinking that way.

BTW I thought I saw a comment on here about Supernatural being long

Gis: Jeff said: "The most famous channeller of the Nine, Uri Geller,
claimed contact with an off-world artificial intelligence that called
itself "Spectra..."

An interesting sidenote about the significance of that name is that
Ian Flemings' James Bond series used the term "SPECTRE" as the name for
the evil organization opposed to the good guys of M-16. As demonstrated
in the 1965 Bond movie, Thunderball, the leaders of SPECTRE wore a
signet ring containing the image of an octopus. SPECTRE supposedly stood
for: Special Executive for Counter-intelligence, Terrorism, Revenge and
Extortion.

Re the esoteric gematria references to eating "white crow" and
"mortified flesh", it brings to mind tales & teachings from various
books by India's spiritual masters of Yoga & Vedas... such as Yogananda
and others. I recall a story described in Swami Rama's "Living with the

transmutating the atomic structure of mortified flesh from corpses into
other substances of a completely different nature.

The nascent field of "mind-matter interaction" -- which may hold both
short- and long-term promise for the scientific and engineering
communities -- appears to be coming into its own.

This month's gathering of 1,000-plus attendees at a respected
"consciousness" conference in Tucson, Ariz., the impending release of a
commercial mind-matter device, and increasing commercial and government
interest in a technical Web project focused on building a "conscious
chip" are all indications the hard-to-believe convergence of
psychokinesis (known to physicists as "psi") and quantum-physics
research is moving into the traditional empirical science and
engineering space.

COLUMN ONE

Bedrock of a Faith Is Jolted

DNA tests contradict Mormon scripture.

The church says the studies are being twisted to attack its beliefs.

By William Lobdell, Los Angeles Times Staff WriterFebruary 16, 2006

From the time he was a child in Peru, the Mormon Church instilled in
Jose A. Loayza the conviction that he and millions of other Native
Americans were descended from a lost tribe of Israel that reached the
New World more than 2,000 years ago.

"We were taught all the blessings of that Hebrew lineage belonged to
us and that we were special people," said Loayza, now a Salt Lake City
attorney. "It not only made me feel special, but it gave me a sense of
transcendental identity, an identity with God."

A few years ago, Loayza said, his faith was shaken and his identity
stripped away by DNA evidence showing that the ancestors of American
natives came from Asia, not the Middle East.

"I've gone through stages," he said. "Absolutely denial. Utter
amazement and surprise. Anger and bitterness."

For Mormons, the lack of discernible Hebrew blood in Native Americans
is no minor collision between faith and science. It burrows into the
historical foundations of the Book of Mormon, a 175-year-old
transcription that the church regards as literal and without error.

For those outside the faith, the depth of the church's dilemma can be
explained this way: Imagine if DNA evidence revealed that the Pilgrims
didn't sail from Europe to escape religious persecution but rather were
part of a migration from Iceland -- and that U.S. history books were
wrong.

Critics want the church to admit its mistake and apologize to
millions of Native Americans it converted. Church leaders have shown no
inclination to do so. Indeed, they have dismissed as heresy any
suggestion that Native American genetics undermine the Mormon creed.

Yet at the same time, the church has subtly promoted a fresh
interpretation of the Book of Mormon intended to reconcile the DNA
findings with the scriptures. This analysis is radically at odds with
long-standing Mormon teachings.

Some longtime observers believe that ultimately, the vast majority of
Mormons will disregard the genetic research as an unworthy distraction
from their faith.

"This may look like the crushing blow to Mormonism from the outside,"
said Jan Shipps, a professor emeritus of religious studies at Indiana
University-Purdue University Indianapolis, who has studied the church
for 40 years. "But religion ultimately does not rest on scientific
evidence, but on mystical experiences. There are different ways of
looking at truth."

According to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, an
angel named Moroni led Joseph Smith in 1827 to a divine set of golden
plates buried in a hillside near his New York home.

God provided the 22-year-old Smith with a pair of glasses and seer
stones that allowed him to translate the "Reformed Egyptian" writings on
the golden plates into the "Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus
Christ."

Mormons believe these scriptures restored the church to God's
original vision and left the rest of Christianity in a state of
apostasy.

The book's narrative focuses on a tribe of Jews who sailed from
Jerusalem to the New World in 600 BC and split into two main warring
factions.

The God-fearing Nephites were "pure" (the word was officially changed
from "white" in 1981) and "delightsome." The idol-worshiping Lamanites
received the "curse of blackness," turning their skin dark.

According to the Book of Mormon, by 385 AD the dark-skinned Lamanites
had wiped out other Hebrews. The Mormon church called the victors "the
principal ancestors of the American Indians." If the Lamanites returned
to the church, their skin could once again become white.

Over the years, church prophets -- believed by Mormons to receive
revelations from God -- and missionaries have used the supposed
ancestral link between the ancient Hebrews and Native Americans and
later Polynesians as a prime conversion tool in Central and South
America and the South Pacific.

"As I look into your faces, I think of Father Lehi [patriarch of the
Lamanites], whose sons and daughters you are," church president and
prophet Gordon B. Hinckley said in 1997 during a Mormon conference in
Lima, Peru. "I think he must be shedding tears today, tears of love and
gratitude.... This is but the beginning of the work in Peru."

In recent decades, Mormonism has flourished in those regions, which
now have nearly 4 million members -- about a third of Mormon membership
worldwide, according to church figures.

"That was the big sell," said Damon Kali, an attorney who practices
law in Sunnyvale, Calif., and is descended from Pacific Islanders. "And
quite frankly, that was the big sell for me. I was a Lamanite. I was
told the day of the Lamanite will come."

A few months into his two-year mission in Peru, Kali stopped trying
to convert the locals. Scientific articles about ancient migration
patterns had made him doubt that he or anyone else was a Lamanite.

"Once you do research and start getting other viewpoints, you're
toast," said Kali, who said he was excommunicated in 1996 over issues
unrelated to the Lamanite issue. "I could not do missionary work
anymore."

Critics of the Book of Mormon have long cited anachronisms in its
narrative to argue that it is not the work of God. For instance, the
Mormon scriptures contain references to a seven-day week, domesticated
horses, cows and sheep, silk, chariots and steel. None had been
introduced in the Americas at the time of Christ.

In the 1990s, DNA studies gave Mormon detractors further ammunition
and new allies such as Simon G. Southerton, a molecular biologist and
former bishop in the church.

Southerton, a senior research scientist with the Commonwealth
Scientific and Industrial Research Organization in Australia, said
genetic research allowed him to test his religious views against his
scientific training.

Genetic testing of Jews throughout the world had already shown that
they shared common strains of DNA from the Middle East. Southerton
examined studies of DNA lineages among Polynesians and indigenous
peoples in North, Central and South America. One mapped maternal DNA
lines from 7,300 Native Americans from 175 tribes.

Southerton found no trace of Middle Eastern DNA in the genetic
strands of today's American Indians and Pacific Islanders.

In "Losing a Lost Tribe," published in 2004, he concluded that
Mormonism -- his faith for 30 years -- needed to be reevaluated in the
face of these facts, even though it would shake the foundations of the
faith.

The problem is that Mormon leaders cannot acknowledge any factual
errors in the Book of Mormon because the prophet Joseph Smith proclaimed
it the "most correct of any book on Earth," Southerton said in an
interview.

"They can't admit that it's not historical," Southerton said. "They
would feel that there would be a loss of members and loss in confidence
in Joseph Smith as a prophet."

Officially, the Mormon Church says that nothing in the Mormon
scriptures is incompatible with DNA evidence, and that the genetic
studies are being twisted to attack the church.

"We would hope that church members would not simply buy into the
latest DNA arguments being promulgated by those who oppose the church
for some reason or other," said Michael Otterson, a Salt Lake City-based
spokesman for the Mormon church.

"The truth is, the Book of Mormon will never be proved or disproved
by science," he said.

Unofficially, church leaders have tacitly approved an alternative
interpretation of the Book of Mormon by church apologists -- a term used
for scholars who defend the faith.

The apologists say Southerton and others are relying on a traditional
reading of the Book of Mormon -- that the Hebrews were the first and
sole inhabitants of the New World and eventually populated the North and
South American continents.

The latest scholarship, they argue, shows that the text should be
interpreted differently. They say the events described in the Book of
Mormon were confined to a small section of Central America, and that the
Hebrew tribe was small enough that its DNA was swallowed up by the
existing Native Americans.

"It would be a virtual certainly that their DNA would be swamped,"
said Daniel Peterson, a professor of Near Eastern studies at Brigham
Young University in Provo, Utah, part of the worldwide Mormon
educational system, and editor of a magazine devoted to Mormon
apologetics. "And if that is the case, you couldn't tell who was a
Lamanite descendant."

Southerton said the new interpretation was counter to both a plain
reading of the text and the words of Mormon leaders.

"The apologists feel that they are almost above the prophets,"
Southerton said. "They have completely reinvented the narrative in a way
that would be completely alien to members of the church and most of the
prophets."

The church has not formally endorsed the apologists' views, but the
official website of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints --
http://www.lds.org -- cites their work and provides links to it.

"They haven't made any explicit public declarations," said Armand L.
Mauss, a church member and retired Washington State University professor
who recently published a book on Mormon race and lineage. "But
operationally, that is the current church's position."

The DNA debate is largely limited to church leaders, academics and a
relatively small circle of church critics. Most Mormons, taught that
obedience is a key value, take the Book of Mormon as God's unerring
word.

"It's not that Mormons are not curious," Mauss said. "They just don't
see the need to reconsider what has already been decided."

Critics contend that Mormon leaders are quick to stifle dissent. In
2002, church officials began an excommunication proceeding against
Thomas W. Murphy, an anthropology professor at Edmonds Community College
in Washington state.

He was deemed a heretic for saying the Mormon scriptures should be
considered inspired fiction in light of the DNA evidence. After the
controversy attracted national media coverage, with Murphy's supporters
calling him the Galileo of Mormonism, church leaders halted the trial.

Loayza, the Salt Lake City attorney, said the church should embrace
the controversy.

"They should openly address it," he said. "Often, the tack they adopt
is to just ignore or refrain from any opinion. We should have the
courage of our convictions. This [Lamanite issue] is potentially
destructive to the faith."

Otterson, the church spokesman, said Mormon leaders would remain
neutral. "Whether Book of Mormon geography is extensive or limited or
how much today's Native Americans reflect the genetic makeup of the Book
of Mormon peoples has absolutely no bearing on its central message as a
testament of Jesus Christ," he said.

Mauss said the DNA studies haven't shaken his faith. "There's not
very much in life -- not only in religion or any field of inquiry --
where you can feel you have all the answers," he said.

"I'm willing to live in ambiguity. I don't get that bothered by
things I can't resolve in a week."

For others, living with ambiguity has been more difficult. Phil
Ormsby, a Polynesian who lives in Brisbane, Australia, grew up believing
he was a Hebrew.

"I visualized myself among the fighting Lamanites and lived out the
fantasies of the [Book of Mormon] as I read it," Ormsby said. "It gave
me great mana [prestige] to know that these were my true ancestors."

The DNA studies have altered his feelings completely.

"Some days I am angry, and some days I feel pity," he said. "I feel
pity for my people who have become obsessed with something that is
nothing but a hoax."
