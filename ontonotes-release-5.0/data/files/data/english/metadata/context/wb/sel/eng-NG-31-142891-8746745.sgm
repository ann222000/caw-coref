I mean no disrespect to the fundamentalists, but there are numerous
very beautiful and inspiring creation myths, some none more beautiful
than from socalled tribal or native people with long and time-honored
traditions.  No disrespect in the least to the western and Biblical
creation story.  But why is it that other accounts and creation
narratives get by-passed, over looked, sometimes just plain
IGNORED ???

Anyone have an answer?

Um, because fundamentalists, by nature, tend to be ignorant by
choice?

The problem with fundamentalists is, they can't be satisfied with the
lessons taught by the nice stories in the Bible. They have to believe
they're TRUE! Absolutely true, with no variation whatsoever. Forget
the fact that God actually created man and woman twice, using two
different methods, in the first two chapters... the whole thing is
TRUE, dammit!

If evolution is a fact, then Gawd couldn't possibly have created man
out of the dust and woman out of either dust or a rib, take your pick,
just 6000 years ago. Evolution would have taken millions of years, and
gosh... that's just impossible...

NOW do you know why so many other stories get ignored?

Evolution IS theory!

They like to say &quot;Evolution is only a THEORY,&quot; but the fact is that,
as a theory, it is by far the most ACCURATE explanation that we have.
The &quot;Creationist explanation&quot; is so old and out of date, hence far
less accurate, as to be obsolete and useless.  Thus, it should be
labeled &quot;false.&quot;

Creationism is still around only because it was considered to be quite
accurate when it was adopted by Judaism and later Christianity some
two to four thousand years ago. Then, it was a more accurate then the
polytheistic mythology it replaced---such as that the world was
created by sexual relations between one of the Father Gods and the
Mother Goddess and was born out in her amniotic fluids, etc. etc.
Such earlier beliefs or theories were, in turn, more accurate than the
ones they, in turn, replaced.

What mankind comes to understand in life is all in a slow evolution---
social evolution.  It grows in accuracy over the centuries.  We have a
far more accurate understanding of ourselves and the world and
universe about us now than we did in the past.  We need to keep on
improving the accuracy that way, and one way is to keep investigating
nature so we can keep improving the accuracy of our understanding of
evolution.
This is the way reality and the universe are; the way science works.

It's not that they are totally ignored, it's just not a viable account
for most Creationists.  The Biblical account has about 10 steps for
the forming of everything, and many conclude it's the ten steps
Science think on much of the time.  Now what are the odds of getting
them, the ten steps, all in order?

&gt; I mean no disrespect to the fundamentalists, but there are numerous very
&gt; beautiful and inspiring creation myths, some none more beautiful than
&gt; from socalled tribal or native people with long and time-honored
&gt; traditions. No disrespect in the least to the western and Biblical
&gt; creation story. But why is it that other accounts and creation
&gt; narratives get by-passed, over looked, sometimes just plain IGNORED ???
&gt; Anyone have an answer?
&gt; ##-----------&gt;
&gt; Because the christians, fundamentalists. etc. Can not see that there
&gt; beliefs are also passed down myths. That indigonous peoples beliefs are
&gt; just as valid or not. As any other beliefs. j.s
">

thanx to Joe Smith (response to your thoughts)
I feel, although of course this is perhaps one of the most &quot;wide open&quot;
questions posed by ancient Scripture, that our time-honored biblical
'Creation Account' may be as much allegorical and for our benefit a
teaching story (paraballos) as any of the poetic or mythos,  or the
other narrative accounts (including the ones from indigenous origin)
many of which are far more explicit (and just as beautiful) in
acknowledge the sexual component in engendering (creating) the pro-
creative aspect of CREATION.  &quot;In the beginning.&quot;

But some of the paradoxicalists, whether Zen, or Jewish, or the Greek
Heraclitus, may have a greater grasp through their &quot;unknowing&quot; than w
do by our &quot;knowing.&quot;

Which came first, the chen or the egg??

There's a Zen &quot;ko-an&quot; for you....

I was impressed that you were aware of that Einstein observation about
&quot;intelligence manifest in nature.&quot;

Not just (molecular) organic chemisry, but inorganic matter itself,
the stuff of the observable universe as far back in time as state of
the art technology can &quot;observe&quot; (radio and non-visible spectrum), the
order we discern astounds scientists, and not merely &quot;monotheistic&quot;
ones. It would be far from correct to try to claim Einstein as
monotheistic in the traditional (western and biblical) sense.
Einstein was biblical, but more poetically so, metaphorically so. He
even came close to calling himself a mystic, like &quot;God-intoxicated&quot;
Spinoza.

But he was equally adamant that he felt intellectually offended (my
word) by narrow, anthropomorphic (and ridgid, closed-minded)
theologies.

Einstein's &quot;religion&quot; was in fact a very non-religious religion, in
that he wished for emancipation, inte,llectually. He wanted a
believism (my word) that could set the imagination free.

And why not?

Alexander Pope, (returning to that &quot;intelligence manifest in nature&quot;
idea) made a somewhat correlated phrase ...

Nature is but Art,
Unknown to thee.

The chaos and anarchy of Nature actually follows principles.  When
religion (or &quot;science&quot;) closes its mind to investigation, preferring
the &quot;pat answers&quot; of the past, it also closes its eyes and ears to the
wisdom that Nature would teach.

Whether astronomy or physics or the biological sciences, there is a
need for investigators with the humility and resolve to persist, to
LEARN from nature itself.

A great scientist in practical applications of organic chemistry,
George Washington Carver, once declared that anything will give up its
secrets if you &quot;love it enough.&quot;

Intelligence evolved along with everything else. The more intelligent
survived to produce more young with better intelligence.  Very easy to
explain.   ;-)  I'm impressed that you realize this.

Yes certainly.  no gods needed for us or the billions of other living
creatures, some of which lay their eggs under the skin of a different species
and then it dies a horrible death when the offspring is born.

I hope it shows patience.  I realize that once in a while some rather
loyal fundamentalist slash creationists drop by. Again, apologies if
this gets a bit too harsh to you, lps-switch and the others. There is
a clear provocative role of the fundies, and whether you have dropped
by, or hung around, or in the case of lps-switch, I am not saying that
your CREATIONISM is all wet, rather, why cannot other narratives,
accounts, whether of yin-yang, whether of papa-god, mamma-god, there
are countless sublime, poetic, and higly literary creation myths, and
instructive, also. But it takes more than just dogmatism and a big
fundy hammer. lps-switch is not the only one, there are many fundies
of a range of theological stripes.

But please give native lore a chance. Man is OF nature, not above
nature.
