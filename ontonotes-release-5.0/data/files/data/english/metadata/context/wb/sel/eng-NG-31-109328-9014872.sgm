Prescription for Healthy Sales

Most companies today struggle with sales challenges. With
economic instability and world conflict, these issues may seem to
be externally afflicted; however, most businesses can utilize a
sales check-up to determine areas of vulnerability and to uncover
healthy, revitalized sales.

Sales is an operational area that confounds even the savviest
executives from time to time. Determining when it is appropriate
to call for reinforcement and when a simple adjustment to a
vulnerable area will do can mean the difference between achieving
results desired and a vicious cycle of one-time starts.

Companies in all industries face similar sales issues and the
extent and complexity of sales challenges vary from company to
company. However a simple sales check-up can help executives
pinpoint where along the sales process their sales teams stepped
off the golden patch.

The first step

The first step is the sales examination. Just like a doctor, this
step takes the business's vital signs to get an idea of the
health of the sales organization.

In this phase, key employees talk about where the company is and
whether they believe the cause is internal (the organization is
responsible for what's going on) or external (that means someone
else is impacting company efforts).

Internal issues may include fear or lack of certain skills or
tools needed to be successful. External forces could point to
something in the business or company that affects sales. This
could be anything from poor customer service to unfulfilled
customer expectations. Key questions asked during this phase,
include:

* What are sales?

* How do the company's sales stack up against sales goals?

* How does the company set sales goals?

The more thorough the exam, the better the diagnosis tends to be.
Working with the check-up allows participants to reap the full
benefit. Companies find that simply taking the time to analyze
the current situation yields positive results.

For instance, a large manufacturing company met for this phase.
When company executives and sales professionals discussed each
area systematically, they discovered that they were not meeting a
critical client need. Their sales message lacked the necessary
punch to move clients to buy.

With minimal adjustments, a coordinated marketing campaign and
renewed sales vigor, the company was able to move sales upward
very quickly. This was a problem the company struggled with for
quite some time, but feared that hiring outside consultants would
cost too much considering the company's already weakened sales.
The end result, however, paid them 10 times over in increased
sales, improved client relations and a turbo-charged sales force
that looked forward to selling the company's products.

The diagnosis

Once a company has disclosed everything about its sales life,
it's time to move to the diagnosis. This is where an objective
third party can truly add value. Sometimes the issues hit too
close to home. Sales consultants can walk through a sale with
company sales representatives and provide great insight into
what's working and what's not. Companies need a safe
environment to explore what is happening so they can pinpoint
what is causing the pain.

When choosing a consultant, select a professional who can be both
objective and honest, and possesses a successful track record in
sales.  The diagnosis might be changing the sales approach or it
might be to hire more capable sales people. It could be a
combination of two or more things. What is important is figuring
out what it is and moving past it.

The prescription

The next, and perhaps most active, phase is the prescription.
During this phase, companies look at what they can reasonably
accomplish  today, tomorrow and in the future to move sales in
the desired direction. This may begin with more aligned goals.
Sometimes it can be as simple as that.

While setting goals may sound easy, it isn't. Goal setting
requires a structure that can ensure sales organizations are on
the right track for its professionals and for the company.

Sales consultants who are also business-minded can determine
other operational areas that may be affecting sales. Human
resources, for example, may be hiring the wrong types of people
for the sales positions. In this case, it may be determined that
the company needs a shot in the arm, too. That's where sales
consultants with business knowledge can help.

Here's a good example. A client   company's business was going
well, but not great. It seemed like every time the owner would
turn the sales corner, something would push him back. It didn't
take long to see that it wasn't his sales efforts that were
impeding his success. It was his team delivering his company's
services. He had some employees who were very nice people, but
just not cut out for providing his service. When this part of his
business was addressed, he could more readily focus on the
business of his sales. His company has grown more than 30 percent
in the last year. Needless to say, this is a great example of how
sales were not the problem. The prescription involved human
resource changes.

The next step to getting sales to a healthy level is a sales
regimen. Once a specific diagnosis is made, the plan is developed
to keep companies from returning to a vulnerable situation. A
regimen is a plan that helps turn sales efforts into actual,
measurable results. This plan outlines what the company will do,
how often company professionals will do it, what executives can
expect from these efforts and strategies on what to do when
things just aren't going as planned. It's a scaffold for
professionals to develop new habits that will make sales easier
and that will not only help company sales grow, but will lock in
more profitable sales. It's not enough to grow sales if greater
profits aren't realized at the same time. Who wants to work more
and make less?

When sick individuals see a doctor who sends them out the door
with a shot and a prescription, what are the odds that that
person will take all of their prescription?

Very few of us do exactly what we are supposed to do. We start
feeling better, we get our energy back and the prescription goes
by the wayside. We behave similarly with sales. Once a company
has a regimen, it's tested and it's helping ailing sales,
company professionals may feel like they are cured. It's hard to
change - even when we are getting exactly what we want. In this
case - more sales.

A sales check-up can help companies stay on track. Talking about
what's working and what's not working will ingrain the process
even more. The goal of a check up is to minimize the pain so
it's not necessary to get another shot three months, six months
or even a year down the road.

One particular company owner knew the importance of staying
accountable to an objective third party. But, one day, industry
issues hampered sales and internal conflict between two employees
became almost too much to handle. The owner called to scale back
sales consulting.

It's important to remember in this type of situation that
conditions are temporary, but commitment to sales will last as
long as the lifeline of the company. After just a short
conversation, the owner decided to continue with sales check-ups
and accepted a lower expectation due to these issues. The next
month, the client was back on track having alleviated the
temporary issues.

Staying on track

Once a company adopts a regimen, continues addressing what's
working and what's not feels good about its progress, how do
professionals stay on track? That's where a coach can make the
difference between staying motivated and backsliding. Clients of
The Sales Company, including owners and professionals, call us
the boss's boss.

Becoming accountable to someone, even if that someone is within
the company, equates to bottom line success. In a lot of ways,
maintenance is the most important part of the sales program. But
how do companies maintain the regimen?

The basics are the same for everyone. Apply the knowledge gleaned
from the rest of the process and continue to expand sales
endurance. Like any good maintenance training program, companies
and sales professionals must push to work outside of their
comfort zone- just a little everyday. Make one more phone call,
use a different sales tool, push to exceed weekly sales goals.
Every step taken toward growing the sales repertoire makes newly
learned skills easier. Each skill builds upon another. What are
healthy sales?

And at the end of the sales road, sales professionals arrive at
the healthy sales they've always wanted. But what are healthy
sales? Healthy sales translate into an increased bottom line that
delivers profits and more of the right customers the company
wants. Sales success is about making sales efforts better and
more effective. It's also about enjoying the process of sales.
Working through each phase of the sales process will make sales
activities more enjoyable. Companies will be able to forecast -
accurately and predict-ably - sales performance.

A sales check-up provides the tools to help organizations meet
future goals and continue to increase long-term objectives. It
also sets a plan in place that helps diagnose and prescribe
what's needed to transform future sales challenges into healthy
sales.

No matter where a company is on the sales continuum, using a
proven process makes the sales process easier and more profitable
than imaginable!
