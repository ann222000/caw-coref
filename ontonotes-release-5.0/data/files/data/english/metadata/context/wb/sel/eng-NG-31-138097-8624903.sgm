COVER STORY

The general in his labyrinth

NIRUPAMA SUBRAMANIAN
in Islamabad

President Pervez Musharraf is in a minefield of problems, created partly by himself and partly by his foes and friends.

Activists of the pro-Islamist Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal burn an effigy of Musharraf in Lahore on July 13, protesting against the military crackdown at the
Lal Masjid.

&quot;BY a majority of ten to three, this Constitution Original Petition No. 21 filed by Mr. Justice Iftikhar Muhammed Chaudhary, the Chief Justice of Pakistan,
is allowed as a result whereof the above-mentioned direction (the Reference) of the President dated March 9, 2007 is set aside. As a further consequence
thereof, the petitioner Chief Justice of Pakistan shall be deemed to be holding the said office and shall always be deemed to have been so holding the
same.&quot;

As Justice Khalil-ur-Rehman Ramday, the Supreme Court Judge who presided over the full court that heard Chief Justice Chaudhary's petition, read out these
words, you could hear a pin drop in Court No 1. As the 13 Judges departed one by one through their own special door, the silence continued. Maybe the clunky
prose of the verdict meant that the words were taking time to sink in, but it was more likely that the 500 lawyers and members of the public who had jammed
into the courtroom remained stunned for what seemed like interminable seconds before the room broke into a long, thunderous applause.

LAWYER'S VICTORY

&quot;The judicial history of Pakistan has been rewritten,&quot; declared Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) president Munir Malik, one of Chaudhary's lawyers ,
who also led the unprecedented countrywide four-month agitation by the legal community to restore him to the office of Chief Justice.

Never before in Pakistan's history had the judiciary thrown out a decision by a military ruler. This Supreme Court did so, and comprehensively. It set aside
the presidential reference against the Chief Justice, it declared President Pervez Musharraf's order restraining Chaudhary from functioning illegal, his
order sending Chaudhary on compulsory leave as ultra vires, and his appointment of an acting Chief Justice invalid.

And, in doing so, it changed overnight the way people in Pakistan thought about their judiciary and by extension their politics and governance. &quot;From today,
the doors of the Supreme Court are shut to the generals forever. Nobody would dare impose martial law again,&quot; said Ali Ahmed Kurd, a lawyer from Balochistan
who played a leading role in the agitation, holding audiences spellbound with his oratorical skills. &quot;Today a new Pakistan is born, and today the generals
are on the run.&quot;

General Musharraf may not be on the run yet, but the Supreme Court has certainly put all his plans in jeopardy. Only two days before the July 20 verdict
he had drawn Pakistan's political road map for the benefit of the country's leading newspaper editors. The resurgence of extremism in Pakistan's northwestern
frontier was the country's main challenge, he told them. A &quot;unified command&quot; was required to tackle it, and to ensure this he would get re-elected at the
end of his term later in the year, from an end-of-term Parliament, while remaining &quot;the way I am&quot;. He pointed to his uniform as he said that.

The General put a stark choice before the editors: support me in the battle against extremism, or you will be helping the extremists. He did offer one consolation
- there would be no emergency; elections would be held as scheduled.

Two days later, the Supreme Court was to pronounce its verdict in Chaudhary's case, but Musharraf mentioned this only in passing - &quot;we have to accept it
and move on&quot;. In retrospect, it appears he believed the judgment, even if it gave him only a partial victory, was not going to change the big picture.

Given the Supreme Court's history of bowing before military rulers, even Chaudhary's lawyers did not expect such a verdict. On the penultimate day of the
hearing, Aitzaz Ahsan, lead counsel for Chaudhary, urged the court not to &quot;negotiate a halfway house&quot; in order &quot;to give something to me and something to
them.&quot; He said this pointing to the lawyers for the President and the government. His plea was born out of the certainty in the legal community that the
Supreme Court would reinstate Chaudhary, but uphold the reference against him, ordering that it be heard in the Supreme Judicial Council.

In the event, it was a clean sweep for the Chief Justice. Commentators saw in the verdict the restoration of the rule of law. &quot;The message is very clear.
It is the law and the Constitution and not the individual, however high, mighty or well armed he may be, that will prevail. An independent judiciary is
no longer a constitutional commitment or a dream, it is a self-evident reality,&quot; wrote Khalid Jawed Khan in The Dawn.

The verdict immediately altered Pakistan's political landscape. Nawaz Sharif, leader of the Pakistan Muslim League (N), or PML(N), and Pakistan People's
Party (PPP) leader Benazir Bhutto have announced their plans to move the courts to facilitate their return to Pakistan before the elections.

For Musharraf, the road that looked so easy just a few days ago is now strewn with big boulders in the form of possible legal challenges to every one of
his actions. Under the Constitution, Musharraf has to be elected between September 15 and October 15, &quot;not earlier than 60 days and not later than 30 days&quot;
before the end of his term on November 15. The President is elected by an electoral college comprising members of the National Assembly and the Senate
and members of the four Provincial Assemblies. The term of this electoral college ends at the same time as Musharraf's term, and fresh elections have to
be held by January 15.

Musharraf has pointed to this awkward calendar as one of the reasons why he has no choice but to seek re-election by the outgoing Assemblies. But the dubious
moral and political qualities of such a plan ensure that it is one issue that is certain to be challenged in court. So will his plan to seek re-election
in uniform and his holding of the dual offices of President and Army chief. Even if he retires from the Army today and announces that he will contest the
election as a civilian candidate, there is bound to be a petition seeking to restrain him as the Constitution bars a government employee from contesting
elections for two years after retirement.

President Pervez Musharraf. The Supreme Court has put his plans in jeopardy.

Add to this a reinstated Chief Justice, who in his first week back in office urged the people to stand up for their constitution, and you have a political
cauldron simmering with uncertainties. In one of his first orders, Chaudhary directed the Election Commissioner of Pakistan to ensure that nearly 30 million
people whose names were on the voters list in 2002 but are controversially missing from it this time can vote in the coming general elections. His order
came on a petition by the PPP, which alleged that a large number of missing voters were from constituencies that were its strongholds in Sindh province.

Retired Judges of the Supreme Court are of the view that judicial propriety will demand that Chaudhary does not sit on benches deciding constitutional issues
that have to do with the President. But the general impression is that other judges, inspired by Chaudhary's example of defying military authority, will
emulate him. If Musharraf was worried about Chaudhary's activism before March 9, he now has to contend with a Supreme Court full of activist judges. Justice
Javed Iqbal, faced criticism for having taken the oath of office as Acting Chief Justice only too eagerly the day his boss was restrained, despite his
not being the next senior Judge, has been trying to make amends ever since. In these last four months, he has taken on a number of suo motu cases, including
rising prices in Rawalpindi. The dignity, intellect and sophisticated wit that Justice Khalil-ur-Rehman Ramday brought to the proceedings of the full court
also raised the bar for the judiciary.

Not surprisingly, expectations from the court have risen. The legal community has announced that its struggle &quot;to establish the rule of law&quot; will continue.
As SCBA president Malik put it, the reinstatement of the Chief Justice was only &quot;phase one&quot; of their agitation; &quot;phase two&quot;, to achieve a civilian democracy,
will follow. He has also expressed the wish &quot;that every Judge of the country, regardless of lower or superior judiciary, should become a Chief Justice
Iftikhar Muhammed Chaudhary&quot;.

The immediate response from a spokesman for Musharraf was that he would abide by the verdict. Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz issued a statement urging &quot;all
sections of society&quot; to accept the verdict with grace. Wisely, the government announced it had no plans for filing a review petition. But the depression
in the government ranks is all too apparent.

ELECTORAL PROSPECTS

For Musharraf, the only option available at the moment is the hope of re-election through a deal with the PPP, an infinitely more complicated task after
the verdict. The electoral prospects of the ruling Pakistan Muslim League (PML), his present political cushion, never too high to begin with, are dwindling
with each crisis of the government's own making.

REUTERS/MIAN KHURSHEED

Iftikhar Chaudhary leaves for the Supreme Court in Islamabad on July 23 after his reinstatement as Chief Justice on July 20.

The popular disbelief of the government's version of the final showdown at the Lal Masjid and the continuing controversies about the death toll in the mosque
exposed the regime's credibility crisis. A Musharraf-fatigue has induced scepticism and cynicism about even the government's well-intentioned moves.

Benazir Bhutto was reflecting these sentiments when she said the court verdict had taken away the &quot;logic&quot; for a deal with Musharraf, and going ahead with
the idea would make her party unpopular. Commentators saw this not as closing the door on the general, but only upping the asking price, and they were
right. By the end of July, it was this option that Musharraf was seriously pursuing. Brushing aside presidential ego, badly bruised though it is, he travelled
to the United Arab Emirates on July 27, where he met Benazir Bhutto face-to-face for the first time to talk about the deal. The details were hazy at the
time of going to press.

Officials denied the meeting and PPP spokesmen said they had no knowledge of it. But according to bare-bones details published in the Pakistani press, Musharraf's
insistence on being re-elected in uniform resulted in the meeting ending in a &quot;deadlock&quot;. Benazir Bhutto drew her own red lines: the general must seek
re-election from a new Parliament as a civilian. Free and fair elections and a full-fledged democracy are seen as the only cure for militancy and extremism
now. Still, no one is using the word &quot;failure&quot; to describe the meeting. In case this option fails, the deteriorating security situation in the North West
Frontier and in the rest of the country has given room for speculation that despite his emphatic denials, Musharraf may use the emergency option.

But given the current mood across the country, Musharraf's problems may only worsen if he resorts to such an option, and his international support too would
dwindle. Influential opinion-makers in the United States are seeing the restoration of democracy as the only way forward to deal with the extremist threat
and are urging the George W. Bush administration to ensure that Musharraf follows this path.

In a recent commentary, Teresita C. Schaffer, a former Ambassador to Pakistan who is now with the Washington-based Centre for Strategic and International

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
Studies, wrote: &quot;[T]he only chance to deal with the threat extremists now pose to basic law and order as well as to Pakistani society is to mount a long-term,
">

skilful, relentless campaign that rests on political legitimacy and integrates both civilian political leadership and the Army's operational abilities.&quot;

Teresita Schaffer also advised that &quot;rather than simply sticking to Musharraf like Velcro&quot;, the U.S. should emphasise &quot;the need to respect Pakistan's law
and Constitution, and carry out genuinely free elections to achieve legitimacy and long-term stability&quot; and &quot;put its weight behind an effort to move the
Army away from the political centre stage.&quot;

Once more in its history, Pakistan stands at a turning point. This time however, in large part owing to the Supreme Court, there is widespread hope that
it will bring positive change. As retired Justice Tariq Mahmood, another of Chaudhary's battery of lawyers, put it, &quot;August 14 was the day we got rid of
the English ruler. July 20 will go down as the beginning of the end for the military ruler.&quot;

Militant backlash

NIRUPAMA SUBRAMANIAN

It was under intense U.S. pressure that Musharraf ordered military action in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas in the northwest.

FAROOQ NAEEM/AP

Workers whitewashing the dome of the Lal Masjid in Islamabad.

A total of 102 people, including 11 security forces personnel, died in the military operation on Islamabad's Lal Masjid in early July. The siege of the
mosque had just begun when, in apparent retaliation, militant Islamists virtually declared war on the government, transporting it from the North West Frontier
Province (NWFP) and the tribal frontier right into the heart of the capital, killing more than double that number by the end of the month.

In North Waziristan and in the NWFP areas bordering the tribal frontier, a wave of suicide killings targeted security forces in shocking succession and
also claimed a number of civilian lives. As many as 54 people died in a single day. On that day, July 19, a suicide bomber tried to ram his explosives-packed
car into a van transporting Chinese engineers from the southern Balochistan industrial city of Hub to Karachi but could only blow up a police vehicle that
blocked his way. The Chinese escaped unhurt, but the blast killed 30 people, including policemen and passers-by. That morning, another explosives-laden
car crashed into a gate at a police training school in Hangu in the NWFP, killing six bystanders and a policeman. At night, another suicide attack, inside
a mosque in the Kohat military cantonment, killed 18 people including three children.

Two days earlier, the uneasy calm over Islamabad after the Lal Masjid operation was shattered when a bomber struck at a rally that was to be addressed by
Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhary; 18 people died. Most of the dead belonged to the Pakistan People's Party (PPP), whose leader, Benazir Bhutto, supported
the operation at the mosque.

On July 27, the wheel turned a full circle when a man walked up to a group of policemen standing near an outdoor milk-shake stall at a popular restaurant
in Aabpara in the vicinity of the Lal Masjid and detonated himself, killing at least 14 people, including seven policemen. A few hours earlier, the government
had reopened the mosque, the damage of the gun battles during the military operation repaired and the building redone in off-white rather than the red
of its name. Violent clashes marked the reopening as the Friday worshippers, many of them students from the Lal Masjid's associated madrassas, refused
to pray with the new head cleric appointed by the government.

If the suicide attacks were evidence of the organisation among the militants, the fresh confrontation at the mosque, days after the Pakistan Army carried
out a raid inside, demonstrated their determination and ability to challenge the government repeatedly.

Some analysts link the violence directly to a video message by Ayman al-Zawahiri, the no. 2 in al Qaeda, condemning the military raid on the Lal Masjid
and asking Pakistanis to revolt or else &quot;Musharraf will annihilate you&quot;. The militant resurgence that followed appeared to be aimed as much at the strike
in the Lal Masjid as against President Musharraf's new resolve to take on the militants at the source, in their sanctuaries in Pakistan's Federally Administered
Tribal Areas (FATA) along the border with Afghanistan. According to the recently released National Intelligence Estimate (NIE), a periodic summary of the
work of 16 U.S. intelligence agencies, al Qaeda has found a haven in FATA.

Musharraf first voiced his intention to flush out militancy and extremism from &quot;every corner&quot; of the country in an address to the nation a day after the
operation in the mosque, linking those who fought the security forces from inside the mosque, including its hard-line cleric Abdul Rashid Ghazi, to the
&quot;militant elements&quot; in FATA.

But with immense pressure from the U.S. on Pakistan to take on militants in the tribal areas, President Musharraf may have had no choice in the matter.
What the Lal Masjid crisis did was give him an opening that allowed the building of a credible domestic reason for action by the military in FATA, rather
than be seen as acting under U.S. orders.

Within hours of the President's declaration, the military was deploying troops in the NWFP, particularly in districts bordering FATA. Troops had already
been redeployed a week earlier in North Waziristan. This was a tacit admission by the Pakistan government of the failure of its September 2005 &quot;peace agreement&quot;
with the pro-Taliban tribal people in the region - dismantling checkposts and halting the &quot;war on terror&quot; military operations in return for tribal commitments
not to support militancy or cross-border incursions into Afghanistan.

Lest the determination weaken, the George W. Bush administration kept a tight hold on Musharraf. A host of top U.S. officials, including Homeland Security
Adviser Frances Townsend, hinted at the possibility of unilateral military strikes in FATA against suspected al Qaeda havens mentioned in the NIE report.
In a steady build up of pressure, Bush said the report about al Qaeda sanctuaries in Pakistan was &quot;troubling&quot;. He also pronounced the North Waziristan
agreement &quot;not successful&quot; as the tribal people were &quot;unwilling and unable to go after al Qaeda or the Taliban&quot;.

Although the officials qualified the statements by saying that their first choice was to work in partnership with the Pakistan government, Islamabad bristled
at the &quot;threats&quot;, saying strikes by foreign militaries on its territory would be &quot;unacceptable&quot;.

Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz said the Pakistan military was capable of handling the militant threat by itself. Foreign Minister Khurshid Kasuri said the
statements were &quot;irresponsible and should not be made&quot;, describing them as &quot;counterproductive&quot; to the joint efforts being made by his government and the

U.S. to combat terrorism.

As if to demonstrate that it would not take orders from anyone, Pakistan declared it was trying to salvage the accord after the tribal people tore it up
on July 15, citing the redeployment of troops as a violation of the terms of the agreement. NWFP Governor Lt.-Gen. (retd) Ali Mohammed Jan Aurakzai initiated
talks with the militants through a team of tribal notables. Nothing came of the effort, but the Governor said he was leaving the door open for negotiations.

&quot;We are fighting terrorists not at the behest of any other country but in the interests of Pakistan,&quot; declared Kasuri, as security operations started showing
some results. In a weekend of skirmishes with security forces, 35 militants were killed. An operation in Balochistan resulted in the killing of a prominent
Pakistani Taliban leader, Abdullah Mehsud.

The one-legged Mehsud spent two years in Guantanamo, the U.S. offshore prison in Cuba, and on returning to Pakistan after his release in 2004, his first
act was to kidnap two Chinese engineers working in South Waziristan, one of whom was eventually killed. Mehsud is reported to have boasted that he carried
out the kidnapping only to embarrass Musharraf in front of China, whose friendship Pakistan values greatly. Officials said that on July 24, as security
forces surrounded the house in which Mehsud was staying in Zhob, the Taliban leader blew himself up with a hand grenade.

The surge in militant attacks has made Musharraf seem even weaker than before, and the pressure from the U.S. is adding to his unpopularity, but the message
from the Pakistan leader is that the country needs him more than ever. In an interaction with the editors of Pakistani newspapers, Musharraf said the country
was now in a &quot;direct confrontation&quot; with the extremists. Only a &quot;unified command&quot; could meet the challenge, he said. In order to ensure this, he would
stand for re-election from the outgoing Assemblies while retaining his military uniform. But within Pakistan, there are more takers for the argument that
restoration of democracy is the best way to tackle militancy and extremism.

Reluctant actors

NIRUPAMA SUBRAMANIAN

The agitation led by the legal community provided the Opposition parties a chance to push for full democracy, but they failed to do so.

REUTERS

Benazir Bhutto, Leader of the PPP, and Nawaz Sharif, leader of the PML(N), at the latter's residence in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, in February 2005. They buried
their political hatchet and signed a charter of democracy in London in May 2006, but it fell apart after Benazir Bhutto began talks with Musharraf.

IMAGINE a plane standing on the runway, the passengers all checked-in and clamouring to take off. And the crew never shows up.

History will document that for four months in 2007, starting with President Pervez Musharraf's March 9 decision to remove Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhary,
Pakistan witnessed an unprecedented agitation led by its legal community for democracy, the rule of law and constitutionalism. For the first time since
Musharraf seized power in 1999 from the Nawaz Sharif government in a bloodless coup, the military ruler was left weakened, confused and unsure of his next
move.

But the agitation was even more extraordinary for the reluctance of Pakistan's Opposition parties to make use of this tailor-made vehicle at least to attempt
a mass movement for a return to full democracy. As with that plane on the runway, this crew just did not show up.

Political scientists, historians and sociologists can mine these four months for years, rich as this short period is for what it would say about Pakistan's
political classes, its feudal elites, the army's entrenched role in the governance of the country as much as in the minds of its political leaders, and
all the missed opportunities for change.

For instance, had Nawaz Sharif, who was sent into exile to Saudi Arabia in 2000 through a mutual arrangement between Musharraf and the house of Saud (he
later moved to London), or had Benazir Bhutto, who went into self-exile with her husband, Asif Zardari, as the Musharraf government pursued the corruption
cases filed by the Sharif regime against them, decided to return to Pakistan on May 5, it may not be an exaggeration to say that no one could have stopped
either of them.

On that day, Chaudhary was powering across Punjab in a motorcade from Islamabad to Lahore. The &quot;non-functional&quot; Chief Justice had challenged his removal
in the Supreme Court but the legal community, led by astute lawyers in the Supreme Court Bar Association, decided that his case should also go before the
&quot;people's court&quot;. Chaudhary accepted invitations from various bar associations including Lahore, the country's political nerve centre. As his motorcade
made its 350-km road journey from Islamabad, people lined the highway to give him a hero's welcome.

In Lahore, the reception for Chaudhary was tumultuous. The streets of the city were teeming with Opposition activists, especially Nawaz Sharif's Pakistan
Muslim League (N), or PML(N). Its second-rung leaders pulled out every stop to mobilise people. The Pakistan Muslim League (PML), the ruling party in both
Punjab province and in Islamabad, had to cancel a planned rival rally. To its credit, the provincial government did not do anything to hold back the swarming
pro-Chaudhary crowds. If ever there was a moment for a political exile to make a triumphant return, it was then. In the 26 hours that it took Chaudhary
to complete the normally four-hour journey between the two cities, Nawaz Sharif could have travelled from London to Lahore at least three times. Benazir
Bhutto could have made several more trips from Dubai in that time. But the two former Prime Ministers chose not to seize the moment.

On May 12, a week later, 48 people died in Karachi as the Sindh provincial government and the Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM), an ally of Musharraf that
considers Pakistan's largest city its exclusive turf, tried to stop Chaudhary from entering the city. The death of so many people - mostly Opposition activists
- should have brought the Opposition parties together in a mass protest. That did not happen either.

The PML(N) said it could not undertake such a momentous task as the restoration of democracy in Pakistan without the support of Benazir Bhutto and her Pakistan
People's Party (PPP). And Benazir Bhutto, by her own admission, was trying to work out the terms of a &quot;working relationship&quot; with Musharraf.

CARL DE SOUZA/AFP

When The All Parties Democratic Movement was formed by the PML(N) and around 30 other groups in London on July 11, the PPP opted out of the alliance.

In May 2006, amid much euphoria, Benazir Bhutto and Nawaz Sharif signed a &quot;charter of democracy&quot; in London. The two buried the hatchet of their political
rivalries to form an Alliance for the Restoration of Democracy (ARD) along with a dozen other parties. But thereafter, she was clearly a reluctant player
in this camp, especially from mid-2006, when rumours heightened of contact between her and Musharraf.

In a series of interviews to British and American newspapers, Benazir Bhutto, whose party is said to be the country's largest, made enigmatic statements
regarding her reported willingness to work with Musharraf, sometimes confirming the rumours, at times neither confirming nor denying them, but never denying
them outright.

Two sets of elections are expected to take place later this year, presidential and parliamentary. Musharraf has made plain both his desire for another term
and his plan to win it from the sitting Parliament and Provincial Assemblies, from which victory is assured even though their own end would be near. The
dubious political and moral legitimacy of such a presidential election is plain to all. Musharraf has also made no bones that he plans to retain his second
role as Army chief. The PPP's support is crucial to this plan.

In return for not pursuing the corruption cases against her and Zardari and a power-sharing agreement in the next government, Musharraf hopes the PPP will
help in this plan. But the PPP leader was reported to be adamant that she would close the deal only if Musharraf agreed to step down as Army chief before
seeking re-election. In return, the government was said to be considering a constitutional amendment to remove the bar on a Prime Minister serving more
than two terms. Benazir Bhutto has been Prime Minister twice.

As the rumours swirled and left the Opposition suspicious and confused, many of Benazir Bhutto's own supporters and sections of her party wondered if their
leader, eager for &quot;personal gain&quot;, was not out of touch with Pakistan's &quot;ground realities&quot;. In contrast, Nawaz Sharif's strong statements against military
rule and in support of doing away with the role of the military in Pakistan's politics and governance once and for all won him many new followers.

But others saw a higher logic to a possible understanding between Musharraf and Benazir Bhutto than mere personal gain for both. Sections of the Pakistani
intelligentsia believe that an understanding between the two is in the best interests of the country at the moment. Both represent moderate forces, and
together they can strengthen each other's hands in the fight against Islamist extremism. On the other hand, the combined Opposition would include the Muttahida
Majlis-e-Amal (MMA). This right-wing Islamist coalition, a one-time supporter of Musharraf, fell out with him for a number of reasons, including his refusal
to quit as Army chief at the end of 2004, the condition on which it had extended support to constitutional amendments that legitimised his dual office
in 2003. The PML(N) is ideologically close to the MMA, particularly to its Qazi Hussein-headed Jamat-e-Islami component.

The other main MMA constituent, the pro-Taliban but pragmatic Jamiat-ulema-Islami (JuI), headed by Maulana Fazlur Rehman, blows hot and cold towards Musharraf
and is also regarded by the regime as a potential ally along with the PPP. Rehman is the Leader of the Opposition in the National Assembly. The coalition
rules the North West Frontier Province, where it is dominated by the JuI, and is a coalition partner of the Musharraf-associated PML government in Balochistan.

Through the duration of the lawyers' agitation, some opinion-makers in Pakistan warned that upending the Musharraf regime in favour of &quot;undiluted democracy&quot;
would benefit Islamist parties and the extremists. What was required, they argued, was a &quot;peaceful transition&quot; to democracy, with Musharraf continuing
at the helm and the moderate PPP sharing the steering. These voices grew stronger in the wake of the military operation in the Lal Masjid and the apparent
militant backlash in the North West Frontier areas, the conviction behind them being that only a man in uniform could tackle the extremist threat.

AP

A missed opportunity. Neither Benazir Bhutto nor Nawaz Sharif joined the thousands of their supporters and lawyers who marched in solidarity with Chief
Justice Iftikhar Chaudhary on his journey from Islamabad to Lahore on May 5.

The George W. Bush administration, whose main priority is the &quot;war on terror&quot; and the battle against Islamist extremism, is said to be especially interested
in the understanding between Musharraf and Benazir Bhutto. It is clear that the United States believes Musharraf is its best bet in Pakistan, and a deal
with Benazir Bhutto may enhance his democratic credentials in the eyes of American taxpayers.

One result of these separate and disparate dynamics within the Opposition parties was the virtual collapse of the ARD earlier in July. Benazir Bhutto refused
to attend an ARD conference in London on July 7 and 8 that was called by Nawaz Sharif to discuss Opposition strategies to Musharraf's re-election plan.
The PML(N) leader also invited the MMA, not a constituent of the ARD. Citing the Islamist coalition's presence as the reason, Benazir Bhutto stayed away.
Although senior party leaders represented Bhutto, her absence robbed the event of significance, and led to the conclusion that she was keeping her options
open. At the end of their deliberations, all 37 parties at the conference adopted a resolution to oppose the re-election of Musharraf through the present
electoral college by resigning their seats in the Assemblies, a tactic to rob the election of all legitimacy. The PPP entered a dissenting note saying
that if the eventuality arose, the MMA, with a stake in two provinces, should be the first to resign and the parties in the ARD should plot their strategy
thereafter.

But the future of the ARD is shaky. The conference saw the birth of a new alliance called the All Party Democracy Movement. The MMA joined it, but the PPP
stayed out.

Those who view the current political situation as a battle between democracy and authoritarian rule said the PPP had isolated itself and that it proved
Benazir Bhutto was moving closer to Musharraf. Those who see the battle between extremists and moderates as the more important challenge for Pakistan were
happy that Benazir Bhutto kept out of an alliance of predominantly religious conservatives and right-wingers.

Of all Opposition parties, Benazir Bhutto alone praised the military action in the Lal Masjid. But, by drawing attention to the rise of the Lal Masjid in
the last five years as evidence that military rule breeds extremism for its own survival, she underlined what many in the pro-democracy movement have been
saying: Pakistan's democracy-deficit has left ungoverned spaces, which have been filled by extremists; the need of the hour is more, not less, democracy.

In the wake of the Supreme Court verdict restoring Chief Justice Chaudhary, Benazir Bhutto said in yet another interview to the British press that the &quot;logic
of a deal&quot; with Musharraf had vanished because any association with him would make her party &quot;very unpopular&quot;. But few believe that the deal is off the
table completely.

Instead, observers are more inclined to see Benazir Bhutto's statement as a negotiating strategy to extract more political concessions from Musharraf in
return for helping in his re-election.

Dialogue in danger

JOHN CHERIAN

With Musharraf's focus on internal problems, his government may not be able to give top priority to the peace process with India.

S. SUBRAMANIUM

Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and President Musharraf have said on several occasions that the peace process is irreversible.

There are fears in some quarters that the serious internal problems confronting Pakistan President General Pervez Musharraf may have an adverse impact on
the India-Pakistan peace process. There has been increasing pressure on him from the United States after the visit of U.S. Vice-President Dick Cheney to
Islamabad earlier in the year. If the American diktats are followed, then the Pakistan Army will have to wage a virtual war against the Pashtun tribesmen
in the volatile border region with Afghanistan. Pashtuns are said to number around 40 million, with an estimated 30 million of them settled in Pakistan.
With Musharraf's focus on the volatile tribal areas, the government may not be in a position to give top priority to the peace process with India.

However, both the Indian Prime Minister and the Pakistan President have said on several occasions that the peace process is &quot;irreversible&quot;. On July 15,
Prime Minister Manmohan Singh once again renewed his call for peace in the region. In a speech in Jammu, he urged that the Line of Control (LoC) be converted
into a &quot;Line of Peace&quot; so that the land and water resources of the divided State of Jammu and Kashmir could be used by people on both sides of the border.
However, he cautioned that such a development could only take place after peace returned. &quot;Jammu and Kashmir can one day become a symbol of India-Pakistan
cooperation rather than of conflict. Borders cannot be changed but they can be made irrelevant,&quot; the Prime Minister said.

Musharraf stated in December 2006 that Pakistan was willing to give up its claim on Jammu and Kashmir, subject to demilitarisation, self-governance, a soft
LoC and a supervisory mechanism. The two countries have been engaged in intensive dialogue for the past three years. In the first week of July, the Home
Secretaries of both countries met to discuss terrorism-related issues. Before that there was a meeting of Foreign Secretaries. Manmohan Singh and Musharraf
had agreed during their meeting in Havana last September to cooperate closely in combating terror. Home Minister Shivraj Patil himself acknowledged that
the level of infiltration from across the border into Jammu and Kashmir had come down. Some observers are of the view that Islamist militants in Pakistan
are now keener on overthrowing the government in Islamabad than on &quot;liberating&quot; Kashmir. The number two in al Qaeda, Ayman al-Zawahari, has been making
repeated appeals to Pakistanis to rise up against Musharraf.

Strategic interests

The recent events could have reinforced the view in the Pakistan establishment that peace with India would serve its strategic interests better. According
to reports now surfacing in the American media, the George W. Bush administration had coerced the Pakistan government into falling in line after September
11, 2001. According to the reports, Musharraf was told that if he did not switch off support to the Taliban, then Washington would retain the option of
bombing Pakistan into the &quot;Stone Age&quot; and would give New Delhi the green signal to retake the disputed part of Kashmir under Pakistani control. The Pakistan
Army realised that it could not fight on two fronts at the same time and caved in to the U.S. demands. For the past 60 years, the Pakistan Army has been
trained and equipped to fight India. Now it has been told to focus on the fight against terrorism and the resurgent Taliban. &quot;We trust Musharraf to follow
his self-interest,&quot; a senior Indian External Affairs Ministry official remarked.

After the Secretary-level talks in New Delhi in July, Islamabad and New Delhi have agreed to enhance cooperation to combat crime and terrorism. A joint
statement issued after the talks said: &quot;It was agreed that terrorists and criminals in either country will be effectively dealt with.&quot; The Indian side
conveyed to Pakistan its concerns about cross-border terrorism and sought assurances on the dismantling of the &quot;terror infrastructure&quot; in Pakistan territory.
Despite strong denials from Islamabad, New Delhi insists that terrorist training camps and communication networks are allowed to function. India maintains
that the Mumbai blasts of June 11, 2006, had &quot;cross-border linkages&quot;.

Pakistan is not happy with the pace of negotiations between the two countries. Pakistan Foreign Minister Khurshid Mehmood Kasuri, while on a visit to Washington
in June, stated that the time had come for both countries to address substantive issues, especially the &quot;core issue&quot; of Kashmir. He said that Musharraf's
&quot;bold and flexible&quot; approach on dispute resolution and his four-point proposal to settle the Kashmir dispute was a manifestation of the &quot;sincere desire
to constructively engage with India&quot;. Musharraf's proposals include withdrawal of Pakistani troops from the LoC, initiating a meaningful and sustained
dialogue process, and examining other solutions acceptable to all parties. Musharraf has been suggesting for some time that the Indian government &quot;demilitarise&quot;
the major cities in the Kashmir Valley. This has also been the demand of the People's Democratic Party (PDP), an ally of the ruling Congress in Jammu and
Kashmir.

In the last week of July, a committee set up by the Indian government recommended that Indian troops in Kashmir vacate State government buildings, private
homes and farms that were converted into military camps and bases during the course of the 17-year-old insurgency. The committee has, however, ruled out
any major cuts in the massive Indian troop presence in the valley. The Indian Army and paramilitary started vacating the premises of private and State
government properties in 2005, but the process seems to have been proceeding at a snail's pace. The move by the Indian government is seen in some quarters
as a belated attempt to bolster the Musharraf government.

Trade and other issues

Recent statements by senior American and British officials have been emphasising the importance of the peace process for the subcontinent. Nicholas Burns,
the U.S. Under Secretary of State, told U.S. Congress that the peace process needed to go &quot;much further&quot;. Incidents of violence in the valley in recent
months have gone down considerably. The Srinagar-Muzaffarabad bus service has been welcomed by the Kashmiri people.

There were indications that both sides were close to an agreement on the Siachen issue. India's insistence that Pakistan &quot;authenticate its actual ground
position line&quot; on the glacier has postponed a settlement. Islamabad is in no hurry to settle other smaller disputes, such as Sir Creek and Tul Bul Barrage,
without the more contentious issue of Siachen being resolved first. Both sides have pledged to keep on trying to resolve all the outstanding disputes,
using formal as well as informal channels.

Bilateral trade has more than doubled in the last three years. Experts say it has the potential to reach $10 billion by 2010. New road and rail connections
have been established and there are plans to further improve the transport links between the two countries. Indian and Pakistan officials have said that
there has been &quot;tangible&quot; progress on many issues though underlying tensions remain.

Musharraf was in a hurry to clinch a &quot;peace deal&quot; with India since his historic Agra visit. He was in a position to deliver on his promises until last year.
Now, with the political tide turning against him, India-Pakistan relations could enter uncharted waters. Some people in India and Pakistan are now asking
whether the peace process will survive Musharraf.

Taliban threat

JOHN CHERIAN

A resurgent Taliban is a problem for Musharraf, both for the Islamist fundamentalism it inspires and for the U.S. pressure it generates.

SAEED ALI ACHAKZAI/REUTERS

Taliban fighters at a base in eastern Afghanistan in February.

THE current travails of Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf are to a large extent because of the resurgence of the Taliban in neighbouring Afghanistan.
The failure of the United States and North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) forces to combat the Taliban effectively has emboldened its sympathisers
in Pakistan. The George W. Bush administration finds it politically expedient to blame Pakistan for not doing enough to contain the Taliban and its militant
allies in the volatile Afghanistan-Pakistan border areas. Yet the fact remains that the primary responsibility for a resurgent Taliban lies with Washington
and its allies. As Pakistan government officials have pointed out repeatedly, their Army has lost thousands of soldiers fighting the Taliban and al Qaeda
since the U.S.-led invasion of Afghanistan in 2001. Most of the Pakistan Army was transferred from the Indian border to the Afghan border.

Pakistan's contribution to the fight against its erstwhile allies may not have been whole-hearted. It is well known that influential sections of the establishment
have continued to nurture ties with the Taliban since its ouster from Kabul. But senior Pakistan officials deny that Islamabad is helping the Taliban to
stage a comeback.

A senior Pakistani official told this correspondent last year that it was only a question of time before the Taliban launched a military offensive. The
official, who had served in Kabul, said that the Taliban had hidden large caches of weaponry, much of it in &quot;mint condition&quot;, when the U.S. invaded Afghanistan.
The Disarmament of Illegal Arms Groups in Afghanistan (DIAG), an organisation formed by the Afghan government, has reported that weapons abandoned by the
Soviet Union are now being moved by professional smugglers to Taliban strongholds in the south. Furthermore, the sophisticated weapons the Americans themselves
provided Afghans to fight the Soviet army in the 1980s are now in the hands of the Taliban, the ideological successors of the &quot;mujahideen&quot;, who were backed
by the U.S., Pakistan and Saudi Arabia.

ABDULLAH NOOR/AP

Pakistani tribesmen read a pamphlet distributed by militants in the main bazaar of Miran Shah, North Waziristan, on the Pakistan border with Afghanistan
on July 15. The tribal leaders in the region announced that they were breaking a peace deal with the government the same day.

The Taliban has changed its military tactics in recent years; now small groups of fighters stage regular hit-and-run attacks on U.S. and NATO forces. More
ominously, it has started replicating the tactics of the resistance in Iraq, including suicide bombings and using improvised explosive devices (IEDs).
The number of suicide attacks increased from 27 in 2005 to 139 in 2006, and, looking at the numbers thus far, it is likely that even more will occur this
year.

According to reports in the Western media, Taliban training camps run by al Qaeda can be found on both sides of the border - in the provinces of Khost and
Pastia in Afghanistan and the tribal regions of North and South Waziristan in Pakistan.

Now that the Taliban has regrouped and U.S. and NATO forces are woefully overextended, the military tide seems to be turning. Since January, 114 Western
soldiers have been killed. In recent months, U.S. and NATO forces have launched operations in the south and the east of the country aimed at regaining
territory captured by the Taliban. There has been a dramatic rise in kidnappings involving foreign nationals, especially from countries that are militarily
involved in Afghanistan. The Taliban leadership is aware that many countries are ambivalent about their involvement in Afghanistan. The South Korean government
has already announced that its small military contingent will be going home by the end of the year.

There are signs that the international mission in Afghanistan is wobbling at this juncture. The public support that the international force initially received
seems to have eroded dramatically; it is now viewed as an arrogant occupier, who disrespects local customs and engages in punitive bombing of civilians.
According to recent independent estimates, U.S. and NATO forces have killed more non-combatants than Taliban soldiers. With too few troops on the ground,
the U.S. and NATO military has resorted to bombing from the air to keep the Taliban at bay. Afghan President Hamid Karzai has cautioned his Western allies
against using indiscriminate force. &quot;Afghan life is not cheap and should not be treated as such,&quot; he said on June 23 after more than 100 non-combatants
were killed in a single week in U.S. Air Force bombings.

MICHAEL SHON/AP

Afghanistan President Hamid Karzai has cautioned his U.S. Allies against using excessive force.

The fact is that the authority of Karzai today barely extends beyond the capital and the main cities. The power vacuum left is being rapidly filled by the
Taliban. A Canadian government report on Afghanistan, prepared last November and obtained by the Canadian newspaper Globe and Mail under the Freedom of
Information Act, revealed that a &quot;secret memo&quot; was circulated warning that Afghanistan was in danger of splitting into two and that the influence of Karzai
&quot;wa s weakening to a new low&quot;.

Under the present circumstances, if the Taliban returns to power in Kabul, Pakistan could pay a heavy price. The &quot;new&quot; battle-hardened Taliban is more receptive
to al Qaeda than to Islamabad. After the Lal Masjid showdown in Pakistan, Pashtun tribal leaders from provinces on the border with Afghanistan renounced
the peace accord with Islamabad. Islamist fervour is reportedly on the rise in the area; a group that calls itself the &quot;Pakistani Taliban&quot; has already
raised the banner of revolt against Islamabad. The Bush administration is putting pressure on the Pakistan government to launch an all-out offensive in
the tribal areas. In highly publicised statements, senior U.S. officials have said that the U.S. reserves the right to act on its own if the Pakistan Army
does not take the initiative. The U.S. Air Force has bombed alleged al Qaeda targets inside Pakistani territory on several occasions in the past. U.S.
Special Forces have also been carrying out small-scale &quot;special operations&quot; across the Pakistan-Afghanistan border.

Washington is no doubt aware, like the rest of the international community, that the Taliban has control of most of the southwestern part of Pakistan. The
Taliban leader, Mullah Omar, and members of al Qaeda's leadership are said to be hiding in the region. The thousands of square miles across the Afghan-Pakistan
border have been described by some observers as an &quot;autonomous jehadistan&quot;. The people here do not recognise the arbitrary border drawn by the British
in 1893.

Another important factor responsible for the resurgence of the Taliban is the &quot;boom&quot; in opium production. In the last years of Taliban rule, the Afghan
government was successful in drastically reducing the amount of opium produced in the country. In the year 2000, the Taliban banned the cultivation of
poppy flowers from which opium is derived. The United Nations even gave a good certificate to the Taliban government for its efforts to curtail the illegal
trade in narcotics. However, five years after the U.S.-led invasion, Afghanistan has re-emerged as the biggest producer of the drug. The Taliban no longer
discourages the cultivation of poppy seeds, on which more than three million Afghan farmers are dependent for their livelihood. Like other guerilla forces
around the world, the Taliban levies a war tax on those involved in its production and export. Taliban coffers are said to be flush with money levied from
the traffickers. According to reports, this has helped the Taliban recruit fighters. In a country where unemployment is rampant, the Taliban is said to
pay $5 a day to many of its fighters, much more than the small salary soldiers of the Afghan army receive from Karzai's government.

When the U.S. Army invaded Afghanistan, only around 7,600 hectares were under poppy cultivation. Today, despite the heavy-handed poppy eradication programme,
which is largely funded by the U.S., around 165,000 hectares are under poppy cultivation. According to reports, this year the area under poppy has increased
by more than 60 per cent. Many of the politicians and warlords, currently allied to the Americans and Karzai, are known to have links with the heroin trade.

Pouring oil on a pile of opium products before setting it on fire during an official ceremony in Kabul on June 27. The country's booming opium production
is financing the Taliban resurgence.

Before the U.S.-backed war against the Soviet forces in Afghanistan in the 1980s, the country produced no heroin at all. Alfred McCoy, writes in his book
The Politics of Heroin that through the American intelligence agencies the Rea gan administration encouraged Afghan warriors masquerading as mujahideen
to grow poppy in order to finance their fight against the Afghan Communists and their Soviet ally. Mujahideen commanders and Pakistani Army officers helped
smooth over the process of refining heroin and transporting it to lucrative markets in the West. The CIA gave the entire operation legal cover. After the

U.S. invaded Afghanistan, U.S. intelligence agencies once again struck up a close rapport with the drug lords in the hunt for al Qaeda and Taliban leaders.
A U.S. official told a New York Times reporter in 2004 that the Bush administration was soft on the drug kings because they were &quot;the guys who helped us
liberate this place in 200 1&quot;. NATO's supreme commander, Marine General Jim Jones, recently told the U.S. Congress that Afghanistan is &quot;unfortunately well
on its way&quot; to becoming a &quot;narco-state&quot;.

Conditional crutch

VIJAY PRASHAD

Musharraf can count on Washington's support provided he takes &quot;active steps&quot; to bring the Pakistan-Afghanistan border region under control.

CHARLES DHARAPAK/AP

President Bush and Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf in Islamabad in March 2006. The White House told the media that either Musharraf &quot;is going to have
to be more aggressive&quot; in the regions that border Afghanistan or the U.S. will strike on its own.

IF General Pervez Musharraf quits his dual role in Islamabad, he could become an analyst on American television. During his tour of the country last year
to promote his new book In the Line of Fire, he charmed almost all the televis ion interviewers (including the comedian Jon Stewart) and earned favourable
marks for his candidness and humour. His sharp words about the war on Iraq won him friends among the liberals, and his promise to crack down on al Qaeda
drew praise from the conservatives. In his book, Musharraf splits the difference constantly. For instance, he tells the reader that his military has arrested
689 al Qaeda members and handed over 369 of them to the U.S. but that the U.S. government has not provided Pakistan's security services with state-of-the-art
technology for counter-insurgency. That is, he is doing his best, holding back the hordes, and he expects his allies in Washington to do their part in
return.

Musharraf's attempt to retain his dignity in such a vice is commendable, although Washington could not care less. He is still, in the White House's eyes,
a satrap of a distant and dangerous province. On July 19, White House spokesman Tony Snow told the media that Musharraf was &quot;going to have to be more aggressive&quot;
in the regions that border Afghanistan or the U.S. would strike on its own. &quot;We never rule out any options,&quot; said Snow, &quot;including striking actionable
targets.&quot; The White House's Homeland Security Adviser, Frances Townsend, made the same point two days earlier: &quot;There's no question, the President [Bush]
has made it perfectly clear, if we had actionable targets anywhere in the world, putting aside whether it was Pakistan or any place else, we would pursue
the targets.&quot; The nature of the pressure on Musharraf was clear when Townsend said, &quot;It is no secret there have been a series of very senior-level U.S.
government officials to engage with President Musharraf and address this issue.&quot; These officials include Vice-President Dick Cheney, Defence Secretary
Robert Gates and Deputy Secretary of State John Negroponte.

The day before Snow's press conference, The New York Times revealed that the White House held a series of high-level meetings on Pakistan. Veteran correspondents
David Sanger and Mark Mazzetti wrote: &quot;In weighing how to deal with the Qaeda threat in Pakistan, American offi cials have been meeting in recent weeks
to discuss what some said was emerging as an aggressive new strategy, one that would include both public and covert elements. They said there was growing
concern that pinprick attacks on Qaeda targets were not enough, but also said some new American measures might have to remain secret to avoid embarrassing
General Musharraf.&quot; On July 21, in his weekly radio address, President George W. Bush reaffirmed his support for Musharraf despite the General's poor standing
in Pakistan. But he offered this support with a caveat, that Musharraf take &quot;active steps&quot; to take charge of the Pakistan-Afghanistan border region.

In September 2006, the Pakistan military withdrew their forces from the Pakistan-Afghanistan borderlands with the proviso from tribal leaders that they
would clamp down on cross-border raids by pro-Taliban and other insurgents. Raids have continued just as U.S. use of air power has escalated in the region.
(Even Afghan President Hamid Karzai has taken to the use of very strong language in his criticism of the use of overwhelming military force by the U.S.,
which results, inevitably, in the death of civilians). Townsend dismissed the deal as a failure, saying: &quot;It hasn't worked for Pakistan. It hasn't worked
for the United States.&quot; The U.S. wants the Pakistani Army to re-enter the provinces, to secure the border and to go after the militants. This is a tall
order, and it was the very failure of this policy that led to the September 2006 deal. Townsend recognises the costs: &quot;Just this month, they've lost upwards
of 80 soldiers in the fight, so there should be no question that Pakistan takes it seriously for their own reasons, and we are working with them to encourage
them to deny Pakistan as a safe haven. They don't want Pakistan as a safe haven for themselves.&quot;

Who the &quot;they&quot; is in the last sentence is unclear. If it is the top brass around Musharraf, who feel U.S. pressure on a daily basis, this is perhaps true.
The development aid promised to Pakistan, which has bolstered its otherwise fractious economy, is central to whatever last shred of legitimacy Musharraf
retains. Assistant Secretary of State Richard Boucher linked the continuation of part of the aid to a military response. &quot;I think first and foremost we
have to remember that some military action is necessary, and will probably have to be taken&quot; before the U.S. will start giving the Pakistan government
about $150 million per year to develop the tribal regions, Boucher said.

Within the military too there is a lack of consensus on the closure of the border and of its re-entry into the borderlands. Major General Waheed Arshad,
for instance, warned against a forward policy into the region. &quot;You can't just start bombing and targeting areas with civilians living around there. It
would be playing right into the hands of the militants and extremists, &quot; he said.

If there is little political will to enter the region, there is even less strategic clarity. Several hundred Pakistani soldiers have died in trying vainly
to seal a border that seems impossible to control. The White House is, as on other things, oblivious to ground reality. All Snow could offer was the firm
suggestion that &quot;it is clearly of the utmost importance to go in there and deal with the problem in the tribal areas&quot;. How one is to &quot;deal with the problem&quot;
was not specified. This is particularly important since the U.S. plans to withhold development aid until there is a military solution. The guns must precede
the butter. In his book Musharraf writes: &quot;The Pakistan Army has always been held in high esteem as the only powerful stabilising factor in the nation.&quot;
Whether this has ever been true (as Ayesha Siddiqa contests in her powerful new book, Military Inc.) is questionable; it is certainly no longer true after
the way the political elite s have leaned on the military to solve the political problems in Balochistan, in the capital Islamabad (with the Lal Masjid
fundamentalists) and now on the border.

A senior U.S. government official who took part in the White House discussion on Pakistan told The New York Times that the U.S. appreciated Musharraf's
challenge: &quot;We've seen in the past that he&amp;

TARIQ MAHMOOD /AFP

After a rocket attack by suspected Islamist militants on Bannu, a town on the fringes of the tribal district of North Waziristan, Pakistan, on July 25.

#8217;s sent people in and they get wiped out. You can tell from the language today that we take the threat from the tribal areas incredibly seriously.
It has to be dealt with. If he can deal with it, amen. But if he can't, he's got to build and borrow the capability.&quot; To &quot;build and borrow&quot; in this context
probably refers to U.S. aid for Pakistan's military and to the new threat that the U.S. itself would use force in the region.

Lieutenant Hamid Gul said of Musharraf: &quot;He is so weak internally that he needs American support.&quot; Much the same could be said of Bush. Critics of his foreign
policy argue that his war on Iraq robbed the U.S. military and intelligence services of the much-needed resources to quell al Qaeda and to suppress the
Taliban. Last year, the already overstretched Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) closed down its unit responsible for finding Osama bin Laden. A recent
National Intelligence Estimate from early July provided fodder for this view: &quot;We assess [al Qaeda] has protected or regenerated key elements of its Homeland
attack capability, including: a safe haven in the Pakistan Federally Administered Tribal Areas, operational lieutenants, and its top leadership.&quot; Bush's
pressure on Musharraf must be seen in the context of the firestorm within the U.S. for his failed policy against al Qaeda.

In the July-August 2007 issue of Foreign Affairs, former State Department official Daniel Markey writes of the &quot;False Choice in Pakistan&quot;. Acknowledging
that there is a strong element around the White House that is eager to put more pressure on Pakistan (including sanctions), he writes: &quot;Any attempt to
crack down on Pakistan will exacerbate distrust, resulting in increased Pakistan support for jehadists; coercive threats will undermine confidence without
producing better results.&quot; Markey was part of the Bush administration from 2003 to 2007, so he is no stranger to its inner workings. &quot;The Bush administration,&quot;
he writes, &quot;has failed to broaden its partnership with Pakistan much beyond army headquarters; it views the civilian dimension to Pakistani politics as
a distraction rather than an integral part of the counter-terrorism effort. Most Pakistanis believe that Washington is all too happy to work with a pliant
army puppet.&quot; Musharraf's charm has operated as a screen to block off the rest of Pakistan society from American eyes. Washington, in other words, needs
to work with the military and also strengthen the civilian leadership (and not fear a &quot;Hamas-style victory for extremists&quot;).

Neither the Bush team nor establishment critics such as Markey, however, believe that there is a political solution to the borderlands. &quot;Even if the army
eventually retires from politics,&quot; writes Markey, &quot;it will remain an essential instrument in Pakistan's fight against terrorism.&quot; In other words, the borderlands
will still need to be subdued, either by Pakistani fingers on the trigger, egged on by the White House, or by American hands on the controls that send
off cruise missiles.

PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS

Clear winner

VENKITESH RAMAKRISHNAN
in New Delhi

UPA nominee Pratibha Patil wins big and the BJP's attempt to convert the poll into a game of realpolitik comes a cropper.

VIJAY VERMA/PTI

President Pratibha Patil in the forecourt of the Rashtrapati Bhavan after the guard of honour during the ceremonial welcome on July 25.

A SENSE of cheerfulness was palpable in the precincts of Parliament House as the mounted guard of honour escorted the limousine carrying Pratibha Devisingh
Patil, India's first woman President, in its first journey towards Rashtrapati Bhavan after the swearing-in ceremony on the evening of July 25.

Leaders of all political parties were present at the ceremony. Among them were leaders of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), including former Prime Minister
Atal Bihari Vajpayee, party president Rajnath Singh, former Vice-President and defeated presidential candidate Bhairon Singh Shekhawat and former Union
Minister Sushma Swaraj, who had virtually led the trenchant campaign against Pratibha Patil, and Najma Heptulla who is the National Democratic Alliance
(NDA) candidate for the post of Vice-President.

Najma Heptulla even stated exuberantly to the media: &quot;It is a matter of pride that a woman has been sworn in as the President after so many years of freedom.&quot;
It appeared as if the bitterness that characterised the election campaign was a thing of the past.

Still, a number of leaders and Members of Parliament (MPs) of the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), which emerged in the election as one of the strongest supporters
of the Congress and the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) led by it, used the occasion to draw attention to the slip-ups of the BJP in the election.

This group of leaders, including the BSP's number two, Satish Chandra Mishra, and a number of MPs, had accompanied their party chief and Uttar Pradesh Chief
Minister Mayawati to the swearing-in. After the ceremony, standing outside the main gate of Parliament House and a little away from leaders of other parties,
they discussed issues relating to the election.

Noting the bonhomie that the BJP leaders exuded, they said it would have been far better if the leadership of the principal Opposition party had shown the
same sense of accommodation during the campaign.

The reference, obviously, was to the manner in which the BJP made a series of allegations against Pratibha Patil and her relatives, ranging from financial
irregularities to bank scams to involvement in a murder case. The vehemence with which they made the allegations was reflected in senior BJP leader Lal
Krishna Advani's statement that Pratibha Patil was not fit to occupy Rashtrapati Bhavan. He even demanded that the Congress and the UPA withdraw her candidature.
&quot;One can say better late than never, but in all probability the drubbing the BJP received in the election must have helped implant this change of style
and sense of accommodation,&quot; said one of the MPs.

Advani's explanation a day earlier for the BJP's participation in the swearing-in was that &quot;it considered the sanctity of the country's highest constitutional
office to be more important than the person elected to the post&quot;. Advani said the BJP &quot;is a firm believer in the constitutional order and therefore it
will continue to show due respect to the office of the President of India&quot;.

Not apologetic

Advani maintained that his party was not apologetic about the issues it had raised in the campaign phase and added that they would continue to be as relevant
in the time to come as they were before. &quot;The outcome of the election,&quot; Advani emphasised, &quot;does not in the least diminish the importance of the issues
raised to India's polity.&quot;

Obviously, the political reasoning of the BJP leadership does not suggest even remotely that it slipped up during the campaign. But even the impressive
rationalisation skills of Advani cannot shroud the resounding defeat the party suffered in the election. It was a comprehensive defeat both in terms of
numbers and in terms of the strategic objective of the campaign.

The fundamental objective of the campaign was to motivate &quot;conscience voting&quot; from segments of the presidential electoral college, including those belonging
to pro-UPA political organisations and those affiliated to the United National Progressive Alliance (UNPA), a combination of eight regional parties including
the Samajwadi Party (S.P.), the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK), the Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) and the Telugu Desam Party (TDP).

The calculation in BJP circles was that the allegations against Pratibha Patil and Bhairon Singh Shekhawat's personal connections with legislators belonging
to the constituents of the UPA and the UNPA would help fulfil the conscience-vote objective.

But, as it turned out, not only was the BJP not able to garner votes from the other side, it also lost the &quot;assured votes&quot; of its own legislators. In the
final tally, Pratibha Patil had a vote value of 6,38,116 and Shekhawat 3,31,306 in an electoral college with a total vote value of 10.98 lakh.

The electoral college consisted of 4,472 votes. Of this, 4,394 were the valid votes this time, with a value of 9,69,422. In the proportional representation
system of voting, MPs have a uniform value of 708 for each vote, while the value of the vote of a Member of a Legislative Assembly (MLA) differs from State
to State. Uttar Pradesh, the most populous State, accounts for the highest value of 208 for each vote and Sikkim the lowest value of seven.

In terms of vote share, Pratibha Patil won 65.82 per cent of the valid votes. The break-up is as follows: In Parliament, 442 votes for Pratibha Patil and
232 for Shekhawat; in the States and Union Territories put together, 2,489 votes for Pratibha Patil and 1,217 for Shekhwat. These figures came as a shock
to the BJP leadership as it had expected Shekhawat to get a minimum vote value of 3,41,000.

A close observation of the polling showed that the so-called &quot;conscience voting&quot; that the BJP banked on actually worked in favour of the UPA candidate.
Pratibha Patil gained from cross-voting in the BJP-ruled States of Gujarat and Chhattisgarh. In Gujarat, the repercussions of the election manifested,
almost immediately, in the expulsion of four MLAs who apparently voted for Pratibha Patil. All the four belong to the faction opposed to Chief Minister
Narendra Modi.

Pratibha Patil also made unexpected gains in Assam, where 15 legislators of the Asom Gana Parishad (AGP), a constituent of the UNPA, voted in her favour.
In BJP-ruled Madhya Pradesh, too, Shekhawat got fewer votes than expected, as about 11 votes were invalidated because they were inscribed with pro-Hindutva
slogans such as &quot;Jai Sri Ram&quot;.

The BJP's partners in the NDA and it allies outside it also let the party down. The Shiv Sena broke ties with the party at the start of the campaign stating
that it would not oppose the candidature of fellow-Maharashtraian Pratibha Patil. On polling day, the Trinamul Congress and the Janata Dal (Socialist),
partners of the BJP in West Bengal and Karnataka respectively, abstained.

RAVEENDRAN/AFP

Bhairon Singh Shekhawat, who resigned as Vice-President following his defeat in the presidential election, with senior BJP leaders Atal Bihari Vajpayee
and Sushma Swaraj, who was his spokesperson in the election.

Shekhawat's celebrated connections seem to have worked in only two States: Rajasthan, his home State, where he got the support of four INLD members, and
Tamil Nadu, where he got 58 votes from members of the AIADMK and the Marumalarchi Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (MDMK). In Madhya Pradesh, some evidence of
his connections could be seen as five members of the S.P. voted in his favour.

Members of these parties, all constituents of the UNPA, voted for Shekhawat despite the decision of their respective parties to abstain. But these gains
were offset by the loss of BJP votes in Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh.

There are interpretations, however, that the pro-Shekhawat turn in Tamil Nadu and Madhya Pradesh are not exactly a manifestation of his own connections
but the result of some hard work put in at the Centre and in the States by BJP leaders such as former Finance Minister Jaswant Singh.

The quantitative dimensions of the contest were far worse for the BJP than expected. In qualitative terms, it showed that mere allegations were not enough
to sway committed Members of Parliament and the State Assemblies. It also affirmed that for a legislator, political affiliations were more important than
personal connections .

The BJP had built up its campaign by raising the hope in its rank and file that its strategy would at least serve to embarrass the UPA and the Congress,
but going by the results the effort seems to have boomeranged.

The BJP is not the only political party that has suffered because of the breakdown in morale. The UNPA, which has been trying to assert its presence on
the nation's political scene over the last two months, faced a similar fate. AIADMK chief Jayalalithaa feigned ignorance about her legislators' decision
to give up the &quot;abstention of presidential poll&quot; line and maintained that her MLAs and MPs voted on their own without any instructions from her. She blamed
the U-turn of her legislators on the &quot;unnecessary confusion&quot; about polling created by the Election Commission.

UNPA exposed

The argument did not carry any credibility. More importantly, it exposed the UNPA's lack of organisational and political cohesiveness as a Third Front,
which proclaims an equidistant line from the Congress-led UPA and the BJP-led NDA.

The flip-flop of the AIADMK and the INLD showed that the UNPA did not have the ideological clarity it claimed to have. It also indicated that in spite of
the proclaimed &quot;equidistance from the NDA and the UPA&quot;, parties such as the AIADMK and the INLD would like to keep their options open with the BJP and
the NDA.

Overall, the presidential poll struck a decisive blow against the BJP's hopes of converting it into a game of realpolitik. The poll also seriously damaged
the UNPA's credentials as a principled political formation. Whether the bonhomie at the swearing-in is the BJP's tactical retreat or an unconditional acceptance
of Pratibha Patil's presidency only time will tell.

Meanwhile, India's first woman President listed her priorities in her maiden speech. She maintained that &quot;empowerment of women is particularly important&quot;
to her as &quot;it leads to the empowerment of the nation&quot;. She called for universal education and promised to fight for the vast mass of the underprivileged
in the country.

Honest pursuit of such an agenda should evoke widespread support from across the political spectrum and the masses.

CRIME

Orissa's unborn daughters

PRAFULLA DAS
in Nayagarh and Bhubaneswar

The female foeticide expose in Nayagarh points to a practice that is prevalent throughout the State.

PICTURES: ASHOKE CHAKRABARTY

At the venue of a demonstration organised by AIDWA activists in front of the State Secretariat in Bhubaneswar on July 24.

ONCE you leave Orissa's fairly green capital city of Bhubaneswar and head towards the district headquarters town of Nayagarh, about 100 kilometres away,
virtually everything appears greener. The rainwater-filled paddyfields and farmers at work make you feel everything is all right with Orissa.

But just 6 km before Nayagarh, at the Itamati panchayat headquarters, one gets an indication that this is not the case. A blue roadside signboard in Oriya
reads: &quot;For safe termination of pregnancy and motherhood, Dr. Nabakrushna Sahu, MD (O&amp;G) Utkal, Kalpana Complex, Nayagarh.&quot; The town recently hit the headlines
for its network of doctors and owners of nursing homes and ultrasound clinics engaged in the unethical medical practice of sex determination and female
foeticide.

Kalpana Complex has been very much in the news as it housed Krishna Clinic, a nursing home that has been pulled up for carrying out mass female foeticide.
The clinic was owned by Nabakrushna Sahu's wife Sabita Sahu. Sahu, who is still in government service, has been on leave for the past two years, apparently
to manage his wife's clinic.

Sabita Sahu is now in judicial custody following her arrest, while Sahu is absconding. Sabita Sahu's arrest came soon after the Nayagarh police retrieved
large quantities of infant body parts from a 6-metre-deep pit that her clinic allegedly used to dump medical waste. Between July 22 and July 25, the authorities
took out around 150 polythene packets containing medical waste, many of them had infant skulls and bones. Local people who watched the three-day action
said that the body parts recovered would be of more than 60 foetuses.

On July 24, this writer found a large number of bones and skulls still lay scattered near the well sealed by the police. The size of the bones varied from
2.5 centimetres to 10 cm. The human remains were not very old or decomposed.

The crime came to light on July 14 when a 12-year-old schoolboy saw seven female foetuses packed in bloodstained polythene bags, while searching for waste
bottles near Duburi hills close to Ramachandiprasad village, a few kilometres from Nayagarh town. People from nearby areas thronged the spot as the news
spread. The well, situated on a site on the outskirts of the town and belonging to Krishna Clinic, is hardly 100 m away from the Saraswati Sishu Vidya
Mandir school.

An Oriya television channel reported the incident the same day. However, the foetuses had disappeared by the time the Nayagarh police reached the spot in
the evening.

The Chief District Medical Officer, M.M. Ali Baig, said that according to medical experts the infant body parts, particularly the long bones recovered from
the pit, belonged to foetuses that were about five to six months old. Ali was transferred to Nayagarh on July 12, just two days before the racket was exposed.
In fact, Nayagarh district has seen as many as 16 Chief District Medical Officers since 2000. This throws enough light on the way in which the health care
system in the State is run.

Many women's organisations have accused the Nayagarh police of laxity. &quot;The foetuses were removed from the spot with police connivance,&quot; alleged Tapasi
Praharaj of the Orissa unit of the All India Democratic Women's Association (AIDWA) after a visit to Nayagarh.

The accusations seem to have some basis. The police showed little interest in the case after the foetuses were found. The administration also did not take
any action until more infant body parts were retrieved from another waste-dumping pit in the town. Raids on nursing homes and ultrasound clinics began
in earnest only then.

An independent fact-finding team from Bhubaneswar, comprising social activists and office-bearers of various child rights organisations, visited the Duburi
hills site on July 16. It submitted a report to the government and demanded a Crime Branch probe.

On July 21, the government ordered a Crime Branch inquiry into the case pertaining to the discovery of the seven foetuses at Duburi hills. The Crime Branch
took over the case on July 22. However, neither the missing female foetuses nor those who destroyed the evidence could be traced.

The detection of the second pit led to the arrest of seven persons who managed nursing homes and ultrasound clinics in Nayagarh. The police said that more
arrests were likely. Many of those running the clinics were untraceable.

The State Health Department has sealed all the eight nursing homes and five ultrasound clinics in Nayagarh. Investigations revealed that seven of the nursing
homes did not have the licence to operate. The ultrasound clinics were running without official approval.

Several of the nursing homes have questionable records. One of them, with ultrasound facility, was run by a woman who studied homoeopathy. She is absconding.
Another nursing home, adjacent to the district headquarters hospital, was operating even though its owners had informed the district health officials long
ago that they were winding it up.

Local residents are convinced about the involvement of government doctors in the sex determination and female foeticide cases. While Dr. Sahu had his last
posting at Bolagarh, about 25 km away from Nayagarh, several doctors posted at the district headquarters hospital were rendering their services at nursing
homes in the town.

According to a government doctor, most of the private nursing homes and ultrasound clinics in the small town had sprung up in the past six years. The authorities
also knew that sex determination and termination of pregnancies were conducted in the clinics.

According to Dr. B. Sukla of the district headquarters hospital, the then Chief District Medical Officer of Nayagarh, Dr. A.K. Das, had written to the State
Health Department and other authorities in 2005 informing them about these activities. But no action was initiated.

Fake drugs racket

Meanwhile, a massive fake medicine manufacturing and marketing racket was unearthed at Kantabanjhi town in Bolangir district on July 20. Four persons, including
a doctor, were arrested even as medical shop owners in several towns dumped large quantities of fake drugs into rivers, canals and nullahs.

An unnerved Chief Minister, Naveen Patnaik, who had already ordered a Crime Branch probe into the female foeticide cases, ordered a similar probe into the
fake drug racket. As criticism started coming from various quarters and the Centre sought a report on female foeticide cases, the State government on July
25 announced that separate task forces would be created at the district level to control the fake medicine menace and the problem of female foeticide.
A four-member monitoring committee headed by the Chief Secretary would be formed to oversee the functioning of the task forces, the government said.

However, Opposition parties and women's organisations are not satisfied with the action taken in the two cases. Many political parties demanded that heads
should roll in the police, the administration and the Health Department. The Congress demanded that Health Minister Duryodhan Majhi should step down.

Women's organisations, which have been raising for long the issue of falling child sex ratio in the State, particularly in the coastal districts, are up
in arms. &quot;Those in the government only know how to shift responsibility. The Women and Child Development Department says that it was the duty of the Health
Department to implement the Pre-Natal Diagnostic Technique Act. Moreover, nobody in the government seemed ready to talk about the unborn child,&quot; said Bisakha
Bhanja of the National Alliance of Women's Organisations.

Asha Hans of Sanskriti blamed the State for ignoring requests to deal with the issue of the declining child sex ratio. The 2001 Census data presented an
alarming picture of the child sex ratio in the State.

Curious visitors to the spot of the pit, now sealed, where aborted foetuses were seized by the police.

There had been a decline of 17 points, from 967 in 1991 to 950 in 2001, she said. Not surprisingly, Nayagarh had the lowest child sex ratio - 901. Female
foeticide and a skewed gender ratio were more prevalent in the urban areas of the State.

&quot;The Nayagarh female foeticide case is only the tip of the iceberg,&quot; said Tapasi Praharaj. &quot;Female foeticide is prevalent in almost all districts of Orissa.
Those involved in female foeticide and the authorities who support them should be punished immediately; all government departments concerned should work
in coordination to check the menace,&quot; she said.

The women activists lamented that the preference for the male child was growing in Orissa. They said that the two-child norm for those who wanted to get
elected to panchayati raj institutions in Orissa had made people in rural areas opt for gender-selective abortion.

National Commission for Women member Manju Hembram, who headed the Commission's three-member team to Nayagarh, expressed shock over the manner in which
female foeticide had been committed there. She blamed it on the administration's failure to implement the Pre-Natal Diagnostic Technique Act.

With the Nayagarh female foeticide case bringing the crime against unborn girl children to the fore, there is unanimity in the belief that the practice
is prevalent in other parts of the State as well. There is a demand for a Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) probe into the whole episode.

Many people feel that the mere formation of task forces by the government will not help curb female foeticide. Action against errant private clinics and
diagnostic centres and an aggressive campaign against female foeticide and the decreasing sex ratio are necessary to deal with the challenge.

THE STATES

Battle cry

R. KRISHNAKUMAR
in Kottayam

The government's attempts to prevent commercialisation of education touch a raw nerve among leaders of the Catholic Church.

S. MAHINSHA

A protest on July 22 by members of the Latin Catholic community, in front of St. Annes Church at Valiathope in Thiruvananthapuram, against the pastoral
letter issued by Bishop Soosapakiam of the Thiruvananthapuram diocese.

LEADERS of the powerful Catholic Church in Kerala are up in arms once again over what they describe as the &quot;anti-minority&quot; provisions in the education policy
of the communist-led government in the State. They have warned the government that if the offending provisions are not withdrawn, the Church, which runs
the largest number of educational institutions in the private sector, will not hesitate even to re-enact the role it played in the &quot;Liberation Struggle&quot;
of the late 1950s.

In 1957, an opportunistic coalition of established religious, social and political forces felt threatened by the progressive educational and agrarian reforms
implemented by the first elected Communist Ministry and eventually engineered its dismissal by the Congress government at the Centre in 1959. &quot;Theoretically,
they [the communists] are against religion. They believe religion is the opium of the people. According to Marxist theory, religions are stumbling blocks
to development.. The claim of political parties that they are protecting minority rights has to be tested in practical terms. In Kerala, our experience
in 1957 and now is that they have worked against our educational interests,&quot; Archbishop Mar Joseph Powathil, chairman of the Inter-Church Council for Education,
told Frontline.

Pastoral letters were read out in many parishes under the Syro-Malabar Church (the larger of the two Oriental churches, which, along with the Latin Church,
form the Catholic community in Kerala) exhorting its members to form &quot;vigilance squads&quot; and organise protest marches against the Left Democratic Front
(LDF) government's policies that went against &quot;minority interests&quot; in the education sector.

The Church's campaign began on July 8 when the Syro-Malabar Archbishop of Thrissur, Andrew Thazhath, said at a &quot;Minority Rights Protection Convention&quot; that
if the government continued &quot;its attack&quot; on Christian educational institutions, the Church would not hesitate to think about a &quot;liberation struggle&quot; yet
again.

The reference was to the Communist Party of India (Marxist)-led LDF government's policies aimed at preventing profiteering and commercialisation in the
self-financing professional education sector. These practices had become the norm in the State ever since many of the managements of self-financing institutions
reneged on their promise, made in 2001 (to a Congress(I)-led government), of setting apart 50 per cent of the seats for students from the government merit
list in return for sanction to establish self-financing institutions.

Seizing the opportunity

In Kerala, Christians traditionally have been in the forefront of spreading educational opportunities, a consequence of early missionary activity in the
region. Perhaps, as a result, the community surged ahead of others in the economic and social sectors too. The majority of aided schools, too, have been
established under Christian managements. It was natural that church managements seized the opportunity offered by the United Democratic Front (UDF) government
in 2001 when it opened the doors to self-financing professional educational institutions.

Consequently, most of the post-2001 self-financing colleges were established by the Church or members of the Christian community, which constitutes 19 per
cent of the population, and to a lesser extent by Muslims, who constitute 24 per cent of the population.

Today, in the self-financing sector in the State, 36 of the 49 engineering colleges, six of the nine medical colleges and the majority of colleges offering
courses in branches such as dentistry, pharmacy, nursing, teacher training, Ayurveda and homoeopathy are run by minority managements.

Their minority status offered the managements of these institutions the scope to seek additional protection under the Constitution by claiming to be &quot;minority
professional college or institution&quot; and escape attempts by the government to rein them in when some of them strayed into profiteering and exploitation
of students. Article 30(1) of the Constitution guarantees minorities the right to &quot;establish and administer&quot; educational institutions &quot;of their choice&quot;.

Soon after it came to power in May 2006, the LDF government introduced the Kerala Professional Colleges or Institutions (Prohibition of Capitation Fee,
Regulation of Admission and Fixation of Non-exploitative Fee and Other Measures to Ensure Equity and Excellence in Professional Education) Act. However,
in January 2007 the High Court struck down many of the provisions of this law and the State government's appeal in the Supreme Court for a stay was denied
in May.

The Constitution does not explain the term minority and from various court rulings interpreting Article 30(1) it had come to mean that in order to claim
minority status for an institution, a community needs to show only that (a) it is a religious or linguistic minority and (b) that the institution was &quot;established
and is administered&quot; by it (the words established and administered having to be read conjunctively). (Article 30(1) says, &quot;All minorities, whether based
on religion or language, shall have the right to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice.&quot;)

The minorities (especially Christians) were all along in the forefront of expanding educational opportunities in the State and until the advent of the grand
profiteering opportunities in self-financing, no one had really bothered about claiming &quot;minority status&quot; for their institutions. All that changed in 2001
when they realised that claiming minority status was a sure-fire way of guarding against government intervention in a self-financing institution, even
when it indulged in shameless profit-making through the sale of professional education.

Therefore, as Education Minister M.A. Baby explained then, the government, stung repeatedly by the runaway court victories of profit-seeking managements,
decided that there ought to be a clear distinction between the rights of &quot;minority communities to establish and run institutions of their choice&quot; and &quot;an
institution run by such a community getting minority status&quot;.

Therefore, the new law set forth three conditions of &quot;demographic equivalence&quot; between &quot;the minority community to which the college or institution belonged&quot;
and &quot;the non-minority community of the State taken as a single unit&quot; to decide &quot;minority status&quot; of professional colleges.

They included, one, that the population of the &quot;linguistic or religious&quot; minority that runs the college should be less than 50 per cent of the total population
of the State; two, that the number of professional colleges or institutions run by the minority community (to which the college seeking minority status
belongs) should be proportionately smaller than the number of professional colleges run by the non-minority community in the State; and, three, that the
number of students belonging to that particular minority community in all professional colleges in the State should be smaller than the number of students
belonging to the non-minority community studying in all professional colleges in the State.

Matters of concern

Archbishop Powathil said it was a matter of concern that despite the High Court striking down several provisions of the Act, the government had decided
to pursue the case in the Supreme Court and that some of the provisions had the effect of denying minority status to all professional colleges run by minorities,
of denying the minorities their constitutionally guaranteed right of &quot;conserving the culture attached to their religion&quot;, and the right to &quot;establish and
administer educational institutions of their choice&quot;.

A second important concern of the Church leaders was that despite the courts repeatedly denying the government's arguments in a series of cases against
the managements, the government was forcing the managements into a mutual agreement through which they would have to set apart 50 per cent of the seats
in their colleges as government seats and implement a fee structure that has higher fees for management quota seats and lower fees for government quota
seats.

Church leaders said if they agreed to this, it would be tantamount to surrendering &quot;forever&quot; their constitutionally guaranteed right to admission to all
the seats and imposing on students of the minority community the burden of educating &quot;rich students&quot; admitted under the government quota.

All court verdicts so far had declared such &quot;cross subsidy&quot; and two types of fees as illegal. The pastoral letters read out in many parishes declare that
this is an obvious pressure tactic on the part of the LDF government &quot;to squeeze the Christian community financially and destroy it&quot;.

Church leaders said they were also worried that the government was trying to &quot;encroach politically&quot; into the school education sector, where the community
had a leading presence. Many bishops had expressed concern at the proposed school curriculum reforms, the possible introduction of an &quot;atheist agenda&quot;,
the proposals to involve local bodies in the running of schools and to entrust the appointment of teachers (including in aided Church-run institutions)
to the Public Service Commission, and so on.

Powathil said: &quot;The intentions of the government in the school sector is indeed a major concern. Communist ideology is like that. They have to control everything,
only then will the system run well. That is their idea. Everything should be under party control, including the curriculum.&quot;

In a Sunday circular read out at the parishes under the Kanjirappally diocese, Bishop Mar Mathew Arakkal said the government was trying to &quot;impose its suzerainty
over all institutions run by the Church, not just the schools and colleges alone. Efforts are on to interfere in the day-to-day affairs of aided schools
run by the Church. The Catholic Church has the wisdom to understand the deceit and the ill-intention of a government that forgets the fall in standards
in its own schools but seeks to interfere in private schools that are running well. No move that would deny us our right to appoint teachers is acceptable
to us.&quot;

&quot;Merit, the basis&quot;

On July 23, even as the first conciliatory gestures were being made, Chief Minister V.S. Achuthanandan said in Thiruvananthapuram, while inaugurating a
programme to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the first Communist Ministry, that Church leaders should not try to whitewash commercialisation of education
with threats and propaganda meant to create misunderstanding. He reiterated that the government policy was that social justice and merit should be the
basis for admission in self-financing colleges and that its policy had gained wide acceptance among the people. But the government was ready to address
any genuine grievance of the minorities, he said, and cautioned community leaders against inflaming passions as this could lead to a dangerous situation
in the State.

The church's sudden call to believers to organise themselves against the government has come, surprisingly, at a moment of quiet triumph for it, soon after
it had won almost all the legal battles on the issues of self-financing institutions and minority rights. Also, the government's initiatives to improve
school education should not have caused such over-reaction, according to LDF leaders.

There were some immediate provocations, perhaps. One was the disruption of a separate entrance examination conducted by a few minority medical college managements
by activists of the Student Federation of India (SFI), the CPI(M)'s student wing. Another was the proposal of CPI(M)-controlled universities to cancel
the affiliation granted to colleges that did not reserve 50 per cent seats for students from the government merit list. Church leaders also said the reactions
of some leaders of the ruling party and student organisations only heightened their concerns.

But in the three weeks since the July 8 call made by the Archbishop of Thrissur, pastoral letters have been read out widely, several publications have reproduced
the contents of the church circulars, church committees have been set up in most districts to mobilise believers, and there have been reports of a plan
by the Church to mobilise and train a &quot;protection army&quot;.

The reasons for the Church leaders going on an overdrive would perhaps be known fully only later. It is indeed a game of wits and threats that Kerala is
witnessing, with the government trying (so far unsuccessfully) to include the principles of equity and social justice in admissions to self-financing professional
colleges and the church seeking shelter under minority rights and court orders after brushing aside as illegal the original understanding it had with the
government.

Divisions within Church

K.K. NAJEEB

A youth rally organised by the Catholic Church in Thrissur on July 21 to protect &quot;fundamental rights&quot;.

But even as the Catholic Church launches an emphatic campaign against the government, it is being forced to face some hard truths from within. Joseph Pulikkunnel,
director of the Kottayam-based Indian Institute of Christian Studies, who has long been campaigning for democracy within the Catholic Church, told Frontline:

&quot;The current struggle of the Catholic Church has to be understood in the proper historical perspective. At the time of the first Liberation Struggle in
1959, local parishes owned the Catholic educational institutions in a locality.

The Liberation Struggle of 1959 was an unfortunate event in history that was triggered by creating an impression that the first Communist government may
interfere beyond limits in such institutions built up over the years with the sweat and money of the common believers. The community as a whole was concerned
about government interference in their schools and colleges.

&quot;But after 1959, dramatic changes happened in our educational sector. Educational institutions that were once the property of local parishioners came under
the Church's corporate control and literally became the property of priests. Under the Canon laws that came into being in the early 1990s, ignoring the
tradition of Catholics of Kerala, priests were made the sole owners of churches and church property.

&quot;Catholic educational institutions today are governed by a minority of priests within the Catholic community who, no doubt, accept money for appointments
and admissions. The Catholic community should first examine the circumstances that have led to such corruption before taking up arms for yet another liberation
struggle.&quot;

On July 19, in a statement, 12 prominent members of the Catholic laity, including Joseph Pulikkunnel, former Vice-Chancellor of the University of Cochin

M.V. Paily, professor and writer P.T. Chacko, and former Ministers K.J. Chacko and N.M. Joseph, pointed out that Catholic educational institutions were
being run today under the protection granted by Article 30. But the fundamental right to establish and administer educational institutions under this Article
is a right granted to the minority &quot;community&quot; as a whole and not to individuals in that community, they said.

The way the educational institutions were brought under the administration of priests, without any participation from the laity, is therefore against the
aims envisaged in the Constitution and is the basic reason for &quot;the corruption and favouritism&quot; that have seeped into Catholic educational institutions
in general, though there are some exceptions, they added.

&quot;It is therefore natural in a civil society that legal measures are initiated when corruption and favouritism are as rampant as [they are] in the Catholic
educational sector. The statements that pastoral letters and protection armies would be organised against the government move is not a permanent solution
to the real problem and would only lead to a long-drawn crisis in society,&quot; they said.
