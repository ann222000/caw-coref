Semi-delurk. My idea, but co-written with a guy's editing and
insertion participation, we're kindda doing this to get off:... which is
why we concur this may be sloppy, but we're in a bit of a hurry... wink
wink. It's like "fuck it! Hit post, just hit fucking post! Now you go
upstairs to the bathroom, young lady, and go fetch the fat wooden
haribrush. Then take off your jeans and your panties, girl. Put the
brush on the bed. Stand legs apart, hands over your head, and wait for
me to come up to lecture and punish you" Mmmmmm, ugh! Soaking pussy,
raging dick... brevity is the soul of ...what???

So, does anyone else just adore the word "naughty"? And a propos of
our introductory parragraph... does anyone else love the word
"incretion"? : )

I've always thought of myself as being a dirty little girl. Somewhat
by choice : ) Age (I'm now 28), experience, great friends and
university have shown me a different, healthier perspective. But
there's just something extra forbidden-fruit about being sexually
enthralled by being spanked and punished by the opposite gender. Peers
especially! From an early age it takes you to convoluted places in
your mind. To the point I confused myself no end when I was younger,
not just with my fantasies, but with things that happened as they
happened.

I don't know if I have the equivalent of the "sex-bunny schoolgirl"
look about me that screams "bare and spank my impudent little ass very
hard and flaming red, then fuck me up a cloud"... If that's what it is
that I got, I'm a very lucky girl! Cause that's how it's worked out
(the fuck me silly part began when I was 15 abouts), my intentions,
desires and needs not one bit withstanding.

My guy wants to kill me right now, cause it's the polar opposite to
his experience, and he's not at all happy about his dearth of past
opportunities in this arena, let alone experiences. Lucky for him I
came around, huh? You're delighted now, aren't ya? I just pulled up my
hem, I'm not wearing anything underneath : )  ... You were saying?
"Blah, buah, bruah..." What? :Quit blathering! : )  God, I love doing
that!!! Every single time...  like fucking clockwork! Now he's pissed at
me for writing this, I guess I'm in for it now... : ) I'm really really
sorry honey. You know I didn't mean it :  D   ...Much .

Guy replies: "Totally sated. You're absolutely awesome! Not a
microsecond is ever boring with you, and I think of you all the time!
Every minute! The slightest hint of the memory that your gorgeous butt
actually exists for me makes me rock hard! Imagine what I feel knowing
you're my girl! When I want need you, most of the time anyway... And
it's OK that we're working this out... you're always hair-trigger there
for me sexually... and I know that's huge with you. To me that's just
the icing. You, you unbelievably gorgeous sulputral imp, it's not even
that about you.. . Your mind intoxicates me! I'm jealous and bothered,
but given the givens, allowing for you to be you only makes everything
hotter!!! I've never been so happy!.

Me now again, and that unbalances my writing rhythm badly... moisture.
wet spot, desire, heat! My butt needs burning ... Hang on, we should do
this... how much fun have we gotten from others' posts? I was on a
fucking roll here... shit! Now why did yo go do that to me? Anyway,.
aside from horny dog here...

I've seen it in so many guys' faces... it's great to be a girl!!! We can
play you guys like Yo Yo Ma plays the fucking violoncello : ) And we
get to sit back and melt away at the virtuosity we've just induced,
while you guys detonate all over us in a poem of expression. Got to
really hand it to y'guys! Mmmm, wow! Fucking Mmmm! Fucking WOW! Ahhh,
yeah, right fucking THERE! If only more of you weren't either fucking
gutless or cluless...I'm presently being lectured that part of that is
tacitly a bit our fault as a gender -- and don't get me wrong!
Boundaries are definitely necessary and desirable! Fun as it may be
sometimes to fuck with them... : D  Did I mention I'm a very, very
naughty, bad girl? Anyway that's a multi-threaded discussion for
another day.

Contemporary pop culture is like an owner's manual to y' guys. They've
isolated the prototypical stuff that will glue your attention (or
created new memes to accomplish just that); not only in advertising.
Teasing men seems to be the popular sport of choice in 2007 where we
live, and I am proudly in contention for our World Cup team! I work it
all out in front of them all the time. Damn it's good to be a girl!
The subtlest thing will trigger you guys to delusion : ) Sitting down
prettily, or carelessly letting your skirt ride up a bit and WHAM!
Their pupils dilate the size of grapes and their pants tent! That's so
incredibly fucking fun! Three cheers for testosterone! Hip hip...: D

Yes guys, we are quite aware all the time of what we're doing to ya.
Especially when we're not supposed to : ) Can you think of a better
reason to de-panty us and spank us red,  hot and compliant? Oh... for
the luvva! C'mon! Yes, that's a good enough provocation! Go for it
when we come back to your place, you fucking wuss! Jeez! What do I
gotto do here? Bend over the fucking restaurant table, hike up my
skirt, pull down my panties and spread them right here and now in
front of everybody??? Do I need to hand you a wooden cooking spoon on
top of it for you to get the fucking idea?

Hmmm, I'd look mega-cute and completely submissive doing that... huh?
File that one for later : )  ...Oh, I'm just saying...

You don't notice me here gingerly rubbing my thighs together under the
table over my salad while I play and fuck with you, now do you? Girls.
We're perverse : ) You have no fucking clue!!! And not an attractive
woman alive can gainsay me on that one. Then again, hubris and
presumption are spankable offenses, aren't they : D  I guess I've been
bad...You there, with the green eyes and the pecs... "I've been a bad
girl..." : D  Do any other women reading this go "My Kingdom for a lap
and a heavy hand!" all the time too? Queendom, I guess... whatever : )

I used to debate whether it was hotter to get spanked by a "hunk" you
simply drove batty, or a guy who is into spanking. Debate over, case
fucking closed! Hands down, the guy who's into it! Who is into the
subtleties and will always juice the situation to its max!  The one
who's got you rubbing your thighs and trying to cum well before you've
even lowered your panties. And who's bugging eyes in that exquisite
submissive and compliant moment say it all!

Did I mention? It's good to be a girl! It's even better to be a very
naughty little cock-tease : ) I'm one of those "my body is a temple"
people. My friend's laughing cause I drink like a fish and smoke dope
occasionally... But I run in this body and exulate. I rock-climb. I spin
and dance down the beach like Sarah Jessica Parker in L.A. Story : )
But never am I so aware of how my being bends the fabric of reality
for someone else as when I see those pupils explode, or when self
disappears during the heat of punishment and it's all linked between
myself and him in every blatant instant, every unexpected nuance. Oh,
by the way, I'm a bit into spanking. Just a bit : ) What gave me away?

The guy who knows when to initiate! And then where to spank you when
-- how hard and how fast, just off your body language, way before your
mind registers, leading to a cascade of insistent ecstasy! And then,
he takes you just beyond your perimeter... where even the stars don't
shine like you do right now, y'know? Before you even realize what you
need, it's happening! And then it's happening some more...and more and
uuuuuuhhghh! And it's still happening!!! And more!!! And more!!! And
uuuuuhhghh!... Then you're somehow quietly sobbing and all is right
with the world and his exquisite hand is lovingly caressing your
throbbing butt, and you know sometime soon he's going to be inside
you, and you'll be screaming an entirely different chord, in just a
bit. A fucking chorius on Presto Vivace!!!

There's this song by "The Bears"... "Fear is Never Boring"... y'know?
Boyfriend here's a huge Terry Bozzio fan.... he's a drimmer (I know,
officially huge points against, but he's really good at it! Jazz-
fusion kindda good! Bending space and time,  and spicing it to his
will kindda good... The word mastery comes to mind...) he's grinning like
Kermitt or John Denver : )

I've got a huge problem now. Sudden abundance can also be a terrible
curse. I've met 3 guys like that recently (one is your co-author), at
long fucking last! But there are 3 of them!!! Why all at once? Now?
I've been on and off starving for this for fucking ever, and NOW life
hands me 700 sirloin steaks, 60 lbs of lobster, and no fucking
freezer? WTF???   ...I should be ecstatic... I really should. I feel
ungrateful because I don't even know how to begin to choose. What
sucks worse? Paucity or choice excess? Subjectively right now, I can't
tell.

It's killing me to make a choice! They're all so awesomely unique!
Right now, I'm more inclined not to and just letting it ride... (co-
author concurs). Did I mention I'm a bad girl and that I need to be
punished?  : D  Yeah, I know, it's 2007 and Women's Lib and all... yadda
fucking yadda... y'know? I've still got that Cinderella meme floating
around strong...it's... enticing, and very annoyingly ineludible. Fuck!
At least my co-author knows all about what's going on with me and is
tenderly and actively supportive when he's not tanning my little bare
buns... big points for...right? He hugs me too and tells me he'll go along
with whatever I do cause he loves me... Why the fuck are you being so
fucking sweet!!!??? It doesn't help, you know... He wants to ask if even
women understand themselves... no comment...

Thanks for reading this guys!

PS
I'm a sucky correspondent. I think I need to be spanked : D  I'm ditzy
enough not to keep up with this thread even after we've released the
theoretical hounds (I've seen threads explode sometimes). I'd like to,
and. I'd therefore like to make a request. If y' girls or guys post
back, send me a CC to my co-author beau's email at valinorrim-
span ... @yahoo.com.mx. He'll make it a point that I read them... or else
I'm in serious trouble : )  You go figure if that means I'll read you
or not...
