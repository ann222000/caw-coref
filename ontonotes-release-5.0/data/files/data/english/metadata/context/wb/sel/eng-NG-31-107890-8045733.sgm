What locally available varnish might equal the material used for dipping

This is the stuff!

Just inject it, using a syringe, at the core of the windings.

There is none. Transformers are impregnated with a Vacuum varnishing
technique and the 'varnish' is heat polymerized. It has no solvents in
it, it is simply thin by it's formulation and once it is drawn into
the voids by vacuum, it is baked to cause it to polymerize and
solidify.
A friend tried what you want to do using a varithane but the
transformer was still trash. About 6 years later I needed the
laminations for another project so I dismantled the transformer and
the varithane was still liquid inside the core and coils!

Any decent motor shop should be able to vacuum varnish it for you for
a case of beer.

Hi,
I agree with Neil. Red glyptal is good for sealing adjusting
screws, but it may not set up in spaces away from air.  And I don't
think it will penetrate transformer laminations.

When I worked in a motor shop, we had a tank of varnish for dipping
motor stators, which were left to drain and then baked overnight to
set the varnish.  It did have some solvents in it, as we occasionally
had to add more to keep it thin.  But it didn't have enough solvent to
leave voids when it cured.

Maybe I'm just lazy &amp; lucky. Years ago, I quieted a buzzing transformer on a
Hallicrafters S-40B by loosening the bolts, brushing with ordinary varnish a
couple of times, waiting a while, tightening back up, then baking with a
lamp overnight.

Your mileage may vary :-)

Paul,

I have three Telefunken Opus 7's (daily drivers in two dental offices) that
aren't buzzing anymore by this technique!

The product is designed to cure in nooks and crannies.

I usually take the transformer, inject to the core, and slowly variac the
transformer with no load for a few a half a minute,  wait over night for the
varnish to cure , and then the transformer is ready for use.

If you guys are into esoteric BS to get your transformer not to buzz or hum,
that's great, but what is the feasibility of finding a place with a &quot;vacuum
device&quot; for this type application?

We're talking about resuscitating a power transformer.

Who's spamming?

Certainly not you Hagster(seriously)!

Back to transformers,  is there anybody else out there with a homebrew

Ah....Bill, sprayed individually?

The idea behind potting a transformer, or vacuum impregnating it
is to physically seal (lock) all the individual laminations to
one another to keep them from vibrating.

And Omer's right about using GC Glyptol varnish. It will cure fully.

The point behind using a vacuum chamber is to suck all the bubbles
out of the varnish (or other potting material.) In the case of a
re-work job on an old transformer, it usually only takes a well
placed bit of glyptol to quiet it down since most of the original
varnish is intact.

Bill, what I suggest is after you've reassembled all the laminations,
recoat them again with more varnish or what ever material it is that
you've sprayed them with. Brush it on thinned and let it soak in.

Some basic comments on transformer design.

Lamination are used to reduce eddy currents. A large single piece of
metal will have circulating currents in the core. Using several thin
pieces will  cut down the eddy currents and similiarly reduce the
losses (due to inneficiencies) in the core.

However, since each lamination is small, and has opposing magnetic
current flowing in it, it will act like a buzzer. This is the sound
you hear when the laminations are loose. Coating the lamination in
varnish (or another material) will make the core act as a single
large piece, rather than several small pieces that interact with each
other physically.

Note: On a buzzy transformer, no amount of beating or hammering on it
is going to quiet it down, the laminations only get further deformed
and make even more noise than previously. Just like over tightening a
valve cover on an engine, once you warp it enough to not have a
straight edge, no amount of further tightening it is going to make it
stop leaking.

Jeff,

Thank you for the detailed information on this topic.

Transformer buzzing is a problem that afflicts many radios we would like to
restore , with unobtanium power transformers.

If  alternator repair shops have a varnish dunking vat, perhaps that could
be a choice too.

Omer

BTW Hagster, I hear that you are the resident wood and cabinet restoration

I once worked at a place that bought a can of Glyptal.  I don't remember the
size but it may have been a gallon.  Anyway, for more convenient use, we put
some in a baby food jar.  After a number of people had used it for a while
(and not wiped the rim), I tried to use it.  I couldn't get the lid off with
my hands so I tried a large pair of pliers.  I held the jar in one hand and
the pliers in the other and twisted with all my might.  The lid still didn't
come off but I twisted the top of the jar off!  Cut myself on the broken
glass.  They sent me to a clinic to get checked out and the nurse
immediately got some wet gauze to wipe the blood off.  That didn't take
long, of course, but she kept on wiping trying to get the now dried Glyptal
off.  It was a perfect match.  When I realized what she was doing I stopped
her and explained the confusion.  (I wasn't seriously injured.)
