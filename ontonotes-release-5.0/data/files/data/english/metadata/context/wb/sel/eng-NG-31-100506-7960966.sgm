It's a first: Detroit 3 market share dips below 50%
http://www.autonews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070801/REG/30801...

For U.S. automakers, July was the darkest month in the 102-year history
of the automobile business in the United States.

For the first time, foreign manufacturers controlled the market. The
import-badged cars and trucks captured 51.9 percent of the market,
leaving only 48.1 percent for the domestic brands of General Motors,
Ford Motor Co. and the Chrysler group. A year ago, the domestics had
52.0 percent of the July market.

In raw numbers, the score was: Imports, 679,523; Detroit 3, 629,569. The
domestic brands still hold the lead for the year to date. Seven-month
market shares were 51.4 percent for the Detroit 3 domestics and 48.6
percent for the import-badged brands.

Still, sales weren't great for the imports, either. Auto sales wilted
for just about everybody in July. For the month, total sales fell 12.4
percent.

Withered by high fuel prices and blistered by consumers strapped for
cash because of rising mortgage rates, five of the big six automakers
lost ground in July. Only Nissan eked out a small gain.

Not even Toyota Motor Sales U.S.A. Inc. and American Honda Motor Co.,
which seem to always prosper in good times and bad, could buck the July
drought. Both jacked up their incentive spending, but suffered sales
declines anyway.

As usual, the news was the worst for the Detroit 3:

* General Motors: down 22.3 percent
* Ford Motor Co.: down 19.2 percent
* the Chrysler group: down 8.4 percent

GM said it sold 315,870 vehicles in July, down from 406,298 in July
2006. Ford delivered 194,092 vehicles in July, compared with 240,104
last year. The Chrysler group sold 137,728 vehicles in July, down from
150,349 a year ago.

Toyota was off 3.5 percent from a year ago, while Honda's sales fell 3.2
percent. But the results might have been much worse had it not been for
incentives, which were way up for both automakers in July.

&quot;We are seeing combined incentive spending for Japanese automakers reach
record highs,&quot; said Jesse Toprak, executive director for industry
analysis for Edmunds.com, an industry research firm.

Record incentives

In July, Toyota's average incentive spending per vehicle totaled $1,492,
up nearly 50 percent from July 2006. Honda, which typically shies away
from cash payouts, spent an average of $1,146 per vehicle on incentives,
up nearly 30 percent from a year ago. Nissan's July incentives of $2,290
per vehicle topped the Asian automakers but were down about 12 percent
from a year ago.

Still, the Detroit 3 led the league in givebacks in July by a wide
margin. The Chrysler group averaged $4,082 per vehicle, up from $2,623 a
year ago. Ford's average of $2,984, was down sharply from $3,888 in July
2006 and was best among the Detroit 3. GM, with an average of $3,130,
was down nearly 20 percent over a year ago.

Ford sales analyst George Pipas said declines in both daily rental fleet
and retail sales contributed to the big drop.

&quot;Obviously, the magnitude of the decline in July is fairly substantial,&quot;
Pipas said.

He said softer industry sales are a concern, but Ford will stick with
its plans rather than unilaterally lowering prices to spike consumer
interest.

&quot;Sometimes you just take your medicine and get on with it,&quot; Pipas said.

August doesn't look sunny

GM had almost no bright spots, and no indication that August will be any
better than July. With the exception of the Saturn Aura, Pontiac
Solstice and Cadillac DTS, sales of all of GM's car lines were down. For
GM's bread-and-butter pickups, the Chevrolet Silverado fell 26.5
percent, and the GMC Sierra was off 28 percent.

Only GM's new trio of mid-sized crossovers, the Saturn Outlook, GMC
Acadia and Buick Enclave, had any traction in July. Combined, the three
stylish crossovers sold 12,080. The sales are encouraging for GM because
the crossovers are moving off showroom floors despite low incentives,
and production is just now ramping up.

Paul Ballew, GM's executive director of market and industry analysis,
said, &quot;We didn't have a terrific retail month for sure, but it's better
than June.&quot;

Rethinking 2007 forecast

Ford said it will reassess its forecast for industry-wide U.S. sales in
2007, given the sharp drop in July sales. Ford's current industry
forecast is at 16.8 million vehicles.

&quot;We think something in this range is feasible in light of these consumer
fundamentals and the overall pace of the economy,&quot; said Ellen
Hughes-Cromwick, Ford's chief economist. &quot;But we are certainly going to
reassess this once we get the final data for the July sales.&quot;

Ballew said he expects the industry to end 2007 with sales of 16.6
million to 16.7 million vehicles. He said a weak housing market and high
fuel prices would weigh on U.S. vehicle sales through the remainder of
2007 and into 2008.

&quot;The twinfold headwinds of gas prices and housing are clearly having an
impact on the business,&quot; Ballew said on a conference call with analysts
and reporters.

Ballew said GM would be more aggressive on incentive spending over the
remainder of the year, in response to heavy discounting from
competitors, particularly on pickup trucks.

&quot;We are not going to let the competition run that far down in front of
us as they did in June,&quot; Ballew said. &quot;They've been extremely aggressive
... and we can't allow competition to discount to that extent without
evaluating some response,&quot; he said, referring to the pickup truck category.

As the incentive war heats up, Ballew said pickup sales would recover
slightly through the rest of the year.

&quot;We believe full-size pickups will show some recovery given the amount
of emphasis from vehicle manufacturers,&quot; he said. Ballew also said he
expected the industry challenges to impact the truck-based SUV and
mid-size van segments the most.

Meanwhile, Toyota said consumer incentives on its new Tundra pickup
truck in the United States would be lower this month.

The Japanese automaker declined to specify the exact rebate on the
pickup truck, but said it was lower than reported.

Industry-tracking firm www.Edmunds.com estimates that the Tundra carries
incentives worth $6,861 on average, the highest of any full-size pickup
truck.

Sales of the revamped Tundra more than doubled in July from a year earlier.

&gt; If you were head of GM, Mike, what would be your first move to try to
&gt; reverse this business  trend?
">

Hard to say which would be my first move.  Among the competing ideas would
be the following:

- Take immediate steps to up quality.  GM (not unlike other manufacturers),
has too many lingering issues that are simple quality issues.  In this area
I believe I'd put more decision authority back into the hands of engineering
and take that authority from the pens of bean counters.  Not recklessly, but
I do believe GM went too far in giving bean counters control over vehicle
design.

- Cut the bleed.  I'd drop some products and bolster others.  I'd quit
throwing the car of the week on the table, from Australia, etc. and
concentrate on dropping lines that are redundant, or that overlap too much.
Quality would also help stem the bleed by cutting warranty costs.

- I'd leverage the survival instinct of people and re-write the union
contracts from scratch, immediately.

- I'd throw more money at advanced technologies in the name of doubling the
mileage throughout the entire fleet.

- I'd thin the executive ranks and generally streamline the organization.

- I'd put power back into the hands of the division leaders, but I'd require
strong business cases for their designs.

- I'd institute some kind of loyalty program to acknowledge and regain the
lost customers who abandoned GM over such issues as the intake gaskets, etc.

- I'd simply throw out the entire customer care program and start from
scratch.  The current one is so bungled and vested in camouflaged
protections of GM that it cannot be revived.  I'd steal away key leaders
from the competition (Honda would be a good target), and put them in charge
of a complete re-design of customer care.

- I'd publish a road map for the re-design of the corporation.  Sword in the
ground and all that.  For there to be true consumer confidence and hope,
there has to be open disclosure and no more of the typical &quot;we're going
remake ourselves&quot; rhetoric which is only met with the same frustrations when
customers try to experience a new GM.

I believe that most of the consumer population would like to believe in a
new GM, but has heard too many promises which only resulted in the same way
of doing business.  GM lacks a credibility factor now, in my opinion, and
I'd make that one of my highest priorities.  I believe that with that
credibility factor in place, the consumer would bear with GM as it
progresses through a plan.

I'd also tell all of the analysts to go to hell.  I'm tired of the same
meaningless rhetoric from them as well.  The articles that Jim posted prove
that point.  Multiples of articles, all saying essentially the same thing,
all focused on meaningless numbers.  Meaningless in that they are numbers
that exist in the midst of an action.  It takes a long time to turn a big
boat and looking at monthly or quarterly numbers, absent a perspective
relative to the big picture is just meaningless.  That's what annoys me with
Jim's incessant posting of every article he comes across.  Inside, I scream
&quot;Big Deal!&quot;.  It's all meaningless when a company is trying to turn around.
It's even more meaningless when the entire industry is turning down.

So - although not a direct answer to your question, those are my thoughts.

From all that one would think nobody likes the service and the vehicles
currently being offered by GM, but alas is it is just one mans opinion.

In the real world the fact is more Americans apparently like the services
and the vehicles that GM has to offer better than any other manufacturer,
since Americans buy more vehicles from GM than any other manufacturer   ;)

&gt; And do a complete review of their bonuses.

&gt;&gt; - I'd put power back into the hands of the division leaders, but I'd
&gt;&gt; require strong business cases for their designs.

&gt;&gt; - I'd institute some kind of loyalty program to acknowledge and regain
&gt;&gt; the lost customers who abandoned GM over such issues as the intake
&gt;&gt; gaskets, etc.

&gt;&gt; - I'd simply throw out the entire customer care program and start from
&gt;&gt; scratch.  The current one is so bungled and vested in camouflaged
&gt;&gt; protections of GM that it cannot be revived.  I'd steal away key leaders
&gt;&gt; from the competition (Honda would be a good target), and put them in
&gt;&gt; charge of a complete re-design of customer care.

&gt;&gt; - I'd publish a road map for the re-design of the corporation.  Sword in
&gt;&gt; the ground and all that.  For there to be true consumer confidence and
&gt;&gt; hope, there has to be open disclosure and no more of the typical &quot;we're
&gt;&gt; going remake ourselves&quot; rhetoric which is only met with the same
&gt;&gt; frustrations when customers try to experience a new GM.

&gt; Rhetoric is also what's used by politicians to put us out to sleep. It's
&gt; used by all those
&gt; who have anything to sell us or to make us believe.

&gt;&gt; I believe that most of the consumer population would like to believe in a
&gt;&gt; new GM, but has heard too many promises which only resulted in the same
&gt;&gt; way of doing business.  GM lacks a credibility factor now, in my opinion,
&gt;&gt; and I'd make that one of my highest priorities.  I believe that with that
&gt;&gt; credibility factor in place, the consumer would bear with GM as it
&gt;&gt; progresses through a plan.

&gt;&gt; I'd also tell all of the analysts to go to hell.  I'm tired of the same
&gt;&gt; meaningless rhetoric from them as well.  The articles that Jim posted
&gt;&gt; prove that point.  Multiples of articles, all saying essentially the same
&gt;&gt; thing, all focused on meaningless numbers.  Meaningless in that they are
&gt;&gt; numbers that exist in the midst of an action.  It takes a long time to
&gt;&gt; turn a big boat and looking at monthly or quarterly numbers, absent a
&gt;&gt; perspective relative to the big picture is just meaningless.  That's what
&gt;&gt; annoys me with Jim's incessant posting of every article he comes across.
&gt;&gt; Inside, I scream &quot;Big Deal!&quot;.  It's all meaningless when a company is
&gt;&gt; trying to turn around. It's even more meaningless when the entire
&gt;&gt; industry is turning down.

&gt;&gt; So - although not a direct answer to your question, those are my
&gt;&gt; thoughts.

&gt; All make sens.

&gt; Cheers

&gt;&gt;&gt; get your jollies off reading them under your covers?

&gt;&gt; I find them interesting.

&gt; And you can't find them on your own? You come to a GM newsgroup to read
&gt; articles that bash GM? That makes a lot of sense. Learn how to use a search

">

I'm an old GM guy, my father won't have anything but GM and I was raised
that a Chevrolet (or a Trans Am) were the only cars worth buying.

Once GM axed the F-body we were done forever. I'm still interested in
what the company is doing and if it might be worth my time to look at
the new Camaro.

These days I have a Nissan Maxima (6 speed), which GM has no competition
for and a Infiniti G35 whose only competition is BMW, IMO.

Telling the truth about a situation that GM put themselves into isn't
*bashing*, it's just reality. I hope GM gets their heads on straight soon.

It is indeed.  I'm not sure I'd continue dropping divisions though.  At
least not in a wholesale way.  I could see dropping GMC in favor of one
strong truck line in the Chevy lineup, but I'd keep most of the other
divisions and allow the segmentation by characteristic.  Pontiac would be my
sport line, Buick my luxury line, Chevy the base line, Caddy the ultimate
line, and then eliminate cars within those lines that don't differentiate
enough between the lines.  I wouldn't have Pontiac competing with Chevy.  I
wouldn't have GMC competing with Chevy.  Ergo the demise of GMC in my plan.
Working off of the same platform would be ok, as long as the finished model
was differentiated enough from the other lines.

Nope.  Sure wouldn't.  But when faced with a total loss, even the most stout

&gt; that happen. But that's only my opinion.

Screw the oil companies.  Double the mileage and the oil companies will do a
few things.  They will diversify and produce new and maybe even different
products to keep abreast of the changing times.  Or - they will be absorbed.
New industries will arise which will loosen some of the stranglehold the oil
industry has on the world now.  Some of those oil companies are well
positioned to survive a transition with existing business units they have in
place.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Bullshit. You know as much as anyone else that posting constant negative
&gt;&gt;&gt; comments to a newsgroup is Troll behavior.

&gt;&gt; You have an odd view of negative.  He posted factual information. Factual
&gt;&gt; is neither negative nor positive.

&gt; How is a thread titled &quot;GM sales dive 19%, led by 22% drop for Chevrolet&quot;,
&gt; or &quot;It's a first: Detroit 3 market share dips below 50%&quot; positive in any
&gt; way?  Higgins hates GM. That is his right. However, Trolling a GM
&gt; newsgroup is usually against the TOS for most providers, and it really
&gt; makes him look like an ass.

I have to agree.  Jim's only purpose here seems to be heralding any bad news
he can find about American automakers.  Hardly a contribution in my opinion.

Maybe you dont like to see the figures.  It is a sad scenario, really, that
US
manufacturers have come to this point.

I think Higgins posts were simple statements of fact.  Neither positive nor
negative.

What I find really strange (or maybe I dont) is that American management has
stood by and allowed this to happen.  I dont, because I see it in other
industries,
not just autos.  The corporations hire dudes who wear expensively cut suits,
speak to the board of directors with politically correct, but likely
misleading,
plans and forecasts, pay themselves well, and hump the bonus plans in their
favor.

I would like to see:
- GM assume a place of generating innovative engineering and quality
exciting cars
- Ford, make a car that rides as well as a GM and would appeal to someone
other than my deceased father
- Chrysler give both GM and Ford a run for their money

And someday this may happen.  Stockholders, the board of directors, etc will
have
to make a decision to do it, and then get managment which has the courage
and
honesty to see it through.

When this happens, I will see it not only as a fact, but as something very
positive
for GM, and the entire American effort.

I often hear Americans brag of our superior engineering, our superior
manufacturing,
our superior lifestyle,  .....ad nauseum.. The facts, ladies and gentlemen,
are that we
have rested upon our superior asses until we are being nudged out of the
race.

The facts themselves are just that, neither positive or negative.  What
makes it one way or the other is the reason for the post.  Was it to bring
facts to the attention of others? To rally the troops to makes changes?   Or
was it to rub people's faces in bad news?

I don't know the reason in this case, but there are those that take pleasure
in the problems of others.  You decide for yourself.

I dont even care.  On the newsgroup, one can choose to read the post or not.

If the post is factual, then why should anyone care??

If it isn't, the poster will be chastised soon enough.

I think this deal of getting ones panties in a wad is ridiculous.

quarter?

&gt;&gt; We long ago figured out that you delight in any bad news you can find
&gt;&gt; about the US automakers Jim, but come on... do you really feel that
&gt;&gt; strong of a need to post 4 articles that all say the same thing? &gt; -Mike-

&gt; If you were head of GM, Mike, what would be your first move to try to
&gt; reverse this business  trend?
">

Plenty could be done.

Cut Buick, Pontiac, GMC and Saturn down to one model each and bleed
their dealers till they quit.  Isuzu is using this strategy to exit
businesses it doesn't want to be in.

Sell Saab to any sucker who will take it.  Maybe it could be given to
the New Chrysler Corporation :).

Up the warranty on the remaining products to Hyundai levels in order to
woo customers who have been burned by quality problems in the past.
Make sure that this doesn't cost the company a fortune by building in
quality to the product.

Focus on Chevrolet and Cadillac and make darn sure that every vehicle on
offer has a real argument to make for being best-in-class.  Hit
Honda-like redesign cycles on all those models without fail.

Tell the fleet buyers they can have as many vehicles as they want, as
long as the pay the same price as regular retail buyers.

That should get the ball going!
