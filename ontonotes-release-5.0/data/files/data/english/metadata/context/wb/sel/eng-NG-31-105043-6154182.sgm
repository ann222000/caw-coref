Promoting English in Bharat
By: P. Mallikarjuna Rao

It is very true that English enjoys pre-eminent place in relation to other Indian languages in our country. There are some practical reasons for this: 1. It is the library language. All the books related to advance science are in English 2.The employment opportunities available to the speakers of English are numerous. It is this segment which has been contributing a great deal to the foreign exchange reserves 3.It is the language of international business and other types of communication. In the age of globalization it has become essential for communication. Even countries like France, Germany are also studying English in their countries. These are some I immediately remember. Further, another peculiar feature of our country is the multiplicity of Indian languages. Every state has its own language. Anybody who is educated in the vernacular medium has to seek employment within that state. This also promotes linguistic chauvinism. As a South Indian I am against Hindi being imposed on us (but no opposition of imposition of English). To promote regional languages we do not have to suppress English. As matter of fact English has enriched many Indian languages. Even with out English our society has been hierarchical for ages. The problem is not so much the language as the attitude. We can strengthen the vernacular part of our curriculum. English has many advantages which we should not lose in the name of promoting Indian languages.

One moot point: should people be forced to respect their mother tongue, imagine what respect they would have for it!  I feel that it is not correct to place the blame entirely on the governments. Love of mother tongue begins at home. If the parents take upon themselves the responsibility of educating their children about the glory and significance of their culture and language, perhaps this situation would not arise.

A language is much more than a vehicle for communication.

If we think and act in a foreign language, we create people unsympathetic to the 'desi' things. This produces more babus (read baboon) with rutted and subservient   mind than clear-thinking, independent and patriotic mind.
The people who say that they will not let Hindi be forced upon them have let English forced upon them and continue to exhibit slave mentality. Our PM and other politicians are prime examples of the 'English' culture. As long as we
let people be divided by politicians for their own gains, we will continue to   be the losers and wouldn't be able to stand united. Our language is our heritage and it must not become a playing instrument in politicians' hand, because they don't know how to play it concordantly.

By and large, Chinese are more patriotic than Bharatiyas. Learning foreign languages, in addition to learning Bharatiya languages, is not bad.  English is useful to communicate with the world and   Hindi is useful in communicating with people of various states in Bharat. In Bharat all Bharatiya languages must be considered as sisters and given equal status. All Bharatiya languages have many common words as they are basically derived from the Sanskrit.

Opposition to Hindi by some South Indians is not fair.These persons did not oppose English during the British rule.

National language &amp;National identity

From: Digvijay

English people would love to see the envision of current Indian intellects. This is the main thing for which a country attacks other country. Lots of people die in the process from both sides (always). Your views reveal that it seems logical to adopt a foreign language because of zillions of reasons. On top of that, our intellectuals have been noticing the same route to become civilized only by speaking foreign language as our own, by spreading it coast to coast and also representing and rewarding followers as an educated one.

Let me reveal it to English lovers and promoters, how it shows our mentality towards our own countrymen.

If you talk in English (at least speaking even few words here and there) makes you a club member of an elite Indian group. So it is not important if you are really a literate person or not, but by speaking English you pose yourself as one.

Since I have been in US for over 20 years, I have noticed that every one speaks English here,  I mean every one, even a poorest to all the way to President and billionaire  Bill gates and all. So, if a gangster goes to India and talk in English, our simple Bharatiya will consider him as an educated one and will give respect.

Now let's go back to India again, we have majority of people live in villages and can not speak English. How's that relate to getting respect from a fellow Indian.. does not matter or does it. If you do not speak the language of our former Ruler, then you are not worthy of respect from other Indians, could be interpreted that way.

See Rao ji that is the core subject here. Since you are an educated person and your email address indicative of you being a professor, is not enough if you are dealing with Indians. Look at our TV and Cinema celebrities. They earn their money through Hindi Movies and from Hindi Movie Goers but whenever they are on TV for an interview, they talk the educated English language. I do not get the reason of this duplicity in our Indians. I would rather watch Hollywood movies because at least they are fair to their livelihood. Every one in India trying to show others that they are the one who copy English (British) better and so they expect respect from others.

Naming "Bollywood" shows a lot of class of being still slave.

Slavery is the process which instills the habit of thinking in your ruler's way. But our so called educated people of India, showing to whole world that they love to remember their former rulers and feel proud about it, really put me in delusion. The young Indian students think that it is a backward thing to feel patriotic about their country; they would like to leave that to Americans. The rest of American culture they would love to adopt and brag about it.

People of India make me think very unhappy. Look at the name change of cities:
From Calcutta to Kolcatta, Bombay to Mumbai (Should have changed Bollywood to Mollywood as well), Madras to Chennai, but would not change the Muslim name Allahabad to prayag.

For Bharatiya people this is important to show the REGIONAL Proud but not for the country. I call my fellow educated Indian an "Educated Illiterates" who has forgotten their history and religion. They feel enlighten to pray in temples using a foreign language. That is the limit of what slavery can do to your brains and then it breeds the next generation with more powerful hate for your own country and culture. On the surface it does look otherwise, but in the inside...well who cares!!!

The Indian children who born out side India, will never like to respect that. The whole world will never appreciate the duplicity in any one. Mr. Rao it is called Gulaami and it eats the self esteem and replaces it with a phony one. You can see what kind of argument you have given in defense of English. You can write long letters to argue against the Hindi being imposed but when majority of city dwellers start speaking English, then it is not arguable but appreciable thing.

Wow!!!

You are an educated one ....I agree, who can spin lot better than Chandrasekhar, Prasanna, Bedi or Murlidharan.

It all shows that we did not take our freedom from British by FORCE; instead the freedom was given to us with conditions attached to it.

They (Terrorists) dropped TWIN TOWERS in USA and US went on to destroy two countries. That is the real LEADERSHIP. We have hundreds of thousand Kashmiri Pundits and Hindus left Kashmir and living in India as a refugee and over 60,000 died in terrorist attacks, that is not a cause for concern for our spineless leaders.

Hello! Is any one there who can show our new generation to fight for their freedom or we are so busy teaching them English, the language of their colonial masters to prove their still slavery and to act like Americans and we will be the WORLD POWER soon.

Bin Laden was given a bad name, but look, he has the guts to fight with powerful countries..for his religion. But we Indian producing thinkers who can forget to show our children that why Mahmood Gaznabi went on to destroy Somnath Temple while our so called intellectual PUJARIES were busy perusing the young ones to pray to Lord Shiva instead of going to fight Gaznabi. That was an Intellectual representation of being cowardice and justifiably God rewarded Gaznabi to rule India.

I believe, we are on different page and the argument is going nowhere. I have read the history and learned that offense is the best defense, but sorry to see the reactions from my countrymen who are in race to show the whole world that how humble human being we are. May be recent bombing in Bombay was another proof to ask the world to show sympathy and give more business to India instead of learning from American and Israelis to attack few terrorist camps in Pakistan.

Believe it or not, but being humble needs a lot of strength and courage or else Indians will be labelled as timid and spineless creatures.

Promoting Hindi does not mean opposing English or other languages

Did we ever imply that while promoting Hindi we are opposing other languages especially Mr. Rao's "mother tongue" ENGLISH" And would Mr. Rao explain that why past mistakes cannot be corrected as he mentioned that certain past forces(slaves of British) brought English so we should continue with that !
If we can accept English as universal language why not Hindi. Can all the Indians learn all the regional languages, obviously not so that is the only reason for having Hindi as national language as it's widely spoken/understood
in India

Dear Ms. Sujatha Guptaji

Thanks for your mail. It is really strange that you should all feel so piqued by what I write about Hindi. The issue of Hindi being the national language was clinched long ago. That is not the issue now. The argument that it gives national identity and its promotion contributes to the national unity is unrealistic and puerile. Most of you are presumptuous. If you read my mail you understand that I said imposition of Hindi on the South encounters a stiff resistance in spite of it being the national language. I was also critical of the anti-English attitude of people. I asked the contenders to be realistic about their ideas. I am not against Hindi. My contention is Hindi, as the things stand now cannot promote national integration. On the contrary it widens the rift between the North and the South. You say that Hindi is as universal as English. Do you really think so? How many people in India let alone the world that can speak and write in Hindi?

English is my "mother tongue" as much as it is of those who speak and write in it. People have no qualms about using it to earn dollars in America and elsewhere. The de facto ligua Franca of India is English. We may not like it, but that is the truth.  Ironically, we have been able carry out this discussion about promotion of Hindi because of English. If I extend the tenor of your argument that those who speak in favor of English are slavish, then by supporting Hindi with out questions you want us in the South to be slaves of Hindi. So that is not the issue.

About correcting the past mistakes- it is easier said than done. Shall we do away with English by an act of parliament? Even if you ban English language teaching in schools, people will run to tutorial colleges to learn it, because it provides them better livelihood. So, it is wiser to promote Hindi along with English instead of abusing English and the English speaking Indians. Wisdom lies in using English to promote Indian culture and heritage. Read my mail carefully.

Thirdly I said promotion of Hindi should not affect the promotion of other Indian languages. I did not ask all people to learn all regional languages as some of you presume. If that is your understanding God help you!

Finally the issue is about national identity and national integration. In fact I wrote a detailed mail to Mr. Digvijayji. You may ask him to forward it to you. My appeal to you all is to be cool and serious in your arguments. Only then we can throw some light on the issue. Well! It is up to you.
