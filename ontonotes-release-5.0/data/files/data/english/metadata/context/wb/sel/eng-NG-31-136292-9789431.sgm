The Histrionic Patient - A Case Study

&quot;Personality Disorders Revisited&quot; (450 pages e-book) - click HERE to purchase!

By: Dr. Sam Vaknin

Notes of first therapy session with Marsha, female, 56, diagnosed with Histrionic Personality Disorder

Marsha visibly resents the fact that I have had to pay attention to another patient (an emergency) &quot;at her expense&quot; as she puts it. She pouts and bats suspiciously long eyelashes at me: &quot;Has any of your female patients fallen in love with you?&quot; - she suddenly changes tack. I explain to her what is transference and countertransference in therapy. She laughs throatily and shakes loose an acid blond mane: &quot;You may call it what you want, doctor, but the simple truth is that you are irresistibly cute.&quot;

I steer away from these treacherous waters by asking her about her marriage. She sighs and her face contort, on the verge of tears: &quot;I hate what's been happening to Doug and me. He has had such a stretch of bad luck - my heart goes out to him. I really love him you know. I miss what we used to be. But his rage attacks and jealousy are driving me away. I feel that I am suffocating.&quot;

Is he a possessive paranoid? She shifts uneasily in her seat: &quot;I like to flirt. A little flirting never hurt nobody is what I say.&quot; Does Doug share her insouciance? He accuses her of being too provocative and seductive. Well, is she? &quot;A woman can never be too much of either&quot; - she protests mockingly.

Has she ever cheated on her husband? Never. So, why his jealous tantrums? Because she has been pretty direct with men she fancied, told them what she would do with them and to them if circumstances were different. Was this a wise thing to do in public? Maybe not the wisest, but it sure was fun, she laughs.

How did men react to her advances? &quot;Usually, with an enormous erection.&quot; - she chuckles - &quot;How did you react, doctor?&quot; I was embarrassed, I admit, even annoyed. She doesn't believe me, she says. No red-blooded male has ever been put off by the lure of an attractive female and &quot;from where I sit, you sure look as red-blooded as they come.&quot;

Doug has been her fourth serious relationship this year. How can such a short-lived liaison be meaningful? &quot;Depth and intimacy can be created overnight&quot; - she assures me, they are not a function of the length of acquaintance. But surely they depend on the amount of time spent together? &quot;Is this your wife?' - she points at a silver-framed picture on my desk - &quot;I bet you are hitting it off in the sack!&quot; Actually, I tell her, that's my daughter. She shrugs off her faux-pas and sprawls across my duvet, long legs exposed to the hip and crossed at the ankles.

She sighs theatrically and shields her eyes with her hand: &quot;I wish it was all over.&quot; Does she mean her relationship with Doug? &quot;No, silly&quot;, she was referring to her tumultuous life and its vagaries. Does she really mean it? Of course not. She rolls to one side, leaning on her elbow, face supported by an open palm: &quot;I just wish people were more lighthearted, you know? I wish they knew how to enjoy life to the maximum, give and take with joy. Isn't this what psychotherapy is all about? Aren't these the skills you, as a psychiatrist, are trying to instil in your patients?&quot;

The Schizoid Patient - A Case Study

&quot;Personality Disorders Revisited&quot; (450 pages e-book) - click HERE to purchase!

By: Dr. Sam Vaknin

Notes of first therapy session with Mark, male, 36, diagnosed with Schizoid Personality Disorder

Mark sits where instructed, erect but listless. When I ask him how he feels about attending therapy, he shrugs and mumbles &quot;OK, I guess&quot;. He rarely twitches or flexes his muscles or in any way deviates from the posture he has assumed early on. He reacts with invariable, almost robotic equanimity to the most intrusive queries on my part. He shows no feelings when we discuss his uneventful childhood, his parents (&quot;of course I love them&quot;), and sad and happy moments he recollects at my request.

Mark veers between being bored with our encounter and being annoyed by it. How would he describe his relationships with other people? He has none that he can think of. In whom does he confide? He eyes me quizzically: &quot;confide?&quot; Who are his friends? Does he have a girlfriend? No. He shares pressing problems with his mother and sister, he finally remembers. When was the last time he spoke to them? More than two years ago, he thinks.

He doesn't seem to feel uneasy when I probe into his sex life. He smiles: no, he is not a virgin. He has had sex once with a much older woman who lived across the hall in his apartment block. That was the only time, he found it boring. He prefers to compile computer programs and he makes nice money doing it. Is he a member of a team? He involuntarily recoils: no way! He is his own boss and likes to work alone. He needs his solitude to think and be creative.

That's precisely why he is here: his only client now insists that he collaborates with the IT department and he feels threatened by the new situation. Why? He ponders my question at length and then: &quot;I have my working habits and my long-established routines. My productivity depends on strict adherence to these rules.&quot; Has he ever tried to work outside his self-made box? No, he hasn't and has no intention of even trying it: &quot;If it works don't fix it and never argue with success.&quot;

If he is such a roaring success what is he doing on my proverbial couch? He acts indifferent to my barb but subtly counterattacks: &quot;Thought I'd give it a try. Some people go to one type of witch doctor, I go to another.&quot;

Does he have any hobbies? Yes, he collects old sci-fi magazines and comics. What gives him pleasure? Work does, he is a workaholic. What about his collections? &quot;They are distractions&quot;. But do they make him happy, does he look forward to the time he spends with them? He glowers at me, baffled: &quot; I collect old magazines.&quot; - he explains patiently - &quot;How are old magazines supposed to make me happy?&quot;.
