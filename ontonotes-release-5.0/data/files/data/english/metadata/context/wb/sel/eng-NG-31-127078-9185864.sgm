&gt; Study: Holiday Feasts Increase Global Warming

&gt; http://www.dailyredundancy.com/archives/1062p.html

&gt; CAMBRIDGE, MA - A new study has linked the traditional feasts associated
&gt; with Thanksgiving and Christmas to increases in planetary temperatures.
&gt; The report, to be released Wednesday, claims the additional energy
&gt; required to fatten, slaughter, ship and roast tens of millions of
&gt; turkeys causes a seasonal spike in greenhouse gasses. Scientists say the
&gt; effects of these spikes could be devastating.
&gt; Decadent Turkey Feast
&gt; &quot;Once the damage is done, it's difficult to reverse the effects.&quot; said
&gt; Myron Finnister, professor of Climatic Endocrinology at Howyflyl
&gt; University. &quot;It's much like the person doing the feasting, who can never
&gt; seem to shed those extra pounds. And pretty soon, it's time to feast all
&gt; over again.&quot;

&gt; The report cites that energy consumption typically increases during the
&gt; months of November and December, the peak of the turkey production
&gt; season. Energy use beyond December is mainly due to cold weather,
&gt; according to the report. &quot;Temperature increases of up to 0.2 degrees
&gt; over the next 100 years can be directly attributable to this spike.&quot;
&gt; said Finnister.

&gt; Nutritionists and conservationists are quick to point out alternatives
&gt; to the roast turkey dinner. &quot;Vegetables, which are much lighter than
&gt; turkeys and therefore more efficient to ship, are an excellent feast.&quot;
&gt; said Lindy Hellman-Jones, a dietary specialist at Newhall Clinic. &quot;But
&gt; if people must eat turkeys, which is pretty gross, there are steps they
&gt; can take to save the planet. If everyone would turn their ovens down
&gt; from 350 to 345, it would be like taking 1 million cars off the road.&quot;

With crude oil at $100/bbl, one would think that a warmer planet would
be desirable.
