Those of us who've been listening to IITM for a while will remember
Imus' conversations with the (former) Mayor of Providence, Vincent A.
&quot;Buddy&quot; Cianci.  They got along famously, to the point that Buddy
renamed a alley in Providence &quot;Imus Way&quot;.  (The sign is still there.
If I was taller, it wouldn't be.)

Buddy was indicted in '01, 27 federal counts.  He was convicted of one
(enterprise corruption - RICO) and served his 5 years.  He was
released at the end of May to a halfway house in Boston, then returned
to Lil' Rhody in July.

Today it was announced that Buddy will pick up where he left off - as
a talk show host on 630 AM WPRO starting September 20.  He'd
previously hosted a show on' PRO as well as one on rival WHJJ.

1)  If a convicted felon - and Buddy is that - can get a radio gig,
then there is NO reason why Imus can't.

2)  Buddy's legendary toupee, which Imus ragged on him about almost
unmercilessly, has gone buh-bye.

Just saw that myself. Good on Buddy, who is probably still an I-
fave. :)
