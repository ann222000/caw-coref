does anyone know the artist in the group who showed all the killer
illustrations he had done at meeting months back? they were some very
talented sketches.  the note below is from the wife of a friend
looking for someone to help illustrate her book. it should be a good
lead for any sketch artists in the group that want a book project. her
contact info below.

Thank you for replying so promptly.  Am looking for an illustrator/designer
for a book I'm helping edit/ghostwrite.  It's a how-to book on sales that
will be self-published (at least for now) - it'll have a fun yet
professional approach.  Not too serious.  A little bit clever.  The designer
will be able to &quot;flex their muscle&quot; a bit creativity-wise since it's still
quite early in the process and the writer and I prefer a collaborative
process.  We have an outline and two chapters written.  Half of the book
will be straight text and graphics and half will be 25 tips. A freelancer
will probably work better than a firm for this type of project.  Thank you
so much for your help.   Regards, Karen Nienhauser   480-415-6377

Thanks for the kind words, all of you.
