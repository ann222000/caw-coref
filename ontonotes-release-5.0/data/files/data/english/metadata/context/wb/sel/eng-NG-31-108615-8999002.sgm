No experiment has yet disproven Lorentz' Ether Theory nor the
Lumineferous Ether.

Michealson Morley Experiment do not bother do state this, causing many
less knowledged to believe the experiment did disprove the existance
of an Ether.

#1  Light speed is constant in all directions in air, water, glass,
etc....does not mean there is no ari, water, or glass. Likewise for
the Ether.

#2. Waves do no collide and do no slow each other down, thus the
Lumineferous Ether where light is ripples of the Ether also has not
been disproved.

#3. Higg's field may also be the Ether.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

#4. There's also &quot;Mythology&quot; of the Ethereal Universe which forms
multiple plaforms of the heavens (up to the 7th or 9th heaven know as
the Godly plane).

Of course not! This is science, and in science nothing can ever be
&quot;proven&quot; or &quot;disproven&quot;. But yes, Lorentz Ether theory has never been
refuted by any experiment within its domain.

[This is directly related to to the fact that LET and
SR are experimentally indistinguishable. As SR has not
been refuted, neither has LET. But there are good
reasons why modern physics is based on SR rather than
LET (O'Barr's rantings around here notwithstanding).]

This has little to do with the lumeniferous ether, as the ether in LET
is rather different from what that phrase normally refers to.

You expect them to be clairvoyant???? After all, LET was not described
until almost 20 years after they published!

BEWARE OF PUNS!!! The MMX did indeed refute the existence of the
then-prevalent ether theory. It's just that, as I said above, the ether
of LET is rather different from the usual &quot;lumeniferous ether&quot;.

No. These are QUITE DIFFERENT and INCOMMENSURATE. But to understand that
one must understand both concepts -- perhaps you would do better if you
bothered to learn about the things you attempt to write about, rather
than just wasting time posting nonsense to the net. &lt;shrug&gt;

Definition &amp; REFERENCE INFO BELOW:
************************************
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higgs_boson
The particle called Higgs boson is the quantum of one of the
components of a Higgs field. In empty space, the Higgs field acquires
a non-zero value, which permeates every place in the universe at all
times. The vacuum expectation value (VEV) of the Higgs field is
constant and equal to 246 GeV. The existence of this non-zero VEV
plays a fundamental role: it gives mass to every elementary particle,
including to the Higgs boson itself. In particular, the acquisition of
a non-zero VEV spontaneously breaks the electroweak gauge symmetry, a
phenomenon known as the Higgs mechanism.
*************************************

Understandable to prefer existing definitions, rather then the
summation of them?
In the ABOVE defintion &amp; reference, &quot;they&quot; say:

Higg's field everywhere.
Field gives mass to everything in the universe(Higgs's boson &amp; then
elementary particles).

One can &quot;choose&quot; to believe the ether is not a field, not me.
One can &quot;choose&quot; to believe there needs to be two fields for the
existance and creation of mass, the Higgs and the Ether, not me.

I believe all fields are energy fields including Higgs Field and the
Ether.
I believe the big bang emitted a field of energy.

I believe this field is one field an NOT multiple, if so then one can
choose to believe the Ether and Higgs field were created afterwards,
NOT me.

IF not and for those who prefer to chose like me, then they should all
be, one and the same field.

As for comments on nonsense, I decline.
