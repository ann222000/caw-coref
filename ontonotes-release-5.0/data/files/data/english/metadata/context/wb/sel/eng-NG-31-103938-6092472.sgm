With the impending White Death facing us tonight and tomorrow it is a
perfect time to discuss the pain and suffering known as Indoor Training.

As usual a collection of sensory dulled individuals will be meeting for an
indoor ride tomorrow evening at 6:30pm in the Loveland area.

If you have finally convinced yourself that you aren't going to become a
stronger rider by sitting on the couch and watching American Idol while
imbibing some Old Style and eating Cheetoh's, then come on over and do a
two hour ride with us.

Unlike the spring rides, you won't get dropped on this ride.

I'm gonna slack off and start hittin' it again once I get up to
240lbs. That way I'll have a goal in mind. Done blown it for now, so
may as well top out at an all time record. Oh, btw, Doritos work well
too.
