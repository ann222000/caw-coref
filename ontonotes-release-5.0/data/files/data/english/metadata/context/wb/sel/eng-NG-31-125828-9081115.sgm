Problems with Sky TVLINK - can't change channels

I recently purchased a TV to go in the bedroom. We have Sky so I
thought it'd be a good idea to link the bedroom TV to the Sky box
downstairs.

With regards to cabling already in place, behind the tv in the lounge
is a wall plate which the Sky box's RF OUT 2 is connected to via a
coax cable.

This goes into the loft where it connects via a male/femle coax
connection to the coax cable going from the bedroom's wall plate (the
upstairs and downstairs cables were separate until i joined them with
the connector)

With this infrastructure in place I get a great picture on the second
tv from my sky box downstairs.

I realised I'd need something to be able to change the channel on the
sky box from upstairs. This is where the problems started.

I picked up a Sky TVLINK from Argos, plugged it into the back of the
second TV and made sure that the 9v was switched on via the installer
menu. All was ok at this point and the LED was lit on the back of the
TVLINK.

Straight away I was able to change the sky channel from the second TV
in the bedroom. Perfect!

I then went to use it yesterday and whilst the picture was still great
I could not change channels on the Sky box.

The TVLINK led was still on. The cabling hadn't changed at all.

After about 20 minutes it mysteriously started working and I could
again change channels no problem.

I tried it this morning but alas it had stopped working again.

As far as I know there isnt a physical cable problem - I havent had
chance yet to see if the wall plates are isolated or not.

if they aren't (the house is a year old), is there anything else I can
try? The TVLINK works perfectly if plugged directly into the sky box
downstairs.

thanks in advance

It won't be the wall plates if it worked once.

My guess is a loose or oxidised connection somewhere. The TV signal will go
through a dirty connection but the DC power for the TVLink might be
marginal.

Check for 9V at the TV end while someone else waggles all the connectors in
turn.

You can check the wall plates - but in your case, that is unlikely to be
the cause of the problem.  The LED would not be illuminated, if you had
an isolated wall plate - or any other isolated components between the
Sky receiver and the second TV.

The TV-Link system can be temperamental and individual units may be more
sensitive than others.  Furthermore, a good quality co-ax connection is
a fundamental requirement for reliable operation.

I had a similar problem last year.  Even though the LED was on, my Sky+
receiver did not respond intermittently, when I used the remote control
from upstairs.  I eventually solved that problem by checking and
re-making every joint in the co-ax cabling.

I recommend that you remove each co-ax plug/socket from the co-ax cable.
Some types of co-ax plug/socket include a small grubscrew to secure the
centre wire.  If so, the screw should ensure a reliable connection.
Otherwise, try soldering the centre wire into each co-ax plug/socket.
Then, use fine grade emery paper to clean all contacts between the plugs
and sockets.

Also, check that the infra-red receiver of the TV-Link is not too close
to the upstairs TV.   Sometimes, moving the infra-red receiver can
resolve this type of problem.

If that doesn't work, take it back to Argos and demand a replacement.
As I said, some units (and some brands) are more sensitive than others.
A replacement unit might work OK.

thanks for that chaps.  i'll check that out.

i think the idea of checking for 9v at the tvlink end is a great
idea.  if i get the mrs to waggle the connections i reckon i can
narrow down where the dodgy link is.

i've got a feeling it'll be where i joined the two cables in the roof
- the male and female connectors supplied with the tvlink were very
basic screw on ones - no grubscrews or crimping involved at all.

If I ever want to join a coax cable I use 'F' connectors and an 'F' barrel.

A bit of a long shot but try checking that no other equipment in the
room is sending out Infra-Red signals which maybe interfering with
your remote.

ok i figured out where the problem lies.

i switched on the second tv last night and the tvlink wasnt allowing
me to change channels.

i unplugged the tvlink from the second TV and i WAS then able to
change channels on sky (obviously no picture or sound).

i then plugged the tvlink back into the second TV and it worked
perfectly - for the remainder of the viewing session.

incidentally, i get the same 8.88v reading on each connection -
starting from the back of the sky box right up to the coax cable in
the bedroom.

obviously i dont want to be unplugging the tvlink each time - wont do
the connection any good..

i read somewhere that if it's the tv it may need decoupling. anyone
know what that means?

and crimp rather than screw on F-connectors.

I'm not sure the TV would have any effect upon the DC power supply.  The
TV-Link module has an integral capacitor, to prevent the power supply
from reaching the TV.  This is essential, because a 9-volt supply at the
aerial input socket could damage some TVs.

I would be more inclined to suspect an intermittent bad connection
between the co-ax cable and the TV-Link.

The other thing to check is the physical location of the IR receiver.
Sometimes, the position of a magic eye receiver (in relation to the TV)
may be critical.  A TV might interfere with the operation of the magic
eye, if the components are too close to each other.  For instance, I use
a TV-Link with an elderly Pye TV.  The magic eye works well, if I place
it to one side of the TV - but does not always respond, if the magic eye
sits on top of the TV cabinet.

Fluorescent lighting and bright light sources can also conflict with the
infra-red signal, if they shine on the IR receiver.

&gt; Then it is already decoupled.

&gt; I never suggested anything different; I just posted to provide one
&gt; likely
&gt; meaning of the word &quot;decoupling&quot;.

&gt; Tony
">

Let's look at this logically.

TV-Link didn't respond to the remote control initially, with
everything connected to the second TV.

It responded, as soon as the OP unplugged it from the second TV.

It continued to work, when the OP plugged it back, into the second TV.

That sounds like a bad connection, which could be:

a)    between the co-ax cable and the TV-Link or

b)    between the TV-Link and the second TV

These symptoms could also be caused by a faulty TV-Link - if the thin,
flexible lead between the barrel of the device and the IR receiver has
a bad soldered joint (at either end).  Movement, caused by unplugging
it and plugging it in again could break or restore the dodgy joint.

I would return the TV-Link to Argos as a faulty item and request a
replacement.

If the replacement works, it will solve the problem.  If the
replacement doesn't work, then the OP will need to check his wiring
once again, and/or try slightly different locations for the IR
receiver / magic eye.
