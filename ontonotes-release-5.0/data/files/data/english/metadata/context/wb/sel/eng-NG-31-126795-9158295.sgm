Dear all:

I remember POSCO is neither ready to buy Iron ores at market price nor ready
to offer land price at market price.
It wants to buy lands at Govt. determined price;no commitment to offer stock
option to land losers.

POSCO must calculate the benefits due to lower ore pricing and should be
ready to offer mandatory stock options and jobs to the land owners.

Without offering any of these additional benefits, if it dreams that its
facilitator GoO will do the job for it at minimum price, it may delay or
jeopardise the project.

Police is keep registering FIRs against activists/local leaders and
designating them as 'trouble makers'.

This may lead to unpleasant consequences like Kalinganagar.

Thanks
Manoj Padhi

BHUBANESWAR: The Posco Pratirodha Sangram Samiti, billed as one of India's
most aggressive anti-land acquisition organisations, was born around the
same time when Orissa chief minister Naveen Patnaik inked the deal with the
South Korean company on June 22, 2005.

Since then, the samiti has been opposing the acquisition of 4,004 acres of
land in the area for the much-touted Posco plant. &quot;I formally started the
first 'jana jagaran' rally on July 11, 2005. With a microphone mounted on a
trolley-rickshaw and accompanied by around 10 people, I moved from village
to village sensitising people what the project was all about,&quot; said samiti
president Abhaya Sahoo.

&quot;I wonder how the government is so insensible to overlook what the villagers
say. We are not irrational,&quot; he said. Sahoo said the police so far had
registered 61 cases against him and 78 cases against the samiti. &quot;Let the
government do whatever it wants. We are not going to give an inch of land
for the Posco project,&quot; he said.However, he stated he was not
anti-industrialisation.

Dear Manoj ji

If you believe me, the best solution is that government of Orissa form a
joint venture with international mining companies of repute by inviting
global tender and fix a rate of iron ore who ever wants to make steel to buy
from them at market price. All the noises will come to an end. I am not only
sure, but fully confident that with POSCO at present terms particularly with
SEZ status is a curse on Orissa and not at all of any benefit.

I also challenge Government of Orissa to publish a white paper stating what
is the availability of iron ore with them vis a vis the status of the
companies with whom they have executed MOUs. You will be surprised to know
that there will be a series of disputes between the companies themselves
once this paper is published.

Rampant corruption is taking place to get the MOU signed with a tag of iron
ore guarantee or to say in simple words is licence to loot the natural
resources.
