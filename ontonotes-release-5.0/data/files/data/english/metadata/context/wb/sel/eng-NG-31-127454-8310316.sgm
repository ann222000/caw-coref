These people were not &quot;risking their lives for Harry&quot;, they were risking their lives to defeat Voldemort - an annoyance

Throughout this last book (and in earlier books), we have a lot of angst by
Harry because there are people risking their lives &quot;for him&quot;, as if it is
just out of love for him, or a sacrifice for him *as a person*.  This is
just bunk in most cases.  People were willing to risk their lives to PROTECT
Harry because he was their best weapon against Voldemort.  It was *in their
interest* to protect Harry, or at least in the interest of a cause they
believed in.   Harry is constantly in angst about these people &quot;dying for
him&quot; or &quot;risking their lives for him&quot;, when really he is just a tool, a
weapon, the way they would risk their lives to protect a magical item that
was the only thing that could defeat Voldemort.

Kind of annoying, really.

Ironically, the one person who was actually risking his life
specifically to keep Harry alive was Snape!

Granted, it was because he was Lily's son, but Snape was still focused
completely on Harry's safety.  When he learned late that Dumbledore
was using Harry as a disposable weapon against Voldemort, Snape was
outraged:

“I have spied for you and lied for you, put myself in mortal
danger for you.  Everything was supposed to be to keep Lily Potter’s
son safe. Now you tell me you have been raising him like a pig for
slaughter—”

How's THAT for a turn of events?   ;)

He *wasn't* doing it for Harry. He was doing it because by asking DD
to save Lily he had compromised his standing with Voldemort!

If Voldie had learned what Snape had done he'd have been dead so once
he'd committed himself to save Lily all was lost.

It was an accident of fate that Harry was being saved by him... it had
*nothing* to do with Harry per se... and all to do with Lily!

Is it annoying in the way that it keeps being brought up? Why Harry spends
so much time worrying about it?

If so, you have to know by now that all 7 books have pretty much all been
from Harry's point of view. In this case, that's how he feels - that people
are risking their lives for him out of a sense of loyalty.

I'm sure Harry's closest friends (Ron, Hermione, Neville, Luna, etc.) do
feel this way, though what Harry never &quot;gets&quot; is that it's not up to him
what other people do, or what their motivation is - that's what drives him
into such angst, he doesn't get that they're doing it because they want to,
not because they feel the need to prove any loyalty.

The wider Wizarding World is indeed helping Harry for the reason you
mention - he's a tool against Voldy.

They believe this because of the reports in The Daily Prophet of The
Prophecy, and they need &quot;hope&quot; in these Dark Times. Harry winds up being
what Fudge &amp; Scrimgeour wanted - a symbol. Though Harry standing &quot;alone&quot;
(not with the Ministry) is what, I think, really rallied the People - that
he was not only destined to defeat LV, but he was brave enough to also fight
The System that ultimately fails them.

WRONG   ...   Don't forget, all of those protecting Harry thought

Umm, his asking Voldemort to save Lily compromised his standing with
V, not his asking DD. The results of that asking (read: none, really)
were what changed his attitude toward V. He only came to DD after it
was too late to stop V.

There are many things to which you could be referring here, and so I
agree, but if you are referring to his asking DD to save Lily then I
must again say: What??

V didn't know anything about his requests to DD. Snape is an excellent
Occlumens. I hope that fact didn't evade you completely. It's the only
way he survived, doing what he was doing.

No, I don't think that's the case.  I agree that in the real world,
Snape's fear of Voldemort would have to be taken into consideration.
But in the books, it isn't even mentioned.  Rowling makes it pretty
clear that Snape is motivated strictly by Lily, and in her absence, by
a desire to keep her son alive.

And yes, he still hates Harry.  He wants to protect him strictly
because he is Lily's son.  It is a favor for Lily, not for Harry.
Snape makes that clear in the scene where he shows Dumbledore his
patronus.

My point is that Snape was more obsessed with keeping Lily's son alive
than almost anyone else.  As the old saying goes: whooda thunkit?

That's how he sees it.  He uses people.  Nobody short of Bellatrix
would do snot for him.  he also wanted to demoralize Harry.

Everybody chose to stay and fight.  Eveyrbody chose to protect him for
whatever reason.  Harry chose to die to save them.  How many other
people have chosen to die for them?  Nobody, that's who.
