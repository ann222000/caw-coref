What to do? Root canal or not?

I'm 48 yr old male

have a crown on left lower molar that I can't chew on.
Is pressure sensitive. Does not bother at any other
time except when applying pressure to it.

My dentist couldn't find anything wrong so sent me to
an endodontist where he did some tests and decide the
root is healthy and probably does NOT need a root
canal.

So..... starting wearing my NTI religiously for several
months now upon advice on both dentists thinking that
I'm clenching teeth severely at night (which I am).

However after several months I still can NOT chew on
the tooth with discomfort from pressure.

The crown that is on the tooth now needs replaced as
its fractured.

Should I go ahead and get a root canal before having
crown replaced even tho both dentists are unclear if
really needing root canal?  the root appears healthy
but obviously something is wrong!

I hate the idea of putting a new crown on...... only to
have a root canal months later if problem persists and
then drilling thru this gold crown!

This is a judgement call.  I don't think I'd do a root canal on a wing
and a prayer.  When the old crown is off, I'd have the endodontist look
at it again if there is any doubt.  If it still tests normal I'd make a
carefully-constructed temporary crown and wear it for a few weeks, and
see if there are any change in symptoms.

Yep I agree a judgment call....and one I'm having hard
time deciding what to do. &lt;g&gt;

can the enodontist make a better judgment with crown
off? Will it be more clear to him?

I am def clenching teeth in sleep and have been for
years (probably). However I am now wearing NTI device
very religiously as I've learned my lesson.

Both dentists think I have been clenching so hard that
the root 9altho not dead)..... is trying to build up
additional structure at its point. The explanation
given to me was that a root is shaped like the pointed
end of a nail.....and my clenching has been DRIVING the
root down into my jaw bone.  as a result the root is
trying to build up additional support structure at its
tip. a name was given..... I wish I could remember
it.... condensing something or other.

My primary dentists thinks should go ahead and do a
root canal and install gold crown on top

Condensing osteitis on a tooth with symptoms?  I would normally offer RCT
immediately to such a patient.

I personally do not do metal crowns anymore.  So, my opinion about how to
restore it after the RCT is different from some of the regulars here.

Just remember that with your last crown, it broke at the weakest point.  If
you put a full gold crown over it, what will be the weakest point then?

Condensing osteitis?  This is generally considered a sign of a
degenerating pulp.  If this is in fact the case, root canal may in fact
be needed, esp. in the presence of pain.  It doesn't seem likely that
such a tooth would react normally to an electronic pulp test, though I
couldn't rule that out.
Certainly it would be easier to evaluate the tooth with the crown removed.
If this is just from grinding and clenching and if you are wearing your
NTI religiously as you say,  I would hope we could eliminate current
parafunction as a cause of the problem.  It is possible though that
damage had already been done.

yep that's it I believe!

again..... most likely caused by my stupidity in NOT
wearing the NTO device for years &lt;sigh&gt;

I think my dentist was hoping that by starting to were
the NTI that the tooth may heal?

But the endodontist said the root was NOT dead
yet.....and again he said he didn't think it needed a
root canal..... but did STRESS HEAVILY to wear the NTI
device

at any rate..... the tooth is STILL pressure sensitive
and since I need a new crown on it anyway......would it
be wise to just go ahead and get the root canal BEFORE
having the new gold crown put on?

I know I'm asking a lot here.... especially since you
cant se me in person..... but I am at a loss what to do

Surface hardness of gold will be less than laboratory fired porcelain, but
the elasticity will be different.  The gold is less likely to chip if you
overpower it with heavy clenching. Generally, the gold is made thick enough
that it will not bend.  Since there is usually very little actual tooth
structure left under a metal crown or PFM, excessive force builds up
stresses which are then relieved at the base of the crown.  Often by the
crown snapping off taking all the residual tooth structure with it.  If the
pressures are slightly more moderate, you end up with "ditching" of the
tooth at the gum-line (abfractions).  If the material covering the tooth
chips with excessive force, you reduce the urgency of any damage from
clenching forcibly.  A patient who clenches needs to have his teeth restored
in a fashion that there is still something there to fix if he overpowers the
teeth.  You need to plan how it will fail, the next time it fails.  Remember
that all dental work will fail eventually.

After the third long term study showing machine milled ceramic having fewer
failures than gold inlays (or gold crowns), I had my own observations
confirmed.  The last study,,,, was a fifteen year study.  If I can get the
same longevity without cutting the only solid dentin off the tooth, I am
going to do it.  Plus the material wears identical to enamel, Machine milled
ceramic has a coefficient of expansion which is the average between dentin
and enamel.  Its shear strength is almost the same as enamel.  With onlays
and large inlays (even to the point of being 80% the width of the tooth),
the tooth retains much of its ability to flex along its entire length, and
abfraction is not focused on a 2 mm band at the CEJ.  And, someday, when the
restoration needs to be re-done, I will have tons more tooth to work with.

You average crown prep will leave less than 1 mm of residual dentin to give
lateral support to the clinical crown.  If you only replace what is missing
with an onlay/inlay, you get to keep 3-5 mm thick areas of dentin,
especially at the cervical aspect.

Add to the mix that I do not need to mess with PVS impressions, temporaries,
opposing models or seating appointments.

Want to discuss why the "ferrule effect" on a crown prep is the worst thing
we can do as dentists?

Take the average tooth being treated with crown.  Prep it for a crown, then
remove all the filling in the tooth.  Then we will talk.

Take all the filling out of your next crown prep first, then study where the
residual tooth structure is the thickest.

I've done either and both a time or two.  The answer would vary,
depending on the pattern of previous and current decay, previous
fillings, fractures, tooth inclination, etc.  If the decay or fractures
come close to the gingival margin, I am doubtless going to prepare to or
below the gingival margin.  Either way, it is rare that I wouldn't get
an axial wall significantly greater than the 1 mm you site.
Perhaps I am not understanding your scenario.

Buy a new car and drive it off of the lot.  Then put 50K miles on
it in city traffic every year, rarely change the oil, ride the
brakes, and generally drive like a maniac, and your car will have
early mechanical troubles plus cost a lot to keep running.

Take the same car, only put 10K miles on it with mainly highway
driving, drive sensibly, and provide all maintenance, and the
car is likely to last years and years with few problem.

However, it still won't last forever.

Same with your teeth and any restoration placed by any dentist.

The better maintenance, higher quality repairs, less abuse, and
proper diet, the longer your teeth and restorations will last.

The NTI is kind of like a governer on an auto.  It doesn't prevent
all wear and stress.  It just helps reduce abusive forces that
lead to early failures.

You are allowed to disagree with me.

Most teeth getting a crown for the first time, have thick axial walls on the
buccal or lingual (or both) near the CEJ.  Because the tooth tapers and
becomes more narrow towards the root tip, the average crown prep removes a
lot of tooth structure to get adequate thickness for the crown margins at
the CEJ.  You cut away the thickest part of the tooth -- a few mm coronal to
the CEJ in order to get your converging axial walls to the crown prep and
still get adequate reduction at the margins.  If the tooth had a wide
amalgam or composite through the center of the tooth, the resultant vertical
wall of dentin left after the crown prep, may be very tall, but is also very
thin.

A better way to restore the tooth would be to simply cut off the coronal 1/3
of the tooth, clean out the caries and old restoration, smooth the internal
walls, and fabricate something which can be bonded to the inner surfaces and
the top of shortened cusp tips.  You would be left with 3 times more
original tooth structure, and more of the inherent flexibility of the tooth
would remain -- abfraction would not be localized the CEJ, but could spread
out a few mm in both directions.  If you bond the restoration, choose color
of Porcelain and adhesive properly, and finish the margins on the tooth, the
line will not be visible beyond 1-3 inches away.

It seems pretty obvious to me that we differ in our methods of restoring
some teeth.  Considering that we all went to different dental schools,
grew up in different parts of the country, and practice in very
different settings, that doesn't surprise me.

AC may be thinking 'we' take a large, coarse diamond and whack back
a molar with a 1+mm shoulder prep all the way around the tooth.
'We' may think he's trying to bond a large onlay onto a flat chunk
of tooth with a bit of the ML cusp standing.

The truth is that we have all been restoring teeth for over 20 years.
We have adapted what we learned in dental school, subsequent seminars,
and real life practice to find dependable, long lasting methods to
repair decayed and fractured teeth.

AC loves his Cerec.  I'm pretty fond of composite, and SB &amp; I both
like 'conventional crowns' for many cases.

If our methods have proven to be successful over years of actual use,
arguing over Physics that we cannot ourselves prove, may be of little
practical use and may even point to something within the quoted Physics
that may not apply.

I understand the upper first pre-molar is the most common tooth to be

Now that I've come home from work I can participate.  I can say that I
understand why you prefer to do an inlay/onlay over a crown.  I remember
hearing Ray Bertolotti speak last year and he says he also does them most of
the time as the bonding systems nowadays are so much better.  I've done lots
of inlay/onlays myself (empress, not cerec, but some also in gold).  But
what about if you can't control moisture?  What if that distal margin is a
bit subgingival?  No way, an inlay/onlay not a better choice, IMO in these
cases.  Better a conventional crown, and a cemented (ie. not bonded) one at
that.

I can always control moisture.  It is just is a question as to whether or
not it is worth it.

For teeth such as you describe, I place a dead soft band and wedge (if there
is a neighbor tooth), or simply tighten well to keep gingival fluids off the
prep.  So long as the patient does not have tardive diskinesia or some other
disorder where they cannot keep their tongue still, it is never a problem.
Occasional cases get laser treatment to lower tissue height and control
seepage.

I do these all day long with sub-gingival margins.  They do fine.  I am
getting up to do one right now.  Distal margin on a first molar is 2-3 mm
sub-gingival.

That has to be tricky, but I deal with those issues when placing
posterior composites too.  Though it seems like that would be harder
when bonding the onlay with a band in place.

Do you have any insurance hassles when you submit for an MOB
onlay instead of a crown?

I think that sometimes we are biased by the results of our own
techniques.  By this I mean that the clinical sequellae of what we've
done in the past often reinforces our restorative decisions.
The biggest example that comes to mind to me is the use of amalgams.
If we are in a fairly working class environment, proximal caries often
gets restored as amalgam (or resin, but I don't have the years of
experience here to comment).  So after years and years of doing this,
you can imagine I have seen a lot of upper premolars with old MOD
amalgams where either the B or P cusps have fractured.  More often than
not, the fracture is close to or under the gingival margin.  Even
someone as thick as I am knows what this means--I have pushed the
restorative material past the point at which I can reasonably expect it
to work well.  The result is a lot of upper premolar (and other!) crowns
with subgingival margins.  I may have saved patients a fee with the
amalgam, but there's always a piper to be paid.
Looked at this way, your greater use of onlays doesn't look like an
extravagance--it looks like a good long-term clinical decision based
solely on my experience.  My biggest objection is that in patients with
high caries rate, I am not thrilled about giving them restoration with
miles of supragingival margins.  But even so, the example I've given you
of the upper premolar with the too-wide MOD may very well be in a
patient who is no longer a high decay risk.  Clearly there is something
to be said for case selection, and especially onlaid restorations in
cases where I (perhaps shortsightedly) will place a large amalgam.
