I recently ordered and received HP's new
HP50g having previously used HP49G+, the
HP41CV, and the HP12C. Comparison will be
made mostly to the recent HP49G+. I'm hoping
my own review of the HP50G will help someone
else, just as some things I've read about
the HP50G on this group have helped me.
I have to say that, just as I'd hoped and
just as others on the list have indicated,
the HP50G is impressive and definitely a
worthwhile upgrade to the HP49G+.
Out of the box, the 50G is a bit heftier
than the 49G+. It's solid, has a good grip,
and has returned to traditional HP look and
feel. The colors chosen for the keyboard
are superior to the 49G+ and the contrast is
such that it is easier to see your way around
the keyboard for the key you need. To me it
seems the color scheme makes the the whole
keyboard arrangement look more tidy and
ordered.
The key tactile feedback is soft with a
light click. Gone is the hollow metallic
'clack' of the 49G+ and gone is the 'Key
Click' that I always had turned &quot;ON&quot; on the
49G+ just so I could be sure that the key
had registered. This is a MAJOR headache
relief; the constant overhead of always
keeping one eye on the screen just to be
certain the 49G+ had done what it was told!
I trust the keys - they are softer and do
not have the slight rattle that the 49G+ keys
did when you'd lightly wiggle your finger
over the tops of them. The keys on the 50G
are firm but require a lighter touch to
register - another nice improvement to the
keyboard.
I don't care for the directional keys - I
liked the ones on the 49G+ better. The arrow
keys on the 50G are set a little low, feel
just a bit squishy, and you almost don't
have enough travel in the key to get it to
register ( so it feels ). By the time the
arrow key has registered, the key is almost
down even with the plane of the keyboard. I
am glad I don't use them extensively.
The screen is adequate - this is one thing
I liked on the 49G+ better. Very good contrast
on the 49G+ screen - an almost ideal black
on white display and very easy to read. Though
the 50G has basically the same display - it
seems I can never get the contrast to where
I like. By the time I darken the characters
enough, the screen background begins to
darken from too high a contrast. Lighten the
screen back up and the characters take on a
very slight washed out appearance. This is a
very minor issue and only mentioned in
comparison. I've also read about a certain
tint to the display. I have not really
noticed this - I don't think. If I had not
read about it I certainly would not have
noticed such a tint on the unit I have.
The battery compartment door comes off
much more easily than the 49G's - almost too
easy. Not bad right now since this 50G is
new but... if HP offers replacement battery
covers of a different design or material, I
will definitely consider it.
The manual is a mere brief introduction
but we all know that already and we already
own the AUM pdf available online, don't we?
Overall, if anyone is considering upgrading
from the 49G+ to the 50G - my vote is that
you will not be dissapointed and I wish I
hadn't waited as long as I did. The 50G, to
an HP user (IMO), is solid, likable, and most
importantly, easy to use and is an overall
better experience. Important stuff to those
who use their calcs extensively.
Many claim HP is going downhill and still
make that claim. Consider this; the graphical
calculator market can almost be considered
a niche market - HP could survive with or
without us. Despite that - HP heard the
feedback on the 49G+ and came out with the
HP50G which was a major step in the right
direction that was much appreciated. Any
ideas how much it costs to launch a new
calculator model? Pretty good for a tiny
minority in the market niche of the graphical
calculator users, isn't it?

One thing that surprise me is that, after 4 years of VERY HEAVY field
work, keys and face plate on my HP49G+ seems damage, except the
display cover.  What kind of material are they using for this cover ?
Surprise me  it does not scratch neither looses transparency.   If I
compare it with the new HP50G the last one looks a little &quot;blury&quot; .

The HP50G seems to have bit goldener display than the HP49G+, and I
lke more the old one.  But both are incredible machines.

Yes. What means that laptop is necessary attachment to the calculator.
What means, if I must have laptop with calculator, I don't need
calculator any more. Printing manuals would cost more than calculator
itself if done in Kinko.

My review is on amazon.com. I gave 1 star out of 5. ONLY because of
the lack of manuals.

gone is the 'Key

It's still there...   MODE/Key Click ON/OFF

The HP50g IS an HP49 with a different case.

The 50G is not so much a &quot;new model&quot;
as a cosmetic external makeover of the 49G+
(the last production runs of which had already
contained the redesigned keyboard mechanics,
which is the most significant part of the upgrade),
with a little bit of ROM updating for the
serial port, and the updated power supply.

Early 49G+ production had so damaged HP's reputation
in this product line that there was probably
no other way to stay in business with the same product line
than to change its appearance, call it a new model,
and apparently achieve success in giving people
the impression that it really is,
so much so that users even keep asking
whether programs for 49G+ are compatible with &quot;new&quot; 50G.

Someone showed me a 50G in the same 49G+ external package
(gold keyboard face, etc.), but having the serial port
and four batteries; this ought to prove the point
that it is an incremental hardware upgrade
(a &quot;third generation&quot; 49G+ with added serial port
and power supply upgrade); these modifications also
cost money, as does the updating of advertising,
web sites, materials (manuals), and distribution,
but surely nothing like the expense for an actual &quot;new model,&quot;
and essentially a required investment, to go on selling these at all.

Apparently everything nowadays gets regularly repackaged,
just to keep sales from stagnating, even for everyday products
which really never change --  &quot;As recently as the 1990s,
most package designs were retained for seven or more years.
Now marketing executives say they are constantly planning package overhauls.
The average life of a package before its next makeover is down to two years,
they add...

Laurent Nielly, who heads packaging innovation for Pepsi in North America,
said young people - Pepsi's central audience - have shorter attention spans
than previous generations, so bottles and other containers have to change more often.
Pepsi is experimenting with the designs on its Mountain Dew bottles,
selling aluminum bottles covered in graffiti-like designs
that will be changed 12 times from May to October.&quot;
http://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/10/business/10package.html?ex=13443984...

Since calculators with a High School market are also aimed at those
same people whose attention span is shorter than any previous generation,
it's no wonder that incremental products pop up so frequently,
often with something like a &quot;chevron keyboard&quot; being the major change.

With so short an attention span in the next generation of its stewards,
how will any of the accumulated wisdom of all past human civilization
have any chance to survive?

A few years ago, I saw just how much the marketing people want to do
this.  I was in the grocery store when I noticed one of the orange juice
cartons had a big &quot;NEW&quot; on it.  I thought, what do they mean, NEW?  There
are some things in this world that you don't want to change.  It must drive
the marketing people in the business of selling certain kinds of groceries
crazy.  People don't want NEW milk, eggs, orange juice, pork chops, etc.
They want the same old stuff.

So I looked carefully at the orange juice carton that said &quot;NEW&quot;, in
large letters.  There, in small letters, was the additional word &quot;look&quot;.
The carton had redesigned artwork; it had a &quot;NEW look&quot;.  It wasn't enough
to just change the artwork and allow the customers to notice for
themselves; they had to tell us about it.  They just HAD to use that word,
&quot;NEW&quot;.

Exactly - Thanx. To others, I'm also very aware that the 50G
is just a 49G+ in a jazzed up new package. I own the 49G+
also and I'll say again the 'upgrade' was well worth it. The
cosmetic changes, four batteries, more solid build made it
an entirely new machine, for me anyways. If any of you
have owned and used the 49G+ for a year or two, then you
know what I mean. Freed from the 49G+ keyboard at last -
I got headaches flicking my eyes back and forth all the time
from the screen to the keys just to be sure they registered;
and treating the keys like they were made of glass for fear
they'd break and fall out. Free of the whole flimsy mess. After
reading your responses, I'd still do the same thing over again;
I'd buy the 50G in a heartbeat if it was a choice between the
49G+ and the 50G.
Anyone out there who bought the 50G and owned the 49G+
previously and used it for at least a year? After making the
comparison, would you buy the 50G again if given the choice
or would you just keep the 49G+ and save your money ???

I think every generation does not give the next the respect it deserves;
and as proof I offer the following quotation:

“affluent parents have become role models for luxury and licentiousness,
and have moved far away from caring about whether their children develop
habits of discipline and self-restraint. As a result, young people are
increasingly impudent and have a total disregard of the respect they owe
to themselves and others.”

-Tacitus, A.D. 75

As far as Pepsi goes, their market share and total sales volume is
decreasing. Why should we think one of their marketing people has any
competance?

I have something that's FREE and NEW . . . well, not exactly NEW
but it'd be NEW to YOU. I've got a used HP49G+ looking for a
NEW home. Am I going to sell it? No, I'd feel a little guily about
that so I'm giving it away for FREE.  =)  Sorry folks, a taker has
already been named. I shouldn't bash the 49G+ so hard; I have an
early model and, besides a few missed keystrokes, it's in pretty
good shape and has no broken keys or any of the other 'curses'
I've heard mentioned on the list. I've had pretty good luck with it.
It's going to be leaving soon to a new home with a distant Irish
kinsman who'll put it to good use I know.

Eric Rechlin posted a history of the various production versions
of the 49G+; the original (in both hardware and ROM) was more like
what you describe, the &quot;second generation&quot; was improved,
and the &quot;third generation&quot; was every bit as good as a 50G,
except that it still carried the stigma of the original
product name, and looked just like the same original lousy units,
so now there is, in effect, a &quot;fourth generation&quot; of the 49G+,
with a new name, new color, etc., plus actual small extras like
the serial port (for which no standard commercial cable exists :)
and running on pure USB power when plugged in -- but those have
nothing to do with the contrast that you are noting,
which had already been completely resolved
by the third generation of 49G+,
with which you would no doubt have been every bit as happy.

Your review is a very good summary of what has improved;
the improvements mostly took place just a bit earlier,
though, and were not mainly between the last 49G+ vs. 50G,
but rather somewhere along the time line
between the first and third generations of the 49G+

People still considering whether to buy 49G+,
whether used or left-over unsold inventory,
should therefore know that it's possible to get a good deal,
and to find a perfect 49G+ that's the equivalent of a 50G,
but unfortunately it takes a careful inspection
to discern which 49G+ are the good ones,
which the re-branding as &quot;50G&quot; has solved,
at the same time possibly commanding a premium price.

VERY good point - so I should emphasize that my comparison
was between a '1'st generation' 49G+ and a 50G. No point
in tossing a perfectly functional 49G+ for an equivalent 50G.
My serial was early CN334. I didn't realize that the last
generation of 49G+ was really that good! Thanks for pointing
that out to me . . . if I'd waited a while to buy the 49G+ so that
I'd have the later generation, I could've saved myself a nice
little pile of coin!

What do you think it proves?

Civilizations have risen and fallen, business cycles have
upturns and downturns, the fortunes of individual families
whose well-being has been built through one set of values have often
been squandered by a generation that subsequently lost its values;
it happens again and again, and no doubt Tacitus
was a good observer of where in these cycles
was the society around him at that time.

Today's society is repeating much of it again,
sometimes in new forms,
such as by its increasing ability to modify natural forces,
and its disregard of people possessing less technology,
appreciating only a bit late some of the negative implications
of that arrogance, and some of the deeply ingrained values
of much longer-lasting civilizations that had been well attuned
to their environments.

In the very first sentences of the &quot;Meditations&quot;
by Marcus Aurelius Antoninus, some 100 years after Tacitus,
one can see the good fortunes of exposure to higher values:

From my grandfather Verus I learned good morals
and the government of my temper.

From the reputation and remembrance of my father,
modesty and a manly character.

From my mother, piety and beneficence, and abstinence,
not only from evil deeds, but even from evil thoughts;
and further, simplicity in my way of living,
far removed from the habits of the rich.

&gt; has any competence?
">

Just the mention of that company brings something else to mind,
which came up in a recent public radio discussion,
whose participants supplied the general information I relate below:

Though I have nothing to do with farming, I live in a &quot;farm state,&quot;
and the politics of the relationship between U.S. government and farmers
has very significantly changed in the past few decades.

Before that time, government had evolved to take the role
of purchaser of surpluses in abundant times (thus supporting prices)
and seller in lean times (thus easing shortages), and reportedly
had even made a net profit over time in some of these programs,
as opposed to the &quot;pure welfare&quot; epithet thrown about by some propagandists.

This system worked well enough to stablilize agricultural prices
against the uncertainties of nature, to make farming a decent prospect,
with a stable base of participants to guarantee self-sufficiency
in a most basic necessity of life -- healthy and sufficient food.

Good price levels for the nation's farming communities were not,
however, appealing to certain large industries, which wanted
to drive down the prices of its raw ingredients; among these
were not only producers of more processed foods, but also
certain major soft drink companies, who steadily lobbied
for the dismantling of that system described above,
even though it was certainly none of their business
(or competence), and who eventually got their selfish way,
as often a company or industry with deep pockets can do.

The result has been an ill health of the industry that is the source
of all the final products, and the population which was originally
deeply dedicated to it, in some sense transferring control
to other parties who do not relate as thoroughly to all of its values.

Sometimes there are alarming signs on the horizon; you may have heard
that there has been a precipitous decline and mysterious vanishing
of bees from their hives.  Various potential causes are hypothesized,
including one possibility that the long-practiced off-season feeding
of bees by their human stewards has for years substituted cheaper
corn syrup (nowadays from almost unavoidable genetically engineered corn)
for what evolution had previously equipped bee biology
to handle, and that the long-term effect of this may have sparked
a loss of the ability of healthy bees to find their way
back to their hives, after roaming.  If this sort of human
intervention is actually responsible, it would be yet another
&quot;sorcerer's apprentice&quot; situation, in which a human race
which doesn't yet fully understand what it's dealing with
has intervened too much, knowing too little,
and may have seriously harmed itself as a whole in the process.

The prices of certain particular foods have already been shooting up,
as a result of lowered output due to the need for pollination
by those non-voting yet hard-working bees, upon whose anonymous, unsung
and unseen labor it turns out that modern civilization is dependent.

Who needs terrorists, when a society is inclined to self-destruct by itself,
possibly by a &quot;fallout&quot; of policies and actions based solely
on certain purely narrow financial interests,
in a pattern which also has been repeated throughout human history,
the &quot;Law of unintended consequences.&quot;

July 22, 2007:

&quot;For reasons that are not totally clear to us yet,
we had a set-back in the House Agriculture Committee on Thursday, July 19.
When the committee was finalizing the Farm Bill,
they would not include any additional funds
for research into CCD and other honey bee problems.&quot;

&quot;At the committee meeting, everyone talked about CCD
and the need to do something, but no one wanted to fund it.
At this point, any CCD funding would have to come
from funds that would have gone to someone else.
Rep. Kevin McCarthy of California proposed an amendment
to take $5 million from specialty crops and give to CCD research.
He had no Democratic support and agreed to withdraw it.
Here's some perspective on that amendment:
specialty crops is getting 1600 million dollars in the Farm Bill;
we want just 5 million of that.&quot;

VISALIA, Calif., Feb. 23 - David Bradshaw has endured countless stings
during his life as a beekeeper, but he got the shock of his career
when he opened his boxes last month and found half of his 100 million bees missing.
In 24 states throughout the country, beekeepers have gone through similar shocks
as their bees have been disappearing inexplicably at an alarming rate,
threatening not only their livelihoods but also the production of numerous crops,
including California almonds, one of the nation's most profitable.
&quot;I have never seen anything like it,&quot; Mr. Bradshaw said
from an almond orchard here beginning to bloom.
&quot;Box after box after box are just empty. There's nobody home.&quot;
Beekeepers have fought regional bee crises before,
but this is the first _national_ affliction.

&quot;Disappearing by the billions,
on a worker strike we do not know how to negotiate&quot;

&quot;Huge monocrop farming systems and specialisations,
and the spread of suburbia across natural habitat,
are removing natural diversity.
Bees have been lumped together in the millions,
in a factory farm type environment not so unlike that
of our chickens and other livestock animals.
Many of these bees are transported across several states
to perform pollinations in orchards and farms around the country.
Today they are in contact with substances they shouldn't have to deal with -
pesticides, herbicides, antibiotics, and pollen from genetically modified crops.
Researchers are scrambling to find answers,
and as the spring season is upon us, time is running out.&quot;

&quot;Honey bees, which incidentally are not native to the U.S.
(they were imported for crop pollination),
are tasked with the pollination of approximately one third of all U.S. crops.&quot;

That's one big problem with GM plants, the genes can't be contained.

Consider the effects of the terminator gene cross-pollinated into the

You have some technological news to catch up with.

June 13, 1997 OSAKA, Japan (AP)

The first generation of glowing green mice entered the world this week
in a laboratory in western Japan, after geneticists at Osaka University
injected mouse embryos with the DNA of bioluminescent North American jellyfish.

http://www.geocities.com/Area51/Station/1643/glowmice2.html
http://www.geocities.com/Area51/Station/1643/glowmice.html

The modification of plants has likewise manipulated utterly unrelated
bits of DNA, sometimes even &quot;cross breeding&quot; genes of plants with animals
(or fish), in ways that would never otherwise have appeared on Earth,
and which have had no chance for Darwin's principles to test over time.

Even &quot;natural&quot; events caused by unintended little passengers accompanying
otherwise impossible human voyages has at times caused unanticipated upheavals,
also when occasionally an inventive soul has deliberately introduced
a completely foreign species into an ecosystem to &quot;solve&quot; some problem,
and has wound up creating a much deeper problem.

There is no doubt a potential for positive accomplishments
in the capability of human beings to tinker with such powerful things,
but just as you have noted, where the civilian nuclear sector
is far below the standards of the more responsible U.S. Navy,
often under the narrow impetus of financial (and political)
motives and pressures, the results of irresponsible handling
can be disasters of Chernobyl-like proportions -- or even greater,
considering that modified crops which emit uncontained pollen
may now blanket this entire nation, and make it impossible
to reverse some contamination already out of control,
permanently replacing the original with something
whose long-term effects are completely unknown.

Dire emergencies necessitate urgent action, sometimes suspending
normal controls and restraints, but the financial, political,
and even psychological motivations underlying many activities
which influence ultimate destinies of societies
do not fall into that category.

There was a brief section &quot;Ethics Are Absolute&quot; in a lecture I cited
about engineering in general; unfortunately, ethics (a consequence
of the strength and health of an inner consciousness beyond inspection)
are not absolute in societies where people are not solidly grounded
in a level of deep inward, silent awareness
and connectedness to all life around themselves,
where instead they perceive varying degrees of restricted values,
from experiencing only shallower states of consciousness,
in which state they can not responsibly shoulder
the stewardship of powerful forces of nature,
nor even be trusted to reliably report what's happening.

Yet that's often who is at the helm of the ships of industry,
and of their shepherding mother, the state; good luck to the passengers.

Long, rambling epilog follows.

Ethics Are Absolute [and a very lucky break from Mother Nature]
http://web.archive.org/web/19970705234218/http://www.me.gatech.edu/me...

&quot;Citicorp Center is a 716-foot-tall skyscraper with an innovative bracing system
that allows the building to rest on four massive columns.
The building met all New York City building codes,
including those relating to wind forces. After it was finished,
the engineer in charge of the structural design
decided to use more sophisticated testing procedures
to assess the building's ability to withstand unusual wind forces.
The tests showed that it might, in fact, be subject to failure
in quartering winds of the type that might occur once every 16 years.
Since he was the only person with this knowledge, he had a choice:
Say nothing and hope that such a storm with such severe winds did not occur,
or admit his findings to the building's owner, possibly be sued,
embarrass himself and his company, and even face bankruptcy.
He did exactly the right thing [perhaps worthy of a Congressional
Medal of Honor, the same as issued to outstanding soldiers
who take responsibilty for the welfare of all around them]:
He took his findings to Citicorp's executives and pointed out the problem.

Happily, it was found that structural corrections could be made to the building
which weren't terribly expensive, the changes began immediately, and both
the building and the engineer emerged relatively unblemished by the entire matter.
But the engineer [and Citicorp, and all who work therein, and walk the street below]
were lucky in two important regards: One, there was a newspaper strike in New York
during this entire period of time, and the other was that Hurricane Ella,
which was off Cape Hatteras and headed toward Manhattan,
at the last minute veered out to sea.&quot;

Another random incident in ethics:

Death Points to Risks in Research;
One Woman's Experience in Gene Therapy
http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/08/05/AR200...

The date of the above article happens to be August 6 2007,
the 62nd anniversary of the public's sudden awakening to the atomic age,
by a deliberate detonation over Hiroshima,
which in many ways was just a militarily motivated experiment,
performed on approximately 255,000 subjects.

Wikipedia's article is in some dispute resolution;
FWIW, just to glimpse the range of human feelings behind it,
with all its inherent capriciousness and sometimes wrenching irony,
as well as some faint trace of other values
attempting to penetrate the spiritual gap:

[quote] The Target Committee at Los Alamos on May 10-11, 1945,
recommended Kyoto, Hiroshima, Yokohama, and the arsenal at Kokura
as possible targets. The committee rejected the use of the weapon
against a strictly military objective, because of the chance
of missing a small target not surrounded by a larger urban area.

Hiroshima was chosen because of its large size,
its being &quot;an important army depot&quot;
and the potential that the bomb would cause greater destruction
because the city was surrounded by hills which would have a &quot;focusing effect&quot;.

Hiroshima was one of several Japanese cities left deliberately untouched
by American bombing, allowing an ideal environment to measure the damage
caused by the atomic bomb. Another account stresses that after General Spaatz
reported that Hiroshima was the only targeted city without prisoner of war (POW) camps,
Washington decided to assign it highest priority.

On July 25 General Carl Spaatz was ordered to bomb one of the targets:
Hiroshima, Kokura, Niigata, or Nagasaki, as soon after August 3 as weather permitted
and the remaining cities as additional weapons became available.

The psychological effects on Japan were of great importance to the committee members.
They also agreed that the initial use of the weapon should be sufficiently spectacular
for its importance to be internationally recognized. The committee felt
that Kyoto, as an intellectual center of Japan, had a population
&quot;better able to appreciate the significance of the weapon.&quot;
[except that they would all be dead]

Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson struck Kyoto from the list
because of its cultural significance,
over the objections of General Leslie Groves, head of the Manhattan Project.
According to Professor Edwin O. Reischauer, Stimson
&quot;had known and admired Kyoto ever since his honeymoon there several decades earlier.&quot;

At nearly 08:00 [15 minutes before explosion], the radar operator in Hiroshima
determined that the number of planes coming in was very small,
probably not more than three, and the air raid alert was lifted.
To conserve fuel and aircraft, the Japanese had

You posted a lot that needs to be absorbed.  But just because we are
better at tampering with nature doesn't necessarily mean we are more
dangerous. Did the people that started cross pollination and cross
breeding worry more about the unintended consequences than we do
today?  Forcing things to breed creates things that nature never would
have created.  The mule is sterile.  That animal would never have
survived without man.  Interesting that you mentioned the atomic
bomb.   The scientists feared that they might start a chain reaction
that would &quot;ignite&quot; the atmosphere, because of a hypothetical fusion
reaction of nitrogen nuclei. How is that for an unintended
consequence?

As for profit and politics being motivators of science, hasn't that
always been true too?

Man will ALWAYS tinker with nature.  That is -our- nature.  Some do it
for fame, or profit, or politics, but many do it to help mankind.
Where do we draw the line?

PS If you think things are bad now wait until we start playing with
human genetics.  Now THAT is scary ;)

I like Sharp EL-5100. Best calculator ever designed, however  with
some limited functionality (well, this was year 1979...). What regards

EL-506 is pretty much continuation of EL-5100, but ergonomically much

expensive then the printed advanced manuals should be available to
order.  The cost of printing out 1500 or so pages on a laser or inkjet
printer is as much or more than the cost of the calculator.

You refer to engineering embryos before birth, but it's already underway
in genetic treatment of adults, sometimes fatally (I posted one example).

I'm glad you see the need to do something about the future.

&gt; Forcing things to breed creates things that nature never would

You have identified the safety factor that has heretofore
limited genetic tinkering to very small, compatible steps,
solely by breeding or grafting (plants);
new tools have removed all &quot;safety interlocks,&quot;
and suddenly opened a &quot;pandora's box.&quot;

&gt; Interesting that you mentioned the atomic bomb.
&gt; The scientists feared that they might start a chain reaction
&gt; that would &quot;ignite&quot; the atmosphere, because of a hypothetical fusion
&gt; reaction of nitrogen nuclei. How is that for an unintended consequence?
">

And did they evaluate it very carefully before proceeding?

Pretty soon they got hydrogen fusion going, however,
considerably upping the destructive &quot;megatonnage,&quot;
but not yet finding any non-destructive application.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; As for profit and politics being motivators of science,
&gt; hasn't that always been true too?
">

It is when human awareness narrows to consider only a part
of all implications that human decisions lose quality;
the very fact of having a less developed, less matured,
less stable inward self also reduces the aptness of one's desires and goals.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Man will ALWAYS tinker with nature.  That is -our- nature.
&gt; Some do it for fame, or profit, or politics,
&gt; but many do it to help mankind.  Where do we draw the line?
">

The best that society knows how to do is to require some education,
a certain age or qualification before smoking, voting, drinking, driving,
shooting, or combinations thereof (or driving while using a cell phone,
or innumerable narrowly-targeted regulations in all spheres of life,
responding to one single situation at a time); it has yet to capture the essence
of how to increase the depth and stability of human awareness,
of its own consciousness, at a more fundamental level,
to make itself more ready and responsible overall
to handle its technological capabilities,
including its relatively recently acquired ability
to rapidly destroy itself and its habitat, both locally and globally,
which in its unacknowledged immaturity it tends to do,
more than to use it only for genuine benefit.

Selecting just two quotations to represent volumes of similar expression:

&quot;It has become appallingly obvious that our technology
has exceeded our humanity.&quot; - Albert Einstein (1879-1955)

&quot;The means by which we live
has outdistanced the ends for which we live.
Our scientific power has outrun our spiritual power.
We have guided missiles and misguided men.&quot;
[Martin Luther King Jr]

The schools and organization with which I am associated
feel that the lost element is restorable,
by something as simple as having the superficial mind become quiet,
spontaneously opening its deeper levels to its own awareness.

Physics sees the entire diversity of the material world
emanating from few fundamentals; so does the science
of human consciousness see all its diverse experiences
emanating from more fundamental levels,
which anyone can learn to personally experience,
the mere direct experience of which
is profoundly nourishing to life, at its root.

Outward complexity, inward simplicity.

For what?... Amplifier on vacuum tubes sounds much better than
