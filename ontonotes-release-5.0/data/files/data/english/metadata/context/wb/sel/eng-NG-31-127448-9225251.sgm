Whenever we do not have a detailed explanation for the cause of the
universe due to naturalistic causes, we can always invoke the &quot;science
is working on it&quot; of the gaps theory. It's better than saying that the
check is in the mail.

Yes, yes. But apart from the obvious...

It's like automobile maintenance of the gaps. A hypothetical J. McC.
is driving along in his nice shiny automobile when it breaks down
suddenly. J. McC. doesn't know anything about maintaining automobiles,
but can't admit that there are things that he doesn't know. As a
result, he must conclude that God disabled his vehicle for reasons
unknown, and that figuring out how to fix it would go against God's
wishes. So J. McC. sits there in his broken-down car, going nowhere.
More rational people might be inclined to find out what was wrong, to
get it fixed, and to be on their way. But J. McC. sits there, going
nowhere.

It's certainly better than just making up an answer and clinging to
it dogmatically long after the evidence has shown it to be wrong.

Yes.  Were you under the impression that science already knew
everything that science could discover?  Ought scientists have stopped
trying to figure out what lightning was, back when they were close to
clueless and the church had a perfectly satisfactory explanation (i.e.
lightning was a manifestation of the wrath of God)?  How long do
scientists have to work on a problem, before you get to declare that
the true answer is found in your theology?

Yes, it would be much better and more honest if every time
scientists encountered a question they couldn't yet answer
they simply assumed Goddidit and didn't attempt to study the
question any further.

&quot;Why are there diseases?&quot; &quot;Goddidit.&quot;
&quot;Why do some diseases run in families?&quot; &quot;Goddidit.&quot;
&quot;Why can't we grow more food and keep more people from
starving?&quot; &quot;Goddidit.&quot;
&quot;How can we better learn about the weather and warn people
about bad storms?&quot; &quot;Goddidit.&quot;
&quot;How do humans relate to the rest of the creatures on Earth,
and how can we take advantage of that to help more people?&quot;
&quot;Goddidit.&quot;

Yes, using &quot;Goddidit&quot; to shut off inquiry into uncomfortable
questions is certainly the Christian way to go...

It's difficult to parody something this stupid.  Are you saying
scientist should not try to learn new things?  Or that they should

Question for you John.

You arrive home and find your house has been burgled. You ring the
police, who subsequently arrive and confirm the crime has ocurred. You
ask them if they know who did it and they respond: no, we need to do
some investigation first.

Do you;

1.  Ask them not to bother any further, as in the absence of an
immediate definitive explanation the only remaining conclusion is that
God did it?

Or

2. Feel a bit embarrassed at asking such a silly question so early in
the piece, and hope that an investigation will indeed uncover the
culprits, even if it takes some time?

Of course scientists shouldn't do this.  They should lay claim to being
omniscient and any time they don't know the answer just fill in with a handy

&quot;Reports that say that something hasn't happened are always interesting to
me because as we know, there are known knowns; there are things we know we

There is a difference between &quot;science is working on it&quot; and &quot;the ways
of God are mysterious&quot; as classes of explanation. That being, science
_does_ work on unsolved problems. If you ask nicely you can probably
go in person and watch it happening at a university near you. Or you
can glance at one of the many journals which give detailed reports of
how the process is going.

If this seems too vague for you, you can look at science's track
record. How many people in your grandfather's generation died of
measles or mumps or whooping cough? Since those evil ungodly science
vaccines came in, how many people die from those diseases today?
Science claims it can put complex satellites in orbit -- if they're
lying, why do so many of your neighbors have Dish TV or DirecTV?

The 'mysteries of God' approach, on the other hand, is used to tackle
questions like &quot;why do bad things routinely happen to good people?&quot; or
&quot;How can God be _both_ omnipotent and not at all responsible for any
of the evil in the world?&quot;  How are those coming along for you?

As opposed to your religion which makes up the answers and says it knows
all. Of course, it has said this many times and science has exposed the

The problem is not that theists posit a God who created the universe
as we find it. If that were the case we'd hardly have anything to
argue over. I think that the &quot;ultimate cause of everything&quot; is likely
beyond human capability to discover. The very concept of an &quot;ultimate
cause&quot; may just be an artifact of how our brains work.

An enduring unknown like this is ripe for speculation and wonder. It
doesn't bother me that some people's speculation takes the form of a
single omnipotent being.

The problem is that many theists cling to a vision of God that
requires a universe that is radically different than the one we live
in, and would bowdlerize the science that my daughter is taught in
school to conform with their theology.

It may well be that God has disabled the vehicle perhaps to get some
guy to have to link up with another.

No. You find an automobile mechanic. Because the car was rationally

existence.

That is correct, more rational peopple are inclined to find out what
was wrong and to get it fixed.  Unrational people think that a fix is
a matter of a good mutation happing along the way to help out. But
rational people ask a rational God for wisdom and then apply their
intelligence to solve a matter. And of course they read the Bible
which tells us not to be &quot;simple&quot; minded. Look up the word simple in a
good Bible concordance and you will find many references. The Bible
also tells us to seek council and that there is wisdom in numbers.
While you may decry asking God for help all I can say, for me,
personally, why not?  It's helped out in the past.
