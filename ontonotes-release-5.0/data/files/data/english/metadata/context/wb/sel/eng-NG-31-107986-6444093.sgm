I had a really similar idea!  My first brew of 2006 was a medium IPA
(OG 1.052)  I made a 1 liter starter of Wyeast 1099, and had a very
fast and active fermentation.  I'm planning on racking this to the
secondary on Friday, and brewing up a high gravity red ale to put on
top of this big, healthy yeast cake.

Big Red

9 pounds of Light DME
2 pounds of either CaraRed (if I can find it locally, no time to mail
order) or 20L Crystal
1 pound of dark brown sugar.

I haven't exactly figured out what I'm going to do with the hops yet.
I'm thinking:

3 ozs Northern Brewer Pellets @ 60
1 oz East Kent Goldings @ 30
1 oz Fuggles or more Kent Goldings at flame out.

I'll then run it through my counterflow chiller into the bottling
bucket to give the temperature a chance to equalize while I rack batch
#1 from the primary into the secondary... then open the spigot on the
bottling bucket and pour this on the 1099 yeast cake in the primary
carboy.  I think this one will need a blow-off tube.

Any suggestions w/r/t the recipe?

Thanks!

Bob

Sounds like it might be good.  I would suggest cutting the
CaraRed/Crystal 20 back to only a pound to avoid getting too many
unfermentables in the beer.  I don't know if the sugar will be enough to
balance that out.

Your pitching strategy sounds good.  I normally just rack during the
boil.  I pop the airlock back into the carboy until I'm ready to run the
cooled wort into it.  Just one less chance for contamination that way.
I'm always a little afraid of those bottling bucket spigots, especially
pre-fermentation.

That's a very good suggestion.  Only thing is, if Bob is truly trying to
make an Imperial Red, it isn't going to be red at all, with or without the
CaraRed/Crystal 20.  Bob, you'll definitely want to add about 4 oz roasted
barley to give you the red color you want as well as a hint of roasted
dryness.  Otherwise, looks tasty!

Thanks for the replies!  I will cut back the Crystal to 1 lb, and I
ended up buying Crystal 60 instead of 20.  I don't sparge my specialty
grains after steeping them, so I tend to use a little bit more than the
recipies call for.  I didn't get a chance to brew this past weekend,
but I hope to this weekend coming up.

The reason I wanted to transfer to the bottling bucket first is that I
wanted to give the wort temp a chance to equalize before adding it to
the yeast cake in my primary carboy.  I am afraid that if I run it
straight from the brew pot through the CF chiller into the primary
fermenter that the first bit of wort that makes it into the fermenter
might be too hot for the yeast cake.

I suppose I could go the other direction, and pour the yeast slurry out
of the primary into a sanitized jar, then transfer the wort, then add
the yeast slurry back in...  but that seems like more work, and more
chance for contamination.

Hmmm... perhaps I should do a partial wort boil reserving one gallon of
water.  I could add that one gallon of water to the fermenter prior to
transferring the wort through the CF chiller.  That probably would act
as a sort of temperature buffer

Back when I used an immersion chiller, I used to pitch on top of the
pervious yeast cake all the time, but this is the first time I've
thought about doing it since switching to a DF chiller.  I really like
the CF chiller, but it has really made me change or re-think a lot of
my technique--a lot more than I would have thought it would have.

Thanks,

Bob
