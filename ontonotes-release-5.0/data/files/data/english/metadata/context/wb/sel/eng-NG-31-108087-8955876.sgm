Since when have turn signal indicators become an option on cages?

I am overwhelmed by the number of cages I see, on a daily basis, which,
apparently,  do not have turn signals, as they make no indication of whether
they are going right, straight, left or changing lanes. It is an amazing
occurrence. So when did auto makers quit including them as standard
equipment?

It's like a f**king video game out there.

Most Americans are far too important to actually *drive,* man.
They've got phone calls to take/make, eggamuffins to eat, coffee
that's at that &quot;just right&quot; temperature, GPS monitoring, make-up to
apply, nicotine fixes, etc. Turn signals and paying attention just get
in the way of all that other *important* stuff that they gotta do. The
*airbags* will take care of all that secondary stuff...

It's akin to the mentality of drivers that have pavement colored cars
and do not use headlights during the day.( I can see just fine during
the day, why should I turn on my headlights?) With turn signals it's (I
know I'm turning so why should I make the effort of moving my hand over
to the blinker lever?).
An awful lot of these drivers are of the female persuasion, which leads
me to believe that the silver lining in a moslem take over of western
civilization would be improved driving conditions.

LOL! I just found this.

The three-position Lucas switch--DIM, FLICKER and OFF. The other three
switch settings--SMOKE, SMOLDER and IGNITE.

I have experienced ALL of these switch settings, without turning the knob.

Believe me, there's nothing like having your electrical harness catch on
fire, under your seat, when you're loaded up and heading out to Oregon at
5:00 in the morning. I don't think I ever moved so fast in my life. This is
a true story.

As I remember L.A., if you ever signalled your intent
to change lanes, the bozo in the next lane would
immediately speed up to make sure you couldn't
get in ahead of him.

Usually worked best if you signalled in the opposite

Never trust your life to a flashing light.  A non-signal does not necessarily
mean the vehicle will continue straight, and a flashing signal certainly doesn't
mean the vehicle is going to turn.

&quot;Oh, No!! (quoted from the above link):

It has been noted that Lucas components are possibly more prone to
electrical leakage than Bosch or generic Japanese electrics. Experts
point out that this is because Lucas is British and all things British
leak. British engines leak oil, shock absorbers, hydraulic forks and
disk brakes leak fluid, *British tyres leak air* and the British
defense establishment leaks secrets...so, naturally, British electrics
leak smoke.&quot;

Where's that, then?  Not any state I know of.  Certainly not in mine -- the
way the ordinances are worded, you can indeed score a citation for failure
to signal, even if you're the only vehicle for miles around.  A moment's

I got pulled over once for failure to signal when I was at a light in
the left turn (ONLY) lane in the City of Southside Place or West
University TX. Worst part of it was I was balancing a case of Bud on my
gas tank and left my wallet at the party I was headed back to. Luckily
the LEO believed me when I told him my driver's license number and it
was clean. Gave me a warning which I am afraid I have not heeded.

Must have been right after they stopped including ashtrays.

Thumper was talking about California and so was I.

http://www.dmv.ca.gov/pubs/vctop/d11/vc22107.htm

Turning Movements and Required Signals
22107.  No person shall turn a vehicle from a direct course or move right or
left upon a roadway until such movement can be made with *reasonable safety*
and then only after the giving of an appropriate signal in the manner
provided in this chapter in the event any other vehicle *may* be affected by
the movement. Amended Ch. 1996, Stats. 1959. Effective September 18, 1959.

So, here comes Thumper on his V-Rod, overtaking the 40-ton 18-wheeler at 90
mph and the trucker has to move over one lane to the left to keep from going
onto a ramp that takes him to Sacramento instead of Simi Valley.

And Thumper is so-o-o-o inconvenienced by the fact that the trucker doesn't
seem him coming as Thumper darts from lane to lane to get to the ramp that
take him to the Hollywood freeway.

Is the trucker really supposed to be watching his rear view mirrors for
reckless idiots and trying to figure out which side they're going to pass on,
or is highway safety really up to the overtaking rider?

Is all commerce on California freeways supposed to make way for Thumper and
protect him from his own foolhardy riding?

He wouldn't have any problems if he would just slow down to a prudent speed
where he's overtaking the truck at only 10 mph faster than the truck is
allowed to go.

Truckers are professionals who work on the highway and they are courteous and
give signals whenever they think they are needed. But how can they predict
what a Thumper is going to do?

&gt;&gt; It's like a f**king video game out there.

&gt; As I remember L.A., if you ever signalled your intent
&gt; to change lanes, the bozo in the next lane would
&gt; immediately speed up to make sure you couldn't
&gt; get in ahead of him.

&gt; Usually worked best if you signalled in the opposite
&gt; direction from the one you intended to move in.
">

When I've got a bozo hanging in either blind spot, I'll put on the turn
signal on that side so he speeds up and gets out of there.  Works
surprisingly well.  I really like it at night to get those headlights
out of my mirror.

I was behind a kid making a left turn this past week.  He must have had a
stick as he couldn't make the turn while talking on his cell, going so
wide he had to nearly stop to change his turn radius.  I educated him a
little bit with my horn.
