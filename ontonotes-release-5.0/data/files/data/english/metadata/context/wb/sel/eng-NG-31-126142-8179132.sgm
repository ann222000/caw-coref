I was goofing around with the new snare drum tonight,  and switched
the hoops to die cast. In order to hear I recorded a bit of playing
through the Mackie into Sonar. The drum sounds pretty good, in all
honesty. So I recorded a drum part to a Steve Perry tune (no previous
drum track), and mixed it down. It came out alright, though it was
pretty tough to match the effects on the album. I also mixed the snare
a tad hot, to hear how it sounds. As an engineer, I make a good
drummer...

But I was very pleased to hear how good the cross-stick sounds. I
would post an MP3, but I don't have any web space available right at
the moment. Anyone have any ideas where I can put the thing? The file
is just under 4 MB.

Thanks.

It looks like that's only for e-mailing LARGE files to known
recipients, not posting to a website.

I am looking into the whole MySpace thing--they have artist profiles
that apparently include the ability to upload music. However they
don't like it when you upload music that you didn't originally record,
so I may not be able to use that.

I guess I might just have to look at using the space we get with our
high-speed provider. It might be worthwhile though, if nothing else
just because I would like the feedback from some of the group
regarding the sound of the drums in the mix, effects, etc. A few of
the guys here are pretty well accomplished in that arena.

Thanks Bill...

Damn Bill...you were right. Sorry, too early here!

Playing around with it, I was able to upload it--I had tried before
but it tried to open it as an HTML file. But if you just select &quot;Save
As&quot; and let it retain the .mp3 extension, you can play it from the
desktop after the download. I am listening to it now. So here's the
link:

http://www.driveway.com/mijdz14453

Have a go at it. The tune is from &quot;Missing You&quot; Steve Perry's second
solo album. There were no drums originally so I may have overplayed it
a bit, but it's nice to hear the drums with some effects. This is the
third take and I &quot;mixed&quot; the tune (and I use that term rather loosely)
in Sonar for about an hour before arriving at this version. Although
there are some warts, it was fun. But let's just say that my learning
curve regarding sound engineering and recording is rather steep...

Very nice job, Tom.  Your time locked in nicely with the original
drumless track...it's not always easy to stay in the pcoket on these
types of lazy mid-tempos.

Yes, I agree ... the die-cast hoops are sounding tasty with the cross-
stick.  The snare sounds good overall too; on a tune like this I
usually prefer a fatter, wider sounding snare, to give the track more
weight.  I think I would've tuned it just a tad lower and maybe
loosened the snares a bit, to see how that timbre might sit in the
track.  But that's a good sounding drum you've got there.

Actually, you played tastily and solid, IMHO.  I dug the tom sounds
you got -- perfect for that tune.  Sounds like you had fun.  Keep
bashin' !

Thanks Kevin!

Well, I think I might like to hear the drum with wood hoops on it, but
all-in-all I had only played it for about an hour before I recorded
that. I just got it via Fed-Ex yesterday, and after playing it only
about 15-20 minutes I changed out the triple-flanged hoop to the
diecast hoops from a Gretsch snare (thanks Jay!) that I haven't been
playing  much lately. I am not sure if I like the diescast hoops
better or not. I think Pat is playing his with CDB and we are going to
hear them tomorrow--so we'll see how his sounds miked.

I was having fun with Sonar when I recorded that track. I simply
placed loop markers at the beginning and end of the tune and let it
loop. I think that was the second take. I tell you the power of these
DAW programs is simply incredible for what you pay. Just playing
around with the track for an hour in Sonar, I was able to get some
fairly decent effects on the kit. I may spend a little more time to
see if I can get it to blend a bit more nicely--it's a neat learning
exercise, if nothing else.

Your playing sounds great, particularly the subtle hi-hat work.  As
far as the mix goes, in addition to the snare being a bit loud (as you
mentioned), the bass drum could have been louder.  On my small
computer speakers, it was barely audible.  Overall, though, the
recording sounds good, particularly for an experiment.

Thanks for checking it out...

You know, I almost think there might be an issue with the kick channel
in my board; or with the peak light, more specifically. I agree with
you--the level is low. But if I set the pre-amp gain where it needs to
be to get a hot enough level...then the clip light comes on! I do not
hear any distortion however, and the waveform *seems* to be of the
proper amplitude in SONAR. But the damn idiot light perplexes me a
bit. It's hitting peak (according to the light on the channel) on
nearly every kick note. I am using an Audix D6 by the way, but I
suppose I could back the mic off a tad. I think it's about 10 inches
from the batter head (inside the kick) now.

I do have another D6 on the 16&quot; drum, and I have tried swapping the
two--but get the exact same issue. The peak light comes on. I guess as
long as it doesn't distort, it's  probably OK. I will try to remix the
tune a bit, and maybe EQ the snare. There's only reverb and a tad bit
of compression on it now. As I mentioned, I am trying to learn the art
of recording drums and the slope of the learning curve is quite steep
on certain days. And I really only played around for about an hour
last night, so there is certainly room for improvement.

One cool thing is the automation in SONAR. On this tune the
cross-stick sounds were too soft and so when I turned them up to the
proper level, the snare was HONKING, lol. So I simply automated the
fader control and voila--0db threshold on the crossstick and -6db on
the snare hits. Man, taking the time to learn this software was one of
the best things I ever did.

Check out this version of the first cut I posted. I didn't record it
again, but I spent a couple hours shaving warts at the DAW tonight. I
think it sounds a bit better. I didn't want to boost the kick too
much, but I did apply EQ to all the drums and tweaked the reverb on
most tracks as well. I also normalized some of the tom waveforms a
little bit (+/- 3db).

I think the snare sounds a bit more &quot;fat,&quot; although it still doesn't
have looser snares of course.

I don't see how I can do much more with it, given that I only have the
standard effects that come with the Producer Edition of Sonar.

Tom,

Nice work.
Toms nice &amp; lively
You laid it (groove) in there nice without uneccsecary fluff.
I'm late to the party on your new snare but as a &quot;late arriving critic&quot; I
see a lot of neutrality in the snare sound. Meaning it could have been a
nice Rogers Dynasonic or 6&quot; wood shell TAMA or Pearl Maple.......whatever...

Sadly , that translates to the mix,Room, mics,processing

No sweat...it might be nice experiment. I actually have an 8&quot; Gretsch
wood snare I bought from Jay Epstein a few years back--it might be a
nice snare to try on this track. I actually took the diecast hoops off
it and put them on the Steve Ferrone snare, but am not convinced that
the SF snare sounds better that way. I will likely get some maple
hoops for that snare and just put the diecast hoops back on the
Gretsch.

I did spend some time re-mixing the tune last night. I posted another
version, and here's the link:

http://www.driveway.com/qgkdx50134

Check that one out. It's the same drum track(s), but the levels are
adjusted and most of the individual tracks now have been EQd to some
degree. I think the snare sounds better now, but of course it's still
the same drum.

Thanks for the post.

Tom,

What a great way to work on both your playing *and* engineering. I'm into
both, and I love experimenting and honing the recording process. Must have a
been a lot of fun.

*Really* nice playing. As someone else said, that's a hard tempo/feel to
nail, and you sound great on it.

I listened to both takes, but I'm commenting on the second take. You did a
nice job on the drum sounds. My only complaint is that the snare is louder
than the lead vocal. It's taking my attention away from the lead vocal, at
times. Just pull it back a hair and get it to sit just under the vocal in
the mix.

Again, GREAT job overall. I recently got a Presonus FireStudio and have been
itching to do some recording. I haven't had a chance to really sit down to
mic and eq the drums the RIGHT way (or at least to the best of my ability),
but if I could just get a &quot;round tuit&quot;, I'd be in business.

Keep up the good work,
CM

Wow Chris, great compliments...coming from a guy with playing
credentials such as yours. I appreciate it!

You are correct about the snare level--it is too loud. That's the
purpose of the experiment (or that's how it started out anyway), to
hear the snare on tape. But the snare is too loud in the mix, for all
practical purposes. Basically I over-EQ'd it, and now the level is too
honking. Easily fixed for the most part.

Now that I listen back to it, I actually don't like the second take as
much as I thought I did. I think the effects are a bit overstated. But
it was indeed just an exercise, so maybe by hearing that now...the
exercise was valuable and I am actually learning something? I'd like
to think so anyway. I would encourage anyone truly interested in
becoming a better drummer to record themselves and pick their playing
apart. Not to obsess about each and every note, but (among other
reasons) to gain an appreciation of how a tune should be structured
and how the drums really fit into that structure. I guess that's the
value of a good producer--someone who sees the big picture in the
tune, and how each instrument fits into that sonic picture.

Thanks again Chris.
