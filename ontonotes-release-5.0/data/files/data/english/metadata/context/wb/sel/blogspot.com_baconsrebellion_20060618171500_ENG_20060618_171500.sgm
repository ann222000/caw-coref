Before anyone other than The Great Fuzz Ball goes off and says "See,
I told you so!" concerning today’s WaPo story on job growth between in
the National Capital Subregion let us all take a deep breath.

"Region’s Job Growth a Centrifugal Force" reports that COG found the
R=20 plus jurisdictions gained 78,097 jobs vs 94,847 jobs for those
outside R= 20. That 16,750 job difference is just 0.7 of one percent of
the 2.4 million jobs COG projected to be inside R=20 by 2025.

The growth of 94,847 jobs puts the "outer" jurisdictions well on the
way to the 230,000 jobs that were projected by 2025 in this territory
but that rate of growth still brings the "outer" areas up to less than
10 percent of the Subregions total jobs inside R=20 at that time. For a
summary of these issue see "Where the Jobs Are," 24 May 2004 at
www.baconsrebellion.com

Besides the small percentage of the Subregion’s jobs this "news"
focuses on also consider:

How many of these jobs are construction jobs on housing and
residential service projects that will be going away when the buildings
are completed? (Have you checked the trajectory of big house prices or
how long units are staying on the market in the past six months?)

How many of these jobs are low paying service jobs supported by those
with good jobs closer to the centroid (aka, in the "Core") that have no
time to mow their grass, care for their children or even walk their dog?

These are 2000 to 2005 numbers, as Larry Gross points out in his
posting on the Gas Shock thread, $4.00 gasoline is going to change
"everything."

One fact is very clear: As of last week, employers were paying twice
the rent per square foot for "Class A" places for employees near the
centroid and within R=10 as they were in the R=20 to R=30 Radius Band.
The latest wage numbers say that is true for the per month earnings as
well.

Encouraging new job creation outside R=20 or R=25 (most of the new
jobs in both Loudoun and Prince William are within R=25) is a good thing
but only as long as those jobs contribute to creating a balance of J / H
/ S / R / A in Greater Culpeper / Culpeper, Greater Warrenton / Fauquier
and other Disaggregated Communities outside the Clear Edge.

The WaPo article says that the "move-out-trend" is supported by the
military job move to Ft. Belvoir. Ft Belvoir is just outside R=10, not
beyond R=20. How soon the WaPo folks forget the radius map published
just 8 days ago.

To its credit the reporter notes that there is a growing consensus
that there should be a jobs / housing balance (a J / H / S / R / A
Balance) and compact settlement patterns.

The story suggests that the state and municipal agencies continue to
do a terrible job of fairly allocating location variable costs and of
creating functional, balanced settlement patterns.

OK, so they are paying twice the rent.

Tell me, are they making twice the profit?

If so, is it because they have "cost plus" government contracts at
our expense?

By the way, who is "the Great Fuzzball"?

Isn't the whole point of the article that the "growing consensus" for
compact development is a consesus mainly among planners and largely
ignored by everyone else?

"Fairfax County has emerged as the largest jurisdiction in the
Washington metropolitan area as measured by the number of residents and
at-place employment. The value of goods and services produced in the
County—the County’s economy—exceeded the value of goods and services
produced in the District of Columbia, the region’s historic economic
center, in 2002 and is projected to grow at a rate more than triple the
District’s economic growth rate over the 2000-2020 period."

Ed makes a valuable distinction between construction/service jobs,
which serve the bedroom-community economy, and "good jobs" closer to the
core. The high-paying, "good," jobs tend to be associated with what
economists refer to as "primary" industries -- industries that bring
money into the region (as opposed to "secondary" construction, retail
and other service jobs that merely recirculate money within the region).

Northern Virginia's largest industry cluster is in information
technology and telecommunications. The logic that drives the locational
decisions of ITT companies is considerably different from the logic that
drives the location of a construction company, a J.C. Penney's store or
a McDonalds. ITT companies require a workforce with a high level of
education and training, and very specific skill sets, and their location
decisions are driven in part by a desire to maximize the size of their
potential hiring pool. Let us look where those companies are locating.
They are clustering in specific locations such as Arlington, Tysons
Corner, Reston/Herndon and so on, where they can be accessible by the
widest range of potential employees possible.

Building on Stephen Fuller's remarks above, I would argue that
Fairfax County is emerging as a new centroid for the ITT economy,
bifurcating from Washington, D.C., which remains the centroid for the
government/lobbying/trade association economy.

(There may be three centroids if you consider the biotech industry in
Maryland, but I'm not very familiar with that region so I will not
speculate.)

Such an observation departs somewhat from Ed's idea -- I'm just
thinking out loud right now --that the R=10 (Radius equals 10 miles) and
R=20 should be drawn from the center of Washington, D.C. Perhaps the
radius for the government-centric economy should be drawn from downtown
Washington while the radius of the ITT economy should be drawn from
Tysons Corner.

But I would argue that Ed is entirely right to observe that the most
important jobs -- the jobs that drive economic growth -- concentrate in
the center of the relevant labor market. He is also right to observe
that the job creation on the periphery of the Washington New Urban
Region is qualitatively different than the job creation closer to the
center.

Roughly half the jobs in the economy are in the
construction/retail/local service sector. It is no surprise when these
jobs follow the population as it migrates to the periphery of the New
Urban Region. But from my observation, the ITT jobs are staying close to
the Fairfax County core.

I agree. To better understand, we need to differentiate between
source jobs and jobs that would not exist except for the source jobs.

I'd posit that even more than half of total jobs are.. jobs that
exist to serve the goods and services needs of those who hold the core
jobs. A lot of government jobs ranging from code inspectors,
fire/rescue, and teachers also exist because of the "core" jobs -
because of the children that belong to both the core job employees AND
the service-sector employees.

These jobs are clearly delineated often times when the economic
development folks "sell" the idea of attracting such core industries
because of their "spin-off" jobs.

The other aspect of this that I feel is even less understood is how
much a particular job PAYS verses how much an average priced home is -
in the area adjacent to where that person works.

So, even a core job in the DC Area that pays less than what it takes
to afford a modest home - will result in yet another commuter who will
drive as far as they have to - to find a home that they can afford on
their salary.

And of course the folks who have jobs that are service jobs related
to the core jobs most often are paid even less and have even less
opportunity to find nearby affordable housing.

All of this - I assert - is a major cause of congestion. It's much
more than just people trying to get from home to work - it's the length
of the commute and thus the longer time that a car stay on the road -
along with thousands of others cars also on the road for long commutes.

In the end - it's not because people won't live in compact
communities - many would - if they could afford even an entry-level
unit. Because they cannot, then they drive and once in the exurbs..
apartments/compact developoments are harder to find than ordinary 1/4
acre lot homes - for sale or rent.

In Arlington, Fairfax, and Alexandria construction accounts for 7 to
9 percent of jobs. In Loudoun, Fauquier, and PW, it is 9 to 12% of jobs.

I'd speculate that there are a higher percentage of citizens with
construction jobs on the periphery because the homes they can afford are
located there. The actual construction sites where they work are all
over the map.

But Ed is mistaken if he thinks that those jobs are going away. I
know several families that have been in the construction business for
generations, some of them are in Warrenton and some are in Fairfax. I
believe they would feel that only elitist snobs think construction is
unimportant or temporary. Whatever you think drives economic growth, it
is construction that brings it to reality. Once it comes to reality, it
is the service sector that cleans, mows, maintains, and plants that
reality. Those balanced communities we hear about need to consider and
make a place for those sectors and not dismiss them as unimportant.

In Fauquier, construction provides the highest payroll of all the
businesses sectors in the county. County officials will try to tell you
that agriculture is the county's largest business, and if you measure
only gross output, they may be right. But if you look at profits or
payroll, then agriculture is dwarfed by construction. It is official
policy in Fauquier to limit construction by any means possible, but the
next three largest employment areas area all government related. If you
kill off you main breadwinner and the next three in line are all
government, then where does productivity (and the ability to feed the
government) come from?

I think the "centroid" is really an L shape with one leg being DC to
Dulles and the other leg being DC to Fredericksburg. Ed can paint this
any color he likes, and I have no doubt that the center will remain
strong for years to come, but the evidence clearly shows what the trend
is (at least for now, maybe $5 gas will change it.)

I believe our plans will be more successful if we base them on what
is likely to happen (and what the trends show us has been happening for
years, and in multiple cities) instead of basing them on the consensus
of a handfull of planners, who apparently come to the process with a dog
in the fight.

I agree with Larry: it is the length of the commute that causes the
problem, but it is not because the cars spend longer on the road.

If the average commute is 10 or 20 or 30 miles, then the area served
is 300 or 1200 or 2800 square miles, and you have proportionately more
people trying to get to the same space. It doesn't matter where or what
shape you think the centroid is, you now have a much larger area
attempting to get into a much smaller area to work.

Say what you like, when I first moved to the area, I lived in
Cleveland Park, in the District. Three times I have moved farther out
and three times I landed closer to a better job. My first commute was 12
miles, (all within the core) and took 35 minutes, my present commute is
25 miles and takes 35 minutes. I hate to think what my original commute
would take today. Some day I'll go re-run it just to find out.

So, how do you make the commute shorter? Either have more affordable
and desirables homes closer in or have more desirable jobs where people
actually live. Affordable and desirable homes closer in simply can't
happen because those places are already crowded and expensive.

Ed is partly correct, there is some market push for those expensive
places, otherwise they wouldn't sell, but the real reason they are
expensive is because they are inefficient: high tax, expensive to build,
expensive to maintain, expensive to operate. No amount of market push
will change that, but if other opportunities develop and people go
elsewhere, then you will see a lot of inexpensive housing, a la Detroit.

Jim raises an excellent point, any careful analysis requires several
centroids.

I am just trying to get the discussion moved off of 200 year old
municipal boundaries that are today irrelevant.

The centroid we use for our discussions of the Virginia portion of
the National Capital Subregion is the Virginia end of the Memorial
Bridge.

I would guess that the centroid for federal work would be along
Pennsylvania Ave in the Federal District.

The one for Bio Med is somewhere inside the Beltway (Bethesda?) in
Maryland.

For IT it is in Virginia but perhaps closer to the R/B corridor than
Tysons. If METRO get to Tysons then it will be there.

Steve F. is of course right about the numbers for Fairfax but the end
of Fairfax that bites is inside R=10 (from my original centroind).

None of this changes what we have been saying for two years about the
dysfunction of scattering urban land uses across the Countryside outside
R=30.

EMR - Rail to Tysons does nothing to improve traffic. After spending
billions on extending Metrorail, the State projects that the traffic
will be as bad, if not worse. (Plus, we lose the billions of dollars
that could be spent somewhere else.)

Why; because all of the new density will add more automobiles, both
from new residents and from new workers commuting to a larger Tysons
Corner. The proposed rezoning of the Tysons Corner shopping center adds
9,000 new parking places to the existing 7,000. Moreover, none of the
spaces would be for shoppers. Rather, the plans would add 9,000 spaces
for the autos belonging to the condo residents and workers in the new
office towers.

In addition to the Tysons Corner Shopping Center rezoning request,
there are more than 20 proposed amendments to the Fairfax County
Comprehensive Plan for Tysons Corner alone. How many new automobile
trips would those projects generate if approved?

From a business perspective, there is already an extra property tax
levy on commercial property in the Tysons Corner and Dulles Toll Road
Corridor. I know several smaller business owners in Tysons who will be
moving to the west once their leases expire. The added costs and
density, with no measurable improvement in traffic will feed the very
business sprawl many would like to stop.

Also, it's unlikely that any new housing at Tysons would be
inexpensive. The land costs are high. The owners of Peacock Buick had 20
offers for its 3.5 acre lot. Moreover, my friends in real estate tell me
that construction costs become much higher once a building exceeds 3 or
4 stories, which the Tysons Corner buildings would do. Therefore, it
would be virtually impossible for there to be much affordable housing at
Tysons. Couple this with the desire of many people for single family
homes and we will have even more people driving to Tysons.

We will continue to see individuals and businesses move south and
west from the NoVA suburbs to seek better properties at lower prices. We
need more jobs in outlying communities and much more teleworking.

re: average commute - keep in mind that if you have situation where
you have a lot of local commuters and a lot of distance commuters - that
the average commute could be a very misleading measurement.

Picture a histogram with a one and two sigma distribution. That data
would tell you much more than "average".

re: commuting for affordable housing

I think folks in this blog will generally agree that affordable
housing is a primary factor in folks who first move to this area to take
a new job - and then try to find a place to live that fits their salary.

We've become not unlike NYC where there are tales of up and coming
corporate execs and even FBI field agents who will refuse a job in that
city because they know that they'll be consigned to commuter hell if
they want to find a place to live that fits their salary.

I think the same thing is going on in the Wash Metro area - except -
I must say that I often meet folks in the Fredericksburg area who say
that they THOUGHT they were going to live in NoVa until they realized
that they could not afford an 800K "starter" home.

Yes, a "solution" would be to have jobs go where folks live and now
commute but is it a likely scenario? Is it a practical thing to advocate
for or advocate laws and/or regs that would essentially "encourage"
(force) companies to NOT locate in NoVa and instead be pushed to locate
in the exurbs?

I would ask instead - what exactly are the factors that influence a
company's decision to want to locate in NoVa ... OR locate in the exurbs
AND ... is THAT something that needs to be better understood and thus
perhaps point to something that COULD be advocated for?

Larry - Excellent suggestion re why do companies, especially
different kinds of companies, locate where they do. This type of
research could probably be done by George Mason University. It would
also be useful to know where workers at large job centers (e.g., Tysons
Corner, Rosslyn, Reston) live.

I did not say METRO to Tysons Corner would “improve traffic"
congestion.

I said METRO to Tysons Corner might shift the IT / T centroid further
out the I-66 / DAAR Corridor. Centroids for Radius Analysis in large New
Urban Regions have shared-vehicle system access. EOD.

The only “solution” for traffic congestion in Tysons Corner is for
the Beta Community of Greater Tysons Corner (including the Beta Villages
of Greater McLean and Greater Vienna)-- as well as the other 16 Beta
Communities inside the Clear Edge in the Norther Part of Virginia -- to
evolve and become a balanced Alpha Community. EOD.

All other “solutions” are bromides, delusions and excuses. EOD.

Larry, I don't understand your point about distribution.

Consider a little brain experiment. Suppose you have a 400 sq mile
area with a uniform traffic grid, uniform rent, and uniform payscale, so
that every destination is equally desirable. You have 400,000 vehicles.
Averaged over the 20 x 20 mile areas the average trip distance is 14
miles. The auto density is 1000 per square mile.

Now reduce it to 100 square miles. the average trip length is now 7
miles, but the vehicle density is now 4000 to the square mile.

So, even if you allow the same amount of time for "rush hour" to
occur, you are going to have twice the likliehood of encountering
another car on your (shoerter) trip. Actually, it is worse than that
because you have only one quarter as many intersections and therefore
more congestion. And, although the distance is shorter, the time of
travel is not.

Then if you throw in situations like Seven Corners or the mixing bowl
the situation becomes much worse locally, and the effect spreads like
ripplles in a pond.

Then if you consider that the rent and payscales are distorted by a
factor of two (according to EMR) you find out that some work
destinations are more desirable (more pay) and some home locations are
more desirable (less rent, or lower combination of rent and travel
cost).

If you charge more for travel (full locational cost) then you change
the shape of these cost distortions, but not the effect. Anyway you
slice it, a denser, more compact area leads to more congestion.

Is it practical to advocate for laws or regs that would encourage or
force companies to locate differently? Maybe not, but surely it is an
easier task to relocate a few companies than to write laws or regs that
encourage or force millions of individuals to relocate.

It seems perfectly clear to me that an overabundance of local job
density is THE cause of predictable congestion of the type that repeats
every day. If we throw up our hands and say we can order homeowners
around but not businesses, then we are screwed.

As it stands, either a home or a business needs permission to be
created in a given location. But due to the idiotic way cost of
community services studies are done, and due to the imbalance of taxes
paid by homes and businesses there is a strong incentive to accept
businesses and deny homes.

We already have the laws in place to control both business and
housing, but we are doing a lousy job of administering them and a lousy
job of understanding the consequences.

Instead of putting blame where it belongs, we prefer to demonize
developers, speculators, and the business as usual interests. We prefer
to take the easy way out with homilies like "you can't pave your way out
of congestion".

As far as I know, there is not a single square foot of class A office
space in Warrenton, which is otherwise a lovely town and a pleasant
place to live. I seriously doubt you could get approved for such a space
if you tried; on account of the historic district, among other things.
But the county is pushing for commercial development 15 miles away in
the new Vint Hill commercial development area. The economic development
managers for Vint Hill have proposed a thousand new homes for the area
to create the housing to incentivise businesses to move there.

I believe that what we know about where people live and work is based
on surveys, and the data is pretty spotty. For one thing it is a pot
picture and gives no evidence of the changes over time. It is the
changes over time that ill us because the road network essentially does
NOT change over time, and there is currently no desire to make needed
changes as we shift from central cities to edge cities or even edgeless
cities.

As for businesses, there is an entire industry with computer models
and economic predictions, living expenses, and shipping and travel costs
and dozens of variables built in. Still, you would have to think that if
a company can afford twice the rent to be in one location, then it has
more resources available to make alternate decisions than the average
homeowner.

The original plan for the capitol beltway called for it to be
supplemented by two bypasses. Forty years later they have yet to be
built. A proposal for a 17 lane route 7 just shows how much the center
of activity has moved.

re: brain experiment

I can tell we're on totally different wavelengths.

But.. let's take a grid... let's say a city grid with multi-story
buildings, 20, 30 stories, with mixed development - businesses (both
employment centers and service industries) and apartments/condos.

Now, explain to me why such places do not "strangle" in congestion.

Explain further.. why such places have not built additional mega
roads to handle all the traffic both from the "compact" area AND exurban
commuters.

This seems to be the argument as to why it's "better" for NoVa to
have exurban commuters rather than more compact development.

Is the basic premise - that NoVa "compact development" cannot be
multi-story buildings - similiar to what we see in other urban centers?

Is the basic premise - that mega highways should be built so that
exurban commuters can continue to commute to NoVa so that it will not
have to transition to more efficient settlement patterns?

In other words.. is the premise that NoVa will not and should not
transition to a more city-style urban center?

I guess my primary thought is that the way NoVa is currently growing
- is not sustainable.

On the current path - you'll have more and more exurban commuters
that will need more and more roads - and you're simply not collecting
enough money to build those roads - so somebody is going to have to come
up with the bucks and I'm betting that it will be in the form of direct
user fees and higher gasoline prices - which ... might render moot..
