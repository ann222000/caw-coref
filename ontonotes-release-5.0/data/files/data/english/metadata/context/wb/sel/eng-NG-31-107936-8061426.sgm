This was back before the war had even started (1936) and along with
the Ju-89 would have been further developed with excellent potential
as long range bombers equal to those of the RAF and USAAF. But one was
cancelled and the other used for transport duties as the Luftwaffe
placed emphasis on medium bomber construction.

It is a misconception, however, to think that the a/c manufacturers
simply gave up 4-engined strategic bomber designs until the last year
of the war iwth a resurrected Amerika Bomber project agenda. There
were many designs from 1939-1944 that could never get approval from
the RLM nor Goering no matter what potential they held.

All hopes were placed on the slow development of the Me-264 and when
they were bombed, only the He-274 and 277 were left along with the
possibility of converting the Ju-290 and 390 into bombers along with
utilizing the Bv-222 flying boat.

As early as 1940 Focke Wulf proposed a Trans-Ocean Project that would
have been powered by 4x DB-606 engines, had a speed of 435 mph, range
of 4,950 miles, with bombload of 8,800 lbs! But it was rejected along
with all the other long-range 4-engine strategic bombers b/c it was
believed that the war would be won soon (remember that Germany had not
yet attacked the USSR nor declared war on the US).

The Stirling didn't fly until 3 years after the Do-19 and entered
service in 1941. By 1944 it was reduced to towing gliders and
transport ;)

In Britain and the US 4-engined strategic and tactical bombers were
developed and produced in numbers; in Germany, however, they were not
developed, cancelled, and in the end reduced to tons of paper
projects.

Consider it a blessing Weaver was killed and Kesselring was an asshole
along with Goering and the Fuhrer Adolf Hitler who actually listened
to the obese art-loving, indulgent, morphine-addict!

BTW, the Do-19 was NOT the first 4-engined German strategic bomber
concept. The Reichswehr 1927 Rohrback Ro XII Roska was. Bet you didn't
know that :)~

Yes Bill, that is what I meant to say- the R-series Staakens. Thanks.

BTW, the Gotha Go.VI was an asymmetrical bomber:

http://www.geocities.com/asymmetrics/go6.jpg
http://www.geocities.com/asymmetrics/go6dr.jpg

The first to apply his imagination in the asymmetric aircraft design
direction, Hans Burkhard did so as a clever means of reducing drag.
Born in Switzerland, Burkhard joined the German Gothaer Waggonfabrik
as its chief designer on October 1, 1914. One of the firm's early
contracts during WWI was to mass-produce Germany's first twin-engine
airplane, the Gotha G.I. In Burkhard's opinion the fuselage and two
engine nacelles representated three drag-producing bodies. &quot;I began&quot;,
he later said, &quot;to think about ways in which the air resistance could
be reduced. And I came upon the idea of an asymmetric configuration.&quot;
After much tinkering around with different arrangements, Burkhard
concluded that the most efficient way to get twin-engine power with
two bodies was to mount the fuselage with TRACTOR engine and tail
surfaces to the left side while the right side would have a small
nacelle incorporating a PUSHER engine and an observer/gunner's
cockpit, that extended forward of the tractor propeller.

To compensate for the different power-to-drag coefficients, the
nacelle was placed somewhat closer to the wing central axis than was
the long fuselage. In addition to reducing drag, the pusher-tractor
arrangement, with its overlapping propeller arcs, allowed the engines'
thrust lines to be closer together, thereby reducing directional-
control problems from torque forces in case one engine malfunctioned.
On September 22, 1915, Burkhard obtained German Patent number 300 676
for his unusual design, but the German government was not interested
in pursuing its development. Instead, Berkhard had to return to more
conventional designs: G.II, III, IV and V.

By late 1917, the Gotha bombers were becoming increasingly vulnerable
to attack by British fighters, and the German military expressed an
interest in a bomber of higher performance. Burkhard was eager to
prove that his asymmetric concept could produce the world-beater.

The new aircraft, designated G.VI, was built in the winter of
1917-1918. The construction was almost identical to those of the Go.IV
and Go.V. The wing span was slightly reduced, though. Before it crash
landed in the summer of 1918, the plane made a few successfull
flights, proving the asymmetric conception was vital. Burkhard claimed
that the Go.VI flew very well and exceeded in performance its
conventional predecessors. The slight buffeting of the rear fuselage
was to be neutralized by utilizing the ASYMMETRIC TAILPLANE on the
second prototype.

The war ended before the second aircraft was completed. It is believed
to have been destroyed in preference to being turned to the Inter-
Allied Control Comission.

as much as Dan Johnson of Luftwaffe '46 does)!

The earlier types were called &quot;auto-stabilisers&quot; and were largely
experimental. Sperry demonstrated a limited one with wing leveler
technology in 1914 in Paris to perform an aerial stunt. By 1918, the
Germans were experimenting with the system through Siemens-Halske;
Britain through RAE, and the US through NRL- although none were true
auto-pilots of any real reliability.

Postwar, these systems were discouraged as the emphasis was on fighter
design and new instrumentation for fighter combat. Auto-stabilisers
were not required for fighter a/c.

In the 1930s, however, commercial aviation and vastly improved bomber
a/c demanded something better than a limited auto-stabiliser and so
the true &quot;auto-pilot&quot; was born.

The Do-19 used an Askania-Sperry, but I have now been informed that
the term &quot;auto-pilot&quot; was a registered trademark in 1937 by Siemens-
Halske. I understand this to mean full-function, not experimental, not
limited to wing leveling, and not a hybrid system.

I do not know what the B-10 used in 1934 but it probably was an
experimental or hybrid type.

During the war the Germans used several auto-pilots for different a/c
which included fighters:

- Early Askania (Do18, Ha139, early Do17 and early He111)
- Siemens (He111, Ju88, Ju52, Bf110)
- Patin fighter course control (Fw190, Bf109, Me262, Ta152)
- Upgraded Askania (Do217, Do335, Ju188, Ju290, Ju388, Me410, Si204)
