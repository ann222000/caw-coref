<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; Hi, My name is Anthony.

&gt; I found this on a bulletin board and decided to try it. A little while
back,
&gt; I was browsing through news groups, just like you are now, and came across
an
&gt; article similar to this that said you can make thousands of dollars within
&gt; weeks with only an initial investment of $6.00!! So, I thought, &quot;Yeah
right, this
&gt; must be a scam,&quot; but like most of us, I was curious, so I kept reading.
Anyway, it
&gt; said that you send $1.00 to each of the six names and addresses stated in
the article.
&gt; You then place your own name and address in the bottom of the list at
$6.00, and
&gt; post the article in at least 200 news groups. (There are thousands) No
catch
&gt; that was it. So after thinking it over, and talking to a few people first,
I
&gt; thought about trying it. I figured, &quot;What have I got to lose; except six
stamps and $6.00
&gt; right, right?&quot; Then I invested the measly $6.00. WELL

"/> GUESSWHAT!!!...............

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Within seven days, I started getting money in the mail!! I was shocked!! I

"/> figured it would end soon, but the money just kept coming in.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; In my first week, I made about $25.00.
&gt; By the end of the second week I had made a total of more than $1000.00!!
&gt; In the third week I had more than $10,000.00 and it's still growing!!
&gt; This is now my fourth week and I have made a total of $42,000.00 and it's
&gt; still coming rapidly.

&gt; It's certainly worth $6.00 and six stamps, but I have spent more than on
&gt; the lottery!! Let me tell you how this works and most important,
&gt; why it works..........also make sure you print this
&gt; out NOW, so you can get the information off of it, as you need it. I
promise
&gt; you that if you follow the directions exactly that you will start making
more
&gt; money than you thought possible by doing something so easy!! Suggestion:
Read this
&gt; entire message carefully!! (Print it out or download it) Follow the simple
&gt; directions and watch the money come in!! It's easy. It's legal. And, your
&gt; investment is only $6.00 (Plus postage) !

&gt; IMPORTANT: This is not a rip-off, it is decent; it's legal; and it is
&gt; Virtually no risk - it really works!! If all the following instructions
are adhered
&gt; to, you will receive extraordinary dividends. PLEASE NOTE: Please follow

"/> the directions EXACTLY, and $50,000 or more can be yours in 20 to 60 days.
This program

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; remains successful because of the honesty and integrity of the
participants.
&gt; Please continue its success by carefully adhering to the instructions. You
&gt; will now become apart of the Mail Order business. You are in the business
of
&gt; developing Mailing Lists. Many large corporations are happy to pay bug
bucks for
&gt; quality lists. However, the money made from the mailing lists is secondary
to income
&gt; which is made from people like you and me asking to be included in that
&gt; list. Here are the four easy steps to success.

&gt; STEP one: Get six separate pieces of paper and write the following on each
&gt; piece of paper &quot;PLEASE PUT ME ON YOUR MAILING LIST.&quot; Now get 6
&gt; U.S. $1.00 bills and place ONE inside of EACH of the six pieces of paper
so
&gt; the bill will not be seen through the envelope (to prevent thievery).
Next,
&gt; place one paper in each of the six envelopes and seal them. You now should
have six
&gt; sealed envelopes, each with a piece of paper stating the above phrase,
your
&gt; name and address, and a $1.00 bill. What you are doing is creating a
&gt; service.

&gt; THIS IS ABSOLUTELY LEGAL!!!!!

&gt; You are requesting a legitimate service and you are paying for it!! Like
&gt; most of us I was a little skeptical and little worried about the legal
aspects of it
&gt; all. So I checked it out with the U.S. Post Office (1-800-125-2161) and
they confirmed
&gt; that it is indeed legal!!

&gt; Mail the six envelopes to the following addresses:

&gt; 1) S. Robinson, Rt. 16 Box 3090, Tallahassee, FL. 32310
&gt; 2) J.Holden,7040 Athel,Inyokern, CA 93555
&gt; 3) T. Nielsen, E1003 770th Ave. Knapp, WI. 54749
&gt; 4) Keith Baas, 15270 W. College Ave.,Muskego, WI 53150
&gt; 5) Anthony Pizzurro, 33 Main St. Danville, NH 03819
&gt; 6) S. O'Neal, 12074 Newcastle Ave. #101, Baton Rouge, LA 70816

&gt; STEP two: Now take the #1 name off the list that you see above, move the
&gt; other names up (six becomes 5, 5 becomes 4, and etc.) and add YOUR NAME
&gt; as number 6 on the list.

&gt; STEP three: Change anything you need to but try to keep this article as
&gt; Close to original as possible. Now post your amended article to at least
200 news
&gt; groups. (I think there are close to 24,000 groups) All you need is 200,
but
&gt; remember, the more you post, the more money you make!! This is perfectly
&gt; legal!!

&gt; If you have any doubts, refer to Title 18 Sec. 1302 &amp; 1341 of the Postal
&gt; Lottery laws. Keep a copy of these steps for yourself and whenever you
need money,
&gt; you can use it again, and again. PLEASE REMEMBER that this program
&gt; remains successful because of the honesty and integrity of the
participants
&gt; and by their carefully adhering to directions. Look at it this way. If you
were of
&gt; integrity, the program will continue and the money that so many others
have
&gt; received will come your way.

&gt; NOTE: You may want to retain every name and address sent to you, either on
&gt; a computer or hard copy and keep the notes people send you. This VERIFIES
&gt; that you are truly providing a service. (Also, it might be a good idea to
&gt; wrap the $1 bill in dark paper to reduce the risk of mail theft). So, as
each post is
&gt; downloaded and the directions carefully followed, all members will be
&gt; reimbursed for their participation as a List Developer with one dollar
each.
&gt; Your name will move up the list geometrically so that when your name
reaches the #1
&gt; Position you will be receiving thousands of dollars in CASH!!! What an
opportunity
&gt; For only $6.00 ($1.00 for each of the first six people listed above) Send
it
&gt; now, add your own name to the list and you're in business!!!

&gt; DIRECTIONS FOR HOW TO POST TO NEWS GROUPS!!

&gt; STEP one: You do not need to retype this entire letter to do your own
&gt; posting. Simply put your cursor at the beginning of this letter and drag
&gt; your cursor to the bottom of this document, and select 'copy' from the
edit menu.
&gt; This will copy the entire letter into the computer's memory.

&gt; STEP two: Open a blank 'notepad' file and place your cursor at the top of
&gt; theblank page. From the 'edit' menu select 'paste'. This will paste a copy
&gt; of the letter into the notepad so that you will add your name to the list.

&gt; STEP three: Save your new notepad file as a txt. File. If you want to do
&gt; Your posting in different settings, you'll always have this file to go
back to.

&gt; STEP four: Use Netscape or Internet explorer and try searching for various
&gt; new groups (on- line forums, message boards, chat sites, discussions.)

&gt; STEP five: Visit these message boards and post this article as a new
message
&gt; by highlighting the text of this letter and selecting paste from the edit
&gt; menu. Fill in the subject, this will be the header that everyone sees as
they scroll
&gt; through the list of postings in a particular group, click the post message
button.
&gt; You're done.

&gt; You're done with your first one!! Congratulations..........THAT'S IT!! All
&gt; You have to do is jump news groups and post away, after you get the hang
of it,
&gt; And it will take about 30 seconds for each news group.

&gt; ***REMEMBER THE MORE NEWS GROUPS YOU POST IN, THE
&gt; MORE MONEY YOU WILL MAKE!!! BUT YOU HAVE TO POST A
&gt; MINIMUM OF 200***

&gt; That's it!! You will begin receiving money from around the world within
&gt; days!! You may eventually want to rent a PO Box due to large amounts of
mail you
&gt; will receive. If you wish to stay anonymous, you can invent another name
to use,
&gt; as long as the postman will deliver it.

&gt; ***JUST MAKE SURE ALL ADDRESSES ARE CORRECT***

&gt; Now the why part: Assume for example you get a 7.5% return, which is very
&gt; conservative.

&gt; 1) When you mail 200 letters, 15 people will send you $1.00
&gt; 2) Those 15 mails out 200 letters, 225 people will mail you $1.00
&gt; 3) Those 225 mails out 200 letters, 3,375 people will mail you $1.00
&gt; 4) Those 3,375 mails out 200 letters, 50,625 people will mail you $1.00
&gt; 5) Those 50,625 mails out 200 letters, 759,375 people will mail you $1.00

&gt; By now your name has dropped off the list, but so far you have received at
&gt; least
&gt; $759,375.00!!
&gt; With an original investment of only $6.00!! AMAZING!! When your name is no
&gt; longer on the list, you take the latest posting in the news groups, and
send
&gt; out another $6.00 to names on the list, putting your name at number 6
again. And
&gt; start posting again. You have to remember and realize that thousands of
&gt; people all over the world are joining the Internet and reading these
articles every
&gt; day,
&gt; JUST LIKE YOU right now!!! So, you can $6.00 and see if it really works??
&gt; People have said, &quot;What if the plan is played out and no one sends you the
&gt; money?&quot; So what!!! What are the chances of that happening when there are
&gt; tons of new honest people who are joining every day and are willing to
give
&gt; it a try? Estimates are at 20,000 to 50,000 new users, every day, with
thousands
&gt; of those joining the actual Internet. Remember, play FAIRLY AND HONESTLY
&gt; and this will really work.

&gt; THANKS
