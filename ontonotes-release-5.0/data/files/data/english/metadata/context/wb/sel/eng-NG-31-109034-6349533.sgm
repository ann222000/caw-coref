Which Orson?

the 1938 Auteur?

the 1950s Noir Genius?

or 1976 Bargain Wine and Frozen peas Salesman?

When does Orson Welles make _Batman_?

He dies October 10, 1985, so he is not around for the latest string of
Batman movies. If he had the financing for the set design, music, and
costuming of  the Tim Burton et al flicks, I would think that Welles
would accept the challenge. I think _Orson Welles' Batman_ would not
surpass Burton's film in quality.

In the 1960s, Welles is deep into his "I am an unappreciated genius and
I will nver make a picture than ordinary American may like" phase. He
impoverished himself and wasted a decade on _Chimes at Midnight_ a
composite script by Shakespeare starring Welles as Falstaff.

He was offered villain roles in the Adam West _Batman_ but never
returned the calls. Orson Welles was the first choice for King Tut
(replaced by Victor Bruno) and  Mr. Freeze (replaced by George Sanders
and later Otto Preminger).

Or are we talking about the Young Welles. Forget Citizen Caine --- we
have _BatMan_. This is an impossibility given the Hollywood  milieu of
the time. No studio is going to finance a kid's   serial if it costs
more than $20,000 a reel (eight, ten minutes screentime).You could not
convince a mogul to make an honest to God feature from anything as "pop"
as BatMan.

The story of Bruce Wayne's vengeance against the criminals of Gotham
might be exactly the kind of thing that the director of Citizen Kane
would want to make. Assuming Bob Kane and Bill Finger see Citizen Kane
and practically beg the auteur of the War of the Worlds to make Batman
his next picture, it might get made. Studios might not want to
confront such a project, but by that time Kane might be the type of
moneymaker that RKO would want to keep working, because he would make
them a lot of money, everything he touches turning to gold
figuratively. So if all goes according to plan, as the article states,
what would happen? Can we imagine the type of success for Orson
Welles' Batman that would be equal to Citizen Kane? Perhaps people
might see Wayne as another version of Kane. If enough interest is
there, then I do not see why it would not be regarded as successful.

IIRC Wells had something to do with the Radio Broadcasts of
_The Shadow_ in the early mid '30s

I think however, getting something like the Batman of the
Miller's _Dark Knight_ that fed Burtons version to an extent,
would have trouble getting past Hayes Office.

Clueless/helpless Cops was a big No-No in Hollywoodland

So the Batman in the '40s serial was a_FBI Agent_, not a
crazed criminal hunter, and no supervillians, either
but spys. The next postwar serial had a Villian, but he wasn't
regular comic one,[1] and this series was cheezy, even for a serial,
and not dark. Think '60s Batman here.

[1] Think of the GI Joe 'Cobra Commander' type mastermind with a bunch
of hired thugs/hoodlums

Yes-he played the Shadow/Lamont Cranston for a while.

It's interesting to listen to them if one knows that his contract exempted
him from rehearsals.  He read the scripts *cold.*

&gt; That would be Ra's Al-Ghul, right? It just sounds like the way he is described, a James Bond villain. Imagine Bruce Wayne: Agent of SHIELD.
