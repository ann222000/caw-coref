I get an average of 50-60 messages a week, ostensibly wanting to make me rich
by helping some Nigerian big shot to get his fortune safely removed to the USA.

At first, I merely ignored and deleted these messages. Then, I began
responding in some idiotic fashion, promising to send the money once another
detail or two could be worked out. Some of their replies to my dumb messages
have provided many laughs. Someone has gone so far as to create a website with
copies of his back and forth correspondence with those who would rob him. Many
of the letters are hilarious. The writers are simply not particularly adept at
English and seldom understand our slang.

For example, if you got the following letter, and have some fluency with
English, you would spot a lot of things that would cause you to not take the
message seriously. However, the Nigerian scam artists have no such insight.
Send them this message back when they write to you, and four things may happen:

1. the crooks will spend a lot of time trying to figure out what you are
saying and how they can accept your generous offer to share your finacial data
with them.

2. they may waste more of their time and money trying to call the number
listed below. It is to the local zoo, and the people there should know just
what to do when they get a call for Mr. Teddy Bear.

3. you may get a laugh out of their replies. I have.

4. if your letter should reach the right member of the Nigerian boobosity, you
may even find an extra $100 in your PayPal account.

COPY OF LETTER:

Dear Sir,

Allow me to introduce myself, I am the Hon. Ted E. Bear, Esq. My many friends
call me &quot;Honest Teddie.&quot; I am much loved by the peasants here.

I have made a large fortune by selling off my gum wrapper collection, but the
terrorists who now run the US government want me to pay taxes on my tremendous
profits. There is a tradition in my family that, for religious reasons, we do
not pay taxes. Naturally, I thought at once that I would contact some honest
person in Nigeria who could help me transfer my fortune abroad.

If you will help me, I will give you 20% of my vast fortune. We must arrange
it so that I can come to your country and live there in comfort with my 11
wives. (I am a practicing Democrat, so it is OK for me to have many wives.)

In the meantime, let me know what I can do to help you, my kind friend. Do you
need anything? I have a hobby of painting surrealistic designs on large rocks.
I would be honored to send one to you, but here in America we must send
everything collect until the terrorists can be repelled. Just let me know.

Do you know Sambo Muchambo Goldberg? I understand he lives in your country. He
is well known here in my country for having played the title role in some of
the old Lassie movies. Maybe I can meet him when I meet you and your wonderful
family. I have watched Tarzan movies for many years, so I know a lot about
your country. I have even learned your language by watching these movies. For
example, I can say, &quot;Me go now, bwana,&quot; and, &quot;Me Honest Teddie, you friend.&quot;
How's that? Any country that can produce a chimp as clever as Cheetah must
have a lot going for it. I know I will be very happy in my own little tree
house.

Let me know if you need my social security number, or the passwords and PIN
numbers for my bank accounts. I also have VISA and Mastercard accounts. Would
they be any help to you? I know you need proof of my good intentions in this
matter and I will send you whatever you need to get me my safe passage. Let me
know what you need and I will hop to it. Please keep this under your hat.

While I am sending you all this info, I will need for you to send me two ducks
and a pig. It is simply a custom in my country to get a gift of this sort from
our Nigerian friends and I don't want to deviate from accepted social
practices. The terrorist government here is continually on the look out for
Americans who fail to get these gifts from their Nigerian buddies. I am sure
you can understand that we must do nothing to alert the authorities, so I must
get this gift at once. If it would be more convenient for you, you could just
send me the cash equivalent and I will purchase the animals here. I think
about $100 will cover it nicely. I accept PayPal. You can call me personally
anytime at 601-545-4576, just ask for Hon. Ted E. Bear, Esq.

Don't forget to send family photos so I can know you better.

Honest Teddie

"/> Those were people who went to Nigeria (or whatever) and tried to get
their money back or file complaints about the scam. The local
&quot;justice system&quot; is in cahoots with the people running the scam, so at
best nothing happens and some persistent boobs have been beaten up or
even killed.

If you stay here, you probably have nothing to fear from physical
retaliation.

Bottom line: If you can get enough amusement value out of the
correspondence to make up for getting a dozen or so extra spam emails
a day, go for it. Just don't be surprised if you get even _more_
&quot;Nigerian scam&quot; emails.
