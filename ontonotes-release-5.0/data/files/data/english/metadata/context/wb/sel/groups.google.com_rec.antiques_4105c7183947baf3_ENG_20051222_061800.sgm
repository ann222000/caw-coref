Just to introduce myself........

My wife and I organize large relic hunts on properties that have seen
Civil War activity and have for the most part been off limits to relic
hunters and are in danger of devolopment and loss forever. These hunts
are called &quot;Diggin' In Virginia'. We have had 4 hugely successful hunts
and our 5th will be held in March 2006. You can get more information at
www.mytreasurespot.com  and scroll down to the &quot;diggin&quot; forum.

I also make quality spring steel probes for the relic and bottle
hunters out there. You can view my probes by going to
www.varelichunter.com  and scrolling down to &quot;spring steel probes&quot;.
