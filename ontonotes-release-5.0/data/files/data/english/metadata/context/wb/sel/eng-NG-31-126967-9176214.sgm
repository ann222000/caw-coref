What are chances that there will ever be a HD DVD recorder for saving HD shows
from a DVR? Or do they exist and I'm out of the loop! Thanks.

Probably exists now but the blank discs on TigerDirect are $10 a pop.

If you're just recording for yourself and not sharing the video, a USB
drive on a PC will come in way below that. I have a 500 gig USB drive
for $110 that holds over 100 hours. Of course you could archive on the
hard disk until prices become more reasonable on the HD DVD. Remember
in 1995 blank CDRs were $10 and the HP 1x CD recorder was $995.00 at
Frys. Be patient unless you just HAVE to be the first on your block to
have it. That what I'm doing.

That sounds like a plan. But how do you connect the drive to your TV and without
software, how do you record onto the drive? I have a WM 500Gb external drive I

You get a computer for doing TV. Some folks call them HTPC for Home
Theatre PC. We have 3 computers, 1 dedicated to doing TV. All 3 have
ATI HDTV Wonder ATSC receiver cards and Jetway ($35 cheap) 9600XT
video cards. The TV computer is connected to the DVI port on the
Samsung DLP. I wouldn't suggest an ATI card as their software support
is zero since AMD ate them but there are others from several
manufacturers - Hauppage, Pinnacle, Air2PC, and more.. Wes Newell
swears by MythTV and it certainly sounds like a good solution but it
uses Linux and I don't do Linux - yet.

VideoReDo is great ($50) for editing out the commercials if that suits
you. It reduces file sizes by almost 1/3. 42 minutes of HD ranges from
a little under 3 gigs to 5.5 gigs. My average is low 4s. These files
can be played across your LAN cables from PC to PC with no problems
using your router or can be copied to external USB drives. The ATIs
came with RF remote controls so the computer acts a LOT like a VCR but
on steroids as in instant skips, pause, step forward/reverse, volume
and channel change - even during live TV like a Tivo but with no fees
and all in HD. Picture is identical to real time viewing.

The computer is no great shakes. I'm running 2 Athlon 3200 XPs and 1
3000XP with a gig of RAM and each with 500 gig drives. Parallel ATA is
fine, SATA is even better.

Or if that doesn't suit you, this Mediagate box can take USB or LAN
and link it to your TV.

Lots of ways to go. Have fun

You need HD tuner card(s) in your PC. You can also burn the HD to DVD if
your not just time shifting. Unfortunately even after commercial removal an
hour show usually won't quite fit on a 4.3GB disc. D/L Verbatim(8.5GB) can
be had for ~$1.50 each if you really need to cut down on the number of
discs. I don't keep very much on disc, though.

You also need something to play the HD files and output HD to the HDTV. I
have a network media player that can read the files from the DVD/HDD drives
on my PC or from a USB DVD player or USB HDD attached to the player. Or the
players internal HDD. A HTPC is another option.

I only have 560GB on my network now for video so will try to bag another HDD
on black Friday.

Are there any PC adapter cards that will act as an input into the
computer for HD recording with RGB component or DVI interface ?

Based on Google searches of forums I was under the impression that ATSC
cards and software are only good for OTA recordings, and most if not
all do not record in HD, they record in SD a least until some new chip
set is released some time in 2008.

Don't know about a DVI input, but I've seen a capture cards for component.
They aren't cheap yet though. Seems like about $300.

ATSC only cards only work for OTA ATSC broadcast as the name implies, but
any ATSC card will record in HD. I use the cheapest you can find, paying
as little as $17.50 for one. I've got 6 of them in my system and can
record 6 HDTV programs at the same time.

OTOH, if you are talking about DVD recorders, you are correct. While thay
actually receive the HD program they downconvert that to SD so it will fit
on a standard DVD. One hour of mpeg2 SD is about 1GB, while one hour of HD
is about 7GB. Toshiba has already released an DVD-HD recorder, but only in
Japan. And it isn't cheap. About $3500 IIRC. You can use a PC and build
one for under $300.

ATSC cards definitely do HD. Have for years. If the card is QAM capable it
will also do unencrypted cable. AFAIK no consumer level cards do HD video
input.

No experience but it may be possible to get HD from cable box via 1394
ports. YMMV

You're gonna get Phil started up. Please don't do that.

Question: _where_ does one get RGB component or DVI HD video to record
in the first place? For nearly all of us the HD comes in as an MPEG2
or MPEG4 data stream that your set top or satellite box _converts_ to
RGB component or DVI / HDMI. It's far easier to record the MPEG stream
_before_ deoding for viewing. ATSC cards do HD just fine as I've been
doing that for 3 years now and have upped the ante to 3 recorders. If
you're talking ATSC DVD recorders, that gets down converted because
you need HD DVD or BluRay discs. The computer doesn't care - it's just
a LOT of bytes.

Well, qam tuner cards have been around for some time now and many cable
companies have already started switching to digital. The ATSC/QAM/NTSC
tuner cards are really very affordable now. I've seen them on sale for
under $50, with normal pricing about $60-$70.

What I'm looking for is an ATSC multi-tuner PCIe card. Preferably with 4
tuners and 1 rf in on it. But I'd settle for 2 tuners with Linux support.

Keep hoping.  If your cable company is like our cable company you will
need a cable box (or some other QAM tuner with a cable card) for each
TV.  Our cable company has moved about half of their analog channels to
their digital tiers and all of them are encrypted.  The only thing you
get from our cable company in clear QAM is the local broadcast channels
and a few music channels (with no video).  At the beginning of this year
all the Music Choice channels were clear QAM but now they are encrypted
too.  The cable company INSISTS that they need to encrypt everything to
&quot;protect their programming&quot; and I can see that but it sure makes it more
expensive to be able to get all the channels that we did get on all our
TVs (you now need a box for each TV).

I'm starting to think about putting together such a system (and, yes, I do

Of course if it comes originally compressed, you want to keep it that way
to record it ... uncompress it when playing.

Some people might want to record some sources that are not necessarily in
in compressed format.  That remains to be seen how the market will deal
with things like HD versions of other video sources like security cameras.
Quite possibly many will be compressed, anyway, in the camera.  I know some
security systems (still only SD) have gone to cat5 instead of 75 ohm coax,
so that suggests digital, and probably compressed.

Amazing.  But not surprising.  Matthew L. Martin was actually handed a free

Might just be because Cat5 has more than 2 conductors. Anyway I thought this

A $75 X2 4200+ is way more than enough cpu. As for NTSC, I just don't use
it at all. There's no need for it for OTA. If you want it for analog cable
or behind a sat receiver that outputs rf then get one with on board mpeg2

Cat5e will carry 20 streams of 25Mb/s video with four streams of 48x16
audio.

The storage server to support that will only set you back ~$30,000. That
is clearly in the price range of the average consumer. On the plus side,
the newest model (MediaEngine) will support 2 streams of uncompressed 8
bit HD out of a single storage unit, if you are willing to install a

I don't think poor old phil has an answer to either of those questions.
I don't find it odd that he is the only person posting here who is
whinging about uncompressed video not being available as a consumer
format. No one but poor old phil wants it but he thinks he *needs* it.

I'd like to record for time shift purposes from a DTV H20 receiver.
I don't feel like paying $200 - $300 for a DTV DVR that isn't mine to
keep, don't own, would have to return to DTV if I cancelled service,
and a monthly fee.
The H20 outputs HDMI, RGB, composite, and S-video.
I figure HDMI converted to DVI or RGB should give a better picture than
S-video or composite.

Right now I'm time shifting with an old series 1 TIVO via S-video.
There are shortcomings to this but it is good enough for simple time
shifting.

What do you think I claimed?  I mentioned what I was thinking about (e.g.
having a PC with TV tuners).  That's certainly not a commitment to do it.
I have lots of other things on my plate(s) that need new computers here,
like some heavy duty ECC based servers to do embedded distribution compiles.

It would be nice if I could use one of those machines for the TV tuner so
that it's a spare box for the Linux work in case another one dies.  Wes did
point out some issues like the low PCI and PCIe slot counts.  So I will
think about a different machine that costs a lot less and does not serve
as a backup for the servers.

Trick request.

Matthew L. Martin knowns damned well that outside of a few areas like
camcorders for consumers, and broadcast stuff that is out of range for
consumers, cameras have not yet migrated to HD.  They are still SD.
Eventually, many of them will support HD.  That will happen when (or if)
HD becomes ubiquitous.

|&gt; And some devices only produce component
|&gt; output (analog) for HD.  I'm not limiting myself to video from OTA, cable,

By whom?  If you would at least say WHO pointed out such facts (I do not
read every posting in this group, so I may well have missed some if they
were not direct replies to my posts ... I do try to read direct replies).
I know YOU don't post facts (at least not with issues I'm involved in), so
if they have been posted, you must have read something I overlooked.

| Oh, I forgot, you are a moron.

Being forgetful, eh?

I have NOT forgotton that right from the start of coming to this group,
you have deliberately twisted what I post (and what a few other people
have from time to time), or just plain don't understand it (in a few
cases this appears to be due to a deficiency in language skills, but in
most cases I cannot explain it other than it being intentional), so you
can use that to make a personal attack (defined as a failure to limit
the scope of conversation to the topic of discussion within the bounds
of the group).  Rather than simply say you disagree with something I or
someone else says, you frequently (always in the case of your specific
targets) make a personal attack, whether that is with the statement of
disagreement or not (and usually not when trying to attack me).

You should just drop all personal attacks and limit your posting to only
the matter being discussed.  In many cases that may lead to an empty or
void posting, which should just not be posted at all.
