Back-alley castration botched; victim mum

St. Paul man, 62, refuses to help cops with investigation

A St. Paul man is refusing to tell authorities who performed a botched
castration on him in late July at his home and left him bleeding in a
makeshift operating room.

City police instead are using forensic leads such as fingerprints and
computer records to track down the unlicensed &quot;professionals&quot; in this
case, which while unusual is not unprecedented.

A few high-profile arrests have occurred in the past decade of people
who performed unlicensed castration procedures on themselves and
others, particularly on people who are transgender.

&quot;It is oftentimes a very desperate move by people who don't feel that
they can find access to appropriate medical treatment and care,&quot; said
Eli Coleman, director of the University of Minnesota's Program in
Human Sexuality.

So far, police have no evidence that sexuality or gender issues were
involved in the decision by 62-year-old Russell Angus to have his
testicles removed. He apparently had complained of severe pain in his
groin, but police said he had been unable to find licensed doctors who
would perform the procedure.

So he hired two or three people to operate on him July 28 in his East
Side home. He was unconscious during the procedure but awoke alone to
find his testicles were removed and his groin was bleeding. Angus was
taken by ambulance to Regions Hospital in St. Paul for treatment after
he called his daughter for help.

The botched procedure is the latest in a shocking line of events in
Angus' life. One son, Brett Angus, was a Marine killed in Iraq in
2005, and another, Daniel Angus was convicted in the drive-by shooting
of 17-year-old Tony Basta in 2000. His second wife, their baby and
three stepchildren died in a 1976 house fire from which he escaped.

Angus did not respond to a message. His daughter declined comment.

On July 28, paramedics and police found Angus upstairs in his home,
according to court documents. There were bright lights, an operating
table, medical supplies and a camera. Neither Angus nor his wife,
Anna, would provide information about the people who performed the
procedure. Angus' daughter asked police not to search the house.

After obtaining a search warrant, police seized medical supplies,
trash, books, videos and other items. They also seized Angus' computer
with the assumption he used the Internet to research or find people
willing to perform the procedure, according to court documents.

No arrests have been made, police spokesman Tom Walsh said Tuesday,
and Angus still won't identify who did the procedure.

Testicles produce testosterone, a hormone responsible for male sexual
characteristics and muscular development.

Castration procedures, also known as orchiectomies, mostly are
reserved for men with testicular cancer or other life-threatening
conditions. However, a British documentary last year found many men
wanting to become eunuchs and followed one man whose surgery was
performed by a licensed physician in Philadelphia.

In March, three North Carolina men were convicted of castrating six
men who voluntarily sought the procedure in what authorities described
as a basement dungeon.

The three initially argued the castrations were consensual, but they
later pleaded guilty in a plea agreement.

Other illegal castration cases have caused criminal investigations. A
Pittsburgh man was charged in 2003, for example, with aggravated
assault when he attempted a home castration on a transgender
individual and admitted to 23 other unlicensed procedures. That same
year, a Detroit-area man admitted to 50 such procedures after his
botched castration sent a patient to the hospital.

The university's Coleman said such cases are unfortunate because the
medical community is becoming more attuned to the needs of people who
are transgendered and more sophisticated at determining who is
appropriate for surgery.

He drew a line, however, between people who are seeking the surgery
out of gender and sexuality issues, and people with disturbing
obsessions or morbid cravings to have their bodies mutilated or amputated.

The latter often report pains and other problems to trick physicians
into unnecessary procedures, Coleman said. Some people try to mutilate
or castrate themselves, then show up in emergency rooms, he added.

&quot;There needs to be an evaluation to understand what the motivation is
about&quot; before a procedure can take place, Coleman said. &quot;It's not just
having access to people who will alter people's bodies on demand. ...
There needs to be a team of psychologists and surgeons who can work
together to manage these situations.&quot;
