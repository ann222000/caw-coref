&quot;Piles&quot; Might be a Better Name

&quot;Stacks&quot; are the worst idea I have ever seen in a GUI. The ability to
place a folder in the Dock and right-click to see its contents in an
easy-to-read, alphabetized list was powerful. I can no longer do that.

See this abomination at &lt; http://www.davidillig.com/whatamess.shtml &gt;.
Display as a grid, you say. Marginally better. I still can't hold the
right button and see the contents of sub-folders.

If Apple stole &quot;Stacks&quot; from Microsoft they must have gotten it out of
the dumpster. It's not even good enough for Windows.

I never found this of much use, but it appears that many other people
did.  I didn't have a folder in my Dock until Leopard put the Downloads
folder in there for me.

I still don't quite get the point of a folder in the Dock, since I want
as little to do with folders as possible when I use a GUI.  Folders are
(to me) just directories, and I only care about directories when I'm in
a POSIX shell.

The paradigm that works best for me is slicing across your dataset to
create views of the exact stuff you want.

There is a click combo to open the stack as a Finder window.  Not quite

I'm personally still quite fond of directories/folders, and can't get
into that mindset. The first thing I did after installing Leopard was
getting rid of the &quot;search&quot; things in the left pane of the new Finder. I
suppose that directories give me some sense of safety, as I tend to
consider them (wrongly, I know) more &quot;hardcoded&quot; -- if that makes any
sense -- than a database view. Also, the concept of directory is common
to most operating system, and that's quite handy when working with
different machines at the same time, or simply when moving things from
one to another. (I haven't tried whether one can somehow access a
&quot;search view&quot; through FTP, perhaps by means of an OS wrapper or
whatever; but in the meantime I'll personally keep using folders. ;)

I use a folder in my Dock for one reason.  I have my basic Apps on the Dock;
Finder, Safari, Thunderbird, iTunes, Photoshop, Silverfast, Final Vinyl,
Google Earth, and MacGPS Pro.  And then I have one folder containing
shortcuts to a bunch of other apps that I don't use as often.  It's not that
big so it will probably look fine in Stacks, but, still, the simple folder
worked just fine.

Disclaimer:  I'm still waiting for my Mac Pro so can't compare yet.

There isn't one there now.

I did a search through the Dock.app executable and didn't see any string
constants that looked promising. But it is a 2.2MB file, so it's quite

I have no idea what &quot;slicing across your dataset&quot; means. I have a

What a folder, er, directory, in the Dock means--meant--to me was that
with a single (right) click I could see everything in the folder, er,
directory, and move down through the sub-folders er, sub-directories. I
released the mouse button when I got to the document or app that I
wanted and there it was, ready for work.

Safari's new Find? I reported the old behavior as a bug just after 10.4
shipped. &quot;This was great for 1990, but these days in a web browser that
already has multiple background colors changing the color is just way
too subtle. You should dim the page and use an animation to draw the
user's attention, like coach marks.&quot;

That stupid search for a menu command? Reported that one back in 10.2.
&quot;Classic at least had AppleGuide and coach marks!&quot; I have to admit, the
way they fixed it is horrible, but it's better than not having it.

Magsafe connectors? Reported that one right after my 12&quot; PowerBook G4
power adapter broke. &quot;Xbox controllers break away, and that's for
something worth a lot less than my PowerBook.&quot;

I'm sure hundreds of people reported these issues, so I take no credit
for them being resolved. Nevertheless, I know Apple analyzes each issue,
and treats duplicates as votes. A fix might not come until 10.6 or even
10.7, but if you want something done, it's worth the effort to report it
and add your voice.

I've never had a folder in my (hidden) dock either.  As a long time
Keyboard Maestro user, I don't use the dock much anyway.  When it was
first announced, I recall Jobs selling Stacks as a way to the desktop
clean, especially of download files.  At the time, I thought maybe that
had some merit but *only* for the download folder with regard to my work
habits.  I find Command-N for directory access easy enough.  I never
used Exposé either (Spaces seems kind of similar).

this would be an optional warning, but even with all warnings turned on

You can go down quite a few levels with just one click and hold. If I've
a few app windows open that I'm working on, which is normal, it's handy
just to open the app or document I want without going into yet another
window and digging around to find it, then having to close that window
again.

At the moment the only method the filesystem provides for slicing across
your dataset is directories. Until someone comes up with something at
least equally useful and efficient the gui, which is only an interface,
can't do much more, and attempts to do otherwise, like this one, end up
a disaster. As long as the thing it is interfacing with is based on
hierarchical directories its limitations are those hierarchical directories.

What's the point of it being a 'stack' then? I'm beginning to see what
zara and muahman et al were on about before. I thought it would be
different from the old behaviour, but it is actually less than before.
In 10.4 you get a listing of the files and folders in the directory,
this is the same but only if there are a small number of things in it.

Worst idea or just a bad implementation? I think the latter. The concept
is, IMO, quite good. But the implementation we have in Leopard deviates
quite a bit from the behavior that had been described previously.
Largely the ability of the user to explicitly create a pile, or not, as
a pure alternative to a folder rather than as a display option for a
folder in certain circumstances.

&gt; Oddly, that's the name on the patent.

&gt; &gt; &quot;Stacks&quot; are the worst idea I have ever seen in a GUI.

&gt; Worst idea or just a bad implementation? I think the latter. The concept
&gt; is, IMO, quite good. But the implementation we have in Leopard deviates
&gt; quite a bit from the behavior that had been described previously.
&gt; Largely the ability of the user to explicitly create a pile, or not, as
&gt; a pure alternative to a folder rather than as a display option for a
&gt; folder in certain circumstances.

&gt; &gt; If Apple stole &quot;Stacks&quot; from Microsoft ...

&gt; Nope. That's a Cupertino invention. And not an especially new one.
">

Oh and by the way: Agitate for Apple to fix it. Don't hold your breath
for a 3rd-party replacement. I've been poking around at this since
before 10.5 shipped and there doesn't appear to be a reliable way to do
it except, maybe, the assistive apps hooks (and those'll be laggy).

Abstractly it's a simple idea, but the way the dock manipulates the
menus that apps hand it pretty much kills the ability to build the
potentially-very-deep hierarchy as needed instead of all at once
up-front. With a small hierarchy it works fine, but if you try to put
the user's home directory in an app's dock menu it's death. A few dozen
nodes, tops.

I just use the Finder sidebar.  I figure if I'm going to make gesture to
open a Finder view, I may as well have easy access to all the top-level
directories I may be interested in (i.e., home, music, pictures, dev

me, but only for relatively flat folders like /Applications.

I never understood putting /Applications on the Dock, though I see other
folks doing it (and, for the record, my SO does this, and has found that
Stacks is a better system than a simple folder of apps for her).  It is
about as useful as the Windows Start button to me.  I keep the currently
most important apps on the Dock since I rarely need daily access to more
than a handful, and most of those are running all the time anyway.  If I
need an app it is a simple gesture to invoke it from SpotLight.

If an app becomes more important I'll leave it on the Dock, and if I
don't use another for awhile I'll drop it off the Dock.  Current
projects and work go into flat folders on the Desktop, unless I'm
working with a specific app that manages content, and then I let the app
do its thing; perhaps creating a smart folder if I need to see specific
aspects of that work.

I guess we all get used to the gestures we make in the UI.

No, but I have SpotLight and smart folders that slice across those
folders for me.  I want the computer to collect the data for me, not for
me to go hunting for it.

Heck, even apps like iTunes and Lightroom are special purpose apps that
happen to act as asset management tools so one doesn't have to crawl
through subfolders looking for something.  My computer has two fast CPUs
in it that mostly sit idle.  They should bloody well do the work of
finding data for me!

Like I said, if I'm going to hunt for it, I can navigate using the
Terminal faster than clicking though subfolders.

&gt; consider them (wrongly, I know) more &quot;hardcoded&quot; -- if that makes any
&gt; sense -- than a database view. Also, the concept of directory is common
&gt; to most operating system, and that's quite handy when working with
&gt; different machines at the same time, or simply when moving things from
&gt; one to another. (I haven't tried whether one can somehow access a
&gt; &quot;search view&quot; through FTP, perhaps by means of an OS wrapper or
&gt; whatever; but in the meantime I'll personally keep using folders. ;)
">

Well, the writing is on the wall.

Filesystems based on a tree of directories do not scale well, are easy
to corrupt and offer less ideal ways of handling arbitrary metadata.
Worse, there is often a time/space trade-off that really kicks in once
we start talking about terabytes.

Even if the directory paradigm is supported in the future, it will
probably be a view into a more cohesive and normalized dataset.  What we
gain in flexibility (user-defined metadata, filesystem level tagging and
searching, bit-error detection and correction, &amp;etc.) is just a win that
gets better as disks get bigger (and no safer at the hardware level --
bit errors, even if they stay the same, will mean larger drives will be
guaranteed to have undetected [in most current filesystems] bit-level
errors).

Heck, right now a Finder view showing a filename and an icon is still an
abstraction.  Unless you inspect the filesystem with the right tools,
you don't really know what that filename represents.  That is, it is not
quite the concrete representation of a &quot;file&quot; that we think it is.

Anyway, completely off-topic, I know.  I just think its interesting what
bugs folks about Leopard.  For me this has been the best release ever.
Even the stuff I don't care about (i.e., Stacks) has added something
that I'm more likely to use than before.

&gt; At the moment the only method the filesystem provides for slicing across

&gt; least equally useful and efficient the gui, which is only an interface,
&gt; can't do much more, and attempts to do otherwise, like this one, end up
&gt; a disaster. As long as the thing it is interfacing with is based on
&gt; hierarchical directories its limitations are those hierarchical directories.
">

Not true.  I'm talking about the search/index/tag/metadata paradigm.

Think about what problems SpotLight, Smart Folders and things like
Google Desktop are intended to solve.

These are one of the many ways we are seeing to flatten and query large
datasets.  As our personal data stores grow, the need for better ways to
retrieve the information we want becomes very important.

The notion is that you store the data you you want, in whatever
hierarchy you (or your DAM app) requires.  To retrieve some part of that
data is accomplished by having the computer do the hard work of pulling
that data out for you based on (static or dynamic) criteria, and
providing it in a view or format that is most appropriate.

I think it's worth remembering that the directory/folder paradigm came
out of a command-line interface designed for specific business computing
model decades ago.  While still worthy, it was never really ideal for
that use, and was always a bit of a kludge when adopted for home computers.

It has been polished since then, of course, but obviously there is room
for improvement.  Just look at all the different ways we have come up
with of solving the common problem of &quot;find specific data in this
hierarchy.&quot;

Apple, Microsoft, et al have had to respond, because as datasets
increase in size, this problem becomes harder and harder to solve, and
the user experience suffers as a result.

SpotLight.  Smart Folders. &amp;etc.  Techniques like these are part of a
relatively new desktop data access paradigm.  One has a selection or
hierarchy of data they want to extract information of interest from.  In
fact, one might not even be interested in knowing where the data comes
from /exactly/, only that it is there and meets some criteria.

Hence: slicing across data.

There is a lot of interesting research going on at Apple, Microsoft and
Google about handling personal datasets in excess of terabytes.  Pretty
new and exciting stuff, some of which we are just starting to see at a
consumer level.

Sounds like the icon view is less useful for you.  If you have to

&gt; Oddly, that's the name on the patent.

&gt;&gt; &quot;Stacks&quot; are the worst idea I have ever seen in a GUI.

&gt; Worst idea or just a bad implementation? I think the latter. The concept
&gt; is, IMO, quite good. But the implementation we have in Leopard deviates
&gt; quite a bit from the behavior that had been described previously.
&gt; Largely the ability of the user to explicitly create a pile, or not, as
&gt; a pure alternative to a folder rather than as a display option for a
&gt; folder in certain circumstances.

&gt;&gt; If Apple stole &quot;Stacks&quot; from Microsoft ...

&gt; Nope. That's a Cupertino invention. And not an especially new one.

You are correct.

HP Advanced Products was once on Pruneridge Avenue in Cupertino.
The HP35 Calculator introduced in the early 1970's used a stack.

First, Clever Monkey:

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt;&gt; I still don't quite get the point of a folder in the Dock, since I want
&gt; &gt;&gt; as little to do with folders as possible when I use a GUI.  Folders are
&gt; &gt;&gt; (to me) just directories, and I only care about directories when I'm in
&gt; &gt;&gt; a POSIX shell.

&gt; &gt;&gt; The paradigm that works best for me is slicing across your dataset to
&gt; &gt;&gt; create views of the exact stuff you want.
">

Then, Davoud:

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; I have no idea what &quot;slicing across your dataset&quot; means. I have a
&gt; &gt; cursor and a mouse to control it, but no knives.
">

Then, Clever Monkey again:

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; SpotLight.  Smart Folders. &amp;etc.  Techniques like these are part of a
&gt; relatively new desktop data access paradigm.
">

Now Davoud replies:

Ah, I get it. One facet of the new paradigm is typing the name of an
app or a document to open it. Isn't this what I did under CP/M and DOS?
Except it was faster then because I didn't have to click a mouse button
first; the command line was linear and there was only one place to type
the command.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; One has a selection or
&gt; hierarchy of data they want to extract information of interest from.  In
&gt; fact, one might not even be interested in knowing where the data comes
&gt; from /exactly/, only that it is there and meets some criteria.
&gt; Hence: slicing across data.
">

I'm not sure that works for me. I _know_ where the data is, because it
is where I put. The directories it occupies are (were) represented in
the Dock, and a single click and a scan of a list written in black type
on an opaque white background (of all things) takes me (took me, before
Leopard) to that data. &quot;Stacks'&quot; use of white type on a gray
translucent background flies in the face of what literate people have
learned about readability in the few thousand years since writing was
invented. Steve, there is a _reason_ books and newspapers are printed
in black type on a solid white (not translucent white) background!

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; There is a lot of interesting research going on at Apple, Microsoft and
&gt; Google about handling personal datasets in excess of terabytes.  Pretty
&gt; new and exciting stuff, some of which we are just starting to see at a
&gt; consumer level.
">

I hope to Hell they're researching this, because they don't have it
right at the moment. At least Apple doesn't. Don't know or care if
Vista has it right.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

See &quot;single click&quot; above.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Ditto.

Right-click on the Taskbar, select &quot;New Toolbar&quot; and then select a folder
or drive. Then drag the re-size handle until it is just a chevron.
Clicking on that chevron will expand the menu.  You can add any folder or

&gt;&gt; What a folder, er, directory, in the Dock means--meant--to me was that
&gt;&gt; with a single (right) click I could see everything in the folder, er,
&gt;&gt; directory, and move down through the sub-folders er, sub-directories. I
&gt;&gt; released the mouse button when I got to the document or app that I
&gt;&gt; wanted and there it was, ready for work.

&gt; I open a top-level Folder on my desktop that has found the document for

&gt;&gt;&gt; There is a click combo to open the stack as a Finder window.

&gt;&gt; And then move the cursor to a different part of the display and click
&gt;&gt; repeatedly until I reach the document I want. And then click repeatedly
&gt;&gt; to close those folders, er, directories, again.

&gt; Sounds like the icon view is less useful for you.  If you have to
&gt; navigate subfolders so regularly, maybe switch to one of the other
&gt; views?  It also sounds like you end up creating new Finder windows for
&gt; ever level you drill down.  Isn't there a Preference to control this?
">

But none of what you suggest is actually addressing what is being
complained about. None of it is as quick and efficient as making a
single click on a folder in the dock and then tunnelling down 2 or 3
levels (or less) into my well-organised directory structure. No windows
to open, no search to type in, no clutter of saved searches (ho wmany
would there be after a year?), nothing. The app or document I want opens
without me having to switch to anything from the work I was doing, and
there it is on the top layer in my workspace, ready to go.

It's like knowing all the phone numbers you use a lot. Then when you use
someone else's phone you aren't stuck. You might not understand why some
people find this a good way to work, but you don't need to. All we want
is to be abble to continue doing that. I'm already aware of all these
other ways of getting around the filesystem, as well as the evolving
methods that try to pretend it isn't there. I'm not interested in them,
except as measures to use in the odd instance where I can't remember
where something is. If you know where something is, you don't need to
search for it, you just need the best method of getting it. Apple just
took that away to replace it with an abomination designed to attract
people ... fuck knows what kind of people they had in mind... open up a
folder and it shows you some of the things in it. Amazing!

But here we seem to be concentrating on the gui. The underlying system
is what needs to change, if what you say is true. Changing the gui
doesn't address the underlying issues, and disabling a feature for no

People not knowing where their stuff is. Fine. All I am complaining
about is that I do know where my stuff is, and I don't like having a
useful tool taken away. As you can see from previous post, I agree about
metadata, but that has not been anywhere near perfected yet, and until
it is I don't want to rely on it.

I am not complaining about stacks, only about not being able to use
subfolders from the dock any more. If there was somewhere else I could
get the same functionality I could pretty much ignore the dock 99% of
the time, as I presently ignore the finder. It took a little time to set
up my aliases, and a little effort to make a structure I could easily
navigate, but it was my solution to the inadequate finder without
installing any third-party stuff.

I don't understand why you are defending stacks etc when I am only
saying I don't want to use them, not I want them abolished.
