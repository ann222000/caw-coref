Hmmm.  Don't see anything about this on their website.  They normally
make their broadcasts in the Fall.  Could be they haven't updated the
website yet?  Where did this information come from?

It may interest you to note that they also tested the transmitter back on May 17 at
1500.

direction: &quot;Antenna pointing towards Europe at the moment 014 bearing. Thanks for your
report&quot;.

Radio St. Helena dropped down into the mud here at 2000. I'm not certain if it was a
change in antenna direction or just the fact that propagation died. Earlier in the program
they played hits by the Byrds, Monkees, and Sonny &amp; Cher amongst others.

Nice to hear them, and I wouldn't be surprised if they didn't check the transmitter again
in September, prior to the regular broadcast in November.
