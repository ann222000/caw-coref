Its called Bettr'n peanut butter with no saturated fat and 2.5 g fat
per 2 tbs.  4 g protein.  it certainly doesnt taste better than any
nut butter but it may be less lethal.

I'm not sure about this.  The fats in nuts (primarly mono-unsaturated
fats) are really good for you.  I used to eat reduced-fat peanut
butter but realized that the good fats were removed and replaced by a
lesser quantity of not-good fats.  You might want to check into the
nutritional profile of this product.

There is some saturated fat in nuts, but not a lot -- less than 3g per
serving.  The other fats are healthy fats -- monounsaturated,
polyunsaturated, Omega 6.  There are all kinds of proven health
benefits of peanuts and other nuts, and there's evidence they help
control weight.  Here's a good site with information about the
benefits of peanuts:

http://www.whfoods.com/genpage.php?tname=foodspice&amp;dbid;=101

By &quot;nutritional profile&quot;, I just meant what's on the back of the jar,
compared to the information for real peanut butter.  I looked up your
Better 'N Peanut Butter online and found the following info for a 2
tbsp serving:

Calories: 100
Fat: 2.5g (saturated fat 0)
Sodium: 190 mg
Carbs: 13g (fiber 0, sugars 2)
Protein: 4g

Ingredients: peanuts (as defatted peanut flour and natural peanut
butter), tapioca syrup, pure water, dehydrated cane juice, rice syrup,
vegetable glycerin, soy flour, salt, tapioca starch, natural flavors,
paprika &amp; annatto, calcium carbonate, lecithin, vitamins E &amp; C
(antioxidants)

By contrast, my jar of Trader Joe's Crunchy Unsalted Peanut Butter,
for the same size serving, has:

Calories: 210
Fat: 17g (saturated fat 3)
Sodium: 5mg
Carbs: 6g (fiber 3, sugars 2)
Protein: 7g

Ingredients: dry roasted peanuts

So, mine has a lot more calories, but -- apart from the 3g saturated
fat, perhaps (I don't worry as much about it in moderation), they're
all good-for-you stuff: heart-healthy fats, fiber, and more protein.
Yours has most of the healthy stuff taken out and replaced with filler
products, and I've no doubt mine tastes better.  (Compare the two
ingredient lists :-) .)  I use many kinds of diet products (such as
fat-free cheeses) to reduce calorie intake, but this is a place where
the trade-off is not at all diet-friendly.  You might like to do a bit
of reading about heart-healthy fats; the data is impressive.

By the way, if you want serious nutritional profile data, here's a
great site:

http://www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/foodcomp/search

However, I don't think you can look up specific brand products such as
your pseudo peanut butter.

I'd tend to agree with Chris, the healthy fats are important, so I'd
rather use real peanut butter in a moderate fashion than use the fake
stuff. Though I admit to buying the salted kind. Just stirred up a new
jar today.

BTW, watch out for the kinds that claim to be &quot;no stir&quot; natural peanut
butter... the ingredients usually have palm oil or something other
than peanuts/salt in there to create that effect. Stirring PB is not a
big deal, and once it's been done, I generally don't have any trouble
with it separating out in the fridge.

I never thought of it that way.  Besides it doesnt taste especially

&gt;&gt;&gt; Yours has most of the healthy stuff taken out and replaced with filler
&gt;&gt;&gt; products, and I've no doubt mine tastes better.  (Compare the two
&gt;&gt;&gt; ingredient lists :-) .)  I use many kinds of diet products (such as
&gt;&gt;&gt; fat-free cheeses) to reduce calorie intake, but this is a place where
&gt;&gt;&gt; the trade-off is not at all diet-friendly.  You might like to do a bit
&gt;&gt;&gt; of reading about heart-healthy fats; the data is impressive.

&gt;&gt;&gt; By the way, if you want serious nutritional profile data, here's a
&gt;&gt;&gt; great site:

&gt;&gt;&gt; However, I don't think you can look up specific brand products such as
&gt;&gt;&gt; your pseudo peanut butter.

&gt; Thank you Chris and Cynthia.  Im going to use almond butter instead.
&gt; I never thought of it that way.  Besides it doesnt taste especially
&gt; good.

Almond butter is a great choice too!

I tried it and found that it didn't seem to have much taste. Very mild.
Went back to peanut butter.
