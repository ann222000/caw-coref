Let us assume that several decades ago, were a full scale zombie
invasion to have occured, our nation would have certainly been overrun
within a matter of weeks. Now however, with the huge communicative
power of the internet, coupled with awesome new military technologies,
have large scale zombie threats been rendered obsolete? Would our
current military and governmental structure be capable of handling a
zombie uprising? This is of great concern to me.

This happens to be something that I've been tthink about quite often.
I think that recent events in zombie cinema demonstrate that a race of
hyper-evolved undead are soon to be knocking on our doors. Regardless
of advances in modern communication, military technology, or head-shot
strategery, I fear that we may currently be in the midst of a veritable
arms-race with our zombie foes. The principles of Darwinian evolution
certainly apply, and as we fail to destroy the most powerful and
adaptive zombie terror cells, they grow stronger, more intelligent, and
ever more hungry for brains and assorted fleshy meats. If there ever
was a chance that a zombie epidemic could penetrate our borders, then
we are certainly on the verge of something big.

I guess, for me, it comes down to a question of relative advancement.
That is, has the modern zombie surpassed the 1970's zombie in terms of
strategy. I think not. Strategy is necessarily not a part of the
zombie threat. We do know that the US military was unable to stop a
zombie outbreak in the 1970's vis a vis the McMiller papers. However,
this was based on a cold war style unilateral attack, which, if
Vietnam and Iraq have taught us anything (they haven't), we would no
longer employ. Therefore, could the CDC, with a full scale US military
campaign, perhaps even the help of NATO or, dare I say, the UN, stop
or, at the very least contain, an outbreak? I am tempted to say yes
with the qualifier that there would be many, many awesome casualties.

With that I would like to officially welcome all of you to the list. I
hope that at the very least this will be a bastein of intelligent,
rigorous and verbally abusive debate. But before we all drown in the
swelling tide of cleverness and irony let's make sure we're all on the
same page. First, this group is invite only. That's primarily to keep
out the spanners and bots. If you have friends you want signed up just
give me their email. Unless they're nerds. Then you're both fired. As
for the format of the discussion, just write, don't be afraid. We're
all more clever than you and you'll just have to get over it. The more
writing the better. Remember, the goal is to kill time. And there's a
lot of time.

Topics: I don't know how this is going to work just yet. For now I say
anyone can suggest topics for discussion and the interesting ones get
debate while the people who come up with stupid ideas are burned
alive. But that too is up for debate. If there are too many topics and
not enough conversation I might limit the list to two or three
topics/day submitted the night before. But that just sounds like work
and the whole point of this was to avoid work. So we'll see.

Finally, the list is small, so it might take a week or so to get off
the ground. Keep debate relatively clean (we're all at work) and
extremely clever. Sincere irony welcome. Insincere irony is pedantic.

Best,
Chris

Esteemed colleagues:

The prompt neutralization of a zombie threat is, as previously
stated, &quot;a question of relative advancement.&quot; Indeed, the human race
has continually evolved while the zombie race has stagnated. There is
no question that our supreme organizational and technological
advantages would eventually lead to our crushing the walking dead.
However, we cannot neglect the fact that any zombie attack -
regardless of how quickly it is quelled - will necessarily cause
human casualties.

In this sense, we can see a modest zombie mob as analogous to a pipe
bomb. Both are disruptive and deadly on a small scale. Both, once
detected, are ultimately disarmed.

I suppose the real question here is not whether our modern military
could eventually suppress the zombie threat. The real question is how
long it will be before the forces of evil begin to utilize the undead
for their own nefarious purposes. Could Al Qaeda successfully unleash
zombies at the NYSE? Could the next Eric Rudolph be preparing a
zombie attack upon abortion clinics?

The days of a successful zombie invasion are long gone. But what of
zombie terrorism?

Stephen raises an interesting point. But to retort here I defer to the
virulent cause of the zombie problem. While biological warfare may, in
theory, seem similar to zombie warfare, consider the fact that human
carriers have never worked as a method of terrorism, and in those
attempted cases the host bodies were all willing participants. While
Al Qaeda may be organized, I just don't see them successfully
infecting, maintaining and deploying a zombie.

In the meantime, to return to your first point, while I agree that it
does SEEM like our military could quell a zombie attack, are we
assuming, perhaps wrongfully, that the attack will be localized and
urban? What of the rural zombie? The guerrilla zombie lurking in
suburbia. Zombies are not pack-driven by nature, so it is reasonable
to believe they would spread out fairly quickly unless an outbreak was
quarantined immediately. It's simple entropy.

Just a thought.

&quot;BRAINS&quot; globally, 'BRAINS&quot; locally

Yes, there would be many awesome (super bloody, gross-ass sweet)
casualties, but it sounds to me like some people haven't been doing
their homework. Recent field footage (Romero, 2005) clearly portrays
the zombie race evolving the capacity for language and tool use.
Though their ability to communicate a collective intention or act as
intentional agents (a la Searle) has not surpassed that of, say, a
pride of African Lions, the modern zombie has certainly evolved
(RELATIVELY rapidly) to a state that far surpasses that of the cold
war zombie in terms of strategy and intelligence. Also, they run.
This has the potential to increase the relative spread of zombieism by
four times the normal rate. That said, I would appreciate it if the
group would focus the language used to describe zombie related
phenomena. Invasion is a loaded word. If we wish to discuss zombies
as intelligences, I suggest the term, globally intentional spread of
contagion: &quot;BRAINS&quot; globally, &quot;BRAINS&quot; locally.

BRAINS works, as the situation is less an invasion than it is an
outbreak. I am skeptical of Romero's footage, however. You know how I
am with conspiracies, and the document seems altered to me. I believe
it was shot such to give the illusion of pack-mentality when in
reality it was just a bunch of zombies in a group. There also seems to
be some digital manipulation. I've been wrong before, however. Moon
landing and such.

First things first: I'm off the clock and have indulged in a few early week
libations that may have somewhat impaired my perspective...however I still
feel it necessary to point out that the group seems focused on a
political/militaristic view of the zombie. In my experience a great deal of
zombie activity takes place in or around the veritable mecca of the middle
class: the surburban shopping mall. Being relatively new to the zombie genre
I am hesistant to make any firm statements without furhter research but I
feel that the role of the zombie in today's culture has less to do
domination, polictal or otherwise and is more economic in nature. I give
voice to theory that the zombie is a representation of the worst of an
increasingly materialistic society...consumers so manipulated by choice,
technology, and media bombardment that the most appealing thing to consume
is themselves.
