With Hitler on the road to Samara
By Sean Matgamna (a sane communist)

Of course you know the story. A man is in the market place, and he sees
Death, and Death looks at him intently, recognising him.

In a panic, the man runs to his horse and gallops away desperately, taking
the road to the city of Samara.

As he gallops off, Death turns to his companion. "Strange," he said, "that
was so-and-so. I was surprised to see him here, because I have an
appointment
with him, tonight, in Samara."

Death is all-powerful. There is no escape when he reaches your name on the
list.Consider now, and the association is appropriate enough, the fate of
poor
Adolf Hitler. This heroic son of the German people understood early
in life that the Jews were responsible for all the evil in the world.

He knew that the Jews were behind everything! He knew that socialism and
communism were Jewish, and that the Jews were also behind finance capital.

He knew that modern art was pornography and corruption, and modern
culture decadent -and he knew that the Jews were responsible, as they
were for everything decadent and evil in the world. This genius understood
that Jewish Bolshevism and 'Jewish capital' were all one. Despite the
appearance of difference and antagonism between these things, Hitler could
see that all of them- communism, socialism, finance capital, cultural and
artistic decadence, etc. - werereally one thing. They were aspects of one
tightly organised and minutely directed world Jewish conspiracy.

And so Hitler fought the Jews. He roused much of Germany against them. In
the middle of the 20th century, he re-created the medieval Jewish ghetto in
some of the main cities of European civilisation.

When the Jews who ruled in London, Paris, Moscow and Washington
declared war on the German Reich, Hitler set out to do the job properly: he
organised the killing of six million Jews.

A quarter of these were children: but Hitler refused to be deterred. He
knew the extent of Jew-Zion power. He understood that sentimentality would
be fatal.And Hitler - before the Jews finally got him - managed to kill two
out
of every three Jews in Europe.

Now, you wouldn't think, would you, that Adolf Hitler could have
underestimated the power of the Jews?

The left at the time of Hitler used to say he was a criminal maniac. But the
left just didn't understand.

And neither did Adolf Hitler. This great man understood a lot about the
Jews.

But he didn't understand everything. The truth is that even Hitler
underestimated the extent and power of the World Jewish Conspiracy.

Not only communism and finance capital-those seeming mortal enemies
- were tools of the international conspiracy of Zion - so were the Nazis,
themselves! Hitler and his valiant warriors against Zion - farsighted men
like
Himmler,and Heydrich, and Streicher - were themselves tools of the world
Jewish conspiracy.

The Holocaust? That was just Hitler galloping off down the road to his own
Samara. The Holocaust, too, served Jewish interests! It may well, in its
entirety, have been part of a Jewish conspiracy, a Zionist Grand Design.

Without the great anti-Jewish warrior for one moment guessing what was
going on, the guiding centres of the world Jewish Conspiracy helped him
in Â this work of killing Jews.

The Jews helped Hitler in all sorts of nefarious ways. For instance, by
instructing the US government, before, during and after World War Two, not
to let refugee Jews into America . They did many other things to help the
Nazis, some of them things that would need one cleverer than I am to
unravel and chronicle for you.

Why did "The Jews" help Hitler kill Jews? That, you see, was the easiest way
they could win a Jewish state.

By a process of reasoning inaccessible to the ordinary human intelligence,
the Jewish super-conspirators decided that the best way to secure Israel was
to kill six million Jews.

This idea is of course difficult to grasp. It is the political equivalent of
that category of Catholic doctrine - for instance, the Trinity, the doctrine
that God is both One and also Three Divine Persons - which is classed by the
Church as a "Mystery of Religion." A Mystery of Religion is something which,
though certified true by the Church, and therefore certainly true, is simply
beyond ordinary human understanding.

Don't waste your time trying to understand. Neither formal logic nor Marxist
dialectics will help you. The subtlety in the evil of the Elders of Zion has
always puzzled the ordinary man, who is doing well if he becomes aware that
this conspiracy exists, and has the courage to raise the alarm about it.
Rational explanations are neither possible nor necessary. This is a
Mystery of theWorld Zionist Conspiracy.

After all, it was too complicated for even Hitler to understand, and he
devoted his life to probing into the Jewish Conspiracy. Even Hitler could
not save himself from being made into an instrument of the omnipotent,
omniscient International Zionist Conspiracy that he spent his life fighting.

All you need to know is that the Jews proved too clever for poor Adolf
Hitler, who died confused, a Jewish dupe. Israel came into being, and it
has never in all its history done anything but evil in the world.

The tale I have here sketched in is, of course, mad. Mad as Hitler?
Madder than Hitler! It is a long stretch further down the road into the dark
lands of paranoia and lunacy.

Yet one variant or another, one facet or another, of the crazy stuff which I
have just set out in the form of a simple, straightforward story is now very
widely accepted on the revolutionary left.

It is not usually expressed either as crudely or as candidly or as
coherently as I have expressed it here.

The thesis of much of the 'left' - the 'left' that sees nothing wrong in
'allying' in Britain with the British offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood,
the Muslim Association of Britain - is that 'the Zionists' are and always
were, racists; that they collaborated with the Nazis, and, therefore, that
they -and the state of Israel which they created: that in particular - share
more or less in the practical and moral responsibility for what Hitler did
to Jews,and others. That is: they share responsibility with the Nazis for
the massacre of Europe's Jews, for the Holocaust. They are themselves
the true heirs of the Nazis.

That's what the Morning Star (like its high-Stalinist predecessor, the
Daily Worker which pioneered such ideas in Britain), Socialist Worker
and theirsmaller satellites, such as Socialist Resistance, say.

Originating with the Stalinist rulers of the USSR, this sort of stuff has
become part of the folk wisdom of the kitsch left.

To traduce Hitler's victims, and those who were his potential victims, to
blame Jews and Zionists even in part, for the Holocaust, outrages both
common sense and known history; it outrages decency. It is plain bonkers!

How does the'anti-Zionist' 'far left' attempt to make its case for such
ideas?

*They indict the 'Zionists' in the manner of a police prosecutor, and an
especially unscrupulous one at that, selecting and presenting facets and
shards of truth that serve to blacken the character of the accused. Some of
the things they select are true, or half-true, or would be necessary aspects
of
a true and full historical picture.

* They isolate snippets of real history, stripping them of their social,
historical and military context, and use them to misconstrue and
misrepresent the thing as a whole. They use them to weave large, grotesque,
lies. Here, their polemics are entirely Stalinist in character, typically:
disloyal,
tendentious, mendacious, unscrupulous, utterly contemptuous of truth,
understood even on the level of the legal formula, "the truth, the whole
truth,
and nothing but the truth."

* The Zionists, the Jewish nationalists, they tell you, wild eyed with
surprise and indignation, were... nationalists and as narrow as other
nationalists.Most of what they say is like that: banal. The critical cutting
edge is given to thebanality by the insistance that Jewish nationalism is
not a 'legitimate'nationalism; and by indentifying it with racism and
fascism.

* They wax indignant on the fact that the Zionists, in concentrating their
efforts on building up the Jewish nation in Palestine, were sometimes short
sighted, factional-minded, politically sectarian and always combative
towards their political opponents, Jewish political opponents included.

* They denounce them because they steered a single-minded Jewish nationalist
political course through the rocks and reefs of a world hostile to Jews, and
large parts of it murderously so.

* They present 'Zionism' as some sort of historical deus ex machina on the
Jewish people, not as what it was, something rooted in their experience and
one legitimate response to it, and a response shared from some time in the
1940sby most surviving Jews. Jewish nationalism, they insist, and it is a
pillar of their entire outlook on the Middle East, is an especially
poisonous
illegitimate nationalism.

* They insist that by choosing a nationalist response to anti-semitism, the
Zionists thereby endorsed the racism of the anti-semites. Zionist
nationalism is therefore, in its most fundamental notion, genetically,
so to speak, racist. Jewish nationalism is and always was, essentially, a
form of racism. It cannot be anything else. It was racist when, fighting
against great odds, the Israeli Jews defended themselves against Arab
invasion in 1948. It is racist now.

* The early Zionists, they tell you, eyes blazing with horror and
self-righteousness, did not scruple to try and harness to their own
purposes the will of anti-semites -even, that of the Nazis -to be rid
of the Jews. They did that in the 1940s, when it was a matter of trying to
rescue some Jews from the murder machine in which the Nazis and their
allies had most of Europe's Jews trapped and marked for death.

Like wild-eyed ultra-lefts or understand-nothing anarchists (though the SWP
is a long way from ultra-left or anarchist) they denounce such activities on
principle and scour the records for instances of it on which to mount
charges of "collaborating with the Nazis" and as proof that 'Zionism' shares
the responsibility for what the Nazis did.

* In hellish situations, such, for instance, as in Nazi-occupied Hungary in
1944, some Zionists attempted to manoeuvre and negotiate with the
powerfulenemy at whose mercy they stood. Not only were some such things
possibly misguided, actions by desperate people, but, say the kitsch left,
they
were ipso facto treachery and collaboration with the Nazis.

*In some such efforts, the distinction between actively striving to save
some Jews, when only some could be saved, and implicit acquiescence at the
fate of the others may sometimes got blurred.

In some cases, manoeuvrings by Zionists and others to save what could be
saved, and compromises with Nazis and others (at gun point!) blurred the
distinction between responsible efforts to save what might be saved and
seeming to take responsibility for what the Nazis did, and collaboration in
it,
as for instance in the activities of the Zionist official Kastner in 1944
Hungary?
The anti-Zionists, naturally, use such unfortunate things to smear all
Zionists,
everywhere.

* In the Nazi-controlled and Nazi-surrounded East Europe Jewish ghettos,
some Jewish bourgeois and 'notables' behaved as their class - of all creeds,
nations and races - typically behaves. This too proves the affinity of
'Zionists'and their persecutors. In some of the outpourings of the
anti-Zionists the distinction between 'Zionist' and 'Jew' more or less
vanishes.
And so on. And so on.

The history of the Jewish people in the 20th century is an indescribably
tragic one. The kitsch-left approach this history with all the empathy and
sympathy with which one would look upon a head of cabbage ground under
a ten-ton truck. And with all the understanding and breath of historical
outlook,
and empathy with the victims of Nazi mass murder, which that head of cabbage
could be expected to bring to understanding the history of either cabbages
or
human beings.

* Incongruously, as we have said, they use ultra-left and anarchist
attitudes -as in their opposition to Jewish nationalism. But they are
not consistent opponents of all nationalism and nationalists. Indeed
invariably
they are people drunk on Arab nationalism and vicarious Arab chauvinists,
who use their arguments against nationalist narrowness in general as tools
of
virulent Arab nationalism, and as the basis of an argument for destroying
the
Jewish national entity in the interest of the Palestinian Arab nation.

They present the displacement of 750,000 Palestinians in 1948 as unique
and uniquely evil. They ignore the 600,000 Jews displaced from the Arab
countries to Israel in the late 40s and after. They ignore such things as
thedisplacement of 13 million ethnic Germans from Eastern Europe
(10 million from what is now western Poland). They ignore the role of Arab
states in denying the Palestinian refugees and their descendants the right
to
work and integrate - in keeping the refugees and their descendants refugees.

Their political conclusion? Not that the Palestinian nation should have its
own independent state side by side with Israel, but that Israel must be
eliminated!

The Israeli Jewish nation forged in the terrible history of the Jewish
people in the 20th century, must be deprived of self determination, in the
only way that such a thing is now conceivable, by being conquered. What
remains ofthe Israeli Jewish people after their conquest by the Arab
states,
will be incorporated against their will in a single Arab state, where they
may
have religious rights, but not national rights. They want not justice for
Jews
and Arabs, but the situation of Jews and Palestinians reversed.

This pile of ideological dung, laid down by the Stalinists in the 40s and
50s, is now domicile and diet to the 'anti-Zionist' 'Trotskyists', who have
lost both Marxist overview and working class historical perspective; who
deal neither in historical truth nor in honest historical record.

In short the dominant 'left' culture now is a culture in which necessary
and legitimate criticisms of Israel are amalgamated with root and
branchcondemnation of the Jewish nation in Palestine for having come
into existence at all and for defending its existence now.

A culture which purveys a malignant Arab-Islamist chauvinist account of
modern Jewish, Israeli, and Middle Eastern history in which the Jewish
victims of the convulsions of mid-20th century capitalist Europe are
demonised for seeking a refuge from persecution in Palestine and for
defending themselves against the invasion of five Arab armies in 1948.
Demonised most of all for winning the right to survive in 1948 and after.

A culture in which the ostensible left is one of the main bearers of the
most important modern version of anti-semitism, under the name of
'anti-Zionism'. That is, hostility to the idea of a Jewish state, to its
existence now, and to those, especially Jews, who accept and defend
the Jewish state, critically or otherwise.

The elevation of this tissue of a-historical nonsense, one-sided
anti-nationalism, one-sided anti-racism, into the place it now holds
on theleft is the index of what has happened to the left, or, better,
perhaps, to the once upon a time left.

Just as the Protocols of the Elders of Zion was forged by the Tsarist secret
police, this contemporay 'anti-Zionist' thesis, in its turn, was formulated
by the anti-semitic Stalinist state in the USSR. It spread first, in the
1940s and 50s, to the Stalinist parties around the world, and then to a
widespectrum of the anti-Stalinist left. Books like Lenni Brenner's Zionism
in the Age of the Dictators recycle them; so did Jim Allen's play,
Perdition;
so have dozens of articles and pamphlets.

Why have such ideas spread amongst otherwise rational people of good
will and socialist aspirations?

Proper emotional solidarity with the Palestinian Arabs, and therefore
emotional hostility to Israel, is the living root of the credulity with
which
thefantastic tales and the Hansel and Gretel 'history' of grotesque
constructions on real events are accepted on the left.

It is the source of the emotional and intellectual 'demand'which
'anti-Zionism'
supplies, and of the willingness and even eagerness to identify Zionism
andIsrael with Nazism, or to come as close as sense can be stretched and
often way beyond - to identifying them. In a welthering of righteous 'anti
imperialism','anti-racism'and, in some respects justified, but incoherent
and
hysterical, indignation against Israel's treatment of the Palestinians, the
kitsch
left,is like the hero in an old Hollywood film, who, sword-fighting with
the
villain in the final reel, moves closer and closer to the quicksand, or
perilously close to the edge of a precipice. Except that the kitsch left
long ago
pitched itself head first into the pestilential morass.

Nihilistic 'anti-imperialism' plays a central role here. Israel is
identified as a mere stooge of Washington.

There is another root to the kitsch left's identification of the Jewish
nationalists with the Nazis. It is a way to escape the compelling logic,
and the political conclusions, which 20th century history gave to the
pre-war disputes on Zionism; a way to escape the obvious conclusions
of modern history.

In Trotsky's time, his movement opposed Zionism on two grounds. The
wholeproject was possible only under license from the British imperialist
overlord of Palestine, Jordan, Iraq, Egypt, Aden, etc. The Zionists would
be compelled therefore to ally with the British against the revolt of
Britain's
Arab semi-colonies.

The second reason was that the Zionist project in Palestine was not in their
opinion an answer to the mortal threat with which the Jews of Europe were
faced. Trotsky, who had a sharp pre-vision of what Europe's Jews faced
was tragically proved right. (Trotsky was influenced perhaps in this by his
pre-World War One experience as a war correspondent in the Balkans, where
he had witnessed terrible ethnic and sectarian massacres.)

The colonisation of Palestine simply could not in the short term provide a
refuge for all the threatened Jews of Europe. (Though it could have saved
manymore than were saved had they been allowed to go there.) Only the
socialist revolution, argued Trotsky, can save the Jews. Two out of every
three Jews alive in Europe on Sept 1, 1939, were not saved.

The experience of the war and the Hollacaust, however, threw a new light
on the old disputes about Palestine. The Palestinian Jews survived. They
might nothave. The Nazis might, even temporarily, have overrun the area.
The Jews might not have survived, but they did; and most of the Jews in
Europe did not.

IMPORTANTLY too, the charge that the Zionists - that is, today, Israel,
which isthe point 'collaborated' with the Nazis, bear a share of
responsibility for the Holocaust, are themselves Nazi-like, etc works to
free people who start out with decent socialist and liberal instincts and
attitudes from the tremendous moral pressure in favour of Israel which the
fact of the Holocaust engenders. If Zionism-Israel share responsibility for
the Holocaust in any degree then the Holocaust can be removed as a
powerful argument for a Jewish state now.

The whole thing is radically incoherent. But if, the various 'stories' now
widely accepted and spread by so much of the 'left' are taken as true,
that 'theZionists', even while six million Jews were being killed, were
nevertheless able to control such things as whether or not the US
government let in Jewish refugees, and as a movement, calculatingly,
for their own long-term 'Zionist'purposes, helped the Nazis kill one
million Hungarian Jews in 1944, and soon(and there is a lot more of it,
and one or other bit of it is widely accepted onthe left) -then 'they' had
a
high degree of manipulative control over whathappened - even
over the Holocaust.

The very idea, bluntly stated, is self-evident lunacy. But if 'they'
could do Â that during the war, then the Nazi theories of a powerful
Jewish conspiracy before the war were wrong only in being
understatements.

The prevailing 'left' thesis about Zionism-fascism-Israel can rest on no
logicalground except that of the pre-war Nazi world Jewish conspiracy
theories.

Denouncing the Zionists as 'Nazis', they reproduce the old right wing and
Nazithesis, or at any rate a recognisable dialect of it, about the world
Jewish
conspiracy.

Hysterically identifying Israel (because of its treatment of the
Palestinians,
but not only that) with Hitler and Nazism, they embrace and propagate the
core of the Nazi theories about the International Jewish Conspiracy!

Of course nobody on the left would explicitly tell the story I told about
Hitler. The anti-fascist, anti-racist, and anti-imperialist feeling of the
anti-Zionist left prevents them from grasping and understanding, from
seeing it whole, and from spelling out, coherently, what, nevertheless,
so many of them implicitly believe and propagate...

Yet - to repeat - that is the tale sections of the left implicitly tell now.
Try to spell out, clearly and honestly, what is said about Zionist
collusion withthe Nazis to secure a Jewish state; open out the implications
which are plainlythere in what is said - then you must come up with some
version of the story I told above. That is the real and only possible
relationship that what is now said by the left can be seen to have with
what Hitler said on the same subject.

And it is not a matter of parallels that never meet. The assertion about
the Zionists co-responsibility, or part-responsibility, for the Holocaust
ties it all together. An honest historical balance sheet from that point of
view would have to place Hitler himself in the perspective of history, that
is,
of the post-Holocaust working-out of the ' International Jewish Conspiracy'
Hitler lost: the Third Reich fell and Israel rose!

If those who demonise Israel would confront the logic of some of the
things they say now. If they dared think it through without the constraint
of powerful inhibitions rooted in our common hatred of Nazism, and of racism
in general, then what the left says now would compel it to recognise that
Hitler was informed and insightful and, in essence, correct on the 'Jewish
question'.

Most of the reasons why the 'anti-Zionist' left do not tease out these
conclusions speak in their favour, of course: horror of Nazism, disgust with
racism, and so on. They are, after all, socialists, whose basic impulses and
aspirations are the same as ours. Such people must denounce articles like
this as foul slander.

Having done that, they will feel free to go on as before.

But this 'good side', which stops the kitsch-left thinking through the
meaningof what they say, has a very bad consequence here. It allows them,
fuelled by sympathy with the Palestinians and hatred of Imperialism,
blithely to continue peddling a disguised and sanitised version of ideas and
facets of ideas they would recoil from in horror if ever they were forced to
look at what they say, in its wholeness, and to understand how what they say
now relates to what the murderers of six million Jews - and many millions
of
others,too -said to justify their anti-semitism.

An anti-semitism that is now reproduced in the kitsch-left commitment to
the destruction of the Jewish nation in Israel, and the comprehensive
hostility to most Jews alive to which this inescapably commits them to.

There is a shift from what the German socialist, Bebel, said was "the
socialism of the fools" to "the anti-imperialism of the idiots", but
hostility to
Jews, and to the Israeli Jewish nation which emerged out of the terrible
events of the 20th century is central to both.

We should support Israel's right to defend itself; support the Palestinian
Arabs in so far as it is a matter of them trying to gain control of their
own
territories from the Israeli army; and back the Israeli anti-chauvinists who
want a just settlement with the Palestinians.

We should stand against the Islamist clerical fascists.
We should stand against the present upsurge of hysterical 'nti-Zionism'.
We should strip off the masks and the illusions behind which lurk ideas,
like thoseI have explored here.

We are fighting for political sanity and against unreason on the left:
thereforewe should not let delicacy stop us from confronting our
misguided comrades,brutally, with the brute 'Nazi ' logic, implications
and ancestry of some ofthe ideas they have adopted from putrescent
Stalinism.
We must insist: No, Hitler was not right!
