The Morals and Literature of the Restoration
Andrew Bisset

Writers of authority, such aS Mrs. Hutchinson, expressly mention the
pestilential influence of the court of James the First, and of his
personal character on the English nobility and gentry. The inundation
of vice and licentiousness, which the Restorations seemed to bring
with it, was not really an innovation, as has been supposed, but only
a restoration.
(snip)
...The writers of the age of James the First would necessarily possess
many of the qualities of the age of Elizabeth in which they had been
bred; and the influence for good or evil of the new court would be
first felt by those writers who came most in contact with and were
most dependent on it. This is particularly observable in Ben Jonson,
the court poet in the time of James I. Mr. Gifford having expressed
some indignation at the charge brought by Sir Walter Scott against Ben
Jonson, of brutal coarseness of conversation, and of vulgar and
intemperate pleasures, Sir Walter signified his adherence to the
opinion he had before given. &quot; Many authors of &quot;that age,&quot; he says,
&quot;are indecent; but &quot;Jonson is filthy and gross in his pleasantry&quot;, and
indulges himself in &quot;using the language of scavengers and nightmen.&quot;
His &quot;Bartholomew Fair&quot; furnishes many examples of this unhappy
predilection, and his &quot;Famous Voyage&quot; seems to have disgusted even the
zeal of his editor....Besides the grossness of manners, amounting to
filthiness, that lies on the surface, there is an ominous cloud made
up in part of the characters of frightful crimes distinctly traced
out, and in part of others still more frightful, &quot;deeds without a
name,&quot; remaining in shadow, which imparts to that court, and in some
degree to that time, a strange, repulsive, pestilential air and
aspect, hardly belonging to an equal degree to any other period of
modern history. If Jonson had written his tragedy of &quot;Sejanus&quot; towards
the end instead of the commencement of James's reign, we might have
expected to find in it hints to help us on some dark points; for there
has been thought to be some analogy between the fate of the son of
Tiberius and that of Prince Henry.

The effect produced on the mind of Ben Jonson by the moral
contagion of the court of James is the more remarkable, inasmuch as he
above all the dramatic writers of that time, except Shakespeare,
appeared to possess a healthiness of mind that saved him from
resorting to the coarse stimulants that call up the emotions of horror
and disgust rather than those of pity and terror. Jonsoon himself
refers to this in the lines which he adopted from Martial as the motto
of &quot;Sejanus,&quot;-

*Non hic Centauros, non Gorgonas, Harpyiasque
Invenies: Hominem pagina nostra sapit.*  Mart.

(No Centaurs here, or Gorgons, look to find:
My subject is of man and humane kind.)

Jonson's &quot;man,&quot; however, and his woman too, it must be confessed,
is rather a repulsive animal. And how could an artist paint otherwise
who was at the court poet of James I? There was a moral poison in the
very atmosphere of that court, from which there was no escape but
keeping out of its influence. That poison has left an indelible stain
on the greatest name in English philosophy; and it was but by a happy
and providential escape that the same poisoned circle did not leave an
INDELIBLE STAIN on the greatest name in English literature. Those
persons who, on moral and religious grounds, shunned the poisoned
precincts, were branded with the name of Puritans - a name applied as
a term of ridicule and reproach. There is evidence enough in his
writings that Shakspeare was far less inclined to the side of the
Puritans than to that of their scoffers; and we have seen manuscript
evidence, in the English archives, that his patron, the Earl of
Southampton, was deeply stained with the vices of the court of the
first Stuart - vices which, even more than all the selfish policy of
the Tudors had done, humbled and dishonoured the English nobility and
gentry; among others, both the sons of  &quot;Sidney's sister,&quot; the
Countess of Pembroke, who, it is said, wept and tore her hair when she
heard of her younger son's having endured with patience an insult
offered him by another courtier - the same whose ready hand had before
murdered the Earl of Gowrie and his brother, whom the king wished to
make a favourite, but who preferred death to that infamous honour. But
Shakspeare came little, if at all, into contact with the court of
James. Much of his work was probably done before James came to the
English throne; and what was done afterwards was the produce of a mind
working amid scenes more favourable to the labours of either poet or
philosopher than the atmosphere of a court or a city. It is impossible
to conceive any association, even in the slightest degree, between a
court, the influence of which, if long continued and widely diffused,
would have been to reduce the highest human intellects to the level of
brutish idiocy, and him whose mind has laid open with intuitive truth
the most secret springs of the human heart, and has left to after ages
such marvelous pictures of human characters and human passions - of
ambition for which the earth was too small a bound; of policy that
would circumvent God; of remorse, with its worm that dieth not and its
fire that is not quenched; of love strong as death; and jealousy cruel
as the grave.

1. O! never say that I was false of heart,
2. Though absence seemed my flame to qualify,
3. As easy might I from my self depart
4. As from my soul which in thy breast doth lie:

6. Like him that travels, I return again;
7. Just to the time, not with the time exchanged,
8. So that myself bring water for my stain.
9. Never believe though in my nature reigned,
10. All frailties that besiege all kinds of blood,
11. That it could so PREPOSTEROUSLY BE STAINED,
12. To leave for nothing all thy sum of good;
13. For nothing this wide universe I call,
14. Save thou, my rose, in it thou art my all.

Preposterous Chatterton
K. K. Ruthven

the Oxford English Dictionary records two principal usages of the word
&quot;preposterous&quot; that circulated contemporaneously in the sixteenth
century. By the late nineteenth century only one was still current,
and that was the pejorative sense defined as &quot;contrary to the order of
nature, or to reason or common sense; monstrous; irrational, perverse,
foolish, nonsensical; in later use, utterly absurd.&quot; The other usage-
listed first but rendered secondary and eventually obsolete by
modernity-foregrounds the etymology of the word to articulate a
politics of reversal: &quot;having or placing last that which should be
first; inverted in position or order.&quot; In 1624 tensions between these
two usages provided Henry King with an occasion for funereal wit when
he elegized his wife Anne, whose untimely death violated the natural
principle that his seniority would guarantee him &quot;præcedence in the
Grave.&quot; By thinking about her constantly, however, he has reversed the
forward movement of time so successfully that it now goes &quot;backward
and most præposterous.&quot;

Orthographic sameness has erased this semantic difference, which can
be made audio-visible by dissociating the absurdities of
&quot;preposterousness&quot; from the inversions of &quot;pre posterousness.&quot; For
unlike &quot;preposterous&quot;, which presents itself as a word without a
history but with several synonyms, &quot;pre posterous&quot; preserves its
etymology as a latinism which instantiates the phenomenon it
describes, namely a &quot;before&quot; (præ ) &quot;coming after&quot; (posterus ). In
1854 a prescriptive lexicographer, Archbishop Richard Chenevix Trench,
advised &quot;young Englishmen&quot; to restore the &quot;proper meaning&quot; to this
word, since the degeneration of pre posterous into preposterous was
symptomatic of  &quot;the final ruin of [our] language&quot; and &quot;the
demoralization of those that speak it.&quot; A semiotician, on the other
hand, might note that the supersession of the primary sense of
preposterous by a secondary usage is itself a preposterous
development. It is also iconic of the cultural process I hope to
illuminate by arguing that, when Thomas Chatterton studied pre-
Elizabethan poetry in order to compose in the 1760s the poems of an
imaginary fifteenth-century monk called Thomas Rowley, he read
anachronistically and in a way still widely practiced, despite being
deeply at odds with the historicist assumptions embedded in the
scholarship we all depend upon in our transactions with the literary
past. The ubiquity of preposterous readings calls for a supplementary
literary history, the nuclear model for which is a rhetorical figure
known to the ancient Greeks as hysteron proteron (&quot;the later first&quot;).
&quot;We name it the Preposterous,&quot; George Puttenham explained in The Arte
of English Poesie (1589) when classifying hysteron proteron as a
&quot;manner of disordered speech,&quot; exemplified in the &quot;English prouerbe,
the cart before the horse.&quot; It is therefore treated with suspicion in
symbolic systems that conceive of time as an arrow moving always and
only from past to present. In logic, for instance, hysteron proteron
names a type of fallacy in which the conclusion is said to antecede
the premises because one of them already assumes the proof for it.

As a subversive figure of disorder, hysteron proteron makes
alternative literary histories possible by drawing attention to the
preposterousness of various literary conventions at odds with
commonsense notions of sequence.

An indelible stain:

(Dedicatory Epistle, _Volpone_, Jonson)

For the present, most reverenced Sisters, as I have cared to be
thankful for your affections past, and here made the understanding
acquainted with some ground of your favours; let me not despair their
continuance, to the maturing of some worthier fruits; wherein, if my
muses be true to me, I shall raise the despised head of poetry again,
and stripping her out of those rotten and base rags wherewith the
times have adulterated her form, restore her to her primitive habit,
feature, and majesty, and render her worthy to be embraced and kist of
all the great and master-spirits of our world. As for the vile and
slothful, who never affected an act worthy of celebration, or are so
inward with their own vicious natures, as they worthily fear her, and
think it an high point of policy to keep her in contempt, with their
declamatory and windy invectives; she shall out of just rage incite
her servants (who are genus irritabile) *to spout ink in their faces,
that shall eat farther than their marrow into their fames; and not
Cinnamus the barber, with his art, shall be able to take out the
brands; but they shall live, and be read, till the wretches die, as
things worst deserving of themselves in chief, and then of all
mankind*.

6. Like him that travels, I return again;
7. Just to the time, not with the time exchanged,
8. So that myself bring water for my STAIN.

Shakespeare in Print: A History and Chronology of Shakespeare
Andrew Murphy

Footnote 21
The exact extent of the regendering is mapped out by de Grazia in
'Scandal', pp. 35-36. In the context of the alterations Benson did
carry out, de Grazia asks: 'If Benson had wished to CENSURE homoerotic
love, why did he not omit the notoriously titillating master-mistress
sonnet (20)? Or emend the glamorizing sonnet 106 that praises the
beloved - in blazon style, part by part - as the &quot;master&quot; of beauty?
Or the sexually loaded sonnet 110 that apologizes to a specifically
male &quot;god of love&quot; for promiscuity of a decidedly &quot;PREPOSTEROUS&quot;
cast?' (p.36)

**************************************
CX

1. Alas! 'tis true, I have gone here and there,
2. And made my self a motley to the view,
3. Gored mine own thoughts, sold cheap what is most dear,
4. Made old offences of affections new;
5. Most true it is, that I have looked on truth
6. Askance and strangely; but, by all above,
7. These blenches gave my heart another youth,
8. And worse essays proved thee my best of love.
9. Now all is done, have what shall have no end:
10. Mine appetite I never more will grind
11. On newer proof, to try an older friend,
12. A god in love, to whom I am confined.
13. Then give me welcome, next my heaven the best,
14. Even to thy pure and most most loving breast.

Jonson

E  P  I  G  R  A  M  S .

LXV. - TO MY MUSE.

Away, and leave me, thou thing most abhorr'd
That hast betray'd me to a worthless lord ;
Made me commit most fierce idolatry
To a great image through thy luxury :
Be thy next master's more unlucky muse,
And, as thou'st mine, his hours and youth abuse,
Get him the time's long grudge, the court's ill will ;
And reconcil'd, keep him suspected still.
Make him lose all his friends ; and, which is worse,
Almost all ways to any better course.
With me thou leav'st an happier muse than thee,
And which thou brought'st me, welcome poverty :
She shall instruct my after-thoughts to write
Things manly, and not smelling parasite.
But I repent me : stay - Whoe'er is raised,
For worth he has not, he is TAX'D NOT PRAISED.

Preposterous Events
Patricia Parker

To look carefully at the &quot;preposterous&quot; in Shakespeare, then, in the
midst of a context Lawrence Stone has described as &quot;patrilinear,
primogenitural, and partirarchal,' is to see the presentation of an
order authorized as &quot;natural&quot; as instead rhetorically produced and to
become aware of the workings of &quot;smooth discourse&quot; - the histories it
forges and the authority it creates.
The contexts we have traced all form part of the background against
which we need  to set the mises-en-scene of sequence, following,
&quot;cause effective,' and processional in the plays of Shakespeare, for
the reverse of the reasons Tillyard and others in an earlier era of
Shakespeare criticism placed contemporary discourses beside the plays,
but also to caution against considerations of Shakespeare that fall
into the trap of reading such passages &quot;straight&quot; and hence, though
with different explicit aims, repeat some of the gestures of an older
historicism. Shakespearean deformations of order and sequence - in
short what I am calling the &quot;Shakespearean preposterous&quot; - need to be
remarked against the background of emergent discourses of order in an
age whose increasing neoclassicism and neoAristotelianism were
intimately related to the articulation of new structures of social
order and power. To read Shakespeare carefully in this sense is also
to read politically and to include within any conception of a
political Shakespeare and awareness of the language that both stages
this order and subversively dismantles it.
