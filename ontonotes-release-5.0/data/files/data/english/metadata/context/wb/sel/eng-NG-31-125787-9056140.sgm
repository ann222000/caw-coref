who need a little more time to make the switch to Windows Vista.&quot;

This is an official confirmation of what we have suspected in this
group all along.  OEMs who are selling PCs with XP are actually
purchasing a Vista Business license which then allows them to
downgrade to XP.  So Microsoft IS counting XP machines as Vista
Business Edition licenses.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; 1.  We are scared stiff that large corporates will go the Linux /

Which appears to have backfired.  Microsoft is able to make lots of
statements in the press about the &quot;Success&quot; of Vista, and even cites
the surprisingly high proportion of Vista Business Edition sales.

It's noteworthy that OEMs have dropped the price of the upgrade to
Vista Business/XP to $20, which is quite likely their cost.  It's
possible that Microsoft is counting two licenses, the Vista Home Basic
or Home Premium sold bulk at minimum commitment to the OEMS, and then
counting the machines sold with Vista Business as a SECOND VISTA
license, even though the machine was SHIPPED as Windows XP.  This
could mean that OEMS are actually selling FEWER actual machines this
year than they did the first year of XP, and given that most of
Microsoft's XP license counts were the result of &quot;Force-feed&quot; licenses
to Volume License customers, OEMs, and retailers, even that didn't
generate as many actual PC sales as the OEMS had hoped.

It may even be that any &quot;surge&quot; in PC sales was a scramble to get
machines with XP while they were still available.  Normally, Microsoft
allows OEMs a few MONTHS of grace period during which they can sell
the previous version as an option.  Demand for XP machines may have
been so strong that Microsoft came up with the &quot;Buy Vista Business and
you can downgrade to XP&quot; option to prevent XP numbers from becoming
public knowledge.

IF THIS IS TRUE, then Microsoft may be guilty of fraud on a massive
scale (again).

There may be Sarbanes-Oxley violations.

Top executives who left Microsoft prior to the release of the latest
10Q may have
known this and were attempting to avoid the risk of being sent to
jail.

They may have also decide to get off the sinking ship before they got
pulled in.

More accurately, &quot;we don't care a hoot about retailers&quot;.  Anyone who
wants Windows XP on their laptop can order it from Dell, HP, Lenovo,
Gateway, Acer, Toshiba, Sony or the rest of the &quot;top 10&quot; vendors via
the web and simply request XP.  Behind the scenes, what they are
actually doing is purchasing a Vista Business license and the OEM is
providing the downgrade to XP at no additional cost.  The OEM simply
ships a hard drive that has been preconfigured with XP instead of one
that is pre-configured with Vista Business.

At this point, the price, when ordered via phone or web, is only about
$20 more.  This is about 1/2 the cost of the full license at OEM
quantity prices.

The problem is that the machines sent to RETAILERS is only configured
with Vista Home Basic or Vista Home Premium.  Most stores won't even
take the machines with Vista Home Basic anymore because those buying
it have been having their computers disabled by WGA.  It seems that if
you install iTunes, Rhapsody, or other media players on Home BASIC,
it's a violation of the license.  If you attempt to run Home BASIC as
a VM client, your License to ANY use of Home BASIC is revoked.
Retailers had so many returns of Home Basic, that they have just gone
with Home Premium.

The problem is that if you want to upgrade to Vista Business so you
can downgrade to XP again, you have to purchase both upgrades in
cardboard boxes and do it yourself.  Again, most people just end up
returning the machine and ordering one via the Web.

I wonder, is Microsoft is counting these returns in their license
counts?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &quot;But he said any small business with difficulties over Vista should

If you have a PC with an extended warranty, return it and have it
upgraded.  If you can't return it, call Microsoft and they will charge
you for BOTH the upgrade AND the downgrade.  Remember, if you
purchased your Vista license as part of an OEM PC, then you can't call
Microsoft directly, you have to call the manufacturer.  In most cases,
Manufacturers will offer to &quot;swap out&quot; your hard drive for one that's
pre-loaded with XP.  You have to purchase the upgrade to Vista
Business and you have to pay shipping and handling, and you won't be
getting installation media (though some OEMs offer installation media
for a nominal charge), but you can usually get the upgrade to XP for
less than $100, compared to almost $159 in the stores.

Appearantly there were a number of people who tried to upgrade to
Vista and then hated it so much they wanted to switch back to XP.
Several Magazines included XP Recovery CDs because there was such
demand.  I wonder if Microsoft counted those licenses as Vista?

I think Microsoft is acutely aware of the problem.  Steve and Bill are
putting up a good front, but a number of executives have left the
company after years of service.  At least one gave up a substantial
bonus because he was in such a hurry to get out.

I think the story was in InfoWorld or ComputerWorld.  Unfortunately,
both publications purge their web content after only a few days.

I also like the way they invite small businesses who are having
problems to contact the company directly.  Perhaps Microsoft wants
these companies to sign nondisclosure agreements prior to the
discussion, and then promise not to tell anyone about the problems
they have been having with the transition to Vista?

I'm beginning to wonder how long before the whole mess explodes in
their faces.  Microsoft can lie to the press.  Microsoft can lie to
the public.  They can even make misleading statements on their SEC
filings, but Microsoft's REAL customers - the OEMS and large
corporations, aren't so easily fooled.  You can put all the sugar on
the doggie droppings you want, even pile it high with sweet frosting,
but if you are the one who has to actually EAT that doggie poo, you
KNOW it's not chocolate cake you are eating.

Microsoft has tried to make their REAL customers eat Vista, which has
turned out to be sugar coated doggie poo.  And the OEMs are the ones
watching Microsoft report 40% inclease in revenue and profits, while
they are looking at rapidly diminishing revenue, minimal profits or
even deep losses and subsidies of the PC business, and beginning to
look at Microsoft in a completely different way.

Remember, Microsoft was &quot;indespensible&quot; only when they could assure
the creation of a huge market that produced huge profits.  At this
point, Microsoft has delivered a huge market that is generating huge
LOSSES.  Fortunately, companies like HP and Dell have other sources of
revenue, and they can offset the losses in the PC business with
profits from printers, HDTVs, servers, consulting, and software
profits.  Gateway isn't so lucky.  They have been bleeding red ink for
years.  Their stock price dropped so low that they were on the verge
of being delisted.  Acer snapped up the company at a fraction of it's
price when XP was released, and will have to make radical changes to
the product and marketing (here's where Linux and Microsoft collide),
in order to make that brand profitable again.

It should be noted that ACER has been focusing it's efforts on making
&quot;Linux Ready&quot; PCs, and has done very well in that market.  Machines
were sold with XP, but could be converted to SUSE or Ubuntu Linux in
less than an hour and EVERYTHING worked.  To Acer, Microsoft Windows
licenses are more of a nuicance than an indespensible feature, and
Vista has become a liablity.

IBM just scuttled their PC business, selling off nearly all of it's
desktop and laptop lines to Lenovo.  IBM still sells the
Intellistation, which are offered with the choice of Linux or Windows
XP (NOT Vista).  The Intellistation Power series offers the choice of
Linux and/or AIX.

They aren't cheap, but they are powerful and quite competitive with
the Apple high end systems.

Maybe this (at least partly) explains recent sales trend with Macs?
http://www.itpro.co.uk/wireless/news/132230/massive-jump-in-mac-sales...

&quot;Apple has once again surprised analysts and the markets by turning in
another massive jump in quarterly earnings and sales, again fuelled by
growth in its computer business rather than just sales of its iPod digital
media device.  The company shipped 2.164 million Macintosh computers, 34
per cent up on the same quarter last year. The biggest seller was again its
MacBook and MacBook Pro laptop lines, selling a total of 1.347 million
units compared with 817,000 desktop computers.&quot;

Of course withdrawal of support for XP is a way of forcing users to
&quot;upgrade&quot; to Vista.  Certainly when Microsoft postponed the day of
reckoning they did so only because it seemed the lesser of two evils
(from their standpoint), that is, the user dissatisfaction with Vista
was too large and Vista itself in too incomplete a form.  This is not
new with MS in fact lots of companies have done similar things in the
past.  But one way Linux has already hurt Microsoft is that it has
delayed their dropping of support for older systems, for example,
Windows 98, out of fear that people would switch.   That fear is still
present, but now there's a new element, the threat from the Mac, whose
market share is growing.  Meanwhile, the market share of Windows, all
Windows systems combined, including Vista, that is, has shrunk
slightly.   Most of my friends who are XP users are planning to buy a
Mac when they are forced to upgrade.   When they do, I will convert
their old PC's to Ubuntu.  Have already tested it out on one of my
friend's XP systems (with a Live CD), and he was impressed.

The quotes are from MS and are to do with downgrading your vista after
purchasing it and not for still buying a machine with XP....generally
you were not allowed to.

&gt; Maybe this (at least partly) explains recent sales trend with Macs?
&gt; http://www.itpro.co.uk/wireless/news/132230/massive-jump-in-mac-sales...

&gt; &quot;Apple has once again surprised analysts and the markets by turning in
&gt; another massive jump in quarterly earnings and sales, again fuelled by
&gt; growth in its computer business rather than just sales of its iPod digital
&gt; media device.  The company shipped 2.164 million Macintosh computers, 34
&gt; per cent up on the same quarter last year. The biggest seller was again its
&gt; MacBook and MacBook Pro laptop lines, selling a total of 1.347 million
&gt; units compared with 817,000 desktop computers.&quot;

">

The ipod seems to have done Apple a huge good.....made it lots of
profit, put it out there in front as a gadget to have taking the apple
brand with it and allowing a large investment into its Macs....

MS also seems to have done Apple a huge good, releasing Vista, an OSX
clone that does not work, so users get to see what they want so go to
Apple to get it....then of course they released yet another an operating
systemn that cannot survive in a trojan-virus laden environment.....

It is also noticeable that the trend is for mac laptops which is where
many PC sales are going these days....

$4600 for a 17inch Mac pro.....ouch....but nice.

It is common knowledge that OEM's get very significant kickbacks from
Micro$oft for saying something like &quot;Joe Bloggs Computers recommends
Vista&quot;.

There are two aspects to this people ought to realize:
1.  The payments are not contracturally enforceable (in terms of M$'s
OEM agreements), so M$ can turn off the $$$ spigot at any time if the
OEM gets up MS's nose.

2.  For multinational OEM's, I have a strong suspicion that these
payments effectively shift taxable profits to a low tax country like
the Irish Republic, so MS and the OEM effectively bilk the tax offices
of countries like New Zealand, Australia, UK etc.

&gt;&gt; &gt;June 30, 2008.

&gt;&gt; &gt;In an effort to respond to feedback the company is hearing from its
&gt;&gt; &gt;customers and partners, Microsoft is extending availability of Windows
&gt;&gt; &gt;XP editions among original equipment manufacturers (OEM) and retail
&gt;&gt; &gt;channels for an additional five months to June 30, 2008.

&gt;&gt; You gotta like the M$ spin:

&gt;&gt; Nash: &quot;While we've been pleased with the positive response we've seen
&gt;&gt; and heard from customers using Windows Vista, there are some customers
&gt;&gt; who need a little more time to make the switch to Windows Vista.&quot;

&gt;&gt; Translation:

&gt;&gt; &quot;We tried to bully our customers into buying what is, for many of
&gt;&gt; them, a completely inappropriate product, requiring far greater
&gt;&gt; hardware resources, with little or no benefit.  Additionally,
&gt;&gt; customers complained that they had no desire to change to a new and
&gt;&gt; unproven version of our bloatware, at least until the first major
&gt;&gt; &quot;service pack&quot; has been released.  So, even though a few misguided
&gt;&gt; souls actually like Vista and gave positive feedback, the outpouring
&gt;&gt; of dissatisfaction over it's drawbacks, and over our customer-hostile
&gt;&gt; policies, forced us to backpedal and continue to offer the older
&gt;&gt; product.&quot;

&gt;I also like the way they invite small businesses who are having
&gt;problems to contact the company directly.  Perhaps Microsoft wants
&gt;these companies to sign nondisclosure agreements prior to the
&gt;discussion, and then promise not to tell anyone about the problems
&gt;they have been having with the transition to Vista?
">

Is there any fact behind that statement? When I read that I thought
perhaps they want to help them resolve any issues they are having.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;I'm beginning to wonder how long before the whole mess explodes in
&gt;their faces.  Microsoft can lie to the press.  Microsoft can lie to

&gt;the doggie droppings you want, even pile it high with sweet frosting,
&gt;but if you are the one who has to actually EAT that doggie poo, you
&gt;KNOW it's not chocolate cake you are eating.

&gt;Microsoft has tried to make their REAL customers eat Vista, which has
&gt;turned out to be sugar coated doggie poo.  And the OEMs are the ones
&gt;watching Microsoft report 40% inclease in revenue and profits, while
&gt;they are looking at rapidly diminishing revenue, minimal profits or
&gt;even deep losses and subsidies of the PC business, and beginning to
&gt;look at Microsoft in a completely different way.

Again, is there any fact behind that statement?  Are the OEM's really
losing money on the Vista systems they are selling?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Remember, Microsoft was &quot;indespensible&quot; only when they could assure
&gt;the creation of a huge market that produced huge profits.  At this

&gt;revenue, and they can offset the losses in the PC business with
&gt;profits from printers, HDTVs, servers, consulting, and software

Acer: PC Industry 'Disappointed' with Vista

Acer president Gianfranco Lanci today became the first major PC
manufacturer to openly attack Microsoft over the Windows Vista
operating system.

Matthew Broersma, Techworld
Monday, July 23, 2007 2:00 PM PDT

Acer president Gianfranco Lanci today became the first major PC
manufacturer to openly attack  Microsoft over the Windows Vista
operating system. He was quoted in the Financial Times Deutschland .

Lanci said the operating system was riddled with problems and
gave users and businesses no reason to buy a new PC, according to
the report. Taiwan-based Acer is the world's fourth-largest PC
manufacturer, after HP, Dell and Lenovo.

&quot;The whole industry is disappointed with Windows Vista,&quot; Lanci said.

Despite the long wait between Windows XP and Vista, the latest
operating system still lacks maturity, he said. &quot;Stability is
certainly a problem,&quot; he said.

Users are voting with their feet, Lanci said, so that the Vista
launch has had the smallest impact on PC sales of any version of
Windows in the history of PC manufacturing. He added the
situation didn't look likely to change in the next six months.

Many business customers have specifically asked for Windows XP to
be installed on their new machines, Lanci noted.

Another Inconvenient Truth?

November 1, 2007 at 12:46 pm

The headline for this post was not written by me, but Scott Graham:

[Scott Graham]  Windows Vista? What more can I say, I personally
have had (in the past) a few speed-bumps along the way but not
much to “rant” about. Friends and family on the other hand, not
so good. Blue screen of death, “do you want to open this, do you
want to do that?” it feels like Vista is a letdown and them
problems seem to be dominating the consumer’s choice over whether
or not to purchase the OS. Only a week before the release of
Leopard (OS X) did I receive an email regarding a move from a
Window’s power-user to Mac simply because of Windows Vista. Now
of course with the release of Leopard I now couldn’t recommend a
Mac more but should Windows power-users consider a move to Mac
before looking at Windows alternatives?

Should they? Hell yes. Do they? Hell no.

This morning, I finally had a reason to use the Windows DVD Maker
for a project (Spike TV wants to use some of my wacky YouTube
videos for one of their shows). The experience with this
particular Vista program was impressively simple - up until the
point where I went to burn the DVD. 4.8% into the process, I
received a generic dialog claiming that “An error occurred when
burning the DVD.” No word on what caused this error, or how to
fix it.

The process in iDVD was a bit more involved, but at least it
worked for me in the end (and let it be known that iDVD is
slightly more complicated, but not overwhelming). I could’ve
downloaded DVD Styler, as recommended to me by someone in the
chat room, but I’m guessing that most users would stick with what
ships on their computer OOTB.
[quote]

Here is something that I observe the same in Ubuntu, that I have
been using:

[quote]
[Scott Graham]  In my opinion people should instead of simply
being told “what is wrong” with Vista should be told what the
alternatives are (e.g. XP) before they jump in the deep end. What
do you think to what I believe is an ever-growing “myth” that
Windows is becoming completely Vista territory and should as a
result users having issues (whilst Leopard remains a superb OS)
should take this giant leap to an entirely new environment over a
few driver problems that may well be a thing of the past after
the pending release of SP1?

Rinse and repeat. In the time that it’s taken Microsoft to get
from XP to Vista, Apple has released 10.0, 10.1, 10.2, 10.3,
10.4, and now 10.5. With each release, the OS X core gets a
little bit better. Knowing that all software has bugs, Apple has
also released incremental patches with frequency - rather than
scheduling massive update roll-ups (”Service Packs”) to their
customer base. Windows users are typically made to hunt down
patches from an unwieldy Knowledge Base (and in some cases,
request the patch from Microsoft before they can download it).

“What is wrong” is less about Vista itself, and more about the
corporate decisions that gave you Vista - and will potentially
give you “Windows 7″ in 2009. It’s coming from the same company,
folks. And if you’re ready to call me a Microsoft basher, take a
step back. I like many things that Microsoft produces.
[/quote]

With Unbuntu, within the past year, I have gone from:

Edgy Eft, Version 6.10, to
Feisty Fawn, Version 7.04, to
Gutsy Gibbon, Version 7.10.

Meanwhile, I have received all patches as they become available.
Upgrade has been painless.  This is simply an awesome OS to
work with, a real pleasure, super stable.

&gt;&gt;and start ganging up on us.

&gt; XP is available from Dell and other brands...  in America and till January
&gt; 31st 2008.

Not on all machines. I recently got my Inspiron 1720 lapcrusher from
Dell, and XP was not offered when I specified the thing. It has Vista
Home Premium, and now openSUSE 10.3 installed.

Vista I'm not impressed with - by default its far too intrusive on my
computing experience, with popups, pointless notifications, and the
dumb box asking my permission to install stuff I clicked on. Why else
would I click on an installer? openSUSE works 100% with every hardware
device on the machine, so I use that for day-to-day only booting Vista
to play the odd game, which the laptop handles well (its a Core 2 7250
@ 2 GHz, with 2GB RAM, a GeForce 8600M GT, and 1920x1200 truelife LCD).

&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;The XP downgrade option was available only to buyers of the business
&gt;&gt;&gt; version of Vista, said Rayner, because users of the home editions,
&gt;&gt;&gt; even if they were small businesses, would not be badly affected.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt; 1.  We are scared stiff that larrge corporates will go the Linux /
&gt;&gt;&gt; Open Office / ODF way if we continue to try and ram Vista down their
&gt;&gt;&gt; throats.

&gt;&gt; Maybe this (at least partly) explains recent sales trend with Macs?
&gt;&gt; http://www.itpro.co.uk/wireless/news/132230/massive-jump-in-mac-sales...

&gt;&gt; &quot;Apple has once again surprised analysts and the markets by turning in
&gt;&gt; another massive jump in quarterly earnings and sales, again fuelled by
&gt;&gt; growth in its computer business rather than just sales of its iPod
&gt;&gt; digital
&gt;&gt; media device.  The company shipped 2.164 million Macintosh computers, 34
&gt;&gt; per cent up on the same quarter last year. The biggest seller was
&gt;&gt; again its
&gt;&gt; MacBook and MacBook Pro laptop lines, selling a total of 1.347 million
&gt;&gt; units compared with 817,000 desktop computers.&quot;

&gt; The ipod seems to have done Apple a huge good.....made it lots of
&gt; profit, put it out there in front as a gadget to have taking the apple
&gt; brand with it and allowing a large investment into its Macs....

&gt; MS also seems to have done Apple a huge good, releasing Vista, an OSX
&gt; clone that does not work, so users get to see what they want so go to
&gt; Apple to get it....then of course they released yet another an operating
&gt; systemn that cannot survive in a trojan-virus laden environment.....

&gt; It is also noticeable that the trend is for mac laptops which is where
&gt; many PC sales are going these days....

&gt; $4600 for a 17inch Mac pro.....ouch....but nice.

Ouch indeed! My Dell Inspiron 1720 landed 2 weeks back and once I
arrange the salary sacrifice with work it'll cost me ~AU$1400, but
without salary sacrifice its still only AU$2150. I think the Mac
has a 2.4GHz C2D (mine is 2.0GHz), but RAM and graphics are same
I think (2GB RAM, 8600M GT graphics on a 17&quot; 1920x1200 LCD). Mac
is fine, but if you remove the 'cool factor' you can buy similarly
spec'd laptops elsewhere for much less money...
