Joe Walsh is a homeboy of mine (he's from Wichita, too)!
Did you know Glen Frey is his cousin? Got him in the Eagles so he
could keep Joe (and his drinking problem) under control.

He's a real regular guy, when I was in the music store biz I ran into
him all the time - either here in Wichita, or at the NAMM convention
in Anaheim every January.

Met him once after a big tornado hit town, and he asked me if I still
had my roof (I did).

Oh, yes - he can also SPANK THE PLANK!

Joe Walsh was born in Wichita - later his family moved to Ohio where
he did go to Kent State (during the Massacre).
He's lived in Chicago, New York, and LA as his music career moved him
around.

I didn't know he and Glenn Frey were cousins.

I live in Kent, OH now, and have for almost 16 years.  I had always
heard that the James Gang had been the house band at JB's on North
Water St. back in the late '60's. Later, Eric Carmen and the
Raspberries played there a bunch I'm told.   Joe Walsh was actually
the main attraction in the KSU Homecoming Parade probably five or six
years ago (can't think of the official name of someone who does
that!)...he finally got an honorary degree.  He looked like he had a
good time in the parade and seemed to be a good sport.  Other notable
locals who went to KSU include Devo and Drew Carey.

Come on smartass, you wrote this much... spit it out.  Are you one of those
over protective parents with 30 year old children still living at home too?
Actually I didn't officially leave home until I was 22, spent my summers
there between college years.  At 22 I was old enough to be out on my own and
didn't need mommy and daddy providing for me.
