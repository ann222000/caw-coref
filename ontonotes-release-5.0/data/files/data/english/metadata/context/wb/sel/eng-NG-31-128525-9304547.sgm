About Berean Christian Stores:
Overview
Berean Christian Stores is a regional chain of Christian bookstores based in Cincinnati, OH. Our stores are located primarily in the mid-west region and California/Arizona in the west. We offer a large assortment of biblically based products in an easy-to-shop environment. Our stores feature Christian books, Bibles, music, gifts, home décor, jewelry, cards, apparel, church supplies and curriculum. And what we don't have in our stores, we can Special Order to meet the Christian resource needs of our customers.

Importantly, Berean Christian Stores works to ensure that the products in our stores are correct on the person and work of Jesus Christ. And we're working to provide a shopping experience that is focused on great service, a broad product assortment and fair prices with special values offered everyday. Berean's stores offer products to meet the needs of consumers and churches alike, and we take seriously the commitment to serve all customers effectively.

Berean Christian Stores cares about families and kids, and hosts events every month in our stores centered on them. These events include our annual Kids Day, as well as monthly events, such as Story Time and American Girls Club.

With more than 70 years of experience serving Christian customers and churches, our goal is to continue to serve you, and provide quality products to our customers throughout the country.

Mission
At Berean Christian Stores our &quot;calling&quot; or mission is to exemplify Christian principles as we provide Christian and Inspirational products and services in an atmosphere of integrity, innovation and excellence.

History
In Biblical times, the members of the church at Berea were recognized by the Apostle Paul for their careful study and analysis of the Scriptures. This New Testament reference suggests that Berea was a center of learning and information for people interested in growing and maturing as Christian believers.

Berean's stores throughout the United States are also centers for learning and information. Our business is to provide individual Christians, churches, schools, and other Christian agencies with the Biblically-based and inspirational resources they need to do their work, aid their spiritual growth, stretch their thinking, and anchor their faith.

The first Berean store opened in Los Angeles in 1934 as the Berean Book Room. By the 1960's, when Standex International purchased the stores, the owners had opened more than 25 stores. Today, Berean Christian Stores, headquartered in Cincinnati, Ohio operates some of the finest Christian retail stores in the country.

Berean remained a division of Standex International until 2006. Recognizing their focus on manufacturing companies, Standex decided to divest Berean (and then-sister-company Standard Publishing). In August 2006, management and JMH Capital, a private equity firm based in Boston, MA, purchased Berean. Under new ownership, Berean looks to the future with optimism for growth and the opportunity to serve a broader community of Christian consumers and churches.

Rooted in Faith
At Berean Christian Stores, our business is ministry. It is about reaching out to people, in faith, and striving to make a difference in the communities in which we have stores, and the country as a whole. Being rooted in faith is about our people, our products and our commitment to our customers.

There are many people who go to work everyday wanting to make a positive difference in the world. At Berean, we have the privilege of serving God's people in everything we do. We are a team of people committed to our faith, and to helping others nurture their faith, or kindle the spirit that dwells within those who have not yet come to fully appreciate their relationship with God. From our frontline Sales Associates, to the people behind the scenes helping to make our stores a success, we are a team of people whose faith is a guiding light for the way we do business.

There are many ways to make a positive difference in our world. At Berean Christian Stores, our role is to offer individuals, families and churches resources that support their faith development. Whether it is someone's first Bible, a Christian-themed kids video, life-nurturing Christian music, apparel, gifts, cards,...the list goes on and on. At Berean, we are careful to only offer products that, when dealing with Jesus Christ, are true to His person and work: Products that serve to help people develop their faith, nurture their faith and grow in their faith. It is an environment in which you can be assured that your kids can pick up products in our stores and not be bombarded with inappropriate messages and images. It is a place where you can find resources that can help you in your faith development, or help others in theirs. And it is a destination for finding gifts that reflect your faith and values, and that readily touch the hearts of others.

It is a great feeling to be Rooted in Faith. It is about keeping the right focus in our lives. To be true to the will of God as we live out our daily commitments. That is what we do at Berean Christian Stores. Our people are rooted in faith, our products are rooted in faith, and our commitment to our customers is rooted in faith. At Berean, to be rooted in faith is the way we live and work - it is about our daily walk with Jesus.
