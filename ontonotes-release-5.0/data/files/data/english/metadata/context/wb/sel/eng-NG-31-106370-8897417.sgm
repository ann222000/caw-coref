Lies, beatings, secret trials: the dark side of police handling Madeleine
case

By DAVID ROSE
Mail on Sunday
Last updated at 23:39pm on 15th September 2007

According to his friends, Chief Inspector Goncalo Amaral of the Portuguese
Policia Judiciaria, co-leader of the investigation into the disappearance of
Madeleine McCann from the Mark Warner Ocean Club in Praia da Luz, is a
dedicated and capable detective, determined to do whatever it takes to find
her ­ or those responsible for murdering her.

As a foreign reporter in Portugal, it is difficult to form a view. Thanks to
the country's stringent judicial secrecy laws, Amaral is officially
forbidden from talking to the media.

I confronted the sweaty, corpulent figure in an ill-fitting jacket twice
last Friday: the first time at 10am, as he sat slurping coffee and cakes at
the Kalahary cafe in Portimao with his colleague, Chief Inspector
Guillermino Encarnacao; the second just before 3pm, when the two men made
their way from a restaurant to a waiting black Mercedes, in which they were
driven 400 yards to meet officials at the courthouse.

The reaction was the same both times: &quot;No speak! No speak!&quot; was all Amaral
would say, making a swatting motion as though batting away an insect.

But Amaral's official silence is not the only difference between him and his
counterparts in Britain.

In the UK, it is unlikely he would be leading the McCann inquiry at all.

Madeleine's parents Kate and Gerry may never be charged with anything,
despite their present status as arguidos, or official suspects, and by the
end of last week, apparently well-placed sources were admitting that any
case against them is circumstantial and weak.

Amaral, however, is in a similar position. He, too, is an arguido, facing
possible trial on a serious criminal charge arising from a murder case
brought to court in 2004, the last occasion a little girl vanished in the
Algarve.

The Mail on Sunday can today reveal new details of this case, the subject of
a draconian judicial order that has stopped most sources who know about the
case from talking to the Portuguese Press.

According to the order, documents about the case have been restricted to a
handful of officials, while the next stage of the process ­ a hearing at
which Amaral and four fellow officers may be asked formal questions ­ will
be conducted in secret.

It is believed that this is set for next month.

Three of Amaral's senior PJ colleagues have been made suspects for the
torture of the missing girl's mother, Leonor Cipriano, who has been
convicted of killing her daughter Joana, aged eight, and jailed for 16
years.

As for Amaral, the claim against him is &quot;omisado de denuncia&quot; ­ that he
tried to hide the evidence of the alleged torture or, in other words,
attempted a cover-up. He is said to deny it strenuously.

In internet blogs and newspaper columns, Amaral's supporters have claimed
that the Cipriano case is built on lies ­ a vicious smear against a decent
detective trying to do his job.

It has, they say, &quot;no connection&quot; to the Madeleine McCann inquiry.

Experienced lawyers in Portimao, the town 12 miles from Praia da Luz where
Amaral is PJ chief, disagree.

The case against the detectives began as a complaint lodged by Cipriano's
lawyer, they pointed out, but has now been adopted by the public prosecutor.

&quot;In order to bring formal charges, the public prosecutor has to believe
there is a strong case,&quot; said Oliveira Trindad, who has practised law in the
area for more than ten years.

&quot;That means that after assessing all the evidence, he thinks that if the
case goes to trial, a conviction is more likely than not.&quot;

That decision is likely to be made well before the McCann case is closed.

There are, to be sure, many differences between Leonor Cipriano and Kate
McCann.

But there are also similarities, starting with the fact that although the
bodies of their daughters have not been found, Amaral and his PJ colleagues
have long been convinced that both girls are dead.

No one would suggest that in the course of the marathon interrogations that
preceded their departure from Portugal last weekend, Kate or Gerry McCann
were the victims of physical violence.

But at times it seemed they were also being subjected to torment, albeit of
a different, psychological kind.

It, too, say Portimao's criminal defence lawyers, may have been inspired by
PJ officers desperate to achieve the end they sought with Cipriano ­ a
confession.

It isn't hard to locate the source of some of the McCanns' current
difficulties: Hugo Beaty's bar.

There, amid the burnt orange concrete of the Estrela apartment complex, a
five-minute walk from the Ocean Club, most of the seats along the shady
terrace and more inside will be taken all day by reporters with laptops,
authors of a daily verbal torrent that has come to seem unstoppable.

After Kate and Gerry's abrupt return to Leicestershire last Sunday, almost
nothing happened in the McCann case last week.

The only verified fact is that after considering a ten-volume PJ dossier
about Madeleine's disappearance on May 3, Pedro Miguel dos Anjos Frias, a
junior judge in Portimao, decided to grant certain requests made by the
prosecutor, Joao Cunha de Magalhaes.

Every news outlet covering the story ­ a waterfront that now extends across
the whole of Europe to the major American TV networks and even,
unbelievably, a paper in war-torn Somalia ­ has stated that these requests
were for warrants to seize items including Kate McCann's private diary,
Gerry's computer and (though this seems slightly less certain) Madeleine's
beloved cuddle cat.

There is, however, nothing approaching official confirmation of these
claims.

Like everything else about the case, the details of the prosecutor's
approach to the judge are covered, supposedly, by the judicial secrecy laws,
under which the penalty ­ in theory ­ for making unauthorised disclosures is
two years in prison.

Thus it is that like almost everything else being broadcast and published
beyond Portugal's borders about the hunt for Madeleine, the claim that the
police want to read Kate's diary has reached its audience via Hugo Beaty's
bar.

Every day there starts the same way shortly after it opens at 9am, with an
informal briefing to the foreign Press by a locally resident British woman
who normally makes a meagre living acting as an occasional interpreter ­ for
the Policia Judiciaria.

Every morning, the woman ­ who asked me not to publish her name ­ goes
through the Portuguese tabloids and translates their ever-more febrile
articles.

Every afternoon, the foreigners ­ almost none of whom can speak more than
the most basic Portuguese, nor claim a single, genuine source inside the
police investigation ­ recycle the tales for consumers abroad.

By the end of last week, some of the assertions made by the Portuguese had
become part of a settled consensus.

For example, it was reported from Berlin to Baltimore that the police had
already made a photocopy of Kate's diary ­ which, if true, would mean they
had broken the law ­ and merely wanted to obtain the judge's approval to use
it as evidence.

The reason they are so keen on it, it was alleged, is that it suggests she
found her children &quot;hyperactive&quot; and difficult to handle, while railing at
her husband's allegedly dilatory, hands-off approach.

The claims about the diary's contents were first published on Thursday by
Jose Manuel Ribeiro, crime correspondent for the Lisbon daily Diario de
Noticias.

By chance I ran into him that same afternoon, outside the apartment where
Madeleine disappeared.

I congratulated him on his scoop, but he shook his head, disconsolate.
Already, he complained, it was turning to dust.

Ribeiro said he had been given the story by an impeccable inside source, but
already officials in Lisbon were denying it, and the source himself could no
longer assure him it was true.

&quot;Why is bad information getting out to the public?&quot; he asked. &quot;Because we're
being given it.&quot;

Somehow, however, the denials that had made Ribeiro so angry did not get
through to the foreigners.

If the questionable leak had been planted for a purpose ­ to increase the
pressure on the hapless McCanns ­ it may well have succeeded.

And, in the foreign public's mind, the germinating notion that Kate might
have killed her daughter because she could not handle her had been nurtured
by a further dollop of manure.

A similar, apparently sanctioned but inaccurate leak had already gone around
the world to still more devastating effect.

Early on Monday evening, TV channels began to report that British forensic
scientists had made a &quot;100 per cent&quot; DNA match to Madeleine from &quot;biological
material&quot; ­ said to be hair and &quot;bodily fluids&quot; ­ recovered from the Renault
Scenic that the McCanns did not hire until 25 days after she vanished,
suggesting that they had hidden her body on May 3 and moved it weeks after
her death.

With no time for reporters to make checks before their deadlines, the story
spread like foot and mouth to almost every British front page the next
morning.

It was only in the ensuing days that it began, spectacularly, to unravel.

The match was not 100 per cent after all, it transpired, but 80 per cent or
less ­ a level that, according to Professor Alec Jeffries, DNA matching's
inventor, might mean that the material had not come from Madeleine at all,
but another member of her family.

Even if it had, other experts said, it would prove very little.

Among readers who followed the forensic details, the case against the
McCanns had been seen to suffer damage.

But others were left with a clear impression ­ that the PJ now believed they
had real evidence that the McCanns must have been responsible for
Madeleine's (still unconfirmed) death.

As for those who still harboured doubts, more rococo &quot;revelations&quot; were
being published widely by the end of the week, such as the claim that having
bundled Madeleine's body into the car, the McCanns drove it to the marina in
nearby Lagos.

There they are said to have hired a boat, swore its owner into their
conspiracy, then sailed into the Atlantic, into which they tipped their
child, weighted down with rocks.

Could such stories really be part of a conscious PJ strategy? Some lawyers
around the Portimao courthouse believe that they could.

&quot;Portuguese journalists aren't just making this stuff up,&quot; said Oliveira
Trindad.

&quot;They are getting it from the police, of course, and the justice officers,
the people working for the prosecutors. It's obvious that some information
is coming from the PJ.&quot;

Some of it, he added, appears to be accurate ­ so making it that much easier
for the same sources to seed disinformation.

Another Portimao lawyer, who asked not to be named, claimed the PJ was
fighting a &quot;propaganda war&quot; with the McCanns.

&quot;It is the fault of the British Press,&quot; he said.

&quot;They were the ones who started saying, 'You're no good, you're no good.'

&quot;If you say a lie like that many times, so many people believe it. You
cannot blame the PJ for wanting to hit back.&quot;

But there might be another reason.

&quot;Some people think journalists pay their PJ sources,&quot; the second lawyer
said, citing a case where an officer from Lisbon is facing criminal charges
after being caught red-handed copying secret documents about a fraud case,
allegedly for private profit.

&quot;But they also have an interest in the case and its coverage.&quot;

With the forensic evidence apparently confused and contradictory, &quot;it seems
the main goal of the PJ now is to get a confession. It's like in the films,
'Aha, we have a confession, let's take them to court.'

&quot;It's normal to want a confession when they don't have much else.&quot;

Intense interrogation of the McCanns has so far failed. But perhaps, the
lawyer implied, using the media might be another way of applying the third
degree.

&quot;I want to believe that the Portuguese police do everything the right way,&quot;
said Joao Grade, the lawyer for Leonor Cipriano.

&quot;But sometimes, if they really think someone is guilty, as they did with
Leonor, they may find other ways to get what they want. It's only human.

&quot;When they believe someone has killed a child, it's normal that they will
apply pressure.

&quot;In the McCann case, it seems that the police have what they consider
half-proofs.

&quot;But it's not airtight, it doesn't interlock, so maybe they need more.&quot;

As he spoke, I found myself recalling British miscarriages of justice: cases
such as the Birmingham Six, wrongly convicted of IRA pub bombings that
killed 21, where the police, under tremendous pressure to &quot;get a result&quot;,
built dishonest but convincing prosecutions based around confessions.

Could the same thing be happening to the McCanns? The pressure on the police
is certainly intense.

The loss of a child evokes horror everywhere. On the Algarve, however, the
need to solve the case ­ and, perhaps, not to leave the fear that Madeleine
was killed or abducted by an unknown paedophile ­ has other roots as well.

&quot;The Algarve is a family destination, and situations like this are not
agreeable to anyone,&quot; said Elderico Viegas, the regional tourism authority
president.

&quot;Our reputation for safety is one of our most important values ­ especially
with the British, who make up our biggest market.&quot;

And Algarve tourism, worth about £2.8billion a year and growing rapidly, is,
Viegas said, the single biggest component of the entire Portuguese economy.

The police had, he added, mishandled the media, giving rise to damaging
speculation.

&quot;But for me, the details are not important. What's important is the economy.
I was born and brought up here and I can't remember the last time a tourist
was murdered.&quot; So far, he added, visitor numbers this year are up.

Central to many British miscarriages of justice was a shared, deeply
ingrained belief among police and prosecutors that their suspects &quot;had&quot; to
be guilty.

With the Birmingham Six, it was founded on botched forensic tests that
&quot;told&quot; investigators that the men had been handling the explosive
nitroglycerine ­ false positives that arose because they had been playing
with cards coated in the harmless chemical nitrocellulose.

In Praia da Luz, there are signs of a similar mindset at work, derived from
equally tendentious &quot;evidence&quot;.

For example, said a local source who knows several of the PJ inquiry team,
from an early stage detectives laid great weight on Kate McCann's apparent
composure when she appeared in public.

One of the strangest aspects of Portuguese coverage of the case has been
frequent recourse to media psychologists, who have made all manner of
deductions about her personality and state of mind by &quot;analysing&quot; her TV
image, claiming that the absence of tears and presence of carefully applied
make-up indicates a &quot;cold&quot;, &quot;manipulative&quot; or even &quot;psychopathic&quot;
personality.

In other words, someone capable of reacting instantly to the death of her
daughter, whether deliberate or accidental, by deciding that she had to hide
the body and conceal what had happened, and able to persuade her husband and
perhaps other &quot;accomplices&quot; to go along with her plot.

Disturbingly, said the local source, such analysis has not been confined to
the media.

&quot;Pretty early on, they had forensic psychologists in, studying hours of
video footage, drawing extremely unfavourable conclusions about Kate's
personality,&quot; she said.

&quot;You could say she's been damned by her stiff upper lip.&quot;

There have been reported claims that Kate McCann had &quot;confessed&quot; to killing
Madeleine to a local Catholic priest.

But the Rev Hubbard Haynes, the Anglican vicar who lives in Praia da Luz and
got closer to the McCanns than anyone during their months in Portugal,
refuted them with controlled fury.

A young, passionate Canadian, who took up his post a week after Madeleine's
disappearance, he said: &quot;When I mention Maddie, Gerry and Kate in my own
prayers, I find myself weeping.

&quot;I have gone out into the fields and looked in the hedgerows, begging God
for some sign that will help us find her, and I have wept because He has not
given it to us yet.

&quot;All I can say is that my tears are as nothing to the tears I have seen shed
by Kate and Gerry.

&quot;They may not have cried for the cameras, but to say they do not weep in
private is facile and offensive.

&quot;The man and woman I have known for the past four months are a couple whose
lives have become unbearably empty because their little girl was missing.

&quot;I do not recognise those people in recent media reports, and I find the
idea that they had anything to do with her disappearance just inconceivable.

&quot;There is great evil in this world, and someone has taken this child.&quot;

Other aspects of the emerging mindset against the McCanns seemed equally
questionable.

Several Portuguese lawyers and journalists, along with a uniformed police
officer from the National Republican Guard I spoke to outside the Ocean Club
apartment, told me solemnly not only that the McCanns and their friends were
&quot;swingers&quot; who had taken their holiday together to indulge in group sex (an
assertion made repeatedly by the Portuguese Press), but that &quot;everyone
knows&quot; that its tolerance of orgies is the Mark Warner Ocean Club resort's
main selling point.

One afternoon I decided to test this proposition, approaching two holiday
reps there, dressed in their red Mark Warner sweatshirts. &quot;Er, is this a
good place for swingers, then?&quot; I asked.

They looked at me in total bafflement. &quot;Swingers?&quot; one replied.

&quot;Look around you, sir. Most of our guests are retired, or families with
children.&quot;

Another assertion published several times last week is that, on the night
that Madeleine disappeared, the McCanns phoned Sky TV before contacting the
police ­ another claim echoed by the uniformed cop.

Outside the Portimao courthouse, I asked Sky's reporter Ashish Joshi if he
thought this might be true.

He rolled his eyes wearily. &quot;It's just nonsense,&quot; he said.

&quot;The first anyone at Sky knew about Maddy was when the story appeared on the
Press Association wire.

&quot;I was asked about this just yesterday by a Portuguese reporter. I told him
it was crap. And this morning, his paper printed it.&quot;

I passed this on to the Republican Guard officer, but he was unmoved.

His unit, he said, had handled the case in its early stages, and from the
start he and his colleagues had been convinced there was something fishy
about the McCanns.

&quot;My partner was there on the night of May 3,&quot; he said, &quot;and I can tell you,
that apartment was full of people, Kate was screaming ­ and yet her twins
didn't wake up.

&quot;How do you explain that? They must have been drugged. Nobody on the force
believed their story about a kidnap for a moment.

&quot;That little girl is dead, for sure. Soon you will see the truth.&quot;

Why the need for such bizarre allegations? The answer, I believe, is that
there is a massive hole at the heart of the emerging PJ theory.

When Madeleine disappeared the McCanns did not have a car.

The Ocean Club is in the middle of a busy resort, and the notion that
somehow the McCanns found a way to conceal her without transport, and then
went to dinner with their friends as if nothing were amiss is beyond
credibility.

One Portuguese journalist suggested to me that they might have hidden her on
a scrubby headland a few minutes' walk away.

But as I found when I attempted to go for a run there, at night it is
inhabited by feral dogs, whose barking would have made the digging of some
putative shallow grave impossible.

The PJ enjoys a high reputation in Portugal.

&quot;They are ranked among the top five police forces in the world,&quot; attorney
Trindad said, albeit admitting he did not know the source of this curious
international ranking.

Most PJ officers are graduates, and would-be entrants face severe
competition, with a battery of psychometric, physical and academic tests
before they can even be considered for the PJ training school.

The force's Press office likes to compare the PJ to the American FBI: &quot;We
are an elite,&quot; spokeswoman Ana Mouro said.

But beneath the veneer, as the case of Leonor Cipriano suggests, the reality
can look less impressive.

&quot;She is nothing like Kate McCann,&quot; her lawyer Joao Grade said.

&quot;She is very poor, with maybe only three years of schooling, and her
children have several fathers.

&quot;She did not get to meet the Pope and she did not have the support of Sky
and the BBC.

&quot;But I tell you this: if Kate had been treated like Leonor, she would have
done what Leonor did ­ ended by saying, 'OK, OK, I'm guilty, and this is how
I did it.'&quot;

The special judicial order ­ imposed on top of the usual Portuguese secrecy
­ means not only that Grade is prevented from disclosing virtually anything
about the Cipriano case, but that pre-trial hearings of the charges against
the detectives, due as soon as next month, will be held in camera.

The Mail on Sunday has established crucial alleged details from other legal
sources in Portimao.

After Joana disappeared in September 2004, Leonor was arrested by the PJ in
Portimao on October 14 at 8am.

Held there and in the city of Faro without access to a lawyer, she was
interrogated without sleep for 22 hours.

Then, after a two-hour respite, she was interrogated again until 7am on
October 16.

By this time, as photos published by the Portuguese media make clear, her
face was a mass of bruises.

According to Grade: &quot;Not just her face but her whole body was black and
blue.&quot;

The police said she &quot;tried to commit suicide&quot; by throwing herself down
stairs.

If the alleged torture was to force a confession, it succeeded ­ only for
Leonor to withdraw it when she finally saw her lawyer the next day.

The supporters of the accused police have claimed that the officers must be
innocent because Cipriano could not pick out her alleged attackers in an
identity parade.

However, according to the sources in Portimao, this is because they are not
alleged to have beaten her themselves, but to have brought in paid thugs.

In any event, she was convicted and sentenced to 21 years.

Last June, this was reduced on appeal to 16 ­ though one of the five appeal
court judges issued a dissenting opinion, stating that he was convinced she
had been assaulted in custody and was innocent.

If the criminal case against the PJ officers does lead to convictions, Grade
said, she will appeal again. He has also lodged a case in the European Court
of Human Rights.

Strangely enough, Chief Inspector Goncalo Amaral is not the only link
between the Cipriano and McCann cases. Another of the senior officers who is
now an arguido is the recently retired Chief Inspector Paulo Pereira
Cristovao.

He is one of the McCanns' principal scourges ­ not as a detective, but in
his new capacity as a columnist for Diario de Noticias, among the most
active of Portuguese newspapers in its pursuit of stories about Madeleine
derived from leaks.

&quot;There is another link between the Cipriano and McCann cases,&quot; a Portimao
lawyer claimed.

&quot;You know, it's like if Manchester United lose a big game: next week the
pressure they have to win is very big.

&quot;The PJ are beginning to worry that now they might lose the Cipriano case.

&quot;If that happens, they have to win with the McCanns.&quot;

Of course, there is yet another connection.

If Leonor Cipriano did not kill Joana, the chances of discovering the truth
­ or indeed her body ­ are now remote.

And as the McCanns have stated repeatedly, if they are innocent, the
enormous effort being poured into trying to blame them is effort diverted
from the search for a missing four-year-old girl, and the person or persons
who abducted her.

That is a thought so grim that it almost makes one wish that the mindset so
evident around Praia da Luz had a real foundation.

My fear is that it has as much solidity as the sandcastles on the beach.

€ David Rose has been investigating miscarriages of justice for 25 years and
has written several books on the subject.

The most recent, Violation, about a serial murder case in America, was
published by Harper Press in 2007.
