Even if you don't live in the UK.. please pass this on for prayer.. we need it. Send it to all people in UK in your address book

To The Church And Nation Of Britain

I am about to send fire upon you, the fire of My judgment, and it will consume on the right and on the left.  All who have spurned My ways and My words will reap what they have sown, for in My burning anger I will judge the gods in whom you have put your trust, the gods of materialism and covetousness.  The gold and the silver will be taken from you, and your portion will be emptiness, desolation and vanity.
I will bring the stability of your currency into doubt, to show you that it is I alone who caused you to prosper in the past.  I raised you to prominence among the nations and gave you authority over many peoples: so you became rich, and boasted in your wealth, but I will bring you low, and the nations over whom you once ruled will say “What has happened to this great nation?”
As you have feared other gods, and not feared Me, so I will visit your deeds upon you. Your idolatries have led you astray, and you have become like those before whom you bow down.  I commanded your fathers that they should not fear the gods of the nations, but you have not obeyed Me. Therefore I have given you into the hands of abominations and all manner of uncleanness.
Darkness will envelope those who have led my people into false light, for I will no longer forbear in my wrath.  I will blind them, and they shall stumble in the perversity of their ways.  Many shall follow them into darkness and be taken in the snare of the wicked, for they have loved to wander, and they have not watched the path of their feet.
My people give heed to those who prophesy a lie, and they delight in the teachers of falsehood.  They run to those who steal from them by their destructive heresies, for they cannot discern the paths of righteousness. A wave of deception is about to break forth that will sweep many away, therefore take heed to yourselves, and cling to the word of My truth.  I am bringing My Church to a time of testing, and I will search the hearts of all who call upon My name, and I will know those who are mine, and they shall know their God.
My displeasure will be visited upon your Government, for those who rule over you have become offensive to Me, as they have set aside My laws and My statutes, exalting the wicked and despising My holy name.  You have not abhorred bloodshed, therefore the blood of your sons and daughters will lie in your streets, until you learn that as the cry of the unborn calls to me for vengeance, so I shall require it of you.
All these things I will do, because you have rejected Me, and thought that your own power could save you.  Yet even now, if you will cry out to Me, and turn from your wickedness, I will spare.  Nevertheless, I will chasten you in measure, and you shall know that I am the Lord.  My beloved ones, the hour of My patience will not continue much longer.  I call your therefore to seek my face with earnestness and zeal, that I may extend compassion to your land and people.

This prophetic word received by Stewart Dool (who heads up Intercessors for Britain) in the week 23-27 July 2007. It has been weighed and tested by others in senior positions

Job 9:13 God does not restrain his anger; even the cohorts of Rahab cowered at his feet.
Job 26:12 By his power he churned up the sea; by his wisdom he cut Rahab to pieces.
Psalm 89:10 You crushed Rahab like one of the slain; with your strong arm you scattered your enemies.
Isaiah 30:7 to Egypt, whose help is utterly useless. Therefore I call her Rahab the Do-Nothing.

Isaiah 51:9 Awake, awake! Clothe yourself with strength, O arm of the LORD; awake, as in days gone by, as in generations of old. Was it not you who cut Rahab to pieces, who pierced that monster through?

The Power of Integrity: Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness: Mat 5:6 Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness: for they shall be filled. We are living in a world of compromise, in a society that has abandoned moral standards and Christian principles in favor of expediency or practicality. The underlying philosophy is based on accomplishing goals by whatever means are necessary. This self-centered perspective should have as its motto: “If it works for you, do it”. This is a notion that inevitably leads to compromise of conscience and convictions. Because compromise is so prevalent in our society, you could say we no longer have a national conscience; guilt and remorse are non-factors in determining behavior. Politicians, who should be upholding the high ideals of our country, instead are leading the way in compromise. They promote lofty standards and high ideals prior to their election but compromise them once they are in
office. The same holds true in business, from executives down to salespeople; in the courts, from judges to attorneys; in sports, from owners to athletes; and in all walks of life. As a result, people learn to lie, cheat, steal, and shade the truth - to do whatever is necessary to get what they want. Therefore compromise becomes a way of life. Unfortunately, the philosophy and practice of compromise has even invaded the Church. Because tolerance is the operative ideology in our society, the Church adopts a similar perspective to reach the unsaved. Many ministries now look for ways to give the gospel to people without offending them. Yet the very nature of the gospel is offensive because it confronts sinners with their sin. Ignoring that, many ministries willingly compromise God’s Word instead of standing firm on the gospel and they give the world a watered-down version that can’t effect any change (reformation). God draws the elect into the Kingdom through Christians who
prove to be different from the world - who reveal their true allegiance by their commitment and obedience to God’s standards. The Church is now so adept at compromising with the world that it has forgotten how to be uncompromising. That’s because we readily accept the world’s value systems and indulge ourselves in them to the point that we personalize them and they become our desires. In essence, our standards replace God’s. Scripture calls us to the opposite of compromise.

All through the Word of God, He clearly commands His people to live apart from the world. 1 Peter 2:9 says, “But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for God's own possession, that you may proclaim the excellencies of Him who has called you out of darkness into His marvelous light...” Whenever we are tempted to compromise, we need only remind ourselves that God never compromises His absolute truths and principles for expediency. He always lives according to His Word, and as His children, we are also to live by His Word. “I will bow down toward Thy holy temple, And give thanks to Thy name for Thy lovingkindness and Thy truth; for Thou hast magnified Thy word according to all Thy name.” (Psalm 138:2)

GOD’S WORD AS THE ULTIMATE AUTHORITY When you view God’s Word as the ultimate authority, that opens the way for developing integrity instead of compromise. The American Heritage Dictionary defines integrity as “steadfast adherence to a strict moral or ethical code”, “the state of being unimpaired; soundness”, or “the quality or condition of being whole or undivided; completeness”. It comes from the word integer, which means “whole” or “complete” . Integrity essentially means being true to one’s ethical standards, or in our case, God’s standards. Its synonyms are “honesty, sincerity, incorruptibility”. It describes someone without hypocrisy or duplicity - someone who is completely consistent with his or her stated convictions, someone who does what they say. Integrity to our word is where it all starts. Nowhere is integrity more critical than in the leadership of the Church, because the spiritual leader must maintain integrity to set a credible example for all to follow.
Christ said of the religious leaders of His day, “...therefore all that they tell you, do and observe, but do not do according to their deeds; for they say things, and do not do them.” (Matthew 23:3)

After pronouncing several woes on them, Jesus offered this final rebuke:

&quot;You serpents, you brood of vipers, how shall you escape the sentence of hell?” (verse 33)

But to the man of integrity, God promises blessing. When Solomon finished building the house of the Lord, the Lord appeared to him and said: “And the Lord said to him, I have heard your prayer and your supplication, which you have made before Me; I have consecrated this house which you have built by putting My name there forever, and My eyes and My heart will be there perpetually. And as for you, if you will walk before Me as your father David walked, in integrity of heart and uprightness, doing according to all that I have commanded you {and} will keep My statutes and My ordinances, then I will establish the throne of your kingdom over Israel forever, just as I promised to your father David, saying, You shall not lack a man on the throne of Israel.'” (1 Kings 9:3-5) The goal of this letter is that you will be able to answer the following questions as David did: “O Lord, who may abide in Thy tent? Who may dwell on Thy holy hill? He who walks with integrity, and works
righteousness, And speaks truth in his heart.” (Psalm 15:1-2)

TOTAL TRANSFORMATION “This I say therefore, and affirm together with the Lord, that you walk no longer just as the Gentiles also walk, in the futility of their mind, being darkened in their understanding, excluded from the life of God, because of the ignorance that is in them, because of the hardness of their heart; and they, having become callous, have given themselves over to sensuality, for the practice of every kind of impurity with greediness. But you did not learn Christ in this way, if indeed you have heard Him and have been taught in Him, just as truth is in Jesus, that, in reference to your former manner of life, you lay aside the old self, which is being corrupted in accordance with the lusts of deceit, and that you be renewed in the spirit of your mind, and put on the new self, which in the likeness of God has been created in righteousness and holiness of the truth.” (Ephesians 4:17-19). When you were brought into God’s kingdom, you were totally transformed.
You became “a new creature; the old things passed away; behold, new things have come” (2 Corinthians 5:17). You did not just receive something new - you became someone new. Paul said, “I have been crucified with Christ, and it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me, and delivered Himself up for me”. (Galatians 2:20) The new nature is not added to the old nature but replaces it! An exchange occurs. The transformed person is completely new. If we have a changed nature, then we will have a changed behavior. Please notice his statement in Galatians 2:20 where he says, “....The life which I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God...” In other words, he is saying that he is not some super spirit or the like, but he lives this life in the flesh. He’s just an ordinary human being who has learned that all he has to do is die to self and live by faith in the Son of
God. This requires that the “I” must be crucified. Look now at Romans 6:1-7, “What shall we say then? Are we to continue in sin that grace might increase? (2) May it never be! How shall we who died to sin still live in it? (3) Or do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus have been baptized into His death? (4) Therefore we have been buried with Him through baptism into death, in order that as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, so we too might walk in newness of life. (5) For if we have become united with Him in the likeness of His death, certainly we shall be also {in the likeness of His resurrection, (6) knowing this, that our old self was crucified with {Him,} that our body of sin might be done away with, that we should no longer be slaves to sin; (7) for he who has died is freed from sin.” When we study Scriptures such as the ones above, we must come to the following conclusions concerning the subject of
“integrity of character”: 1. If we still live in any sin, we have not died to it! (Sin is not walking in the truth you have been given according to James 4:17.) 2. That baptism is not just a celebration of getting wet, but is a message of death to the old “self”! 3. That we will continue to battle the issues of wrong character if we do not allow ourselves to be buried with Christ! The old nature must be totally buried; totally covered over with earth, six feet under...no hands sticking out of the grave; no toes left wiggling; no chance of any part of the old nature being “dug up”. 4. According to verses 4 and 5, this is the only way to walk in resurrection life. We know that without resurrection life, we cannot experience ascension life! We must be totally united with Him in the likeness of His death in order to experience His life after His death. 5. Verse 7 strongly indicates that only those who have died are freed from sin! The bottom line of the whole message of
“integrity of character” is that in order to reflect the character of Christ in our lives, we must have become one with Him in His death, resurrection and ascension. If we discover that we are not people of our word, then we obviously have not truly died to self. If we do not keep our word, then we certainly are not one with Him. If there is any dishonesty or lying in us, then how can we expect anyone to see the Christ that is “in” us? It is time to come to grips with the fact that we must stop chasing after anointings and giftings and deal with the root of character. It is now time to seek the fruits of the Spirit as we have for so many years pursued the gifts of the Spirit! We must become so clothed with Christ that it becomes second nature to us to live our lives as He would have us do. We must identify with His words when He made statements such as “I only do what I see My Father do” and “I only speak that which I hear My Father speak”. This current apostolic
reformation is not about following a bunch of rules, but is about being IN CHRIST! “...That you may prove yourselves to be blameless and innocent, children of God above reproach in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation, among whom you appear as lights in the world”.

(Philippians 2:15) Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness:

(Mat 5:6 KJV) Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness: for they shall be filled. God hates Robbery His Word Promises Judgement on the wicked: 5 Then I will draw near to you for judgment; I will be a swift witness against the sorcerers, against the adulterers, against the false swearers (LIARS), and against those who oppress the hireling in his wages, the widow and the fatherless, and who turn aside the temporary resident from his right and fear not Me, says the Lord of hosts. 6For I am the Lord, I do not change; that is why you, O sons of Jacob, are not consumed. 7Even from the days of your fathers you have turned aside from My ordinances and have not kept them. Return to me, and I will return to you, says the Lord of hosts. But you say, How shall we return? 8Will a man rob or defraud God? Yet you rob and defraud Me. But you say, In what way do we rob or defraud You? [You have withheld your] tithes and offerings. 9You are cursed with the curse, for
you are robbing Me, even this whole nation. 10Bring all the tithes (the whole tenth of your income) into the storehouse, that there may be food in My house, and prove Me now by it, says the Lord of hosts, if I will not open the windows of heaven for you and pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it. 11And I will rebuke the devourer [insects and plagues] for your sakes and he shall not destroy the fruits of your ground, neither shall your vine drop its fruit before the time in the field, says the Lord of hosts. 12And all nations shall call you happy and blessed, for you shall be a land of delight, says the Lord of hosts. 13Your words have been strong and hard against Me, says the Lord. Yet you say, What have we spoken against You? 14You have said, It is useless to serve God, and what profit is it if we keep His ordinances and walk gloomily and as if in mourning apparel before the Lord of hosts? 15And now we consider the proud and arrogant to
be happy and favored; evildoers are exalted and prosper; yes, and when they test God, they escape [unpunished]. 16Then those who feared the Lord talked often one to another; and the Lord listened and heard it, and a book of remembrance was written before Him of those who reverenced and worshipfully feared the Lord and who thought on His name. 17And they shall be Mine, says the Lord of hosts, in that day when I publicly recognize and openly declare them to be My jewels (My special possession, My peculiar treasure). And I will spare them, as a man spares his own son who serves him. 18Then shall you return and discern between the righteous and the wicked, between him who serves God and him who does not serve Him.
