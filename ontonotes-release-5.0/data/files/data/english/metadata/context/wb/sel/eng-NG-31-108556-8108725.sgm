Hello, all, I'm not sure I'm posting this in the right group but I did
some searching and this seems to be the best forum for this type of
question.

What I want to do, and seem to lack the correct terms to define it as
my Internet searches didn't yield useful results, is to take an audio
feed from one source and use it in a different building about 50 feet
away.

To be more detailed, I have DirecTV with XM Radio in my house and I
want to be able to listen to that in my shop building about 50 feet
from my house.  In my house I have the DirecTV receiver plumbed into a
Sony head unit that has a variety of outputs, including a headphone
jack.  In my shop I have a crappy old something stereo that has, at
least, an RCA-style input for auxilliary sources and, of course, a FM
receiver.

What I've done to listen to this outdoors (when VERY close to the part
of the house with the Sony head unit) is to plumb a Belkin FM
transmitter into the headphone output of the Sony and then put a
regular FM radio outside the house as close as possible to the Belkin
which is indoors.  This is barely tolerable as even small distances
are too great for the signal output of the Belkin.  50 feet to the
shop is impossible.

I can run a physical cable to the shop from the house if that is what
is best.  I could build a stronger FM transmitter than what the Belkin
is, to heck with the FCC (I'm in a rural area), but I'm not an
electronics master; building a FM transmitter would be a first for me
and I'd not know how to interface it with the output from, say, the
headphone jack on the Sony head unit.  If I had a schematic I could
follow it and build it, but I haven't found any such thing so far.

There should be a simple way of just bridging a gap between two stereo
units, one as source, one as receiver, but I cannot think of one other
than running a cable from the headphone jack of the Sony to the
whatever stereo in the shop but I'm pretty sure the attenuation of
over 50 feet of cable would be murder.  I may be using a technical
term out of place, I mean the loss over the wire would be very large.

Thank you for your help and time.

Running a remote speaker 50 feet is no problem, as long as
you use reasonably heavy wire.  Say, 18 AWG.  Running a
headphone signal to a line in jack would have very little
attenuation even with very thin wire, because, unlike a
speaker, the line jack draws almost no current.  It would be
something like a telephone signal, and they send those a lot
further than 50 feet.
