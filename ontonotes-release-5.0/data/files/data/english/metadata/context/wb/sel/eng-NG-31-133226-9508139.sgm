Your Divine Soul Purpose -- Manifesting Your True Life's Mission

Article Description:
====================

When we begin to awaken spiritually, we ask 'why am I here?',
and 'for what purpose did God create me?' For some, an inner
understanding of divine soul purpose emerges relatively early in
the spiritual journey. For others, knowledge of soul purpose
eludes our human embodied self for quite a long time,
necessitating a period of 'walking in the desert' with little
apparent support.   God created you so carefully, and uniquely
for the sacred purpose you embody.

Your Divine Soul Purpose -- Manifesting Your True Life's Mission
Copyright (c) 2007 Mashubi Rochell

The new times that are arriving on the Earth will require a new
kind of human being to navigate through the stormy waters of
present day challenges, and to create new solutions based on the
spiritual principles of harmony, balance, and respect for life.
At this time on the Earth, many souls are awakening spiritually,
and coming to more deeply understand and experience their own
unique and divine spiritual origins.

When a soul, embodied in human form, begins to awaken and realize
their inner connection with spirit, a new path is forged within
the body, mind, emotions and consciousness. The awakening human
being begins to experience a greater depth of communion with
spirit, and many new questions arise. One very important question
the soul asks is, &quot;why am I here?&quot;, and &quot;for what purpose did
God create me?&quot;

For some on the spiritual path, an inner understanding of divine
soul purpose emerges relatively early in the spiritual journey,
guiding and supporting them in the directions needed for optimal
growth and manifestation of their life's work.

For others, knowledge of divine soul purpose eludes the human
embodied self for quite a long time, necessitating a period of
&quot;walking in the desert&quot; with little outward or even inward
support that can be perceived. This period of seeking is
purposeful on the soul's part, but may cause deep suffering to
the embodied human self that feels empty, meaningless, and
worried that they may be going in the wrong direction.

The manifestation of your divine soul purpose is as unique and
precious as you are.  The best way to discover that which is the
guiding essence of your life purpose is to look within at what
desires, dreams, aspirations, hopes and longings you carry most
closely in your heart.

God created you so carefully, and uniquely for the sacred purpose
you embody. Think of the beauty of a newborn baby, the precious
nature of their tiny fingers and toes, and the sweet wisdom in
their eyes. We can see the divine blueprint of the soul clearly
in the radiance of their simple and innocent being. In this same
way, you are created uniquely for your spiritual purpose, with
every finger and toe, every hair on your head known and accounted
for by God's infinite wisdom and grace.

Small children naturally begin to embody their soul purpose, even
at a very young age. They are attracted to certain people and
situations, and they relate to their environment in their own
unique fashion. They may love animals, or spend their time
drawing and painting, or they will play with cars and trucks,
heal the neighborhood cats, or lead groups of children on the
playground. They may enjoy singing and dancing, or they may read
voraciously, or tinker with their computer. All the natural
tendencies within, if allowed to flourish and expand, will lead a
child to manifesting their divine soul purpose.

And what of we adults, who may have grown up in less than optimal
circumstances where our natural tendencies were not supported?
Perhaps we have forgotten what we most loved to do as a child, or
perhaps even thinking about this brings up the pain of what we
endured as children. How can we discover our divine soul
purpose?

It may comfort you to know that you have not lost anything, even
if you no longer feel in touch with your inner desires. The deep
inner longing of your heart is never extinguished, even in the
most difficult of circumstances. This is a quality of the soul
that is eternal, that will lead you to manifesting your soul's
purpose.

If you are feeling uninspired, disconnected from your divine soul
purpose, it is possible to re-connect, by praying for this and
creating a sacred intention to re-connect with your inner being.
The prayer and intention activates a path of healing that will
lead you towards that which you desire. If you have been
disconnected for a very long time, you may find yourself
experiencing deep emotions of grief or pain, as the re-connection
to yourself is restored. If you can breathe and be with these
emotions, without repressing them, but simply holding them in
god's light, this will create a healing and a freeing up on
inner space.

The discovery of your divine soul purpose lies within your
heart's desire. What do you most deeply long for? If you could
do anything in the world what would that be? The path to
manifesting your unique gifts in the world begins here, and then
expands outward, as you begin to take actions based on your
heart's calling. Your true life's work is this, to listen,
follow, share your gifts, and manifest all that you are in the
world of physical form. For this reason you came to the Earth at
this time, to share all that you are with all of life.
