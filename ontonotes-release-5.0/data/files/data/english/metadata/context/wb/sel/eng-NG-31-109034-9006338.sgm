&quot;If every cartoonist would agree to take their work offline
forever, we would all make fifteen times as much money. Weve done a
really stupid thing [by putting content online].&quot;

Rall is refering specifically to editorial cartoons here.

POD: 1996

Someone in the Association of American Editorial Cartoonists,
concerned about the effect the web might have on professional editorial
cartoonists, manages to push through a resolution condemning online
publication. Somewhat less probably, the members of the AAEC do not
imitate a herd of cats but get onboard with the resolution. Very few
of the AAEC members allow their work to be put up online.

Results?

My expectation is that online cartoons are a niche that will
be filled and if the AAEC members don't, someone else will.

Why stop there?  If every cartoonist other than Rall agrees to not
even publish in print, but instead carve their images on stone
tablets, Rall could become a millionaire by cornering the market!

As it is, Rall will have to deal with competition, the fact it drives
down price structure, and the fact it can force suppliers to change
practices.

I'm going to be cheap here, and give a massive quote from the rest of
the cite:

-- Begin Exerpt --

Now let's be clear about two things: one, Rall was not speaking in
direct reply to Griffith's point. And two, he'd just been talking
about the history of specifically editorial cartoonists (of which he
is one), and the rapid decline in their numbers (specifically cited:
in 1960, there were more editorial cartoonists in New York City alone
than there are now in the whole of the United States).

Still, this struck me as a monumentally absurd statement - from our
researches here at the Fleenplex, it appears that only new cartoonists
in this country that are able to make a living from their cartooning
are the ones that do the exact opposite of what Rall proposes. Seeking
reaction from webcomickers in attendence elicited a uniform
disagreement with Rall, but I'd like to open the question more
broadly. If you're a webcomics creator that makes a significant
portion of your living from your creation, can you see a set of
circumstances where Rall's assertion makes sense, or is it just crazy
talk?

Memorable Quotes:

Tayler, in reaction to the Rall quote - We're about to do a really
stupid thing if we pay attention to Ted Rall.
Willis, ditto - I can't hear him through my big wad of cash.

The online editorial cartoonists get a source for a cartoon or two at
AAEC's expense, and online comics continue, with non AAEC artists
getting more exposure.

I agree with you.  More notably, the Web editorial cartoons may become
edgier than their newsprint-bound counterparts, mainly because the
artists are not actually bound to a specific group telling them what
to do.

Around here, newspaper sales are declining noticeably.  I believe one
of the reasons is that they are competing against cheaper sources such
as online news.

Unless you engage in very heavy handed censorship, it is impossible.

This is a common economic fallicy that cartels actually work when you
have a large number of seperate actors in the cartel, and all it takes
is a few to break the cartel.

The few who think they can gain an advantage by breaking the cartel
will do so and the jig is up.

Interesting artical about economic fallicies and how they are commonly
held by voters in  the USA (and many other places).  You might hold
several of them, but you cannot get an economics paper published in a
respectable economics journal with any of them in the paper any more
than you can publish a physics paper with a flat earth basis.

One counter example: http://www.girlgeniusonline.com/comic.php Scroll down
to the bottom of the page where you'll see Foglio's say &quot;Doom Level:
Astonishingly, pretty low at the moment! We're working on paying off the
last of our ten years of hideous crushing debt and sales of Girl Genius just
keep going up. We should have gone online years ago. Thank you, everyone who
has supported us and stayed with us through all of the changes and
weirdness; and thank you, all you new readers who have given us such a
boost!&quot;
