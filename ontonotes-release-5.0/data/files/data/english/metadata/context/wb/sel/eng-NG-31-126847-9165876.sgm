In fundamentalist circles, the Christian doctrine of love and devotion
blends sheer hypocrisy with a primitive agenda of enforced ignorance
and intolerant control.
By William Marvel

It has been my observation that the sincerity of a person's religious
devotion can best be gauged by how vocal that person is about it: the
greater the volume, the less genuine the spirituality is likely to be.
Whenever people introduce themselves as Christians, ask what church I
attend, or voluntarily announce a personal devotion to their lord and
savior, I usually work a couple of fingers into the pocket where I
keep my wallet, just to make sure it's still there.

Plenty of people manage to follow a particular faith with varying
degrees of credence in the literal truth of its sectarian doctrine,
and even to incorporate their beliefs into their daily lives, without
hammering their neighbors over the head with the need to follow suit.
That fails to satisfy many of the faithful, however, and they must
raise the subject at every conversation, stubbornly insisting that
their obsession become yours. This seems especially true among those
who make a direct or indirect living off such discourse, as though
they feel the need to practice their skills on every innocent victim
who falls within earshot.

On a recent trip to Kansas it was my misfortune to attend a
convocation of in-laws that included a host of real and would-be
preachers. I can hardly say which disgusted me more, for both the
ordained ministers and self-anointed truck-stop preachers engaged in
an Olympic contention to determine who could praise and worship Jesus
the loudest and longest. They managed to turn a friendly family
gathering into a fundamentalist camp meeting, hijacking a folk-music
jam and transforming it into a gospel-fest, drowning out and driving
off any who found it obnoxious. Obviously they enjoyed the spotlight
in which they cast themselves, and that affection for attention may,
after all, explain their attraction to the raised pedestal on which
they place themselves.

How strange, though, that those of the most pious rhetoric seem to be
the greatest parasites of their circles, happy to let their wives,
daughters, or parishioners support them and their families while they
contend for the choice seats in heaven. How odd that those advocates
of self-help and personal responsibility demand such hand-and-foot
service from the distaff sides of their families. Perhaps women do,
indeed, have no purpose except to serve man. Man, meanwhile, has no
purpose save to serve God and obey the president-so long as he may be
Republican and vociferously Christian.

It was perversely amusing to note how consistently those professional
proponents of self-restraint and sacrifice (and their families) all
seemed conspicuously oblivious to the admonitions against gluttony,
sloth, and avarice. Obesity seemed the norm, rather than the
exception: one minister's wife looked exactly like a blue-ribbon
turnip from the state fair, while another sprawled like a sperm whale,
watching her blubbery little girl lurch from table to table to siphon
off hot dogs and hamburgers. Arguments against earthly materialism
also found precious little sympathy, especially among the ministers'
own families. Their children all expressed impatience for the next
planned purchase, from a tract house to some useless piece of Wal-Mart
trash-to-be.

The bile would not rise so sharply in my craw if such comfort-loving,
Bible-spewing cultists did not intend to impose their beliefs on me,
but that is the plan. Christians across the country plot their places
in the political hierarchy, from which they can inflict their
hidebound superstitions on society at large. Colleges, like Patrick
Henry in Purcellville, Virginia, specifically prepare Christian
undergraduates for careers in governmental evangelism. Students learn
all they need (avoiding evolution and other heretical &quot;theories&quot;) to
turn their fantasy of a Christian nation into an enforced fact-just as
their parents and teachers would impose their primitive ideologies on
a family reunion.

Such scenes of indoctrination and deliberate isolation help me to
understand why the otherwise sensible people of Kansas so quietly
accept their role as national laughing stock for the Jumping Jesus
school of biology espoused by their state school board. The advocates
of the New Christian Nation seem perfectly innocuous and inoffensive
until they achieve a seeming majority within any medium, including a
backyard picnic. Only when they take actual charge does it become
obvious that their professed doctrine of love and devotion disguises
an agenda of studied ignorance and intolerant control.

My Thoughts:

Liberals Are Stuck On 1%

The United States is two nations when it comes to charity. Â One
charitable and one selfish.

2 times - A religious person is twice as likely to give money to
charities as a non-religious person.

100 times - Religious people will give 100 times as much money to
charities as non-religious people.

50 times - Religious people will give 50 times as much money to non-
religious charities as non religious people.

The world view and life style of charitable people is usually more in
sync with the right than with the left.

From: &quot;Who Really Cares: America's Charity Divide - Who Gives, Who
Doesn't and Why It Matters&quot; by Arthur C. Brooks.

AND

1%

3,700 - Troops killed in Iraq.

67,000 - People MURDERED in the United States since we have had troops
in Iraq.

225,0000 People killed in automobile accidents in the United States
since we have had troops in Iraq

25.8% Killed were Murdered in the United States.
73.0% Killed by automobile accidents in the United States.
01.2% Killed in Iraq.

If Progressives/Liberals are concerned about loss of American lives,
why don't they show any concern for what causes 99% of the killings in
the United States???
