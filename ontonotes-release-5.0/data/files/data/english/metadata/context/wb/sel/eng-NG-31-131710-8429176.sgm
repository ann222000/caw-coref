&quot;He's Diamond Dave, the king of the rock &amp; roll anthem, a man who keeps time
by counting summers. He radiates joy, has no internal editor and shits
platinum quotes.&quot;

Gee, yet another article about spandex and toupees, eh, Rusty?

A Diamond Is Forever
By RANDALL ROBERTS
Tuesday, August 14, 2007 - 6:00 pm

The booze is flowing early on this Monday morning at the Four Seasons in
Beverly Hills. Just because Eddie's stopped drinking doesn't mean we have to
abstain too. This is a Van Halen press conference, after all - rock &amp; roll.
By 10:45 a.m., half the crowd is sipping bloody marys and mimosas - bottles
of Jack would have been more appropriate - and nibbling on swank little
morsels. Instead of bowls of M&amp;M's (minus the brown ones), there are yogurt
parfaits with berries and homemade granola; spinach, mushroom and cheese
frittatas; dinky doughnuts with homemade preserves. As Moby's &quot;Run On&quot; bumps
out of the PA (wait a minute - Moby at a Van Halen media event? WTF?), the
whole thing starts to seem more like the launch of a new clothing line
instead of one of the most anticipated rock moments of the year.

&quot;I wonder whether those four heads can fit on the same stage,&quot; a craggy old
metalhead says.

But then the glorious keyboard riff from &quot;Jump&quot; interrupts the speculation,
and David Lee Roth and three Van Halens (Alex, Eddie and bass
player/Eddie-offspring Wolfgang) weave through the scrum of reporters to
announce their long-overdue reunion tour. (They'll play Staples Center on
November 20.)

A generation of Trans Ammers have been waiting for this moment since the day
after Roth left Van Halen in the spring of 1985. Since then, it's been a
fucking nightmare. First there was the whole Van Hagar debacle (made even
more difficult by the group's poke-my-eardrums-out success), then the tease
of '96, when Roth briefly rejoined the band but was booted by the brothers
before stepping foot onstage. Gary Cherone? That never happened.

And this year has been hell. In February, Eddie Van Halen confirmed that the
band's true front man was returning for a reunion tour - only to renege a
few months later and check himself into rehab after photos surfaced of him
looking like the Wicked Witch of the West.

But here they are, Dave and Eddie, hugging onstage as a nation of stoners
rejoice. Eddie even pecks Dave on the cheek.

&quot;This is the press conference you never thought you'd see happen, especially
while we were young, skinny and good-looking,&quot; says an effervescent Roth,
wearing a black blazer with golden rococo curlicues that recall the glowing
locks he used to rock.

The plan, according to Dave: &quot;Twenty-five of your greatest hits - all the
favorites that you've been hearing tearing out of the back of a pickup truck
at the Burger King drive-thru for how many summertimes?&quot; That would be at
least 30, Dave, maybe more for the old-schoolers who remember the band's
days rocking the Continental Club in Hollywood.

And even if Dave's hot for teacher all these years later - she's got to be
nearing retirement by now - he's still got it made. He's Diamond Dave, the
king of the rock &amp; roll anthem, a man who keeps time by counting summers. He
radiates joy, has no internal editor and shits platinum quotes. In 15 short
minutes, he manages to diss U2 and their hair (&quot;You don't want to see the
same old band, the U2 guys with the mullets. You want something that
delights, that entertains and astonishes&quot;), the Police for their lack of
commitment (&quot;a band like this . . . could get away with a lot if you do one
tour. That's not our ambition. This is not like the Police&quot;), and Elvis
Costello's Imposters and Michael Jackson in the same breath: &quot;If there was a
God, Elvis would be alive and the Imposters would be dead, and if Elvis was
alive, so would Michael Jackson be dead.&quot; The latter comment elicits an
audible rumble, but Dave won't have any of it. &quot;What, are you booing me for
a Michael Jackson joke? This is a Van Halen audience.&quot;

Indeed it is, and the three Van Halens proper onstage look fantastic. Alex
looks like a jet-setting financier; young Wolfgang is quiet and a little
nervous, but his sunglasses hide most of it. And Eddie looks not only
rehabbed but reconstructed: square jawbone, sparkling smile (new teeth?),
twinkle in those eyes - quite literally, a new man.

&quot;It's all very well intact,&quot; confirms Dave, &quot;the same shitty attitude but
with a whole new look.&quot; And what of original bassist Michael Anthony, he who
swung from ropes while swigging bottles of Jack and keeping a steady tugboat
bass? Not invited on this journey. But Roth is the perfect diplomat: &quot;This
is the band's history. There's a lot of great alumni who have been through
this band. I'm shocked that any of us are still vertical after 30 years . .
. Usually when a band comes back like us, it's rockers with walkers, and
this is everything but. Meet us in the future, not the pasture.&quot;

It's been a long time coming, that's for damn sure. But Van Halen taught us
about patience a long time ago. Remember? &quot;You've got to roll with the
punches to get to what's real.&quot;
