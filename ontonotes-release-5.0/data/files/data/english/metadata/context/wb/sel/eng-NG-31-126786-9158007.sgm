1.1 Mineworkers union recommends members accept latest gold wage offer

Matthew Hill, Mining Weekly, 23 August 2007

A strike in South Africa's gold industry seems likely to be avoided after the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM), the country's biggest labour union, said that it would recommend a wage increase offer that gold majors Harmony Gold, Gold Fields and AngloGold Ashanti tabled on Wednesday.

NUM general-secretary Frans Baleni said in a telephone interview on Thursday that the union's negotiators were happy with the deal and would recommend that workers accepted it.

The offer from the mining companies, represented by the Johannesburg-based Chamber of Mines (CoM), ranged from 8,5% for the biggest group of workers, including surface workers, to 15% for machine drill operators, Baleni stated

The NUM had previously repeatedly stressed that it would accept nothing less than a 10% increase from the gold producers.

However, Baleni said that the union had accepted that the gold firms were not doing as well as their counterparts in platinum and coal.

South Africa's gold producers have been suffering from declining reserves and soaring costs, as well as safety issues.

&quot;They made some great moves in other areas,&quot; NUM spokesperson Lesiba Seshoka said over the phone. The union had not set a target date to reach a decision on its acceptance of the offer.

Smaller union Solidarity, which mainly represents artisans, welcomed the offer, calling it a major success.
&quot;We hope that we will be able to get positive feedback from the unions as soon as possible, so that the serious work of addressing the challenges of the industry can now begin,&quot; said CoM chief negotiator Elize Strydom.

1.2 Final offer in gold talks

Business Report, 22 August 2007

Gold industry employers laid their final wage offer on the table in talks with unions on Wednesday.

Various scarce skilled workers would be offered a ten percent increase for 2007 and a eight percent increase for 2008, the Solidarity trade union and the Chamber of Mines' gold sector confirmed on Wednesday.

The gold sector represents AngloGold Ashanti, Harmony and Gold Fields.

A package for rock drill operators was still to be determined but there seemed some likelihood it would be a double digit increase, the chamber and Solidarity confirmed.

Miners and officials were to get an eight percent increase for both years.

In a statement, Solidarity said it welcomed the double-digit offer for artisans.

&quot;The offer will be submitted to the members for an acceptance mandate and Solidarity will urge its members to accept,&quot; said Solidarity spokesperson Reint Dykema.

He said some points still needed to be cleared by negotiators before a collective agreement could be concluded.

&quot;The remuneration of miners and officials will be tackled next,&quot; said Dykema.

Chamber of Mines spokesperson Jabu Maphalala said artisans and rock drill operators had been involved in a separate but parallel negotiation process.

He said their conditions of work and the need to retain their scarce skills had necessitated this.

While the chamber recognised the need to attract workers with scarce skills, it also wanted to emphasise that the industry appreciated all of its workers.

&quot;All mine workers have special contributions to make&quot;, Maphalala said.

While a lot of progress had been made during the negotiations, the chamber would be happy when it could say &quot;yes, we have agreed&quot;.

Wage negotiations in the gold sector have been going on for nearly three months.

Many of the unions' original 61 initial demands had been modified, condensed into each other, or removed, said Maphalala.

Unions began with a 15 percent wage demand while the Chamber's first offer was of a six percent increase.

Maphalala said he could not say exactly when he thought talks might conclude.

However if talks got to a final stage on Wednesday night, it would then be up to the unions to take the offers back to their members and decide from there, he said.

1.3 Cape Town moves to prevent municipal strike

SABC, 22 August 2007

The City of Cape Town is expected to lodge an urgent interdict in the Labour Court next Monday, asking for it to clarify on which counts the SA Municipal Workers' Union (Samwu) may strike.

This comes as municipal workers in Cape Town are expected to embark on an indefinite strike next Tuesday after accusing the city of negotiating in bad faith. The spokesperson for the city, Pieter Cronje, says they will also ask the court to confirm that municipal workers in essential services may not strike.

Cronje says they have not implemented any decision unilaterally, which Samwu is accusing them of.

1.4 City seeks strike interdict

IOL, 22 August 2007

The City of Cape Town is to ask the Labour Court to block next week's planned strike by the SA Municipal Workers Union (Samwu).

The court would be asked to clarify which matters &quot;if any&quot; Samwu could strike on, the city's communications division said in a statement on Wednesday.

It would also ask the court to confirm that municipal workers in essential services could not strike.

The hearing would take place on Monday, only hours ahead of the scheduled Monday midnight start of the strike.

The statement said Samwu had demanded that the city submit its service delivery strategy and model to a bargaining process.

It had also demanded that the city not relocate any employees within the metropolitan area without their agreement.

&quot;Agreeing to these demands would have given a trade union the right to decide what services are delivered and where. This would undermine service delivery,&quot; the city said.

&quot;The city views the... disputes declared by Samwu as disputes of right that do not justify strike action.

&quot;For this reason the city is asking the Labour Court to interdict the strike and clarify which issues Samwu may strike on, if any, and to refer any remaining issues to arbitration.&quot;

Announcing the indefinite strike by its just under 10 000 Cape Town members, Samwu said earlier this week it was a protest against the city's &quot;unilateral&quot; implementation of new conditions of service and pay structures.

It claimed the city had relocated staff without any agreement with the union, and refused to abide by national bargaining council agreements. - Sapa

1.5 Fear made me cancel strike, says McBride

Botho Molosankwe, The Star, 23 August

'Samwu members wanted to cause blockage, injure people'

It was a fear that protesting South African Municipal Workers' Union members would disrupt and injure people that prompted metro police chief Robert McBride to cancel their planned march.

That was the reason the Ekurhuleni metro police chief gave the Germiston Magistrate's Court when he appeared as a state witness in the trial of Paulus Zulu and Attie Kous yesterday.

McBride said such disruptions had occurred previously when members of Samwu went on a march and he believed the decision to declare the impending protest illegal was made in &quot;good faith&quot;.

Both Zulu and Kous are employees of the Ekurhuleni Metro Police Department (EMPD) and were arrested last year and charged with contravening the Regulation of Gatherings Act in relation to a November 20 march organised by Samwu.

It emerged in court that one of the directors in the EMPD, Trish Armstrong, who after receiving information from the National Intelligence Agency that the march wouldn't be peaceful, made an affidavit stating why the protest should be declared illegal.

&quot;Samwu members had expressed their decision to cause traffic blockage, disruption and injure some people,&quot; McBride said.

However, Gys Rautenbach, the defence lawyer for Zulu and Kous said the affidavit was a fabrication and that it was a desperate move by McBride to justify his actions.

But McBride shot back, saying he found the implication &quot;preposterous and insulting&quot; and that the information Armstrong received from the NIA was one of the reasons the march had to be cancelled.

In a statement read by his lawyer, Kous also accuses McBride of being aggressive on the said day and that he also hit people leaning out of bus windows with a pump-action shotgun.

The protesters were riding in buses on their way to meet with other Samwu members when they were stopped and told to wait for McBride.

Kous said he had asked McBride what the problem was but the answer he got was: &quot;Why don't you tell your union to get out of here?&quot; and then gave them five minutes to disperse.

After being arrested, Kous claims that he had heard McBride talking to Armstrong, and in that conversation the director was being told to &quot;get documents ready for Attie's disciplinary hearing&quot;.

But McBride dismissed the claim as a figment of Kous's imagination. He said Germiston was not the departure point for the protesters. The fact that they had departed there, he said, was an indication that they arrived there to disrupt.

The case has been postponed to October 4.

1.6 Nurses 'struggle for registration'

IOL, 22 August 2007

The SA Nursing Council was taking too long to register nurses after they completed their training, the Democratic Nurses Organisation (Denosa) claimed on Wednesday.

Denosa spokesperson Asanda Fongqo said a member in Limpopo finished training in July 2006 and was still not registered.

The council said files had gone missing and promised to come back to her. Other members had reported similar experiences.

This affected their ability to earn salaries as they could not work without being registered, and it impacted on efforts to solve the staff shortages in the health sector, Denosa said.

&quot;We demand the registration department of the South African Nursing Council to co-operate with nurses and find a solution to this matter.&quot;

The council was not immediately available for comment. - Sapa

1.7 SABC, unions reach wage agreement

IOL, 22 August 2007

The national broadcaster and unions have reached an agreement on wage negotiations for the 2007/8 fiscal year, SABC spokesperson Kaizer Kganyago said on Wednesday.

Unions involved were the Communication Workers Union, the Broadcasting, Electronic Media and Allied Workers Union, and the Media Workers Association of Southern Africa.

&quot;We acknowledge that the negotiations have not been easy given the industrial service strikes around the issue of wages,&quot; said SABC group chief executive Dali Mpofu.

&quot;All parties have decided that the substantive matters will be resolved within the current fiscal year during engagements within the bargaining forum.&quot; - Sapa

1.8 Union declares dispute with Telkom

IOL, 22 August 2007

Solidarity has declared a dispute with Telkom about the company's interpretation of a 2006 wage agreement, the trade union announced on Wednesday.

&quot;Telkom's interpretation of the wage agreement concluded with Solidarity in 2006 deprives workers of part of their remuneration,&quot; Solidarity said in a statement.

&quot;The company's interpretation of the agreement affects the amount by which the employees' total package was to have been increased from April 1st this year&quot;.

Solidarity said it had given Telkom until August 28 to rectify the matter before it would consider further action.

It had also instructed its legal team and economist Ulrich Joubert to investigate the matter.

The dispute was declared on Monday. - Sapa

1.9 Anger mounts at Rhodes over 'offensive' pay issue

Mike Loewe, Grahamstown Correspondent, The Herald, 22 August 2007

EMOTIONS were high at a meeting of about 80 Rhodes academics and clerical staff at the weekend as the pay discrepancy saga gathers momentum.

University sources said senior academics were &quot;angry&quot; about the packages of around R900 000 a year for the top five executives at the university, plus a R1,6-million golden handshake - or &quot;retirement annuity&quot; - for former vice-chancellor Dr David Woods, which came to light when the university published its 2006 annual financial statements.

One academic at the meeting said they were disillusioned due to the pay issue.

In a statement used as a basis for the meeting, eight historians - including history department head Professor Paul Maylam and Makana councillor Dr Julia Wells - said the &quot;offensive&quot; discrepancies were aimed at rewarding only a select few in management, while the broad academic body was disregarded.

Meanwhile, it seemed yesterday as if the Rhodes branch of the academic union - the National Tertiary Education Sector Union (Ntesu) - which draws members from clerical staff up to professors, had much weaker bargaining power than Nehawu, which represents Rhodes workers, including gardeners, kitchen staff and guards.

An Ntesu source said the academics did not have a membership of &quot;50 per cent plus one&quot;, which is required before the university will enter into a bargaining structure, while Nehawu had met the target.

However, about 20 more academics had signed up last week and more were coming forward, the source said. So, while Nehawu last week took its demand for a 10% pay rise and other demands from negotiations to declaring a dispute, which will be placed before the CCMA and could be followed by a legal strike, the academics have found themselves having to hold &quot;discussions&quot; with new vice-chancellor Dr Saleem Badat, and not much more.

Sources said Badat was keen to resolve the pay issue.

Ntesu chairman Dr Mike Drewett said the feeling among academics after publication of the executives' salaries was one of &quot;betrayal&quot;.

1.10 Khutsong teacher sacked

Sowetan, 23 August 2007

Blamed for inciting Khutsong boycott of schools

A Khutsong teacher involved in the area's anti-demarcation activities has been dismissed from his post, the North West provincial education department confirmed yesterday.

Jomo Mogale was dismissed for his &quot;activities and participation in the destabilisation of schooling in Khutsong&quot;, department spokesman Charles Raseala said.

Schooling has been disrupted over the past few months in Khutsong.

This came as residents in the area staged violent protests against being incorporated into North West from Gauteng.

Mogale, who is the spokesman for the Anti-North West Forum, was dismissed on Monday after a departmental disciplinary hearing.

He was suspended from his post in April.

Raseala said Mogale &quot;knowingly and purposively&quot; incited pupils to boycott classes, and had threatened with violence those who did not want to participate.

Raseala said Mogale was unable to account for his absence from school on days that community protests took place.

Mogale's lawyer, Phillip Masilo, said the charges against his client for his involvement in demarcation protests and his position as a teacher had &quot;nothing to do with each other&quot;.

&quot;People have a right to their opinion,&quot; he said.

Masilo said he did not believe the department had provided enough evidence to prove the allegations about Mogale.

He said Mogale's dismissal was part of a larger victimisation of civil servants who spoke out about problems in South Africa.

Masilo compared Mogale's situation to that of Frere Hospital medical superintendent, Nokuzola
Ntshona, who was apparently suspended for speaking out about bad conditions at the hospital. - Sapa

1.11 Kimberley Clark finally signs agreement resolving dispute

UNI, 22 August 2007

Kimberley Clark finally agreed to the terms of the Employers Association and this brought to an end all the strikes that started on 30 July 2007 following a deadlock at the Chemical and Wood and Paper Bargaining Councils...

UNI Global Union is pleased to advise that on 22 August, the outstanding deadlock between the CEPPWAWU and Kimberley Clark was settled following an agreement at the Tissue and Allied Chamber of the Wood and Paper Bargaining Council.

Kimberley Clark finally agreed to the terms of the Employers Association and this brought to an end all the strikes that started on 30 July 2007 following a deadlock at the Chemical and Wood and Paper Bargaining Councils.

Our affiliate, the CEPPWAWU and its members appreciate all the solidarity given by all the workers around the world during their strike action. The union wishes to send their thanks and gratitude for all the support.

It has been shown that Global worker solidarity is not just a dream but indeed a reality.

1.12 Union leaders unhappy with Telkom

IOL, 23 August 2007

Solidarity has declared a dispute with Telkom about the company's interpretation of a 2006 wage agreement, the trade union said on Wednesday.

2 South Africa

2.1 Samwu rejects metro cops merger

IOL, 22 August 2007

There was no purpose in merging metro police with the SA Police Service, the SA Municipal Workers Union (Samwu) said on Wednesday.

The union said in a statement that it had not been consulted about proposed changes to the SAPS Act that would bring the metro forces in Ekurhuleni, Tshwane and Johannesburg under the control of National Police Commissioner Jackie Selebi.

Nor had the move been brought before the local government bargaining council.

&quot;Samwu does not see any purpose to merging the two forces, given our understanding that the mandate of metro police... is to prevent crime and enforce by-laws,&quot; it said.

It said it was assured by Selebi at a meeting in March that a merger was not on the cards.- Sapa

2.2 New probe into farm attacks

Anesca Smith, Die Burger, 23 August 2007

A new investigation into farm attacks will be launched shortly by the South African Human Rights Commission.

That's according to the Minister of Safety and Security, Charles Nqakula, in parliament on Wednesday.

Nqakula was replying to a question by safety and security portfolio committee chairperson, Maggie Sotyu.

An inquiry was conducted earlier this year at the insistence of the Freedom Front Plus party (FF+), after a remark by the Minister of Agriculture and Land Affairs Lulu Xingwana on the abuse of farm workers.

Nqakula said the results of the earlier inquiry had unfortunately not been published.

&quot;We're aware of the fact that a large number of undocumented workers are employed on South African farms, and that the relationship between employer and employee is not always good. For this reason another study will be conducted of the issues mentioned.&quot;

2.3 Limpopo farmers can arrest illegals

Citizen, 23 August 2007

PARLIAMENT - Safety and Security Minister Charles Nqakula on Wednesday confirmed that farmers in Limpopo Province are allowed to arrest illegal immigrants.

Responding to a question in the National Assembly, by Pieter Groenewald of the Freedom Front Plus, he acknowledged there was an increase in illegal immigrants in Limpopo.

However, he emphasised that farmers could not use illegal measures, such as assault, to arrest illegal immigrants.

In a statement later on Wednesday, Groenewald said Nqakula's answer repudiated his provincial commissioner Calvin Sengani, and was welcomed.

The minister's answer, that Sengani was initially unaware of the increase in illegal immigrants in Limpopo, raised concerns.

It confirmed that Sengani did not know what was going on in Limpopo.

&quot;It is now becoming a comfortable excuse of ministers to say that their officials were misunderstood or misquoted after they had made a mistake,&quot; he said.

Sengani earlier denied there was an increase in illegal immigrants in Limpopo. He also threatened to
arrest farmers arresting illegal immigrants on their farms.

Sengani had stated farmers could only take action when illegal immigrants committed a crime.

Sengani should be dismissed for his incompetence, Groenewald said. -Sapa

2.4 Cosatu urges Chinese goods boycott

IOL, 22 August 2007

The Western Cape region of the Congress of SA Trade Unions (Cosatu) called on Wednesday for a boycott of Chinese products.

&quot;These products are dangerous and pose a health risk to communities,&quot; the region said in a statement.

Its call followed scares over a range of Chinese goods, including toxic toothpaste and toys.

It also urged workers to insist that their companies did not buy Chinese machinery or motor cars unless they were fully compliant with the South African Bureau of Standards.

This &quot;low cost sub-standard machinery&quot; could pose a risk to workers, the statement read. - Sapa

2.5 Online gambling bill slated in Parliament

Linda Ensor, Business Day, 23 August 2007

Political Correspondent

Proposed legislation on online gambling has been met with a groundswell of opposition, with calls for the bill to be sent back to the drawing board because the government has not thought it through fully.

Outright opposition to the National Gambling Amendment Bill, or concern about its flawed nature, were the overwhelming responses by those making submissions during a parliamentary public hearing yesterday.

The bill is intended to decriminalise and regulate interactive, or online, gambling.

Casino Association of SA (Casa) chairman Jabu Mabuza told the trade and industry committee there had been insufficient consultation on the &quot;woefully insufficiently researched&quot; bill, which was being pushed hastily through Parliament.

Concern was expressed about the proposal to limit the number of interactive gaming operators. This could exclude operators from other countries and so contravene international treaties, the committee was told.

Submissions to the committee were also made by the Financial Intelligence Centre (FIC), which was concerned that interactive gambling could facilitate money laundering. Casa argued that the bill needed more work as it did not provide for the taxation of online gambling.

The Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) criticised the negative consequences gambling had on the poor.

The FIC proposed improvements to the bill it believed would close loopholes left open for money laundering. The bill, it said, should include licensing and probity checks of operators.

The regulator should also be empowered to block unlicensed interactive casinos from carrying on business in SA and block the flow of funds to them.

The FIC also warned that the cost of regulation of the interactive gaming industry was likely to be &quot;substantial&quot; because of its cross-border nature.

Dealing with jurisdiction, the FIC recommended that licensed operators should be required to subject themselves to domestic laws.

Mabuza highlighted a lack of tax proposals. &quot;Whatever happens in the industry turns on the level of taxation, which has to be fair and equitable,&quot; Mabuza said.

&quot;There has to be a level playing field.&quot;

To ensure consistency and fairness, interactive operators ought to pay a rate of tax no less than that paid by other sectors of the gambling industry.

Another concern was that interactive gambling operators should be subject to the same stringent requirements as other operators, for example, on black economic empowerment, probity and prohibitions on underage gambling.

The association said unless online gambling was dealt with on the same terms as other forms of gambling it should be dealt with under another law instead of its provisions being incorporated into the National Gambling Act.

Cosatu called for the bill to be rejected as it was opposed to the expansion of legalised gambling.

2.6 Health Dept: Nothing new in study on Aids, nutrition

Mail &amp; Guardian, 23 August 2007

A fresh study into the link between nutrition and HIV/Aids does not provide any new information, the Health Department said on Wednesday.

&quot;The findings of the study actually reaffirm the policy position of the department,&quot; the department said in a statement. &quot;The outcomes ... do not necessarily provide any new information that was unknown to the Department of Health.&quot;

The research, conducted by the Academy of Sciences of South Africa, found there was no scientific evidence specific to South African conditions backing the use of nutrition as the primary treatment for HIV/Aids and tuberculosis (TB).

The department said the study confirmed that in addition to TB and HIV, South Africa is also facing a challenge of macronutrient deficiencies (overt hunger) and/or micronutrient deficiencies (hidden hunger).

&quot;To deal with the latter, the Department of Health promotes good nutrition through consumption of balanced diet,&quot; the department said. &quot;People living with HIV, in particular, are encouraged to adopt healthy lifestyles including good nutrition.&quot;

The research panel said it believes nutrition is not a substitute for antiretroviral agents in the treatment of HIV/Aids. &quot;Does that mean nutritional treatment has no role? Of course not. But we must understand the difference between primary and supportive treatment,&quot; panellist Barry Mendelow told reporters.

Health Minister Manto Tshabalala-Msimang has been criticised in the past for publicly focusing on the benefits of beetroot, garlic and lemons in the management of the disease, and underplaying the role of antiretrovirals.

The Democratic Alliance (DA) on Wednesday officially wrote to President Thabo Mbeki asking him to fire Tshabalala-Msimang. In his letter to the president, DA spokesperson on health Mike Waters cited Tshabalala-Msimang's obsession with good nutrition as a substitute for proper HIV/Aids treatment as one of the reasons she should be fired.

&quot;A [recent] study on the question of nutrition versus medication in combating diseases such as Aids, which concluded that healthy eating was no substitute for correctly used medication, is yet another piece of evidence to contradict the minister's highly public and extremely damaging opinion that good nutrition is of equivalent value to antiretrovirals in treating Aids,&quot; he said.

This, compounded by the minister's inability to ensure that provincial health departments' expenditure was monitored, rendered her unfit to continue serving in her current portfolio, he said. -- Sapa

3 SACP donation

3.1 I gave money to Blade - Madisha

Boyd Webb, The Star, 23 August 2007

Cosatu president Willie Madisha says he is willing to testify in court that he handed over a R500 000 cash donation that has apparently gone missing to SA Communist Party general secretary Blade Nzimande.

This flies in the face of what Nzimande has publicly said - that he never received this money.

Madisha briefed journalists in Johannesburg on Wednesday shortly after he appeared before an SACP team tasked to probe the question of the missing cash - an issue that has highlighted the tensions in the SACP.

Madisha explained that he had decided to address the media on his own because his integrity had been questioned.

&quot;I am willing to stand in front of a court and the Communist Party and prove what happened,&quot; Madisha said.

&quot;I wish to emphasise the point that yes, I received the R500 000 and handed the same to Nzimande.&quot;

Madisha, who is a member of the SACP's central committee, stopped short of calling Nzimande a liar.

The top unionist decried that while he seemingly had been fed to the wolves, Nzimande, who is also expected to be questioned by the SACP, appeared to have been protected by the party.

Madisha argued that &quot;sides were taken&quot; even before he had been approached for his version of the story.

He questioned the ethics of Nzimande being part of the SACP's central committee that drew up the investigation's terms of reference when the general secretary was in fact also under investigation.

Madisha said he still trusted the central committee's ability to reach a fair judgment.

The SACP's recently elected national chairperson, Gwede Mantashe, later told radio news that Nzimande was not being investigated at the moment.

Mantashe said they were not investigating Nzimande but only the allegation against him.

The same argument applied to Madisha.

Madisha was on Wednesday called before the SACP task team established to investigate the disappearance of the money, which was allegedly donated by Gauteng businessman Charles Modise four years ago.

Madisha told journalists that he knew &quot;every detail&quot; of what had happened when he allegedly received the money from Modise and then handed it to Nzimande.

He said that while he had provided those details in an affidavit he made to police, he was not at liberty to divulge this information because of the ongoing police investigation.

Madisha said he wanted the SACP to urgently get to the bottom of the matter because otherwise it could &quot;negatively affect&quot; the party.

3.2 Madisha willing to go to court to clear his name

SABC, 22 August 2007

The Congress of South Africa trade union (Cosatu) president, Willie Madisha, says he is willing to go to court to prove he did not steal the R500 000 intended for SA Communist Party (SACP) coffers. Madisha briefed the media in Johannesburg today following a meeting with a SACP task team investigating the donation.

Madisha has, for the first time, revealed that he gave the money donated by businessman Charles Modise to SACP general secretary, Blade Nzimande. Earlier this month, Madisha admitted on SABC radio to receiving the money, but did not name the person to whom he gave the amount.

Nzimande said: &quot;I wish to emphasise that yes, I collected the money. I received R500 000 and handed the same to the general secretary of the SACP, comrade Blade Nzimande.&quot;

Nzimande has denied receiving the money. &quot;I wish to place on record that I have never received any money,&quot; Nzimande said.

Madisha has also accused the SACP of branding him as the instigator of a smear campaign. He has called on the SACP to convene a press conference as a matter of urgency to clarify the position and clear his name.

3.3 Madisha adamant he was only 'taxi'

Karima Brown, Political Editor Business Day, 23 August 2007

CONGRESS of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) president Willie Madisha yesterday appeared isolated and embattled when he told a hastily convened one-man press conference that he was only the &quot;taxi&quot; which had &quot;received and delivered&quot; a R500000 cash donation.

Madisha insisted that he had handed over the cash to South African Communist Party (SACP) boss Blade Nzimande - despite the latter denying any knowledge of the donation.

However, Madisha refused to provide any evidence to journalists, saying the matter was the subject of a police investigation.

&quot;It's all in here,&quot; he said, holding a copy of an affidavit in the air, in response to questions about whether he had tangible proof that he in fact handed the cash to Nzimande.

He also lambasted the SACP task team set up to probe alleged financial irregularities in the party, saying he had been &quot;sacrificed&quot; to the media and that the task team had denied him access to &quot;natural justice&quot;.

However, SACP chairman Gwede Mantashe, who is spearheading the probe, remained unmoved by Madisha's statements to the media following the task team's meeting with him.

&quot;Madisha spoke to the SACP about this matter today for the first time. Is that the behaviour of a disciplined SACP member?

&quot;For five years he kept quiet about this allegation. If he was so concerned about wrongdoing, why did he not ever come forward on the matter long before? In fact I maintain my position that if Madisha received any monies from anybody, why is he not the one that is being charged?&quot; Mantashe said.

Madisha is embroiled in a bitter battle with the SACP leadership over the African National Congress presidential succession race. He is perceived to be a close ally of President Thabo Mbeki while the majority of the SACP leadership backs his rival, Jacob Zuma.

Yesterday Madisha addressed the media at the head office of the South African Democratic Teachers' Union (Sadtu ) in Johannesburg, without the knowledge of the political leadership in Sadtu and Cosatu.

Sadtu general secretary Thulas Nxesi said the union was &quot;taken aback&quot; at Madisha's decision to address the media.

&quot;We thought we would be taken into confidence as a union leadership because this matter affects the president of Sadtu, but we did not know anything about his media briefing.

&quot;Like everyone else, we are eagerly awaiting the outcome of this SACP process ,&quot; Nxesi said.

3.4 Madisha claims 'border on hypocrisy'

Mail &amp; Guardian, 23 August 2007

South African Communist Party (SACP) chairperson Gwede Mantashe has reacted to a statement made on Wednesday by Congress of South African Trade Unions president Willie Madisha that he had handed over a R500 000 donation to SACP general secretary Blade Nzimande.

&quot;I wish to emphasise that, yes, I received R500 000 and handed same to the general secretary of the SACP, comrade Blade Nzimande,&quot; Madisha told a media briefing in Johannesburg.

&quot;I am willing to go to the courts ... and actually prove that indeed this did happen. I'm willing to stand in front of the courts and the Communist Party, my own organisation, and prove that, yes indeed, this did happen,&quot; he said.

On Sunday, Nzimande denied ever receiving the R500 000 donation, which was allegedly made by businessman Charles Modise in 2002.

&quot;I wish to place it on record that I have never received the alleged R500 000 from any person, as is alleged. As the SACP has said, this is part of a concerted smear campaign primarily directed at discrediting the image and reputation of the SACP and tarnishing my image and integrity,&quot; he said in a statement.

Mantashe said on Wednesday evening: &quot;We have two contradicting statements now. We're giving the task team time to go through the evidence and produce a report.&quot; Madisha had met earlier on Monday with the task team set up by the SACP to investigate the disappearance of the money.

'Hypocrisy'
Mantashe dismissed Madisha's claims that the party had &quot;already tried, judged and sentenced me in the court of public opinion&quot; before he had given his side of the story.

Madisha had &quot;sat on the information&quot; for more than five years and did not disclose to the party that it had not received intended funds, he said. &quot;He didn't come to the structures in his own party, but went public -- I think that is bordering on hypocrisy.&quot;

Attempts had been made to talk to Madisha after media reports on the missing donation, but he had only been available on Wednesday, Mantashe said.

Madisha said he had not instituted any charges with police and at no stage accused any person of wrongdoing. &quot;I provided a statement setting out the relevant sequence of events ... confirming the receipt of the donation and the handing over of same.&quot;

He also said he did not know that the money had not reached party coffers until after the case was opened. &quot;I handed the money to the general secretary. That he had not handed it over to the party purse, I didn't know.&quot;

Earlier this month, Madisha had confirmed receiving the funds and was quoted as saying: &quot;I took it to the person to whom I was supposed to deliver it to.&quot; Two Sunday newspapers reported at the time that Nzimande was being investigated for theft and fraud in connection with the missing funds.

4 Manto Tshabalala-Msimang affair

4.1 Doc 'whistle blowing' ethical - Sama

IOL, 22 August 2007

The South African Medical Association (Sama) said on Wednesday that the &quot;whistle blowing&quot; on the part of a doctor at East London's Frere Hospital was an ethical and responsible intervention.

Professor Denise White, acting chairperson of Sama said investigations were needed to establish whether or not the rights of patients had been further violated by the suspensions of two doctors.

&quot;Sama calls on the department of health to appoint an independent commission of enquiry to investigate the serious state of affairs at the hospital and the factual grounds for the suspension of these two doctors,&quot; she said.

The dismissal of the two doctors would have a negative impact on morale in the public health sector.

&quot;Sama believes that these suspensions will have a negative impact on staff morale, not only at Frere hospital, but also on the public health sector in general.&quot;

The association said it was concerned that Frere hospital, often the last hope for the seriously ill in that part of the Eastern Cape, would be further compromised by the suspensions.

One of the suspensions involved Dr Nokuzola Ntshona, medical superintendent at the Frere Hospital who wrote to President Thabo Mbeki, highlighting the dire situation at the hospital.

The Daily Dispatch had reported that 2 000 babies were stillborn at the hospital's maternity ward over the past 14 years and that 43 new born babies had died in July. - Sapa

5.1 Who needs evidence anyway?

Essop Pahad, The Star, 23 August 2007

Consider the statement: &quot;The government commits itself to intensify the campaign against HIV and Aids and to improve its implementation of all elements of the comprehensive approach such as prevention, home-based care and treatment.&quot;

And add this: &quot;We shall ensure that the partnerships built over the years are strengthened, and that our improved national comprehensive strategy against Aids and sexually transmitted infections is finalised as soon as possible&quot;.

The words were spoken by the president of South Africa not long ago. Are they the words of a president &quot;in denial&quot; over the Aids epidemic in his country? The answer must be an emphatic No!

So why does the London Independent perpetuate myths and stereotypes without taking the time to undertake the first critical step in elementary journalism - check the facts?

The Independent of August 10, in three pages of prime coverage, with the usual single-subject Page 1 focus, recycles fiction as fact.

A piece billed &quot;A president in denial, a ravaged nation denied hope&quot;, written by foreign editor Katherine Butler, says: &quot;Thabo Mbeki's stance on Aids has left South Africa with the world's worst HIV epidemic. Yesterday, he silenced the woman fighting to end the suffering of millions.&quot;

Butler was referring to the dismissal of the deputy minister of health by President Thabo Mbeki.

The appointments and dismissals of ministers are within the absolute prerogative of the head of government of South Africa, and they do happen in the domestic politics of nations the world over without necessarily triggering such dark conclusions. Yet, in this case, the event is emblazoned across the front page as if it represents a new and disastrous turn in the destiny of South Africa in fighting Aids.

Governments generally work on the basis of norms and conventions which ministers should abide by. These vary depending on the country and the circumstances, but cabinet solidarity and collective responsibility are integral components of these norms and conventions.

In any democracy, where a member of the cabinet is unable to be a part of a collective or accept the decisions of the cabinet collective, they resign.

Working in a manner which is not collegiate and acting unilaterally, by - for instance - undertaking trips without presidential authority, are, in the South African context, not acceptable. And there are memorable cases in our democratic history where this has led to similar consequences.

The attempt to use this domestic event to rubbish the stance of the Mbeki government on HIV and Aids, particularly in the manner employed by The Independent, is as far-fetched as it is ridiculous.

There is not a shred of evidence produced and presented in the article to substantiate the claim that the president is a so-called Aids denialist. Surely a newspaper as reputable as The Independent ought not to reproduce myths without actually establishing the veracity of claims before publishing them.

Our commitment to fight the scourge, and to treat the sufferers quickly and effectively, remains as strong as ever.

The remarks by Mbeki quoted above, made in his state of the nation address when he formally opened parliament on February 9 this year, serve as corroboration.

It was Mbeki, as deputy president under President Nelson Mandela, who carried the banner of the fight against Aids in the 1990s, and then into his presidency from 1999, the lapel Aids ribbon being his trademark wherever he went.

Just where the second leader-writer of The Independent got the information that &quot;President Mbeki for a long time refused to put his weight behind a safe-sex awareness campaign&quot; - which even his sternest critics would not allege - is as elusive as it is obfuscatory.

The fact is that Mbeki now leads a government which has received United Nations and world commendation for its anti-Aids efforts. South Africa is in the forefront of the search for an effective vaccine.

The health authorities run a regularly updated and increasingly costly programme of both prevention and treatment which is accepted in informed quarters as one of the most comprehensive and extensive to be found in the world.

And who would deny that the country's splendid economic showing under Mbeki has underpinned its capacity to pay the high cost that is necessary?

Expenditure in recent years can only be described as exponential. Moreover, it was the Mbeki government that was in the forefront of the campaign to have the cost of Aids drugs reduced.

It is necessary to reassure those well-meaning people who may be in doubt and also those who have always seen the value of the South African campaign - particularly as it has been articulated since seminal cabinet decisions dating back to 2002 - that there is no hesitation on the road to beating this scourge.

There is in fact significant effort, as the president put it in his parliamentary address, to intensify the campaign.

The digging up of old controversies, as if they have relevance to the current situation, merely confuses the issues. So is point-scoring designed to discredit a leader who has reaped world renown as a man of peace and insight. The scourge we face is too great for such indulgences.

Even if one concedes that in epochal matters such as this there is room for differences over style and presentation of policy, it should be recognised that there is now no significant argument in South Africa about content.

It is time to call on people everywhere - notably our friends abroad who stood by us so solidly in past conflict - to work with us and help us to intensify this new struggle, so that the stunning success achieved when we threw off the yoke of repression in 1994 can be matched, even eclipsed, in facing the challenge.

We need the goodwill and the involvement of as many people of constructive intent as we can muster, for it is not only a national but a world scourge.

Those of permanent ill-will on the issue, for whatever reason, will be a diminishing band - be sure of it.

If a prominent member of a newspaper of standing is content to sit on the sidelines, to criticise negatively and to allege a &quot;disastrous regression&quot; when there is measurable progress, so be it. That will not deter us South Africans from pressing ahead with the fight. And we shall win the battle, in the same combined spirit which served to banish apartheid in the past.

5.2 Zuma's life in danger?

Sowetan, 23 August 2007

KHULA ZUMA, family spokesman, outlines the reasons why they feel a plot exists to kill the ANC deputy president Jacob Zuma

Following the burglary at our father Jacob Zuma's rented flat in Durban recently, the family wishes to express its disgust and concern.

Most importantly, it wishes to place on record its realisation that the threats against Zuma seem to be no longer mere threats, but sinister intentions with dire consequences.

The family notes that the public persecution of our father is a concentrated and deliberate effort to remove him, not only from political life, but also more importantly, from the present and future enjoyment of life in a free and democratic South Africa .

It has been almost 10 years since it first came to light that Zuma was being investigated, ironically by the democratic system that he helped put in place.

Despite his insistence that such an investigation was unwarranted, the state persisted .

During the process of the so-called investigation, there are a number of issues that raised the family's concerns.

?  There was the &quot;off-the- record&quot; briefing with editors at which former National Prosecuting Authority head Bulelani Ngcuka solicited the support of the media against Zuma.

It still baffles us what part of the law allows that, and what impact such a briefing was supposed to have on the anticipated legal proceedings.

?  The unprecedented grand press conference, attended by at least one cabinet minister, at which the same Ngcuka expansively announced that there was a prima facie case against Zuma, but that the case was unwinnable in court, and they would therefore not proceed.

Zuma was charged with corruption.

After he had been charged, the prosecution went out to investigate and collect evidence, a process which included the pre-dawn raids conducted at various premises.

It was again unprecedented that a person was charged by a prosecuting authority that had already concluded that the case was not winnable in court .

?  The action taken by President Thabo Mbeki to relieve Zuma of his duties as the deputy president of the country was based on the outcome of Schabir Shaik's trial.

When the president relieved Zuma of his duties, he said he was compelled by the constitution of the country to take such a decision. We have since looked at the constitution and we have not found anything that supports the president's assertion.

The president proceeded to quote our constitution, correctly saying that a person is innocent until proven guilty. But his action of relieving Zuma of his duties before he was found guilty by any court was a contradiction of this important principle.

In a subsequent address to the joint sitting of parliament, the president continued to say Zuma must have his day in court before Zuma was charged.

Our interpretation of the president's statement was that he was instructing the relevant organs of state to charge Zuma.

?  Our understanding is that the president based his decision to relieve Zuma of his duties largely on the finding by Judge Hillary Squires that there was a &quot;generally corrupt relationship&quot; between Zuma and Shaik.

From the outset, the Zuma family did not agree with that statement nor did it understand its logic.
Judge Squires subsequently clarified the point and categorically stated that he never made such a finding.

There has been no acknowledgement by the president of the false basis for his decision.

?  When Zuma was charged with rape, we always believed he would be found not guilty. Not only was this the case, but the trial revealed a sinister force.

Since then, there have been many developments including innuendo, fabrications, entrapment, horrendous insults and blatant defamation of his character aimed at destroying his standing in society.

Some of the examples of these psychological games include the so-called hoax e-mail saga .

Then Zuma was implicated in what has become known as the &quot;special browse mole&quot; report, linking him to bogus funding sources and containing more serious allegations against him.

Given the timing, the family cannot help but conclude that the recent burglary of Zuma's flat was not a random act of criminality, but a last-ditch effort and deliberate attempt on his life.

It saddens us that even in a free and democratic South Africa, as in the past, our family continues to suffer.

5.3 Wasting SA's chances with quick economic fixes

Rhoda Kadalie, Business Day, 23 August 2007

MAZIBUKO Jara, the former spokesman for the South African Communist Party (SACP), took my recent rejection of communism as a viable alternative to addressing poverty and unemployment in SA as a rejection of Marxist analysis. Communism is an ideology; Marxist analysis a methodology.

To conflate the two is just plain stupid. But I digress.

My main challenge to Jara is to show me workable models of the SACP's policy alternatives of state-led industrial policy frameworks, rural industrialisation, an economically sustainable development path and democratic ownership through co-operatives. The 21st century calls for scientific evidence that these policies will indeed address the dire poverty and unemployment in SA. Capitalism may be flawed, but it is still one of the best models that can take societies out of chronic poverty. May I remind Jara of Winston Churchill's prescient words: &quot;The inherent vice of capitalism is the unequal sharing of blessings; the inherent virtue of socialism is the equal sharing of miseries.&quot;

As for the African National Congress (ANC), its main achievement has been its credible commitment to low inflation and currency stability. Macroeconomic stability has had profound economic and even political consequences: growth has been strong, investors have persevered through adversity, and the ANC has enjoyed an otherwise unwarranted level of public trust.

In contrast, our northern neighbour, Zimbabwe, was swift to follow the temptation to play with monetary and fiscal policy, and brought on a hyperinflationary catastrophe .

The genesis of the problem was, of course, political. And that should be a lesson to us. SA should not play with economic fundamentals to solve political problems. The political problem in SA is that the government promised people quick fixes to enormous economic problems and is now incapable of creating jobs because it is captive to rigid labour policies and a poorly designed welfare state.

George Orwell once noted that the greatest enemy of a left-wing government is its previous propaganda. Today, there are many ANC ministers who know what needs to be done, but they belong to a government that has committed itself to ideological positions from which it refuses to budge.

Enter President Thabo Mbeki's group of international economic advisers. Members of the group, which is dominated by US and UK economists, may be specialists in their field, but each was handpicked by the treasury for their opposition to the Washington Consensus and preference for &quot;heterodox&quot; policies. Their recommendation: lower interest rates, allow inflation to rise and build up a budget surplus.

Let us try some scenario planning. Under a best-case scenario, a cheap rand will boost exports and employment. Prices may go up, but so will tourism, foreign investment and growth. But what if that does not happen? What if tourism and foreign investment remain stuck because of crime and skills shortages? What if low interest rates merely spark a spending frenzy and soaring household debt as the cost to South Africans of BMWs and American jeans rises? What if economic growth is purely consumption driven and unsustainable? And what if unemployment rises to its original level and we merely move from a state of high unemployment and low inflation to one of high unemployment and high inflation?

If this happens, the private sector will develop expectations of further inflation, and confounding those expectations by bringing inflation under control will cause a real drop in production. Fighting inflation later will mean raising taxes and cutting government spending - both of which will hurt ordinary people - politically impossible for the ANC. Instead of choosing this quick fix and risking the country's credibility and stability, the government should do what experts have been advising it to do for years.

The ANC should confront the reality that our schools are even worse than Zimbabwe's, according to the World Bank, and get primary education right. It should also show real political commitment to law enforcement by fighting crime in the streets and corruption in government. And it should open up the labour market to the unemployed by giving both workers and employers more choice.

The interventions we need are within our grasp and have been for some time. We have not lacked the expertise, but rather the political courage and ideological openness to chart a new course for the country.

5.5 Behind Mbeki's sacking of South Africa's deputy health minister

Chris Talbot, World Socialist Web Site, 23 August 2007

The sacking by President Thabo Mbeki of South Africa of his deputy health minister, Nozizwe Madlala-Routledge, has produced outrage amongst AIDS activists in South Africa and consternation among political commentators internationally.

The Treatment Action Campaign (TAC), the main organisation that has fought for AIDS drug treatment in South Africa, said, &quot;This is a dreadful error of judgement that will harm public health care and especially the response to the HIV epidemic.&quot;

Referring to Mbeki's notorious support for the small but vocal group of dissidents who deny that the HIV retrovirus causes AIDS, they added, &quot;It indicates that the president still remains opposed to the science of HIV and to appropriately responding to the epidemic.&quot;

Typical of the response in the Western press was the editorial in the New York Times, August 14, &quot;Unlike other African countries, South Africa has the financial resources and the medical talent to successfully take on its HIV/AIDS epidemic. What it lacks is a president who cares enough about his people's suffering to provide serious leadership.&quot;

Madlala-Routledge came to the fore in the latter half of last year when the health minister, Manto Tshabalala-Msimang, took sick leave to undergo a liver transplant operation. Tshabalala-Msimang shares Mbeki's attitude to antiretroviral (ARV) drugs and is notorious for promoting health foods, not in addition to ARV drugs but as an alternative-she has become known as &quot;Dr. Beetroot.&quot;

After a widely supported campaign led by the TAC, the African Nation Congress (ANC) government finally agreed to provide ARV drugs by the end of 2003. However, it continued to drag its feet over the next period, and provision has been patchy. At the end of last year, a draft five-year National Strategic HIV/AIDS plan was put forward, formally agreed to in March of this year, which campaigners regard as an improvement [*]. Even today, it is a scandal that only a third of those needing the drug are receiving it, according to the World Health Organisation.

Madlala-Routledge is credited with playing a major role in the recent improvement of drugs provision, publicising the campaign to get people to overcome reluctance to taking an HIV test by undergoing a test herself at a rural clinic. After Tshabalala-Msimang's return in June, there had been a growing conflict with her deputy.

In July, Madlala-Routledge made an unannounced visit to Frere Hospital in the South African town of East London, following a campaign in the local newspaper about the conditions there, with a very high infant mortality rate. She declared that the maternity ward in the hospital was part of a &quot;national emergency.&quot;

Tshabalala-Msimang's response was to send a team to investigate the situation and propose improvements, and suggested that the press reports were an exaggeration. Mbeki went further in his weekly ANC newsletter and claimed that the reports were false.

Madlala-Routledge was finally sacked after going to Spain to attend an AIDS conference without Mbeki's permission. She had immediately flown back without attending the conference when she heard that a note had arrived from Mbeki opposing the trip after she had already left.

Whilst it is true that Madlala-Routledge has played a role in somewhat improving the situation for ARV provision, her dispute with Mbeki and Tshabalala-Msimang is part of a much wider conflict that is taking place within the ANC. Madlala-Routledge is a leading member of the South African Communist Party (SACP)-a fact the New York Times editorial fails to mention-and was elected to its central committee at its July conference.

The SACP makes up a tripartite alliance with the trade unions in COSATU and the ruling ANC. Whilst smaller in size, it plays a key ideological role in the support of the ANC government, and fully supported the commitment to capitalism that was so vital to the United States and Western governments after the end of apartheid in 1994. However much the New York Times may criticise Mbeki over HIV/AIDS, it can hardly forget the role that he played in embracing free market capitalism in the 1990s.

Mbeki could not have achieved this without the SACP heading off working class opposition to the ANC's privatisation policies. Despite the sacking of Madlala-Routledge, it retains a number of cabinet posts in the government. But the SACP and COSATU, many of whose leaders are SACP members, are increasingly coming into conflict with Mbeki and the ANC majority. At its conference, two government cabinet ministers, Ronnie Kasrils, minister of intelligence, and Jeff Radebe, minister of transport, were voted off the central committee, and Charles Nqakula, minister for safety and security, was removed as party chairman though he remained on the central committee.

Latest news reports show that the factional disputes are intensifying. The South African Sunday Times has alleged that Health Minister Manto Tshabalala-Msimang had a liver transplant operation because she was a chronic alcoholic and had continued drinking before the operation. Normally, liver transplant operations, with scarce donor livers-in this case from a teenage suicide victim-are only carried out on patients who have given up alcohol. The Sunday Times also alleges that Tshabalala-Msimang has continued drinking after the operation. Secondly, the paper alleges that Tshabalala-Msimang, while superintendent of a hospital in Botswana in 1976, stole a watch and other items from patients. She was convicted and banned from the country as an undesirable alien.

So far, Mbeki has defended his health minister, stating that she is being &quot;demonised.&quot; His spokesman said he would not respond to demands to sack her unless evidence was produced.

The background to these divisions is the leftward movement in the South African working class and growing anger at the ANC government-as expressed in the huge support for the latest round of strikes.
After 13 years of ANC rule, the majority of families in South Africa live below the poverty line, and unemployment has doubled over the same period. Divisions between rich and poor have grown dramatically, with the ratio of CEO pay to workers' pay now standing at more than 50 to 1.

This June, Statistics South Africa published a report showing the impact of HIV/AIDS and the ANC's refusal to provide ARV drugs on the mortality rate. For those aged 25-49 years, the rise in registered deaths was 169 percent between 1997 and 2005.

The SACP has decided to present a &quot;left&quot; face to divert the mounting opposition to the ANC government over this social catastrophe into safe channels. The divisions between the SACP and the ANC leadership are entirely tactical and are not ones of principle or substance. To give just two examples of this: Madlala-Routledge was sent by Mbeki to speak to his trade union opponents in COSATU at their conference in 2006 and was in favour of cutting back South Africa's public sector. Mbeki's deputy president, Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka, a supporter of free market capitalism and presumably sensitive to Western government fears that Mbeki's AIDS policy could have a destabilising effect, teamed up with Madlala-Routledge in pushing through the provision of ART drugs.

It is in the debate over who will be the successor to Mbeki that the factional disputes have become most heated. The ANC leadership elections take place in December of this year, and Mbeki has announced that he will stand for a third term of office. Although he is barred by the constitution from standing as president for a third term in 2009, as ANC leader he would be able to put forward a chosen candidate.

The main candidate standing against Mbeki and backed by the SACP and COSATU is deputy ANC leader Jacob Zuma.

Zuma was sacked by Mbeki two years ago from his position as deputy president when his financial advisor, Schabir Shaik, was found guilty of corruption for his involvement in a government arms deal. Zuma's court case on corruption charges collapsed for lack of evidence, but now he faces a further trial as new evidence has emerged. In a separate trial last year, Zuma was acquitted for allegedly raping the daughter of a family friend.

Zuma had no differences with Mbeki over pro-market policies when he was in power. Although he has a populist style and relies on his long history in the ANC's struggle against apartheid to command support, his &quot;left&quot; credentials are bogus. He even spoke out against the recent public sector strike, claiming it damaged South Africa's international reputation. His standing amongst AIDS campaigners could hardly be lower-at the rape trial, he revealed his ignorance by saying he took a shower after having sex to make sure he was not infected.

The SACP remains deeply committed to its Stalinist traditions by presenting the ending of apartheid as a &quot;national democratic revolution,&quot; the two-stage theory that the Kremlin once used to carry out countless betrayals in developing countries. Socialism was always presented as the next stage of the revolution at some indeterminate future date, and those who attacked nationalist leaders for supporting capitalism were denounced as &quot;ultra left.&quot;

Now, the SACP claims it wants the democratic revolution to be taken further, with a so-called &quot;democratisation of the economy.&quot; With unconscious irony, Mbeki is currently attacking them as &quot;ultra left.&quot; An examination of the SACP's policy reveals that it is merely a revamping of the Stalinist doctrine of economic nationalism, calling for a &quot;strong industrial policy&quot; as opposed to the present government's reliance on exports in mining and agriculture. Socialism is described as a &quot;Medium Term Vision.&quot;

No reliance can be placed on an SACP- and COSATU-backed Zuma government, including Madlala-Routledge, to develop an adequate policy on HIV/AIDS as opposed to Mbeki, or any other pressing social issue. There could be no guarantee that the ART rollout would proceed beyond its present limited level without a huge injection of funds into the health service. Such provisions, as well as measures to tackle the chronic levels of poverty and unemployment, cannot be provided under the profit system that the SACP defends.

The development of a new working class movement based on an internationalist and socialist perspective, opposed to the ANC and also the SACP and COSATU, is sharply posed throughout the Africa continent
