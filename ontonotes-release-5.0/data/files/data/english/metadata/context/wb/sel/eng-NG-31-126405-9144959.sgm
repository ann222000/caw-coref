Hi iptables gurus

could someone assume the lotus position and tell me how to reverse nat
properly

iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -d 208.185.9.1 -s 208.185.9.0/24 -p tcp
--dport 18245 -j SNAT --to 208.185.9.236

I am trying to map a private side address (208.185.9.0/24 I know I
know
its not a IEEE non-routable but anyway that is set up as a private
side)
any TCP coming in for port 18245 needs to goto 208.285.9.236 , which
doesn't have a gateway on it , and I need the packet edited to say the
source addr is the NATting router 208.185.9.1 (backend) 128.233.18.148
frontend does my above command look valid? If so how do I see that its
being used iptables -L doesn't show it?

more pertinent info:
rp# uname -a
Linux rp 2.4.30 #2 Thu May 5 03:57:22 EDT 2005 i686 unknown
