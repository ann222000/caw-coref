So now even non-Jews have more rights in Israel than non-Orthodox Jews.

The day Masorti and Reform Jews can be married by their own rabbis in Israel
will be a cause for celebration.

To be more precise than your (as usual) rewritten header would suggest, the
new law permits civil marriages for anyone who doesn't qualify for a
religious marriage, i.e. which would include people who consider themselves
Jewish but are not Jewish in accordance with [Orthodox] halacha. So, someone
whom the Reform consider Jewish as a result of patrilineal descent, for
example, would qualify for a civil marriage. Interfaith marriages or
marriages where one or both of the partners is an R or C convert would
qualify for a civil marriage. Of course, if you, Jay, want to consider R and
C converts &quot;non-Jews&quot; (since your subject line suggests that civil marriage
will be permitted to non-Jews only) that is your prerogative, but I would
find that a little surprising coming from you.

Mea culpa. I didn't read far enough. Apparently, interfaith marriages or any

for the civil marriage.

Incorrect, Cindy. The headline is accurate. Read the article. Civil
marriages would only be permitted where BOTH parties are considered
halachically non-Jewish. Not mixed marriages. It is permitted to non-Jews
only. What they're saying is if you're Reform and consider yourself
Jewish, but the Haredim do not consider you Jewish, then you can be
married in a civil court simply by declaring yourself a non-Jew.

Nice.

Steve, the decision as to who is Jewish rests not with the individual, but
with the rabbinate. I can't declare myself to be a non-Jew according to the
proposed law. The rabbanut will be the only body empowered to do that.

This proposed law needs to go through several committee readings and then
the knesset plenum (3 readings)  to become law. It is not guaranteed that
the O parties will agree (they listen to their political leaders more than
they listen to the chief rabbis). There is, in my view, a major pitfall
which the politicos will likely recognize at once.

At this time, the Israeli Supreme Court is (still) liberal. This may change
slightly, now that Aharon Barak has left, but perhaps not soon enough for
the Os.

The day after this law is passed, a lawsuit will very likely be filed with
the court, complaining against gross discrimination. If Dimitri is not
considered Jewish and may marry Natasha in an Israeli civil ceremony, why
can't I, Yossi, born in Israel to a Jewish mother,  who AM halachically
Jewish, not marry the same beautiful Natasha?

Why is the state forcing me to go to Cyprus to be married by a non-Jewish
non-Israeli civil servant when the state has the capability -- and the
institution -- for marrying me right here and now?

The court may not agree that this is discrimination. But it will be an
interesting fight.

What I meant by declare yourself a non-Jew is that they're forcing you to
accept that the decision is made by the rabbinate. That is, if Bob
considers himself Jewish but the rabbinate does not, if Bob wants to get
married under this legislation he would in effect have to renounce his
claim of Jewishness - he'd probably have to sign something saying &quot;as a
non-Jew, I wish to be married in a civil court.&quot; Then, just as a ketubah
often serves as an official record of one's Jewishness, Bob would now have
an official record of his non-Jewishness, despite how he feels about it
himself.

You may be correct.  Actually, the haredi parties may use this as &quot;proof&quot; --
see, even Bob himself admits he is not Jewish.

And this just in from the JTA (notice the last two paragraphs -- I'm
beginning to like this Minister of Justice more and more.

Israel edges toward civil weddings
E-mail News Brief
Tell the Editors

Published: 07/18/2007

A bill approved by Israel's Chief Rabbinate would allow civil weddings
for non-Jews.

Justice Minister Daniel Friedmann and Sephardi Chief Rabbi Shlomo Amar
announced new legislation this week that would recognize
civil weddings performed in Israel for couples in which neither bride
nor groom is Jewish under Orthodox law.

The bill, which is expected to win Knesset ratification, could address
the needs of some 300,000 Israelis -- most of them immigrants from the
former Soviet Union -- who are barred from marrying in the Jewish state
because they are considered gentiles by the rabbinate. It would not,
however, be applicable for unions between a Jew and a non-Jew.

Friedmann voiced hope that civil weddings eventually will become an
option for mainstream Israelis who do not want to go the Orthodox route,
currently the only legally recognized one.

&quot;I hope that with time it will be possible to persuade the political
bodies that broadening this is warranted, and that it will be broadened,&quot; he
told Israel Radio on Thursday.

I suppose then that it's lucky for you that you had that option. What
about those women who live in Israel and don't? Would speaking out on
their behalf be &quot;hareidi-bashing?&quot;

I really don't mean this as a knock against you, Cindy, I appreciate your
frankness here. It just sometimes seems that you're quick to defend
practices when you don't mind them, e.g., sitting in the back of the bus,
but then carve out exceptions for yourself when it's something you do or
don't want to do, e.g., prove you went to the mikveh, or attend a gemara
shiur. It's just human nature, I'm not condemning you for it, just
pointing out how it comes across.

Miriam Shear didn't ride on such a bus either. You're saying the rights of

for you to say, you live in Rochester.

You're arguing the wrong side of this I think, since by what you say you
support the right of individuals to choose -- to decide for themselves if
they want an O rabbi who requires the mikvah certificate or the right to
find one who doesn't. The right to ride in the front of the bus. But you
object strenously when people defend that right for women in Israel.

Once again easy for you to say because you live in Rochester. The women in
Israel don't have that choice, and the rabbinate is apparently attempting
to make those choices even more limited. That's what Jay posts about, and
you slam him for it. Given what you're saying you ought to be *defending*
the right of individuals to decide for themselves, rather than attacking
it.

Nobody has suggested that the rabbinate ought not be allowed to dictate
the rules for their constituents. Only that they should be limited in
doing so for non-constituents. You clearly want this for yourself, why are
you so opposed to permitting it for others?

I'm saying that if a group of people make special arrangements to have a

discussion again, as I said before, I still think she was trying to make a
statement and start a fight. I don't believe for a moment that she
innocently got on a bus, had no idea it was separate seating, and she
remained in the front only because it was more comfortable for her. And no,
I am not saying that it made it okay for those men to beat her up. But IMHO,
this &quot;poor innocent me... I had no idea...I wasn't trying to start any

I think sometimes people forget that the chareidim have rights too. For me,
these issues are not about &quot;women's rights.&quot; I used to go to gemara class in
the shul down the street. There was only one class being offered on Saturday
afternoon. Now, there are several different gemara and mishna classes being
offered on various days of the week, at different times of day, including
daf yomi -- and every single class is for men only. They're entitled to do
that. And I am entitled to withhold my donations. I used to make a lot of
very generous donations to the shul. Now, I donate nothing, and I don't
daven there either. But, they are certainly entitled to have mens-only
classes if that's what they want.

Au contraire, I think a lot of people on this group are saying exactly that,
and that's where the chareidi-bashing comes in. The women's clothing
guidelines were a classic example. The gedolim were writing guidelines for
their own constituents and providing special certificates for shops in their
own neighborhoods that agreed to limit their stock to clothing that fell
within the guidelines. Despite the fact that I doubt most of the non-O
SCJMers even had a clue about what the guidelines were (and even though I
repeatedly explained that the clothing of most chareidi women in Israel
already fell within the guidelines) and even though I repeatedly explained
that the guidelines impacted only the constituents of the gedolim in
question, nevertheless, we saw post after post where various posters were
bashing the chareidim for &quot;forcibly controlling women,&quot; forcing them to wear
burkas (sic) (or the closest thing to it), and even dragging chareidi women
off to &quot;modesty courts&quot; where they were supposedly being forced to stand
trial. I was amazed that no one suggested the women were being stoned to
death. That is chareidi bashing.

Who said I'm opposed? I just think chareidim have their rights too, and I
don't think that someone's &quot;right&quot; to eat pork should supercede the chareidi
right not to have to see pork for sale in the supermarket in Mea Shearim.

Once again I think this is a rather odd stance for a woman to take,
particularly one who's expressed the ideas that you have. It's OK for you,
because you have choices. What choices does a Haredi woman in Mea Shearim
have? Who will defend her rights, if not women like you? If these women
are truly free to do as they wish, then why did the local rabbinate feel
that it was necessary to prevent the stores from selling these items? If
what you say is correct, then there'd be no market for immodest clothing
in the first place. The only reason to prevent the stores from selling it
would be to prevent women from buying what they want to buy. You're the
one advocating restrictions on people's rights here.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;Only that they should be limited in
&gt;&gt; doing so for non-constituents. You clearly want this for yourself, why are
&gt;&gt; you so opposed to permitting it for others?
&gt;Who said I'm opposed? I just think chareidim have their rights too, and I
&gt;don't think that someone's &quot;right&quot; to eat pork should supercede the chareidi
&gt;right not to have to see pork for sale in the supermarket in Mea Shearim.
">

Once again, how is that a right? The right not to see pork for sale?? If
everyone is a constituent, then no one wants to eat pork in the first
place, so there's no market. But if there is pork, then someone wants to
buy it, so once again you're not supporting anyone's rights you've
blocking them -- you want to PREVENT someone from doing something they
want to do. No one's preventing the Hareidim from doing anything - they're
free to not buy pork.

Once again, how on earth can you insist on your right to find a gemara
shiur, or to sit in the front of the bus, when you don't see that as any
sort of right for the women in Israel? I'm sure that there are men in that
yeshiva who are offended by the very idea that you would dare to learn
gemara -- aren't you violating their rights by doing so, even if you do it
somewhere else? By your logic you certainly are.

of

Steve, what the rabbis did is tantamount to a legal condition. You want to
have our certificate? Then sell modest clothing. You don't want to? Please
yourself. But our constituents will not shop at your store. They will look
for our certificate in the window. You don't HAVE to have one, but don't
expect them to enter.

It's legal. Just as it's legal for haredim to shop at a store that they know
does not sell any unkosher meat. Just as it's legal for me not to shop at a
bookstore which promotes anti-Semitic books.

What is improper is that they try to foist their customs on others. You
don't want a gay pride parade in Mea Shearim? Fine. The gays won't march
there. But to declare all of Jerusalem out of bounds? That's where the
haredim go wrong.

That was never my understanding.

The route was approximately 1/2 mile, from the intersection of Hess
and King David down King David to Liberty Bell Park.  See, eg,

better versed in Jerusalem geography to describe the area.

Why do you think she wants her &quot;rights&quot; defended? I think that is exactly
the point. From where I sit, chareidi women are perfectly happy with the
status quo and want to keep it that way. The frum women I know (who are
extremely liberal compared to the ones in Mea Shearim) like the segregation,
like the back of the bus, seek out the women's only classes, shudder at the
idea of mixed seating or being in classes with men, welcomed the tsnius
clothing guidelines etc. It's the women themselves who are pushing for all
of this stuff. This is what many people on this newsgroup simply don't seem

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

They didn't prevent them. You don't understand the mentality. I sat at a
women's only gathering one day last summer and listened to a group of frum
(but not-so-Chareidi) women express their frustration and confusion over the
fact that they were confused about what was looking &quot;nice&quot; and what was
looking &quot;too nice.&quot; . One woman even admitted she was losing sleep over
this. These women were bemoaning the fact that they were all confused about
what was tsniusdik (modest) clothing and what wasn't. So, the rabbis simply
spelled it out for them, so they could stop being so confused. Then, they
(the rabbis) went to the clothing shops of the proprieters who were
interested in getting certification, looked over their stock (99% of which
was probably already within the guidelines), maybe took out an odd sweater
or skirt here or there that was slightly short or a little clingy, and then
said &quot;Done! Here's your certificate.&quot; Then, the rabbis told these confused
women that they can confidently buy at Shop X without having to decide for
themselves what is tsniusdik and what is not because everything in the shop
has been certified. It's like the difference between shopping at the
Hungarian Kosher Supermarket in Chicago versus the local Jewel (where you

*everything* in the market has presumably been certified kosher by the cRc
(Chicago Rabbinical Council), so there is no need to question if the
Okifinokee-K is reliable or not. It eliminates the guesswork so people don't
have to think so hard.

They're not preventing any store from selling anything. They're telling the

they're not allowed to carry plain-K items in the shop. The supermarket can

I just wanted to elaborate a little bit here. I think you are envisioning a
situation where shops were selling all sorts of clothing (long skirts and
mini-skirts, e.g.) and they had a decent-sized customer base who wanted to
buy mini-skirts and the rabbis somehow stepped in to prevent that. No! There
were no miniskirts in the first place. The shops were selling only long
skirts but some of the skirts were maybe a little bit longer than others or
were made out of knitted material that was a little clingy. Women who were
intending to dress modestly would buy these slightly shorter skirts or
knitted skirts under the assumption that the items were acceptably
tsniusdik, or they wouldn't be sure if they were acceptably tsniusdik or
not. The women were looking for guidelines. The rabbis were sorting things
out for them (their constituencies). This was not about women wanting to buy
sexy, revealing outfits and the rabbis taking steps to restrict them from
doing that by controlling the items that the stores were permitted to sell.
If a shopkeeper were making a fortune selling halter tops and shorts, he
would have no motivation to seek the certification. The shopkeepers' motive
for conforming was the hope of making his business more successful. I would
suspect that in most cases, the changes that the shopkeepers were making
were probably minimal. I will look to Moshe Shorr to correct me if I got
this wrong.

-------
The difference in the Jerusalem situation is that you have a busload of
people, men and women, who equally find the gender segregation desirable.
Special arrangements are made with the bus company that certain runs/certain
buses are separated by gender. By necessity, when there is segregation by
gender, one gender needs to sit in the front and the other in the back, or
one side of the aisle needs to be designated for men and the other for
women. There are gender segregated private buses in the USA as well (used by
the Orthodox communities in New York City), and it is my understanding that
they are indeed set up the latter way. The argument for women in the back of
the bus (versus the front) is that they sometimes like to nurse their babies
and would be unable to do so if they were up front where the men could see
them.

The issue in this situation was not the legitimacy of gender segregation in
and of itself but rather that the particular bus in question was not one of
the specially designated buses.

This is quite different from the situation in Montgomery where blacks were
forced to sit in the back of public buses against their will because of
discrimination. In Jerusalem, the religious women voluntarily want to be
gender segregated, insist on it, and this one woman was acting in opposition
to the will of the majority (including all the other women on the bus). In
the religious Jewish world, the movement is going toward increased gender
segregation, not less, and this is desired by both men and women.

This is not a situation where women are being forced to sit in the back of
the bus against their will and Miriam Shear's action is going to make a
statement for &quot;women's rights&quot; and change all of that and women are going to
thank her for it. The women on the bus were every bit as incensed as the
men. Totally different situation.

An Orthodox shul is entitled to have separate seating, even at a wedding.
What it is NOT entitled to do is lobby, through its politicans, to prevent C
and R synagogues from being built, and C and R rabbis from being able to
officiate at those synagogues. There is a major struggle for every permit to
build R ansd C synagogues in Israel.

No, they would not at this time, but having heard Minister of Justice Friedman

I'm not claiming it's illegal, just improper. It's over-stepping, IMO. Not
hugely overstepping, it's in a pretty gray area, but it's getting there.
Seems to me that the women know what clothing is modest and what isn't,
so what's the intent of certifying the stores? Not to ensure that Hareidi
women have modest clothing available - they already do. The only purpose
would be to control the non-Haredi population, those who might want a
short-sleeve shirt for example.

It only becomes an issue in a place where the rabbinate has quasi- or
actual governmental authority, as they seem to in Israel. I have less of a
problem with this in the US - actually I don't have any problem with it in
the US.

Interesting question. It becomes an issue of the right of free association

Why? There's no halacha against sitting in a seat behind a woman. Very
Orthodox men in NYC do it every single day. People like Micha Berger even
(gasp) work in offices where they might be forced to speak to women (the
horror.) If these men feel that they can't ride on a bus with women, then
let them hire their own bus and they can do whatever they like. But by all
accounts this was a regular public bus, and Miriam Shear had a right to
sit wherever she damn well pleased. Further, she didn't ask anyone else to
get up - the person who started the altercation was the man who asked her
to get up. What kind of a man asks a woman to get out of her seat?

Kosher certification? These clothes are for eating? What are you talking

&gt;&gt; have? Who will defend her rights, if not women like you?
&gt;Why do you think she wants her &quot;rights&quot; defended? I think that is exactly
&gt;the point. From where I sit, chareidi women are perfectly happy with the
&gt;status quo and want to keep it that way. The frum women I know (who are
&gt;extremely liberal compared to the ones in Mea Shearim) like the segregation,
&gt;like the back of the bus, seek out the women's only classes, shudder at the
&gt;idea of mixed seating or being in classes with men, welcomed the tsnius
&gt;clothing guidelines etc. It's the women themselves who are pushing for all
&gt;of this stuff. This is what many people on this newsgroup simply don't seem
&gt;to &quot;get.&quot;

Every single one of them? There isn't a single woman in the Haredi
community who would like anything different? A liberal society has to
defend the minority, the majority can take care of itself.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;If these women
&gt;&gt; are truly free to do as they wish, then why did the local rabbinate feel
&gt;&gt; that it was necessary to prevent the stores from selling these items?
&gt;They didn't prevent them. You don't understand the mentality. I sat at a
&gt;women's only gathering one day last summer and listened to a group of frum
&gt;(but not-so-Chareidi) women express their frustration and confusion over the
&gt;fact that they were confused about what was looking &quot;nice&quot; and what was
&gt;looking &quot;too nice.&quot; . One woman even admitted she was losing sleep over
&gt;this. These women were bemoaning the fact that they were all confused about
&gt;what was tsniusdik (modest) clothing and what wasn't. So, the rabbis simply
&gt;spelled it out for them, so they could stop being so confused. Then, they
&gt;(the rabbis) went to the clothing shops of the proprieters who were
&gt;interested in getting certification, looked over their stock (99% of which
&gt;was probably already within the guidelines), maybe took out an odd sweater
&gt;or skirt here or there that was slightly short or a little clingy, and then
&gt;said &quot;Done! Here's your certificate.&quot; Then, the rabbis told these confused
&gt;women that they can confidently buy at Shop X without having to decide for
&gt;themselves what is tsniusdik and what is not because everything in the shop
&gt;has been certified. It's like the difference between shopping at the
&gt;Hungarian Kosher Supermarket in Chicago versus the local Jewel (where you
&gt;need to check the labels for hechsherim). At the kosher supermarket,
&gt;*everything* in the market has presumably been certified kosher by the cRc
&gt;(Chicago Rabbinical Council), so there is no need to question if the
&gt;Okifinokee-K is reliable or not. It eliminates the guesswork so people don't
&gt;have to think so hard.
">

Oh, so women are stupid and shouldn't be forced to think... OK, I didn't
realize that. You know if the women just wore burqas this problem would be
eliminated. Seriously, why not just have standardized clothing? It
eliminates the guesswork, and also reduces the competition and gossip.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;If
&gt;&gt; what you say is correct, then there'd be no market for immodest clothing

So what's the point of the certificate again? Is it really that
complicated to be modest? Why are these women so determined to push the
envelope? Perhaps they should be punished.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;The only reason to prevent the stores from selling it
&gt;&gt; would be to prevent women from buying what they want to buy.
&gt;They're not preventing any store from selling anything. They're telling the
&gt;Hungarian Kosher Supermarket that if they want the hechsher of the cRc,
&gt;they're not allowed to carry plain-K items in the shop. The supermarket can
&gt;take it or leave it.
">

That's not what I said - I said they're preventing people from BUYING what
they want to buy. Someone wants that plain-K item, otherwise the store
wouldn't carry it. So the intent isn't to prevent the store from selling
an item nobody wants, they intent is to prevent people from buying
something they DO want.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;You're the

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Once again, how is that a right? The right not to see pork for sale?? If

&gt;Why can't the pork eaters shop in another store? Why is the chareidi

No, they don't. That was the whole point for having a modesty conference in

about the details. That was the issue. I heard it with my own two ears

issue, trying to determine where to draw the line between looking &quot;nice&quot; and
looking &quot;too nice.&quot; (I don't understand this mentality at all, but I'm not
them.) &quot;Modesty&quot; in clothing is not only about the length of one's skirt.
It's also about the length of the blouse, what material it's made out of, if
it's fitted or loose, how fitted, how loose, etc. It's also about the length
of the sheitl (wig) and the color and style. It apparently gets very

You keep asserting this, and it's simply not true. The shops in question
were chareidi shops to begin with. Non-chareidi women were generally not
shopping at these places in the first place, and sexy clothing is readily
available at hundreds or thousands of shops located throughout Israel for
anyone who wants to buy it. The rabbis are trying to ensure that *Chareidi
women*  are wearing clothing that conforms to the guidelines (which the
women themselves were requesting). This does not involve non-Chareidi women
at all.

Yes, their opinions are irrevelant, but not because they're the &quot;minority.&quot;
It's because chareidi society is not a democracy, and what is perceived to
be to the benefit of the community as a whole supersedes the desires of the
individual.  Of course, if a chareidi woman doesn't like how the systems
works, she is free to leave the community. Of course this would be extremely
difficult for her for a multiplicity of reasons, but that's not the
community's problem. Chareidi society is not a democracy and does not
applaud individual achievement, innovation, independent thinking, etc.
Chareidi society values conformity.

&gt; Yes, their opinions are irrevelant, but not because they're the &quot;minority.&quot;
&gt; It's because chareidi society is not a democracy, and what is perceived to
&gt; be to the benefit of the community as a whole supersedes the desires of the
&gt; individual.  Of course, if a chareidi woman doesn't like how the systems
&gt; works, she is free to leave the community. Of course this would be extremely
&gt; difficult for her for a multiplicity of reasons, but that's not the
&gt; community's problem. Chareidi society is not a democracy and does not
&gt; applaud individual achievement, innovation, independent thinking, etc.
&gt; Chareidi society values conformity.

Except you just confirmed Steve's second example that it's okay if
only men decide what's best for the community as a whole, and what
the women want is irrelevant (100% of the men (so 50% of the
population) + 1% of the women, meaning 49% of the population may be
against it).  He's not talking about individuals deciding to go
against the society, he's talking about half of the society feeling
one way, and half of the society feeling the other way.

Shabbat shalom,
Tim

As I've stated before on this forum, it's not about *men* (generic) deciding
what's best for the community (and women not having any input). It's about
the gedolim deciding what's best for *everybody* (both men and women).

If 99% of the population then goes against the 1% of the gedolim, at
what point do they punt out the gedolim?  ;-)
