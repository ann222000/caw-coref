Hi all,
I design and run all the lights for my high school and lately we've
been having problems with the sound and lights interfering with one
another. We have a sound system that allows us to switch between
theatre (includes overhead mics) and main (no overhead mics). The
problem I'm having is that if I use the main mode the lights work fine
and theres no interference, but if i have it on theatre mode a loud
buzz comes out of the speakers when i bring the lights up and down but
not when they are at 100 or 0 power. I talked to someone in the school
about getting it looked at but they said a factor in determining how/if
it would get fixed was money. Any suggestions about possible causes??
We are presenting the Music Man at the end of March and it will be
really hard to deal with that because there aregoing to be quite a few
lighting changes.

if its only when its dimmed, not full,  it sounds like the electricial
noise the dimmers generate. By the nature of how they dim, they
generate quite a bit of noise.  im not exactly sure how to fix it, but
maybe hooking the two systems to different circuits if they arent
already?  also, if the microphone cables are near the power wires, they
may be picking up the noise. try moving the wires (mics, light power
cables, or both) to a different location farther away from eachother.
also, check all the groundings/ shieldings on all the cables- if your
using a snake its possible that the shielding is broken somewhere. im
not sure if / where they have it, but some sort of extra shielding for
the mic cables probably cant hurt.
hope this helps

Sounds like a ground issue. Is there any dimming or lighting systems on the
same circuits as the sound board and equip?

Like chris said it sounds like an electrical noise problem. See if you can
get your district's electricians out to check out the wiring. The lighting
and audio system should be on two separate circuits. Also check to see if
your amplifiers and your sound board are on the same circuit. That will make
a difference. In theory both circuits should have power
isolators/conditioners on them.

Are you using SCR (Silicon Controlled Rectifier) dimmers?

My clue was "~Between 1-99%!~"  Back in the Mid-80's I worked in a
Theater which had an SCR,  and every single time they faded up the
lighting, it sounded almost like the Audio System was gonna explode!

There are 2 causes for this... the main one i forget and it is complex
but easy to fix when you know it... the second one is just that the
sound cables and lighting cables are to close... separate them a bit
and see how it goes.

Make certain that the lighting console is properly grounded.

Your lighting equipment (dimmers and console) need to be grounded
separately from your audio ground. This is a major issue to be looked
at by licensed electrician. Most theatres specifically install a
separate "isolated ground" to be used exclusively for house audio
equipment to avoid this exact issue.
Good luck.

Thanks for all the great info. The main problem is that while we are
grounding the system, we cant put the lights and sound on different
circuits because we put our boards at the back of our high school gym
(thats where the stage is). We've tried moving the overhead mics to
different spots or eventurning them off completely but that hasnt
seemed to help. Also, what is confusing that for the past two years, we
havent had a problem, it just started before our last production.

That sounds like a cable or some other piece of equipment was damaged and causing a grounding problem.

What kind of sound board are you running? I'm guessing what Jamie is
referring to is known as the "Pin 1 problem" and many (if not most)
inexpensive sound boards exhibit it. There isn't an easy way to fix it
(beyond doing lots of internal modifications you probably don't want to deal
with) so you'll have to find a workaround. If you want to read up on it,
here's the AES (Audio Engineering Society) standard which explains how to
properly ground audio systems:

http://www.aes.org/publications/standards/search.cfm?docID=44
(free download at bottom)

Here is one way to troubleshoot it -- cause the "buzz" to start happening,
and then unplug mic inputs to your sound board one by one. When you find the
culprit, trace that mic cable. My guess is it goes either in a conduit with
lighting cables, or is tied alongside lighting power feeds. Try separating
it and running perpendicular to lighting/power cable where possible.

Whether the light board and sound board are on the same circuit at FOH is
inconsequential here -- the lighting board isn't what is causing it, it's
the dimmers (almost definitely SCRs). It could be improper grounding of the
dimmer rack, which you'll have to get an electrician to fix.

Under no circumstances should you use a "ground lift" adapter on the power
plug for your sound board, amps, or speakers. It may solve the hum, but it
may also kill someone. It's not worth it, and it's illegal.

Hope that helps

The last band I worked with before my Accident
( http://omnitech.sasktelwebsite.net/tsomax20.htm ) in the Mid-80's was
terrible for doing very unsafe things, before I joined with them, they
were doing things like making a 4-circuit Multicable with 6 18-gauge
Wires (for 1000 Watt PAR cans) or building a distro with 20-Amp
Breakers, but only 15-amp Receptacles (household -- not industrial grade
-- U-ground Receptacles are the Achilles heel of the North American
Electrical System).  They also wired up a 15-Amp U-ground receptacle on
the same circuit as a 50/50 Range plug in same distribution panel.
Because of thhis, I wouldn't let them disassemble these, and I kept them
to this day in my Garden sdhed as a reminder of simpler times, when
people without Electrician's Papers could do work like this!  I won't
even scare you by telling you about the Tie-ins they did before I was hired!
