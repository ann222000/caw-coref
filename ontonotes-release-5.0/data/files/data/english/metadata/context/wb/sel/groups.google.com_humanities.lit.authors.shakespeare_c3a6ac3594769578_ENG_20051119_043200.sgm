'Two loves have I'

Shakespeare's sonnets appeared to tell a story - of his anguished
private life. So who were the Fair Youth, the Dark Lady and Mr WH?
William Boyd on the Bard's love triangle

Saturday November 19, 2005
The Guardian

There are many mysteries in the life of William Shakespeare and
perhaps none is more intriguing than the one he initiated himself when
he published, in 1609, a collection of his sonnets. When we start to
consider the enduring enigmas and controversies that circle and shroud
the sonnets, it is a good idea to establish the few unarguable facts
first. The sonnets - the greatest lyric sequence of love poems ever
written - were published seven years before Shakespeare's death in
1616, and some years after the last poems were written. There are 154
sonnets in total: 126 of them are addressed to a &quot;Fair Youth&quot;, a young
man of aristocratic breeding; 26 of them concern a &quot;Dark Lady&quot;,
conspicuously not aristocratic. The last two are bawdy allusions to
the notorious mercury baths, the favoured contemporary form of
treatment for the pox.

Furthermore, the sonnets possess a baffling dedication to one &quot;Mr WH&quot;,
described as &quot;the only begetter of these ensuing sonnets&quot;. What more
can one add before entering the lists of contention and dissent? It is
fair to say that some of the sonnets to the Fair Youth are unabashedly
homoerotic, others display a wistful, unrequited sensuality, rather
like that of Aschenbach for Tadzio in Thomas Mann's Death in Venice.
On the other hand, some of the sonnets addressed to the Dark Lady are
unabashedly misogynistic, full of lingering physical detail, and
relentlessly explore the consuming and destructive power of lust.
However, the problems inherent in the sonnets begin to multiply
incrementally when someone asks you to write a film about them.

This happened to me last year when the BBC approached me to write a
full-length film - a drama - about Shakespeare and the emotional
background to the sonnets as a counterpoint to their modern-dress
Shakespeare Retold season. We would have to cast Shakespeare, Mr WH
and the Dark Lady (Rupert Graves, Tom Sturridge and Indira Varma, as
it turned out). In which case, there could be no place for scholarly
equivocation: &quot;It might be argued that&quot;, &quot;Evidence would seem to
suggest&quot;, and so on. If I were going to make Shakespeare, the Fair
Youth and the Dark Lady live and breathe on screen I would need to
establish their particular identities - if not once and for all (that
will never happen), but at least for the duration of the film. And so
the reading began.

The very rough narrative of the sequence (and there is no evidence to
establish the sonnets were written chronologically) goes something
like this: the first 17 sonnets are somewhat orthodox - the poet
encourages the young man to marry and bear children. Then the
obsession begins to grow and become more sexually orientated, more
yearning and infatuated:
&quot;Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate&quot;
And,
&quot;Since [nature] pricked thee out for woman's pleasure,
Mine be thy love, and thy love's use their treasure.&quot;
The salacious pun is intended. And then eventually, at sonnet 127, the
Dark Lady arrives:
&quot;In the old age black was not counted fair
Or if it were, it bore not beauty's name&quot;
Now the tone alters, becomes more tormented and idealisation gives way
to the concrete:
&quot;If snow be white, why then her breasts are dun;
If hairs be wires, black wires grow upon her head.&quot;
The poet's relationship with the Dark Lady is obsessive, rapt and
often hate-driven; full of distress and anguished self-analysis. Then
it becomes clear that the Dark Lady and the Fair Youth are engaged in
some sort of sexual dalliance. The poet can only look on, impotent and
suffering:
&quot;Two loves have I of comfort and despair,
Which like two spirits do suggest me still;
The better angel is a man right fair, The worser spirit a woman
coloured ill.
To win me soon to hell, my female evil
Tempteth my better angel from my side ... &quot;
The sequence ends with the poet &quot;sick withal&quot; going to the mercury
baths seeking a cure:
&quot; ... I, my mistress' thrall,
Came there for cure, and this by that I prove;
Love's fire heats water, water cools not love.&quot;

The conclusion would seem to suggest that desire - love - is wholly
out of our control, whatever the emotional agonies endured or other
physical penalties paid. All this is to make highly complex poems and
knotted, sophisticated arguments seem concise and relatively clear
cut. But I think this redaction essentially conveys the main business
of the sonnets.

From the outset of any reading of the sonnets there is an inevitable
and natural tendency to link the Fair Youth with the dedicatee, Mr WH,
the &quot;only begetter&quot;. Many candidates have been suggested over the
years but the academic consensus focuses mainly on two: the Earl of
Southampton and the Earl of Pembroke. The arguments for both are
strong; there is a biographical Shakespearean connection with each man
and the dates fit (though Southampton is older than Pembroke).

The Southampton case, however, requires a fair bit of casuistry to
hold securely as the Earl of Southampton's real name was Henry
Wriothesley, which, one would have thought, would make him &quot;Mr HW&quot;.
But no, the Southamptonians argue, Shakespeare was trying to disguise
the real identity of the dedicatee, and so swapped the initials round.
This might just be acceptable if the Pembrokians didn't hold the ace
in their hand. Pembroke's real name is William Herbert, so no
initial-juggling is required.

The other fact that favours William Herbert is that it makes the
composition of the sonnets occur later in Shakespeare's life. The
Shakespeare-Pembroke connection means that Shakespeare was in his 30s
and 40s when the sonnets were written - a middle-aged man by
17th-century standards - approximately twice Mr WH's age. Again,
evidence in the sonnets makes the poet seem substantially older than
the Fair Youth (&quot;My glass shall not persuade me I am old&quot;). If it was
Southampton then he and the poet would be coevals, young men
together - it just doesn't work or read as plausibly.

Certainly, identifying the Fair Youth as William Herbert is
dramatically more satisfying. The date range of the drama then becomes
roughly 1596-1604. It places Shakespeare at the height of his
reputation (Hamlet was written in 1600); he is making serious money
from his share in the Globe and his disastrous marriage to Anne
Hathaway is long over in all but name. Enter William Herbert: &quot;A
woman's face with nature's own hand painted/ Hast thou, the master
mistress of my passion.&quot; Dramatic licence aside, I feel that all the
evidence, scholarly and historically, points to William Herbert, the
Earl of Pembroke, as Mr WH.

So who was the Dark Lady? Here, the arguments enter pure speculation.
The most favoured candidates are aristocratic women such as Mary
Fitton or Emilia Lanier (the latter famously championed by the
historian AL Rowse: &quot;I have found her!&quot;) but Rowse and others fail to
see that such conjectures ignore the irrefutable class differences; a
mere gentleman like Shakespeare, socially well below the salt, could
never have had a sexual relationship, of the sort described in the
Dark Lady sonnets, with an aristocratic woman.

Indeed, the more one reads the Dark Lady sonnets the more one sees the
lust-driven nature of the relationship and the concomitant
self-loathing on the part of the poet as the key to her identity. I
take the title of the film from sonnet 129: &quot;Th' expense of spirit in
a waste of shame/ is lust in action ... &quot;, one of the more embittered
and unceasingly reproachful poems. To be honest, no one will ever know
who the Dark Lady was and perhaps, as some scholars have suggested,
she should be regarded as a deliberate inverse of the idealised
Petrarchan love object - a pointedly anti-romantic stereotype.
However, this will not do for a film, and my own reading of the
sonnets leads me in another direction.

Shakespeare's working life was in Southwark, south of the river, and
London Bridge, a noisome, rank and dangerous district, freer of the
City of London's legal edicts by virtue of its location, and home to
its theatres, pleasure gardens, bear-fighting pits, innumerable
taverns and brothels. Historical records establish that there were
black and mulatto prostitutes in Southwark brothels at the time, and
it seems highly feasible that the Dark Lady might have been such a
working girl.

Certainly, such an identification makes immediate sense of the
sonnets' rage and misogyny. It also rather neatly explains how Mr WH
and the Dark Lady could have met - and why the poet was powerless to
intercede in or prevent their union as it was overtly and strictly
commercial. Moreover, one of Shakespeare's known associates was a
brothel-keeper called George Wilkins, a violent man, arraigned on at
least two occasions for savagely beating up prostitutes (one of them
pregnant). I cannot prove that Shakespeare was a brothel visitor but
the numerous documented connections between Shakespeare and Wilkins
attest to the fact that he would have been no stranger to Wilkins's
rebarbative and sordid world. All that I require, as a screenwriter,
is circumstantial evidence - and this circumstantial evidence,
conjoined with the tone and deeply troubled spirit of the Dark Lady
sonnets (not to mention the allusion to the pox and its cure at the
sequence's end) makes a convincing case that the &quot;woman coloured ill&quot;
of sonnet 144 could have been a prostitute who worked in a Southwark
brothel. Read the poems - it makes very valid sense.

And so our characters assemble: William Shakespeare, middle-aged,
successful, famous, very unhappily married, sexually stirred and
enthralled by William Herbert, the talented and epicenely handsome son
of the Earl of Pembroke. But love - or lust - was requited not with
the &quot;lovely boy&quot; but with Shakespeare's &quot;black beauty&quot;, a prostitute
available for anyone in Southwark with a shilling to spare. These
identifications are, though inevitably conjectural, highly plausible
all the same, and can be stringently defended from the scant evidence
that exists. And this starting point is all the licence the
imagination requires in the making up of a story that unites these
three people in a disturbingly passionate and fraught love triangle.

But, overarching all this speculation, the sonnets stand themselves,
irreproachable and magnificent. It is, in a way, quite extraordinary
that we should have this sequence of intensely intimate poems from
Shakespeare to set beside the great masterpieces of the plays. Park
Honan, in his biography, remarks that Shakespeare's &quot;curiosity about
human nature was in a sense remorseless, though it never outran his
sympathy for the human predicament.&quot; This seems very true about the
plays but it applies equally to the sonnets, I feel, though perhaps in
a slightly different sense. We have no real, absolutely verifiable
grounds for thinking so, but all the same I believe it is impossible
to read Shakespeare's sonnets without concluding that in this case the
particular human predicament that he is so remorselessly curious about
and so sympathetic to is, in fact, his own.
