Greetings, I'm curious about the RS1 set up with a bulk fermion, such
as the Grossman-Neubert model for neutrino mass (hep-ph/9912408). In
short, my question is what sets the parity of the bulk fermion under
the Z^2 orbifold symmetry (phi -> -phi).

My understanding is that in models where there is a bulk gauge field
that couples to a bulk fermion, there is a "chirality problem" because
there is an interacton with the 5th component of the gauge field
proportional to the 5th gamma matrix. Thus when one decomposes the
field and looks at the 4D zero mode, one cannot have a chiral theory.
One solution is to orbifold the extra dimension, where one can choose
left and right handed spinors to transform with different signs and
the 4-vector and scalar parts of the gauge fields to transform with
different signs. This ends up forcing the offending term to vanish

However, in the Grossman-Neubert model there is a bulk fermion field
with no bulk gauge fields. They include a bulk dirac mass term of the
form "m sign(phi) psi-bar psi" (equation 2.1 of the paper). They claim
that the sign(phi) Â is necessary to conserve phi-parity under the
orbifold symmetry. However, I do not see why one cannot just posit
that psi and psi-bar (or alternately left and right handed spinors)
both transform with phi-parity +1 rather than having opposite signs?

Any thoughst on this would be greatly appreciated,
Best,
Flip

Hi Flip,

You don't need bulk gauge fields to have a chirality problem. It's
completely generic that if you don't have singularities, you can't get
4D chiral fermions from extra dimensions. Once you orbifold the circle
to an interval, you are forced to pick opposite boundary conditions
for the left- and right-handed parts of your spinor. This is because
they are coupled by the kinetic term: your Lagrangian contains
something like psi d/dy chi, and d/dy is obviously odd. (Here psi and
chi are the two 4D Weyl spinors in the 5D spinor, y is the fifth
coordinate.) So one of psi and chi is odd, the other even. The mass
term also couples psi and chi, which tells you the bulk mass is odd
under the orbifolding, hence the strange-looking sign(phi).

Best,

Matt
