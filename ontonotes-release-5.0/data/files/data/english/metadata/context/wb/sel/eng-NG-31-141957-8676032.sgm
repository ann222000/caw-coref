Cheryl Merrill has slandered, smeared, and written lies about
coworkers, places she worked, former bosses, people, even her dad and
mom. Alot of her wrttings about her sick twisted lies she wrote.

Ed Magedson is eventually going to get his ass sued off the planet. He
already lost $1m. Cheryl Merrill is going to get her ass sued as well.
I can see the hundreds of people she slandered on ROR (RIPOFREPORT)
lining up to sue Cheryl Merrill.

Anyone as sick as she is should go to prison for the amount of damages
she caused. Cheryl Merrill is mentally insane. Just read her insane
blogs.

Ed Magedson is a wanted man:

Investigation of My Rip-Off Reports
I really don't understand why it's relevant to anyone other than those
I've complained about that I've posted several complaints on Rip-Off
Report. My complaints are valid and covered by the First Amendment. I
am being &quot;outed&quot; on a blog for my numerous complaints. I've made 25
complaints over the years.

(This is from Cheryl Merrills own blog:)

Is RipOff Report's Ed Magedson an Extortionist?
I've been endorsing RipOffReport.com for a while now. I believed the
intent of its owner, Ed Magedson was genuine. Turns out I was totally
wrong. I've been digging around the Internet researching on a few
things about Magedson and came up with a strong sense that the guy is
operating an extortion criminal enterprise.

There's evidence Magedson extorts money from companies to clean up
their image on his site. He has also been accused of writing
complaints himself in order to get certain companies to pay him money
to clean up the information. Magedson also encourages people to file
complaints by claiming he may be able to get their money back from the
company.

There's a rather long article in the Phoenix New Times about Magedson
that spells out the nature of his enterprise. There's also a site
dedicated to the lawsuits and background of Magedson as well.

It's a pretty slick criminal operation. Imagine putting up a web site
about someone to damage their reputations, getting a lot of people to
complain about them to build a case their business is a rip-off. Then,
you charge them $30,000 to remove the info. That's extortion, plain
and simple. It's really kinda one big extortionist ring enabling the
little guy to have a voice and maybe get in on a refund if Magedson's
extortion deal comes through. Had I understood the nature of this
business enterprise, I wouldn't have submitted any complaints there.

One day Magedson is going to go to prison for it under the RICO Act
among other things. He's hurting a lot of companies reputations in
order to get them to pay him $30K a shot and then sets them up on this
$1,500/mo clean up information scam. So much for altruism.
