I started out playing Might and Magic and Wizardy lo many years ago,
where you made a party of 6 adventurers. It seems this genre is dead.
All RPGs today have you making a single character and off you go. Can
anyone recommend a decent adventure RPG where you make a party?

Have you played Baldur's Gate 1 &amp; 2, Icewind Dale or Planescape:Torment?
They're oldies but goodies. If you haven't, you owe it to yourself to
try at least some of them.

I know what you mean.  I started back in the days of the Commodore 64 with
the old Ultima and Bard's Tale series and through the 80s it was all party
based adventuring.

But... I think game companies are doing things as they are now because it
gives them more control in balancing out the game and ensuring there is a
challenge to the game, whether its a single player game or a game where your
character roams around and recruits average or below average party members
you meet in your exploration.

So its something I've adapted to over the years.  I suppose I'd rather have
a game thats entertaining up to the end rather than having the perfect party
that can pretty much steamroll over any challenge posed.

I dunno if that's strictly true. Most of the console RPGs I've been
playing are party-based, and the gamers that like them are snapping them
up. On the other hand, those characters are generally prerolled rather
than created by the player, so obviously most of those games wouldn't fit
the 'make a party' requirement. Given the cost of development, I imagine
that a single controllable character makes for easier playtesting too.

If you are willing to really go back.. there are some decent Ultima games
too.  Ultima 4 &amp; 5 are considered classics, but look very bad these days.
But Ultima 7 and Ultima 7 part II are great classics and the EXULT
emulator really makes them look great.  They were games that were ahead
of the times, graphically, when they were new.  Obviously dated now, but
still, not too shabby.

Anachronox is fun. It's a Japanese style RPG on the PC, and is sci-fi. The
story is inventive and the writing is hilarious. Lamentably, the combat is
rather easy (and a bit boring) so crank it up to &quot;Way too hard.&quot;

The most recent party based PC RPG is Neverwinter Nights 2, but I found that to
be lackluster (and they're constantly patching it!) You just spend too much
game time before you have any real choices of NPCs for padding out your party.

If you haven't played The Temple of Elemental Evil, I loved that one, but it's
got some nasty bugs, so make sure to patch it. There's a mod pack for it by a
group called The Circle of Eight that I haven't tried:

http://www.co8.org/forum/showthread.php?t=1819

Good luck.

It was either that one of one of the last M&amp;M games that I gave up on
because of that.  The combats took forever and while fun at first got
tedious when all I was fricking trying to do was run back somewhere to

The Temple of Elemental Evil. If you can tolerate the bugs (which are
numerous even post-patch, including fan patches) it's a fun dungeon
crawl. The Bethesda-loving feebs here didn't like it much, but YMMV.

Another widely-loathed party-based game which is actually worth a
run-through is Pools of Radiance: Ruins of Myth Drannor. It is
inarguably horrible yet still more fun than Morrowind.

&gt;&gt;The original PoR is one of the best CRPGs ever.  PoR:RoMD is a crime
&gt;&gt;against humanity.

I agree wholeheartedly.  But the idea that PoR:RoMD is better than
Morrowind is laughable.  That's what my &quot;troll&quot; comment earlier
in this thread was regarding.  But hey, opinions == assholes and all
that.

&gt;&gt;&gt; The Temple of Elemental Evil. If you can tolerate the bugs (which are
&gt;&gt;&gt; numerous even post-patch, including fan patches) it's a fun dungeon
&gt;&gt;&gt; crawl. The Bethesda-loving feebs here didn't like it much, but YMMV.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Another widely-loathed party-based game which is actually worth a
&gt;&gt;&gt; run-through is Pools of Radiance: Ruins of Myth Drannor. It is
&gt;&gt;&gt; inarguably horrible yet still more fun than Morrowind.

&gt;&gt;Troll

&gt;Well you better toss flaming oil on it quick then, or it'll probably
&gt;regenerate when you aren't looking ... 8&gt;.

&gt;Actually the original PoR was probably a better game than the RoMD
&gt;version. I still remember the room with the three(?) damn trolls in ..

Pool of Radiance? Man, I played that on the Amiga back in 1990 or so.
