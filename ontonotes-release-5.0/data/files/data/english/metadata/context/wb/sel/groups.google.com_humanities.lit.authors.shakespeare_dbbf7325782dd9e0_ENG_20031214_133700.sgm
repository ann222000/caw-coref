Scene XIII

Faust. Was this the face that launched a thousand ships
And burnt the topless 2 towers of Ilium?
Sweet Helen, make me immortal with a kiss. [Kisses her.]
Her lips suck forth my soul; see where it flies!-
Come, Helen, come, give me my soul again.
Here will I dwell, for Heaven is in these lips,
And all is dross that is not Helena. Enter OLD MAN.
I will be Paris, and for love of thee,
Instead of Troy, shall Wittenberg be sack'd;
And I will combat with weak Menelaus,
And wear thy colours on my plumed crest;
Yea, I will wound Achilles in the heel,
And then return to Helen for a kiss.

Preface to Fables, Ancient and Modern

John Dryden (1700)

The very heroes shew their authors: Achilles is hot, impatient, revengeful,
Impiger, iracundus, inexorabilis, acer, 8 &amp;c.; Æneas patient, considerate,
careful of his people, and merciful to his enemies; ever submissive to the
will of Heaven
-----------------------------------------------------
Of Friendship

Michel Eyquem de Montaigne

And therefore doe they preferre the beloved, and verifie that the gods
likewise preferre the same: and greatly blame the Poet Æschylus, who in the
love betweene Achilles and Patroclus ascribeth the lovers part unto
Achilles, who was in the first and beardlesse youth of his adolescency, and
the fairest of the Græcians.

XXIII. Our Friend the Major

Every minute incident of his last meeting with Amelia was present to the
constant man's mind as he walked towards her house. The arch and the
Achilles statue were up since he had last been in Piccadilly; a hundred
changes had occurred which his eye and mind vaguely noted

XXIV. The Old Piano

There are some splendid tailors' shops in the High Street of Southampton,
in the fine plate-glass windows of which hang gorgeous waistcoats of all
sorts, of silk and velvet, and gold and crimson, and pictures of the last
new fashions in which those wonderful gentlemen with quizzing glasses, and
holding on to little boys with the exceeding large eyes and curly hair, ogle
ladies in riding habits prancing by the Statue of Achilles at Apsley House.

SILVIO: What 's that Bosola? 48

DELIO: I knew him in Padua,-a fantastical scholar, like such who study to
know how many knots was in Hercules' club, of what colour Achilles' beard
was, or whether Hector were not troubled with the tooth-ache. He hath
studied himself half blear-eyed to know the true symmetry of Cæsar's nose by
a shoeing-horn; and this he did to gain the name of a speculative man.

Henry Fielding. (1707-1754). The History of Tom Jones.

Thus, not all the charms of the incomparable Sophia; not all the dazzling
brightness, and languishing softness of her eyes; the harmony of her voice,
and of her person; not all her wit, good-humour, greatness of mind, or
sweetness of disposition, had been able so absolutely to conquer and enslave
the heart of poor Jones, as this little incident of the muff. Thus the poet
sweetly sings of Troy- -Captique dolis lachrymisque coacti
Quos neque Tydides, nec Larissæus Achilles,
Non anni domucre decem, non mille Carina.

What Diomede or Thetis' greater son,
A thousand ships, nor ten years' siege had done,
False tears and fawning words the city won.

The citadel of Jones was now taken by surprise. All those considerations
of honour and prudence which our heroe had lately with so much military
wisdom placed as guards over the avenues of his heart, ran away from their
posts, and the god of love marched in, in triumph.

Inferno [Hell] Canto XXXI

ARGUMENT.-The Poets, following the sound of a loud horn, are led by it to
the ninth circle, in which there are four rounds, one enclosed within the
other, and containing as many sorts of traitors; but the present Canto shows
only that the circle is encompassed with Giants, one of whom. Antæus, takes
them both in his arms and places them at the bottom of the circle.

THE VERY tongue, whose keen reproof before
Had wounded me, that either cheek was stain'd,
Now minister'd my cure. So have I heard,
Achilles' and his father's javelin caused
Pain first, and then the boon of health restored.
Turning our back upon the vale of woe,
We cross'd the encircled mound in silence.

Then follows Cleopatra, lustful queen.&quot;
There mark'd I Helen, for whose sake so long
The time was fraught with evil; there the great
Achilles, who with love fought to the end.

He in the midst, that on his breast looks down,
Is the great Chiron who Achilles nursed;
That other, Pholus, prone to wrath.&quot; Around
The foss these go by thousands, aiming shafts
At whatsoever spirit dares emerge

Book XI

'Thus we twain stood sorrowing, holding sad discourse, while the big tears
fell fast: and therewithal came the soul of Achilles, son of Peleus, and of
Patroclus and of noble Antilochus and of Aias, who in face and form was
goodliest of all the Danaans, after the noble son of Peleus. And the spirit
of the son of Aeacus, fleet of foot, knew me again, and making lament spake
to me winged words:

'&quot;Son of Laertes, of the seed of Zeus, Odysseus of many devices, man
overbold, what new deed and hardier than this wilt thou devise in thy heart?
How durst thou come down to the house of Hades, where dwell the senseless
dead, the phantoms of men outworn?&quot;

&quot;So he spake, but I answered him: &quot;Achilles, son of Peleus, mightiest far
of the Achaeans, I am come hither to seek to Teiresias, if he may tell me
any counsel, how I may come to rugged Ithaca. For not yet have I come nigh
the Achaean land, nor set foot on mine own soil, but am still in evil case;
while as for thee, Achilles, none other than thou wast heretofore the most
blessed of men, nor shall any be hereafter. For of old, in the days of thy
life, we Argives gave thee one honour with the gods, and now thou art a
great prince here among the dead. Wherefore let not thy death be any grief
to thee, Achilles.&quot;

'Even so I spake, and he straightway answered me, and said: &quot;Nay, speak
not comfortably to me of death, oh great Odysseus. Rather would I live on
ground as the hireling of another, with a landless man who had no great
livelihood, than bear sway among all the dead that be departed. But come,
tell me tidings of that lordly son of mine-did he follow to the war to be a
leader or not? And tell me of noble Peleus, if thou hast heard aught,-is he
yet held in worship among the Myrmidons, or do they dishonour him from
Hellas to Phthia, for that old age binds him hand and foot? For I am no
longer his champion under the sun, so mighty a man as once I was, when in
wide Troy I slew the best of the host, and succoured the Argives. Ah! could
I but come for an hour to my father's house as then I was, so would I make
my might and hands invincible, to be hateful to many an one of those who do
him despite and keep him from his honour.&quot;

'Even so he spake, but I answered him, saying: &quot;As for noble Peleus,
verily I have heard nought of him; but concerning thy dear son Neoptolemus,
I will tell thee all the truth, according to thy word. It was I that led him
up out of Scyros in my good hollow ship, in the wake of the goodly-greaved
Achaeans. Now oft as we took counsel around Troy town, he was ever the first
to speak, and no word missed the mark; the godlike Nestor and I alone
surpassed him. But whensoever we Achaeans did battle on the plain of Troy,
he never tarried behind in the throng or the press of men, but ran out far
before us all, yielding to none in that might of his. And many men he slew
in warfare dread; but I could not tell of all or name their names, even all
the host he slew in succouring the Argives; but, ah, how he smote with the
sword that son of Telephus, the hero Eurypylus, and many Ceteians of his
company were slain around him, by reason of a woman's bribe. He truly was
the comeliest man that ever I saw, next to goodly Memnon. And again when we,
the best of the Argives, were about to go down into the horse which Epeus
wrought, and the charge of all was laid on me, both to open the door of our
good ambush and to shut the same, then did the other princes and counsellors
of the Danaans wipe away the tears, and the limbs of each one trembled
beneath him, but never once did I see thy son's fair face wax pale, nor did
he wipe the tears from his cheeks: but he besought me often to let him go
forth from the horse, and kept handling his sword-hilt, and his heavy
bronze-shod spear, and he was set on mischief against the Trojans. But after
we had sacked the steep city of Priam, he embarked unscathed with his share
of the spoil, and with a noble prize; he was not smitten with the sharp
spear, and got no wound in close fight: and many such chances there be in
war, for Ares rageth confusedly.&quot;
'So I spake, and the spirit of the son of Aeacus, fleet of foot, passed
with great strides along the mead of asphodel, rejoicing in that I had told
him of his son's renown.

Book XXIV

NOW Cyllenian Hermes called forth from the halls the souls of the wooers,
and he held in his hand his wand that is fair and golden, wherewith he lulls
the eyes of men, of whomso he will, while others again he even wakens out of
sleep. Herewith he roused and led the souls who followed gibbering. And even
as bats flit gibbering in the secret place of a wondrous cave, when one has
fallen down from the cluster on the rock, where they cling each up aloft,
even so the souls gibbered as they fared together, and Hermes, the helper,
led them down the dank ways. Past the streams of Oceanus and the White Rock,
past the gates of the Sun they sped and the land of dreams, and soon they
came to the mead of asphodel, where dwell the souls, the phantoms of men
outworn. There they found the soul of Achilles, son of Peleus, and the souls
of Patroclus, and of noble Antilochus, and of Aias, who in face and form was
goodliest of all the Danaans after the noble son of Peleus.
So these were flocking round Achilles, and the spirit of Agamemnon, son of
Atreus, drew nigh sorrowful; and about him were gathered all the other
shades, as many as perished with him in the house of Aegisthus, and met
their doom. Now the soul of the son of Peleus spake to him first, saying:
'Son of Atreus, verily we deemed that thou above all other heroes wast
evermore dear to Zeus, whose joy is in the thunder, seeing that thou wast
lord over warriors, many and mighty men, in the land of the Trojans where we
Achaeans suffered affliction. But lo, thee too was deadly doom to visit
early, the doom that none avoids of all men born. Ah, would that in the
fullness of thy princely honour, thou hadst met death and fate in the land
of the Trojans! So would all the Achaean host have builded thee a barrow,
yea and for thy son thou wouldst have won great glory in the aftertime. But
now it has been decreed for thee to perish by a most pitiful death.'
Then the soul of the son of Atreus answered, and spake: 'Happy art thou
son of Peleus, godlike Achilles, that didst die in Troy-land far from Argos,
and about thee fell others, the best of the sons of Trojans and Achaeans,
fighting for thy body; but thou in the whirl of dust layest mighty and
mightily fallen, forgetful of thy chivalry. And we strove the livelong day,
nor would we ever have ceased from the fight, if Zeus had not stayed us with
a tempest. Anon when we had borne thee to the ships from out of the battle,
we laid thee on a bier and washed thy fair flesh clean with warm water and
unguents, and around thee the Danaans shed many a hot tear and shore their
hair. And forth from the sea came thy mother with the deathless maidens of
the waters, when they heard the tidings; and a wonderful wailing rose over
the deep, and trembling fell on the limbs of all the Achaeans. Yea, and they
would have sprung up and departed to the hollow ships, had not one held them
back that knew much lore from of old, Nestor, whose counsel proved
heretofore the best. Out of his good-will he made harangue, and spake among
them:

'&quot;Hold, ye Argives, flee not, young lords of the Achaeans. Lo, his mother
from the sea is she that comes, with the deathless maidens of the waters, to
behold the face of her dead son.&quot;
'So he spake, and the high-hearted Achaeans ceased from their flight. Then
round thee stood the daughters of the ancient one of the sea, holding a
pitiful lament, and they clad thee about in raiment incorruptible. And all
the nine Muses one to the other replying with sweet voices began the dirge;
there thou wouldest not have seen an Argive but wept, so mightily rose up
the clear chant. Thus for seventeen days and nights continually did we all
bewail thee, immortal gods and mortal men. On the eighteenth day we gave thy
body to the flames, and many well-fatted sheep we slew around thee, and kine
of shambling gait. So thou wert burned in the garments of the gods, and in
much unguents and in sweet honey, and many heroes of the Achaeans moved
mail-clad around the pyre when thou wast burning, both footmen and horse,
and great was the noise that arose. But when the flame of Hephaestus had
utterly abolished thee, lo, in the morning we gathered together thy white
bones, Achilles, and bestowed them in unmixed wine and in unguents. Thy
mother gave a two-handled golden urn, and said that it was the gift of
Dionysus, and the workmanship of renowned Hephaestus. Therein lie thy white
bones, great Achilles, and mingled therewith the bones of Patroclus, son of
Menoetias, that is dead, but apart is the dust of Antilochus, whom thou
didst honour above all thy other companions, after Patroclus that was dead.
Then over them did we pile a great and goodly tomb, we the holy host of
Argive warriors, high on a jutting headland over wide Hellespont, that it
might be far seen from off the sea by men that now are, and by those that
shall be hereafter. Then thy mother asked the gods for glorious prizes in
the games, and set them in the midst of the lists for the champions of the
Achaeans. In days past thou hast been at the funeral games of many a hero,
whenso, after some king's death, the young men gird themselves and make them
ready for the meed of victory, but couldst thou have seen these gifts thou
wouldst most have marvelled in spirit, such glorious prizes did the goddess
set there to honour thee, even Thetis, the silver-footed; for very dear wert
thou to the gods. Thus not even in death hast thou lost thy name, but to
thee shall be a fair renown for ever among all men, Achilles. But what joy
have I now herein, that I have wound up the clew of war, for on my return
Zeus devised for me an evil end at the hands of Aegisthus and my wife
accursed?'

XVIII. How Princes Should Keep Faith

EVERY one understands how praiseworthy it is in a Prince to keep faith,
and to live uprightly and not craftily. Nevertheless, we see from what has
taken place in our own days that Princes who have set little store by their
word, but have known how to overreach men by their cunning, have
accomplished great thing, and in the end got the better of those who trusted
to honest dealing.
Be it known, then, that there are two ways of contending, one in
accordance with the laws, the other by force; the first of which is proper
to men, the second to beasts. But since the first method is often
ineffectual, it becomes necessary to resort to the second. A Prince should,
therefore, understand how to use well both the man and the beast. And this
lesson has been covertly taught by the ancient writers, who relate how
Achilles and many others of these old Princes were given over to be brought
up and trained by Chiron the Centaur; since the only meaning of their having
for instructor one who was half man and half beast is, that it is necessary
for a Prince to know how to use both natures, and that the one without the
other has no stability.
But since a Prince should know how to use the beast's nature wisely, he
ought of beasts to choose both the lion and the fox; for the lion cannot
guard himself from the toils, nor the fox from wolves. He must therefore be
a fox to discern toils, and a lion to drive off wolves.
To rely wholly on the lion is unwise; and for this reason a prudent Prince
neither can nor ought to keep his word when to keep it is hurtful to him and
the causes which led him to pledge it are removed. If all men were good,
this would not be good advice, but since they are dishonest and do not keep
faith with you, you in return, need not keep faith with them; and no prince
was ever at a loss for plausible reasons to cloak a breach of faith. Of this
numberless recent instances could be given, and it might be shown how many
solemn treaties and engagements have been rendered inoperative and idle
through want of faith in Princes, and that he who was best known to play the
fox has had the best success.
It is necessary, indeed, to put a good colour on this nature, and to be
skilful in simulating and dissembling. But men are so simple, and governed
so absolutely by their present needs, that he who wishes to deceive will
never fail in finding willing dupes. One recent example I will not omit.
Pope Alexander VI had no care or thought but how to deceive, and always
found material to work on. No man ever had a more effective manner of
asseverating, or made promises with more solemn protestations, or observed
them less. And yet, because he understood this side of human nature, his
frauds always succeeded. 5
It is not essential, then, that a Prince should have all the good
qualities which I have enumerated above, but it is most essential that he
should seem to have them; I will even venture to affirm that if he has and
invariably practises them all, they are hurtful, whereas the appearance of
having them is useful. Thus, it is well to seem merciful, faithful, humane,
religious, and upright, and also to be so; but the mind should remain so
balanced that were it needful not to be so, you should be able and know how
to change to the contrary.
And you are to understand that a Prince, and most of all a new Prince,
cannot observe all those rules of conduct in respect whereof men are
accounted good, being often forced, in order to preserve his Princedom, to
act in opposition to good faith, charity, humanity, and religion. He must
therefore keep his mind ready to shift as the winds and tides of Fortune
turn, and, as I have already said, he ought not to quit good courses if he
can help it, but should know how to follow evil courses if he must.
A Prince should therefore be very careful that nothing ever escapes his
lips which is not replete with the five qualities above named, so that to
see and hear him, one would think him the embodiment of mercy, good faith,
integrity, humanity, and religion. And there is no virtue which it is more
necessary for him to seem to possess than this last; because men in general
judge rather by the eye than by the hand, for every one can see but few can
touch. Every one sees what you seem, but few know what you are, and these
few dare not oppose themselves to the opinion of the many who have the
majesty of the State to back them up.
Moreover, in the actions of all men, and most of all of Princes, where
there is no tribunal to which we can appeal, we look to results. Wherefore
if a Prince succeeds in establishing and maintaining his authority, the
means will always be judged honourable and be approved by every one. For the
vulgar are always taken by appearances and by results, and the world is made
up of the vulgar, the few only finding room when the many have no longer
ground to stand on.
A certain Prince of our own days, whose name it is as well not to mention,
is always preaching peace and good faith, although the mortal enemy of both;
and both, had he practised them as he preaches them, would, oftener than
once, have lost him his kingdom and authority.

JOHN DRYDEN Dedication
To the Most Honorable John, Lord Marquis of Normandy, Earl of Mulgrave,
&amp;c. and Knight of the Most Noble Order of the Garter

A HEROIC poem, truly such, is undoubtedly the greatest work which the soul
of man is capable to perform. The design of it is to form the mind to heroic
virtue by example. 'Tis convey'd in verse, that it may delight, while it
instructs: the action of it is always one, entire, and great. The least and
most trivial episodes, or underactions, which are interwoven in it, are
parts either necessary or convenient to carry on the main design; either so
necessary, that, without them, the poem must be imperfect, or so convenient,
that no others can be imagin'd more suitable to the place in which they are.
There is nothing to be left void in a firm building; even the cavities ought
not to be fill'd with rubbish, (which is of a perishable kind, destructive
to the strength,) but with brick or stone, tho' of less pieces, yet of the
same nature, and fitted to the crannies. Even the least portions of them
must be of the epic kind: all things must be grave, majestical, and sublime;
nothing of a foreign nature, like the trifling novels which Ariosto and
others have inserted in their poems; by which the reader is misled into
another sort of pleasure, opposite to that which is design'd in an epic
poem. One raises the soul, and hardens it to virtue; the other softens it
again, and unbends it into vice. One conduces to the poet's aim, the
completing of his work, which he is driving on, laboring and hast'ning in
every line; the other slackens his pace, diverts him from his way, and locks
him up, like a knight-errant, in an enchanted castle, when he should be
pursuing his first adventure. Statius, as Bossu has well observ'd, was
ambitious of trying his strength with his master Virgil, as Virgil had
before tried his with Homer. The Grecian gave the two Romans an example, in
the games which were celebrated at the funerals of Patroclus. Virgil
imitated the invention of Homer, but chang'd the sports. But both the Greek
and Latin poet took their occasions from the subject; tho' to confess the
truth, they were both ornamental, or at best convenient parts of it, rather
than of necessity arising from it. Statius, who, thro' his whole poem, is
noted for want of conduct and judgment, instead of staying, as he might have
done, for the death of Capaneus, Hippomedon, Tydeus, or some other of his
seven champions, (who are heroes all alike), or more properly for the
tragical end of the two brothers, whose exequies the next successor had
leisure to perform when the siege was rais'd, and in the interval betwixt
the poet's first action and his second, went out of his way, as it were on
prepense malice, to commit a fault. For he took his opportunity to kill a
royal infant by the means of a serpent (that author of all evil), to make
way for those funeral honors which he intended for him. Now if this innocent
had been of any relation to his Thebais; if he had either farther'd or
hinder'd the taking of the town; the poet might have found some sorry excuse
at least, for detaining the reader from the promis'd siege. On these terms,
this Capaneus of a poet ingag'd his two immortal predecessors; and his
success was answerable to his enterprise.
If this economy must be observ'd in the minutest parts of an epic poem,
which, to a common reader, seem to be detach'd from the body, and almost
independent of it; what soul, tho' sent into the world with great advantages
of nature, cultivated with the liberal arts and sciences, conversant with
histories of the dead, and enrich'd with observations of the living, can be
sufficient to inform the whole body of so great a work? I touch here but
transiently, without any strict method, on some few of those many rules of
imitating nature which Aristotle drew from Homer's Iliads and Odysses, and
which he fitted to the drama; furnishing himself also with observations from
the practice of the theater when it flourish'd under Æschylus, Euripides,
and Sophocles: for the original of the stage was from the epic poem.
Narration, doubtless, preceded acting, and gave laws to it; what at first
was told artfully, was, in process of time, represented gracefully to the
sight and hearing. Those episodes of Homer which were proper for the stage,
the poets amplified each into an action; out of his limbs they form'd their
bodies; what he had contracted, they enlarg'd; out of one Hercules were made
infinite of pigmies, yet all endued with human souls; for from him, their
great creator, they have each of them the divinæ particulam auræ. They flow'
d from him at first, and are at last resolv'd into him. Nor were they only
animated by him, but their measure and symmetry was owing to him. His one,
entire, and great action was copied by them according to the proportions of
the drama. If he finish'd his orb within the year, if suffic'd to teach
them, that their action being less, and being also less diversified with
incidents, their orb, of consequence, must be circumscrib'd in a less
compass, which they reduc'd within the limits either of a natural or an
artificial day; so that, as he taught them to amplify what he had shorten'd,
by the same rule, applied the contrary way, he taught them to shorten what
he had amplified. Tragedy is the miniature of human life; an epic poem is
the draught at length. Here, my Lord, I must contract also; for, before I
was aware, I was almost running into a long digression, to prove that there
is no such absolute necessity that the time of a stage action should so
strictly be confin'd to twenty-four hours as never to exceed them, for which
Aristotle contends, and the Grecian stage has practic'd. Some longer space,
on some occasions, I think, may be allow'd, especially for the English
theater, which requires more variety of incidents than the French. Corneille
himself, after long practice, was inclin'd to think that the time allotted
by the ancients was too short to raise and finish a great action: and better
a mechanic rule were stretch'd or broken, than a great beauty were omitted.
To raise, and afterwards to calm the passions, to purge the souls from
pride, by the examples of human miseries, which befall the greatest; in few
words, to expel arrogance, and introduce compassion, are the great effects
of tragedy; great, I must confess, if they were altogether as true as they
are pompous. But are habits to be introduc'd at three hours' warning? Are
radical diseases so suddenly remov'd? A mountebank may promise such a cure,
but a skilful physician will not undertake it. An epic poem is not in so
much haste; it works leisurely; the changes which it makes are slow; but the
cure is likely to be more perfect. The effects of tragedy, as I said, are
too violent to be lasting. If it be answer'd that, for this reason,
tragedies are often to be seen, and the dose to be repeated, this is tacitly
to confess that there is more virtue in one heroic poem than in many
tragedies. A man is humbled one day, and his pride returns the next.
Chymical medicines are observ'd to relieve oft'ner than to cure; for 'tis
the nature of spirits to make swift impressions, but not deep. Galenical
decoctions, to which I may properly compare an epic poem, have more of body
in them; they work by their substance and their weight. It is one reason of
Aristotle's to prove that tragedy is the more noble, because it turns in a
shorter compass; the whole action being circumscrib'd within the space of
four-and-twenty hours. He might prove as well that a mushroom is to be
preferr'd before a peach, because it shoots up in the compass of a night. A
chariot may be driven round the pillar in less space than a large machine,
because the bulk is not so great. Is the Moon a more noble planet than
Saturn, because she makes her revolution in less than thirty days, and he in
little less than thirty years? Both their orbs are in proportion to their
several magnitudes; and consequently the quickness or slowness of their
motion, and the time of their circumvolutions, is no argument of the greater
or less perfection. And, besides, what virtue is there in a tragedy which is
not contain'd in an epic poem, where pride is humbled, virtue rewarded, and
vice punish'd; and those more amply treated than the narrowness of the drama
can admit? The shining quality of an epic hero, his magnanimity, his
constancy, his patience, his piety, or whatever characteristical virtue his
poet gives him, raises first our admiration. We are naturally prone to
imitate what we admire; and frequent acts produce a habit. If the hero's
chief quality be vicious, as, for example, the choler and obstinate desire
of vengeance in ACHILLES, yet the moral is instructive: and, besides, we are
inform'd in the very proposition of the Iliads that this anger was
pernicious; that it brought a thousand ills on the Grecian camp. The courage
of ACHILLES is propos'd to imitation, not his pride and disobedience to his
general, nor his brutal cruelty to his dead enemy, nor the selling his body
to his father. We abhor these actions while we read them; and what we abhor
we never imitate. The poet only shews them, like rocks or quicksands, to be
shunn'd.
By this example the critics have concluded that it is not necessary the
manners of the hero should be virtuous. They are poetically good, if they
are of a piece: tho', where a character of perfect virtue is set before us,
'tis more lovely; for there the whole hero is to be imitated. This is the
Æneas of our author; this is that idea of perfection in an epic poem which
painters and statuaries have only in their minds, and which no hands are
able to express. These are the beauties of a god in a human body. When the
picture of ACHILLES is drawn in tragedy, he is taken with those warts, and
moles, and hard features, by those who represent him on the stage, or he is
no more ACHILLES; for his creator, Homer, has so describ'd him. Yet even
thus he appears a perfect hero, tho' an imperfect character of virtue.
Horace paints him after Homer, and delivers him to be copied on the stage
with all those imperfections. Therefore, they are either not faults in a
heroic poem, or faults common to the drama. After all, on the whole merits
of the cause, it must be acknowledg'd that the epic poem is more for the
manners, and tragedy for the passions. The passions, as I have said, are
violent; and acute distempers require medicines of a strong and speedy
operation. Ill habits of the mind are like chronical diseases, to be
corrected by degrees, and cur'd by alteratives; wherein, tho' purges are
sometimes necessary, yet diet, good air, and moderate exercise have the
greatest part. The matter being thus stated, it will appear that both sorts
of poetry are of use for their proper ends. The stage is more active; the
epic poem works at greater leisure, yet is active too, when need requires;
for dialogue is imitated by the drama from the more active parts of it. One
puts off a fit, like the quinquina, and relieves us only for a time; the
other roots out the distemper, and gives a healthful habit. The sun
enlightens and cheers us, dispels fogs, and warms the ground with his daily
beams; but the corn is sow'd, increases, is ripen'd, and is reap'd for use
in process of time, and in its proper season. I proceed from the greatness
of the action to the dignity of the actors; I mean to the persons employ'd
in both poems. There likewise tragedy will be seen to borrow from the
epopee; and that which borrows is always of less dignity, because it has not
of its own. A subject, 'tis true, may lend to his sovereign; but the act of
borrowing makes the king inferior, because he wants, and the subject
supplies. And suppose the persons of the drama wholly fabulous, or of the
poet's invention, yet heroic poetry gave him the examples of that invention,
because it was first, and Homer the common father of the stage. I know not
of any one advantage which tragedy can boast above heroic poetry, but that
it is represented to the view, as well as read, and instructs in the closet,
as well as on the theater. This is an uncontended excellence, and a chief
branch of its prerogative; yet I may be allow'd to say, without partiality,
that herein the actors share the poet's praise. Your Lordship knows some
modern tragedies which are beautiful on the stage, and yet I am confident
you would not read them. Tryphon the stationer complains they are seldom ask
'd for in his shop. The poet who flourish'd in the scene is damn'd in the
ruelle; nay more, he is not esteem'd a good poet by those who see and hear
his extravagances with delight. They are a sort of stately fustian, and
lofty childishness. Nothing but nature can give a sincere pleasure; where
that is not imitated, 'tis grotesque painting; the fine woman ends in a fish
's tail.
I might also add that many things which not only please, but are real
beauties in the reading, would appear absurd upon the stage; and those not
only the speciosa miracula, as Horace calls them, of transformations, of
Scylla, Antiphates, and the Læstrygons, which cannot be represented even in
operas; but the prowess of ACHILLES or Æneas would appear ridiculous in our
dwarf heroes of the theater. We can believe they routed armies, in Homer or
in Virgil; but ne Hercules contra duos in the drama. I forbear to instance
in many things which the stage cannot, or ought not to represent; for I have
said already more than I intended on this subject, and should fear it might
be turn'd against me, that I plead for the preeminence of epic poetry
because I have taken some pains in translating Virgil, if this were the
first time that I had deliver'd my opinion in this dispute. But I have more
than once already maintain'd the rights of my two masters against their
rivals of the scene, even while I wrote tragedies myself, and had no
thoughts of this present undertaking. I submit my opinion to your judgment,
who are better qualified than any man I know to decide this controversy.

He takes notice that Virgil is arraign'd for placing piety before valor,
and making that piety the chief character of his hero. I have said already
from Bossu, that a poet is not oblig'd to make his hero a virtuous man;
therefore, neither Homer nor Tasso are to be blam'd for giving what
predominant quality they pleas'd to their first character. But Virgil, who
design'd to form a perfect prince, and would insinuate that Augustus, whom
he calls Æneas in his poem, was truly such, found himself oblig'd to make
him without blemish, thoroughly virtuous; and a thorough virtue both begins
and ends in piety. Tasso, without question, observ'd this before me, and
therefore split his hero in two; he gave Godfrey piety, and Rinaldo
fortitude, for their chief qualities or manners. Homer, who had chosen
another moral, makes both Agamemnon and ACHILLES vicious; for his design was
to instruct in virtue by shewing the deformity of vice. I avoid repetition
of that I have said above. . . .

I give not here my translation of these verses, (tho' I think I have not
ill succeeded in them,) because your Lordship is so great a master of the
original that I have no reason to desire you should see Virgil and me so
near together. But you may please, my Lord, to take notice that the Latin
author refines upon the Greek, and insinuates that Homer had done his hero
wrong in giving the advantage of the duel to his own countryman; tho'
Diomedes was manifestly the second champion of the Grecians; and Ulysses
preferr'd him before Ajax, when he chose him for the companion of his
nightly expedition; for he had a headpiece of his own, and wanted only the
fortitude of another to bring him off with safety, and that he might compass
his design with honor. 27
The French translator thus proceeds: &quot;They who accuse Æneas for want of
courage, either understand not Virgil, or have read him slightly; otherwise
they would not raise an objection so easy to be answer'd.&quot; Hereupon he gives
so many instances of the hero's valor, that to repeat them after him would
tire your Lordship, and put me to the unnecessary trouble of transcribing
the greatest part of the three last Æneids. In short, more could not be
expected from an Amadis, a Sir Lancelot, or the whole Round Table, than he
performs. Proxima quoeque metit gladio, is the perfect account of a
knight-errant. &quot;If it be replied,&quot; continues Segrais, &quot;that it was not
difficult for him to undertake and achieve such hardy enterprises, because
he wore enchanted arms; that accusation, in the first place, must fall on
Homer, ere it can reach Virgil.&quot; ACHILLES was as well provided with them as
Æneas, tho' he was invulnerable without them. And Ariosto, the two Tassos
(Bernardo and Torquato), even our own Spenser, in a word, all modern poets,
have copied Homer as well as Virgil: he is neither the first nor last, but
in the midst of them; and therefore is safe, if they are so. &quot;Who knows,&quot;
says Segrais, &quot;but that his fated armor was only an allegorical defense, and
signified no more than that he was under the peculiar protection of the
gods?-born, as the astrologers will tell us out of Virgil, (who was well
vers'd in the Chaldæan mysteries,) under the favorable influence of Jupiter,
Venus, and the Sun.&quot; But I insist not on this, because I know you believe
not in such an art; tho' not only Horace and Persius, but Augustus himself,
thought otherwise. But, in defense of Virgil, I dare positively say that he
has been more cautious in this particular than either his predecessor or his
descendants; for Æneas was actually wounded in the Twelfth of the Æneis, tho
' he had the same godsmith to forge his arms as had ACHILLES. It seems he
was no warluck, as the Scots commonly call such men, who, they say, are
iron-free, or lead-free. Yet, after this experiment that his arms were not
impenetrable, when he was cur'd indeed by his mother's help, because he was
that day to conclude the war by the death of Turnus, the poet durst not
carry the miracle too far, and restore him wholly to his former vigor; he
was still too weak to overtake his enemy; yet we see with what courage he
attacks Turnus, when he faces and renews the combat. I need say no more; for
Virgil defends himself without needing my assistance, and proves his hero
truly to deserve that name. He was not then a second-rate champion, as they
would have him who think fortitude the first virtue in a hero. But, being
beaten from this hold, they will not yet allow him to be valiant, because he
wept more often, as they think, than well becomes a man of courage. 28
In the first place, if tears are arguments of cowardice, what shall I say
of Homer's hero? Shall ACHILLES pass for timorous because he wept, and wept
on less occasions than Æneas? Herein Virgil must be granted to have excell'd
his master. For once both heroes are describ'd lamenting their lost loves:
Briseis was taken away by force from the Grecian; Creusa was lost for ever
to her husband. But ACHILLES went roaring along the salt sea-shore, and,
like a booby, was complaining to his mother, when he should have reveng'd
his injury by arms. Æneas took a nobler course; for, having secur'd his
father and his son, he repeated all his former dangers to have found his
wife, if she had been above ground. And here your Lordship may observe the
address of Virgil; it was not for nothing that this passage was related with
all these tender circumstances. Æneas told it; Dido heard it. That he had
been so affectionate a husband was no ill argument to the coming dowager
that he might prove as kind to her. Virgil has a thousand secret beauties,
tho' I have not leisure to remark them. 29
Segrais, on this subject of a hero's shedding tears, observes that
historians commend Alexander for weeping when he read the mighty actions of
ACHILLES; and Julius Cæsar is likewise prais'd, when, out of the same noble
envy, he wept at the victories of Alexander.
