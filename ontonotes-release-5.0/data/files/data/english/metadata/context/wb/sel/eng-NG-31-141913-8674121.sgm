Depicting Europe

By

Perry Anderson

An epiphany is beguiling Europe. Far from dwindling in historical
significance, the Old World is about to assume an importance for humanity it
has never, in all its days of dubious past glory, before possessed. At the
end of Postwar, his 800-page account of the continent since 1945, the
historian Tony Judt exclaims at Europes emergence in the dawn of the 21st
century as a paragon of the international virtues: a community of values . .
. held up by Europeans and non-Europeans alike as an exemplar for all to
emulate.1 The reputation, he assures us, is well-earned. The same vision
grips the seers of New Labour. Why Europe Will Run the 21st Century declaims
the title of a manifesto by Mark Leonard, the partys foreign policy
wunderkind.2 Imagine a world of peace, prosperity and democracy, he
enjoins the reader. What I am asking you to imagine is the New European
Century. How will this entrancing prospect come about? Europe represents
a synthesis of the energy and freedom that come from liberalism with the
stability and welfare that come from social democracy. As the world becomes
richer and moves beyond satisfying basic needs such as hunger and health,
the European way of life will become irresistible. Really? Absolutely. As
India, Brazil, South Africa and even China develop economically and express
themselves politically, the European model will represent an irresistibly
attractive way of enhancing their prosperity whilst protecting their
security. They will join with the EU in building a New European Century.

Not to be outdone, the futurologist Jeremy Rifkin  American by birth, but
by any standards an honorary European: indeed a personal adviser to Romano
Prodi when he was president of the European Commission  has offered his
guide to The European Dream.3 Seeking harmony, not hegemony, he tells us,
the EU has all the right markings to claim the moral high ground on the
journey towards a third stage of human consciousness. Europeans have laid
out a visionary road map to a new promised land, one dedicated to
reaffirming the life instinct and the Earths indivisibility. After a
lyrical survey of this route  typical staging-posts: Government without a
Centre, Romancing the Civil Society, A Second Enlightenment  Rifkin,
warning us against cynicism, concludes: These are tumultuous times. Much of
the world is going dark, leaving many human beings without clear direction.
The European Dream is a beacon of light in a troubled world. It beckons us
to a new age of inclusivity, diversity, quality of life, deep play,
sustainability, universal human rights, the rights of nature, and peace on
Earth.

These transports may seem peculiarly Anglo-Saxon, but there is no shortage
of more prosaic equivalents on the Continent. For Germanys leading
philosopher, J|rgen Habermas, Europe has found exemplary solutions for two
great issues of the age: governance beyond the nation-state and systems of
welfare that serve as a model to the world. So why not triumph in a third?
If Europe has solved two problems of this magnitude, shouldnt it issue a
further challenge: to defend and promote a cosmopolitan order on the basis
of international law  or, as his compatriot the sociologist Ulrich Beck
puts it, Europeanisation means creating a new politics. It means entering
as a player into the meta-power game, into the struggle to form the rules of
a new global order. The catchphrase for the future might be: Move over
America  Europe is back! In France, Marcel Gauchet, theorist of democracy
and an editor of Le Dibat, the countrys central journal of ideas, explains,
more demurely, that we may be allowed to think that the formula the
Europeans have pioneered is destined eventually to serve as a model for the
nations of the world. That lies in its genetic programme.

Self-satisfaction is scarcely unfamiliar in Europe. But the contemporary
mood is something different: an apparently illimitable narcissism, in which
the reflection in the water transfigures the future of the planet into the
image of the beholder. What explains this degree of political vanity?
Obviously, the landscape of the continent has altered in recent years, and
its role in the world has grown. Real changes can give rise to surreal
dreams, but they need to be calibrated properly, to see what the connections
or lack of them might be. A decade ago, three great imponderables lay ahead:
the advent of monetary union, as designed at Maastricht; the return of
Germany to regional preponderance, with reunification; and the expansion of
the EU into Eastern Europe. The outcome of each remained ex ante
indeterminate. How far have they been clarified since?

Of its nature, the introduction of a single currency, adopted simultaneously
by 11 out of 15 member states of the EU on the first day of 1999, was the
most punctual and systematic transformation of the three. It was always
reasonable to suppose its effects would be the soonest visible, and most
clear-cut. Yet this has proved so only in the most limited technical sense,
that the substitution of a dozen monies by one (Greece joined in 2002) was
handled extremely smoothly, without glitch or mishap: an administrative tour
de force. Otherwise, contrary to general expectations, the net upshot of the
monetary union that came into force in the Eurozone eight years ago remains
undecidable. The stated purpose of the single currency was to lower
transaction costs and increase predictability of returns for business, so
unleashing higher investment and faster growth of productivity and output.

But to date the causes have failed to generate the results. The dynamic
effects of the Single European Act of 1986, held by most orthodox economists
to be an initiative of greater significance than EMU, had already been
wildly oversold: the official Cecchini Report estimated it would add between
4.3 and 6.4 per cent to the GDP of the Community where in reality it yielded
gains of little over 1 per cent. So far, the pay-off for EMU has been even
more disappointing. Far from picking up, growth in the Eurozone initially
slowed down, from an average of 2.4 per cent in the five years before
monetary union, to 2.1 in the first five years after it. Even with the
modest acceleration of the last three years, it remains below the level of
the 1980s. In 2000, on the heels of the single currency, the Lisbon summit
promised to create within ten years the most competitive and dynamic
knowledge-based economy in the world. In the event, the EU has so far
recorded a growth rate well below that of the US, and has lagged far behind
China. Caught between the scientific and technological magnetism of America,
where two-fifths of all scientists  some 400,000  are now EU-born, and the
cheap labour of the PRC, where average wages are well over twenty times
lower, Europe has not had much to show for its bombast.

Not only has the performance of the single-currency bloc been well below
Americas. More pointedly, the Eurozone has been outstripped by those
countries within the EU which declined to scrap their own currencies,
Sweden, Britain and Denmark all posting higher rates of growth over the same
period. Casting a further shadow over the legacy of Maastricht, the
Stability Pact which was supposed to ensure that fiscal indiscipline at
national level would not undermine monetary rigour at supranational level
has been breached repeatedly and with impunity by both Germany and France,
the two leading economies of the Eurozone. Had its deflationary impact been
enforced, as it was on Portugal, which was in less of a position to resist,
overall growth would have been yet lower.

Still, it would be premature to think that any unequivocal verdict on
monetary union had been reached. The advocates of EMU point to Ireland and
Spain as success stories within the Eurozone, and look to the general
economic upturn of the past year, led by Germany, as a sign that monetary
union may at last be coming into its own. Above all, they can vaunt the
strength of the euro itself. Not only are long-term interest rates in the
Eurozone below those in the US. More strikingly, the euro has overtaken the
dollar as the worlds premier currency in the international bond market. One
result has been to power a wave of cross-border mergers and acquisitions in
Euroland itself, evidence of the kind of capital deepening the architects of
monetary union envisaged. Given the volatility of relative regional or
national standings in the world economy  Japans is only the most
spectacular reversal of fortune since the 1980s  might not the Eurozone,
after somewhat over seven lean years, now be poised for their biblical
opposite?

Here, clearly, much depends on the degree of European interconnection with,
or insulation from, the US economy, which dominates global demand. The
mediocrity of Eurozone performance since 1999, attributable in the eyes of
economic liberals to statist inertias and labour-market rigidities that it
has taken time to overcome, but that are now giving way, has unfolded
against the background of a global conjuncture, driven principally by
American consumption, which for the last five years has been highly
favourable  world economic growth averaging over 4.5 per cent, a rate not
seen since the 1960s. A large part of this boom has come from rocketing
house prices. That holds above all for the US, but also for much of the
OECD: not least such once peripheral economies as Spain and Ireland, where
construction has been the linchpin of recent growth. In the major Eurozone
economies, on the other hand, where mortgages are not so central to
financial markets, such effects have been more subdued. But, as the exposure
of European banks to the collapse of sub-prime markets in the US is
currently showing, the lines of repackaged credit are now so diffused and
entangled across financial markets that the Eurozone is unlikely to be
sheltered from a transatlantic recession.

The role of Germany in the new Europe remains no less ambiguous. Absorption
of the DDR has restored the country to its standing at the beginning of the
20th century as the strategically central land of the continent, the most
populous nation and the largest economy. But the longer-term consequences of
reunification have still to unfold. Internationally, the Berlin republic has
unquestionably become more assertive, shedding a range of postwar
inhibitions. In the past decade the Luftwaffe has returned to the Balkans,
Einsatztruppen are fighting in West Asia, the Deutsche Marine patrols the
Eastern Mediterranean. But these have been subcontracted enterprises, in
Nato or UN operations governed by the United States, not independent
initiatives. Diplomatic postures have been more significant than military.
Under Schrvder, close ties were developed with Russia, in an entente that
became the most distinctive feature of his foreign policy. But this was not
a second Rapallo Pact, at the expense of western neighbours. Under Chirac
and Berlusconi, France and Italy courted Putin scarcely less, but with fewer
economic trumps in hand. Within Europe itself, the Red-Green government in
Berlin, for all its well-advertised generational lack of complexes, never
rocked the boat in the way its Christian Democrat predecessor in Bonn had
done. Since 1991, in fact, there has been no action to compare with Kohls
unilateral recognition of Slovenia, precipitating the disintegration of
Yugoslavia. Merkel has moved successfully to circumvent the will of French
and Dutch voters, but was in no position to accomplish this on her own: for
that, governments in Paris and the Hague were necessary. The prospects of
any informal German hegemony in Europe, classically considered, seem at
present remote.

Part of the reason for the relatively subdued profile of the new Germany has
been the cost of reunification itself, for which the bill to date has come
to more than a trillion dollars, saddling the country for years with
stagnation, high unemployment and mounting public debt. France, though no
greyhound itself, consistently outpaced Germany, posting faster rates of
growth for a full decade from 1994 to 2004, with more than double its
increase in GDP in the first five years of the new century. In 2006,
substantial German recovery finally arrived, and the tables have been
turned. Currently the worlds leading exporter, Germany now looks as if it
might be about to exercise once again something like the economic dominance
of Europe it enjoyed in the days of Schmidt and the early Kohl. Then it was
the tight money policies of the Bundesbank that held its neighbours by the
throat. With the euro, that form of pressure has gone. What threatens to
replace it is the remarkable wage repression on which German recovery has
been based. Between 1998 and 2006, unit labour costs in Germany actually
fell  a staggering feat: real wages declined for seven straight years
while they rose some 15 per cent in France and Britain, and between 25 and
35 per cent in Spain, Italy, Portugal and Greece. With devaluation now
barred, the Mediterranean countries are suffering a drastic loss of
competitiveness that augurs ill for the whole southern tier of the EU.
Harsher forms of German power, pulsing through the market rather than
issuing from the high command or central bank, may lie in store. It is too
soon to write off a regional Grossmacht.

Germany has now been reunited for 16 years. A single currency has circulated
for eight years. The enlargement of the EU is just over three years old: it
would be strange if its outcomes were already clearer. In practice the
expansion of the EU to the East was set in motion in 1993, and completed
for the moment  only this year, with the accession of Romania and Bulgaria.
At one level it is plain why it should be perhaps the principal source of
satisfaction in todays chorus of European self-congratulation. All nine
former captive nations of the Soviet bloc have been integrated without a
hitch into the Union. Only the lands of a once independent Communism, in the
time of Tito and Hoxha, wait to join the fold, and even there a start has
been made with Slovenia. Capitalism has been restored smoothly and speedily,
without vexing delays or derogations. Indeed, as the director-general of the
EU Commission for Enlargement recently observed, Nowadays the level of
privatisation and liberalisation of the market is often higher in new member
states than old ones. In this newly freed zone, rates of growth have also
been considerably higher than in the larger economies to the west.

No less impressive has been the virtually frictionless implantation of
political systems matching liberal norms  representative democracies
complete with civil rights, elected parliaments, separation of powers,
alternation of governments. Under the benevolent but watchful eye of the
Commission, seeing to it that criteria laid down at the Copenhagen Summit of
1993 were properly met, Eastern Europe has been shepherded into the comity
of free nations. There was no backsliding. The elites of the region were in
most cases only too anxious to oblige. For their populations, constitutional
niceties were less important than higher standards of living once the late
Communist yoke was thrown off, although few if any citizens were indifferent
to the humbler liberties of speech, occupation or travel. When the time for
accession came, there was assent, but little enthusiasm. Only in two
countries out of ten  Lithuania and Slovenia  did a majority of the
electorate turn out to vote for it, in referenda which most of the
population elsewhere ignored, no doubt in part because they regarded it as a
fait accompli by their leaders.

Still, however technocratic or top-down the mechanics of enlargement may
have been, the formal unification of the two halves of Europe is a
historical achievement of the first order. This is not because it has
restored the countries of the East to an age-long common home, from which
only a malign fate  the totalitarian grip of Russia  wrested them after
the Second World War, as the ideologues of Central Europe, Kundera and
others, have argued. The division of the continent has deeper roots, and
goes back much further, than the pact at Yalta. In a well-received book, the
American historian Larry Wolff charged travellers and thinkers of the
Enlightenment with the invention of Eastern Europe as a supercilious myth
of the 18th century.4 The reality is that from the time of the Roman Empire
onwards, the lands now covered by the new member states of the Union were
nearly always poorer, less literate and less urbanised than most of their
counterparts to the west: prey to nomadic invasions from Asia; subjected to
a second serfdom that spared neither the German lands beyond the Elbe nor
even relatively advanced Bohemia; annexed by Habsburg, Romanov, Hohenzollern
or Ottoman conquerors. Their fate in the Second World War and its aftermath
was not an unhappy exception in their history, but  catastrophically
speaking  par for the course.

It is this millennial record, of repeated humiliation and oppression, that
entry into the Union offers a chance, finally, to leave behind. Who, with
any sense of the history of the continent, could fail to be moved by the
prospect of a cancellation in the inequality of its nations destinies? The
original design for EU expansion to the East, a joint product of German
strategy under Kohl and interested local elites, seconded by assorted
Anglo-American publicists, was to fast-track Poland, Hungary and the Czech
Republic into the Union, as the most congenial states of the region, with
the staunchest records of resistance to Communism and the most Westernised
political classes, leaving less favoured societies to kick their heels in
the rear. Happily, this invidious redivision of the East was avoided. Credit
for preventing it must go in the first instance to France, which from the
beginning advocated a regatta approach, insisting on the inclusion of
Romania, which made it difficult to exclude Bulgaria; to Sweden, which
championed Estonia, with the same effect on Latvia and Lithuania; and to the
Prodi Commission, which eventually rallied to comprehensive rather than
selective enlargement. The result was a far more generous settlement than
originally envisaged.

What of the economic upshot of expansion for the Union itself? Thanks to the
modesty of the regional funds allocated to the East, the financial cost of
enlargement has been significantly less than once estimated, and the balance
of trade has favoured the more powerful economies of the West. This,
however, is small change. The real takings  or bill, depending on who is
looking at it  lie elsewhere. Core European capital now has a major pool of
cheap labour at its disposal, conveniently located on its doorstep, not only
dramatically lowering its production costs in plants to the East, but
capable of exercising pressure on wages and conditions in the West. The
archetypal case is Slovakia, where wages in the auto industry are one eighth
of those in Germany, and more cars per capita are shortly going to be
produced  Volkswagen and Peugeot in the lead  than in any other country in
the world. It is the fear of such relocation, with the closure of factories
at home, that has cowed so many German workers into accepting longer hours
and less pay. Race-to-the bottom pressures are not confined to wages. The
ex-Communist states have pioneered flat taxes to woo investment, and now
compete with each other for the lowest possible rate: Estonia started with
26 per cent, Slovakia offers 19 per cent, Romania advertises 16 per cent,
while Poland is now mooting a best-buy of 15 per cent.

The role configured by the new East in the EU, in other words, promises to
be something like that played by the new South in the American economy since
the 1970s: a zone of business-friendly fiscal regimes, weak or non-existent
labour movements, low wages and  therefore  high investment, registering
faster growth than in the older core regions of continent-wide capital. Like
the US South, too, the region seems likely to fall somewhat short of the
standards of political respectability expected in the rest of the Union.
Already, now that they are safely inside the EU and there is no longer the
same need to be on their best behaviour, the elites of the region show signs
of kicking over the traces. In Poland, the ruling twins defy every norm of
ideological correctness as understood in Strasbourg or Brussels. In Hungary,
riot police stand on guard around a ruler unabashed at vaunting his lies to
voters. In the Czech Republic, months pass without parliament being able to
form a government. In Romania, the president insults the prime minister in a
phone-in call to a television talk-show. But, as in Kentucky or Alabama,
such provincial quirks add a touch of folkloric colour to the drab
metropolitan scene more than they disturb it.

All analogies have their limits. The distinctive role of the new South in
the political economy of the US has depended in part on immigration
attracted by the regions climate, which has given it rates of demographic
growth well above the national average. Eastern Europe is much more likely
to suffer out-migration, as the recent tide of Poles arriving in Britain,
and similar numbers from the Baltics and elsewhere in Ireland and Sweden,
suggest. But labour mobility in any direction is  and, for obvious
linguistic and cultural reasons, will remain  far lower in the EU than in
the US. Local welfare systems, inherited from the Communist past, and not
yet greatly dismantled, are also potential constraints on a Southern path.
Nor does the East, with less than a quarter of the population of the Union,
have anything like the relative weight of the South in the United States,
not to speak of the political leverage of the region at federal level. For
the moment, the effect of enlargement has essentially been much what the
Foreign Office and the employers lobbies in Brussels always hoped it would
be: the distension of the EU into a vast free-trade zone, with a newly
acquired periphery of cheap labour.

The integration of the East into the Union is the major achievement to which
admirers of the new Europe can legitimately point. Of course, as with the
standard encomia of the record of EU as a whole, there is a gap between
ideology and reality in the claims made for it. The Community that became a
Union was never responsible for the fifty years of peace conventionally
ascribed to it, a piety attributing to Brussels what in any strict sense
belonged to Washington. When actual wars threatened in Yugoslavia, far from
preventing their outbreak, the Union if anything helped to trigger them. In
not dissimilar fashion, publicists for the EU often imply that without
enlargement Eastern Europe would never have reached the safe harbour of
democracy, foundering in new forms of totalitarianism or barbarism. There is
somewhat more substance to this argument, since the EU has supervised
stabilisation of the political systems of the region. But this claim too
exaggerates dangers in the service of vanities. The EU played no role in the
overthrow of the regimes installed by Stalin, and there is little sign that
any of the countries in which they fell were at risk of lapsing into new
dictatorships, were it not for the saving hand of the Commission.
Enlargement has been a sufficient historical annealment, and so far economic
success, not to require claims that it has also been, counter-factually, a
political deliverance. The standard hype demeans rather than elevates what
has been achieved.

There remains the largest question of all. What has been the impact of
expansion to the East on the institutional framework of the EU itself? Here
the glass darkens. For if enlargement has been the principal achievement of
the recent period, the constitution that was supposed to renovate the Union
has been its most signal failure, and the potential interactions between the
two remain a matter of obscurity. The Convention on the Future of Europe met
in early 2002, and in mid-2003 delivered a draft European Constitution that
was agreed by the European Council in the summer of 2004. Delegates from
candidate countries were nominally included in the Convention, but since the
Convention itself amounted to little more than window-dressing for the
labours of its president, Giscard dEstaing, assisted by a British factotum,
John Kerr, the two real authors of the draft, their presence was of no
consequence. The future charter of Europe was written for the establishments
of the West, the governments of the existing 15 member states who had to
approve it, relegating the countries of the East to onlookers. In effect,
the logic of a constituent will was inverted: instead of enlargement
becoming the common basis of a new framework, the framework was erected
before enlargement.

The ensuing debacle came as a brief thunderclap to the Western elites. The
Constitution  more than 500 pages long, comprising 446 articles and 36
supplementary protocols, a bureaucratic elephantiasis without precedent
increased the power of the four largest states in the Union, Germany,
France, Britain and Italy; topped the inter-governmental complex in which
they would have greater sway with a five-year presidency, unelected by the
European Parliament, let alone the citizens of the Union; and inscribed the
imperatives of a highly competitive market, free of distortions, as a
foundational principle of political law, beyond the reach of popular choice.
The founders of the American Republic would have rubbed their eyes in
disbelief at such a ponderous and rickety construction. But so overwhelming
was the consensus of the continents media and political class behind it,
that few doubted it would come into force. To the astonishment of their
rulers, however, voters made short work of it. In France, where the
government was unwise enough to dispatch copies of the document to every
voter (Giscard complained of this folly with his handiwork), little was left
of it at the end of a referendum campaign in which a spirited popular
opposition  without the support of a single mainstream party, newspaper,
magazine, let alone radio or television programme  routed an establishment
united in endorsing it. Rarely, even in recent French history, was a pensie
quite so unique upended so spectacularly.

In the last days of the campaign, as polls showed increasing rejection of
the Constitution among voters, panic gripped the French media. But no local
hysterics, though there were many, rivalled those in Germany. Europe
Demands Courage, admonished G|nter Grass, J|rgen Habermas and a cohort of
like-minded German intellectuals, in an open letter dispatched to Le Monde.
Warning their neighbours that France . . . would isolate itself fatally if
it were to vote No, they went on: The consequences of a rejection would
be catastrophic, indeed an invitation to suicide, for without courage
there is no survival. In member states new and old the Constitution
fulfils a dream of centuries, and to vote for it was not just a duty to the
living, but to the dead: we owe this to the millions upon millions of
victims of our lunatic wars and criminal dictatorships. This from a country
where no risk was taken of any democratic consultation of the elector -ate,
and pro forma ratification of the Constitution was stage-managed in the
Bundesrat to impress French voters a few days before their referendum, with
Giscard as guest of honour at the podium. As for French isolation, three
days later the Dutch  told, still more bluntly, that Auschwitz awaited
Europe if they failed to vote yes  threw out the Constitution by an even
wider margin.

Such popular repudiation of the charter for a new Europe, not because it was
too federalist, but because it seemed to be little more than an impenetrable
scheme for the redistribution of oligarchic power, embodying everything most
distrusted in the arrogant, opaque system the EU appeared to have become,
was not in reality a bolt from the blue. Virtually every time  there have
not been many  that voters have been allowed to express an opinion about
the direction the Union was taking, they have rejected it. The Norwegians
refused the EC tout court; the Danes declined Maastricht; the Irish, the
Treaty of Nice; the Swedes, the euro. Each time, the political class
promptly sent them back to the polls to correct their mistake, or waited for
the occasion to reverse the verdict. The operative maxim of the EU has
become Brechts dictum: in case of setback, the government should dissolve
the people and elect a new one.

Predictably, amid the celebrations of the 50th anniversary of the Treaty of
Rome that gave birth to the EEC, European heads of state were soon
discussing how to cashier the popular will once again, and reimpose the
Constitution with cosmetic alterations but without exposing it this time to
the risks of a democratic decision. At the Brussels summit this June, the
requisite adjustment  now renamed a simple treaty  was agreed. To let it
disavow a referendum, Britain was exempted from the Charter of Fundamental
Rights to which all other member states subscribed. To throw a sop to French
opinion, references to unfettered competition were tucked away in a
protocol, rather than appearing in the main document. To square the
conscience of the Dutch, promotion of European values was made a test of
membership. To save the face of Polands rulers, the demotion of their
country to second rank in the Council was deferred for a decade, leaving
their successors to come to terms with it.

The principal novelty at this gathering to resuscitate what French and Dutch
voters had buried was the determination of Germany to ensure its primacy in
the electoral structure of the Council. Polish objections to a formula
doubling Germanys weight, and drastically reducing Polands, had  for
reasons that voting theory in international organisations has long made
clear, as experts in such matters pointed out  every technical
consideration of fairness on their side. But issues of equity were of no
more relevance to the outcome than issues of democracy. After blustering
that demographic losses in the Second World War entitled Poland to
proportionate compensation in the design of the Union, the Kaczynski twins
crumpled as quickly as the countrys prewar colonels before the German
blitz. Brave talk forgotten, it was all over in a phone call. For the region
where Poland accounts for nearly half the population and GDP, the episode is
a lesson in the tacit hierarchy of states it has entered. The East is
welcome, but should not get above itself.

Not that crumbs are unavailable. As the British, Dutch and French rulers, so
the Polish too received, with their postponed demotion, the fig-leaf needed
to dispense them from submitting the reanimated Constitution to the opinion
of their voters. It was left to Irelands Premier Ahern  along with Blair,
another of the conferences recent escapees from a cloud of corruption  to
exclaim, in a moment of unguarded delight: 90 per cent of it is still
there! Even loyal commentators have found it difficult to suppress all
disgust at the cynicism of this latest exercise in the Community method.
The contrast between such realities and the placards of the touts for the
new Europe could scarcely be starker. The truth is that the light of the
world, role model for humanity at large, cannot even count on the consent of
its populations at home.

What kind of political order, then, is taking shape in Europe, 15 years
after Maastricht? The pioneers of European integration  Monnet and his
fellow spirits  envisaged the eventual creation of a federal union that
would one day be the supranational equivalent of the nation-states out of
which it emerged, anchored in an expanded popular sovereignty, based on
universal suffrage, its executive answerable to an elected legislature, and
its economy subject to requirements of social responsibility. In short, a
democracy magnified to semi-continental scale (they had only Western Europe
in mind). But there was always another way of looking at European
unification, which saw it more as a limited pooling of powers by member
governments for certain  principally economic  ends, that did not imply
any fundamental derogation of national sovereignty as traditionally
understood, but rather the creation of a novel institutional framework for a
specified range of transactions. De Gaulle famously represented one version
of this outlook; Thatcher another. Between these federalist and
inter-governmentalist visions of Europe, there has been a continual tension
down to the present.

What has come into being, however, corresponds to neither. Constitutionally,
the EU is a caricature of a democratic federation, since its Parliament
lacks powers of initiative, contains no parties with any existence at
European level, and wants even a modicum of popular credibility. Modest
increments in its rights have not only failed to increase public interest in
this body, but have been accompanied by a further decline in it.
Participation in European elections has sunk steadily, to below 50 per cent,
and the newest voters are the most indifferent of all. In the East, the
regional figure in 2004 was scarcely more than 30 per cent; in Slovakia less
than 17 per cent of voters cast a ballot for their delegates to Strasbourg.
Such ennui is not irrational. The European Parliament is a Merovingian
legislature. The mayor in the palace is the Council of Ministers, where real
law-making decisions are taken, topped by the European Council of the heads
of state, meeting every three months. Yet this complex in turn fails the
opposite logic of an inter-governmental authority, since it is the
Commission  the EUs unelected executive  alone that can propose the laws
on which the Council and (more notionally) the Parliament deliberate. The
violation of a constitutional separation of powers in this dual authority
a bureaucracy vested with a monopoly of legislative initiative  is
flagrant. Alongside this hybrid executive, moreover, is an independent
judiciary, the European Court, capable of rulings discomfiting any national
government.

At the centre of this maze lies the impenetrable zone in which the rival
law-making instances of the Council and the Commission interlock, more
obscure than any other feature of the Union: the nexus of Coreper
committees in Brussels,5 where emissaries of the former confer behind closed
doors with functionaries of the latter, to generate the avalanche of legally
binding directives that form the main output of the EU  close on 100,000
pages to date. Here is the effective point of concentration of everything
summed up in the phrase  smacking, characteristically, of the
counting-house rather than the forum  democratic deficit, one ritually
deplored by EU officials themselves. In fact, what the trinity of Council,
Coreper and Commission figures is not just an absence of democracy  it is
certainly also that  but an attenuation of politics of any kind, as
ordinarily understood. The effect of this axis is to short-circuit  above
all at the critical Coreper level  national legislatures that are
continually confronted with a mass of decisions over which they lack any
oversight, without affording any supranational accountability in
compensation, given the shadow-play of the Parliament. The farce of popular
consultations that are regularly ignored is only the most dramatic
expression of this oligarchic structure, which sums up the rest.

Alongside their negation of democratic principles, two further and less
familiar features of these arrangements stand out. The vast majority of the
decisions of the Council, Commission and Coreper concern domestic issues
that were traditionally debated in national legislatures. But in the
conclaves at Brussels these become the object of diplomatic negotiations:
that is, of the kind of treatment classically reserved for foreign or
military affairs, where parliamentary controls are usually weak to
non-existent, and executive discretion more or less untrammelled. Since the
Renaissance, secrecy has always been the other name of diplomacy. What the
core structures of the EU effectively do is convert the open agenda of
parliaments into the closed world of chancelleries. But even this is not all
of it. Traditional diplomacy typically required stealth and surprise for
success. But it did not preclude discord or rupture. Classically, it
involved a war of manoeuvre between parties capable of breaking as well as
making alliances; sudden shifts in the terrain of negotiations; alterations
of means and objectives: in short, politics conducted between states, as
distinct from within them, but politics nonetheless. In the disinfected
universe of the EU, this all but disappears, as unanimity becomes virtually
de rigueur on all significant occasions, any public disagreement, let alone
refusal to accept a prefabricated consensus, increasingly being treated as
if it were an unthinkable breach of etiquette. The deadly conformism of EU
summits, smugly celebrated by theorists of consociational democracy, as if
this were anything other than a cartel of self-protective elites, closes the
coffin of even real diplomacy, covering it with wreaths of bureaucratic
piety. Nothing is left to move the popular will, as democratic participation
and political imagination are each snuffed out.

These structures have been some time in the making. Unreformed, they could
not but be reinforced by enlargement. The distance between rulers and ruled,
already wide enough in a Community of nine or 12 countries, can only widen
much further in a Union of 27 or more, where economic and social
circumstances differ so vastly that the Gini coefficient in the EU is now
higher than in the US, the fabled land of inequality itself. It was always
the calculation of adversaries of European federalism, successive British
governments at their head, that the more extended the Community became, the
less chance there was of any deepening of its institutions in a democratic
direction, for the more impractical any conception of popular sovereignty in
a supranational union would become. Their intentions have come to pass.
Stretched to nearly 500 million citizens, the EU of today is in no position
to recall the dreams of Monnet.

So what? There is no shortage of apologists prepared to explain that it is
not just wrong to complain of a lack of democracy in the Union,
conventionally understood, but that this is actually its greatest virtue.
The standard argument, to be found in journals such as Prospect, goes like
this. The EU deals essentially with the technical and administrative issues
market competition, product specification, consumer protection and the
like  posed by the aim of the Treaty of Rome to assure the free movement of
goods, persons and capital within its borders. These are matters in which
voters have little interest, rightly taking the view that they are best
handled by appropriate experts, rather than incompetent parliamentarians.
Just as the police, fire brigade or officer corps are not elected, but enjoy
the widest public trust, so it is  at any rate tacitly  with the
functionaries in Brussels. The democratic deficit is a myth, because matters
which voters do care strongly about  pre-eminently taxes and social
services, the real stuff of politics  continue to be decided, not at Union
but at national level, by traditional electoral mechanisms. So long as the
separation between the two arenas and their respective types of decision is
respected, and we are spared demagogic exercises in populism  putting
issues that the masses cannot understand, and that should never be on a
ballot in the first place, to referenda  democracy remains intact, indeed
enhanced. Considered soberly, all is for the best in the best of all
possible Europes.

In an unreflective sense, this case might seem to appeal to a common
immediate experience of the Union. If asked in what ways they have
personally been affected by the EU, most of its citizens  at least those
who live in the Eurozone and Schengen belt  would certainly not mention its
technical directives; they would probably answer that travel has been
simplified by the disappearance of border controls and the need to change
currencies. Beyond such conveniences, a narrow stratum of professionals and
executives, and a somewhat broader flow of migrant workers and craftsmen,
have benefited from occupational mobility across borders, though this is
still quite limited: less than 2 per cent of the population of the Union
lives outside its country of origin. In some ways more significant may be
the programmes that take growing numbers of students to courses in other
societies of the EU. Journeys, studies, a scattering of jobs: agreeable
changes all, not vital issues. It is this expanse of mild amenities that no
doubt explains the passivity of voters towards rulers who ignore their
expressions of opinion. For nearly as striking as the repeated popular
rejection of official schemes for the Union is the lack of reaction to
subsequent flouting of the popular decision. The elites do not persuade the
masses; but, to all appearances, they have little to fear from them.

Why then is there such persistent distrust of Brussels, if so little of what
it does impinges on ordinary life, and that quite pleasantly? Subjectively,
the answer is clear. There are few citizens who are not banally alienated
from the way they are governed at home  virtually every poll shows how
little they believe in what their rulers say, and how powerless they feel to
alter what they do. Yet these are still societies in which elections are
regularly held, and governments that become too disliked can be evicted. No
one doubts that democracy, in this minimal sense, obtains. At European
level, however, there is all too obviously not even this vestige of
accountability: the grounds for alienation are cubed. If the EU really had
zero impact on what voters care about, their distrust could be dismissed as
a mere abstract prejudice. But in fact the intuition behind it is accurate.
Since the Treaty of Maastricht, the Union has not by any means been confined
to regulatory issues of scant interest to the population at large. It now
has a Central Bank, without even the commitment of the Federal Reserve to
sustain employment, let alone its duties to report to Congress, that sets
interest rates for the whole Eurozone, backed by a Stability Pact that
requires national governments to meet hard budgetary targets. In other
words, determination of macroeconomic policy at the highest level has
shifted upwards from national capitals to Frankfurt and Brussels. What this
means is that just those issues that voters usually feel most strongly about
jobs, taxes and social services  fall squarely under the guillotines of
the Bank and the Commission. The history of the past years has shown that
this is not an academic matter. It was pressure from Brussels to cut public
spending which led Juppis government to introduce the fiscal package that
detonated the great French strike-wave of the winter of 1995, and brought
him down. It was the corset of the Stability Pact that forced Portugal into
slashing social benefits and plunging the country into a steep recession in
2003. The government in Lisbon did not survive either. The notion that
todays EU comprises little more than a set of innocuous technical rules, as
value-neutral as traffic lights, is a fatuity.

There was from the beginning a third vision of what European integration
should mean, distinct from either federalist or inter-governmentalist
conceptions of the Community. Its far-sighted theorist was Hayek, who even
before the Second World War had envisaged a constitutional structure raised
sufficiently high above the nations composing it to exclude the danger of
any popular sovereignty below impinging on it. In the nation-state,
electorates were perpetually subject to dirigiste and redistributive
temptations, encroaching on the rights of property in the name of democracy.
But once heterogeneous populations were assembled in an inter-state
federation, as he called it, they would not be able to re-create the united
will that was prone to such ruinous interventions. Under an impartial
authority, beyond the reach of political ignorance or envy, the spontaneous
order of a market economy could finally unfold without interference.

By 1950, when Monnet was devising the Schuman Plan that yielded the initial
European Coal and Steel Community, Hayek himself was in America, and played
little part in shaping arguments for integration. Later, rejecting the idea
of a single currency as statist (he favoured competing private issues), he
would come to the conclusion that the Community itself remained all too
dirigiste. But in Germany there was a school of theorists that saw the
possibilities of European unity in much the same terms as he had originally
envisaged, the Ordo-liberals of Freiburg, whose leading thinkers were Walter
Eucken, Wilhelm Rvpke and Alfred M|ller-Armack. Lacking Hayeks intransigent
radicalism, they were close to Ludwig Erhard, the reputed architect of the
postwar German miracle, and thereby had more real influence in the early
days of the Common Market. But for thirty years, this was still a recessive
strain in the make-up of the Community, latent but never the most salient in
its development.

With the abrupt deterioration in the global economic climate in the 1970s,
and the general neo-liberal turn that followed in the 1980s, Hayekian
doctrine was rediscovered throughout the West. The leading edge of the
change came in the UK and US, with the arrival of Thatcher and Reagan.
Continental Europe never produced comparably radical regimes, but the
ideological atmosphere shifted steadily in the same direction. The collapse
of the Soviet bloc sealed the transformation of working assumptions. By the
1990s, the Commission was openly committed to privatisation as a principle,
pressed without embarrassment on candidate countries along with other
democratic niceties. Its most powerful arm had become the Competition
Directorate, striking out at public sector monopolies in Western and Eastern
Europe alike. In Frankfurt the Central Bank conformed perfectly with Hayeks
prewar prescriptions. What was originally the least prominent strand in the
weave of European integration had become the dominant pattern. Federalism
stymied, inter-governmentalism corroded, what had emerged was neither the
rudiments of a European democracy controlled by its citizens, nor the
formation of a European directory guided by its powers, but a vast zone of
increasingly unbound market exchange, much closer to a European catallaxy
as Hayek had conceived it.

The mutation is by no means complete. The European Parliament is still
there, as a memento of federal hopes foregone. Agricultural and regional
subsidies, legacies of a cameralist past, continue to absorb most of the EU
budget. Services, over two-thirds of Union GDP, have yet to be fully
liberalised. But of a social Europe, in the sense intended by either
Monnet or Delors, there is as little left as a democratic Europe. At
national level, welfare regimes that distinguish the Old World from the New
persist. With the exception of Ireland, the share of state expenditure in
GDP remains higher in Western Europe than in the United States, and the
larger part of an academic industry  the varieties of capitalism
literature  is dedicated to showing how much more caring ours, above all
the Scandinavian versions, are than theirs. The claim is valid enough; the
self-satisfaction less so. For as the numbers of long-term jobless and
pensioners have risen, the drift of the age has been away from earlier norms
of provision, not beyond them. The very term reform now means, virtually
always, the opposite of what it denoted fifty years ago: not the creation
but the contraction of welfare arrangements once prized by their recipients.
The only two structural advances beyond the postwar gains of social
democracy  the Meidner plan for pension funds in Sweden, and the 35-hour
week in France  have both been rolled back. The tide is moving in the other
direction.

Todays EU, with its pinched spending (just over 1 per cent of Union GDP),
minuscule bureaucracy (around 16,000 officials, excluding translators),
absence of independent taxation, and lack of any means of administrative
enforcement, could in many ways be regarded as a ne plus ultra of the
minimal state, beyond the most drastic imaginings of classical liberalism:
less even than the dream of a nightwatchman. Its structure not only rules
out a transfer, of the sort once envisaged by Delors, of social functions
from national to supranational level, to counterbalance the strain these
have come under from high rates of unemployment and growing numbers of
pensioners. Its effect is to increase, rather than compensate for, pressure
on national systems of social provision, as so many impediments to the free
movement of factors of production. As a leading authority, Andrew Moravcsik,
explains, the neo-liberal bias of the EU, if it exists, is justified by the
social welfare bias of current national policies, which no responsible
analyst believes can be maintained  European social policy exists only in
the dreams of disgruntled socialists. The salutary truth is that the EU is
overwhelmingly about the promotion of free markets. Its primary interest
group support comes from multinational firms, not least US ones. In short:
regnant in this Union is not democracy, and not welfare, but capital. The
EU is basically about business.

That may be so, enthusiasts might reply, but why should it detract from the
larger good that the EU represents in the world, a political community that
stands alone in its respect for human rights, international law, aid to the
poor of the earth, and protection of the environment? Could the Union not be
described as the realisation of the Enlightenment vision of the virtues of
le doux commerce, that cure for the most destructive prejudices, as
Montesquieu described it, pacifying relations between states in a spirit of
mutual benefit and the rule of law?

In the current repertoire of tributes to Europe, it is this claim  the
unique role and prestige of the EU on the worlds stage  that now has pride
of place. What it rests on, ubiquitously, is a contrast with the United
States. America figures as the increasingly ominous, violent, swaggering
Other of a humane continent of peace and progress: a society that is a law
to itself, where Europe strives for a legal order binding on all. The values
of the two, Habermas and many fellow thinkers explain, have diverged:
widespread gun culture, extreme economic inequality, fundamentalist religion
and capital punishment, not to speak of national bravado, divide the US from
the EU and foster a more regressive conception of international relations.
Reversing Goethes dictum, we have it better here.

The crystallisation of these images came with the invasion of Iraq. The mass
demonstrations against the war of 15 February 2003, Habermas thought, might
go down in history as a signal for the birth of a European public. Even
such an unlikely figure as Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the probable incoming
director of the IMF, announced that they marked the birth of a European
nation. But if this was a Declaration of Independence, was the term nation
appropriate for what was being born? While divergence with America over the
Middle East could serve as a negative definition of the emergent Europe,
there was a positive side that pointed in another conceptual direction.
Enlargement was the great new achievement of the Union. How should it be
theorised? In late 1991, a few months after the collapse of the Soviet Union
and a few days after the summit at Maastricht, J.G.A. Pocock published a
prophetic essay in these pages.6 A trenchant critic of the EU, which he has
always seen as involving a surrender of sovereignty and identity  and with
them the conditions also of democracy  to the market, though a surrender
never yet completed, Pocock observed that Europe now faced the problem of
determining its frontiers, as once again an empire in the sense of a
civilised and stabilised zone which must decide whether to extend or refuse
its political power over violent and unstable cultures along its borders.

At the time, this was not a formulation welcome in official discourse on
Europe. A decade later, the term it loosed with irony has become a common
coin of complacency. As the countdown to Iraq proceeded, the British
diplomat Robert Cooper, special adviser on security to Blair, and later to
Prodi as head of the Commission, explained the merits of empire to readers
of Prospect. A system in which the strong protect the weak, in which the
efficient and well-governed export stability and liberty, in which the world
is open for investment and growth  all of these seem eminently desirable.
Of course, in a world of human rights and bourgeois values, a new
imperialism will . . . have to be very different from the old. It would be
a voluntary imperialism, of the sort admirably displayed by the EU in the
Balkans. Enlargement ahead, he concluded, the Union was en route to the
noble dream of a co-operative empire. Enlargement in the bag, the Polish
theorist Jan Zielonka, now at Oxford, exults in his book Europe as Empire
that its design was truly imperialist: power politics at its best, even
though the term power was never mentioned in the official enlargement
discourse  this was a benign empire in action.7

In more tough-minded style, the German strategist Herfried M|nkler, holder
of the chair of political theory at Humboldt University in Berlin, has
expounded the world-historical logic of empires in an ambitious comparative
work, Imperien, whose ideas were first presented as an aide-mimoire to a
conference of ambassadors called by his countrys Foreign Ministry.8 Its
theme is that, from ancient to modern times, imperial power has been
required to stabilise adjacent power vacuums or turbulent border zones,
holding barbarians or terrorists at bay. While naturally loyal to the West,
M|nkler disavows normative considerations. Human rights messianism is a
moral luxury even the American empire can ill-afford. Europe, for its part,
should take the measure of its emergent role as a sub-imperial system,
with its own marches to control, matching its tasks to its capabilities
without excessive professions of uplifting intent.

The prefix poses the question that is the crux of the new identity Europe
has awarded itself. How independent of the United States is it? The answer
is cruel, as even a cursory glance at the record shows. Perhaps at no time
since 1950 has it been less so. The history of enlargement, the Unions
major achievement  extending the frontiers of freedom, or ascending to the
rank of empire, or both at once, as the claim may be  is an index.
Expansion to the East was piloted by Washington: in every case, the former
Soviet satellites were incorporated into Nato, under US command, before they
were admitted to the EU. Poland and the Czech Republic had joined Nato in
1999, five years before entry into the Union; Bulgaria and Romania in 2004,
three years before entry; even Slovakia, Slovenia and the Baltics, a
gratuitous month  just to rub in the symbolic point?  before entry
(planning for the Baltics started in 1998). Croatia, Macedonia and Albania
are next in line.

The expansion of Nato to former Soviet borders, casting aside undertakings
given to Gorbachev at the end of the Cold War, was the work of the Clinton
administration. Twelve days after the first levy of Poland, Hungary and the
Czech Republic had joined the Alliance, the Balkan War was launched  the
first full-scale military offensive in Natos history. The successful blitz
was an American operation, with token auxiliaries from Europe, and virtually
no dissent in public opinion. These were harmonious days in Euro-American
relations. There was no race between the EU and Nato in the East. Brussels
deferred to the priority of Washington, which encouraged and prompted the
advance of Brussels. So natural has this asymmetrical symbiosis now become
that the United States can openly specify what further states should join
the Union. When Bush told European leaders in Ankara, at a gathering of
Nato, that Turkey must be admitted into the EU, Chirac was heard to grumble
that the US would not like being instructed by Europeans to welcome Mexico
into the federation; but when the European Council met to decide whether to
open accession negotiations with Turkey, Rice telephoned the assembled
leaders from Washington to ensure the right outcome, without hearing any
inappropriate complaints from them about sovereignty. At this level,
friction between Europe and America remains minimal.

Why then has there been that sense of a general crisis in transatlantic
relations, which has given rise to such an extensive literature? In the EU,
media and public opinion are at one in holding the conduct of the Republican
administration outside Nato to be essentially responsible. Scanting the
Kyoto protocols and the International Criminal Court, sidelining the UN,
trampling on the Geneva Conventions, and stampeding into the Middle East,
the Bush regime has on this view exposed a darker side of the United States,
that has understandably been met with near universal abhorrence in Europe,
even if etiquette has restrained expressions of it at diplomatic level.
Above all, revulsion at the war in Iraq has, more than any other single
episode since 1945, led to the rift recorded in the painful title of
Habermass latest work, The Divided West.9

In this vision, there is a sharp contrast between the Clinton and Bush
presidencies, and it is the break in the continuity of American foreign
policy  the jettisoning of consensual leadership for an arrogant
unilateralism  that has alienated Europeans. There is no question of the
intensity of this perception. But in the orchestrations of Americas
Weltpolitik, style is easily mistaken for substance. The brusque manners of
the Bush administration, its impatience with the euphemisms of the
international community and blunt rejection of Kyoto and the ICC, offended
European sensibilities from the start. Clintons emollient gestures were
more tactful, if in practice their upshot  neither Kyoto nor the ICC ever
risked passage into law while he was in office  was often much the same.
More fundamentally, as political operations, a straight line led from the
war in the Balkans to the war in Mesopotamia. In both, a casus belli
imminent genocide, imminent nuclear weapons  was trumped up; the Security
Council ignored; international law set aside; and an assault unleashed.

United over Yugoslavia, Europe split over Iraq, where the strategic risks
were higher. But the extent of European opposition to the march on Baghdad
was always something of an illusion. On the streets, in Italy, Spain,
Germany, Britain, huge numbers of people demonstrated against the invasion.
Opinion polls showed majorities against it everywhere. But once it had
occurred, there was little protest against the occupation, let alone support
for the resistance to it. Most European governments  Britain, Spain, Italy,
Netherlands, Denmark, Portugal in the West; all in the East  backed the
invasion, and sent troops to bulk up the US forces holding the country down.
Out of the 12 member states of the EU in 2003, just three  France, Germany
and Belgium  came out against the prospect of war before the event. None
condemned the attack when it was launched. But the declared opposition of
Paris and Berlin to the plans of Washington and London gave popular
sentiment across Europe a point of concentration, confirming and amplifying
its sense of distance from power and opinion in America. The notion of an
incipient Declaration of Independence by the Old World was born here.

Realities were rather different. Chirac and Schrvder had a domestic interest
in countering the invasion. Each judged his electorate well, and gained
substantially  Schrvder securing re-election  from his stance. On the
other hand, American will was not to be trifled with. So each compensated in
deeds for what he proclaimed in words, opposing the war in public, while
colluding with it sub rosa. Behind closed doors in Washington, Frances
ambassador Jean-David Levitte  currently Sarkozys diplomatic adviser
gave the White House a green light for the war, provided it was on the basis
of the first generic UN Resolution 1441, as Cheney wanted, without returning
to the Security Council for the second explicit authorisation to attack that
Blair wanted, which would force France to veto it. In ciphers from Baghdad,
German intelligence agents provided the Pentagon with targets and
co-ordinates for the first US missiles to hit the city, in the downpour of
Shock and Awe. Once the ground war began, France provided airspace for USAF
missions to Iraq (which Chirac had denied Reagans bombing of Libya), and
Germany a key transport hub for the campaign. Both countries voted for the
UN resolution ratifying the US occupation of Iraq, and lost no time
recognising the client regime patched together by Washington.

As for the EU, its choice of a new president of the Commission in 2004 could
not have been more symbolic: the Portuguese ruler who hosted Bush, Blair and
Aznar at the summit in the Azores on 16 March 2003 that issued the ultimatum
for the assault on Iraq. Barroso is in good company. France now has a
foreign minister, Bernard Kuchner, who had no time for even the modest
duplicities of his country about Americas war, welcoming it as another
example of the droit dingirence he had always championed. Sweden, where
once a prime minister could take a sharper distance from the war in Vietnam
than De Gaulle himself, has a new minister for foreign affairs to match his
colleague in Paris: Carl Bildt, a founder member of the Committee for the
Liberation of Iraq, along with Richard Perle, William Kristol, Newt Gingrich
and others. In the UK, the local counterpart has proudly restated his
support for the war, though here, no doubt, the corpses were stepped over in
pursuit of preferment rather than principle. Spaniards and Italians may have
withdrawn their troops from Iraq, but no European government has any policy
towards a society America has destroyed that is distinct from the outlook in
Washington.

For the rest, Europe remains engaged to the hilt in the war in Afghanistan,
where a contemporary version of the expeditionary force dispatched to crush
the Boxer Rebellion has killed more civilians this year than the guerrillas
it seeks to root out. The Pentagon did not require the services of Nato for
its lightning overthrow of the Taliban, though British and French jets put
in a nominal appearance. Occupation of the country, which has a larger
population and more forbidding terrain than Iraq, was another matter, and a
Nato force of five thousand was assembled to hold the fort around Kabul,
while US forces finished off Mullah Omar and Bin Laden. Five years later,
Omar and Osama remain at large; the Wests puppet ruler, Karzai, cannot move
without a squad of mercenaries from DynCorp International to protect him;
production of opium has increased tenfold; the Afghan resistance has become
steadily more effective; and Nato-led forces  now comprising contingents
from 37 nations, from Britain, Germany, France, Italy, Turkey, Poland down
to such minnows as Iceland  have swollen to 35,000, alongside 25,000 US
troops. Indiscriminate bombing, random shooting and human rights abuses,
in the polite phrase, have become commonplaces of the counter-insurgency.

In the wider Middle East, the scene is the same. Europe is joined at the hip
with the US, wherever the legacies of imperial control or settler zeal are
at stake. Britain and France, original suppliers of heavy water and uranium
for the large Israeli nuclear arsenal, which they pretend does not exist,
demand along with America that Iran abandon programmes it is allowed even by
the Non-Proliferation Treaty, under menace of sanctions and war. In Lebanon,
the EU and the US prop up a cabinet that would not last a day if a census
were called, while German, French and Italian troops provide border guards
for Israel. As for Palestine, the EU showed no more hesitation than the US
in plunging the population into misery, cutting off all aid when voters
elected the wrong government, on the pretext that it must first recognise
the Israeli state, as if Israel had ever recognised a Palestinian state, and
renounce terrorism (read: any armed resistance to a military occupation that
has lasted forty years without Europe lifting a finger against it). Funds
now flow again, to protect a remnant valet in the West Bank.

Lovers of Europe might reply that some of this record may be questionable,
but these are external issues that can scarcely be said to affect the
example Europe sets the world of respect for human rights and the rule of
law within its own borders. The performance of the EU or its member states
may not be irreproachable in the Middle East, but isnt the moral leadership
represented by its standards at home what really counts, internationally? So
good a conscience comes too easily. The war on terror knows no frontiers and
the crimes committed in its name have stalked freely across the continent,
in the full cognisance of its rulers. Originally, the subcontracting of
torture  rendition, or the handing over of a victim to the attentions of
the secret police in client states  was, like so much else, an invention of
the Clinton administration, which introduced the practice in the mid-1990s.
Asked about it a decade later, the CIA official in charge of the programme,
Michael Scheuer, simply said: I check my moral qualms at the door. As one
would expect, it was Britain that collaborated with the first renditions, in
the company of Croatia and Albania.

Under the Bush administration, the programme expanded. Three weeks after
9/11, Nato declared that Article V of its charter, mandating collective
defence in the event of an attack on one of its members, was activated. By
then American plans for the descent on Afghanistan were well advanced, but
they did not include European participation in Operation Enduring Freedom;
the US high command had found the need for consultation in a joint campaign
cumbersome in the Balkan War, and did not want to repeat the experience.
Instead, at a meeting in Brussels on 4 October 2001, the allies were called
on for other services. The specification of these remains secret, but as the
second report to the Council of Europe  released in June this year  by the
courageous Swiss investigator Dick Marty, has shown, a stepped-up programme
of renditions must have been high on the list. Once Afghanistan was taken,
Baghram airbase outside Kabul became both interrogation centre for the CIA
and loading-bay for prisoners to Guantanamo. The traffic was soon two-way,
and its pivot was Europe. In one direction, captives were transported from
Afghan or Pakistani dungeons to Europe, either to be held there in secret
CIA jails, or shipped onwards to Cuba. In the other direction, captives were
flown from secret locations in Europe for requisite treatment in
Afghanistan.

Though Nato initiated this system, the abductions it involved were not
confined to members of the North Atlantic Council. Europe was eager to help
America, whether or not fine print obliged it to do so. North, south, east
and west: no part of the continent failed to join in. New Labours
contribution occasions no surprise: with up to 650,000 civilians dead from
the Anglo-American invasion of Iraq, it would have been unreasonable for the
Straws, Becketts, Milibands to lose any sleep over the torture of the
living. More striking is the role of the neutrals. Under Ahern, Ireland
furnished Shannon to the CIA for so many westbound flights that locals
dubbed it Guantanamo Express. Social-democratic Sweden, under its portly
boss Gvran Persson, now a corporate lobbyist, handed over two Egyptians
seeking asylum to the CIA, who took them straight to torturers in Cairo.
Under Berlusconi, Italy helped a large CIA team to kidnap another Egyptian
in Milan, who was flown from the US airbase in Aviano, via Ramstein in
Germany, for the same treatment in Cairo.10 Under Prodi, a government of
Catholics and ex-Communists has sought to frustrate the judicial
investigation of this kidnapping, while presiding over the expansion of
Aviano. Switzerland proffered the overflight that took the victim to
Ramstein, and protected the head of the CIA gang that seized him from arrest
by the Italian judicial authorities  he now basks in Florida.

Further east, Poland did not transmit captives to their fate in the Middle
East, but incarcerated them for treatment on the spot, in torture chambers
constructed for high-value detainees by the CIA at the Stare Kiejkuty
intelligence base, Europes own Baghram  facilities unknown in the time of
Jaruzelskis martial law. In Romania, a military base north of Constanza
performed the same services, under the superintendence of the countrys
current president, the staunchly pro-Western Traian Basescu. In Bosnia, six
Algerians were illegally seized at American behest, and flown from Tuzla
beatings in the aircraft en route  to the US base at Incirlik in Turkey,
and thence to Guantanamo, where they still crouch in their cages. In
Macedonia, scene of Blairs moving encounters with refugees from Kosovo,
there was a combination of the two procedures, as a German of Lebanese
descent was kidnapped at the border; held, interrogated and beaten by the
CIA in Skopje; then drugged and shipped to Kabul for more extended
treatment. Eventually, when it became clear, after he went on hunger-strike,
that his identity had been mistaken, he was flown blindfold to a
Nato-upgraded airbase in Albania, and deposited back in Germany.

There the Red-Green government had been well aware of what happened to him,
one of its agents interrogating him in his oubliette in Kabul  Otto Schily,
the minister of the interior, was in the Afghan capital at the time  and
accompanying his flight back to Albania. But it was no more concerned about
his fate than about that of another of its residents, a Turk born in
Germany, seized by the CIA in Pakistan and dispatched to the gulag in
Guantanamo, where he too was interrogated by German agents. Both operations
were under the control of todays Social Democratic foreign minister,
Frank-Walter Steinmeier, then in charge of the secret services, who not only
covered for the torturing of the victim in Cuba, but even declined an
American offer to release him. In a letter to the mans mother, Joschka
Fischer, Green foreign minister at the time, explained that the government
could do nothing for him. In such a good land, as a leading admirer has
recently described it, Fischer and Steinmeier remain the most popular of
politicians. The new interior minister, Wolfgang Schduble, is more robust,
publicly calling for assassination rather than rendition in dealing with
deadly enemies of the state, in the Israeli manner.

Such is the record set out in the two detailed reports by Marty to the
Council of Europe (nothing to do with the EU), each an exemplary document of
meticulous detective work and moral passion. If this Swiss prosecutor from
Ticino were representative of the continent, rather than a voice crying in
the wilderness, there would be reason to be proud of it. He ends his second
report by expressing the hope that his work will bring home the legal and
moral quagmire into which we have collectively sunk as a result of the
US-led war on terror. Almost six years in, we seem no closer to pulling
ourselves out of this quagmire. Indeed. Not a single European government
has conceded any guilt, while all continue imperturbably to hold forth on
human rights. We are in the world of Ibsen  Consul Bernick, Judge Brack and
their like  updated for postmoderns. Pillars of society, pimping for
torture.

What has been delivered in these practices are not just the hooded or
chained bodies, but the deliverers themselves: Europe surrendered to the
United States. This rendition is the most taboo of all to mention. A rough
approximation to it can be found in what remains in many ways the best
account of the relationship between the two, Robert Kagans Paradise and
Power, the benevolent contempt of whose imagery of Mars and Venus  the Old
World, relieved of military duties by the New, cultivating the arts and
pleasures of a borrowed peace  predictably riled Europeans.11 But even
Kagan grants them too much, as if they really lived according to the
precepts of Kant, while Americans were obliged to act on the truths of
Hobbes. If a philosophical reference were wanted, more appropriate would
have been La Boitie, whose Discours de la servitude volontaire could furnish
a motto for the Union. But these are arcana. The one contemporary text to
have captured the full flavour of the transatlantic relationship is, perhaps
inevitably, a satire, Rigis Debrays plea for a United States of the West
that would absorb Europe completely into the American imperium.12

Did it have to come to this? The paradox is that when Europe was less
united, it was in many ways more independent. The leaders who ruled in the
early stages of integration had all been formed in a world before the global
hegemony of the United States, when the major European states were
themselves imperial powers, whose foreign policies were self-determined.
These were people who had lived through the disasters of the Second World
War, but were not crushed by them. This was true not just of a figure like
De Gaulle, but of Adenauer and Mollet, of Eden and Heath, all of whom were
quite prepared to ignore or defy America if their ambitions demanded it.
Monnet, who did not accept their national assumptions, and never clashed
with the US, still shared their sense of a future in which Europeans could
settle their own affairs, in another fashion. Down into the 1970s, something
of this spirit lived on even in Giscard and Schmidt, as Carter discovered.
But with the neo-liberal turn of the 1980s, and the arrival in power in the
1990s of a postwar generation, it faded. The new economic doctrines cast
doubt on the state as a political agent, and the new leaders had never known
anything except the Pax Americana. The traditional springs of autonomy were
gone.

By this time, on the other hand, the Community had doubled in size, acquired
an international currency, and boasted a GDP exceeding that of the United
States itself. Statistically, the conditions for an independent Europe
existed as never before. But politically, they had been reversed. With the
decay of federalism and the deflation of inter-governmentalism, the Union
had weakened national, without creating a supranational, sovereignty,
leaving rulers adrift in an ill-defined limbo between the two. With the
eclipse of significant distinctions between left and right, other motives of
an earlier independence have also waned. In the syrup of la pensie unique,
little separates the market-friendly wisdom of one side of the Atlantic from
the other, though as befits the derivative, the recipe is still blander in
Europe than America, where political differences are less extinct. In such
conditions, an enthusiast can find no higher praise for the Union than to
compare it to one of the most successful companies in global history.
Which firm confers this honour on Brussels? Why, the one in your wallet. The
EU is already closer to Visa than it is to a state, declares New Labours
Mark Leonard, exalting Europe to the rank of a credit card.

Transcendence of the nation-state, Marx believed, would be a task not for
capital but for labour. A century later, as the Cold War set in, Kojhve held
that whichever camp achieved it would emerge the victor from the conflict.
The foundation of the European Community settled the issue for him. The West
would win, and its triumph would bring history, understood categorically
not chronologically  as the realisation of human freedom, to an end.
Kojhves prediction was accurate. His extrapolation, and its irony, remain
in the balance. They have certainly not been disproved: he would have smiled
at the image of a chit of plastic. The emergence of the Union may be
regarded as the last great world-historical achievement of the bourgeoisie,
proof that its creative powers were not exhausted by the fratricide of two
world wars, and what has happened to it as a strange declension from what
was hoped from it. Yet the long-run outcome of integration remains
unforeseeable to all parties. Even without shocks, many a zigzag has marked
its path. With them, who knows what further mutations might occur.
