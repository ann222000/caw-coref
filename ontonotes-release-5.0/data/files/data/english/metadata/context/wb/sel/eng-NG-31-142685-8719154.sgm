Immigration Crackdown Worries Employers

By JULIANA BARBASSA

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - Farmers and other employers who rely heavily on immigrant labor
said Friday that they could be driven out of business by the Bush administration's
plans to crack down on workers whose Social Security numbers do not match their
names, and businesses that hire them.

Administration officials said the stepped-up enforcement would begin in 30 days.

The same results you hope to achieve whenever you enforce laws --
reduction of the illegal behavior.  Most people think that there is a
good, sound reason to uphold immigration law.  We are experiencing the
bad that results when it isn't upheld.

If you don't care about millions of people entering the country and
using fraudulent documents to attain work and social services, if you
don't see what that does to us as a whole, you probably won't perceive
any benefit for yourself or anyone else.  Most will be glad to see
some measure of long-overdue justice meted out, even if it is a token.

doing nothing is a program/strategy, it is a miserable failure.

Oh. This is true.

However, &quot;criminal behavior&quot; is not automatically a down check in my
book. Mostly because the usual method used in defining &quot;criminal

That doesn't logically follow. The obligation for presenting your case
is yours, and yours alone.

It certainly isn't mine. It can't be.

You have nothing upon which to base your prediction that I wouldn't
perceive the benefits if you, in fact, articulate them.

In fact, I might.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

I don't care what &quot;most&quot; will be glad to see. Most are glad to see
Britney Spears.

Justice, qua justice, interests me. But where you seem to see justice, I
see people who have no real claim to citizenship--beyond a legal fiction
that says they're &quot;citizens&quot; because of an accident of birth. And these
people who've done nothing to earn their own franchise are forbidding
franchise to others.

Maybe they have the right to do so, they certainly have a legal right to
do so, but this equation has little to do with justice.

Objectively speaking.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

I don't see any negative consequences to myself. The 12 million are
here, and I haven't missed any meals. I don't think anyone else in this
nation has, either.

If they are costing us money by remaining here, there's at least 12
million of our own &quot;citizens&quot; costing us far more.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; If
&gt; doing nothing is a program/strategy, it is a miserable failure.

I'm not advocating doing nothing. There are those who've proposed to
make them all legal residents with the stroke of a pen.

I'm not opposed to supporting such a stroke. For one thing, it is
thought that this will ease the shock of the Baby Boomers tapping into
the a Social Security System that will not support them.

I think if something isn't done to ease this shock, the United States
will face a crisis it hasn't faced since 1932.

So, in the face of other far more pressing problems that haven't and
won't be addressed, I'm in favor of the not-as-bad solution of
immigration reform.

You've hardly enough information from my post to conclude anything of
the sort.

I'm very much in favor of free trade agreements. If you're not, perhaps
we can have a discussion about them sometime.

&quot;No regulation&quot; is very near and dear to my heart. But I'm no utopian,
nor am I particularly romantic. I realize that Mrs. Grundy must have
regulations in order to feel safe enough to leave the house.

I'll take regulations on a case by case basis. But I insist that we
limit regulation to a minimum. If only so that they can work, and do
what they claim to do.

Again, perhaps this is for another discussion.

As to open borders, I think we benefit more from open borders than by
many of the alternatives being proposed.

The whole discussion may just boil down to a cost/benefit equation.

In your world, everything &quot;looks great on paper&quot;.  Come and live in
South L.A., or Corona/Queens, NY, or South Chicago, or parts of
Georgia overrun with hispanic illegal aliens (as a direct result of
open borders).  Stick your nose in the glory of these communities.
Send you children to the local public schools, you know, the schools
where 1/2 the kids are English learners, the schools which are the
poorest performing schools in the state.  Live it for at least a year
and that should correct your views on open borders.

I don't have a recollection of cutting and running, and only a vague
recollection of the question being put--though if you say I cut and ran,
I must have.

I can correct that now.

As you've constructed the question it makes very little sense to me.
Could you articulate it better, and perhaps, put it in context?

For instance, free speech by which party(ies)? What do you define as
free trade, and how do you distinguish between free trade and not-free
trade?

&gt; Immigration Crackdown Worries Employers

&gt;  By JULIANA BARBASSA

&gt;  SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - Farmers and other employers who rely heavily on immigrant labor
&gt; said Friday that they could be driven out of business by the Bush administration's
&gt; plans to crack down on workers whose Social Security numbers do not match their
&gt; names, and businesses that hire them.

&gt; Administration officials said the stepped-up enforcement would begin in 30 days.
">

There will also be a massive effort to streamline the existing temporary
visa worker programs, which is actually a good idea. It will restore the
ability of employers to get _legal_ workers, and the stepped-up enforcement
efforts will tend to force the temporary visa workers back home rather than
letting them stay here.

If you shop at a grocery store, a department store, or even a

corporations.

Just because you're not an the board of directors, you can be hurt if a

I have been railing against the WTO treaty since it was passed (by
something like a one vote margin).
Any look at that 'free' trade agreement should have alerted the most
dense people - had they only take a couple of minutes to look at its
provisions - that the treaty destroys US sovereignty and removes
protections that US citizens had crafted for themselves over two
hundred years ! ! !

Talking to idiots these days, the typical knee-jerk response is; 'Well
yeah.. free trade is good, donchaknow..'

Well it isn't good - not if it comes with treaty requirements to
*remove* all worker safety, environmental, truth in advertising,
labelling, and health inspection, etc steps that the US public had
come to expect.

The globalist neocons are now getting rich by bypassing all of those
safeguards that previously existed.
The recent news of lead paint on baby toys illustrates the point...
Infants are chewing on lead paint, while some globalist immoral money
grubbers pad their cayman island bank accounts.

The WTO has to be dumped if Americans want to avoid having their kids
live at third-world levels.

what's wrong with the world in that it doesn't subscribe to your
plan.  The negative results of mass illegal immigration have been much
discussed lately.  Let me reiterate for you.  The supply/demand lines
of the labor market are depressed, resulting in lower wages and fewer
jobs for those here legally.  The welfare state can ill-afford mass
illegal immigration.  Local communities are tapped out for social
services because of excessive demands, accompanied by a sudden influx
of illegal aliens in the area.

Also, hospitals have been closing, largely due to pressure from
illegals using the expensive emergency room facilities like a family
doctor's office.  Hospitals have to treat people who come to them,
regardless of immigration status, but they don't get paid.  When a
hospital closes, it takes needed medical serevices away from a
community.

Then there is the attack on U.S. sovereignty due to the extreme
misgovernment of the last few decades.  Parts of the country are
falling under another language, another culture, another flag.  Great
public expense is incurred to accommodate the non English speakers.

&gt; &gt; &gt; 2) How will you or I benefit?

&gt; &gt; If you don't care about millions of people entering the country and
&gt; &gt; using fraudulent documents to attain work and social services, if you
&gt; &gt; don't see what that does to us as a whole, you probably won't perceive
&gt; &gt; any benefit for yourself or anyone else.

&gt; That doesn't logically follow. The obligation for presenting your case
&gt; is yours, and yours alone.
&gt; It certainly isn't mine. It can't be.

I have no delusions about convincing you of anything.  I stated my
case.  Most see a problem with the way masses of foreigners enter the
country and gain employment with stolen SSNs.  You don't see a problem
with that.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; You have nothing upon which to base your prediction that I wouldn't
&gt; perceive the benefits if you, in fact, articulate them.

&gt; In fact, I might.
&gt; &gt; Most will be glad to see
&gt; &gt; some measure of long-overdue justice meted out, even if it is a token.

&gt; I don't care what &quot;most&quot; will be glad to see. Most are glad to see

I doubt it.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Justice, qua justice, interests me. But where you seem to see justice, I
&gt; see people who have no real claim to citizenship--beyond a legal fiction
&gt; that says they're &quot;citizens&quot; because of an accident of birth. And these
&gt; people who've done nothing to earn their own franchise are forbidding
&gt; franchise to others.
">

Again, what you think about citizenship is irrelevant.  I know many
people are born in this couintry who have absolutely no interest in
civics or the country they live in, no interest in anything but
getting on with their lives.  But it's not &quot;legal fiction.&quot;  These
same people pay taxes and have certain obligations because of their
status as citizens.  Whether or not they've earned it in your eyes is
immaterial.  If you want to erase the borders and say, &quot;All those in
the western hemisphere are U.S. citizens&quot; I'm sure you can have fun
with that.  In your own mind.  Meanwhile, I'll be writing to my
representatives, thanking them for their support of tighter
immigration laws.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Maybe they have the right to do so, they certainly have a legal right to
&gt; do so, but this equation has little to do with justice.

You mean justice as defined in your own personal lexicon?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Objectively speaking.

&gt; &gt; &gt; 3) What are the negative consequences of such a program/strategy?

&gt; &gt; What are the negative consequences of continuing to do nothing?

&gt; I don't see any negative consequences to myself. The 12 million are
&gt; here, and I haven't missed any meals. I don't think anyone else in this
&gt; nation has, either.

&gt; If they are costing us money by remaining here, there's at least 12

I don't care for that, either.  But it doesn't mean we have to invte
more in.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

That's worse than nothing.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I'm not opposed to supporting such a stroke. For one thing, it is

&gt; I think if something isn't done to ease this shock, the United States
&gt; will face a crisis it hasn't faced since 1932.

Illegal immigrants are not going to bail us out, not by a long shot.
How many bus boys will it take to support one retiree?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; So, in the face of other far more pressing problems that haven't and

&gt; &gt; Fine!  NOW, there is nothing to object to in these simple
&gt; &gt; statements so we come now to the crux of the matter -

&gt; If you wanted to change the subject, you should have just said so.

&gt; &gt; WHERE IN THE HELL WAS IT WRITTEN THAT THE INFLUENCE
&gt; &gt; OF THESE GLOBAL CORPORATIONS, DESPITE ALL THEIR
&gt; &gt; GREAT AND OBVIOUS (MAYBE) BENEFITS, WAS TO BE PLACED
&gt; &gt; AND EXALTED AHEAD OF AND ABOVE THE AMERICAN CITIZEN?

&gt; They aren't. At least not in the sense you seem to mean in the above.
&gt; And, to the extent that they have influence, is the same extent that the
&gt; US government interferes with business.

&gt; Your retirement funds are dependent on some of the largest of these
&gt; international corporations--so your Mommy in Washington is doing what's
&gt; best for baby-kins when she protects the big bad evil multinationals and
&gt; grants them special favors that line their pockets handsomely.

&gt; While I am firmly against any interference at all, I fail to see where
&gt; you've made the case there are ANY bad consequences to you from the WTO
&gt; or from international trade agreements.

&gt; &gt; And, in my opinion, this is exactly what has happened
&gt; &gt; starting from the era of officially approved institutionalized
&gt; &gt; lying known as the &quot;advertising&quot; industry

&gt; That industry began when great granddaddy first climbed out of his tree.

&gt; &gt;  and &quot;marketing&quot;

&gt; Invented the same day...

&gt; &gt; and extending into the present era of &quot;free trade&quot;
&gt; &gt; which constitutes the unreasoning and unrepentant destruction
&gt; &gt; of local jobs and local industries irrespective of the
&gt; &gt; weakening of our economy and even our very defense technologies,
&gt; &gt; in order to pay homage to the globalists bottom line.

&gt; Global commerce is good for Juan, and Chen aand Chiamaka and Abdul--and
&gt; it's good for you, too.

&gt; Competition too much for you?

&gt; &gt; Last time I looked, this was the UNITED STATES of AMERICA,
&gt; &gt; and NOT the United States of Corporation.

&gt; The business of America is business.

&gt; How do you earn your income?

&gt; &gt; I submit that despite all the cheap goods products and services
&gt; &gt; availability, which I freely acknowledge, there must be some serious
&gt; &gt; REIGNS put on &quot;free trade&quot;
&gt; &gt; and on the economy busting WTO agreements and on the demographics
&gt; &gt; and infrastructure busting &quot;immigration&quot; law NON enforcement.

&gt; Why must there be &quot;reigns?&quot;

&gt; Isn't man worthy of freedom?

&gt; Aren't you /really/ asking for protection from YOURSELF?

&gt; &gt; I submit that there are destructive institutionalized cross
&gt; &gt; connections
&gt; &gt; betwee government and industry

&gt; You and I agree to THAT!

&gt; &gt; in the areas of public schools, defense
&gt; &gt; and most certainly the &quot;health&quot; care (sic) industry, which are
&gt; &gt; deleterious
&gt; &gt; to the American citizens and other peoples and I submit that these
&gt; &gt; easy alliances, political combinations and interlocking agencies and
&gt; &gt; businesses
&gt; &gt; need to be investigated, broken apart, brought under control and/or
&gt; &gt; legislated
&gt; &gt; out of existence.

&gt; Listen to your insanity here (no disrespect intended):

&gt; You want your government to exert MORE control, to get MORE involved.
&gt; But you claim that that involvement is the prime culprit in spawning the
&gt; evil of the multinationals.

&gt; You really can't have it both ways.

&gt; &gt; AND, until that kind of reform occurs, THERE WILL BE A PRICE to pay
&gt; &gt; for all those cheap goods and services - AND THE PRICE WILL INCLUDE
&gt; &gt; BRIDGES THAT COLLAPSE AND KILL PEOPLE,

&gt; You've established no cause and effect here. Really, you've not even
&gt; established a correlation.

&gt; If I'm to take your ideas seriously, it's your responsibility to provide
&gt; me with a reason to do so.

&gt; &gt; OUT IN NEW STRAINS AND KILL HUNDREDS OR THOUSANDS OR HUNDREDS OF
&gt; &gt; THOUSANDS OR MILLIONS, SCHOOLS WHOSE GOALS ARE MERE SUBJECTION AND
&gt; &gt; CONTROL RATHER THAN TEACHING ANYTHING AT ALL, WATER SUPPLIES THAT RUN,
&gt; &gt; HOSPITALS THAT ARE NO LONGER ABLE TO FUNCTION... AND SO ON.

&gt; Isolation isn't a cure.

&gt; &gt; &gt; If you shop at a grocery store, a department store, or even a
&gt; &gt; &gt; convenience store, you share benefits from successful global
&gt; &gt; &gt; corporations...

&gt; &gt; BUT... there are CONSEQUENCES to these wonderful &quot;benefits&quot;,

&gt; Mostly good ones for all of us.

3. Does the presence of illegal immigrants drive down wages for American
workers?

Yes, a little.

Several recent studies have demonstrated that one segment of workers in
particular – the lowest-paid, lowest-skilled Americans – find their wages
depressed across the board by illegal immigrants. (The decrease is 5 percent
in one study, 7.2 percent in the other.) African and Hispanic American workers
are hit especially hard, due to their disproportionately large representation
in this economic demographic.

The same thing is true with illegal immigration in the United States. In 1986,
there were an estimated 3 million illegal immigrants in the United States. In
response, Congress passed the Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA), which
provided amnesty for undocumented immigrants already present in the country.
IRCA provided $1 billion for four fiscal years to reimburse states for the
public assistance, health, and education costs that resulted from legalizing
these illegal immigrants. Many researchers have found that this total, which
when adjusted for inflation is nearly $7.5 billion, was wholly inadequate to
cover the true cost that came with granting blanket amnesty to 3 million
illegal immigrants.

Over 20 years later, we now estimate that there are anywhere from 11 to 20
million illegal immigrants in the United States. If we rightly assume that it
would at least take what was inadequately allotted in 1986 to cover the burden
of cost, we could say that the government would have to provide states with
anywhere from $26.5 billion to nearly $50 billion to cover the burden of cost
caused by illegal immigration!

Your cite doesn't especially address the point that was being made.
We're all aware that illegal immigrants often find jobs that pay lower
than the minimum wage.

&quot;Studies have shown...&quot; and &quot;estimates are&quot; isn't a very reliable cite
within your cite. For one thing, such generalized terminology prevents
me, the reader, from examining methodology.

The point was that legal residents and citizens are being negatively
affected by the low wages being paid to illegal immigrant workers.

I found a credible cite yesterday just by chance. This was in National
Review from June (it may or may not be on the internet at National
Review Online):

&quot;But that does not exhaust the economic argument. It is well known that
immigration redistributes income from the poor to the rich as immigrants
are willing to work for lower wages than native-born Americans. As a
result, it reduces the incomes and jobs opportunities of blacks and
other low-paid Americans. Three economists who specialize in the
economics of immigration---George Borjas, Jeffrey Grogger , and Gordon
Hanson--recently addressed the question of whether immigration had any
relationship with the relatively high imprisonment rates for black
Americans in a paper for the National Bureau of Economic Research. They
concluded: The 1980-2000 immigrant influx...generally 'explains' about
20 to 60 percent of the decline in wages, 25 percent of the decline in
employment, and about 10 percent of the rise in incarceration rates
among blacks with a high-school education or less.&quot; (They found similar
but lesser effects for low-paid white Americans.&quot;

From &quot;Comprehensively Awful:
What President Bush and Senator Kennedy Have Wrought&quot;
By John O'Sullivan
National Review, June 11, 2007
Vol. LIX, No. 10, pg 29

The problem I have understanding these results, is the fact that
throughout this large influx, the employment rate in the United States
has remained at 5% to 6%. I was taught in economics classes that this
is, essentially, full employment.

Full employment with an extra 12 million illegal immigrants.

Help me out here--what am I missing?

From the same article:

&quot;To repeat the essential economic facts about immigration: its net
impact on the living standards of native-born Americans is basically a
wash. The National Academy of Sciences estimated that it amounted to
between $1 billion and $10 billion in 1997--negligible sums in an
economy worth about $8 trillion that year...&quot;

I don't see the significant economic impact in any of this--though
evidently it affects lower income Americans in measurable ways.

The only reason this legislation is being seriously proposed is to save
the Social Security System, anyway.

And, in the absence of legalizing the immigrant guest workers--I see no
proposed solutions for that one.

And that one will kill us if we wait.

And, even those who seem to understand the impending catastrophe, most
seem willing to wait.

Which seems to be why Bush was pushing it at this particular time...
