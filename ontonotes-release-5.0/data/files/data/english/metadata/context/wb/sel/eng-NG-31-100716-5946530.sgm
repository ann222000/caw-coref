Theory 1:
The governments conspiracy theory...yada...yada.
How did the buildings(all three)fall?  I'd like this explained to me
in a non-McCaine more or less layman's scientific terms; i.e. did the
steel melt/weaken(weaken enough to cause catastrophe)?  if it did how
far down into the building would it have melted/weakend? Why did the
collapse of the buildings(all three)look like(to a layman at
least)controlled demolition?  in other words why did the buildings
fall in such a non-chaotic fashion? etc.

non-government conspiracy theory...yada...yada
Is it even possible for operatives to place explosives inside these 3
buildings without being seen, heard?  I imagine if this theory is
correct that these operatives were disguised as maintainence men/women
of some sort.  How would they have gotten past the maintainence
supervisor(s), security and what excuse would they have used for being
there for the time required to place 'x' amount of explosives by 'y'
amount of operatives?
etc.

Gravity made the buildings come straight down.  The taller the building the greater its effect.  Buildings as tall as the WTC buildings can't even topple as they can't develop enough lateral momentum to overcome their rapid straight-down descent.  We saw that phenomenon when WTC#2 started to lean above the damaged floors, but nevertheless came straight down.

Explosives were'nt necessary, so I'll leave that to the conspiracy theorists to prove.

If this is not layman enough, try re-enrolling for school.

Keep in mind that only CTists are using the term "melting" when
referring to the steel. They need to since it gives infers an ounce of
credibility in the discussion evern though it is not needed to prove
collapse.

T:  What do they mean in the article when it states that(and I
quote):  "The buildings were hit by aircraft?"  I don't get it...

T:  What does this word 'gravity' mean?  I've seen it before but I'm
not sure where.  Isn't gravity a severe case?  Like in when the judge,
when you're up before the judge and he/she says to you: 'be aware of
the gravity of your situation'.  Like how does this tie into the WTC
attacks by some kind of plane?
