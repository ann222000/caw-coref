TEL AVIV, Israel, Aug. 18 (UPI) -- Internet addiction should be grouped with
extreme addictive disorders such as gambling, sex addiction and kleptomania,
an Israeli psychiatrist said.

Dr. Pinhas Dannon of Tel Aviv University's Sackler Faculty of Medicine said
10 percent of Internet surfers are afflicted with &quot;Internet addiction
disorder,&quot; which can lead to anxiety and severe depression.

Internet addiction is classified by mental health professionals as an
Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, a mild to severe mental health condition that
results in an urge to engage in ritualistic thoughts and behavior.

&quot;Internet addiction is not manifesting itself as an 'urge.' It's more than
that. It's a deep 'craving.' And if we don't make the change in the way we
classify Internet addiction, we won't be able to treat it in the proper
way,&quot; Dannon said Friday in a release.

He said the two groups at greatest risk from Internet addiction disorder are
teenagers and people in their mid-50s suffering from the loneliness of an
empty nest

Like continually cutting and pasting articles from various sources

Get help, J. Young, before it is too late. :-)

I have no idea why he likes to post to alt.homosexuality so much.
Seems to me he would notice that he isn't well-received in alt.homosexuality
and just not post to it.
Do you think he has a 'messiah complex' somehow and wants to save all gays
and athiests or what?
Maybe he has more patience than a rock on the south side of a tree that
wants some moss to grow on it.

&gt; TEL AVIV, Israel, Aug. 18 (UPI) -- Internet addiction should be grouped with
&gt; extreme addictive disorders such as gambling, sex addiction and kleptomania,
&gt; an Israeli psychiatrist said.

&gt; Dr. Pinhas Dannon of Tel Aviv University's Sackler Faculty of Medicine said
&gt; 10 percent of Internet surfers are afflicted with &quot;Internet addiction
&gt; disorder,&quot; which can lead to anxiety and severe depression.

&gt; Internet addiction is classified by mental health professionals as an
&gt; Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, a mild to severe mental health condition that
&gt; results in an urge to engage in ritualistic thoughts and behavior.

&gt; &quot;Internet addiction is not manifesting itself as an 'urge.' It's more than
&gt; that. It's a deep 'craving.' And if we don't make the change in the way we
&gt; classify Internet addiction, we won't be able to treat it in the proper
&gt; way,&quot; Dannon said Friday in a release.

&gt; He said the two groups at greatest risk from Internet addiction disorder are
&gt; teenagers and people in their mid-50s suffering from the loneliness of an
&gt; empty nest

Thats news to me that &quot;Internet Addiction&quot; is an OCD.

Perhaps you should Google &quot;define:OCD&quot;

&quot;Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder is an anxiety disorder characterized by
intense, recurrent, unwanted thoughts and rituals that are beyond the
person's control.&quot;

Then Google &quot;define:&quot;internet addiction&quot;

&quot;Internet addiction disorder (IAD) is a theorized disorder coined by
Ivan Goldberg, M.D., in 1997. It is compared to Pathological Gambling
as diagnosed by the DSM-IV. Dr. Goldberg, along with Kimberly Young,
Psy.D. are currently lobbying for the inclusion of IAD into the DSM-
IV, which would open the doors for insurance companies to pay out for
internet addiction counseling.&quot;

Then Google &quot;define:&quot;pathological gambling&quot;

&quot;Pathological gambling, as defined by American Psychiatric Association
is an impulse control disorder associated with gambling. It is a
chronic and progresive mental illness. It is estimated that 4-6% of
gamblers are subject to the disease and that adolescents are three
times more succeptible than adults.&quot;

Then Google &quot;define:&quot;impulse control disorder&quot;

&quot;Impulse control disorder is a set of brain disorders including
Intermittent Explosive Disorder (hot-headedness), Kleptomania
(stealing), Pathological Gambling, Pyromania (fire-starting) and
Trichotillomania (pulling one's hair out).&quot;

Conclusion &quot;Internet addiction&quot; is not an Obsessive Compulsive
Disorder but is more akin to an Impulse Control Disorder which is a
completely different mental disorder.

But tell me, how is your OP significant to the five newsgroups you
have posted it to?

Most of the time I don't worry about it because of the particulars of the
case.
Now and then it really irks me that the government would be holding false
charges against me that tax paid criminals who assaulted and kidnapped and
committed perjury and fraud and extortion against me wrote up against me.
But, knowing the laws and the statutes and my constitutional rights assures
me that justice will be performed for my benefit.

Oh, yeah. I left out the matter of the thefts that were performed against me
by the unruly tax leech horde.

I wonder how they will feel when their crimes are EXPOSED!
And, I wonder how they feel knowing that a misbehaved piss ant wopboy named
Giovanni who was born in 1982 attacked me and lied about me?
I wonder how they even sleep at night with the knowledge of their
ass-licking of a nigger and a wop?
LOL!
HAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!
I like berating such idiots.
Makes me feel good while it makes them look like total dogshit.
I think I will restore the alt.politics.homo group on this response because
I know some of you get the crap hurled at you too often at times it seems.
My newsreader will probably delete any response that is directed to
alt-politics.homosexuality though, at least in the interim.
Maybe we can work together to restore sanity to the USA.

&gt;&gt; TEL AVIV, Israel, Aug. 18 (UPI) -- Internet addiction should be grouped
&gt;&gt; with
&gt;&gt; extreme addictive disorders such as gambling, sex addiction and
&gt;&gt; kleptomania,
&gt;&gt; an Israeli psychiatrist said.

&gt; Publish or perish, but if he is right, J. Young is a case in point.

&gt;&gt; Internet addiction is classified by mental health professionals as an
&gt;&gt; Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, a mild to severe mental health condition
&gt;&gt; that
&gt;&gt; results in an urge to engage in ritualistic thoughts and behavior.

&gt; Like continually cutting and pasting articles from various sources

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Why must you post in quoted-printable?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; OK, I told you that at least a thousand of times last year, I'll write
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it one last time: I use Google and all I do is answer, write and send.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I am not doing anything and I &quot;must not post in quoted-printable&quot;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; since I don't have the faintest idea what this is.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Besides, since you're the ONLY one afflicted with that problem, i
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; think the problem is yours, not mine.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Still looks to me as your personal tactic to prevent persons from responding
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to you when the trail is missing.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Don't blame me, because it isn't my posts that are changing content type.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It's yours.-

&gt; &gt; &gt; Well, it's all in your head, Wentzky. Because I AM NOT DOING ANYTHING.

&gt; &gt; Says the k00k that loses accounts.....LOL-

&gt; What's happening, gaybob? Only 42 &quot;clicks&quot; on my one-star rating?
&gt; What's holding you? Too busy trolling in discussion groups about
&gt; homosexuality?
&gt; BTW, you also lost an account... so what's the big deal?

Wrong!

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; That's all you have against me, gaybob? My rating (that you seem to be
&gt; the only one to take interest in)

That's what they ALL say when it's bad :-)

and the fact that I lost an account

&gt; &gt; &gt; TEL AVIV, Israel, Aug. 18 (UPI) -- Internet addiction should be grouped with
&gt; &gt; &gt; extreme addictive disorders such as gambling, sex addiction and kleptomania,
&gt; &gt; &gt; an Israeli psychiatrist said.

&gt; &gt; &lt;snip&gt;

&gt; &gt; Publish or perish, but if he is right, J. Young is a case in point.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Internet addiction is classified by mental health professionals as an
&gt; &gt; &gt; Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, a mild to severe mental health condition that
&gt; &gt; &gt; results in an urge to engage in ritualistic thoughts and behavior.

&gt; &gt; Like continually cutting and pasting articles from various sources
&gt; &gt; into usenet news groups, regardless of how appropriate they are?

&gt; &gt; Get help, J. Young, before it is too late. :-)

&gt; Then hell, there are others in need of help too.  How often do we see
&gt; Keegan flooding alt.abortion with tons of articles related to things,
&gt; other than abortion?
&gt; Even I'm guilty of doing that.  Not nearly to the extent of Keegan,

You flood the newsgroups with lies.

What's worse?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; this time you posted in:

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; and, no absence of the delimiters occurred.-

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Don't you have more important things to worry about, Wentzky?  Like
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; your upcoming felony trial and a nice prison term?

&gt; &gt; &gt; Oh, yeah. I left out the matter of the thefts that were performed against me
&gt; &gt; &gt; by the unruly tax leech horde.
&gt; &gt; &gt; LOL!
&gt; &gt; &gt; HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH!

&gt; &gt; Oh, my!

&gt; &gt; &gt; I wonder how they feel to be such idiots?

&gt; &gt; Ummm... honey... THEY'RE not the idiots.  Know what I'm saying?

&gt; &gt; &gt; I wonder how they will feel when their crimes are EXPOSED!
&gt; &gt; &gt; And, I wonder how they feel knowing that a misbehaved piss ant wopboy named
&gt; &gt; &gt; Giovanni who was born in 1982 attacked me and lied about me?

&gt; &gt; Gio has your assault on him on tape.

&gt; &gt; &gt; I wonder how they even sleep at night

&gt; &gt; They go like this:  Zzzzzz.

&gt; &gt; &gt; LOL!
&gt; &gt; &gt; HAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!

&gt; &gt; Oh!

&gt; &gt; &gt; I like berating such idiots.

&gt; &gt; Then you should enjoy it even more when they kick your ass behind
&gt; &gt; prison walls.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Maybe we can work together to restore sanity to the USA.

&gt; &gt; Well... ummm... how are you going to do that when you're sitting in
&gt; &gt; prison?

&gt; Or while you're eating another piece of shit....
