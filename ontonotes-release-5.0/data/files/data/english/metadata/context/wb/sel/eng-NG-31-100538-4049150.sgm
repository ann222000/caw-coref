406 remote key - again!

Hi,

I’ve spent the past few months trying in vain to get a remote locking
fob for my 406 (1996).

My dealer refuses to assist me in any way, so speaking to another
garage, plus advice on here I’ve done a bit of digging around in the
car.

I have an aftermarket key at present, with no remote. I’ve checked the
headlining near the courtesy mirror, there’s nothing there. I’ve
removed the glovebox, and using the Haynes manual as a guide, I think
I’ve located what may be the remote receiver behind an access panel.

The unit in question was the upper of the units, is black, marked with
a Valeo ELE brand, followed by a number, then "K6 - Made in UK",
then followed by a barcode. I’ve taken down all the details and have
taken a photo of the unit out of the vehicle.

Have I located the remote receiver, or is it looking like I’m going to
have to keep digging? If it is, what details do I need to give to the
dealer to pull his finger out and get the thing ordered? And what else
should I be aware of?

Any assistance you can give will be greatly appreciated.

Hi, why do you need to locate and remove the rx unit of the remote
locking?. I’m not really up on that age vehicle, but I think that you
could order a key fob from another dealer, If the key blade is not
removable you may have to order a cut key/fob from Peugeot. If key
blade is removable buy one from ebay or from online spares guys, or
scrappy. If the key contains a RFID chip, remember to change this from
the working key to your new key. However if you got an after market
key to work it maybe hasn’t got an immo.

That’s just the problem. The aftermarket key I have is just a blob of
plastic with a key in it. It contains no electronics at all.

Does your blob of plastic start the car?. If yes the car has no immo
cicuit in key. The original key only contains a remote locker.
I suggest taking your car to another dealer with the instruction.
"supply new remote key". The whole deal will be done for about £70,
you seem to have spent that in time already looking for the answer
yourself.

Just been to another Peugeot dealer in another town, who have looked
up my chassis number on Laser, and have confirmed that the part behind
the glovebox is indeed the remote receiver.

They’ve told me that to supply a fob/key, they will need to supply a
new receiver as they are apparently only available as a matched set -
ie receiver, and two remotes. For that (and that is with me fitting it
myself) they’ve quoted £300 plus VAT!

Anybody know if what they’ve told me is indeed true? At least this
dealer appears to be more helpful, but I get the feeling they’re
trying to maximise the amount they can get from me.

From what I can remember about these early 406s, the immobiliser part
is in the keypad. So the key just opens the car and turns the
ignition, if the keypad is set. You can make the key work the keypad,
so you don't have to enter the 4 digit code. But first you need the
plip key, and there lies the problem. When the car was new, it had 2
keys. If you opened them up, inside is a small piece of paper with a
code number on it and the word "pri" for primary, or "sec" for
secondary. this number is needed to order a key to work with the
receiver in the car. You have no original key and therefore no code
number to order any. So the second dealer is correct. There is a faint
hope that if you can get into your receiver there may be the code
printed on a small tag somewhere. I have never had to do that so I
don't really know. If there is then you can order 1 or 2 keys from
that, otherwise you need  a new receiver as well.
Hope that is clear.

If it is the original receiver with the car you can order a key on the
chassisnr.

Did that in Holland some years ago...
Also if you have a used key you can change the code with some resoldering.
Just find a datasheet of the receiver-transmitter IC wich is the same in the
transmitter and receiver.

That was true with 1st gen of IR systems based on TEA5500, but I don't know

another code.

Am I correct in thinking that there’s a possibility that if I got a
receiver and set of fobs from a breakers it will work? (Obviously with
the correct key blades for my car). There’s a breakers near me with
several 406’s, if this is possible I may pay them a visit.

I’m trying to avoid having to pay a huge amount for a set of keys. At
some point I’ve got to get a key as the one I’ve got is wearing quite
badly. It would be ideal to have remote locking, as often in my job I
have to carry large items to and from the car, and not having to
fumble with my keys would be a bonus.

&gt; &gt; &gt; secondary. this number is needed to order a key to work
&gt; with
&gt; &gt; &gt; the
&gt; &gt; &gt; receiver in the car. You have no original key and
&gt; therefore no
&gt; &gt; &gt; code
&gt; &gt; &gt; number to order any. So the second dealer is correct.
&gt; There is
&gt; &gt; &gt; a faint
&gt; &gt; &gt; hope that if you can get into your receiver there may be
&gt; the
&gt; &gt; &gt; code
&gt; &gt; &gt; printed on a small tag somewhere. I have never had to do
&gt; that
&gt; &gt; &gt; so I
&gt; &gt; &gt; don't really know. If there is then you can order 1 or 2
&gt; keys
&gt; &gt; &gt; from
&gt; &gt; &gt; that, otherwise you need  a new receiver as well.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Hope that is clear.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;So the code is for the receiver + 2 fob set? So there’s no
&gt; way at all
&gt; &gt;for Peugeot to obtain a code from what I already have?
&gt; I don't think so.
&gt; &gt;What format (ie length etc) are the codes normally? There’s
&gt; &gt;information printed on the outside of the receiver, however
&gt; I’ll take
&gt; &gt;it out again this weekend and take a look inside to check if
&gt; there’s
&gt; &gt;another code.
&gt; 6 to 8 digits IIRC
&gt; &gt;Am I correct in thinking that there’s a possibility that if I
&gt; got a
&gt; &gt;receiver and set of fobs from a breakers it will work?
&gt; (Obviously with
&gt; &gt;the correct key blades for my car). There’s a breakers near
&gt; me with
&gt; &gt;several 406’s, if this is possible I may pay them a visit.
&gt; Yes that would work, and be your best option I guess
&gt; &gt;I’m trying to avoid having to pay a huge amount for a set of
&gt; keys. At
&gt; &gt;some point I’ve got to get a key as the one I’ve got is
&gt; wearing quite
&gt; &gt;badly. It would be ideal to have remote locking, as often in
&gt; my job I
&gt; &gt;have to carry large items to and from the car, and not having
&gt; to
&gt; &gt;fumble with my keys would be a bonus.
&gt; Breakers it is then! And  I would imagine around £50 at a
&gt; guess.

And it all ends on a happy note.

Went to the local dealers again today, as they were a bit short
staffed, spoke to the Parts manager about what I’d been through. He
went out the back, and a few minutes later brought with him a box
containing the receiver and 2 plips.

I expected him to quote the £300 the other dealer had done, but he’d
told me he got them in for another job, and weren’t used, and had been
sat on the shelf for a long time. I could have the complete set for
£80. I nearly ripped his hand off!

Installed it in less than 10 minutes, and it works. Only thing is the
smaller button does nothing, but I’m happy the car locks/unlocks with
the plip.

Now to search the forums for how to link my immobiliser with the key.

The small button is for the deadlocks on the 406 you may not have these on
yours. It is a good idea not to use this facility as it is the major cause
of lock failure .

&gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I suggest taking your car to another dealer with the
&gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; instruction. &quot;supply new remote key&quot;. The whole deal
&gt;  &gt; will
&gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; be
&gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; done for about £70, you seem to have spent that in
&gt;  &gt; time
&gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; already looking for the answer yourself.
&gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; T.

&gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Just been to another Peugeot dealer in another town, who
&gt;  &gt; have
&gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; looked
&gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;up my chassis number on Laser, and have confirmed that
&gt;  &gt; the
&gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; part behind
&gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;the glovebox is indeed the remote receiver.

&gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;They've told me that to supply a fob/key, they will need
&gt;  &gt; to
&gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; supply a
&gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;new receiver as they are apparently only available as a
&gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; matched set -
&gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;ie receiver, and two remotes. For that (and that is with
&gt;  &gt; me
&gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; fitting it
&gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;myself) they've quoted £300 plus VAT!

&gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Anybody know if what they've told me is indeed true? At
&gt;  &gt; least
&gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; this
&gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;dealer appears to be more helpful, but I get the feeling
&gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; they're
&gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;trying to maximise the amount they can get from me.
&gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; From what I can remember about these early 406s, the
&gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; immobiliser part
&gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; is in the keypad. So the key just opens the car and turns
&gt;  &gt; the
&gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; ignition, if the keypad is set. You can make the key work
&gt;  &gt; the
&gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; keypad,
&gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; so you don't have to enter the 4 digit code. But first you
&gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; need the
&gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; plip key, and there lies the problem. When the car was
&gt;  &gt; new, it
&gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; had 2
&gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; keys. If you opened them up, inside is a small piece of
&gt;  &gt; paper
&gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; with a
&gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; code number on it and the word &quot;pri&quot; for primary, or &quot;sec&quot;
&gt;  &gt; for
&gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; secondary. this number is needed to order a key to work
&gt;  &gt; with
&gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; the
&gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; receiver in the car. You have no original key and
&gt;  &gt; therefore no
&gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; code
&gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; number to order any. So the second dealer is correct.
&gt;  &gt; There is
&gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; a faint
&gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; hope that if you can get into your receiver there may be

&gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; code

&gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; so I
&gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; don't really know. If there is then you can order 1 or 2

I also own a 96 406 1.8.
Having the TEA5500 in it.
Resoldered a 405 remote works perfectly.

&gt; Hi,

&gt;&gt; Also if you have a used key you can change the code with some
&gt;&gt; resoldering.
&gt; That was true with 1st gen of IR systems based on TEA5500, but I don't
&gt; know
&gt; for more up-to-date systems.

Ok, since it's a TEA5500-based unit. Damn I'm pretty surprised they've fit
these units until so late !
