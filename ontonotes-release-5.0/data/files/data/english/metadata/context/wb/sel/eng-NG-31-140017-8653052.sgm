For Pete's sake
Angry Kendall deserves better from Jets

By Gary Myers - NY Daily News

Pete Kendall hurt his back in the Jets' loss to the Chargers in the
eighth game of the dismal 2005 season. They had already lost Chad
Pennington and Jay Fiedler for the season. They pulled Vinny Testaverde
off the couch weeks earlier and he got hurt against the Chargers. So did
Wayne Chrebet, who suffered a career-ending concussion.

The season was over at 2-6. The next week the Jets were in Carolina with
Brooks Bollinger at quarterback. They would lose, 30-3. Kendall, who had
moved over from left guard to play out of position at center with Kevin
Mawae injured, took one for the team and played against the Panthers
with his bad back.

In fact, he took three injections for the team. Three needles to get him
on the field.

&quot;I took three shots to play in the Carolina game,&quot; Kendall said. &quot;Two
before the game and one at halftime. Then I had to get shot up before
every game for probably the next six or seven weeks. I took about 10,
just in my back. I've always had to get something numbed up - a finger
or wrist. That's just part of the business. To me, playing with a back
injury, I don't deserve a medal for it, but I don't think every guy who
ever played would do it either.

&quot;I remember in Carolina after I was shot up the first time - I can't go.
They said, 'Can we try again?' I said, 'Yeah.' I just look back and that
obviously wasn't the right decision to have made. I just felt this
obligation to my coaches and my teammates to go do the best I could.

Ultimately, it was used against me. They asked me to take a pay cut.&quot;

This is the ugly side of the NFL. You would think the Jets would take
care of Kendall, a good player and one of the team leaders. They never
have to worry about getting phone calls at 3 a.m. from the police, which
is probably worth the extra $1million he wants by itself. In a league
where mug shots have replaced team pictures, the Jets should embrace
Kendall instead of alienating him.

Instead of taking care of Kendall, they are picking on him. They got so
childish they assigned him to the rookie dorm at camp, although they
switched it when he protested. He was clearly being punished for
skipping the offseason program and speaking his mind about his contract.
Eric Mangini says the dorm assignment was a mistake, but this is a coach
who micromanages everything, right down to the Mozart songs being played
at practice.

Here's the hypocrisy of the NFL: the Jets had no problem cutting
Kendall's money after a bad 2005 season when he had three years left on
his deal, but now claim they can't restore his money after a good year
because he has a contract with three years left and it would set a bad
precedent. That's ludicrous. You can't have it both ways.

Kendall did not play well in '05. He was hurt, the team was bad, he
started the final nine games out of position. He had just finished the
second year of a five-year contract he signed with the Jets after the
Cardinals let him go. Curtis Martin led the NFL in rushing for the only
time in his Hall of Fame career in Kendall's first season with the Jets.

Kendall made $3million in each of his first two years. He was due to
make $3million in the third year and $4.5 million in each of the last
two years. When the Jets reworked his contract after the 2005 season,
they added $300,000 to his '06 pay and then cut his salary to $1.7
million this year, $2 million in 2008 and added on an additional year at
$2.3 million in 2009. None of that money is guaranteed.

Kendall insists when he reworked the deal with GM Mike Tannenbaum, they
had an understanding that the Jets would get him back to the $3million
level if he played well in 2006. Kendall did his part in the Jets'
revival under Mangini. He started 14 games and played between left
tackle D'Brickashaw Ferguson and center Nick Mangold, the Jets' rookie
No.1 picks. Kendall was a mentor to both and the Jets admit he had a
very good season as they made the playoffs.

Kendall then asked the Jets to bump him back to the $3million level this
year, minus the extra $300,000 they gave him in 2006. That means he
wants a $1 million raise, getting him to $2.7 million, a bargain
considering the way the market has exploded for guards the last two
years.

&quot;Mike has agreed I have a rational case, a reasonable request,&quot; Kendall
said.

The Jets won't give him the money and, to this point, won't cut him.
Mangini is alternating him with the first team in practice.

Maybe they are waiting for a guard to get hurt at someone else's
training camp to give them leverage in making a trade. Nobody needs to
throw Kendall a benefit. He is 34 years old and making $1.7 million. He
has played 11 years in the NFL. Still, everything is relative. The
salary cap is $109 million. The Jets should take care of their own.

He had their back. They should have his.

Yeah, the more you hear about the Kendall situation, the more bush league the
Jets start to seem.

If you don't want to give the guy a raise, fine. But sticking a dependable,
grizzled vet in the rookie dorm is childish at best... I don't care if he's
been bitching about his contract or not.

If D'Brickshaw or Mangold pulled this stunt, I'd bet alot they'd be getting
more respect than Kendall but who knows, maybe there is more going on behind
the scenes in the Kendall-Mangenius war.

Three things:

1.  While I admire him for &quot;taking shots for the team&quot;, this does not
make him unique.  I can probably find about 100 other players who did
the same thing and are *not* bitching about their contract.  It's part
of the business, right or wrong.

2.  I can't speak to the rookie dorm thing, but he was assigned to the
second team because he did not participate in any of the off-season
program.  As Mangini is a disciple of Parcells and Belichick, how does
this surprise anyone?

3.  Myers tries to make the argument that the Jets are hypocrites for
making him take a pay cut after a bad year, but then not restoring his
salary after a good year.  However, it seems perfectly reasonable to
Myers when players sign long term deals and enjoy the security of a
multi-year contract, then a year in start crying they want to
renegotiate.

&gt; Pete Kendall hurt his back in the Jets' loss to the Chargers in the

&gt; Pennington and Jay Fiedler for the season. They pulled Vinny
Testaverde

did
&gt; Wayne Chrebet, who suffered a career-ending concussion.

&gt; before the game and one at halftime. Then I had to get shot up before

&gt; just in my back. I've always had to get something numbed up - a finger

&gt; injury, I don't deserve a medal for it, but I don't think every guy
who
&gt; ever played would do it either.

&gt; precedent. That's ludicrous. You can't have it both ways.

&gt; Kendall did not play well in '05. He was hurt, the team was bad, he
&gt; started the final nine games out of position. He had just finished the
&gt; second year of a five-year contract he signed with the Jets after the
&gt; Cardinals let him go. Curtis Martin led the NFL in rushing for the
only
&gt; time in his Hall of Fame career in Kendall's first season with the
Jets.

&gt; Kendall made $3million in each of his first two years. He was due to
&gt; make $3million in the third year and $4.5 million in each of the last
&gt; two years. When the Jets reworked his contract after the 2005 season,
&gt; they added $300,000 to his '06 pay and then cut his salary to $1.7
&gt; million this year, $2 million in 2008 and added on an additional year
at
&gt; $2.3 million in 2009. None of that money is guaranteed.

&gt; Kendall insists when he reworked the deal with GM Mike Tannenbaum,

&gt; revival under Mangini. He started 14 games and played between left

&gt; very good season as they made the playoffs.

&gt; Kendall then asked the Jets to bump him back to the $3million level
this
&gt; year, minus the extra $300,000 they gave him in 2006. That means he
&gt; wants a $1 million raise, getting him to $2.7 million, a bargain
&gt; considering the way the market has exploded for guards the last two
&gt; years.

Kendall

&gt; Maybe they are waiting for a guard to get hurt at someone else's
&gt; training camp to give them leverage in making a trade. Nobody needs to
&gt; throw Kendall a benefit. He is 34 years old and making $1.7 million.
He
&gt; has played 11 years in the NFL. Still, everything is relative. The
&gt; salary cap is $109 million. The Jets should take care of their own.

&gt; He had their back. They should have his.

For Pete's sake
Angry Kendall deserves better from Jets

By Gary Myers - NY Daily News

Pete Kendall hurt his back in the Jets' loss to the Chargers in the
eighth game of the dismal 2005 season. They had already lost Chad
Pennington and Jay Fiedler for the season. They pulled Vinny Testaverde
off the couch weeks earlier and he got hurt against the Chargers. So did
Wayne Chrebet, who suffered a career-ending concussion.

The season was over at 2-6. The next week the Jets were in Carolina with
Brooks Bollinger at quarterback. They would lose, 30-3. Kendall, who had
moved over from left guard to play out of position at center with Kevin
Mawae injured, took one for the team and played against the Panthers
with his bad back.

In fact, he took three injections for the team. Three needles to get him
on the field.

&quot;I took three shots to play in the Carolina game,&quot; Kendall said. &quot;Two
before the game and one at halftime. Then I had to get shot up before
every game for probably the next six or seven weeks. I took about 10,
just in my back. I've always had to get something numbed up - a finger
or wrist. That's just part of the business. To me, playing with a back
injury, I don't deserve a medal for it, but I don't think every guy who
ever played would do it either.

&quot;I remember in Carolina after I was shot up the first time - I can't go.
They said, 'Can we try again?' I said, 'Yeah.' I just look back and that
obviously wasn't the right decision to have made. I just felt this
obligation to my coaches and my teammates to go do the best I could.

Ultimately, it was used against me. They asked me to take a pay cut.&quot;

This is the ugly side of the NFL. You would think the Jets would take
care of Kendall, a good player and one of the team leaders. They never
have to worry about getting phone calls at 3 a.m. from the police, which
is probably worth the extra $1million he wants by itself. In a league
where mug shots have replaced team pictures, the Jets should embrace
Kendall instead of alienating him.

Instead of taking care of Kendall, they are picking on him. They got so
childish they assigned him to the rookie dorm at camp, although they
switched it when he protested. He was clearly being punished for
skipping the offseason program and speaking his mind about his contract.
Eric Mangini says the dorm assignment was a mistake, but this is a coach
who micromanages everything, right down to the Mozart songs being played
at practice.

Here's the hypocrisy of the NFL: the Jets had no problem cutting
Kendall's money after a bad 2005 season when he had three years left on
his deal, but now claim they can't restore his money after a good year
because he has a contract with three years left and it would set a bad

Finally something I agree with Marvin on.  I understand they have the cap to worry about, but this Revis thing seems penny-wise and pound-foolish.  Tannenbaum seems to be fumbling this one badly.

I too have been a fan since those very same days, I too agree the Jets
have turned into nothing more than a penny-pinching, bottom line
organization. I remain a fan because I have always and WILL always
support my beloved New York Jets ( but I wish the old man would sell
( I almost said pass, but thats a little to crude....that is only
reserved for Al Davis) so that someone who cares more about the &quot;
team&quot; and winning and the players might take over. I have a bad back
and have had those same injections and epidurals and TPI's and pills
and so forth. Am about to have knee replacement surgery due to the
loss of meniscus ( a la Curtis), so these injuries that these guys
have endured are certainly not foreign to me. ANYONE who forgoes the
option of going on the DL, who is wiling to step it up and hop in at
the &quot;CENTER&quot; position of all places...take a feww shots to do it too?
Come on, you know....it isn't like a pac Man or a Mike Vick or ( much
worse) Ryan Leaf!!!!

Hey, what happened to loyalty? How long ago did the management at Gang
Green Central toss it out? Was it with the Tuna? With Herm? With Joe
Willie?

Someone tel Pete, if the my Jets won't treat him right, endure it for
one year ( see &quot;Strahan&quot; ) and then the Chargers might have room for
ya at...wait....they are cheap too. Sigh.... CFL? Do they pay?

&gt; Ultimately, it was used against me. They asked me to take a pay cut.&quot;

&gt; This is the ugly side of the NFL. You would think the Jets would take
&gt; care of Kendall, a good player and one of the team leaders. They never
&gt; have to worry about getting phone calls at 3 a.m. from the police, which
&gt; is probably worth the extra $1million he wants by itself. In a league
&gt; where mug shots have replaced team pictures, the Jets should embrace
&gt; Kendall instead of alienating him.

&gt; Instead of taking care of Kendall, they are picking on him. They got so
&gt; childish they assigned him to the rookie dorm at camp, although they
&gt; switched it when he protested. He was clearly being punished for
&gt; skipping the offseason program and speaking his mind about his contract.
&gt; Eric Mangini says the dorm assignment was a mistake, but this is a coach
&gt; who micromanages everything, right down to the Mozart songs being played
&gt; at practice.

&gt; Here's the hypocrisy of the NFL: the Jets had no problem cutting
&gt; Kendall's money after a bad 2005 season when he had three years left on
&gt; his deal, but now claim they can't restore his money after a good year
&gt; because he has a contract with three years left and it would set a bad
&gt; precedent. That's ludicrous. You can't have it both ways.

&gt; Kendall did not play well in '05. He was hurt, the team was bad, he
&gt; started the final nine games out of position. He had just finished the
&gt; second year of a five-year contract he signed with the Jets after the
&gt; Cardinals let him go. Curtis Martin led the NFL in rushing for the only
&gt; time in his Hall of Fame career in Kendall's first season with the Jets.

&gt; Kendall made $3million in each of his first two years. He was due to
&gt; make $3million in the third year and $4.5 million in each of the last
&gt; two years. When the Jets reworked his contract after the 2005 season,
&gt; they added $300,000 to his '06 pay and then cut his salary to $1.7
&gt; million this year, $2 million in 2008 and added on an additional year at
&gt; $2.3 million in 2009. None of that money is guaranteed.

&gt; Kendall insists when he reworked the deal with GM Mike Tannenbaum, they
&gt; had an understanding that the Jets would get him back to the $3million
&gt; level if he played well in 2006. Kendall did his part in the Jets'
&gt; revival under Mangini. He started 14 games and played between left
&gt; tackle D'Brickashaw Ferguson and center Nick Mangold, the Jets' rookie
&gt; No.1 picks. Kendall was a mentor to both and the Jets admit he had a
&gt; very good season as they made the playoffs.

&gt; Kendall then asked the Jets to bump him back to the $3million level this
&gt; year, minus the extra $300,000 they gave him in 2006. That means he
&gt; wants a $1 million raise, getting him to $2.7 million, a bargain
&gt; considering the way the market has exploded for guards the last two
&gt; years.

&gt; &quot;Mike has agreed I have a rational case, a reasonable request,&quot; Kendall
&gt; said.

&gt; The Jets won't give him the money and, to this point, won't cut him.
&gt; Mangini is alternating him with the first team in practice.

&gt; Maybe they are waiting for a guard to get hurt at someone else's
&gt; training camp to give them leverage in making a trade. Nobody needs to
&gt; throw Kendall a benefit. He is 34 years old and making $1.7 million. He
&gt; has played 11 years in the NFL. Still, everything is relative. The
&gt; salary cap is $109 million. The Jets should take care of their own.

&gt; He had their back. They should have his.
