My 9 year marriage has gone downhill over the last few years and now
the relationship is stone cold.
My wife has no problems sharing the house with me to help expenses and
raise the 5 year old twins but I have finding it more difficult to be
here.
I am sad, lonely and getting depressed.
She does not want to go to counseling adn I have gone by myself to
help me figure out what is going on and it has helped me a bit but it
has not helped us.

Question is about the kids. is it better for the kids to learn to deal
with parents who are not living together or should I stick it out and
leanr to not get short tempered with the kids because I am not getting
any love or support from the missus...
I fell that it would be better that they have a dad who is patient ( I
was very patient up until 2 years ago, I was even the stay at home dad
for the first year of their lives (( goes to show how patient and
nurturing I am/was)))
adn loving as opposed to depressed adn angry. I want my kids to see
parents who love each other as opposed to seeing 2 strangers sharing a
house together.
My wifes parents are very cold to each other, in 35 years of marriage
he has never told his wife that he lovers her, nor do they share hugs
or smiles.
I am a very affectionate person adn want my kids to know what love is
so they have an idea of what to look for in future partners.

stuck adn lonely and depressed.

If you want the whole storry for added backround just let me know.

Until then I am heartbroken in Israel, far from my native USA.

When a women turns cold, it's over. Much like my X, when they make up
there mind you need to go. It sucks that women are such self centered
cunts &amp; put them selves b4 there children, but they do. Get out, it
gets MUCH better down the road.Nothing you can do about the kids other
than be there when they need you.

-------------------
IMHO, it woud be far better for the kids to have a father who is
mentally healthy, rather than sad, lonely and depressed, and from
here, it looks like the only way for that to happen is for you to get
the hell out of this marriage and move on with your life.  IOW, do
it for the sake of your own sanity and you'll be doing it for them,
as well.

However, this does not mean walking out of the house.  It may
have to be sold, or one of you may want to buy out the other's
share, but whatever you do, do not leave without a written and
signed property settlement agreement.  Possession may not be
9-10ths of the law... but its certainly a major advantage.  =R=

Hello,
It sounds exactly like my life, except my girls are14 &amp; 16.  I
definetly agree with the other advice given so far. I have been doing
a lot of reading on wehter it is better for kids to stay in marriages
like this or have divorced parents. To me that is the most importsnt
thing - how are the kids best off. Mine is a high conflict marriage in
a verbal emotional sense - no violence. I am coming to the conclusion
that they would be best off if we seperated. I believe my wife may
have someminor mental problems but she is unwilling to go see the
counsloer that I am seeing to work on anything. I feel your pain. A
book that I have read that REALLY helped is &quot;too good to leave - too
bad to stay&quot; It really gives a clear picture of what makes for a
rewarding happy marriage - but it does give divorce as a bit to easy
of an option for my taste. It would have definetly said that &quot;I should
go&quot; but I told myself I need to give it a little more of an effort
first...........which hasnt been working, but at least I wont think I
didnt give it  agood shot after seeking help. If your mate is not
willing to work on it too how far can you go in making things better.

Best of luck,
DKC

I have stopped trying with her as it gets no response and only makes
me feel worse when she does not respond.
I have even stopped the nightly foot massages. she does not miss them.
My leg touched her's last night in the bed and scootched her whole
body farther away from mine.
She stopped trying a long time ago.
I just stopped trying recently.

Looking for a new place.

It is the kids that I will miss the most.
Over the last 5 years I have spent the most time with them. picking
them up after day care, taking them to day care, taking them to the
pool every weekend, teaching them to swim, waking up with them in the
middle of the night...
Real sad for me to think that if they wake up in the middel of the
night calling for dad, that he might not be there. Real sad for me to
think about that, but I need to live!

Thanks for the advice.

Thanks Rog, it is one of the things on my mind, an agreement.

We just moved into this new apartment 2 months ago.
I was dumb and optimistic, I thought it would help make her happy, But
nothing makes her happy, nothing makes her satisfied.
She can live here and pay what little mortgage there is ( put more
than half down from the inherritance from my parents).
I am looking for a new space that I can also work from.

It just seems so hard to actually DO IT.

I have stuck through a lot over the past ( at least) 5 years.
The other night we were sitting on the couch discussing her sister's
husband.
She had the audacity to say that he should at least have been nice for
the first year like she ( my wife) was.
Meaning that for the first year she was pretending to be nice and for
the last 8 years she has not given a shit and just let her be her
normal, crabby egomaniacal, sociopathic self that she hid from me when
we yer getting to know each other.
Made me feel REAL SPECIAL! i tell you what.
One of the last things I was trying to deal with was the fact that she
was pregnant and it wasn't mine.
I am sub fertile and she wanted another baby, so she slept with
someone when she was ovulating. She later blamed me for not saying no
strong enough when she asked me what I thought about this guy being a
prem donor.

That was when I realized that she is not in a relationship with me and
that she really does not care.

&gt; leanr to not get short tempered with the kids because I am not getting
&gt; any love or support from the missus...
&gt; I fell that it would be better that they have a dad who is patient ( I
&gt; was very patient up until 2 years ago, I was even the stay at home dad
&gt; for the first year of their lives (( goes to show how patient and
&gt; nurturing I am/was)))
&gt; adn loving as opposed to depressed adn angry. I want my kids to see
&gt; parents who love each other as opposed to seeing 2 strangers sharing a
&gt; house together.
&gt; My wifes parents are very cold to each other, in 35 years of marriage
&gt; he has never told his wife that he lovers her, nor do they share hugs
&gt; or smiles.
&gt; I am a very affectionate person adn want my kids to know what love is
&gt; so they have an idea of what to look for in future partners.

&gt; stuck adn lonely and depressed.

&gt; If you want the whole storry for added backround just let me know.

&gt; Until then I am heartbroken in Israel, far from my native USA.

I agree with what the others wrote. I'm nearing what will hopefully be the
end of my divorce process. My wife &quot;found religion&quot; 7 years ago and
everything went to hell. Since I didn't belong to her little cult, I didn't
count. She stopped taking the pill without telling me so she could get
pregnant (we both agreed no more children as the girls were 17 and 19 at that
time) and hid it until she started to show, then presented it as if it was a
surprise. Took me 3 years to get her to admit that she stopped taking birth
control pills. She then quit her job without letting me know she was going to
do so, leaving me as sole provider for her two girls (hers from a previous
marriage that I raised since the early 90's), herself, me, and my new son.
For 7 years I was nothing more than a wallet. Spent probably four or five
days a month in hotels because I'd get so pissed and fed up with her that I
just had to get out of the house.  Sometimes it was for a week at a time.

I stuck it out for 7 years because I believed in &quot;for better or for worse&quot;.
And I still do. Problem is that it only works when both people are part of
the marriage. I was stupid and hung around when I should not have kept
trying. I even kicked her out of the house for 13 months back in 2001/2002
when all this first started, and before we had my son. Part of the agreeing
to let them return was that the behavior would change. And it was that first
couple weeks she did the birth control thing - shows how long her promise to
me lasted...

Unfortunately I was too much the &quot;I won't leave, I'll keep trying to make it
work&quot; idiot. Imagine my surprise when, the end of June, I come home and find
all her shit gone, some furniture, and my son missing. *SHE* divorced *ME*
when all she got was 3 years of not working so she could stay at home with
our son, me paying off over 20 grand of her previous marriage debt that she
was left with after her first divorce, and me just having spent $5000 this
summer to get her out of a full sized Chevy Venture van she bought *when she
wasn't working* because she wanted something larger, and bought it without
telling me, got screwed in the deal, and was way upside down in what it was
worth / what she owed.

Beleive me, the best gift you can give your twins is the gift of good
relationships. They will learn from what you do, whether it's a bad
relationship with your current wife, or a future good relationship with
someone else. Don't saddle them with thinking that what you're going through
is OK, since that won't help them when it comes time for them to have
relationships of their own. Let them see what a real relationship is. And if
you don't have one for a while, let them see that it's *OK* to be living
without a spouse as well. Anything is a better option than showing them that
what you have now is acceptable.

I feel for you, since I know just how bad it can be. Fortunately for me, my
wife had a psychotic episode in March and the police came and took her away
in a straight jacket and involuntarily committed her to a mental health
facility for a month. She came back on medications and was the same old
person i knew before all the shit happened, but of course she stopped taking
the meds and went right back to being the cuntrag again. But that gave me the
leverage I needed so that she didn't try to screw me over financially or for
my son... Unfortunately, it wasn't quite enough for me to get full custody
since her shrink (who goes to the same church she does) says she's perfectly
healthy (even though I have entries from her diary photocopied that said she
still hears voices and can't differentiate between the good and the bad). So
for now I have to settle for 50/50 custody and placement...

Sorry, sidetracked. Still pisses me off that I hung around for so long. I
keep journal entries, and looking back for 7 years now, nearly ever entry for
the entire 7 years mentioned something about how I should just get the fuck
out. I never did. Don't wait. Don't waste any more years of your life. Time
is too precious and too sparse, don't waste it on someone like her. Do
yourself and the kids a favor and just take the plunge, because if things are
this bad, it'll happen at some point anyway - do it on your own terms in your
own time so that you don't regret three years from now not having done it
sooner.

best of luck for you and the twins.  keep us posted.
