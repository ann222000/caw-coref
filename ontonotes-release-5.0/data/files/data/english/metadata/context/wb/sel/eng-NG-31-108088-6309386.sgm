Hi all, hope you can help, im looking for a pain free way of
installing a new set of needle bearings into my zx6r swingarm (just
had it powder-coated). What would be the best way without damage to
the bearing, swingarm and myself! Hope you can all help. Thanks in
advance.

Not really sure this would work on a ZXR, because I don't know if the
swingarm bearing on this kind of bike is the same as of dirt bikes,
but I will share a tip that I learned here in RMD.

Get a long screw, a few nuts and washers and spacers. You want a
washer that will fit the internal diameter of the swingarm and touch
the bearing, I mean, the OD of the washer must match the OD of the
bearing. With a screw longer than the place where the bearing fit on
the swingarm, you get a spacer that must have an OD larger than the
swingarm and put a washer on top of it, a nut, and as you tighten the
nut, the washer inside the swingarm will pull the bearing. Quick,
easy, cheap and no damage prone method.

hope this helps.

In the US, we call this "All-thread" rod.

I do hope that the bearing area was masked off during powder coat.

Other tips for stubborn bearings:  Warm the swingarm with a heat
gun or hair dryer, and chill the bearings on dry ice.

In case you haven't figured this out, you're making a press here.  You
can get a long 1/4" bolt and nut or threaded rod at home depot.
Precision-sized washers are hard to come by; you can use sockets for
the pressing elements.

I use a vise to press the bearings in until they are flush with the
end of the swingarm. Then I use an appropriate sized socket to push it
in the rest of the way.

I assume, Jay, that then he opens the vise back up and squeezes it
with the vise again.

Yes, the BFH method has a nasty tendency to deform the new bearings.

While I love my BFH, I usually press my bearings in and out using the
press at Aftershocks.  If I'm in a hurry, I use my floor jack and the
frame rail on the truck.

Why wouldn't you use a large electric motor... same as for removal of
the swing arm bolt? :)

Confidentally, I would use a large electric motor.
