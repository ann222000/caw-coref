WARNING---This might get long.... I am already cranky,..and frustrated....
and ready to pack.Ok here's the deal.
I have been in a full service salon and day spa for the past 6+ years, the
business is 26 years old  so they must know something? They became involved
with KRS aka the Michael Cole Seminars/tracking /jump journals, that  you all
have talked about in recent months. Since Oct-06.  If they need  help making
money then I will have to say that I admire them for  getting the help they need
from within the industry.  I have been  quiet about it for all this time
but.... I am at wits end as to what to do here.  Being the &quot;red hair stepchild&quot; and
all.  The tracking of services is a  good idea that I did when started in
this business and when  I first came  here, and slacked off on because it wasn't
so important here? Wasn't done here  and so on.  So now we ALL track
everything and that is  good.   OK,  Back to center and knowing what  is going on.
BUT. ...KRS doesn't know squat about nails or spa services. Everything is all
about hair. even the stuff in our jump journals tells how to up sell foils and
highlights!...On Nails? what???  The only thing that the consultant wants  to
talk  to me about is pedicures and up selling them, pedicure this and  that
and on and on. Even after I told them,  that is part of my job  and I like doing
them but my main focus is Nails.  My passion is  nails.  Her response was,
FAKE nails are a thing of the past and we need to  look to the future.....I
cannot believe any so called professional  in this  industry would say FAKE nails
are a thing of the past. I tried to point out that  Artificial Enhancements
are very much alive and well and that is my main focus.  They didn't even want
me to track fills or full sets, just sets of hands. which  included manis and
polish changes etc...When you are doing 100+ services and 90+  of them are not
Pedicures dont you want to know where the rest of the money is  coming from???
Well ok if you want to for your own information....
Then comes a stylist  rehired that used to work here she likes  to do
pedicures and Manicures , ok now we  have  someone  else to fill the slots that I am
not here for. At least that is what I'm  told. AKA Monday's (My day off) her
day off too, and every other Sat,  Mon. and Wed, after 5pm. I work 40 hours
one week and 50 the next. Just will not  do more.
OR, maybe it becomes time slots that are when I am here and cannot go  to my
desk because my room is in use, My tiny room that is 7'X10' with a desk,
sink, European touch portable spa, chair for that, a cart to hold the parrafin
tub,and...  MY small shelf to hold My electric file, MY  gel  lamp, and MY
rolling cart for all my art supplies, and other  items that are needed to perform
my job, My OTT table lamp.. Yes I sound  possessive because ALL of it is mine,
bought and paid for  MINE....   &lt;stop&gt; I don't want to get mad here, oops...
too  late....   No room for more than a  1 client and  1 tech at  one time.The
only thing that belongs to the shop are the ingredients in the MY  containers,
My dishes, My  menda pumps, My nippers, Clippers,  pedi tools, in MY
barbacide jar,. etc...
Someone asks for her they go to her fine it should be that way. But  here is
no way that I should be sitting with any empty time while she  works. Using
my stuff... Just my opinion.
Now we hire another  part time stylist/ manicurist she starts  next week.
Was a nail tech first and went back to learn hair.   She seems pretty good at
ac. Needs to get better times down but nice  job overall. &amp; nice.. Ok where are
we going to put her stuff. she  has her own elec file and a few tools. Do any
of you share stations?? what do  you use to haul your stuff out and in every
day??? I am thinking that as soon as  I pack it up to make room I will just
keep going...
I hope this crap is not too confusing and I can safely say that what is  here
are only the highlights so far.   I think I am going to pop  a top... or blow
a fuse no! pop a top. NOW.. and I don't even like beer.

OMG Dawn,
I feel your pain!!!! I am moving my biz to another salon cuz I was sick
of being treated like an &quot;add-on&quot;. I booth rent for a little tiny space
big enough for a station and me and a client. Then I was raised 40% in
order for me to do pedis cuz it was taking up more space. I use ALL MY
OWN equipment down to the chairs the client sits in. See I was working
with a friend( i thought) and she charged me 100 per week at another
location which I can do pedis and nails. Then we relocated and I had to
stick my Pedi chair in a room cuz nails were on the main floor so after
a yaer there she raised me to 140 a week!!!! or she said she would rent
out my room where my pedi is. OK well since we moved (2yrs now) she
hasnt even had anyone come in for booth rent for hair and has 2 free
stations. Well anyway,,,,, I just found a room 10x20 off a salon, has a
private entrance and a door into the salon which I can keep closed if I
want to stay private all for 550 a month. BUT.... Im bringing my sister
on and she is spliting the rent with me. It is big enough for a pedi
area and 2 nail stations. So its like my own...kinda.... I gave my
friend 2 weeks notice to be professional and explain that it was a
business opportunity  to expand my own biz and thanks for letting me
work with her and i hope she sees it as a biz and not to hurt out
friendship(we grew up together, worked together 4yrs). WELL&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the next
day after I gave 2 weeks(we pay week to week)....she took my mailbox
off the voicemail so now when a client calls it sounds like Im not
working there( im paying for 2 more weeks of work), and she is treating
me like crap and clients see it.....so Im leaving this weekend instead
of next weekend cuz Im not putting my clients and myself through
another week of hell! Just cuz I dont trust her, Im going to be the
bigger person and leave her the 2nd weeks rent and a letter and
eexplain to her that Im leaving cuz of her jepordizing my biz and
acting umprofessional but heres the rent. My luck if I didnt leave the
rent she would try to take me to court, but atleast she cant say I
stiffed her on a weeks rent. Gee I thought we were friends. Im the only
one in that salon that takes any classes....I dont travel around the
states takeing classes to be treated like an &quot;add-on&quot;.
OK sorry I had to vent too....Tomorrow I move and I know there will be
some fireworks....this is where I wish I just had a box off stuff
instead of chairs,station,pedi equipment, polish, polish racks, drying
station, supplies....yes allllllll mine!!!!!
Im gonna have a drink with ya!!!!

Dawn,
Deep breath.  Don't blow a gasket.
First, I DO NOT share with ANYONE. period. LOL. If it belongs to me, leave it
alone unless you ask! I calmly told two clients of the hairdresser who is
next to me that this is my work area, not a coffee or dining table.  It has not
happened again. Maybe it was &quot;the look&quot;.  I cannot believe that a salon would
have another tech, much less TWO, come on board and have no where to put them.
You should not have to share YOUR stuff with anybody.  The salon needs to buy
them their own, table/chair/pedi stuff/ etc., to share and put them somewhere
else.  Do you booth rent, or an employee? If you booth rent there would be no
way in he** that ANYONE would be sharing my room and stuff!  I don't blame you
for being upset.  It seems as if they are trying to oust you because you do
not want to drop the enhancements and do pedi's exclusively. Who is this guy
anyway? Get some statistics about enhancements. They are definately not on the
way out.  Talk to the owner, calmly lol, about what bothers you.  Will she/he
listen?  I would've spoke up right away. lol  If you decide to leave, don't
forget to take your &quot;toys&quot; and &quot;playmates&quot; (clients) with you.

Lordy Be Dawn.  Been there done that.  Same almost exact situation.  Thank Gawd, I was a boothrenter in a salon full of employees.  But I did charge what the others charged to keep it simple for the clients.  But when we started this new &quot;cole&quot; issue, I was shocked when they wanted me to charge $17.00 for a polish change on toes.  Give me a frigin break.  NO WAY.  I refused.  Well, they couldn't do anything but have to say they never did book one client for a toe polish change.  They (the salon) were laughed at.

Someone who is part of this program needs to contact Michael Cole and discuss this with him, the lack of info for nail enhancements.

and for sharing, no way.  Went thru that also.  Until I gave up and left.  As long as it is there, they just don't understand the &quot;sharing&quot; part of it.  I shared for years until I was taken to the point of no more.  I was fine with the few hair stylists that would do a mani or pedi everyonce in awhile, but when she hired the new nail tech and &quot;assumed&quot; that I would still furnish everything(from products, polish, equipment, nail tables) I said no.  Even talked to her about it.  Just didn't get it.

Talk to her and try.  Get your clients numbers.  Start looking.  Take it slow and smooth.  Be prepared.  Do not make a move in this state of frustration.  Good luck.  diana from indiana

Dawn,
(the OTHER Dawn F!!)
You know how I feel about that outside service from when we talked a while back. What I do not understand about those who hire those outside companies is that they are paying them to make money. So what are they paying them? Is it really worth it?
This company rep obviously does not know anything about the business.
I sure wish you were closer to me. I would bring you here in a heartbeat!
DO NOT let them let anyone use YOUR things. If you have to, buy some carry case and put all your stuff in it--right down to your dappen dishes and take them home every night. This will piss off the owner, but so what?
This is quite sad that they are doing this to you. I think you know in your heart that it is time to move on.
I will have a &quot;Harvey Driver&quot; in your honor today! If there is anything I can do, even if it is to just vent, you know my phone number....
HUGS,
Lynnette

Dawn...I feel your pain.  The last salon I worked for
was with KRS and it kept me down a level for a long
time because they(KRS) do not promote enhancements.
Since I did a ton of enhancements and not enough
pedicures, it was not enough for a percentage
increase, even though I was 95% booked, 82% of those
were rebooks.

Then the salon went to another system with Inspiring
Champions, an lo and behold, I was up 2 levels!!!
Some salon owners do the right thing and stand by
their employees, and some just value the numbers.
Since everything there is yours, have you thought
about going out on your own?  I know it is tough, but
you have quite an investment in your business.  Good
luck to you!

What they're doing it totally wrong. You should not be sharing your stuff with them at all. When you're done with a service can you pack up your implements at least and take them with you? Then when the other tech goes in to do a service she'll have to have her own stuff. We pay good money for out tools and you should not have to share those with someone. You have no idea how well they take care of stuff and you know they won't take care of them if they didn't pay for it themselves. This who situation is just not right. Good luck to you in whatever you decide to do.

Thanks all, for the shoulder  to lean on. I know that I need to  make some
hard choices here and none of them will be sudden or rash. There is no  booth
rent in PA so it will be another salon or my own place. Just don't know  what
yet.  I have owned my own business before and really don't want to be  there
again but My clients and I deserve much better. Husband and I have been  looking
at commercial space and places to buy. Just don't know. All I do know is  you
are ALL GREAT and Thanks so much.

Dawn,

Are you an employee or booth renter?  No way should someone be using all your
stuff that you bought personally and keeping you from using your room.  If
the other folks are goint to do manicures/pedis they should have their own
supplies unless you've made an agreement with them to split the cost.  Sounds to me
like you need to talk to the owner/manager.  As an employee you might not
have many options, but as a booth renter that space is yours.  Good luck!

HOLY CRAP,  17.00 for a frigin polish change?  I never heard of such a thing.  Has the salon owner ever heard of goudging?  The clients need to speak up.  Thank goodness I am self employed.

Talk to her and try. Get your clients numbers. Start looking. Take it slow and smooth. Be prepared. Do not make a move in this state of frustration. Good luck. diana from indiana

Dawn,
Buy a locking cart and lock up your stuff!!  If there's no space for one get
one of those cases on wheels and take your supplies with you at the end of
your day.  That's exactly what I did (and will continue to do) until I can
afford my own location.  Good luck!

&gt;What they're doing it totally wrong. You should not be sharing your stuff
&gt;with them at all. When you're done with a service can you pack up your
&gt;implements at least and take them with you? Then when the other tech goes
&gt;in to do a service she'll have to have her own stuff. We pay good money for
&gt;out tools and you should not have to share those with someone. You have no
&gt;idea how well they take care of stuff and you know they won't take care of
&gt;them if they didn't pay for it themselves. This who situation is just not
&gt;right. Good luck to you in whatever you decide to do.

Can u point me to the carrying cases on wheels? I desperately need one.
Right now, I'm hauling a suitcase, tram case, and my shoulder bag to

Hi Coco!!
do you have a walmart in your state? well if you go in the automotive/hardware dept and there is a double decker Mobile Work Center by Stanley. It has a tray in the top compartment that  you can use to hold your small things like files, brushes, dappen dishes, glue,etc... and in the top compartment you can store your powder, tips,etc.. and the bottom compartment yue can use to house your pedicure products. the bottom is deeper and can hold full size bottles. it's on wheels, black, durable hard plastic like the Stanley tool boxes and easy to keep clean. Actually it's a double decker tool box on wheels. and it was $30 from walmart. Good luck!! Candace

Dawn,

Wow...I wasn't going to put my two cents in, but here goes.? Michael Cole way of learning burns me up.? Not MC himself, but the stylist who I started going to for my hair and his girlfriend who runs the shop turned me totally away with all their pushy sales tactics and FAKE smiles at the front desk with?sweet talking garble,?so on.? Ahhh, feel better now that I got that off my chest....?I am a nailtech/stylist for 28 yrs, a booth-renter at that.? I do hair, so why sell me the same products that &quot;I&quot; carry at my salon and at retail price?? What are they thinking??? $$$$$$$$$$$$ exactly.?OH, I NO LONGER GO THERE! ?I became successful because of the personal touch, price and good work.? (Pati, if you are reading, you know who I am talking about).
Whether booth-renter or not, others should NOT use YOUR stuff.? (for many reasons, but all you need is one reason, IT'S YOURS).
Arrrrgh, got me going...anyway, I would pack your stuff and go on.? I love the &quot;studio&quot; that many of the gals are doing these days.? I will eventually be doing that.? I will be adding on Esthetician to my license and be appt only to my clients one stop shop....hope this all makes sense.

Talk with Karen Hodges, Jan McCormick, and I believe Lynnette is on her own as well.? I'm sure all our fellow techs have alot to share with you.? I wouldnt be so HARD on stylists..It's the owners that make the decisions.? So make yours...

OMG, that's a lot of stuff!  I would be in pain too...literally :o)  When I
was in nail school I just bought a small, regular soft side bag with lots of
compartments and wheels.  I had to go to work right afterwards, so I didn't
want anything too large.  The cases Candice mentioned look great for your
purposes and the price is right!  See if they have a style that has some
sort of lock, so you can use it after you graduate (there will be times
you'll need to lock up you products when you're out and about).  Good luck!

The Tammy Taylor suitcase broke on me just after a few weeks which also
happened to other students. Right now I use my own suitcase which is
fine if u are just hauling just that. I was too tired to go to Wallmart
today, but tomorrow, I'll check it out. For $30 it's a great buy!

&gt; Thanx, Michele, Darlene, and Candance,

&gt; The Tammy Taylor suitcase broke on me just after a few weeks which also
&gt; happened to other students. Right now I use my own suitcase which is
&gt; fine if u are just hauling just that. I was too tired to go to Wallmart
&gt; today, but tomorrow, I'll check it out. For $30 it's a great buy!

Yesterday, we had a speaker from Communities Against Crime at my school
for a couple of hours. I was thinking, oh, another one of these ppl
trying to sell their stuff. Well, let me tell u. After the
presentation, almost everyone bought their pepper+gas spray including
myself. (I got a red one, but I wish they make pink one.) It's normally
$20 for the small one, but with the group discount, it got it for $17.
If u ever need to use it, they will refill it for free for life. They
told me all kinds of true, scary story about what can happen to u:
rape, murder for drug $, abusive husband, ex-husband, etc. They showed
us some moves and how to react when a predator tries to attack u. I
recommend every woman in this county get the pepper/gas spray and carry
it in her purse.

For those living in CA, here is the link to sex offender's mug shots in
your neighborhood: www.meganslaw.ca.gov . Even in my peaceful small
country town, I found there is 1 sex offender living in my
neighborhood! He even looks like a very nice guy!!! Scary. So be
careful and watch out for your and your kids' safety, ladies (and
gentlemen).

I asked for 5 extra copies and buz cards in case anyone on this board
are interested. Email me privately and I can mail it to u. But here is
their info if anyone wants to get in touch with them:

Even thought u don't have a pepper/gas spray, there are 2 things u can
do. Carry a decoy wallet stuffed with tissue paper and a couple of $1
bills sticking out a bit from the outer pocket. When asked to give out
your wallet/money, take that fake wallet of yours and THORW IT OUT as
far as u can and run the opposite way as fast as u can. If the predator
is only interested in your $, he will go for it. Same thing as car
keys. Make a fake set of keys. When asked for your car key, do the
same. These 2 things will save u from $/identity/car theft.

Here's a site to check out. You punch in your address and it will show you offenders in your area and what they're there for. http://www.familywatchdog.us/ Most counties have a website that lists local sex offenders. Go to yahoo or google and type in _______ (your county name) county sex offenders and it should bring it up.

you cant always be sure what these people have been charged with.? you have to register as an s.o. if your 18 and your gf or bf is 17 and a parent gets pissed.
we had one in our neighborhood and we were all up in arms and ready to torch the house.? that is until we found out that he liked boy prostitutes and one happened to not be of legal age.? since none of our kids were what he liked, we were able to calm down.

just some food for thought

Also to keep in perspective: At least in CA, getting caught
peeing in an alley makes you a sex offender.

Consenting adults getting caught in a car = sex offenders,
NOT &quot;cute old people making out in their cars like kids.&quot;

Maggie you are right - but only serious offenders are shown on those sites.
I used to work at a salon with a guy who is a stylist.  He is a reg. sex
offender- because.................he was tanked one night (okay probably
tanked many nights!) and he sorta stumbled outside of his house in the wee
hours of the morning - without his pants.  Police officer happened to live
in the same mobile home park and for this unlucky stylist - happened to be
coming home for a lunch break and guess what he saw in his headlights!!!!
LOL  A half naked male hair stylist!!!!  LOL  I know it's not funny, but it
kind of is!!!  So anyway - he is now a registered offender however he is NOT
listed nor ever has been listed on any of those sites!!!  I know this isn't
really nail related - but it sorta was work related!!!!!!
