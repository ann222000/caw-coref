&quot;Demagoguery loves to emphasize a distinction between human rights
and property rights. The distinction is without validity and only serves
to arouse envy. The right to own is the mark of a free man. The slave is
a slave simply because he is denied that right. And because the free man
is secure in the possession and enjoyment of what he produces, and the
slave is not, the spur to production is in one and not in the other. Men
produce to satisfy their desires and if their gratifications are curbed
they cease to produce beyond the point of limitation; on the other hand
the only limit to their aspirations is the freedom to enjoy the fruits of
their labors.&quot;

Time for Another Revolution
By Frank Chodorov
Posted on
7/3/2007

From One is a Crowd , by Frank
Chodorov, 1952.

It all began, as you know, with the Declaration of Independence.
The Americans stated their case, both as to the disabilities put upon
them by the British Crown and as to the kind of government they
considered it fitting for men to live under.

The indictment was rejected and the issue was joined in battle. The god
of war decided in favor of the Americans, insofar as removing the
grievous rule was concerned; but in the establishment of a government to
their liking the victors were on their own. Nobody could help them.

Even history could not make a suggestion; for never had there been a
political establishment constructed or operating on principles laid down
in the Declaration. These principles, moreover, were quite metaphysical,
completely outside the realm of experience. They were: (1) that all men
are created equal, and, (2) that all men are endowed with inalienable
rights. When you come down to it, the two metaphysical concepts are
really one. For the postulate of equality did not apply to human
capacities or attributes, which are quite unequal and far beyond the
scope of government, but to the enjoyment of rights or
prerogatives.

In that respect, they maintained, all men must be considered on a par.
This was a brand-new base for government. In all political science
hitherto known it had been an axiom that rights were privileges handed
down to subjects by the sovereign power; hence there was nothing positive
about them. A new king or a new parliament could abrogate existing rights
or extend them to other groups or establish new favorites.

The Americans, however, insisted that in the nature of things all rights
inhere in the individual, by virtue of his existence, and that he
instituted government for the sole purpose of preventing one citizen from
violating the rights of another. Sovereign power, they said, resides in
the individual; the government is only an agency of his will. If it fails
to carry out its duties properly, or if it itself presumes to invade his
rights, then the moral thing to do is to kick it out.

But, government is not an abstraction; it consists of people, and the
inclination of all people is to improve upon their circumstances with
whatever skills or capacities they possess and by whatever opportunities
they meet up with. The power placed in the hands of this agency --- to
enforce the observance of an equality of rights -- is in itself a
temptation from which only the saintly are delivered.

The Founding Fathers were therefore confronted with a difficult
contradiction: men being what they are, a government is necessary; and
government being what it is, men must be safeguarded against it. Their
recipe was the Constitution. Whether or not the ensuing government would
materialize the metaphysics of the Declaration, the Constitution was, at
any rate, a definite pattern; and when it was ratified and put into
operation, it became the end-product of the Revolution.

To be sure, the Constitution cut corners around the doctrine of natural
rights. We must remember that it was, after all, a political instrument,
concocted by men. Only in its preamble can such an instrument serve the
moralities; its working parts must be geared to the interests of the
dominating groups in society, and hence it must be a compromise; to
effect the compromise the moralities must be watered down. The
Constitution was no exception. The assumed equality of rights was
distinctly out of line with the profitable slave trade; owners of large
estates wondered how it might affect their business; merchants and
manufacturers deemed it dangerous to their preferred position. The
Constitution was therefore so framed that the doctrine could not be
employed to disrupt the status.

There were many Americans who contended that the profit of the Revolution
was liquidated by the Constitution and at their insistence a Bill of
Rights was included.

The Basic Social Struggle

The Founding Fathers forged well. Putting aside what it might have
been, the Constitution did pay homage to the doctrine of natural rights.
It did so by the simple expedient of putting restraints and limitations
on the powers of government. We learn from their published statements
that the intent of the Founding Fathers was to prevent the despised
&quot;democrats,&quot; should they come into power, from using it for
spoliation. They were quite forthright about it, and not a little could
be said in favor of their thesis. In recent years the &quot;mob&quot;
they feared has indeed come into power and the result seems to support
the contention of Madison, Adams, and Hamilton.

But regardless of their argument and regardless of their intent, the
Constitutional shackles did in fact, though perhaps inadvertently,
protect the people in the enjoyment of their cherished rights.

From this we learn a little heeded lesson in social science, namely,
that the real struggle that disturbs the enjoyment of life is not between
economic classes but between Society as a whole and the political power
which imposes itself on Society. The class-struggle theory is a blind
alley. True, people of like economic interests will gang up for the
purpose of taking advantage of others. But within these classes there is
as much rivalry as there is between the classes.

When, however, you examine the advantage which one class obtains over
another you find that the basis of it is political power. It is
impossible for one person to exploit another, for one class to exploit
another, without the aid of law and the force to back up the law. Examine
any monopoly and you will find it resting on the State. So that the
economic and social injustices we complain of are not due to economic
inequalities, but to the political means that bring about these
inequalities.

If peace is to be brought into the social order it is not by accentuating
a class struggle, but by restraining the basic cause of it; that is, the
political power. To bring about a condition of equal rights, which is a
condition of justice, the hands of the politician must be so tied that he
cannot extend his activities beyond the simple duty of protecting life
and property, his only competence.

To the extent, then, that the Founding Fathers delimited the powers of
the new government by the system of checks and balances to that
extent did they render inestimable social service. And to that extent did
they insure the victory of the Revolution.

For about a century and a half the American citizen enjoyed, in the main,
three immunities against the State: in respect to his property; in
respect to his person; in respect to his thought and expression. Pressure
upon them was constant, for in the pursuit of power the State is
relentless, but the dikes of the Constitution held firm and so did the
immunities. Only within our time did the State effect a vital breach in
the Constitution, and in short order the American, no matter what his
classification, was reduced to the status of subject, as he was before
1776. His citizenship shriveled up when the Sixteenth Amendment replaced
the Declaration of Independence.

The income tax completely destroys the immunity of property. It flatly
declares a prior right of the State to all things produced. What it
permits the individual to retain is a concession to expediency, not by
any means a right; for the State retains the liberty to set rates and to
fix exemptions from year to year, as its convenience dictates. Thus, the
sacred right of private property is violated, and the fact that it is
done pro forma makes the violation no less real than when it is done
arbitrarily by an autocrat. The blanks we so dutifully fill out simply
accentuate our degradation to subject status.

Demagoguery loves to emphasize a distinction between human rights and
property rights. The distinction is without validity and only serves to
arouse envy. The right to own is the mark of a free man. The slave is a
slave simply because he is denied that right. And because the free man is
secure in the possession and enjoyment of what he produces, and the slave
is not, the spur to production is in one and not in the other. Men
produce to satisfy their desires and if their gratifications are curbed
they cease to produce beyond the point of limitation; on the other hand
the only limit to their aspirations is the freedom to enjoy the fruits of
their labors.

That fact, deep rooted in the nature of man, accounts for the progress of
civilization when and where the right of property is recognized, and for
the retrogression that follows from its denial. Property rights and human
rights are more than complementary; they are identical.

The income tax did more than revoke the immunity of property. It gave the
State the means of effectively attacking the immunities of mind and of
person; it transferred to the State that sovereignty which,

I don't like the idea of a revolution.   A revolution has already
taken place.  The government, or those behind it, has revolted against
the Constitution.  I think it's time for a restoration by what ever
means necessary.  Counter-revolution would be an accurate term, but I
prefer restoration.  It conveys a movement with a clear and reasonable
goal, whereas revolution can be more radical and chaotic.

Did you READ the Article?

I don't SEE where they suggest any type of violence to achieve the
goal of winning back our Constitutional Right's, does he?

There are also such things as revolution of the mind and soul too, not
all revolutions need be violent or cost lives.

The Industrial Revolution was far from a violent Revolution, although
I am sure it had its &quot;victims&quot;.

I suggest that the demise of the immigration bill is an example of the
power of citizens to conduct a revolution of the heart and soul, as
Gaar observes.

Americans totally overwhelmed the power of government by speaking out
by the tens of millions for weeks, jamming phone e-mail and fax
machines to and beyond capacity demanding protection of their rights
as law abiding citizens against Foreign invasion.

I was ecstatic not just by the peoples victory, but because it was
unprecedented.  The massive population of government employees will
never again feel safe in trying to shove bad bills down our throats.
The can no more assume that their nanny mentality of &quot;only we know
best what is good for America&quot; was crushed, and if they have IQs
higher than room temperature, they will now always fear the fact that
the American people have discovered a kind of VETO power.

Didn't you read my post?  I never said the author advocated violent
revolution.  I object to the term revolution because I believe the
proper term is restoration.  We don't need to overthrow the
government, just put it back within the confines of the Constitution.
And, yes, considering the violence the government has visited upon the
American citizens, I would advocate violence if necessary.  You may
not recall, but it was violence that lead to the formation of this
country.

I'm not sure what it is you don't understand about that, Gaar.
