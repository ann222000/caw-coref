Dick Cheney likes young girls  French Interior Minister Sarkozy's operations to stir up violence in Paris  Human and civil rights vs. a secreted GOP homo-erotic cabal

October 27/28/29, 2006 -- Legitimate human and civil rights versus a secreted GOP homo-erotic cabal is the real social issue in this election.

The GOP is hyping the New Jersey Supreme Court civil union ruling and anti-gay marriage initiatives in a number of states as reasons to boast about their fanciful chances of retaining control of the Congress. Nothing could be further from the truth. This election is about constant GOP lying and hypocrisy on the issues of the rights afforded to U.S. citizens regardless of sexual orientation.

According to senior Democratic sources in the House of Representatives, the Pagegate scandal is merely the "tip of the iceberg" of the predatory nature of a number of GOP congressmen, Bush administration officials, and senior staffers. The GOP is trying to make the claim that the House Ethics Committee, which it runs, is almost finished with its "investigation." However, senior Democrats in the House claim that there has been no "investigation," merely a cover-up to dowse the flames from a serious sex scandal days before the election.
Democrats point out that House Speaker Dennis Hastert's four top aides, his Chief of Staff Scott Palmer, his Deputy Chief of Staff Mike Stokke, Hastert liaison with the House Clerk's Office Ted Van Der Meid, and former House Clerk Jeff Trandahl have all been implicated in the House page scandal, along with the entire House GOP leadership and current and past Republican members of the House Page Board.

The "cabal" expects America to vote for their continued predatory way of life. Send them a message that it will no longer be "business as usual."

Then there is the odd case of former Mark Foley and Tom Reynolds Chief of Staff Kirk Fordham, who came to Washington in his twenties and managed to nail the job of Chief of Staff to Foley, a position that is usually held by an older and more experienced Hill veteran. Before working for Foley, Fordham served as Deputy Chief of Staff to Oklahoma Republican Senator James Inhofe, who proudly claims that he never had any homosexuals in his family (until when?) Fordham testified about an incident that occurred in either 2002 or 2003 when a drunken Foley attempted to enter the page dorm. The question remains as whether Fordham was a witness to that incident and if so, what was he doing at the page dorm with Foley?

Fordham said that he "informed" top GOP aides of Foley's behavior with pages three years ago. But there is a big difference between making an official report and merely discussing Foley's conduct with peers over drinks. If there was an official complaint, there is certainly no record of it in the GOP-controlled House. And this is what concerns senior Democrats. The House Republican leadership has continually covered up sexual misconduct by its members and their staff.

Nevertheless, it is apparent that Fordham became a potential problem for Foley. Fordham left Foley's office in 2004 and became the Finance Director for Florida GOP Senator Mel Martinez's Senate campaign. He then secured a job with DCI Group, a lobbying and PR group that is closely connected to the Bush administration and has counted among its major clients Microsoft, AT&amp;T, RJ Reynolds, and the military junta of Burma (which is also close to Dennis Hastert as previously reported by WMR). On October 4, 2005, Fordham was hired by Reynolds Chief of Staff at a salary of $38,837.30 per quarter (a not insignificant annual salary of  $155,349.20/year). On top of that, Democratic House sources report that Reynolds placed Fordham on the payroll of his political action committee, TOMPAC, which was flush with money from Foley's dubious campaign coffers in Florida.

Democratic sources also report that the FBI was brought into the case by the GOP leadership to "silence everyone" about the case. And silence and cover-up is the order of the day. Foley quit and was quickly sent to the tres chic Sierra Tucson rehabilitation center in Arizona, which specializes in addictions and personality disorders. It has previously treated the likes of Whitney Houston, Ringo Starr, and Rob Lowe. In typical Rovian fashion, Foley's pederast conduct was blamed on a pedophile Catholic priest far away on the Maltese island of Gozo.

Diversionary tactics. Fordham, according to his Richmond, Virginia-based attorney, is "away on vacation" after his "ordeal."

Everything and everyone are being "tidied up" neatly by the GOP, except for the damage inflicted on the House pages. A senior Democratic member of the House summed the scandal as a "homo-erotic network that extends from the House pages to the White House involving everybody's office." The congressman pointed out that the centers of the network are Republican National Committee Chairman Ken Mehlman and his one-time White House boss, Karl Rove. As far as Rove is concerned, the House member stated that he has been hiding behind two "beards" (wives that covered for his homosexuality) for years.

We can also report that well-informed House sources now report that another GOP member who will soon be caught up in "Foley-like" problems is GOP Rep. David Dreier of California. Using his powerful position as Rules Committee Chairman, Dreier has reportedly helped provide cover to Hastert and his staff  for the GOP pederast network on Capitol Hill.

This election is about permitting the GOP pederast network to continue to run Washington with impunity. We have already seen the GOP pouring money into the Minnesota 6th Congressional District in  support of far right Michele Bachmann against Patty Wetterling, whose 11-year old son Jacob was kidnapped 17 years ago by a masked gunman. The same ilk of predatory creatures now lurk with impunity in the Republican Party leadership at all levels: local, state, and federal.

The GOP and their North American Man-Boy Love Association (NAMBLA) and affiliated supporters do not want to see Ms. Wetterling using a US House of Representatives bully pulpit to ruin their cryptic and secretive life styles. That's why they are doing everything to ensure that Bachmann wins this particular seat. Ms. Wetterling is the pederasts' worst nightmare. There has never been a real champion for missing and abused children in Congress, especially someone who has personally experienced the personal and family trauma brought about by these lowest forms of humanity (the GOP had pederast Mark Foley as their co-chairman of the House Caucus on Missing and Exploited Children! If he was their best choice, just think who and what were the GOP's runners-up).

When you vote, just think about abducted 11-year old Jacob Wetterling.

As someone who investigated child abusers and predators in the US Navy as a temporary special agent for the Naval Investigative Service and FBI in 1982, I am making a very personal appeal to the readers of WMR to help Patty Wetterling's campaign in any way that you can. The threat from abusers and predators is very real and they exist in the highest echelons of our government. But these bottom feeders abhor the disinfectant of sunshine and resultant exposure. Only Patty Wetterling can bring that disinfectant to a Washington, DC that for too long has been the domain of sexual perverts, cretins, and pederasts -- 95 percent of whom have had the letter "R" next to their names.

The Democratic Party is fortunate this year to not only have Patty Wetterling championing the cause of missing and exploited children but other candidates who will use their House seats as bully pulpits for other important issues:

Louis Vandenberg in California for the environment and public airwaves fairness and balance

Bob Bowman in Florida for 911 Truth

Clint Curtis in Florida for voting integrity
All major issues -- all superb candidates.

October 26, 2006 -- Venezuela and Guatemala remained deadlocked in further General Assembly voting for the Latin American seat on the Security Council. Yesterday's voting resumed in the morning with the deadlock continuing (and Chile picking up its first vote in the 37th round):

37th round ballot (unrestricted )

Total # of ballots cast -- 192
Invalid ballots -- 0
Valid ballots -- 192
Abstensions -- 6
Required two-thirds majority -- 124
Votes obtained:
Guatemala -- 107
Venezuela -- 78
Chile -- 1

36th round ballot (unrestricted )
Total # of ballots cast -- 187
Invalid ballots -- 0
Valid ballots -- 187
Abstensions -- 6
Required two-thirds majority -- 121
Votes obtained:
Guatemala -- 109
Venezuela -- 72

After 41 rounds of voting concluded yesterday, Venezuela and Guatemala, again failing to achieve a two-thirds majority, both signaled they were ready to reach out to compromise candidates. Bolivia, an ally of Venezuela, was the chosen candidate of Venezuela, while Guatemala signaled it would likely back Costa Rica as its compromise pick.

Guatemalan Foreign Minister Gert Rosenthal, acting as a proxy for the totally undiplomatic John Bolton, said Bolivia was as unacceptable as Venezuela. The name of Paraguay has also been mooted but with George W. Bush's recent personal land deal with that nation, Venezuela and its allies are sure to object. Uruguay, which is also an ally of Venezuela, has also been mentioned as a possibility.

October 26, 2006 -- People who knew Dick Cheney in Wyoming before he served in the Nixon administration say he always had an unusual penchant for hanging around young girls, some as young as seven years old. Cheney reportedly walked around his Wyoming home in his underwear, sometimes when his two young daughters' friends were visiting. Cheney continues to think of himself as a "rock star" around young girls. In 1969, Cheney left Wyoming for Washington, where he worked for the Cost of Living Council, at the Office of Economic Opportunity, and the White House staff.

Cheney: fancies himself as a "rock star" around young girls. The Cheneys' home in Wyoming was no place to go on Halloween.

Cheney served as a Congressman from Wyoming from 1979 to 1989.

This was during a time when two major page scandals, both involving Republican members of Congress, rocked Capitol Hill. They were the Koreagate scandal and the page/prostitutes visiting the White House in the late 1980s. In 1981, Lynne Cheney wrote "Sisters," an Old West novel containing lesbian themes. Dick Cheney's close friend and former chief of staff Scooter Libby penned a novel called "The Apprentice." The following is an excerpt from Libby's book, which features its main character, Yukiko, drawing hair on the 'mound' of a little girl:

"At age 10 the madam put the child in a cage with a bear trained to couple with young girls so the girls would be frigid and not fall in love with their patrons. They fed her through the bars and aroused the bear with a stick when it seemed to lose interest."

When this editor was growing up, there were certain houses we were told not to visit for "Trick or Treating" on Halloween. If the Cheneys lived in our neighborhood, their house would have been at the top of the "no go" list.

October 26, 2006 -- WMR has received an eyewitness report to French Interior Minister Nicolas Sarkozy's operations to stir up violence in the Paris metropolitan area's largely Muslim suburbs (banlieus). Sarkozy is running for president in next year's election. On September 25, a police caravan used the right bank of the Seine's Quai des Celestins as a staging area for an assault on the Tarterets banlieu in order to "rough up" the locals. Several hundred police were press-ganged into service for the attack. Only a few arrests were made in what amounted to a psychological warfare operation (see yesterday's report on Israel's LAP involvement in fomenting the French riots).

France's Chief Provocateur Nicolas Sarkozy: stoking the flames for his and his handlers' agenda for France.

The pre-planned police assault was in retaliation for an earlier attack on two police officers in Tarterets. WMR has learned from French intelligence sources that assaults on police are also staged by Sarkozy and his supporters who have totally infiltrated the domestic intelligence service, the DST, and are now found in increading numbers in the DGSE, the foreign intelligence service.
