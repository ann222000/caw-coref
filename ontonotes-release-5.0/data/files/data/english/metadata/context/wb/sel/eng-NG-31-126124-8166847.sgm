You know villains tend to lose some of their effectiveness over time
because they can't develop.  A lot of times they do but are reverted
back to old behavior because their antagonism to the hero works better
there.  But they could just switch off certain villains to new heroes
and start fresh with them.

Lex Luthor loves his daughter Lena enough to rationally ask Superman
for the child as he rescues her.  Later Lex allows her to be taken and
be transformed by Brainiac.

The Sandman becomes a hero until The Wizard gets his hands on him.

I think that one thing which would help is to give villains goals
which would allow them to win.  One of the big problems with taking
supervillains as credible threats is that they generally have to keep
losing.  If the villains goal is to kill the hero or take over the
world or kill beloved supporting characters in order to get to the
hero then they can't really win.  Okay as Flash #13 showed us the hero
killers can occasionally win but this isn't a paradigm which you can
have repeated very often.  But if you give then goals which they can
accomplish without deranging either the fictional or real world (ie
not killing beloved characters or destroying real world stuff) then
you can have them win.  There's no reason that the criminal can't
occaissionally get away with their schemes.  I remember some interview
with Chris Claremont where he was talking about this in Xmen.  He
talked about how he felt the traditional X villains had lost a lot of
their credibility because they never managed to win.  So he said he
went through a couple of years where the heroes didn't win, at best
they could force a draw but the villains would also win.  I think this
is a case where larger plotlines could come in handy.  Most superhero
books tend to have short story arcs.  The heroes confront some villain
for a couple of issues and then move on to another threat.  If the
plot is longer and the villains plan more labyrinthine then you can
have him accomplish victories, even significant victories, along the
path to his ultimate plan and still have the heroes prevail in the
end.  So Vandal Savage can humiliate the Justice Society and get his
hands on the flux capacitor which he needs to power his doomsday
device but in the climactic battle eight issues down the road the
heroes manage to pull through and barely stop him.  There also might
be an advantage in this regard in team books.  In Flash or Batman we
know that the title character has to pull through but there's more
room for cast changes, deaths, depowerings etc in team books,
especially ones like Runaways which are largely self contained.  This
was one of the things I liked about DnA's version of the Legion.  Not
only were the characters not crossing over to other books often but
the whole book was set in a rarely visited corner of the DCU.  This
let DnA really play with the aftermath of end of the world scenarios
in a way which the regular DCU can't.  Because the DCU and the Marvel
U are supposed to be basically our earth with some additions the
writers can't change it too much.  Hey the Sun Eater almost
extinguishes the sun and freezes the oceans but life goes on.  Hey Lex
Luthor becomes president but there's no real political changes outside
of his rule.  Everything gets reset after the latest apocalypse.

Oh, sorry.  I thought you were asking for some villains who'd had
characterization removed to make them closer to previous stories.

Although he did seem to regret it.

Later still, when Lex gets amnesia and becomes a radical
called Alex Luthor (who still hates Superman for different
reasons), Talia uses Lena to force him to realise he's got
responsibilities, suggesting a return to the more interesting
characterisation.

But later than that, Lena seemingly vanishes from the face of
the multiverse, and is never mentioned again.

Lex loves Lex.  He loves his child less, but still loves it.  So he
asked Superman.  Then when he gets something out it, he gives the
thing away.

I see no contradiction.

And before she was his daughter she was (from 61 to around 75) his
younger sister.

So as it seems they had a China Town thing going &quot;she's my sister&quot; slap
&quot;my daughter&quot; slap &quot;my sister&quot; slap &quot;she's my sister and my daughter!
.... oh yeah, and I tossed in some of Superman's DNA too.&quot;

Well..... you can't have that in the comics.

Even when they can win, or just develop, it seems a new writer will
eventually come along and change them.

You can make some good characterization for a villain, but down the
line someone will come along and turn them back into a generic petty
thief, mass murderer, or world domination charcter.

Too bad Claremont doesn't pay attention to his own ideas.  He's as
guilty as any other writer of writing villains that lose credibility.
Sometimes even when they do win.  (He's also bad for &quot;shock value&quot;
wins that get reversed.  And more often for setting up some amazingly
powerful obstacle, and then having the heroes win by an arbitrary
power-up or new ability, or sheer willpower, or some deus ex machina
revelation.  Which just weakens the whole thing.)
