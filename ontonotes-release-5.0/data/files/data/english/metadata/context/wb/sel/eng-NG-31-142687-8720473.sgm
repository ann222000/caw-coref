Here it is. Lets see which congressman or woman has the guts to
walk away from their party and stand up for the American
people and support these issues without lying or being
bought off. Lets see who can get elected on these platform
planks without needing hundreds of millions of dollars in
campaign donations.

A 3rd party that:
Supports America for Americans first and eliminates foreign special
interest pandering.
Upholds the Constitution.
Cuts the influence of the corporatocracy and lobbyists and unions.
Defends our borders and jobs.
Has zero tolerance for corruption by elected or appointed officials.
De-politicises the federal agencies and judiciary.
Mandates voting paper trails.
Makes voting compulsory.
Gets Bin Laden and Al Qaida at any cost.
Re-established our tarnished international image.
Upholds climate and earth protection treaties.
Has a universal healthcare plan for all legal residents in the US.
Brings back fairness and accuracy to the news media.
Mandates one taxation system for all e.g. 7% of whatever you earn.
(Corporates too)
No complex rules, no attornies of accountants needed.
Makes it easier for ANYONE to get on a ballot ANYWHERE with
the right number of verified signatures.
Makes the TV stations pay their way in running political ads.

Simple, straightforward. America first.
I'll bet we could find hundreds of thousands that could and
would stand for office on these planks if only they could
get on ballots without needing loads of $$$.

Corporatocracy? This sounds like a red herring to me. All citizens
have the right to lobby the government. It is only corrupt politicians
and government employees that use their influence to increase
their personal gain. Term limits are the real answer to stop the
powerful politicians from feathering their own nests.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

">

There are fair and  accurate news organizations. You just
have to carefully choose what you read, listen to and watch.
TV news, ABC, NBC, CBS and cable CNN, MSNBC, PBS, most
print media, all news magazines and Air America are all
biased to the left. They are all organs of the DNC.

Most radio talk shows are biased to the right. The big difference
is that those talk shows readily admit their bias to the right.
None of the other mentioned &quot;news&quot; sources admit their bias
and actually claim to be unbiased. This on its face is a huge
lie. Nothing and no one is unbiased.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Mandates one taxation system for all e.g. 7% of whatever you earn.

If the federal government were restricted to its constitutionally
mandated size the tax burden would not be as onerous.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Taxing businesses is a charade designed to placate

consumers who buy the products and serves of

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

The problem is not a lack of access to the ballot. The problem
is that illegals, cadavers, animal pets and other unqualified
voters are able to vote and have their votes counted. That
democrat operatives can disqualify the absentee ballots
of our men and women in the military. That the DNC house
organs like CBS can announce the election results before
the polls are closed when those polls are in Republican
districts in the Florida panhandle.

Of course, the career politicians have warped the rules
of the political game in their favor. This is why we need
term limits to get rid of the career politicians who have
dedicated their lives to parasitism, to become
multimillionaires while bleeding the working man

&gt; Abolish the senate - its undemocratic and serves no purpose.

The Senate is our house of lords. They all think of themselves
as divine and omnipotent. Members of the Senate were once
elected by the various state legislatures. The wisdom of that
kind of senate was that the various states had some say in
the doings of the federal government. 1913 was a bad year
for the Constitution when amendments 16 and 17 were ratified,
16 begot the onerous income tax and 17 brought about the
popular election of senators. Thus the ninth and tenth
amendments were circumvented and the states lost their
power and sadly so did the people.

You sure have to say that to try and set the stage for it
not to happen. I can understand that all the people with
vested interests in the status quo wouldn't want to
see either party fragment because it would ruin what has
been a lucrative congame for many.

What we need is men and women of moral fiber to stand up
for what they believe in and walk away from these two
corrupt and incompetent parties and start something
new:
A 3rd party that:
Supports America for Americans first and eliminates foreign special
interest pandering.
Upholds the Constitution.
Cuts the influence of the corporatocracy and lobbyists and unions.
Defends our borders and jobs.
Has zero tolerance for corruption by elected or appointed officials.
De-politicises the federal agencies and judiciary.
Mandates voting paper trails.
Makes voting compulsory.
Gets Bin Laden and Al Qaida at any cost.
Re-established our tarnished international image.
Upholds climate and earth protection treaties.
Has a universal healthcare plan for all legal residents in the US.
Brings back fairness and accuracy to the news media.
Mandates one taxation system for all e.g. 7% of whatever you earn.
(Corporates too)
No complex rules, no attornies of accountants needed.
Makes it easier for ANYONE to get on a ballot ANYWHERE with
the right number of verified signatures.
Makes the TV stations pay their way in running political ads.

Simple, straightforward. America first.
I'll bet we could find hundreds of thousands that could and
would stand for office on these planks if only they could
get on ballots without needing loads of $$$.

Gee. I am amazed that anyone would think our socialist-leaning brethren in
the present Democratic congress would be so crass as to chase
campaign/retirement funds to the detriment of the American people. These
folks are, above all, just doing their jobs - taking care of the American
people.

Democratic politicians have only had the best interests of their
constituents in mind and it is only those evil, money-grubbing GOP
politicians who make things tough for everyone to do the people's work.

Just listen to what they are telling the folk every day. Don't pay any
attention to what they do, every day, just to what they say.

There would be no point in starting up no third party. Why, just the
confusion that would engender in dividing up political spoils and equity
would be enough to put off all but the most stout-hearted of these caring
politicians.

Ideas that sound this good and simple are seldom the answer to our national
problems. We must show trust in our regular politicians - no matter what
stripe they tend to exhibit prior to the coming electoral season.

Third, Fourth, or Fifth parties would just confuse the American public.
Diluting the voting power of well-established voting blocks,
disenfranchising millions of caring liberal Democratics, and wrecking the
long-established party system of spoils and pay-offs would have catastrophic
effects that would take years to re-establish..

How many of them stood in a time when we were taken to war
on a lie, when the country was threatened by terrorists,
when US jobs were sold to dictatorships overseas, when
we had an adminstration that gerrymandered the USSC,
when we had an administration that hated the constitution
and trampled on rights, when we had some of the most
corrupt congresses in history, when we had the administration
betraying our security services, when we had gigantic
amounts of money squandered, looted and pillaged from the
taxpayers pockets, when we had a corporatocracy declare
that the citizens have less rights, protection and
healthcare that the bloated plutocrats who say they
rule us??

&gt; &gt; Define corrupt. Just because you think it is so
&gt; &gt; doesn't make it so.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;and government employees that use their influence to increase
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;their personal gain. Term limits are the real answer to stop the
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;powerful politicians from feathering their own nests.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Defends our borders and jobs.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Both parties are abject failures at defending our borders.
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;The federal government has no business interfering with
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;jobs and private businesses.

&gt; &gt;&gt;Yes it does when they steal from the American people
&gt; &gt;&gt;and sell our infrastructure and jobs overseas.

&gt; &gt; who have you been listening to son? They have an
&gt; &gt; agenda and it's not a good one for America.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Has zero tolerance for corruption by elected or appointed officials.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Term limits again will serve to weed out the bad apples.

&gt; &gt;&gt;No, heavy jail sentences.

&gt; &gt; You're against term limits?

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;De-politicises the federal agencies and judiciary.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;If the federal government was limited in its size
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;as the Constitution clearly specifies most of the
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;agencies would no longer exist thus eliminating
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;a great deal of the corruption and incompetence
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;the federal government is so famous for.

&gt; &gt;&gt;Non-sequitur. Most are not political appointees,
&gt; &gt;&gt;but many in key positions are and they control
&gt; &gt;&gt;those who are competent.

&gt; &gt; The political appointees, e.g., the president's
&gt; &gt; cabinet control both the competent and incompetent.
&gt; &gt; Obviously, you've never had a run in with a bureaucrat.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Mandates voting paper trails.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Stalin's famous statement applies here in spades
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;It doesn't matter who votes, what counts is who
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;counts the ballots.&quot;

&gt; &gt;&gt;And your point is?

&gt; &gt; Do you have trouble interpreting plain English?
&gt; &gt; Think about it.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Makes voting compulsory.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Can't have that in a free country. Communist and
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;other totalitarian government always had and have
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;voter turn outs close to 100%.

&gt; &gt;&gt;Plenty of democracies have compulsory voting.
&gt; &gt;&gt;Neocons hate the thought.

&gt; &gt; And how would you know that?

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Gets Bin Laden and Al Qaida at any cost.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;The cost has been high so far. How much higher
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;do you want it to go?

&gt; &gt;&gt;The majority of the deaths that have occurred
&gt; &gt;&gt;have NOTHING to do with catching Bin Laden.

&gt; &gt; Most of them have not but they have had everything
&gt; &gt; to do with destroying al Qaeda. You know, OBL's
&gt; &gt; private army of racist lunatics.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Re-established our tarnished international image.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Do you really give a shit what the dictators of the
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;world think of us? I think we need only think and
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;do what is best for America.

&gt; &gt;&gt;No you don't. You are not interested in America
&gt; &gt;&gt;as anyone can see from your &quot;rebuttal&quot; of all
&gt; &gt;&gt;my points. You think countries like France, England
&gt; &gt;&gt;and Italy are &quot;dictatorships&quot;?

&gt; &gt; I'm sorry if I've hurt your feelings. But you don't
&gt; &gt; have a clue what I think.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;pholds climate and earth protection treaties.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;You mean like Kyoto? That highly flawed treaty
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;is like handing China and the other nations
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;pardoned from compliance our wallet, our balls
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;and our lives.

&gt; &gt;&gt;You're just another Neocon.

&gt; &gt; Unable to defend the indefensible you now
&gt; &gt; resort to name calling. This is the tiresome
&gt; &gt; ploy of left wing dimwits who think only in
&gt; &gt; terms of bumper stickers and slogans.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Has a universal healthcare plan for all legal residents in the US.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;There are all kinds of health care plans available in the US.
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Obviously, you just don't want to pay your own way and
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;want to live off others like some sort of parasite.

&gt; &gt;&gt;Nonsense. It works for the UK, France, Australia.
&gt; &gt;&gt;You're just interested in maintaining the corporate
&gt; &gt;&gt;status quo.

&gt; &gt; Define &quot;it works.&quot;

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Brings back fairness and accuracy to the news media.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;There are fair and  accurate news organizations. You just
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;have to carefully choose what you read, listen to and watch.
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;TV news, ABC, NBC, CBS and cable CNN, MSNBC, PBS, most
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;print media, all news magazines and Air America are all
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;biased to the left. They are all organs of the DNC.

&gt; &gt;&gt;What a load of tripe.

&gt; &gt; That's exactly what the above mentioned &quot;news&quot;
&gt; &gt; venders unload on the American people and you
&gt; &gt; appear to be an avid consumer of it.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Most radio talk shows are biased to the right. The big difference
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;is that those talk shows readily admit their bias to the right.
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;None of the other mentioned &quot;news&quot; sources admit their bias
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;and actually claim to be unbiased. This on its face is a huge
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;lie. Nothing and no one is unbiased.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Mandates one taxation system for all e.g. 7% of whatever you earn.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;If the federal government were restricted to its constitutionally
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;mandated size the tax burden would not be as onerous.

&gt; &gt;&gt;Yeah but you Neocons are for BIG government feeding off the
&gt; &gt;&gt;public taxes.

&gt; &gt; How old are you? You obviously did not live through
&gt; &gt; the &quot;New Deal&quot; and the &quot;Great Society&quot; nor through
&gt; &gt; the miasma of the Carter years nor through the
&gt; &gt; cowardly Clinton years.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;(Corporates too)

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Taxing businesses is a charade designed to placate
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;the ignorant. Businesses pass those taxes on to
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;consumers who buy the products and serves of
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;that business. This is economics 101.

&gt; &gt;&gt;Nonsense. Businesses can only sell what people
&gt; &gt;&gt;will pay for. Go back to school.

&gt; &gt; I don't think you grasped the reality of economics 101
&gt; &gt; which you've never acquainted yourself with.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;No complex rules, no attornies of accountants needed.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;We all ready have 97% of the world's attorneys who
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;have to generate law suits in order to put food on their
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;tables. Maybe we ought to limit the number of attorneys
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;that laws schools can crank out.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Makes it easier for ANYONE to get on a ballot ANYWHERE with
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the right number of verified signatures.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;The problem is not a lack of access to the ballot. The problem
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;is that illegals, cadavers, animal pets and other unqualified
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;voters are able to vote and have their votes counted. That
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;democrat operatives can disqualify the absentee ballots
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;of our men and women in the military. That the DNC house
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;organs like CBS can announce the election results before
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;the polls are closed when those polls are in Republican
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;districts in the Florida panhandle.

&gt; &gt;&gt;Geez, what a load of crap.

&gt; &gt; You're either retarded or have been extremely
&gt; &gt; sheltered all your life.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Makes the TV stations pay their way in running political ads.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Do you mean stations should provide free time for political
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;ads?

&gt; &gt;&gt;Exactly.

&gt; &gt; Station would then either go broke or refuse to broadcast
&gt; &gt; all political ads.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Simple, straightforward. America first.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Are you running out of steam here?

&gt; &gt;&gt;No, You Neocons are.

&gt; &gt; Whatever a Neocon is. Perhaps you would
&gt; &gt; be kind enough to define Neocon. It appears
&gt; &gt; to be a pejorative term tossed about by the
&gt; &gt; leftwing loons.

&gt; &gt; And you know this how?

&gt; &gt;&gt;Vote accordingly in '08.

&gt; &gt; I plan to but not for the dimwitted socialists your
&gt; &gt; party has been parading before the American
&gt; &gt; people.

&gt; &gt;&gt;Governments should fear their people, not vice versa.

&gt; &gt; Really are you afraid of the government? Do you think
&gt; &gt; they will come in the night for you like they did for Elian
&gt; &gt; Gonzalez? Or do you fear the government will come
&gt; &gt; and burn you alive like they did those folks in Waco?

&gt; &gt;&gt;Abolish the senate - its undemocratic and serves no purpose.

&gt; &gt; Excellent idea! Then we can rename the US Congress the
&gt; &gt; US Politoburo.

&gt; &gt;&gt;30% of Congress are NOT bought and paid for.

If you think that the administration that pulls out of Iraq won't be

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Upholds the Constitution.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;All federal employees including the military are sworn to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;support and defend the US Constitution. Any who break
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;that oath are subject to punishment.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;A lot of people broke the law with regard to wiretapping.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Where's their punishment?

&gt;&gt;&gt;Not according to the Judiciary. Only in your wet dreams.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Cuts the influence of the corporatocracy and lobbyists and unions.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Corporatocracy? This sounds like a red herring to me. All citizens
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;have the right to lobby the government.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;So make it only for citizens and not corporations or foreign
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;governments. Lobbying only for citizens by citizens.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Citizens need to band together and hire representatives
&gt;&gt;&gt;to lobby congress effectively. Most citizens have a life
&gt;&gt;&gt;to live and a family to support and so don't have the time
&gt;&gt;&gt;to waste on career politicians.

&gt;&gt;&gt;And you know this how?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Vote accordingly in '08.

&gt;&gt;&gt;I plan to but not for the dimwitted socialists your
&gt;&gt;&gt;party has been parading before the American
&gt;&gt;&gt;people.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Governments should fear their people, not vice versa.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Really are you afraid of the government? Do you think
&gt;&gt;&gt;they will come in the night for you like they did for Elian
&gt;&gt;&gt;Gonzalez? Or do you fear the government will come
&gt;&gt;&gt;and burn you alive like they did those folks in Waco?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Abolish the senate - its undemocratic and serves no purpose.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Excellent idea!

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;What you really want---is to oust MINE

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Yours have ousted themselves and after '08 will be
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;a minority in Congress and the WH, probably never to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;return for a long, long time

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Unlikely.  After all, after the next election, the new administration
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;will still have Iraq.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Only if they're spineless and don't send Bush and Cheney to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the Hague.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Even assuming they did something that crazy, they would still have
&gt;&gt;&gt;Iraq.

&gt;&gt;False, they could just give it to the UN, Iran and Syria to sort
&gt;&gt;out.

&gt; If you think that the administration that pulls out of Iraq won't be
&gt; saddled with the blame for the ensuing hostilities, and disruption, as
&gt; much as the administration that went in, you are sorely mistaken.

I am stunned that the so-called &quot;Christian&quot; community

hypocrisy. I guess so many of them have been Neoconned
into believing the only issues are gays, abortion and
stem-cell research that they have lost the plot completely.

Lets see how many charges are filed at the international
war crimes tribunal against Bush, Cheney and Blair.
When you're charged and you're innocent you have no
