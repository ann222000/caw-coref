Morbid obesity should be considered just as any other physical handicap, and
the standard protocol for dealing with those extended to the morbidly obese.

If those in wheelchairs are accomidated for free of charge, so should the
morbidly obese. If they are not, neither should the morbidly obese.

should stay home and loose some of that lard.

"/> First off, stop top-posting Aurora.

Now, since when is gluttony and laziness a physical handicap? It isn't
and never will be despite what fat acceptors try to dupe people into
thinking.

People whose ass take up multiple seats on an airplane should absolutely be
required to pay for those seats. And so far on that poll the majority of
people agree with that notion - as they should.

To have a better idea how unpleasant it is to sit next to sweaty glutton on
a plane, take a look at
http://www.nypress.com/15/41/news&amp;columns/feature.cfm  - it is an excellent
article.

unwanted fat. Disease? Maybe some do have a disease, maybe not. Either
way, there are ways to slim down.

I'm not saying that fat people are stupid, lazy, inconsiderate or generally
not nice at all. I am saying that any one of them that expects to sit in
their seat and half of mine is very inconsiderate. I donate to the church,
the mission, a burn foundation and the Girl Scouts. I'm not about to donate
1/2 my seat on a plane to a fat person. Disease or not, buy two seats and

disease?!

you mean the &quot;disease&quot; of putting to many calories into your face?

I've got a sister in law with this disease... because of a power outage
(weather caused) at her home she and her family stayed with us for
several days.

for breakfast my wife has a slim-fast, I have a high protein shake (same
# of calories but 50grams of protein instead of 10)... when it was
mentioned that there were slim-fasts in the fridge... instead of 1 she
had 2... then 6 eggs.

"/> I never noticed it much until my preferred supermarket chain built an
enormous new store betwixt my suburb and another (a community which
apparently is a haven for the grotesquely morbidly obese (not just big
folks, like me, but big wide folks).

It started with the sort of prerequisite number of electric shopping carts
for the disabled, but the demands of what seems a large number of women
customers, many of them quite young (all folks who if they tried to board
WN would get a seat fit check) have made them convert an entire shopping
cart bay for a depot for storing and charging'em. The other day, my
neighbor, a double amputee from the conflict in Viet Nam was forced to wait
for a return as a truly desrving (of euthanasia) toaddess grabbed the last
one, telling him that since he had his own wheelchair he could use it and
push a cart.

I hope she gets stuck in the middle seat of the last row on an MD80 with an
overflowing terlet.

There are people who are genetically fat. There's nothing they can do
about it. They should not be penalized for something, such as
ancestry, over which they have no control. Nor should the carriers. I
have no answer.

There are people who are fat because of their failure to burn the
excess calories they consume: Two seats!

people who go on cruises have a tendency to be fat. Whichever, the

The question that needs an explanation is:
Why should a person too big to sit in one seat not buy two?

Or, in paraphrase:
Why should a person who occupies two seats not pay for them?

questions and aren't smart enough to answer, anyway.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Why asssume she doesn't like children, just because she doesn't one to
&gt;&gt;sit
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;next to one on an airplane.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Because she also wished fatness on someone after remarking that they
&gt;&gt;&gt; were a child. I thought it was a mean thing to do. So she's posted
&gt;&gt;&gt; bitterly a couple of times now. I was assuming she didn't like
&gt;&gt;&gt; children because both times it was mentioned but maybe she doesn't
&gt;&gt;&gt; like thin people.

&gt;&gt;I do not judge anyone by their size. You obviously do.

&gt; Please point out where I have done so. Now you are telling lies about
&gt; me?

&gt;&gt;I wished &quot;fatness&quot; on the person because I think it helps undertanding if
&gt;&gt;one &quot;walks in another person's shoes.&quot;

&gt; Everybody has problems in their life. It's not a requirement for
&gt; humanity to experience all possible problems. Do you think you need to
&gt; experience drug addiction to understand it better (I'm assuming you
&gt; aren't a druggie)

&gt;&gt;Odd how &quot;bitterness&quot; is only applied to views you do not share.

&gt; I don't know what views you are talking about. I've not seen you
&gt; express any views. Just ill will toward others, bitter girl.

&gt;&gt;I find that, very often, young children interfere with my privacy when in
&gt;&gt;close proximity. On a long trip, this can cause irritation. They are
not
&gt;&gt;yet old enough to understand civilised behaviour. I do not blame them: I
&gt;&gt;blame those parents who think that everyone should adore their child as
much
&gt;&gt;as they do.

&gt;&gt;Recently, on a shortish flight, I sat next to a teenage aunt who was
&gt;&gt;travelling with her small niece. She kept great control of the child and
&gt;&gt;the journey was great. They were great companions.

&gt;&gt;Unfortunately, that is not the norm, I have found.

&gt; I would agree with this. and you managed to say it with a positive
&gt; aspect instead of just sounding like a cranky old lady.

&gt; Jade

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I feel exactly the same way -- a heavy person
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;might not be able to respect my space, but they're capable of
respecting
&gt;&gt;my
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;privacy, my desire not to be bothered, my wish for a calm environment
&gt;&gt;that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;will let me sleep while flying, etc. I'll take a heavy person over a
&gt;&gt;child
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;as a seat mate on an airplane anytime (though, of course, my
preference
&gt;&gt;is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;that I not be required, involuntarily, to share my seat with anyone).

&gt;&gt;&gt; That's reasonable.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;My girlfriend has great-grand children old enough to carry on a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;conversation. I've been legally retired for years. My Body Mass
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Index is below 25. I eat enormous quantities of food and am
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;regarded as something of a freak and garbage disposer by many of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;my co-diners. I recently posted to rec.trave.cruises and, near
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the conclusion of a long post, said &quot;Did we gain weight?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Fortunately, no. Had we not been in the company of other
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;dancers, though, we probably would have.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;My mother, almost 91, lives in a place where many are older than
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;100. None of them is fat.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Then you are very lucky and should not snipe at people who are not
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;so lucky. Some people only have to consume 100 calories a day more
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;than the absolute number they need to become fat.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I am sorry for them.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Sure, stick up for the fatties!

&gt;&gt;&gt;Karen

&gt;&gt;Ridicule of fat people is not acceptable. YOu act like you will get
&gt;&gt;fat if you sit next to a fat person? Are you that phobic?

&gt; Lady Veteran, I hope that on your next airline trip you are sitting in
&gt; the middle seat of a row of three and on each side of you is a 500lb
&gt; blob hanging over into your space and afflicted with the usual problem
&gt; of fatso hygiene syndrome. You deserve no less.
&gt; In addition when a meal is served I hope they both sneak some of your
&gt; meal. It is also appropriate for you that the one in the window seat
&gt; makes frequent exits to the restroom squashing the hell out of you on
&gt; each journey.
&gt; After that experience you need to come back to the &quot;new reorganized
&gt; SSFA&quot; and relate your reactions.

obesity, the airlines must work for the comfort and safety of ALL their
passengers. Whether one is genetically obese or obese because they eat
too much and don't exercize, the result for the unfortunate person in
the adjacent seat is the same.

What's shocking to me is that you don't have to be all that obese to
overflow an airline seat these days. If you're a big guy - 6'-2&quot;, 250
or 260 lbs, you won't fit comfortably into an economy class seat. The
things are cramped for average adult males like myself!

Did he realize after the tenth attempt that his hint might be a bit
vague and maybe he should just ask people to stop?

Beyond that, I think expecting this many people to remove just the RV
group is being extremely naive about usenet. It is probably best to
just ignore the thread or killfile it.

One little thread isn't that hard to ignore.

But In the future, I will try to remember to look for the rv group and
sneck it from my responses to this thread.

FAT
I don't know whether fat people have a tendency to go on cruises or
people who go on cruises have a tendency to be fat. Whichever, the
proportion of fat people on this ship was extraördinarily high when
compared with what one usually sees in Coastal USA.

I come to praise the Los Angeles School Board for electing to pull
soda beverages from its schools. I've never understood why schools
permitted their students to have access to such unhealthful beverages
on school premises thus teaching them that they're OK. I hope that
they'll pull all high salt, high sugar, and high fat foods from the
schools and serve only healthful, well-balanced meals to the growing
bodies in their care.

FAT:
Waiting in amusement park lines can be tedius and looking at
others in the same situation is one of the most interesting things to
do. It didn't take me long to notice how fat the people were, so fat,
in fact, that I started to count them. It seems that every time I
counted, a third of the people I counted was fat. No, I don't mean
merely overweight and I didn't count beer bellies, either, but real
fat people, most of them quite young. Many of them also smoke
cigarettes. It's sad. Their lives will probably be very short.

"/> Icon,

I did notice a LOT of fat folks on a recent Carnival cruise. Of course,
I see a lot of fat folk everywhere (in the USA). We Americans are too
lazy: as a group, we seldom walk farther than the nearest parking
space. I've watched people sit for 5 minutes or more waiting for a
parking place closest to the entrance of a store, while I've parked out
in left field, walked to the door, and could have been in the store
shopping for all that time. (I do walk--2 miles a day at 4 mph. I
don't like it, but I do it for weight control and to benefit the old
ticker.) We drive between stores in shopping centers, we drive
EVERYWHERE. Part of the problem (though not all) is the lack of decent
public transportation in most towns. By contrast, in Europe, most
cities have good to excellent bus, streetcar, or subway service. Plus,
most European cities are more interesting to walk in than most American
cities.

Also, we eat too much of the wrong things. You sit down in a Mexican or
Italian-food restaurant in the states, and they set before you a plate
that could well feed 2 people. In Europe, though they may eat more
courses than we, the portions of each course are significantly smaller
than ours.

Finally, we are the fast food kings. Most folks would rather grab a Big
Mac, super-sized order of fries, and the obligatory Diet Coke, and DRIVE
to somewhere, than to sit and eat a sensible small entree and salad. I
shudder to see all the fast food places opening all over Europe, and
even in Japan.

Just my $.02 worth!

I do not think that fast food places openning up in europe will be a
hugh problem because like you said the mentality is different. People
will not order things everyday but will go once in a while and might
even order a salad to start. I think that the rise in obesity in
America is a direct result of personal choices and similar to what you
said, laziness. As someone who use to be overweight, I know it is not
easy, but it is choice of what we put in our mouths, not the choice of
the fast food companies that open around us.

"/> Alex,

Gotta disagree with you re: the fast food places. On my many trips to
various cities in Europe and Australia, I saw the McDonalds and Burger
King places simply mobbed--bye Europeans!

"/> Yeah! I think the fact that the language is different makes them less
fattening!

I suspect you've seen that bit that's been making the rounds of the
'Net, about how the various nationalities around the world eat all kind
of things, yet we &quot;colonists&quot; and the Brits are the ones who have all
the heart disease. The conclusion is that speaking English is hazardous
to your health!
