Michael Howard and spooks on brink of Rothschild funding deal      Published: 18 February 2007 http://news.independent.co.uk/business/news/article2279375.ece

Diligence, the corporate intelligence firm founded by former spies and chaired by the one-time Conservative leader Michael Howard, is close to striking a major investment deal with a member of the Rothschild banking dynasty.

The company, thought to be valued at around £30m, is understood to be in talks with an investment business called JNR, run by Nathaniel Rothschild, son of Lord Jacob Rothschild.

Under the proposed deal, Diligence's majority shareholder - a South American private equity firm -

will sell part of its 60 per cent stake. It is also thought that group chairman Richard Burt, the former US Assistant Secretary of State and chief arms control negotiator in the first Bush administration, will sell his 12 per cent holding and then leave the company. Mr Howard is European chairman.

Diligence declined to comment. However, sources close to the situation believe a deal could be struck within weeks.

Diligence was founded in 2000 by Nick Day, a former MI5 spy who also served in the Special Boat Service, and ex-CIA agent Mike Baker, who no longer works for the company.

Mr Howard joined on a part-time basis last year. He also sits on Diligence's advisory board beside Judge William Webster, a former director of the CIA and FBI, and Edward Mathias, a managing director of private equity group Carlyle, among others.

Diligence describes itself as an "intelligence gathering and risk management" firm. Like its larger rival Kroll, it has built a reputation advising clients on a range of sensitive issues, such as investigating fraud and money laundering, vetting potential overseas partners and providing security.

The business has grown rapidly since its inception, and now boasts offices around the world, including London, Washington, Moscow and Hong Kong.

The new investment, should the Rothschild deal go ahead, will allow it to continue expanding its operations. It is particularly focused on growing its presence in Asia.

However, the group is not without its controversial side. Clients are understood to have included Halliburton, US Vice-President Dick Cheney's former firm, while heavyweight Republican lobbying outfit Barbour Griffith &amp; Rogers has invested in the business in the past.

Diligence settled a dispute with accountancy giant KPMG out of court last year. The legal row centred on claims that Diligence staff had impersonated MI6 officers in order to steal information.

AN EX-CIA GREEDHEAD'S TASTE FOR THE RICH LIFE: In the process of being sent over

Kyle "Dusty" Foggo, a former executive director of the CIA, is entering the process of being sent to prison for accepting bribes from a friend who ran a series of shell companies in southern California.

His fifteen page indictment is here.

It contains a damning collection of suck-up e-mails to his friend, Brent Wilkes, and others, as well as a tally of rich tastes while at the agency.

While one does not wish to believe that higher-ups in the CIA are all in need of stringing up, reading the indictment doesn't do them or their clandestine service any favors. It is an aggravating litany of dumbshittery as well as overarching greed.

"From on or about July 6, 2001 to about November 3, 2004, [Kyle Foggo] was the senior officer in charge of support operations at an 'Overseas Location' and as such directed the Overseas Location's daily equipment supplying operations..." it starts.

"From on or about November 4, 2004 to about May 12, 2006, defendant Foggo was the Executive Director of the CIA (then the third highest position in the CIA), and as such directed the CIA's daily operations."

"From in or about 1993 through in or about 2005, defendant Foggo completed ethics training approximately eight times and served approximately two years as Deputy Ethics Official," continues the document, eliciting a horselaugh.

Foggo is accused of money laundering, committing fraud and "engaging in monetary transactions in property derived from specified unlawful activity," of essentially accepting rich bribes in goods, offers and material while coercing or arranging for CIA subordinates to award contracts to his friend, the crooked contractor, Brent Roger Wilkes.

The only thing the indictment does not reveal is where the CIA operations were that Foggo was screwing with in his quest for gain. Afghanistan? Iraq? Will we ever know?

Rich tastes, cigars, towering cakes, Russian beers and gypsy entertainers

Vlad  In 1979 he set out grimly to write the worst, most tasteless, most vulgar book possible. He had arrived at that stage of psychological masochism where one must prove one's most pessimistic assumptions are true, for the sheer delight of knowing once and for all that the universe is really a pisspoor proposition all around. "Public taste is a misanthropist's heaven and a humanitarian's hell," he said bitterly. For his hero, he elected a monster so monstrous as to be a mockery of all human hope, but one so obscure that he did not possess any of the evil glamour that surrounds a Hitler, a Nixon, or a Jack the Ripper. He picked Vlad Teppis--Vlad the Impaler--a fourteenth century Hungarian religious fanatic who had executed 100,000 people for differing with his own extremely odd theological notions.
Marvin's novel not only justified Vlad, but positively glorified him; it was full of denunciations of liberalism, permissiveness, and the opponents of capital punishment. It also had the most violent rape scenes Marvin could conjure out of his misogynistic imagination.
Vlad the Barbarian was a blatant incitement to violence, garbed in the most reactionary moralistic prejudices imaginable. It was bought by the first New York publisher to whom it was submitted, for a higher advance than Albert Speer's memoirs or any of the confessionals of the Watergate felons. A movie sale was negotiated even before the book was released, and John Wayne starred as Vlad, looking really sincere every time he explained why murder and rape were the highest human virtues.
Marvin was immediately commissioned to write a sequel, Vlad Victorious.

The psychoid nature of the reality game
But does it make sense to talk of psychic phenomena when trained pilots correlate radar signals with sightings of apparently flying craft? Perhaps not. However, psychic phenomena are culture-bound. In other words, the form they take is malleable, open to symbolic, cultural, and historical influences. A good example is the stigmata, peculiar to Christianity. Once Saint Frances had these symbolic wounds in the 12th century, they began to recur in the context of the Christian paradigm. The Geller effect, the case of copycat metal-bending in recent times, is another example of culture-formed psi effects.

There are fads of the paranormal. Ectoplasm, the once-popular mystic goo effused from the orifices of Victorian mediums, has vanished from the scene. Table-turning was the parlor game of the last century; metal-bending is that of the present. Paris of the early 18th century witnessed the Convulsionaries, an inspired sect who demonstrated absolutely bizarre immunity to pain and physical injury. Nowadays, people walk on fire pits full of smoldering coals.

If UFOs are mythic constructs, it is not surprising their physical effects fit the UFO construct. To look like real spaceships, they obligingly affect radar. But then, as if to underscore the joke on our reason, they often just vanish from the radar screen, which reminds us again that we are probably dealing with a very strange psychic phenomenon. A similar instance of this psychoid quality--this ontological ambiguity--was the light-goddess of Zeitun, for she was simultaneously photographed and yet remained invisible to the naked eye of some people. What kind of an object has such properties? The collective imagination of the human species must have some very strange powers indeed!
