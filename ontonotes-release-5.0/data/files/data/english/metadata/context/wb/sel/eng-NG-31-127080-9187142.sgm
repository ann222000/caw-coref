A while ago there was a discussion about the effect of ALA
Should we use the Racemic form or R form ???

What is the problem than ?
Some chemical compounds occur in two forms that look like the left- and
right hand glove.They are mirror images of each other.They are called
&quot;Optical Active Compounds&quot; because they filter the sunlight like a polaroid
sun glass.The left glove is called R (or D or +) and the right glove S(or L
or -).A mixture of 50 % R and 50 % S is called a &quot;Racemic mixture&quot;.Nature ,
most of the time , only makes one of the forms ; the other form might be
inactive or even harmfull.When such chemical compounds are made in a factory
than the result is a 50%-50% mixture of the left- and right form ; a Racemic
mixture.So the discussion was about : when we buy ALA should we take the
(cheap) Racemic mixture or should we go for the (expensive) optical pure
right glove or R form ???? So far all experiments I have seen either don't
mention the form of ALA or they use the racemic mixture.Is the other form
inactive ? Or is it harmful ? My guess is that it is just inactive because
no side effects were detected in all those studies , not even when large
dose were injected (in animals).In the study below they used (7)-a-Lipoic
acid  or DL-6,8-thioctic acid catalog number T-5625 from Sigma Chemicals.So
this is a racemic mixture because it says DL.... etc Have a look on the side
of Sigma and search for catalog number T-5625 if you want to be sure.So here
is one of the studies that detects a very positive effect (in animals) of
the (cheap) Racemic form . Which is : 50 % R (also called D , +) and 50 % S
(also called L , -)

The ability of LA to restore endothelial function, decrease systemic and
local oxidative stress and lower fasting glycaemia in aged diabetic rats
with hyperlipidaemia represents a possible pharmacological approach to treat
type 2 diabetes patients and prevent major complications associated with
this disease.

Br J Pharmacol. 2007 Oct 1
Effects of alpha-lipoic acid on endothelial function in aged diabetic and
high-fat fed rats.

Background and purpose:This study was conducted to investigate the effects
of alpha-lipoic acid (alpha-LA) on endothelial function in diabetic and
high-fat fed animal models and elucidate the potential mechanism underlying
the benefits of alpha-LA.Experimental approach:Plasma metabolites reflecting
glucose and lipid metabolism, endothelial function, urinary albumin
excretion (UAE), plasma and aortic malondialdehyde (MDA) and urinary
8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) were assessed in non-diabetic controls
(Wistar rats), untreated Goto-Kakizaki (GK) diabetic and high-fat fed GK
rats (fed with atherogenic diet only, treated with alpha-LA and treated with
vehicle, for 3 months). Vascular eNOS, nitrotyrosine, carbonyl groups and
superoxide anion were also assessed in the different groups.Key
results:alpha-LA and soybean oil significantly reduced both total and
non-HDL serum cholesterol and triglycerides induced by atherogenic diet.
MDA, carbonyl groups, vascular superoxide and 8-OHdG levels were higher in
GK and high-fat fed GK groups and fully reversed with alpha-LA treatment.
High-fat fed GK diabetic rats showed significantly reduced endothelial
function and increased UAE, effects ameliorated with alpha-LA. This
endothelial dysfunction was associated with decreased NO production,
decreased expression of eNOS and increased vascular superoxide production
and nitrotyrosine expression.Conclusions and implications:alpha-LA restores
endothelial function and significantly improves systemic and local oxidative
stress in high-fat fed GK diabetic rats. Improved endothelial function due
to alpha-LA was at least partially attributed to recoupling of eNOS and
increased NO bioavailability and represents a pharmacological approach to
prevent major complications associated with type 2 diabetes.British Journal
of Pharmacology advance online publication, 1 October 2007;
doi:10.1038/sj.bjp.0707474.

Hi Gys,

As 1/2 of the parties involved with the previous discussion on the R
vs Racemic forms of lipoic I feel compelled to chime in.

As I stated over and over in the previous thread the evidence for
racemic mixture is well established, as the reference you provided
futher establishes.

I just happened to mentioned that when the R and S components are
specifically examined to tease out their differences, the S components
falls very short compared  to the R.

In brief: (references at end of post)

1. The R type increases in vitro basil cell uptake of glucose, whereas
the S type in either much less efffective or not effective at all.

2. In vivo testing show the R type increase glucose uptake to insulin
by 34%. The S type had no effect.

3. In vivo testing showed the R type decreased insulin demands by 17%,
but the S type increased insulin by 15%.
(This is a negative result)

4. The R type decreased FFA by 30% but the S type had no efffect.

5. The S type decreased GLUT 4 by 19%, whereas the R form had no
effect.

6. The R form increased mobilizatoin  GLUT 4 where as the S form
actually no or an negative effect

7. The R form increased glucose metabolism by 30% and increased
storage of glycogen by 26%.

.
Although the R form is more expensive that the racemic type, the cost
has come down if you know where to shop of it. At www.vitacost.com a
high quality source is available for $12.00 60 capsules at 100mg.
And remember a 100mg or R = 200 mg of racemic type.

Once again I'm not telling people that they should dispose of their
racemic stuff, I'm just responding to query of why I think it might
have some benefits.

And finally Gys, I would appreciate it if you could review www.r-lipoic.com
and let me know what you think. I think you would enjoy the
presentation and all statements are referenced so you can check it
out.

Randy F

I've recentl y been looking into my alpha lipoic acid dose.

I was chekcing out the double-strength R-ALA on the Swanson
site, then saw Susan's testimony that the  regular kind works just
fine, and decided to get the much less expensive kind that comes
in 600mg per capsule.

So is it like the S- form negates the R-form in the regular stuff?

Most of the research showing benefits used the racemic form.

The R form will definitely work as well and I (and most of the lipoic

Hi Randy thx for all the links,
if you are the Randy I know than welcome back,if you are an other Randy than
just welcome  :)

I'm T2D
Metformine
Diet &amp; Exercise

I have a lot of neuropathy and I take Alpha Lipoic Acid for that.I know the
effect well , I worried about it myself but finally decided to take the
Racemic mixture.

Your discussion renewed my interest in the subject.I looked further but
could not find much additional arguments.I have a lot of literature on ALA
and a , that is for me , serious adverse side effect is not mentioned.Not
even in studies where lots of ALA is injected in the blood stream.

My most urget question : do you have research from  after 2000 stating that
the S-form is toxic ?

Here are a few points.I will add my ratings between 0 and 10 for keeping
what I have now.Seems a fair thing to do , so other people can decide for
themselves. I use the racemic form from Jarrow Formulas, Alpha Lipoic
Sustain 300 with Biotin, 300 mg which I buy from iHerb :
http://www.iherb.com/ProductDetails.aspx?c=1&amp;pid;=143&amp;at;=0

1) I'm using it for the last 2 years , it helps me and I did not notice any
bad effects : + 10

2) In all the literature I have , from 1995 till 2007 there is never a
negative effect mentioned
for the S-form , not even when large doses are injected in the blood
stream.Here is the last one where they also used the racemic form :
Br J Pharmacol. 2007 Oct 1
Effects of alpha-lipoic acid on endothelial function in aged diabetic and
high-fat fed rats.
Conclusions and implications:alpha-LA restores endothelial function and
significantly improves systemic and local oxidative stress in high-fat fed
GK diabetic rats. This represents a way to prevent major complications
associated with type 2 diabetes.
PMID: 17906683
+ 10

3) In Germany ALA is given to Diabetes patients on docters prescription.You
get the sustained Racemic form +10

4) The price.NSI R-Lipoic Acid Bioenhanced Na-RALA -- 100 mg - 60 Capsules
$11.99$ = 2$/g . Jarrow Formulas, Alpha Lipoic Sustain 300 with Biotin, 300
mg, 60 Tablets $16.77 = 1$/g So if only the R-form is active and the S-form
does nothing than the price is exactly equal +0

5)ALA is quickly used/converted so you need the sustained form.The one I use
is time-released ,the R-form you mention not .Do you know if there is a
stable time released form sold some where ???  +10

6) I can find iHerb and Jarrows in Google with 1 click .Both seem trusted
firms.I cannot find Nutraceutical Science Institute.Do you know if they can
be trusted ?

Here are a few other points :
All medicine is made in factories , a lot are optical active.Separation
of the enantiomers is so difficult that it is not done.The S-form is
inactive.It does nothing at all.There are a few sad examples where the S
form is toxic.One is Thalidomide in which the R(+) enantiomer has a sedative
effect and the S(-) enantiomer is teratogenic.See :
http://www.rlc.dcccd.edu/MATHSCI/reynolds/thalidomide/chemistry/chemi...

To circumvent patents a few medicines are now offered optical pure.Chiral
Technology: New Markets at Hand :
http://www.frost.com/prod/servlet/market-insight-top.pag?docid=JEVS-5...

And also :
http://pubs.acs.org/cen/coverstory/7843/7843scit1.html
The chiral drug industry soared through a major milestone last year, as
annual sales in this rapidly growing segment of the drug market topped $100
billion for the first time. These compounds now represent close to one-third
of all drug sales worldwide.

I don't think this is a bad thing. There is very little research going on
because no profit can be made with ALA.Maybe this will change if the R -form
can be patented.

I found a free explanation of the effects of enantiomers
where all the possibilities of their separate effects are mentioned :
http://www.it03.net/com/oxymatrine/down/1157099798.pdf :
Examination of the pharmacodynamic properties of a pair of enantiomers may
yield a number of possible scenarios: The required activity resides in a
single stereoisomer, the enantiomer being biologically inert. Both
enantiomers have similar pharmacodynamic profiles. The pharmacodynamic
activity of a pair of enantiomers differs so that both may be marketed with
different therapeutic indications. The enantiomers may have opposite effects
at the same biological targets. One stereoisomer may antagonize the adverse
effects of its enantiomer. The required activity resides in both
stereoisomers, but the adverse effects are predominantly associated with one
enantiomer. The adverse effects are associated with both enantiomers, but
the required effect is predominantly associated with one enantiomer.

Hi Gys,

Its the same Randy and thanks for the welcome back.

Its a comfort to see your keen energetic investigative spirit is alive
and well.
Also its much less lonely here (I know there are others) knowing at
one other person is interested in finding whats true and reasonable as
opposed to confirming the (religious type) belief systems.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;From the results I've seen the S enantiomer is generally less

effective than its R(+) brother.
Only in a one or two tests did it have a negative (increased insulin
as opposed to decreased insulin)

And as you point out most the of the positive results have been from
studies that used the racemic formulation.

I haven't searched for more recent published info comparing the two
but its seems more and more researchers are now using the pure R+
form.

What you might find interesting is what some of the top research
scientist are saying at conferences and special publications.

Here's some stuff I dug up from Tom Hagan and Bruce Ames. These are
two heavy weight researchers in this area:

&quot;We're finding - and others are, too - that the R(+)-form - the
natural form - is much more powerful than the racemic mixture ...
Hopefully ... companies are going to be producing on more of a
clinical scale the R(+)-form of lipoic acid, because we're finding
very significant effects using this, as opposed to the racemic
mixture.&quot; -Tory Hagen. Mitochondrial Decay in Aging: Reversal with
Dietary Supplementation. 29th Annual ISOM Conference (2001).

&quot;Lipoic acid sold in a health food store is a synthetic mixture, a
racemic mixture. And R is the natural form and S is some unnatural
one. R is reduced in mitochondria, S is reduced in the cytoplasm. And
in our hands R works and S doesn't.&quot; -Bruce Ames: Strategies for
Engineered Negligible Senescence meeting (2000).  Transcript here:
http://research.mednet.ucla.edu/pmts/sens/transframe.htm &quot;

Here's a link to info on a patent request for the R type for use with
diabetes and related ailments. http://www.freepatentsonline.com/6284787.html

ALL of the published data from Hagen and Ames (1-8) was the result of

NSI is the home brand of VitaCost. I have faith in this particular

This is a good and pertinent issue and I have my concerns also. I can
call the NSI folks (they actually have a tech support staff) and ask
them where they get the R+ stuff and if they had it randomly tested.

I've heard that there are only two manufacturing plants for R+. One in
Germany and the other in China (thats very scarey). I suspect that the
low cost R(+) is coming from China.

For gaurantted high quality check out www.AOR.com/ca . They get their
stuff from Germany but its extemely expensive.

Use your judgment. Check out the references. Are they from peer

studies available?

The site itself was put out by AOR a supplment company ( the best one
on the planet IMHO).
They are also the most expensive supplement company I know of. I
rarely buy from them.

Sorry its very late here. I suggest you review my post to Gys on this
thread. Also you might wnat to review my post on the earlier thread
where I provided more references

IMO, the racemic stuff works, but the R+ is better. How much better I

This is a very general problem in drug research. It's always easier
and cheaper in the lab to make the biochemically mixed form of a drug
with both left and right handed forms of the molecules. But generally
speaking biology only produces one form, e.g. only left handed amino
acids and right handed sugars. The question then arises of what
happens if you give an animal both forms mixed together. Sometimes the
wrong-handed version is completely inactive, and merely dilutes the
other. Sometimes it's less active. Sometimes it produces side effects
which can be mild or severe. And so on.

So with any particular drug or supplement which is complex enough in
structure to have handed forms and lab made rather than purified from
a biological source the question always arises of whether you need to
get rid of the wrong handed form because it has deleterious
effects. There's no general answer, you simply have to test. Sometimes
it does some good, sometimes it doesn't matter, sometimes it does some
harm. In that case the question aries of how tolerable the harm is.

The general term for this, for anyone who wants to check it out, is
homochirality.

You have to be a little cautious of unqualified remarks like this,
because we're here entering the realm of patent and marketing wars
between drug companies. If one form is active, and the other inactive,
then of course the pure one-handed form will be exactly twice as
powerful as the racemic mixture, but otherwise it doesn't
matter. However, some drug companies will denigrate the racemic
mixture sold by a competitor, and praise their own purely one-handed
form, by saying theirs is the only from is which is the pure
biologically active form, and it's twice as powerful. Which sounds
good, but it's just advertising bullshit.

All that matters is whether the optically wrong handed version has any
significant bad effects.

Hi dumb_fishie99,

Randy thinks they are , I don't know.The information is only partly correct
and honest.They just leave out the uncomfortable bits or exaggerate it a
bit.I'm prepared to give them the benefits of the doubt however.All
commercials do those things of course.

The facts I found :

1) The R-form is the natural one that has all the benefits

2) The S-form is not made by the body ; is the un-natural one.

3) The S-form is a by-product of the chemical production process which is so
much less subtle than the synthesis of the stuff in the body

4) This is all not surprising , it is true for all man-made chemicals and
thus true for all medicine.

5) The S-form   _CAN_   have all sorts of adverse effects , it  _CAN_  even
be lethal !! while at the same time the R-form heals you.... Maybe this is
very susprising to you as the R-form and the S-form are mirror images of
each other : they are equal as the right- and left glove !! But hey....
that's how subtle the human body works apparently.In the case of Alpha
Lipoic Acid however the scientific literature finds that for most effects
the S-form does nothing at all , for some effects it only does 25 % or so
and I have only 1 article from 1997 which says the the effect on insulin is
counter productive.But that is only one of the effects in only 1 very old
article.At the same time there is newer literature where the negative effect
of the mixture of the (R-form + the S-form) is not found.

Complicated

As always in real life  :(

But Randy is very right : the R+ form is the powerfull one and even the FDA
is so worried about the differences about R and S that the new rules are :
either you make a pure optical form of a drug OR you just make a racemic
mixture but THAN YOU HAVE TO TEST BOTH FORMS as if it were difference drugs
!!!! Now think about it.The drug companies must now produce the pure form
beneficial to the human body , or they have to go through the painfull
proces for testing ALL the effects AND side-effects for actually TWO drugs
!!!!! For them they need TWO groups of patients.They will have to give one
group something that may be harmfull.....The ethical committees will not
allow that I think.Look here :

http://www.fda.gov/cder/guidance/stereo.htm

FDA'S POLICY STATEMENT FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW STEREOISOMERIC DRUGS

I. INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND

Stereoisomers are molecules that are identical in atomic constitution and
bonding, but differ in the three-dimensional arrangement of the atoms. For
the purpose of this document, the stereoisomeric pairs of greatest interest
are those with one or more asymmetric (chiral) centers whose enantiomers
(individual stereoisomers) are mirror images. They have essentially
identical physical (except for optical rotatory) and chemical (except in a
chiral environment) properties

Applications for enantiomeric and racemic drug substances should include a
stereochemically specific identity test and/or a stereochemically selective
assay method The choice of the controls should be based upon the substance's
method of manufacture and stability characteristics.

The document is very worthwhile to read ,I think,because it explains the
difficulties and also lists examples of drugs for which the S-form and the
R-form were investigated.A few are equal a few are very different.

In fact there are now a number of optical pure drugs sold .Only the pure
R-form.Only the pure form that can be used by the body.

One example of the use of chirality to extend patent protection and so
manage a product's life cycle is AstraZeneca's plans for its Prilosec brand
of omeprazole antiulcer drug. AstraZeneca has redeveloped a
single-enantiomer form of the drug that it had previously been been
marketing as a racemate.

AstraZeneca of London, England, and Wayne, Pa., has marketed racemic
omeprazole in the U.S. since its approval here in 1995. But the
pharmacological activity resides in the (S)-enantiomer, and the patent on
the racemate runs out in 2002. So AstraZeneca will make a racemic switch:
The company has patented the (S)-isomer separately, which is known by its
own generic name esomeprazole. AstraZeneca's Nexium brand of esomeprazole
was approved for marketing in Europe in July, and the company expects
approval in the U.S. later this year

So , yes Randy is right

In Holland Alpha Lipoic Acid is not on prescription ; it is a &quot;supplement&quot;
and thus not under the rules of the Dutch FDA.Same thing of course for all
supplements we like to take  :(  So I hope that some pharmaceutical company
will patent the R-form ALA and sell it.Than we will finally get some good
research and quality control on R-ALA. The price is not my primary point.So
even when I find a place where the stable , time released R-ALA is sold by a
trust worthy firm just as a &quot;supplement&quot; I will switch to R-ALA

Sorry dumb_fishie99 for the complicated answer

Like always in real life we have to make important decisions on too little
information and we can be terribly wrong.

I changed my diet to almost exclusively raw veggies and lost all my teeth to
the acid salad dressing....BUT I got a hell of a HbA1c and cholesterol ;
never had better numbers  :)

In the old days when people did not have money to buy real butter the
hydrogen hardening of vegetable oil was introduced.They also add vitamin D
and E and the English disease was controlled.BUT years later it was
discovered that the hydrogen hardening of vegetable oils also introduced
trans fats in our diets which are causing all kind of hearth problems....

My mother gave my father chicken breast each day because she thought that it
was low fat and good for his health.He got a Campilo Bacter infection , a
perforration of his intestine and died.
http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dbmd/diseaseinfo/campylobacter_g.htm

Will , T2 thinks his diet with lots of raw veggies has to do with his gout
he is now suffering from.....

Take care

Hi Chris,
I agree with that , the problem is that I only found 1 , bit old , reference
which notice a bad effect and the effect is not reproduced in the newer
literature :

Am J Physiol. 1997 Jul;273(1 Pt 1):E185-91.
Differential effects of lipoic acid stereoisomers on glucose metabolism in
insulin-resistant skeletal muscle.

The racemic mixture of the antioxidant alpha-lipoic acid (ALA) enhances
insulin-stimulated glucose metabolism in insulin-resistant humans and
animals. We determined the individual effects of the pure R-(+) and S-(-)
enantiomers of ALA on glucose metabolism in skeletal muscle of an animal
model of insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia, and dyslipidemia: the obese
Zucker (fa/fa) rat. Obese rats were treated intraperitoneally acutely (100
mg/kg body wt for 1 h) or chronically [10 days with 30 mg/kg of R-(+)-ALA or
50 mg/kg of S-(-)-ALA]. Glucose transport [2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) uptake],
glycogen synthesis, and glucose oxidation were determined in the
epitrochlearis muscles in the absence or presence of insulin (13.3 nM).

Acutely, R-(+)-ALA increased insulin-mediated 2-DG-uptake by 64% (P &lt; 0.05),
whereas S-(-)-ALA had no significant effect.&lt;===Does not worry me

Although chronic R-(+)-ALA treatment significantly reduced plasma insulin
(17%) and free fatty acids (FFA; 35%) relative to vehicle-treated obese
animals, S-(-)-ALA treatment further increased insulin (15%) and had no
effect on FFA.&lt;==== May even be a good effect (????)

Insulin-stimulated 2-DG uptake was increased by 65% by chronic R-(+)-ALA
treatment, whereas S-(-)-ALA administration resulted in only a 29%
improvement.&lt;====Does not worry me

Chronic R-(+)-ALA treatment elicited a 26% increase in insulin-stimulated
glycogen synthesis and a 33% enhancement of insulin-stimulated glucose
oxidation.No significant increase in these parameters was observed after
S-(-)-ALA treatment.&lt;====Does not worry me

Glucose transporter (GLUT-4) protein was unchanged after chronic R-(+)-ALA
treatment but was reduced to 81 +/- 6% of obese control with S-(-)-ALA
treatment.&lt;==== This is the only one which does worry me but I have no other
references where this effect was reproduced ?????????

Therefore, chronic parenteral treatment with the antioxidant ALA enhances
insulin-stimulated glucose transport and non-oxidative and oxidative glucose
metabolism in insulin-resistant rat skeletal muscle, with the R-(+)
enantiomer being much more effective than the S-(-) enantiomer.

Hi Randy,
thank you for all your work and the links ; a lot of reading to do.I will
also try to find newer work of the authors.

I think we can agree than on this :
1) R-ALA is the only active form.
2) We don't know for sure yet that the S-form is counter productive
3) It is very unlikely that the S-form is toxic.

You are right of course and the FDA agrees (see my post to dumbfishie) If I
find a source for time released , stable R-ALA which is sold by a trust
worthy company than I will switch from the racemic mixture from iHerb to the
R-ALA.The price is less impotant for me if has works better and the chance
on bad side effects is smaller.

Thx again for the info

Hi Randy,
I found a number of recent articles where they just used the racemic mixture
and found positive effects of the Rac-ALA.Here is one of the latest :

Neurochem Res. 2007 Sep;32(9):1552-8. Epub 2007 May 3.
Mitochondrial ageing and the beneficial role of alpha-lipoic acid.

Oxidative damage has been implicated to be a major causative factor in the
decline in physiological functions that occur during the ageing process.
Mitochondria are known to be a rich source for the production of free
radicals and, consequently, mitochondrial components are susceptible to
lipid peroxidation (LPO) that decreases respiratory activity. In the present
investigation, we have evaluated mitochondrial LPO, 8-oxo-dG, oxidized
glutathione, reduced glutathione, ATP, lipoic acid, TCA cycle enzymes and
electron transport chain (ETC) complex activities in the brain of young
versus aged rats. In aged rats, the contents of LPO, oxidized glutathione
and 8-oxo-dG were high whereas reduced glutathione, ATP, lipoic acid, TCA
cycle enzymes and ETC complex activities were found to be low. Lipoic acid
administration to aged rats reduced the levels of mitochondrial LPO,
8-oxo-dG and oxidized glutathione and enhanced reduced glutathione, ATP,
lipoic acid and ETC complex activities. In young rats lipoic acid
administration showed only minimal lowering the levels of LPO, 8-oxo-dG and
oxidized glutathione and slight increase in the levels of reduced
glutathione, ATP, lipoic acid, TCA cycle enzymes and ETC complex activities.
These findings suggest that the dithiol, lipoic acid, provides protection
against age-related oxidative damage in the mitochondria of aged rats.

PMID: 17476591

Here is the material section of the article where they state explicitly that
the DL-form , or racemic mixture was used :

DL-a-lipoic acid 100 mg/kg body
weight/day was dissolved in alkaline saline (0.5%) and
administered intraperitoneally to the experimental animals.
Control animals received vehicle alone in a similar manner.
On completion of 30 days of lipoic acid administration, the
animals were sacrificed by cervical decapitation. Brain
tissues were excised immediately and immersed in ice-cold
physiological saline.

Linus Pauling Institute thinks we should use the Racemic Form of Alpha
Lipoic Acid :

Oregon State University
http://oregonstate.edu/

Linus Pauling Institute
http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/
http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/othernuts/la/

If you choose to take LA supplements, the Linus Pauling Institute recommends
a daily dose of 200-400 mg/day of racemic LA for generally healthy people.
Introduction

Alpha-lipoic acid (LA), also known as thioctic acid, is a naturally
occurring compound that is synthesized in small amounts by plants and
animals, including humans (1, 2). Endogenously synthesized LA is covalently
bound to specific proteins, which function as cofactors for several
important mitochondrial enzyme complexes (see Biological Activities below).
In addition to the physiological functions of protein-bound LA, there is
increasing scientific and medical interest in potential therapeutic uses of
pharmacological doses of free LA (3). LA contains two thiol (sulfur) groups,
which may be oxidized or reduced (Figure). The reduced form is known as
dihydrolipoic acid (DHLA), while the oxidized form is known as LA (4). LA
also contains an asymmetric carbon, meaning there are two possible optical
isomers that are mirror images of each other (R-LA and S-LA). Only the R-
isomer is endogenously synthesized and bound to protein. Free LA supplements
may contain either R-LA or a 50/50 (racemic) mixture

Glucose Utilization

There is limited evidence that high doses of LA can improve glucose
utilization in individuals with type 2 DM. A small clinical trial in 13
patients with type 2 DM found that a single intravenous infusion of 1000 mg
of racemic LA improved insulin-stimulated glucose disposal (insulin
sensitivity) by 50% compared to a placebo infusion (41). In an uncontrolled
pilot study of 20 patients with type 2 DM, intravenous infusion of 500
mg/day of racemic LA for 10 days also improved insulin sensitivity measured
24 hours after the last infusion (42). A placebo-controlled study of 72
patients with type 2 DM found that oral administration of racemic LA at
doses of 600 mg/day, 1200 mg/day or 1800 mg/day improved insulin sensitivity
by 25% after 4 weeks of treatment (43). There were no significant
differences among the three doses of LA, suggesting that 600 mg/day may be
the maximum effective dose (40). Data from animal studies suggests that the
R-isomer of LA may be more effective in improving insulin sensitivity than
the S-isomer (35, 44), but this possibility has not been tested in any
published human trials.

Supplements

Unlike LA in foods, LA in supplements is free, meaning it is not bound to
protein. Moreover, the amounts of LA available in dietary supplements
(200-600 mg) are likely as much as 1000 times greater than the amounts that
could be obtained in the diet. In Germany, LA is approved for the treatment
of diabetic neuropathies and is available by prescription (39). LA is
available as a dietary supplement without a prescription in the US (69).
Most LA supplements contain a racemic (50/50) mixture of R-LA and S-LA
(d,l-LA). Supplements that claim to contain only R-LA are usually more
expensive, and information regarding their purity is not currently available
(70).

Both the R and S isomers of LA were equally effective......

Diabetes. 2001 Feb;50(2):404-10.
Protection against oxidative stress-induced insulin resistance in rat L6
muscle cells by mircomolar concentrations of alpha-lipoic acid.

In diabetic patients, alpha-lipoic acid (LA) improves skeletal muscle
glucose transport, resulting in increased glucose disposal; however, the
molecular mechanism of action of LA is presently unknown. We studied the
effects of LA on basal and insulin-stimulated glucose transport in cultured
rat L6 muscle cells that overexpress GLUT4. When 2-deoxy-D-glucose uptake
was measured in these cells, they were more sensitive and responsive to
insulin than wild-type L6 cells. LA, at concentrations &lt; or = 1 mmol/l, had
only small effects on glucose transport in cells not exposed to oxidative
stress. When cells were exposed to glucose oxidase and glucose to generate
H2O2 and cause oxidative stress, there was a marked decrease in
insulin-stimulated glucose transport. Pretreatment with LA over the
concentration range of 10-1,000 pmol/l protected the insulin effect from
inhibition by H2O2. Both the R and S isomers of LA were equally effective.
In addition, oxidative stress caused a significant decrease (approximately
50%) in reduced glutathione concentration, along with the rapid activation
of the stress-sensitive p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase. Pretreatment
with LA prevented both of these events, coincident with protecting insulin
action. These studies indicate that in muscle, the major site of
insulin-stimulated glucose disposal, one important effect of LA on the
insulin-signaling cascade is to protect cells from oxidative stress-induced
insulin resistance.

&gt; A while ago there was a discussion about the effect of ALA
&gt; Should we use the Racemic form or R form ???

&gt; What is the problem than ?
&gt; Some chemical compounds occur in two forms that look like the left- and
&gt; right hand glove.They are mirror images of each other.They are called
&gt; &quot;Optical Active Compounds&quot; because they filter the sunlight like a polaroid
&gt; sun glass.The left glove is called R (or D or +) and the right glove S(or L
&gt; or -).A mixture of 50 % R and 50 % S is called a &quot;Racemic mixture&quot;.Nature ,
&gt; most of the time , only makes one of the forms ; the other form might be
&gt; inactive or even harmfull.When such chemical compounds are made in a factory
&gt; than the result is a 50%-50% mixture of the left- and right form ; a Racemic
&gt; mixture.So the discussion was about : when we buy ALA should we take the
&gt; (cheap) Racemic mixture or should we go for the (expensive) optical pure
&gt; right glove or R form ???? So far all experiments I have seen either don't
&gt; mention the form of ALA or they use the racemic mixture.Is the other form
&gt; inactive ? Or is it harmful ? My guess is that it is just inactive because
&gt; no side effects were detected in all those studies , not even when large
&gt; dose were injected (in animals).In the study below they used (7)-a-Lipoic
&gt; acid  or DL-6,8-thioctic acid catalog number T-5625 from Sigma Chemicals.So
&gt; this is a racemic mixture because it says DL.... etc Have a look on the side
&gt; of Sigma and search for catalog number T-5625 if you want to be sure.So here
&gt; is one of the studies that detects a very positive effect (in animals) of
&gt; the (cheap) Racemic form . Which is : 50 % R (also called D , +) and 50 % S
&gt; (also called L , -)

&gt; The ability of LA to restore endothelial function, decrease systemic and
&gt; local oxidative stress and lower fasting glycaemia in aged diabetic rats
&gt; with hyperlipidaemia represents a possible pharmacological approach to treat
&gt; type 2 diabetes patients and prevent major complications associated with
&gt; this disease.

&gt; Br J Pharmacol. 2007 Oct 1
&gt; Effects of alpha-lipoic acid on endothelial function in aged diabetic and
&gt; high-fat fed rats.

&gt; Background and purpose:This study was conducted to investigate the effects
&gt; of alpha-lipoic acid (alpha-LA) on endothelial function in diabetic and
&gt; high-fat fed animal models and elucidate the potential mechanism underlying
&gt; the benefits of alpha-LA.Experimental approach:Plasma metabolites reflecting
&gt; glucose and lipid metabolism, endothelial function, urinary albumin
&gt; excretion (UAE), plasma and aortic malondialdehyde (MDA) and urinary
&gt; 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) were assessed in non-diabetic controls
&gt; (Wistar rats), untreated Goto-Kakizaki (GK) diabetic and high-fat fed GK
&gt; rats (fed with atherogenic diet only, treated with alpha-LA and treated with
&gt; vehicle, for 3 months). Vascular eNOS, nitrotyrosine, carbonyl groups and
&gt; superoxide anion were also assessed in the different groups.Key
&gt; results:alpha-LA and soybean oil significantly reduced both total and
&gt; non-HDL serum cholesterol and triglycerides induced by atherogenic diet.
&gt; MDA, carbonyl groups, vascular superoxide and 8-OHdG levels were higher in
&gt; GK and high-fat fed GK groups and fully reversed with alpha-LA treatment.
&gt; High-fat fed GK diabetic rats showed significantly reduced endothelial
&gt; function and increased UAE, effects ameliorated with alpha-LA. This
&gt; endothelial dysfunction was associated with decreased NO production,
&gt; decreased expression of eNOS and increased vascular superoxide production
&gt; and nitrotyrosine expression.Conclusions and implications:alpha-LA restores
&gt; endothelial function and significantly improves systemic and local oxidative
&gt; stress in high-fat fed GK diabetic rats. Improved endothelial function due
&gt; to alpha-LA was at least partially attributed to recoupling of eNOS and
&gt; increased NO bioavailability and represents a pharmacological approach to
&gt; prevent major complications associated with type 2 diabetes.British Journal
&gt; of Pharmacology advance online publication, 1 October 2007;

Hi Gys,

First thanks for an outstanding and tedious job in illuminating all
the related perspectives on this issue.

I agree with your conclusion, the racemic stuff has been demonstrated
to have powerfull positve effects without apparent interference for
the S(-) enantomer

Although there is some evidence that the S(-) is not as powerfull and
can be determental, the overwhelming experimental results show there
is not much need for worry.

Personally I still have a slight favoring towards the pure stuff. I
can't let go of the fact that most of the researchers deep in the
trenches still prefer the  pure R(+).

Here's a quote I found from the patent application for the  R(+) form
regarding treatment for diabetes:

//
*************************************************************************** *************************************************
&quot;...R-(+) alpha lipoic acid is suitable for the treatment of diabetes
and insulin resistance... the S-(-) alpha lipoic acid practically is
not
usable for this... Our own investigations have shown ... the key
enzyme,
pyruvate dehydrogenase, surprisingly was inhibited by the S-(-) alpha
lipoic acid... preferably R-(+)-.alpha.-lipoic acid proves to be
suitable for the treatment of diabetes mellitus types I and II and
its
sequelae and late complications and for the treatment of sub
clinically and clinically manifest insulin resistance and its
sequelae.&quot;
Use of R-(+)-alpha.-lipoic acid, R-(-)-dihydrolipoic acid and
metabolites in the form of the free acid or as salts or esters or
amides for the preparation of drugs for the treatment of diabetes
mellitus as well as its sequelae. United States Patent 6,117, 889.
September 2000. Klaus Wessel, Harald Borde, et al.
//
*************************************************************************** *****************************************************

I leave this discussion with two doubts:

1. Most of the discussion in the literature was done 10 -6 years ago.
Does this mean to topic is settled and researchers have nothing more
to add.

2. Is the commericial supply of the R(+) more suspect to quality
issues than the racemic form. My understanding is that there are only
two sources available, one from Germany and China. I bet the low cost
R(+) form hitting the markets is from China and thats scarey.

Thanks for all your efforts and your well organized presentation.

?????????
You lost me here dumb_fishie99.......

One kind is : R-ALA
The other kind is : S-ALA

The factories can only produce the 50 - 50 % mixture of those because their
crude chemical synthesis ALWAYS produces a mixture and never one of the pure
forms.

This MIXTURE is sold as : Rac-ALA or : &quot;Racemic Mixture of R-ALA and S-ALA&quot;.
R-ALA , but also S-ALA are much more expensive then Rac-ALA because they are
both made by a very expensive separation procedure of Rac-ALA.

Your body is so more much subtle it just has the right enzymes to produce
what is needed : R-ALA

ALA is used in your body as an universal anto-oxidant.It is the &quot;work horse&quot;
for recycling other anti-oxidants like vitamin E and C.It is metabolised
quickly in the liver.It does not live very long , so it has to be
replenished.The time release form does just that : it slowly releases the
ALA from the pill in your stomag.The time release form has a bit of an
advantage.

Hi Randy,
we also agree there.
I also prefer the pure R(+)
And not only the researchers deep in the trenches prefer the right optical
enantiomer of a drug but also the FDA :

http://www.fda.gov:80/cder/guidance/stereo.htm
So now the FDA wants only the rightform on the market for any drug
sold.Period.

In the old days there was no question about it.The crude chemical synthesis
of any drug in a factory always produced a racemic mixture of the R and S
form.There symply was no way so reparate them !!!!!

Then there was this horrible accident with Thalidomide :
http://www.rlc.dcccd.edu:80/MATHSCI/reynolds/thalidomide/chemistry/ch...

where the R(+) enantiomer has a sedative effect and the S(-) enantiomer is
teratogenic ; causes cancer.I think this speeded things up.Now the
separation of the racemic mixture is technical possible but still
expensive.So now the FDA wants optical pure R drugs on the market and
nolonger Racemic mixtures.

Don't worry it really is true , the R is better and there are lots of

I don't know.I just think so because the separation of the racemic mixture
is very high-tech.That is why I hope that either the FDA also starts to
control all supplements or that some company files a patent for the R-ALA
and sees a profit in selling it.You are right of course we don't know what

Exactly
True for any supplement
I hope that it will be regulated

Now ALA is a special one
I originally took it for my neuropathy and it helps.In reading the
literature I discovered that it has a lot of benefits for any patient with
Diabetes.It is just not on the market because it can not be patented.

Hi dumb fishie,
No it does not because the profile changes in a matter of 15 minutes.So you
will just have 4 peaks of ALA in your blood and not a constant level of
ALA.I  also posted the actual article below for you.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; From Post #3 on that thread.

&gt; I love the google archives, cuz I don;t want to have to go buy
&gt; timed release after I just bought this stuff.
">

you have to decide for yourself of course and I agree that is a waist if you
just bought ALA to buy a new kind.But maybe you can make a better decision
next time than  :)

After 1/2 hour it disappears from your blood.Lipoic acid is absorbed with a
Tmax of 0.5 to 1 h and exhibits dose proportionality between 50 and 600
mg.The relative low bioavailability of lipoic acid may be due to a high
first-pass effect.The article in the link you gave uses bacteria to measure
the blood concentration of ALA.It is a bit crude assay.Here are the actual
results ( all in ng/ml blood) :
0h   1h  2h    4h
1.6  ?   84.0  11.1

The German group in the article below uses an analytical technique (High
Performance Liquid Chromatogrphy) and they measured every 12 minutes.They
found a peak value at 1h.Here are their results :
0h    1h     2h    4h
0.0  1150  500   100

So if you ask me they completely missed the peak.Both articles agree that
the ALA is cleared fast from your blood by the liver , thus if you take a
time released form the concentration in your blood will be more constant.

Here is a review :
Nutrition. 2001 Oct;17(10):888-95.
Molecular aspects of lipoic acid in the prevention of diabetes
complications.

Alpha-lipoic acid (LA) and its reduced form, dihydrolipoic acid, are
powerful antioxidants. LA scavenges hydroxyl radicals, hypochlorous acid,
peroxynitrite, and singlet oxygen. Dihydrolipoic acid also scavenges
superoxide and peroxyl radicals and can regenerate thioredoxin, vitamin C,
and glutathione, which in turn can recycle vitamin E. There are several
possible sources of oxidative stress in diabetes including glycation
reactions, decompartmentalization of transition metals, and a shift in the
reduced-oxygen status of the diabetic cells. Diabetics have increased levels
of lipid hydroperoxides, DNA adducts, and protein carbonyls. Available data
strongly suggest that LA, because of its antioxidant properties, is
particularly suited to the prevention and/or treatment of diabetic
complications that arise from an overproduction of reactive oxygen and
nitrogen species. In addition to its antioxidant properties, LA increases
glucose uptake through recruitment of the glucose transporter-4 to plasma
membranes, a mechanism that is shared with insulin-stimulated glucose
uptake. Further, recent trials have demonstrated that LA improves glucose
disposal in patients with type II diabetes. In experimental and clinical
studies, LA markedly reduced the symptoms of diabetic pathologies, including
cataract formation, vascular damage, and polyneuropathy. To develop a better
understanding of the preventative and therapeutic potentials of LA, much of
the current interest is focused on elucidating its molecular mechanisms in
redox dependent gene expression.

PMID: 11684397

Here is an article where the pharmacological profiel was measured :
Eur J Pharm Sci. 1999 Apr;8(1):57-65.
Dose-proportionality of oral thioctic acid--coincidence of assessments via
pooled plasma and individual data.

Thioctic acid (TA), a racemate of R-(+)- and S-(-)-enantiomers of
alpha-lipoic acid, acts as a powerful lipophilic, free-radical scavenger and
is used in the treatment of diabetic neuropathy. This trial investigated the
dose-linearity of enantiomer pharmacokinetics following the oral
administration of single doses of 50 to 600 mg TA (formulation provided by
ASTA (Medica)) in healthy volunteers. TA enantiomer concentrations in
individual and pooled plasma samples were determined using enantioselective,
high-performance liquid chromatography. TA was rapidly absorbed (tmax, 0.5
to 1 h). Maximum plasma concentrations (Cmax) of the R-(+)-enantiomer were
about 40-50% higher than those of the S-(-)-enantiomer (50 mg: 135.45 ng/ml
R-(+)-TA, 67.83 ng/ml S-(-)-TA; 600 mg: 1812.32 ng/ml R-(+)-TA, 978.20 ng/ml
S-(-)-TA; geometric means). The decline observed in the plasma concentration
was steep (t1/2, 0.5 h). The dose-linearity and proportionality of
pharmacokinetic parameters could be demonstrated on an intra-individual
basis and for the group geometric means. An analysis of pooled plasma
samples proved to be a suitable means for deriving reliable first-sight
results prior to individual assessments.

PMID: 10072479

Here is the article from your link :
Free Radic Biol Med. 1998 Sep;25(4-5):473-9.

A practical assay of lipoate in biologic fluids and liver in health and
disease.
A procedure for assaying lipoic acid concentration in biologic fluids and
tissues was devised using a eukaryotic protozoan Tetrahymena thermophila.
T.thermophila has a specific and sensitive (30 pg/ml) requirement for lipoic
acid. Unlike humans and other microorganisms, T.thermophila can not
synthesize lipoic acid; hence, its requirement for exogenous lipoic acid is
specific. The lipoic acid supplied to T. thermophila by the processing of
biologic fluids and tissues during the assay procedure, permits the
derivation of a practical assay for lipoate concentration as described here.
Lipoate concentration in biologic fluids and tissue obtained from healthy
humans, compared to those obtained from patients with renal and liver
disease, indicate deviations from normal during disease. Absorption
chartings of 200 mg of DL-alpha-lipoic acid in humans indicate a peak
concentration of lipoate in plasma 2 h after ingestion and then a steady
descent of lipoate to a baseline level after 24 h. With this practical
assay, it is now possible to chart lipoate's antioxidant activity and
therapeutic action during health and disease.

You know I;m really not sure *what* your stance is. I wish I
understood.

It sounds like nothing is for sure with this research yet.

The advantage is that I bought the reacemic kind, and then decided to
get the R-form too. What I will stick with in future is still being
determined.

I read last night the half-life of ALA is 1/2 hour.  That does not
mean it completely disappears from your body in 1/2 hour.
I read that it actually does stay in the body around 6 to 8 hours.

It's kind of like when you go the medical imaging clinic, and they
inject you with something radioactive.  There are differents kinds
of radioactive elements used for different organs.  The one they use
for the heart has a very short half-life, In fact I think it's about
1/2 hour.  But after they inject you and take the image, you are going
to be radioactive for quite a while. Just not as long as with some of
the other elements.  And they do have to jump on it right after the
injection to get a good image.

Also this stuff you quoted tends to agreewith me:

&gt; You know I;m really not sure *what* your stance is. I wish I

Ok,
my stance :

I want : The Time Release R-ALA from a good company that I trust with the
very high tech fabrication process.

Because R-ALA is the stuff that works . It does not contain a contamination
that my body can't use , so the chance on a side effect from such a
contamination is zero !! I just don't like to ingest something for no reason
at all !! This is all not very surprising because there is ALWAYS only the R
or Right Handed form of ANYTHING that works in the human body.Like amino
acids and Glucose itself of course  :)

The problem is that in a normal chemical synthesis in a factory you always
get a Racemic mixture , or Rac-ALA , a 50 - 50 % mixture of the R-ALA and
the S-ALA. So at best the S-ALA does nothing at all and you only have the
good effects of the R-ALA.In the worst case the S-ALA has some nasty side
effect.

Here are my considerations :
1) Like you I just bought new Time Release Rac-ALA ....  :(

2) I bought it from a very good company : iHerb (Jarrows) and I did a lot of
research on the net to choose them.Any supplement that you buy is not
regulated by the FDA.Theoretically then you could buy a supplement that
contains NOTHING of the substance that you are after.Or a supplement that
has a production flaw like the chinese herbs that cause the destruction of
your kidney....

3) I now have used this Rac-ALA from iHerb (Jarrows) for about 2 years and
it helps me a lot for my neuropathy.I did not notice any unwanted effect.

4) I do not like to change a &quot;winning team&quot;

5) All the research from 1990 till now has been done with Rac-ALA and I have
not seen a report that found a  TOXIC  effect of S-ALA.I found a LOT of
research that found that S-ALA does nothing at all but that does not worry
me because the Rac-ALA is still 50 % R-ALA.Also the newest research was done
with Rac-ALA (See my original POST).Also experiments where Rac-ALA was
injected directly in the blood stream did not report TOXIC effects.So the
chance that S-ALA is TOXIC is very low (But...not zero !!!)

6) In Germany the docter will give you a prescription for Rac-ALA when you
have T2D

7) I found a company that sells R-ALA but I don't trust them like iHerb
(Jarrows) . Vitacost : http://www.vitacost.com:80/ sells R-ALA from the
Nutraceutical Sciences Institute.I cannot find much of them on the net . The
price is really too low to be good for such a very high tech process.I can
find other firms that sell the R-ALA.I could also ask my university to buy
it for me from a respectable chemical company but then the price is far too
high.

8) I did not find any place on the net where they sell the Time Release
R-ALA

My conclusion :
I will continue with the Rac-ALA from iHerb (Jarrows) till I find Time
Release R-ALA from a good company that I trust with the very high tech
fabrication process.

Indeed
And...
NOTHING , NOTHING is sure with ANY Research
Research ALWAYS changes
That is the way it works
Science is NOT a religion
It ALWAYS will change
You will ALWAYS have to make up your own mind
There will NEVER be a book or a priest that knows it all from now till
eternity

Now you understand !!
What you will stick with in the future is still being determined
Keep reading and thinking
Make the best possible desision based on knowledge , not on belief

Yes
But as I said this quote is from research that uses a too crude method and
they did not even measure the value at 1h ( See POST above) .

But I gave you the original references , so decide for yourself
Let me know if you would like to have a copy of those articles
