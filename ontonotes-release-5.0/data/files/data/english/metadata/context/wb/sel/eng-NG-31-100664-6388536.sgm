Volaticotherium antiquus
By Michelle S. Keller
Chicago Tribune staff reporter
December 14, 2006

A furry, squirrel-sized creature that soared through prehistoric
skies--possibly even sharing the lofty view with birds' first
ancestors--suggests that mammals took flight nearly 70 million years
earlier than scientists had thought.

The evidence comes in the form of a squashed skeleton found in Inner
Mongolia that belonged to a tree-inhabiting creature born with a built-
in hang glider--a fold of furry skin that stretched between its front
and hind legs.
Previous discoveries of fossilized bats had led researchers to believe
that mammals developed the ability to fly about 50 million years ago,
long after dinosaurs had disappeared. But the fuzzy glider, estimated
to be anywhere from 125 million to 160 million years old, suggests
that flying mammals existed just as the first birds were emerging,
according to a report on the new finding being published Thursday in
the science journal Nature.

Scientists named it Volaticotherium antiquus, meaning ancient winged
beast, though the beast part might be a bit of a stretch for an animal
about 5 inches long.

"This is the first evidence of any of the mammals during the age of
dinosaurs developing the ability to have gliding flight," said Larry
Heaney, curator of mammals at Chicago's Field Museum. "Most of the
fossil mammals that we've known previously were pretty small, chasing
after bugs on the forest floor. This indicates that during this period
of time, fairly early on in the history of mammals, there was a lot
more diversity than we had thought."

Like the wing of an airplane, the extensive surface area of the flap
of skin--called a patagium--would have been enough to generate lift,
allowing the creature to travel horizontally through the air, said Jin
Meng, associate curator at the American Museum of Natural History in
New York and lead researcher of the study.

The ancient winged beast also looks to have possessed a stiff tail
that could act a stabilizer as it glided through the tree branches.

"A very sophisticated climber and a sophisticated glider," Meng called
it.

Though gliding and flying mammals flit about today--including blood-
sucking bats, flying squirrels, and an entire family of flying
possums--the extinct animal discovered by Meng and his colleagues is
different enough that it is likely to occupy its own early branch of
an evolutionary tree.

The exact age of the furry glider remains in question, in part because
there has been disagreement over the age of the layered, fine-grained
lake sediments where it was found in northeastern China. But if
researchers accept the earliest proposed age--164 million years--it
puts it in the air at about the same time as archaeopteryx, a
feathered creature considered the bridge between dinosaurs and the
birds.

"This finding will raise some questions about whether it was competing
with the earliest birds," Meng said.

Wings and other features that allow mammals, birds and insects to take
flight often appear similar, but the ability to fly has developed
independently several times, a phenomenon known as convergent
evolution. But unlike birds, which have the ability to flap their
wings in powered flight, the ancient glider likely just pushed off
from tree branches and allowed its parachutelike body to carry it
through the air, said Heaney.

The many examples of gliding and flight in the natural world have led
researchers to theorize on exactly what makes the ability to soar
through the air evolutionarily advantageous. The leading idea is that
flying or gliding "enables you to move through the habitat very
quickly," said John Scheibe, professor of biology at Southeast
Missouri State University, who has studied the evolution of mammalian
gliding. "You can forage over a much wider area and you can visit many
more locations."

The ability to fly also possibly allowed vulnerable animals to escape
from predators, which in this case might have included small
dinosaurs, Heaney said.

One characteristic that links many gliding creatures is their eating
habits: They tend to focus on food that is patchily distributed over
the landscape.

"It's not like with a cow, where [there] is an entire field of grass
and it's all good," Scheibe said. "All of the gliders tend to look for
little clusters of food. Their ability to glide makes it easier to
find what they need."

The teeth on the furry glider--sharp incisors--indicate that it likely
ate bugs, Heaney said, but its size indicates that it may have munched
on greens as well.

"Based on research on the living species of gliders, it's very clear
that body size of the animal has a very big impact on what food it is
likely to eat," he added. "This animal was pretty similar in size to
one of the flying squirrels you find in Chicago, which would make it
an omnivore, not a pure insectivore. It was moving into a brand new
niche."
