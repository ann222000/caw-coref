They Know What is Best for US

On the February 7, 2007, edition of MSNBC's Imus in the Morning, MSNBC
Hardball host Chris Matthews heaped praise on GOP presidential candidate
Rudy Giuliani. Matthews called the former mayor of New York City, former
federal prosecutor, and Reagan's special envoy to Haiti, "the kind of gutsy,
street-corner politician we all grew up with" who "stood on the corner
during the fire and told us what was going on."

Matthews said that he would like "[a] guy who wasn't on the ranch during
Katrina -- who was out on the street corner answering questions." Matthews
added: "I'm so sick of Southern guys with ranches running this country. I
want a guy to run for president who doesn't have a [expletive] -- I'm
sorry -- a ranch. Wouldn't that be good?"

Matthews again touted the progress Giuliani made in improving olfactory
conditions in New York City, asserting that "subways didn't smell like pee
anymore" and that "[e]ven the phone booths in New York have always smelled
like pee." Matthews made similar claims on the February 5, 2007, editions of
MSNBC Live and Hardball, both noted by Media Matters for America. Matthews
also claimed that Giuliani "made you feel like you had a right to walk the
street safely" and added, "I think the country wants a boss like that, you
know? A little bit of fascism there. Just a little bit. Just a pinch of it."

Giuliani knows a lot about pushing and encouraging pinches and slaps of
fascism.

Lessons on Torture and Murder by Rudy

In April 1982, as 2,100 Haitians sat in an American prison, their reward for
escaping the dictatorship of Jean-Claude Duvalier, then Associate Attorney
General of the United States, Rudolph Giuliani, told the courts and the
public that these people should be repatriated because, as Giuliani put it,
"The refugees had nothing to fear from the government of Jean-Claude
Duvalier" (roving bands of the Tonton Macoute notwithstanding).

In statements to the federal courts and the press, Giuliani said that
dictator "Baby Doc" Duvlier had personally assured him that Haitians
returned from the United States were not persecuted. "Political repression
is not the major reason for leaving Haiti," Giuliani concluded.

Years later, as mayor, Giuliani would let another group of blue-uniformed
thugs torture and terrorize Haitians and Black people, as he unleashed the
NYPD to enforce "Giuliani Time."

In 1997, after Justin Volpe had raped Abner Louima, who required surgery to
repair a ripped colon and a set of new teeth (knocked out with a feces
covered nightstick). Giuliani sided with lying cops who tried to cover up
the horrific abuse. I guess Giuliani felt that the city should not have paid
Louima $8.75 million in compensation for the night of hell - but then again,
Giuliani did not have to pay the bill!

In February 1999, after four of Giuliani's thugs gunned down an unarmed,
African immigrant, Amadou Diallo, from point blank range - only hitting
Diallo with 19 of 41 shots from a distance of five feet, Giuliani defended
their poor marksmanship; efforts to have the trial removed from NYC and then
the acquittal of White thugs who assassinated an innocent. The city settled
for $3 million.

When New York's murder machine killed Patrick Dorismond, we really learned
what Giuliani's pinch felt like ... and we could imagine what Il Duce might
bring to the nation as president.

In March 2000, Plan Giuliani encouraged two cops to descend like vultures on
a couple of marks - aka Niggers. An undercover cop approached Haitian
immigrant, Patrick Dorismond, and a friend and propositioned them to buy
some marijuana. (I think Giuliani would call this - detective work).
Dorismond and his friend responded in a way that would make Nancy Reagan
proud - he said "No." But moreover, Dorismond tried to get the "drug dealing
scum" away from him and began to attack the drug pusher! What was
Dorismond's reward for being the object of a sting? He was assassinated -
shot pointblank in the chest, because he REFUSED to buy drugs from a cop! As
an epilogue, the city paid the family of Dorismond a $2.25 million
settlement.

Those are the hallmarks of Giuliani time. Cops who gun-down innocents, try
to peddle drugs, and rape men in handcuffs. By the way, Volpe and his
attorneys blamed Louima's internal bleeding and near death experience (which
included broken teeth) on faggots. Not only are Giuliani cops thugs, butcher
and liars, but homophobic pussies as well.

9/11 Rock Star?

Let's move beyond one facet of the criminal record of Giuliani and look at
events that made the lispy womanizer a media darling. How did the Mayor
handle 9/11? In reference to 9/11, Matthews made the claim that Giuliani "is
a front-runner because the voters like this guy because during 9-11 he was
the one guy there on the street corner, not hiding like all the other pols
did."

Yes, I remember it well ... Giuliani was out front, with then EPA head
Christie Todd Whitman, whose credentials were that she had lost an election
as was governor of New Jersey - a high-polluting state. Giuliani pushed New
Yorkers to return to work - while the fires still raged and toxics filled
the air. After nearly three weeks, when chemical tests showed that the air
in New York had asbestos, fiberglass, and dust from pulverized computers,
glass and concrete, the "guy on the street corner" said:

"Although they occasionally will have an isolated reading with an
unacceptable level of asbestos ... it's very occasional and very isolated.
The air quality is safe and acceptable."[1]

In legalese we call this type of fraud, criminal conduct. But then again,
such trivializing of an environmental disaster like the implosions of WTC
buildings 1, 2, and 7 symbolize the care that neo-cons, the petroleum
industry, Big Pharma, and agri-business have for our environment and planet.
Il Duce has shown his stripes. He supports dictators, does not mind sticking
the public for the bill when White cops gun down the innocent, encourages
the drug war and all its inherent corruption (once at a fund-raiser in South
Texas he told listeners that we can stop drugs entering the US from Mexico
by getting better human intelligence, i.e. more cops inside the cartels?!),
likes to commit adultery, shows loyalty to his partners by putting them on
the public payroll, and ignores or denies environmental catastrophes. Yes,
this is exactly the kind of person whom Chris Matthews would applaud. I knew
the press was filled with liberals.

From the Horse's Mouth

Here is a partial transcript of Matthews from the February 7 edition of
MSNBC's Imus in the Morning:

MATTHEWS: The subways didn't smell like pee anymore. Even the phone booths
in New York have always smelled like pee ... And this guy cleaned it up, and
he made you feel like you had a right to walk the street safely. I think he
did a great job. ... I think the country wants a boss like that. You know, a
little bit of fascism there. Just a little bit. Just a pinch of it.

IMUS: Well, the lame observation being made by a lot of folks, maybe it's
not lame, but -- that he can't get the nomination because, you know the
right-wing nuts, you know --

MATTHEWS: that is such conventional wisdom, it is the kinda crap ... Look,
if you go down to Jackson, Mississippi, you go to Atlanta, Florida, you go
anywhere in the South to men's clubs for lunch, who is the number one
speaker they want? Giuliani.

You go around the suburbs of New York, Philadelphia, Detroit, Chicago, ...
all those suburban areas ... [people] say, "I still love my city I want to
go back. This guy Giuliani's saving my city for me." I mean, I felt that way
about Eddie Rendell in Philadelphia. We love good mayors 'cause we love our
cities, and Giuliani's the city guy.

And I'm so sick of Southern guys with ranches running this country. I want a
guy to run for president who doesn't have a fucking -- I'm sorry -- a ranch.
Wouldn't that be good? A guy who wasn't on the ranch during Katrina -- he
was out on the street corner answering questions. Giuliani was answering
questions.

[...]

MATTHEWS: I think Giuliani's the kind of gutsy, street-corner politician we
all grew up with. When there was a fire, the police commissioner showed up
with the fire commissioner and stood on the corner during the fire and told
us what was going on. We miss that.

IMUS: Oh, I love the guy -- no, you're not -- you're preaching to the choir
here.
