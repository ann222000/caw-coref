Hey,

I finally got to read Codex: Renegade Chapters. It was even worse than
advertised.
The stench of ignorance and apathy was eye-wateringly palpable.
I've only ever played Chaos in 40k (with a dash of GS Cult at one
point).
So, I can't see waiting 5yrs to play again, but the current 'offering'
is repellent to me.
Now, what's a poor Chaos player to do? Desperate times call for
desperate measures:

+++

Preheresy Legions

The Rant

For over a decade, 40k background has insisted that all of our weapons
and wargear are a jumble of mutant, obsolete JUNK. Despite this, we've
managed to stay competitive with the Darlings of the Studio on the
strength of our Daemonic Powers and Legion Specific Rules. Right up to
the present, this combo let us craft countless variations on the eight
Legions, with room for every conceivable &quot;Renegade Chapter&quot; in the
Black Book. But that's all gone now. We're left with just a watered-
down version of the Black Book, no Legions, and no Daemons capable of
fulfilling their former mission-critical roles.

The Horror

In &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot;, Colonel Kurtz famously suggests that a certain
clarity of thought is revealed to a mind that simply embraces The
Horror. Messrs Johnson and Thorpe, by their indifference, and their
thoughtless and dismissive words, have given me the impetus to embrace
the 40k version of The Horror. That Horror being, [sigh] the Space
Marine Codex. It's a measure of how truly awful the new Dex is, that
I'm even *considering* such a thing. Looking at the two books side-by-
side, I have to go with the lesser evil. YMMV.

Here's the Thing

Consider playing Chaos lists as though they represent Preheresy
Legions. This means using our Chaos models to represent a force from
@M30. Between Istvaan and the Siege of Terra, our Legions all shared
the same gear and weaponry as their Loyalist counterparts. Sometime
between 30k and 40k apparently, some of us lost our weapons, our
vehicles, our gear, our strength, our pride, our cunning, and ended up
as Renegade Chapters, the whimpering shadow of our former selves
represented in the new book. Tellingly, Loyalists still enjoy many of
the rules that have been ripped out of our Codex:

Retinues of Vets, Termis or just plain Marines.
Units of 5 Termis with 2 Reaper Assault Cannon.
(Autocannon represent &quot;preheresy&quot; Asscannon, obviously)
Termi Retinues are available, too.
Termi Tac Squad Champs are back!
All Combibolters become A2 Stormbolters.
Wargear is returned to its rightful place - The Armoury.
All the best Vehicle Upgrades are included, only cheaper.
Tons of Sorcerous Psi Powers - that don't suck.
Cheaper Predators.
Cheaper Plasguns.
HQ options that don't *all* cost 200-300pts.
Compare IC costs vs stats: Prince ~ Commander; Sorcerer ~ Librarian;
Lord ~ Chaplain

Warhammer 30k, Hardcore Edition

C:CSM implies that 40k Renegades abandon much of their nifty kit when
they break away. 30k Legionnaires abandon nothing. If we choose, we
can still field:

LR Crusaders.
Combiplas weapons.
Dedicated Assault Termis.
Plascannon and Multimeltas in Tac Squads.
Razorback Transports.
Cyclone MIssile Launchers.
Rending Skimmers.
Attack Bikes.
Techmarines and Servitors. (Iron Warrior players can have their Servo
Arms back!)
Veteran Skills to access cheap, Tank Hunting Lascannon!
Drop Pods. How long have we wanted these? Preheresy Legionnaires build
and take them.
Preheresy Legions Know No Fear, me Droogies!
Daemon models can represent Scouts - 18ppm for the same WS, S and A,
plus Move Thru Cover, Infiltrate, a 4+ armour save, BS4 and Sniper
Rifles? Talk about a bargain!

The Catch (What will we have to give up?)

Summoned Generic Daemons.
Gav rendered Lesser Daemons useless by dint of being weaker in assault
than the Marine Units required to Summon them. Why would I pay Marine
prices for a Unit with no ranged attack or armour save? I wouldn't.
I'd just take more Marines instead.
Generic GDs inevitably surrender VPs by killing my own Champions just
by arriving on the board. And, imo, 130pt forced-reserve CC models
that can't get movement bonuses, armour or decent weapons aren't
terribly tempting, anyway. Let's see, what else?

Defilers.
I'll just rename mine &quot;Whirlie&quot;, and get IF Barrage back. (Bas is
already renamed 'Vin')
Possessed.
Gee, an overpriced Unit whose effectiveness can't be guessed before
deployment. See ya!
Chosen.
This might be an issue if there weren't Infiltrators in the SM book.
There are - plenty.
Cult Marines.
I have seen the light - they're just Marines with Traits, right Gav?
Spawn.
Another overpriced random Unit. Except this one's random *and* non-
scoring! Buh-bye.
Obliterators.
[sigh] This one's the biggie for me. They'll just get promoted to
Termi Sergeants, I guess.
Special Characters.
This is another toughie. Our ultimate badasses relegated to generic
HQ's or skulking behind Secret Identities. Still, if they were real
soldiers, they'd probably opine, &quot;Renegade Chapters? Legionnaires have
chunks of guys like that in their stools!&quot;

Original Gangstas

I've put together a preliminary list of Legion Traits, in case
anyone's interested.
Mesdames et monsieurs, the Legions of Legend:

Alpha Legionnaires are Sombre and notably divergent -
'Don't Be Seen' gives Infiltrate and Acute Senses,
'Cleanse' gives the 2 AW option (Cultists = Scouts).
Drawback = 'Flesh' limits Heavy Support selections.

Death Guard are Stern, Courageous, significantly divergent -
'Cleanse' gives the 2 AW option,
'Trust' gives True Grit and Counterattack.
Drawbacks = 'Eye' limits Fast Attack selections, and
'Alone' means 'take no Allies'.

Emperor's Children are Dutiful and notably divergent -
'No Mercy' gives Furious Assault,
'Wargear' gives up to 6 Heavy Weapons squads.
Drawback = 'Glory' limits Terminator selections.

Iron Warriors are Wise and notably divergent -
'Scions' gets you Techmarine HQ (Warsmith),
'Wargear' gives up to 6 Heavy Weapons squads (Bas becomes Vin).
Drawback = 'Eye' limits Fast Attack selections.

NIght Lords are Courageous and Fierce, significantly divergent -
'Don't Be Seen' gives Infiltrate and Acute Senses,
'Blessed Warriors' gives them up to 6 Assault squads.
Drawbacks = Flesh' limits Heavy Support selections, and
'Alone' means 'take no Allies'.

TSons are Pious and Wise, significantly divergent -
'Suffer Not Heretics' gives Tank Hunters,
'Wargear' gives up to 6 Heavy Weapons squads.
Drawbacks = 'Glory' limits Terminator selections, and
'Alone' means 'take no Allies'.

Word Bearers are Pious and Courageous, significantly divergent -
'Suffer Not Heretics' gives Tank Hunters (Apostle = Chaplain),
'Don't Be Seen' gives Infiltrate and Acute Senses,
Drawbacks = 'Eye' limits Fast Attack selections, and
'Alone' means 'take no Allies'.

World Eaters are Fierce and notably divergent -
'Take It To Them' gives them back their BP/CCWs,
'Blessed Warriors' gives them up to 6 Assault squads.
Drawback = 'Flesh' limits Heavy Support selections.

The Happy Ending

Doubtless, there are some details that I've overlooked, but this
should be enough to provide food for thought. Some may feel that Codex
BA or Templars, etc, better fits the theme of their Legion. Well, if
so; have at it. I'm just pointing out a possible, albeit horrific
option to try and help bring some of the zest back into lists that
have, imo, been drained of their former life and color by certain
indifferent authors.

Obviously, The Horror is a temporary measure to keep our lists
interesting and unpredictable until GW comes to its senses and recalls
every copy of the Gavdex for ritual incineration and burial. Failing
that, it's going to be a long, long haul until the next Codex, and the
thought of only seeing the same three Chaos lists every game for five
years is just completely unacceptable. Of course, the SM Dex could get
'harmonized' in the meantime. If that happens, we'll just fall back
and regroup, but let us never tolerate the Legions being forgotten!

To those players who choose to embrace The Horror, I feel obliged to
add that you must consider the likelihood that Loyalist Space Marine
players of every stripe will view your Legio Whirlwinds and Drop Pods
etc, with fear and loathing, and, possibly, even some  measure of
hate. I have considered this possibility, and on reflection find that,
considering the alternative, I actually kinda look forward to some of
that.

Is that Chaotic, or what?    }|B&gt; ]

Yesterday I recieved my 40k chaos warlord from the collectors range of mail
order.  The one with the horned helmet and the big power axe.  Not because I
was really planning to build a chaos army for 40k - but just because I
enjoyed painting the figure.  But I've also got probably sixty rogue trader
era space marines that have been languishing in a storage box since I
decided to build a space wolf army instead of a loyal space marine army
using the 'vanilla' codex.

You have opened my eyes.  I do believe all my rogue-trader era marines will
work just fine a a pre-heresy legion.

Thanks for the good idea(s).

You know, this evil-minded chaos list that Playa came-up with kind of
brought to a head (like a boil on the ass of the 40k universe) a heretical
thought that has been growing in my mind.   To whit:

&quot;If Games Workshop went bankrupt tomorrow and all the molds were unavailable
for an extended period of time (ie, no new models or continued production
and no official tournament support) until new ownership of the GW IP
holdings could be decided:

What version of Warhammer 40k would you play?&quot;

My answer was easy.  I'd rever back t to 40K v3 in a heat-beat... and not
just because I already have ALL the v3 codexs and chapter approved stuff.
And since the only v4 codex I own is for the Eldar, I'd consider having the
craftworld codex back a fair trade for giving-up Autarchs, Harlequins and
Vengers with 18&quot; shurkien catapults.

&lt;weak grin&gt;

I've got all the important Rogue Trader era books.  I've got all the 40kv2
books.  And all the 40Kv3 books.

I'm beginning to think I have quite enough.

I suspect it would be v4 rules at launch, so v4 rulebook and v3 codex's,
also would mean I get my las/plas razorbacks back.

With all the regulation and standardisation I wonder what will happen to the
Space Puppys in v4. Or have they already been nerfed?

As someone who has a huge box full of metal squat models - including dozens
of bikers, mega-armor guys and trikes - I've always considerd doing just
that so I could at least field the little guys as 'squats'.  And not just
ImpyGuard or god-forbid, Orks.

Good luck.  Personally, I'd just write a set of sci-fi rules that reflected
my collection of miniatures.

An in my 40k universe, shurcats will shoot further than 12 inches.

If GW folded tomorrow, I believe the current ruleset would last a
bit.
Once 'official' sanction ceased, TOs would exercise broader powers.
Their judgements would stand as &quot;Chapter Approved&quot; or near-official.
Loopholes and inconsistencies would soon be amended by consensus.
Everyone would wonder why the Studio wogs hadn't managed it sooner.

It wouldn't last, though.

With no GW stock, 40k wouldn't be very popular with store owners.
Private clubs and amateur events might thrash on for a short while.
But realistically, 40k would all but vanish within three years, imo.
People would look back on it as we do audio cassettes.
Cut down in its prime . . .

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; I'm thinking about going through my RT/2nd/3rd books

First, you'd have to decide on a matrix for the rules -
Narrative RPG, like Rogue Trader was and Inq wanted to be?
Maybe-a-little-too hyperdetailed, like 2nd ed or certain historicals?
Abstracted d6 Igo Ugo, like 3rd/ 4th ed?

Only then can one start massaging and aligning the cogs.
Would certain bits from Mordheim and Necromunda enhance?
Hmmm...what about alternating Unit activations by Initiative? Etc.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Assuming you'll want willing oppponents, just pick a Codex.
I'd recommend Daemon Hunter Squats for sheer weirdness.
A mix of Hellgun PDF, Doom Termis and Assassins.
Plus, =I= Ancestors with Retinues of Henchmen/ Gun Servitors.

It would tickle the old beards, and leave newbs flabbergasted.
Now, *that* is entertainment! :- D

40K is a wildly popular 'miniature gaming system' with people who have

I think that shooting and HTH work pretty much the way they are now.
In fact... I think 40K as it is now rules wise is pretty much as good
as we're going to get under the constrainsts of a D6 system. The only
things I would change in the fundamental &quot;how the game works&quot; is in a
few smaller instances.

1) bring back overwatch*
2) Give models a D6&quot; assault move out of transports. (not a return too
full fledged &quot;rhino rush&quot; but make it possible. again.)

* The other option here is to change the IGO/UGO system to something
else. I've played games with &quot;Alternating Activation&quot; (it's ok, but
favors large armies and encourages very VERY conservative play.) and
&quot;Activation by card draw&quot; where each unit is written on or represented
by a card and the cards are shuffled together and flipped over one at
a time, that unit doing it's full turn then. (cumbersome in big games)
There really is no perfect turn sequence though... if I did change
anything it would be to &quot;Activation by card draw&quot; to keep things mixed
up and less predictable.

The BIG changes I would make are all in the army lists, wargear,
weapons and such.

I do think there is plenty of room in 40K for Narrative RPG play (Kill
Team and Necromunda come immediately to mind.) but Narrative Scenarios
would be very difficult in games in excess of 1K points IMO.

And Narrative fails in any competitve environment... (example: all of
those funky mission objectives at RTTs.)

Suddenly? No. But conservatively, 86% of play would be gone within one
year.
It will have been replaced with more dynamic pastimes in a similar
niche.
IOW, the kiddies will all have taken their short attention spans
elsewhere.

The other 14% of us (beards) might remain coherent via enthusiast web
'support'.
But, with no miniature releases and few updates, these would soon
stagnate.
Then, diehards receding into informal neighborhood clubs would slowly
disband.

Attrition across another 2yrs will cause that 14% to dwindle to 1.4%
or lower.
Globally, we'd likely be represented by *pairs* of players, not
thousands.
With no resources to sustain it, a species will die out in a
generation.

Too much work? I don't see how that follows, but it's immaterial.
And, at a guess, for 99.44% of 40k players, miniatures aren't our

I'm not intimidated by work, either, but I already have quite enough
of that.

And I don't relish the prospect that my 40k gaming may *become* work.

I found out yesterday that someone scooped me on the 30k thing:

http://belloflostsouls.blogspot.com/2007/07/warhammer-30000-heresy-er...

+++

Also, here's what Andy Hoare had to say on the subject of 40k rules:

Andy Hoare on Games Development Tasks
- from Sub Rosa

Q: What's the story behind developing a codex/army book? Is it more
like collective brainstorm or lone wolf's work? How do Studio members
get assigned to particular tasks?

Andy: It's a complex process, and it starts with long-term strategy.
Contrary to popular belief, the developers don't decide what's being
released next - it's decided according to the needs of the business,
the systems and the resources available. We generally hear that a book
is coming up about two years out, and take part in the early stages of
the longest part of the process, which is the planning of the
plastics. The actual writing time is around three months, with a whole
load of playtesting, re-writing, editing and text going up and down
the chain and being seen by a lot of people whose opinions really
count. We spend most of our time planning, whether its taking part in
project, art, graphics, layout, miniatures meetings and a whole lot
more.

Q: How do you calculate point costs? Is there any mathematical
formula?

Andy: There are too many variables in a system as open and potentially
complex as 40k for any formula to stand up to much scrutiny. Far
better is to assign the value that feels right and playtest it in as
many different situations against as many different armies as
possible, and to keep refining it that way.

Q: What is your opinion on tournament style of play and so called
&quot;comp scores&quot;?

Andy: It's not the style of play I personally favour, but it's a very
important part of the hobby. If the organisers feel they need comp
scores to cater to the particular tastes of their players, then that's
their prerogative.

Que?  In my local gaming group here in the middle of nowhere we have six
adult wargamers.  And FOUR completely stocked and dedicated wargaming rooms
with stand-alone tables, terrain racks and enough floorspace in each room to
host a minium of six people.  With most gaming rooms being able to host
eight or ten people.  And everyone of my customers, without exception, has
his own dedicated gaming room - whether it is a basement, a garage or
seperate room in his house.

&lt;shrug&gt;

I've been in the miniature hobby since 1979.  And making my sole living of
the miniature hobby since 1994.  And I have played in a game store exactly
ONE time in my entire gaming 'career'.   Yet I am used to playing at least
once a month and would prefer to play twice a month.  Which isn't always
possible for adult wargamers.

86% - not 85%, 90% or 99%?

LOL!

Perhaps the SALES will be gone, but not the gameplay!  Let me give you an
example.  In 1988 GDW produced a victorian-era scifi role-playing and
miniatures game called space 1889.  It was moderately popular and I even
scratchbuilt a bunch of sky-galleons and gunboats for the game.  But it was
cancelled by GDW due to disappointing sales.

Yet - better than fifteen years since the game disappeared from the GDW
catalog and the company since went-out of business... there are now MORE sky
galleons of Mars miniatures available for purchase than were ever produced
by GDW during the game's heyday.  New models are being produced to meet the
demand of collectors of a 'dead' game system.  And the rules for miniature
wargaming have gone into a second printing.

ROTFL!

Like I said, what a crock of shit.  I've know the same bunch of wargamers
for thirty years - men who introduced me to the hobby when I was 18 years
old.  And EVERYONE of them is still going strong.  NOBODY has quit.  Nobody
has disbanded and sold of their collections.  They continue to buy, to
expand their collections of painted miniatures and to play games.  With
their sons and daughters and their son's and daughter's sons and daughters.

And this is in a little town in the middle of nowhere with a population of
under 60,000.  And when I lived in Portland, OR for sixteen years, it
sometimes felt like I couldn't swing a dead cat without hitting a wargamer.
And that was BEFORE I started to collect Games Workshop stuff.

You're just pulling these numbers out of your ass.  14%.  1.4%.  What a
bunch of nonsense.

Classic Battletech survived the demise of  FASA.  Command Decision and Space
1889 survived the demise of GDW.  Who are you to say that the much more
numerous and enthusastic inherants of the GW universes won't be equally
resourceful and dedicated?

If (and when) GW goes out of business - a thousand flowers will bloom upon
the dead carcass that once was the 'Games Workshop Hobby'.  The 40k ruleset
will be open to ANYONE who wishes to use it - manufacturer of miniatures be
damned.  So far as I'm concerned, the very best thing that could happen
would be the GW universe released from the dead-hand of the current
corporate management.

old Favorite SPI's &quot;War of The Ring&quot; (Yeah Tolkien) or 'Starship
Troopers, etc.  Though admittedly the Tolkien game takes an entire
weekend or longer to play the full advanced game.

&gt; &gt;&gt; 40K is a wildly popular 'miniature gaming system' with people who have
&gt; &gt;&gt; collected miniatures by the pound.  I doubt that it will ever disappear -

&gt; &gt; I didn't mean to imply that the *figs* would vanish overnight.
&gt; &gt; But, within a week, most interest in playing would certainly end.

&gt; Que?  Why EXACTLY is 40k popular if it wasn't for the figures and the
&gt; gameplay?

&gt; &gt; AFAICT, the overwhelming majority of 40k gaming occurs in stores.
&gt; &gt; Without store support, regular, weekly *gaming* would inevitably
&gt; &gt; cease.

&gt; Que?  In my local gaming group here in the middle of nowhere we have six
&gt; adult wargamers.  And FOUR completely stocked and dedicated wargaming rooms
&gt; with stand-alone tables, terrain racks and enough floorspace in each room to
&gt; host a minium of six people.  With most gaming rooms being able to host
&gt; eight or ten people.  And everyone of my customers, without exception, has
&gt; his own dedicated gaming room - whether it is a basement, a garage or
&gt; seperate room in his house.

&gt; &lt;shrug&gt;

&gt; I've been in the miniature hobby since 1979.  And making my sole living of
&gt; the miniature hobby since 1994.  And I have played in a game store exactly
&gt; ONE time in my entire gaming 'career'.   Yet I am used to playing at least
&gt; once a month and would prefer to play twice a month.  Which isn't always
&gt; possible for adult wargamers.

&gt; I think you over-value the impact of stores in keeping miniature wargaming -
&gt; scifi, fantasy, or historical - alive.  Greatly overvalue it.
">

I'd have to strongly agree.  Almost everyone I know that does any
sort of 'serious' miniatures gaming has their own dedicated space and
does most of their gaming outside of a shop / store environment.   If
need be - I can set up two additional 4 x 8 foot tables to go with my
dedicated 5 x 6.5 foot table.  And I too try to get in at least 1 game a
month, hopefully 2, but there are times when I simply can't due to other
'real life' demands.  There were 2 FLGS - one 30 minutes away, the other
about 45 minutes from where I live.  Unfortunately for me, the one with
the more mature / adult crowd closed down.  That store I gamed in
several times, but because of travel time and outside demands, I simply
couldn't game there very often.  (There are rumors that it may re-open
under new ownership.  I can only hope.)  The remaining store has little
appeal as it's even farther away, and on the occasions I've been there -
it's had a significant 'Munchkin Horde' which didn't much appeal to me.
With a limited gaming time budget, I want to know that I'm going to get
some enjoyment out of my game time - and it's often a crap-shot when it
comes to dealing with the Munchkins.

&gt; &gt;&gt; I can't
&gt; &gt;&gt; imagine the game system or the miniatures or the mega-verse GW created
&gt; &gt;&gt; will
&gt; &gt;&gt; suddenly vanish from the gaming scene

&gt; &gt; Suddenly? No. But conservatively, 86% of play would be gone within one
&gt; &gt; year.

&gt; 86% - not 85%, 90% or 99%?

&gt; LOL!

&gt; Perhaps the SALES will be gone, but not the gameplay!  Let me give you an
&gt; example.  In 1988 GDW produced a victorian-era scifi role-playing and
&gt; miniatures game called space 1889.  It was moderately popular and I even
&gt; scratchbuilt a bunch of sky-galleons and gunboats for the game.  But it was
&gt; cancelled by GDW due to disappointing sales.

&gt; Yet - better than fifteen years since the game disappeared from the GDW
&gt; catalog and the company since went-out of business... there are now MORE sky
&gt; galleons of Mars miniatures available for purchase than were ever produced
&gt; by GDW during the game's heyday.  New models are being produced to meet the
&gt; demand of collectors of a 'dead' game system.  And the rules for miniature
&gt; wargaming have gone into a second printing.

Same here - this is the number one reason why store play often
disinterests me.  Gaming with folks who have a reasonable grasp of the
rules, brought an army list and a rule book, and are generally looking
for the fun of 'playing' as opposed to solely looking for 'the win', and
who can win or lose a game with equal good grace is what I look for in a
gaming partner.   While there are some very mature young gamers - I'm
not that interested in spending my limited gaming time sorting out the
mature from the not so mature young players.

&gt; &gt; The other 14% of us (beards) might remain coherent via enthusiast web

&gt; &gt; But, with no miniature releases and few updates, these would soon
&gt; &gt; stagnate.
&gt; &gt; Then, diehards receding into informal neighborhood clubs would slowly
&gt; &gt; disband.

&gt; ROTFL!

&gt; Like I said, what a crock of shit.  I've know the same bunch of wargamers
&gt; for thirty years - men who introduced me to the hobby when I was 18 years
&gt; old.  And EVERYONE of them is still going strong.  NOBODY has quit.  Nobody
&gt; has disbanded and sold of their collections.  They continue to buy, to
&gt; expand their collections of painted miniatures and to play games.  With
&gt; their sons and daughters and their son's and daughter's sons and daughters.
">

I find his 'it'll vanish overnight' attitude kind of odd too.
Hell, look at GW specialist games as an example.  GW's 'Epic 40K'
tanked.  It literally sucked so badly that it pretty much killed the
local 'Epic' scale group as the local shop owner (long since out of
business) wanted folks to play the new version in the store.  And from
what I can tell, it largely killed off the Epic scene in most places.
But diehards like the guys at Net.Epic kept tweaking the older rules
that were far superior and kept Epic gaming alive.  I think folks who
like Epic Armageddon owe a large debt of thanks to the folks at Net.Epic
who proved to GW that Epic scale was and is very viable - it just needed
something by way of a rules set that didn't suck rocks.

No shit!  After all, if we can survive GW's bungling over the
years, what can't we survive?  It's not as if GW is *REALLY* the only
source of models and minis suitable for 40K gaming.  It's GW's line of
BS and only works to a limited degree for their tournaments.  When it
comes to friendly gaming the 'only GW minis' crap falls on its ass.
There are more than a few alternative sources of excellent minis.  The
fact that there are any 'bargains' as far as GW minis goes is a fair

&gt; continued to allow Gav to butcher the backstory with his unimaginative
&gt; and ham-fisted attempts at 'story advancement' and GW wonders why
&gt; players leave in disgust?

&gt;         I would love nothing more than to see GW hire some highly skillful
&gt; writers to 1 - gather up and catalog all the old backstory fluff so that
&gt; someone somewhere in GW has detailed knowledge of what's been written
&gt; over the years, 2 - weave together a solid overall backstory from all
&gt; the past fluff (I.e. decide which, if any, of the contradictory fluff
&gt; was 'historically accurate' where items disagree about the backstory),
&gt; and 3 - actually manage to move the 40K storyline 'forward' without
&gt; abruptly 'magically deleting' the parts of the backstory which they find
&gt; inconvenient.  I can live with some 'public historical inaccuracies' -
&gt; our own history is full of myths and legends.  But when the story
&gt; tellers can't even keep their own fictional story straight - that's a
&gt; problem in my book.

&gt; It amazes me to see that GW has so little comprehension of the fact that
&gt; it's not just the minis that sell 40K (and certainly not the rules set)
&gt; but the appeal of their 'backstory'.  One would think after their years
&gt; of experience with negative reactions when they suddenly and ineptly
&gt; 'reinvent' the story line that they'd have realized what a valuable
&gt; commodity the backstory itself is.  Instead they continue to allow folks
&gt; with no imagination or skill to have a free hand in remodeling it - with
&gt; about as much skill and subtlety as a bull in a china shop.

&gt;         Up until the Eldar codex (and now Chaos codex), I thought GW had
&gt; done a nice job of refining the process of rules balance and fun.  Ah
&gt; well, no good thing lasts forever.  But it would have been nice to see
&gt; GW make it a little farther into a new Edition of 40K before letting the
&gt; monkeys loose with their wrenches.

them up in his basement.  I just finished 24 egyptian cavalrymen and they

&gt; Thats how we do it. &lt;1000 tend to be more story driven. campaign or

&gt; More than 1000 are more likely to be just big battles for the sake of

true. i'm looking at doing something that will tie smaller games in
with bigger battles. It will keep alot of the &quot;stranger/fiddly&quot; stuff
in smaller battles that we can focues on characters but in a way that
isn't essentially &quot;Herohammer&quot;...

Getting a few Rhinos for the Tzeentch marines from Ebay proceeds.
Those should be in friday. After I finish those marines and the
Rhinos. I'm gonna try and throw some Slaanesh Marines together (need
some more sonic guns and to figure out just how the hell i'm gonna
build those things) and get some rhinos for them (maybe 2 squads...
possibly 3) then I'll slap out some more Black Legion guys and some

Clearly, our PoV are based on greatly different experiences.
Local game scenes seem to us a microcosm of the gaming world.
Perhaps your scene has a higher proportion of grognards to newbs?
But, your description makes the locale seem a bit . . . pastoral.

The Y2k census pegged the population of Metro Detroit at @5.4
million.
Economic interest in The Hobby is enough to support -three- GW
stores.
Local GW stores - in my direct personal experience - are virtual
nurseries.

Weekdays, they're packed with shrieking under-sixteen 'wargamers'.
Busy moms drop them off, then pick them up after a few hours of
shopping.
During my  visits, I'm often the only non-employee adult in the
store.

So, what becomes of all those giddy kiddies if GW stumbles into a tar
pit?
Busy moms wouldn't be affected, they'd simply drop the kids
elsewhere.
Obviously, they could no longer be in the Wargamer Daycare Program.

I believe my group is a more representative cross-section of GW
gamers.
But 86% of that group would evaporate in a year if GW stores closed
down.
(A figure at which I arrived after an informal poll of Rider's hobby
clerks.)

Why? Mostly because, imo, GW's target demographic has no income.
And, if their teeshirts are any indication, their other interests
include:

* gangsta rap &quot;music&quot;, and
* bad anime

I hate to think of a child letting either of those take the place of
40k.
But without GW's stores and aggressive marketing, that's all too
likely.

It is ... pastoral.  Quite literally and figueratively.  In Montana the
saying is there are more cattle than people.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Local GW stores - in my direct personal experience - are virtual

">

&lt;snip Playa's description of a vast, wargaming wasteland&gt;

I... don't... get... it.  At... all.

Maybe it's because I'm an adult.  And have been one for a long, long time.
So don't associate with children UNLESS their parental unit is associated
with me.  I don't do babysitting.  And at wargaming conventions when a
parent  trys to dump his pre-teen kid on me and my game so the parent can go
off and play in another game, that parent will get an earful.  From me.  And
he either stays and applies guidance to his pre-teen child or takes his
child with him.

&lt;shrug&gt;

And I like children.  But I don't think it's appropiate for anyone to
introduce children to wargaming without their parent's particpation and
co-operation.  So I won't.

But I still don't understand how the death of GW and the abandoment of all
these feral children you have described  in Detroit effects me in the
praries of Montana?  Are they going to break into my house in the middle of
the night so they can invade my gameroom?  Are they going to hold me at
knifepoint and make me play 40k with them?   Are they going to polute MY
inner sanctum with their gangsta rap and their anime and their &lt;gasp&gt; dull
grey hordes of unpainted miniatures?  Are they going to touch my dice?  And
most importantly, Are they going to drink all my beer?

I have NO experience facing these creatures you describe, so seek your
knowledge and guidance. Playa, please tell me... Do I need to buy MORE
ammunition RIGHT NOW?  And should it be bird shot, buckshot or hollow-point?

&lt;grin&gt;

Here's my real perspective.  When I bought my first boardgame, I was in
junior high school.  It was 1973 and the game was Avalon Hill's Luftwaffe.
And I didn't know ANY other gamers because that term had yet to be invented.
We were just teenagers in the basement, ignoring our parent's demands that
we go outside.  There were NO video games, no role-playing games, no
computer games and no miniature games that I had ever heard of.  And playing
board games was something that was considered vaguely aberant and juvenile -
something that our parent's figured we'd 'grow-out of'.

Here's two stories from today.

I lived in a four plex apartment in Portland, OR for nine years.  When I
first moved-in there was a young woman and her four or five year old son
living across the hall from me.  I befriended them - mostly because I'm a
very nice guy and not just because the mom was young, very sweet and very,
very hot.  After Xmas, her son knocked on my door to show me his toys - he
had a plastic fort and a 'real' catapult and some action figures.  So I
showed him and his Mom MY toys - boxes of 'em.  Julie gasped., said 'wait...
wait... wait' and ran back into her apartment.  And returned with a
photo-album that showed her two older brothers and their best friend (now
two cops and an investment banker) playing Fantasy battle, sea of blood and
Age of empires(?) in their basement.  I later met the two brothers and the
best friend and did work for all three of them.

Fast-forward a few years.  Same four-plex apartment and a young couple (he's
21 and she's 20) from California are moving-in downstairs.  Me, being my
usual helpful self, go downstairs, introduce myself.  I haul boxes and
provide beer to Jeremy and Tara.  One of the boxes I haul out of the Uhaul
is labeled 'Magik' and I causually ask Jer if he plays 'Magik' and his eyes
get wide.

&quot;Do... do you know Magik.'  I just nod.  And haul boxes.

Then my neighbor across the hall - Dan in his black 'Illuminati' t-shirt -
arrives from his shift at Geo-Hex (the now-defunct wargaming terrain
company).  I introduce Dan to our new neighbors and Jeremy is goggle-eyed.
He turns to the two of us and in a tone of utter disbelief asks us &quot;Are you
gamers?&quot;  We both nod and grin and he yells to his wife &quot;Tara!  They ARE
gamers.  We moved into an Apartment full of gamers!&quot;  And his shocked young
bride just rolled her eyes and backed-away.  Slowly.

My point is that gaming of ALL sorts - card games, miniatures, roleplaying,
video games, computer games and boardgames - is now mainstream.  It's not
considered childish or aberant any more.  And when these feral children you
describe grow-up to adult status, they will still have the gaming bug.  And
it is up to you to fully and completely exploit that weakness to your own
advantage.  I do it.  Routinely enough to make a living at it.

So chill.  Relax.  This ain't my first 'Wargaming is dead and life as we
know it is over!' scare.  Been there and done that.  And looted the
belongings to build my collection on the bones of those who did panic.

Let's recap, then.

You said,
&quot;If GW went bankrupt, what version of 40k would you play?&quot;
I replied,
&quot;The latest version, but it wouldn't last without support.&quot;
Then you went off on The Ballad of Six Hicks in the Sticks.

The rules we use today would be gone in three unsupported years, imo.
The only reason they're accepted now is the prestige of sponsored
events.
And, possibly, the appeal of getting in a quick pickup game virtually
anywhere.

Once those conditions cease, so do reasons *not* to change the rules.

While this is true, I think outside of tournament players, the effects
the death of a rules system can have can be fairly limited to small
groups of players.  Pick up games against random opponents will pretty
much disappear, but within regular gaming groups any system can survive
- we still play 1st ed Warzone from time to time, and no game suffered
at the hands of poor management than that.  With 40K's image as
virtually &quot;the&quot; sci-fi ruleset it would probably hang on better than
others even without support from a company in the form of new releases
and continuous product availability, but it would be interesting to see
what could step up and fill that gap.

True, that's why I generously allowed a 3yr shelf-life for the
existing rules.
Some version of 40k will exist as long as there are players. 40kv4?
Not so much.

Once regular players' numbers dwindle to a tenth, v4 won't be self-
supporting.

I agree with Blackheart that they're actually on the right track with

Its level of abstraction is about perfect for a 'quick' yet
substantial game.
Certain Psychology and Codex Special Rules, are another matter . . .

Well, I've blocked all messages coming from any gmail accounts, so as well
as all the assorted and sundry random trolls,  I miss all of Kurt's messages

&lt;shrug&gt;

Far as pick-up games with strangers - IF you have your 'house rules' basic
and printed-out, I've found with most historical rule sets (DBM, Napoleon's
Battles, Command Decision) you can explain what you've modified to all most
anyone already familar with the basic rulesets pretty easily.  And if the
person objects, you just roll-back to the original.  In my experience, most
people are pretty free to experimentation so long as nothing (ie, a
tournament) is on the line.  But it's mostly-up to the person making the
house rules to be clear and concise.

It's the odd fixiation on official rules that because of tournaments outside
a person's immediate vicinity exist, one must remain in compliance with the
'official' dogma or risk ex-communication - just like the Catholic church.

LOL! Much as I like your simile, it's flawed -
Game rules aren't ethical distinctions. There's no 'faith' in d6
probability.
(But, if you lie or cheat at 40k you'll surely end in a lake of
flames!)

Besides, 40k has only 4 Commandments:
Thou shalt Move
Thou shalt Shoot
Thou shalt do Combat
Thou shalt chill whilst thine enemy reciprocates

The devil, so to speak, is in the details -
Whom do I Move? Shoot? Assault? How? When?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I'd say the RGMW would have it done in six weeks

True enough for a set of RGMW-approved rules amendments.
But I was speaking of a ruleset that might be *globally* acceptable.
Everywhere players remembered 40k, this set would be understood.
Even, dare I say, generally approved as intuitively fair and
balanced. ;- )

Realistically, there'd probably be a 3-tier template:
1. A BfM/Newbie-style Move, Shoot, CC ruleset as a basis for
agreement.
The easiest bit, this would address all of the procedural details
described above.
2. Then, houseruling to square-up Codices with Psychology and
Apocalypse support.
This would be the tricky bit, but necessary if you want to rock a
rhyme. And you do.
3. A DeBellis/ Inquisitor/ Mordheim/ Combat Sim subset for the
Skirmish-level crowd.
This might depend on regional conventions, but good donor sets are
already out there.

The problem is, it's a job that requires a lot of hard work and broad-
mindedness.
Otherwise, GW would have done it already . . .

No it's not.  Your understanding is flawed.

Catholic is from the greek 'katholikos' meaning universal or comprehensive.
The actual title of the Roman church is the Universal and apostolic church -
'catholic' is the reference to it's being the one true christian faith
(according to it's adherents).  And GW has managed to create a 'catholic'
ruleset where you either adhere to the tenents of the ruleset or your
don't - but you DO NOT EVER CHANGE THEM to suit yourself.  Even bad, stupid,
block-headed, unplayable rules must be endured - you must play the rules AS
WRITTEN until the authorities on-high deem to change them.  And then charge
you another 20$ for the same wine in slightly shiner new bottles.

&gt; Game rules aren't ethical distinctions. There's no 'faith' in d6

&gt; flames!)

I don't confuse ethics with religion.  Morality certainly takes it's cues
from religious dogma - ethics, not so much.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; I'd say the RGMW would have it done in six weeks

&gt; True enough for a set of RGMW-approved rules amendments.
&gt; But I was speaking of a ruleset that might be *globally* acceptable.
&gt; Everywhere players remembered 40k, this set would be understood.
&gt; Even, dare I say, generally approved as intuitively fair and
&gt; balanced. ;- )

&lt;shrug&gt;

Once more, this is the GW 'catholic' mindset in a nutshell.  And I don't get
it.

Oh, dear. Aren't you the one repeating the &quot;I don't get it&quot; mantra?
Precepts which permit no enlightenment are demonstrably wrong.

Take a moment.

You'd like to use a religious analogy for consumerism? Okay.

Ah! It seems you fail to distinguish between Church and State.
When in Rome, one must render unto Kirby.

Perhaps if you took your religious analogy just a little further?
Say GW, the LLC part, is the seat of Ecclesiarchy for The Hobby.

The fluff, then, is gospel. The BRB, a missal.
Redshirts, priests. TOs, bishops.
The hobby stores, missions. Battle Bunkers, temples.

Priestly *is* God!

;- )

Now, that in mind, look at some realities closer to home:

Church is an intricate yet stylised weekend social ritual.
Often, bread is eaten and wine is drunk.

40k is an intricate yet stylised weekend social ritual.
Often, pretzels are eaten and beer is drunk.

Get it?

Nope.  I don't get it.

I've been a historical miniature gamer for almost thirty years.  And only
built my first 40k army for the third edition of the rules.  I collected all
the rogue trader references and 2nd &amp; 3rd edition codexs simply to have
available as painting guides for the painting bizness.  But studiously
avoided getting involved with the actual game simply because of the
cult-like behavior on the part of it's most devoted adherents.  And even now
I stand-back, off to one-side and wonder at what goes-on in the 'Games
Workshop Hobby'.  And even though I make a lot of money off it and have a
shitload of models I've collected over the years, I simply cannot understand
it's popularity, it's appeal and it's adherent's devotion to it's 'dogma'.

&lt;shrug&gt;

If your only experience with 'miniature gaming' is through the Games
Workshop Hobby, you can't understand just how clueless I feel sometimes.  I
got into miniature gaming and discovered I could have an impact on how the
games were actually played.  My opinion on how things should happen or DID
happen were valued.  I had the ability to make the game fit my research and
my ideas - good or bad.

But not the Games Workshop Hobby.  You are dictated too by a far-away
authority and the local adherents INSURE your compliance or you will not be
allowed to attend their ritual gatherings.  You give your money for
soon-to-be worthless ritual items because the far-away authorities have
changed their dogma again.  What was once true is now false and what was
once useful is now useless.  And more money is required to become once more
in compliance with the ritual's requirments.

&lt;grin&gt;

I just paint the models anymore.  I don't play much simply because I got
tired of the nonsense.  The bad rules, the lack-of-playtesting, the lack of
internal balance, the inflexiability.  Which is one of the reasons I'd
rollback to third edition of the Games Workshop Hobby folded.  It would at
least be a set of internally consistant, totally-finished set of sci-fi
rules.  I could put all the 3rd edition rules, all the 3rd edition codexs
and all the errata on a CD and give it to anyone who was interested in
getting into the game I was interested in playing.  But until GW folds it's
tent, I won't bother with it.
