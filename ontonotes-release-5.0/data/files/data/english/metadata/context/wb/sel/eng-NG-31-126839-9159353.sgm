Kind of a surprise, for me anyway.

http://www.freebizmag.com/emailamercheer01welcome.htm

I get a mail every 2-3 days from them (freebizmag).

My sis turned me on to the freebiz place. I'm getting several free mags
through them. I gave them a web address to segregate any spam. Only one
*Investors* piece of regular spew so far.

I've filled a couple of obnoxious 3-4 page *info* pages, but now just
plonk through, answering almost anything.

(whatever) YMMV. I'm getting PC World, FlYing, eWeek - an IT biz type
mag, and MotorAge. Â All for only a few months, except for PC World,
they re-upped that for another short term.

I'm guessing owning my own business, Cheerleading? I don't know.
