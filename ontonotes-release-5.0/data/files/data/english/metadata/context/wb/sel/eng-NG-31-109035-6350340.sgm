It varies... some servers filter tighter than others. The stuff
that gets through seems to be the messages that are more like

Sometimes not other times more, YMMV depending upon which server you

I'm reading an awesome book right now: "Spam Kings" by Brian
McWilliams. It's all about the seedy world of American spam. It's
mostly a descriptive narrative, but it has some neat tips on beating
and hunting down spammers.

Maybe we should kick some of these names over to "news.admin.net-

His cancer has been an anomaly, it does not fit into the textbooks. Up
until hospice it has not been good, the diagnose of the type of cancer
was indeterminate, the treatment options limited. Just scary if your
illness does not fit into the textbooks. Final determination that it
was a squamas(sp?) cell type of cancer brought home that the first
treatment and surgery were not the best options at the time.

Very sorry to hear of your BIL's crossing.

The correct spelling (though not important) is squamous. It is one of
the layers of skin (dermis) and a type of skin cell (simple squamous,
specialized sqamous ((epithelium / mucous membranes)) et al). I point
it out in case you wanted to look it up at any point.

Again, my condolences.

My brother recently died from a massive heart attack at 41 years

So if the email host and the site host get complaints they will bounce
the offender. Does not mean that they will not resurface with new
accounts elsewhere though.

So that is where I concentrate on, ping the site name get there host
abuse email post it, I use Karen's Whois to resolve the IP addresses
from both the ping and email host information usually available in
headers on most newsreaders.

(recent ding went off in my head about a ping thing)

I cut and paste from a txt file to the response and label it antispam.
Even if you do not see it on your server if you feel a complaint is in
order send one please.

I do not chase after trolls, why play the game?

Markem,

After I posted that, I thought you might read it in a way I didn't intend.

I applaud your efforts, chastise myself for not doing the same when you
miss it (I think I've done it twice in the entire time I've posted here)
and support the intent as well as those who do send the actual
complaints (which I should do more.)

It's just, it's after-the-fact, and that is what I was responding to:
it doesn't get rid of the spam when the spam level rises as it will
sometimes.

And, as noted, posting to a group that is intended for those who run
news servers ("admins") without becoming *very* knowledgeable, is not a
good idea;  those folks find it a bit annoying if usenet newcomers
decide to become pro-active by posting to their group.  The purpose of
that group, fundamentally, is for admins to notify each other of
confirmed spam that slips past Cleanfeed;  if the admin doesn't care
enough to run Cleanfeed in the first place, they likely won't do
anything about something posted to that group.

As Stephanie (or was that Ty?) notes, posting to "sightings" is better
for those who are not admins, checking first to be sure that someone
hasn't already posted it.

But the bottom line for someone who sees too much spam is to get on a
server that is pro-active about it;  if you're seeing that much, it
means your admin doesn't do something to get rid of it, because most
people don't see that much of it.

And that's what I was trying to suggest to the OP as the only solution
that will really make a difference in what one sees.

I agree, but back in the day when a 9 foot tall fire breathing dragon
prowled our midst, SSB spam was generally not a problem. If you
spammed here it cost you money and aggravation because your site was
no longer hosted, your T1 line was a dead hunk of scrap copper.

I am not trying for that level actually, just a leave SSB alone sign
for the porn sites and such.

Porn spam is a money making business, if it cost them money to post
ads here it will stop.

No no no! A lot of us use .sightings to track spammers. It's often
difficult to figure out from one report that they're Really Bad or just
A Small Problem. More reports is better!

&gt; But the bottom line for someone who sees too much spam is to get on a
&gt; server that is pro-active about it;  if you're seeing that much, it
&gt; means your admin doesn't do something to get rid of it, because most
&gt; people don't see that much of it.

Yeah. Being a SNews customer I see very little spam on the newsgroups.

Back when SSBB was originally created there was no such thing as Cleanfeed.
Optimists predicted it would be six months before SSBB was drowned in spam;
pessimists gave us three weeks.

The 9 foot tall fire breathing dragon and the other spam fighters kept SSBB
largely spamfree and usable via their own efforts for years. On at least one
occasion, the dragon made a telephone call to the office of a spammer and
overheard a snippet of conversation along the lines of "you posted to
SSBB??!!! What are you, crazy? Those people;e will get us shut down!!!
Apologize right now and promise it won't be a problem again!!!"

Complaining about spam lets the spammers know that it has not yet become
acceptable. It may be a fight in vain but it is a good fight and one I am
proud to take part in nonetheless. After all, lost causes generate some of
the best literature. &lt;G&gt;

OK, apologies, I got that wrong.

Thanks for clarifying.

I don't think it's a "fight in vain".  I think that the people who
fought commercial spam all along the way have a lot to do with the
development of tools like Cleanfeed or even the BI.

The more outspoken (but RATIONAL) people are about it, the more likely
that businesses will pay attention and offer the option of "clean"
servers to those who want it that way.

And just as I believe that people who want moderated newsgroups should
have the option of subscribing to such groups, I also believe that
people who care about a cleaner newsfeed should be able to get it.

That may have come out a little more aggressively than I intended. I
just spend a lot of time looking for evidence over in .sightings and
like more data :)
