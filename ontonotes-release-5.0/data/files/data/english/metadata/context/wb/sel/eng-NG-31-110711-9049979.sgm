I was just running the comparisons on the handhelds HP has on its site.
There seem to be two generations there. So here are a couple of questions
for the Win Mobile suers:

One thing all four models have in common is 64 MB SDRAM (seems like so
little when the iPhone has 8 GBytes, but of course Apple doesn't believe in
functionality software, so that machine is not under consideration). Is 64
MB enough, or would that be a restrictive amount for a power user? (I use 35
third-party apps on my T3, and if I were to convert to a Win Mobile device I
would want one that could support a similar group of applications).

These units have various amounts of user accessible ROM. What would I use
ROM as opposed to RAM for in a WinMobile machine? Would I keep my apps in
ROM and the changing data in RAM? Or is the ROM the equivalent of the hard
drive on my laptop, the place were everything is installed, while the RAM is
where it runs? How much ROM is enough? Would I want to go for the high end
ROM devices which are more expensive?

Two of these machines use &quot;Genuine Windows Mobile 5.0...&quot;, while the other
two promise &quot;Windows Mobile 6.0 Classic&quot; (it is very reassuring to know that
the WinMobile 5.0 isn't a pirate version. I am not sure exactly how a brand
new product is a &quot;Classic&quot; or what that means exactly). Is there a big
advantage to 6.0 over 5.0 that that should be a major factor in choosing a
new PDA, or is this just marketing fluff?

Three of the machines have processors at 624 MHz. One has a 520 MHz
processor. Again, is this difference significant? How much of a load would a
high-end third party app put on the processor?

So as a final question, if I were to buy one of these units and my limited
budget was not up to the $500 high end device, where should I make my
compromises? Should I go for the lower end Win 6 device with less ROM, for
instance, or would I be better off with more ROM but the older version of
Win Mobile?

With WM 5 &amp; 6 devices, 64 megs of RAM is plenty as that's primarily
program execution space. What matters is the amount of NVRAM (ROM) as
that is where all your applications will be stored, and the more
there the better. Anything less than 128 megs is not acceptable and
256 would be ideal if you're planning on using a lot of apps.

WM6 Classic is for PDAs, IIRC. Standard is for Smartphones. I'm not
really up on what the differences are between WM5 and WM6 - Jeff
probably has a better handle on that.

I doubt you'd notice any appreciable difference in the processor
speeds. Both my Loox and hx2415 run at 520 MHz and they're plenty
fast enough for me.

I would say go for the WM5 device with more ROM - I can't imagine
anything in WM6 that would justify going for a machine with less ROM
onboard. Remember, ROM is now where your programs are stored - like a
hard drive on a PC. You don't want to skimp there if you're planning
on loading a lot of stuff. BUT realise most programs aren't that big.
You can also store programs on SD or CF cards. But if I were buying
today, I'd look for a machine with a minimum of 128 megs of ROM storage.

Don,

Thanks. That explains a lot. I see that some of these models also support CF
as well as SD cards, which probably isn't that much of an advantage these
days. And they all have built-in WiFi and bluetooth, which I really want,
partly because I may try again with a GPS add-on some day. that's if I
decide to buy anything at all. The T3 still meets my needs fairly well.

BTW, per the discussion on Brighthand, it appears that the 210 does
indeed come with 128mb of sdram, not 64 per HP.
