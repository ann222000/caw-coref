Pelosi &amp; The Jellyfish

By Jon Faulkner
Created Mar 23 2007 - 5:54pm

That indomitable Christian and cult leader, with his Bible thumping hordes,
believes himself innocent of his inexcusable crimes. He thinks he's
fulfilled his destiny by overseeing the deaths of thousands of America's
kids, most between the ages of 18 and 22. This is a man who asked America's
sons and daughters to trust him, knowing he was betraying them. Eventually,
the young men and woman he sent to Iraq realized they'd placed their trust
in a man who is not trustworthy. A man who regarded their loyalty and their
lives as his entitlement.

But he's not satisfied with the innocent blood he's spilled, including that
of half a million Iraqis. Astonished Americans watch in horror as they
wonder who will stop him, even as he makes preparations to attack Iran.
Cheney, the ex vice-president of Halliburton, has become fantastically rich
from dead American soldiers, and advocates for more war. What kind of people
are these? How in the Hell did they come to power, and why are they still in
office?

Bush and Cheney are opportunists who saw a chance to make a great deal of
money for themselves and their friends. They are not spiritual people who
are inspired to make the U.S. a better place for its citizens, and for the
world's nations. They see the offices they hold as licenses to steal.
Americans thought that democrats would be the best chance to stop Bush from
doing further damage so they replaced republican majorities hoping that a
democratic congress would stop Bush. A significant majority of Americans
thought that if Bush were forced to defend himself for his traitorous
behavior he'd be too distracted to start a murderous rampage in Iran. But
democrats are again displaying their enormous capacity for cowardice. Bush
waves his nuclear six-gun around and the new speaker, Pelosi, makes her
first order of business an assurance to Bush that he won't be impeached.

In reciprocation, Bush makes it plain he doesn't care what the new,
democratic congress does; he'll do whatever he wants regardless. He's found
himself miraculously delivered to a position from which he can redeem
himself for all the humiliations he's endured in a lifetime of inadequacy
and impotency, and he's not going to back away now. As he says, "In a time
of war, the president must have the power he needs to make the tough
decisions, including, if need be, the decision to grant himself even more
power." If that doesn't make his idea of the balance of power plain enough,
there's this, "I'm the decider, and I decide what's best."

If the democrats can save just one, young soldier's life, they have a moral
obligation to do so. The democrats won congress with a clear mandate. Start
planning immediately on the safest, best way, to get our kids out of Iraq.
Instead, they blather importantly and knowledgably about taking the White
House and increasing their congressional majority in 2008. Why do they want
more power when they are so afraid of using the power they've got?

Pelosi is a female Tom Daschle, always willing to listen politely. Always
ready to concede or capitulate. In a give and take business she is always
giving, the republicans always taking. They correctly believe that if you
have power you should use it. Pelosi thinks it should be shared in the
spirit of bi-partisanship. She is benign and reasonable but is surrounded by
sharks who are not at all reasonable. The poor, old dear is essentially
helpless against an organized and determined, republican attack. Her
carefully measured, sing song speeches, are chosen to give the least offense
to republicans. She is naïve beyond belief and simply incapable of realizing
that her duty is to bring the troops home safely and expediently. She
fiddles, another kid is slaughtered in Iraq, and the DNC explains how best
to win in the next election cycle. She's pathetic.

She and her counterpart, senator majority leader Harry Reid, could not get
the minimum wage increased but happily it turns out the effort was only a
clever move so the democrats would have a major issue to use against
republicans in 2008. They explain their strategy for re-election, as if that
matters more than another dead American, son or daughter. Bush got his war
based on lies, while Pelosi is third in line to the presidency. Bush and
Cheney are the two most impeachable monsters ever to disgrace the United
States, and an election is coming which will decide whether or not Americans
are going to fall to corporate fascism.

This is no time for the weak. No time for pitter patter and make nice. It's
time to go for the jugular of the republican party while it's exposed and
backed against a wall. Pelosi and Reid behave as if their overseeing some
town-hall meeting to decide broadening the sidewalks. They pontificate while
American kids are dying in a fraudulent, contrived war. If they can't save
our kids from fighting and dying in such a war they are worthless to the
people who elected them. They should get out of the way and let someone lead
who knows how, or is at least, willing to learn.
