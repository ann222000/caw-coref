_NIST Admits Total Collapse Of Twin Towers  Unexplainable_
( http://www.prisonplanet.com/articles/october2007/161007_nist_admits.htm )

Implicitly acknowledges controlled  demolition only means by which towers
could have fallen at free fall  speed

The National Institute for Standards and  Technology has been forced to admit
that the total free-fall collapse of the  twin towers cannot be explained
after an exhaustive scientific study, implicitly  acknowledging that controlled
demolition is the only means by which the  buildings could have come down.
In a recent letter (_PDF  link_ ( http://www.911proof.com/NIST.pdf ) ) to 9/11
victim's family representatives Bill Doyle  and Bob McIlvaine, NIST states,
&quot;We are unable to provide a full explanation of  the total collapse.&quot;
A 10,000 page scientific study only offers  theories as to how the &quot;collapse
initiation&quot; proceeded and fails to address how  it was possible for part of a
WTC structure to fall through the path of most  resistance at freefall speed,
completely violating the accepted laws of  physics.

In addition,  NIST's own studies confirmed that virtually none of the steel
in either tower  reached temperatures hotter than 500 degrees. The point at
which steel weakens  is 1000 degrees and melting point is reached at 1,500
degrees, according to NIST  itself.

&quot;NIST'S 10,000-page report purports to explain what it calls  &quot;collapse
initiation&quot; -- the loss of several floors' vertical support,&quot; writes  Kevin Barrett
of Scholars for 9/11 Truth. &quot;In order to dream up this  preposterous
scenario, NIST had to ignore its own tests that showed that  virtually none of the
steel got hotter than 500 degrees f. It had to claim  that somehow the planes
took out many core columns, despite the fact that only  a direct hit by an engine
would have been likely to do so, and that the  chances of this happening even
once are fairly low. It had to preposterously  allege that the plane that
nicked the corner of the South Tower took out more  core columns than the one
that hit the North Tower almost dead center. It had  to tweak all the parameters
till they screamed bloody murder and say that the  steel was far weaker than
it actually was, the fire was far hotter than it  actually was, the sagging was
far greater than it actually was, and so on. And  so NIST hallucinated a
computer-generated fantasy scenario for &quot;collapse  initiation&quot;--the failure of a
few floors.&quot;
&quot;But how do you get from the failure of a few floors to total  collapse at
free-fall speed of the entire structure? The short answer: You  don't. Anyone
with the slightest grasp of the laws of physics understands that  even if all of
the vertical supports on a few floors somehow failed  catastrophically at
exactly the same moment--a virtually impossible event, but  one necessary to
explain why the Towers would come  straight down rather than toppling
sideways--the top part of the building  could not fall THROUGH the still-intact, highly
robust lower part of the  building, straight through the path of most
resistance, just as fast as it  would have fallen through thin air.&quot;
&quot;Thus total free-fall  collapse, even given NIST's ridiculous &quot;initiation&quot;
scenario, is utterly  impossible. The probability of it happening is exactly
equal to the  probability of the whole building suddenly falling upward and
landing on the  moon,&quot; concludes Barrett.

NIST have yet to properly address the sudden  freefall collapse of WTC
Building 7, which imploded on the late afternoon of  9/11 despite not being hit by a
jetliner.
In August 2006, _NIST promised to scientifically  evaluate_
( http://www.prisonplanet.com/articles/august2006/310806wtc7.htm )  whether explosive devices
could have  contributed to the 47-story building's collapse but no answers have
been  forthcoming.
In August of this year, James Quintiere, Ph.D.,  former Chief of the Fire
Science Division of the National Institute of Standards  and Technology, _called
for an independent inquiry into NIST's  investigation_
( http://www.prisonplanet.com/articles/august2007/210807_b_NIST.htm )  of the collapse of the twin
towers.
Quintiere said NIST's conclusions were  &quot;questionable&quot;, that they failed to
follow standard scientific procedures and  that their failure to address
Building 7 belied the fact that the investigation  was incomplete.

I definitely want the answers as to what happened on 9/11. I greatly respect what the architects and engineers are saying. However, it is dead wrong to talk about &quot;the plane that nicked the corner of the South Tower&quot;. Some nick.

I'm not missing the point here. I respect all the work people have done in investigating 9/11 nd I want the answers too. But I do not care for loose language like that. It doesn't help us figure out what really happened and more importantly, it doesn't help those of us who want the truth reach others who think we're all conspiracy tin foil hat nuts.

Thanks to everyone for bearing with me on this - that reference just bothered me a bit.
