SPIEGEL INTERVIEW WITH ISRAELI HISTORIAN SAUL FRIEDLÄNDER 'The Holocaust Won't
Disappear'

Israeli historian Saul Friedländer -- winner of the 2007 Peace Prize of the
German Book Trade to be presented this week at the Frankfurt Book Fair -- spoke
to SPIEGEL about the importance of victims' accounts in researching the
Holocaust and the failure of efforts in Germany to draw a line under the issue.

SPIEGEL: Professor Friedländer, in contrast to other accounts of the history of
the Holocaust, in your book &quot;Nazi Germany and the Jews, the Years of
Extermination,&quot; you give us ample opportunity to hear from the victims through
diaries and letters. Why didn't you limit your focus to the history of the
perpetrators?

Saul Friedländer: Because that's not enough. We basically still needed a book
that went beyond an analysis of German politics and included the environment --
in other words, the churches, the elites, the general population in Germany and
in other countries -- and incorporated the voices of the victims, of those who
were murdered.

SPIEGEL: Were you interested in the educational effect here, since the horror
becomes more vivid this way?

Friedländer: No, many aspects only become clear from an examination of the
victims' sources, not from official documents. For instance, the fact that the
Jews in Germany and Western Europe didn't know what was going on -- and in
Eastern Europe they didn't want to believe what they saw. Take my parents --
after their deportation from France in 1942, a friend wrote to my grandmother,
who lived in Stockholm, to say that my parents had been sent to Germany or to a
Jewish reservation in Poland.
He had no idea that they had been murdered.

SPIEGEL: Would it have changed anything if the victims had known what was going
on?

Friedländer: It does makes a considerable difference whether the Nazis murdered
millions of people who didn't know what was going to happen to them or killed
people who had already assumed the worst.

SPIEGEL: Because it explains why the extermination process went so smoothly?

Friedländer: Yes.

SPIEGEL: The opposite position was held by the recently deceased Holocaust
historian Raul Hilberg. &quot;The best way to grasp the reality of the situation,&quot; he
said, &quot;is to reconstruct events from the perspective of the perpetrators.&quot;

Friedländer: I have great respect for Hilberg. He was the classic expert on the
machinery of extermination. But he only worked with documents left by the
perpetrators and thought that the victims had gone to their deaths like lambs to
the slaughter. If you read between the lines, you can even sense the rage with
which he writes about the Jews' lack of resistance. But they simply didn't know
what was happening.

SPIEGEL: Are there other new things that we can learn from the victims'
accounts?

Friedländer: Only these accounts can attest to the behavior of the murderers.
Elsa Binder from Stanislavóv in Galicia, for example, wrote in her diary in 1941
about how &quot;Einsatzgruppen&quot; (paramilitary death squads operated by the SS)
murdered her friend Tamara and their friend Ester, who was known as Esterka: &quot;I
hope that death was kind to her and took her quickly. And that she didn't have
to suffer like ... Esterka who, as we saw, was strangled.&quot; Thus we see that the
Einsatzgruppen consisted of men who did more than aim rifles at seemingly
anonymous crowds of people. The strangling of a young girl actually reveals the
sadism of the perpetrators, about which we still know so little.

SPIEGEL: How was the diary recovered?

Friedländer: It was found in a ditch next to the road that leads to the cemetery
in Stanislavóv: The circumstances surrounding Elsa's death are not known. And we
can deduce something else from the victims'
perspective: in addition to Jewish councils and Jewish religious communities,
there were also families, circles of friends and individuals. The success of
their strategies to avoid deportation is -- from a statistical point of view --
perhaps insignificant, but it is a small chapter in the overall history of the
period. For instance, I'm only here today because my parents hid me in a
Catholic monastery school.

SPIEGEL: In other words, your emphasis on the victims' perspective stems from
your own experience?

Friedländer: Of course. That actually shouldn't be the case with historians, and
the former director of the Institute of Contemporary History in Munich, Martin
Broszat, even said in 1987 that Jews were incapable of writing a rational
historical history of the Third Reich because they were biased -- as if a former
member of the Hitler Youth or a party member like Broszat could conduct research
without any biographical baggage. That upset me a great deal back then, but I've
encountered this attitude time and again when the issue comes up with German
colleagues.

SPIEGEL: You've been researching the Holocaust for decades. Are you expecting
many more new discoveries to emerge from research?

Friedländer: There probably won't be any major changes to the big picture.

SPIEGEL: But aren't there considerable differences of opinion among historians
over the question of why the Holocaust occured?

Friedländer: You are alluding to what I call the &quot;new functionalism,&quot; in other
words, the position taken by my colleagues Ulrich Herbert, Götz Aly and
Christian Gerlach. They believe that, for logistical or populist reasons, the
Germans tended to pursue materialistic objectives and originally did not intend
to murder the Jews at all. These scholars maintain, for example, that the
population in Russia was killed, including Jews, because it was necessary to
feed the Wehrmacht, but they say that this was by no means the main goal.

SPIEGEL: What objections do you have to this?

Friedländer: For me the ideology of the Third Reich and Hitler is of far greater
importance. In the first known piece of writing from Adolf Hitler that deals
with a political issue, he warned of the danger that the Jews posed to the
German people. That was back in 1919. And his political testament from the
bunker in 1945 contains the message that the Germans should continue to fight
against the worldwide plague of Judaism. We can thus observe a continuity of
fanatical anti-Semitism.

SPIEGEL: Why didn't the Nazis kill the German Jews back in the 1930s?

Friedländer: I'm sure that Hitler did not pursue a plan to murder the Jews from
the very beginning. At first, the goal was rather to isolate them from society,
remove their means of economic livelihood, and force them to leave Germany.

SPIEGEL: And why did the Holocaust happen?

Friedländer: During the war, the Wehrmacht occupied areas in which millions of
Jews lived. The plan was to deport them, just as they had begun to do in
Germany, from areas under German control, and to send them to a Jewish
reservation. At first, this reservation was supposed to be in Lublin, then in
Madagascar, then, after defeating Stalin, in northern Russia.

SPIEGEL: But that's not what happened.

Friedländer: Yes, from October 1941, we can observe a transition. Hitler ranted
almost every day about the Jews. The offensive on the eastern front was bogged
down, and then on Dec. 5, the Red Army launched its counteroffensive. Stalin
hadn't been defeated -- he continued to fight.
And a few days later, the US was at war with Hitler's allies, the Japanese. And
since Hitler knew that US President Franklin D. Roosevelt was trying to convince
the American public to go to war against Germany, for psychological reasons he
wanted to beat him to the punch, and so he declared war on the US, although that
actually wasn't the original plan.
As a result, Hitler was fighting a total war on two fronts, just as he'd
experienced during World War I.

SPIEGEL: And the fate of the European Jews was sealed?

Friedländer: In 1935, Hitler said that if it came to another war on two fronts,
he would be prepared to take drastic measures against the Jews.
That was the lesson that Hitler learned from World War I. The country could not
afford another stab in the back from the supposed enemy at home, the Jews, who
had allegedly betrayed Germany back in 1917/18. In contrast to the Slavs, who
the Nazis saw as passive &quot;Untermenschen,&quot;
Hitler feared the Jews as an active enemy. Consequently, it was not enough to
kill the Jews -- he wanted to obliterate everything that was Jewish in the
world. I think the decision to do this was made in December 1941.

SPIEGEL: How do you then explain the fact that immediately following the attack
on the Soviet Union in June 1941, the Einsatzgruppen killed Jewish men at first,
but then also shot women and children by the hundreds of thousands. The absolute
determination to annihilate the Jews was thus clearly present at an earlier
date.

Friedländer: This is a case of cumulative radicalization, as my colleague Hans
Mommsen has called it in other contexts. This results from the notion of a total
war, like the one Hitler was fighting in Eastern Europe. It has its own dynamics
and the radicalization emerges on its own.

SPIEGEL: And this led to women and children being shot?

Friedländer: On the German side, there was the widespread mythic idea that the
Jews would help the Red Army. And then there were the beginnings, albeit very
modest, of a partisan war on the part of the Soviets. So the Germans saw women
as a potential threat, for example, as messengers. And they shot the children
because they weren't prepared to feed all the orphans. But that was not yet the
decision to annihilate all the Jews in Europe. The partisan war was also
directed against the Slavs. In their villages the Germans killed all the
inhabitants when a partisan had been discovered or there were suspicions of
partisan activity.

SPIEGEL: Some of your colleagues see Hitler as a dictator surrounded by henchmen
who were pushing for the Holocaust. What is your assessment of Hitler's role?

Friedländer: Without Hitler -- no Holocaust. But Hitler of course could never
have committed the crime alone. It was the population, it was the elite, some
200,000 perpetrators in Germany alone -- there was a willingness to go along
with it, also for very practical reasons, because individuals hoped to gain a
material advantage.

SPIEGEL: In that sense, you agree with your colleague Götz Aly when he says that
Hitler killed the Jews so he could distribute all their possessions to the
Germans?

Friedländer: Aly is exaggerating. Hitler definitely used the property and
belongings of those who were murdered to help keep people quiet, but that was
not the main objective.

SPIEGEL: You recently wrote: &quot;All murderous impulses and ideological delusions
evidently lie dormant in the nature of mankind.&quot; Do you see a danger that this
could happen again?

Friedländer: A few years ago, I gave a lecture at the University of Notre Dame
in Indiana. And someone in the auditorium asked a question that still bothers me
today: &quot;If something so extreme as the Holocaust was possible, don't we have to
revise our perception of the nature of mankind?&quot; I couldn't answer that
question. There's no doubt that an extreme political party with a violent
ideology can, given the right circumstances, commit horrible acts, as we have
seen to some extent in Rwanda and Cambodia. Nevertheless, I can hardly imagine
that a movement comparable to Nazism could be successful again in a modern
country.
Today, the counteracting forces that failed back then are too strong to allow
this to happen.

SPIEGEL: You've been closely following political developments in Germany over
the years. How will it feel to stand on Sunday where Peace Prize winner Martin
Walser stood in 1998 and complained about the &quot;endless exhibition of our shame&quot;
in the media?

Friedländer: The Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung recently speculated that I would
answer Walser, but I don't intend to do so because I honestly don't care what
Martin Walser thinks.

SPIEGEL: Walser represents many people who say that it's time to move on and
draw a line under the debate about the Holocaust.

Friedländer: I vaguely remember the debate over putting the matter to rest in
the late 1950s, and very clearly the debate in 1985, which again focused on
drawing a line under the issue. Every 20 years, there appears to be a wave of
sentiment, in other words, another generation grows up and calls for the matter
to be put behind us. But then just the opposite occurs. The debate in the
mid-1980s led to the &quot;Historikerstreit&quot; (an intellectual and political
controversy in West Germany over how the Holocaust should be interpreted). And
nowadays when people in Germany talk about the systematic bombing of cities and
the refugees and displaced people, then the Holocaust only seems to disappear,
but in actual fact they are approaching it from another angle. What we're
dealing with here is the Allies' response to the Holocaust, in other words, the
Germans were also victims. Dresden is compared with Auschwitz and not with
anything else.

SPIEGEL: The Germans can't get the Holocaust out of their system?

Friedländer: That's how it looks to me. But it's not just the Germans.
Take the spectacular success of a totally unknown author like Jonathan Littell
in France with his novel &quot;Les Bienveillantes&quot; about a fictitious SS officer who
is responsible for organizing the &quot;Final Solution.&quot; There is something about the
extreme nature of the Holocaust which is now firmly anchored in the West's
perception of the world -- and which is reflected in this novel. I can't explain
it exactly, but one thing is certain -- the issue of the Holocaust won't
disappear.

SPIEGEL: Does the current debate about German &quot;victims&quot; make you feel uneasy?

Friedländer: No. When I traveled to Bonn in the early 1960s to work in the
archives, I kept getting these horrible panic attacks. Today I feel the same way
in Germany as I do in any other country. I have a grandchild here and my
daughter is married to a German and lives in Berlin.

SPIEGEL: Then you presumably have not been overly concerned as you follow the
debate surrounding TV presenter , who praised the family policies of the Nazis?

Friedländer: I've read about it. Ms. Herman apparently doesn't know any better.

SPIEGEL: And Cardinal Joachim Meisner who spoke of ?

Friedländer: I've also read about that and thought that the man is
narrow-minded. You probably take these things more seriously than I do because
they are happening in your country. I understand that very well.
But I'm more upset about US politics.

SPIEGEL: Next year a feature film will be released about the attempted
assassination of Adolf Hitler by Claus Schenk Graf von Stauffenberg on July 20,
1944, with superstar Tom Cruise playing the lead role. Oscar winner Florian
Henckel von Donnersmarck says that he expects this major Hollywood production to
do more &quot;to enhance Germany's image than 10 World Cup championships&quot; could have
done. Do you believe that?

Friedländer: Hardly anyone in the US has ever heard of Stauffenberg -- some of
my students in Los Angeles don't even know who Lenin was. It's plausible to
assume that a film with a superstar could give the impression that Stauffenberg
was a &quot;good guy.&quot; But the vast majority of Americans don't have a clue about
German history, and this film is not about to change that.

SPIEGEL: Thank you for this interview, Professor Friedländer.
