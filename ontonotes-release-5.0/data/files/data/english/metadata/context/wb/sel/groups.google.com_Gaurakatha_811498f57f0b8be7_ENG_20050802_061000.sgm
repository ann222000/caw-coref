Chapter 2: Bhagavan Alone Is the Supreme Truth

His Holiness Swami Gaurangapada : Nityananda! Gauranga! Hare Krishna! Jaya Shrila Prabhupada, Shrila Bhaktisiddhanta, Shrila Bhaktivinoda, Shri Shri Nitai-Gaura Bhakta Vrinda and Shri Shri Radha Krishna Bhakta Vrinda! Jaya Jagannatha! Pranams and Blessings!

One who even simply desires to achieve the 2 lotus feet of Mahaprabhu becomes higher than Indra. Even Indra becomes a servant of such a devotee, he is the king of the heavenly planets, very opulent, 100s of eyes, king of the heavenly planets, he will last another few million years, but even that high position, is not as high as the position of someone who has simply the desire to achieve Gauranga Mahaprabhu, why should one run after rich people or Indra, one should become satisfied to become a devotee, this is a greater riches

Q. What is impersonal consciousness?
A. First, the principle in the material world which separates all things is called visesa (distinction based upon material quality). By merely renouncing material thinking, one only gives up the conception of material distinction, and thereby one's consciousness falls into the realm of nirvisesa (non-distinction). In this condition, one is unable to perceive the differences between material objects, since the self is situated in nirvana or merging with the impersonal abode of Brahman. This state is not a happy one at all; being bereft of the natural bliss of the eternally conscious soul, the prema or ecstatic love for the Lord remains concealed. The eternal pastimes of Sri Krsna are certainly beyond matter; indeed, they are endowed with cin-maya-visesa, or divinely conscious distinction.

His Holiness Swami Gaurangapada : So today we continue verse 9 of Vaishnava Siddhanta Mala, today we will see the beautiful song of Bhaktivinode Thakur in relation to this verse. He has described the 2 obstacles, jada and nirvishesha, material and impersonal consciousnesses

When Lord Gauranga went to Varanasi all the impersonalists were laughing at him. So Lord Gauranga simply ignored them as He is Supreme personality he doesnt interfere in independence
Materialistic people can be devotees with association of devotees, but hardcore Mayavadis could be converted only by the Lord Nityananda and Gauranga

(1)
vishaya-vimudha ar mayavadi jan
bhakti-sunya dunhe prana dhare akaran
1) One who is intoxicated by worldly affairs of sense gratification, as well as one who subscribes to impersonal philosophy, both maintain their lives uselessly, for they are devoid of devotion to You.
(2)
ei dui-sanga natha! na hoy amar
prarthana koriye ami carane tomar
2) I pray at Your lotus feet, O Lord, that I may be spared the company of these two kinds of people.
(3)
se duwera madhye vishayi tabu bhalo
mayavadi-sanga nahi magi kono kalo
3) Yet of the two, the association of a worldly man is better. I never covet the company of a mayavadi.
(4)
vishayi-hridoya jabe sadhu-sanga pay
anayase labhe bhakti bhaktera kripay
4) When by chance the hearts of worldly persons come into contact with Your saintly devotees, they easily attain devotion by the mercy of the devotees.

His Holiness Swami Gaurangapada : Bhagavatam says that human life is not just to make money, but to inquire about the Lord.

My dear lord please keep me away from this 2 kinds of people, if among these 2 of them you desire to give me association,with one of them then i would prefer to associate to materialistic person but never mayavadi
who wants to become one with You. Why ?is explain in next verse. Such aperson without much effort can come to bhakti yoga by mercy of devotee.

in Bhagavatam it is said

tulayama lavenapi
na svargam napunar-bhavam
bhagavat-sangi-sangasya
martyanam kim utasishah
SYNONYMS
tulayama&#8212;to be balanced with; lavena&#8212;by a moment; api&#8212;even; na&#8212;never; svargam&#8212;heavenly planets; na&#8212;nor; apunah-bhavam&#8212;liberation from matter; bhagavat-sangi&#8212;devotee of the Lord; sangasya&#8212;of the association; martyanam&#8212;those who are meant for death; kim&#8212;what is there; uta&#8212;to speak of; asishah&#8212;worldly benediction.
TRANSLATION
The value of a moment&#8217;s association with the devotee of the Lord cannot even be compared to the attainment of heavenly planets or liberation from matter, and what to speak of worldly benedictions in the form of material prosperity, which are for those who are meant for death.

His Holiness Swami Gaurangapada : There is no greater benediction than to actually associate those who are in contact with the Lords Holy Names

&#8216;sadhu-sanga&#8217;, &#8216;sadhu-sanga&#8217;&#8212;&#8212;sarva-sastre kaya
lava-matra sadhu-sange sarva-siddhi haya
SYNONYMS
sadhu-sanga sadhu-sanga&#8212;association with pure devotees; sarva-sastre&#8212;all the revealed scriptures; kaya&#8212;say; lava-matra&#8212;even for a moment; sadhu-sange&#8212;by association with a devotee; sarva-siddhi&#8212;all success; haya&#8212;there is.
TRANSLATION
&#8220;The verdict of all revealed scriptures is that by even a moment&#8217;s association with a pure devotee, one can attain all success.

Harinam Chintamani explains that how a real sadhu is known when he starts speaking, one should try to find out a real devotee not externally how they appear, the only way is according to Bhagavatam is through the ears. The ear is the most important organ. By mercy of sadhu even gross materialistic can become devotee. The devotee of the lord is delivering the higher sinner than the Lord himself. In the presence of Narrotam das a ghost cannot stay, as he is the great devotee. Chand Raya came to Narrotam das and he told him to take bath in Ganges and gave initiation in right ear. The biggest gross materialist became a devotee. Chand Raya became such a great devotee and the Muslim nawab imprisoned him for doing tremendous bhakti. A very huge elephant came near Chandraya, he chanted his gurudevs name, Jaya Narottama das, this is the power of sahdhus. chand raya could throw the elephant one mile away, this is the power the mercy of Narottam das

(5)
mayavada-dosha ja&#8217;ra hridoye pasilo
kutarke hridoya ta&#8217;ra vajra-sama bhelo
5) But the heart which is penetrated by the offensive influence of impersonal philosophy becomes hard as a thunderbolt by degraded sophistry.
haktira swarupa, ara `vishaya&#8217;, `asroy&#8217;
mayavadi `anitya&#8217; boliya saba koy
6) The mayavadi declares that the true form of bhakti, its object (Sri Krishna), and its possessor (the devotee) are all transitory and thus illusory. {evil_smiley}
Candrika Gauranga dasi says (2005-7-31 18:49:15):
mayavadi has no hope

His Holiness Swami Gaurangapada : For mayavadis, mayavadi tries to become bigger bigger n bigger so monistic people started worshipping surya,laxmi,ganesh,vishnu, they use bhakti as a ladder when they become one with god they kick the ladder.

(7)
dhik ta&#8217;ra krishna-seva-sravana-kirtan
krishna-ange vajra hane tahara stavan
7) Fie on his pretense of so-called service to Krishna! Fie on his pretense of engaging in so-called hearing and chanting of Krishna&#8217;s glories! His recitation of prayers strikes the body of Krishna with blows more cruel than thunderbolts.
(8)
mayavada sama bhakti-pratikula nai
ataeva mayavadi-sanga nahi cai
8) There is no philosophy in the world as antagonistic to devotional service as the impersonal mayavada philosophy. Therefore I do not ever desire the association of the mayavadi.

His Holiness Swami Gaurangapada : this is rejected by mayavadi, now we come to important verse, externally some people chant Gauranga,Krsna,Rama, but internally they want to become one with God
it is offensive attitude towards the Lord, they are all tinged with their attitude

(9)
bhakativinoda mayavada dura kori
vaishnava-sangete baise namasraya dhori&#8217;
9) Bhaktivinoda drives away the philosophy of impersonalism and sits safely in the society of Vaishnavas under the shelter of Your holy name.

His Holiness Swami Gaurangapada : Just as one sees with green colour spectacles one will say everthing is green. The Lord being the master, Bhaktivinode thakur says even if somebody pays million dollars i will not associate with mayavadis

hiyara majhare gauranga rakhiye , virale vasiya rabo
manera sadhete se rupa candere , nayane nayane thobo

keeping Gauranga inside my heart, I will sit alone and fix my mind on His enchanting moon like form while chanting His Holy Name. I will gaze in his eyes and become absorbed in His beauty.
