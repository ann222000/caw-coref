It was getting late and I had almost lost the trail three times
tonight.

I've been following little Charlie now for a week.  Mostly through
electronic
records, which was boring, and it only really got exciting this week.

It started with his 15 birthday - his entry into manhood.  He got the
usual:
a cake, an xbox 360, and the obligatory 3 day start.  But he had been
careless,
he had bought food instead of stealing, had been seen on various
security
cameras which I had access to, and had even visited friends.

But like I said, most of that was boring. It was tonight that the
adreniline
had run wild - the night where he had seen me with his own eyes, had
known that
I was there, right on his trail.  It was in a service station.  I had
guessed
which one he would use, simply because of his habits so far, and his
inclination
to buy service station hot dogs - something he had done since he was
10 - usually
with my money.

When he saw me, he ran.

I had been in training for months.  I could outrun a cheetah, but
still he got
away three times.  Once in someones back yard, another time down an
alley way
and over a wire fence, and the third time, through blind luck.  I
tripped over
a tree root in the local park.

But there he was - as bright as day - trying to get his breath back.

I calmed my breath.  I was behind him.  I stepped quietly, making sure
I
didn't step on anything that would alarm him, sitting there on the
park
bench.  I stepped closer, and closer.  The last thing his ears heard
was
his muffled scream.

I took him home, and finished the ceremony.

----

Later, I sat with a glass of port.

I sat there, casually picking the flesh of my young out of my teeth.

The species wouldn't continue this day.

But I heard Harry's kid got away.

Rohan.
