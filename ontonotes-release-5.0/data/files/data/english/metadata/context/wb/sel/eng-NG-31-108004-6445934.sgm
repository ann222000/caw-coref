My poor daughter -- on New Year's Eve, she was cleaning house for a small
party they were having that evening, and decided to change the filter in the
air intake to her heating unit.  This filter is in the floor, in the doorway
leading into her bedroom.

She took off the metal grate, and then got distracted by her dogs.  Of
course she forgot what she'd been doing, and went about her business with
other things, eventually -- you guessed it -- walking into her bedroom.

Of course the filter (filthy dirty filter, I might add) didn't hold her
weight, and she plunged through the hole, stopping when her hip hit the
side, full force.

She was there alone, except for the animals (3 doggies, 3 cats), who didn't
help much, except that the cats tried to investigate and kept trying to jump
into the hole as DD shrieked multiple obscenities.

She came over to my house for lunch today and showed me the bruise.  Ouch,
ouch, and OUCH.  That sucker is the size of a very large canteloupe, and is
a deep purple with rosy red highlights.

And this poor kid is just 32.  I can't imagine what she'll be walking into
by the time she's my age!

Poor Baby---That sounds like something I might do.

If she stil has a sense of humor after hurting herself like that you might
invite her to join the CACC, aka Clutzes of America Club.

POOR girl!  She`s lucky she didn`t break her hip!  I can tell you from
experience that that would have been NO fun at all!  Give her a hug from me
(another one who`s always falling over!).

Poor thing.  Two words - ARNICA Gel.  Get some.  Really. It is like magic to
help with the healing of bruises.  Any health food store, GNC, whole Foods,
Wild Oats.  Buy the tube with the highest percentage of arnica.  Use it 2-3
times a day - no real scent.  Really cuts the healing time.

Maybe it'll get better.  I remember once at about age 18 or so - up on the
hay truck - unloading bales at the stables.  I was the "toss 'em up to the
loft" person -as opposed to the stack 'em in the loft person.  While
standing up there - missed and ended up with one leg sliding all the way
down - stopping in a near vertical split - on leg up on top - me kind of
oddly bent and the other stuck, wedged down a couple of rows of hay bales.
Took a while to get someone up there to unblock me.  No real bruise - but a
heck of a groin strain, so to speak.

Another good tip for bruises, from a sports medicine expert in my area - ice
for 48 hours to slow the bruising down, then warm packs to help speed up
blood flow to the area - this helps get more healing cells into the area to
help it heal a bit faster.  The waiting after the first couple of days is
important though, need to wait for the broken blood vessels to heal.  One
other thing - remember that the bruise will darken the first few days - this
is normal and doesn't mean it's getting worse as some people will think.
