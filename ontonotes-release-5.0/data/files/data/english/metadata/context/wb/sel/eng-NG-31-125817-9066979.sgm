Is there a decent alternative to these? I don't want to use spade connectors
or similar as I want to permanently attach an iso connector to my car's
wiring.

For some reason, the motor trade favour soldered joints insulated with heat
shrink sleeving.

This is out of step with the rest of the electrical world, where soldered
joints are considered at best a bodge, at worst a breaker of regulations.

Whichever method you use, if done properly it will be reliable.

Solder &amp; heatshrink, or the duraseal buttcrimp with integral  heatshrinks
work well. You'll need both sizes though. Tycos all in one heatshrink &amp;

We're talking inside a dashboard. I've got no itching desire to start
wafting a soldering iron around the inside of my car. Perhaps the best way
forward would be to buy a multiconnector thing. It'd mean a load of crimped
spade joints, but at least it's pretty tidy compared to a rats nest of butt
joints of uncertain crimp quality - having used non-insulated crimps, pre
insulated ones seem like a massive bodge.

It doesn't.  Look at all those multi-way connectors inside your PC -
crimped connectors clicked into a plastic housing.  Look at the
connections through your phone line - crimps or IDCs for nigh-on 30
years now.

Solder's OK when it's new, but it's slow to make and doesn't last well
with vibration. Aerospace used it into the '70s, but only by
individually stress-relieving each pin with a tight rubber sleeve and a
pair of virgin pliers.

IIRC if you heat copper and let it cool naturally, it becomes &quot;work

becomes ductile and workable.

If you work it (hit or bend it) it becomes work-hardened. There's no
heat-based process that hardens it.

Copper, unlike steel, is a (relatively) pure alloy and it only has one
phase. The heat-based processes on steel work by moving carbon in and
out of solution and by changing the phase that the steel grains are in
(i.e. martensite, austenite etc.) -- you can't do that to copper. All
you can do with copper is to mechanically damage the crystal lattice,
introducing dislocations that make it stiffer and more brittle.
Heating relaxes these dislocations and restores the undisturbed
lattice, making it soft again. Because this is a lattice change, not a
phase change, it just doesn't matter if you cool it slowly or quickly
afterwards.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Is there a decent alternative to these? I don't want to use spade
&gt;&gt;&gt; connectors or similar as I want to permanently attach an iso

&gt;&gt; Permanently? twist the wires together and cover with insulating tape.

Yeah, everybodyu knows you should just use a wire nut on it.

Good grief. I've yet to see an example of soldering on maker's looms. So
any aftermarket additions should be using correctly crimped connectors of
a similar type. The correct crimping tool takes up no more room on a van
than a soldering iron and is much more practical at the roadside.

If one connection on an original loom is faulty I'd say there will be
others quickly following it - given they are *all* crimped on manufacture.
And all of a similar design. Any major alterations would consist of using
a new supplied loom or part loom - dealers rarely have qualified auto
electricians on call and rely on fitters. If you were replacing a
faulty/damaged plug with a new one of the same design the connectors will
be crimp types so should be crimped - not soldered. And crimped with the
correct tool. Which will give OE results.

An AA van can't carry all the correct connectors as used in OE looms. But
they can carry ones suitable for repairing damaged wiring. And these
needn't be identical to OE ones. I certainly wouldn't expect a roadside
repair of this nature to be permanent so those pre-insulated types would
do as a temporary measure. Soldering simply isn't possible under all
conditions. Like in a high wind. Crimping is.

Trying to solder to an old corroded and damaged 'pin' or whatever at the
roadside is simply a bodge. A main dealer should replace the pin or
complete connector using the same method as OE - ie crimping. It simply
needs a special tool - like many other special tools a main dealer should
have. And requires less skill than soldering. So no bad thing given the
average dealer.

There is no need to use these abortions. Proper crimps specifically for
car use of all the common types can be bought from the likes of Vehicle
Wiring Products. As can the correct crimp tool(s).

http://www.vehicle-wiring-products.eu/VWP-onlinestore/terminalsnonins...

There's absolutely no excuse for pros to use anything else. Or any hobby
type if he wants a reliable result. And I've discovered this through
experience of repairing/modifying car electrics for many a year. At one
time I'd have agreed that soldering was the way to go. But not anymore.

I'd suggest you do one of each using the same wire and connectors etc and
see which fails first. I have and I know it's the soldered one.
If the wire pulls out of the crimp you haven't made it properly. As is
often the case with those diabolical pre-insulated types even when using
the correct tool where the cable is at the bottom end of the sizes
permitted. If you open one up you'll see why - the crimp tool merely
flattens the crimp. A properly made crimp wraps the crimp round the cable
by using heart shaped jaws.

Terminals designed for crimping have the strain part of the crimp which
grips the insulation close to the 'business' part and within the distance
where the copper will have been weakened by the heat. To provide an
adequate mechanical strain relief they would have to be much further down
the cable where the heat hasn't reached.

&gt;&gt; Copper, unlike steel, is a (relatively) pure alloy and it only has one
&gt;&gt; phase. The heat-based processes on steel work by moving carbon in and
&gt;&gt; out of solution and by changing the phase that the steel grains are in
&gt;&gt; (i.e. martensite, austenite etc.) -- you can't do that to copper. All
&gt;&gt; you can do with copper is to mechanically damage the crystal lattice,
&gt;&gt; introducing dislocations that make it stiffer and more brittle.
&gt;&gt; Heating relaxes these dislocations and restores the undisturbed
&gt;&gt; lattice, making it soft again. Because this is a lattice change, not a
&gt;&gt; phase change, it just doesn't matter if you cool it slowly or quickly
&gt;&gt; afterwards.
&gt; If you repeatedly flex a soldered joint it will always break just after
&gt; the solder. I dunno the chemical reason, but soldering weakens the copper
&gt; whereas crimping doesn't.

They break at the point where solder ends and bare copper starts simply
because that point is a natural point of high stress. Reinforce
anything and it will always break at the point where the reinforcement
ends - nothing to do with the soldering, or chemical reaction.

That would depend upon how the soldered joint is achieved. A properly
made soldered joint will have better conductivity than a crimped one.
Properly constructed it will as strong as the cable it is intended to
join. With proper strain relief added it will be less likely to
concentrate the strain at the soldered/unsoldered boundary and cause a
fracture, plus they are less bulky.

Given a choice between a crimped or soldered joint (done by someone
properly skilled), then my choice is always soldered.

Car terminals designed for crimping include a crimped strain relieve which
goes round the insulation. Crimp one of these properly - and then solder
one then crimp the strain relief - which of course can't be soldered -
then flex them both and see which breaks first. It will be the soldered
one. A connector designed for soldering will be of a different design to
one designed for crimping. That's obvious by simply looking.

Whilst I accept that you cannot solder to corroded parts, nor can you

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I'm not sure what your definition of aftermarket is; all main dealer
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; electrical work I have seen has been soldered.

&gt;&gt; &gt; What main dealer work would you be talking about?

&gt;&gt; Recall alterations, fault repair to sensor connectors - pretty much
&gt;&gt; everything. All soldered.

&gt; If one connection on an original loom is faulty I'd say there will be
&gt; others quickly following it - given they are *all* crimped on manufacture.
&gt; And all of a similar design. Any major alterations would consist of using
&gt; a new supplied loom or part loom - dealers rarely have qualified auto
&gt; electricians on call and rely on fitters. If you were replacing a
&gt; faulty/damaged plug with a new one of the same design the connectors will
&gt; be crimp types so should be crimped - not soldered. And crimped with the
&gt; correct tool. Which will give OE results.

Nope! Repair kits for damaged connectors supplied by manufacturers come with
short fly leads ready for connection to the original loom. The fly lead is
crimped to the connector; it is joined to the existing loom by soldering.

It often happens that one connector becomes faulty. The most common is
probably the connection to the heater fan speed resistor pack. These often
burn out, usually as a result of failure to replace the pollen filter, and
destroy the loom connector. A repair kit is then used.

Why would a whole loom section need to be replaced if just one connector is
faulty?

Because it is so common to replace electrical parts on cars now, all motor
vehicle technician training includes basic electrical skills - at least VAG
and Ford does.

&gt;&gt; This is what is being discussed.

&gt; An AA van can't carry all the correct connectors as used in OE looms. But
&gt; they can carry ones suitable for repairing damaged wiring. And these
&gt; needn't be identical to OE ones. I certainly wouldn't expect a roadside
&gt; repair of this nature to be permanent so those pre-insulated types would
&gt; do as a temporary measure. Soldering simply isn't possible under all
&gt; conditions. Like in a high wind. Crimping is.

I can assure you 100% that the most common way for an AA patrol to repair a

&gt; Yes - it is common where say earths are grouped together. But not at any
&gt; other connector. They are all crimped.

&gt;&gt; &gt; So any aftermarket additions should be using correctly crimped
&gt;&gt; &gt; connectors of a similar type.

&gt;&gt; I'm not sure what you mean here.

&gt;&gt; We are discussing repair situations or alterations where for example the
&gt;&gt; connector at the end of a section of loom needs replacing. There won't
&gt;&gt; have been a joint there originally, so it would be impossible to use &quot;a
&gt;&gt; similar type.&quot;

&gt; You can replace even a multiplug with a new one of the correct type. Or
&gt; even just the damaged 'pins'. Anything else is just a temporary bodge.

You *can*. Main dealers, and the AA, generally *don't*!

When a connector has been damaged, it is usually the case that overheating
has occurred. This will usually be caused by a high resistance at the
interface between a pin and its socket. The overheated connection damages
the loom locally. That is why the repair kit that I have described is a
much better method than just replacing the connector.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; I'm pretty sure no one is advocating soldering wires directly to an item
&gt;&gt; that originally had a plug in connection!

&gt;&gt; &gt; The correct crimping tool takes up no more room on a van than a
&gt;&gt; &gt; soldering iron and is much more practical at the roadside.

&gt;&gt; Much more difficult to keep a decent stock of crimps than it is to carry
&gt;&gt; a reel of solder however...

&gt; Trying to solder to an old corroded and damaged 'pin' or whatever at the
&gt; roadside is simply a bodge. A main dealer should replace the pin or
&gt; complete connector using the same method as OE - ie crimping. It simply
&gt; needs a special tool - like many other special tools a main dealer should
&gt; have. And requires less skill than soldering. So no bad thing given the
&gt; average dealer.
">

Dave, you are missing the point here I think!

I'm not suggesting for a minute that a repair would be carried out by
soldering directly to a pin that was designed to be crimped.

My points above should clarify how these repairs are commonly carried out.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; I'm with you 100% on the desirability of properly applied crimps versus
&gt;&gt; soldered joints, Dave. 40 years of experience in the electrical industry

&gt; Not that I've ever seen it. I'm not happy with any dealer touching car

Where did I say that? I'm merely telling you what happens at the roadside

this thread, except to say that either crimping or soldering would be OK
for the OP if done properly.

Yes - but not connectors. The only soldered connections within a car loom
that I've seen are where several earths are grouped into one etc and
protected from any flexing by the position within the loom - they are
inaccessible and bound within it. Never on a multi-pin connector that may
only ever be unplugged etc at build time. Those are always crimped.

Crimped connections onto wire/cable are much cheaper and more reliable
to do in automated manufacture. Flow soldering is cheaper and more

Not really. These things are installed aftermarket by monkeys. Who would
use sellotape and Scotchblocks if it saved money. And the other reason is
a soldered connection can't be unplugged. Nothing to do with the quality
