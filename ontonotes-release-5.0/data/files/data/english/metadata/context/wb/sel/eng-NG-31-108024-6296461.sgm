Hello All:

Just got back into town and have almost caught up.  Thus, I am planning a trip to the dark side, slowed cooked pumpernickel/ 100% rye, that is.  However, I have become very confused.  After numerous hours in the archives I find too much information.  Some recopies use old bread, others don't.  Some use cooked rye berries, others don't.  One even uses baker's yeast in the final dough.

I also do not have water baths, aquarium heater(s), Pullman pans or a crock pot baking insert.  Moreover, my grant request to NAS (National Academy of Sciences) for a yeast/lactobacilli particle accelerator was denied &lt;g&gt;.

I do have a Romertopf #111 ( http://www.fantes.com/bakers.htm#romertopf ) in which a 2# loaf pan fits nicely.  I also have relatively well sealing/ self basting Dutch ovens of various sizes as well as soufflé dishes and large covered casserole dishes (round and square that will fit inside various Dutch ovens).

To date, the most straightforward recipe for this sourdough dummy is provided by Dick A:( http://groups.google.com/group/rec.food.sourdough/browse_thread/threa... ).

Thus, my current plan is to make Dick A's 1 day sour "Vollkorn" rye pan bread "without tears"  but slow bake it 16 hours +/-.  I have made it before following his directions baking at 375F and it did well.

Specifically, I plan to soak the Romertopf, put a well greased loaf pan with the dough inside it, let it rise covered to double for an hour +/-, put it into a cold oven, set to 375F, when it gets to temp hold for 30 minutes (just guessing that this is probably enough time for the Romertopf to heat through), decrease temp to 240F and time bake for roughly 12 hours followed by 1 hour at 170F*.  Next, I'll allow the Romertopf to remain in the oven for 3 hours, slowly cooling.  Finally, I plan to remove Romertopf from the oven and allow it to cool to nearly room temp before removing the lid.  Then, I'll remove the pan from the Romertopf and the bread from the pan and allow the finished loaf to sit wrapped in a cotton towel for 24 hours before slicing (or at least try).

Other possibilities include covered casseroles in a self basting Dutch oven or an open soufflé dish in the same Dutch oven.  At the far extreme, the whole mess could go into a Reynolds turkey size oven baking bag ensuring a self-contained micro baking environment from which I would assume negligible moisture could escape!

Confusion lies in whether one is trying to add moisture to a 70%+ hydration dough or prevent / minimize moisture loss from that dough.  I assume that one is trying to prevent moisture loss.  That is, the goal is to get the rye to absorb much/all of the moisture in the baking process.  If so, I believe that both the Romertopf and the self basting Dutch ovens should achieve that goal.  The Reynolds bag is probably overkill but might be a means to bake several pan loaves at once in the same bag and without using the other utensils.

Suggestions?  Does anyone see any flaws?  Other ideas or recommendations?  Do I need to turn on Sabbath mode and bake the full 15 +/- hours at 240F?

Many thanks,

Ray

*My oven time bakes for a maximum of 11 hours 59 minutes followed by 1 hour at 170F (keep warm) unless I switch to Sabbath mode.  However, switching to Sabbath mode is very easy.

There are reasons for the variations. For example, cooking the berries
first converts some starch to maltose which depending on your baking
process, either makes for sweeter bread or gives the dough more sugar
to work on. It also softens the bran which helps modestly in the rise,
not that 100% rye rises much. I'd follow Samartha's procedure. It's
very straightforward. You can omit the Detmold business and go with a
simple inoculation. You've got rye flour, rye meal and cracked rye as
ingredients. Which is to say... powder to relatively coarse rye. You
will want to soak the cracked rye for a day or two. I'd put the starter
in with the cracked rye soaker and let things get going. It will
ferment more slowly than flour so it won't get away from you. Weight
everything so know what your eventual hydration is.

My best pumpernickel batches have been cooked in a GE roaster oven
(like super-huge rectangular crock pot) using small (1/2 size) bread
pans and several inches of water as a water bath. I seal the pans with
foil, set them on a roasting rack and add water until it's 3/4 of the
way up the side of the pans. Then simmer for 12 hours. I think this
translates to your Romertopf or covered dutch oven approach. The water
bath helps. It keeps the temperature steady and is easy to regulate.

Couple of things... the dough will not double. It will rise perhaps
15%, give or take, depending on your flour to meal to chop ratio. Also
the dough is very sticky. This isn't something you knead. You mix it
and using wet hands, pack the bread pans about 80% full. To be honest,
I hesitate to call it dough, it's more like glop. But after 6 or 7
hours of baking the glop, you will get your first hint of great things
to come. It will not smell like bread. It will smell like fruit pie.
When you're done... let it cool in the pans, then invert. It will need
a day or two to "cure", which is to say dry out. You will, of course,
want to sample it before then... we all do.

My loaves have always been best on the 4th day after baking. The
improvement is noticeable.

Hi Will:

Thanks for coming to the rescue.  However, Ray has already fallen far, far,
far down into the pumpernickel well &lt;g&gt;.

I started using Dick A's recipe yesterday.  I ground the rye on number 6
click (out of 8) in my Champion Juicer grinder.  Needless, to say it was
Very, Very course.  Following directions I continued to add 1/4c water every
so often trying to get a slight film of water on the top (last time I needed
an extra 1/4 cup).  Yet this time I was amazed at how much water was being
sucked-up by the grain!  After adding roughly a cup of water (I did not
weigh or measure carefully) over the course of 6 hours I finally realized
that the roughage/ bran was floating on top!

To compensate I intended to increase flour by up to 320g (estimate 1c water
~ 225g) and maintain 70% hydration but ended up only adding 270g.  Frankly,
the dough seamed a little dryer than I remembered.  I wish I had held back
more flour.  However, my previous notes using the same recipe (but Hodgson
Mill rye flour not home ground) compared it to my Pfeffernusse dough so it
was somewhat close.

Regardless, these were very major screw-ups combined with procedure/
ingredient changes.  Somewhat like jumping out of an airplane without a
parachute.  There is no going back.  However, the difference is I will get
to try again.

Based on your suggestion, I ground the remaining flour this AM with 1/2 as
fine as my machine will grind and the other 1/2 backed off 1 click.  So I
hopefully approximated 1/3 fine, 1/3 medium and 1/3 cracked as you
suggested.

Obviously, I now had a larger batch of dough - 1400 grams +/- than I
originally intended.  Using the paddle attachment versus the dough hook made
my Kitchen Aid whine.  It was not happy.

I therefore switched to plan B.  Romertopf out.  Based on your advice I am
going to a water bath.  I have an 11 cup covered casserole (well greased and
floured) which fits nicely in a 4 gallon self-basting stock/ roasting pot.

The combo allowed for almost 1 gallon of water for the bath before the empty
casserole floated.  I will place the casserole with the dough on two stacked
trivets.  I will add as much water as I can without making the casserole
float -- assume that 2/3 - 3/4 up the side will be no problem.  I am
guessing that it will not boil off with the pot covered.

As I write this the dough is proofing.  Last time I made this I was
surprised at how fast and how much it rose.  This time I am not so sure it
will even rise.  Last time I used the SDI OSF as the inoculation; this time
I used the SDI Russian - another change.  However, this time I did keep back
a rye starter for future use.

Regardless, since this is roughly 4 pounds of dough, after the initial 375F
30 minute bake, I plan to bake for a full 16 hours at 240F followed by an
hour at 170F, and then a long cooling rest in the closed oven until
whenever I get up in the AM.  I also plan to use just the casserole lid
versus a secure sealing with foil -- WEGing (wild-eye guessing) that the
dough might incorporate some of the steam from the micro baking environment
as/ if needed.  Have even mused about not covering the dish at all -- just
baking/ cooking in the steam environment.

If you have suggestions on baking times/ temps or anything they would be
appreciated.  Expect to put the dough into the oven around Noon (EDT) +/-.

As always, thanks for the time and help.

Regards,

Ray

The bread is now cooling.  In three or four hours I will wrap it in a lint-free cotton towel and allow it to sit for 24 hours before slicing.  Final baked weight after an hour of cooling is 1428g -- initial dough weight in previous post was unfortunately only a guestimate.

At the end of an 18 3/4 hour undisturbed, bake it seemed that the wonderful fruity fragrance was beginning to decrease in intensity (standing at the front of the gas range.  But I may have just become more acclimated to it; who knows.  The aroma filled the house overnight and was quite pleasant; although I woke-up hungry several times during the night &lt;g&gt;.).

I took the baking vessel out and peaked inside.  Some of the water from the bath had migrated into the bread; the loaf was wet around the edges with a very small amount of visible water (I had used the glass casserole lid to cover not foil.).  A very tiny amount of dough completely dissolved in the remaining water bath was also apparent.  (Post bake measuring indicates roughly 40 - 45% of the initial water bath evaporated using this vessel and method.)

I removed the casserole and inserted a digital thermometer (See: http://www.amazon.com/Polder-307-Deluxe-Preset-Thermometer/dp/B00004S... ) into the center of the loaf - 208F.  I left the probe in the bread, covered with foil (sans glass lid), and returned to the oven with the temperature lowered to 220F.  I baked two more hours - checking the internal temperature on the remote read every 10 minutes.  The internal temperature at one point got to 209F but then over time fell back to 208F.

At the end of two hours I peaked. the bread had slightly pulled away from all the sides.  No water visible.  I removed from the oven and inverted on a cooling rack.  It easily released.  The additional cooking absorbed all of the liquid.*

Perhaps a half of a teaspoon of bread stuck to the side of the dish and broke away from the loaf.  It was easily the best Pumpernickel I have ever tasted.  However, my reference points are ordinary American -- store bought and homemade pseudo pumpernickels -- so not much to go on.

The color is very dark - similar to the yeasted, pseudo pumpernickel I have made before using cocoa powder.  The loaf seems darker than I remember the loaf I made before using Dick A's recipe and baking it at 375F for 1 hour (sans all the screw-ups), but that may be simply faulty memory (which is persistent and increasingly pervasive).

Overall, I am very, very pleased.  Many thanks to Dick A for the initial recipe, Samartha for his very informative write-up and overall informative site, Will for his encouragement to try making real Pumpernickel (and email hand-holding) and too numerous others to list but found in the archives with postings on this subject over the years.

I have also devised a new recipe using Samartha's Detmold 3 calculator that should produce two 1.5# loaves.  Two loaves will allow me to futz with the baking process.  It will also allow me to compare it with this result; although my gustatory memory over time is dubious at its best.  Regardless, this is and was a winner.

My goal is to get this recipe/ procedure down so that I can have very good pumpernickel on the table as an offering at the Thanksgiving feast.  If successful, I will be happy to share the results; that is, if there is any interest.

Regards,

Ray

*Total baking time 20 hours and 45 minutes (45 min @375F {cold start: 45 minutes after coming to temp); 18 hours @ 240F (both of these bakes with dough in a well-greased (Crisco) and rye floured, covered, Corning casserole (similar to: http://www.amazon.com/Corning-Quart-Square-Covered-Casserole/dp/B0002... ) resting on two trivets and inside a covered 4 gallon stock pot (See: http://www.amazon.com/Farberware-Classic-16-Quart-Stainless-Steel-Sto... ) containing 1 gallon +/- water bath); finally, 2 hrs in a dry oven @ 220F still in Corning casserole, sans lid but covered with foil (slightly vented because of poor seal around temperature probe).

"if" ? You're joking, I hope!
It sounds like you're extremely close, if not already at your goal.

Hey Dave:

Until I slice the loaf tomorrow I really don't know what the crumb is going
to be like.  Was 208F internal temperature at sea level too hot?  Is it too
dry?  Will it crumble and fall apart when I try to slice it?  No clue.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;From the small bite I had the flavor is there as well as my unsophisticated
">

taste knows.  The worst case is I have 1400g+ of "old bread" to incorporate
into my new recipe &lt;g&gt;.  Furthermore, I learned a lot.

As for the recipe/ method, everything is pretty much in these posts.  I
converted Dick's volume recipe
( http://groups.google.com/group/rec.food.sourdough/browse_thread/threa... )
to weight targeting a 70% +/- hydration:

255g rye (this time I used very, very course freshly, home-ground from
organic rye berries - in the past I have used Hodgson Mill's medium rye for
the entire recipe)
2Tbl (42g) molasses (weight may vary - check your bottle under serving size)
2c (450g water) mine is filtered with a GE under sink system.  Use what ever
you use in bread making/ culture management.
30g active sourdough starter (Mine is 100% hydration.  Although probably
optional since rye is self-souring, this isn't a starter that has sat in the
refrigerator for more than a week unused and un-refreshed.)

Follow Dick's directions -- Proof 16 to 24 hours until collapse; add water
as necessary, etc., all per his instructions (but make sure if you are using
really course stuff it is not just floating on top of the water and screw up
like I did.).  (Also: The last time I made it I added roughly 1/4 cup of
water to the slurry / first proof so my final hydration was probably closer
to 80% that try.)

I converted Dick's second addition to:

385g Rye flour
1t common table salt (~8g of any other variety)

His recipe is very, straight forward, imho.  Personally, I prefer to measure
by weight, thus the conversion.  Use moistened hands to shape the dough; no
more flour.

You might want to start there first, as I did before moving on to the long
bake.  It produces a decent loaf of bread.  It also gave me a little feel
for what to expect for the final dough/ glop/ mud pie since I hadn't done
this before.  It's also done in a day versus 2 or 3, if you wait to slice.

Either way, grease (butter / Crisco) and flour the pans with some rye flour,
too.  Personally, I am finding that the term "non-stick" ranks near the term
"honest politician" in veracity.

I have not made my new recipe yet and I do not want to post an untried,
untested potential flop.  I sent it to a couple of people off-site who know
more about making bread in their little fingers than I do in my whole body
for comments/ feedback.  I researched it taking a little from the archives
and Samartha's site for the Detmold 3 build.  I have enough confidence in it
to spend 3 days making it but that's no guarantee.

If I make it twice and it comes out OK I will post it so that someone else
can hopefully replicate it.  Again, that is if anyone is interested.

Best of luck.  Hope this helps.

Ray

Hey Dave:

I'd encourage you to just wade in and give it a try.  Nothing beats
practice.  I usually bake roughly 800g loaves so I get to bake more
frequently.  I keep notes on every bake (copies of all these emails are with
this latest bake).  I believe that my end results are improving.  I enjoy
it.  If it gets to be a chore I'll stop and take a break.

Frankly, I believe that everything you need is in this thread to make the
bread I just made.  If you need more information - ask.  However, I would
guess it will weigh much less.  My best WEG (wild-eyed guess) is to weigh
your final dough, assume that I started with roughly 1600g of dough and
divide your dough weight by 1600g.  Take the resulting decimal x 20 (my
total low temperature baking time) for a guess as to the time you will need
to low temp bake your loaf.  Drop it down to 220F that last couple of hours
to be safe.

Dick has a crock pot method.  Will uses a table top roaster.  I used the
casserole dish in the stock pot.  Before I am done futzing around don't be
surprised if I cook a loaf in a casserole dish inside my pressure cooker on
the stove top {the results may never be recorded on this website -- I fear
the Pumpernickel police}!  Improvise.  Go bake.

If you want to experiment, next time I do this, I plan to put a oven-proof
clear glass container on the same shelf as the baking vessel.  The glass
will be clearly visible through the oven window (e.g., Pyrex 1 cup measuring
cup).  It will contain 3/4 to 1 cup water the same faucet temperature as
that in the enclosed water bath.  When the water in that cup comes to a
boil, I will reduce the heat from 375F to 240F and evaluate the results at
the end.

This is an untried procedure which came from brainstorming.  It assumes that
both vessels of water will boil at approximately the same time.  It may be
fallacious reasoning -- I'll leave that to those with more relevant
thermodynamic experience to decipher.

Jump in.  Fall is on the way.  With open windows one can always use an extra
door stop.  Frankly, I've seldom made in inedible loaf.

Regards,

Ray

Ah well... sounds very good &lt;g&gt;. IMO, it's just not possible to compare
the real thing to the store variety. Maybe in Germany, but only
Samartha and Ulrike and possibly Kenneth, who makes bread pilgrimages,
would know. I lived in Manhattan for 8 years and never once saw the
real thing despite all the Jewish bakeries, the Euro-bakeries, yada,
yada. Ottomanelli's in Yorkville was the closest. They had a full-bore
multi-grain dark bread called malstavit that they sold as a health and
weight-loss product. It was a distant cousin. The weight-loss notion
was non-sense, but shrewd marketing. That way they could sell bread to
thin women &lt;g&gt;...

&gt; the real thing to the store variety. Maybe in Germany, but only
&gt; Samartha and Ulrike and possibly Kenneth, who makes bread pilgrimages,
&gt; would know.

I recently sliced it.  It is a little doughy; perhaps 210F internal
temperature at sea level would be better for the next bake.  The flavor is
simply awesome.  The best I remember.

Haven't even bothered to put anything on it yet but I can imagine cream
cheese or a Reuben with horseradish that doesn't get mushy and fall apart.
I am so very pleased, thanks for the encouragement.

Having been instrumental in the idea of baking bread to a different
temperature at higher altitudes, I have to say that I am beginning to
have second thoughts.  Yes, water does boil at lower temperatures as
you move up in elevation.  But, does that impact the baking process of
bread?  At a certain temperature, bread firms up, at another
temperature it's done.  The temperature depends, it seems, more on the
taste of the baker and the recipe than the altitude.  Only some of the
process actually depends on boiling off the water.

Over the past year or so, I've been increasing my target temperatures,
and they are approaching what people at sea level use.

Yes... there ARE differences in baking at sea level and higher
elevations.  But I am coming to the conclusion that the temperature at
which bread is done isn't one of them.

I've been having similar thoughts (4500ft here), but have you not
observed that it stays at boiling point for a long time (i.e. until
all/most of the moisture is boiled out)? Boiling point is 204F here, and
if I watch the probe thermometer it will steadily rise to 204, then stay
there until it's too late and the bread is too dry. OTOH, if I take the
bread out right when the thermometer alarm goes off at 204, it may still
be too gummy if it was a particularly high-hydration bread. I generally
bake to 200 plus five minutes, but it does depend on oven temp,
hydration, size of loaf, observed crust browning, and desired result.

I have been feeding my rye starter since yesterday.  As far as I know it is
doing very well.  (Every 12 hours I stir it down, take 10g out (dump the
rest - trash not drain) feed 20g flour and 20g water mix well, spray the top
to get a slight film of water and cover until the next cycle.)

Tomorrow, I plan to start my Detmold 3 build for a test recipe using a
wopping 4g from this starter!  The recipe and build were formulated using
information from Samartha's site.  It is a scaled version of
http://samartha.net/SD/recipes/Pumpernickel.html with some minor variations.
Based on that recipe and some other forgotten information I settled in on
72% hydration.

However, tonight I just stumbled on an old post  by Kenneth
( http://groups.google.com/group/rec.food.sourdough/browse_thread/threa... )
reporting a 90% hydration recipe.  Yipes!

I made my first batch using roughly 70% +/- (lots of screw ups) and as far
as I know it is OK.  Best I ever had or baked.  But I am far from being a
Pumpernickel connoisseur.  What gives?  What is a good hydration for
Pumpernickel?

Thanks,

Ray
