National Grid has the right qualification to operate an electric
utility like Keyspan in New York, it can be relied on to have
blackouts, like the massive electricity outage on August 28, 2003 that
shut down the London Underground.

In New York back then, on August 14, 2003, a massive electric blackout
knocked out Con Edison power in New York City for almost 24 hours, but
Keyspan on Long Island managed to limit the blackout to a few hours in
most Long Island areas in its power grid, thanks to a large work force
of technicians to reset outages in the grid.  That trained work force
will soon be history, thanks to National Grid retirement incentives to
reduce the unionized worker payroll.  (Note: Long Island communities
with municipal power plants, like Freeport, suffered no interruption
in electrical service.)

Reducing the work force needed to restore power in case of another
blackout makes no sense to anybody but a shareholder in National Grid
or a politician or government regulator on the take, waiting to get
that deferred kickback, once the Keyspan takeover is locked in.

This takeover deal, which resembles a subprime mortgage deal more than
anything else, is dependent on National Grid's ability to raise energy
rates and also cut services to its customers.  No problem, New York
has a lap dog Public Service Commission which is all talk and no
action, as Con Edison well knows.

Coming soon, peak usage rates of 30 cents per kilowatt hour.

Uncertainty surrounds KeySpan deal

With National Grid's buyout of KeySpan accomplished in a flurry of
regulatory activity last week, implications of the $11.8 billion debt-
laden deal are settling in -- and unsettling some local critics.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;From worries about job losses to a state comptroller miffed about ill-
">

served Long Island ratepayers to a state senator concerned about
foreign ownership of vital local utility assets, the buyout has yet to
win the hearts of those it will most affect.

&quot;The deal holds too much uncertainty about protections for ratepayers
and the future of Long Island's power supply,&quot; State Sen. Kenneth
LaValle said in a statement Friday, adding he was not pleased a
foreign-based company would be &quot;controlling Long Island's energy
destiny.&quot;
First announced in February 2006, the buyout by National Grid puts
more than a dozen power plants that account for 60 percent of Long
Island's energy generation in the hands of a London-based owner -- one
already under investigation by state regulators for three years of
spotty service in upstate New York.

In two recent open sessions of the state Public Service Commission --
the final regulatory hurdle -- questions about service problems and
National Grid's plan to cut jobs to produce &quot;synergy savings&quot; proved a
common refrain. But the four commissioners voted unanimously to
approve the deal Wednesday, saying a list of new conditions accepted
by National Grid on Friday gave assurances that ratepayers would be
protected.

One long-time utility observer had doubts, suggesting the political
stars appeared to be aligned for the sale's approval, despite a
laundry list of concerns.

&quot;It appears as though KeySpan bought a lot of friends,&quot; said Sheldon
Sackstein, a former Long Island Power Authority trustee and chairman
of business group Action Long Island. &quot;There should have been more
political courage displayed.&quot;

State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli, who approved LIPA's contracts with
National Grid on Friday despite apparent misgivings, noted, &quot;LIPA
ratepayers were not afforded that same degree of regulatory oversight
[in the PSC review] and protection as other ratepayers in the state.&quot;
LIPA's contracts with National Grid extend to 2013, and DiNapoli
insists the authority put the contract out to bid at that time.

National Grid officials have maintained all along that the deal
offered tangible benefits to New York ratepayers -- tallied at $700
million by the PSC -- and they vowed to improve service and invest in
the antiquated infrastructure.

&quot;We are totally committed to making sure our customers and
shareholders receive the benefits coming from this merger,&quot; chief
executive Steve Holliday said in a statement Friday. &quot;The substantial
opportunities for cost savings are clear, and with our investment
capability we can really unlock KeySpan's growth potential.&quot;

On Friday, National Grid confirmed some 300 former KeySpan employees
took an early retirement offer, while 240 at National Grid also would
leave.

One Hicksville-based manager who is remaining said National Grid had
circulated &quot;skill assessment&quot; forms a week before the sale. &quot;Nobody
knows where they are going to land right now with the exception of
vice presidents&quot; and above, said the manager, who asked not to be
named for fear of losing his job.

A worker said a second wave of unionized field technicians is expected
to begin leaving once upgraded retirement benefits negotiated last
year kick in at the end of February.

The worker acknowledged that the union, local 1049 of the
International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, supported the buyout
after negotiating a favorable contract, but he now worries it was a
mistake. He expects as many as 400 to leave beginning in the spring.

National Grid spokesman David Manning said that number &quot;sounded high&quot;
and noted there was &quot;some new hiring going on&quot; in the unionized ranks.
The company said its goal was to achieve workforce-related savings
over three years. He said skill assessment forms passed out to workers
were part of a new &quot;sophisticated approach&quot; to human resources.

Manning took exception to a claim by attorneys for Nassau and Suffolk
counties during the PSC review that the counties' anticipated loss of
1,800 jobs could have a local impact of $100 million. He said the
figure failed to account for retirement benefits being put back into
the economy and it &quot;ignored opportunities for re-employment.&quot;

But some questioned how much hiring National Grid will be able to do
given the new debt it took on and the long list of new conditions it
agreed to as the PSC review closed. One of them involved the sale of
Ravenswood, the giant Queens power plant that was considered an
important asset in the sale.

&quot;With all the concessions Grid is making, they have to be able to
recapture some of the value,&quot; said utility veteran Matthew Cordaro,
acting dean at the College of Management at Long Island University's
C.W. Post Campus.

Manning said service would not be hindered by the conditions. &quot;The
final benefits will be realized with no loss of performance.&quot;
National Grid Transco

National Grid Transco put aside its involvement in the worst power
failure in 25 years to predict higher than expected first-half profits
yesterday.

The company said interim profits before tax and exceptionals would be
&quot;substantially ahead of the same period last year&quot; as a result of
tough cost-cutting and low interest rates.

Investigations by the energy regulator and the department of trade and
industry are still under way into how sections of London Transport
were paralysed on August 28.

The company blamed the fitting of a faulty fuse for the chaos but
critics fear privatisation or cost-cutting could have led to the
problems.

National Grid attributed the strong operating performance in the six
months to September 30 to &quot;the realisation of significant merger
savings and continued cost reductions throughout the business&quot;.

Last night a Grid spokesman dismissed any link between the power
outage and the drive to take costs out of the business. &quot;It happens
not be true,&quot; he said.

Transmission provider National Grid completed a merger with gas
utility Transco in October last year and predicted it would make
savings of £100m per annum but this has been increased to £130m.

Shares in the Grid rose nearly 2% to 398p as the company declared that
net debt would remain broadly unchanged from the £14.2bn level seen at
the end of the last financial year.

Interim operating profits at the company are also expected to be level
with last time due to a number of one-off benefits enjoyed in the same
period of 2002 and exchange rate movements since.

Some analysts had been worrying that a weakening dollar could wipe out
the growing benefits feeding through from its US acquisitions such as
Niagara Mowhawk and New England Electric but the company's trading
statement suggests this will not so.
