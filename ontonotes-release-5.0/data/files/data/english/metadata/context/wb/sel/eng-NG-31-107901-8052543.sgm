Are these usable in any kind of radio/audio gear? I
have maybe a dozen or so of these for sale if there is a use for them.
They were part of some things I grabbed from a telephone microwave relay
station that was being done away with. Actually have some other oddball
tubes, thermal relays inside a vacuum tube enclosure and other odd stuff
if anyone is interested. Can take and upload pictures of the stuff too.

I believe Andre Jute has several projects that use this tube, including
his &quot;potato&quot; single tube amplifier.

Just be careful of Mr. Jute's designs. They are accompanied by much
fluff and flash, pomp and circumstance as well as massive
pontifications... but to-date, none have been proven to work as
supplied.

Better you should take a design either directly from Mr. Byrns, or
have him edit Mr. Jute's design such that it will not deliver you more
smoke than sound.

Keep in mind that _anything_ with the OEM WE logo on it carries
irrational magic amongst certain types, whether rational or
irrational. So undertand that the actual functionality and musicality
of the tube (if any different from any other) is only a minor factor
in its value. The *NAME* is the value, and NOS just carries that to
the stratosphere. So, exploit that to the maximum if you are so
inclined.

Before you sell anything to this dishonest peddler, check first with several
other places for their value. This guy will hustle you along with his
charlatan friend Wieck, who changed the subject of your post to try again
and again to slander a person whom he is very jealous of. It's sad, but in
this NG whenever there is a new poster, you will always find these 2
characters salivating from the notion of &quot;fresh meat.&quot; Like everything else,
be careful. You may have quite a value in your possession.

Gee Whiz, you little twit. I tell the guy that his tubes are worth a
bunch make no offers to purchase them (actually, my preference were I
to have such would be to sell them for the young fortune they will
bring and invest it in some actual working gear/tubes/time/designs)
and yet you blather libelously about honesty.

One would think that you are as irrational and unbalanced as your Lord
and Master. Are you also the victim of strokes at an early age?

I make no defense of Jon, of course. He is more than able to handle

Pest,

You've slandered and libeled me for quite some time without providing a
scintilla of proof that I've wronged anyone.  When asked to provide proof
you ignore the request or present a host of conditions that I have to meet
before you'll do it.

Why don't you put your money where your mouth is and make an offer to this
gentleman to buy his tubes.  Then you could build one of your idol's
&quot;designs&quot; and be oh so cool.

No, of course you never will.  You're too cheap and too full of shit.

I wish Mr Woot luck with getting rich out of 417A. Unfortunately for
him, and unfortunately for Worthless Wiecky's little bit of totally
misunderstood street corner gossip about its value, and unfortunately
for Yaeger the garage vermin's greed, 417A are the odd man out among
the WE tubes. First, WE wasn't the monopoly maker; others made 417A and
the 5842 is an *exact* twin, not just a workalike (an STC-type 4300B,
commonly called a 300B, is *not* precisely the same as a WE 300B, it is
merely a workalike). Second, there are absolutely a gazillion 417A out
there; the reincarnated WE advertised 417A for 350USD, presumably with
the idea of buying up all the stock and creating a monopoly; I imagine
they were defeated by sheer numbers. Third, the 417A has an elite niche
market following; unfortunately for traders, it is also a very
knowledgable elite in this niche, quite immune to the romance of the WE
name. Four, it is a tiny niche because the tube is difficult to work
with, and doesn't quite fit in any of the pre-amp categories, is not
two tubes in one envelope, and what it is good for is very specialized
indeed. Five, and most important, everyone knows WE didn't make the
best 417A; the best were made by Ericson of Sweden and distinguished by
gold pins. Finally, and devastatingly, the 417A has a major problem
with microphonics; there are so many around because everyone picks them
over for the non-microphonic ones. All of that accounts for the fact
that the 417A is a cheap WE tube. What is expensive is a WE417A
guaranteed non-microphonic by a known-good expert, which is why I give
a selected pair sometimes to tubies whose relentless rationality, deep
knowledge and good manners I approve of.

If the usual garage vermin and veteran radio wreckers think I am wrong,
they  can buy Mr Woot's tubes for whatever price he wants,
and then try to resell them to the traders reportedly asking
42 and 90USD -- if those traders actually have customers waiting, they
will pay between a third and half those amounts for new stock, or
simply to take a competitor off the market. If they make a derisory
offer, they have no customers for WE417A at those prices and are simply
trying to puff up a market out of thin air.

The last time I bought 417A I paid, including packaging and postage and
international phone calls to set the deal, less than six dollars each;
the day after they were delivered I was offered a box full, already
selected for being non-microphonic, for the cost of the postage by a
guy who loved their sound but couldn't get the hang of them in DIY
amps.

Maybe if Mr Woot's are in very clean WE boxes, he can sell them in the
Far East as display pieces rather than tubes to be used. I once got a
matched quad of 300B and a pair of super 845 in exchange for five dirty
old trashed Mullard EL34 in a trade with a Japanese trader, who told me
he had an order for Mullards to be on show on top of an amp, working
condition not essential.

The 417A can possibly be worth a lot of money, so place them on e-bay
or on a website for sale at what is the going rate is for second hand
417A.

Its used in preamps and is one of a few types of high transconductance

Thanks for the info. I'm not out to make top dollar as any amount would be
profit since as mentioned above I grabbed these tubes along with a whole
other slew of tubes and gadgets from a microwave telephone relay station
that was being torn down back in 1992. I do however want a fair price and
maybe Ebay with a reserve price is the answer.

Its extremely unlikely that the gear was decommissioned soon after being
re-tubed.
That would be luck indeed.
But ancient old tubes that are maybe 5,000 hours old are never worth
much.

But the 417A has cult status, and much flatus has been spoken about its
wonders,
so maybe you get 20 bucks each.......

The 417A makes a jolly nice little one-tube amp for sensitive speakers
(the kind that comes free of charge out of trashed tube radios) and at
a reasonable plate voltage too, so the power supply can be cheap. See
'Minus Zero'  at
