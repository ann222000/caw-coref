It seems like the Phillies are getting a lot more attention for losing
10,000 games than the Giants got for winning 10,000.  I wonder if it's
because the Giants split time between New York and San Francisco, so
people don't think of them as one team, or if the media is just more
comfortable reporting a negative story.

That's an excellent question.  And 10,000 losses is a dubious &quot;dishonor&quot;
anyway...  I mean, if their 125 year history was like 125 years of the Devil
Rays' record, it would be, but this is a team that has won 7 divisions, 5
pennants, and a World Series.  Yeah, they've had more than their share of
piss-poor seasons, but losing 10,000 is mainly a function of being one of
the longest-lived franchises in league history.

Last season when the Astros went above  .500 for all games played since
their first season in 1962, it was really a big deal.  There were quite a
few articles written about it and a countdown a few days before it happened.
It was portrayed as a much bigger deal than it actually was.

It has something to do with being a long lived franchise, but also a
lot to do with being a bad one for much of its existence.  The
Phillies are not an especially young franchise as the NL goes; the
Braves, Cubs, Reds, Cardinals, and Pirates are all older, and the
Giants are the same age.  Of the pre-expansion NL teams, only the
Dodgers are newer- and by just one season.  The Phillies were the
first to 10,000 losses because their record is easily the worst of any
of the old NL teams.  The Phillies have a team winning percentage of
.468, and the next worse is the Braves at .499.  That means that the
Phillies have averaged 5 more losses per 162 game season than any
other NL team, which adds up over the equivalent of over 116 full 162
game seasons.

And it's not just the old NL teams that have played better than the
Phillies.  All of the 8 original AL teams have better overall winning
percentages, as do all of the expansion teams except the Rangers,
Rockies, Padres, and Devil Rays.  The Rangers (.467), Rockies (.466)
and Padres (.463) are only marginally worse than the Phillies; the
Devil Rays (.398) are the only team in MLB history that's
substantially worse.

For your enlightenment, here are the records of the pre-expansion
teams (in order by first season, with ties broken by record):

Per 162 Decisions
Team     First Season      W      L   Pct      W      L
Cubs             1876   9948   9426  .513   83.2   78.8

I think it surprised a lot of people that the Phillies got there
before the Cubs, not just because the Cubs had a head start, but
because the Cubs have the lovable loser persona, while the Phillies
have been good more often than not for the time within memory for most
of us.  We forget (or never knew) that the Cubs were usually good in
the 19th Century and up through the first half of the 20th, while the
Phillies were usually awful during that time.

It's also kind of strange to think of the Giants as the winningest
team ever, when they haven't won a World Series in San Francisco, and
people old enough to remember the New York Giants probably remember
them as the third best team in New York.

The key thing about the Giants is that they're the only one of the old
NL teams that never sucked for an extended period.  They've never had
more than 4 straight losing seasons, while every other old NL team
went at least 9 straight at one time or another.  Simply avoiding that
level of suckage makes a huge difference in their long term ability to
rack up wins.

Well, yes and no.  The oldest franchises are the eight teams that were
in the National League before the expansion of the 1960s.  Two of
these eight pre-date the National League:  the Braves were founded in
1871 (with the Red Stockings nickname) and the Cubs date to 1874 (as
the White Stockings;  an argument can be made for an 1870 date, but
they didn't play 1872-1873, following the Great Chicago Fire, but 1874
is solid).  The other six all date to 1882-1884 as major league
clubs.  This is slightly obscured by the fact that several of them
played in the major American Association before jumping to the
National League.  The Phillies and the Dodgers each played a year as
non-major league clubs before joining the majors.

So the upshot is that there are eight clubs with as good or better a
shot at reaching 10,000 first.  The actual number is irrelevant.  It
only arises because people are impressed by numbers with lots of
zeros.  But the record of losingest team is achieved honestly.

Not all that surprising.  The Cubs are one of the two oldest
franchises, and had periods when they were a powerhouse team.  Even
over the last half century or so the futility of the Cubs was not that
they were consistently bad.  It was that they were never quite good
enough to make it.  They were in second or third place in their
division six years in a row, from 1967-1972.  This can be even more
frustrating that absolutely sucking, but the wins add up in the long
run.
