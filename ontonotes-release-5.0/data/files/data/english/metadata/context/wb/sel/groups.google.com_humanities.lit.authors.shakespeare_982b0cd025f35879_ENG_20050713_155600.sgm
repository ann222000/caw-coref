Hamlet (1603 Q1) Act 1, Scene 2

Ham.: Thrift, thrift, Horatio, the funerall BAK'T MEATES
Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables,
Would I had met my deerest foe in heauen
Ere EUER I had seene that day Horatio;
------------------------------­----------------------------
Romeo and Juliet Act 4, Scene 4

CAPULET: Look to the BAKED MEATS, good Angelica:
Spare not for the cost.
------------------------------­----------------------------
Titus Andronicus (1594 Q) Act 5, Scene 2

TITUS ANDRONICUS:
VVhiles that Lauinia tweene her stumps doth hold,
The BASON that receaues your guiltie blood.
You know your Mother meanes to feast with me,
And calles herselfe Reuenge and thinks me mad.
Harke villaines I will grinde your bones to dust,
And with your blood and it Ile make a PASTE,
And of the PASTE a coffen I will reare,
And make two PASTIES of your shamefull heades,
------------------------------­----------------------------
THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR Act 1, Scene 1

PAGE: Come, we have a hot VENISON PASTY to dinner: come,
gentlemen, I hope we shall drink down all unkindness.

Exeunt all except SHALLOW, SLENDER, and SIR HUGH EVANS

SLENDER: I had rather than forty shillings
I had my Book of Songs and Sonnets here.

Enter SIMPLE

How now, Simple! where have you been?
I must wait on myself, must I?
You have not the Book of Riddles about you, have you?

SIMPLE: Book of Riddles! why, did you not lend it to Alice
Shortcake upon ALL-HALLOWMAS last, a fortnight afore MICHAELMAS?
------------------------------­----------------------------
Epicoene - Ben Jonson

G: Why, SWEET master TRVE-WIT, will you entreat
my cousin OTTER, to send me a cold VENISON PASTY,
a BOTTLE or two of wine, and a CHAMBERpot.
------------------------------­------------------------------­-
_Ivanhoe_ - Sir Walter Scott

&lt;&lt;If thou knowest EVER a good lay, thou shalt be welcome
to a nook of PASTY at Copmanhurst so long as I serve
the chapel of St Dunstan, which, please God, shall be
till I change my GREY coVERing for one of GREEN TURF.&gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt;After exchanging a mute glance or two, the hermit went to
the farther side of the HUT, and opened a HUTch, which was
CONCEALED with great care and some ingenuity. Out of the
recesses of a dark closet, into which this aperture gave
admittance, he brought a large PASTY, baked in a pewter
platter of unusual dimensions. This mighty dish he placed
before his guest, who, using his poniard to cut it open, lost
no time in making himself acquainting with its contents.&gt;&gt;
------------------------------­-----------------------------
A Christmas Carol: A light shone from the window of a HUT,
and swiftly they advanced towards it.

Walden: The MASON who finishes the cornice of the palace
returns at night perchance to a HUT not so good as a wigwam
------------------------------­------------------------------­

Dan. hytte, Sw. hydda; and F. HUTte, of G. origin;

&lt;&lt;Joe, the mussel-man, lived in a tiny HUT by the edge of the
water under the bridge. This old man was marvelous at making
things. I nEVER saw a man so clever with his hands. He used
to mend my toy ships for me which I sailed upon the river;
he built windmills out of packing-cases and barrel-staves; and
he could make the most wonderful kites from old umbrellas.&gt;&gt;
