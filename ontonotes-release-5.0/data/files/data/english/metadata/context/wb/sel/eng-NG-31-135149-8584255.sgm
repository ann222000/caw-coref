Hi, I have an iBook G4. I just got a 80 gig La Cie Mobile external mobile hard drive.
I have 3 choices of connectors: fire wire with a round cylinder midway, USB with a round connector on the other end , or a USB with with some sort of round cylinder built into the cord, midway, and a regular rectangle connector on the end.
The user manual does not show this USB cord with the round cylinder. Neither does the quick install guide. So, I'm wondering which connector to use.? The guy at the Mac store just told me to plug in the connector and click on the icon on the desktop. Hmmmm.? Which of the 3 connectors?

Any experience or advice is appreciated.
Jocelyn

FireWire is definitely faster than USB2.  I have never seen a firewire cable
with one of those round things on it before.  But I am pretty sure that just
helps to eliminate energy spikes in the cable.  I wouldn't worry about it.
But for backing up, it will go the fastest and use less CPU with FireWire
than USB.

Hi,
Firewire is much faster. A couple of caveats. The Lacies plastic case
ext drives, have been having issues and failures. Also, if it does
not have the
Oxford chipset 911 or 912, it will not work as a &quot;bootable&quot; drive.

In any case, for backing up use the app called Super Duper, from
here: http://www.shirt-pocket.com/SuperDuper/SuperDuperDescription.html
Super Duper is the only one which gets all the bits &amp; pieces, despite
what some say. More info on why it is better than CCC. too: see these
articles: http://blog.plasticsfuture.org/2006/04/23/mac-backup-
software-harmful - Which plainly describes the faults of CCC and many
other backup apps. - In fact, only SuperDuper succeeded in actually
saving all the data to the backup. and more at macWorld: http://

This isn't correct.

Almost all Firewire drives are bootable. The ones that aren't
bootable are really rare, especially if they're newer models. I have
booted successfully with drives that use: Oxford, Initio, Indigita,
Prolific, LSI Logic, TI, and VIA chipsets, as well as unidentified
chipsets shown in System Profiler as Maxtor and Seagate (this is set
by custom the firmware they use, and isn't the real manufacturer of
the chipset, which would have to be visually inspected to determine
the maker).

The only chipset I've ever used that wouldn't boot was the early
Prolific PL-3507 Rev.A used in the Ultra Mini Disk and other older,
and very inexpensive enclosures. Also, Genesys Logic chipsets can
boot, but they are designed wrong and have an error that  will
corrupt data on any Firewire connection - Mac or PC - they should
never be used, and be recycled rather than resold.

Thanks for the various information about external back up drives. This
one is metal. It's a LaCie Mobile Hard drive designed by F.A. Porsche.
It has SilverKeeper Backup Utilites for Mac OS X.
It' s unclear to me at this point as to it's bootability. Maybe I

It's definitely bootable, all Lacie drives are bootable - I'm booted
right now from a Lacie F.A. Porsche Firewire HD.

If it's new, don't worry about the firmware, but if it's a few years
old, you might check the Lacie Firmware updater, or check in System
Profiler&gt;Firewire for the firmware revision, it should be revision
1.02 for a 911+ or 922 chipset, and revision 4.00 for an older 911
chipset. Either the Lacie or the Oxford firmware updater can update
these enclosures.

Well, then, I guess the two USB2/FW drives with Prolific PL-3507
chipsets are both the Rev A, both  a 3.5 Ultra case from TigerDirect
and a 2.5 acomdata drive from CompuUSA. Call me just plain unlucky
then. It is nearly (or exactly) impossible to determine the chipset or
bootability before buying, unless it happens to be declared by the
manufacturer. I have tried everything to get these suckers bootable to
no avail, on 4 different mac platforms. The startup disk panel will
find them, but the disks are not polled during the startup cycle. They
do not get displayed on bootup with option key. I have come to realize
that getting a firewire-only case with a oxford chipset is probably the
only nearly-guaranteed path to a bootable external drive. I won't trust
any other case.

Burned twice, and upset,

under firewire... only usb.  Very bad chipsets.
As for the bootable backup, you could also use Carbon Copy Cloner, that is
what I have always used... and the new beta version allows you to make
periodic backups of only the files that have changed.

You can secure your backup, but it will not be bootable.  In CCC just go to
advanced and tell it to make a disk image on the target volume.  it then
allows you to put a password on that disk image.

also, if you select &quot;prepare for ASR&quot; then you can break the image down into
chunks of the size of your choosing for burning on to DVD's or anything.

Good Luck,
Jeff

Jeff, according to this CCC does not get all the bits &amp; pieces copied
which SD does accomplish.

I have never seen this document before, but speaking from personal
experience... CCC is all I have ever used to back up my computer.  Which I
do often because I reformat often.  I have never had a problem after doing
it.  I have never used super duper, so i can't speak for or against it.

I am skeptical of an article posted as a &quot;blog&quot; that has many claims
against all cloning tools EXCEPT SuperDuper (SD). If you read the
reasons that different products are given failing marks, and then
research this yourself, I think you'll find this author's claims are
not credible.

For example, in the critique of Carbon Copy Cloner (CCC) one of the
claims against CCC is that &quot;creation dates&quot; are not preserved. I have
a HD cloned with CCC and also have the original. I searched through
both drives comparing creation dates, and found zero instances in
which a creation date was not preserved. I believe this claim about
not preserving creation dates with CCC to be untrue.

Further, some of the metadata attributes are not even functional, for
instance, ACLs (Access Control Lists) which every single cloning tool
other than SD fails to preserve are not even used in any current OS X
System, and to be utilized at all must first be &quot;enabled&quot; for each
volume. To my knowledge, none of us would have these &quot;enabled&quot;, so
this is a total red herring. I'm also skeptical of the claim that
these aren't preserved by other tools, but since I do not have these
enable, and they aren't being utilized, I have no way to confirm my
suspicion.

I think the blog article claiming how much better SD is than all
others is likely disinformation, and close scrutiny of the claims
will show that for the most part they're false. That's not to say
that SD isn't a good tool. All that I'm saying is that the claims of
the author either appear to be false in some instances, or not
relevant to producing working, bootable, functional clones.

Whenever I read extraordinary claims, I expect extraordinary
evidence. When the evidence appears to be lacking, I cynically fall
back on the premise of &quot;who benefits&quot; and &quot;follow the money&quot;. In this
case, Super Duper benefits, and Super Duper gets the money, so that's
two strikes against Super Duper. The false claims in the article seem
to be a third strike, so even if Super Duper is indeed the very best
cloning tool, I recoil from the blog article that slants the truth so
heavily in favor of Super Duper.

My reality is that I've produced perfectly functional clones using
both CCC and Disk Utility, which are both free, and to my knowledge
I've never experienced any shortcoming that was cited in this biased,
misleading, and perhaps purposefully untruthful blog article.

I have gotten successful, bootable clones with CCC and Disk Utility
as well. I moved over to SuperDuper at a time when CCC development
was lacking (no CCC updates since 2003 - a while ago - though there
are beta versions if you dare). I used it free when all I wanted was
straightforward cloning. But eventually I wanted to do &quot;smart
updates&quot; which save time by updating only files changed. That is a
feature I gladly bought SuperDuper ($27.95) to use. CCC is actually
shareware/donationware at a very affordable price of $5 (please
support them).

So - you can try out and use SD free if you want to get bootable
clones. Those who are new to backing up or cloning their HDs may find
SDs user interface more inviting.

Since we're on the subject --

Can anyone compare these to DataBackup? I already have this, and use
it quite successfully for basic backup maintenance. However, I plan
to buy a Pismo in the near future -- in which case, I'll probably
want to clone my Lombard's disk contents onto the Pismo. There is a
cloning feature in DataBackup, but now I'm wondering -- will it be
reliably bootable? Or would it be worthwhile for me to invest in
SuperDuper instead?

Use CCC.  It is free and you have several testimonials saying that it has
worked on many occasions to image OSX from one computer to another.  The
problem you face with a lombard to pismo copy is that the lombard has no
firewire and no firewire target disk mode.  But that will be a problem with

Thanks Jeff.

Fortunately, I think I already thought of a better idea. ;-)

I keep the Lombard backed up to an external USB drive. I don't really
*need* a bootable clone of the Lombard. All I need to do is to
perform a custom restore from the USB drive to the Pismo, leaving out
the system files.

Giving myself a big duhhhhhhhhhhhhhh....
