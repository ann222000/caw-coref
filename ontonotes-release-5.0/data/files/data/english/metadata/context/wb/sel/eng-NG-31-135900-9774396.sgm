Hi,

The end of the year always sees all kinds of lists appearing. The top
10 movies at the box office or the top 10 selling cars of the year
etc. I tend to find these lists amusing mostly because there's always
one or two items in there for which you go &quot;nah, can't be, there's no
way people were stupid enough to watch *that* movie or to buy *that*
car.

Yesterday, while looking for a particular article in The General I
came upon something I had forgotten entirely : Avalon Hill used to
publish a list of their top-sellers each year and also a cumulative
all-time best sellers list. So we're back in 1985 - it's almost the
end of the AH era - which game do you think heads the list of their
all-time best sellers ? Is it Squad Leader ? Is it Diplomacy ? Is it
Third Reich ?

Nope, it's &quot;Outdoor Survival&quot; , followed by &quot;Facts in Five&quot; on the
number 2 spot. In fact 8 out of the top 20 games are not wargames at
all. An accountant looking at this would conclude that their hit rate
with non-wargames was higher than their wargame hit rate ...

Ok, so what were their 3 top selling wargames then ? Surely the ones
mentioned above ? Again, this is a bit surprising but the top-3
wargames were Panzerblitz, Panzer Leader and Tactics II - all entry
level wargames.

Surprising ain't it ?

Now, the reason AH made this public is probably because gamers like to
know what other gamers are playing. It influences their buying
decision as they get confirmation a game for which they've been
sitting on the fence is a hit. People are more willing to spend money
on something if they know lots of other people are buying it too. &quot;&lt;X&gt;
items sold already&quot; remains a powerful marketing slogan.

So, question : do you think it would be a good idea for wargame
publishers to publish such a top-10 list ? And would it influence your
buying decision ?

Greetz,

Eddy Sterckx

Is it?  There are always more students in CS101: INTRO TO PROGRAMMING
than in CS520: COMPILER DESIGN.  That's the nature of introductory vs
advanced materials.  If we made a Venn diagram of AH wargame buyers and
their purchases, THIRD REICH would almost certainly be a small circle
99% inside a bigger circle representing PANZERBLITZ.  I mean, who bought
TR without already owning PANZERBLITZ?

I'm also not very surprised that the non-wargames were more popular with
the gaming public; just yesterday, I used up some gift cards and bought
BIOSHOCK, GEARS OF WAR, and SOLDIER OF FORTUNE: PAYBACK.  Not a wargame
among them.

Maybe Matrix should start offering gift cards.

You're looking at it too rational :)

If wargame developers would look at it this way, wouldn't we see more
Advanced Tactics games and less War in the Pacifics ?

What I mean is : when I go over the list of wargames published this
year there are just a few &quot;introductory&quot; level wargames, but a high
number of medium level and even monster games.

Isn't that a bit silly from a sales pov ?

&lt;raises hand&gt; - I got them in reversed order :)

&lt;sigh&gt; It has been suggested in here before. *every* wargame outfit
should have a big red button on their main webpage saying &quot;wargame
widows, buy a voucher here&quot;. A multi-publisher, multi-genre store like
NWS would profit from this enormously.

Vouchers may look like dumb gifts, but for me they aren't - my hobby
is too specialized for someone else to guess what I'd like or not, so
vouchers make a lot of sense.

The &quot;loot&quot; I got this X-Mas included 3 vouchers, 2 of them from a
military history bookstore run by a single guy who - according to the
one I got it from - told him he sells a truckload of them each year to
wives looking for a present for their hubbies.

I already planned when I'm going to visit his bookstore - and I'll
probably end up buying twice the amount of the value on those
vouchers.

There's no way vouchers aren't a great idea and neglecting to
implement it in your webshop borders on the criminal.

&lt;end of pro-voucher rant&gt;

http://www.dekrijger.com/home.html

That single html page is their entire website. It's a bookstore which
has nothing but military history books. 30K different titles crammed
into several floors of a small warehouse and connecting rooms, looking
a bit like the library in &quot;The Name of the Rose&quot;. Last time I went I
spend about $200 there - it's a wargamer's dream. I know I can get
most of these titles through Amazon, but I like to leaf through a book
first to see if the level of detail and general style is to my liking
- something which you can't do on a website.

Not really.   When I glance at the annual list of top-sellers in PC
games and see titles like &quot;Deer Hunter&quot; or &quot;Barbie Does
'Something-or-Other'&quot; at or near the top of the list, year after year,
the idea that *my* values aren't very popular is reinforced.  That's
clearly true in the general category of PC games and I suspect it's
also true in the specific category of wargames.  I enjoy huge,
time-consuming strategy games like War In the Pacific and Third Reich,
and experience has taught me that my avid interest in such games is
shared by just a small minority of gamers.  Sure, I can also enjoy a
tactical slug fest and even indulge an occasional juvenile
shoot-em-up, but I can spend *years* with games like WitP and not
exhaust their entrancing possibilities.  I recognize that not many
people will find 'fun' in that kind of thing.

I often find myself taking the opposite tack.  If a game is a top
seller, I tend to be skeptical about its value.  I'm aware that my
attitude may cause me to overlook some very good games, so I try to
evaluate a game without regard to its popularity.  In other words,
popularity alone does not spark my interest but tends to have an
opposite, off-putting effect.

&gt; publishers to publish such a top-10 list ? And would it influence your
&gt; buying decision ?

It's a good idea, though they might want to hide the actual number of
units sold because such tiny numbers might embarass them!

Avalon Hill didn't give the actual numbers either, just listed the
games in sales order. But there was a minimum of 100K games sold to
get on the All Time List.

For wargames today it might indeed be embarassing to be compared to
those numbers :)

Not really surprising for me, but probably for most.  Though &quot;Outdoor
Survival&quot; was 'dual-use'.  It was used by quite a few D&amp;D DMs for
outdoor campaigning rules so it had an unexpected second market there.

I think if we released our sales numbers for all games released to
date there would be quite a few surprises there for the average forum
poster.  We value our active community members very highly but there
is also most certainly a &quot;silent majority&quot; that doesn't necessarily
share a grognard's list of favorites.

Hey Jim Dunnigan did one in 1969 called &quot;Up Against the Wall,

Might I add in this context that my favorite issue of MOVES magazine
was the one where they were talking about the development of Sniper!
which was the first game featuring individual counters for soldiers.
Players in that game were either erect or prone which affecting who
they could see and who they could be seen by. Apparently SPI was in
the habit of reading their rules aloud to their playtesters which is
how &quot;Erect men may expose themselves&quot; got changed to &quot;Self-Exposure by

25 years later I still remember this - which is a pretty good sign of
