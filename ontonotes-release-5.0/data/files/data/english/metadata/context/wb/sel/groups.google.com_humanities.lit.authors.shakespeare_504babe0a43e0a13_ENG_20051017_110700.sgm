Memoirs of Popular Delusions Vol. 3 by Charles Mackay

&lt;&lt;Astrology was the means whereby he lived, and he continued to
practise it with great assiduity; but his heart was in alchymy. The
philosopher's stone and the elixir of life haunted his daily thoughts
and his nightly dreams. The Talmudic mysteries, which he had also
deeply studied, impressed him with the belief, that he might hold
converse with spirits and angels, and learn from them all the
mysteries of the universe. Holding the same idea as the then obscure
sect of the Rosicrucians, some of whom he had perhaps encountered
in his travels in Germany, he imagined that, by means of the
philosopher's stone, he could summon these kindly spirits at his will.
By dint of continually brooding upon the subject, his imagination
became so diseased, that he at last persuaded himself that an angel
appeared to him, and promised to be his friend and companion as long
as he lived. He relates that, one day, in November 1582, while he was
engaged in fervent prayer, the window of his museum looking towards
the west suddenly glowed with a dazzling light, in the midst of which,
in all his glory, stood the great angel URIEL. Awe and wonder rendered
him speechless; but the angel smiling graciously upon him, gave him a
crystal, of a convex form, and told him that, whenever he wished to
hold converse with the beings of another sphere, he had only to gaze
intently upon it, and they would appear in the crystal and unveil to
him all the secrets of futurity. [The &quot;crystal&quot; alluded to appears to
have been a black stone, or piece of polished coal. The following
account of it is given in the Supplement to Granger's &quot;Biographical
History.&quot; -- &quot;The black stone into which Dee used to call his spirits
was in the collection of the Earls of Peterborough, from whence it
came to Lady Elizabeth Germaine. It was next the property of the late
Duke of Argyle, and is now Mr. Walpole's. It appears upon examination
to be nothing more than a polished piece of cannel coal; but this is
what Butler means when he says,

'Kelly did all his feats upon The devil's looking-GLASS -- a stone.'

This saying, the angel disappeared. Dee found from experience of
the crystal that it was necessary that all the faculties of the soul
should be concentrated upon it, otherwise the spirits did not appear.
He also found that he could never recollect the conversations he had
with the angels. He therefore detERMINEd to communicate the secret to
another person, who might converse with the spirits while he (Dee) sat
in another part of the room, and took down in writing the revelations
which they made.

He had at this time in his service, as his assistant, one Edward
Kelly, who, like himself, was crazy upon the subject of the
philosopher's stone. There was this difference, however, between them,
that, while Dee was more of an enthusiast than an impostor, Kelly was
more of an impostor than an enthusiast. In early life he was a notary,
and had the misfortune to lose both his ears for forgery. This
mutilation, degrading enough in any man, was destructive to a
philosopher; Kelly, therefore, lest his wisdom should suffer in the
world's opinion, wore a black skull-cap, which, fitting close to his
head, and descending over both his cheeks, not only concealed his
loss, but gave him a very solemn and oracular appearance. So well did
he keep his secret, that even Dee, with whom he lived so many years,
appears never to have discovered it. Kelly, with this character, was
just the man to carry on any piece of roguery for his own advantage,
or to nurture the delusions of his master for the same purpose. No
sooner did Dee inform him of the visit he had received from the
glorious URIEL, than Kelly expressed such a fervour of belief that
Dee's heart glowed with delight. He set about consulting his crystal
forthwith, and on the 2nd of December 1581, the spirits appeared, and
held a very extraordinary discourse with Kelly, which Dee took down in
writing. The curious reader may see this farrago of nonsense among the
Harleian MSS. in the British Museum. The later consultations were
published in a folio volume, in 1659, by Dr. Meric Casaubon, under the
title of &quot;A True and Faithful Relation of what passed between Dr. John
Dee and some Spirits; tending, had it succeeded, to a general
Alteration of most States and Kingdoms in the World.&quot; [Lilly, the
astrologer, in his Life written by himself, frequently tells of
prophecies delivered by the angels in a manner similar to the angels
of Dr. Dee. He says, &quot;The prophecies were not given vocally by the
angels, but by inspection of the crystal in types and figures, or
by apparition the circular way; where, at some distance, the angels
appear, representing by forms, shapes, and creatures what is demanded.
It is very rare, yea, even in our days,&quot; quoth that wiseacre,
&quot;for any operator or master to hear the angels speak articulately:
when they do speak, it is like the Irish, much in the throat!&quot;]

Two superNOVA pertinent to Shake-speare/Oxford's life/death.
[Tycho &amp; Kepler recorded these NOVA from the island of Hven
just a few miles south of Elsinore castle.]
----------------------------------------------------------------
Sweet swan of AVON! What a sight it were
To see the in our water yet appear,
And make those flights upon the Thames,
That so did take Eliza and our James!
But stay, I see the in the Hemisphere
Advanc'd and made a Constellation there!
Shine forth thou Starre of Poets, and with rage,
Or influence, chide or cheer the drooping stage;
Which since thy flight from hence, hath mourned like night,
And despairs day, but for thy Volumes light.
----------------------------------------------------------------
Tycho's NOVA: November, 1572 in Cassiopeia.
Five months after 'Elizabeth' executed Oxford's
beloved cousin, the Duke of Norfolk.

[Cassiopeia was the Ethiopian Queen who boasted that
she and daughter Andromeda were more beautiful than
the Nereids. Andromeda had to be sacrificed to the sea
monster Cetus to appease Poseidon but was rescued
by Perseus. Cassiopeia then tried to stop Perseus from
marrying Andromeda but Perseus turned her to stone
with the evil eye (Algol/1572 nova?) of Medusa.
Poseidon made Cassiopeia a constellation that
would turn upside down every six months.]

The Nov. 1572 nova transformed Cassiopeia into a crooked
cross or small Cygnus/swan constellation.
----------------------------------------------------------------
Kepler's NOVA: October, 1604 southwest of Ophiuchus/Serpens.
Four months after Oxford himself &quot;died&quot;.

[Ophiuchus was Asclepius/ son of Apollo by unfaithful wife
Coronis. Asclepius learned the healing arts from Chiron
&amp; angered Hades by granting virtual immortality with the
blood of Medusa. Zeus struck Asclepius with a thunderbolt
but Asclepius achieved his own immortality
as a constellation carrying a caduceus.]

The Oct. 1604 nova (&amp; nearby Jupiter &amp; Saturn) transformed
Ophiuchus/Serpens into a new constellation that very much
resembled a large Swan taking off from S.West horizon just
over the setting sun (in Scorpius). It was a phoenix like
symbol ( perhaps carrying English language &amp; culture
across the Atlantic to the New World in the South West).

The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle - translated by James Ingram

A.D. 678. This year appeared the comet-star in August, and shone
every morning, during three months, like a SUNBEAM. Bishop
Wilfrid being driven from his bishopric by King Everth, two
bishops were consecrated in his stead, Bosa over the Deirians,
and Eata over the Bernicians. About the same time also Eadhed
was consecrated bishop over the people of Lindsey, being the
first in that division.

Apocrypha

Wis 16:26 That thy children, O Lord, whom thou lovest, might know,
that it is not the growing of fruits that nourisheth man: but that
it is thy word, which preserveth them that put their trust in thee.
Wis 16:27 For that which was not destroyed of the fire,
being warmed with a little SUNBEAM, soon melted away.

Don Quixote by Cervantes - Translated by John Ormsby
( PART 1 - CHAPTER XIV )

Where Father Tagus rolls, or on the banks
Of olive-bordered Betis; to the rocks
Or in deep caverns shall my plaint be told,
And by a lifeless tongue in living words;
Or in dark valleys or on lonely shores,
Where neither foot of man nor SUNBEAM falls;
Or in among the poison-breathing swarms
Of monsters nourished by the sluggish Nile.

( PART 2 - CHAPTER XXVI )

Are there not almost every
day a thousand comedies represented all round us full of thousands
of inaccuracies and absurdities, and, for all that, they have a
successful run, and are listened to not only with applause, but with
admiration and all the rest of it? Go on, boy, and don't mind; for
so long as I fill my pouch, no matter if I show as many inaccuracies
as there are motes in a SUNBEAM.&quot;

Moby Dick - Melville

&quot;Don't be afraid, my butter-boxes,&quot; cried Stubb, casting a passing
glance upon them as he shot by; &quot;ye'll be picked up presently- all
right- I saw some sharks astern- St. Bernard's dogs, you know- relieve
distressed travellers. Hurrah! this is the way to sail now. Every keel
a SUNBEAM! Hurrah!- Here we go like three tin kettles at the tail of a
mad cougar! This puts me in mind of fastening to an elephant in a
tilbury on a plain- makes the wheelspokes fly, boys, when you fasten
to him that way; and there's danger of being pitched out too, when you
strike a hill. Hurrah! this is the way a fellow feels when he's
going to Davy Jones- all a rush down an endless inclined plane!
Hurrah! this whale carries the everlasting mail!&quot;

JOYCE: Ulysses, Nestor

I have seen it Coming these years. As sure as we are standing here
the jew merchants are already at their work of destruction.
Old England is dying.

He stepped swiftly off, his eyes coming to blue life
as they passed a broad SUNBEAM. He faced about and back again.

-- Dying, he said, if not dead by now.

The harlot's cry from street to street
Shall WEAVE old England's winding sheet.
His eyes open wide in vision stared STERNLY
across the SUNBEAM in which he HALTED.

Apocrypal texts give more complete accounts of the fall of the angels.

1 Enoch gives an account of the fall of the Angels from heaven.
Chapter 6 talks of how the angels saw and lusted after the daughters
of men.

&quot;In those days, when the children of man had multiplied, it happened
that there were born unto them handsome and beautiful daughters. And
the angels, the children of heaven , saw them and desired them; and
they said to one another, 'Come, let us choose wives for ourselves
from among the daughters of man and beget us children.' And Semyaz,
being their leader, said unto them,'I fear that perhaps you will not
consent that this deed should be done, and I alone will become
(responsible) for this great sin.' But they all responded to him, 'Let
us all swear an oath and bind everyone among us by a curse not to
abandon this suggestion but to do the deed.' Then they all swore
together and bound one another by (the curse) And they were altogether
two hundred;&quot; - 1 Enoch 6:1-7

The angels descended on Mount Hermon during the days of Jared. There
were 19 leaders mentioned in 1 Enoch, who were also called 'the chiefs
of ten.' Once they reached the earth:

&quot;they took wives unto themselves, and everyone (respectively) chose
one woman for himself, and they began to go unto them. And they taught
them magical medicine, incantations, the cutting of roots, and taught
them (about) plants. And the women became pregnant and gave birth to
great giants whose heights were three hundred cubits. These (giants)
consumed the produce of all the people until the people detested
feeding them. So the giants turned against (the people) in order to
eat them.&quot; - 1 Enoch 7:1-5

The Angels then taught women charms, enchantments, the cutting of
roots, and the knowledge of plants. They taught men how to make
various weapons and armor, and also arts and sciences. These acts led
to an increase in lawlessness and warfare. The men of earth then cried
out to heaven, and the 4 archangels (Michael, URIEL, Raphael, and
Gabriel) cried out to God. In response, God sent URIEL to warn Noah
that there would soon be a flood that would destroy the wickedness on
earth.
