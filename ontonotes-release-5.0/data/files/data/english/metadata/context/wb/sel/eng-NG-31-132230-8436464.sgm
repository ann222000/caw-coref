...given that they've started all the others with something
completely unexpected, even utterly confusing.

OC season 1 had to start with something new - but what a start!
Protagonist wakes up in a jungle, shaking his head, obviously
momentarily dazed and unaware of who or where he is.
Then feet running by, sounds of panic emerging, and finally
out on to the beach where we see it was a plane crash.
WOW!   Great audience-grabbing start!

Then the racing around, pregnant woman, people with massive
wounds, and my favourite cameo-scene of all time - the guy
sucked into the engine and blowing it up!
____

People have remarked much on the WOW start of season 2.
And it was also astounding.  We start with this guy doing
his morning exercises, listening to music etc, seemingly
inside a normal city flat.  We are wondering...  what the hell?
- have I accidentally tuned into the wrong program? -
this isn't Lost!

Then OC comes the BANG! - we are back in the scene,
and a classic armed stand-off ensues.  GREAT START.
And the new character turns out to be one of the most pivotal
ones, almost as much as our season 1 first character did.
______

So, to season 3.  This has been much less remarked on,
but was also dramatic in a eerie kind of way.  We have
this totally new character, Juliet, holding a book group
and arguing nit-picking literary points with the others.
Fooled once again!  Here we are wondering what the hell
kind of sit-com we've stumbled into, and just before we
can change the channel, suddenly there's Benry;
and before we can acclimatise to that, an earthquake
(apparently) starts up, but rushing outside we see
an airliner starting to crack up.  AHA - now we know
the score, again.   Phew!   Again, emergency plans
break out and we are well under way!
____

Well, that's three doozy starts.  Now doozy starts are no rarity
in action films and series, but these were extra doozy.

COMMON FEATURES:

1) complete lack of understanding of where we are;
2) immediate introduction of a pivotal new character;
3) race into new, unexpected action that presages the major plotlines.

The producers are unlikely to change a winning formula;
so what lies in store for us for season 4, I wonder?

Who is the new character going to be?  Well obviously if
he's new, we can't know!  But it may be someone we've
been hinted at - such as Jacob would be a good bet.
Howbout a flashback of a fully earthly Jacob, explaining
at least part of how he got to be where/what he is?
Or would that give away to much too early.  Probably.
But there's always Alvar Hanso - or even Magnus!

We want a new character that introduces a complete new
story line, as Jack, Des and Juliet did.

So - give us your best guesses - how will they start S4???

For S2 and S3 something to do with the new character had been partially
introduced already, ie the hatch and the others and how they are not quite
as they seemed.  Therefore I think that the new character will be someone
off Naiomi's ship.

I think it will be Danielle flashback episode, it will start out on a
ship, the captian says, &quot;we just received a distress call, lets set a
new course&quot;,  we are supposed to think its Naomi's rescue ship but
then it shipwrecks and we see the pregnant Danielle stumbling out of
the wreckage. Cue Lost music and graphic.

Right, a fakeout teaser, just like Season 2 (we were looking at Swan)
and season 3 (we were looking at The Others' camp).

My guess is for 4.01, another fakeout teaser, such as:  We see Jack
driving around Los Angeles and entering St. Sebastian Hospital, looks
pretty well dressed, no beard.  Goes about his rounds as a surgeon,
maybe operates on a patient.  And only later do we realize it's not a
flashback, but a flashforward from just after he and Kate got back to
the States.  Maybe just before the title &quot;LOST&quot; comes on the screen,
Jack will take his 2004 model cell phone out of his pocket and call Kate
with it.

Like they did in Season 1, 2 and 3.

Somone's Eyeball than their surroundings.

Season 1 - Closeup of Jack's Eye
Season 2 - Closeup of Desmond's Eye
Season 3 - Closeup of Juliet's Eye

Season 4 - Closeup of Micheal's Eye?

Yes, that'd be a good one.  He'll wake up looking disoriented like
Jack in season 1, but worse.  Possibly in New York.

I don't think so ...
It's always a new character that highlights what the season revolves
around ...
Flight 815
The Hatch
Otherville

So it will be someone off the &quot;rescue&quot; ship ... or in the flash
forward ...

Well thank you, wise ancestor of wise Pooh-Bah!

It's always nice to be appreciated.  And, in answer to the query,
I think that Will Bradshaw, well backed up by &quot;number6&quot;
(who I think has too much spare time on his hands),
has hit on the by-far-most-likely answer - it's going
to be someone (who we don't yet know) off Naomi's ship,
whom season 4 will largely revolve around.  We may yet see
those north-polar guys again!  Oh no - they were Penny's guys.

And OC, as Les Labbauf says, it will start with a close-up
of his eye.  Maybe looking down a magnifying glass at a map
or a meter - scientific type.

Thanks for all your help, guys, I think we've got it licked now!
I wonder if the authors are reading all this for new ideas...  ;-)

As much as I don't like Michael...  If the episode started with
Michael waking up on a bed in some unusual place, that would leave a
lot of opportunities for surprises.

Maybe Danielle wakes up in a little cot in a treehouse and we discover
that it's 2007 and she's giving nature tours for a living in Orlando,
Florida  :-)

The more I think about it, the less I think they can pull the &quot;fakeout
teaser&quot; a THIRD time.

Of course, they could do it once.  And then, while you might believe
they would do it a second time, they could still surprise you a little
bit with it.

But this third time, I think a lot of fans will be watching the
opening with a strong eye toward expecting that what they're seeing
somehow isn't &quot;real.&quot;

By the way, haven't they done this sort of fakeout in other,
non-premiere episodes?

Ben's flashback started in such a way that we might think it was on
the island.

Did Juliet once have a flashback that started in a room that could
have maybe been on the island but turned out to be an airport?

Did the Bai Ling thing start with shots that looked like they might
have been on the island?

The basement or hallway of her sister's apartment building (where she
passed Ethan) looked like some of the underground passageways used by
the Others on the island.  When she pulled open the curtains in
Rachel's apartment, we saw the Miami skyline.

Compare S03E07 (first minute) and S03E13 (last minute, the
corridor before the room where Cooper is imprisoned) -
they actually used the same location.
