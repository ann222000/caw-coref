Work from Home: Real Money Advantages
Copyright Â© 2005 J. Kenneth Ezra
How To Create Online Millionaires

One of the greatest and most rewarding endeavors you may adopt is
working from home. Not only do you get to set your own schedule,
you are blessed with spending time with your loved ones and/or
your loved activities. I can't tell you how to put a dollar
amount on it. But it's probably like this: $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$.

We are talking about time. Time is the most important factor
when you compare working from home versus working a regular 9-5
job. If you hate the day-to-day grind of working a normal job
and you never worked from home you are missing out on one of
life's treasures. It is so limitless only you know what you
would do with it. I personally enjoy 3 mile walks with my wife
and dog Rixy (the fastest Whippet around). Oh, to be perfectly
honest I love golfing with my friend at his country club. The
best time to go from 11am to 3pm, if you add the commute times it
really takes the WHOLE day. But you what? Time doesn't matter
because I make my own schedule. I work from home.

However, time is a non-money advantage. Let's look at some of the
real money advantages to determine if working from home is for
you. Always weigh your options before making any decision
regarding your finances. We will look at some of the required
actions needed to work from home in my next article.

Some Real Money Advantages: per year

1. NO MORE COMMUTE! You SAVE the GAS money: depending on the
vehicle this is probably between $$-$$$ per month. $$-$$$$

2. You SAVE the Wear and Tear on your vehicle. Many people
don't take this factor seriously but it is serious and costly
if you're not factoring it in. Most cars cost at least .25 cents
per mile (runs .50 cents to $1 per mile Mercedes AMG). These
can surface in repairs or depreciation (i.e.: $25,000 2002
new car price minus current value 2005 $17,000 = $8,000
depreciation). If you add the repairs and upkeep during those
years for a vehicle in good working order (average $1000 per
year includes, brake pads, regular oil changes, unexpected
expenses etc). That's $11,000 loss for three years. $$$-$$$$$

3. Ever get a TRAFFIC Ticket because of your commute to and
from work? $$-$$$

4. Does your current employer penalize you for being late?
$$-$$$

5. Auto accidents. Not all of us get into one. But those
that do lose money on deductibles, and higher rates. $$$-$$$$

6. Insurance companies usually charge more money for longer
commutes. $-$$$

7. Cost of inflation. Historically between 4-10%. This means
everything costs you more, but rarely do job hourly and salary
keep up. You see this every time you go to the grocery store, or
buy your next car, or car wash etc. Suddenly it feels like you
have less money. Trust your instinct or listen to an economist,
you do have less money by stores, services etc raising their
prices simple translation: inflation. If you own a property
this will help but beware. If you don't own a property,
inflation could really hurt. $-$$$$$

8. No need for lunch money. $$$-$$$$

9. No need for new wardrobe or keeping wardrobe clean. $$-$$$$

Some Non-Money Advantages: (just a few)

1. No more boss! You make your own decisions, rules, and
disciplinary actions. Not someone else. This is really great if
your current boss has those notorious suppressive anti-social
characteristics and it all seems directed at you.

2. More time to work on your own earning power. Most
employees are helping their employer make money. But at the end
of the week do you even have time to send a resume or go on an
interview for better opportunities? Or read up on other systems
to make money? You'll see how difficult it is to focus and read
and experiment etc. There are more complicated ones. Who has
time for that?

3. No day-to-day grind. You may love the grind but it is a
true relief when you don't HAVE to. You'll make up your own
grind working from home. Based on your likes, dislikes and
strengths.

4. Time to work out. Time for 3 mile walks. TIME to study
money making systems. Time for networking. Time for higher
education.

5. Efficiency. You won't spend time cleaning up other peoples
mess-ups at work. This really hurts you. It diminishes your
self esteem to know that during your normal work day you spend
time fixing the problems other people create. This doesn't even
help you and seldom does anyone acknowledge it. It may be the
ethical thing to do to help the company. But when your own
work suffers. When you have to stay longer than scheduled.
It intrudes your own personal integrity to your family and
yourself.

When you work from home you actually get more efficient.

for further information.

6. Independent Thinking. When you are an employee you are
affected by a herd mentality. You may not realize how other
people you encounter everyday give you wrong data. This then
gets filed in your brain and you start operating on it.

The list can go on and on. Number 6 is my favorite. I'm going
on my eighth year working from home. As I get good information,
good education and apply solid principles I see great results.

I'm running an experiment on the newest information marketing
website turnkey system. The system advertised the typical
promises: &quot;help you make money from home with very little money,
time and offers plenty of solutions that can cover most of your
knowledge deficiencies.&quot; A current example to show anyone who is
interested about home based turnkey systems: view an experiment
system. See the bank statements to view how profitable or not so
profitable.
