I have a question about how you would enter the pattern for this particular
airport, and the AIM seems kind of vague in this area.

I will start with "Yes, enter the downwind on a 45..." as that is pretty
obvious, but my question is more about how you would overfly the airport to
observe the windsock and wind tee, and then turn away from the airport to
manuever for the 45.

Here is the scenario:

You are flying from say Boeing Field (BFI) to Bremerton National (PWT), and
are planning on landing at PWT and thus are approaching PWT from the East.
PWT is an untowered field and there is a single runway at PWT (1/19).  It is
a Right hand pattern for Rwy 1, and left hand patter for Rwy 19 (i.e.
traffic pattern is always to the east of the airport, and kept away from the
west side of the airport).  I want to overfly the airport at TPA + 500' to
observe the wind tee and traffic in the pattern, even though I did listen to
the ASOS and am listening to the CTAF.  Also, there is a NOTAM for parachute
jumpers, 1/4 mile west of the airport, 2 mile radius.  WindTee and segmented
circle are on the northeastern part of the airport.  This is a very real
scenario, and not a "simulation" scenario.  The main concern is staying away
from the westside of the airport where the parachute jumpers may be.  I know
they will annouce on the CTAF when the are getting ready to depart the plane
and when they actually do depart the plane, but it would be best to avoid
the west side of the airport.

How would you overfly the airport and then turn to mauever for the 45 entry
to downwind?

I know a lot people at this airport will just listen to the ASOS and enter
the 45 from 5 miles out without overflying the airport, but that doesn't
always give me the safest feeling in the world.

Even though I maybe public chastised as "You are doing it totally wrong",
here is what I have been doing...  I obviously self-announce what I am doing
on the CTAF starting about 10 miles out.  I will overfly the active runway
at TPA + 500', and then midfield make a 90 degree turn toward the downwind,
maintaining TPA + 500', and once I am passed the downwind to where I can
enter on a 45, I will start a descent and an appropriate turn to enter the
downwind on the 45, and the rest is the typical untowered pattern stuff.

It also seems that commonsense would tell you that if Rwy 1 is the active,
you should overfly the rwy from South to North (same direction as the
traffic) vs. the other way around, but if you are TPA + 500' does it really
matter.  When I asked my instructor, his response was "As long as you are at
least TPA + 500' and not interfering with traffic, it doesn't matter...
just keep an eye out for traffic...", which seems to be basically what the
AIM says, although people in the pattern may not particularly like you for
it.

Just curious what your guys' thoughts are. They don't call it "license to
learn" for nothing.  :-)

*Why* would you overfly the airport?  In this scenario, you've got wind
information from the ASOS, and you've got the active runway from listening
to the traffic.  What additional information would you hope to gain by
overflying the airport?

Any traffic you might observe will be very different by the time you've
maneuvered away and then back to downwind.

The ASOS should give you wind information that's as good as the wind sock.

You can observe the runway and surrounding area while you're on downwind.

What other value might you get from overflying the field?

What are you worried about?  If you're not feeling safe, you should look
at what's causing that feeling, but this seems a reasonable approach.

I do commend you for not wanting to overfly the airport in the usual way
-- the patterns are presumably on one side exactly because of the jumpers
on the other side, so flying through that would be a high-risk way to
approach the airport.  Personally, I'd just as soon not even be right over
the runway as you describe, in case some of the jumpers aren't exactly
where they should be.  Downwind is close enough -- no need to tempt fate
and fly even closer.

looking for traffic that may not have a radio or are not broadcasting which

for them anyway.

I guess I was also under the impression that you should always overfly the
airport, observe the traffic, and then enter the pattern, that and my
instructor pretty much drilled it into my head.

Just one of those things I guess, where when you learn flyout of a towered
field like Boeing Field or Renton, and don't go to many untowered fields,
you get a little uncomfortable with the untowered fields, even though you
know what you are supposed to do.  I have been more and more untowered
fields purposely to get more comfortable with them.

I think the patterns were that way before the jumpers started there... I
believe they moved everything east because of some questionable terrain on
the west side of the airport, at least that is what I heard.

What if the jumpers were NOT there...  would you still execute the same
approach from the East?

Do not over fly an airport when you are entering the pattern unless
you have to join the pattern on the other side or if you can not get
any information on the radio.  When you over fly the airport your are
putting yourself into a high traffic area far longer than necessary
and coming from the pattern side you just might find some going the
other way to join the pattern.

And as Wade said, stay away from the jumpers.

Well, yes, you should be on the lookout.  I'm just not sure that
overflying the pattern will help you enough, since it'll change in the
time it takes you to turn around and join the pattern.

If you're coming from the other side of the field, or if you need wind
information, then that's the way you should do it.  It's not mandatory,
though, and creates additional risk.

Yes.  I trained at a towered field as well, and was always interested in
reading about people who trained at untowered fields.  I figure their
discomfort with talking with ATC is about the same as I had when going to
an untowered field.

Oh.  That makes sense.  Makes life easier for the jumpers, since their
side of the runway is always clear.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Even without jumpers, I'd still only overfly the field if I were coming
from the West, or if I needed to see the wind sock (or had some other
reason for looking at the runway from overhead).

If all airplanes over fly such an airport at TPA + 500', from
all different directions, the situation can be  more chaotic and
mid-air prone. Maybe that is why the concept of a "traffic pattern"
was created. Of course if there is no traffic for the airport (such
as a private field), there is no need to even have a traffic pattern.
just go straight in from any direction, from any altitude. [The
smoke from the living room chimney  will tell the wind direction.]

Thinking about it more, maybe the join-downwind-on-the-45 practice
should be done at the first possibility, in all feasible situations ---
if one already has the wind information from ASOS, If this sounds too
dangerous due to high volumn of traffic, other alternatives must be
worse.

The ruleless state at TPA + 500' is quite unnerving..  Now I think
if I must over fly the field, I'll do TPA+600'.. I'll call out for you
people
who are 100' below, near the middle of the runway. "plane from
east is converging with plane from west of airport at mid field above
runway,  I'm 100' above both of you, suggest to enter pattern in
male female formation."

When I instructed out of BFI, Wade, I took my students to Kitsap,
Snohomish, Auburn, Thun Field, Apex, and now-defunct airports at
Bellevue and what we called the pig farm east of Kent. Port Orchard,
now private, was home to a branch of Seattle flight Service, Inc., and
it got its share of training flights. Hard for me to understand why
your instructor kept you so close to "home." Towered airports form a
small percentage of the total number of landing sites.

The situation at PWT hasn't changed since those days, except for the
addition of the ASOS...we made do with Unicom. Crossing the pattern
above pattern altitude doesn't make much sense to me. The wind sock is
visible from a decent distance, and it seems that there are almost
always planes in the pattern. You're almost always going to be coming
from the east and entering on the appropriate 45 at pattern altitude.
