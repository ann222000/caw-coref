Hey everyone. I suspect I suffer from (subclinical?) Pernicious Anemia
and I am taking 5,000 mcg of combined methyl and cyanocobalmin. I
split this sublingual tablet into 4 parts and dissolve 2 parts twice a
day under my toungue for 30 minutes. I sometimes swallow the liquid
that accumulates under the toungue. I have read this method of B12
absortion is just as good as shots. So I am doing it since jan 18.
Also as per Skippers suggestion I am taking folic acid powder I bought
from seltzer chemicals in 1994. Does folic acid have an experiation
date? Is sublingual folic acid a good idea or is folic acid easy
absorbed??? I believe my underactive thyroid and or a genetic
predisposition toward PA is a causative factor as well as poor diet.
So I am curious to know what Skipper thinks and open for other
comments as well. Thanks so much.
J.d.

1) folic acid tends to be easily absorbed.
2) tests by US military showed most drugs will remain safe and potent
for many years if stored properly.  AFAIK folic acid does not tend to
decompose.  Provided you stored it in a cool, dry place, it is likely
just as good as when you bought it.

Drug expiration dates are dates required by law in most countries
which
indicate a date BEFORE which the drug is guarenteed safe and potent
by the manufacturer.  Drugs past their expiration dates are typically
still
safe and effective, with a few exceptions.

Thyroid hormones tend to lose potency in storage, even if stored
properly,
and the synthetics are MUCH more prone to this potency loss than is
Armour (tm) or other dessicated thyroid preparations.

If the folic acid is badly discolored or has obvious mold then discard
it.
Otherwise if it looks unchanged and smells unchanged, it is probably
just fine.

Thanks for the info. I live in Phoenix Arizona and I have kept it in
my garage in a closed box. So it has been exposed to warm temp but it
looks just like when I purchased it.
