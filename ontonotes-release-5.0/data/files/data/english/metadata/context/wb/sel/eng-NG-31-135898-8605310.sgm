I know it hasn't been a long time since 4.0, but it seems I accidentally
broke Romero's quest while making him return to the cemetery afterwards,
and there is some confusion because at the moment the unofficial patch and
the &quot;true&quot; patch have too similar version numbers (also I'm through with
the Bioshock demo and will wait a bit before getting the full game because
of the activation/autopatch issues and my good old dial-up connection ;).
So for a quick fix to both issues download the latest version 4.1 from
http://www.Patches-Scrolls.de in a little while or right now from:

http://files.filefront.com/vtmbup41rar/;8419446;;/fileinfo.html

Changelog:

v4.1               28.08.2007
----
Put morphine into cs cabinet and fixed a Danielle Persuasion error.
Added a humane farewell line to Heather and fixed a Tourette loop.
Lowered hacking skill of Asylum computers and swapped Copper lines.
Made police investigate gallery crime independent of your actions.

Prevented Humanity from reaching zero and removed loss for pendant.
Fixed parking garage exchange and removed gum when sold to Copper.
Corrected a Vandal condition and several similar dialogue problems.
Repaired broken Romero quest return and several minor text issues.

You know, this isn't helping those who install one of your patches, gets
a decent way through the game and then suddenly another version comes
out, so they have to start again for consistency sake.

You need not to start over with each new patch. After all most changes are
noticable to Bloodlines specialists only anyway right now ;). But because
of the broken quest I was asked to release early.

For all people who don't care about killing zombies in a graveyard in the
first place 4.0 should work out fine :)!

Werner, is it possible to install 4.1 on top of 4.0 without any
problems (and, generally, any previous version of your patch), as long
as you overwrite all files?

It should be possible and I always test the game that way but some people
claimed that continuing earlier saved games sometimes results in strange
things, like all hub NPCs being Vampires and similar. You may just try it
and restart from scratch only if something like this happens to you.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Yes. The &quot;loss&quot; was a humanity loss, because I assumed that giving it to
Jeanette would result in the ghost being stuck for eternity in the hotel.
But recently I noticed that when you convince the sisters to work together
the pendant reappears so a humanity loss early on isn't justified anymore.

Oops, my fault. I'm so used to the patches that I omitted it in the

Ah - I finished that very quest last night, in fact. :) Yes, I was a
bit confused about the quest; it seems to be there were 2 parts - (a)
returning the pendant to Jeanette and (b) helping the ghost. It's not
clear at all that (a) also results in (b) being completed.

In fact, once I recovered the pendant, I spent some time wandering
around the hotel wondering what to do, since I could still hear the
moans/shrieks of the children and presuming that quest was not done
until they stopped. I'm guessing now that the shrieks are just
background noise and continue no matter what you do!

I ended up reuniting the sisters, but didn't notice any humanity loss
_or_ gain, but possibily I just missed it.

You needed to return the pendant to _Therese_ which explains it like that
&quot;Rumor is that a personal item of a ghost's may be used to draw it out or
excise it from its haunt.&quot; and she wants to use the pendant to &quot; remove a

If you ended up reuniting them you didn't gave the pendant to Jeanette so
you wouldn't have got a humanity loss anyway.

Oops, sorry, yes, I did return it to Therese. To summarize:

* I talked to Jeanette; didn't give her the pedant but agreed to slash
up the gallery (but didn't steal the money)
* Getting telling off by Jeanette, told to go to diner; meet thugs,
kill them, go back to the Asylum, talk crazy sister into not killing
each other

When I check my quest log, the Spiritual one is marked as completed,
with the script saying that the ghost is at peace. So it seems you can
return it to Therese _and_ reunite them? So at some stage, the pendant
must have been taken from me and given to Therese? I'm a bit confused
of the chronology myself; I might replay through that part to see what
happens when.

No.

&quot;a personal item of a ghost&quot;

OR

&quot;a ghost's personal item&quot;

the  appended 's  in English generally is accepted shorthand for
&quot;belonging to&quot; or &quot;attached to&quot;

If I was as good at German as you are at English, I would be a very
pleased person indeed.

Er, why a &quot;rar&quot; file for 4.1 and not your usual .zip files ????

Wouldn't it make more sense to lose humanity for giving the pendant to
Jeannette, and gaining a humanity for reuniting the sisters?

(Oh yeah, and didn't Jeannette throw it into the ocean? Should it
reappear at all?)

That's the way it was before 4.1, but you can't really know what Jeanette
would do with the pendant and if you reunite them, it turns out she was
only teasing Therese when she claimed she had thrown it into the ocean. I
changed the quest log to reflect that a bit using &quot;allegedly&quot; in it.

This happens rather inconspicuously in your answers when she blaims you

&gt; &gt; return it to Therese _and_ reunite them? So at some stage, the pendant
&gt; &gt; must have been taken from me and given to Therese? I'm a bit confused

&gt; This happens rather inconspicuously in your answers when she blaims you
&gt; for slashing the paintings: &quot;I swear I didn't do it! I even brought you
&gt; the item from the Ocean House, here.&quot; or &quot;At least I got your damned item
&gt; from the Ocean House! Here, take it!&quot; dependent on your Persuasion stats.

I guess that must have been it!

On a tangent, is there a character/saved game editor that allows me to
change the stats of my character? I made a few choices earlier I
realise were wrong and wanted to change them. I know I _could_ just
use console commands to bump up some stats, but that's outright
cheating - I just wanted to tweak some stats up while lowering others
accordingly.

There is no editor and I don't know why it wouldn't be cheating using one.
If you just want to balance your changes, you can do this with the console
as well: &quot;vstats sell feat/discipline/etc&quot; gives the xp back and &quot;vstats
buy feat/discipline/etc&quot; uses xp to increase a stat. That would be fair.
