&quot;That Pavarotti - a divorced man who had a child out of wedlock - was given
public viewing and a funeral in the cathedral spurred some debate here. A
Modena parish priest, the Rev. Giorgio Bellei, told Corriere della Sera that
the move amounted to &quot;profanation of the temple.&quot; Other critics noted that
last year the church refused to grant a religious funeral to a paralyzed man
who had a doctor disconnect his respirator.&quot;

Indeed, every Christian always has the option of confessing &quot;grave
matters of conscience&quot; directly to Jesus, even up to the last moment
of physical life. The presence of a priest is not mandatory. Even the
Catholic Church itself concedes this fact in its official theology.

I also believe the official institutional support of the archbishop
and the Pope count for a great deal in this matter. Their spiritual
and liturgical support could only be a helpful benefit. If they
believed Pavarotti were a truly wicked person, they would not have
given him a Church funeral. Would Hitler -- who committed suicide --
ever have been granted a Church funeral, short of his repenting of the
Holocaust, which is something he apparently never did? I seriously
doubt it.

I've also been thinking about the curious social dynamics of this
Usenet group. By my informed estimation, perhaps 30% of the regular
contributors are Anglicans or Episcopalians -- while the remaining 70%
are very conservative Roman Catholics, Orthodox Christians, or
American Christian Fundamentalists of one-or-another stripe.

Does anyone have any credible theory as to why it's mainly RELIGIOUSLY
CONSERVATIVE NON-ANGLICANS who patronize this Episcopal newsgroup? Is
it a motivation which stems from their &quot;Evangelical&quot; sense of mission?
Or are they simply bored with their own ideologically-stagnant
newsgroups?

Michael, I'd make just one slight amendation in your last sentence:

&quot;People believe what they [want to] believe, and debate goes nowhere.&quot;

Indeed, you've just described the conundrum of this newsgroup in a
nutshell. These arguments are protracted (and quite frankly
pointless), because nobody will ever be blasted away from the
fundamental tenets of their own internal experience of religious
faith. It's a very private and very personal experience -- like
falling in love. Nobody else can mediate such an experience for you,
or specify the terms on which you are &quot;allowed&quot; to have faith. The
attempt to modify somebody else's experience of faith is fruitless and
pointless. Hence all of the silly tire-spinning which makes this
newsgroup so &quot;screechy&quot;.

On the subject of Pavarotti's competence to receive a Christian
funeral, here's an account of what Archbishop Cocchi himself said to
the mourners:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------
That Pavarotti - a divorced man who had a child out of wedlock - was
given a public viewing and a funeral in the cathedral spurred some
debate. A Modena parish priest, Rev. Giorgio Bellei, told the Corriere
della Sera daily newspaper that the move amounted to &quot;profanation of
the temple.&quot;

Other critics noted that last year, the Catholic church in Rome
refused to grant a religious funeral to a paralyzed man who had a
doctor disconnect his respirator.

Funeral director Gianni Gibellini said Bellei should have &quot;kept his
mouth sewn shut&quot; and that the Modena bishop had approved Pavarotti's
funeral plans.

Cocchi appeared to address the issue, saying, &quot;Pavarotti, with a faith
that he never repudiated or hid and which he expressed consistently
with his singing, is no stranger in this cathedral.&quot;
--------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------

Amen, and well-said by the Archbishop. His words rightly manifested
Jesus' very own forgiveness and caritas.

(Apologies if multiple replies to this post appear -- I am having
browser problems.)

First and foremost, the only requirement for posting to any newsgroup
is to remain on topic

I, for one, follow and post to this newsgroup because I recognize some
of the regular posters here (and many Anglicans) as brothers and
sisters in Christ, who have infinitely more in common with me than
they do with you.

This notwithstanding, you are also free to continue posting here as
long as you remain on topic -- even when your posts amount to
repudiations of the creeds and other formularies to which your church
still supposedly subscribes.

I speak for myself only.

As to theology, I am liberal to radical. Charles Hohenstein has
figured this out, but no one else seems to. True, I am a social
conservative, but most evangelicals combine social conservatism with
liberal theology. (When I say 'liberal' I don't mean political or
social liberalism, but theological liberalism.)

As to Anglicanism, I have posted on this before, and I won't repeat
myself. Let's just say that I have a great deal of sympathy for TEC/AC
for a number of reasons having to do with liturgy, doctrine,
personality, and approach in general.

As to posting to this particular newsgroup, I have posted regularly to
a number of other newsgroups. Most of the ones I have frequented have
been inhabited by self-centered, immature know-it-alls. For two
examples, read comp.lang.perl.misc and soc.history.what-if for a
while. By comparison (and all things are relative),
alt.religion.christian.episcopal has a larger proportion of mature
thinkers. We actually have occasions where people apologize for
mistakes and change their mind, which in my experience is unusual for
NGs in general. We also have a number of people who have an education
(in a broader sense) and can discuss issues intelligently.

I miss Hugh Beyer, Leslie Terrell, Elbert Wall, tdancer, Priscilla
Balleau ... I even miss Louis, and that's a stretch.

As to the topic of this thread, I am critical of the RC church for its
top down structure. I don't see the Church as a heirarchical structure
dominated to one man or a small group at the top marching to the same
drummer, but as a community of saints self-organizing for ministry,
witness, and worship in ways that are appropriate for specific tasks,
cultures, and needs. I find the idea that a priest, whether a parish
priest or the pope, can speak for the church incongruent with the Way
(see Acts.) Different congregations minister in different ways to
different sets of people, and I don't have a problem with one
congregation refusing buial to a divorced man and another congretation
memorializing him.

As to the ordination of one cohabiting with his lover, I will be very
vocal opposing it, but I certainly recognize the right of discrete
groups to do these things. My 'weapons' are reason, logic, ideas,
facts, and doctrinal authority. If these fail, then I will concede
defeat.

Michael, it is truly unfortunate that it is the issue of sexuality,
rather than the newl belief-system(s) which gave rise to it, that
presently threatens to divide the Anglican communion. This has
effectively &quot;muddied the water&quot; and it has hurt people of good will
like yourself.

Your church's challenge is to determine whether it can continue to
make room for those who hold to a more traditional understanding of
its faith; otherwise, some might say, it may end end up &quot;stifling
freedon of religious thought&quot; and &quot;shoving its perceptions down their
throats&quot;.

The &quot;nitty-gritty&quot; is the problem -- is their a way that you can (and
should) continue to co-exist within the same church? Is the
traditional &quot;comprehensiveness&quot; of Anglicanism important enough that
the liberals who now run the show should try to find room for those
who disagree with them but wish to remain Anglican?

To be brief, in all you say you seem to infere that you know what God
wants and I do not,   Wrong.

Unfortunately you speak from your level of consciousness (as everyone
does)   But there's a BIG difference between what God wants and what you
think He wants.  Everthing you say is your INTERPRETATION, and therefore
inaccurate.  God will reveal  to you those things that are neccessary
for YOUR life, not everyone elses. My understanding is for  my life and
not yours. Both are equally valid. I do not put down yours, kindly cease
to put down mine, That is the beginning of peace.

Bad idea. If we follow your idea of structure, then we will have
thousands of different doctrines and dogmas all over the place, that
are contradicting each other.

A true to life case is what we have now in the Protestant world. How
many denominations are there, thousands? If so, then the Protestants
also have thousands of differing doctrines/dogmas that contradict each

As a Roman, but hardly a &quot;very conservative&quot; one, I will give the answer I
gave when I first came here.  It is as you surmised.  The RC group lacks the
third leg of the stool, Reason.  I don't care whether Pavaarotti confessed
either to a priest or directly to God.  I'm not sure he had anything worthy
of confession.  The Italians -- having given us many Popes -- have always
been human when it comes to &quot;sex&quot;.  They do what comes naturally.  Of course
the worst of them then go to confession.  But most do not.  I like Latin
Catholicism and you will find it even among the Celts.  Good Catholics all.
Sexual austerity is &quot;Protestant&quot; -- a matter for the good Germanic-Saxon
folk!

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;values
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;of ancient peoples.  Many of the values which they wrote down and mixed
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;them in with   REAL spiritual truths.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;***Just keep in mind that Holy Scripture tells us that practicing
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;homosexuals will not inherit the Kingdom of Heaven. God is not
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;politically correct. god is not swayed by secular, humanistic social
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;trends. God set the trends, not society. Your fresh air may, indeed, be
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;an ill wind.

&gt;&gt;&gt;The text everyone quotes refers to male prostitutes.

&gt;&gt; ***Oh? Romans and Corinthians refers to prostitutes only? And this lets
&gt;&gt; lezzies off the hook? LOL!!

&gt;&gt;  Of course everyone,

&gt;&gt;&gt;like you, interprets it the wa you want according to your values.

&gt;&gt; ***Try God's values.

&gt;&gt;  That

&gt;&gt;&gt;does not make your intepretation valid, But I will not argue about
&gt;&gt;&gt;it..People believe what they believe and debate goes nowhere.

&gt;&gt; ***If one takes God's mandate literally, there can be no argument. The
&gt;&gt; problem comes when some people try to argue that God dfidn't mean what He
&gt;&gt; said.

&gt; To be brief, in all you say you seem to infere that you know what God
&gt; wants and I do not,   Wrong.

&gt; Unfortunately you speak from your level of consciousness (as everyone

Absolute unity of belief and action in the body of believers. The
church has had a history of sectarianism, factionalism, heterodoxy,
outright heresy, schism, and so on. I seem to recall that both
Agustine and Aquinas were at one point condemend of heresy. Both the

Why should the RCC claim to decide schism? There is absolutely nothing
in the foundational authority (scripture, creeds, and so on) that
gives any one denomination the right to decide what is a schism and
what isn't. The RCC's claim to determine schism is just as valid as
the Orthodox Church, or the Lutheran Church, or the Reformed Church,
or the Anglicans, Presbyterians, Methodists, Baptists, Pentacostals,
etc. Or the WTS, LDS, or SDA for that matter.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Indeed, every Christian always has the option of confessing &quot;grave
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;matters of conscience&quot; directly to Jesus, even up to the last moment
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;of physical life. The presence of a priest is not mandatory. Even the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Catholic Church itself concedes this fact in its official theology.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I also believe the official institutional support of the archbishop
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;and the Pope count for a great deal in this matter. Their spiritual
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;and liturgical support could only be a helpful benefit. If they
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;believed Pavarotti were a truly wicked person, they would not have
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;given him a Church funeral. Would Hitler -- who committed suicide --
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;ever have been granted a Church funeral, short of his repenting of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Holocaust, which is something he apparently never did? I seriously
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;doubt it.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I've also been thinking about the curious social dynamics of this
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Usenet group. By my informed estimation, perhaps 30% of the regular
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;contributors are Anglicans or Episcopalians -- while the remaining
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;70%
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;are very conservative Roman Catholics, Orthodox Christians, or
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;American Christian Fundamentalists of one-or-another stripe.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Does anyone have any credible theory as to why it's mainly
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;RELIGIOUSLY
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;CONSERVATIVE NON-ANGLICANS who patronize this Episcopal newsgroup? Is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;it a motivation which stems from their &quot;Evangelical&quot; sense of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;mission?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Or are they simply bored with their own ideologically-stagnant
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;newsgroups?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Inquiring minds want to know!

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;***I think some conservative Christians, like me, are trying to wake
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;up the Episcopalians who have yet to realize that there church has
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;sold out Christ to the gay/lesbian lobby. The idea of a male bishop
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;who dumped his wife to live with his male lover, despite the biblical
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;warning that such gay activity will lead one down the road to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;perdition, is offensive to some of us. There is an alternative to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Episcopalianism in Holy Orthodoxy.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;And there is an alternative to neanderthal values and bigoted
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;understanding ,(plus lame comments like we &quot;have to sold out Christ  -
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;nothing could be further from the truth) and it's the Episcopal Church
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;which opens the windows and lets in some fresh air that has stifled
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;freedom of religious thought, led by people with very narrow minds.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Although you and others will try  without success to shove your
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;perceptions down our throats.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;In the decades to come, the Epsiopal church will be renewed with many
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;new souls attracted by contemporary social values in place of the

Quite so, but I have noticed that Orthodox seem to consider that their

As as part of the True Church (whether you recognize it or not, and

This sub-thread is descending into silliness. What makes you think
that one group has a monopoly on the Truth? (Truth is a person, Jesus
Christ.)

The Church consists of all that belong to Jesus Christ. You seem to
have bought into the notion that men can form religious groups as if
they were social fraternaties and exclude God's children for any and
every reason.

In John, before his trial and execution, Jesus prayed for the unity of
the Church. He prayed for all that God had given him, not just a
select few that wore the right clothes and drank the right kind of
water.

I'll tell you this -- a sect that excludes a brother or a sister that
God has called, saying to him or her, 'You can't come in here and join
us at the communion table,' is not a church of Christ. And Lord knows,
there are plenty of these kinds of sects in existence today.

I'm willing to be proven wrong. If you think that I am wrong, don't
just call me a name, but tell me why you think I'm wrong.

Thanks, Ed. Hopefully this resolves the issue to everybody's
satisfaction -- including Jesus' as well...lol!

I'm reminded of a similar situation which arose with Frank Sinatra, a
few years before his death, when he was gravely ill with
diverticulitis -- which is what now apparently ails the Jesuit-
educated Fidel Castro, FWIW. Frank made his peace with the Catholic
Church (into which he was born) by willing a huge chunk of his
considerable estate to his home diocese in New Jersey, for its
charitable work. (My personal hunch is that for a contribution of this
size, the grateful bishop HIMSELF would likely travel to the man's
bedside, and quickly absolve him of any sin short of the attempted
assassination of a Pope...lol!)

In any case, Frank recovered, and returned to touring for several more
years. Upon his eventual death, as I recall, he was feted with full
Catholic honors (including a Requiem Mass) at his native parish church
in New Jersey, and buried in the parish cemetery, next to his parents.

Jesus obviously &quot;gets it&quot; concerning His Own proffered gift of
reconciliation and forgiveness for those who have been baptized. Such
a pity that some of the &quot;carping and stodgy Catholics&quot; don't.

Note about sex in Ireland: it's my understanding that the sexual mores
of most of today's Irish young people are now very close to those of
Scandinavian young people, for better or worse. Ireland's entry into
the EU, and a raft of priest sex abuse scandals (including the scandal
of a prominent Irish bishop who maintained a clandestine wife and
several children on the side!) virtually stripped the RCC of any moral
credibility it had on matters sexual.

People's waking up to the RCC's hypocrisy about human sexuality
certainly sounds like a step in the right direction to me.

to be the other &quot;churches of the Apostolic succession&quot;, TEC has shown
a cavalier disregard for those things that it claims to have in common
with them.

Thus we see a hierarchy populated (and in the case of TEC, headed) by
women whom TEC purports to have ordained to the Apostolic ministry. We
see sacramental marriage &quot;re-invented&quot; in such a way as to deprive it
of its essential content. The list goes on &quot;ad infinitum&quot;.

Any claims that TEC would now wish to make to &quot;Apostolicity&quot; are
simply laughable. This of course is most tragic for those remaining
faithful Anglicans who have been plunged into this mess through no
fault of their own.

You are touching on an important point here - i.e. the rapidity with
which the Protestant revolt degenerated into &quot;a misbegotten, hulking
pile of splinters.&quot;

It is simply disingenuous not to attribute significance to the sheer
breathtaking scale of this centrifugal &quot;splintering&quot; phenomenon.
Protestants reacted to this scandal with yet another doctrinal
novelty. The Church ceased for them to be a visible entity and instead
became exclusively a group of people known to God alone.

Sadly, it is no accident that this approach is very much in harmony
with contemporary individualism (to which Protestantism has made no
small contribution): &quot;I have accepted Jesus as my Lord and Savior,
therefore I am in the Church.&quot;

Yes. Roman Catholics and Orthodox Christians agree that there is One

If there isn't a lucky person, then we all get to make our own
