With elections on everyone's mind, and some elections happening next
week even, I though I'd have this one before the other ones.  Voters
in Flordia may have their votes disqualified by the Democratic Party
if the vote too early though.  Fortunately I'm counting the votes
instead of Diebold.

Vote Early and Vote Often.

Free comment, then specifically the nomination:

This is a lovely (well, you know what I mean) description
of a very common type.  I may well have spent more time
hearing people who describe themselves as purely rational
arrive at wildly different conclusions from each other than
people who claim to be reading the same text literally.
Where the latter says that only an evil person would disagree,
the former says that only an irrational person would disagree.
Given their respective usages, both groups are saying the same
thing.

&gt; &gt; &gt; OK, OK, I admit it, it was me.  The whole mess is my fault. Satisfied?
&gt; &gt; I knew it!
&gt; &gt; Alright, sister, listen up...we only have a few minutes to get ready for
&gt; &gt; the elohim. I want the straight dope, and fast! When you first came to
&gt; &gt; me, why did you want Marduk shadowed?
&gt; &gt; Don't tell me you thought he'd betrayed you, that's a lie! You knew
&gt; &gt; you had Marduk hooked! You wanted to kill him...before Jehovah came
&gt; &gt; with the loot so you wouldn't have to split it with him. Right? If he
&gt; &gt; knew someone was following him, he'd be frightened away.
&gt; &gt; You told Marduk he was being followed, right? Yeah, that's what I
&gt; &gt; thought.
&gt; &gt; Oh sure, you wouldn't have if you thought Marduk would kill him. I get
&gt; &gt; that. And if you thought he wouldn't kill Magyar, you were right.
&gt; &gt; Magyar hadn't many brains, but too much experience as a creator to be
&gt; &gt; caught by a deity he was shadowing up a blind alley with his lightning
&gt; &gt; bolt tucked away in his hip and his overcoat buttoned.
&gt; &gt; But he'd have gone up there with you, angel. He was just dumb enough
&gt; &gt; for that. He'd have looked you up and down, licked his lips and
&gt; &gt; gone...grinning from ear to ear. You could have stood as close to him
&gt; &gt; as you liked...and shot him with the bolt you got from Marduk that
&gt; &gt; night.
&gt; &gt; C'mon, the elohim'll be here any minute! Talk! It's not the time for
&gt; &gt; some schoolgoddess act! We're both sitting under the gallows! Now, why
&gt; &gt; did you shoot Magyar? How about this: You thought Marduk would tackle
&gt; &gt; Magyar and one would go down. If Marduk died, you were rid of him. If
&gt; &gt; it was Magyar, you'd see Marduk was caught. Right?
&gt; &gt; But when Marduk wouldn't tackle him you took his gun and did it
&gt; &gt; yourself, right? Then, when you heard Marduk was shot, you knew the
&gt; &gt; fat man, Pan Gu, was here! You knew you needed another protector,
&gt; &gt; somebody to fill Marduk's boots, so you came back to me.
&gt; &gt; Well, if you get a good break, they'll let you out of Gehenna
&gt; &gt; eventually...and you can come back to me then. I hope they don't hang
&gt; &gt; you, precious, by that sweet, spectral neck. Yes, angel, I'm gonna
&gt; &gt; send you over. The chances are you'll get off with life. If you're a
&gt; &gt; good goddess, you'll be out 20-30 years.

&gt; &gt; Alright, sister, listen up...we only have a few minutes to get ready for

&gt; &gt; Don't tell me you thought he'd betrayed you, that's a lie! You knew
&gt; &gt; you had Marduk hooked! You wanted to kill him...before Jehovah came
&gt; &gt; with the loot so you wouldn't have to split it with him. Right? If he

&gt; &gt; You told Marduk he was being followed, right? Yeah, that's what I
&gt; &gt; thought.

&gt; &gt; Oh sure, you wouldn't have if you thought Marduk would kill him. I get

&gt; &gt; Magyar hadn't many brains, but too much experience as a creator to be
&gt; &gt; caught by a deity he was shadowing up a blind alley with his lightning
&gt; &gt; bolt tucked away in his hip and his overcoat buttoned.

&gt; &gt; But he'd have gone up there with you, angel. He was just dumb enough
&gt; &gt; for that. He'd have looked you up and down, licked his lips and
&gt; &gt; gone...grinning from ear to ear. You could have stood as close to him
&gt; &gt; as you liked...and shot him with the bolt you got from Marduk that
&gt; &gt; night.

&gt; &gt; C'mon, the elohim'll be here any minute! Talk! It's not the time for
&gt; &gt; some schoolgoddess act! We're both sitting under the gallows! Now, why
&gt; &gt; did you shoot Magyar? How about this: You thought Marduk would tackle
&gt; &gt; Magyar and one would go down. If Marduk died, you were rid of him. If
&gt; &gt; it was Magyar, you'd see Marduk was caught. Right?

&gt; &gt; But when Marduk wouldn't tackle him you took his gun and did it
&gt; &gt; yourself, right? Then, when you heard Marduk was shot, you knew the
&gt; &gt; fat man, Pan Gu, was here! You knew you needed another protector,
&gt; &gt; somebody to fill Marduk's boots, so you came back to me.

&gt; &gt; Well, if you get a good break, they'll let you out of Gehenna
&gt; &gt; eventually...and you can come back to me then. I hope they don't hang
&gt; &gt; you, precious, by that sweet, spectral neck. Yes, angel, I'm gonna

BY the Democratic Party.  The Florida Democratic Party moved up it's
presidential primary, and the national Democratic Party told the
Florida Democratic Party &quot;if your primary is that early, none of your
delegates count.&quot;

Get with the times.  November 2000 was, like, seven years ago, when
both sides were disenfranchising each others votes.  This time they're
disenfranchising their own votes.

We had a low voter turnout, but we still have a winner on our hands:

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Can we ever find out?
&gt; &gt; &gt; OK, OK, I admit it, it was me.  The whole mess is my fault. Satisfied?
&gt; &gt; I knew it!
&gt; &gt; Alright, sister, listen up...we only have a few minutes to get ready for
&gt; &gt; the elohim. I want the straight dope, and fast! When you first came to
&gt; &gt; me, why did you want Marduk shadowed?
&gt; &gt; Don't tell me you thought he'd betrayed you, that's a lie! You knew
&gt; &gt; you had Marduk hooked! You wanted to kill him...before Jehovah came
&gt; &gt; with the loot so you wouldn't have to split it with him. Right? If he
&gt; &gt; knew someone was following him, he'd be frightened away.
&gt; &gt; You told Marduk he was being followed, right? Yeah, that's what I
&gt; &gt; thought.
&gt; &gt; Oh sure, you wouldn't have if you thought Marduk would kill him. I get
&gt; &gt; that. And if you thought he wouldn't kill Magyar, you were right.
&gt; &gt; Magyar hadn't many brains, but too much experience as a creator to be
&gt; &gt; caught by a deity he was shadowing up a blind alley with his lightning
&gt; &gt; bolt tucked away in his hip and his overcoat buttoned.
&gt; &gt; But he'd have gone up there with you, angel. He was just dumb enough
&gt; &gt; for that. He'd have looked you up and down, licked his lips and
&gt; &gt; gone...grinning from ear to ear. You could have stood as close to him
&gt; &gt; as you liked...and shot him with the bolt you got from Marduk that
&gt; &gt; night.
&gt; &gt; C'mon, the elohim'll be here any minute! Talk! It's not the time for
&gt; &gt; some schoolgoddess act! We're both sitting under the gallows! Now, why
&gt; &gt; did you shoot Magyar? How about this: You thought Marduk would tackle
&gt; &gt; Magyar and one would go down. If Marduk died, you were rid of him. If
&gt; &gt; it was Magyar, you'd see Marduk was caught. Right?
&gt; &gt; But when Marduk wouldn't tackle him you took his gun and did it
&gt; &gt; yourself, right? Then, when you heard Marduk was shot, you knew the
&gt; &gt; fat man, Pan Gu, was here! You knew you needed another protector,
&gt; &gt; somebody to fill Marduk's boots, so you came back to me.
&gt; &gt; Well, if you get a good break, they'll let you out of Gehenna
&gt; &gt; eventually...and you can come back to me then. I hope they don't hang
&gt; &gt; you, precious, by that sweet, spectral neck. Yes, angel, I'm gonna
&gt; &gt; send you over. The chances are you'll get off with life. If you're a
&gt; &gt; good goddess, you'll be out 20-30 years.
&gt; &gt; That's right, you're taking the fall. If they hang you, I'll always

&gt; In the &quot;How Do They Get Those Whites So Clean?&quot; Department

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Some scientists have argued that the sudden evolution of organisms
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; that produce oxygen by photosynthesis caused the Great Oxidation
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Event.
&gt; &gt;&gt; This is known as the first great die off.
&gt; &gt; Rocks absorbed the first bout of O2, forming iron oxides which
&gt; &gt; colored them red.  This is known as the first great dye off.

&gt; &gt;&gt; I think that he's saying that evolutionists get all the chicks. Which
&gt; &gt;&gt; is true of course.
&gt; &gt; Poor Ted Haggard.  Look what he ended up with.

&gt; ======

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;         b.  Is the bit stream complex?
&gt; &gt; &gt; define &quot;complex&quot;
&gt; &gt; Complex:  Having imaginary elements.
&gt; &gt; Ahhhh! That makes ID so much more understanable.

&gt; Nominated

&gt; ======

&gt; Okay, it's a bit juvenile, but I still think its funny.

&gt; &gt; Unknown word for America is *intelliquence* .

&gt; ======

&gt; Free comment, then specifically the nomination:

&gt;   This is a lovely (well, you know what I mean) description
&gt; of a very common type.  I may well have spent more time
&gt; hearing people who describe themselves as purely rational
&gt; arrive at wildly different conclusions from each other than
&gt; people who claim to be reading the same text literally.
&gt; Where the latter says that only an evil person would disagree,
&gt; the former says that only an irrational person would disagree.
&gt; Given their respective usages, both groups are saying the same
&gt; thing.

&gt; Nominated:

&gt; &gt;Many self-proclaimed rational
&gt; &gt;people seem to be in a sophomoric zone where, since they've
&gt; &gt;learned to identify common irrationalities they themselves
&gt; &gt;*don't* have, they think they've achieved some exalted level
&gt; &gt;of exceptional rationality.  (IOW, they think their cognitive
&gt; &gt;shit don't stink.)

&gt; ======

&gt; In the category &quot;Wanna bet, Einstein?&quot;:

&gt; &gt;&gt; Or the idiotic prayer meeting on a football field with both sides
&gt; &gt;&gt; praying for his help.
&gt; &gt;&gt; Does he flip a coin?
&gt; &gt; Besides a coin is far too limiting, to get a point spread, god would

&gt; &gt; It was SO horrible that I didn't even get it till after seeing your
&gt; &gt; Chez-Watt.  [poster] must be seething with envy.  Me, I'm just not
&gt; &gt; down to this level of competition.

&gt; I saw it. I chose not to comment. I can do better than that when I'm
&gt; asleep (in fact, *only* when I am asleep). I'm not at *all* envious,
&gt; nosir, not me, noway.

&gt; ======

&gt; ======

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; After Man sinned in the garden, Adam and Eve sewed fig leaves to cover
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; up their nudity, after the fall they used animal skins to cover up.
&gt; &gt;&gt; Some would contend, as I do, that Adam and Eve probably had a
&gt; &gt;&gt; brightness about them that clothed them.   When they ate the fruit
&gt; &gt;&gt; that brightness disapered.  This would be the same light that eminated
&gt; &gt;&gt; from Moses' faith after he saw the Lord on Mt Sinai.

&gt; Nominated in the &quot;Cats have all the fun&quot; category.

&gt; &gt;Now that's kinky!!! My newest fantasy: a glow-in-the-dark pussy!

&gt; ======

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; My refutation will be unique and of course, be based on the Bible,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Science, History and Philosophy. May I take this opportunity to remind
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the Group that I have had a Eureka! moment, that I am in possession of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; scientific evidence that equates to the death penalty for the Theory
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of Evolution. Extending this metaphor: you could say that your theory
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is on death row, and that appeals are almost exhausted.
&gt; &gt; &gt; (glances at watch with a too-obviously-being-patient fake smile.)
&gt; &gt; &gt; whatever you say, dear.
&gt; &gt; So you're barefoot?
&gt; &gt; Do you not have anything more constructive to do, like in the kitchen
&gt; &gt; or bedroom?

&gt; I have to nominate this one, but it depends on the personalities.

&gt; ======

&gt; Nominated in the &lt;boggle&gt; category

&gt; &gt;&gt; How?  You have asserted that it was not &quot;beneficial&quot;.  But the
&gt; &gt;&gt; mutation certainly did not prevent his immediate ancestors from
&gt; &gt;&gt; having reproductive success.
&gt; &gt; Reproductive success was not and is not the criteria in which a
&gt; &gt; mutation is considered non-beneficial, is it Howard?

&gt; ======

&gt; IMO, spelling flames are lame, but some deserve immortality.

Well,Sparky, I hope you didn't wager too much money.

Chez Watt is a mean-spirited way of embarrassing others and serves no

Face it, Nashton. The role that you have chosen for yourself is that of
the heckler in the audience. You avoid any sort of meaningful
discussion, preferring to snipe from the edges of discourse, and the
only person that you're succeeding in impressing is yourself.
