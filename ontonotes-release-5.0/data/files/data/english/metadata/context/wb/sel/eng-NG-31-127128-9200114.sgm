Did 174 miles door to door today on a route I've only touched on parts of today and it was a good route without hitting much traffic considering it was a Saturday.

See attached autoroute map for details.

I've just fitted the new exhaust. The shiny new chrome looks out of
place on the scruffy old beast, but then maybe that'll push me to tart
it up a bit, maybe.
I don't know if these links will work but here are some pics.

You've got the new and old, plus a close up of the rusted part on the
old exhaust. I kept to old stainless downpipes as apart from being a
little discoloured they are in good condition and I didn't fancy trying
to undo the lumps of rust that used to be bolts at the engine end.

Red GPZ might be back on the road by the end of the week if I'm lucky

Hi Jack,
Although I don't have the software to read your route map I think I
have done a similar route in the car many years ago.  A good route
indeed.

Al,  now you've put on the new exhaust and possible a few new
sticking plasters we should go for a little ride one day.  I think
Bath is probably midway between my bit of Dorset and your bit of
Gloucester.

Paul, bikes that get used properly are never clean and shiney.  You
should see the Orange Odyssey.  6 months old, 11,000 miles and it got
washed for the first, and only time, at 6,000 miles :-)

Regards

My Bike gets used properly and so did the ER5 - both were shiny tbh.

The Zed looks far to pretty not to wash her down often

My er is 2001 and the down-pipes are rusting. How much was the chrome
replacement. I have not priced stainless yet but I would be more
inclined to go that way. In Ireland they do not put salt on the roads
so in theory good chrome should last. I know a chap who has a 500-cc
Vincent which has all original paint-work and chrome. But I do not
think that chroming now is supposed to last. We are supposed to think
like accountants and change our bikes every time it rains as they
depreciate in value.

List price on the Motad website http://www.motad.co.uk for the ER5 is
£200 plus VAT and postage. However keep an eye on Ebay username motad1
as they seem to have been disposing of some not quite perfect stock,
mine has a small dent which you can't see now that its fitted, and the
prices can be a lot lower, mine cost me £153.01 all in. These are
shipped direct from their factory in Walsall and come with the guaranty
card.

Al

Red GPZ is in for the MOT I hope its good for Friday.

Hi Rob,

I dropped, not literally, the GPZ and Bransons today. I'm hoping
it'll be ready for Friday when I have to go to Reading as I would much
rather ride than take the train. However once it is up and running we'll
have to find a date that suits and go for a run. Bath would be about an
hour from here so that sounds about right for a meet up.

Al

Red GPZ is raring to go.

I must admit that has crossed my mind :-P   Give it a few weeks though
and it'll start to get grubby then no-one will even give it a second
glance again.

I hope you're sitting down Phil... Not got time to take a piccy yet but
the 'Polyfilla' has been sanded and painted with a close-ish match.
While the touch up paint job is not great, the first stage of a full
bodywork respray has started in the attic and fresh decals have been
ordered. Watch this space.

Some good news for those that take their bikes onto the continent.
Speedferries have started taking bikes again, and looks like they have  a
great system for securing them.

Hi All,

Well so much for the new exhaust and planned paint job, I have
managed to throw the bike down the road from about 50mph. I braked for a
corner and my front wheel found the oil slick on the road. I'm fine with
a few bruises, not blue yet, and maybe a fractured bone in my hand, I'm
off to the fracture clinic tomorrow. My right hand is in a half cast
until tomorrow then it will either be out or in a full cast.
I'm waiting for some pictures to be sent through to from the chap
who's car stopped the bike from going any further which I will post for
everyone.
The GPZ is an ex-bike, the frame is bent, part of the engine case is
smashed off, and the fuel tank caved in, but the wheels seem to still be
round!
Looking at my kit I am lucky I bought good stuff with armour in
various places else I could have been looking at a broken elbow or arm.
Waiting for the insurance, fully comp, to go through the motions now and
having fun doing simple things like brushing my teeth and wiping my arse.

Al

Red GPZ is no more.

P.S. Rob, I think that ride is out of the question now lol.

What bad luck Alan I know the feeling I had one hand and one foot out
of action about this time 2 years ago.
Make sure you get a consultant to look at your X rays I had a plaster
up over my knee unnecessarily as the junior A&amp;E doctor said my knee as
well as a bone in my foot was fractured but when the consultant saw it
2 weeks later he declared that the knee was fine and took the plaster
off.
Its your own fault for trying to make the bike too shiny :-)
Enjoy the day time telly
Pete

I'm just back from the fracture clinic with a new purple full cast
on my confirmed fractured wrist. The cast has to stay on for four weeks
which means at least four weeks off work. When I can I'll move the bike
so that I can take some pictures of the damage, it leaning against a
wall hiding the worst side at the moment.
Not surprisingly the missus isn't to keen on me getting another bike
but would settle for a trike, we'll see about that.
I've got to wait for the insurance to go through before I can decide
anything. I am really wondering how much they will offer for a bike that
doubled in value by adding a new exhaust!
Cheers for the messages for a speedy recovery etc.

Al

RIP GPZ

A trike???   How hard did your head impact the pavement?

....try and stay away from the push-trikes

you will probably come to your senses when you heal

LOL

Trikes? All the disadvantages of a car, and none of the advantages of a
bike! On the run around GB one joined us for the first 2 days. I didn't know
he was joining us, and hadn't given any thought to what that would mean. we
set of on the Bank Holiday friday evening from Swindon To Breacon Beacon,
mainly using the A40. there was big jams at some towns, like Monmouth,
stretching for several miles. We were doing 2nd man drop off, and as leader
I was merrily filtering away. We arrived at our destination, and after
10mins  minutes only half had arrived and no sign of tail end Charlie. I
asked others why they thought he hadn't arrived, and one just looked at me
and said TRIKE!!!! Whilst everyone else had filtered, the trike and of
course the tail man behind him had been stuck. That meant that the drop offs
also had to wait for them to arrive at junctions (which were luckily few).
It was nearly 30mins before they arrived, and that section was only 2hrs for
me, so the trike was a big problem! thankfully traffic wasn't a problem from
their to Anglesey but trikes on group runs can really impeded making good
progress.

Cheers

That's damned unlucky Al.  Perhaps the tyres had gone hard from
sitting idle so long :-).  It sounds like the bike went down on the
exhaust side too so you won't get any money back on that.

I just did a quick search on eBay and this is the first hit on the
list:

http://cgi.ebay.co.uk/1996-KAWASAKI-RED_W0QQitemZ320179799351QQihZ011...

It could be a direct replacement.  Just knock a few holes in the
fairing with a hammer and leave outside to &quot;mature&quot; for the winter and
you'll never know the difference :-)

I'm glad you are on the mend.

careful! Hope the insurance doesn't take too long.
