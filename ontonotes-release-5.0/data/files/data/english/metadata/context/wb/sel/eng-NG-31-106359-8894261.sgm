Do these assholes think people don't know what they are doing? This is the
same kind of dolt who can't figure out why he can't place top 15 in the NPC

I wonder if synthol injections will ever catch on...I can't imagine

There was this sci-fic novel, &quot;Babel 17,&quot; by some Hugo Award winner --
the book's from like the '60s or '70s -- and in that future, people,

again, I find most sci-fic and fantasy tedious.  As a matter of fact,
there hasn't been one sci-fic or fantasy book I've ever really
enjoyed.  Not that I've read a lot -- but that's why not.  Arthur C.
Clarke was boring, Issac Asimov was boring, J.R.R. Tolkien is boring
too.  And C.S. Lewis.  Just too boring.  They make much better movies
-- I'm quite shocked these authors are regarded as real writers.  They
might have good stories, but they tell them in very common, boring
ways.

I had to read &quot;Babel 17&quot; for class back in high school.  Wow, to think
that Shakespeare could prove more interesting!

Judging by your uninspired put-down, you must be.  I've always
wondered who they were writing for, exactly.

Their use of language is really mundane.  Unfortunately, most people
can't discern between a good story and good storytelling.

Everyone has good stories.

Only good writers write good stories.

But I suppose with the intellectual level of most people, it's enough
that sentences make sense and paragraphs run along logically, never
mind being artistic or &quot;linguistically&quot; interesting....

Unfortunately, we're caught between the two extremes: Harry Potter and
Stephen King, and artsy-fartsy stuff like what &quot;A Reader's Manifesto&quot;
complained against.

Sigh...it's just like those famous lines: The best lack all
conviction, while the worst/are full of passionate intensity.

I tried reading that first Dune book, too, back then -- can't remember
anything, other than that I gave up somewhere in the first chapter.

To be fair, perhaps I just don't have the kind of imagination
necessary for reading sci-fic/fantasy.  I find the descriptive
passages about technology, magic, or fantastic environments extremely
boring, and these seem to take up a lot of space in such genres,
naturally enough.

If it isn't my imagination at fault, then I can only fault, as I do,
the language, the artistic merits, of such works.  They may have a
good story, but these writers can't really seem to tell them in an
interesting way.  It's like having a good joke but falling flat on the
delivery.  I dunno.

You read bad writers.  Anyway, could you imagine writing a love poem,

Tensor algebra mainly, with a little topology and higher calculus, if

It depends who you are talking about.  Some &quot;classic&quot; sci-fi writers are

If I start finding too many faults in some book in most cases it simply
means that I don't like this kind of writing, and that's it.  I checked
it by reading and rereading some books I liked.  After third time, when
I was simply bored with them, I found more or less the same number of
faults as I do reading first time books I don't like.

It really works like that.  If author can capture you tight enough with
his strong points you'll pay no attention to his faults.  IOW, I doubt
that you'd like Tolkien even if he was less generous with words and more
compact.

Wasn't Moliere the French Shakespeare?  In which case, it was his

Besides, I think &quot;comedy&quot; then was different than what Adams writes
with his &quot;Hitchhiker&quot; series.  I do say, though, that I applaud the

he was not good.  (In terms of &quot;story&quot; or &quot;vision,&quot; his creativity was
great.)

It's like somebody who has muscles and striations and mass and

I didn't say I wasn't interested in SF.  I merely found the few

That is different, however, from the &quot;vision&quot; or &quot;story&quot; behind the

Well, we are obviously having semantic difficulties here (indeed, many
semanticists claim that disagreements by definition are over semantics
-- over terms and definitions).

By &quot;linguistic creativity&quot; in the context of literary merit and
aesthetic value I am not speaking of engineering languages, creative
as that project is in general.

I refer to something like the difference between &quot;he's a piece of
shit&quot; and &quot;he looks like something rejected by the digestive
system&quot;...not that the latter is &quot;creative&quot; or &quot;artistic,&quot; but the
former is certainly plain and boring, which is how these authors
generally write.

Now that's fine -- what I've called serviceable writing -- where most
exposition is concerned.  But the nature of SF is such (I would even
say of so-called literary fiction, but in a slightly different way)
that descriptive passages of fantastic technology or environments need
an especially creative use of language.  I have not found such soaring
language, which I think would need to be almost akin to poetry -- for
poetry says more, more quickly and poignantly, than prose often
can....

So Tolkien wasn't Polish and couldn't have imagined something so
clever.  Hey, I think there's a future for you in fan fiction!

It's a fair complaint -- but then you're questioning the logic of the
story, as opposed to judging its aesthetic merit.  Different things,
again.  That's like complaining about &quot;Star Trek&quot; that transporters
couldn't possibly work, given the laws of physics (unless essentially
the transported person is totally destroyed at the point of departure
while perfectly cloned at the destination).  Says nothing about the
&quot;vision&quot; or &quot;artistic worth&quot; of the stories.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; He was rather conscious, that nobody before him did anything of similar

No, I'm talking about the theme of the hero giving up power, instead
of seeking power and glory -- which is the usual quest of such epics.
It's what made Christianity (and late Judaism) so revolutionary: not
to seek power, but to give it up.

Tolkien doesn't seem to register any consciousness of the momentous
import of such a theme.  Frodo is not merely the anti-hero in being
short and chubby and wanting nothing more than a good smoke; he goes
through all that bother to *give up* power.  Absolutely ridiculous,
from an &quot;Old Testament&quot; sort of perspective.

Kinda like weight lifting to get thinner or something...actually,
hmmm, now that I think about it...it's pretty much part of what
exercise does for me -- keeps me away from the girls, who are
generally trouble...I'm too &quot;tired&quot; to bother with girls, even though
exercise has me in great shape and really attractive to them!

&gt; that language artistically -- or, in the case of programming

&gt;&gt; linguistic creativity?

&gt; Well, we are obviously having semantic difficulties here (indeed, many

&gt; By &quot;linguistic creativity&quot; in the context of literary merit and

No, I don't mean his writing style.  Actually I think that it's his

Tolkien was piously Christian, I seem to recall.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

I don't think that Tolkien &quot;registered&quot; anything special, because I
happen to think it wasn't all that special.  The idea that if you get
too much power it will eat you from within wasn't new even in the last

turn against you also wasn't new.  Rabbi had to destroy his Golem and

True -- but in terms of SF, I can't imagine any other way to best
convey the novelty of the alien technology, say, or fantastic
environment...because it's so new, it demands a new use of language,
an original application of familiar terms...obviously, it's sufficient
for the legions of fans out there that these authors merely &quot;report&quot;
their visions...but I do not really smell or taste or even see -- much
less *feel* with a shudder like I would if I were really in those
amazing worlds -- the great things they are pointing to with their
words because they are so ham-fisted with their words and the banality
of their use of language blocks from sight what they would show....

I mean, to write that &quot;the dragon was ancient and scaly&quot; is lazy paint-

You needn't have actually attended such workshops to imagine the
terrible results of such a viewpoint: you like the writing if you like

of creative writing workshops, which often degenerate into mutual ass-
kissing.  It's kind of like what happens in newsgroups...or any other
social situation, for that matter: cliques form, alliances form, based
on personality and not on ideas and any real merit....

Um, I agree with that.  It's been precisely the implication of all my
statements so far that the first job of a writer is to write well.

That's not what you were saying, however, in reference to liking

that's it&quot; the wrong way...yes, perhaps I took it too &quot;literally,&quot;

I believe he says as much in his book and many articles on how to

entertainment: if it turns out to be art, great, but that's not his

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Indeed, but then we're in Philip K. Dick's &quot;Buddhist&quot; territory: who
am I, who are you, what is a self...even if there's only one of &quot;you&quot;
at any given moment, the very fact that for a Star Trek transporter to
work means destruction of one body while perfectly cloning it in
another location (namely, memories of undergoing transporter use
intact at the destination) raises the Buddhist -- and in particular
Zen Buddhist -- existential issue of what is a self...we are just
patterns in spacetime, that's all!

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; You are essentially right.  Tolkien had pretty good stories (just

It's too bad those movies only saw the special effects potential of
his stories, whereas the dramatic aspects were TOTALLY missed
(otherwise they would have engaged Shakespearean actors like Kenneth
Branaugh and Liem Nielson for such psychologically rich roles, 'cause
aside from the dude playing Gandalf, the leads were really out of
their element, especially the hobbits).

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Well, after the customs of his class, yes, though not a religious

unwittingly.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Indeed, it's the very tale of the Buddha, or Christ -- born of kings
(or of God Himself!), able to conqueror with power, yet seeks
spiritual solace, eschewing the illusions of worldly glories.  What's
&quot;new,&quot; however, in terms of mass market fiction, is that the
protagonist of a fantasy genre is deliberately to lose power, not gain
it.

Unfortunately, most of the books are cluttered -- yes, cluttered --
with claptrap about orcs and goblins and dragons and other things that
go bump in the night...and told in language reminiscent of one's
Sunday newspapers.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Of course, there are no new ideas or themes in literature.  However,
Tolkien unwittingly scored a &quot;poetic&quot; triumph with the theme of
ambition itself.  It's not just that this object or that object is
bad...it's that power itself is bad -- or it would have been that, had
he recognized the full implications of his theme.  For all his
learning, he did &quot;mine deeper,&quot; as the writer and teacher John C.
Gardner admonishes; Tolkien did not fully consider the philosophical
implications of the drama he envisioned: power corrupts, and absolute
power corrupts absolutely.  Now there's an epic for our democratic
age!  No great king or prince for a hero, as in past epics -- Aragon
is a supporting character -- but some country bumpkin who, though
without a native courage and intelligence, wants nothing than a good
smoke (the equivalent of beer and Sunday night football), and yet is
called upon to the greatest task of all.  And what's that task?  To
get rid of power, absolute power, a mission impossible for those who
are ambitious, for all the kings and princes and elves and leading
citizens of great cities and glorious realms.

Interestingly, such a mission, while ultimately impossible for those
people, requires their help -- it takes power to give up power!  Oh,

mathematics is nothing but another kind of language, I was thinking

Okay, blind-men-groping-elephant territory here:

I agree that poetry is not &quot;precise&quot; in the way mathematics is

But I also think that poetry is &quot;straight-forward&quot; in the way
mathematics can be &quot;straight-forward&quot; -- or, a better word,

especially those of Shakespeare, but there are poems which are

Sure it is.  First and foremost, it's a way of perceiving the world --

I totally disagree, of course.

Mathematics is a creation of the human mind.  That its cutting edge
today is, perhaps, the most abstract exercise of human intellect
possible doesn't make it any less human -- or, in the hands of an
artist well-versed in both frames of mind, beautiful to non-
mathematicians.

I would agree that there is a terrible, horrible dearth of
mathematical science fiction.  Perhaps first we need the prose, and
then the poetry will follow, poetry such as I can vaguely sense but
not fully envision.  No, Rudy v. Bitter-Rucker's nice collection
&quot;Mathenauts&quot; is not sufficient, though nice to have as the only
collection of the only mathematical sci-fic around.

Mathematics is eminently human.  Part of the problem may turn out to
be that our brains can only go so far -- imagine so much -- and
perhaps an alien, literally extraterrestrial, mentality will be
needed....

another hundred years...even in the West, advanced as it is, I do not
think there is a poet who explores such things...the only people who
even come close to that territory I've described are writers of
popular science and mathematics like Douglas Hofstaedtler (sp?) -- but
I don't think he really gets poetry, either, though he's written a
book which might be loosely described as the connections between
language, math, and mind....

&gt; so-called &quot;pure&quot; mathematics which &quot;point&quot; to nothing in the material
&gt; world at all and yet which still make sense according to their own

But that's precisely my point -- they would perceive things in such a

if they're not carbon-based life-forms (an even further stretch of the

every thief thinks everyone else is a thief...I think we shouldn't be

Almost certainly not.  So why math??

Indeed, what kind of a civilization would telepathic beings have??
Would such beings even perceive themselves to be individuals, if their

our brains (which I say is, in its higher-order functions, a pattern-

Dogs seem to lack a green color cone. They are similar to humans who suffer
from a from red-green color-blindness (like my father--such people are

Well, I guess I would be.  But if someone trains as he would compete,
lifting the same way, why should there be a difference?  I mean, I
understand if someone gets nervous and lifts a foot off the
ground...but slip-ups aside, where else could the difference between a
gym lift and an official one come from?

I lift slowly, I don't bounce the thing off my chest, I even lift off
myself (since I have no spotter, no training partner), so everything's
done nice and slow, I also pause slightly at my chest -- just enough
to make sure I'm not bouncing, but not so long as to maybe lose
strength or let the weight rest on my chest....

How do you get started competing officially?  I googled and got some
interesting weightlifters' pages (and why are these guys all into
Republican politics???), but maybe I'll go official next year...I'm
trying to hit 405, you know...I can kind of imagine it and a part of
me just can't, given how heavy 315 feels (I'm doing three of these now
on my first set; the second, after three minutes' rest, is just one
rep!)...maybe training for an official event will help get me to
405....
