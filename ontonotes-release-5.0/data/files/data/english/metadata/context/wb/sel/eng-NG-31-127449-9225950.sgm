Here's a great example why credit reports are not reliable, or a
measurement of one's trustworthiness. Especially since the reporters
themselves can't be trusted.

http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/content/oct2007/db2007103...

To sum it up; a consumer had a credit card, which was included in a
bankruptcy. But Capital One kept reporting the card as an open card,
with a balance, and (I assume) late. Despite numerous calls and letters,
Capital One never fixed the error. Consumer ended up having to pay
the balance in order to be able to get a mortgage.

The story even goes on to tell that debt collectors buy discharged
debts, and then try to collect them. And, of course, report them to
the credit bureaus in the process.

There is something more to this story that appears to be missing from
the article....Anyone who goes through a bankruptcy had papers to
prove it. Wachovia should have accepted those papers as proof of the
discharged debt.  And any bank or lawyer who advises to pay up almost
ten grand to shut up a credit report, is not a place you do business
with. This is a scam Cap One was running and the guy's lawyer should
have sued.  At that amount, it becomes worth it and then some.

Besides, how the hell does someone go bankrupt in 2002 and apply for
and get a mortgage in 2003. Again...something is funny here.

I do not doubt this happens. It should be a nice class action suit or
something one's reps in Wash DC should  be notified about to get some
regs written. It doesn't surprise me that the bank or anyone else they
sell the debt to (at pennies on the dollar, max, I assume) tries this,
what surprises me is that anyone would be idiot enough to pay it.

Well, one of the banks involved has a rep quoted in the article as
saying roughly &quot;we have no obligation to remove these debts from the
drecit report even if we know they're bankrupt&quot;. If that's true, then
it certainly appears to be a place where more legislation is needed.

That is usually for credit cards and short term loans, though. A
mortgage, if of the more common kind, is going to be for 15 or 30
years. That makes it more dangerous for the lender.

Although there are a lot of sites offering assurances that one can
obtain a mortgage immediately after bankruptcy and that they will
willingly allow you to pay for the information on how to do it, the
more legitimate ones advise to rebuild credit for a few years, first.

Again, we know that extent  of sub-prime mortgages is only beginning
to take its too, but I still find it strange.

My Soft Sister and her Idiot Gambler-Con Artist spouse went bankrupt
to the tune of a hundred grand racked up in one year of marriage. No
medical emergencies or joblessness there, either, just pure greed and
irresponsibility.  They got credit cards soon after, but did have a
lot of trouble renting an apartment. Go figure.

I do understand that most personal bankruptcies are not based on the
circumstances of my %7*$# sister and BIL, though.

It's not that simple. This is how understood it. Traditionally, banks
had trouble because they were borrowing short (deposits), and lending
long (mortgages). So that created an imbalance of lengths of the various
accounts.

That's why they started packaging and selling mortgages. And so nowadays
it's pretty common to have your mortgage sold, even many times during
its life. So therefore the bank isn't really on the hook for it for
a very long time.

I've been reading a few of the financial stories. A google on something
like (foreclosures u.s.) produces a lot of information. I'd say it is
not clear yet whether the sky is falling, but it's possible.

Something fairly significant is certainly happening to the U.S. economy.
I'm just doing some figuring, and the Canadian dollar has gone from
being valued at roughly 63 U.S. cents in 1998 to $1.07 on Friday. I make
that to be a 70-per-cent gain in less than 10 years.

That's not by way of boasting, since many currencies have done similar
things. But I'm wondering what Americans make of it. Is it something
worrisome, or not?

But the idea behind mortgage securitization is that the risk is greatly
reduced because you're spreading it out over a huge pool of mortgages. A
certain percentage of defaults is expected and allowed for.

Obviously it didn't work out that way, but the banks and other lenders
believed that it did and acted on that belief.

I am not even sure that with this latest fiasco, as with previous,
though smaller ones, as long as a lot of  cash kept coming in up
front, which it did when the mortgages were created, those who should
have been responsible, decided to look at sales figures and potential
income down the line, rather than do a true evaluation of risk.

These are like ponzi schemes with CEOs perfectly happy to take the
benefits and praise and accounting companies signing off on it all. I
cannot believe that no one with experience in this area did not
foresee problems down the road. Basically they were ignored for short
term gain.

There were more than a few warning signs about the housing bubble, but
of course the Fed Reserve's pet rat, Greenspan, was either dense or
reprehensible.

Do I think a lot of these losses are caused by crooked dealing on the
part of the mortgage companies? Like the S&amp;L scandals or in businesses
like Enron and Anderson? I am not sure.

Either everyone selling these mortgages to those who would likely be
unable to pay them off when the adjustable  rates went up was so young
that they had no memory or knowledge of the vagaries of the market
place (just as many folks who put every sent into the dot.com bubble,
never believing that the numbers would collapse), or they were trained
not to take such risks into account, or those in management who *did*
understand what could happen, figured they and their own company would
float over it all and take the money and run. Only they tripped.

Pushing  these sub prime mortgages met a lot of sales goals, earned a
lot of commissions and initial cash and now there are a lot of
mortgage servicers out of jobs, whole companies gone under,  homes in
foreclosure, and billions up in smoke.

None of that falls under the usual &quot;assumed risk&quot; of the mortgage and
credit business. Greed and/or stupidity on the part of the mortgage
companies, complete or in some cases head-in-the-sand ignorance on the
part of  homeowners who trusted (yes, very mistakenly so) the banks
when qualified.   When all the lenders are qualifying these people for
huge mortgages with little or no money down, the borrowers do get
lulled (I am not defending all of them) into thinking that is the way
*all* mortgaging works and has always worked.

An economic bubble built on a house of cards.

&gt; &gt; making large write-downs?

&gt; I've been reading a few of the financial stories. A google on something
&gt; like (foreclosures u.s.) produces a lot of information. I'd say it is
&gt; not clear yet whether the sky is falling, but it's possible.

&gt; Something fairly significant is certainly happening to the U.S. economy.
&gt; I'm just doing some figuring, and the Canadian dollar has gone from
&gt; being valued at roughly 63 U.S. cents in 1998 to $1.07 on Friday. I make
&gt; that to be a 70-per-cent gain in less than 10 years.

&gt; That's not by way of boasting, since many currencies have done similar
&gt; things. But I'm wondering what Americans make of it. Is it something
&gt; worrisome, or not?

I admit, it causes me concern. I blame Canada.

People have been complaining for a long time about the balance of
trade.  The falling dollar should push back on that a bit.  I'm more
wondering why it took so long for it to come about.

If you bought a house you can't afford, you probably have something to
worry about.  On a society-wide level, it is less clear.  The biggest, but
certainly not only, concern is that once enough people think there will be
a big problem, then there will be a big problem just for that reason.

I don't know if it's true, but I could imagine that the owner of the
principle got paid beforehand, for example, by whoever is now collecting
the interest. Obviously they wouldn't get the full amount, but still
receiving the interest would allow them to go ahead and fund other
mortgages.

My BIL phoned my brother from the rental office to try to wheedle a
co-sign out of him, using as his selling point, that my brother
couldn't lose more than $8 or 10 thousand dollars. My brother refused,
but was rather amused at being told that if he signed,  he'd most
likely have been deliberately left holding the bag.

The sister knows better than to call me. I consider running up their
$100,000 of fun and games credit card debt in one year and then going
bankrupt to be so reprehensible, that I now get all my financial news
about them from the other sibs, never directly.

We've all bailed her out. Repeatedly. They have the latest computers,
wide screen TVs, rock concert tickets, the fanciest cell phones, nice
dinners out, they travel....She once told me she didn't have enough
money to fill a prescription and I'd have gladly called the pharmacy
direct and given a credit card number to them, but not a nickel would
I ever again place in her hands. She turned down the request to pay
directly for the Rx. I wonder why?

Either some loans (not necessarily mortgages, but _some_ kinds of loans)
still have prepayment penalties, or people believe they do, because one of

Pre-payment penalties are specifically prohibited on mortgages having more
than a certain (very high) interest rate.  I wouldn't think they would
bother making them illegal in a specific case if they were already illegal
in general, but the law often is an ass.

&gt; &gt;&gt; True.,I had one mortgage that changed owners more often than I washed

&gt; &gt;reduced because you're spreading it out over a huge pool of mortgages. A
&gt; &gt;certain percentage of defaults is expected and allowed for.

&gt; &gt;Obviously it didn't work out that way, but the banks and other lenders

&gt; I am not even sure that with this latest fiasco, as with previous,

&gt; have been responsible, decided to look at sales figures and potential
&gt; income down the line, rather than do a true evaluation of risk.

&gt; These are like ponzi schemes with CEOs perfectly happy to take the
&gt; benefits and praise and accounting companies signing off on it all. I
&gt; cannot believe that no one with experience in this area did not
&gt; foresee problems down the road. Basically they were ignored for short
&gt; term gain.

&gt; There were more than a few warning signs about the housing bubble, but
&gt; of course the Fed Reserve's pet rat, Greenspan, was either dense or
&gt; reprehensible.

&gt; Do I think a lot of these losses are caused by crooked dealing on the
&gt; part of the mortgage companies? Like the S&amp;L scandals or in businesses
&gt; like Enron and Anderson? I am not sure.

&gt; Either everyone selling these mortgages to those who would likely be
&gt; unable to pay them off when the adjustable  rates went up was so young
&gt; that they had no memory or knowledge of the vagaries of the market
&gt; place (just as many folks who put every sent into the dot.com bubble,
&gt; never believing that the numbers would collapse), or they were trained
&gt; not to take such risks into account, or those in management who *did*
&gt; understand what could happen, figured they and their own company would
&gt; float over it all and take the money and run. Only they tripped.

&gt;  Pushing  these sub prime mortgages met a lot of sales goals, earned a
&gt; lot of commissions and initial cash and now there are a lot of
&gt; mortgage servicers out of jobs, whole companies gone under,  homes in
&gt; foreclosure, and billions up in smoke.

&gt; None of that falls under the usual &quot;assumed risk&quot; of the mortgage and
&gt; credit business. Greed and/or stupidity on the part of the mortgage
&gt; companies, complete or in some cases head-in-the-sand ignorance on the
&gt; part of  homeowners who trusted (yes, very mistakenly so) the banks
&gt; when qualified.   When all the lenders are qualifying these people for
&gt; huge mortgages with little or no money down, the borrowers do get
&gt; lulled (I am not defending all of them) into thinking that is the way
&gt; *all* mortgaging works and has always worked.

&gt; An economic bubble built on a house of cards.

Like most bubbles, I think much of this was founded on the &quot;bigger
fool&quot; theory.  Even people who knew that there was trouble abrewing
would buy and sell paper, hoping not to be left holding it when the
bubble burst.  If they had been buying paper with the expectation of
holding onto it, they would have looked at the risk a lot more
carefully.  That's the free market at work!

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; That is usually for credit cards and short term loans, though. A
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mortgage, if of the more common kind, is going to be for 15 or 30
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; years. That makes it more dangerous for the lender.

&gt; &gt; &gt; On the other hand, they do have a lien securing something of considerable
&gt; &gt; &gt; value.  Maybe not considerable enough lately, but it is something at least.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It's not that simple. This is how understood it. Traditionally, banks
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; had trouble because they were borrowing short (deposits), and lending
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; long (mortgages). So that created an imbalance of lengths of the various
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; accounts.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; That's why they started packaging and selling mortgages. And so nowadays
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it's pretty common to have your mortgage sold, even many times during
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; its life. So therefore the bank isn't really on the hook for it for
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a very long time.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Have you noticed the mortgage lenders dropping like flies?  And the banks
&gt; &gt; &gt; making large write-downs?

&gt; &gt; I've been reading a few of the financial stories. A google on something
&gt; &gt; like (foreclosures u.s.) produces a lot of information. I'd say it is
&gt; &gt; not clear yet whether the sky is falling, but it's possible.

&gt; &gt; Something fairly significant is certainly happening to the U.S. economy.
&gt; &gt; I'm just doing some figuring, and the Canadian dollar has gone from
&gt; &gt; being valued at roughly 63 U.S. cents in 1998 to $1.07 on Friday. I make
&gt; &gt; that to be a 70-per-cent gain in less than 10 years.

&gt; &gt; That's not by way of boasting, since many currencies have done similar
&gt; &gt; things. But I'm wondering what Americans make of it. Is it something
&gt; &gt; worrisome, or not?

&gt; I admit, it causes me concern. I blame Canada.

OK, this has gone on long enough. YOU DON'T OWN PRINCIPLES! You may be said
to own the principal on a loan. I guess if you are in the mob and have
incriminating information about a school administrator you can be said to
&quot;own&quot; a principal. Principles are free, at least in principle.

They're teasing me for misspelling &quot;principal&quot;. You must be at least
this native-English-speaking to take the bait. Otherwise they have to
throw you back.

English does have the word &quot;principle&quot;. It means a basic truth or a
moral standard. It is pronounced the same as &quot;principal,&quot; the word I
meant to type.

Now if you'll excuse me, I have to pick something up at the
stationary store.

Perhaps it is simply a longstanding tradition in the US that
mortgages have no prepayment penalty. So the lender can offer such a
mortgage, but people tend to prefer the traditional arrangement, even
at less favorable terms.

That is one of the questions I've considered posting here before--whether
the differences between US and Canadian mortgages (which, as I understand
it, have prepayment penalties and balloon payments as the rule rather than
the exception) are based in differences in the law or were primarily just
cultural preference differences.  Of course even things that start out as
cultural differences generally end up getting ensconced in the law to some
extent.

&gt;Obviously it didn't work out that way, but the banks and other lenders
