I was using my foodstamps at the checkout counter
when I saw a guy staring at me with deep resentment.  I
turned away from him.  Then I looked back and he still
had the sneer on his face.

&quot;Hey&quot;, I said, &quot;ever hear of a little thing called the
Vietnam War?&quot;

He began to shake and stammer.  &quot;I'm sorry&quot;, he said,
&quot;I didn't know you served in Nam.&quot;

&quot;I didn't serve in Nam&quot;, I responded.  &quot;But I felt so guilty
about it that I had myself committed to a nuthouse and
have been receiving federal assistance ever since.
Got a problem with that?&quot;

I want to tell you the truth, so listen up.  I was writing that
post on the fly, which
is the way I like it, as that way there's no work involved, when my
cell phone rang and
it was a customer to start my night, which at the end turned out to be
one of the
shittiest nights financially I've ever had driving the cab.  That's
the way I start my
night, usually sometime between 7 and 8pm.  I get on the computer
while eating my
homemade breakfast.  I turn the cellphone on just in case I get a
call.  The guy who
called was a good customer, so I told him I'd be right there, he was
my first ride of
the night, and I had to cut my little on-the-fly story to you short.
I had no idea where
the story was going, as usual, but as usual it was probably heading
toward a typically
predictable conclusion such as me whipping the shit out of the guy or
stomping his
eyes until they ballooned to triple normal size and exploded out of
his skull.  Or
something.

I used to work with a black comic named Jeff Jewett.   He kind of
hated me, and I wonder if you are him.    Are you the same guy who
stood on a desk and took his pants off at Socal Telco thinking that
you were going to show your underwear but forgot to wear any that day?

All the secretaries couldn't look at you after you did that but the
company didn't want to lose your production so instead of firing you
they made you commute three hours a day to a different office.   Are
you _that_ Jeff Jewett?

I think it's the same guy.  I'll ask Jeff next time I see him.  At
the moment I'm
planning to loan Jeff $30,000 so he won't have to work for several
years and can
concentrate solely on his standup routines, of which so far he has
only one.  But he's
got the potential.  I've been the biz 40 years and I've seen them
come and go, and this
kid is one of the best.  He's going all the way to the top, as long as
he keeps plugging
away, doing those open mics, working on his routines, writing,
writing, writing.  I've
seen the best and I've seen the worst.  Jewett has the potential to be
the greatest
standup comic of our generation.  BUT, if he doesn't pay me back the
10 grand within
one year of his first tv appearance, you can bet your life he'll be
the greatest dead comic
of our generation.  Nobody refuses to pay me back and gets away with
it.

I made 75k with that company, living like a rock star.  Every quuater
we earned giftcards, I had given one of the secretaries one hundred
dollars worth, and she ratted me out.  Why do you think I hated you?

some dude from Roanoke.  Always walking around with a camera, but apparently
has never developed a single film or reduced any of his digitizations to
viewable form.

Why do cameras have round lenses, and crank out square photos.  If you put a
square lens on one, would it produce a round photo?

I don't know who Lester-Whoever, is, and,
I've seen, Marika, respond, here, before,
once, to one of my posts--: But, it
was a rudely indirect grabbing
of the post, just to say
something &quot;inside&quot;
to her regular
'Lester'
newsgroup.
I don't like
how she
grabs posts
from other
newsgroups
to post into
HER newsgroup.
It feels like, theft,
(almost), to me.

I don't mind her posting here. But,
I sure wish she'd pick ONE
newsgroup at a time
and stop merely
pinching
posts for her
'Little Lester Click'
which has very little
traffic and posts;
So she does that
so she can
provide
entertainment
and something
to respond
to, just,
mainly for
HER tiny
newsgroup!!
I find that
approach
quite
rude and
kinda
creepy.

It's kind of like, Marika, sees somebody
on the next street over, and
forcibly grabs them
and pulls them over
to her boring street
in front of her bored
to tear lonely
neighbors, just so
she can make her
little inside comment
about you, in front
of her friends.
It makes you feel
almost violated
or something.
How dare she!!

I also don't like how she always
quotes from other folks,
on her signature line,
and how the quote usually
has something within
the sentiments, which,
perhaps, very loosely
or indirectly speaks to
her reactions to something
within a post or a poster
that she is responding
to, etc.; So she's
basically using
someone else's
quote to respond
to the post she's
responding to,
instead of using
her own words to
freely express
her own views in
her own way!!

I'll gladly welcome her to this newsgroup
and debate her or talk to
her or whatever, IF,
she comes
HERE,
exclusively to
post her responses,
AND, *IF*, she
DIRECTLY
relates her OWN
thoughts through
HER words and stops
relying so (Bloody!!)
heavily on others'
quotes, to somewhat
mysteriously and
cryptically and
annoyingly
indirectly
express her
*apparent*
reactions to
some viewpoint
within a post or
her reactions to
a poster or group
or posters, etc.!!

I am SO embarrassed that you are paying so much attention to me.

Would you care to go out and get a bite to eat?

My treat.

It never occurred to me that Famous A's has a breakfast!  But that would be
the perfect place, tomorrow, say 9 am?

Good gosh.

breaking bread with you is something I am truly looking forward to.

No doubt.

PS on a personal note.  I am going to go to the Pacific Northwest for

I don't know who Lester-Whoever, is, and,

once, to one of my posts--: But, it
was a rudely indirect grabbing
of the post, just to say
something &quot;inside&quot;

'Lester'
newsgroup.
I don't like
how she
grabs posts
from other
newsgroups
to post into
HER newsgroup.
It feels like, theft,
(almost), to me.

I don't mind her posting here. But,
I sure wish she'd pick ONE
newsgroup at a time
and stop merely
pinching
posts for her
'Little Lester Click'
which has very little
traffic and posts;
So she does that
so she can
provide
entertainment
and something
to respond
to, just,
mainly for
HER tiny
newsgroup!!
I find that
approach
quite
rude and
kinda
creepy.

It's kind of like, Marika, sees somebody
on the next street over, and
forcibly grabs them
and pulls them over
to her boring street
in front of her bored
to tear lonely
neighbors, just so
she can make her
little inside comment
about you, in front
of her friends.
It makes you feel
almost violated
or something.
How dare she!!

I also don't like how she always
quotes from other folks,
on her signature line,
and how the quote usually
has something within
the sentiments, which,
perhaps, very loosely
or indirectly speaks to
her reactions to something
within a post or a poster
that she is responding
to, etc.; So she's
basically using
someone else's
quote to respond
to the post she's
responding to,
instead of using
her own words to
freely express
her own views in
her own way!!

I'll gladly welcome her to this newsgroup
and debate her or talk to
her or whatever, IF,
she comes
HERE,
exclusively to
post her responses,
AND, *IF*, she
DIRECTLY
relates her OWN
thoughts through

Marika and Chafey,
Two peas in a pod.
A match made in heaven.
Hey Chafey did I correctly guess your make-believe job or not?
I know that seems like an insincere question that begs more the
possibility that really you don't have one ... but in the off-chance
you do (i.e. have a job we'd all be jealous of), I'd still hate to be
the one to accidentally spill the beans on it if all you were was a
lowly intern on an otherwise big TV show ... hint hint hint ... are
you him?

Marika, I saw your recent post to
Me on another news-server,
but, it hasn't shown up
yet on this one, which is
why I am now responding
to the last post from
Me in the thread
(And, I explain all
of that, since,
I know how you
computer geeks
notice those kinds
of inconsequentially
unimportant goober
boob things).

(--Hee Hee--)

Now, Then--: You said something about
&quot;two&quot; &quot;hate&quot; posts from Me....!?
Uhhhh....No. Not even
one!! That last time
you posted in here
that I was talking
about; that time,
I never responded
about you or even
acknowledged
your post at
all. I made no
comment about
it, back then.
Period.
And, those
last three
posts (two
were mere
typo-corrected
and//or slightly
updated versions
of the first post
about you in
this thread);
THAT post
was NOT
a HATE
post at all!!
It was just
an honestly
sardonic
critiquing
of you, as
I've reacted
to you, so far.
It was meant
to be stingingly
funny, but not
hateful towards
you. It was
more of
a virtual
spank than
an out-an-out
virtual punch,
for sure.

Now, as far as, that other techno-geek
Computer World nonsense, you'll
have to come down to Earth,
Ms. Spock Spore Brain
and translate for normal
folks like Me!! You know,
I sincerely hope to
gradually, virtually
shock you out of that
creepy techno-geek
mode that you've been
in for way too many
years, Marika!!
Seriously, Girl,
you must want
to be set Free
from some of that,
don't you!? It's just
not right for you
to be wasting away
into a poor imitation
of Jodie Foster in
that one Astronaut
movie she did!!
(i.e. 'CONTACT')
Did SHE wear
pampers in that
movie!? I forget.
Do you wear
pampers!?

I assume you are a 40-something,
perhaps, 30-something year old,
correct!? And you do some
kind of computer type
of work for a living,
correct!?

Anywho, just TRY to talk in normal
English, and elaborate about
that Computer World &quot;list&quot;
crack you made
and tell us
what that link was
supposed to be. (As
most folks here with any
self-respect DO NOT go
clicking just any ol' link
placed before their
eyes on here,
Marika!!
Sheesh.

And, finally, I DO know what a
sig. file, is, so, I don't know
what you're implying
there. I said
'signature line' as a
way to describe
the positioning of
your quotes, NOT,
as a totally technical
description, Girl!!

Anywho, it looks like YOU'RE about
the only poster at that
'Lester' newsgroup,
Marika, so why
do you stay and
try to artificially
pump-up the posts
through pinching
posts from other
newsgroups!?

....And, AGAIN, I very NICELY said
(WITH NO HATE AT
ALL); I VERY SWEETLY,
said, I'd welcome you
HERE, Girl, if you'd just
COMMIT to THIS
newsgroup,
exclusively,
when you
post
here!!

I believe you're an actual FEMALE,
for real, (which is pretty
AMAZING for THIS
place) and I think
you have potential,
beyond your
lamely creepy
techno-jargonized
computer-girl
geekiness!!
And, believe Me,
I don't just hand
out semi-compliments
like that-there,
left and right, My
Sugar-Cookie-Kins!!

Anyhow, I like the name, Marika.
So, that's a start. (--Hee Hee--)

Oh, by the way, that paragraph where
I talk about how you grab people
off of one street, etc., and, then,
it ends with--: &quot;How Dare She!!&quot;
Upon reading that back--:
I, honestly, pictured
Dane Cook, doing
that paragraph
(and a few other
paragraphs within
that same area).
And I am not
even a fan
of him. But, the
few times he's been
funny, it was one of
those kinds of jokes
or comments. Those
parts of my post
reminded me
of him. It was his
kind of an analogy
and//or attitude
that he would
perform or write
or have written
for him. And
MY kind of an
analogy and//or
attitude,
obviously.
But, I only
mention him,
because, he's
famous
nationally,
and, I
am NOT,
famous
nationally.
Yet.

So, I was flattering
myself, by comparing
myself to someone
much more famous
than I am.

Anywho, my point, was, there, that,
even as egotistical as I am, I
sometimes, hear other
comics or commentators
in my head, besides
my OWN voice, when I
read out-loud some
of my original
material. I see
the similarities
I have with other
writers and//or
performers and
such. It's the
same way,
in music writing,
too. I hear something
I've just recorded,
and it will, sometimes,
somewhat loosely
remind me of
another artist.

Anyway, your quotes from other
writers, are really not always
bad picks at all, but, I just
feel you use that as
too much of a crutch
to hide behind. Much,
like you're hiding there,
in that godforsaken
'Lester Blackhole'
(Which is almost
empty save
for YOU
and all of
those pinched
posts you've
rudely
grabbed
away from
other, more
vibrant
places).

I mean, it just seems that you want
to be so indirect that you
often use largely obscure
quotes to get across
some severely vague
position you have in
your mind, that you're
afraid to just spit out
yourself, directly
and assuredly,
in no uncertain
terms....!!

I didn't understand half or more of what you ranted about there.
I sent a link regarding HIPAA, the HI in there has to do with health
insurance not computers.
I do know that I don't work in the computer field, and never have.
I do know that I have a ten year old computer, that can't even play the
youtube stuff people keep posting, so I am probably the exact opposite of a
computer geek.
I do know enough from reading that you are doing &quot;social engineering&quot; or
something with a term like that.
Which means loosely that you are trying to find out about me without telling
me anything about yourself.
I'll tell you this much.
I won't tell you what I do for a living, how old I am nor even my correct
gender.
However, I will tell you that marika is my real name where as &quot;late and
great chafey brassiere&quot; is not yours.
If you know I have been on the net for a long time, then you are welcome to
read my articles to determine the answer to all the questions you have about
me.
I don't post the information for just no reason at all.
It's a blog, a journal.
And of course, I don't care whether you welcome me or don't.  You don't own
the group consequently, I can post here whether you welcome my presence or
not.
And you can post at aullm too, I don't own that neither.
Also, it's pretty lame to say, &quot;i meant it as a joke&quot;, when the responder
perceived that and the response was captioned also as a joke.  Getting
offended by someone asking you to breakfast is pretty weird if you ask me.

it's about walking away from a fight, cos you ARE better and don't have to
stoop to the lowness you have stooped too in picking one to begin with

Take care this weekend.

Sheesh, Marika, I didn't think you were
being so serious about you
wanting to go for breakfast
with Me. That reminds me
of a time, when I was quite
young and inexperienced
and walking down
the street and some
girl, cooed from
her porch--: Can
I make breakfast on
your face!? Or head!?
Or something, like,
that, and, later,
I come to find
out, I was wrong
to be afraid she was
going to throw an
egg at Me!! She
was just somewhat
crudely or cryptically
saying she wanted
me to eat her out.
At least that's
what someone
told me she
meant. But,
I would have
still checked
for a surprise
prank egg,
even if
she literally
pulled her
pants
down and
sat atop
my face,
right in the
street!! ....I am just
cautious like that.

Anywho, I am NOT The Clown's Sock
Cock Puppet, at all, I assure
you. No. No. NO!!

And, I really wasn't sure how sarcastic
you were being with the &quot;Hate&quot;
comment. I thought you might
have taken it harder than
I was intending. And I
still don't know what
your point was with
that link to Computer
World. Seriously.

And, now, that you've reacted even
more sensitively to my latest
response, I am STILL not
sure how overly-sensitive
and overly-serious
you're being about
all of it.

And, of course, I don't own this newsgroup
and you don't own yours. I know that.
That's why I merely said I'd
'welcome' you, if you played
by my rules. It was just a
'WELCOME' that I
was withholding
until you succumbed
to my reasonable
wishes, is, all.

You seem pretty volatile and you're still
being cryptic about stuff, for no

If you've said how old you
are, already, why not
just say, approximately!?
Why must you make
people work for such
general info!? Just
say what decade you're
in, age-wise, Girl!!

And, I assume, &quot;Marika&quot;, is only a
girl's name, correct!? Oh well.
I still don't know you well
enough for breakfast.
Maybe, at a later date.
After I've seen a picture
of you!! (--Hee Hee--)

Anywho, what does your Dad, do!?
I saw you mention him to,
Clown. What was that
all about, exactly!?
You see, that kind
of stuff is just
needlessly
cryptic and
mysterious.
I don't like that.

Anyway, I know you MUST be in
at least your late 20's or
early 30's, correct!?
Just based on what
I've read from you,
I'd guess, between
36 to 44, or so. But,
I've never seen your
actual age, in a post
from you, that I
recall. But, it's
clear you're an
older adult,
(not, ancient,
but, older than
19 or early 20's,
certainly), and,
you're very
well-read,
obviously. But,
if I am at all
mistaken in
any of that,

now.

Sheesh, Marika, I didn't think you were
being so serious about you
wanting to go for breakfast
with Me. That reminds me
of a time, when I was quite
young and inexperienced
and walking down
the street and some
girl, cooed from
her porch--: &quot;Can
I make breakfast on
your face!?&quot; Or she
may said &quot;....on your
head&quot;....!? Or
something, like,
that, and, later,
I come to find
out, I was wrong
to be afraid she was
going to throw an
egg at Me!! She
was just somewhat
crudely or cryptically
saying she wanted
me to eat her out.
At least that's
what someone
told me she
meant. But,
I would have
still checked
for a surprise
prank egg,
even if
she literally
pulled her
pants
down and
sat atop
my face,
right in the
street!! ....I am just
cautious like that.

Anywho, The Clown is *NOT*
*MY* Sock Cock Puppet,
And I Am, Of Course,
*NOT* *HIS* Sock Cock
Puppet, (I Emphatically
Assure You Of
That)....!!

And, I really wasn't sure how sarcastic
you were being with the &quot;Hate&quot;
comment. I thought you might
have taken it harder than
I was intending. And I
still don't know what
your point was with
that link to Computer
World. Seriously.

And, now, that you've reacted even
more sensitively to my latest
response, I am STILL not
sure how overly-sensitive
and overly-serious
you're being about
all of it.

And, of course, I don't own this newsgroup
and you don't own yours. I know that.
That's why I merely said I'd
'welcome' you, if you played
by my rules. It was just a
'WELCOME' that I
was withholding
until you succumbed
to my reasonable
wishes, is, all.

You seem pretty volatile and you're still
being cryptic about stuff, for no
reason. Don't play games.
If you've said how old you
are, already, why not
just say, approximately!?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Marika, I saw your recent post to
&gt; Me on another news-server,
&gt; but, it hasn't shown up
&gt; yet on this one, which is
&gt; why I am now responding
&gt; to the last post from
&gt; Me in the thread
&gt; (And, I explain all
&gt; of that, since,
&gt; I know how you
&gt; computer geeks
&gt; notice those kinds
&gt; of inconsequentially
&gt; unimportant goober
&gt; boob things).

&gt; (--Hee Hee--)

&gt; Now, Then--: You said something about
&gt; &quot;two&quot; &quot;hate&quot; posts from Me....!?
&gt; Uhhhh....No. Not even
&gt; one!! That last time
&gt; you posted in here
&gt; that I was talking
&gt; about; that time,
&gt; I never responded
&gt; about you or even
&gt; acknowledged
&gt; your post at
&gt; all. I made no
&gt; comment about
&gt; it, back then.
&gt; Period.
&gt; And, those
&gt; last three
&gt; posts (two
&gt; were mere
&gt; typo-corrected
&gt; and//or slightly
&gt; updated versions
&gt; of the first post
&gt; about you in
&gt; this thread);
&gt; THAT post
&gt; was NOT
&gt; a HATE
&gt; post at all!!
&gt; It was just
&gt; an honestly
&gt; sardonic
&gt; critiquing
&gt; of you, as
&gt; I've reacted
&gt; to you, so far.
&gt; It was meant
&gt; to be stingingly
&gt; funny, but not
&gt; hateful towards
&gt; you. It was
&gt; more of
&gt; a virtual
&gt; spank than
&gt; an out-an-out
&gt; virtual punch,
&gt; for sure.

&gt; Now, as far as, that other techno-geek
&gt; Computer World nonsense, you'll
&gt; have to come down to Earth,
&gt; Ms. Spock Spore Brain
&gt; and translate for normal
&gt; folks like Me!! You know,
&gt; I sincerely hope to
&gt; gradually, virtually
&gt; shock you out of that
&gt; creepy techno-geek
&gt; mode that you've been
&gt; in for way too many
&gt; years, Marika!!
&gt; Seriously, Girl,
&gt; you must want
&gt; to be set Free
&gt; from some of that,
&gt; don't you!? It's just
&gt; not right for you
&gt; to be wasting away
&gt; into a poor imitation
&gt; of Jodie Foster in
&gt; that one Astronaut
&gt; movie she did!!
&gt; (i.e. 'CONTACT')
&gt; Did SHE wear
&gt; pampers in that
&gt; movie!? I forget.
&gt; Do you wear
&gt; pampers!?

&gt; I assume you are a 40-something,
&gt; perhaps, 30-something year old,
&gt; correct!? And you do some
&gt; kind of computer type
&gt; of work for a living,
&gt; correct!?

&gt; Anywho, just TRY to talk in normal
&gt; English, and elaborate about
&gt; that Computer World &quot;list&quot;
&gt; crack you made
&gt; and tell us
&gt; what that link was
&gt; supposed to be. (As
&gt; most folks here with any
&gt; self-respect DO NOT go
&gt; clicking just any ol' link
&gt; placed before their
&gt; eyes on here,
&gt; Marika!!
&gt; Sheesh.

&gt; And, finally, I DO know what a
&gt; sig. file, is, so, I don't know
&gt; what you're implying
&gt; there. I said
&gt; 'signature line' as a
&gt; way to describe
&gt; the positioning of
&gt; your quotes, NOT,
&gt; as a totally technical
&gt; description, Girl!!

&gt; Anywho, it looks like YOU'RE about
&gt; the only poster at that
&gt; 'Lester' newsgroup,
&gt; Marika, so why
&gt; do you stay and
&gt; try to artificially
&gt; pump-up the posts
&gt; through pinching
&gt; posts from other
&gt; newsgroups!?

&gt; ....And, AGAIN, I very NICELY said
&gt; (WITH NO HATE AT
&gt; ALL); I VERY SWEETLY,
&gt; said, I'd welcome you
&gt; HERE, Girl, if you'd just
&gt; COMMIT to THIS
&gt; newsgroup,
&gt; exclusively,
&gt; when you
&gt; post
&gt; here!!

&gt; I believe you're an actual FEMALE,
&gt; for real, (which is pretty
&gt; AMAZING for THIS
&gt; place) and I think
&gt; you have potential,
&gt; beyond your
&gt; lamely creepy
&gt; techno-jargonized
&gt; computer-girl
&gt; geekiness!!
&gt; And, believe Me,
&gt; I don't just hand
&gt; out semi-compliments
&gt; like that-there,
&gt; left and right, My
&gt; Sugar-Cookie-Kins!!

&gt; Anyhow, I like the name, Marika.
&gt; So, that's a start. (--Hee Hee--)

&gt; Oh, by the way, that paragraph where
&gt; I talk about how you grab people
&gt; off of one street, etc., and, then,
&gt; it ends with--: &quot;How Dare She!!&quot;
&gt; Upon reading that back--:
&gt; I, honestly, pictured
&gt; Dane Cook, doing
&gt; that paragraph
&gt; (and a few other
&gt; paragraphs within
&gt; that same area).
&gt; And I am not
&gt; even a fan
&gt; of him. But, the
&gt; few times he's been
&gt; funny, it was one of
&gt; those kinds of jokes
&gt; or comments. Those
&gt; parts of my post
&gt; reminded me
&gt; of him. It was his
&gt; kind of an analogy
&gt; and//or attitude
&gt; that he would
&gt; perform or write
&gt; or have written
&gt; for him. And
&gt; MY kind of an
&gt; analogy and//or
&gt; attitude,
&gt; obviously.
&gt; But, I only
&gt; mention him,
&gt; because, he's
&gt; famous
&gt; nationally,
&gt; and, I
&gt; am NOT,
&gt; famous
&gt; nationally.
&gt; Yet.

&gt; So, I was flattering
&gt; myself, by comparing
&gt; myself to someone
&gt; much more famous
&gt; than I am.

&gt; Anywho, my point, was, there, that,
&gt; even as egotistical as I am, I
&gt; sometimes, hear other
&gt; comics or commentators
&gt; in my head, besides
&gt; my OWN voice, when I
&gt; read out-loud some
&gt; of my original
&gt; material. I see
&gt; the similarities
&gt; I have with other
&gt; writers and//or
&gt; performers and
&gt; such. It's the
&gt; same way,
&gt; in music writing,
&gt; too. I hear something
&gt; I've just recorded,
&gt; and it will, sometimes,
&gt; somewhat loosely
&gt; remind me of
&gt; another artist.

&gt; Anyway, your quotes from other
&gt; writers, are really not always
&gt; bad picks at all, but, I just
&gt; feel you use that as
&gt; too much of a crutch
&gt; to hide behind. Much,
&gt; like you're hiding there,
&gt; in that godforsaken
&gt; 'Lester Blackhole'
&gt; (Which is almost
&gt; empty save
&gt; for YOU
&gt; and all of
&gt; those pinched
&gt; posts you've
&gt; rudely
&gt; grabbed
&gt; away from
&gt; other, more
&gt; vibrant
&gt; places).

&gt; I mean, it just seems that you want
&gt; to be so indirect that you
&gt; often use largely obscure
&gt; quotes to get across
&gt; some severely vague
&gt; position you have in
&gt; your mind, that you're
&gt; afraid to just spit out
&gt; yourself, directly
&gt; and assuredly,
&gt; in no uncertain
&gt; terms....!!

It wasn't sad or desperate, dumb ass.
And I challenge you to elaborate on
why you're jealously saying
it is, dumbie. I was being
very entertainingly
critical of, &quot;Marika&quot;.
How is that desperate
in the slightest!? I
wasn't doing anything
but being honestly
critical of Marika,
in a humorous way,
in every single post.
Period. You're just

Curtie, you're reminding me
severely, of, Vacuously
Vacant Vincey, and all
of his doubly dumb,
jealousy-induced
throwaway negative
postings.

Try posting
something just
half as funny and
original as any
of my humorous
and original posts,
and I'll be very
impressed,
dumb ass.

If I thought you had any
talent for writing yourself,
I might take what you say
as having some meaning
to someone. But, it
would still not
mean anything
to Me, even if
you DID, miraculously,
at some point, display
any talent, yourself.
Because, you're just
expressing your
jealousies
and//or
your general
dislike for
various
posters, so,
it's not at all
any kind of
effectual
critiquing
of actual
content.

Also, actually, your recent,
annoyingly dumb
spate of useless
throwaway posts,
(because you have
nothing worthwhile
and original to
say or do at
all) reminded
me of this one
annoying and
way-geeky,
way-gay guy
acquaintance
of my ex-fiancee's.
So, anywho,
see, me and my
fiancee (at the time),
were at this party, and,
this guy was the odd
man out dude at
the party; the
perpetually
single and lonely
guy. He looked
liked an ugly, shorter
version of Andy Dick,
but, without ANY of
Andy's natural talents
for being funny.
This guy was just
a totally annoying
ultra-gooberish and
geeky looking and
acting dude. So, at this
party, he did this one
lame thing all evening--:
He'd go around to
everyone at the party
and offer them
a mint from
this mint dish,
he was holding.
And he'd say--:
&quot;Would you like
a mint!?&quot; And,
most would say &quot;No&quot;
and just hope he'd
move along, but, he
stayed in your
face, and, said it,
again, this time,
saying--: &quot;I think
you REALLY need
a mint!!&quot; Implying
that just about
everyone at the
party had bad
breath (he
seemed to be
purposely
bugging
the coolest
people
at the party
who had
actual
lives and good looking
dates; he seemed to be
going up to THOSE
folks (like ME) the
very most, with
that incessantly
annoying
and dumb
gag). ....Again,
dumbly
implying
that just about
everyone but
HIM had bad
breath was
the ENTIRE
gist of his
dumb gag.
And THAT is,
basically, (in
essence) the
ultra-dumb gist of YOUR
lame and unfunny gag
about 'Quality Control'.
YOU are that geeky
and dateless gay
guy at that party.
Trying so gooberishly
to insult anyone and
everyone who you
are jealous of, mainly.
But, you include others,
just to be even more
annoying.
Period.

And, it's not surprising, the one person,
you complimented, was, Clown.
The one person you are not
jealous of. Because, HIS
life, is, amazingly, even
more ultra-pathetic
than yours. So, you
feel like you can
compliment HIM!!
You can compliment
a Generic and
Unemployed
Bozo Clown.
There's no
competition
felt within your
ultra-insecure
mind,
from a
Lonely
Clown!!

Buh-Bye For Now, You, Lonely Geek
Clown-Lover, You!!
