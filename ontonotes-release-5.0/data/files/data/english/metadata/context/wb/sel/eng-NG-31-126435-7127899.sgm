Expectations

"My serenity is inversely proportional
to my expectations.
The higher my expectations of other people are,
the lower is my serenity.
I can watch my serenity level rise
when I discard my expectations.
But then my 'rights' try to move in,
and they, too, can force my serenity level down.
I have to discard my 'rights,'
as well as my expectations, by asking myself,
'How important is it, really?
How important is it compared to my serenity,
my emotional sobriety?'
And when I place more value on my serenity and sobriety
than on anything else,
I can maintain them at a higher level--
at least for the time being."
Alcoholics Anonymous, 3rd Edition p. 452

Thought to Consider . . .

From “When A.A. Came of Age”:

“At this point the Cleveland Plain Dealer ran a series of pieces that ushered
in a new period for Alcoholics Anonymous, the era of mass production of
sobriety.

“Elrick B. Davis, a feature writer of deep understanding, was the author of a
series of articles that were printed in the middle of the Plain Dealer’s
editorial page, and these were accompanied every two or three days by red-hot
blasts from the editors themselves. In effect, the Plain Dealer was saying, ‘
Alcoholics Anonymous is good, and it works.  Come and get it.’

“The newspaper’s switchboard was deluged. Day and night, the calls were
relayed to [early members] Clarence and Dorothy and from them to members of their
little group.”

*~*~*~*~*^Daily Reflections^*~*~*~*~*
HAPPINESS IS NOT THE POINT

I don't think happiness or unhappiness is the point.  How do we meet the
problems we face? How do we best learn from them and transmit what we have learned
to others, if they would receive the knowledge?

AS BILL SEES IT, p.  306

In my search "to be happy," I changed jobs, married and divorced, took
geographical cures, and ran myself into debt-financially, emotionally and
spiritually.  In A.A., I'm learning to grow up.  Instead of demanding that people,
places and things make me happy, I can ask God for self-acceptance.  When a problem
overwhelms me, A.A.'s Twelve Steps will help me grow through the pain.  The
knowledge I gain can be a gift to others who suffer with the same problem.  As
Bill said, "When pain comes, we are expected to learn from it willingly, and
help others to learn.  When happiness comes, we accept it as a gift, and thank
God for it."  (As Bill Sees It, p.  306)

Each Man's Vision

"Beyond a Higher Power, as each of us may vision Him, A.A. must never, as a
society, enter the field of dogma or theology. We can never become a religion
in that sense, lest we kill usefulness by getting bogged down in theological
contention."
<<<>>>
"The really amazing fact about A.A. is that all religions see in our program
a resemblance to themselves. For example, Catholic theologians declare our
Twelve Steps to be in exact accord with their Ignatian Exercises for Retreat, and
though our book reeks of sin, sickness, and death, the Christian Science
Monitor has often praised it editorially.
"Now, looking through Quaker eyes, you, too, see us favorably. What happy
circumstances, these!"

*~*~*~*~*^ Big Book Quote ^*~*~*~*~*

"Next, we decided that hereafter in this drama of life, God was going
to be our Director. He is the Principal; we are His agents. He is
the Father, and we are His children. Most good ideas are simple, and
this concept was the keystone of the new and triumphant arch through
which we passed to freedom."

~Alcoholics Anonymous, 4th Edition, How It Works, pg. 62~

A.A. Thought for the Day

The A.A. program is one of submission, release, and action. When were
drinking, we're submitting to a power greater than ourselves, liquor. Our own wills
are no use against the power of liquor. One drink and we're sunk. in A.A. we
stop submitting to the power of liquor. Instead, we submit to a Power, also
greater than ourselves, which we call God. Have I submitted myself to that Higher
Power?

Meditation for the Day

Ceaseless activity is not God's plan for your life. Times of withdrawal for
renewed strength are always necessary. Wait for the faintest tremor of fear and
stop all work, everything, and rest before God until you are strong again.
Deal in the same way with all tired feelings. Then you need rest of body and
renewal of spirit force. Saint Paul said: "I can do all things through Him who
strengthens me." This does not mean that you are to do all things and then rely
on God to find strength. it means that you are to do the things you believe
God wants you to do and only then can you rely on His supply of power.

Prayer for the Day

I pray that God's spirit may be my master always. I pray that I may learn how
to rest and listen, as well as how to work.
