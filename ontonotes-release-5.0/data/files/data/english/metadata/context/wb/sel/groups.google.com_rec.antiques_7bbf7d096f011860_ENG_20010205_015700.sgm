Hi, all. There's been an interesting thread running in the Yugo
mailing list (egad! is he everywhere??!!) and it occurred to me that
it might even be sort of OT here. The question was: What was your
first car?

My own was a 1936 Ford, a two-door slantback sedan. I paid $125 for
it, gathering the money together by cashing in some old war bonds.

The year was 1952, and I had a learner's permit but no driver's
license. My long-suffering grandfather (who looked just like Winston
Churchill, cigar and all) was teaching me to drive in his 1936
Chrysler sedan, and he searched out and found the Ford -- perhaps
as a measure of self-preservation -- for sale in a gas station at 13th
and Tilghman Streets in Allentown, Pa.

The guys who were selling it had restored the little Ford nicely,
putting on green sisal seat covers and upholstering the doorpanels
with marbelized green oilcloth. They had painted the body with a
mixture of all the paint they could lay hands on for free. The color
turned out to be a kind of greenish olive-drab, but it took an
absolutely great shine. And I polished it and polished it. I loved
that car!

I also spruced up the engine compartment, painting the 85-horse
flathead V8 engine Ford blue, and doing some accents with gold paint
meant for household radiators. Twas beautiful, but it taught me the
early lesson (I was 16) that one does not paint carburetor linkage.

For reasons that are totally beyond my ken, I never took a picture of
the car. That's been bumming me for years. But I did drive it hard,
including nightly drag races all the way through town on Linden
Street, for a couple of years before finally twisting off a rear axle
shaft.

When that happened, I actually junked the car. Arghhh. Can you
imagine junking a '36 Ford? But I replaced it with a black '48
Mercury coupe that was like new, and that car is the favorite of all
the many cars I have owned in the past (gasp!) 49 years.

Marshall,
I can beat that price, I bought my first car for $10.00. ( it had a
full tank of gas)
It was my brothers car, and it broke. But the gas tank was full. 1960
Ford Station wagon. Great car. It cost me $20.00 to get it road worthy.
The transmission fluid had to be filled :-). My friends and I painted
this baby with rustoleum paints. We put a hugh orange bare foot on the
roof, and all different kinds of designs all over it. Eyes on the front,
so we could see where we were going. A pigs butt on the back so everyone
else could see it. Paisleys all over it. A stick of dynamite buy the gas
tank. Dynamite was my nickname before dorass. We named it Pig Wagon, we
had to cover the &quot;pi&quot; when we were near my friend father, he said a pig
wagon was what they called the vehicle that brought the women to them
during WW2.
I DO HAVE PICS, now I need to find a way to put them here for you to
see.

Doris

I've always wanted to be somebody,
I should have been more specific.

&gt;me that it might even be sort of OT here. The question was:
&gt;What was your first car?

"/> My first car was a 1965 Mustang coupe, with red vinyl
interior. It had 8500 miles on it when I bought it in for
$2150. Oh, what a beautiful machine! Bright, shiny,
always clean. How many 18-year-old girls washed and waxed
their car every week. How many girls put chrome wheels
on their cars?

That car and I went through 13 wrecks together, none
serious and all reparable. Lots of cruising up and down
Washington Blvd.

The music of an AM-radio, and an 8-track. The flashing
psychedelic &quot;light bar&quot; that pulsed to the music of the
radio/tapes. Two speakers pounding out digested
music - I don't know if Her Majesty really requested the
Stones, but I did.

For all of the 135,000 miles I put on that car, it only left
the state of Utah twice (once to Elko Nevada when my
husband and I got married, and to Jackson Wyoming a
few months later). In 1975, we brought our newborn
daughter home from the hospital in it (that silly Opel GT
just didn't have room for events like that!).

Oh, I loved that car.

And still do.

It sits next to the Rover in the garage, but hasn't been
driven for about ten years. My husband may complain
about it, but he's still got his Norton 750cc Commander
in the shed.

My dream is to have it *correctly* restored (which will
probably cost more than many new cars) and drive it
coast to coast. No more half-done jobs which make
things worse. I'll have to win the lottery or start taking
contributions, I guess.

totalled when I was 18 by an unlicensed 14 year old that ran a stop light.
I wish I would have made the insurance pay to fix it up (the frame wasn't
tweaked too badly), instead of simply totaling it and giving me the money.
Darn.

&gt; I never had my very own car until after I got married - showing my
&gt; age, aren't I? In MY day (I love that expression), girls didn't have
&gt; cars - they had boyfriends or dads who had cars.

&gt; Each of my brothers had a car - but they wouldn't let me drive them
&gt; because they were stick-shift, and I couldn't drive a stick.

&gt; I learned to drive on my dad's 195? Plymouth that had &quot;push button
&gt; drive.&quot;

&gt; My first car of my very own was a 1976 Granada (before that, I had the
&gt; use of the family 1970 station wagon, as my husband had his own &quot;work&quot;
&gt; car - a POS named &quot;Farley,&quot; that was some kind of mini-Studebaker.

&gt; N.

"/> My first vehicle was a 1967 Suzuki 80cc Street/trail bike which I rode
winter and summer ( what a lunatic I was at 16). My Dad and I restored the
thing from from the ground up for a grand total of $210.27 and it took
127 hours. I blew the motor three times before I upgraded to a 250cc
Suzuki X6, which sounded like a chainsaw in heat and could out drag
anything ( and I did) on the road up to about 60 mph. I recently spotted a
completely restored &quot;80&quot; in a trade paper for $ 950.00, I'm tempted, but I
think I'll ride it only after the roads are plowed. ;~)) Man! I love old
Bikes.

Dad bought me a '65 lavender Corvair. I can't remember how many miles it had
on it. It was a stick and I didn't have any idea how to drive it. The minute
I got the keys I drove it around and around the back yard trying to get the
hang of a stick shift and clutch. An hour later I was on the open road. That
car took us everywhere on 50 cents worth of gas.

(1) A red 1949(?) B.S.A. Bantam Motorbike. I worked all one summer
holiday when I was 16 to buy that thing. Beautiful to look at, wonderful
to ride but like with all British Bikes you spent as much time on the
side of the road fixing it as riding it. God I miss my Beezer!

(2) A 30 ft gaff rigged, clinker built ex-ships dinghy when I was 14
that my grandfather bought in auction on a whim and presented to me.
Called it 'The Incredible Hulk'. Every winter after scraping it and
repainting I used to have to sink it for a fortnight to allow the boards
to swell up again.

"/> My next bike was a BSA 650; It had a sidecar from which we removed the
body and bolted on a car door. To this I bolted on the bucket front
passenger seat out of an old junkyard Ford. It was some ride as a
passenger with nothing to hold onto and nothing in front of you. 10
minutes in that chair and any girl was putty in your hands. The first
time I ever rode that bike I did not realise you had to compensate for
the weight of the sidecar and was pulled through a hedge and into a beet
field.

At that time in England if you had L-plates you were not allowed to ride
a bike unaccompanied any more powerful than 250cc. A loophole in the law
allowed those who had not passed their test to drive any size bike as
long as it had a sidecar.

Ah happy days. Don't tell Tim I didn't usually wear a helmet either :-)

I would freak out my friends by hitting reverse while going about 30.
Nothing would happen due to a safety feature built in for dummies.
That car was a lot of bondo, sheet metal, and window screen topped
off by black rustoleum paint. Paid $50 &amp; painted a guy's house for it.

The next car was a lot more fun, though: a '65 Triumph Vitesse 6.

"/> HiMarshall,

My first motorized job was one of the old whizzer motobikes in1949. I spent
a huge amount of time trying to keep it running. It always leaked gas from
somewhere. I would get one spot fixed and it would start anew in another.
You had to learn to keep your legs away from the metal parts of the engine
and exaust. (Ouch). It was built on the frame of a Schwinn bicycle. I wish
I still had it though. The popular ride of the times was the cushman
scooter, but I couldn't reach that far on my pocketbook.
My first car was a 1955 mercury hardtop, black and yellow (oh no!!)
Memories are nice of the fun times in that rig.

(*&lt;~ I learned to drive the family car in 1961 at the age of 16.It was
a 1956 Chevy Bel-Air. I bought my own 1st car in 1964 while stationed at
Cherry Point,N.C. It was a Studebaker ( I 'think' ) with a dashboard
'pushbutton transmission'. I had begged my parents for months for enough
money to buy some wheels in this desolate outpost and they had finally
come across. It was $250 WELL spent... imo
I took it out for a run one friday night and stopped at a 'Dairy
Queen' style hamburger &amp; maltshop place,where the girls roller-skated up
to your take &amp; deliver your order. I struck up a quick friendship with
MY skate-queen, a svelte 200-250 lb. jocular snowflake of a girl. In
1964, there were about 500 servicemen to every 'available' girl in this
area and beggers couldn't be choosers.
I met MY snowflake when she got off work and we headed out along the
coast highway,with the Atlantic ocean a only a stones throw off to our
right. It was warm and windy and with no working radio, we talked and
flirted with each other. I drove &amp; drove,until I'd left all signs of
civilization far behind us. I came upon a single lane blacktop road that
jutted out into the Atlantic Ocean for what appeared to be at least a
mile. It ended at a small radar installation.
I drove about halfway out this road and then turned off onto the beach
and drove down to the water's edge. It was very windy and had started to
rain.How romantic. We put the windows nearly all the way up,climbed into
the backseat and promptly started to steam up all the windows. I was in
'snowflake' heaven. We could hear the wind,the rain and the waves. It
was VERY romantic. We had the my old 'new car' rockin' &amp; rollin' to the
rhythm of the falling rain. Did I mention that it was TOO romantic...
imo We could hear the waves lapping (if you had VERY good hearing,you
could have heard US lapping also).
We had finally 'slaked our thirst' (as Cpl.Radar O'Reilly might say)
and we climbed exhausted back into the front seat. I turned the key and
nothing happened. I tried again. Nothing. My little snowflake,that had
become my little sweaty-pie was turning into a sceaming banshee. I open
the door to check under the hood (I don't know what I was checking FOR)
and stepped into water above my knees. Now, I was outscreaming this half
dressed tub-o-lard sitting in MY car,which now had water streaming
inside and covering my floorboards. It was much windier and the waves
were starting to CRASH onto the beach AND MY NEW CAR.
I saw some headlights coming down the road from from the direction of
the radar staion out at the end. Fatso and I ran up the beach and onto
the road. A jeep with two servicemen in it stopped and told us that a
hurricane was heading straight at that area and that they had been
ordered to evacuate their radar station. All weekend liberty had been
cancelled and all enlisted men were ordered back to their base. They
only had room in their jeep for one person and they took Jumbo and left
me standing wet and lost on a long loney jetty road in pouring down rain
and gale force winds. I sat down on a jetty rock and wondered what my
best plan of action should be. The waves were now crashing on,over and
beyond MY car. In a very short time, I saw MY car starting to bob up &amp;
down with each new wave and as each new wave started to return to the
sea,it took MY car a little further out into the Atlantic Ocean. I
watched it bob itself right out of sight,never to be seen again. I
walked down that lonely road until I reached an equally deserted coast
highway. No traffic in either direction. I started to walk towards the
base,which was MANY miles away. I'd never reach it on foot. I came
across an old wooden phone booth at the road's edge and got inside out
of the weather. I was cold and wet and hungry and depressed. Every 30 or
45 minutes I could see headlights approaching and I'd run out into the
road and wave my arms frantically and stick my thumb out for a ride. Not
only didn't anyone stop,but they splashed me even wetter (if that were
possible). No change for the phone and things looking more bleak by the
moment. I sat down in the floor of the booth and felt very sorry for
myself and all the future sweat hogs that wouldn't have the chance to
enjoy the sins of the flesh in MY new car.....
I finally called the operator and asked her to call the
base,collect.Noone would accept the charges and finally the operator
simply put the call through. They sent a truck out to pick me up. There
truly was 'no place like home' and another day in my life came to an
end. As I look back,I realize that EVERY day in my life has been an
adventure of one sort or another. Don't get me started.
Thanks for reminding me of MY first car, ' I think '.......

&gt; I took it out for a run one friday night and stopped at a 'Dairy
&gt;Queen' style hamburger &amp; maltshop place,where the girls roller-skated up
&gt;to your take &amp; deliver your order. I struck up a quick friendship with
&gt;MY skate-queen, a svelte 200-250 lb. jocular snowflake of a girl. In
&gt;1964, there were about 500 servicemen to every 'available' girl in this
&gt;area and beggers couldn't be choosers.
&gt; I met MY snowflake when she got off work and we headed out along the
&gt;coast highway,with the Atlantic ocean a only a stones throw off to our
&gt;right. It was warm and windy and with no working radio, we talked and
&gt;flirted with each other. I drove &amp; drove,until I'd left all signs of
&gt;civilization far behind us. I came upon a single lane blacktop road that
&gt;jutted out into the Atlantic Ocean for what appeared to be at least a
&gt;mile. It ended at a small radar installation.
&gt; I drove about halfway out this road and then turned off onto the beach
&gt;and drove down to the water's edge. It was very windy and had started to
&gt;rain.How romantic. We put the windows nearly all the way up,climbed into
&gt;the backseat and promptly started to steam up all the windows. I was in
&gt;'snowflake' heaven. We could hear the wind,the rain and the waves. It
&gt;was VERY romantic. We had the my old 'new car' rockin' &amp; rollin' to the
&gt;rhythm of the falling rain. Did I mention that it was TOO romantic...
&gt;imo We could hear the waves lapping (if you had VERY good hearing,you
&gt;could have heard US lapping also).
&gt; We had finally 'slaked our thirst' (as Cpl.Radar O'Reilly might say)
&gt;and we climbed exhausted back into the front seat. I turned the key and
&gt;nothing happened. I tried again. Nothing. My little snowflake,that had
&gt;become my little sweaty-pie was turning into a sceaming banshee. I open
&gt;the door to check under the hood (I don't know what I was checking FOR)
&gt;and stepped into water above my knees. Now, I was outscreaming this half
&gt;dressed tub-o-lard sitting in MY car,which now had water streaming
&gt;inside and covering my floorboards. It was much windier and the waves
&gt;were starting to CRASH onto the beach AND MY NEW CAR.
&gt; I saw some headlights coming down the road from from the direction of
&gt;the radar staion out at the end. Fatso and I ran up the beach and onto
&gt;the road. A jeep with two servicemen in it stopped and told us that a
&gt;hurricane was heading straight at that area and that they had been
&gt;ordered to evacuate their radar station. All weekend liberty had been
&gt;cancelled and all enlisted men were ordered back to their base. They
&gt;only had room in their jeep for one person and they took Jumbo and left
&gt;me standing wet and lost on a long loney jetty road in pouring down rain
&gt;and gale force winds. I sat down on a jetty rock and wondered what my
&gt;best plan of action should be. The waves were now crashing on,over and
&gt;beyond MY car. In a very short time, I saw MY car starting to bob up &amp;
&gt;down with each new wave and as each new wave started to return to the
&gt;sea,it took MY car a little further out into the Atlantic Ocean. I
&gt;watched it bob itself right out of sight,never to be seen again. I
&gt;walked down that lonely road until I reached an equally deserted coast
&gt;highway. No traffic in either direction. I started to walk towards the
&gt;base,which was MANY miles away. I'd never reach it on foot. I came
&gt;across an old wooden phone booth at the road's edge and got inside out
&gt;of the weather. I was cold and wet and hungry and depressed. Every 30 or
&gt;45 minutes I could see headlights approaching and I'd run out into the
&gt;road and wave my arms frantically and stick my thumb out for a ride. Not
&gt;only didn't anyone stop,but they splashed me even wetter (if that were
&gt;possible). No change for the phone and things looking more bleak by the
&gt;moment. I sat down in the floor of the booth and felt very sorry for
&gt;myself and all the future sweat hogs that wouldn't have the chance to
&gt;enjoy the sins of the flesh in MY new car.....
&gt; I finally called the operator and asked her to call the
&gt;base,collect.Noone would accept the charges and finally the operator
&gt;simply put the call through. They sent a truck out to pick me up. There
&gt;truly was 'no place like home' and another day in my life came to an
&gt;end. As I look back,I realize that EVERY day in my life has been an
&gt;adventure of one sort or another. Don't get me started.
&gt; Thanks for reminding me of MY first car, ' I think '.......

"/> Jeez, Doug, that would have been a great story if it hadn't been so infused
with loathing for a young woman who did nothing but give you pleasure.
