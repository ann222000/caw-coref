Here it is: Chapter 15 final draft, complete with all the formatting
errors that copying and pasting causes.  C&amp;C welcome, of course.
-----
Commander Dodge and Ranma waited in one of the Star Destroyer's
conference rooms, while mess droids and stewards brought in carafes of
coffee and tea, pastries, and water.  The Wild Stallion's first
officer sat near the head of the table, a steaming cup of coffee
already in front of him.  There actually is life in this galaxy, Ranma
mused, while watching a flight of ARC-170s fly past the flagship on
patrol.  Baka, you should have known that anyway.  After all, the
chances of life-bearing planets are just as high as that in our home
galaxy.

But is that galaxy truly our home anymore?  After all, it's nothing
but pain and suffering there.  At least with this galaxy, there's a
chance to head it off, to eliminate the threat of the Empire, and form
a federation of planets united in defense and trade, and perhaps even
send help to the Rebellion in our home galaxy.

Dodge looked over at Ranma, standing at a viewport, literally staring
off into space.  "Nervous, General," he asked.

Ranma chuckled.  "You have no idea, Commander.  This was what the
Republic's Outbound Flight mission was designed to do: discover extra-
galactic civilizations, and make contact with them.  Six Jedi Masters
and a dozen Knights, trained in First Contact scenarios, the like that
hadn't been seen in the thousand generations that the Republic had
stood.  When we lost contact with the mission, the Jedi turned inward,
looking towards the maintenance of the Republic; turning their back on
exploration and First Contact.  The loss of 18 Jedi was an almost
crippling event, especially since the new ways prevented Jedi from
love of a single person, and sustaining the Order through birth."

Dodge looked at Ranma with a questioning gaze, but decided not to
interrupt in hopes of clearing the confusion he was feeling.  Ranma
scoffed, as he continued to stare out over the hull of his flagship.
"Our introspection was a joke.  We couldn't even see the Sith Lord
hidden in plain sight, manipulating the Trade Federation into invading
Naboo, building up a clone army in secret, and manipulating the
Separatists into instigating the Clone Wars.

"Now, it's up to me to see, a member of the Special Operations
Executive, about establishing diplomatic ties with an alien race."
Ranma adjusted his robes, turning as the door slid open.  Captain
T'Mir stood with her Marine escort at the threshold.  "Captain T'Mir,
welcome aboard the Wild Stallion.  I am General Ranma Lim, Jedi
Master, and commander of the Earth Defense Force.  May I introduce the
ship's executive officer, currently in command, Commander Thomas
Dodge?"

"Ma'am," Dodge said, with a courteous bow.

"General, Commander," T'Mir replied, her hands behind her.  Ranma sat
down at the head of the table.  "Captain, please be seated," he said,
motioning to a chair across from Dodge.  "How can we help," he asked
as T'Mir sat.

"My government has authorized me to request asylum from the Terran
government for myself, my crew, and passengers aboard the T'Ever," she
said, flatly.

"Perhaps, instead of requesting asylum, you could establish a
government-in-exile and alliance with the Earth government.  We were
preparing to jump to 40 Eridani to relieve your system."

T'Mir's eyebrow went up.  "Really?"

"Yes ma'am," Ranma replied.  "One of our ships, the Prometheus,
recorded what was probably a distress call, coming from what we call
40 Eridani. The captain launched one of his reconnaissance fighters to
check it out."  The display lit up, showing the recorded images from
Captain Hiller's reconnaissance of 40 Eridani.

"Yes, that is the force that has taken over our planet," T'Mir
confirmed.  "I was leery to initiate contact when I saw the
silhouettes of your vessels matching those that attacked our home
world."

Ranma smiled.  "Understandable.  Most of our ships came from Imperial
shipyards.  And we're going to use that against them."  The smile
faded, as he looked across the conference table at the alien captain.
"You can accompany us, or head to Earth, and begin negotiations with
the United Earth Government.  But, I cannot guarantee that they'll
listen, or that it'll be a short fight.  We're outnumbered by both men
and materiel, and neither the Empire nor EarthForce has many friends
here."

T'Mir appeared unflappable to the Jedi Master.  "General, as logical
as it would be to begin negotiations with your government on an
alliance, the needs of my planet outweighs the needs of my few
crewmembers or myself.  I request that we accompany you back to our
system.  A familiar face to the partisans, and free forces would be an
asset to your relief mission.

"I will, however, discuss your proposals with my crew and passengers."

"Captain T'Mir, welcome aboard," Ranma replied, a twinkle in his blue
eyes.  "I just need to know what to call your species to let my
superiors know who we are going to help."

The faintest of smiles grew on T'Mir's face, something
uncharacteristic had she been one of Roddenberry's Vulcans.  "The name
of our species does not translate easily into English.  However, one
of your crewmen called us 'Vulcans,' and that would be an acceptable
term for us."

"That will work.  Commander Dodge, please have quarters arranged for
Captain T'Mir and her company and crew; medical treatment for those
who require it."

"Certainly, General.  I take it we'll be leaving for 40 Eridani
shortly?"

Ranma nodded.  "Have Communications signal the fleet to begin jump
preparations; fleet speed will be Point Five."

"Understood, General," Dodge replied, as he stood.  "Captain T'Mir, if
you would accompany me, please?"

"Of course, Commander," the Vulcan captain said, as she stood as
well.  "General."

000000

"Commander Dodge, is the fleet ready," Ranma asked, as he moved to the
forward viewports of the Star Destroyer's bridge.

"Yes sir, the fleet is ready.  Communications has upgraded their
translation protocols to include the Vulcan language.  Tactical has
added silhouettes of all known Vulcan ship classes."

"Excellent.  Signal all ships: Make the jump to hyperspace."

"Yes sir."  Dodge relayed the order to the communications officer, and
with flickers of pseudomotion, the fleet began its run up to
lightspeed.  "Mr. Beech," Dodge ordered, as he leaned over the crew
pit, "engage."  And with the barest perception of movement, the mile
long battleship leapt into hyperspace.

"ETA to 40 Eridani 7 minutes, Commander," Mr. Beech relayed up from
his station.  "Assuming no unusual conditions lie between Sol and the
target system."

"Excellent, Lieutenant," Dodge replied.

Captain T'Mir walked on to the bridge of the Star Destroyer, and lost
her Vulcan stoicism as she took in the mottled, swirling "sky" of
hyperspace.  Ranma turned and faced the Vulcan emissary.  "Captain,"
he said.  "We should be arriving at 40 Eridani in approximately 5
minutes."

"General, just how fast are you traveling," she asked, still amazed
that a journey that took them 48 days would be accomplished in less
than a 15 Terran minutes.

"127 light-years an hour, give or take anomalous conditions, Captain,"
Lieutenant Beech replied.  "Our top speed is Point Five past
lightspeed, or approximately 1.2 million times the speed of light."

T'Mir's view on space travel was shattered by these revelations.
"Just how do you manage traveling this fast?  The best we've managed
is warp factor five, and that's on only a few ships, like the T'Ever."

Commander Embrar, the Wild Stallion's engineering officer, left his
station, and entered the conversation.  "Just how do you go faster
than light?"

"The theory would take too long to describe, but we warp space around
us, carrying a piece of relativistic "normal" space around our ship,
and then enter subspace."

"Ah, primitive, but functional," Embrar said.  T'Mir arched an eyebrow
at that.  "We enter a subspace where time flows differently, but there
are 'mass shadows' where stars, planets and other gravitational
anomalies exist.  Which is why we're able to go faster than your 'warp
space'."

"General," Mr. Beech called, "we're preparing to revert to normal
space."

"Very well.  Put me on intership."

"You're on, General."

"This is EarthForce Actual.  We're about to drop into a highly
contested chunk of space.  This will be our first foray against the
Empire; they are highly trained and motivated.  But so are we.  I know
you'll all do your duties, and bring credit upon the Earth Defense
Forces.

"The order is: All hands to Action Stations; set Condition One
throughout the ship.  Launch all fighters upon reversion to normal
space.  And may the Force be with us."

A muted alarm began sounding throughout the bridge and ship, as
bridge's lighting changed to red.  "General," Commander Chuikov called
from fleet tactical station, "all ships reporting in.  Condition One
set throughout the fleet."

"Fleet fighterrrs rrreporrrting in the grrreen," Wing Commander M'ret
reported.

"Reversion to normal space in 5...4...3...2...1...0...sublight engines online."

"All ships have reverted to normal space.  Fighters launching,
General." The Wild Stallion's snubfighters came up in an arcing climb
from her primary hangar bay as each squadron launched and formed up
under the flagship.  Similar scenes were occurring on the Star
Destroyers as the fighter division formed.

"Generrral, incoming TIE fighterrrs."

"Weapons free.  Detail Victory, Minuteman, and Airbat squadrons to
defend the flagship."

"Yes sirrr," the Caitian wing commander replied.

Space began to fill with verdant green laser and turbolaser bolts from
the combatant ships.  Y-Wings, ARC-170 and the precious few X-Wings
tangled with the vertical-winged TIE/ln fighters of the Imperial
Starfleet.  Blooms of fire appeared where fighter, both friend and
foe, were shot down.

"Communications," Ranma ordered from the holotable, "new orders for
the Star Destroyers: Form up on the flagship; alter course to 135 mark
275, ahead three-quarters.  Navigation, put us right in the middle of
my Imperial counterpart's formation, ahead three quarters.
Dreadnoughts and corvettes to make slashing flank attacks.  Parry
their smaller ships and older Acclamators."

"Aye sir," the ship began a rolling dive on to her new course, leading
her two sister Imperators and older siblings in the form of the 11
Victories.

"Star Destroyer force responding, General."

"Commander Embrar, I want the shields to remain up, without having to
roll the vessel.  Can it be down?"

"I'll see to it myself, General," Embrar replied.  He then left the
holotable and moved towards the aft blast door.

"Weapons, standby heavy turbolaser batteries-port and starboard
sides.  I want suppressive fire from all smaller batteries."

"Aye sir."

As the fleet closed on the Imperial force, the heavy turbolaser
batteries on the flanks of the dorsal and ventral hull begin rotating
into firing position.  The smaller batteries that comprised the bulk
of her firepower began intensifying their rate of fire.  TIE fighters
on their attack run against the Wild Stallion were caught off guard by
the increase in firepower; some managed to break off their attack
runs, others got winged and spun of into the depths of space, and yet
others were vaporized flat out.

The heavy turbolasers locked on to their first target- the Vicstars
Praetor and Ramilles.  20 green bolts of charged energy tore into the
shields of the older Imperial ships, and, as the Wild Stallion
continued her climb up through the Imperial column, walked up the aft
side of Praetor's command tower and Ramilles bow.  The older first
generation Victories weren't designed to withstand that sort of
pounding, originally designed to provide fire-support within an
atmosphere.  The Praetor's port sublight engine exploded, throwing the
vessel into a flat spin to starboard.  Additional volleys from the
Wild Stallion's heavy turbolasers ripped through her target's scanner
domes and peppered the command tower, venting large sections into
space.  The Praetor began to fall out of formation, as her engineers
and damage control teams tried to recover the crippled ship.

Her sister ship, the Ramilles, wasn't so lucky.  Multiple heavy
turbolaser bolts found their way into the warship's bridge,
obliterating all command and control for the Vicstar.  The ship began
to plummet out of formation, and rammed the Victor, splitting the
second ship in half.

A cheer went up on the bridge of the EarthForce flagship.  "At ease,"
Ranma called.  "There are still a helluva a lot of enemy ships in
orbit.

"Communications, signal the formation to forgo battle lines, and
attack.  All vessels attack."

"Aye sir."

T'Mir flinched involuntarily as a TIE fighter went screaming past the
bridge of the Wild Stallion, an ARC-170 hot on its tail.  The two
snubfighters passed so close, personnel near the bridge's viewports
could see the "612" and stylized bat painted on the nose of the former
Republic fighter.  "Definitely not the way I ever pictured a space
battle, Captain," Commander Dodge commented.  The line of battle fell
apart as individual ships broke formation and began hammering the
nearest counterpart.  The dozen EDF corvettes that Ranma took with
him, lead by the Prometheus, zipped between the larger ships, like
terrestrial destroyers in the midst of a great naval battle; the
Dreadnoughts slugged it out with larger Imperial ships, making use of
their design to absorb punishing blows that would have destroyed
lesser capable ships.

"Indeed, not, Commander," she replied.  "Our planet was taken by
surprise, before the High Command could launch our combat vessels.
And our last war was fought two centuries ago, in deep space against
the Andorians.  It was a much...neater affair."  Smaller blooms of fire
speckled the view from the Wild Stallion's bridge, as snubfighters,
both Imperial and EarthForce, died in self-feeding orgies of plasma.

"Commander Dodge," Ranma asked, motioning the flagship's XO over to
the holotable.  The battle hovered above the surface, showing the
fight in detail.

"Yes, General?"

"You notice this Imperator hanging back from the fight?"

"The Black Prince.  You think she's the command ship?"

"I'm almost certain of it," Ranma replied.  "Plot her coordinates and
prepare a microjump."

"General?"

"We did it quite successfully during the Clone Wars.  They won't
expect us to jump in.  They'll see our run up to lightspeed, and we'll
appear along their broadsides, turbolasers firing."

"Ah, sort of like the fictional Picard Maneuver, from Star Trek,"
Dodge replied.

"Exactly.  Navigation?"

"Coordinates plotted, General," Mr. Beech called.

"Execute on my mark.  Communications, inform Victory, Minuteman and
Airbat Squadrons of what we are planning.  Have them remain with the
fleet."

"Aye sir."

"Mr. Beech, execute."  The Wild Stallion II began its run up to
lightspeed, and shot into hyperspace, before immediately dropping out
of it next to her Imperial counterpart, the Black Prince.  "Starboard
batteries: Fire!"

The entire starboard side of the EF flagship lit up as her turbolasers
opened fire, bathing the Black Prince's shields in high energy
blasts.  The Wild Stallion's heavy batteries traversed on to the
target and opened fire.  Their slower rate of fire, but heavier
charge, pummeled the Imperial Imperator's port shields.

It's not to say that Captain Caradoc was going to roll over and
surrender.  The diehard Imperial had his ship's batteries open fire,
lacing the EF flagship with withering turbolaser fire, while TIE
Interceptors poured out from her belly by the dozens.  Explosions
lanced from both Imperators as turbolaser bolts penetrated their
shields and boiled off the armored hull below.  The Imperial TIE
fighters, free from having to defend themselves against enemy fighters
strafed the hulls of the Wild Stallion, targeting and destroying
turbolaser emplacements.

"Navigation," Ranma shouted over the din of alarm klaxons, "starboard
roll.  Bring portside batteries to bear. Tactical: Have batteries fire
as they bear.  Standby to fire ion cannons.  CAG, what fighters do we
have left?"

"Aye, sir," Mr. Beech replied.  He relayed the orders to his helmsman,
and the EarthForce battleship began to roll 90 degrees to the Black
Prince.  The portside turbolaser batteries opened fire as their
Imperial sister became visible.

"Ion control reports ready, General," the tactical officer reported.

"Not much, Generrral," Wing Commander M'ret reported.  "Just a few
Blackbirrrds and rrrecon Y-wings."

"Die, you arrogant sonovabitch," a dulcet voice called over the
communications net.  An Interceptor exploded as the blaster bolts from
an ARC-170 found their mark.  The fighter roared over the hull of the
flagship, followed quickly by three of her wingmates.  "Haneda, Shin,
Kagome, incoming marks at 3 o'clock, relative.  Break and engage."

"Pilot, identify yourrrself," M'ret growled.

"Second Lieutenant Mitaka Arisa, ma'am, 801st Tactical Fighter
Squadron."  The holotable updated itself, showing four fighters from
the 801st leaving the hull of the Wild Stallion.  "I thought it was
kind of odd that the flagship would take off without any fighter
escort."

"The Force is with us," Ranma said.  "We have fighter cover.  M'ret,
contact Victory, tell them to haul ass over here, and support the
element from the 801st."

"Yes sirrr."

Ranma returned to the holotable to watch the battle, while returning
command of the flagship back to Commander Dodge.  The former US Navy
officer began issuing his own commands to fight the ship in the best
traditions of the US Navy.  "Communications: signal the Nemesis, Luna,
and Terra.  They're to begin preparations for orbital bombardment of
the larger Imperial troop concentrations."

"Yes sir."

"General, are you sure it's time to begin our liberation?  There's
still a significant force out there."

Ranma looked at his flag captain.  "My dear Captain Maturin, now is
the perfect time.  Caradoc's task force is preoccupied with us, and
won't be able to support the Imperial troops."  A massive fireball lit
up the bridge.  Ranma turned back to the intelligence officer.  "What
ship?"

"The Iron Duke, General.  Imperial Imperator Star Destroyer."

"Very good..."  Ranma was thrown off his feet, as the Wild Stallion
wheeled against the blast wave; the starfield beyond the viewports
spinning wildly, as the ship's inertial dampeners fought to stabilize
the ship.  The lights on the bridge flickered for a few moments before
dropping offline.  Pale white emergency lighting flickered on, bathing
the bridge in a stark glow.  "Status report!"

"Damage report," Dodge shouted at the same time.

"Sirs, the Black Prince just exploded.  Shock damage to our ship from
the concussion wave.  Shields bore the brunt of the debris; life
support down 25%, electrical systems down 35% overall.  We're still
getting reports on casualties.  Primary sublight drives offline.  Fire
in frames 23 492 through 23 600; Damage Control is attempting to bring
it under control."

"Status of the element from the 801st?"

"Still with us, General.  They were on the opposite side of the ship
when the Black Prince exploded."

"General, the Imperial fleet is disengaging."

"Signal all Star Destroyers: Prepare to deploy ground forces and
fighter support.  All Vicstars, corvettes and the Prometheus to enter
the atmosphere and provide fire support."

"Yes sir."  A few moments later, the holotable showed the atmospheric-
capable warships entering the atmosphere, the corvettes and fighters
leading the landing barges.  Turbolaser bolts began raining down on
the Imperial garrisons, as swarms of TIE fighters began climbing to
meet the EarthForce starfighters.  A furious swirling furball began
developing as ARC-170s, Y-wings, and X-wings engaged Imperial
fighters.  Fireballs punctuated the deaths of friend and foe alike, as
the rescue channels began receiving the rescue beacons of those
fortunate enough to eject from their dieing fighter.

The Terran fighters had distinct advantages over their Imperial
counterparts-they were aerodynamically sound, as opposed to the high
drag penalties granted by the TIE fighter's vertical wings.  Another
advantage was also shown by the fact that almost all of the Terran
pilots were trained in atmospheric operations from day one of their
original service enlistments, and they used this training to the
utmost; unlike their Imperial counterparts who spent the majority of
their career in vacuum.  Of course, the rugged construction and
shields in the EF fighters helped as well.  All in all, the aerial
battle for 40 Eridani A II was a resounding victory for the EarthForce
Fleet Aerospace Arm.
