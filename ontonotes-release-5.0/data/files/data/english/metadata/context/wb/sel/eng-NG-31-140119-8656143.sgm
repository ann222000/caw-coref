My son tells me that Vista doesn't support virtual drives.  Is this right?
No more moody ISO mounts with Daemon Tools?  Surely not!  Can anyone confirm
if this is true and supply a workaround if it is!!

Try this

&quot;There's a free tool from slysoft called &quot;Virtual CloneDrive&quot;
Here's how, after installing you should get this little icon bottom right hand side,
but nope Shista la crappa Bill Gates Vista blocks it...    So go to &quot;My Computer&quot; or
&quot;computer&quot;, voila you'll see the sweet little sheep is there, right click it and
virtualclonedrive/mount.  Clone drive works fine in vista at least in the 32 bit
version

install clone drive
now go device manager
under &quot;other&quot; YOU Should have a new device SCSI or something...
right click and select update driver..
select browse my computer for driver software....
point the &quot;browse&quot; TO THE WINDOWS FOLDER and tick &quot;include sub-folders&quot;
now click next ....it will find the driver and install automatically...
now go to explorer a see your new drive.

PS
you must select at least 1 clone drive in the number of drives from the virtual clone
drive app.

Or just try this
