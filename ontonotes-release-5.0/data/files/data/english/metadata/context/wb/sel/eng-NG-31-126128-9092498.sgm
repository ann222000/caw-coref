Taking the three great albums from Dylan's latter times:

Time Out Of Mind,

Love &amp; Theft

Modern Times

Which has provided the most poignant line for you?

For me it's probably Workingman's Blues:

&quot;I'm all alone, I'm expecting you
To lead me off in a cheerful dance.&quot;

This is as much for the way he sings is as the actual words.  Pathos.
I can't explain why this line effects me so much but it does.  Maybe
it's the tension between the words 'alone' and 'cheerful.'  Who
knows ....

Thoughts?

I think it's the way he sings it.  It's one of the most expressively
sung lines on the album, and it also is vaguely suggestive of dancing
beneath a diamond sky.  That sense of familiarity also gets me with

'Last night I knew ya - tonight I don't'

which is also affected by the expressive tone in his voice.  In terms
of poignancy, I think either

'I wish my mother was still alive' or

'Someone hit me from behind' or

'Not as tight as the corner that I've painted myself in' or

'I'm sitting on my watch so I can be on time'

I always take this to mean Time Out of Mind, and that he felt

Seriously, this PISSES ME OFF if that's what it means, and I don't

FY BOB! You think you are too good for me. You think I'm crazy. You

He must've been in a shitty ass mood when he wrote that, don't you
think?  And is it really true or is it just one more (in a million)
example of brother Bob on the pity pot?  I seriously believe that if
he says something like this in a song, being the famous person he is,
he sort of owes the audience some explanation as to who he means.
Does he mean Neuwirth, Victor, Timothy Ferris?  Or does he literally
mean &quot;all&quot; of them?  Well, he did complain about not getting any get
well cards from his band mates when in the hospital.  I guess that
says something.

I'm afraid there are some people who are just itching to wrongfoot
Dylan .  They are careful not to waste too much time checking to see
if a song has a protagonist.  Why do that when you can just go right
ahead and hang Dylan for any sentiment he expresses that deviates from
his only 'proper' given line:  &quot;I will do your bidding, o great
audience who know so much better than I do.&quot;

We might as well blame Judi Dench for the sins of Lady Macbeth as she
plays her.

Are you referring to the occasional &quot;thank you&quot; I feel a performer owes his
audience?  That's an issue of how a performer should behave.  It has nothing
to do with him owing an explanation for a song (which to my mind is totally
ridiculous).  Nor does it indicate an especially needy audience.

I understand your position. It seems fairly reasonable, though I don't
agree with it. &quot;Owes&quot; and &quot;should behave&quot; ... Hm. Why not say instead
that many members of the audience would appreciate more signs from Bob
of gratitude for their appreciation/attendance? Why say he &quot;owes&quot; them
this gratitude? Why try to lay down rules as to how a performer
&quot;should behave&quot;? Why not say instead that people are accumstomed to
more acknowledgement of their presence from a performer than Bob tends
to give?

Appreciating thank yous and between song patter doesn't make an
audience needy. But demanding them, or moaning about their absence
does, to my mind. Why don't the audience just shove off if it bothers
them so much? (I'm only making a reference to some lyric, not wishing
to be rude to you.)

There are no hard and fast rules for politeness, but there are some patterns
of behavior that we tend to follow, not just out of compulsion, but because
it feels natural.  Let's say someone holds the door for you: it's pretty
natural to say &quot;thank you,&quot; or to nod your head in appreciation.  And it's
pretty natural for a singer to acknowledge the audience through verbal
and/or physical means.  It's not natural, or polite, for a singer to
acknowledge the audience as little as possible.  It's easy enough to say
&quot;thank you&quot; or to nod your head after most (if not all) of your songs.

They should, if it bothers them enough.  But some folks feel some sympathy
for Dylan, or are willing to put up with the silent treatment.  These folks
shouldn't be confused with the faithful who believe that Dylan owes the
audience no thanks at all, or those who believe that a person should never
do anything (however slight) if he doesn't feel like it.

I agree that there are patterns of behaviour we tend to follow, but
this is because we are taught them. I do not agree it is &quot;pretty
natural&quot;. In fact, your repeated use of the word &quot;natural&quot; is, I feel,
what undermines your position. When someone seeks to explain what is
&quot;natural&quot; for everyone else, it's usually time to question their
assumptions.

Good. Brilliant. I applaud this idea. You all do that, and then maybe
Bobby will have nothing left to do, and he'll look me down.

Hmm, I wonder whatever happened to that hysterical bride? I wonder if
she ever got married? Or maybe she's running a whorehouse in Buenos
Aires?

I think I just might give that young lazy slut a call.

Hello?

This is Bob Dylan.

Oops.

Bleeding, bleeding, bleeding, bleeding.

There is blood everywhere.

Blood in the toilet, blood on the tile, blood in the hallyway, blood

Dear Bob,

It's alright, I'm only bleeding. You have murdered another messiah
with your audacity and rudeness and lies and deceit. Don't be
bewildered by my chatter. I have always been a chatterbox, that's what
it says on my third grade report card.

STOP PLAYING WITH YOUR PENIS!

So, did you eat out that girl who came into your bus all night. You
are a complete BASTARD, we're supposed to be married, you don't read
this, you are singing about me, I don't give a damn how smart you are,
you think I'm a cunt, and you think I need you, it's 3:53, and I hate
you more than anything in the whole world, no, I don't, I just said
that, but the truth is, it takes way too much energy and emotion to
hate, and it feels awful, it's not worth it to hate anybody or
anything, and now it's 3:54, you don't know what these numbers mean to
me, well, I guess let me explain, I was on speed, and thinking about
you, and you were 54, and I wanted you so bad, it's 3:55, that's the
speed limit, I don't know, I am just making this up off the top of my
head, I don't normally do this, but it's so cool to finally be
synchronized with the Internet clock. So Julian told me nobody reads
the Internet, just like you don't read a mail truck.

So I was thinking about how you said you ride on a mail train, and of
course, a long time ago about going going gone, and of course about
tzitzit, did I spell that right, well, anyway, I am totally just
babbling here, I am so sick of you, I am so sick of you being cool,
and acting like Bob Dylan, I have no interest in being with anybody
who likes to act cool, I want to be with somebody nice, I was just
kidding before, I am just totally bored and need something to do. You
didn't read my letters to you care of Columbia, you aren't reading
this newsgroup, you don't give a damn about me, I think you totally
suck, I don't want you for anything at all, I don't know you, and you
don't know me, and we will never be a happy fam-i-ly, and that's all
there is to know about the tree, it's broken, it's all broken,
everything is broken, I think you are completely pathetic, Mr. Bob
Dylan, I feel so sorry for you, I am so glad I am me, and not you, I
have no respect for you, I don't like you or your family, well, maybe
some of your kids, ok, maybe I like your kids, but I'm not sure about
Jakob, he seems stuck up, and now it's 4:00, this train is just
rambling on, waiting for a good place to stop and dump off this cargo,
why should I unload this dumptruck at 400? Oh, duh.

&gt; &gt;Why try to lay down rules as to how a performer &quot;should behave&quot;?

&gt; There are no hard and fast rules for politeness, but there are some patterns
&gt; of behavior that we tend to follow, not just out of compulsion, but because
&gt; it feels natural.  Let's say someone holds the door for you: it's pretty
&gt; natural to say &quot;thank you,&quot; or to nod your head in appreciation.  And it's
&gt; pretty natural for a singer to acknowledge the audience through verbal
&gt; and/or physical means.  It's not natural, or polite, for a singer to
&gt; acknowledge the audience as little as possible.  It's easy enough to say
&gt; &quot;thank you&quot; or to nod your head after most (if not all) of your songs.

&gt; &gt;Why not say instead that people are accumstomed to more acknowledgement of

&gt; their presence from a performer than Bob tends
&gt; to give?

&gt; Not only that, most would find Dylan's behavior bizarre and/or insulting.

&gt; &gt;Why don't the audience just shove off if it bothers them so much? (I'm only

&gt; making a reference to some lyric, not wishing

M, that really sums it up.  Well done.  I thank you and so should
everybody else.

&gt; &gt; There are no hard and fast rules for politeness, but there are some patterns

&gt; &gt; natural to say &quot;thank you,&quot; or to nod your head in appreciation.

&gt; I agree that there are patterns of behaviour we tend to follow, but
&gt; this is because we are taught them. I do not agree it is &quot;pretty
&gt; natural&quot;. In fact, your repeated use of the word &quot;natural&quot; is, I feel,
&gt; what undermines your position. When someone seeks to explain what is
&gt; &quot;natural&quot; for everyone else, it's usually time to question their
&gt; assumptions.

&gt; &gt; And it's
&gt; &gt; pretty natural for a singer to acknowledge the audience through verbal
&gt; &gt; and/or physical means.  It's not natural, or polite, for a singer to
&gt; &gt; acknowledge the audience as little as possible.  It's easy enough to say
&gt; &gt; &quot;thank you&quot; or to nod your head after most (if not all) of your songs.

&gt; &gt; &gt;Why not say instead that people are accumstomed to more acknowledgement of

&gt; &gt; their presence from a performer than Bob tends
&gt; &gt; to give?

&gt; &gt; Not only that, most would find Dylan's behavior bizarre and/or insulting.

&gt; &gt; &gt;Why don't the audience just shove off if it bothers them so much? (I'm only

&gt; &gt; making a reference to some lyric, not wishing
&gt; &gt; to be rude to you.)

&gt; &gt; They should, if it bothers them enough.  But some folks feel some sympathy
&gt; &gt; for Dylan, or are willing to put up with the silent treatment.  These folks
&gt; &gt; shouldn't be confused with the faithful who believe that Dylan owes the

&gt; But what about the people who don't care to use the word &quot;owe&quot; in this
&gt; context at all. What box do you want to put them in?
.....
&gt; &gt; or those who believe that a person should never

Well, I guess we now know of at least one person here who was born in

I'll have you all know that I almost never spill a drop, unless I am

But when I am sober, I can always tell. I know right before it
happens, before it comes out of my bagonia, and I go into the
bathroom, and pull down my shorts and undies, and wipe up intimately
with two sections of Charmin Ultra, and there is a faint film of less

Yas yas yas...hide behind the skirt of the &quot;narrator&quot; when it serves

we wrong about 'em all,&quot; well sure, your narrator argument would fit
tight--snug like a bug in a rug. (BTW, where the fluck does this cat
get OFF writing for the song credit to Arthur McBride, 'Bob Dylan.
arr'? What a comedian our Brother Bob is, eh?)  But no, we have no
indication that this is anyone but our handy dandy singer songwriter
in chief and there is nothing so fantastical in the story (like him
being a soldier in Botany Bay) to automatically take us out of the

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; I seriously believe that if
&gt; &gt; he says something like this in a song, being the famous person he is,
&gt; &gt; he sort of owes the audience some explanation as to who he means.
&gt; &gt; Does he mean Neuwirth, Victor, Timothy Ferris?

&gt; If he writes a song with a bitter narrator he &quot;owes&quot; (!) the audience
&gt; some explanation? (And so many things we discover in these threads
&gt; that Bob OWES his audience--that audience seems more and more needy as
&gt; time goes on)

&gt; &gt;Or does he literally
&gt; &gt; mean &quot;all&quot; of them?  Well, he did complain about not getting any get
&gt; &gt; well cards from his band mates when in the hospital.  I guess that
&gt; &gt; says something.
