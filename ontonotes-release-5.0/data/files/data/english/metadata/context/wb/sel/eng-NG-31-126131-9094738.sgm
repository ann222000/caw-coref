Decades ago Philips Classics maintained complete anonymity regarding
the forces employed to record some of the most famous recordings in
their history. The theory was that they were all equal, one producer
and engineer very much the equal of another.

In the 1990s the producers and engineers finally got their way and
became known overnight by record buyers.

The problem is with the older recordings. Who did what? Only the card
files in my office would provide that information, which is still
largely unknown. We do know the producer/engineer for most of
Haitink's recordings with the COA, but lots of the others remain
unknown.

A case in point is a recording with the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra,
no less, under the direction of Semyon Bychkov, touted for a time as a
possible candidate in Berlin!!!

This recording is truly wonderful from a sonic standpoint, right from
the biting edge provided the strings at the opening of the first
movement.

My GUESS would be the late, and probably great, Volker Strauss,
something of a bane of Philips management for the endless time he
would insist on taking with his recordings. Nobody at Philips could
ever give Volker anything ressembling a &quot;deadline&quot;. The recoding would
be ready when it was ready. No sooner. No later.

The recording I have been listening to of late is of Symphony No. 5 -
420 069-2 - which has a recording date of May, 1986. A quick glance
doesn't reveal any OTHER versions of this symphony with the BPO.
Shostakovich, indeed, is not a frequent guest in Berlin. Rattle has
done Nos 1 &amp; 14. Karajan did a famous No. 10. Celibicache did No. 7.
Jansons did No. 1. I like what I hear from Bychkov in Symphony No. 5
and it is in no small measure due to the truly extraordinary playing
by the BPO and the wonderful, airy, spacious recording perhaps
provided by the late Volker Strauss.

Frankly, I detect a certain turning up of the nose at Shostakovich's
music in Berlin. It would seem that the three Bychkov Berlin
Philharmonic Orchestra recordings for Philips - all deleted, alas -
were the only significant foray into this music during the last half
of the 20th Century. Perhaps Rattle will improve on that, but who
knows? We certainly do NOT have a Shostakovich 5 whith HvK, which we
had ever right to expect from him, particularly as he did oceans of
bonbons for both DG and EMI during his tenure in Berlin.

In the meantime, collectors might do well to search out those three
Shostakovich discs, Symphony Nos. 5, 8, &amp; 11, all on separate Philips
now deleted CDs. As always, the Berlin Philharmonic's playing is an
object lesson in how to treat this music with nobility instead of
cloying sentimentality. Bychkov has, of course, since been to Paris
and now somewhere else in Germany, most observers no longer
considering him for the Berlin post. But he's not a bad conductor of
this music, you know.

Right next to this CD on my shelf is a recording made 4 months later
in Berlin (Brahms PC 1, Brendel, Abbado) and Volker Strauss is
credited as the producer.   Maybe that offers further evidence that he
was the producer.  Maybe not.

Bychkov's Rachmaninoff 2 (5/1990, OdeP) and String Music (10/1991,
BPO) were both produced by Hein Dekker.

Not to be forgotten is a fine Shosty 1 with Jansons/BP on EMI, plus a
number of other Shostakovich symphony recordings with other conductors
and orchestras in Berlin, like Sanderling and Flor, and of course film
music with the Berlin Radio Symphony and various chamber recordings by
such artists as the Philharmonia Quartet Berlin, and of course the
numerous live concerts (I have, for instance, a rather good
Shostakovich 5 with Kempe/Berlin Radio).

If anyone was turning up a nose at Shostakovich, it was Abbado, who
could have jumped into Karajan's void and done more Shostakovich.

But overall Berliners have done plenty of Shostakovich on disc, and
certainly more that never made it to disc. And by now the Berlin
Philharmonic's recorded legacy in Shostakovich is not really much
worse than any other orchestra at that level--look at Boston,
Cleveland, the Philharmonia, etc. and tell me they've done all that
much Shostakovich on recordings.

I agree that certain American orchestras have also not been out in

course.

But Berlin and Vienna still rule the orchestral world, in my opinion.
Vienna did some Shostakovich in the distant past. And the COA has done
some, of course

But the Berlin Philharmonic seems to feel that Shostakovich is not,
well, &quot;ready for prime time&quot;, one might say? And this is a pity,
considering the stature of the ensemble.

You're probably right, although this is very much a side issue. I knew
Volker Straus(s). He was no Viennese waltz, I can assure you. A more
tormented perfectionist manipulator of sound I have not met. He died
of heart problems. Quelle surprise!

But you'll note I also mentioned the Philharmonia, which is surely a
great orchestra, and just as surely not American. What Shostakovich
have they done? Not much. The LSO didn't do all that much either until
more recent years. Yes, they did some with Previn and an odd guest.
And the Orchestre de Paris, the ONF? The Vienna Philharmonic, which
you mentioned? SOBR? SWF? Staatskapelle Dresden? Oslo Philharmonic?
the Gewandhaus in Leipzig? The Israel Philharmonic? I can go on and
on...Overall, very little Shostakovich on disc from non-Russian
orchestras, with a few notable exceptions by orchestras that had
strong relationships with conductors who sought Shostakovich's music:
Ormandy and Stokowski in the U.S., Previn and now Gergiev in London,
Haitink and Kondrashin in Amsterdam, Ancerl in Prague and elsewhere,
etc.

Your comment about the Berlin Philharmonic (good of you to narrow it
to that orchestra now instead of Berliners as a whole), seen in
comparison to most other orchestras of great stature, doesn't hold
much water because they've done plenty of Shostakovich since those
early digital efforts with Bychkov. What we have is two principal
conductors, Abbado and Karajan, with little interest in Shostakovich,
but the orchestra itself seems not to have an &quot;attitude&quot; toward
Shostakovich one way or another. They play him well and often and with
conviction when the right conductors come along, same as any other
orchestra.

The recent Berliner Philharmoniker edition has an excellent 15th with
Sanderling (Vol. 11) from 1999.  It makes a great companion to the
version he set down with the Berlin Symphony for Berlin Classics. One
or the other is my favorite recording of that elusive work.

In your first post you were ambiguous. I took your meaning as
&quot;Berliners don't like Shostakovich&quot; which was perfectly reasonable
given that you were talking about the players as much as the
conductors. It is better to be clear and restrict this discussion to
just the Philharmonic, because, after all, the other orchestras have
recorded a fair amount of Shostakovich. That's good evidence that
Berliners have no problem with Shostakovich, if not evidence that the
Philharmonic has no problem with Shostakovich.

I realize that orchestras aren't your primary area of interest, but
keep in mind that from Otto Klemperer and Erich Kleiber all the way to
Barenboim and Boulez today, the &quot;other&quot; Berlin orchestras do count
very much indeed.

Exactly. There *is* no evidence to suggest what you asserted about the

they have done so. Like most other groups, they've recorded DSch
relatively frequently since the advent of the digital era..

Check their schedules if you need evidence. Or go to Parnassus Records
and look at the listings of Shostakovich performances with the Berlin
Phil with Sanderling, Solti, Previn, Jansons, Haitink, Gergiev,
Berglund, and, believe it or not, Abbado! Undoubtedly this is just the
tip of the iceberg.

In short, one doesn't need to be there to know something or to hear
something.

(Speaking of Parnassus, has anyone actually bothered to listen to the
Shostakovich 5 with John Eliot Gardiner and the Czech Philharmonic? Is
that a cool blind listening test or what!)

This was, of course, my meaning. No slight on Barenboim, but his

The BPO has obviously - or more likely its management - avoided too

much everyone else at that level too at a time when recordings have

seen, the BPO have been performing this work and others reasonably
frequently with the same conductors who do it everywhere else. The
fact that they do it so often with guest conductors is a sure sign
that in the past they embraced the music as often as time allows
outside the expertise of their own principal conductors. It's not like
anyone was forcing it on them; they *asked* for it.

No, the point is exactly the point I made (actually, I errred..they've
recorded the 1st twice). The orchestra has recorded plenty of
Shostakovich in the modern era. If that orchestra set a universal
standard for recordings then nobody would record Elgar or Vaughan
Williams or Roussel or Copland or Gershwin or Bach cantatas or Haydn's
Sturm und Drang symphonies. We wouldn't have umpteen versions of
Bizet's symphony. The point about one orchestra setting a single
&quot;standard&quot; that others follow is just a figment of your imagination.
The recording facts show something else. Do you somehow think that the
Berlin Philharmonic led the boom in Mahler recording too? Did the
Berlin Philharmonic lead the parade of &quot;authenticists&quot; in Bach and
Mozart and Beethoven too? Of course not.

Why would the archetypical German orchestra, the band of Furtwangler

I am ONLY judging the orchestra on its recorded repertoire. This is,

other symphony of DS, they simply have been &quot;missing in action&quot;, as
they say in the military. And now that the three Bychkov are

Rattle is, perhaps, the real hope that the BPO will climb out of its

get a decade or so into the 21st.

The BPO is, as MA once remarked, the &quot;Greta Garbo of orchestras&quot;. Self-
absorbed in its own virtue, its own beauty, its own classic stature.

Rattle's job is to shake that all up just a bit, if he gets a chance,

players who don't like Mahler all that much. But even in the case of
Mahler, the orchestra has played a lot of it--far more than the
commercial recordings would suggest--and has been playing it far
longer too.

In every orchestra you will find some people who don't like
Shostakovich, or Mahler, or Brahms, or whatever, as much as you and I
might. But they still can play it well and often.

&gt; I understand. I am just pointing out that this judgment reflects the

&gt; fraction of their legacy.

&gt; This is,

&gt; &gt; after all RCMR!!! Perhaps there's a forum where you can tout these
&gt; &gt; &quot;live&quot; performances of the BPO as indicative of their profound
&gt; &gt; interest in Shostakovich. But not here.

&gt; Except that this forum is about recordings of musicians making music,
&gt; so information about those musicians is obviously on topic. Let's not
&gt; forget that musicians make commercial recordings only when producers
&gt; want those recordings made. So don't continue to err with statements
&gt; like:

&gt; &quot;Shostakovich, indeed, is not a frequent guest in Berlin.&quot;

&gt; &quot;Frankly, I detect a certain turning up of the nose at Shostakovich's
&gt; music in Berlin.&quot;

&gt; if you wish to convey the semblance of informed opinion. Cognoscenti

Jeff when the washed up DJ cannot support his premises he simply
switches them.  He is never wrong you see.
As usual he doesn't know what he is talking about.  Here is a list of
concerts that contain works by Shostakovich
going back to 1945.  The list of concert was taken from the archives
of the concert listings located on the BPO's own
site.  I mention this as the Deacon will of course reject the evidence
even when is it cited from the official site.  He
has shown himself to be a lazy blowhard who dispenses hot air from his
anus time and time again.  He has done
so yet again.  He is so predictable.  BTW, the list is evidence to a
commitment to Shostakovich's work.  Yes, Deaky
they did play this music rather often.  Here's the list:

[earlier Deacon rantings clipped - apologies to others also clipped]

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Why would the archetypical German orchestra, the band of Furtwangler
&gt; and that ex-Nazi Karajan have led the fight for Mahler, a Jewish-born
&gt; convert to Christanity? I see no reason why, in fact, although HvK did
&gt; get around to some Mahler at the end, after everyone else had done it
&gt; and almost shamed him into it.
">

As usual the benighted Deacon doesn't know what he is talking about.
Facts mean nothing to him. Why indeed would the Karajan and
Furtwangler
fight for Mahler's music?  The fact is they did.

Anyone the least bit familiar with Furtwangler's repertoire knows that
up
until the Nazi era he was a champion of Mahler's music and played
it fairly frequently.  As for Karajan he was playing Mahler's music
as early as 1960 when he conducted Das Lied.  Actually, Mahler
was played frequently by the BPO from 1948 on.  They played
Mahler's music approximately 90 times from 1948 through 1980,
a period when Mahler's music was becoming a part of the standard
repertoire that is has now become. So under the BPO music directorship
of Karajan
a great deal of Mahler's music was played with his and the orchestra's
approval.
Here is a list taken from the
BPO's website listing the BPO concerts containing Mahler's
music:

The Ravel String Quartet?  Is there a string orchestra, or orchestra,
version, of this?

Actually I just checked the Karajan foundation web site and they show
the Shostakovich Symphony No.10 paired with the Brandenburgisches
Konzert Nr. 5 D-Dur BWV 1050.  No Ravel.

Karajan first conducted Mahler's music even earlier than you can tell
from that list: In 1955, on tour with the BPO he conducted Lieder
eines fahrenden Gesellen in Chicago and Syracuse, with the great
American contralto Carol Brice as soloist.

Also, in June 1960, after the BPO performances of Das Lied von der
Erde, he conducted it three times with the VPO. Rössel-Majdan was also
the contralto in those performances, but Fritz Wunderlich was the
tenor in the first two performances (in the Musikverein), while Anton
Dermota was the tenor in the last (in the Staatsoper).

You can find all this info (along with details on all of Karajan's
Mahler performances) at http://www.karajan.org/en/research/performances/list.asp?Komponist=57...

Regarding Karajan and Shostakovich: I've read, though I can't supply a
source at the moment, that the only Shostakovich symphony Fluffy
really liked was the 10th.

Of course, he recorded several works that he didn't really like, and
some of those recordings turned out pretty well (the Ariadne auf Naxos
and Cosi Fan Tutté in particular). Of course, those two were done in
the days when he must have felt that if Walter Legge wanted something
from him, Walter Legge got it and he got it as good as Fluffy could do
it.

Karajan probably conducted this work because (I'll assume) it was
something Furtwängler had scheduled?

That's a good surmise, and it may well be correct, especially if Brice
had already been engaged. (I think she'd already recorded it with
Reiner and Pittsburgh so it was a work for which she was known.)

The Chicago program also consisted of Leonore #3, the Barber Adagio
for Strings (would Furtwängler have conducted that, I wonder), and the
Tchaikovsky 5th, while the Syracuse programe also had Don Juan and the
Brahms 2nd.

I don't know if this is &quot;of course&quot; of Legge.
Karajan has recorded other stuff he never played in concerts.
AFAIK some Bruckner symponies and the Tchaikovsky symphonies 1-3 among those.
These have been recorded for DG, not for Legge.

I wasn't trying to suggest that those were the only times he recorded
music that he never played in concert, or that the only times he did
that was when he was asked by Legge.

All I was trying to say was that (IIRC) he was on record as not liking
Ariadne and Cosi, and I was just trying to playfully suggest that if
Legge had asked him to record something at that time, he probably
would have done it, even if it was a work that he didn't like.

Also, I wasn't trying to say that this was definitively what happened.
I'm sorry if it read that way.

&gt; A case in point is a recording with the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra,
&gt; no less, under the direction of SemyonBychkov, touted for a time as a
&gt; possible candidate in Berlin!!!

&gt; This recording is truly wonderful from a sonic standpoint, right from
&gt; the biting edge provided the strings at the opening of the first
&gt; movement.
">

I did just listen to that recording, and agree with everything you say
about it...but for some reason I need to increase the gain by about 5
dB to attain a comparable volume with other recordings of the same
work.

BTW, the liner notes mention that HvK gave Bychkov permission to take
the BPO on tour. In the mid 80s, Herbie and the orchestra were
supposed to make a US tour, but he canceled because of health reasons
and the tour went on without him. Did Bychkov take the helm then?
