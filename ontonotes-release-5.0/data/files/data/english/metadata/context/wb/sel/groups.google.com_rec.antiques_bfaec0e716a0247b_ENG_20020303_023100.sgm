After googling for discussions of painted antiques, I found this group and
would like to pose this question for your consideration:

I have a large (9 - 10 feet wide x 4.5 feet tall) bookcase that is old
(they don't make anything that big and heavy any more) and has the look of
old paint.
The back is beadboard, and it appears that it might have been a built-in.
It is looking pretty shabby and I'd like to paint it, but it's been
suggested that repainting would devalue it.

Here are a couple of reasons I think I should paint it:

First of all, I had it moved up 16 flights of stairs, since it didn't fit
in my building's elevator. I doubt it's going to leave in one piece --
I'll never find the guys who moved it in, bless their hearts (and
muscles).

Second of all, suppose it was still in the original owner's family. I
don't think it's the kind of piece that would be allowed to get so shabby
looking. I'm guessing they would have re-painted it every 20 years or
so. Couldn't I think of repainting it as &quot;proper maintenance&quot;?

If I decide not to paint it, what are some steps I can take to make it
more attractive? Wax over the old paint?

"/> How old is old? And is the painted finish the original? Is it possible to
do a little cautious probing on some inconspicuous spot? Several years ago
I helped a friend refinish (gasp!) a dental cabinet that had belonged to her
uncle. Her aunt had painted it bright yellow and had painted all the knobs
black. Turned out the cabinet was beautiful quarter sawed oak, and the
knobs were glass. It would have been criminal to leave the paint on that
piece.

On the other hand, if the piece is _really_ old, and if the finish is
original, then it's time to go slow.

I'll be interested to hear what the experts have to say.

"/> You don't seem to have any reason to think it's anything but a big old
bookcase. Well-built stuff is nice, but I'm guessing we're not talking
about a museum piece. And I assume you didn't haul it up those stairs to
prep it for selling. I doubt if painting the thing is going to have any
effect on the value, either up or down. If it was mine, I'd slick it up
and paint it with a good enamel and be done with it. If I could see that
the wood was especially nice and it was made of full-width long leaf
pine that's pretty much impossible to find anymore, I'd consider
stripping it. But it would take some pretty fabulous wood to move me to
strip a big bookcase in an apartment.

"/> Sure, if it was painted piece to begin with. But if you're using it, and
you don't like the shabby look, paint it, strip it, or whatever you
would like.

"/> Is this old, worn paint - chipped and cracked? If you like that look,
sand off the loose paint and the oxidized layer. There's some stuff we
use to seal and stabilize that sort of thing. The brand name is
&quot;Penetrol&quot;. It's sold as a paint additive, but we find it makes a nice,
hard, unobtrusive finish for old paint, metal, and bare wood. On old
bare wood, it brings the original color back out. If you go to multiple
coats, it will gloss, once it's soaked in and sealed what it can. Just
swab it on with a rag. You can still paint over it later, if you tire of
the shabby look.

In fact, we've got something like that, a ten-foot long, four-foot tall
pine bookcase with glass doors. I suspect it began life as a
wall-mounted cabinet, but it's a terrific bookcase and very nice in
yellow gloss enamel.

There isn't enough information here to advise you. Much early painted
furniture looks &quot;shabby&quot; , however worth a lot untouched. I would get
someone that knows to look at it, or put up a picture. If the paint is
greenish, yellowish, or a kind of mucky brown, don't touch it unless you
have someone look at it first.
