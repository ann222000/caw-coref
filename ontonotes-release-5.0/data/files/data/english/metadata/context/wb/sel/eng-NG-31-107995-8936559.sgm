Trip to harbor freight (grinding)

I got the itch for a grinder and learned that there was a Harbor Freight
place only 100 miles from work so I headed down there to buy of of these.

http://www.harborfreight.com/cpi/ctaf/displayitem.taf?Itemnumber=46727

Well, I got there and from 20 feet away I liked it.  At 1 foot I passed.
Darn display model had .020 or worse wobble as in flange not square to
shaft.   Having bought a chinie grinder before that turned out to be lots of
iron and no electrics I wasn't too eager to get burned again.

Now likely I could have taken the wheel mounting flanges off and squared
them up off the machine or even in the machine but at that point I only had
16 bucks worth of gas in this thing for the round trip and decided to back
away quickly.

Anyway, I'm going to build my own now.  I have a 1725 tefc motor, some
pillow block bearings, and chunk of ductile cast iron that I am going to
turn into a rotary lap that I'll charge with 1200 grit diamond paste to
finish the edges.

So what grit silicon carbide metal backed cup wheel should I buy?

That sure is poor marketing.  I thought about asking them to grab a box and
let me inspect it but I was a bit tired and p*ssed seeing the display model
having driven 100 miles. I work mid nights and get a bit cranky by 10 am.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If you ever decide to go back to HF, stop a few blocks short and take a
little nap.  By being tired and p*ssed, you scr*wed yourself.  You drove 200
miles, used $16 worth of gas, and spent about 3 hours, and came away with
NOTHING.  Quality control on the Chinese product at Harbor Freight is known
to be poor.  Don't assume that what you see is what you get, unless it's the
exact same unit you're going to take home.  If you don't want to take up
their time, go back to your car and open the box.  HF is really good about
exchanging merchandise or giving refunds.

Just keep your receipt--DAMHIKT.

Well, I take the long view on this.  If I had ordered it, paid UPS on 102#
and didn't like it, I'd have been really p*ss*d and out the shipping.  16
bucks on gas was worth it.

Three blocks away was a tire store with 7 cop cars obviously interested in
something that morning.  No way I was going to sleep in my car after that
one on the way in.

You are right that I should have asked for a box though and inspected it on
site.  I have a 3/4 hp grinder out in the garage that I can stop with a
finger and not lose skin so I'm a bit leery of chinese grinders.

In my edits on this post I trimmed out some things.

I bought two of these
http://www.harborfreight.com/cpi/ctaf/displayitem.taf?Itemnumber=92486

for 15 bucks each.  Handy for moving my 12x36 lathe around until I have it
restored and set and leveled.

Also I bought some rolling head pry bars.  Damn handy things.  It was not a
totally wasted trip.

http://www.harborfreight.com/cpi/ctaf/displayitem.taf?Itemnumber=31382

Sadly they didn't have these in stock.
http://www.harborfreight.com/cpi/ctaf/displayitem.taf?Itemnumber=7929

If you ever buy some buy a pair, works out better.

Yep, silicon carbide it is, and a green one.
I'm not versed in scraping, but I've read that the edge should be
exceedingly keen----so you might entertain a very fine wheel, 150 grit or
even finer.   Best yet would be a diamond, which won't chip the carbide.
You'd be pretty happy with a 220 diamond, which will move carbide fast and
leave a decent surface that is easily lapped to perfection.   A diamond
wheel should be run wet, so keep that in mind.

I bought one of those a couple of years ago.  I've been really happy
with mine.  I've ground better lathe tools than I was ever able to do
before this machine.  (That may just mean I don't have much ability, but
this machine really improved my efforts).

I did hook up a water supply and drain, but that is all I've done.

FWIW I recommend this grinder.  From your experience, get one in a box!

the 149.50 tool grinder is not up to scratch.....JHC, what the fuck do
you want for that? - do you expect a high precision industrial quality
instrument? - yeh, sure, if its a sale from the rust belt of US
manufacturing, else its totally worn out....wow, $16 for 200 miles in

As a bemused by-stander, I must agree. We have had it far too good for
far too long here. The decimation of the US industrial manufacturing
base
due to both poor response to global competition and the &quot;WalMart&quot;
consumer mentality in this country is staggering. In the area of
Chinese
tools, there is a lot to choose from, but it has now actually become
quite
difficult to distinguish in some cases what the actual country of
origin
may be, since so many US suppliers now outsource the &quot;dirty work&quot; to
China or other countries, then rebrand the item as their own. I am of
course guilty of buying from HF those items that don't have a high
level of criticality as I see it. I would never trust a Chinese 6&quot;
caliper
to work as my only measuring tool, in constant use, but for occasional
use, my Chinese 12&quot; dial caliper (at $39 or whatever the hell it was)
is
a good example of the &quot;value&quot; equation. One buys Chinese with the
full knowledge that quality is widely variable, repair may be needed
before first use, and safety is never paramount in the product. If you
can live with that, you have the opportunity to get some real deals,
and further the cause of US economic decline at the same time.

Got your knickers in a twist today?

The taxes on fuel in your country are helping to pay for your social support
systems.  If you don't like it, change it via the political process.

In no way did I expect the HF item to be equal to a baldor tool grinder but
when the display version is just plain horrible, I don't expect better out
of the sealed box.

And yes, I do know I am lucky to live in the United States.  I have had the
opportunity to live in parts of Europe and Asia along with visiting Canada
and Mexico and I'll take this country every time.

You would have to go and pick it up from an auction, for this price.

They are, however, shippable by UPS (without stands) and sell for

Not if anyone else is at the auction.

The Baldor diamond grinders maintain their value.

That is why the Chinese chose them as an item to copy.

The same goes for Emco lathes were the model for the common Chinese
lathe.

It is almost a badge of honor to be chosen by the Chinese as the tool
to be copied....and as they take market share from you.

Yep. Sorry, I put that badly - due to our small market, such a tool
grinder would be hundreds of dollars more - and I dont think such a
thing is even on the market here due to lack of demand. So, I freehand
grind my toolbits - would be so much easier if I had one of those
grinders....(envy, pure and simple, at the cheapness of tools in the
US)

Nope. We like it - subsidized medicine, decent health care -, the

Wow - did you expect the minimum wage shop assistant to be able to
tell if it was out of true? - probably didnt even know what it was

Use the finest bonded diamond wheel you can find. You don't need to remove
much material at all to refresh a scraper bit and you need to end up with a

It did. The small local engineering shop is, by and large, gone. Even
the BIG engineering shops are gone too. The former sites are now
&quot;Shopping Malls&quot; with &quot;Boutique Apartments&quot; - Vickers-Ruwolt had a
huge site , half a suburb,  machinery that could make propshafts and
gears for ships.....its local to me, most of the site is taken up with
an IKEA store. Whoopee - putting together an IKEA chair is not the
same feeling of satisfaction as building a bridge, or a ship, or a
locomotive...

Yes, most of the stuff here is Chinese - the X2 and X3 mills, the 9 by
20 lathe - it will be a long time before I can exceed the capabilities
of these machines. The HF toolgrinder you describe - no, not enough
demand, so no one imports them. Would love to have one, even with the
faults you describe.

The $30 DVD player, the $100 TV set - we are awash with them.....all
going to landfill when they die.....any life over 3 years is a bonus,
and with a 12 month warranty on them anyway there GREAT value. If you
can mentally cope with the throw away attitude.

The paradox here is that the Chinese are making world class gear -
lets face it, they have just launched a moon shot, (you cannot make
one of them with a mini-mill.), have put a man in space. Supersonic
jet fighters, ICBM's, nuclear power plants, advanced semiconductors -
they do it all.

BUT - they are perfectly happy to make a dollar building crap for the
likes of (insert store name here) who get good margins on it. And
maybe the HF grinder you describe is in that category - the price
screwed down so much, they couldnt/wouldnt  be bothered setting it up
properley...who knows? Most of the problems in the lathes and mills
seem to be lack of attention to detail, lack of time spent in fitting
to tolerance and  can be fixed with a bit (or a lot) of work.

If you have the skills to do it, great - at this stage in my learning
curve, I don't. In time, perhaps. And yes, thats another thing about
these wonderful cheap stores - no way in a fit are they going to find,
or pay, someone with enough trade skills to be able to do it properly,
defect the faulty ones before they go out the door..  Exception will
be the old timers who are redundant from manufacturing and trying to
eke out a living till retirement.

And stores don't like employing them either - they tend to have short
tolerance of 30yo idiots with MBA's., and their conscience pricks them
when told to sell obvious junk....

Not sure there - a whole generation has been conditioned to throw away
junk at low prices - and the prevailing orthodoxy in the marketplace
seems to embrace this concept. I am a consumer service tech, its my
generation (ie, the over 50's) who still have the mindset of getting
things repaired. Anyone younger, they bin it, go get a new one....

And whats happened to the skilled workers who used to run
manufacturing, here and there in your country. Mowing lawns, low paid
low skill jobs to eke out a living after being made redundant. And
VERY pissed with whats been done to their country. .Sure, you can go
out and buy new precision machinery, set up a factory again. But the
generational skills of trade, of attitude, of pride in workmanship
that were passed down from Master to Apprentice - I fear that they
have been lost. It would be very difficult to build up that skills
base again. And I fear that, long term, it will be to our cost. Thank
heavens people like Harold  etc are computer literate and can pass on
some of those skills in this forum.

I certainly have to agree. Having been to a number of auctions in
Arizona, I am amazed at the prices fetched by Baldor pedestal
grinders (not even the tool grinders under discussion). I have seen
Baldor 7&quot; grinders, quite well used and missing a tool rest, go for
more than $300 at large industrial auctions, for chrissakes. Of
course, this same auction mentality can be seen at work on
other items as well. Total lack of value calculation on the part of
the bidders, when you can buy the same thing new for less than
$500 on a good sale (not to mention the imported competition).

BTW, I bought my Jet 8&quot; bench grinder through Amazon(!) Great
deal with free shipping. The Jet unit, in my personal experience
having outfitted the shop at (former) workplace about 15 yrs. ago,
is terrifically durable, and very good quality. No real plug intended,

Find one that is real noisy and get it for nothing.... put about 30

I got a real nice pedistal grinder for nothing which was very noisy and

I remember when 'jap crap' was the common slur for things made by the
Japanese.  They got there chit together and now if I see Japan on the box, I
figure it is likely good stuff just based on reputation.  I also don't feel
bad about buying it since their people have decent standard of living so I'm
not bottom feeding.

The best Chinese stuff is either military or produced by firms are
controlled by American, Japanese or European corporations.

I suspect the Chinese goverment will crack down on crappy producers to
protect their economy.  Of course the Red Chinese way of enforcing edicts
are a bit extream.  Anyone remember their FDA chief?  I bet they charged the
family for the bullet.

Flood is recommended.  It not only cools, it also keeps the surface clear of
contamination.   If the drip isn't fast enough to keep the edge cool,
thermal shock is a consideration.   They're always wheels, never stones.
Stones are used by hand, or in hones.   That is, unless you have an old whet

Resinoid bonded wheels have a layer that is either 1/16&quot; or 1/8&quot; thick that
is filled with diamond bits of the prescribed grit size.    Plated wheels
are just that------a thin layer of diamond that is held in place by
plating----if I'm not mistaken, nickel.   They work fine, but have a short
life as compared to the thicker resinoid wheels.   Most importantly, the
resinoid bonded wheels are much kinder to the carbide.  It's virtually
impossible to chip carbide with such a wheel, unlike a metallic bonded
wheel, not to be confused with a plated wheel.     There are such wheels
made for what is considered off-hand grinding of carbide.   They're made the
same way resinoid wheels are in that they have diamond through the matrix,
again, 1/16&quot; or 1/8&quot; thick.     My limited exposure to such a wheel left a
great deal to be desired.  Said another way, there's no way in hell I'd buy
one.   I'd choose a resinoid bonded wheel, hands down, even if I was offered
a metallic bonded wheel for free, but had to pay for the resinoid bonded
wheels.   The difference in performance is stunning.

By the way, I've been using diamond wheels for more than 50 years now.  A
wheel that used to cost about $600, when a dollar was still worth no less
than 50 cents, is now priced @ roughly $125, thanks to modern technology.
Wheels have come down well in price, in spite of the loss of buying power of
the dollar.   Diamond wheels are a real bargain today.

Don't buy into that bullshit.  You can move more carbide per unit time with
a fine diamond wheel than you can with a coarse silicon carbide wheel-----so
where's the advantage?   Taking the discussion further, it's entirely likely
that a $125 diamond wheel will last longer than a dozen $20 silicon carbide
wheels, so you can't even argue economics.    The only possible advantage I
can see is that you can club off some carbide by a poor method without
spending as much money up front, but you pay the price, it's just a matter
of when.   In most cases it's by reduced performance and tool life.

As I said, I've been using diamond wheels for over 50 years now, and that
includes a short stint (5 months) in a shop that used silicon carbide wheels
exclusively.   I have more than my share of experience grinding carbide by
both methods.   I don't recommend green silicon carbide wheels for anything,
or anyone, unless the person in question has absolutely no prospects of
buying a diamond wheel.   The degraded condition of tools ground with those
green wheels is such that it's hard to get them to perform to satisfaction.

I guess you can consider the opportunity to breath silicon one of the
advantages.    I think I'd rather not.

I'm not surprised.    Depending on how old Jet products are, they can be of
excellent quality.   I purchased three small  (1/4&quot; capacity chucks) Jet
drill presses back in the late 60's for a production job I was running for a

hummmmm.....I cant remove as much carbide with a fine diamond wheel as

Oh..and the two diamond lappers.

I tend to belt sand or green wheel to shape, and finish with the (3)

Wrong?

Is there such a thing?   If what you're doing works for you, you're not
destroying your wheels, and you're satisfied with the results, go for it.

When I use a diamond wheel, it's with flood coolant, and I'm not afraid to
bear down on it.   There's a point where the wheel cuts quite well, and that
keeps the wheel in proper trim along with moving the carbide.   It's smart
to start off lightly, so you establish a flat surface on the carbide.
That's  so it doesn't abrade the diamond wheel, which is a concern with
resinoid bonded wheels.   Mind you, I'm talking about removing a chipped
edge, where you push back the carbide until you're down to good material.
When I sharpen a tool, I use a different procedure, which includes lighter
pressure.

One thing that you should do religiously is remove any steel that is below
or behind the carbide to be ground.  If you allow the least bit to remain,
it dulls the diamond and makes grinding dreadfully slow.    You should also
know about dressing the surface of a diamond wheel. When you've babied it
too long, it gets loaded with crud and actually comes close to not
functioning.    A very fine dressing stick should be applied to the wheel,
which will clean it up nicely.

By the way, I use a 220 grit diamond wheel.  It does a good job of moving
carbide, and leaves a very nice surface.
