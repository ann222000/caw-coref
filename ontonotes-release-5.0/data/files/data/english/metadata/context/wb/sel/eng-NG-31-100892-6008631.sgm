A 2007 warning: the world's twelve worst ideas
Fred Halliday
8 - 1 - 2007

The world is full of conformism masquerading as profundity, says Fred
Halliday, who explodes twelve global falsehoods.

In identifying error, two great models at either end of modern times
exist. The first is part thirty-nine of Francis Bacon's Novum Organon
(1620), with its four categories of idol: those of the cave (of
individual men), the tribe (human nature), the marketplace (intercourse
of men with each other) and the theatre (philosophical dogma). The
second is Francis Wheen's How Mumbo-Jumbo Conquered the World: A Short
History of Modern Delusions (2004).

Some errors are products of the unchallenged, the routine, the
conventional. Some are new, products of fashion, of novelty, even of
globalisation. Everyone has his or her own selection, born of
profession, personality, place. The list could be a long one but, like
Christ and his disciples, twelve seems a comfortable figure, at once
extensive and compact. Here, for 2007, is one suggested list, in
ascending order:

Number twelve: Human behaviour can be predicted

In the name of a supposedly "scientific" criterion of knowledge,
scholars are berated for not predicting the end of the cold war, the
rise of Islam, 9/11 and much else besides. Yet many natural sciences
- seismology, evolutionary biology - cannot predict with accuracy
either. Human affairs themselves, even leaving aside the matter of
human intention and will, allow of too many variables for such
calculation. We will never be able to predict with certainty the
outcome of a sports contest, the incidence of revolutions, the duration
of passion or how long an individual will live.

Number eleven: The world is speeding up

This, a favourite trope of globalisation theorists, confuses
acceleration in some areas, such as the transmission of knowledge, with
the fact that large areas of human life continue to demand the same
time as before: to conceive and bear a child, to learn a language, to
grow up, to digest a meal, to enjoy a joke, to read a poem. It takes
the same time to fly from London to New York as it did forty years ago,
ditto to boil an egg or publish a book. Some activities - such as or
driving around major western cities, getting through an airport, or
dying - may take much longer.

Number ten: We have no need for history

In recent decades, large areas of intellectual and academic life -
political thought and analysis, economics, philosophy - have jettisoned
a concern with history. Yet it remains true that those who ignore
history repeat it; as the recycling of unacknowledged cold-war premises
by the Bush administration in Iraq has devastatingly shown.

Number nine: We live in a "post-feminist" epoch

The implication of this claim, supposedly analogous to such terms as
"post-industrial", is that we have no more need for feminism, in
politics, law, everyday life, because the major goals of that movement,
articulated in the 1970s and 1980s, have been achieved. On all counts,
this is a false claim: the "post-feminist" label serves not to register
achievement of reforming goals, but the delegitimation of those goals
themselves.

Number eight: Markets are a "natural" phenomenon which allow for the
efficient allocation of resources and preferences

Markets are not "natural" but are the product of particular societies,
value systems and patterns of state relation to the economy. They are
not efficient allocators of goods, since they ignore the large area of
human activity and need that is not covered by monetary values - from
education and the provision of public works, to human happiness and
fulfillment. In any case the pure market is a fantasy; the examples of
the two most traded commodities in the contemporary world, oil and
drugs, show how political, social and cartel factors override and
distort the workings of supply and demand.

Number seven: Religion should again be allowed, when not encouraged, to
play a role in political and social life

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;From the evangelicals of the United States, to the followers of Popes
">

John Paul II and Benedict XVI, to the Islamists of the middle east, the
claim about the benefits of religion is one of the great, and all too
little challenged, impostures of our time. For centuries, those
aspiring to freedom and democracy, be it in Europe or the middle east,
fought to push back the influence of religion on public life.
Secularism cannot guarantee freedom, but, against the claims of
tradition and superstition, and the uses to which religion is put in
modern political life, from California to Kuwait, it is an essential
bulwark.

Number six: In the modern world, we do not need utopias

Dreaming, the aspiration to a better world and the imagination thereof,
is a necessary part of the human condition.

Number five: We should welcome the spread of English as a world
language

It is obviously of practical benefit that there is one common,
functional, language of trade, air traffic control etc, but the actual
domination of English in today's world has been accompanied by a tide
of cultural arrogance that is itself debasing: a downgrading and
neglect of other languages and cultures across the world, the general
compounding of Anglo-Saxon political and social arrogance, and the
introverted collapse of interest within English-speaking countries
themselves in other peoples and languages, in sum, a triumph of
banality over diversity. One small but universal example: the
imposition on hotel staff across the world, with all its wonderful
diversity of nomenclature, of name tags denoting the bearer as "Mike",
"Johnny" and "Steve".

Number four: The world is divided into incomparable moral blocs, or
civilisations

This view has been aptly termed (by Ernest Gellner) as "liberalism for
the liberals, cannibalism for the cannibals". But a set of common
values is indeed shared across the world: from democracy and human
rights to the defence of national sovereignty and belief in the
benefits of economic development. The implantation of these values is
disputed, in all countries, but not the values themselves. Most states
in the world, whatever their cultural or religious character, have
signed the universalist United Nations declarations on human rights,
starting with the 1948 universal declaration.

Number three: Diasporas have a legitimate role to play in national and
international politics

The notion that emigrant or diaspora communities have a special insight
into the problems of their homeland, or a special moral or political
status in regard to them, is wholly unfounded. Emigrant ethnic
communities play almost always a negative, backward, at once hysterical
and obstructive, role in resolving the conflicts of their countries of
origin: Armenians and Turks, Jews and Arabs, various strands of Irish,
are prime examples on the inter-ethnic front, as are exiles in the
United States in regard to resolving the problems of Cuba, or
policymaking on Iran. English emigrants are less noted for any such
political role, though their spasms of collective inebriation and
conformist ghettoised lifestyles abroad do little to enhance the
reputation of their home country.

Number two: The only thing "they" understand is force

This has been the guiding illusion of hegemonic and colonial thinking
for several centuries. Oppressed peoples do not accept the imposition
of solutions by force: they revolt. It is the oppressors who, in the
end, have to accept the verdict of force, as European empires did in
Latin America, Africa and Asia and as the United States is doing in
Iraq today. The hubris of "mission accomplished" in May 2003 has been
followed by ignominy.

Number one: The world's population problems, and the spread of Aids,
can be solved without the use of condoms

This is not only the most dangerous, but also the most criminal, error
of the modern world. Millions of people will suffer, and die premature
and humiliating deaths, as a result of the policies pursued in this
regard through the United Nations and related aid and public-health
programmes. Indeed, there is no need to ask where the first mass
murderers of the 21st century are; we already know, and their addresses
besides: the Lateran Palace, Vatican City, Rome, and 1600 Pennsylvania
Avenue, Washington DC. Timely arrest and indictment would save many
lives.

True.  But only when people have no control over them.  See 'perfect

&gt; second is Francis Wheen's How Mumbo-Jumbo Conquered the World: A Short
&gt; History of Modern Delusions (2004).

&gt; Some errors are products of the unchallenged, the routine, the
&gt; conventional. Some are new, products of fashion, of novelty, even of

&gt; outcome of a sports contest, the incidence of revolutions, the duration
&gt; of passion or how long an individual will live.
">

And yet it seems humanity is being directed along a path of greater
predictability. Greater determinism, lending itself to greater control
and better - if that's the right word - managment. Tools like Profiles,
almost demand the expected behaviour. Our streamline culture evolving
to cater for this segregation of predictable types. Meanwhile in the
wings we have the psychologists directing the trafic of humanity. These
learned few, projecting upon the many, a simplistic model of desired,
and thus, predictable behaviour.

">

Its not that the world is speeding up, as there is less time to exist at
a slower pace. We are cogs in the machine, the will of this machine coming
before that of the individual or humanity. What is it they say - time is
money? So we fill all available time consuming and producing. Our
entertainments seeming to only to perpetuate these primary directives,
consume and produce. No the world isn't speeding up, its just machine
competing with humanity for its greater efficency.

History suits those prepared to learn from its mistakes. It suits those who
strive to make life better. History suits those who look forward to the new,
with an idea of who and what we were. On the other hand if one have no
imaginattion, and has no need of dreams, then one could simply repeat the
old. Memory dominating the journey at the cost of imagination and invention.  Let us champion the strile ideas of
tradition, ideas replayed out of for
fear of the new, the unpredictable, the unknown.

Epoch, there's so much dread in that word. The feminist Epoch. I wouldn't
call it that. Feminism was the recognition of a monumenatally unfair
state. It was about empathy for those countless generations caught in
the systemised mistreatment of half the population. It was a moment of
awakening from tradition. Feminism now seems to mean a kind of Equality,
few conceptualise in that struggle. The right to be equally stern,
equally brutal, equally crass. Yeah maybe Epoch was the right word after
all.

Markets natural? In what part of nature would you have these Conglomerates
with their wasteful obosolecences, monopolising tastes, in the name of
the greater sales.  Greater profits. The markets are a kind of evolved
dependancy, efficent or self-serving they may be, but to call them natural,
seem to miss what natural really means.

Yeah, what right has man to dream? Why should he strive to make life
better? The only point of dreams is surely to sell the next product,
no?

Utopia, is a yearning in the heart of the dissatisfied, its the goal
sought by the uncomfortble with the strongest sense of his discomfort.
Only those who have it easy could think we have no need utopias. Only
the blinkered or the strile could look on life and not want better.
And yet utopia is the extreme case, the heaven on earth. Its easy to
mock this goal when its presented as this extreme. And so as we mock
we content outselves with what we have, not seeing the trick played
on our imaginations.

&gt; A 2007 warning: the world's twelve worst ideas
&gt;  Fred Halliday
&gt; 8 - 1 - 2007

&gt; The world is full of conformism masquerading as profundity, says Fred
&gt; Halliday, who explodes twelve global falsehoods.

&gt;  In identifying error, two great models at either end of modern times
&gt; exist. The first is part thirty-nine of Francis Bacon's Novum Organon
&gt; (1620), with its four categories of idol: those of the cave (of
&gt; individual men), the tribe (human nature), the marketplace (intercourse
&gt; of men with each other) and the theatre (philosophical dogma). The
&gt; second is Francis Wheen's How Mumbo-Jumbo Conquered the World: A Short
&gt; History of Modern Delusions (2004).

&gt; Some errors are products of the unchallenged, the routine, the
&gt; conventional. Some are new, products of fashion, of novelty, even of
&gt; globalisation. Everyone has his or her own selection, born of
&gt; profession, personality, place. The list could be a long one but, like
&gt; Christ and his disciples, twelve seems a comfortable figure, at once
&gt; extensive and compact. Here, for 2007, is one suggested list, in
&gt; ascending order:

&gt; Number twelve: Human behaviour can be predicted

&gt; In the name of a supposedly &quot;scientific&quot; criterion of knowledge,
&gt; scholars are berated for not predicting the end of the cold war, the
&gt; rise of Islam, 9/11 and much else besides. Yet many natural sciences
&gt; - seismology, evolutionary biology - cannot predict with accuracy
&gt; either. Human affairs themselves, even leaving aside the matter of
&gt; human intention and will, allow of too many variables for such
&gt; calculation. We will never be able to predict with certainty the
&gt; outcome of a sports contest, the incidence of revolutions, the duration
&gt; of passion or how long an individual will live.

&gt; Number eleven: The world is speeding up

&gt; This, a favourite trope of globalisation theorists, confuses
&gt; acceleration in some areas, such as the transmission of knowledge, with
&gt; the fact that large areas of human life continue to demand the same
&gt; time as before: to conceive and bear a child, to learn a language, to
&gt; grow up, to digest a meal, to enjoy a joke, to read a poem. It takes
&gt; the same time to fly from London to New York as it did forty years ago,
&gt; ditto to boil an egg or publish a book. Some activities - such as or
&gt; driving around major western cities, getting through an airport, or
&gt; dying - may take much longer.

&gt; Number ten: We have no need for history

&gt; In recent decades, large areas of intellectual and academic life -
&gt; political thought and analysis, economics, philosophy - have jettisoned
&gt; a concern with history. Yet it remains true that those who ignore
&gt; history repeat it; as the recycling of unacknowledged cold-war premises
&gt; by the Bush administration in Iraq has devastatingly shown.

&gt; Number nine: We live in a &quot;post-feminist&quot; epoch

&gt; The implication of this claim, supposedly analogous to such terms as
&gt; &quot;post-industrial&quot;, is that we have no more need for feminism, in
&gt; politics, law, everyday life, because the major goals of that movement,
&gt; articulated in the 1970s and 1980s, have been achieved. On all counts,
&gt; this is a false claim: the &quot;post-feminist&quot; label serves not to register
&gt; achievement of reforming goals, but the delegitimation of those goals
&gt; themselves.

&gt; Number eight: Markets are a &quot;natural&quot; phenomenon which allow for the
&gt; efficient allocation of resources and preferences

&gt; Markets are not &quot;natural&quot; but are the product of particular societies,
&gt; value systems and patterns of state relation to the economy. They are
&gt; not efficient allocators of goods, since they ignore the large area of
&gt; human activity and need that is not covered by monetary values - from
&gt; education and the provision of public works, to human happiness and
&gt; fulfillment. In any case the pure market is a fantasy; the examples of
&gt; the two most traded commodities in the contemporary world, oil and
&gt; drugs, show how political, social and cartel factors override and
&gt; distort the workings of supply and demand.

&gt; Number seven: Religion should again be allowed, when not encouraged, to
&gt; play a role in political and social life

&gt; &gt;From the evangelicals of the United States, to the followers of Popes
&gt; John Paul II and Benedict XVI, to the Islamists of the middle east, the
&gt; claim about the benefits of religion is one of the great, and all too
&gt; little challenged, impostures of our time. For centuries, those
&gt; aspiring to freedom and democracy, be it in Europe or the middle east,
&gt; fought to push back the influence of religion on public life.
&gt; Secularism cannot guarantee freedom, but, against the claims of
&gt; tradition and superstition, and the uses to which religion is put in
&gt; modern political life, from California to Kuwait, it is an essential
&gt; bulwark.

&gt; Number six: In the modern world, we do not need utopias

&gt; Dreaming, the aspiration to a better world and the imagination thereof,
&gt; is a necessary part of the human condition.

&gt; Number five: We should welcome the spread of English as a world
&gt; language

&gt; It is obviously of practical benefit that there is one common,
&gt; functional, language of trade, air traffic control etc, but the actual
&gt; domination of English in today's world has been accompanied by a tide
&gt; of cultural arrogance that is itself debasing: a downgrading and
&gt; neglect of other languages and cultures across the world, the general
&gt; compounding of Anglo-Saxon political and social arrogance, and the
&gt; introverted collapse of interest within English-speaking countries
&gt; themselves in other peoples and languages, in sum, a triumph of
&gt; banality over diversity. One small but universal example: the
&gt; imposition on hotel staff across the world, with all its wonderful
&gt; diversity of nomenclature, of name tags denoting the bearer as &quot;Mike&quot;,
&gt; &quot;Johnny&quot; and &quot;Steve&quot;.

&gt; Number four: The world is divided into incomparable moral blocs, or
&gt; civilisations

&gt; This view has been aptly termed (by Ernest Gellner) as &quot;liberalism for
&gt; the liberals, cannibalism for the cannibals&quot;. But a set of common
&gt; values is indeed shared across the world: from democracy and human
&gt; rights to the defence of national sovereignty and belief in the
&gt; benefits of economic development. The implantation of these values is
&gt; disputed, in all countries, but not the values themselves. Most states
&gt; in the world, whatever their cultural or religious character, have
&gt; signed the universalist United Nations declarations on human rights,
&gt; starting with the 1948 universal declaration.

&gt; Number three: Diasporas have a legitimate role to play in national and
&gt; international politics

&gt; The notion that emigrant or diaspora communities have a special insight
&gt; into the problems of their homeland, or a special moral or political
&gt; status in regard to them, is wholly unfounded. Emigrant ethnic
&gt; communities play almost always a negative, backward, at once hysterical
&gt; and obstructive, role in resolving the conflicts of their countries of
&gt; origin: Armenians and Turks, Jews and Arabs, various strands of Irish,
&gt; are prime examples on the inter-ethnic front, as are exiles in the
&gt; United States in regard to resolving the problems of Cuba, or
&gt; policymaking on Iran. English emigrants are less noted for any such
&gt; political role, though their spasms of collective inebriation and
&gt; conformist ghettoised lifestyles abroad do little to enhance the
&gt; reputation of their home country.

&gt; Number two: The only thing &quot;they&quot; understand is force

&gt; This has been the guiding illusion of hegemonic and colonial thinking
&gt; for several centuries. Oppressed peoples do not accept the imposition
&gt; of solutions by force: they revolt. It is the oppressors who, in the
&gt; end, have to accept the verdict of force, as European empires did in
&gt; Latin America, Africa and Asia and as the United States is doing in
&gt; Iraq today. The hubris of &quot;mission accomplished&quot; in May 2003 has been
&gt; followed by ignominy.

&gt; Number one: The world's population problems, and the spread of Aids,
&gt; can be solved without the use of condoms

&gt; This is not only the most dangerous, but also the most criminal, error
&gt; of the modern world. Millions of people will suffer, and die premature
&gt; and humiliating deaths, as a result of the policies pursued in this
&gt; regard through the United Nations and related aid and public-health
&gt; programmes. Indeed, there is no need to ask where the first mass
&gt; murderers of the 21st century are; we already know, and their addresses
&gt; besides: the Lateran Palace, Vatican City, Rome, and 1600 Pennsylvania
&gt; Avenue, Washington DC. Timely arrest and indictment would save many
&gt; lives.

Hi Chazwin,

I agree with your article. Would like to add one more to the list.

Global warming is 'natural' phenomena and therefore we can't stop it.

Global warming is direct consequence of industrial era which exhausted
too many  resources on the planet which are crucial to maintaining
fauna and flora ie balance on the planet. Scientists from all over the
world acknowledge this and are asking for quick and decisive action
against pollution and destruction of our natural environment. They all
agree it is not too late to prevent global warming from happening if
*everyone* takes decisive action. Result in not complying with Kyoto
protocol will be devastating. Increase of temperature will increase
ocean level, increase bacterial and viral outbreaks cause global famine
and surely would increase erratic climate devastation as evident by
last year natural disasters.

Help! The consensus is melting...
A common claim of the global warming lobby is that there is an
overwhelming consensus of scientists that man-made global warming is
for real. Well, that consensus is looking less and less overwhelming as
the days pass. Here's what some distinguished scientists have told
the Canadian Prime Minister in an open letter:

Dear Prime Minister:
As accredited experts in climate and related scientific disciplines, we
are writing to propose that balanced, comprehensive public-consultation
sessions be held so as to examine the scientific foundation of the
federal government's climate-change plans.

Observational evidence does not support today's computer climate
models, so there is little reason to trust model predictions of the
future. Yet this is precisely what the United Nations did in creating
and promoting Kyoto and still does in the alarmist forecasts on which
Canada's climate policies are based. While the confident pronouncements
of scientifically unqualified environmental groups may provide for
sensational headlines, they are no basis for mature policy formulation.

The study of global climate change is, as you have said, an 'emerging
science,' one that is perhaps the most complex ever tackled. It may be
many years yet before we properly understand the Earth's climate
system. Nevertheless, significant advances have been made since the
protocol was created, many of which are taking us away from a concern
about increasing greenhouse gases. If, back in the mid-1990s, we knew
what we know today about climate, Kyoto would almost certainly not
exist, because we would have concluded it was not necessary.

'Climate change is real' is a meaningless phrase used repeatedly by
activists to convince the public that a climate catastrophe is looming
and humanity is the cause. Neither of these fears is justified. Global
climate changes all the time due to natural causes and the human impact
still remains impossible to distinguish from this natural 'noise.' The
new Canadian government's commitment to reducing air, land and water
pollution is commendable, but allocating funds to 'stopping climate
change' would be irrational. We need to continue intensive research
into the real causes of climate change and help our most vulnerable
citizens adapt to whatever nature throws at us next.

In Florida, there have been experiments to introduce 'foreign' species to
solve problems created by the release of, you guessed it, 'other' foreign
species.  It's created a true 'rainbow' diversity for sure [very interesting
place BTW for any of you naturists out there].  But the end result has been
the 'supplanting' of the natural flora/fauna that once was indigenous to
this state.  Now, some might argue, as you may be above, that such
'structural' shifts are just a natural way of ecologies adjusting to
change...but then, you speak of the situation not as a native Bass fish.  If
you were that 'native' creature, that is, native by all reason of claim of
propriety to a land as rational humans might otherwise 'understand', then I
doubt you'd like a whole lot of African Talapia's invading your established
territories, crowding out your own possibility of not just thriving [as
today is threatened], but tomorrow's very survival.

I find it very interesting to observe such things in nature, and then to
stand back and draw certain insights to what is happening to us as humans.
It takes a bit of abstraction of course, understanding 'cultures' in the
same light of ecologies etc...But "I" AM very much that Bass fish, making
claim to a certain territory for hundreds of years [actually, culturally
speaking, for millenia], now being 'supplanted' slowly, but inevitably by
things foreign and alien and simply 'that which is NOT I'.  What's worse,
what I think was a superior way to go, that is, Civilization by reason of
the civil human, is being destroyed, again slowly, but inevitably by things
more volatile, violent, aggressive, coarse, primal, and morally
reprehensible.

Put any flagword you want on this...but 2 plus 2 will always equal 4...and
I'm not stupid nor do I think many of us are.  It's just that most feel we
can't prevent what's already been 'caste' for us...and so, everyone tries to
adapt.  How can one adapt to one's own extinction extrapolated into the
future?  Surely, cultural extinction, but it may also be genetic as well.
People sure ain't going to look like my forebears, and pretty soon at that.
I can't accept that.  I won't.  To embrace all this is a sellout of my
ancestry, their struggles, sweat, toil, and bloody suffering to get us this
far.

What has been done is WRONG...wrong, wrong, wrong.  And I want to fight
back.  At the very least, I want to express how I REALLY DO FEEL.  I cringe
every time I see a pretty white girl hanging on the arm of some black
male...and I KNOW he knows I cringe and is at least part of his motivation
to hang that white girl on his arm.  So, pardon me for not laying over and
dying for you.

&gt; &gt; &gt; http://www.opendemocracy.net/globalization/worst_ideas_4228.jsp

&gt; &gt; &gt; A 2007 warning: the world's twelve worst ideas
&gt; &gt; &gt;  Fred Halliday
&gt; &gt; &gt; 8 - 1 - 2007

&gt; &gt; &gt; The world is full of conformism masquerading as profundity, says Fred
&gt; &gt; &gt; Halliday, who explodes twelve global falsehoods.

&gt; &gt; &gt;  In identifying error, two great models at either end of modern times
&gt; &gt; &gt; exist. The first is part thirty-nine of Francis Bacon's Novum Organon
&gt; &gt; &gt; (1620), with its four categories of idol: those of the cave (of
&gt; &gt; &gt; individual men), the tribe (human nature), the marketplace (intercourse
&gt; &gt; &gt; of men with each other) and the theatre (philosophical dogma). The
&gt; &gt; &gt; second is Francis Wheen's How Mumbo-Jumbo Conquered the World: A Short
&gt; &gt; &gt; History of Modern Delusions (2004).

&gt; &gt; &gt; Some errors are products of the unchallenged, the routine, the
&gt; &gt; &gt; conventional. Some are new, products of fashion, of novelty, even of
&gt; &gt; &gt; globalisation. Everyone has his or her own selection, born of
&gt; &gt; &gt; profession, personality, place. The list could be a long one but, like
&gt; &gt; &gt; Christ and his disciples, twelve seems a comfortable figure, at once
&gt; &gt; &gt; extensive and compact. Here, for 2007, is one suggested list, in
&gt; &gt; &gt; ascending order:

&gt; &gt; &gt; Number twelve: Human behaviour can be predicted

&gt; &gt; &gt; In the name of a supposedly &quot;scientific&quot; criterion of knowledge,
&gt; &gt; &gt; scholars are berated for not predicting the end of the cold war, the
&gt; &gt; &gt; rise of Islam, 9/11 and much else besides. Yet many natural sciences
&gt; &gt; &gt; - seismology, evolutionary biology - cannot predict with accuracy
&gt; &gt; &gt; either. Human affairs themselves, even leaving aside the matter of
&gt; &gt; &gt; human intention and will, allow of too many variables for such
&gt; &gt; &gt; calculation. We will never be able to predict with certainty the
&gt; &gt; &gt; outcome of a sports contest, the incidence of revolutions, the duration
&gt; &gt; &gt; of passion or how long an individual will live.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Number eleven: The world is speeding up

&gt; &gt; &gt; This, a favourite trope of globalisation theorists, confuses
&gt; &gt; &gt; acceleration in some areas, such as the transmission of knowledge, with
&gt; &gt; &gt; the fact that large areas of human life continue to demand the same
&gt; &gt; &gt; time as before: to conceive and bear a child, to learn a language, to
&gt; &gt; &gt; grow up, to digest a meal, to enjoy a joke, to read a poem. It takes
&gt; &gt; &gt; the same time to fly from London to New York as it did forty years ago,
&gt; &gt; &gt; ditto to boil an egg or publish a book. Some activities - such as or
&gt; &gt; &gt; driving around major western cities, getting through an airport, or
&gt; &gt; &gt; dying - may take much longer.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Number ten: We have no need for history

&gt; &gt; &gt; In recent decades, large areas of intellectual and academic life -
&gt; &gt; &gt; political thought and analysis, economics, philosophy - have jettisoned
&gt; &gt; &gt; a concern with history. Yet it remains true that those who ignore
&gt; &gt; &gt; history repeat it; as the recycling of unacknowledged cold-war premises
&gt; &gt; &gt; by the Bush administration in Iraq has devastatingly shown.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Number nine: We live in a &quot;post-feminist&quot; epoch

&gt; &gt; &gt; The implication of this claim, supposedly analogous to such terms as
&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;post-industrial&quot;, is that we have no more need for feminism, in
&gt; &gt; &gt; politics, law, everyday life, because the major goals of that movement,
&gt; &gt; &gt; articulated in the 1970s and 1980s, have been achieved. On all counts,
&gt; &gt; &gt; this is a false claim: the &quot;post-feminist&quot; label serves not to register
&gt; &gt; &gt; achievement of reforming goals, but the delegitimation of those goals
&gt; &gt; &gt; themselves.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Number eight: Markets are a &quot;natural&quot; phenomenon which allow for the
&gt; &gt; &gt; efficient allocation of resources and preferences

&gt; &gt; &gt; Markets are not &quot;natural&quot; but are the product of particular societies,
&gt; &gt; &gt; value systems and patterns of state relation to the economy. They are
&gt; &gt; &gt; not efficient allocators of goods, since they ignore the large area of
&gt; &gt; &gt; human activity and need that is not covered by monetary values - from
&gt; &gt; &gt; education and the provision of public works, to human happiness and
&gt; &gt; &gt; fulfillment. In any case the pure market is a fantasy; the examples of
&gt; &gt; &gt; the two most traded commodities in the contemporary world, oil and
&gt; &gt; &gt; drugs, show how political, social and cartel factors override and
&gt; &gt; &gt; distort the workings of supply and demand.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Number seven: Religion should again be allowed, when not encouraged, to
&gt; &gt; &gt; play a role in political and social life

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;From the evangelicals of the United States, to the followers of Popes
&gt; &gt; &gt; John Paul II and Benedict XVI, to the Islamists of the middle east, the
&gt; &gt; &gt; claim about the benefits of religion is one of the great, and all too
&gt; &gt; &gt; little challenged, impostures of our time. For centuries, those
&gt; &gt; &gt; aspiring to freedom and democracy, be it in Europe or the middle east,
&gt; &gt; &gt; fought to push back the influence of religion on public life.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Secularism cannot guarantee freedom, but, against the claims of
&gt; &gt; &gt; tradition and superstition, and the uses to which religion is put in
&gt; &gt; &gt; modern political life, from California to Kuwait, it is an essential
&gt; &gt; &gt; bulwark.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Number six: In the modern world, we do not need utopias

&gt; &gt; &gt; Dreaming, the aspiration to a better world and the imagination thereof,
&gt; &gt; &gt; is a necessary part of the human condition.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Number five: We should welcome the spread of English as a world
&gt; &gt; &gt; language

&gt; &gt; &gt; It is obviously of practical benefit that there is one common,
&gt; &gt; &gt; functional, language of trade, air traffic control etc, but the actual
&gt; &gt; &gt; domination of English in today's world has been accompanied by a tide
&gt; &gt; &gt; of cultural arrogance that is itself debasing: a downgrading and
&gt; &gt; &gt; neglect of other languages and cultures across the world, the general
&gt; &gt; &gt; compounding of Anglo-Saxon political and social arrogance, and the
&gt; &gt; &gt; introverted collapse of interest within English-speaking countries
&gt; &gt; &gt; themselves in other peoples and languages, in sum, a triumph of
&gt; &gt; &gt; banality over diversity. One small but universal example: the
&gt; &gt; &gt; imposition on hotel staff across the world, with all its wonderful
&gt; &gt; &gt; diversity of nomenclature, of name tags denoting the bearer as &quot;Mike&quot;,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Johnny&quot; and &quot;Steve&quot;.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Number four: The world is divided into incomparable moral blocs, or
&gt; &gt; &gt; civilisations

&gt; &gt; &gt; This view has been aptly termed (by Ernest Gellner) as &quot;liberalism for
&gt; &gt; &gt; the liberals, cannibalism for the cannibals&quot;. But a set of common
&gt; &gt; &gt; values is indeed shared across the world: from democracy and human
&gt; &gt; &gt; rights to the defence of national sovereignty and belief in the
&gt; &gt; &gt; benefits of economic development. The implantation of these values is
&gt; &gt; &gt; disputed, in all countries, but not the values themselves. Most states
&gt; &gt; &gt; in the world, whatever their cultural or religious character, have
&gt; &gt; &gt; signed the universalist United Nations declarations on human rights,
&gt; &gt; &gt; starting with the 1948 universal declaration.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Number three: Diasporas have a legitimate role to play in national and
&gt; &gt; &gt; international politics

&gt; &gt; &gt; The notion that emigrant or diaspora communities have a special insight
&gt; &gt; &gt; into the problems of their homeland, or a special moral or political
&gt; &gt; &gt; status in regard to them, is wholly unfounded. Emigrant ethnic
&gt; &gt; &gt; communities play almost always a negative, backward, at once hysterical
&gt; &gt; &gt; and obstructive, role in resolving the conflicts of their countries of
&gt; &gt; &gt; origin: Armenians and Turks, Jews and Arabs, various strands of Irish,
&gt; &gt; &gt; are prime examples on the inter-ethnic front, as are exiles in the
&gt; &gt; &gt; United States in regard to resolving the problems of Cuba, or
&gt; &gt; &gt; policymaking on Iran. English emigrants are less noted for any such
&gt; &gt; &gt; political role, though their spasms of collective inebriation and
&gt; &gt; &gt; conformist ghettoised lifestyles abroad do little to enhance the
&gt; &gt; &gt; reputation of their home country.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Number two: The only thing &quot;they&quot; understand is force

&gt; &gt; &gt; This has been the guiding illusion of hegemonic and colonial thinking
&gt; &gt; &gt; for several centuries. Oppressed peoples do not accept the imposition
&gt; &gt; &gt; of solutions by force: they revolt. It is the oppressors who, in the
&gt; &gt; &gt; end, have to accept the verdict of force, as European empires did in
&gt; &gt; &gt; Latin America, Africa and Asia and as the United States is doing in
&gt; &gt; &gt; Iraq today. The hubris of &quot;mission accomplished&quot; in May 2003 has been
&gt; &gt; &gt; followed by ignominy.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Number one: The world's population problems, and the spread of Aids,
&gt; &gt; &gt; can be solved without the use of condoms

&gt; &gt; &gt; This is not only the most dangerous, but also the most criminal, error
&gt; &gt; &gt; of the modern world. Millions of people will suffer, and die premature
&gt; &gt; &gt; and humiliating deaths, as a result of the policies pursued in this
&gt; &gt; &gt; regard through the United Nations and related aid and public-health
&gt; &gt; &gt; programmes. Indeed, there is no need to ask where the first mass
&gt; &gt; &gt; murderers of the 21st century are; we already know, and their addresses
&gt; &gt; &gt; besides: the Lateran Palace, Vatican City, Rome, and 1600 Pennsylvania
&gt; &gt; &gt; Avenue, Washington DC. Timely arrest and indictment would save many
&gt; &gt; &gt; lives.

&gt; &gt; Hi Chazwin,

&gt; &gt; I agree with your article. Would like to add one more to the list.

oh shit... I thought I was addressing SammyBaby in the thread about race
mixing but posted into this thread instead.  If you read the posts in the
'race mixing' thread, this previous post will make sense; otherwise probably
looks out of place.  Sorry.

This thread though [the 12 assumptions or whatever] seemed idiotic to me
actually...a kind of 'namby pamby' dissertation one might hear in the
teacher's lounge where political correctness and the liberal ontrage reigns
socially.  Imagine a Victorian parlour where everyone is so 'guarded' as to
what they say [or think actually] for reason of not wanting to show their
deeper desires, lusts, passions etc etc.  There is a social nicety going on,
people espousing 'party line' thinking just that they do not threaten their
membership in that group...else, be called 'fascist Dinasaur' [ha, actually,
I'd love to be a dinasaur, one of the big ones, so I could come there and
eat you, LOL].

In other words GET REAL. I find there is a great 'lapse of reality' in
academia these days in regards to what is happening to us [human beings]
socially.  They [academians] live in sky castles...and life is a theory.

God...'Is he Is, or Is he Ain't?  That is the whole defining question that
is the fulcrum upon which human existence now revolves.  If those like me
are wrong, then you have no worry.  I'll be dead short coming and you and
yourn' can bask in the jungle cruelty that you bring upon your heads.  But
if I have even an inkling of correctness in how I see [those like me], woe
betide this ocean of homo sapiens immaculate intellectual prowess...arrogant
bumblewoods by any other name.  Arrogance is a blindness you know...where
the perp 'knows not thyself', but is ready to change the rest of us for sake
of a better measure of how they'd re-arrange the 'house' for their own suit.
You may not be the owner of that house you see, but like a dog just pissing
everywhere, playing with spiritual turds in the back yard.  Time will tell
of course.  Stay tuned.

Mohammed was a screwball perhaps...but by the gods, his world is enabling
the human spirit these days at least, far more than the watered down social
club of modern Christiandom where 'morality' is being given over to Pussy
Galore's oversight, all in the name of her ascension and not God's.  The
scientific mud WE exist in now is like a quagmire upon the brain to find
ANYTHING that means...well, Anything.  Talk about survival.  You can't
survive 'absolute' materialism.  No one can...for long...not as a 'thinking'
creature 'aware'.  Nietzche had it wrong.  What does not kill us does not
make us stronger, but what does not make us stronger, kills us.  I know this
is so hard to the intellect, that wants so much to exist upon 'fact'...upon
the certainty of it's reason, but BEING is a study all to itself...and
perhaps stretches across ALL TIME...even to eternity.

Whether you call it Sir Frederick Stories, or illusions of mind...to sustain
us as emotional creatures,  our minds need somthing to HOPE upon.  And in
any other book, past or present, I'd still call that HOPE God.  You take it
from there...anywhere you want to.  ME?  I'm pretty sure all this [life on
earth] is temporary whatever the case.  I'm personally losing sympathy for
idiocy...'they know not what they do' thing is getting old.  I can go
anywhere you can go 'scientifically'...but apprently you cannot go where
I've been 'spiritually'.  Shame on you for that.

I applaud every time I see a white girl on the arm of a black guy; a
yellow man with a brown girl; a pink man with a tan girl becuae they
have had the courage to realise what a dumb fuck like you will never
know and the courage to make wankers like you cringe. They know that we
are all one species and are only separated by ignorance and stupidity.
They know that the colour of skin is no more relevant than the colour
of eyes. They might also know that the worse thing we can do as a
species is to choose  a mate within our own clade. Becasue racial
purity is a lie and only leads to inbred mindless fuck-wits like you.

No, this shit will never make sense.
And yes, it is well out of place - but I will excuse you because you
are probably racially "pure" and therefore a bit inbred and sadly not
very mentally capable: poor thing!
Don't worry maybe you are sterile too and your genes will disappear

If I might engage you for a moment.  Are you a white guy?  This would
explain a lot if you aren't.

You have an illness - don't worry it is not harmful to you only to the

You can overcome this feeling. Go and have a chat with some black
people - maybe someone who shares a similar interest like playing darts
or football. Maybe you should join the army and fight side-by-side with
your fellow (I am guessing) Americans despite their colour. You will
find that common cause makes you change the focus of your Xenophobia
onto people of a different religion/nation as long as they are the
eneny.
Military organisations expoit these innate evolved tendencies for thier
own ends. Suckers: there's one born every second.

I wrote a long return...but I think I'll just leave it with a small reply
here...

that I think it would be quite unnatural and odd that ANY white guy actually
LIKE what is going on.  That would be quite irrational indeed [again, that
Stockholm syndrome seems relevant here].  That such a 'resistant' voice has
been silenced should be cause for those more responsible to raise a brow as
to what exactly IS going on.  That silence is deafening you know.  [but only
in public].

Well, I will mention one more thing that I think is important to consider.
I think academics and intellectuals have 'surrounded' themselves with
groupthink in their various social enclaves [which have become very very
liberal in view] and this emboldens them to think the masses think like
them.  Nothing could be further from the truth. There is a giant disconnect
going on and the chasm grows. Just because you put a label on something does
NOT mean you understand what is going on or that you have much depth.  It
just means you can read and regurgitate things.

&gt; &gt; You can overcome this feeling. Go and have a chat with some black
&gt; &gt; people - maybe someone who shares a similar interest like playing darts
&gt; &gt; or football. Maybe you should join the army and fight side-by-side with
&gt; &gt; your fellow (I am guessing) Americans despite their colour. You will
&gt; &gt; find that common cause makes you change the focus of your Xenophobia
&gt; &gt; onto people of a different religion/nation as long as they are the
&gt; &gt; eneny.
&gt; &gt; Military organisations expoit these innate evolved tendencies for thier
&gt; &gt; own ends. Suckers: there's one born every second.

&gt; &gt;  It is like a rooster seeing
&gt; &gt;&gt; a weasel in the hen house I think.  My instinct alarms like a loud
&gt; &gt;&gt; siren...'Danger Will Robinson, Danger'...but the danger I feel...it is
&gt; &gt;&gt; hard
&gt; &gt;&gt; to explain really.  It is like Abraham Lincoln and Ben Franklin and
&gt; &gt;&gt; Charlemagne, and Socrates and every indescript forebear that ever existed
&gt; &gt;&gt; streching back millenia, 'screaming' out inside me...'Danger'.

&gt; &gt; Cock-a-Doodle-Do!!!!!    It is all lrrational. How the fuck would the
&gt; &gt; USA or the UK function without black people in the civil service and
&gt; &gt; the army?
&gt; &gt; Just consider yourself lucky that you are born white with the many
&gt; &gt; advantages of your colour.
&gt; &gt; Allow them the crumbs off your table because you can be damn sure that
&gt; &gt; the world is full of blacks that are more clever than you that are in
&gt; &gt; worse jobs.

&gt; I wrote a long return...but I think I'll just leave it with a small reply
&gt; here...

&gt; that I think it would be quite unnatural and odd that ANY white guy actually
&gt; LIKE what is going on.  That would be quite irrational indeed [again, that
&gt; Stockholm syndrome seems relevant here].

Your words so you to be ignorant and stupid.
Why don't you think for a moment about what you have said.
Why would it be unnatural for a white guy to applaud interracial sex,
but natural for a black guy to applaud interracial sex?
In what way is is irrational to promote the prospect of racial mixing
and racial harmony? Why would it be irrational for me but rational for
a black?

If misegenation is unnatural then it would apply equally to me and a
black person.
If misegenation is iirational then the same contradiction would apply.
Your brain is fucked. You are an evolutionary throwback, a dim-witted
Neanderthal.
You area victim of racial purity which leads to inbreeeding. Have you
never heard of hybrid vigour?

That such a 'resistant' voice has

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; been silenced should be cause for those more responsible to raise a brow as
&gt; to what exactly IS going on.  That silence is deafening you know.  [but only
&gt; in public].

&gt; Well, I will mention one more thing that I think is important to consider.
&gt; I think academics and intellectuals have 'surrounded' themselves with
&gt; groupthink in their various social enclaves [which have become very very
&gt; liberal in view] and this emboldens them to think the masses think like
&gt; them.  Nothing could be further from the truth. There is a giant disconnect
&gt; going on and the chasm grows.

The chasm is in your head. The group-think mentality is stuck in what
you percieveas a "white race" but there is not such thing and never
will be. You are a complete ass!
