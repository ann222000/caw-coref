Could it be the brake booster?

Toyota pickup, 1987 2WD 22R engine.  At a stop light the brake pedal
slowly (1 min. or less) goes to the floor.  I obtained and installed a
rebuilt master cylinder and bleed the entire system.  The pedal still
sinks to the floor.  Let's assume the rebuilt replacement is OK.  I am
now suspecting the brake booster.  Are these customer rebuildable?  Or
is it just another part to buy already rebuilt?  I am prepared to get
inside it myself.

You have a bad master cylinder. Try to find a new one instead of a
rebuilt. A bad brake booster would cause a hard pedal because you would have
no assit. The only thing that would cause the pedal to go to the floor would
be a bad master cylinder or a leak.

I bet its a wheel cylinder.

Bend down and look at the inside of your tires.  If you see one or more wet,
you've found your problem.

I was thinking that the booster could be losing air.

And I should have mentioned that the system is NOT losing any fluid.

I assume the rebuilt is NOT okay.

Did you bleed the new MC while it was still on the bench? If not, it can
hold pockets of air that will affect braking performance. Having said that,
a sinking pedal is the result of leaky seals within the MC, or a leaky seal
at a wheel cylinder/caliper. If the leak was at a wheel, the fluid would be
on the outside, and you could see the trouble. There should be enough on the
outside that it would be painfully obvious.

I completely discount the brake booster as a source for your trouble.

If you are not losing any fluid, then you replaced a faulty MC with another
faulty MC.

If the booster was loosing air ( actually vacuum ) you would have a hard
pedal. The booster helps apply the brakes so you don't have to press on the
brake pedal that hard with your foot. If the brake booster wasn't working
you would have to press on the brake pedal very hard to get the truck to
stop.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

If you are absolutely sure you are not losing any fluid then you have a
bad master cylinder. Some rebuilt master cylinders are of such poor quality
that you may end up purchasing several before you get one that works. That
is why I would always recomend you buy a new one.

Faulty rebuilt master cylinders and unfortunately not uncommon.  If
only seals are replaced without a good honing of the bore then an
internal leak can occur which causes loss of hydraulic pressure
without a leak being visible.  Bench bleeding is often required before
installation too.  A crude test of the brake booster is to push hard
on the brake pedal with the engine off.  Start the engine while
continuing to apply pressure to the brake pedal.  If you feel the
pedal go down slightly once the engine starts, the booster is probably
working as it is applying boost, i.e. vacuum, to the pedal.  You could
also try taking the vacuum hose off the booster and seeing if there is
brake fluid inside.  It should be dry.  Good luck.  Al

boosters cannot normally be repaired, in the toyota manual is a
procedure for checking airtightness of the booster, I have gotten bad
rebuilds before on master cylinders, re-check your bleeds or try
another cylinder
