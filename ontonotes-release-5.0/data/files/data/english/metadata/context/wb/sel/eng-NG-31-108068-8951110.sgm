Last night I bought 4 boxes of .22 Short cartridges at Wal-Mart.  The
clerk at the cash register asked &quot;are these for a handgun or for a
rifle?&quot;  My first impulse was to simply say &quot;yes&quot;, but Wal-Mart is so
weird/paranoid in their love-hate relationship with all things
gun-related that I came to my senses and said they were for a rifle.

My guess is that if you are 18 or 19 or 20, better be buying those .22
shells only for a rifle if you go to Wal-Mart.   I'm tempted to go
back there with my 20-yr-old friend who is just back from a Marine
Corps-sponsored tour of lovely downtown Baghdad and see what happens.

Nah, life's too short.....

Same thing happened to me at Dick's Sporting Goods when I went to
get some 9mm. I was actually buying them for a rifle but was concerned
that they would even ask me!

I'm also sure that you must be 21 to purchase handgun ammo but 18 for rifle
ammo but in the case of .22 ammo they are the same go figure.

If I recall the cash registers at the sporting gun/ammo counters require a Y
or N be entered to finish the transaction. It's a WalMart thing.

I ran into that buying .357Mag ammo at a store in the Binghamton, NY area. I
tried explaining to the clerk that it could be fired in both/either, but all
she wanted was a simple yes/no answer. When I said &quot;pistol&quot;, she asked for
ID. I showed her my concealed carry license (what better ID for buying
ammo?), but she refused it, demanding to see a driver's license... (The guy
behind the counter with her exchanged looks with me....)

Your 20 year old Marine Corps-sponsored friend could attempt to purchase
handgun ammunition from Wal-Mart, and it would not be sold to him.

Simple as that.

I just drool a lot while I say:

Oh, I'm not allowed to have any guns anymore.  I just like to look at
the pretty bullets.  Oooh, shiny

(In truth, I hear the register beep at them, they look at the
remaining strands of gray hair and punch the next button w/out asking
me.)

I explained to them once that the question was meaningless because now
almost any cartridge, even traditional rifle cartridges, can be fired from
handguns.  The clerk said that she knows that but that it is store policy to
ask and also not to sell any cartridge stated to be intended for handguns to
anyone under 21.  The drudges that work there frequently do know about guns
but are under the domination of corporate-level lawyers that want to
minimize their exposure to lawsuits.

Well Dan, you know, you can be given a machine gun and a pistol and sent to
fight, get maimed mentally and physically, and perhaps, lose your life for
these fat-cat internationalist slobs, but cannot buy .22 ammo in your home
town, and in the cases of many large cities, cannot even own a gun.  Nice
situation we have here, hypocrisy in its most raw form.  Tells us what kind
of country we REALLY have.

BTDT - just out of Boot 10 yrs ago. They won't sell it if you say for
a handgun. I asked after purchasing it for a rifle - dipshits!

You're blaming the WRONG PEOPLE!  It's a FEDERAL LAW that a person under 21
cannot buy ammunition intended for a handgun!

Or at any other sales outlet!

He'll be unable to buy it....just like my 20 year-old E-5 son was when he
got back from &quot;Summer Camp&quot; in Afghanistan....he couldn't buy a beer either!

Not just Wal-Mart, but any licensed dealer in the US.

18USC922

(b) It shall be unlawful for any licensed importer, licensed
manufacturer, licensed dealer, or licensed collector to sell or
deliver -
(1) any firearm or ammunition to any individual who the
licensee knows or has reasonable cause to believe is less than
eighteen years of age, and, if the firearm, or ammunition is
other than a shotgun or rifle, or ammunition for a shotgun or
rifle, to any individual who the licensee knows or has
reasonable cause to believe is less than twenty-one years of
age;

1. Lawsuits are not the main concern, but rather compliance with federal
law:

(x)
(1) It shall be unlawful for a person to sell, deliver, or otherwise
transfer to a person who the transferor knows or has reasonable
cause to believe is a juvenile—
(A) a handgun; or
(B) ammunition that is suitable for use only in a handgun.
(2) It shall be unlawful for any person who is a juvenile to knowingly
possess—
(A) a handgun; or
(B) ammunition that is suitable for use only in a handgun.

http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode18/usc_sec_18_00000922-...

I might add that many store clerks do not have a law degree and might
not be as knowledgeable as they could be with current BATF regs, black
letter law under Title 18, or current relevant case law, as surprising
as all that may be.

2.  As to gun knowledge by the average clerk, granted. How would you do
as a clerk answering questions in other sections of the store,maybe the
perfume section or ladies shoes' section? We're gun enthusiasts, most
people aren't. Very few clerks know anything about the items they work
with, and for the pay they get, they don't care. I used to manage a
hardware store and had to pay minimum wage (owner's decision, not mine)
and my clerks didn't know a nut from a bolt, and they quit or got fired
before they learned.

Bill

Wal-mart asks that for any cartridge that is commonly found in rifle
and pistol guns (even 9mm and .45acp IIRC, due to carbines).  Most of
the time they don't even know what the question is for.  It's just
that your repsonse determines the date displayed when the computer
asks &quot;Is the customer born before 12/31/xx?&quot;.  21 years before current
date if you respond handgun and 18 years before if you respond rifle.

If you're too young though, they'll just refuse to sell it to you.
You're not going to jail or anything ;).

I called Big 5 yesterday to see what brands of .22LR Match ammo they
stock. After 4 or 5  minutes and three clueless clerks, I finally
spoke to one helpful young lady:

&quot;This one says &quot;Rimfire&quot; - is that it?&quot;

I politely said thanks and hung up. Went by later and checked it out
for myself - very poor selection and way overpriced. My local WalMart
doesn't even stock shooting stuff any more... not even ammo. Just
airsoft and paintball cr@p. ;(

It's not just Wal Mart's policy. It is Federal law that no &quot;handgun
ammunition&quot; be sold to anyone under 21. For cartridges that can be
used in both handguns and rifles the clerk has to reasonably believe
that the ammo will be used in a rifle and one really good way to
establish that is to flat out ask the customer.

And this is why I hated to hear the cheers from gun owners when the so-
called assault weapon ban was repealed. Everyone was so happy (ding-
dong the witch is dead) when they were able to again buy so-called
high-cap mags, folding stocks, removable muzzle brakes and bayonet
mounts and totally missed the point or plainly didn't care of the poor
bastard getting his ass shot at in the name of freedom while he still
can't come home and buy ammunition at a local China-mart or a handgun
at Slappy Jacks. How easy we forget and selfish we are and yet still
rejoice and get a warm and fuzzy feeling because we put some dopey
magnetic on out vehicles that was probably made in some slave labor
country saying &quot;Support out Troops&quot;, sure...

I think the concept of &quot;appropriate&quot; has been stretched just a little.

p.s. maybe &quot;applicable&quot; is a term we could all agree on.

I remenber my first pint - I joined the British Army as a &quot;Boy Soldier&quot; at
age 16. The first weekend they turned us loose we had to wear uniform, and
we went into Reading, to a pub and ordered pints all round. The publican
(owner - WWII vintage) said, and I quote, &quot;you're old enough to wear the
uniform; you're old enough to drink a pint.&quot; and served us the beer. The
legal drinking age was 18 at that time (early 1964).

Fast forward, after I left the Army in 1974, I took up competitive .22
Smallbore Rifle and bought an Anschutz Supermatch 1413 (Single shot target
rifle). The local plods had to inspect the rifle, and the separatly stored
bolt and the separately stored .22 ammunition monthly. One plod reminded me
to not take the rifle onto the moor to shoot rabbits.Like I would drag a 16
pound, $1500 precision rifle cross-country ...

Anyway, here in the US, (I now live in Florida)  the same level of idiocy is
starting to take place when you have qualifying questions about .22 rounds
at Wally-World.

Exactly correct.  Wal-Mart knows perfectly well that the law is silly, but
they are required to obey it.

A person 18-20 can legally buy a box of .22 ammo for use in a rifle, but
he can NOT legally buy the exact same box of ammo for use in a handgun.

It gets worse!

An 18-20 year old can be given (or can inherit) a .22 handgun.  It is
perfectly legal for him (being at least 18 years old) to possess that
handgun and ammunition for it.  He just can't buy either.  [An under-18
can own a handgun, but can not take possession.]

So, our 18-20 year old, having previously legally bought .22 ammo with the
intention of using it with his .22 rifle, can legally use some of his .22
rifle ammo in a .22 handgun that he was just given or inherited.

It doesn't have to make sense.  It is FEDERAL LAW!

Now, it would NOT be prudent for an 18-20 year old to own a rifle and a
handgun in the same caliber.  Put another way, an 18-20 year old handgun
owner (whether by gift or inheritance) should NOT purchase any ammo in
that handgun's caliber until he turns 21.  Otherwise an aggressive
prosecutor may accuse him of having purchased handgun ammo illegally by
claiming that it was for his rifle.

Alternatively, lock the handgun away in trust until he turns 21.

I believe there are certain age related issues with respect to buying
ammo. I believe you have to be 21 here in Florida to purchase or buy
ammo for any hand gun. Unless you have a concealed weapons license, you
still have a waiting period here in Florida if you buy a handgun. Also,
whenever they call in the FBI check, the first thing they ask is whether
it is a long gun or hand gun. I can buy a hand gun, ammo and not wait,
but I have a concealed weapons license. Prior to getting that I had to
wait and I also had to prove I was over 21. There are local and state
laws that can come into play as well. I can actually own a pistol here.
In New York, I had to get a special pistol permit signed by a county
judge. I happened to live in a county that was anti gun so getting the
permit was impossible. Anyway, some Wal-mart's here sell ammo and guns
while others do not. I guess that if you want the ammo you better answer
the question or look elsewhere. I mail order most of my ammo and
reloading supplies. So far so good.

When my father returned home from the pacific theater in 1945 (he was
awarded the silver star for bravery during the main attack on the
Philippians) he was refused a glass of beer at his hometown bar because he
is an American Indian; it was still illegal to serve Indians alcohol in the
United States. When he pointed out the fact that the bartender was born in
Norway and not an American citizen and perhaps he (my father) had earned a
cold glass of beer after serving his country for four years...he was then
*asked* to leave the bar.

Pretty much nothing.  That same Marine can go file a suit saying that the
law infringes on his 2nd Amendment right without having to step foot in
Wally World.  All he needs is a team of great lawyers and lottsa money.

sell guns. They could sell what they had in inventory, but could no

Yes, the laws are screwball.  I hate WalMart, and swear I'll never go there
again every time that I go there to buy the cheapest ammo available within
about 25 miles.  The same clerk that has sold ammo to me at least 20 times,
asks to see my DL for proof that I am over 21 (I am nearly 70).  I don't

Don't make it so hard on the Walmart empolyees.  They just have to follow
the dumb rules to keep their jobs.  Blame the idiots in government that make
up the stupid rules.  Email, write, or call them.  Vote them out of office.
Blame it partly on the gun control act of , what is the year 64 ? or go way
back to 34 or what ever that year was.

When I was a minor, I regularly went to buy a box of .22 ammo to feed my
rifle. I doubt if and others like me were any kind of threat to society
warranting such a restriction
It's total nonsense to have such a restriction

Also, when you're old enough to bear a weapon IN uniform in service of your
country, you have de facto demonstrated to the state your right to bear
arms, including ALL firearms OUT of uniform
There should be no restriction of the ammo you can buy.

If you are 21 or older, it's none of their business.  (they should ask
to see your ID first, and if you are old enough there is no need to ask
what it's for)  Every once in a great while, you get a clerk that knows

That is what they've told me.  The retired USA Marine who ran the
sporting goods counter at our friendly neighborhood Wal-Mart used to
simply respond to it (assessing me as being old enough for a handgun?)
and didn't ask.  But others who worked there did.

Some stores lost their gun departments, others did not. I expect it
was a corporate decision based on sales volume.

This was just in CA.  In ID, WA, and OR, the WalMarts still sell
guns...  Not surprising considering how much of a quagmire the
gun laws in CA are...

Minors are under the age of 18.

And no sane lawyer would take the case.  The kid isn't 21, and the law
says he has to be.  He can't legally purchase alcohol either.

The elimination of *any* injustice is always a cause for celebration, even
when there is still unjustice remaining.

I understand the argument about withholding celebration until final and
total victory.  However, that victory is not in sight; and may not happen
during many of our lifetimes.  Successful prosecution of a war requires
keeping the morale of our side up AND demoralizing the other side.

Their lads and lassies in the trenches saw a long and very expensive
battle come to nothing.  Worse, they were confronted with the awful
reality that the battle wasn't worth fighting.  The majority of them were
recruited, not for ideology, but with the false promise that it would make
their neighborhoods safer.  The more of them that become disgusted and
give up the fight, the better for us.

Remember that the grunts on the other side are NOT the enemy; it is their
leadership who lie to them.  We may not be able to turn around many of the
grunts to our side; but getting them to decide that the battle isn't worth
fighting any more is good enough.

Sure it's unjust that 18 year olds can be made to put their lives on the
line, but can't buy a handgun or handgun ammo.  It's unjust that they
can't buy beer.  It was unjust that they couldn't vote prior to 1971.

Federal Law has NEVER been about what is just, or even what makes sense.

An older and wiser man than me once said that it is a fallacy to assert
that all people have rights.  Rather, the only people who have rights --
who DESERVE rights -- are those who DEMAND rights.

If your rights are denied, you must demand them to get them.  If your
rights are respected, you must demand them to keep them.

I see almost no effort on the part of 18 year olds to demand the right to
buy handguns and handgun ammunition; nor for that matter for the right to
buy beer.  I daresay that if the voting age was kicked up to 21 that few
18-20s would protest.

Some -- but sadly not all -- gun owners recognize that the future of RKBA
depends upon us all making an ongoing and vociferous demand for RKBA.  If
we turn apathetic like the majority of 18-20 year olds seem to be, we will
share their fate.

I have one word of advice for buying ammunition at Walmart: Don't.

To me, at least, it's worth the extra few cents to keep my local gun
shop in business.

This would seem to be a BOGUS Claim, as EACH Individual Store is
REQUIRED to have it's own FFL, and each Clerk, that worked in the Gun
Sales Department would need to be Registered as AN Accountable Seller,
under that FFL with ATF.  There are no Blanket FFL Licenses for
Corporations.  It is an individual Sales LOCATION THING.
