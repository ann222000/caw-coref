Help, I need to locate a clean title for an 88 Suzuki samurai, I was given
one by a friend that was totaled in an accident, I have already put it back
together, and it is a vary nice runner, but I have no pink. I live in
California, and the DMV has been no help. I know years ago when I was
building VW we were able to replace Vin's and re-title, as a new vehicle.

If you have any suggestions please send them to me.

"/> You will never have a 'clean' title on a wrecked vehicle.

Doesnt your friend have the title? If the insurance company paid off on the
total and your friend bought it back they should have issued him a new
salvaged
title.

if your friend didnt buy it back, who was the last owner? The insurance
company?

You might also try running a Carfax report to locate the title history
possibly even
the last title number issued and try to get a duplicate issued.

Good luck, I buy vehicles in 20-25 states and CA is by far the worst for
getting any
help on titles.

Just my thoughts.

"/> Going through this myself. First you should have a Salvage Certificate for
the vehicle.

http://www.dmv.ca.gov/pubs/brochures/howto/htvr16.htm

You need to get form 488 (from a DMV office) but you pretty much have to mail
it in to DMV HQ in Sacramento. None of the field offices can handle this
form, although they can send it in for you, along with taking your $3. If you
have no title for it, you an fill out the part the gets a duplicate title,
too. Anyway, it took me 3 visits to DMV offices and 2 phone calls to get the
same story twice, which is essentially related above.

Then, you take the certificate and a buch of other forms to an inspection
station and get brake and light checks, etc:

http://www.dmv.ca.gov/

On my first DMV visit, I went to the info desk and was given a huge packet of
forms for the whole salvage process. Form 488 was included as well as the
inspection forms, etc.

Dennis, have you ever had to chase down a copy of what I think is called
&quot;Port of Entry Certificate&quot; for a car that came from Canada? It is issued
by Customs, not sure if Canadian or US.

I recently bought a car here in the US with an Ontario title and did not
know about the POE Cert. I cannot transfer the title to me until I produce
a copy of that certificate. The selling dealer doesn't have it and is
trying his best to locate it but any suggestions are welcome.

Rufus

Sounds like your dealer is a flake. The only way to get a title is to get a
certified original form 7501 which is issued by US Customs to the Registered
Importer. Your dealer should know where he got the car from, hopefully the
Importer. Importers are required to place a sticker on the door by the vin
tag identifying themselves, look at the inside of your door and see if one
is there. The importer should have the 7501.

If there is no tag and your dealer didnt get it from an importer give him
the car back. You cant get a title w/o an original 7501. The dealer shouldnt
have sold the car on a Canadian title. The dealer should have gotten a US
title before he sold the car.

Sadly, if you cant find out who imported the car, youre up the proverbial
creek.

You can get a salvage title. Take in all the receipts for parts and the bill
of sale for the totalled vehicle and they will give you a salvage, or
reconstructed, title. You will need the body, chassis, and engine serial
numbers, and they will run the numbers to make sure the vehicle hasnt been
reported stolen. This title is usually a different color than a normal
title, to let future prospective buyers know the vehicle has been
reconstructed from parts.

Dennis,

I was just about to post an update when I saw this. Short version of long
story. The dealer was able to contact the transport company who brought the
vehicle through customs. They in turn overnight mailed me 5 documents
related to the importing. Took a few days from start to finish but was
resolved.

Now a word to anyone else buying a car from outside the USA... when I got
to my DMV and gave them the paper the one they wanted was only a summary
declaration, no breakdown only a total value of $26,400. The DMV Gestapo
was all set to charge me the sales tax of 5% on this amount!!! Luckily I
also had been sent a detailed manifest of the 6 vehicles on the transporter
showing description, serial numbers, and declared value. The car in
question was declared at $2400 US and I pointed that out, thereby verifying
my purchase price of $3000 as noted on the title and bill of sale.
Happy ending - paid sales tax of $150 on the $3000 purchase price and now
have the car titled and registered to me.

the car?? 1937 Chevy, complete, solid, runs and drives, and basically needs
TLC.

Thank you and all those who responded to my original question.

You can imagine the fun I had with a CA DMV gal when I got my '57
Chevy transfer completed. Here's the story:
Bought the car for $500 from a guy. Got it running and went down to
the Smog Station where it failed miserablely. Took all that
documentation down to the DMV and started the paperwork.
Put the car up on blocks and went through everything, including
getting all of the rust holes filled. The car was at a friends place
so it took over 2 years to do this work. Got a 1 day ticket to move
the car and got it to easily pass the smog test. Took all the
paperwork back down to the DMV and they started totalling up all kinds
of fees, late fees and fines for failing to pay the fees and late
fees. Total came to over $2000. I then remarked to them that it was
thier failure for not finishing the transfer to my name and that
caused the supervisor to come over. They backed everything out and
charged me for the title transfer and that year's reg. which was about
$50 total. That delay also let me title the car properly as a YOM
plate car (in CA you pay the personalized plate rate with unlimited
milage) and the gal had a sad look on her face when I said thank you
and left.
You just need to know how to play the game. In my case, they refused
to allow the transfer until I had a condition met and that stopped the
clocks on the penalties that could have been involved because the
delay was failure to pass the smog emissions and they forgot to make a
timeperiod in which I must pass the test or destroy the car.

Why did you need to get a '57 smog inspected? Was this a long time ago?
For
the last 15 years or so cars that old have been smog-exempt in CA. I have
a '35,
a '52, a '53, and two '55s, none of which need smog inspections. I
believe the cut-off
year is '65 or '66, or at least was until recently, when they went to a
moving window.
Don't quote me on any of this - I have a heck of a time keeping track of

It;s only been a few years (5 I think) that the smog on transfer
stopped for the older cars. Once you had the car, there is indeed no
smog test required. The age is 25 years now for the every other year
smog test (don't know how far back the smog on transfer goes tho but
it may be the same now) and the change a few years ago also started
the sliding window as previous to that, '66 was the first year of smog
testing. I started the transfer in '91 and it was titled finally in
'93.

window won't come into effect until 2003, when 1973 = 30 years. Unless
somebody knows different, of course.

What scares me is that they might change the rules. We bought a '78
monsterhome that was smog-proof until they decided a few years later that
vehicles that heavy really did need to be smogged after all. A real
nightmare.

Bastards.

"/> The only one that I know of is the NOx device required at change of
title. The NOx device (nitrogen oxide) was a retarder to the ignition
timing. I restored a '56 T-bird for someone, and when the owner went to
register the car, he had to get a NOx device installed. I installed one
for him. Too bad that the inspection station didn't want to recognize
the Echlin NOx device that I had lying around. They ended up installing
a device that required cutting the upper radiator hose to install. After
all the registration work was completed, I returned the car to original
condition. Was inquired about that NOx device the last time I had to
deal with smog check on my '70 Ford Ranchero. Fortunately, now with the
exemption of 25 and older year vehicles in CA for bi-annual smog checks,
the NOx issue is a moot point. A few years ago, this was not the case.

Never had to get a car smogged when those stupid NOx devices had to be
installed. Somehow I avoided all that mess. All they do is not
allow the vacuum to the dist. until the temp is up. I'd see about
pulling it when the radiator hose needs to be replaced and put the
vacuum line back to stock. I've seen one on a car but didn't say
anything to the owner of the car tho. The PCV valve is still required
but that just gets rid of the drafttube which is really illegal here
in CA.
