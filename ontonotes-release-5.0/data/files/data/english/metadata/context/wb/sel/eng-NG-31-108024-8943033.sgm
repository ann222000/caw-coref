That looks really good, Jeff.  But I guess it would be folly to try it with my
scale which weighs to a precision of only 1/4 ounce.

I wonder why everybody calls their bread &quot;Poilane&quot; or &quot;Poilane style&quot;
while it has nothing to do with Poilane's bread.
Poilane bread= flour t80, sea salt, water, ferment from last dough.

Dick,

Eh. I'm sure it wouldn't make that big of a difference, so long as you
adjust for the feel of the dough. Mine was a bit tacky, but not sticky at
all. If I had a scale like yours, I'd try this:

Day 1, 9:30pm 16.75 ounces Water + 4.25 ounces starter + 8.25 ounces coarse
whole wheat, ferment at 69F.

Day 2, 7:30am add 2.25 ounces coarse rye, 9 ounces KA AP flour, 6 ounces
wholespelt flour, 1 tbs + 1/4 tsp salt.

Knead fully, then refrigerate 24 hours. Then, form boule, ferment at 69F for
5 hours.

Slash, then bake at 490F for 35 minutes, the first 15 minutes with steam...

And like I said in my write-up, though I used steam and a stone, I'm sure a
cold start on a baking sheet would produce fine bread. Spelt flour is
expensive stuff, though. I enjoy making bread with it, so I swallow my shock
every time I buy a bag of spelt berries, but if you go out looking for whole
spelt flour, expect a hefty price tag.

Actually, Kenneth, I'm curious as to the origin of this recipe. Did you
create it yourself or get it from some other source?

And, though I used an older version of your recipe in which you add all the
water on the first day (my machine ate all my email so I was relying on a
Google Groups search -- that was what came up), I see now that I've finally
found the most recent post that you added half the water on Day one and the
other half on Day two. Does it make much of a difference?

Hi Jeff,

I had tried for many years (mostly following variants of the
frequently published 100% whole wheat recipes) but none of
my results came close to the real thing. Then, I gave up,
until we had another trip to France.

That cycle continued until I read an interview with M.
Poilâne in which he mentioned, in passing, that he felt
partially responsible for the increase in spelt production
in France.

As soon as I read that, I moved in the direction you have
seen, and immediately, my results were quite similar to the
bread I had often had in Paris. With some tweaking, I got to
the point that I was very happy with the result.

The only reason I started to split the water was that I had
concerns about the proper fermentation of the very soupy
whole wheat early stage. It was originally so wet that it
separated, and I wanted to try it more &quot;mush&quot;-like.

All the best,
--
Kenneth

The loaf was a reddish-gold color. The photo is more red than the loaf was,

Maybe so, but truly, my gas oven was very well ventilated. Whatever water
vapor the gas oven produced on its own disappeared before it made itself

Yes. I agree. And will likely follow his teachings in the future.

OK.

Just for reference, Poilane is more gray-brown, and the crumb is
opalescent in a way.

It's also not so fine-grained.  It's not &quot;open,&quot; mind, you with holes,
but the texture seems a bit coarser than the picture.

&gt; Graham
">

This is basically how they make their bread at Poilane:

Take old dough(from previous mix), make a preferment with it adding
flour and water to it (100 flour, 40 old dough, about 60water) making
it a tight dough.
Leave it for about an hour to proove.
Then mix the main dough, using:
100 flour T80 (a fine wholemeal. If no T80 available, I guess you can
just sieve wholemeal flour)
2 coarse sea salt
30 preferment

Enough water to make a nice dough, not too tight.

Mix for 7mn first speed, put in a wooden box for prooving, about and
hour and half. Scale your dough 2.2Kg, round up, put in a banneton
with lots of flour. proove these for about an hour, or however long it
will take. 15 mn before they are ready to proove, put lots of wood on
your oven, leave the flame warm up the oven for 10mn, then put water
for steam and start loading your oven, slashing the top with a nice P.
Bake for about an hour. When taking out the bottom of bread should be
almost black.
Of course that's if you have a wood oven like them :p

They don't actually weight the flour like I said there, instead they
weigh the water and have the matching amounts of preferement and salt
to the water weigh, after they just add the flour until the dough is
good. But I recalculated it for the flour weigh because I think it's
easier.

This is what I learnt when I went for a trial at Poilane's
I know it is pretty disapointing, all these dreams of long
fermentation, and technology of baking, there's nothing like that
there. I'm not saying their bread is not good, it's really good bread,
but it's far from being the best. That's why it makes me laugh when I
see people exchanging Poilane recipes and Poilane starters on the
internet ;)

Keep up the good work anyway!

Well, it is 60% wholemeal -- I wouldn't know where to get high-extraction
flour where I live. It was a tasty loaf, and I'm sure I'll be making it
again, authentic Poilane or no. One of these days when I make good on that
promise to take my wife to France, Poilane will be a stop on the tour, no
doubt, and I'll have an opportunity to sample the real deal.

Or... you could get some hulled barley. Remarkably similar. Has a

Very interesting. Reminds me of Hamelman's book. He does a lot with
pre-ferment stages. And it suggests that the starter is never
refrigerated... :-)

What we do not know is whether or not the flour supplied to the
Poilane bakers is already blended. I assume Poilane has custom flour
so I would not discount the spelt component.

Whole Foods doesn't sell the stuff, so far as I know. They couldn't even get
me hard spring wheat berries.

You'd have to get over to Debra's Natural Gourmet in Concord if you want
spelt. It's about $1 a pound if you want organic, less if you don't. Or at
least it was before our corn-mandated fuel bill kicked in and sent wheat
prices into the stratosphere. It fit in the trunk of my '97 Saturn SL1 just
fine -- no SUV required. It's even easier here in Oregon. I can bike 1.5

Indeed it does. Specifically:

&quot;Together with this, the Poilâne Company has encouraged growing spelt.
This type of wheat has very good qualities for making bread, but it
had almost completely disappeared since the beginning of the 19th
century. Its grains are covered with straw husks that entail the use
of a sheller prior to milling. Today, Poilâne flour contains about 30%
of spelt.&quot;

If you look at the bread ingredients what you see is T80 wheat flour,
water and salt... no mention of spelt. But I suppose it's consistent
if you consider spelt a variety of wheat.

Yep they get their own flour from the miller (lots of bakeries get
that in France) and it's not impossible that they have a blend of
different varieties, including spelt.
But T80 is just a wholemeal with not so much bran in it. I'm sure
anybody can make T80 style flour by just sieving wholemeal flour.
After you have to find something to do with the left over bran, give
it to the wife for her healthy breakfast maybe :p
I read that bakeries long time ago were sieving their flour themselves
to get to get a finer, whiter flour. It's only recently that millers
started doing this. So I don't see why home bakers can't do it
themselves ;)

I really like T80 flour as it contains most of the goodness of the
grain, but is not too hard to digest.

Howdy,

It is nice to hear that it makes you laugh, but your
comments above include the very reason for the behavior that
amuses you.

It is certainly true that commercial bakers often have
access to tools and techniques that home bakers lack.

But (particularly with regard to technique) home bakers
often have resources that commercial bakers do not, or at
least, would prefer not, to use. Very long fermentation is
probably the most obvious of those. If commercial bakers do
it, their costs soar. For home bakers, there is no such
cost.

As you have said, the Poilâne loaf is &quot;far from being the
best.&quot;

That would seem to leave some room for improvement. How
better to do that than by experimenting with different
approaches?

And regarding the starter:

Though they no longer do it, years ago, folks at the Poilâne
bakery were happy to offer home-baker customers a pinch of
their levain.

It certainly makes sense to me that it would be shared with
others interested in having it.

All the best,
--

Hi Jeff,

With regret, I can't post the taste &lt;g&gt;, but that is the
answer.

Also, I have stored the Poilâne and ACME side-by-side in my
refrigerator for many years.

Often I have thought, &quot;After all this time, surely they have
become the same.&quot;

But then, I do a very simple test:

Again, side-by-side I mix up a few grams of each with equal
amounts of flour and water. Then, I put the mixtures in
identical graduates to watch 'em rise.

After a few hours, the ACME is about twice as &quot;tall.&quot;

All the best,

Hmmm..given that the numbers above total 332, that would be a rather
small loaf.  Considering that the Poilane miche is supposed to be two
kilograms, I'd have to guess the numbers would be bakers percentages.
It is also interesting that there is neither yeast nor water in the
final dough.  Old dough is usually a yeasted process, and the yeast has
to come from somewhere!  Also, there isn't enough water in the
pre-ferment to adequately hydrate the dough.

Let's assume we are shooting for 80% hydration, which is reasonable for
a whole wheat bread.  (also, if you grind your own wheat with a
micronizer mill, sifting probably won't help - the particles are too
uniform to sift well.)  Instead of sifting the whole wheat flour, one
could also dilute it with some all-purpose or bread flour.  All-purpose
is probably closer to a classic French flour, so mixing about 80% whole
wheat and 20% all-purpose would be close enough.  Since some of the
water will come from the preferment, I'll drop the amount of water to
about 76%.  It's close enough for bread making.

Finally, the yeast.  How much to use?  I'd guess is about .3% instant
yeast, again, as a bakers percentage.

To make a two kilogram loaf with that recipe, try:

Preferment:
144    grams Flour
58   grams Old Dough
86   grams Water

Final dough:
960    grams Flour
19    grams Salt
730    grams Water
288    grams Preferment
3    grams Instant Yeast

If anyone tries it, I'd appreciate hearing how it turned out.  I'm not
sure when I'll be able to try it.

A few more interesting observations..... Bernard Clayton has a recipe
that was approved by Pierre Poilane, the father of Lionel, that was a
straight dough - no sourdough, no old dough, no poolish.  Also no spelt,
and little whole wheat.  If you go to their web site, they tell you they
use 30% spelt (it isn't clear if that is a bakers percentage or a more
conventional percentage) and a sourdough process.  It seems that there
are a number of hints about the Poilane formula, and that they are all
different.

Yes obviously.
100 flour
65 water
2 salt
30 preferment
The water content depends on your dough, it could be 64 as it could be
68 at the end. This is something you need to adjust while you're
working your dough.

For poilane size loaf:

Preferment
170 flour
68 Old dough
102 water

Dough
1120 flour
730 water
22 salt
335 preferment

That's for 2.2Kg of dough, it should weigh about 1.9kg after baking.

Well the yeast comes from the old dough. and I'm talking sourdough
yeast. That's if you're making your &quot;Poilane&quot; loaf all the time. I was
describing how they make it in Poilane bakery. If you start it from
the begining you just use your starter instead of old dough to mix the
preferment. The point is that in Poilane they don't use a separate
starter, they use a piece of dough from the previous batch, meaning
there is salt on it.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

I said just after: Enough water to make a nice dough, not too tight.
That's probably about 65%. most artisan bakeries dont weigh the water
AND the flour, they just weigh one and adjust the other. In Poilane
they weigh the water in buckets and they add enough flour. In other
bakeries they weigh the flour which is allready in bags, so that makes
it easier.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

If you put 80% water for this bread you're gonna end up with a nice
soup, good luck.
Maybe your whole wheat absorbs that much water, but &quot;Poilane&quot; bread is
not whole wheat. It's made with T80 flour. And there's a big
difference.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

If you have a preferment I don't see why you need to add yeast. unless
you're on a hurry and you want to bang your loaf in an hour.

I just said what was the &quot;Poilane formula&quot; in the previous posts and
you changed it to make your own. That's probably the problem with you
guys you just want to make everything more complicated than it really
is. Bread is bread, it's just flour water and salt. There is no big
secret, anybody can do it. If I had a 6yr old kid at hand, I sure
could teach him how to make a great loaf of bread :p

I'm not just trying to be nasty but sometimes you guys are just
pulling your hair too much. No offence for Poilane either, he's a
great baker and I read Lionel Poilane's book which is really good. But
you don't need anybody's approval to make good bread, there are loads
of people making much better bread than Poilane.

Cheers!

I have been a hobbyist baker for over 30 years, and a professional for

You're right, I didn't accommodate loss in baking, the loaf should have

accommodate saving more dough for the next batch.  My bad.

Most of the time when people in this newsgroup are making things too
hard for themselves, it is because they are trying to figure out hastily
written instructions.

I've been in a number of artisan bakeries, and have been trained by some
excellent bakers.  In all cases I am familiar with, they weigh ALL
ingredients, liquid and solid.  And then they adjust the dough as
needed.  Most bakers I know prefer to adjust the water as that doesn't
change the rest of the bakers percentages.

In the end, there are a lot of ways to make good bread,

What can I say, I'm sorry I'm not a book writter. I'm not going around
saying I know how to make the best bread. I just see people talking
about &quot;Poilane&quot; bread so I though some of you guys might be interested
to know how Poilane make their bread. The instructions I gave are not
inspiring because that's the way they make their bread.
I'm sorry to hear nobody's interested in the formula. It's probably
because there's nothing special about this formula. Which brings to
the point of my first post: There's nothing special about Poilane's
bread, expect the wood oven and the name.

Very good for you. I've been a &quot;&quot;professional&quot;&quot; baker for 3 years and
a hobbyist for over 2.
The first time I saw the term &quot;old dough&quot; applied to sourdough is when
I went for a trial to Poilane's bakery.
I don't know who makes the regulations for names of fermented things.
I guess if the old dough you use is sourdough, well you're making
sourdough bread.
I'm not inventing anything, I'm just saying things how they are. If
you take a piece of dough from a previous mix and make a new dough,
well you're making bread. I'm sure that's how bakers have been doing
their bread for ages, and you don't need to add commercial yeast in
any stage. Commercial yeast being a relatively recent invention I
wonder how bakers were using old dough in a yeasted process. Once
again, who makes those rules?

&gt; ingredients, liquid and solid.  And then they adjust the dough as
&gt; needed.  Most bakers I know prefer to adjust the water as that doesn't
&gt; change the rest of the bakers percentages.
">

That's true as well. I weigh all the ingredients myself too. I
shouldn't have said &quot;most&quot; bakeries because that's probably not the
case. But I'm sure many do as I've already seen a few. When people
have been making the same bread for years, I guess they're not
bothered any more to waste time weighing stuff, and since flour comes
in weighed bags, it makes it easier to put one bag of flour, a few
jugs of starter and a few handfuls of salt.
Once again I'm just bringing some input about Poilane because
everybody seems so interested.
They only weigh the salt in their bread. then they put how much water
they need using a graduated bucket, and then add flour until the
consistency is right.
I'm not saying that's the best way. I actually don't think it's a good
way.

There again I think anybody really interested in bread making should
learn how to assess the consistency of the bread.
Percentages of water and flour can be really different depending on
many things and don't always mean much. Following a recipe to the
letter doesn't always do good.
I think recipes are good for pastry stuff, cake stuff, and other fancy
thingies. but when making bread, you have to feel the dough and then
see.

It's very rare that I mix one batch of bread and never add water or
flour, there's always a need for adjustment. But there I'm sure you'll
agree.

That is very true. And I just think people sometimes are trying so
hard to find complicated ways to make their bread, while it can be so
simple. But that's just my feeling ;)

&gt; &gt; guys you just want to make everything more complicated than it really
&gt; &gt; is. Bread is bread, it's just flour water and salt. There is no big
&gt; &gt; secret, anybody can do it.

&gt; &gt; But
&gt; &gt; you don't need anybody's approval to make good bread, there are loads
&gt; &gt; of people making much better bread than Poilane.

&gt; Question for you:  if bread is just water, flour and salt what factors
&gt; do you think allow some people to make much better bread than Poilane?

&gt; The question I have is what are the most important factors that would
&gt; contribute to a distinctive bread profile in your experience/opinion.

Good question.
I personally think the most important factors when making bread are
baking and fermentation.
Other important factors such as mixing, shaping, handling, slashing,
etc also contribute to the quality. But I think the baking makes the
biggest difference.

What allows people to make much better bread than Poilane is the
fermentation. For the baking good luck because the way they bake their
bread is very close to being the best. (The best I think is baking in
a black oven)

All this is just my opinion, I would love to discuss this with people
having different opinion, but we might have to start a new topic!

That makes sense if Poilane is some kind of matzo cracker.

Black ovens are the easiest to clean because you don't see the dirt.

Me, too, but I am still trying to figure out about the WMDs and other
similar issues.  Well, the photo links are pretty easy to understand.  But
the written parts, except about the black oven, are hard to understand.

How about grain type? Wheat, spelt, kamut, rye and then flour type/ash

I mean, what kind of question is this - most important factors? Once you
isolated them and know it all, what do you do?
Turn the knobs on the more important factors first or more - for what
purpose?

Or is this a philosophical question?

I'd say, the most important factor on bread is the baker - without
baker, no bread - period!

They use very big gueulard wood oven (this one with the fire box
underneath and the flame going in the oven chamber)
Their oven can fit more than 60 loaves which is really huge, the oven
peel is reaal long.
When I talking about baking I'm talking about what oven you use, but
also how good you bake it.

I don't know what WMD means.

That's true, I think that goes without saying.
When I'm saying which factor influences the most the quality of the
bread, I'm talking about the factor, not the details.
When I say baking, I'm saying it depends on how good the bread is
baked, meaning the baker baking the bread does it good, at the right
temperature and timing and in a good oven well managed.
Same for all that is mixing shaping slashing etc, it all depends on
the baker, how good he does it.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Absolutely - it's always good to strive for perfection but who is the

Well I AM of course.
for my own taste :p
Of course I had this conversation with my girlfriend many times
because everytime I bring bread back home she tells me its burnt.
Perfect bread is for everybody to judge and I'm just giving my
opinion.
But still, it doesnt change which factors influence the quality of the
bread, I think the baking has a great importance, maybe for one person
the baking is important to have a thin crispy crust, for another
person you need a very thick dark crust. It's different taste, but
it's still the baking that influences it.

To make an order I'd say personally:

1. baker skills
2. Fermentation
3. Baking
4. Ingredients maybe

I just changed my mind, fermentation goes before baking. I think they
are the 2 that influence the taste of bread the most.

After we probably must make difference between the taste of bread and
the overall quality, esthetics and all.

Or maybe we just wasting time talking here.
flour and water, bang, you have bread.

Actually, it would be bickering, name calling and refusing to be civil

But they don't take provocation very well.

I think it was Peter Reinhart who once said that that the baking only
contributes about 10% of the final quality of the bread.  I'm not sure
how you quantify that, but it's probably close to right.  However,
baking can detract a whole lot more than that 10% if it isn't done right.

My own feeling is that what is most important in any given loaf of bread
is what wasn't done right.  A great baker, a great oven, a great mixer,
excellent fermentation, great shaping and great baking.... but the flour
was seriously sub-par.  You're gonna get an OK loaf of bread at best.

A great loaf of bread is like a symphony where all the players are
playing their parts with distinction.  The triangle player being off
time can make a symphony a disaster or a joke.  A violinist who isn't
quite there can bring tears to your eyes.  And so on.

True, you can spend so much time making beautiful perfect bread but if
you burn it or overproof it or whatever, that's it, gone.
I personally think the baking is much more than 10%. That's where you
get the crust, and a good crust makes a big different for the taste
and even keeping of the bread.

I don't know what sub-par means. But if I want to make bread at home,
I won't buy the most expensive or I dunno what gluten content flour. I
go to lidl and by the cheapest all purpose flour. And the bread is
very good. (well for me:p)
