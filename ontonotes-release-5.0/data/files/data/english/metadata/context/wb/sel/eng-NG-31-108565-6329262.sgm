Does anyone have any experience or references to the above practice and
whether it has been applied in the UK.

Hi Nick,

on the whole I can't answer your question, but I did find one quick
reference to polyurethane foam backfill for mineshafts from the US
National Park Service:

http://www2.nature.nps.gov/geology/aml/amlreports/puf.pdf ,

which may or may not be particularly helpful...

Regards

Thanks, this has a potential for a lot of use in out of the way
mineshafts where traffic isn't a problem.

Looking at several sites in Cumbria (iron ore shafts) so anything else
anyone comes across would be useful.

&gt; You probably already know this, but in Cornwall most of the old shafts
&gt; (and there are many thousands, most of them well over a century old)
&gt; are either capped with a concrete cap or a deep plug AIUI. Bats
&gt; frequently use old shafts as roosts. If the shaft has been taken over
&gt; by bats, then it's walled and some form of grating fitted over to
&gt; allow access for the bats. I believe it's illegal to destroy or
&gt; otherwise interfere with bat roosts, as bats are a protected species
&gt; in the UK. Something to bear in mind if you're thinking of filling
&gt; them with foam, or anything else for that matter.

The shafts we are dealing with in the short term have already been
grouted, but one has failed.  Others have been backfilled with refuse
and all sorts of other material.

Knowing a number of people into mine exploration, the concept of
"mineshafts where traffic isn't a problem" doesn't quite work. As soon
as a shaft is found where traffic isn't a problem (i.e. a newly
re-discovered mine), then traffic will become a problem with mine
explorers. And the occasional caver out for a bit of something
different.
From the point of view of sealing up commercially operating
mines at the end of operations, I don't quite see the point either.
Most of the threat of subsidence these days comes from lost mines, not
modern near-surface workings (a non-existent category?). Most tunnels
you can back-fill with spoil while you're running your mine down, and
you leave the last set of roof props in place made of wood, which will
rot and collapse over a few centuries, leading to a gradual diminution
of the problem.
So, what's the point of using fairly toxic chemicals in quite
large quantities to fill up holes in the ground which aren't much of a
problem? Gas build up (otherwise known as a CBM opportunity)?
Preventing public liability to snotty-nosed little scrotes (you
collapse the first mile or so of tunnel - you only have to make
"reasonable efforts" to protect the casual public).

Very definitely protected. Nine species native to the UK, IIRC.
And there are plenty of people that would be happy to grass you up if
they did hear of you blocking up a bat roost.

We are looking at a number of shafts which have been backfilled with a
timber cap at rockhead level and mine tailings placed to fill the upper
part of the shaft within drift deposits up to 30m deep.  The shafts
themselves extend to depths of several hundred metres.  The problem is
principally relating to shafts not mineworkings or adits. Several have
collapsed recently and are therefore a hazard to locals and farm animals
at least, as well as to walkers (these are on the boundary of the Lake
District National Park).

There are also shafts closer to villages and towns as well as some
within these villages and towns which therefore endanger property and
the local community.  The majority of these mines closed down during the
depression of the 1920's so the degree to which they have been capped is
uncertain.

Completely open shafts are not the principal concern either.

As to the gas problem this is generally CO2 with some CH4 from the
backfill material where household refuse has been used.

Ah. "Deads". So named for what the do to people who walk under them,
after the timber has been rotting for a few centuries.
Or even a few decades.
For a vertical shaft, I'd be dubious of the stability and strength
of things like builder's foam over even one century, let alone several.
You're going to have to do at least some inspection and engineering of the
shaft walls to be sure of getting a grip that would last a century. Which
means you're likely to have to haul out at least some of the fill ... nope,
I don't see that working. There's a word in caving for when you're under a
roof that is supported by 2/10 of bugger-all. We call it "hanging death" ;
the etymology should be obvious. If you've got shaft cappings that are made
of timber covered with rubble, I think that you're onto a non-starter in
trying to stabilise the rubble without removing it. Well, you might be able
to drive a (concrete) beam through the rubble pile from the side and let it
settle onto the bedrock on either side (with sufficient clearance to allow
for collapse of the lining of the shaft over centuries). But the excavation
costs of that sort of job would be up in the same range as digging out the
rubble and timber bracing, then replacing the lot with a proper concrete
cap and soil/ spoil back-fill.

Got you. Like I said, easily solved with a few kilos of Dr Nobel's
Linctus.

East side or west side? I went down Florence @ Egremont when I was a
student, and we've been trying to gather enough people form the caving club
to get group rates for a return visit. Got a nice cluster of haematite on
quartz in my rock pile.
If it's west side, have you tried conning BNFL into thinking that
they can do hydrology studies from your mine shafts, (and then have to cap
the things themselves). Probably unlikely to work - they've already got
enough data from the 1990s drilling campaign to know that the site is
unsuitable for the waste repository they're going to build there. Drigg,
isn't it?

That sounds very west-side (of the Lakes).

Take a look in the letters page of Descent
( http://www.caving.uk.com/Resources/Pages/d_pages/descent.html ), the UK
caver's magazine. There are regular articles about troglodytes in the
Mendips who have similar problems with capping their newly excavated cave
shafts, and also find regular evidence of "t'owd man" to deal with too.
They've developed a number of well-practiced techniques for capping them,
or making the entrances safe. Rest assured - caves might be tight, but
cavers are tighter!
Oh, Derbyshire trogs have related problems. I think a stamp and a
letter to Descent could well get you access to a lot of hands-on, relevant
experience.
