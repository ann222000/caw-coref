We grow so soon so old and so late so smart....

I'm posting this on the slim chance that SWMBO and I are not the last
two people on earth to learn this....but I could be wrong.

Last week we watched as one of our employees stuck an unshucked ear of
fresh sweet corn wrapped in a paper towel into the office microwave,
nuked it for 3 minutes on &quot;high&quot;, took it out and proceeded to devour it.

My wife and I both go gaga for fresh sweet corn in season and probably
cook it at home least a couple of times a week this time of year.

We've had microwave ovens for over 40 years andd made popcorn in them
when our kids were young but neither of us ever thought to cook ears of
fresh sweet corn in them. As far as we can tell the microwaved corn
tastes just as good as corn boiled in fresh water.

Live and learn....And no corn boiling pots need be cleaned in our
kitchen any more!

Wow. Cool. I mean hot.

Of course it would work: microwaves work on the water in the kernels, and
they'd cook from the inside nicely. Since the cob has little water in it,
there wouldn't be much wasted heating. Only thing to watch for is that even
slight overcooking would start drying out the kernels a lot.

I'll have to try this. Thanks...

You are right!  You grow too soon old, and too late supposedly smart;
a pot that had boiling water in it to cook corn shouldn't require that
much cleaning.

Nope, I hadn't hEARd of it either, and we like corn a lot too.  But
our corn-cooking saucepan doesn't take much cleaning at all, and I've
got it down to a science...corn, salt, cover with cold water, put on
stove at High, wait until full rolling boil, drain and eat.  (Do not
leave in boiling water more than a minute!)

By &quot;unshucked&quot; do you mean without the covering, or with it?  By my
definition, when you take the covering off the ear of corn, you're
shucking it.  Seems corn cooked in its covering would do better than
naked corn, but it must be challenging to peel when it's so hot.

But the more important question is &quot;Yellow or white?&quot;

White corn is like white chocolate...looks like paper, smells like
paper, and...hey! tastes like paper, too!  Nothing's better than
almost-overripe yellow corn, the kind you can eat and leave a clean,
dry cob.

Nope, I said backwards..It was shucked....(The green stuff was gone...)

As far as pot cleaning goes, we use Farberware, and If I just rinse the
pot without a little scrubbing of the inside I can see gunk at the
waterline level after it's dry. I'm sure what's there wouldn't poison
us, but it bothers the Felix Ungar in me if I don't remove it.

I also bet we'll use less electricity running the microwave for three
minutes to cook two or three ears than we do when heating up all that
water in the pot on our electric stove, eh?

Yes, unshucked means to leave... all the ... leaves &amp; stuff on.
1.5 to 2.5 min/ear, no wet paper towel required. The ear has
quite a bit of moisture inside, and as it heats and vaporizes,
it'll cook the kernels. It is a bit warm when done, use a pot
holder and watch your fingers for steam when you first pull a
strip of shuck off. You'll also find that the &quot;hair&quot; comes off
much more easily No fuss, no muss, no bother. I can't remember
the last time I boiled sweet corn in a pot.

Since ear sizes and m/w power varies, I have a rule of thumb for
when it's done, pretty much regardless of the number of
ears/batch. Use the approximation above, and watch for
condensation to form on the m/w oven's glass door. It should
start to accumulate during the last minute or so of cooking. If
it doesn't, just add time. A few minutes of settling time doesn't
hurt, either. Pretty much fool-proof. HTH

I leave the husks on, cut off the ends and nuke it for just 60 seconds.
If the corn was picked that day there is probably nothing sweeter.

I haven't boiled a cob of corn for thirty years - shuck them and nuke
them is the only way I've ever done them since we got our first
microwave.

They are excellent on the BBQ as well, snip the tassel off and soak
them for about 20 minutes in cold water before they go on, shuck them
after they've cooked.

Microwaved corn on the cob is WONDERFUL! If you want to do two cobs,
rinse them under the tap to damp them down and then nuke them for five
minutes. They'll be blazing hot when they come out, but once you can
touch them boy are they good...

It works better if the corn is still in the husk when you nuke it -
that way it steams itself in the husk. Shuck it under running water so
you don't get burned. (or else leave it to sit for a minute...)

Around her we call microwaving corn on the cob &quot;Corn the way the farmers make
it&quot; - because that's who we learned it from. And microwaved corn should taste
better than boiled corn - because no flavor or nutrients have been leached
into the boiling water.

:&gt;They are excellent on the BBQ as well, snip the tassel off and soak
:&gt;them for about 20 minutes in cold water before they go on, shuck them
:&gt;after they've cooked.

There are two traditions for cooking corn on the outdoor grill - the one
described above ends up steaming the cob in the husk, and works nicely.

The other method is to shuck the corn, brush some oil on the ear, and put it
on the grill.  Turn regularly, you'll get some brown spots where the cob
touches the grill. Even distribution of browning and its done. This is
probably the most work-intensive method, but it can keep one of the kids out
of your hair for a while. Because of the grilling, there's a small amount of
caramelization of sugars, and this leads to a subtly different flavor.

The next question - once you have your cooked ear of corn, how do you season
it? Butter and salt? Olive oil and herbs? Jalapenos and Salsa? or my favorite,
Old Bay?

The microwave is terrific for cooking vegetables of many sorts.  One of
my most-used kitchen implements is a Tupperware microwave steamer I
bought for a buck at a yard sale.  It's one of those things that often
gets used straight from the dish rack.  I never bother to boil or steam
veggies on the stove.

&gt; &gt; ear of fresh sweet corn wrapped in a paper towel into the office
&gt; &gt; microwave, nuked it for 3 minutes on &quot;high&quot;, took it out and
&gt; &gt; proceeded to devour it.

&gt; &gt; My wife and I both go gaga for fresh sweet corn in season and
&gt; &gt; probably cook it at home least a couple of times a week this time
&gt; &gt; of year.

&gt; &gt; We've had microwave ovens for over 40 years andd made popcorn in
&gt; &gt; them when our kids were young but neither of us ever thought to
&gt; &gt; cook ears of fresh sweet corn in them. As far as we can tell the
&gt; &gt; microwaved corn tastes just as good as corn boiled in fresh water.

&gt; &gt; Live and learn....And no corn boiling pots need be cleaned in our
&gt; &gt; kitchen any more!

&gt; &gt; Jeff

&gt; You _cook_ fresh sweet corn? ;)

&gt; &gt; We've done it that way, or else shucked, lightly rinsed, and
&gt; &gt; wrapped in saran wrap for years. Same for baked potatoes: dampen
&gt; &gt; the outsides, wrap in saran wrap, then bake in microwave for 6
&gt; &gt; minutes. Acorn squash: wash outside, poke hole into center with
&gt; &gt; an ice pick, bake in microwave until it whistles [about 8
&gt; &gt; minutes].

&gt; &gt; Charles

&gt; Nice pointer on the acorn squash!

Butter and salt.  I was raised in the midwest.

I'll slice and boil taters on the stove.  Just did that last night for
accompanying a batch of kielbasa and kraut.

Tried this, but didn't have an apple.  Still yummy.

Kielbasa and Kraut Recipe
http://recipes.epicurean.com/recipe/1867/kielbasa-and-kraut.html

Ingredients:
2 pkgs. (1 lb. each) sauerkraut OR: 1 can (1 lb. 11 oz.) sauerkraut
1 lg. onion, sliced
2 Tablespoons butter ,margarine or bacon drippings
1 lg. apple, pared, quartered ,cored and sliced
2 Tablespoons brown sugar
1/2 teaspon caraway seeds
1/2 teaspoon leaf marjoram, crumbled
1/2 cup dry white wine or water
1 kielbasa sausage (about 1 lb.)

I didn't bake it; I stovetopped it all in the pan I sauteed the onions
and meat in.  One-pan project except I separately boiled the spuds.
(See link for original directions.)  I used a can of well-drained and
rinsed Claussens.

I just butter it, with unsalted cultured butter, I don't use salt
much.  Paul's lime juice and chili sounds divine, though.

Nothing.  No butter, no salt, no nothing.  Just yellowy corn goodness.

There is no need to &quot;Cook&quot; the kernels. All you are doing when you
cook corn is getting &quot;heat&quot; into the kernels, they so not get softer
as you cook them.

An old farmer told me to put corn in boiling water for only 90
seconds. I use 2 minutes as my guide. He proceeded to take a fresh ear
of corn, shuck it, and told me to bite into it, and yes, it had the
same consistency as the cooked stuff.

The longer you cook it, the more of the sugars in the corn get
destroyed, so light cooking is the best.

So, cooking's just to make it hot enough to melt the butter?
