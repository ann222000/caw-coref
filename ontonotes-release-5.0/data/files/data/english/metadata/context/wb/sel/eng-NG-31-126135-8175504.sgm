Designing a universe where humanity spread across the galaxy and then
had a breakdown with each planet left on its own, I stumbled onto this
problem which is more complex than it looks.

Let's take ground combat on a terraformed Mars. Its 1/3G lets your
grunt triple current Earth loadout. While I assume lugging around HMGs
would still be problematic because of recoil (unless you posit some
kind of exoskeleton), hundred-pound personal lasers are in, and the
logistical implications are staggering. It also allows tanks to be
three times as heavy without sinking into the ground. I'm still at a
loss to plot all the changes in military science brought on by these
simple factors.

What are some of the other military implications of the different
gravity on Mars, or any other planet of your choice?

While heavy tanks wouldn't sink in the ground they still would need to
handle the forces coming with anything but going straigth forward.
Traction could pose a problem.
But airborne gunships would be more of an option.

Bombing raids wouldn't work that well, if you want armor penetration you
need an engine strapped to the warhead.

Jetpacks for infantry might be an option. :)

I wouldn't count on superstrength for the useage of heavy equipment for
long, muscle strength will adopt to the new environment.

Recoil from anything substantial is going to be more of a problem in
1/3g because ground friction is proportional to the weight. I suggest a
move towards rocket powered ammunition. Not just bazoozas and RPGs, but
also things closer to gyrojet machine guns.

1/3g solves the logistics dilemma that faces earthbound &quot;smart&quot; infantry
of deciding whether he should carry enough ammunition or enough
batteries.

I don't think lasers still make much sense as infantry weapons unless
you handwave a suitable portable power source.

I don't think that the mass of Earth tanks is limited by &quot;sinking into
the ground&quot; considerations. If it were, they could just make the tracks
wider. A more significant consideration is that a heavier tank would
move more slowly with the same engine.

Vehicles suffer from the problem of reduced ground friction. Even fairly
light military vehicles, such as the equivalent of Humvees, will need
tracks rather than wheels. Anything with reasonable speed will need to
be designed with aerodynamics that keep it on the ground (e.g.
spoilers).

In 1/3g, hovercraft start to look like they might be worth thinking
about for high speed military transport.

Simplistically true, but in practice, it's a bit more complicated.
Basically, you're confusing weight with mass.  IOW, while this
&quot;loadout&quot; may effectively *weigh* 1/3 what it would on Earth, it's
*mass* is still the same.

In short, if you try to handle a load of thrice a given mass in a 1/3G
field as you would said given mass in a 1G field, inertia will make
you her bitch.

I was always fond of the notion of null-g boxing as a sport.  Barnes'
&quot;Streetlethal&quot; series.  It had quite a few moves/techniques/whathaveyous
that simply made no sense in 1g.  Though...  interstingly, the
protagonist in the Streetlethal series once surprised a martial arts
master he ordinarily wouldn't have been able to touch by using a nullboxing
move (and nearly disolocating several of his limbs, iirc... or maybe he
just sprained his back).  NObody expects you to use nullboxing on earth.

And always remember, as the pace of hand-to-hand gets faster and more...
hrm...  &quot;vigorous&quot; let us say, the closer you get to having freefall
moves applicable.  Take for example Zahn's &quot;Cobra&quot;, where one of the
moves everybody's trained in is to use the ceiling to rebound from.
Dive at the ceiling, flip, rebound with your feet, attack somebody from
an unexpected direction.  Especially spectacular when used in a room
with a drop ceiling with those fuzzy acoustic tiles and a metal
framework; you have to aim at the true ceiling above.  Debris ensues,
but you still get behind your opponent in the blink of an eye.  Well...
presuming the real ceiling is strong enough...

You know the pace of a hand-to-hand encounter is quite rapid
if 1g gravity becomes merely a strategic consideration.

My point being... the gravity doesn't have to be different for the
implications to be different, it's just that different gravity makes the
implications occur at different paces of combat.

Don't think so. You'll be more clumsy for sure, and you'll particularily
notice if you try to do things like run fast around a corner, but at
earth, normally, weight is the main limiting factor on carrying heavy
gear. Easing that restriction will help even though at some point mass
becomes the new limiting factor.

I'm fairly sure at 1/3G, you could practically carry a backpack with 3
times the mass you could carry on earth. True, that backpack will now
have 3 times the inertia, so you'll have to spend energy handling that.
But on the other hand, the weigth of your body also went down by a
factor of 3, so:

Earth: 80kg soldier + 10kg gear + 20kg backpack. Total mass is 110Kg,
which determines the inertia you'll have to deal with. You need about
1100N to lift yourself, complete with equipment. Every step needs to
exert atleast this pressure.

1/3G: 80kg soldier, 10kg gear, 60kg backpack. Total mass is 150Kg, so
inertia is up by 35% compared to earth. But you now only need 500N of
force to lift yourself, complete with gear.

So, the fact that you have some extra inertia to deal with should be
more than compensated by the fact that figthing gravity costs you less
than half of what it did on earth, even with the triple-backpack.

Amazingly, although we have a lifetime of experience in Earth's
full gravity, and astronauts have months of experience in
weightlessness, practical experience in anything in between can
be measured in days, and that in at single level of 1/6 g in
either the confines of a cramped LEM cabin or while wearing a
pressure suit.

I would put 1/6 g as major adjustments.
Minor adjustments could be at just a small percentage below 1g,
say at the point where one more routinely catches dropped
breakables before they hit the floor.

The trajectory of shells would be different.  The velocity of shells would
be different.

I suspect that tanks would not be advisable anyway, if it costs less to loft
a shell in a high trajectory onto its top armour - top armour is usually
less thick than side armour.  It would instead make more sense to invest in
high-speed vehicles with enough of an active armour to give some
protection, together with a set of small and large recoilless rifles and
RPGs.

Assuming that terraforming means that most of the desert-ish surface is gone
and we have luverly Earth-style green grass; a fairly firm surface.

Reduced gravity is going to affect the traction.  Reduced gravity is going
to affect the &quot;time to react&quot; - someone trained on Earth with a reaction
time of a few seconds, is going to find himself hampered by the unexpected
stubbornness of materials and own body.

Above all else, aircraft are not going to be much of anything; beyond
pilotless spycraft and rocket-bearing UAVs - but even then, to carry as
much load as a military UAV would on Earth, it would need the wingspan of
jumbo, in spite of the lower gravity.  A thinner atmosphere is the reason
for that.

And, thinner atmosphere ... injuries and wounds.  How does blood react when
exposed to lower pressure air?  How would an injury be in lower gravity,
thinner atmosphere?  A bullet that in Earth's atmosphere and gravity,
breaks a shoulder-bone - how would that be different with lower gravity and
thinner atmosphere?  Would its energy be transferred hook-line-and-sinker
to the target and throw him several meters before dissipating?  Or would
the tissue be subject to explosive decompression?

Just some thoughts.

I'd assumed that terraforming would mean that the atmosphere had been
made breathable. The thinnest atmosphere that you could call terraformed
would be just oxygen at about 20% of normal atmospheric pressure. You
just need slightly bigger wings, and the reduced gravity allows fairly
normal flight. There'd be less drag, so you could fly faster lower for
the same thrust.

For combat in non-terraformed situations, the infantry would also need
to carry their own oxygen supply. That would pose severe limitations on
the time that the infantry could be unsupported. You'd might not want to
use diesel plus oxygen to power the vehicles either if you have to carry
the oxygen. If you did carry oxygen to burn the vehicle fuel, you'd
probably want to carry it in liquid form.

Some superstrength remains!

We do not know how humans adapt to lower g (the only experience is a
few days in 1/6 g) and we know how adults react to a few months of
zero g. Muscle strength adapts. So does the strength and balance of
circulatory systems. We know that somewhat similar adaptations in the
strength of muscles and circulatory systems occur in humans who spend
weeks lying level, even if there is no underlying diseasecausing them
to lie level. Basically, people who sre getting up after weeks of
lying in bed or after weeks in space are liable to have difficulties
with being upright and providing blood to brain. They adapt, but
meanwhile are seriously physically hampered.

It makes perfect sense that if soldiers travel weeks or months in zero-
g cruise conditions before landing on a planet, they are at a serious
physical disadvantage compared to the defenders who are adjusted to
the ambient gravity.

This is exactly wrong.  The problem with lobbing shells in a high
trajectory isn't cost--we lob shells at 45+ degree angles all the
time with mortars.  Assuming you fit the shell with terminal
guidance, the problem isn't even the difficulty with hitting the
target.

The problem with lobbing shells in a high trajectory is TIME.
It takes a really long time to wait for gravity to overcome the
upward momentum of a shell!  Consider a target that's 10km
away.  With a 1km/s round, you can shoot straight at the target
and the projectile will hit the target in about 10 seconds.
Or you could lob it almost straight up, where it will take
gravity over six minutes to return the round back to the
ground.  On Mars, it would take even longer!

In contrast, imagine fighting on a planet with ten times the
surface gravity of Earth.  In those circumstances, you could
lob a 1km/s round at a 45 degree angle, and it will hit the
target 10km away at a downward 45 degree angle in about
14 seconds.  This is only possible because gravity is so
strong.

to, makes all his lifelong reflexes his enemy.  He shoots high
without knowing it, is unsteady on feet, can't run properly---feet
slide out from under him.  Still worse, those troopers had to fight
downwards; they necessarily broke in at upper levels, then had to go
down ramps again and again, to try to capture a city.  And
earthworms don't know how to go down ramps.  Motion isn't running,
isn't walking, isn't flying--is more a controlled dance, with feet
barely touching and simply guiding balance.  A Loonie three-year-old
does it without thinking, comes skipping down in a guided fall, toes
touching every few meters.  But an earthworm new-chums it, finds
self &quot;walking on air&quot;--he struggles, rotates, loses control, winds
up at bottom, unhurt but angry.  But these troopers wound up dead;
was on ramps we got them.

I don't doubt it. But I don't see that it's got particularily much to do

That someone used to 1/6th G will move more efficiently in 1/6th G than

This makes no sense at all.

Any weapon that has enough energy to lob a shell at the side of a tank
has enough energy to lob the same shell at the top of the same tank. The
trajectory that gives the most distance-for-energy is 45 degrees upwards
if you ignore air-resistance.

Hitting someone who is moving on the top is however hard to do from a
distance, unless they sit still. It takes a long time for shells lobbed
straigth up to come back down, you'll have to guess where the enemy is
going to be in several minutes, which is nontrivial. This problem gets
*worse* on mars.

It is a demonstration of the importance to avoid conflating
weight and (inertial) mass.  Carrying more stuff makes it worser.
You can carry more gear because of weight.  You can lose control
of all that gear because of (inertial) mass.

I know that, and I made it quite clear in my post.

If figthing gravity *WAS* the only concern, then the hypothethical human
carrying 10+20kg on earth, and weighing 80kg is capable of figthing
aproximately 1100N of gravity, and could thus carry 250kg of equipment
in 1/3rd G. (that'd give the same 1100N gravity)

I didn't, however, claim that or anything close to it.

What I *did* say is that I think it quite likely that the added
complications of increasing inertia by 35% would be more than

aproximately half.

You think that struggling against 1100N of gravity, and handling the
inertia of 110Kg is significantly easier than struggling against only
500N of gravity while dealing with the inertia of 150Kgs.

We're talking 35% increase in inertia, combined with only *half* the
force needed to figth gravity. Inertia is a bitch, but it's a quite
modest increase. Gravity is a bitch too, getting that down to half is
worth something.

Right.  The maximum force you can apply vertically remains the same,
but the force you can apply horizontally falls with the local g.
So it becomes more and more like walking on ice.  Which costs more
and more effort and pre-planning.  And is slower, which can get
important in combat I would think.

The force you can apply horizontally is proportional to the weight (mass

The force you need for cornering is also proportional to the mass,
so you can't make any gains that way.  As you add mass for increased
friction, you also equally add inertia you are needing to overcome;
net result, no gain in cornering/manuverability/whatnot.

( Yes, I know, people sometimes weight their cars in winter; there are
reasons it can be effective; nevertheless, to a first approximation
it is true, so it's never going to be all that much of a workaround. )

Indeed.  Or gripy rubber soles.  Just as you would do on slick surfaces,

This is true. Walking in 1/3rd G have quite a few problems in common
with walking on a surface with only 1/3rd the friction.

That's still, in most cases, not going to be a problem though. For
example, many types of terrain are 3 times as slippery when wet, and
it's not as if we're unable to walk on them when wet.

But it'd be a problem in conditions that are tricky on earth. Walking on
ice is tricky on earth, walking on ice with only 1/3rd the friction, but
the same inertia to overcome would be even more tricky. It'd help
sligthly that the lower gravity would mean you don't fall over quite as
quickly or quite as hard, in other words you've got more time to
corrrect an imbalance before it leads to a fall, and if you *do* fall
the impact ain't as bas as on earth.

I wasn't thinking of extremes like these though. In normal everyday
walking on streets or in terrain lack of friction is not a major
impediment, and wouldn't be even if the friction was 1/3rd.

However, lack of friction means that an attempt to accelerate, whether
stop suddenly, start or duck sidewards, would be difficult.

Also, stability is decreased, which is not the case on slippery
ground. A horizontal push to a person standing on slippery ground
would cause sliding sidewards, not toppling. In low g, the stability
against toppling would decrease and people would tend to fall over
when they try to throw or shoot something.

Ah, I see.  But, the amount of lateral force before you start sliding
is also reduced, so that mitigates the effect...  I think.  However,
&quot;have to lean more&quot; is closely related to &quot;have to change the support

No. That is wrong. True, you topple easier, but you *also* slide easier.
The two are both reduced to exactly the same degree. The point at which
you need to push a given item to have it topple rather than slide is
related to the shape of the item, and the friction of whatever the item
is sitting on, (infinite friction and you'll always topple, zero
friction and you'll always slide, though you may slide *and* topple if G
is low enough) but completely unrelated to the local G.

You'll slide further though, because with the same starting-push, and
only 1/3rd the friction you'll slide 3 times as far.

Actually, carrying more mass will *help* against this. A 150Kg soldier
firing a weapon will have *less* of a tendency to slide or topple than a
100Kg soldier firing the same weapon.

But yeah, handling recoil will be harder in lower-G situations, so there
migth be a move to recoil-less weapons. This is quite unrelated to if
the backpack of the solider is 20Kg or 60Kg though.

Hm.  From another perspective, assume the coefficient of friction is
infinite, so the contacts are anchored against horizontal movement, but
are free to separate from the surface vertically (or, say there's a
small ridge preventing your foot from slipping horizontally).  Then, you
start to topple when the horizontal force that results from the offset
of your rear foot and your center of mass is exceeded.  For a given
geometry, if you pack on extra mass to get the same vertical force, you
get exactly the same horizontal force.  (Is it not so?)

Then there's also the issue that you need to supply enough energy to move
your center of mass upwards enough to place it above the support
point, ie, if the center of mass is displace distance &quot;h&quot; horizontaly,
and distance &quot;v&quot; vertially from the rear foot, you need to raise your
center of mass from hight &quot;v&quot; to &quot;sqrt(v^2+h^2)&quot;.  Note that again,
if you pack on enough mass so that you are supporting the same vertical
load, this requires the same amount of energy.

( All this is presuming how *fast* you end up moving horizontally after
you reach the tipping point is irrelevant; if you loaded on more
mass, then for a given dsiplacing force, you'd be moving slower.
If that matters, you might be better off. )

( Also all this is presuming you manage to keep your center of mass in
the same place when you are adding your extra load; if it's a backpack,
that may well not be the case, unless you are very careful.  And of
course if you add the extra load so as to *lower* your center of
mass, you are better off. )

This is distinct from inertial forces, such as &quot;how far do you have to
lean over to take a curve of a given radius at a given speed&quot;, since
in that case, if you load on more mass to increase the force holding you
&quot;down&quot;, you also increase the force pushing you &quot;sideways&quot; by the
same amount.

I understand you're saying that, but I'm saying you're grossly over-
simplifying -- the mechanical forces needed, and the way the human
body is and isn't capable of applying those forces isn't going to
provide anywhere near the magic compensation you're hoping for.

To put it to a crude example -- just because the larger leg muscles

their excess capacity can be routed to the musculature of the ankles.

True for a continously applied toppling-force, yes. Firing a weapon is
however likely to be better modeled as a instantaneous push. The push
itself is over almost at once, long before your center-of-mass has moved
beyond your support. So the question is, does your center of mass slow
down to a stop again *before* it moves past the limits of your support,
in which case you restabilise, or do you topple over.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

so?)

I'm not sure I understand what you're saying, it's possible I
misunderstand, but the answer is no if you're asking what I think you're
asking.

If your geometry is the same, having double mass means you'll be able to
handle twice as much of a push without toppling over. Assuming the
backpack does not change centre-of-mass (which may well be an unsound
assumption) a soldier with a heavy backpack may well remain standing
after having fired a weapon with recoil, even though without the
backpack he'd have toppled.

True. If your weigth is 1100N then standing up requires the same energy
regardless of that 1100N is 110Kg at 1G, or 330Kg at 1/3rd G.

But please note: I only claimed triple *backpack* would likely be
practical, not triple total mass. So it'd be 110Kg total mass at 1G
compared to 150Kg mass at 1/3rd G, which means standing up requires
about half the energy it does on earth.

Also note, for the distance your center of mass moves *before* you reach
the tipping-point, it actually *raises*, so correcting it requires no
energy whatsoever. Aslong as it stops before the toppling-point, you
will self-stabilise with no added energy required. (soldiers aren't
ridig objects, but if they where, consider the soldier pushed so that
his front-foot lifts a few centimetres from the ground, but not to the
toppling-point. The foot will fall back down by itself.)

Being slower is likely to help yes. It's probably easier to correct from
a slow topple than a fast one, even if stopping both topples require
precisely the same energy.

I still don't see any convincing arguments that carrying a 60Kg backpack
in 1/3rd G will be more impractical than carrying 20Kg in 1G.
Particularily not as most backpack-carrying is for movement-purposes and
not in active battle.

Sure, for some maneuvers it's beneficial to get rid of the backpack,
soldiers will do that on earth too.

Right.  Which I expect can be modeled as the deposition of enough energy
to raise the center of gravity out of the local minimum implied by the
width of the base.  That energy is force times the distance you have
to raise the center of gravity.  And if you load on extra mass to make

There's still the cornering issue (ie, the inertial forces from a course
change scale up with mass, and you've increased the mass, implying you
have to behave very differently taking curves).  Whether that's convincing
or not... dunno.

It may simply be a &quot;newbie&quot; issue, as in Heinlein's TMiaHM.  That is,
the problelm may be minimal if you have time to train your ingrained
reflexes to deal with the altered situation.

Yes it's so. I see the misunderstanding now.

You're saying a soldier in 1/3G would need to pack mass up to 3 times
his earth-mass to stand as stably as he does on earth. This is true, but
it doesn't contradict my statement, I'm saying:

If two soldiers are *both* figthing in 1/3G, the one with the 60Kg
backpack is *less* likely to topple after having fired a weapon than the
one with the 20Kg backpack.

This was supposed to be an argument in the &quot;Is 60Kg backpacks practical,
given 1/3rd G?&quot; question. My point was that for certain problems the
heavier backpack actually *helps*.

You can't change the local G (not easily anyway :-)), so if you're going
to figth on a 1/3G planet, that's what you have to deal with, it's a
given constant that you have no influence on.

You *can* however choose if you equip your infantry with 20Kgs of gear,
or 60Kgs. The latter has the advantage that they're simply better
equipped, and have less need of re-supplies. But it'd still be a loss if
it seriously limited their mobility or their ability to figth
effectively. I don't think it would, is what I'm saying.

No, not that he would *need* to.  It was just a hypoehtical.
And it's true that if they *didn't* do it, they'd topple easier.
I started out wondering whether that was so, based on the fact that
same-forces was posed hypothetically upthread of there.
