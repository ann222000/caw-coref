If you are not ana / mia how did you get onto this site. Was it just out
of curiosity? The first time heard about it was on the Oprah Winfrey
show, and for me it was just curiosity. /but when I went into the site
to see what it was all about I discovered that I had most of the ana/
mia signs and symptoms already. For example, I already had my own scrap
book on stick thin models to motivate me (thinspiration). I already
skipped most of my meals per day, or eating exactly a quarter of my food
and throwing the rest away. By then I already lost a lot of weight. So
basically I already had the eating disorder and the desire for it, long
before I knew such groups existed.

I also learned about these sites from television, like a 20/20 or Primetime or something that, of course, was warning parents not to let their daughters log on to proana sites.  I think shows like that just make the population of people with ed, or, as I was, on the brink, more committed to the disease.  I know that if I didn't have access to the internet, I would go through major withdrawls!~  I may not post every day, but hey, my life is not that exciting.  I do read what everyone else writes, and it is always helpful.  My finacee refers to this site as &quot;the girls&quot;  Like I'll head upstairs, and he says, &quot;you going up to check on the girls?&quot;  Funny huh???

I heard about those sites through the news and Oprah, stuff like that. There was also some newsletter from my son's school warning parents about those sites. I didn't know they existed before that!! I thought it was just me with a weird obsession. I like knowing there's others like me but I don't think it would've changed anything had I not found the sites. I love the Real Girls one, though, so cool!!!
I'm actually (wow, me hang out with someone!!!) going to be seeing my ana friend who's been hospitalized several times, sometimes funded by my brother (they date on &amp; off!), and its gonna be weird. She's supposed to teach me how to eat. Yeah, we'll see how that goes, ha ha!!

I also learned about these sites from television, like a 20/20 or Primetime or something that, of course, was warning parents not to let their daughters log on to proana sites.  I think shows like that just make the population of people with ed, or, as I was, on the brink, more committed to the disease.  I know that if I didn't have access to the internet, I would go through major withdrawls!~  I may not post every day, but hey, my life is not that exciting.  I do read what everyone else writes, and it is always helpful.  My finacee refers to this site as &quot;the girls&quot;  Like I'll head upstairs, and he says, &quot;you going up to check on the girls?&quot;  Funny huh???
