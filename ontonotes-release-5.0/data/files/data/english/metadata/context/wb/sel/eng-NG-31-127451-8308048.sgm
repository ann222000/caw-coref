The church is a body of believers (Eph. 1:23). Christ is the head (Eph.
1:22; Col. 1:18), the Holy Spirit is the power (Acts 1:8), and the Word
is its guide (Jn. 6:63).

The church is not founded on human frailty (Matt. 26:29-35). Christ
proclaimed, &quot;the gates of hell shall not prevail against&quot; His church
(Matt. 16:18). It can never fail.
Christ, the head of the church, has never been decapitated. As members
of the body of Christ, we are part of a living organism, not a
structured organization. Tyrants and wicked rulers have never been able
to extinguish the kingdom of God. Church fathers have continued
throughout history.

Christ seldom used the word church. Dozens of times he referred to the
kingdom of God. The true church is, &quot;Christ in me the hope of glory&quot;
(Col.1:27). What a blessing! Christ has come to tabernacle in his true
Saints, forming a church that can never be destroyed and never has,
therefore needs no &quot;restoration&quot;

Jesus declared in John 10:27, &quot;My sheep hear my voice&quot;. According to
Heb. 1:1, 2, Jesus now speaks to us directly through the Holy Spirit and
His Word. We can receive revelation from God on a daily basis to direct
all of our daily affairs. We do not need to be governed by a Bishop or
High Priest.

How is the church governed today

Jesus said the Holy Spirit &quot;shall teach you all things&quot; (Jn. 14:26). The
Word of God governs His children. Church leaders are not to judge the
hearts of others (Matt. 7:1). Authoritative controls and administrative
surveillance have no place in the kingdom of God.

There is …&quot;no condemnation to them which are in Christ&quot; (Rom. 8:1).
The Spirit of Christ brings love, not guilt or manipulation. &quot;There is
no fear in love, but perfect love casteth out fear&quot; (I Jn. 4:18). When
the Holy Spirit reveals the present day ministry of Christ to you, the
need for church controls will vanish.

What about current prophets and apostles?

Biblical prophets were seldom church presidents (Read Jn. 3:30, Acts
21:10,11).
A prophet submits in authority to an apostle (I Cor. 12:28 and Eph.
4:11). Many prophets held office at the same time (I Kings 18.4; Acts
11:27, 28; 13:1; 15:32; 21:10; Lk 2:36; 7:28). In the Old Testament,
kings not prophets established spiritual rulership.

Jesus came to establish the kingdom of God in men's hearts (Lk. 17:21).
Jesus can speak to us directly through the Holy Spirit (Heb. 1:1, 2; I
Jn. 2:27). All prophetic utterances must agree with God's revealed
scriptures (Isa. 8:20), the unchangeable word (Ps. 89:34).

We have everything we need in Christ Jesus

Jesus is: God incarnate in the flesh (Jn 1:1; Heb. 1:8; I Tim. 3:16;
Immanuel God with us, Matt 1:23), the tender Shepherd who cares for His
sheep and speaks to them (Jn. 10), the supplier of our every need (Phil.
4:19) and the greater One who lives within us (I Jn. 4:4).

JESUS HAS GIVEN US:

Redemption and Justification

We are washed clean by the precious blood of Jesus (through faith and
not works -Rom. 3:28 &amp; Gal. 2:16).

We are placed in right standing before the Father. &quot;For he hath made
him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the
righteousness of God in him&quot; (II Cor. 5:21).

We have Freedom from the curse of the law

If we fail to obey all the works of the law, we are &quot;under the curse&quot;
(Gal. 3:10). Christ was made a curse for us (Gal. 3:13) to free us from
the bondage of &quot;ordinances&quot; (Eph. 2:15 and Col. 2:20).

We have Freedom from swearing secret oaths

&quot;But above all things ...swear not...by any other oath...&quot; (James
5:12). Jesus revealed all of His doctrine and teachings openly: &quot;Jesus
answered him, I spake openly to the world; I ever taught in the
synagogue, and in the temple, whither the Jews always resort; and in
secret have I said nothing&quot; (Jn. 18:20).

The apostle Paul said, &quot;For I have not shunned to declare unto you all
the counsel of God&quot; (Acts 20:27). Swearing secret oaths and performing
secret hand shakes (Masonic rites) grieves the Holy Spirit. Jesus never
required or participated in secret temple ceremonies. The veil of the
temple was torn apart signifying Christ has come to tabernacle in
us. We don't need man-made temples. We are the temple of God (I Cor.
3:16 and 6:19).

In CHRIST we become new creations (II Cor. 5:17). A born-again believer
becomes a totally new person. &quot;For in him we live, and move, and have
our being&quot; (Acts 17:28)

John accepts the New Testament, as it was written, not as it is
falsely  'interpreted' by the mainstream christians.

It is also, not the final word of God, and therefore, no one should
base their eternal destiny, on its word only, since nowhere does it
proclaim to be complete, and all encompassing.

Well John, John Manning isn't that wrong
when he replies that you don't like the New Testament, as you obviously
scoff at it.
Tell me, since you and yours feel that the Bible wasn't correctly
translated correctly, why don't Mormons don't use Joseph Smith's
&quot;Inspired Version&quot;

Here it is online:

http://www.centerplace.org/hs/iv/default.htm

You know everything Joseph Smith ever translated was correct, such as
the Book of Abraham, the Kinderhook Plates and most certainly the BoM
even if it has been corrected over 3000 times.

Silly ole me, believing I'm going to heaven because Jesus died for me,
instead of D&amp;C 132, that says I have to practice polygamy to get there
or be damned.  (Read it again)

I heard it was because the utah mormons don't have the copy right to
the inspired version.  Emma Smith passed it down to her son.
