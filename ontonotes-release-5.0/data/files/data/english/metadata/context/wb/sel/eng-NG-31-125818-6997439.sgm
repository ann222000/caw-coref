Problem with connection between Linksys WRT54GS and Netgear WG111

The Linksys WRT54GS is currently working with my main PC [Windows XP
x64 edition] connected by ethernet and wirelessly with 2 notebooks
[both Windows XP] with no problems.
I am trying to get my standby PC [Windows 2000] and the Netgear WG111
to work with the network with so far no success.
The Local Area Connection Status shows,
Status: Connected
Duration: keeps ticking over OK
Speed: 54.0 Mbps
Driver version is 5.1213.6.327 date 27/03/2006
Device status: Working properly.
Components using the connection: Client for Microsoft Networks, QOS
Packet Schedular, File & Printer Sharing for Microsoft Networks, AEGIS
Protocol v3.4.5.0, Internet Protocol [TCP.IP]

The Netgear Wireless Assistant;
Shows my correct SSID, has selected WEP, and my correct key for key 1
entered manually, Network type has selected Access Point
The blue section has the correct network name, the correct channel
number, 54 Mbps and the signal strength shows 5 of the 8 "lights" as
yellow. Should there be numbers where there are 4 yellow dashes?

However Internet Explorer does not connect to any web site.

Any suggestions please as to what I need to be checking?

Have you got an IP address yet?  Open a command prompt and try the
following...

ipconfig /all

Does the resulting output show all the possible IP address/subnet/DNS
servers etc filled in to sensible values?

Try the following...

ping 207.46.197.32

Does this work?  This is one of the IP address for "microsoft.com".  If this
doesn't work, you're not fully connected to your router.

ping microsoft.com

If the IP address worked, but this doesn't, you're not resolving DNS names
(the step that matches a name to an IP address).  Need to check whether
you're using the correct DNS server (normally learnt using DHCP from most
routers).

If you're not fully connected to your router, are you perhaps using MAC
filtering or does Linxsys have some other card specific filtering?  You
should be using MAC filtering as it stops someone else logging onto your
system!

Good luck,
Paul DS.

It shows

Autoconfigeration Enabled - Yes
Autoconfigeration IP address 169.254.116.194
Subnet Mask - 255.255.0.0 [this is the same as the Linksys setup]
There are no entries for:
Default gateway
DNS Server

Did not work. "Destination host unreachable" reported

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Did not work
"Unknown host microsoft.com" reported

DHCP Server is enabled in the Linksys setup

The Wireless MAC Filter is Disabled in the Linksys setup

After doing the checks you suggested I went through the whole set up
process again from scratch.

It looks as though I had used the Router Password when asked for the
WEP Passphrase. I thought they were the same thing but in the process
noticed that the ones I had selected differed by a few digits.
Now working perfectly!!

Just shows what a wee bit of help & encouragement & a fresh mind in
the morning can do.

Now I will look at the MAC filtering thing that you have mentioned.

Thanks again for you help
