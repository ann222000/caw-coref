Why do stick-shift cars go backwards before going forward?

Sometimes I see a car in front of me stopped at the light.  When the
light turns green, the car in front of me will move backwards a few
inches before going forward.  I've never seen an automatic car do
that, so those cars must be manual.  Why do they do that?  They could
collide with you if you stopped less than a few inches from them.

Bad drivers.  In a manual tranny vehicle, there is NO connection between the
engine and drive wheels until the clutch is at least partially engaged.  To
prevent a manual tranny vehicle from rolling backward, you need to do one of
two things:
1)  Let out clutch pedal -fast- until clutch starts to engage, in order to
put forward pressure on the drive wheels before the car starts rolling
backward.  Doing this, the car might still roll back an inch or so, but
that's not a problem.
2)  (method used by inexperienced drivers).  Use hand brake/parking brake to
hold car until you feel clutch start to engage

If a manual tranny vehicle rolls backward more than an inch or so, that is a
poorly trained or careless driver.  (probably both)

By the way, automatic vehicles will roll backward also.  But that's less
common.  -Dave

Because the driver in front of you does not know how to drive a car
with a stickshift properly.  It's easy to make a smooth start on a
hill with no rollback if you practice a bit.  I've seen the same thing
on automatic transmisison equipped cars on steep hills.  Best idea is
to drive defensively and assume the idiot in front of you is just
learning to drive.  Give him a at least 3 feet of space and on a steep
hill give even more.

Both Studebaker and Subaru had a device to prevent this.
I wonder why no one else did.
A friend got a subaru unit from a junkyard and told his mechanic what
it was and how it worked and told him to put it in. The guy did and
the owner was happy. He had no idea how the mechanic did it, but it
can be done.

Maybe a non=factory connected Subaru shop could help

Y'know, I've driven Studes with the hill holder and if I actually owned
one I would disable the darned thing.  I have driven stickshifts so long
that I'm just used to them; the hill holder seems like it's fighting me
in tight maneuvering situations on a grade (i.e. I'm backing and filling
while facing downhill, and without the hill holder I could just leave
the car in reverse, but with the hill holder if I touch the brakes I
need to shift to first and let out the clutch to move forward)

I know, I just lost some credibility as a Stude owner :)

The handbrake does a fine job of stopping the car rolling back.

Same here and I have owned several cars with a _real_ handbrake.  Most
US cars (not sure of the foreigners any more) have a &quot;parking brake&quot;
that you stomp on with your foot.  I can see no way of using one of
them on a manual tranny to prevent rollback.  the same foot operating
the &quot;parking brake&quot; is also the one needed for the clutch.  Of course
it can be done by using the right foot to operate both brake and gas
at the same time.  If that is done, why bother with the &quot;parking
brake&quot; at all.

It's certainly the procedure taught in the UK (and the rest of Europe AFAIK). As you
come to a halt facing uphill you apply the hand brake. You can then select neutral and
your feet are free.

Even Vermont teaches that.

Do you hold the car on the footbrake ?

My vague memory of discussions with my father who owned and maintained
several studebakers some of which had the hill-holder feature was that
it was more hassle than it was worth.  And if not properly adjusted it
would wear out brakes quickly.

Said another way it was a solution looking for a problem to solve.
Said yet another way, a hill holder encourages drivers to become
somewhat lazy and not understand how to control their car.

I've owned and driven a lot of manual shift cars and never encountered
a situation where simply using the brake, clutch and gas pedal did not
work.

You're welcome.

No need to apologize for the asinine statement,
we will just accept that you don't know what you

Oh, and anyone who can't operate a clutch car
smoothly on a hill without resorting to the &quot;hand brake&quot;
is not an adequately trained driver, as you can see, the
engineers at Mercedes would agree. (you might look
inside one, if they ever make it to your backwoods area)

It doesn't have a foot operated brake.

&quot; Another welcome change is the end of the Mercedes-Benz patent shin-scraper –
also known as a foot-operated park brake. It's replaced by an electro-mechanical
push-button parking brake as already used by Audi, Jaguar and BMW. &quot;

My driver's ed was on a W123. Those have a pedal to engage the brake,

straight forward to use it in order to get the thing going in steep

And trust me, when the hill is 12%, and your car has the base diesel

Feels like quite an ugly way in an auto car. What prevents you from
sitting with the right foot on the brake, switching into D, releasing
the parking brake and keep it fixed with the foot brake?

Once you want to go, just let go off the foot brake and give it some
gas...

The engine won't overheat because of that.  The torque converter
doesn't put that much load on the engine at idle speeds.

I've never driven a Studebaker, but a Subaru I drive every now and then

What a bunch of jokers.  You'd swear that Aunt Judy stole a bunch of
nym's claiming all these techniques that sound workable but destroy
clutches.  I have not owned auto-tranny in 12 years.  Get to a red
light, shift to neutral, use the brake, just like in auto.  Light
turns green, hit 1st, ease the clutch in, no biggie. It's all in foot
timing.   No need to rev the engine either.

Besides, the last time I stayed stopped at a red light and had the
foot off the brake (using the clutch to keep the vehicle in place) I
was ass-ended (this was in St. Louis 5 years ago).  That's a tip you
don't f... up twice!

The last tranny that ever went bad on me was automatic.  The only
manual-shift part I have ever had to replace was the clutch cable, due
to high miles and age.

My first drive had manual tranny with 5 speeds plus a 2-speed axle.
Then again, it was a 2-ton flatbed truck on the farm when I was 12.

Oh...pardon the Aunt Judy reference...AJ has enough trouble with auto,
let alone manual.

Try a 1934 chev 1 1/2 ton.  That is what I learned to drive on, did it

&gt;&gt; It's certainly the procedure taught in the UK (and the rest of Europe
&gt;&gt; AFAIK). As you
&gt;&gt; come to a halt facing uphill you apply the hand brake. You can then
&gt;&gt; select neutral and
&gt;&gt; your feet are free.

&gt; Some stupid drivers never shift out of gear while waiting at a stop.
&gt; They leave the automatic transmission in &quot;D&quot; and keep the brake pedal
&gt; depressed.

Some? Frankly, I'd be very surprised to see *anyone* with an automatic
transmission put it in neutral or park at a stoplight. It isn't
generally taught, so people don't do it. Most just sit there in D with
their foot on the brake.

See any ford with the foot actuated parking brake. The parking brake
pedal is far over to the right and rather forward and high. It's very
close where one would find the T-handle in a mustang or a maverick from
the 60s/70s.

I would say there probably have been millions of cars with that sort of
design parking brake. (both MT and AT)
