I have a question for my fellow techs.  I had this HORRIBLE negative client last week.  OMG she was just awful.  That's nothing new, we've all had them, but here's what I'm wondering.  Why did it take me twice as long to finish her up? I would guess that if I had a vampire life sucking client I would get her in and out as quickly as possible, but I feel like I got sucked into this vortex that slowed everything down.  Has anyone else had this problem?

YES.

I have a client that is so snotty and picky, that I would rather run
5-10 minutes over on my time to get her freakin' absolutely perfect,
than incur the wrath that she might throw at me if there is one little
SPECK of not-perfectness :D  All my other clients I do (what I consider)
perfect in the right time frame, but this lady makes me so freaked out
for some reason, it takes me FOR EV ER.

If she doesn't calm down, I am firing her (she's fairly new).  I can't
deal with people like that.

I have a client like this - well, she used to be that way anyhow!!!  It would take me 1 1/2 hours to do a REGULAR fill, with polish.  It wasn't so much that I was taking longer, but she would not give me her hands until she went over each and every nail with me.  Pointing out what I consider normal "wear and tear".  She won't use her cuticle oil like she should, so she gets peeling from the undersides.  I live in the DRY DRY desert and so the oil is a must!!!  Finally, I just started taking her hand and would start working - she would try to pull it away to point out something and I just kept a firm hold!!!  LOL  And would say - I need to get working!

So one day she called and needed to move her appointment.  I had an hour I could put her in on the next day.  And she says to me "Oh, but that is only an hour, it takes you an hour and a half to do my nails".  And I said to her that yes, for some reason it does, but on all my other clients I have them in and out the door in one hour, including my pink and white clients.  From that day on - I have had her in and out in UNDER an hour!!!!  LOL

The funny thing about this client is I am the ONLY one who has ever done her nails!  Lord help her if she decides to go elsewhere!!!!  LOL

Not to mention the fact that this client of mine has nothing nice to say about anything, and every time she asks for advice, no matter what I say, she says no.  It's like she's just looking for ways to be ugly.  I hope she never comes back.  Not to mention the fact that she shared info w/ me that was WAAAAYYYY inappropriate.  Who do these people think we are?  GAH!!!!!!!!!

YES!!  I have TWO right now.  I do gel and they won't put their freaking
hands into the light until they've inspected everything - which makes the
gel run and then it's REALLY not perfect.  Drives me crazy!  And they come
in with a list of things that I need to 'correct' at their appointments.  I
want to ask them if they sit there and inspect the nails for two weeks and
they drive them crazy or if they're just torturing me for fun while they're
sitting there.  Actually I really want to just fire them but I haven't been
able to figure out how yet.  :P  But everyone else I can get done in an hour
or less but these... it's an hour and 15 or an hour and a half.  UGH.

We tell them that if we can't make them happy perhaps they should go some place else that can.  It's that simple.  We have one girl that comes back every 4 weeks and wants free nails because she waits so long for a fill they are terrible.

In the February Nailpro there's an article on Lifting the Green Ceiling and it talks about a "double station technique".  Does anyone use this?  How does it work exactly?  Does it really save time?  I think my clients might be upset if someone else was sitting there with them because they're so used to being one-on-one with me.  Plus all I can think is that I'm sick of doing nails by the end of the day - how the heck would I feel doing 2 people at once??  Good grief! LOL

I need details, please! :)

Rachel,

I would but the lady who owns the shop won't let us do anything like that.  We can't even charge for broken nails, because it is a family friendly, affordable salon...bla bla bla.  That's all she ever says.  So much for booth renting eh?

We tell them that if we can't make them happy perhaps they should go some place else that can.  It's that simple.  We have one girl that comes back every 4 weeks and wants free nails because she waits so long for a fill they are terrible.

Hi Michelle,
I find if I fell intimidate or not sure of that person, I take longer. It might be that you know they might be picky and you want to make sure that you do a good job. That's all I can think of.

I have a question for my fellow techs.  I had this HORRIBLE negative client last week.  OMG she was just awful.  That's nothing new, we've all had them, but here's what I'm wondering.  Why did it take me twice as long to finish her up? I would guess that if I had a vampire life sucking client I would get her in and out as quickly as possible, but I feel like I got sucked into this vortex that slowed everything down.  Has anyone else had this problem?

Today i had a horrable client as well!  She wanted a full set of pink and
whites. She ordered a salad and wine from our cafe and tried to eat it while
I worked.  Her bacon from the salad fell in my caddy where I keep all my
product. Then she needed a refill on her wine and would talk (with her feel
hand) to anyone that would make eye contact with her.  High maintance women.
Never again.

I have an L-shaped nail station that you could do that with but for the
last 4 yrs, the only time I use the "second" chair is to let someone
finish drying or soak off their acrylic while I'm working on another
client. That's all I will ever use it for. Other than that, its useless
to me....

Dawn McCormick, one of the techs in the article (I wrote Double Station
Technique) had the same concerns that have been mentioned here. She is very
careful to monitor who she asks to sit 'double,' and has not, since 1999, had  any
complaints on this technique nor lost anyone because of it.
In reality, nail techs seem to really 'know' their clients, their  likes and
dislikes when it comes to service.

It is not happening with every client - it is only with those who  like it,
and believe it or not, the majority of her clients do. They  book with their
friends, or like to meet new people. She is a gel nail tech and  finds this very
conducive to double station technique, though initially she also  did it with
acrylics-just took longer.

It has been a great boon to Dawn's business $$ wise, but in another  reality,
it is not for anyone who does nails 'to have fun,' or is not  willing to work
hard and efficiently. A double station tech works hard, though  it became so
automatic soon for her that she doesn't feel any stress  at all doing it.
She is a very efficient and talented nail tech, has been doing it  for 20+
years ('83?), and is serious about being professional. Her  studio (she works
alone by choice) is on the first floor of a house she  purchased/remodeled in
Columbus OH (in Victorian Village, for those who know  Columbus). She lives in

I'm still trying to figure this out.  I do have some clients (mothers/daughters, friends, etc) that it might work for and free up some spaces for more people.  I just can't figure out how it would save time.  Plus, it's not that I'm in this just for fun - obviously I want to make money!  And I'm working too darn hard now anyway so if this is more efficient that'd be great.  But I do know that for some of my clients they wouldn't talk and share as much in front of other people as they do one-on-one.  I do want to make more money but I don't want to lose people either.

So the way it's set up - would I have both people come in at once and then have two sets of everything?  File them all at once and then apply the gel all at once?  Does it only save time because you aren't losing time inbetween clients?  If it takes me 20 minutes to file during a rebase, then 20-25 minutes to apply gel, and 5 minutes to refine . . . it's going to take the same no matter what, isn't it?  What am I not seeing here?

Thanks!
Rachel

I use a double station setup (L Shaped).  It works great.  I started using
this type of setup over 10 years ago.  At first it started out as just a way
to have my client move to the next station for drying while I got my next
client started.  It was just a means to save a little bit of time.  Then I
started using it to "squeeze" in a repair or polish change here or there.
Eventually I started using it to double book manicures.  With the way I do
my manicures it works out great as I can do 2 manicures in the time it takes
to do 1.  My clients do not mind at all because when I'm with the second
client the first is in "down time" anyway.  I do not use this technique so
much with enhancement services but I specialize in natural nail care anyway
so I have more manicures and pedicures than I do enhancements anyway.  When
I had my salon in FL I also would book 2 pedi clients in the same slot.
This was way before the pedi thrones came about and I had two pedicure
stations (not the pedi thrones) set up side by side and it worked out
wonderfully.  (see my sig line).  This method has really helped me to
increase my income potential without sacrificing the quality of service.
It's also great if 2 friends want to book at the same time but don't want to
spend so long in the salon.   My clients do not feel like their time is
being shortened with me as generally speaking, the two clients and I have
conversations all together....it is a really great way for "socializing".
And quite honestly, I end up being able to work more efficiently because the
2 clients end up talking while I work instead of me having to help carry on
a conversation (hope that made sense LOL).

If anyone's interested I do have a picture of my station setup with 2 tables
on my website.

You will understand more with the next article, I hope.
Dawn sometimes staggers their entrance, like fifteen minutes later for the
entrance of one of them. It works out better for them, but friends come in
together anyhow, it seems, and just chat. Frankly, Dawn likes the aspect of them
talking to each other - she talks little, then, just puts her head down,
works  relaxed, and whizzes through the steps. She easily gets two gel clients
done in  an hour.

She has told me, however, that a lot of it has to do with the product. She
started into gels with Light Concept, and now uses Brissa (CND). She tried
others but they were just too step complex, or the builds were too sensitive.
She talked to someone yesterday who called her due to the article and one of the
first things she told her ( a tech who took 1 hour 15 minutes to do gels)
was  she would have to change her gel product-she was taking far too long and
wasting  valuable time.

I used my double station the same way, Melodie, as after about 10 years I
stopped doing enhancements due to the high demand in the salon for manicures and
back then, no one wanted to do them. They were low priced at first, so I HAD
to  do double to make money. (I doubled the price slowly within a year, and
still  was booked well.) And I found, as you, that they fit right into the
double  station technique, since I used mitts, etc.

You bring up a great point.  I had never experienced what it was like to get
my nails done in a salon I didn't work in.  When I did begin getting my
nails done elsewhere I was surprised to discover it is like a social
hour/play group for us.  I love going to get my nails done and what makes it
even more enjoyable is talking to everyone who will talk back.  Whereas
before, I would have been very concerned about having two at my table just
for their privacy concerns, etc, now I realize it most likely increases the
client's enjoyment of the service.  And, I probably wouldn't have heard the
more intimate details of their lives.some things we just don't need to know,
ya know.lol!

Janet and other double client  specialist,

I wanted to try doing the double station technique  with pedicures when I was
in school. Everyone thought I was insane, and it was  just impossible. They
threw everything they possibly could to detour me from  doing this. From
sanitation reasons to time consuming. By the time I pleaded my  case all the way to
the owner of the school, I was finally granted permission  days before
graduating. I was never able to try it, but I really thought it  would be great. I
know I would work faster, because when I have to talk, I tend  to stop working.
This would give them someone else to talk  to.

I am hoping to open my own salon soon, and then no one  can tell me it can't
be done!! haha. I believe if I start out doing clients like  this, and not
already use to a certain way, I will pick it up  quickly.

My question is, if any of you have a routine, can you  tell me what it is,
with step by step instructions? (mani &amp; other  services) ? Write it like you
would hand it out to students you were teaching?  Please oh please,  mighty nail
techs?

Thank you ladies,
Missy

Oh Yeah.....Makes me remember Peg.  She moved here from Nebraska.....and I, who am a very calm relaxed person...thought I might shoot her one day.  She was obsessive compulsive and negative negative negative,  What took an hour with every other client too at least 2 hours with her.  she sucked the life right out of me.  The day I finally got the nerve to tell her I just couldn't do her nails anymore, she came in and told me she had bad news.  She was moving back to Nebraska.  Hallelujah.   She couldnt understand why 4 husbands had litterly walked out on her.  I wanted to tell her she was lucky they hadn't murdered her in her sleep.
Somewhere in Nebraska there is a poor nailtech named Jane who got her old client back.  I wonder if Jane has shot her yet?

I have a question for my fellow techs.  I had this HORRIBLE negative client last week.  OMG she was just awful.  That's nothing new, we've all had them, but here's what I'm wondering.  Why did it take me twice as long to finish her up? I would guess that if I had a vampire life sucking client I would get her in and out as quickly as possible, but I feel like I got sucked into this vortex that slowed everything down.  Has anyone else had this problem?

LM@O!!!
That is the funniest thing I heard in a long time.
Those energy sucking clients are the worst. I have two. Could never figure out how I kept feeling $#!tty by the end of the day once a month. Finally figured out that I booked these two complainers back-to-back. So, I considered booking separate days, but changed my mind. Now all I do is block them out. Gives me the right to day dream.
The one, I swear, one day I am going to cut her with my nippers and the other one,well,if she does not stop wearing her cheap perfume, I am going to open a window on her in this freezing cold weather. Murder has not crept into my head.....yet...
thanks for the laugh!
buenos dias,

Lynnette, how funny.I can SO relate!  I had one lady, she was a little
picky, and very sold on herself.  Nothin she did was wrong but wow, what
everyone else did was wrong.  She was building a house that was high end for
our area and every two weeks complained to high heaven about it.  Then she
came in complaining that the sales people in her new home neighborhood were
ruining the neighborhood by selling to people of color.  I bit my tongue and
couldn't even look at her!  She kept saying:  "Now I am not prejudice but
they are ruining our neighborhood."  Gawd, save me!  I remember shaking and
telling her (I had been a Realtor in my early days) that 'those' people were
making damn good money and had to QUALIFY to even buy in HER neighborhood.
That I had friends that were THAT color!  She wouldn't hear it!

Finally, it was the day I was PMSing really bad, there was WAY too much on
my plate and she came in and I was running ten minutes late with a fill that
showed up with half nails that she bit and chewed on.

So, I was TEN minutes late getting to this crazy woman.  She complained
about my running SO late! I had enough! I stood up, with two other techs
watching, grabbed the first one's book and politely asked if she preferred
having M or S do her nails today?  She refused!  I said: Fine!  I turned and
apologized out loud to the tech for even thinking about booking this client
with her.  Then said as I walked out the door: the ONLY thing I am going to
do is go out to my car and get a XANAX!  Yep, it's 10am and I need a XANAX!
In fact, think I will take a WHOLE one today!! I don't care about your
nails!!  Ah, it felt so good!

I did come back and do her nails, slowly, and to her great irritation.as a
whole xanax knocked me off my butt.lol!  And she whined and I didn't hear a
word she said.  I was SO calm.lol!  Oh, the memories.

You are funny, too.
Okay, how about this one?
My area is being built up dramatically. When we moved here in the early  '80's, it was a small area. Will still be, but growing a lot.
I used to belong to a now defunct Main Street Merchants group. Two of the members went on and on about how the area is going down and "those" people from Philly are ruining the place. They never do "nothin." LOL... I let them go on and on for about ten minutes and when they were done told them that their attitude was keeping "those" Philly people from whatever it was they wanted. OH, to make it sweeter, I told them that I was born and raised in Philadelphia. Even better-- I am Spanish and Cuban. LM@O!!!
I have a client that does this too, one of the ones mentioned in the earlier post. I have also told her about my background.
All I have to say is AMAZING..... (rolling my eyes)
buenos dias from East Greenville PA,
Lynnette

Everyone has or has had clients like this. You have to politely but
firmly take control from the very beginning. Think about
it..."professionalism" is an attribute that nail professionals are
trying to get across to the general public these days...it is an issue
with many people in this business. When you are in the personal
service industry some people put you in a certain category, and
"professional" is not it. However, nail professionals ARE
"professionals". Some people in our business don't even want to be
called "nail techs", they want to be called "nail
professionals"....that is how big of an issue this is...but you have
to act  professionally and not tolerate a client treating you like you
are NOT a "professional".

For instance...would you go to the dentist and interupt  him during
the procedure to check out what he is doing and see if you "like" how
he is filling your cavity so far? Of course not. Why? Because you
recognize him as a professional who knows what he is doing and you
leave him alone to do it.  A nail professional should expect the same
thing.

YOu can be gentle about it, but you must be firm. If a customer sits
down for the first time in  your chair....and she wants to point out
whatever is bothering her or whatever she wants to point out...fine.
The first time.  You don't need her to tell you waht is wrong with her
nails, as you as the professional will know once YOU look at them. You
only need her input as to how she wants them to look when the
procedure is finished...shape, length, etc. Otherwise, you don't need
her input.

You should listen to her, and then say okay and go to work. If she
starts to pull her hand away to check out each step....nicely,
politely tell her to give you her hand back and let you go to work.
Tell her she can tell you everything that is wrong when you are done,
or at a point where YOU want her input.

You must be firm and mean what you say. She is wasting your time, and
that means she is taking money right out of your pocket. Just do not
tolerate unnecessary interuptions so she can keep checking on you. If
she keeps it up...put your file down, to get her attention, and say
something like, lets make a deal. You let me go to work uninterupted,
and if anything is wrong when I am done...I will fix it. You must
speak firmly to her and tell her you can not work this way, and that
you are a professional doing nails x amount of  years, and that's
that.

I even, on more than one occasion, have told customers..."you know, my
grandmother used to say 'never show a fool a job half done'". That may
sound harsh, but you may have never had some of the clients I ran
across. I said it with a smile, but they "got it". I don't recommend
that saying but I am just telling you my experience.

One caveat....if you take that attitude you must have the confidence
and the skill to back it up. If you are confident you ARE a
professional and your work DOES hold up to scrutiny...then you must
insist on the same respect any other professional will command.

had people

We were
