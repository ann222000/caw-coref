William Weil submitted this review for the new Stern Grove dog park,
enjoy ;-)

First impressions of the remodeled Stern Grove Dog
Park, especially for FUDDP.

I noticed a drop off at Upper Douglass Dog Park
recently and there was speculation that people were
going to the recently reopened Stern Grove. I thought
I would check it out, so Amber and I went there on
Friday afternoon, August 17.

My first problem was finding it. I knew it was west of
the Stern Grove amphitheater, so I wondered along
Crestlake until I found a road going into the park at
Vale. It opened up into a small parking lot with a
lush grassy valley on the left. That was the dog
park, but it looked too good and there was no sign or
fence so I went right. I followed a service road that
became a cart path that became a dead end past the
amphitheater. I made a U-turn over the grass trying
to look as cool as possible in my wife's minivan. I
saw a guy with a dog. &quot;Oh good,&quot; I thought, but first
I looked for a disguise, but I had left my Groucho
glasses at home. I swallowed my pride, rolled down
the window and asked him where the dog park was. With
a tolerant smile he pointed back from whence I came.

I parked and proceeded into the park. It's wider than
Upper Douglass with heavily-wooded, steep hills on
both sides and beautiful, lush grass in the middle.
It runs for at least a third of a mile, but there are
no fences, so it's not recommended if your dog doesn't
have great recall or tends to wonder off. Also, if
you have a Lab, Pine Lake Park is a few blocks west of
the off-leash area and that's probably where you'll
find him if he takes off.

There were relatively few people and dogs there
compared to the size of the park. There were NO dog
walkers. There are two water fountains and many more
bench seats than people. The only FUDDP dog I saw was
Sam the sheepdog, who left as we were entering.

As we entered the park, a cute black dog chased Amber.
Great; this is why we came to the park. The owner
ran over and apologized for his dog. &quot;Huh!&quot; Later
another dog chased Amber and was chastised by her
owner. After telling her three times that it was okay
and they were just playing, she relented, but yelled
at her dog when it approached another dog. &quot;Huh!&quot;

I noticed that there were almost no dogs running
around and absolutely no wolf play. Except for Amber,
I did not see one dog poop. I guess they thought the
grass was too nice. There was a row of four old
ladies sitting on a bench in the shade with their lap
dogs... in their laps. One guy with a poodle puppy was
apparently offended by the idea of his dog sniffing
another dog, because he kept pulling her away. I
expected to find a doggy valium pusher behind every
tree, but they eluded me.

To be fair, I did meet some nice owners and nice dogs,
especially a whole family out with their white lab and
Esther out with her husky puppy Kiki.

Physically, the park is very nice, but many of the
owners seemed wound a little too tight. Perhaps the
rowdy regulars of Upper Douglass Dog Park (RROUDDP)
should have an intervention.

Subject: My take on Stern Grove

This is inspired by Bill's review on his first visit
to the new dog park at Stern Grove.  I've been taking
Glicka there since May or June....long before it
officially opened.  I agree with much of what Bill
reported, but have some differing views as well.

First of all, the directions. Drive west on Sloat.
Stay in your right lane as you will be making a right
turn on VALE....well past Stern Grove....about 10 blocks
from 19th Ave.  After one block on Vale you will see
the iron bar gate for the park, and a park road that
disappears down a hill into a ravine.  If the gate is
opened, drive down to the generous parking lot, and
you are there.  You will see the broad expanses of the
dog park, on your left, as you descend to the parking
area.  If the gate is closed, park on street above
gate.  The walk down is easy, but save some energy for
your exit.  Dogs don't seem to mind.

The park.   In its new configuration, the park at
Stern Grove is without doubt the premiere dog park of
the city.  Literally acres and acres of lush green
broad lawns to run Fido on.  Two new dog/people water
fountains, nice walking paths and several rest
benches.  Top notch design....but the execution, sad to
say, is of a quality level poor enough for the
contractor to qualify for construction work in Iraq.

The area was an old lakebed.  While the new lawns are
green, one will soon learn that waterproof shoes are
required.  It is really a bog.  Your dog won't get
very muddy....as long as the grass stays green.  But
check your shows before you climb back into your car.
They will probably be soaked.  The plush lawns are
laced with heavy duty irrigation sprinklers, and
apparently there's a Hydromaniac at the controls.  I
have never seen such over watering.

On the other hand, the two new water fountains provide
little to no water.  The one near the parking lot
emits a dribble at the lower 'doggie drink' bowl.  The
middle and upper bowls stay bone dry, no matter how
hard you press the buttons.

The fountain near the gazebo sitting area is not much
better.  Here, the lower 'doggie drink' bowl is the
bone dry one.  The upper ones work.  Someone has left
a plastic dog water bowl.  To give Fido a drink, you
pick up the plastic bowl near the new fountain, rinse
it out and fill it with water from the upper fountain.
When full, put it back on the ground for you dog, and
a half-dozen others, panting nearby.

I have no idea how much these defective fountains cost
to install, but whatever it is....it's too much.  If we
raise $8k to put one in at Upper Douglass....it batter
damn well work when you press the button!  ALL the
buttons.

The park also now features one of those $5k bulletin
boards.  Why so costly?  Because it is an architects
wet-dream.   A giant bulletin board, built of
expensive timbers, surrounded by a useless thigh-high
fieldstone faux-enclosure...of dubious function.

They built the same monstrosity on top of Bernal Hill.
It is a TOTAL waste of funds.  The Temporary Bulletin
Board (which has now been recycled for use at our own
Upper Douglass....is perfectly adequate and functional.
Personally, I would lobby to retain it as our
permanent bulletin board...and get a 'credit' of about
$4,500. toward our own water fountain, or fence
enclosure.

The park has little perimeter fencing...but because of
its location, literally, in a 'bowl', it really
doesn't need it.  Your dog will understand what the
boundaries are.

If you follow the walking path westward past the broad
lawns, and past the Kids Day Camp building, you'll
find a small pond....with ducks.  If you have a water
dog he/she will be tempted.  It looks good, but it is
polluted as hell.  Your dog will stink if he/she takes
a dip.  Bring a ball and chucker, and stick to the
lawns.

My experience with the Park Ambiance, and personality
of its denizens, has been mixed.  Some very nice
creatures, and some who think their poop don't stink.
The canines are the former.  One lady chided me when I
offered 'Border Collie?' as a guess for her pet.  &quot;No&quot;
...she informed me, in a tone I've not heard since third
grade...&quot;An Aussie....See?  No tail.  Border Collies have
tails&quot;.  Fine, now I know. I like tails.

Bottom line? Don your après ski boots and bring your
doggie to the new Stern Grove Park.  Fido will have a
great time, and probably get exhausted. Maybe get
humped by a very exotic dog.  You, will stay rested
(if the gate is opened), and take pleasure in the
knowledge that you have 'gotten your money's worth',
by treating your dog to the finest dog park the city
has to offer.  Until they come up with another several
Million....for the Upper Douglass Super Makeover.  But
don't hold your breath.
