I don't believe that there is no 3G on the iPhone. That would not make
any sense at all. The pre-show information stated that there would be
two versions, one 3G, one EDGE. Maybe the 3G version is delayed by a few
months so they didn't want to announce it.

You're only locked into Cingular if you want a iPhone.

&gt; Strictly speaking, it's not only for Cingular; they're just getting it
&gt; first. I'm sure T-Mobile will have it too once the exclusivity period
&gt; runs out. You can also likely look for different technology versions
&gt; so it will work with other carriers.

Jobs said they developed their new phone with, and for, Cingular which,
he said, is the best carrier with the most subscribers.  He said that
Cingular and Apple will continue to work together to innovate with this
phone and other ideas.

He also said that they are changing the name of the company from Apple
Computer to Apple, Inc. because they are no longer just a computer company.

It runs OSX so whatever PIM functions (or ANY functions really) you could
run on your Mac you could run on this (in theory, we won't know till June I
guess).

True.  But it does support 802.11g if you happen to be in range of a wi-fi network.

Yes, but why wouldn't they include 3G so that it can use Cingular's
HSDPA networks. EDGE is too slow. The original reports on the iPhone
said that there would be two versions, a lower cost EDGE version, and a
higher cost 3G version. Maybe the 3G version is the follow-on product,
but spending $600 for a phone without 3G is ludicrous.

I think waiting a few months to same how this all sorts out is what's in
order anyway. Thankfully (I guess) my Cingular contract prevents me from
doing any upgrading for a few months.

They can sell the current phone in Europe too; all the features they
have work there as well.  3G support on the phone is valueless in Europe,
however, unless the phone also supports 2100 MHz, and a 5-band phone is a
problem no manufacturer has tackled yet.

Maybe they're leaving that for their next trick.  I can't imagine this
phone will remain at $600 forever (the first RAZR I saw, in Hong Kong,
well before Cingular began to sell them, was US$1000).

And, in either case, be locked into a proprietary music file format.
Interesting that people who are unwilling to be locked into a cell

No question it is an awesome phone. Just another revolutionary step by
Apple. A big issue however, is the tie in with Cingular. That
association will prove to be a noose around iPhone's neck.

Cingular is old-school in all aspects, right down to their crappy
customer service and constant "take it or leave it" attitude toward
customers.

No.

- WMA files must be converted to AAC
- You have the OPTION of downsampling music to 128bps AAC, but this is to
enable you to fit more songs

You can definitely play native MP3s on all current iPods.

Hopefully this is the case. I'd advise waiting for the 3G version, even
if it ends up being more expensive, but the price points of this device
are not going to hold up at $500 and $600.

If you look at the device as an OSx web pad/iPod/PDA, the price isn't

I was in BJ's, next to Apple's campus in Cupertino, about six months ago
and I overheard some Apple people talking about the iPhone, and Verizon.
They had pitched it to Verizon, but Verizon made some unacceptable demands:

1. Bluetooth needed to be disabled, except for the headset.
2. Music could only be downloaded from Verizon's music service
3. WiFi would be disabled anytime the device detected Verizon's network
4. The OS would have to be Windows Embedded
5. Every photo taken would have to be immediately transferred across
Verizon's network
6. No roaming onto any non-Verizon CDMA network, even at extra cost

To me a phone like this with all it's functionality should allow you to
install programs for it to be a pocket pc.  According to several sources, it
is a closed system (like the iPod) and the only functionality you'll get is
whatever Apple gives to you.  Definitely not for power users, but probably
perfect for all the people who prefer Apple to run their iLives.
