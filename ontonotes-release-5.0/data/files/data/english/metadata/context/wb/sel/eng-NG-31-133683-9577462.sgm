Deadly Deviates
Where Truth is more Horrifying than Fiction

By John Dunning

Mulberry Editions, London, 1993. Pictorial Cover. Book Condition: Fine. Dust
Jacket Condition: Very Good. 286 pages. Glossy photo boards, mirrored by DJ.
Solid, clean and square copy of compilation by a noted and prolific true
crime writer. Reprint Edition.

A deviate is someone who deviates from the normal. The twenty murders
described here are certainly very abnormal. Whether the victims be nurses or
nymphomaniacs, hobos or homosexuals, these murders, one and all, deviate
totally from normal standards of behavior. A chilling collection of
extraordinary murders, all the more frightening because every one is true.
Retold in horrifying detail by a foremost crime historian, John Dunning. A
chronicle of some of the most bizarre killings of modern times.
