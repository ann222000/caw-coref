2005 Explorer OEM break-in alarm?

My 2005 XLT was broken into recently...they broke the driver
window...and stole my $140 aftermarket stereo.

I always thought there was some sort of OEM break-in sensors on these
Explorers, but I guess not.  I checked the owner's guide and all I saw
in there were references to the anti-theft system.  Can anyone confirm
this?

Does anyone have any recommendations on a decent, but not overly
expensive, alarm system for a 2005 Explorer?

Thanks!

I do not know about your 2005 XLT but my 1997 XLT has the anti-theft system
as default.  I even accidentally tripped it when I locked the car with the
window open.  I then reached through the window and opened the door.
Surprise!!

You should see an indicator flash on the dash when the system is armed.

There is a theft indicator on the dash... however, this indicator is present
even if the car only has PATs.

There is a red theft indicator on the dash which blinks but the user
manual only talks about how that system protects against theft in the
sense the vehicle won't start without the chip-imbedded ignition key;
no mention about break-in protection or alarm. I guess I'll call Ford
and ask them about it.

What are PATs?

PATs is the Passive AntiTheft System.... In some models the starter will not
operate, in others the starter will operate but the car will start and
immediately die.... I believe that a perimeter alarm was/is offered but we
have never seen any that I can recall in our area....

I understand, from Ford documents, that PATS is such a reliable system that
Ford is considering discontinuing locking steering columns.
