HI I have a used Pismo. I don't use it very often. It has stopped
starting up. I think it is the power supply chip. Does anyone know
where I can get another one? A chip not another laptop.:)
I thought it was the jack but it appears to be solid there. Also
anyone know where I can get a decent inexpensive battery? My Pismo
came with a dead battery.
thanks,
starflyre

Try just unplugging the PRAM battery completely, then plug the laptop into
the AC Adapter and turn it on.  That did it for me... my PRAM battery ended
up not even being bad, it was just so drained it wouldn't turn on.  Once the
laptop was on, I plugged in the PRAM battery and it charged and now the
computer works flawlessly for free

First thing to try is reset the power manager.

Hi StarFlyre !

I have a Pismo as well......and have found this link
to be a useful source of information on everything
regarding the PowerBook G3:

http://www.lowendmac.com/pb2/pismo.shtml

Check the &quot;Online Resources&quot; section

Good Luck !

J.

The first thing to try is to remove the pram battery connector
(located under the keyboard), the main battery, the power supply
cable, and then press the reset button located on the rear.

Reassemble and then try the power button.

Cheers Michael
