Though he could leave the fake breasts at home. The fishnet stockings

He bears a striking resemblance to my dentist, with whom I just had a
lovely visit last Tuesday. A dear friend and an ace dentist. (If anybody
in the Seattle area needs a recommendation, drop me a line and I'll send
you his name, etc.)

It's a very progressive practice. However, I do think he spends more
time in a snowmobile suit than in fishnets, based on our most recent
conversation.

I did originally go to him because he and his office mate advertise in
the local GLBT business guide. It's the office mate who's gay; my guy is
merely cheerful.

Thanks for the pointer.  Actually, this smoking gun URL led me to

My dentist is a 52 year old woman from Boston who practices in
Providence. She commutes every day.

She's a spectacular dentist though. My former dentist who is a member of
the examining board for new dentists is a quack. She's thorough.

I have no idea how long that would take one-way, so can't comment on
that specifically.

but I do know that I used to commute from Scarberia to downtown Trawna
(McCowan &amp; Eglinton to University and College), which took 55-60 min
one way.  You can put up with anything if you're doing it all the

year period, or 2.5 working years in the subway/bus.  that was the
mental arithmetic.  adding in weekend travel and a calculator, and I
realised that I was spending 11% of my waking life in transit.  It was
at that point I realised I wanted to move downtown.

I now live a 20minute walk from work.

something tells  me I couldn't walk (or even drive) from Boston to
Providence in 20min.  It was as if seven hours a week dropped into my
life when I moved downtown.

Alfonso and I each spend at least an hour commuting every day.  And, due
to our schedules, we can't even carpool.
If I don't get on the freeway before 7am coming and 3pm going, it's a
total loss and the time increases dramatically.  We hate it, but we simply
couldn't afford to buy a house in a more central location, so we're suburban
gurlz.  The upside is that there is still lots of undeveloped ranchland
around us and we get some fabulous birds at the feeder.  And it's super
quiet.

Yeah, you've got to time Hartford right. Though, with the
condition of most of the roads in Ct. the timing is only
half the problem.

&gt;&gt; If you can walk at 150 mph, you probably won't have trouble finding work.

&gt;I walk at a normal pace (about 5-7km/h), and it's only 20 minutes one
&gt;way from home to where I've worked for the last 20 years.  I quite
&gt;like living in downtown Trawna.  There are all kinds of condominia (hi
&gt;david!) being built hereabouts, so the trend of living within walking
&gt;distance of downtown isn't going away any time soon.

I believe the train trip is something short of 45 minutes one way.

At the moment, I'm spending around 20 hours a week on trains to
different parts of the UK- mostly trips of over a couple of hours each.
I love it. I get a lot of work done on the laptop, can read, listen to
music, have a drink, relax. It's by far my favourite way of travelling.
I haven't driven a car since my US license expired, and never plan to
again.

I don't mind planes, despite the environmental consequences. Not least
because I'm so short- I always wondered why other people complained
about the lack of leg room! :)
