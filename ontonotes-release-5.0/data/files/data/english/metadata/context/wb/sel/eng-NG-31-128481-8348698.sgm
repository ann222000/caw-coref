The CIA and Fatah

pies, Quislings and the Palestinian Authority

By Mike Whitney

When Hamas gunmen stormed the Fatah security compounds in Gaza last
week they found huge supplies of American-made weaponry including 7,400
M-16 assault rifles, dozens of mounted machine guns, rocket launchers,
7 armored military jeeps, 800,000 rounds of bullets and 18 US-made
armored personnel carriers. They also discovered something far more
valuable--- CIA files which purportedly contain &quot;information about the
collaboration between Fatah and the Israeli and American security
organizations; CIA methods on how to prevent attacks, chase and follow
after cells of Hamas and the Committees; plans about Fatah
assassinations of members of Hamas and other organizations; and
American studies on the security situation in Gaza.&quot; (Aaron Klein,
WorldNetDaily.com)

If the documents prove to be authentic, they will confirm what many
critics of Fatah believed from the beginning; that US-Israeli
intelligence agencies have been collaborating with high-ranking members
of the PA to help crush the Palestinian national liberation movement.
The information could be disastrous for Palestinian President Mahmoud
Abbas and his newly-appointed emergency government. It could destroy
their credibility before they even take office.

The extent of Fatahs cooperation with the CIA is still unknown, but an
article in The New York Sun, (Hamas Takes over Gaza Security Services
6-15-07) suggests that the two groups may have been working together
closely. Former Middle East CIA operations officer Robert Baer, who was
interviewed in the article, said that the discovery of the documents
was a major blow to Fatah and will show a record of training, spying
on Hamas.

Baer added ironically, Fatah equals CIA is not a good selling point.

Baer is right. The uncovering of the documents is big trouble for
Abbas who is already facing a loss of public confidence from his
closeness to Israel and for his appointment of Salam Fayyad, the
ex-World bank official who the Israeli newspaper Haaretz calls
everyones favorite Palestinian.

Perhaps more significant is the fact that members of Hamas who spoke
with WorldNetDaily claimed that the files contain, among other
information, details of CIA networks in the Middle East and that Hamas
plans to use these documents and make portions public to prove the
collaboration between America and traitor Arab countries. Imagine what
a headache it will be for the Bush administration if Hamas exposes the
broader network of US spies and Arab quislings operating throughout
region.

Bush Support for Regime Change in the PA

Its no secret that the Bush administration has been funneling money to
Palestinian militias that are preparing to overthrow Hamas. On Monday,
Condoleezza Rice announced that the US would resume full assistance to
the Palestinian government and end the year long boycott to the people
in the West Bank. The new aid&quot;which could amount to as much as $86
million---will be used to shore up the PA security apparatus and pay
the salaries of officials in the emergency government. The uncovering
of the CIA documents in Gaza will cast a cloud over the
administrations largesse and make Abbas look like a Palestinian Karzai
who gets financial treats from Washington to follow their diktats.

Yesterday, Condoleezza Rice was given the task of outlining the
administrations new policy vis--vis the Abbas emergency
government. The Bush team had already decided the night before that
they would throw their full support behind Abbas and his unelected
clatter of pro-western stooges. Rice could hardly contain her glee the
next day when she ascended the podium and began wagging her finger
reproachfully at Hamas:

&quot;Hamas has made its choice, Condi growled. It has sought to attempt
to extinguish democratic debate with violence and to impose its
extremists agenda on the Palestinian people in Gaza, now responsible
Palestinians are making their choice and it is the duty of the
international community to support those Palestinians who wish to build
a better life and a future of peace.&quot;

This typically Orwellian statement was intended to justify the deposing
of the legally-elected government of Palestine. No matter; Rices
pronouncements are always reiterated verbatim in the media without
challenge regardless of how incongruous they may be.

The Bush administration had plenty of time to observe developments on
the ground and make an informed decision about what to do next. There
was no need to hurry. Instead, they decided to blunder ahead and launch
their West Bank First policy which commits US support to Abbas
without any consideration of the public mood. The frantic pace of the
decision-making, makes it look like Bush and Olmert are elevating Abbas
to promote their own political agendas. Naturally, the Palestinians can
be expected to resent this conspicuous outside meddling.

Former President Jimmy Carter was the first to blast Bushs new plan.
He said that the United States, Israel and the European Union must end
their policy of favoring Fatah over Hamas, or they will doom the
Palestinian people to deepening conflict between the rival movements].
Carter said that Hamas, besides winning a fair and democratic mandate
that should have entitled it to lead the Palestinian government and
that the Bush administration's refusal to accept the 2006 election
victory of Hamas was ~criminal.

Carters comments appeared in just one newspaper--the Jerusalem Post.
The ex-president has been increasingly marginalized since he dared to
imply that Israel is an apartheid state. But Carter's analysis is
dead-on---Bush is just aggravating an already tense situation. Hed be
better off trying to bring the two sides together and reconciling their
differences rather than igniting a potentially explosive confrontation.
Besides, Abbas close ties to Washington and Tel Aviv doesnt bode well
for his governments long-term prospects. The US and Israel are widely
reviled in the occupied territories and, as author Khalid Amayreh says,
Palestinians wont accept a Vichy Government.

Three days ago Abbas disbanded the Hamas-dominated parliament and
sacked Prime Minister Ismail Haniyeh. Abbas had no legal justification
for this action. In fact, the &quot;Basic Law&quot; which applies to this case
stipulates that The President cannot suspend the legislative Council
during a state of emergency and there is no provision whatsoever for
an emergency government. The president does not even have the
authority to call for new elections---let alone, replace the elected
representatives of the people. Abbas only support comes from political
leaders in Tel Aviv and Washington and their reluctant accomplices in
the EU.

The key issue here is whether democratic elections have any real
meaning or if they can simply be rescinded by executive decree?

This question should be as relevant to Americans as it is to
Palestinians. After all, both people now face a similar predicament;
the flagrant abuse of executive authority to enhance the powers of the
president. In both cases, the president must be forced to conform to
the law. Democracy cannot be decided by fiat.

Free elections are not a crime---that is, unless one lives in the
Occupied Territories. Then voting for the candidate of ones choice
provides the justification for cutting off food, water, medicine, and
financial resources&quot;as well a stepping up a campaign of illegal
detentions, destruction of personal property and targeted
assassinations.

This is what the Bush Doctrine looks like in the Gaza Strip today.
The occupants of the most densely populated place on earth
participated in the balloting at insistence of the Bush administration
and theyve been rewarded for their cooperation with a savage boycott
and daily brutality.

If Bush didnt want democracy, then why did he force it on the
Palestinians?

Political powerbrokers in the US and Israel immediately rejected the
election results and initiated a plan to scuttle Hamas through economic
strangulation, persistent harassment and covert warfare. For the last
year, the newly elected government has shown remarkable restraint
under constant assault. Hamas has kept its word and refrained from
suicide bombings in Israel even though hundreds of Palestinian
civilians have been killed or injured during that same time. In fact,
there has NOT BEEN ONE HAMAS-BACKED SUICIDE BOMBING SINCE THE PARTY
TOOK OFFICE. (This fact is invariably ignored by the media which is
far-more sympathetic to the Israeli position) We should remember that
suicide bombing has been used for years as the excuse for putting off
final settlement negotiations. Now that the bombing has stopped,
Israel has invented an entirely new excuse to avoid dialogue, that is,
that Hamas refuses to recognize the state of Israel.

Actually, it is Israel that refuses to accept Palestinian statehood---a
fact that is further underlined by its relentless efforts to topple the
Hamas government.

Hamas has done nothing illegal since they were elected. The Qassam
rockets which are fired into Israel are the unavoidable corollary of
the 40-year long occupation. How is Hamas supposed to stop these
sporadic attacks? If Israel seriously believed that Hamas was
responsible for the rockets, they wouldnt hesitate to arrest or kill
every leader in the current parliament. The fact is, Israel knows that
Hamas is not instigating these attacks. Its just another red herring.

Regardless of what one may think about Hamas, Prime Minister Ismail
Haniyeh has shown that he is a man who can be trusted to keep his word.
In an interview in the Washington Post with Lally Weymouth, Haniyeh and
asked him if Hamas sought the obliteration of the Jewish people?
