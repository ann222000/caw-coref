Like the tobacco industry, the soft drink industry will face their
judgement soon. Cocacola and Peppsi are the giants that have been scooping
off many beverage companies around the world. For example, Coca-cola
company have taken over a most popular water company named Evian. Evian was
under Denone and now both are under the tyrannic control of Coca-cola. This
move by Coca-cola by itself should alert the consumers that the company is
taking control of the segment of the market it fears the most: non-
poisonous beverages.

The power of Coca-cola and its influence in the world politics are
significantly destructive. The poison that Coca-cola and Peppsi companies
have been pumping down the throats of billions of children will be
transformed into the dead sentences passed on the evil executives at Coke
and Peppsi alike.

The irony is health officials are too corrupted to act in the interests of
the consumers. And the media is also too wrapped up in its voracious
appetite for money. This leaves the consumers with no protection what so
ever. By brain washing the consumers with intense advertisements every
where, these soft drink companies are basically injecting the poison into
the lives of our chidren while making us think they are feeding us with
good stuff.

I can't wait to see Coco-cola and Pepsi executives have their days in hell.

What's your comment got to do with reality? The article is about deceit:
lying to consumers and presenting poison to the consumer, as safe and
wholesome for consumption. The only side that many/most consumers is
from Big Business. Big Business is far removed from ethical and moral
behavior these days. The old line, that communists used, that lies were
a useful and acceptable tools in the communist cause has been more
blatantly exhibited by Globalist Big Business as normal behavior  in the
pursuit of profits.

Well put! People like Larry Bud is the butt hole of Big Business. They
have surrendered their soul and dignity to the devils. Their blood has
been replaced with poisonous substance injected in them by evil bastards
in corporate America.

GREED has become an acceptable norm in America. Ethics, morality, and
human decency are the things of the past. It's quite ironic that the
Republicans have been complaning about "morality" but they themselves
represent a large percentage of GREEDY, unscrupulous, hypocritical
dumbshit living in US.

Here's clue for you:  If you stick a screwdriver in your eye, don't
expect the tool manufacturer to make you and your family independantly
wealthy.

Not everything you eat or drink is going to make you healthy.  In

You proved the point for me Caveat Emptor. Problem: not everyone is
Psychic or so distrustful or paranoid as to not accept what the
Corporatists advertisers tell us tell us. When the "government" puts it
stamp of approval on the product, most people will then accept it's
wholesomeness. Most haven't recognized we are lacking in representation
in the process. Big Money buys the access.

Is a screwdriver marketed for the purpose of insertion into people's
eyes? Soft drinks are marketed for the purpose of drinking.

Why don't you try a VALID comparison, for a change?

There's no shortage of information on how to eat healthy. If you're to

therefore, he's a human walking trash. His comparision of soft drink with
screw driver speaks for itself: a genuine dumbshit trying show off his

It is valid, because you have to be a moron to believe that drinking
water full of sugar isn't going to cause obesity, any more than
sticking a screwdriver into your eye isn't going to injure you.

The real question is how long have you believed that drinking water
full of sugar WON'T cause obesity?

What other things don't you believe?
Eating MacDonalds every day for a month won't make you fat.
Drinking alcohol won't make you drunk.
Smoking won't make you cough.
Laying around on the couch won't make you lazy and fat.
Spilling hot coffee into your lap won't burn you.
Using the hair dryer in the bathtub won't electrocute you

See, there's lots of things in this world in which you need to take
responsibility of yourself.  I know it's hard not having nanny
government watch over you every second of the day, but that's what
being free is all about.
