I Believe in Disengagement
by Zeev Shemer

I believe it is time to disengage.

As I watch our children run for shelter from Kassam rockets launched from Gaza into Sderot, and as I watch on TV the laughs of the members of the Islamic Jihad, who shamelessly call the rockets they launched &quot;a gift to Israeli children for their first day at school&quot; - yes, I believe in Disengagement.

It is time to give power to those who still love our land.

As I witness the capitulations issued by Ehud Olmert and Ehud Barak's office, their bent position as our American allies dictate our foreign policy; as I watch the people in Tel Aviv go about their daily activities and feeling maybe just a few minutes of humiliation when they pass by a TV newscast or a newspaper stand; as I see our people turn into cowards - I believe in Disengagement.

I believe it is time to disengage from the Olmerts and Baraks. Time to disengage from military leaders who are afraid to lead. Time to disengage from leftist sociopaths who, after seeing evil in our enemies, still believe in humanitarian nonsense. It is time to give power to those who still love our land, to those who would never stand still and watch as our children are being targeted.

Today, I drove in the Golan Heights and several tanks stopped traffic to cross the road. Our beautiful and brave soldiers - they wear that uniform with pride. When Olmert said, &quot;We are tired of fighting,&quot; he meant only himself. Our boys, if given the opportunity, would place those filthy terrorists right were they belong. Our boys are proud, they are strong, they sanctify the name of our God every second they wear that uniform; they are the backbone of the State of Israel.

Yes, the spirit of many was broken when they were sent to destroy Jewish homes. Many quit, some took their own lives and many promised to leave this country as soon as their service was over. Many soldiers and many of our reservists felt the same way after the fiasco in Lebanon. Many more lost their spirit after months and months went by and our three missing soldiers became a non-issue in the daily shenanigans of the corrupt and stench-filled Knesset.

I disengage from the appeasers, the humanists, the liberals, the politically blind. I disengage from those who sold their souls to the Americans, the Europeans, the Chinese and the Russians. I disengage from those who could not care less about our missing soldiers, about Jonathan Pollard, about the town of Sderot, about Homesh, about Hebron - about being Jewish, being proud and being free.

I disengage from every leftist in Israel and on planet Earth. I disengage from every Holocaust denier and Muslim-appeaser, from every spineless coward who calls Arab
I disengage from every leftist in Israel and on planet Earth.
terrorists &quot;militants&quot;; from all whose heads are buried in the sand, from those who are too tired of fighting, of thinking, of caring. From them, I disengage.

Instead, I support every soul called a &quot;settler&quot; and every &quot;hilltop youth&quot;. Every man, woman and child who still wears that orange arm band, every person who still feels chills down his spine when he sees an Israeli flag, when he hears our anthem, when he hears our rabbis pray, our children sing, our boys enlist, our youth dance, our young mothers push their baby carriages, an oleh (new immigrant) touching the Kotel (Western Wall) for the first time.

To them, I pledge my life.
