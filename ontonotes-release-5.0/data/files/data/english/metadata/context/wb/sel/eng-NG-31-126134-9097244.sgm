&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Given how magnificently the first film sucked, I had no
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; great hopes when I heard they were making a sequel. Aside
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; from throwing the continuity of  both franchises out the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; window, the first film suffered greatly from the current
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; distressing trend among major studios to water down horror
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; films to capture the junior-high demographic (who presumably
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; won't be able to see R-rated movies). Hence the result was
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a bastardized PG-13 video game version of two wonderful
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; R-rated franchises.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; After watching this trailer, however, I'm very pleased. It
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; looks like they've dumped the PG-13 approach and have gone
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for the gusto. Both the aliens and the predator are once
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; again the ruthless killing machines they were originally
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; conceived to be. This trailer alone is better than the entire
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; last movie.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I'd still prefer an honest to god decent sequel to either
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ALIENS or Predator without mixing the two like a WWE title
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; match, but at least this one looks like it will deliver
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the goods it promises.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And adding Reiko Aylesworth (Michelle Dessler from &quot;24&quot;) to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the cast wasn't a bad move, either.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Oh and one other thing? Never ever go out searching in the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; deep dark woods at night when something mysterious comes
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; crashing out of the sky. It will inevitably end in tears.

&gt; &gt; &gt; I would be interested to know how the continuity of both
&gt; &gt; &gt; franchises was compromised?

&gt; &gt; Here are just two examples:

&gt; &gt; (1) The aliens seemed to impregnate, gestate and emerge from their hosts
&gt; &gt; in a matter of 15 minutes or so. Then they grew from infants to
&gt; &gt; full-sized warriors in the same amount of time. That directly
&gt; &gt; contradicts the continuity of every previous ALIEN film, where the time
&gt; &gt; from impregnation to &quot;birth&quot; was at least a day or more. And then
&gt; &gt; another day or so for the creature to grow into full adult size.

&gt; I mentally justified that by saying to myself that these were FRESH
&gt; eggs.  We'd never seen FRESH eggs before.  And I don't think we know how
&gt; long it took in Aliens.  Alien Cubed was just a bad dream Ripley had,
&gt; and a nightmare the audience had.

&gt;  Also

&gt; &gt; the fact that the aliens are on earth in our time instead of being first
&gt; &gt; encountered by humanity in the far future.

&gt; hey, now, is that worse than Archer in Enterprise meeting every single
&gt; alien race first, and never making a note of it?

&gt; &gt; (2) The two previous &quot;Predator&quot; films established that the predators
&gt; &gt; only hunt in the hottest environments on earth. In that movie, they not
&gt; &gt; only dropped that bit but they turned it around 180-degrees and set it
&gt; &gt; in Antarctica-- the *coldest* climate on earth.

&gt; If they do this hunt every hundred years -- on every 100th October 10th,
&gt; 'cause that's metric -- what were they doing running around inbetween
&gt; 1904 and 2004?  And how come they aren't doing this in 1900 and 2000 --
&gt; wouldn't that be more metric?  And how does a heat sig you can see from
&gt; space attract a whaler in 1904 anyway?

&gt; And if your ultimate goal is to destroy the aliens without, under any
&gt; circumstances, letting it into the outside world, is just tossing the
&gt; living queen into the open ocean really your best option?

&gt; And if there's 2000 feet of ice over this pyramid that was above sea
&gt; level before it was covered in ice, how did that 1904 whaler get up
&gt; there -- with WHALES???

&gt; &gt; &gt; It seemed to me that the fact that the incident was in such
&gt; &gt; &gt; an isolated region, no continuity was breached.

&gt; &gt; But when the archaeologist reads the hieroglyphs we get a flashback
&gt; &gt; scene showing predators and aliens fighting major battles all throughout
&gt; &gt; human history. It wasn't just an isolated incident.

&gt; I was more concerned about howlers like &quot;The Aztec calendar is metric,
&gt; 'cause it's base 10, so the combination must be October 10th, and reset
&gt; itself every 10 minutes&quot;

&gt; And flying face huggers.

&gt; Or that the stone walls of this temple under 2000 feet of ice are giving
&gt; off a heat signature you can see from outer space, and yet it's still
&gt; cold down there and infrared shows humans as way hotter than the walls.

&gt; Or that hero chick has a GPS watch that not only works at the south
&gt; pole, but under 2000 feet of ice.
