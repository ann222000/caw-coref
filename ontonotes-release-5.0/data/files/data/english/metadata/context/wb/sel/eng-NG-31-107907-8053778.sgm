&quot;Cutting CO2 or a Sneak Attack on Porsche, Ferrari?

By Doron Levin

July 10 (Bloomberg) -- If one of the more extreme responses to global
warming comes true, driving a sports car anywhere but on a racetrack
might be relegated to history's dustbin.

Fast, powerful cars within a few years may be outlawed in Europe, an
idea that has been raised ostensibly because Ferraris and Porsches
produce too much carbon dioxide. For those who abhor sports cars as
vulgar symbols of affluence (along with vacation homes, furs and fancy
jewelry), such a ban could be a two-fer: Saving the planet while cutting
economic inequality.

Who are these people anyway who decide on behalf of everyone what car is
proper to drive? In the U.S. they're members of Congress, which is
considering fuel-efficiency standards that will affect vehicle size. In
Europe, it's the ministers and parliamentarians of the European Union,
which wants to limit how much CO2 cars can emit as a proxy for a fuel-
consumption standard.

Chris Davies, a British member of the European Parliament, is proposing
one of the most-extreme measures -- a prohibition on any car that goes
faster than 162 kilometers (101 miles) an hour, a speed that everything
from the humble Honda Civic on up can exceed. He ridiculed fast cars as
``boys' toys.''

The proposed ban would take effect in 2013. Davies told the Guardian
newspaper that ``cars designed to go at stupid speeds have to be built
to withstand the effects of a crash at those speeds. They are heavier
than necessary, less fuel-efficient and produce too many emissions.''

His last point is telling, even though there are many reasons why cars
are heavier, including safety measures such as air bags and
steel-reinforced crumple zones.

Focused on Cars

The idea is to limit CO2, a so-called greenhouse gas blamed for causing
the earth's temperature to rise.

But the debate isn't just about how much carbon dioxide to allow into
the atmosphere and whether the amount actually matters. It's also about
disdain some hold for the size or speed of the cars others drive.

``Automobiles always seem to be the focus, even though they only consume
15 percent or 20 percent of energy,'' said Csaba Csere, editor of Car &amp;
Driver magazine. If politicians really cared about the atmosphere they
might concentrate first on power plants or factories, he said.

The folks against sports cars in Europe and big sport utility vehicles
in the U.S. often are same ones who hate McMansion-sized homes,
corporate jets, jumbo freezers, yachts, 60-inch flat-screens TVs,
overnight-delivery services and other trappings of Western-style wealth
and energy use.

Do people demonize these goods because they can't afford them? Or
because they think others shouldn't have them? Proposals to limit carbon
dioxide often sound like basic opposition to prosperity and rising
living standards.

Planet in Peril?

Outside of a handful of command economies, few today would agree that a
central authority ought to regulate who owns what. But attacking those
who ``waste'' energy achieves the same goal.

Many ardent environmentalists are convinced that the planet is in peril.
Why can't they be just a bit cautious, humble or skeptical in their
advocacy of reduced energy consumption, which in turn must mean reduced
global economic growth?

The main reason I'm wary of Al Gore's call for radical, immediate
reduction of worldwide energy consumption is that he's way too sure that
the human race is on the cusp of catastrophe. With no credentials of his
own, Gore relies on scientists who insist we must hurry because we're
approaching a point of no return.

But how about other scientists, ones who aren't sure we're on the brink?
Richard Lindzen of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, a leading
climatologist, says that even if nothing is done to limit CO2, the world
will heat up by 1 degree Celsius, or a couple of degrees Fahrenheit, in
the next 50 to 100 years.

Move Inland

We know from everyday experience that weather forecasting is a
notoriously inexact. And if the world got a bit warmer there might be
more arable land and longer growing seasons in northern latitudes. Is it
heresy to suggest that if seas rise, moving back from the shore might be
more practical than trying to change the weather?

The polar bear population, supposedly close to being wiped out, is ``not
going extinct, or even appear to be affected at present,'' Mitchell
Taylor of the Department of the Environment, Government of Nunavut, told
the Toronto Star last year. One population in the eastern Arctic has
grown to 2,100 from 850 since the mid-1980s, he said.

A half-century ago Rachel Carson popularized the modern environmental
movement with ``The Silent Spring,'' a book claiming that the pesticide
DDT was destroying America's wildlife. The book's impact was reduced use
of the pesticide DDT, thereby leading to the unintended consequence of
more mosquitoes and more malaria deaths in developing countries.

One Little Bite

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other health
agencies noted an alarming rise of malaria in places like South Africa
and Peru after DDT was banned in the late 1970s. Since the mid-1990s,
when DDT spraying resumed, the incidence of the disease has fallen.

Calls for limits on carbon dioxide ignore a basic point. People are
likely to be better judges of the benefits of fast cars, TVs, air
conditioners, and jets than government planners.

Besides, the brunt of government limits on energy use may well fall on
the world's poorest nations, which need more energy -- thus generating
more carbon dioxide -- to provide lighting, refrigeration, harvesting,
water purification and transportation.

What right do environmentalists in rich countries have to deny residents
of poorer ones the benefits of higher living standards?

I have a hunch that a ban on sports cars won't be enacted soon in
Europe, largely because the Italians love their Lamborghinis, the
British their Bentleys and the Germans their Porsches. But this won't be
the last time that anti-consumption crusaders come disguised as
guardians of the Earth.&quot;

They can scrap the idea. Al Gore just wasted far more to produce Live
Aid or whatever it was called (reports indicated ir was not watched by
a lot of even his supporters).  It's pretty much all Hype for Dollars.

Parts of the globe are getting warmer. They fail to report that other
parts are getting colder. They also fail to report that the sun is
getting hotter (and leaving the planet with only about 5 Billion years
before it is incinerated). These so called experts keep leaving things
out of the equation. Clearly, man has an impact, but man isn't the
only cause. For example, another major volcano just erupted in
Indonesia, spewing what? GREENHOUSE GASES!

Oops! I just became a &quot;traitor&quot; because I don't toe the party line on

You just hit on the overwhelming reason global warming is being hyped to
gargantuan proportions.  It is a money grab by scientists to get idiotic
studies funded year after year after year, politicians who are
salivating at the thought of taxing the hell out of us and dictating
nearly every waking action we take and most of all it is the cash cow
AlGore (yes it is one word) could have never envisioned in his wildest
dreams.  The rock stars that have any minute amount of self respect know
this and steered clear of the so called &quot;benefit&quot; last weekend.  The
only thing it was meant to benefit was the pocket books of liberal
politicians, environmental alarmist scientists and the wacko liberal
musician's egos.  I predict we witnessed the beginning of the end for
the whole global warming movement this weekend.  It is quite literally
running out of steam (pun intended). :)

You know I always hear that it hasn't been this hot or there hasn't been
this much CO2 in the atmosphere for (fill in the blank) thousands of
years.  Not one person can answer the question &quot;Why were the CO2 levels
that high and exactly what made the temperatures so high?&quot;  It certainly
wasn't SUVs, power plants etc. burning fossil fuels or millions of cows
farting green house gases.  They can't even predict the weather tomorrow
with 100% accuracy or the severity of the 2008 hurricane season but
somehow they know, without a doubt, that we are going to be roasting on
a spit in 100 years, all of Florida will be under five feet of water and
the new summer vacation hot spot will be Antarctica.

Look at the fluctuation of the oceans just in a short span of human
history.  It has risen around 400 feet in just the last 18,000 years!!!
This is the equivalent of 1&quot; every 3.75 years!  You really want to
know how to screw up the planet?  Try and keep the climate at a constant
level year after year.  Mother Earth has controlled the thermostat for
4.6 BILLION YEARS and now WE think WE can do a better job?  Talk about
arrogance in the extreme.  Let these wackos have their way and the
results very likely will be worse than letting Mother Nature make the
adjustments.

I won't even get into the Sun's impact on global climate.  You know Mars
has been mirroring the Earth's temperature rise?  Now what does that
tell you?  It isn't that the Martians are driving too many SUVs. ;)

For those who are sick of the staus quo, Sam Waterson (yes, the same
Same Waterson who stars on Law and Order with Fred Thompson)is sick of
it, too, and has begun a grass roots, independent, 100% online third
party movement called UNITY08. His views are centrist. He wants no
funding from buisness or other special interests. He wants the people
to submit who they want for a candidate and have the convention
online. For more information, go to www.unity08.com .

&gt; &gt; of the pesticide DDT, thereby leading to the unintended consequence of
&gt; &gt; more mosquitoes and more malaria deaths in developing countries.
&gt; &gt; The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other health
&gt; &gt; agencies noted an alarming rise of malaria in places like South Africa
&gt; &gt; and Peru after DDT was banned in the late 1970s. Since the mid-1990s,
&gt; &gt; when DDT spraying resumed, the incidence of the disease has fallen.

&gt; Malaria probably has fallen off.  But the trade off is DDT getting
&gt; into our food sources.  Would you feel comfortable eating fish that
&gt; has toxic levels of DDT?

&gt; &gt; Calls for limits on carbon dioxide ignore a basic point. People are
&gt; &gt; likely to be better judges of the benefits of fast cars, TVs, air
&gt; &gt; conditioners, and jets than government planners.

&gt; I agree this plan to ban sports cars is wacky.  But don't lump all
&gt; environmentalist together in one group and label them all wackos.
&gt; Environmentalist have done many great things over the years -- saved
&gt; endangered species, cleaned up river and lakes, started energy
&gt; conservation, cleaned up the air, fixed the ozone layer, started pick
&gt; up litter campaigns, to name just a few.

&gt; &gt; Besides, the brunt of government limits on energy use may well fall on
&gt; &gt; the world's poorest nations, which need more energy -- thus generating
&gt; &gt; more carbon dioxide -- to provide lighting, refrigeration, harvesting,
&gt; &gt; water purification and transportation.
&gt; &gt; What right do environmentalists in rich countries have to deny residents
&gt; &gt; of poorer ones the benefits of higher living standards?

&gt; The problem is human population.  Our numbers have grown too large and
&gt; at some point the things we need to live will become scarcer and
&gt; scarcer.

&gt; &gt; I have a hunch that a ban on sports cars won't be enacted soon in
&gt; &gt; Europe, largely because the Italians love their Lamborghinis, the
&gt; &gt; British their Bentleys and the Germans their Porsches. But this won't be
&gt; &gt; the last time that anti-consumption crusaders come disguised as
&gt; &gt; guardians of the Earth.&quot;

&gt; Like any group, not all their plans are sound.  But like the list I
&gt; have above, many of their ideas have been good.  And the good ideas
&gt; are the ones that get accepted/implemented.

&gt; Don't worry, Mike this plan won't go any where...

I think you give too much credit to the Greenies, both on the results
level and the reasonableness level.  Greenism is a state religion.  It
serves all the purposes and fits all the criteria of a religion:  It
explains why bad things happen to good people (Katrina, drought,
floods, even the genocide in the Sudan have been blamed on man-made
causes).  It gives people a simple set of yardsticks to apply to
nearly every decision-making situation.  And it gives the power of
life and death, literally, to its high priests.

Most significantly, and most dangerously:  like all religions, results
in the material world do not matter.  Costs vs. benefits do not
matter.  Doing god's (Gaia's) work is all that matters.  Virtue is its
own reward.

Did you hear the &quot;Seven Point Pledge&quot; (apparently &quot;The Seven
Commandments&quot; didn't test well) that Al Bore bellowed from the stage
at the Meadowlands last Saturday?  And the audience cheered as
mindlessly as any jihadi at a death-to-America rally.  Number one was
an international treaty to cut greenhouse gas emissions by NINETY
PERCENT! There is no technology, no scenario that the most fevered
Greenie brain can conjure, that could come close to such a number,
without simply shutting down modern technology.  Imagine, nine-tenths
of the cars, ships, and airplanes scrapped.  Nine tenths of coal and
gas-based electricity generation switched off.  Nine-tenths of all the
industrial activity which relies on that electricity, shut down.

Actually, death camps for about three quarters of the world's
population would be the only way to make this work, since the shutdown
of the power, gas, and transportation industries would only drive
people to the pre-industrial technologies of horse-based
transportation and wood fires for heating and cooking.

One would expect anyone who advocates such nonsense to be laughed off
the stage.  Al Gore was not.  Rather, the audience roared its
approval.

I heard a podcast radio show on Monday, on the left-wing Pacifica
network (it's on the web), where the host and her guest agreed
heartily with the Seven Points. Here's the full list:
http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/19502465/ These people are, quite simply,
out of their minds.

(Interesting slip-up in that show: the guest stated that the
&quot;scientific consensus,&quot; holding that human activity is causing global
warming, and that the amount of that warming will soon hit a &quot;tipping
point&quot; of no return, is so well-settled that no one can truthfully
disagree. Then he mentioned evolution, and said the scientific
consensus on that science is even stronger than the scientific
consensus on global warming.  How can a proposition be more true than
true?  If all dissent is false, that is as strong as any consensus
could possibly be.)

Maybe I feel it more where I live, Greenie Central, Berkeley CA. It's
scary.  This thing has the potential to shut down life as we know it.
Greenhouse gas (GHG) production is synonymous with modern life.
California just passed a GHG statute, calling for a 25% reduction in
GHG production by 2020.  It gave CARB primary authority to implement
it.  The regulations are to be in place by 2012.  Three measures are
already on the fast track for implementation by 2010: more gasohol for
cars, less methane emissions from landfills, and no more retail sales
of R134a.  No serious scientist (not even a &quot;consensus&quot; one) would
contend  that any of this will make one one-millionth of a degree
difference in this fictitious thing, the &quot;global temperature.&quot;

But get this:  three CARB board members resigned, and so did the
executive director of CARB.  Why?  Because the other six board members
followed CARB's professional staff's recommendation that only these
three measures be fast tracked for 2010 implementation at this point.
The sticking point?  That the three dissenters wanted  to add
&quot;reflective&quot; auto paint to the initial list.  The absurd rationale for
California state regulation of new car paint colors is, that darker
colors cause hotter interiors, which requires more air conditioning
activity, which burns more gas, which produces more CO2.  Like I said,
these people are out of their minds.  Staff, and Gov. Schwarzenegger,
agreed that this regulation would have neglible benefits, and wanted
to leave it off  this initial fast-track list.

But cost/benefit

Berkley! You have my condolences! :0) It's a beautiful place, or was
the last time I was there. A friend of mine is the ONLY conservative
professor at Humbolt State. Like Christ on the Cross, or Gen Custer at
the Little Big Horn.

As for the zealots. I take exception and umbrage with Al Bore and his
stooges (particularly RFK Jr). They keep telling us there is no
questioning &quot;their&quot; 2500 scientists who reached a concensus. BUT,
those scientists didn't. Several of them sued to have their names
REMOVED from the &quot;concensus&quot;. Most of them upheld the part they wrote
(each being on a different aspect of the problem) but disagreed with
the results other members postulated.

And RFK jr, with his, &quot;if you don't agree with us, you're a toadie of
Big Oil, or you are a traitor&quot;.  What the ????.

Is Al the new Adolf or Stalin? Is he going to burn all the books of
those who don't agree with his view? Will the ones who don't belong to
the &quot;party&quot; be shipped off to the camps? These people are more nuts
than the nuts. They're absolutely rabid. And why is it that so many of
them are the affluent ones with the BIG homes, and all the toys?

When was the last time a person on a fixed income could afford to buy
a hybrid auto? Convert their home to solar power, etc?  It's bad
enough that the government wants to force everyone to switch to HDTV
which the masses can't really afford. What will happen when they
government mandates the rules Gore wants instituted? They can't afford
to scrap their present transports and buy new, and there is no
infrastructure for mass transport to cover the entire nation. The gap
between the &quot;haves&quot; and the&quot; have nots&quot; will be so immense that I
would expect to see a revolt.... in which case we'll be rid of 1/10th
of the problem. :0)

Not really.  There is more and more data accumulating that says the
doomsday predictions aren't viable.  Why is Mars warming up along with
the Earth?  You know the ocean has risen almost 400 feet in the last
18,000 years?  That is the equivalent of 1&quot; every 3.75 years.  For the
last 100 years it has risen only 0.058&quot; every year.  Climate change is
the norm not the exception and it has changed far more rapidly in the

&gt; point&quot; of no return, is so well-settled that no one can truthfully
&gt; disagree. Then he mentioned evolution, and said the scientific
&gt; consensus on that science is even stronger than the scientific
&gt; consensus on global warming.  How can a proposition be more true than
&gt; true?  If all dissent is false, that is as strong as any consensus
&gt; could possibly be.)

&gt; Maybe I feel it more where I live, Greenie Central, Berkeley CA. It's
&gt; scary.  This thing has the potential to shut down life as we know it.
&gt; Greenhouse gas (GHG) production is synonymous with modern life.
&gt; California just passed a GHG statute, calling for a 25% reduction in
&gt; GHG production by 2020.  It gave CARB primary authority to implement
&gt; it.  The regulations are to be in place by 2012.  Three measures are
&gt; already on the fast track for implementation by 2010: more gasohol for
&gt; cars, less methane emissions from landfills, and no more retail sales
&gt; of R134a.  No serious scientist (not even a &quot;consensus&quot; one) would
&gt; contend  that any of this will make one one-millionth of a degree
&gt; difference in this fictitious thing, the &quot;global temperature.&quot;

&gt; But get this:  three CARB board members resigned, and so did the
&gt; executive director of CARB.  Why?  Because the other six board members
&gt; followed CARB's professional staff's recommendation that only these
&gt; three measures be fast tracked for 2010 implementation at this point.
&gt; The sticking point?  That the three dissenters wanted  to add
&gt; &quot;reflective&quot; auto paint to the initial list.  The absurd rationale for
&gt; California state regulation of new car paint colors is, that darker
&gt; colors cause hotter interiors, which requires more air conditioning
&gt; activity, which burns more gas, which produces more CO2.  Like I said,

NEVER say never, not where the Church of Green is involved.

In addition to the ethanol, landfill methane sequestration, and R134a
retail sales ban that CARB has already fast-tracked for regulations
with an effective date of January 1, 2010, here is the list of
additional targets that remain under consideration for inclusion in
that same fast-track list:

Manure management (methane digester protocol)
Electrification of stationary agricultural engines
Specifications for commercial refrigeration
Reduction of perfluorocarbons (PFCs) from the semiconductor industry
Reduction of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) from foam production/
installation including extruded polystyrene and block foam
Guidance/protocols for local governments to facilitate GHG emission
reductions
Guidance/protocols for businesses to facilitate GHG reductions
Detection, repair, and recycling equipment for sulfur hexafluoride
(SF6)
Light-covered paving, cool roofs and shade trees
Replacement of high global warming potential (GWP) gases used in fire
protection systems with alternate chemical(s)
Forestry protocol
Reduce venting/leaks from oil and gas systems
Strengthen light-duty vehicle standards
Heavy-duty vehicle emission reductions, efficiency improvements
Cool automobile paints
Port Electrification
Transportation refrigeration, electric standbyEnforce federal ban on
HFC release during service/dismantling of MVACs
Truck stop electrification with incentives for truckers
Tire inflation program
Promote telework policies/incentives TBD
Require low GWP refrigerants for new MVACs
Add AC leak tightness test and repair to Smog Check

This list is from CARB's professional staff report that was issued
prior to the June 21 CARB meeting.  See it for yourself at
http://www.arb.ca.gov/cc/042307workshop/early_action_report.pdf

Also, here's a list of regulatory packages that were already underway
at CARB prior to the passage of the GHG statutory scheme. Staff
included these in its report because these packages also will have GHG-
reducing effects.  The dates indicate each regulatory package's
projected effective date:

Diesel - Commercial harbor craft rule 2007
Diesel - Privately owned on-road trucks 2008
Diesel - Vessel speed reductions 2007 or 2008
Diesel - Offroad equipment (non-agricultural) 2009
Diesel - Port trucks 2007
Diesel - Vessel main engine fuel specifications 2008
Standards for off-cycle driving conditions 2007
Gasoline dispenser hose replacement 2008
Portable outboard marine tanks 2007 or 2008
Evaporative standards for aboveground tanks

Remember, these two lists of targets are merely the opening wedge of
GHG regulation in America. There is already a group of me-to states
ready to adopt anything that CARB comes up with.  There are
independent efforts underway in every statehouse, as well, with
Greenie &quot;stakeholders&quot; proposing similar regulatory packages to fellow-
traveler assemblymen and governors.  They provide complete turn-key
packages, with all the &quot;consensus&quot; science, all the glowing studies
showing no pain, all gain regulatory schemes, and enlisting the aid of
private business dupes to help to reach the not so Green members of
the state government. If you think the utilities and the financial
industry are not salivating over the prospect of an all-new shadow
economy of GHG credits applicable to every facet of economic activity,
I have a couple of bridges to sell you.

In any event, if you can look at CARB's staff's lists and still
believe that there is any area of modern life that the global warming
alarmists would consider off limits to state command and control, you
are, I am sorry to say it, you are NUTS!

Also, if you read Al Gore's Pledge Number 1 -- about the 90% reduction
in man-made GHG emissions -- (I linked to it already in my previous
post) you'll notice he's framed it in terms of an international
treaty.  In other words, it won't even be our state Legislatures, our
Congress, our EPA, our President, or our courts who decide what and
who is in the gunsights.  It will be the politically appointed
representatives of our own international economic competitors!!!
Insane actually does not begin to cover it.

The majority of the stuff on that list will never materialize, IMO.  If
they do the majority of people there will revolt and vote the idiots
out.  The pendulum has just about swung as far toward the environazis as
it is able and will change direction soon.  They are like a fat man at a
buffet restaurant.  They can't get enough stupid legislation passed so
they just keep ginning it up until they piss nearly everyone off.
Enough is never enough for them.

One other thing that will occur is all these doomsday predictions are
seen as over hyped and done to get money.  The polls are out there to
verify this.  The Save the Planet concert last weekend was a bust all
over the world.  IMO, it is the beginning of the end for this latest
environmental disaster de jur.  The people like AlGore are milking the
last drops from the global warming tit.  They know the end is near which
is why their are ratcheting up the rhetoric.

As for Schwarzenegger, he has transformed from being a republican to a
full blown Kennedy molded liberal.  Wait until the people of California
see the fruits of his second term labor.  He is busy turning California
into a third world country.  I guess he has decided he wants to be more
popular at the Kennedy family reunions.

The next environmental disaster will be the human population's rampant

They will say that if we don't stop immediately the crust will be

&gt;&gt; consumption of the Earth's crust to provide all the goods we will need
&gt;&gt; to bring China, India, Africa and the Taliban into the modern world.
&gt;&gt; They will say that if we don't stop immediately the crust will be
&gt;&gt; consumed and we will have to park our asses on the Earth's red hot
&gt;&gt; mantle.  I already have my counter argument ready.  Just think of all
&gt;&gt; the potential electricity we can generate from geothermal sources when
&gt;&gt; that happens.  Then we can run all the air conditioners we need to
&gt;&gt; stay cool and comfortable.
&gt; We wouldn't have to water our lawns, that would save much water.

Now there is an Al Gore deciple!

I have done my own research, and I have read both sides of the
scientific communities reports. The only concensus is in the minds of
those who feed off the fears of others and the mindless ones who feed
them.

Is there a problem? No doubt. Is it man made? There is the problem. In
part it probably is. However, through billions of years of time, there
have been many periods of increaed temperatures and periods of intense
cold. What caused them? Man wasn't around. So, was it Dinos grilling
in their back yards and driving fossil fuel vehicles produced by
factories? Or was it volcanos spewing greenhouse gases? A shift in the
output of the sun? A shift in the axis of the earth? A reversal of the
magnetic poles? Records do not go back far enough to say. You can cite
the records in the polar caps, but that does not indicate the causes
of changes. Why is it that Mastadons, which lived in reputed cold
climates, died in bunches and were preserved instantly frozen WITH
fresh prarie type flowers in their systems?

Al Gore and his cronies would have you ignore any possibility except
their explanation(s). You bite into it without question and then
accuse others of not questioning their own sources. In Al Gore's
reality, there is no room for debate. There is no room for other
opinions. There is only His opinion. How many world dictators have
ruled the masses in the same way?

If you really want to save the environment, get rid of the masses of
people which are consuming the resources. You could start with
yourself. :0)

This is just it.  I read much more than most Americans regarding this
issue.  The press is only promoting the pro warming alarmists.  Funny
how the liberals attack anyone holding opposing views and hard science
in their hands that disputes or refutes their claims of doom and gloom.
Plus, IMO, any scientist worth his salt doesn't get maniacal regarding
his work or make their work political.  They also don't say the science
on what they are studying is &quot;settled&quot; when a large percentage of
scientists, and the public at large, don't agree it is settled.  Do you
know how many scientists of high standing have doubts regarding the
hysterical claims being made?  Do you know how many wanted their names
removed from the UN study because they, and their work, were being
misrepresented and the UN refused to grant their request?

I have a background in science being an engineer and I just smell
something very fishy with these alarmist's rants.  They are trying way
too hard to convince us to take radical action.  Makes me wonder if they
actually believe their own noise or they know the gig is up and the
gravy train is stopping.

Here are few questions I think need answered, or at least studied
further, before we embark on a massive upheaval of society in the name
of saving humanity from itself:

1)  Why is Mars warming along with the Earth?

2)  What other natural processes besides CO2 levels effect global
temperatures?

3)  What is the individual, and collective, impact of these other
natural processes on global warming and cooling?

4)  Is the overall volume of ice on the planet increasing, decreasing or
static and, if changing, at what comparative rate, historically?

5)  What EXACTLY caused the last ice age and why has the Earth been
warming ever since?

6)  From the various known cycles the Sun experiences, what is its
current output level/state and EXACTLY how does its output
fluctuations effect Earth's climate?

7)  How does the level of cosmic radiation effect global climate?  Note
that this is closely tied to question #6.

8)  What would be the impact to global political stability from
enforcing a 90% reduction of CO2 emissions as AlGore demanded last
weekend?

9)  If extensive global warming occurs, what areas will reap benefits
and what areas will suffer?  What is the net effect on mankind and
is money better spent on mitigation or prevention?

9a) Can we actually prevent warming even with practical reductions of
CO2 emissions?

10) How much money has AlGore pocketed from global warming lectures,
books and movies?  If that number is large, then why is he willing
to take huge profits from something he considers to be the potential
exterminator of mankind?  Also, why is he personally responsible for
generating CO2 emissions in a quantity for beyond the average
American?  Why is he not a hypocrite for being such a huge CO2
generator?  How many other anti global warming fanatics are just
like him?

Something that really bothers me with many of the scientists that think
the science of global climate is &quot;settled&quot; is their ability to take a
slice of detailed, emperical climate data from a 10-15 year period and
claim they can extrapolate ACCURATE climate models out to 50, 100, 500
or thousands of years.  Just think about the arrogance and/or absurdity
in that claim considering the time scales involved in establishing long
term climate trends.  They can't tell us how many hurricanes we will see
this season or once one forms what track it will take.

They can't say why the Earth is warming when pushed for a detailed
answer as to the cause.  The only thing they hang their hats on is
rising CO2 levels with recent (10-20 years) temperature increases.  They
can't tell if this is the cause of the of the warming or not.  They are
guessing that it is the cause.  If CO2 does have an impact they can't
say how big a component it is compared to other factors.  They also
can't tell us why temperatures have been relatively stable and for some
decades actually declined while CO2 levels from man's activity have
slowly risen since 1800.  Climate is affected by many, many factors and
they are only keying on the one that fits their political agenda.  If
the warming is being caused by the Sun then what do we do?  We mitigate
the impacts and not prevent them.  That doesn't fit people like AlGore's
agenda.

If mankind is causing temperatures to increase then I would be looking
at other causes like livestock farts/burps, landfill emissions, land
cover changes etc.  CO2 might be a minor effect overall and our efforts
are better spent feeding cows Beanos and Tums than killing 90% of CO2
emissions.  It is this smug attitude that they have warming figured out
and the science is &quot;settled&quot; that makes me so skeptical.  Strip away
their hype and noise and there really is little to their &quot;settled
science&quot; that is settled.

The envirowackos have been targeting oil consumption for decades and,
IMO, this whole global warming emergency they have created is just the
most recent tactic they have employed to stop fossil fuel consumption.

The Sun has numerous known cycles that overlap due to them having

Since sea levels have risen approximately 400 feet in the last 18,000
years (a brief snip of time, geologically) that equates to an AVERAGE
raise of nearly 27&quot; every 100 years.  Over the last 100 years it has
risen 5.8&quot;.  I don't think mankind has been affecting global climate
(and therefore sea levels) for the last 18,000 years.  Seems to me the

Much of Siberia will become productive as will much of Canada.  Growing

possible.  Some areas will be dryer and less habitable but this has been

&gt;&gt;&gt;Watch Al Gore.... He'll go quiet at some point, pick a new disaster
&gt;&gt;&gt;and take off again raking in the grants to pay his light bill.

&gt;&gt;You guys really need to stop listening to Rush Limbaugh, Glenn Beck, and
&gt;&gt;the others and start thinking for yourselves, and doing your own research.

&gt; Now there is an Al Gore deciple!

Uhhh ... Sorry, not an Al Gore disciple, just a well-read individualist.
You're spouting off a lot of Limbaugh talking points in your posts. All
I said was do your own research

Please cite one or more papers in a peer-reviewed journal that questions
whether or not human activity is causing the increase in greenhouse
gasses. Also, please tell me the sources of Al Gore's grants. I would
love to read about them.

Not so. I have done extensive research, using peer-reviewed journal

This statement betrays either a lack of information or a lack of
candor, or both.  &quot;The greenhouse gasses&quot;  includes many things, first
and foremost water vapor and clouds.

If you mean man-made, aka anthropegenic, greenhouse gases,  it is
tautological that human  activity is responsible for them.

If you mean the increase in atmospheric CO2 from about 280 ppm at the
dawn of  the Industrial Revolution to about 380 ppm today, some of
that increase is due to human activity.  However, CO2 levels have
varied widely over the eons, without any human contribution.  A
primary source of these increases is the CO2 that is dissolved in the
oceans and which evaporates when the ocean temperature increases.
That source of atmospheric CO2 is far more potent than man's
comparatively puny contributions.  The historic record is
uncontradicted, that increases in atmospheric CO2 always trail
increases in global temperatures.  This suggests that increases in CO2
are an effect of global warming, not a cause.

That being the case, the burden is on the alarmists to prove their
case. The burden is not on those who continue to maintain an open
mind, that the 1 degree Celsius of global warming during the past 100
years, that is at the core of the alarmist's position, is due to an
unprecedented cause.

Conservation is always a good thing.  But so are a quintupling of
productivity, a doubling of life expectancy, an effective
transportation system, warm homes and workplaces, clean and safe
lighting, refrigerated food, etc., etc., etc. These are the things we
have purchased with whatever the human contribution may have been, to
the 1 degree of warming that has taken place during the past 100 years
of anthropogenic GHG production.

No  one with an open mind could deny that this was a very good
investment.  No one with an open mind would suggest that, if another
two or three degrees of global warming is the price of continuing this
record of progress for another 100 years, that this would also not be
a very good investment.

The alternative, to shut down modern life as the 90% reduction that Al
Gore's Seven Commandments call for, would be a very bad investment.
Please cite to me a peer-reviewed study which shows that such a
program would reduce atmospheric CO2 by even 10-20 ppm over a 50 year
period.

Put another way: CO2 is taken out of the atmosphere two main ways:
plant photosynthesis and going into solution in the ocean.  These are
very slow-acting processes.  The alarmists' own models assume that it
would take about 100 years of stasis between annual CO2 production
from ALL sources, and CO2 removal by means of photosynthesis and
oceanic absorption, for the current 380 ppm to return to whatever the
&quot;natural&quot; level should be.  In other words, it would take 100 years
without any manmade contribution, to return to &quot;normal.&quot;  The
alarmists' own models also predict that the currrent 380 ppm
concentration is sufficient to keep global temperatures on rising. So
even if we stop all industrial activity tomorrow, global temperatures
are going to continue to rise -- according to the alarmists' own
models.

In light of these premises, again the ball is in the alarmists' court
to justify any regulation, on a sound cost/benefit basis.  None of
these effeminate appeals to &quot;future generations&quot;; none of the
Greenists' &quot;virtue is its own reward&quot; secular theology.  Because I
believe that if you give &quot;the future generations&quot; a choice between
expensive, productivity-stifling, life-span-shortening, ineffectual
regulations with no concrete effects, combined with global warming of
2 or 3 degrees Celsius minus some tiny regulation-caused fraction, or
none  of the harmful regulation plus global warming  of 2 or 3
degrees, these &quot;future generations&quot; will choose the latter.&quot;

This is an amazing quote for a pro-regulation alarmist.  Time to drop
it from your sig.

Same here.  In case it has never been pointed out to you in your
travels in cyber-space -- which I doubt -- the &quot;conservatives&quot; to whom
Mill was referring were the advocates of state (Crown) control of
economic and civil life.  It was the liberals who advocated
deregulation and personal liberty.  In other words, the exact opposite
of the past 80 years.
