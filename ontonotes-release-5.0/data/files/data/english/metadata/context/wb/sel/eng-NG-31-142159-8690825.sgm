Movie star Carrey pleads for Myanmar's Suu Kyi in YouTube
Tue Aug 28, 19:54 PM ET

WASHINGTON (AFP) - Hollywood actor Jim Carrey posted a message in the
video-sharing website YouTube on Tuesday urging Americans to join a
global campaign for the freedom of Myanmar's democracy icon Aung San
Suu Kyi.

&quot;I want to tell you about a hero of mine, her name is Aung San Suu
Kyi. She is a champion of human rights and decency in Asia and of
similar hope to all struggling people,&quot; said the comedy star.

The message came as pro-democracy supporters expanded their protests
against Myanmar's military junta this week, defying a clampdown on
dissent and staging a rare series of demonstrations against a
staggering increase in fuel prices.

The almost daily protests mark the most sustained demonstrations
against the military regime in at least nine years.

The military, which has ruled Myanmar for 45 years, maintains complete
control over the nation's media and deals harshly with dissent.

Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi has spent most of the last 17 years
under house arrest. She helped lead the National League for Democracy
to a landslide victory in 1990 elections, but the military has never
recognised the results.

&quot;Even though she won 82 percent of the parliamentary seats in the
country, she was locked away by the military regime and has been held
for 11 years under house arrest,&quot; Carrey said in his message.

He called Aung San Suu Kyi an &quot;unsung hero&quot; who &quot;has been compared to
Gandhi and Nelson Mandela.&quot;

He also taught viewers how to pronounce Aung San Suu Kyi's name,
explaining how he first learned the pronunciation, and appealed to
them to join a global effort coordinated by two groups, the Human
Rights Action Center and US Campaign for Burma, to free her and
support human rights in Myanmar.

Protests spread around Myanmar
by Hla Hla Htay
Tue Aug 28, 9:32 AM ET

YANGON (AFP) - Pro-democracy supporters expanded their protests
against Myanmar's military Tuesday, marching through the streets of
the port town of Sittwe while attempting to rally in the main city
Yangon.

Protesters have for the last 10 days defied a clampdown on dissent by
Myanmar's military regime and staged a rare series of demonstrations
against a staggering increase in fuel prices.

For the first time Tuesday, Buddhist monks were seen joining a protest
in Sittwe, about 500 kilometres (310 miles) northwest of Yangon.

Monks are important standard-bearers in this devoutly Buddhist
country. Their participation was credited with helping to bring
popular support to a pro-democracy uprising in 1988.

&quot;I saw hundreds of people, including monks, protesting this
afternoon,&quot; one resident told AFP.

&quot;Authorities rode on motorcycles alongside them, but I don't know what
happened&quot; to the protesters, he added.

Meanwhile, activists said up to 20 people were arrested after the
rally in Yangon, where about 50 activists had gathered near a bus stop
close to the former campus of Yangon University on the north side of
the city.

They chanted &quot;Lower fuel prices, lower commodity prices!&quot; as they
walked along a main road, while about 200 people gathered to watch.

The march was led by Su Su Nway, a labour activist sent to prison in
October 2005 for more than seven months after reporting cases of
forced labour to the United Nations.

Some witnesses said she was among those hauled off by security forces,
but she told AFP that she managed to escape during the confusion that
came as authorities broke up the protest.

&quot;We were just trying to express ourselves peacefully,&quot; she said.

&quot;We will solve the problem by standing for the people. I will continue
whether the authorities arrest me or not. I will face up to them,&quot; she
added.

Su Su Nway is a member of the opposition National League for Democracy
(NLD), but party officials said they had no details on the arrests.

The almost daily protests mark the most sustained demonstrations
against the military regime in at least nine years.

The military, which has ruled Myanmar for 45 years, maintains complete
control over the nation's media and deals harshly with dissent.

But the junta sparked public anger when the government secretly hiked
key fuel prices by as much as five-fold on August 15.

That immediately doubled the cost of transport, which left many people
unable to even afford the bus fare to get to work.

State media said 56 people had been arrested last week over the
protests, but Thailand-based political dissidents on Monday said it
was at least 100.

Among those held last week was Min Ko Naing, who is considered
Myanmar's most prominent pro-democracy advocate after detained
opposition leader and Nobel peace laureate Aung San Suu Kyi.

Min Ko Naing was arrested along with 12 activists who are now being
interrogated in the notorious Insein prison, where international
rights groups say torture and ill-treatment is common.

Most of them have already spent more than a decade in prison. The 13
were members of the pro-democracy 88 Generation Students group, which
is made up of former student leaders who led an uprising against
military rule in 1988.

That uprising, which initially began as a protest over Myanmar's harsh
economic conditions, ended with soldiers firing into a crowd of
students, killing hundreds if not thousands.

The uprising led to the creation of the NLD, headed by Aung San Suu
Kyi. The party won a landslide victory in 1990 elections, but the
junta never recognised the result.

Hundreds Protest Against Jump in Fuel Prices in Coastal Burma Town
Tue Aug 28, 7:42 AM ET

YANGON (AFP) - Hundreds of people, including Buddhist monks, protested
Tuesday against a huge jump in fuel prices in the coastal Myanmar
[Burma] town of Sittwe, residents told AFP by telephone.

The protest marked the first time that Buddhist monks have been seen
in the demonstrations that have erupted around Myanmar over the last
10 days.

Monks are important standard-bearers in this devoutly Buddhist
country.Their participation was credited with helping to bring popular
support to a pro-democracy uprising in 1988.

&quot;I saw hundreds of people, including monks, protesting this
afternoon,&quot; one resident told AFP.

&quot;Authorities rode on motorcycles alongside them, but I don't know what
happened to them,&quot; he added.

Sittwe, located about 500 kilometres (310 miles) northwest of Yangon,
is an important port town as well as a holiday spot for wealthy people
in Myanmar looking for a beach escape.

Pro-democracy supporters have defied official threats and a clampdown
on dissent to stage small rallies against the surprise fuel price
increase on August 15 that doubled transport costs overnight.

Most of the protests have centred on Yangon, but a handful of
provincial towns have also seen people taking to the streets against
the military, which has ruled this country with an iron fist for the
last 45 years.

EU condemns detention of Burmese protesters
Tue Aug 28, 14:17 PM ET

BRUSSELS (AFP) - The European Union on Tuesday condemned Myanmar's
detention of opposition protesters and called for their immediate
release.

&quot;The European Union condemns this decision to detain individuals who
were exercising their basic right to peaceful demonstration,&quot; the EU's
Portuguese presidency said in a statement.

Dozens of pro-democracy supporters were detained Tuesday after a top
labour activist tried to launch a new protest in Yangon against a
sharp rise in fuel prices, witnesses in the Burmese capital said.

The protest was the latest in a series of bold demonstrations against
the military junta, which for 45 years has ruled impoverished Myanmar
with an iron fist and kept a tight lid on dissent.

The European Union called for the immediate release of opposition
leader Aung San Suu Kyi and other political prisoners &quot;in particular
those arrested in the last few days, and to engage with all different
components of the society of Burma/Myanmar in the sort of open and
inclusive dialogue which is indispensable to long-awaited political
reforms,&quot; the EU presidency statement said.

50 arrested after new protest in Myanmar
Mon Aug 27, 2:42 AM ET

YANGON (AFP) - About 50 pro-democracy activists in Myanmar were
arrested Monday in a town outside Yangon, after they staged a new
protest against a massive hike in fuel prices, witnesses said.

The activists marched in silence from a market in Bago, a town about
75 kilometres (45 miles) northeast of Yangon, witnesses told AFP by
telephone.

They did not chant slogans or wave banners, and after about 30 minutes
the entire group was arrested and taken to local authorities for
questioning, witnesses said.

The march came after a week of sustained protests, mainly in Yangon,
against a fuel price hike on August 15 that saw transport costs double
overnight.

Plain-clothes security forces have been deployed across Yangon to try
to quell the protests, leaving the nation's economic hub shrouded in
fear.

State media said that 56 people had been arrested over last week's
protests, but Thailand-based political dissidents on Monday said that
number was at least 100.

Among those arrested last week was Min Ko Naing, who is considered
Myanmar's most prominent pro-democracy leader after detained
opposition leader and Nobel peace laureate Aung San Suu Kyi.

Min Ko Naing was arrested along with 12 activists for leading about
500 protesters in a peaceful march in Yangon on August 19 -- the
biggest anti-government rally here in at least nine years.

They were sent to Myanmar's notorious Insein prison in northern
Yangon, where international rights groups have alleged abuse and
torture are rampant.

Myanmar's state media has said only that authorities were
interrogating Min Ko Naing and the 12 others and that the junta would
take legal action against them.

The 13 were members of the pro-democracy 88 Generation Students group,
which is made up of former student leaders who led an uprising against
military rule in 1988.

That uprising, which initially began as a protest over Myanmar's harsh
economic conditions, ended with soldiers firing into a crowd of
students, killing hundreds if not thousands.

New Myanmar protest quashed in minutes
Tue Aug 28, 6:04 PM ET

YANGON, Myanmar (AP) - Demonstrators on Tuesday tried to mount a new
protest against rising prices, but marched only 30 yards before being
beaten and wrestled into waiting trucks by civilians who back
Myanmar's military government, witnesses said.

The two dozen protesters shouted slogans against a big fuel price hike
and implored onlookers to join them, stressing they were marching
peacefully for their rights, said witnesses, who asked not to be
quoted by name for fear of reprisals from the regime.

The marchers were quickly set upon by pro-government toughs, who
pummeled demonstrators with fists while dragging them into trucks, the
witnesses said. At least one protester was reportedly dragged by his
feet.

A prominent labor activist and former political prisoner, Su Su Nway,
took part in the protest, but said she managed to escape in a taxi
with several colleagues.

&quot;Peaceful protests are brutally cracked down upon and I want to tell
the international community that there is no rule of law in Myanmar,&quot;
she told The Associated Press.

More than a dozen of the country's leading democracy activists,
members of the 88 Generation Students group, were detained Aug. 21
before a similar demonstration.

Myanmar activists in exile claimed 200-300 people, including many
Buddhist monks, took part in another protest Tuesday in Sittwe, the
capital of Rakhine State in western Myanmar.

A report on the Web site of the Democratic Voice of Burma, an
opposition shortwave radio station based in Norway, said witnesses
reported the protest lasted for at least an hour without interference.

Protests triggered by fuel price hikes began Aug. 19 and have
continued on an almost daily basis despite a security clampdown by the
military government supported by organized bands of civilian toughs
serving as law enforcers.

Myanmar's ruling junta, which has received widespread international
criticism for violating the human rights of its citizens, tolerates
little public dissent.

Civilian thugs doing Myanmar junta's dirty work
By Ed Cropley
August 28 10:04 am

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Rather than stir up memories of their bloody 1988
crackdown by putting troops on the streets, Myanmar's junta is relying
on gangs of paid thugs and criminals armed with brooms and spades to
crush a rare outbreak of dissent.

Accurately predicting public anger at this month's shock fuel price
rises, the rulers of the former Burma released hundreds -- maybe
thousands -- of prisoners to clear the decks for mass arrests,
diplomats and exiled dissidents said on Tuesday.

Happily for the generals, those booted out of Yangon's fetid cells
also made perfect recruits for the shadowy Swan Aah Shin, or &quot;capable
strong person&quot;, organisation which has emerged as the junta's main
weapon against protesters.

&quot;It's an underground organisation and I don't know who would admit to
it existing, but it exists and it exists in force, and it has been
evident over the last week,&quot; said one diplomat who watched the Swan
Aah Shin in action on the streets of Yangon.

A Reuters reporter at the scene of what was probably a Swan Aah Shin
gang detaining 30 members of the opposition National League for
Democracy (NLD) last week was ordered not to take photographs and then
chased away.

&quot;Basically, they are junta-backed thugs. They come from anywhere, and
are the unemployed underclass. And they've been really effective --
they are threatening,&quot; the diplomat said.

&quot;Everywhere you go, there are groups and truckloads of grubby-looking
men looking bored and looking for a fight.&quot;

In 1988, by contrast, the junta sent in the troops to crush a
nationwide uprising of students, monks and civil servants. As many as
3,000 are thought to have been killed in a bloodbath still etched deep
in people's memories.

POLITICAL PARTY

A Home (Interior) Ministry source said the Swan Aah Shin took orders
from the junta's feared Union Solidarity and Development Association
(USDA), a social network claiming official membership of 23 million --
or nearly half the population.

Whereas the Swan Aah Shin operate mainly in Yangon, a city of 5
million people, the USDA and its network of activists and informants
are the generals' eyes and ears in the provinces, analysts say.

The pictures in state media of USDA officials doing daily good deeds,
and its stated aim to &quot;uplift the morale and morality of the entire
nation&quot;, lead many to think it is being groomed as the army's
political party should elections ever be held.

The junta allowed elections in 1990 in a bid to shore up its authority
after the 1988 uprising, but the plan backfired when the NLD won a
massive landslide under the leadership of Aung San Suu Kyi, daughter
of independence hero Aung San.

The generals ignored the results, and Suu Kyi -- subsequently awarded
the Nobel peace prize -- has spent most of the last 17 years in jail
or under house arrest.

Amid international criticism of the latest crackdown, in which about
60 people have been detained, human rights groups have singled out the
use of civilian militias as evidence of a more sophisticated approach
to stifling dissent.

The Democratic Voice of Burma, a dissident news service based in
Norway, played dramatic secretly filmed footage of a gang dragging
away social activist Htin Kyaw and a colleague after their attempt to
stage a protest at a bus stop.

&quot;Had the authorities wished, they could have sent uniformed police
officers to make an arrest,&quot; the Asian Human Rights Commission said of
the footage.

Instead, they chose to order an unknown gang to &quot;grab and drag off
their quarry in the manner of criminals&quot;, the Hong Kong-based group
added.

Burmese junta keeps Myanmar's Shan in state of fear

KYAING TONG, Myanmar (Reuters) - At night, the gilded Buddha standing
imperiously on a hill overlooking Kyaing Tong is one of the few spots
of light in the inky blackness of eastern Myanmar's Shan hills.

But to the Shan, the former Burma's largest ethnic minority, the
floodlit statue is no symbol of religious devotion.

It is a monument to their subjugation by the Burmese, leaders of the
junta that has controlled Myanmar and its complex patchwork of 100 or
more different ethnic groups for the last 45 years.

The Shan, many of whom are Christian, believe that when the Burmese
military built the statue in 2000, they even stuffed it with bad luck
charms to cast the evil eye on the town, a seat of distinct Shan
culture in the heart of the &quot;Golden Triangle&quot;.

&quot;They say it's women's underwear, but I don't know for sure,&quot; one man
said after a glance over his shoulder for Military Intelligence spies,
the feared network that helped crush last week's protests in Yangon,
1,000 km (620 miles) to the southwest.

Elsewhere across the sleepy town of 30,000, the garrisons of soldiers,
some with Nazi-style swastikas on their helmets, are merely the most
obvious signs of the military occupation of Shan State, a forested
plateau 1.5 times the size of Ireland.

Although 70 percent of residents are Shan, all government officials
and police are from the Burmese majority or other ethnic groups
drafted in as part of a deliberate strategy of &quot;divide and rule&quot;.

Ironically, the Shan, who have closer ethnic and linguistic links to
Thailand than the rest of Myanmar, call themselves &quot;Tai&quot;, meaning
&quot;free&quot;.

&quot;Everybody in Myanmar is under arrest, although some are under more
arrest than others,&quot; said one resident of Kyaing Tong, known as Keng
Tung during the British colonial days that ended with Burma's
independence in 1948.

The junta that seized power in 1962 changed the country's name to
Myanmar in 1989.

Since the army tore down Kyaing Tong's teak-and-stucco Shan palace two
years later to make way for a gloomy government hotel, stories have
taken root about a golden age under the Shan chieftains, or Saophas,
whose descendants now all live in exile.

&quot;My grandfather and father were always talking about the old days,
when you could leave your door open at night and nobody came in to
steal,&quot; one man said, pulling a grainy black-and-white photograph of
the destroyed palace from his wallet.

&quot;LIKE THE CROW&quot;

As the sun sets and darkness descends on a town that rarely has
electricity, people huddle around ancient radio sets to tune in to
Burmese-language broadcasts on the BBC or Radio Free Asia, funded by
the U.S. government.

The junta-controlled state media are disregarded.

&quot;Myanmar radio is just pop singers and lies,&quot; one man said.

Years of living under an Orwellian dictatorship that shows no signs of
growing old have cowed the country's 53 million people into a
perpetual state of fear, particularly in the mountainous and rebellion-
racked ethnic border regions.

&quot;People here are like the crow -- always looking over their shoulders
for signs of trouble,&quot; the man added.

Freedom of movement is non-existent under loathed internal security
laws that force people to register with 'immigration' officials
whenever they travel from one town to another.

The 150 km journey from Kyaing Tong to the Thai border, through jungle-
clad hills still hiding various rebel militias and opium fields, has
no fewer than 10 checkpoints.

In the rare instances of the government spending money on its people
-- the health budget amounts to just a few dollars per person per year
-- it fails to get the credit because distrust of its motives is so
ingrained.

One Shan development agency that receives $10,000 of junta cash a year
to bring fresh water to remote hill-tribe villages has to disguise the
source of the aid for it to be accepted.

&quot;Every time the government does something, people always think it is
to oppress them,&quot; said one Kyaing Tong resident who visits hill
communities regularly.

WHAT HOPE LEFT?

Millions from both the ethnic minorities and Burmese are voting with
their feet and leaving a country regarded in the 1950s as one of the
brightest prospects in Asia, but now one of its most desperate basket
cases.

Besides long-term refugee camps in Thailand and Bangladesh for 150,000
people displaced by decades-long civil wars with ethnic rebels,
including the Shan, millions more are working as migrants in Thailand
or more affluent parts of southeast Asia.

Those who remain behind cling to faint hopes that a new constitution
due in September as part of the junta's &quot;roadmap to democracy&quot; might
bring minorities some minimal say in how they are governed.

The signs are not good.

In Kyaing Tong, the offices of the Shan Nationalities League for
Democracy have been deserted since 2005 when party leader Hkun Htun Oo
was jailed for more than 100 years for sedition.

The Shan, Chin and Kachin also recall the last deal they struck with
the Burmese -- the 1947 Panglong Agreement that was meant to guarantee
minorities some form of representation.

&quot;It only lasted for 10 years before the Burmese broke the promise,&quot;
one man said. &quot;We all know the Panlong Agreement, but only in our
hearts. It's too dangerous to do more than that.&quot;

S.E. Asian nations concerned over Myanmar unrest
By Clarence Fernandez
Tuesday, August 28 09:46 am

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - The Association of Southeast Asian Nations
(ASEAN) voiced concern over unrest in Myanmar on Tuesday, its first
comments after soaring fuel prices prompted rare public protests in
the military-ruled nation.

But ASEAN, several of whose 10 members consider the excesses of
Myanmar's military regime to have cast all of Southeast Asia in a bad
light, will stop short of sending an envoy to Yangon to express its
concern, Secretary-General Ong Keng Yong said.

&quot;What we have done is to make our views known in a certain way, maybe
it is not the high-profile way where we send a special envoy to go to
Yangon, or to the new capital, to make a case,&quot; he told reporters in
the Malaysian capital.

&quot;But we have learnt through the last 10 years the way to work with
Myanmar is to present a logical and good ASEAN position and they will
find a way to answer our queries.&quot;

Myanmar's military government said on Monday it was forced to increase
fuel prices this month because it could not afford the growing cost of
subsidies. Diesel prices were doubled overnight and the cost of
compressed natural gas surged five-fold.

Last week, Myanmar authorities arrested around 30 members of the
country's main opposition party, the National League for Democracy,
during protests over the price hikes, as well as 13 leading
dissidents.

U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Louise Arbour has criticised
the arrests, urging Myanmar authorities to immediately release the
detainees and hold talks with demonstrators.

Ong warned against overreacting to the wave of arrests, however.
&quot;Immediately after the protests, the presumption is there is no wrong
done by protesters, but there is all the evil-doing by the Myanmar
government. Is that a fair assumption?&quot; he said.

Debbie Stothard, spokeswoman of the Alternative ASEAN Network on
Burma, a group campaigning against Myanmar's membership, said the
arrests were not legal, with detainees being denied trial, legal
assistance and access to their families.

&quot;In any ASEAN capital, increasing the price of fuel by 500 percent
would invite sustained riots, whether it's Kuala Lumpur, Jakarta or
Bangkok,&quot; Stothard told Reuters.

&quot;ASEAN at the very least should publicly express concern over the
recent developments and call for political dialogue to resolve this
latest crisis,&quot; she added.

Protests spread to the oil-producing northwest on Tuesday, where 300
people, including Buddhist monks, staged a protest march in Sittwe, a
local source said.

ASEAN admitted Myanmar to its fold 10 years ago and maintains that
keeping the nation engaged will lead to some change, but is getting
restive to see the country move towards democracy.

The grouping's ministers last month urged Myanmar to restore democracy
and release political detainees, including Nobel laureate Aung San Suu
Kyi.

An estimated 1,100 political prisoners are believed to be behind bars
in the former Burma. Suu Kyi, 62, has now been confined for more than
11 of the past 17 years. Her latest detention began in 2003.

The Star - Tuesday August 28, 2007
UN warns fuel price hikes could worsen Myanmar's economic situation

YANGON, Myanmar (AP): The United Nations warned that fuel price hikes
in Myanmar could worsen the dire economic situation for many people in
the military-ruled country, as dozens of pro-democracy activists
resumed defiant protests against the increase.

Witnesses said about 50 people, wearing white, marched Monday in the
bustling township of Bago, some 80 kilometers (50 miles) north of the
country's commercial center, Yangon.

Demonstrators shouted slogans calling for lower consumer prices, as
plainclothes police watched from a distance, witnesses said.

The demonstrators dispersed after about half an hour, they said.

Earlier this month, the military junta increased fuel prices by as
much as 500 percent, by slashing subsidies that had kept domestic oil
prices low for years. The new prices caused public transport fees to
soar -- although some have since been rolled back -- and subsequently
triggered increases for some basic commodities.

Charles Petrie, the U.N. humanitarian chief in Myanmar, said the price
hike will hit most Myanmar families hard, since almost 90 percent live
below or near the poverty line, which he defined as living on US$1
(euro.73) a day.

&quot;It's going to make things more expensive and make it more difficult
for people to survive,'' Petrie told The Associated Press. Petrie also
said the fact the increase was imposed at once, rather than in phases,
showed the regime was &quot;out of touch'' with the average citizen.

&quot;It's a policy that has been applied in a Draconian matter that
doesn't take into account the fact that people lack the reserves
necessary to absorb such shocks,'' he said.

The price hike triggered a number of small, peaceful protests last
week, mainly in Yangon. Police detained at least 65 activists,
including several leaders of Myanmar's pro-democracy movement.

Myanmar's ambassador to the Philippines, Thang Tun, told The
Associated Press on Sunday that Myanmar could no longer afford to pay
out heavy fuel subsides due to steep oil prices worldwide.

Some analysts said the measure could be a prelude to privatization, or
that it may even reflect conflict within the junta -- and could be a
deliberate attempt to provoke unrest, further stalling the approval of
a long-awaited constitution.

Myanmar's ruling junta has been widely criticized for human rights
violations, including the extended detention of Nobel laureat Aung San
Suu Kyi and more than 1,200 other political prisoners.

Economic dissatisfaction sparked the country's last major upheaval in
1988, when mass demonstrations broke out seeking an end to the
military rule that began in 1962.

The army violently subdued those protests. Hundreds, perhaps
thousands, of people were killed.

The current protests are nowhere near the scale of those in 1988.

The military rulers held a general election in 1990, but refused to
honor the results when the National League for Democracy won in a
landslide.

Myanmar, India finalising river transportation project
By IANS
Tuesday August 28, 10:51 PM

Yangon, Aug 28 (Xinhua) Myanmar and India are in the process of
finalising a river transportation project mooted during former Indian
president A.P.J. Abdul Kalam's state visit in March last year, local
media reported Tuesday.

The Kaladam multi-modal river transportation project, which also
involves the building of the Paletwa border road, will involve India
extending a US $10 million line of credit.

The Kaladam project will cover upgrading of waterways along the
Kaladam River and Sittway port in Western Myanmar's Rakhine state, the
Flower News said.

Once the project is formally endorsed by both sides, it will start
implementation, the report said.

Besides, the project will also cover upgrading of both motor roads and
waterways in those parts in northwestern Chin state to enable Indian
cargo vessels along the Kaladam river in Sittway's eastern bank to
berth at Paletwa where a high-standard port is to be built through
which a highway will also be built to enable access to the border area
of Myeikwa in the state for commodity flow to India's Mizoram state,
the report added.

Meanwhile, proposed by India, Myanmar is also making a feasibility
study to build a deep-sea port in the country's southern coastal
Tanintharyi division to facilitate maritime trade with neighbouring
countries.

The prospective Dawei deep-sea port project stands one of the
priorities among future programs of the seven-member Bay of Bengal
Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation
(BIMSTEC) which now comprises Bangladesh, India, Myanmar, Sri Lanka,
Thailand, Bhutan and Nepal.

Moreover, Myanmar is also conducting survey to build still another
deep-sea port on the Maday Island in Kyaukphyu, western coastal
Rakhine state, to serve as a transit trade centre for goods destined
to port cities of Chittagong, Yangon and Kolkata.

Relations between Myanmar and India have been growing during the past
few years with cooperation in all sectors, particularly in those of
trade and economy. The Indian statistics show that Myanmar-India
bilateral trade reached $650 million in the fiscal year 2006-07 which
ended in March, up from $557.68 million in 2005-06.

India stands as Myanmar's fourth largest trading partner after
Thailand, China and Singapore and also Myanmar's second largest export
market after Thailand, absorbing 25 percent of its total exports.

Myanmar figures also show that India's investment in Myanmar had
reached $82.57 million in four projects as of the end of 2006, out of
Myanmar's total foreign investment of $14.4 billion since late 1988.

Three Pagodas border crossing with Myanmar reopens

KANCHANABURI, Aug 28 (TNA) - The Thai-Myanmar border at Three Pagodas
Pass in this western province was reopened Tuesday after being closed
for five months.

On the border at Three Pagodas Pass, in Sangkhla Buri district, some
350 km northwest of Bangkok, authorities from Thailand and Myanmar
jointly witnessed the reopening of the border gate by a Myanmar
government official following an order by his country's government.

Traffic at the border point will be allowed exclusively for a tin
mining concessionaire to transport tin into Thailand. The company is
under contract to the Myanmar government.

Temporarily the border has been opened for three days only, between
August 28 and 30, after which it will be closed again until September
6 when nationals of both countries will be allowed to cross the
border.

Myanmar authorities sealed the border at Three Pagodas Pass for the
last five months without giving any reason.

Protesters beaten back in Myanmar
The Associated Press
Published: August 28, 2007

YANGON, Myanmar: Defiant demonstrators tried again to protest rising
consumer prices Tuesday in Myanmar's biggest city, but marched only 30
meters before being beaten and wrestled into waiting trucks by pro-
government civilians, witnesses said.

The two dozen protesters shouted slogans against a steep rise in fuel
prices and implored onlookers to join them, stressing that they were
marching peacefully for their rights, said witnesses who asked not to
be named for fear of reprisals.

Within just a few minutes, they were set upon by the pro-government
toughs, who pummeled them with punches as they dragged them away.

At least one was dragged by his feet, and witnesses said they were
tossed into the trucks like farmers handling pigs.

The protesters were mostly male but not otherwise identifiable. Of an
estimated 14 rounded up at first, two were women, the witnesses said.
Additional truckloads of tough, young, civilian law enforcers then
arrived to hunt down those who escaped, detaining at least two more.

The brief protest took place at Yangon's Hladan Junction, where
hundreds of people attended a protest against massive fuel price
increases last Tuesday. That rally was also aborted after security
personnel attacked participants.

The protests triggered by fuel price hikes began on Aug. 19 and have
continued on an almost daily basis, despite a tough security clampdown
by the military government supported by organized bands of civilians
serving as law enforcers.

Myanmar's ruling junta, which has received widespread international
criticism for violating the human rights of its citizens, tolerates
little public dissent. It has held the opposition leader, Aung San Suu
Kyi, a Nobel Peace laureate, under house arrest for 11 years.

Hladan Junction was the site of major protests during a tumultuous
failed pro-democracy uprising in 1988 and violent anti-government
protests in 1996 and 1997. The junction is near what used to be
Rangoon University, a source of dissent.

To keep students from protesting, the campus was later moved to a
suburban area.

Dissatisfaction over the economy sparked the 1988 upheaval, which was
preceded by public protests over rising rice prices, a sudden
government declaration that made most currency invalid and other
hardships.

Those protests, which sought an end to the military rule that began in
1962, were violently subdued by the army, with thousands of people
estimated killed around the country.

The junta held a general election in 1990, but refused to honor the
results when Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy party won.

The current protests are nowhere near the scale of the 1988 events,
but are the best organized in a decade, and their continuation into a
second week - as well as their spread to several upcountry towns -
represents surprisingly sustained defiance.

But the scale of the recent protests remains small, with most ordinary
citizens reluctant to risk taking part. Many of those protesting have
been members of Aung San Suu Kyi's party.

Merdeka Expedition Achieves A First In Myanmar

TOUNGOO (Myanmar), Aug 28 (Bernama) -- The Cape Town-Kuala Lumpur
Merdeka Expedition 2007 achieved a first in Myanmar yesterday.

Malaysia's Defence Attache in Myanmar, Col Sanusi Hashim, said the
expedition's members were the first foreigners to cross the new two-
kilometre Mandalay bridge over the Irrawaddy, the longest river in
Myanmar.

&quot;The honour was given to the expedition by the local authorities of
Mandalay city. The bridge is not even open to the public yet,&quot; he told
Bernama here today.

The expedition also was granted permission to use the Moreh-Tamu land
route to enter Myanmar from India, he said, adding that many foreign
expeditions had requested for permission to use the route but so far
apart from this expedition, only one from India had been allowed to
use it last December.

Sanusi said it was not easy to get permission to use the route due to
security reasons and because of that, many expeditions had to bypass
Myanmar and use the Thailand-Laos-China route when coming from or
going to India.

&quot;The permission was given on condition the expedition left Myanmar by
sea and not across the Myanmar-Thailand border because its security
could not be guaranteed due to threats from Karen militants there.

However, after government-to government and military-to-military
discussions, Myanmar relented and will escort the convoy to the town
of Myawaddy bordering Mae-Sot in Thailand, a distance of 180
kilometres from here, tomorrow,&quot; he said.

The expedition has travelled 18,500 kilometres across 13 countries so
far and still has 3,500 kilometres to go.

It is scheduled to arrive at Dataran Merdeka in Kuala Lumpur at 4.30
pm, in time for the Merdeka eve celebrations (on Aug 30). The
expedition is being held in conjunction with Malaysia's 50th Merdeka
(Independence) anniversary.

Haggling puts Burma in no gas, no cash bind
Ed Cropley
Wednesday, August 29, 2007

The shock fuel price rises that sparked a rare series of protests in
Burma suggest the ruling junta is facing a short-term budget crunch
despite the promise of long-term riches from huge gas reserves.

As ever in Burma, any number of conspiracy theories had cropped up to
explain this month's five-fold increase in the price of compressed
natural gas and a doubling of diesel prices.

The rises brought Rangoon's bus networks to a halt and highlighted the
soaring cost of living and declining standard of living in a country
the World Bank saw as one of Asia's brightest prospects in the 1950s
and now one of its poorest.

A senior Energy Ministry official admitted on Monday the government
was simply struggling to pay for domestic diesel subsidies despite
rising revenue from sales of natural gas.

&quot;The new price does not cover what we are paying for our imports,&quot;
Energy Planning Department director Soe Myint told reporters at a
conference in Singapore.

&quot;The government just wants to relieve some of its burden on to the
customer.&quot;

The irony of an energy-rich nation - Burma has at least 2.54 trillion
cubic meters of gas reserves, the world's 10th largest, and 3.2
billion barrels of recoverable crude - being unable to supply its
people with cheap fuel was not lost on the demonstrators.

Their rare shows of dissent started only days after it emerged the
junta had decided to sell gas from the A1 and A3 blocks of its huge
offshore Shwe field through a pipeline to China, rather than India.

According to industry estimates, the two blocks could provide Burma
with an annual US$2 billion (HK$15.6 billion) or more for the next 40
years, enough to make Western sanctions on the generals who have been
in charge for the past 45 years irrelevant.

But analysts think the deal's fine print is still being thrashed out,
and so no gas - and therefore no cash - is likely to flow until at
least 2009, leaving the country reliant for now on sales to Thailand
for a big chunk of export earnings.

Gas sales to Thailand rose to US$2.2 billion in 2006 from US$1.1
billion the previous year and accounted for 43 percent of overseas
revenue, the rest being mainly for gems, timber, copper and
agricultural goods.

But even as these revenues have risen, the country of 53 million
people has had to import nearly all its diesel because of a domestic
refining sector crippled by 50 years of non-investment.

With crude around US$70 a barrel, and no means of turning their own
natural gas into something usable, the generals are struggling to make
the books balance.

Su Su Nway hospitalised after demonstration

Aug 28, 2007 (DVB)-Well-known activist and National League for
Democracy member Su Su Nway was hospitalised this afternoon after
collapsing during a protest in Rangoon's Hledan township.

Eyewitnesses said Su Su Nway was seen arguing with special police and
government supporters as they arrested more than 10 other activists
for taking part in the protest against high fuel prices. She was seen
collapsing shortly afterwards.

&quot;Su Su Nway has now been submitted to a hospital on Mahabandoola
Garden street . . . One of the people who was with her at the protest
took her in a car,&quot; an eyewitnesses said.

It is unclear why the special police chose not to arrest Su Su Nway
along with the other activists but bystanders said they saw the police
brutally beating the arrested protestors as they were driven away in a
truck.

Eyewitnesses also said that several bystanders who tried to intervene
in the arrests were also taken into custody and beaten. The protestors
were believed to also have been involved in the demonstrations along
Shwegondine road last week.

After the activists were arrested and driven away, two trucks carrying
government supporters arrived at the scene of the protest to break up
the large crowds that had gathered to watch.

88 student leader narrowly escapes raid

Aug 28, 2007 (DVB)-Wanted 88 Generation Student leader U Htay Kywe
narrowly avoided arrest last night when the Rangoon house he was
hiding in was raided by government officials.

&quot;U Htay Kywe's safe house was raided last night but he escaped,&quot; 88
Generation Students member Hla Myo Naung told DVB.

Despite giving interviews to a number of media groups in the past few
days, U Htay Kywe has consistently refused to identify his location in
Rangoon for fear he would be found by the authorities.

Several press groups ran stories yesterday claiming that U Htay Kywe
had fled to the Thai-Burma border but Hla Myo Naung told DVB this
morning that the reports were incorrect.

&quot;We have heard about these reports and the information is wrong. All
members of the 88 Generation Students group have made it clear they
will not flee the country,&quot; Hla Myo Naung said.

&quot;Some of our remaining members had a phone conversation with U Htay
Kywe just moments ago and he has not fled,&quot; Hla Myo Naung said.

U Htay Kywe is the only remaining high-level leader of the 88
Generation Students group to have avoided arrest in the past week.
