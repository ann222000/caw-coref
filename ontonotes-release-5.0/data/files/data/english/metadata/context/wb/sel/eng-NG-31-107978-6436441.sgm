profiling
the career of Shaquille O'Neal from his high school playing days at Robert
Cole High School, to his college play at Louisiana State University and on
to stardom with the Orlando Magic of the NBA.
Front Jacket Excerpt:
"He is tooday's most popular athlete, and his "Shaq Attack" style of
slam-dunking play terrorizes the NBA. He is Shaquille O'Neal of the Orlando
Magic, and he is more than lived up to the hype that heralded his arrival
in the NBA in the 1992-93 season. The NBA Rookie of the Year and the first
rookie to play in the All-Star Game since Michael Jordan in 1984, Shaq took
the league by storm, shattering records (he already holds all major scoring
and rebounding records for the Magic...) An icon of the 1990's, Shaquille
O'Neal is truly a legend in the making."
