long term care insurance?

about a decade ago, when i was first diagnosed and around 46 years
old, i tried to get long term insurance and wasn't able to. now AARP
is offering LT insurance through Genworth. RA is not an automatic rule-
out, as it was when i tried to get it before. my parents had lt care
insurance which really made a difference when they needed a nursing
home, and if my sister had it, she wouldn't be zipping through her
savings to pay for her 24 hour aide. but i'm wondering if i'm
overlooking something. it would be about 180$ a month (if they accept
me), which is a chunk o' change, but with my family's experience and
my RA, it seems worth the money. the policy i'm considering pays about
80% with a three year minimum's worth of coverage.

Also, if more than one family member gets it, there's a 40% discount.

I don't understand three year minimum.  Three year maximum maybe?

Also do they pay 80% of your total cost, ie room and board, or 80% of some
predetermined but inadequate amount.

What care level would you need to qualify for benefits?  How would that be
determined?

$180 x 12 x 20 = a reasonable guess of what you would pay them before you
need them.   Or $43,200.  Your mileage of course may vary.

As I've told my broker, this would all be a lot easier to plan if only I
knew when we were going to die.  Sorry but accountants can be both pretty
grim and pretty literal.

Diane, I don't have RA, just OA, but I have been turned down by three
companies.  I did not have my heart or lung problems then either.  Grayson
and I applied at the same time.  They approved him on the first application,
and turned me down!

jo these are helpful questions and i don't yet know the answers
(haven't actually seen the policy yet). although i do know that 80% is
based on the supposed nc average nursing home monthly figure of 4700.
the policy would pay 3700 of that. there are more comprehensive
policies, but of course they cost more money.

that 3 year minimum is confusing, but i believe what it means is that
they will pay for at least three years of care, whether 3 consecutive
years or divided up.

as for qualifying, you have to need help with 2 of the &quot;basic care&quot;
thingamobobs, like dressing and bathing. i don't know who makes that
determination.

that 43K is a heartstopper, isn't it? but i guess that's what
insurance is all about. i'll talk to my financial planner and see what
she thinks.

gwen, sorry you were turned down just for OA! but just think of all
the premiums you've saved.

This is where it sticks for me.  Wouldn't it be &quot;at most&quot; rather than &quot;at
least&quot;?

Granted three years is quite a bit.

Diane, you're right.  I hadn't thought of that!  But feel sorry for the kids
if I have to go to a nursing home!

Diane:

I bought LTC insurance through Genworth about 3 years ago. (AARP had another
carrier at the time. I studied a bunch of policies/carriers out there and
the policy I got through Genworth was the best by far. Now, I'm not sure you
got the same policy, so do some studying and read the fine print-- there are
many things to watch out for or look for).

The premiums have not increased. I was not dx. with RA at the time. I
currently have some kind of inflammatory arthritis in both knees.

Anyway, I forgot the technical term but we basically got a joint policy. It
covers 3 years at $3000/month for either my wife or myself. I am currently
61 and my wife is 5 years younger. Our policy cost is about $840/year. Not
cheap, but not bad. That premium has not gone up either

Mel, i think you got a good deal. i still haven't seen the genworth
policy, but the premiums for $3K/month worth of coverage are $183/
month for me alone (i'm 57). we live in NC and i suppose the premiums
vary by state as well as the coverage.  if john also gets it, there's
a 40% reduction in both our rates. from what i've heard from friends,
these rates are pretty good, but yours sounds excellent.
it's that dicey &quot;do i really need it?&quot; kind of thinking that can make
me crazy. so hard to imagine needing it when i'm 57. at the same time,
i hobble around like Grandpappy Amos so who knows what i'll be like at
77? (if you know who grandpappy amos is, you're as old as I am).

Diane:

That premium seems awful high, but obviously they are factoring in your RA.

When I got my policy, I was able to answer NO to their big questions (I did
not have a RA dx. or MS or any of a bunch of things).

So, at least you are able to get the policy, but at a huge cost. If you can
afford it, then I guess you have a tough decision to make.

But, as I said, we examined many policies and Genworth was BY FAR the best.

Good luck.

I have a policy from Allianz that I took out in 1996 - I was 56 or 57.  My
premiums are $91.06, never to increase.  There is a built in COLA increase
each year in the benefits (cost of living).  I can't list the benefits right
now, but they were quite good.  I think I even listed my OA and RA.  I never
receive any advertising from them on other policies they may handle.  I
don't think the rates are bad at all, compared to some that I am seeing
here.
I feel better knowing I have it.

Sounds like the premium is not too outlandish.
But again you need to examine the policy.

I wish I could remember but I had about 6 major points to look at/question.

One of the major ones was who decides that you need say nursing home care??
Some insurances require their own doctor to approve that. That's a BIG red
flag. The one I have my own doctor decides.

Another thing to look at is what they would pay for in-home care, if
anything. There were quite a few other things.

Oh, yeah, there was also the type of facilities that qualify. Also, is there
a deductible. If so, how much?
