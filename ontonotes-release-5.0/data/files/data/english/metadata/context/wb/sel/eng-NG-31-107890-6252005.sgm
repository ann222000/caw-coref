¡Hola Juan!  ¿Como estás?

Your upside down question mark is &lt;alt&gt;0191 (hold down the alt key while
entering the digits).  For that upside down exclamation point it's
&lt;alt&gt;0161.  This works in WIndoze, I can't vouch for other OS'es.

Yes, many do. You just have to know where to look...it's semi-hidden.

Look at the M, &gt;, /, J, K, L, ; , U, I, O, P, 7, 8, 9, and 0 keys on an
average laptop. These should have numbers and operators printed on them.
That's your numeric keypad. You should be able to turn it on with Num Lock.
Most laptops have used this arrangement (or one that's very similar) for
many years now.

When you get it turned on, it too will work with the ALT+xxxx keycodes:

Go find an IBM Model M. This is *the* keyboard. The only other thing that
comes close is a Northgate OmniKey ultra. They're not to everyone's liking,
but you'll find the build quality and weight hard to argue with. Plus, they
are cheap. Most have PS/2 cables attached, and some came with a ten footer.
Nice when the computer's on the floor.

With a 7/32" deep socket nut driver, a dishwasher and some time taken to
remove the keycaps you can have one that looks brand new. Not a lot of
keyboards will let you do that. (Just be careful if you find a grey cased
one--they are made of a soft thermoplastic that melts at the very sight of
heat!)

Actually, I think I have two and an Aptiva keyboard! Then I have more,
mostly the ones with the old window logo next to ALT. The newer boards
sometimes have pretty lousy rear legs that aren't swapable with other

&gt; Hi!

&gt; &gt; You can almost find them free. Biggest problem is 45% of them are
&gt; &gt; from a 286 and have a fullsize AT-type plug.Go find an IBM Model M. This is *the* keyboard. The only other thing that
&gt; comes close is a Northgate OmniKey ultra. They're not to everyone's liking,
&gt; but you'll find the build quality and weight hard to argue with. Plus, they
&gt; are cheap. Most have PS/2 cables attached, and some came with a ten footer.
&gt; Nice when the computer's on the floor.

&gt; With a 7/32&quot; deep socket nut driver, a dishwasher and some time taken to
&gt; remove the keycaps you can have one that looks brand new. Not a lot of
&gt; keyboards will let you do that. (Just be careful if you find a grey cased
&gt; one--they are made of a soft thermoplastic that melts at the very sight of
&gt; heat!)
">

PS William the lightweight board tend to have keys that pop off either
with a screwdriver or fingers and yes, it's a horror film in there and
you learn where all your hair went. Usually it doesn't have to go past
cleanup.

Got two of those, had 'em for years, they live on the shop computers.  You
are right, sir!  Those are the best keyboards ever made.

For those who use alternate keyboard layouts, like DSK, you can even move
the keycaps around.

&gt;I knew that, but on a Toshiba Satellite running Linux, you have to make a

&gt;package (gucharmap 1.4.1) that has way more capability than I'll ever need.

With a stock Xterm you can just hold down meta (usually, but not
always, ALT) and type away.  Works under IRIX that I'm typing from
right now, anyway.  Curiously, neither the gnome terminals or Eterms
that are also sharing my desktop behave this way.

3270 display stations.  Oh, baby.  You could kill someone with one
of those welded steel monsters.  I always figured they were a direct
descendant of the Selectric line.

That said, I hasten to add I'm no expert on keyboards.  My two-finger
pecking is so primitive as to be beyond the aid of technology.

Tim, are you running Linux or (it wouldn't surprise me) a version of Unix in terminal
(?)mode? My knowledge of both is limited, please understand, but it sounds like you
are running Unix with some Linux processes tacked on for fun.

At work we use SGI a lot, so my desktop here is a kicked-to-the-curb
O2, although most of my processes are running on a headless Origin 350.
These are the machines running IRIX, SGI's brand of unix.

At home I have a dual-proc Sun Ultra 60 running Solaris, which is
Sun's brand of unix and probably the most stable OS in the universe.
Mostly I use Gnome2 for a desktop, and because I've become accustomed
to certain gtk based tools I've dragged some of it onto the IRIX boxen
at work.  I've gotten kinda attached to transparent xterm's. :)  The
later gnome terminals even support fully variable opacity.

And, yeah, I mostly live in the shell.  Can't stand all that clicking
and pointing.  Slows me down.

The strength -- and the weakness -- of Linux is the mobs of people
developing for it.  Because of this certain packages do indeed show
up on that platform first.  The GNU stuff predates Linux, however,
and Gnome was, AFAIK, built on an outgrowth of the gimp toolkit.

The weakness is that with the sheer mass of code pouring forth
there inevitably winds up some stuff being distributed that may not
be of the best quality.  If your paint program has a buffer overflow,
who cares?  But a driver or a loadable kernel module?  Yikes!

Newsgroups (and news _servers_) are neutral to languages, it's all
depends on the _client_ software.
For example to work correctly with Russian in your Outlook Express,
you
need just a small poece of knowledge :) -
