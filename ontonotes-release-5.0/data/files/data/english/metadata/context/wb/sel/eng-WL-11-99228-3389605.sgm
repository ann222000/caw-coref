Let me lay out a hypothetical situation for you.

*Foreigners take control of the streets in major American cities.
*They fly their national flag while disgracing the American flag.
*They hold up signs in a foreign language.
*Legislators are intimidated by these marches in American streets and it affects the legislation they are willing to propose and pass.

Couldn't possibly happen, right? Nope, not here .
