Hi All,

I've just started using emacs IDLWAVE for writing my code.  I must say
it is convenient and MUCH nicer than the UNIX DE.  Besides this I have
no experience with emacs so I don't know if it is an emacs issue or an
IDLWAVE one.  I can't seem to find why I can't indent more than one
tab in a CASE statement.  It says that &quot;The mark is not active now&quot;
after indenting once and doesn't allow me to go further.  For
readability I would like to indent one more time.  Can anyone tell me
what's going on here?

I also have another question for IDLWAVE users: Before using emacs
I've written my code with all the IDL commands in uppercase, is there
a way to have the keyboard shortcuts print in uppercase? Or is this
just wishful thinking?

Here is an example
PRO test, a, b, KEYWORD=keyword
RETURN, a*b
END

Thanks,
Ryan.

CTRL+Tab will add another tab for just this once.  Perhaps you want to
always indent the case statement twice.
You could (1) change the default indent to be more spaces. Look at
IDLWAVE-&gt;Idlwave Code Formatting-&gt;Ildwave Block Indent
or (2) change the CASE template (?)

As far as upcase/downcase: look at IDLWAVE-&gt;Idlwave Completion
