I came across a discussion of a coupon for 50% off any one item at B&amp;N
last night (link below)...you have to be a member of B&amp;N (costs $25
for one year, but the other posters say it's well worth it) and use
Mastercard for your item. BUT...it's good on any one item, including
preorders.

I tried it out, and sure enough, it works on preorders. I got the big
FORD AT FOX box that's coming out in December. Retail about $300,
Amazon price $210...and I just got it for $95 (plus the $25
membership) at B&amp;N. Here's the link...look at comment #219 for the
coupon code:

This isn't as good a deal, but it's still worth bringing up: if you
use a Discover card, you can redeem your cashback as $25 Borders gift
cards which cost you $20 in cashback.  Go to Borders.com, which is run
by Amazon (but you have to start at Borders.com), and you can use them
online.

It makes a lot easier to buy, say, the Woody Woodpecker set just to
get the early cartoons on it when it only costs you about $9 in real
money (I don't regard the cashback as real money, since I wouldn't
have it if I had a different card).

Well, actually, you could get real cash back from other cards--and more
of it.

As noted, you can get cash back here, too, but free Amazon play money
is more fun.

Can you provide a tinyurl for that B&amp;N link, please? It's broken (for
me, at least).

Hmm, that link may have changed as more posts got added to the thread.
Here's a Tiny URL link to the first page of the thread; go to post
#219 (page 9) for the coupon code.
