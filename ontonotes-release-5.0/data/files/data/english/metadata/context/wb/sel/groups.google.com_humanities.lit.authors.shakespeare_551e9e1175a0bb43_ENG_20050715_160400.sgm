Daniel's Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego

24 ...we cast THREE MEN bound into the midst of the FIRE?
They answered and said unto the king, TRUE, O king.
25: He answered and said, LO, I see four men loose,
walking in the midst of the FIRE, and they have no hurt;
and the form of THE FOURTH is like the SON of GOD.

the French king's brother (&quot;The Discoverie of a Gaping Gulf Where into

of the book were [BURNED IN THE KITCHEN STOVE] of Stationer's Hall. It

CLEAVER driven through the wrist by a mallet; before STUBBS fainted he
&quot;put off his hat with his left and said with a loud voice, 'God save the
Queen'&quot;. Camden, who witnessed this appalling scene, records that. &quot;The

You [i.e., John Shahan] never looked for names
other than those I gave you, so I'm not surprised
you missed Spenser. Here is the 22-column array:

RNITI E PROMISEDBYOVREVE
R LIVI N GPOETWISHETHTHEW

SETTI NGFORTH

Notice the 5-letter string SPENS reading down the 6th column and
the ER reading up the first. Spenser was not only well-connected
at court, he was one of the finest sonneteers of the age, as was
the well-connected-at-court Daniel, whose name is hidden
in the 9-column array:

Can it be a coincidence that the two names
Peacham added to Puttenham's list were Spenser &amp; Daniel?
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Ergo, then, it is CLEARLY NOT a coincidence!!!

Not just that he enjoyed them but that he was proud of them
and labeled them for the reader: &quot;anagramma.&quot; The alleged anagram
differs in a great many respects from Peacham's actual anagrams,
as I have demonstrated in some detail.

Funny then that the only time he ever alluded to Oxford was in a
passage plagiarized from Puttenham. Peacham never quoted a line
from Oxford's works and never mentioned any particular thing by Oxford
that he admired -- contrast this with the detail he supplies about
writers he genuinely admired, such as Sidney, Spenser, and Daniel.

&quot;In the time of our late Queene Elizabeth, which was truly a golden Age
(for such a world of refined wits, and excellent spirits it produced,
whose like are hardly to be hoped for, in any succeeding Age) above
others, who honoured Poesie with their pennes and practise (to omit her
Maiestie, who had a singular gift herein) were Edward Earle of Oxford,
the Lord Buckhurst, Henry Lord Paget; our Phoenix, the noble Sir Philip
Sidney, M. Edward Dyer, M. Edmund Spencer, M. Samuel Daniel, with
sundry others; whom (together with those admirable wits, yet liuing,
and so well knowne) not out of Ennuie but to auoid tediousnesse,
I overpasse. Thus much of Poetrie.&quot;

Why does Peacham mention Paget? He found the name in Puttenham. Why does
he refer to the Earl of Dorset as Lord Buckhurst? That is the way he
was known to Puttenham. Why does he refer to Sir Edward Dyer as M[aster]
Edward Dyer? That is the way he was known to Puttenham. Why does he
mention Oxford? He found the name in Puttenham. To my knowledge
Peacham nowhere in his works shows any more familiarity
with writings by Oxford than with those by Paget.

He knew his alphabet, and he knew that the M in MENTE was an M, that the E
was an E, and so on. There is no reason to think he had a secret anagram
in mind for MENTE VIDEBOR that he never divulged, but even if you choose
to believe that, there is no way to decide which of the hundreds of
possible anagrams that can be formed from the letters in
MENTE VIDEBOR Peacham would have come up with.

There may be a more interesting connection to Spenser. As you were the
first on this newsgroup to point out (I will give you credit, even if the
Oxfordians do not), the line &quot;Vivitur ingenio caetera mortis erunt&quot; is
considered the motto to Spenser's &quot;December&quot; eclogue. The poem in which
this line originally appeared was part of the Virgilian Appendix, and it
was in the edition of Virgil that Spenser is known to have used. While
the first Spenserian to make the connection was John Hughes in 1715, it
is tempting to think that Peacham, whose admiration for both Virgil and
Spenser was immense, may had figured this out by 1612, and used
Spenser's last motto from *The Shepheardes Calender* as
one of his title page mottoes.

&gt;&quot;By/in the Mind I Shall be Seen&quot; must mean something.
&gt; Perhaps, you have an alternative suggestion.

"/>

Let me quote part of my essay on *Minerva Britanna*:

There is no poem accompanying the title page motto &quot;MENTE VIDEBOR,&quot; but
these stanzas from a commendatory poem by William Segar explains what
it means to see in the mind (Roger Stritmatter, by the way,
also thinks Segar's poem helps teach us how to read Peacham):

Within the mind two eies there are haue sight,
To iudge of things interiour hauing sence;
Foresight, and Insight, Iudgment makes them bright,
And most perspicuous through intelligence.
Foresight, forseeth harmes, that may ensue:
Insight, doth yeild to reason what is due

With outward ei'ne first view, and marke this booke,
Variety of objects much will please;
With inward ei'ne then on the matter look.
Foresee the Authors care, and little ease
T'invent, t'imprint, and publish for delight,
And for reward but craues your good insight.

Segar's poem could almost serve as the epigram for the title page image.
Segar tells the reader not to read only with the outward eyes, but also
with the eyes of the mind, they eyes that can not only look at Peacham's
book but understand him. It is by such a reader that Peacham will be seen
in the mind. The motto thus does not conceal the identity of the one who
will be &quot;seen&quot; (for that is the author, Peacham), but instead gracefully
flatters the perspicuous reader, the one in whose mind the true seeing
(insight, judgment) will occur.

In another sense, it is Peacham's mind that the reader will come to know
by reading his book. As Peacham says,

For as in Children, easily we behold,
Some neere resemblance of the mouth, or eie:
Of Parents likenes: so our workes vnfold,
Our mindes true Image, to posteritie. (57)

Thus the astute reader is not only the one who reads not just with his
eyes but with his mind, he is also the reader who will see Peacham by
seeing Peacham's mind unfolded by his works. Peacham will be seen by his
own mind and in in the reader's mind. This double sense is also reflected
in a commendatory poem by Thomas Harding to Peacham &quot;de sua Minerva&quot; (B1r)
-- on his &quot;Minerva.&quot; Harding praises Peacham both for his book Minerva
Britanna and also for his own &quot;Minerva&quot; or wisdom. It is this Minerva, the
quality of Peacham's mind, that the astute reader of Minerva Britanna will
see: Harding describes Peacham's book as &quot;ingenii vera Minerva tui&quot; (&quot;the
true Minerva of your wit&quot;).
