LIFE Nature 2005: Commission provides € 69 million to 54 nature
conservation projects in 20 countries
*********************************************************

The European Commission has approved funding for 54 nature conservation
projects, situated in 20 Member States or acceding countries, under the
LIFE Nature programme. The projects will restore protected nature areas
and their fauna and flora, establish sustainable management structures
and strengthen public awareness and cooperation with stakeholders. They
will thus further contribute to the creation of the EU-wide Natura 2000
network of protected sites. The projects are situated in Austria,
Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary; Ireland,
Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxemburg, the Netherlands, Poland, Slovakia,
Spain, Sweden, the United Kingdom and Romania. They represent a total
investment of € 125.7 million, of which the EU will cover 69 million.

Environment Commissioner Stavros Dimas said: &quot;I am delighted to see
European funds supporting local, regional and national efforts to
conserve natural species and habitats. Having visited LIFE Nature sites
myself, I have seen the difference this dynamic collaboration can
make&quot;.

This year, the Commission received 183 proposals for funding through
the LIFE Nature programme from partnerships of various conservation
bodies, government authorities, NGOs, anglers' and hunters'
associations etc. The Commission selected 54 of those projects, 9 of
which involve 2 or more countries.

Most projects aim at conserving or restoring Natura 2000 sites or
networks of sites, designing and implementing management or action
plans, improving watercourses, restoring sites, laying the foundations
for long-term site management and eliminating invasive species. In
addition, several projects aim at breeding and releasing endangered
species into the wild or at reducing the by-catch of fishing.

2 500 projects co-financed since 1992

Natura 2000 is an EU-wide network of special areas of conservation and
protection. It was set up under the EU Habitats Directive[1] and also
incorporates sites identified under the Birds Directive[2]. Altogether,
it comprises over 18 000 sites and covers approximately 17.5% of the
territory of the 15 initial EU Member States (EU-15) - an area almost
as large as France - and is now being extended to the new Member
States.

LIFE is the EU's financial instrument supporting environmental and
nature conservation projects throughout the EU, as well as in some
candidate, acceding and neighbouring countries. Its objective is to
contribute to the development and implementation of EU environmental
policy by financing specific actions. Since 1992, LIFE has co-financed
some 2 500 projects, contributing € 1 500 million to the protection
of the environment.

LIFE Nature specifically contributes to the implementation of the Birds
and Habitats Directives and, in particular, the Natura 2000 European
Network. The two other components of this programme, LIFE Environment
and LIFE Third Countries, respectively focus on demonstrating
innovative environmental techniques and on environmental capacity
building in countries bordering the Mediterranean and the Baltic Sea.
For projects approved under LIFE Environment and LIFE Third Countries,
see press releases IP/05/1156 and IP/05/1157.

The current LIFE programme (&quot;LIFE III&quot;) finishes at the end of
2006. The Commission has proposed a new programme called &quot;LIFE +&quot;,
which would run from 2007-2013 with a budget of € 2 190 million. Its
final adoption and budget is currently pending between the Council of
Ministers and the European Parliament.

ANNEX

Overview of LIFE Nature projects 2005 by country

Austria - 2 projects

There are great bustards (Otis tarda) in three areas north and east of
Vienna. Thanks to years of efforts to protect and manage them, the
combined populations stand at about 140 birds. However, much of the
annual increase gained through habitat and nest protection work is lost
when some fly into electric power lines - 20% of the adult population
was killed in such collisions in 2003. The first project addresses this
issue by burying 43km of power lines underground and marking another
125 km with highly visible warning devices.

In Styria, in the Gesäuse national park, the second project addresses
a number of restoration activities, including removing a weir and
concrete embankments along the Enns river and its tributaries, and
reintroducing grazing in abandoned mountain pastures.

Belgium - 6 projects

The objective of a joint project between a Dutch and a Belgian
conservation NGO, along the Dommel river (provinces of Limburg,
Belgium, and Noord-Brabant, Netherlands), is to restore degraded
habitats and link up fragmented sites by acquiring and restoring some
60 hectares of land.

The second project covers three military training areas in Wallonia
(Marche-en-Famenne, Elsenborn, Camp Lagland) and will integrate
military use and nature conservation, clearing 380 ha of dry heaths and
raising the water levels in the fens and mires.

Two projects will restore bogs and wet heaths planted with spruce in
the Plateau de Tailles in the central Ardennes, and around Gedinne
(Croix Scaille) in the western Ardennes.

The lowlands along the Grote Nete river between Geel and Mol (northern
Belgium) host a variety of habitats. However, these are fragmented and
under pressure from the effects of adjacent intensive forms of land
use. This fifth Belgian LIFE-Nature project will acquire and restore 70
hectares of land to create larger, more coherent blocks.

The sixth project is a transboundary one bringing together nature park
administrations in the border area between Belgium, Luxembourg and
Germany (Rheinland-Pfalz). It will set up a programme to monitor otters
and carry out an inventory of physical bottlenecks along watercourses
used by migrating otters (e.g. busy road crossings, culverts...). Such
barriers are to be modified by the project, and the stream banks
restored.

Denmark - 3 projects

The first project seeks to restore raised bogs in over ten sites across
Denmark, mainly in Jutland. It will block ditches to stop water running
out of the bogs.

The second project targets the rare butterfly Euphydryas aurinia, which
has declined in Denmark because its grassland habitat was either no
longer being used at all by farmers and thus became overgrown, or was
being used too intensively.

Financially speaking, the third project is by far the biggest in this
year's round of LIFE-Nature projects. LIFE will contribute € 8
million out of a total budget of 15 million. This project targets a
fish from the salmon family, the houting (Coregonus oxyrhynchus ),
which is getting dangerously close to extinction. The only reasonably
viable population left in the world is found in the rivers of southwest
Jutland, from where it migrates to the Wadden Sea to spawn. Its marine
habitat is secure, but changes to the morphology of the rivers and the
semi-commercial net fishing carried out in this area have led to its
decline.

Finland - 2 projects

The 1200 hectare military training area of Vattaja, on the Gulf of
Bothnia (Ostrobothnia), hosts one of Finland's most important dune
areas. The first project will integrate Natura 2000 requirements into
the training activity, restoring damaged dunes and reintroducing
grazing of overgrown meadows and pastures. Recreational use of the area
will be tackled by channelling visitors and preventing access to the
most sensitive areas.

The lesser white-fronted goose (Anser erythropus) is highly threatened.
The second project is run by WWF Finland with 9 partners in Norway,
Estonia, Hungary and Greece. It will identify the most important
breeding areas in Lapland and secure them and will also track migrating
geese to discover any hitherto unknown foraging/staging points, as well
as restoring staging points in Estonia and safe foraging areas in
Hungary.

France- 4 projects

Three out of the four projects deal with the conservation of rare
birds. All three projects are led by NGOs such as LPO and Bretagne
Vivante. The aim is to stabilise or increase current populations and
improve the species' status. Management measures will also be
introduced.

In the eastern Corbières (Languedoc-Roussillon region), 13 bird
species are concerned

The second project targets the roseate tern (Sterna dougallii) in
Brittany.

The third is a transnational project to reinforce and conserve the
lesser kestrel populations in Aude (France) and Extremadura (Spain),
based on a French-Spanish international collaboration between NGOs.

The fourth project, also led by an NGO, deals with preservation of the
heath lands, peat lands and bats of Montselgues, in the Rhône-Alpes
region.

Germany - 7 projects

Natural flooding will be restored over a length of 10 km along the
river Lippe near Hamm (Nordrhein-Westfalen), affecting 600 hectares.

The second project targets mires and wet grasslands near Rosenheim
(Bavaria). Within an area of 1100 hectares, 450 hectares of raised bog
will be restored by damming drainage ditches and clearing overgrowth of
trees and shrubs.

In the southern Black Forest, a third project targets a variety of
habitats (Nardus grasslands, mountain hay meadows, heaths, woods and
raised bogs) in the 2000 hectare Hotzenwald.

The fourth project targets a type of habitat which is very rare in
Europe: continental salt marshes, which occur around saline springs.
The project deals with 5 continental salt marsh sub sites across the
region of Brandenburg.

A project in the Eifel hill country east of Koblenz (Rheinland-Pfalz)
focuses on Nardus grasslands and heaths. Eco-tourism will be developed
and promoted.

The sixth project targets a decommissioned military training area near
Cuxhafen, which consists of coastal dunes backed by patches of oak
interspersed with grassland habitats. The project will introduce a
range of large herbivores (Heck cattle, bisons, Konik poneys) to graze
350 hectares as a wooded pasture.

The last project is transnational and deals with coastal meadows at 34
sites around the Baltic - mainly in Denmark, but also in Sweden,
Schleswig-Holstein (Germany) and Estonia - including the island of
Saltholm, near Copenhagen, which has been managed for generations by a
cooperative of citizens from that city.

Greece - 1 project

The project focuses on conflicts between fisheries and the conservation
of the European Union's largest population of the critically
endangered Mediterranean monk seal (Monachus monachus) in Greek waters.
It is undertaken by an NGO called MOM, in close collaboration with
local fishermen.

Hungary - 2 projects

One project concerns 6 sites totalling 720 hectares, scattered along
the Danube corridor and in the southwest, all of which have various
grasslands. The purpose of the project is to elaborate suitable
agri-environment schemes for the different grassland habitat types

The other project is a transboundary project with Romania, for the
red-footed falcon (Falco vespertinus). 90% of the European population
outside Russia is covered by the project, which extends over Hungary
East of the Danube and the Satu Mare district of Romania.

Ireland - 1 project

The Republic of Ireland contains significant examples of a number of
priority European woodland habitat types. The Irish Forestry Board
proposes to restore the woodland quality at nine sites covering 560
hectares, over a period of four years. Focus will be placed on public
awareness and education.

Italy - 4 projects

Two projects are located in the Puglia region, in southern Italy: The
first one targets the Fortore river, which runs across three regions,
from the Apennine mountains to the Adriatic sea. It will draw up a
management plan for the SCI site (Site of Community Importance, in the
framework of Natura 2000). This part will be carried out by the river
basin authority - the first time in Italy that such an authority has
prepared a Natura 2000 management plan. More ecologically-minded
farming will also be promoted among local farmers. The second project
aims at protecting coastal habitats within a Natura 2000 site, Torre
Guaceto. This site contains a marine protected area which is threatened
in particular by intensive agricultural practices.

Also in southern Italy, but in the Matera province, a project concerns
the conservation of threatened birds of prey. In the cities of Matera
and Montescaglioso, the nesting sites located on the roofs of old
buildings will be restored and increased. Among other measures, the
project will seek the adoption of a revised building code, aimed at
avoiding damage to nests and favouring better chances for the kestrels.

Finally, in Tuscany, a project will secure and enhance the conservation
status of a coastal ecosystem in the Migliarino- San Rossore-
Massaciuccoli Regional Park, which is threatened by invading exotic
plants and by erosion caused by excessive visitor impact. Visitors will
be channelled into a few trails.

Latvia - 1 project

This project also involves Lithuania and Estonia. It seeks to lay the
groundwork for marine protected areas within the Natura 2000 network.
Russia is participating too, in order to acquire expertise on marine
protection areas. Thirteen sites in the eastern Baltic between
Kaliningrad and the Gulf of Finland are concerned. The project brings
together 19 partners - government bodies, NGOs and research
institutes. The Latvian Ministry of Defence will supply vessels.

Lithuania - 2 projects

A Lithuanian NGO is heading a project with partners in Poland and
Brandenburg (Germany). It seeks to protect the European pond terrapin
Emys orbicularis as well as the amphibians Bombina bombina
(fire-bellied toad) and Triturus cristatus (great crested newt). The
project covers southeast Lithuania, Bielowieza National Park, Masuria,
the Poznan-Odra region and Uckermark, which represent the terrapin's
extreme northern range.

The Curonian Spit and the lagoon which it encloses are among the most
peculiar landscapes of the Baltic. They are very popular with visitors
but this is causing problems like the erosion of dune habitats. The
second project, a partnership between the Curonia National Park,
University of Vilnius and a conservation NGO, will control visitor flow
through trails and fences. The impact of fisheries on seabirds will be
studied and recommendations made, and 1600 ha of degraded dunes and
grassland will be restored.

Luxemburg -1 project

The Our river in northeast Luxemburg still hosts a significant
population of the threatened pearl mussel, but reproduction rates are
low and the individuals are generally old. A joint project between a
conservation NGO and the environment ministry will construct a captive
breeding centre, based on Czech techniques.

Netherlands - 1 project

The project concerns dune grasslands, dune slacks and dune heath lands
on the Wadden Sea islands of Terschelling, Texel and Vlieland, at 5
sites on the mainland coast (Noord-Holland, Zuid-Holland, Zeeland).
These habitats are all declining because of overgrowth, eutrophication
and desiccation. The dune coasts are major seaside holiday
destinations, so the project will place great emphasis on communication
and dissemination, as well as restoring 1100 ha of dunes and
reintroducing grazing in a further 1550 ha.

Poland - 1 project

A joint project with Germany focuses on the conservation of a
threatened passerine bird, Acrocephalus paludicola, which has
disappeared from most of its former range in northern Germany and
Poland due to habitat loss and degradation. The beneficiary, a Polish
NGO (Polish Society for the Protection of Birds - OTOP), will work in
partnership with various other NGOs and national parks, in order to
prevent the extinction of the population by raising awareness,
restoring and extending degraded habitats and putting in place
long-term management mechanisms.

Romania - 5 projects

Four of the five Romanian projects have to do with wildlife species.

One addresses a tiny remnant of the meadow viper (Vipera ursini
rakosiensis) population in Transylvania. This reptile is almost extinct
- the only other populations in the world, all small and under
threat, exist in Hungary.

The second project tackles large carnivores like the wolf (Canis
lupus), bear (Ursus arctos) and lynx (Lynx lynx) in the county of
Vrancea.

Bird species are addressed in two projects, one of them targeting the
populations of aquatic birds of the lower Prut floodplain and the other
targeting the populations of the Dalmatian pelican (Pelecanus crispus),
a priority species for LIFE funding, in the Danube delta.

The fifth project focuses on habitats across the whole Romanian
territory. Its aim is the conservation of forests, alpine and
sub-alpine habitats. It will encourage ecotourism ventures in local
communities and train local inhabitants into becoming nature guides. It
will also formulate proposals to support private landowners who want to
manage their forests in conformity with Natura 2000 objectives, and
promote these to the competent authorities.

Slovakia - 2 projects

One project targets the small population of great bustards (Otis
tarda), found at two sites between Bratislava and the Hungarian border.

The other project concerns the Zahorie wetlands in the west of the
country. A significant proportion of the sites lie within a military
training area. The project will carry out restoration work like
blocking or filling drainage ditches, clearing overgrown meadows and
improving the hydrology of mires.

Spain - 4 projects

Northern Spain's Atlantic acidophilous beach (Fagus sylvatica)
forests and Galicio-Portuguese oak woods (Quercus robur and Quercus
pyrenaica) in Aiako Harria SCI (Guipuzcoa, the Basque Country) are
covered by a project run by a partnership of four local authorities - a
water authority, a forestry foundation, a foundation for biodiversity
and the regional nature conservation authority. Together, they will
implement a plan for sustainable forestry.

Another project concerns four amphibian species protected under the
Habitats Directive. It covers their entire range in the region of
Valencia.

In northern Spain, a river basin management approach is proposed in the
framework of a third project to improve the populations of European
mink (Mustela lutreola) in the section of the river Ebro basin lying
within the Navarra region.

The fourth project addresses the conservation of Mediterranean
temporary ponds in the Balearic island of Minorca. The initial aim is
to improve knowledge of the dynamics and evolution of this fragile
habitat and to design the technical and legal tools needed for their
long-term conservation.

Sweden - 2 projects

The county of Östergötland will be carrying out a project to restore
wooded pastures in which large old oak trees, which host the endangered
beetle Osmoderma eremite, are situated.

The other project concerns the river Moälven, in the north of Sweden.
Its aim is to restore spawning beds for the salmon and install fish
ladders to open up the river to migration again. These actions will
also benefit the pearl mussel.

United Kingdom - 3 projects

The first project is a restoration programme concerning the River Avon
in southern England. Its aim is to restore the watercourse habitat and
conditions for associated species at six demonstration sites along the
river.

The second project is a vital conservation action for the protection of
the European population of the white-headed duck (Oxyura leucocephala)
which is threatened by the ruddy duck. A five year programme will
eradicate the ruddy duck in the UK and will provide advice on how to
eradicate the species from the rest of Europe.

The third project addresses the threats to breeding birds on islands
after predators have been accidentally introduced. With the support of
local people, the ferry companies and visitors, the island of Canna,
off Western Scotland, will be cleared of rats and effective monitoring
systems put in place to ensure the island remains rat-free.
