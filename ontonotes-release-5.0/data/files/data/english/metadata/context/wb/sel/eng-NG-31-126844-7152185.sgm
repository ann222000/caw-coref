Maybe they should have a draft in Iraq instead?

Don't show up, go to jail.

Show up, be watched 24 hours a day.

I believe the largest blunder Bush made was dismanteling the Iraqi
Army.

It will take years to build a new officer's and non-commisioned
officer's corps. Plus, they will have to get Iraqis used to the idea of
the Non-commisioned officers and lower ranks thinking for themselves.

One of the reason we have a great military is because of the average
soldier's ability to take over a situation when called upon to do so.

If we would have had the basic shell of the old army to start out with
we could have avoided trying to recruit and train a new army from
scratch.

That aside, should Iraq have a draft?

I don't know. Their culture is so different from ours.

When I joind the Army in 1962 I had to be in close quarters with black
people
for the first time in my life, and despite all of our differences, we
all survived.

The Iraqis have a different problem. They actually kill each other over
differences we would not even consider to be important.

How can you maintain order and dicipline under those circumstances?

I've never heard of the Iraqi military Â trying to segregate the Sunnis
and shiias.

On the other hand, every once in a while a story does slip out about
the civilian population doing
just that, the shiites are driving the Sunnis out of their
neighborhoods as fast as they can.

I'm betting the end result will be just like solutions in the recent
past, Partitioning.

Not unlike North and South Korea, East and West Germany.

You can't have a single military drawn from, in this case 3 different
camps, providing for overall security. They will always be fighting the
old grudges they brought from home.

What do you think?

Well, barring a partition, which may not be a bad idea...
forcing them to come together in military units and act
cohessively might not be a bad start.
They just might learn something in how to get along,
or end up in the brig for a while.
Either way, they'd be watched 24 hours a day in a
controlled environment.
And it might make their civilian friends less likely to
plant bombs or stike Iraqi forces who may have their
brothers, sons, uncles, in them.

I don't know. These guys hold out for revenge for things that happend
eons ago.

Maybe a better long range solution would be to start sending the
children to some sort sort of
non-religious school where they could mix with out being influenced by
some wild eyed iman.

Fat chance of that ever happening.
