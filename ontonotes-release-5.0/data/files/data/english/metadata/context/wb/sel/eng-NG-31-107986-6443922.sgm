I thought I would pass on this handy tip. A good way to clean your
carboy is to put some crushed ice inside, and add some salt. When you
start swooshing the ice around the carboy, the ice acts as an abrasive
and gets the hard to reach gunk off the sides.

Works great just make sure you rinse well.

Interesting.

Though I have to say - I haven't needed to use any "phyiscal" cleaning
of my carboys since I discovered PBW.  A few days soak in that stuff
and my carboys are super shiny and sheet water off the inside.

My poor carboy brush must be mighty bored.

I only secondary in glass, so my carboys aren't all that bad when I
go to clean them.  Every 5th batch I have to take the brush to neck

I guess it depends on your local water, because it only takes a few
minutes for me to make my carboys spotless. A few minutes soak with hot
water and Oxiclean, and then a carboy brush, with only the smallest of
effort on my part. Many times even the brush isn't necessary.

I guess some people get stuff truly inexorably caked on there. Do you
think it has to do with the pH/hardness of the local water? Beer
formulation?

A good idea, but crushing ice is a pain.  I like PBW myself.

Isn't filling a carboy with PBW solution (2 carboys per batch, assuming
you secondary) kind of expensive? How much PBW are you putting in for
these 2 day soaks? I purchased a small container (8 ounces, I think) of
PBW and have just started messing with it. It seems to lift gunk off
well, but using the dosages listed on the container to fill a 6 gallon
carboy to the brim would use quite a bit. And I don't think you'd want
to re-use it after it dissolved all the stuff that sticks to the top of
the carboy.

I see others comparing Oxyclean to PBW - is it just as effective here?
And if so, what dosage of Oxyclean do people use for a 6 gallon carboy?

My personal regime is to just fill with water for a couple of days
after rinsing and then using dish-soap and a bottle brush. I brush the
gunk off the top part, rinse, then brush the bottom and sides a couple
of times with soap, rinse well with hot water, dry upside down, and
store with tin-foil over the opening. Then sanitize before use.

Cleaning carboys is a real pain. Soaking for days isn't an option and
filling w/ cleaner is wasteful. I might break down and start heating a
gallon of water on my stove and shaking the carboy w/ caustic cleaner.
That's kind of dangerous, however.

The hardest spot is the dried krausen ring.  One idea I had was to fill
w/ a couple gallons of cleaner, cork it w/ a solid stopper and place it
over a PVC pipe and let it soak. That would save quite a bit of water
and cleaner.

So far, the best method I came up with is:

- Rinse the carboy w/ a jet bottle washer
- Fill carboy w/ hot water, add cleaner, then use a wine degaser on a
drill and get a good vortex going.
- Let it sit for an hour or so, then drain w/ a siphon
- Rinse well
- Acid Rinse
- Inspect w/ a flash light for any film

This is the reason I like buckets, but right now I'm trying to lock
down my beer's bacteria load and want to use glass.

&lt;snip&gt;

I really don't see the big deal. Over the course of 33 batches now,
I've cleaned every carboy using only a 10-minute soak (upside down)
with a gallon of hot water and some bio-degradeable dish soap,and then
5-10 minutes of elbow grease with a brush. No chemicals or fancy
processes needed.

Does everyone's yeast just make more of a mess than mine? I have
never, ever, ever soaked a carboy overnight or for hours, and never
used anything but dish soap.

Maybe I've just been lucky?

Mostly because carboys aren't intended for hot liquids.  Caustic (by
which I assume you mean lye) is supposed to be used at at least 165-170
degrees.  I wouldn't put that in my carboys.  It would probably wotk
fine a bunch of times, put glass stress can accumulate.  The worst case
scenario is to scary to me.

I just recently started brewing again after yet another hiatus (I really
hafta stop moving so much).  Anyway, I pulled out my 6 gallon carboy and it
was really nasty.  Funny, I really don't remember leaving all that crud
inside.  But, I filled it up with warm water and put some of my wife's
Oxyclean inside (2 scoops per 6 gallons).  I let it soak for about 30
minutes and then easily washed all of the gunk out with a brush.  It really
worked well, but I only used it because I didn't have any PBW.  I made sure
to rinse well, also...

I buy the big ol' tub of it, which probably saves me a little.  Also, I
definitely don't use the recommended concentration if I'm soaking for
days.  I'd say that if I fill the carboy all the way up and I'm aiming
for at least a couple days soak (I often end up letting them sit in the
stuff all week) then I'll toss in a few tablespoons.  Of course, if you
want to conserve further, you can fill the carboy 1/3 of the way up
with solution and keep it on its side with a bung.  Just make sure to
vent it and rotate it from time to time.

PBW is also reusable to a degree.  Especially if it was in a closed
container.  You can clean tons of kegs with one healthy batch of that
stuff.  Just push through the lines from one to the next, or so claims
Charlie Tallie (the dude that runs 5 star chemicals).

Dish soap scares me.  Surfactant city.  I don't even use it on my beer
glassware.  I fear that I wont rinse quite well enough, and blamo!  No
head on my beer.  I guess if your beer is coming out with a good head
on it, then no worries.  Your rinsing regimin is good enough.  Also, I
know dish soap is great about cutting through fats, but what about
other organic compounds?  Does it deal well with proteins, e.g.?  I
suppose it probably does.

Would surfactants from dish soap kill the initial beer foam and/or the

If it's in the glass, then in my experience it's mostly the latter.  I
think a sufficiently violent pour will will always cause head to form
(well, unless there's something wrong with the beer itself), but if
there's a bit of soap in the glass then the head will dissipate
quickly.

Now if it's in the carboy.  Good question.  Unless the soap actually
degrades enough of the right protiens (a seperate issue from the
surfactant problem) before the beer gets poured, then I'd guess it
would be the same as if the soap were in the glass.  The head would
form and dissipate quickly.  But I'm not sure.

Hmm. Since I've used dish soap *always* to clean my carboys and have
had a few instances of head retention issues, this is
interesting. Would rinsing the carboy with a dilute bleach or one-step
solution after cleaning take care of this?

I asked this question in a post a few weeks ago and was doing nearly the
same thing that you are now. I began to get some strange flavors out of
recipes that I had done before. I looked at the carboy drying upside down
when the sun was coming through and could see brush streaks down the sides.
It was suggested to soak in a bleach solution at one cap per gallon, then
rinse with the hottest water you can. I have done this since and my carboys
now sparkle in the sun with no streaks. If the carboy is bad I still use the
soap but I then put bleach in and let it soak overnight and they look great!
I cover with foil and use Iodophor the morning of brew day to sanitize.

John, just a note to say that you're not alone.  I've never had trouble
with a short warm soapy water soak, some agitation, and a rinse.  Only
rarely do I even need to get the brush out (say, 1 of 5 times).  Note
that I ALWAYS clean the carboy right after I empty it.  Not letting
anything dry in it probably matters too.

I use a little dish soap for most all primary cleaning.  Since I sanitize
with bleach, that also performs some cleaning right before use.

Dish soap scares me (when used in the same sentence as "beer") so I
don't use it.  I just use a carboy brush.  I've never had any issues
with cleaning carboys.

One of the most simple and effective things I ever did was hooking a
15-foot piece of garden hose to the hot water pipe, with a standard
household hose sprayer on the end.  (An extra tap was already in place
as part of the sink installation.)  If I put the sprayer just inside the
neck of the carboy and squeeze the handle just enough to create the wide
circular spray, it does a very nice job of spraying down the inside of
the carboy.  After the crud is loosened a bit with the brush, it washes
right off.

I agree and I do the same. I also treat my 12 oz bottles the same as well.
Rinse and shake with hot water a few times and all you have to do is
sanitize them before the next use. Every once in a while I'll have to soak a
few because I couldn't rinse them right away.

I've got a bad habbit of letting my carboys sit around dirty until I
use them again.  They get pretty nasty, especially the beer stone "ring
around the collar".  However, a short soak (less than an hour) with
oxyclean usually does the trick.

That is one of the major ingredients in Oxyclean and PBW mentioned up
thread.  Washing soda (soda ash) and sodium percarbonate make up 90+%
of oxycleans ingredients by weight.

I switched from PBW to Oiclean 5-6 years ago, at least, and I've been
completely satisfied with Oxiclean.  I use 2, sometimes 3, tablespoons

I think it depends on water hardness and you likely have soft water out there
in western Oregon ;-)

For a 6 gallon container, I have to use three or four scoops of either PBW or
oxyclean to get the fermentation resin cleaned off.  Usually, four scoops are
in order.  Also, I have noticed that PBW seems to continue to work for a
couple of days while Oxyclean seems to quit working after a couple of hours or
overnight.  And, FYI ... we have pretty hard water.

About a scoop per carboy, however big a "scoop" is.  Probably overkill, but
it works.

I actually measured the Oxiclean scoop I use the other day since this
comes up so much.  It's one of the "old style" scoops. It measure
exactly 2 tablespoons.  The scoops that come in Oxiclean these days look
more like 1/2 cup or so...WAY too much!

Pople seem to make that assumption, but actually my well water is
moderately hard, on the carbonate side.

I never let the Oxiclean sit for more than a couple hours.  By that
time, things are squeaky clean!

I use Oxiclean for regular cleaning of equipment, and B-Brite for
cleaning and sanitizing of fermentors and carboys.  I use 1 TBSP of
Oxiclean for 1 gallon of water and splash it around for a while.

"A stitch in time saves nine."  No matter how busy you are, ALWAYS at
least fill the carboy up with water after you rack.  Now, what I also
try to do when I've finished racking, since I quite often am going to
use the yeast slurry and don't want it contaminated any more than
necessary, is to cover the top with either foil or a sandwich baggie and
a rubber band.  That will at least keep it from drying out and being
harder to clean later.

Re the comment about using too much cleaner (I use dish soap and
bleach), you can also do what I do to save time filling the carboy all
the way up; I fill it half way, drop a bucket over the top, flip them
over, and a half filled carboy has the top and neck immersed in cleaner.

Cheers.

Thomas, I agree... I once let a couple of carboys soak with oxyclean for 3
days and could not get the white thick film off.  It took a couple acid baths
to get the residue off.  Short term washing, I'll use oxyclean, but a long (5
days or so) soak... PBW is the way to go.  I too have extremely hard water!
