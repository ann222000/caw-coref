Hellooooo all.

Anyone use Hydrox (hydrogen peroxide) for cleaning nappies? Can anyone
tell me where we could get hold of it in big (2 litre plus)
containers, other than Hip Baby on West 4th? I'm hacked off having to
go all that way! By the way, we need quite hardcore stuff, not the
watered down versions they sell for regular laundry in Choices/Capers,
etc.

Cheers,

Kerry

We used to use Hyrox from Hip Baby and I got sick of traveling across
town every time we ran out.  I switched to VIP biodegradable and was
amazed to find out that my diapers were cleaner, no odours clung at
all.  Plus I can buy it at lots of stores on this side of town and in
really large buckets so it lasts forever.

Woahhhh! Cheers Molly ... hey what do you use, if anything, to spray/
pour on the nappies while they're sitting in the pail? We've been
spraying with Hydrox, and then using a mix of Hydrox, laundry
detergent (often use VIP too, though SPUD was sold out last order),
and vinegar in the washing machine.
Cheers!

Does anyone buy detergent at Extra Foods/Superstore?  I was there the other
day and noticed a bunch of natural detergents - I didn't have time to look
in detail, though.  We've been using Nellie's Laundry soap - $20 for 80
loads (only a tablespoon per load and we have a spray bottle of 3
tablespoons in water to pre-treat).

We use Allen's Naturally- I order through www.raisedinreusables.com -
she delivers in the lower mainland.... and the box lasts a long time
(5 months and counting) because it's super concentrated power (same
as nellies). We mostly use pocket diapers but also some hemp and
cotton- we don't soak in the pail... just use a dry pail and every
few washes I start the wash but then interrupt the cycle so it sits
and soaks for an hour then continue the cycle.
I have also used Nature Clean Powder (which I use for our clothes)-
it worked ok but I do find Allen's works better.
Thanks for the spray pre-treat idea- that could have eliminated a few
stubborn poop stains we have ;)
Cheers, Tanis

Thanks for the ideas ... I wonder if vinegar (my personal favourite
household cleaner) would work as a pre-treater instead of Hyrdox.
Maybe I'll conduct some experiments (poor Sati!) and see.

My Diaper Cleanse goes as follows:

Shake any solids off into toilet (anything that still clings is left
on the diaper)
Put into a dry pail (no spraying or anything)
Every 4 or so days throw it into the washing machine with a quarter
cup Borax and warm water.  Let soak 20 minutes and then drain.
Then I start a wash cycle with maximum agitation and hot water and a
quarter cup of VIP
Followed by two cold rinses

Periodically I add vinegar to the first rinse to help reduce soap
build up.

If I have to use a detergent that leaves residue (traveling etc) I
have to do a stripping when I get home.  That consists of rinse after
rinse after rinse in super hot water until I don't see any bubbles.
When we got home from vacation this time it took 8 hot rinses to get
the tide out of Kale's diapers.

I think the Borax is the magic ingredient.  It can get stains that
have been through the dryer out.

We just basically do a double cycle. One with laundry soda (similar to
Borax but just a bit stronger) by Arm &amp; Hammer. Then we do a 2nd wash
with our normal household Seventh Generation detergent.

Seems to be working great. We do this on diapers and all clothes with
nasty food stains.
