EFF: Crunch Time for E-voting Reform

Matt Zimmerman, the attorney at EFF.org who represented us in court
several times in North Carolina - weighs in with wise advice on HR 811
Crunch Time for E-voting Reform
&lt; http://www.eff.org/deeplinks/archives/005421.php
&lt; http://www.eff.org/deeplinks/archives/005421.php &gt;&gt; September 04, 2007
If all goes as planned, HR 811 -- the Voter Confidence and Increased
Accessibility Act of 2007
&lt; http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d110:h.r.00811:
&lt; http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d110:h.r.00811: &gt;&gt; , introduced
by New Jersey Representative Rush Holt &lt; http://holt.house.gov/
&lt; http://holt.house.gov/ &gt;&gt; -- will
finally come to a floor vote in the House of Representatives this week,
likely on Thursday or Friday. Despite speculation to the contrary, it is
not at all clear whether the bill will pass or, even if it does, whether
a substantively similar companion bill will then pass the Senate. Like
it or not, with election officials arguing that they're running out of
time to implement wholesale changes, this likely amounts to Congress's
only attempt to make any serious improvements to the nation's election
procedures ahead of the 2008 presidential election.

EFF supports HR 811 and hopes that you will tell your Representative
&lt; http://action.eff.org/site/Advocacy?id=109
&lt; http://action.eff.org/site/Advocacy?id=109 &gt;&gt; to support it as well. As
we have done over the years through the bill's
&lt; http://www.eff.org/news/archives/2005_06.php#003643
&lt; http://www.eff.org/news/archives/2005_06.php#003643 &gt;&gt; various
&lt; http://www.eff.org/deeplinks/archives/004539.php
&lt; http://www.eff.org/deeplinks/archives/004539.php &gt;&gt; incarnations
&lt; http://www.eff.org/deeplinks/archives/005308.php
&lt; http://www.eff.org/deeplinks/archives/005308.php &gt;&gt; , EFF has supported
HR 811 based on what the bill would actually do, not what it lacks. At
the end of the day, a post-HR 811 electoral system would indisputably
(despite arguments to the contrary) be better than the one that exists
today. EFF has discussed this in detail before
&lt; http://www.eff.org/deeplinks/archives/005308.php
&lt; http://www.eff.org/deeplinks/archives/005308.php &gt;&gt; : from where we sit,
banning the use of paperless direct recording electronic (DRE) voting
machines if they are not retrofitted with voter-verified paper ballots
(VVPATs) and mandating for the first time across-the-board audits of
federal elections would unquestionably be good things which continue to
deserve support, regardless of whether or not we'd like to see
additional improvements.

Are DREs, even those utilizing VVPATs, fraught with problems? Of course
&lt; http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/elections_vsr.htm
&lt; http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/elections_vsr.htm &gt;&gt; . Should more
rigorous audits be mandated? Absolutely
&lt; http://www.brennancenter.org/dynamic/subpages/download_file_50135.pdf
&lt; http://www.brennancenter.org/dynamic/subpages/download_file_50135.pdf &gt;&gt;
. But a heartfelt desire to ban DREs or improve audits is no reason to
oppose this bill, especially since states are not prohibited from making
either of these reforms -- or nearly any other voting system-related
reform -- on their own.

Our support for HR 811 is tempered by profound disappointment that one
of the bill's pillars has been watered down to the point of
ineffectiveness due to pressure from the proprietary software industry.
The source code disclosure provisions, requiring that voting system
source code be disclosed at the very least to litigants and other
&quot;qualified persons&quot; who can test the integrity of the voting system
under a non-disclosure agreement, have since the bill's introduction
been replaced by a requirement that &quot;voting system software&quot; -- a
definition that does not explicitly include source code -- be disclosed.
While &quot;correcting&quot; language was included in the Committee Report
&lt; http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=110_cong_repo\
rts&amp;docid=f:hr154.110.pdf
&lt; http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=110_cong_re... &gt;&gt;
as a result of prompt feedback from computer
security experts after the bill's current language was released, that
Report will likely not be sufficient to ensure source code access.
Having litigated &lt; http://www.eff.org/deeplinks/archives/004285.php
&lt; http://www.eff.org/deeplinks/archives/004285.php &gt;&gt;
cases &lt; http://www.eff.org/news/archives/2006_11.php#005020
&lt; http://www.eff.org/news/archives/2006_11.php#005020 &gt;&gt; in which
prompt access to voting system source code is critical, EFF's strong
advocacy for this bill has been based in large part on the source code
disclosure requirement. We call on Rep. Zoe Lofgren and the other
members of the Elections Subcommittee to promptly fix this provision --
using the explicit language included in the Committee Report -- before
the bill makes it to the floor of the House.

Whatever its shortcomings, whatever its incremental pace, HR 811 offers
an important step forward. EFF continues to call for more ambitious
reform than that offered by the current version of the bill, but we also
properly recognize that HR 811 offers the best immediate opportunity for
meaningful change. It needs your support
&lt; http://action.eff.org/site/Advocacy?id=109
&lt; http://action.eff.org/site/Advocacy?id=109 &gt;&gt; today. Without it, be
prepared to live with no additional federal protections for the 2008
election as we all return to square one with a new bill targeted at the
2010 or 2012 general election.

I am of the opinion that the Holt bill is not an adequate solution; on the
other hand, could someone who's better informed than I tell me if there are
any other measure for election integrity that have been put before Congress?

Consensus is that this bill is the only one with a chance of passing this year that will require paper records and audits in all voting jurisdictions in 2008.

I recommend asking your Representative to support HR811 as long as, and only as long as, it continues to require paper records and audits in 2008.  At the same time I think it is important to let them know that this bill will not fix all the problems and future legislation for later years will still be necessary.  We need to &quot;manage expectations&quot; in this way so that legislators do not get the impression that this bill will satisfy citizens' demand for election reform in the long run.

Thanks,
Randy

It's the wrong bill plus now will be introduved as unfunded with likely effective date 2010

I actually got into Voting Integrity because of friends who introduced me to Rush Holt. CVI sent members to lobby for earlier bills but when we saw what was developing in 811, did extensive study,  and then saw the disastrous mark up changes, our organization unanimously decided we had to oppose the bill and seek alternate security measures.

Now I am very disturbed to hear that 811 will be likely voted on as a non-funded bill - now they tell us at last minute... and there bery likely will be no funding till 2010 or later....it's all up in the air.  Why should we pass a bill that won't help 2008 (though quite frankly it would have caused problems if the 2008 date prevailed). and could stop better bills from coming forward?  We need to clear the decks and focus on next year's election....it can be done...it must be done. A stripped down bill focused on most critical needs for 2008  is currently being worked on.  It's time to put REAL reform in...means DREs must be removed from our elections fast!

Also 811 now appears to likely  have any funded parts deferred and that is likely to be 2010 or later.  Why pass a bill that won't help critical 2008. election.  As my article said we need a stripped down bill first banning DREs (see complete article).  AGAIN...We need to clear the decks of problematic bills so real reform can be introduced and enacted.

By the way there is an open question if unfunded 811 passes, would the parts that aren't related to money go into effect ... like giving further and unnecessary power to the EAC, four presidential appointees who have little oversight and a very dubious track record...why would we ever do this?

Check out http://www.votersunite.org/info/hr811Report.pdf or Teresa Hommel's point by point evaluation om wheresthepaper.org  Also look at some of the Holt videos

messge from Nancy Tobi
HR811: In Holt's own words, three short videos
Congress is poised to pass another phony bill. Like the &quot;Patriot Act&quot;, designed to strip civil liberties from American patriots and other free citizens of the world, or the &quot;Clear Skies Initiative&quot;, designed to allow corporations to pump more poisons into our heavens. The &quot;Voter Confidence Act&quot;, or HR811, or the Holt Bill, is being brought to the House floor today.

Learn more about this dangerous legislation from its prime sponsor, Congressman Rush Holt himself. View these three short videos, taken from a town meeting with Congressman Holt's constituents in July 2007.

Is his bill good for the nation? You be the judge.

Consensus is that this bill is the only one with a chance of passing this year that will require paper records and audits in all voting jurisdictions in 2008.

I recommend asking your Representative to support HR811 as long as, and only as long as, it continues to require paper records and audits in 2008.  At the same time I think it is important to let them know that this bill will not fix all the problems and future legislation for later years will still be necessary.  We need to &quot;manage expectations&quot; in this way so that legislators do not get the impression that this bill will satisfy citizens' demand for election reform in the long run.

I am of the opinion that the Holt bill is not an adequate solution; on the other hand, could someone who's better informed than I tell me if there are any other measure for election integrity that have been put before Congress?

EFF: Crunch Time for E-voting Reform
Posted by: &quot;Joyce McCloy&quot; jmc27 ... @earthlink.net   ncverifiablevoting
Tue Sep 4, 2007 8:58 pm (PST)
Matt Zimmerman, the attorney at EFF.org who represented us in court
several times in North Carolina - weighs in with wise advice on HR 811
Crunch Time for E-voting Reform
&lt; http://www.eff.org/deeplinks/archives/005421.php &gt; September 04, 2007
If all goes as planned, HR 811 -- the Voter Confidence and Increased
Accessibility Act of 2007
&lt; http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d110:h.r.00811: &gt; , introduced
by New Jersey Representative Rush Holt &lt; http://holt.house.gov/ &gt; -- will
finally come to a floor vote in the House of Representatives this week,
likely on Thursday or Friday. Despite speculation to the contrary, it is
not at all clear whether the bill will pass or, even if it does, whether
a substantively similar companion bill will then pass the Senate. Like
it or not, with election officials arguing that they're running out of
time to implement wholesale changes, this likely amounts to Congress's
only attempt to make any serious improvements to the nation's election
procedures ahead of the 2008 presidential election.

EFF supports HR 811 and hopes that you will tell your Representative
&lt; http://action.eff.org/site/Advocacy?id=109 &gt; to support it as well. As
we have done over the years through the bill's
&lt; http://www.eff.org/news/archives/2005_06.php#003643 &gt; various
&lt; http://www.eff.org/deeplinks/archives/004539.php &gt; incarnations
&lt; http://www.eff.org/deeplinks/archives/005308.php &gt; , EFF has supported
HR 811 based on what the bill would actually do, not what it lacks. At
the end of the day, a post-HR 811 electoral system would indisputably
(despite arguments to the contrary) be better than the one that exists
today. EFF has discussed this in detail before
&lt; http://www.eff.org/deeplinks/archives/005308.php &gt; : from where we sit,
banning the use of paperless direct recording electronic (DRE) voting
machines if they are not retrofitted with voter-verified paper ballots
(VVPATs) and mandating for the first time across-the-board audits of
federal elections would unquestionably be good things which continue to
deserve support, regardless of whether or not we'd like to see
additional improvements.

Are DREs, even those utilizing VVPATs, fraught with problems? Of course
&lt; http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/elections_vsr.htm &gt; . Should more
rigorous audits be mandated? Absolutely
&lt; http://www.brennancenter.org/dynamic/subpages/download_file_50135.pdf &gt;
. But a heartfelt desire to ban DREs or improve audits is no reason to
oppose this bill, especially since states are not prohibited from making
either of these reforms -- or nearly any other voting system-related
reform -- on their own.

Our support for HR 811 is tempered by profound disappointment that one
of the bill's pillars has been watered down to the point of
ineffectiveness due to pressure from the proprietary software industry.
The source code disclosure provisions, requiring that voting system
source code be disclosed at the very least to litigants and other
&quot;qualified persons&quot; who can test the integrity of the voting system
under a non-disclosure agreement, have since the bill's introduction
been replaced by a requirement that &quot;voting system software&quot; -- a
definition that does not explicitly include source code -- be disclosed.
While &quot;correcting&quot; language was included in the Committee Report
&lt; http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=110_cong_repo\
rts&amp;docid=f:hr154.110.pdf&gt; as a result of prompt feedback from computer
security experts after the bill's current language was released, that
Report will likely not be sufficient to ensure source code access.
Having litigated &lt; http://www.eff.org/deeplinks/archives/004285.php &gt;
cases &lt; http://www.eff.org/news/archives/2006_11.php#005020 &gt; in which
prompt access to voting system source code is critical, EFF's strong
advocacy for this bill has been based in large part on the source code
disclosure requirement. We call on Rep. Zoe Lofgren and the other
members of the Elections Subcommittee to promptly fix this provision --
using the explicit language included in the Committee Report -- before
the bill makes it to the floor of the House.

&gt; Well, well, well!

&gt; I've gotten quite a response, it seems, to my little comment.  I'm just
&gt; going to say that, first off, Holt is my district's representative, so my
&gt; contacting him in either case would not sway his vote.  Second, I am going
&gt; to say that while I appreciate Holt's attempt at solving the problem of our
&gt; elections, we can do better.  If there is alternative legislature, then
&gt; let's go for it.

&gt; I come from Princeton, New Jersey, a town which sets high standards for
&gt; everything, including maintenance of democracy and, of course, election
&gt; integrity (note: we do not meet our own standards when it comes to voting
&gt; machines.)  As a Princetonian, I feel that these standards can and should be
&gt; met, and I'm sure that many people from other towns feel the same.

&gt; However, I respect other people's views, so I will not endeavor to sway
&gt; any of you for or against HR811.

&gt; By the way, who's up for contacting Obama, Hilary and the other Democratic
&gt; candidates and trying to convince them that election integrity should be
&gt; part of their platforms?  If we get a promise from someone who then wins the
&gt; primaries, we can remind him/ her of his/her promise (using words like

&gt; &gt;  I actually got into Voting Integrity because of friends who introduced
&gt; &gt; me to Rush Holt. CVI sent members to lobby for earlier bills but when we saw
&gt; &gt; what was developing in 811, did extensive study,  and then saw the
&gt; &gt; disastrous mark up changes, our organization unanimously decided we had to
&gt; &gt; oppose the bill and seek alternate security measures.

&gt; &gt; Now I am very disturbed to hear that 811 will be likely voted on as a
&gt; &gt; non-funded bill - now they tell us at last minute... and there bery likely
&gt; &gt; will be no funding till 2010 or later....it's all up in the air.  Why should
&gt; &gt; we pass a bill that won't help 2008 (though quite frankly it would have
&gt; &gt; caused problems if the 2008 date prevailed). and could stop better bills
&gt; &gt; from coming forward?  We need to clear the decks and focus on next year's
&gt; &gt; election....it can be done...it must be done. A stripped down bill focused
&gt; &gt; on most critical needs for 2008  is currently being worked on.  It's time to
&gt; &gt; put REAL reform in...means DREs must be removed from our elections fast!

&gt; &gt; Also 811 now appears to likely  have any funded parts deferred and that
&gt; &gt; is likely to be 2010 or later.  Why pass a bill that won't help critical
&gt; &gt; 2008. election.  As my article said we need a stripped down bill first
&gt; &gt; banning DREs (see complete article).  AGAIN...We need to clear the decks of
&gt; &gt; problematic bills so real reform can be introduced and enacted.

&gt; &gt; By the way there is an open question if unfunded 811 passes, would the
&gt; &gt; parts that aren't related to money go into effect ... like giving further
&gt; &gt; and unnecessary power to the EAC, four presidential appointees who have
&gt; &gt; little oversight and a very dubious track record...why would we ever do

Hi Olivia. My brother lives in Princeton too! ( I live in Oakland)

As far as I know , there is no alternative legislation at a federal
level that has any chance of doing anything for 2008. I don't know that
there is anything even close to doing something for 2010!

There was a very bad bill in the Senate that Feinstein put out and that
Clinton is touting but I think they have enough input to realize how
very bad this bill is and will be re-writing it. At least, that was the
last that I heard. Feinstein is holding hearings and hopefully based on
that she will make some changes. I think it was supposed to be a
companion bill to Holt ( not sure what that means to tell the truth). I
think it's called the National Count Every Vote Act.  It has the whole
kitchen sink in it and looked like it was written by the opposition.

RE: Political candidates -Election integrity means a lot of different
things to a lot of different people.  At this point, I think that
Kucinich is the only candidate that really really gets it about the
machines, but unfortunately, he has no chance of getting the nomination.

My suggestion is to do whatever you can to get New Jersey right and
don't wait for any Federal legislation to come save you.
Get involved to get a Secretary of State that understands.

I have asked my Representative to support HR 811 if, and only if, the 2008 deadline for paper records and audits remains.  I have also made clear that future reforms remain imperative, in my opinion, even if HR811 becomes law.  Why should passing this bill now, to affect the 2008 election, prevent lobbying for more changes for later years?

It's the wrong bill plus now will be introduved as unfunded with likely effective date 2010

I actually got into Voting Integrity because of friends who introduced me to Rush Holt. CVI sent members to lobby for earlier bills but when we saw what was developing in 811, did extensive study,  and then saw the disastrous mark up changes, our organization unanimously decided we had to oppose the bill and seek alternate security measures.

Now I am very disturbed to hear that 811 will be likely voted on as a non-funded bill - now they tell us at last minute... and there bery likely will be no funding till 2010 or later....it's all up in the air.  Why should we pass a bill that won't help 2008 (though quite frankly it would have caused problems if the 2008 date prevailed). and could stop better bills from coming forward?  We need to clear the decks and focus on next year's election....it can be done...it must be done. A stripped down bill focused on most critical needs for 2008  is currently being worked on.  It's time to put REAL reform in...means DREs must be removed from our elections fast!

Also 811 now appears to likely  have any funded parts deferred and that is likely to be 2010 or later.  Why pass a bill that won't help critical 2008. election.  As my article said we need a stripped down bill first banning DREs (see complete article).  AGAIN...We need to clear the decks of problematic bills so real reform can be introduced and enacted.

By the way there is an open question if unfunded 811 passes, would the parts that aren't related to money go into effect ... like giving further and unnecessary power to the EAC, four presidential appointees who have little oversight and a very dubious track record...why would we ever do this?

Check out http://www.votersunite.org/info/hr811Report.pdf or Teresa Hommel's point by point evaluation om wheresthepaper.org  Also look at some of the Holt videos

messge from Nancy Tobi
HR811: In Holt's own words, three short videos
Congress is poised to pass another phony bill. Like the &quot;Patriot Act&quot;, designed to strip civil liberties from American patriots and other free citizens of the world, or the &quot;Clear Skies Initiative&quot;, designed to allow corporations to pump more poisons into our heavens. The &quot;Voter Confidence Act&quot;, or HR811, or the Holt Bill, is being brought to the House floor today.

Learn more about this dangerous legislation from its prime sponsor, Congressman Rush Holt himself. View these three short videos, taken from a town meeting with Congressman Holt's constituents in July 2007.

EFF: Crunch Time for E-voting Reform
Posted by: &quot;Joyce McCloy&quot; jmc27 ... @earthlink.net   ncverifiablevoting
Tue Sep 4, 2007 8:58 pm (PST)
Matt Zimmerman, the attorney at EFF.org who represented us in court
several times in North Carolina - weighs in with wise advice on HR 811
Crunch Time for E-voting Reform
&lt; http://www.eff.org/deeplinks/archives/005421.php &gt; September 04, 2007
If all goes as planned, HR 811 -- the Voter Confidence and Increased
Accessibility Act of 2007
&lt; http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d110:h.r.00811: &gt; , introduced
by New Jersey Representative Rush Holt &lt; http://holt.house.gov/ &gt; -- will
finally come to a floor vote in the House of Representatives this week,
likely on Thursday or Friday. Despite speculation to the contrary, it is
not at all clear whether the bill will pass or, even if it does, whether
a substantively similar companion bill will then pass the Senate. Like
it or not, with election officials arguing that they're running out of
time to implement wholesale changes, this likely amounts to Congress's
only attempt to make any serious improvements to the nation's election
procedures ahead of the 2008 presidential election.

EFF supports HR 811 and hopes that you will tell your Representative
&lt; http://action.eff.org/site/Advocacy?id=109 &gt; to support it as well. As
we have done over the years through the bill's
&lt; http://www.eff.org/news/archives/2005_06.php#003643 &gt; various
&lt; http://www.eff.org/deeplinks/archives/004539.php &gt; incarnations
&lt; http://www.eff.org/deeplinks/archives/005308.php &gt; , EFF has supported
HR 811 based on what the bill would actually do, not what it lacks. At
the end of the day, a post-HR 811 electoral system would indisputably
(despite arguments to the contrary) be better than the one that exists
today. EFF has discussed this in detail before
&lt; http://www.eff.org/deeplinks/archives/005308.php &gt; : from where we sit,
banning the use of paperless direct recording electronic (DRE) voting
machines if they are not retrofitted with voter-verified paper ballots
(VVPATs) and mandating for the first time across-the-board audits of
federal elections would unquestionably be good things which continue to
deserve support, regardless of whether or not we'd like to see
additional improvements.

Are DREs, even those utilizing VVPATs, fraught with problems? Of course
&lt; http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/elections_vsr.htm &gt; . Should more
rigorous audits be mandated? Absolutely
&lt; http://www.brennancenter.org/dynamic/subpages/download_file_50135.pdf &gt;
. But a heartfelt desire to ban DREs or improve audits is no reason to
oppose this bill, especially since states are not prohibited from making
either of these reforms -- or nearly any other voting system-related
reform -- on their own.

Our support for HR 811 is tempered by profound disappointment that one
of the bill's pillars has been watered down to the point of
ineffectiveness due to pressure from the proprietary software industry.
The source code disclosure provisions, requiring that voting system
source code be disclosed at the very least to litigants and other
&quot;qualified persons&quot; who can test the integrity of the voting system
under a non-disclosure agreement, have since the bill's introduction
been replaced by a requirement that &quot;voting system software&quot; -- a
definition that does not explicitly include source code -- be disclosed.
While &quot;correcting&quot; language was included in the Committee Report

I would gladly support Kucinich's bill if he were to reintroduce it.  But he has not yet, and if he wants it to be considered at all, it seems to me, he better do it before HR811 is voted on.  I'm afraid he has run out of time.

Regarding Ellen Theisen's paper:
a.. It is out of date - for example one of the seven failures &quot;The dysfunctional Election Assistance Commission is made permanent,&quot; is not true of the latest version of HR811.  The paper was written before the latest version was made public.
b.. Its claim that &quot;many experts who have researched election audit methods agree that the model in HR 811 will not be effective or provide confidence&quot; does not specify who the experts are.  And many experts do support the audits, but in any case some audits are better than none.
c.. The argument that it &quot;institutes legally...'ballots' that will never be counted, and...secret vote-counting&quot; does not seem to me to demonstrate a degree of harm that outdoes the good in the bill, like the mandatory audits.  Congress would be no less able to make laws in the future requiring ballots that really are counted and vote-counting that is not done in secret.  So is there any real &quot;harm&quot;?  Without HR811 we will have secret, electronic vote-counting anyway in 2008, but the counts will not be cross-checked by audits except in any individual states that require them.  That seems to me more harmful.
Best,

Randy

As far as other voting reform bills, there has been much pressure put on Rep.

He has said he will, but it hasn't happened yet.

&lt; http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=110_cong_repo\
rts&amp;docid=f:hr154.110.pdf&gt; as a result of prompt feedback from computer
security experts after the bill's current language was released, that
Report will likely not be sufficient to ensure source code access.
Having litigated &lt; http://www.eff.org/deeplinks/archives/004285.php &gt;
cases &lt; http://www.eff.org/news/archives/2006_11.php#005020 &gt; in which
prompt access to voting system source code is critical, EFF's strong
advocacy for this bill has been based in large part on the source code
disclosure requirement. We call on Rep. Zoe Lofgren and the other
members of the Elections Subcommittee to promptly fix this provision --
using the explicit language included in the Committee Report -- before
the bill makes it to the floor of the House.

Whatever its shortcomings, whatever its incremental pace, HR 811 offers
an important step forward. EFF continues to call for more ambitious
reform than that offered by the current version of the bill, but we also
properly recognize that HR 811 offers the best immediate opportunity for
meaningful change. It needs your support

re: audits
In CA, SoS Bowen commissioned a group to look at audits. Their
recommendation was to go to riskbased audits, not fixed percentage.  But
the math still needs to be done on how to do this and implementation
will not be simple.  If you are interested, I suggest you check out SoS
Bowens web page.  There were some serious experts on this panel.

&gt;     HCPB bill he introduced last session, that would call for paper
&gt;     ballots hand-counted in public view for all federal races
&gt;     (pres,v.p., senator, representative). He has said he will, but it
&gt;     hasn't happened yet.

&gt;         I recommend asking your Representative to support HR811 as
&gt;         long as, and only as long as, it continues to require paper
&gt;         records and audits in 2008.  At the same time I think it is
&gt;         important to let them know that this bill will not fix all the
&gt;         problems and future legislation for later years will still be
&gt;         necessary.  We need to &quot;manage expectations&quot; in this way so
&gt;         that legislators do not get the impression that this bill will
&gt;         satisfy citizens' demand for election reform in the long run.

H.R. 811 may not make the EAC permanent, but it does assign
it many new responsibilities.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; re: audits
&gt; In CA, SoS Bowen commissioned a group to look at audits. Their
&gt; recommendation was to go to riskbased audits, not fixed percentage.  But
&gt; the math still needs to be done on how to do this and implementation
&gt; will not be simple.  If you are interested, I suggest you check out SoS
&gt; Bowens web page.  There were some serious experts on this panel.

&gt;&gt; I would gladly support Kucinich's bill if he were to reintroduce it.
&gt;&gt; But he has not yet, and if he wants it to be considered at all, it
&gt;&gt; seems to me, he better do it before HR811 is voted on.  I'm afraid he
&gt;&gt; has run out of time.

&gt;&gt; Regarding Ellen Theisen's paper:

&gt;&gt;     * It is out of date - for example one of the seven failures &quot;The
&gt;&gt;       dysfunctional Election Assistance Commission is made permanent,&quot;
&gt;&gt;       is not true of the latest version of HR811.  The paper was
&gt;&gt;       written before the latest version was made public.
&gt;&gt;    *
&gt;&gt;       Its claim that &quot;many experts who have researched election audit
&gt;&gt;       methods agree that the model in HR 811 will not be effective or
&gt;&gt;       provide confidence&quot; does not specify who the experts are.  And
&gt;&gt;       many experts do support the audits, but in any case some audits
&gt;&gt;       are better than none.
&gt;&gt;    *
&gt;&gt;       The argument that it &quot;institutes legally...'ballots' that will
&gt;&gt;       never be counted, and...secret vote-counting&quot; does not seem to
&gt;&gt;       me to demonstrate a degree of harm that outdoes the good in the
&gt;&gt;       bill, like the mandatory audits.  Congress would be no less able
&gt;&gt;       to make laws in the future requiring ballots that really are
&gt;&gt;       counted and vote-counting that is not done in secret.  So is
&gt;&gt;       there any real &quot;harm&quot;?  Without HR811 we will have secret,
&gt;&gt;       electronic vote-counting anyway in 2008, but the counts will not
&gt;&gt;       be cross-checked by audits except in any individual states that
&gt;&gt;       require them.  That seems to me more harmful.

&gt;&gt; Best,

&gt;&gt;     Randy
