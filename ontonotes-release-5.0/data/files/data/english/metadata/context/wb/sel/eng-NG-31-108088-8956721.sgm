Subject: Gunnison area trail closings

Here is an email I sent to r2_gmug_gunnison_tra ... @fs.fed.us

Please feel free to copy it or create your own response. Be sure to
add your full contact information at the bottom. This has to be done
right away so don't put it off. Take the time to do it and to forward
to anyone you think would be willing to send an email. I don't think
it matters if they have ever been there or not. The people who want to
shut areas down often have never even been to the area.

Now get to it..

If you are too busy to read this long email, just let me summarize it
by saying I would like to be one voice asking that no complete trail
closures take place in the Gunnison Basin. My information is at the
end of this email.

I would like to express my appreciation for all the hard work that
makes the Taylor Park off-road trail system such a joy. I have
vacationed at the Taylor Park area every year since 1995 for the
exclusive purpose of trail riding on an off-road motorcycle. Each year
there are 10 to 14 of us varying in age from 15 to 65. I know many
other folks who drive there four wheel drive vehicles and ATV's in
this area. If not for the off-road riding, I would probably never have
visited this part of Colorado. It is a bit off the beaten path for
recreation, which is why it makes for such a wonderful place for a
dirt bike vacation.

I have heard various rumors about proposed trail closures. It is my
understanding that my comments are to be as specific as possible. I
have learned that the following are the trails some wish to close and
that I wish to ride for years to come. I have ridden almost every one
of these trails with older generation dirt bikers and have already
started bringing the next generation of dirt bikers to these same
trails. I have copied the following specific trail information and
comments so that I could show my support of these trails and
comments.

Please find a way to keep the following trails open.

CREST TRAIL This trail has been a single-track motorized trail for
over 50 years, and it has access from the east, south and west,
adjoining other motorized trails. The closure of this trail will also
close access to four other major historic motorized trails,
eliminating over 10 miles of single-track trail. In fact, the Crest
trail is a mixture of 4wd access roads, and only single-track trail
for a few miles in the middle section. The trail is accessed by a 4wd
road on the north and 4wd road on the south. OHV recreation funds have
been utilized to maintain this trail, as well as many hours of
volunteer labor from motorcycle clubs.

BEAVER CREEK-APRIL GULCH The area of Beaver Creek - April Gulch needs
to be reevaluated. The closure of this historic motorized trail, does
nothing to enhance recreation opportunities, it only goes to eliminate
the only motorized single track trail, from Ohio Pass to Highway 50.
This trail has been maintained by local motorcycle user groups for
over 40 years. To the best of our knowledge, no FS or BLM work has
been preformed on this trail. All work has been by local motorcycle
riders. The trail does not interfere with the State of Colorado's
Division of Wildlife green back trout issue. The trail crosses Beaver
Creek only once, and then exits the area through an existing BLM road
connecting to the BLM land end road. This plan was submitted initially
but apparently ignored by the planning team even though it had support
by the BLM as a viable option for keeping the Beaver Creek Trail open
for motorized recreation. This plan was resubmitted in more detail to
the FS and BLM in June. We hope that this more detailed explanation of
our plan, will allow the Beaver Creek trail to remain open for
motorized recreation. We would be willing to discuss a seasonal
closure and a one-way route designation. It appears to the C500 and
the COHVCO that the closure of Beaver Creek is an attempt to create a
buffer to the West Elk Wilderness, contrary to wilderness
establishment legislation.

GREEN LAKE TRAIL #565 AND #566 With the closure of this trail and
Green Lake Trail (off Kebler and Ohio Passes), the TMP completely
eliminates all motorized single track trails on the west side from
Crested Butte to Gunnison. This does not sustain or enhance recreation
opportunity, forcing all motorcycles to use the congested roads shared
by all other forms of transportation.

LOWER DOCTORS PARK TRAIL #424-NORTH BANK Used by motorized users from
1979 to link Doctor's Park to Taylor River and served to loop riders
coming from Spring Creek area without having to ride down the road.
Not shown on the new USFS map is the loop from North Bank Trail to
point where it connects back into the Doctor's park portion about 2
miles up. Loosing the trail will be a major blow to motorized use.

STRAND HILL LOOP - STRAND HILL, FERRIS CREEK TRAIL, #407, 408, 556,
402 (note: Ferris is proposed to be closed to all user groups) This
loop connects Brush Creek to Ferris Creek and #409 and makes an ideal
loop that accesses Middle Brush Creek. This trail was created by
motorcycles and has been used continuously for over 25 years.

FERRIS CREEK TRAIL This trail has been used for decades to access
other trails in the area. Namely, Strand Hill, 407,408, 402, 556,
Middle Brush Creek and Tiocalli Ridge Trail UNNAMED TRAIL LINKING STAR
TRAIL (MYSTERIOUS LAKE) #411 TO UPPER SPRING CREEK ROAD #880This trail
was created in approximately 1980 to allow a loop from the Star Trail
back to the Spring Creek area. This trail does not show up on new USFS
map.

TRAILS #423 AND #423 SPUR (NOW RENAMED TRAIL) #559 AND #560These
trails have been used continuously by motorized users since 1982.
Although the access has been hampered by an ideal access to the trail
due to private property, the trail has had uninterrupted use for over
25 years. In fact, the official recorded plat for the Cement Creek
subdivision of Cement Creek at Crested Butte South recorded Jan 2,
1991, there is a provision for homeowners to access the forest service
via motorcycles. That spur (#560) starts on Cement Creek and hooks
into the Roaring Judy Trail along with the main trunk of Trail #423
that does so approx. .25 miles south of where the spur hooks in. There
is the connecting trail that links these to from Eccher Gulch to lower
Cement Mountain that does not even show on the latest USFS mapping.

UNNAMED TRAIL LINKING MIDDLE BRUSH CREEK ROAD BACK TO THE PEARL PASS
ROAD OVER TIMBERED/CARBONATE HILL Near the access point to Twin Lakes.
This trail has been used since 1980 and has seen more use in the past
few years as a side trail for riders going over Pearl Pass. This trail
does not show on latest USFS map.

UNNAMED TRAIL LINKING KEBLER PASS TO OHIO PASS NOW NAMED TRAILS #565
and 566This trail was developed in the mid-1990s by the Colorado 500
to allow access to the Ohio Creek corridor without having to go over
Ohio Pass or Highway 135.

UNNAMED TRAIL PARALLELING CEMENT CREEK ROAD BETWEEN HUNTER HILL #410
AND WATERFALL CREEK TRAIL This trail is unmarked on the new USFS map
and has historically been used to get from one end of Cement Creek to
the other without having to ride the road. This would be a great
loss.

WATERFALL CREEK TRAIL CONNECTS CEMENT CREEK ROAD WITH LOWER DOUBLETOP
Does not show on new USFS map. UNNAMED TRAIL FROM SPRING CREEK
RESERVOIR ROAD TRAIL #880 TO ITALIAN MT. ROAD This connecting trail
was created in 1983 to connect Italian Mountain Road back down to the
Spring Creek area initially for an enduro loop. Since then, it has
been used heavily and serves as a loop back from Star Trail at the
Lapis Mine or Flag Creek. It is not shown on the new USFS map.

TRAIL #561 EYRE BASIN This is a difficult trail that connect Italian
Pass with Taylor River Road. SOUTH OF HIGHWAY 50 The areas south of
Highway 50, (for both BLM and FS) appear to have been ignored for
expanded OHV recreation opportunities. We saw no additional trails or
4wd roads added to the recreation spectrum of opportunities in this
area. Routes that were suggested to be considered in the TMP proposal
were not included. The FS did say that some areas may be included
during &quot;concept&quot; planning, but that no user generated or user input
into the TMP was going to be considered for any new OHV recreation
applications. We find this in direct conflict with the Travel
Management Rule, as it does not meet the cooperative or collaborative
spirit for considering OHV recreation options. Other Trails in
Question which need feedback. TRAIL #759 TRAIL #880 TRAIL #413 CANAL
TRAIL STRAND BONUS #402 WALROD CUTOFF TRAIL

I have heard that the Gunnison Spur Colorado Trail at the North Bank
campground trailhead (on the Taylor River next to CR742, just east of
Almont) is also on the list. My understanding is that the noise
generated by motorcycles climbing the switchbacks where the trail
begins has generated complaints from campers. I can appreciate that
completely. As an alternative to closing this excellent trail
altogether, I would propose revising the starting point of the climb.
If possible, maybe there is a way to redirect the trail further up or
downstream from the campground, where motorcycles could start their
climb out of earshot from campers. I to camp many weekends throughout
the year. I am well aware of numerous other campgrounds in the area
that are non motorized. I don't think these few campers should have
such a loud voice over so many dirt bikers who are only there for a
few minutes.

I hope you will consider my comments and keep me informed. I would be
willing to schedule a trip to Colorado for the purpose of working or
helping as needed if it will help keep these trails open.

Thank you for your hard work and please feel free to have anyone
contact me if they would like more information.

The scariest part of the whole thing is the CDNST (Continental Divide
National Scenic Trail).  Coming soon, to a trail near you :-/
