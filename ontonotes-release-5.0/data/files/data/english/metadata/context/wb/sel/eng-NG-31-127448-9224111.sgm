Ray has posted 81 messages on t.o. since Oct. 10th. That can only mean he is
finished with his paper but doesn't want to publish. He would not be wasting
so much time on useless posting if he had more work to do on his paper,
would he?

His postings have become utterly boring and I don't care to read any of them
any more, I just count them. He never address real issues, he has got this
bizarre preoccupation with other peoples opinions, motives and religions -
or absence of same. But facts, seems he doesn't even know the difference
between cinnamon and ratshit.

He's waiting to draw a crowd at his signing party.

So far, the gathering swarm eager to read his paper
seems to be invisibly distant.

I was sort of guessing he'd release it in sync with
the US release of the movie &quot;I Am Legion&quot; just to
see how many irony meters he can break. Besides,
that's my birthday, so I'd be torn between watching
the premier of yet another SciFi movie that butchers
a book I've read and loved, or reading Ray's paper
that butchers that thing called &quot;sweet reason&quot; I

I cannot write his paper for him, but I can probably provide a rough
summary.  It would look something like this.

Atheist Evolutionists seek a materialist explanation of origins, but
they are not merely wasting their time but are actively deluding
themselves as Our Lord Jesus Christ created the world and everything
in it.  Therefore evolution is incorrect.  Nyaa nyaa nyaa.  I mean,
&quot;Amen.&quot;

Summary?

It *is* Ray's *whole paper*!

Management summary would be:

&quot;Our Lord Jesus created the world based on Dr. Scott's instructions to him. Therefore evolution is incorrect&quot;.

He quite the group, sometime in 2006 IIRC, promising not to post until
just before his paper was ready for publication. It didn't last long.
He earned the title Dishonest Ray because he even went as far as to
invent a brother to post here so he could break his oath not to post
to TO until his mythical paper is ready. I'm sure someone can give you

Oh, he's real alright!

Dr. Gene Scott, Pastoring Teacher of the University Cathedral in
Los Angeles, California. He teaches on subjects ranging from Basic
Christianity, to Atlantis, to the Pyramids.  His PhD is in
Philosophy of Education from Stanford University.

Read &quot;Maverick Evangelist&quot; OBITUARY: GENE SCOTT, PHD ¹57, 1929-2005
Stanford Magazine, May-June, 2005

http://www.stanfordalumni.org/news/magazine/2005/mayjun/classnotes/
scott.html

Excerpts:

&quot;Scott became famous for a TV ministry that mixed exhaustive
examination of Bible passages with relentless demands for donations.
His broadcasts showcased his passion for horses, cigars, comely women
and profanity. To ensure that telecasts weren¹t disrupted, attendance
at Sunday sermons required an advance ticket. He recoiled from the
designation televangelist, however.&quot;

&quot;Travis [Mark Travis -- the preacher's chief of staff] considers
Scott¹s flamboyant TV persona a shtick to draw viewers, who would then
linger for the sermons. And draw viewers it did: in a 1994 Los Angeles
Times article, their tithes were estimated at more than $1 million per
month. His faithful wrote on their checks that the funds could be used
in any way Scott saw fit, thus thwarting FCC inquiries into church
finances. His salary of $1 per year plus unlimited expenses allowed
him to live handsomely, collecting stamps, art, Bible texts, show
horses and coins. Scott once said that if he were stranded on a desert
island, God would provide a market for sand. He was profiled in a 1980
documentary, God¹s Angry Man, by Werner Herzog, and lampooned on
Saturday Night Live by Robin Williams.&quot;

&quot;Critics called him a cult leader, pompous and an embarrassment to the
Christian church. Evangelical Christian ethicist David Gill says Scott
³appealed to angry people who identified with his outlaw image.² In
the Hereafter, Scott told followers, he planned to ³punch Adam in the
mouth² for all the trouble he caused mankind.&quot;

Here's a piece by Los Angeles Times writer Glenn Bunting:

http://gonsalves.org/favorite/scott/scott.htm

&quot;Partially obscured by cigar smoke, the face appears puffed with rage
and ready to explode. Piercing blue eyes stare through half-framed
reading specs and gold-rimmed shades, worn one on top of the other. A
mouthful of perfectly aligned, pearl-white teeth sneers behind a wispy
beard. Shocking white hair stands out each night from under assorted
head wear--a Stetson, a Stanford cap, a crown, even a sombrero.

This bizarre visage lures television viewers to Dr. Gene Scott, pastor
and supreme leader of the Los Angeles University Cathedral. But it is
his provocative, profanity-laced monologues that keep them tuning in.
Scott's eclectic broadcast mixes high-voltage Scripture and obnoxious
solicitations (for money, naturally) with taped footage of his
church's world-champion American saddlebred show horses prancing to
the tunes of Sinatra and Springsteen. Toss in heavy doses of call-in
hero worship from South Africa to Santa Barbara along with amusing
commentary on current events and the result is a sort of religious
Rush Limbaugh.

&quot;Nuke 'em in the name of Jesus!&quot; Scott ranted during the Gulf War,
boasting that he was the only minister urging President Bush to bomb
Iraq. Recently, after three years of extensive dental work, Scott
joked to his congregation that &quot;there'll be fewer weeks in 1994 that I
come here wanting to kill. So, get on the telephone!&quot;

&quot;Get on the telephone!&quot; is Scott's favorite bark. It's his way of
ordering the faithful to send cash. And send they do, more than $1
million a month, according to some estimates.&quot;

from the Pasadena Star News:

Dr. Gene Scott Dead at 75
Pasadena Star-News

First the good doctor Hunter S. Thompson and now the crazed out
whacked-in-the-head enigmatic mega broadcaster doctor Gene Scott is gone.

For those of you who were never bored enough to actually sit through
any of Dr. Scott's television, and that is probably most of you, he
was a sight to see. Dr. Scott was a megalomaniac who would smoke
cigars, talk about UFOs and the Lost Tribe, berate his audience for
not sending enough money in, and come up with complex graphical
biblical teaching on a big white dry erase board. When he got tired of
talking he'd run video loops of his horses running around or other
similar nonesense.

Dr. Scott was the pastor of the Los Angeles University Cathedral but
he was so much more than this. In the past few decades most
televangelists have been easily identifiable as cheap hucksters and
hypocrites with very simple business models that prey on the weak --
folks like Jim Bakker, Pat Robertson, Jerry Falwell and Jimmy
Swaggart. Dr. Scott preyed on the weak as well but he was never as
easy to figure out and remained a constant enigma to those who might
run across him while channel surfing UHF back before cable or
satellite tv. He was a Stanford educated preacher who definitely had
more than a few screws loose.

If you can get the kids out of the room, take a look at this YouTube

If somebody should be in the need of a new hobby, he might be able to
preeempt the publication of Ray's paper by writing it for him; the summary
provided by RAF is as god an introduction as any. For the body of the paper,
Ray has spilled his guts all over t.o. providing all the material needed.
What else could he have to say that he has not already said 1001 times? All
we may be missing is his 'Eureka moment' but I am not losing any sleep over
it.

&gt; Oh, he's real alright!

&gt;     Dr. Gene Scott, Pastoring Teacher of the University Cathedral in
&gt;     Los Angeles, California. He teaches on subjects ranging from Basic
&gt;     Christianity, to Atlantis, to the Pyramids.  His PhD is in
&gt;     Philosophy of Education from Stanford University.

&gt; Read &quot;Maverick Evangelist&quot; OBITUARY: GENE SCOTT, PHD ¹57, 1929-2005
&gt; Stanford Magazine, May-June, 2005

&gt; http://www.stanfordalumni.org/news/magazine/2005/mayjun/classnotes/
&gt; scott.html

&gt; Excerpts:

&gt; &quot;Scott became famous for a TV ministry that mixed exhaustive
&gt; examination of Bible passages with relentless demands for donations.
&gt; His broadcasts showcased his passion for horses, cigars, comely women
&gt; and profanity. To ensure that telecasts weren¹t disrupted, attendance
&gt; at Sunday sermons required an advance ticket. He recoiled from the
&gt; designation televangelist, however.&quot;

&gt; &quot;Travis [Mark Travis -- the preacher's chief of staff] considers
&gt; Scott¹s flamboyant TV persona a shtick to draw viewers, who would then
&gt; linger for the sermons. And draw viewers it did: in a 1994 Los Angeles
&gt; Times article, their tithes were estimated at more than $1 million per
&gt; month. His faithful wrote on their checks that the funds could be used
&gt; in any way Scott saw fit, thus thwarting FCC inquiries into church
&gt; finances. His salary of $1 per year plus unlimited expenses allowed
&gt; him to live handsomely, collecting stamps, art, Bible texts, show
&gt; horses and coins. Scott once said that if he were stranded on a desert
&gt; island, God would provide a market for sand. He was profiled in a 1980
&gt; documentary, God¹s Angry Man, by Werner Herzog, and lampooned on
&gt; Saturday Night Live by Robin Williams.&quot;

&gt; &quot;Critics called him a cult leader, pompous and an embarrassment to the
&gt; Christian church. Evangelical Christian ethicist David Gill says Scott
&gt; ³appealed to angry people who identified with his outlaw image.² In
&gt; the Hereafter, Scott told followers, he planned to ³punch Adam in the
&gt; mouth² for all the trouble he caused mankind.&quot;

&gt; Here's a piece by Los Angeles Times writer Glenn Bunting:

&gt; http://gonsalves.org/favorite/scott/scott.htm

&gt; &quot;Partially obscured by cigar smoke, the face appears puffed with rage
&gt; and ready to explode. Piercing blue eyes stare through half-framed
&gt; reading specs and gold-rimmed shades, worn one on top of the other. A
&gt; mouthful of perfectly aligned, pearl-white teeth sneers behind a wispy
&gt; beard. Shocking white hair stands out each night from under assorted
&gt; head wear--a Stetson, a Stanford cap, a crown, even a sombrero.

&gt; This bizarre visage lures television viewers to Dr. Gene Scott, pastor
&gt; and supreme leader of the Los Angeles University Cathedral. But it is
&gt; his provocative, profanity-laced monologues that keep them tuning in.
&gt; Scott's eclectic broadcast mixes high-voltage Scripture and obnoxious
&gt; solicitations (for money, naturally) with taped footage of his
&gt; church's world-champion American saddlebred show horses prancing to
&gt; the tunes of Sinatra and Springsteen. Toss in heavy doses of call-in
&gt; hero worship from South Africa to Santa Barbara along with amusing
&gt; commentary on current events and the result is a sort of religious
&gt; Rush Limbaugh.

&gt; &quot;Nuke 'em in the name of Jesus!&quot; Scott ranted during the Gulf War,
&gt; boasting that he was the only minister urging President Bush to bomb
&gt; Iraq. Recently, after three years of extensive dental work, Scott
&gt; joked to his congregation that &quot;there'll be fewer weeks in 1994 that I
&gt; come here wanting to kill. So, get on the telephone!&quot;

&gt; &quot;Get on the telephone!&quot; is Scott's favorite bark. It's his way of
&gt; ordering the faithful to send cash. And send they do, more than $1
&gt; million a month, according to some estimates.&quot;

&gt; For those of you who were never bored enough to actually sit through
&gt; any of Dr. Scott's television, and that is probably most of you, he
&gt; was a sight to see. Dr. Scott was a megalomaniac who would smoke
&gt; cigars, talk about UFOs and the Lost Tribe, berate his audience for
&gt; not sending enough money in, and come up with complex graphical
&gt; biblical teaching on a big white dry erase board. When he got tired of
&gt; talking he'd run video loops of his horses running around or other
&gt; similar nonesense.

&gt; Dr. Scott was the pastor of the Los Angeles University Cathedral but
&gt; he was so much more than this. In the past few decades most
&gt; televangelists have been easily identifiable as cheap hucksters and
&gt; hypocrites with very simple business models that prey on the weak --
&gt; folks like Jim Bakker, Pat Robertson, Jerry Falwell and Jimmy
&gt; Swaggart. Dr. Scott preyed on the weak as well but he was never as
&gt; easy to figure out and remained a constant enigma to those who might
&gt; run across him while channel surfing UHF back before cable or
&gt; satellite tv. He was a Stanford educated preacher who definitely had
&gt; more than a few screws loose.

Thanks Earle. That was absolutely hilarious.

&gt; &gt; &gt; There are 3 possible answers to G. Scott PhD:
&gt; &gt; &gt; 1. Either the Stanford is a 5th rated college
&gt; &gt; &gt; 2. Or Scott make a false claim
&gt; &gt; &gt; 3. And possibly a fake certificate he picked up from India or there
&gt; &gt; &gt; was a Stanford

&gt; &gt; It could be a perfectly genuine PhD from a good University. Having a
&gt; &gt; PhD is no guarantee of moral rectitude, and just because you have a
&gt; &gt; PhD doesn't mean that you can't be an out-and-out con-man.

&gt; I'm so relieved to hear that.

&gt; &gt; I suppose I've missed the revelation, but has anyone confirmed the
&gt; &gt; existence and writings of Gene Scott?

&gt; *
&gt; Oh, he's real alright!

&gt;     Dr. Gene Scott, Pastoring Teacher of the University Cathedral in
&gt;     Los Angeles, California. He teaches on subjects ranging from Basic
&gt;     Christianity, to Atlantis, to the Pyramids.  His PhD is in
&gt;     Philosophy of Education from Stanford University.

&gt; Read &quot;Maverick Evangelist&quot; OBITUARY: GENE SCOTT, PHD ¹57, 1929-2005
&gt; Stanford Magazine, May-June, 2005

&gt; http://www.stanfordalumni.org/news/magazine/2005/mayjun/classnotes/
&gt; scott.html

&gt; Excerpts:

&gt; &quot;Scott became famous for a TV ministry that mixed exhaustive
&gt; examination of Bible passages with relentless demands for donations.
&gt; His broadcasts showcased his passion for horses, cigars, comely women
&gt; and profanity. To ensure that telecasts weren¹t disrupted, attendance
&gt; at Sunday sermons required an advance ticket. He recoiled from the
&gt; designation televangelist, however.&quot;

&gt; &quot;Travis [Mark Travis -- the preacher's chief of staff] considers
&gt; Scott¹s flamboyant TV persona a shtick to draw viewers, who would then
&gt; linger for the sermons. And draw viewers it did: in a 1994 Los Angeles
&gt; Times article, their tithes were estimated at more than $1 million per
&gt; month. His faithful wrote on their checks that the funds could be used
&gt; in any way Scott saw fit, thus thwarting FCC inquiries into church
&gt; finances. His salary of $1 per year plus unlimited expenses allowed
&gt; him to live handsomely, collecting stamps, art, Bible texts, show
&gt; horses and coins. Scott once said that if he were stranded on a desert
&gt; island, God would provide a market for sand. He was profiled in a 1980
&gt; documentary, God¹s Angry Man, by Werner Herzog, and lampooned on
&gt; Saturday Night Live by Robin Williams.&quot;

&gt; &quot;Critics called him a cult leader, pompous and an embarrassment to the
&gt; Christian church. Evangelical Christian ethicist David Gill says Scott
&gt; ³appealed to angry people who identified with his outlaw image.² In
&gt; the Hereafter, Scott told followers, he planned to ³punch Adam in the
&gt; mouth² for all the trouble he caused mankind.&quot;

&gt; Here's a piece by Los Angeles Times writer Glenn Bunting:

&gt; http://gonsalves.org/favorite/scott/scott.htm

&gt; &quot;Partially obscured by cigar smoke, the face appears puffed with rage
&gt; and ready to explode. Piercing blue eyes stare through half-framed
&gt; reading specs and gold-rimmed shades, worn one on top of the other. A
&gt; mouthful of perfectly aligned, pearl-white teeth sneers behind a wispy
&gt; beard. Shocking white hair stands out each night from under assorted
&gt; head wear--a Stetson, a Stanford cap, a crown, even a sombrero.

&gt; This bizarre visage lures television viewers to Dr. Gene Scott, pastor
&gt; and supreme leader of the Los Angeles University Cathedral. But it is
&gt; his provocative, profanity-laced monologues that keep them tuning in.
&gt; Scott's eclectic broadcast mixes high-voltage Scripture and obnoxious
&gt; solicitations (for money, naturally) with taped footage of his
&gt; church's world-champion American saddlebred show horses prancing to
&gt; the tunes of Sinatra and Springsteen. Toss in heavy doses of call-in
&gt; hero worship from South Africa to Santa Barbara along with amusing
&gt; commentary on current events and the result is a sort of religious
&gt; Rush Limbaugh.

&gt; &quot;Nuke 'em in the name of Jesus!&quot; Scott ranted during the Gulf War,
&gt; boasting that he was the only minister urging President Bush to bomb
&gt; Iraq. Recently, after three years of extensive dental work, Scott
&gt; joked to his congregation that &quot;there'll be fewer weeks in 1994 that I
&gt; come here wanting to kill. So, get on the telephone!&quot;

&gt; &quot;Get on the telephone!&quot; is Scott's favorite bark. It's his way of
&gt; ordering the faithful to send cash. And send they do, more than $1
&gt; million a month, according to some estimates.&quot;

Which, it seems, proves that he was just as good as Ray claims all the
time - but maybe not in the way that Ray thinks...

&gt; Dr. Gene Scott Dead at 75
&gt; Pasadena Star-News

&gt; First the good doctor Hunter S. Thompson and now the crazed out
&gt; whacked-in-the-head enigmatic mega broadcaster doctor Gene Scott is gone.

&gt; For those of you who were never bored enough to actually sit through
&gt; any of Dr. Scott's television, and that is probably most of you, he
&gt; was a sight to see. Dr. Scott was a megalomaniac who would smoke
&gt; cigars, talk about UFOs and the Lost Tribe, berate his audience for
&gt; not sending enough money in, and come up with complex graphical
&gt; biblical teaching on a big white dry erase board. When he got tired of
&gt; talking he'd run video loops of his horses running around or other
&gt; similar nonesense.

&gt; Dr. Scott was the pastor of the Los Angeles University Cathedral but
&gt; he was so much more than this. In the past few decades most
&gt; televangelists have been easily identifiable as cheap hucksters and
&gt; hypocrites with very simple business models that prey on the weak --
&gt; folks like Jim Bakker, Pat Robertson, Jerry Falwell and Jimmy
&gt; Swaggart. Dr. Scott preyed on the weak as well but he was never as
&gt; easy to figure out and remained a constant enigma to those who might
&gt; run across him while channel surfing UHF back before cable or
&gt; satellite tv. He was a Stanford educated preacher who definitely had
&gt; more than a few screws loose.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; incorrect.  Nyaa nyaa nyaa.  I mean, &quot;Amen.&quot;

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You missed a bit;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;And this is true because Gene Scott, who has two Stamford PhDs,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; says so.&quot;

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; To the best of my knowledge, Scott has one PhD from the School of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Education at Stanford (not Stamford).

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; earle

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There are 3 possible answers to G. Scott PhD:
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1. Either the Stanford is a 5th rated college
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2. Or Scott make a false claim
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 3. And possibly a fake certificate he picked up from India or there
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was a Stanford

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It could be a perfectly genuine PhD from a good University. Having a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; PhD is no guarantee of moral rectitude, and just because you have a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; PhD doesn't mean that you can't be an out-and-out con-man.

&gt; &gt; &gt; I'm so relieved to hear that.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;So far, the gathering swarm eager to read his paper
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;seems to be invisibly distant.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;I was sort of guessing he'd release it in sync with
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;the US release of the movie &quot;I Am Legion&quot; just to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;see how many irony meters he can break. Besides,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;that's my birthday, so I'd be torn between watching

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I cannot write his paper for him, but I can probably provide a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; rough summary.  It would look something like this.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Atheist Evolutionists seek a materialist explanation of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; origins, but they are not merely wasting their time but are
