That tends to be my point of view but I do essentially plan when
I do my weekly expedition to the supermarket (not that I refuse
to shop again). If I buy things like Chinese vegetables, I have
more or less committed myself to using them in the next few
days. I do buy prepared but uncooked entrees on the spur of the
moment at, what I will admit,  are &quot;gourmet&quot; stores :-)

I know exactly what you're saying.  I may wake up in the morning thinking
I'll make X for dinner.  By the time the dinner hour is approaching I've
decided I want something completely different.  I do keep a lot of staple
ingredients (and frozen veggies) on hand so whatever I decide on is usually
pretty simple in terms of last minute changes.

I know what you mean. I go on a shopping &quot;expedition&quot; about once a week
- here's what I do:
Check my list for the &quot;staples&quot; (e.g. salt, sugar, cooking oil, flour,
rice, milk, bread etc.) that need replenishing and restock on those. I
also go to the fresh veggie section, see what's on offer, then I mooch
over to the butchery and see &quot;what looks good&quot; in the way of roasts,
steaks, chickens etc. I often buy boerewors too - LOL!  I try and keep
away from the herbs and spices &lt;g&gt; I have so many already, but love
looking for anything 'new'... If I go near the fishmonger, I eyeball
what fresh fish is on offer there. (Damn - no sole today). I usually buy
enough stuff to make meals for the week, but then I &quot;play it by ear&quot;
from day to day, depending on what we feel like eating... I do forget
things sometimes, or decide to make something I find in one of my
cookbooks that I hadn't thought about when shopping, so I might have to
pop out to get the odd ingredients for that particular dish... Works for me.

My answers were all MCINL.  I most of the time
I make one thing on the weekend and then
eat it every day for a week or two (or three).
I always check the recipe or whatever about
one week beforehand to see if I have everything
on hand and if not I pick up what I need during
the week.  I do the same for special dinners for
family and friends, which are only a couple of
times a year.

I don't usually decide to make something on the
spur of the moment but when I do I often do not
have all of the ingredients on hand so I end up
not making it or postponing it till later (or trying
to make it with other ingredients or making something
for which I do have all the ingredients).  I don't
like to have to run out to the store at the last
moment to buy anything.

I don't keep a lot of things on hand most of the
time but buy them when I need them.  (Of course
I usually have staples like sugar, flour, etc.)
I almost never have milk on hand and I often crave
french toast and can't make it because of no milk.
So, lately I've been trying to buy milk even if I
have no use for it at the moment, hoping I'll then
have it on hand for spur-of-the-moment french toast
and also hoping that it will not have gone sour by
the time I get around to using it.

it is pretty much the same here. I do most of the cooking, so I do most of
the shopping. I have a pretty good idea of the state of our staples like
flour, sugar, butter. If I notice that we are running low on something I
make a mental note to pick some up on the next shopping excursion.  I
usually do my shopping on Fridays and get some fresh fish and something
special for Sunday dinner. My wife usually takes some meat out of the
freezer to defrost and when dinner time rolls around I figure out what I am
going to do with it. Occasionally we will take out some strewing beef to be
cooked up and then reheated the next day, and that is about the only time I
have to plan ahead.

My lip quivers a bit if I have to think of more than a couple of days
ahead.  Shelling out for a week's worth of food at the checkout line
also give me the willies, which could be my reason for such poor
planning.

I surprise myself often when I DO have all ingreeds on hand - we have
a joke here when dh asks for an ingredient and I intone &quot;Of course -
this is a well-run household&quot;.  He never fails to laugh.

Val - who did solve the run-out-of-milk situation tho - buy a gallon

No, not if it's good.  Sometimes I take a small break
and eat something else for one day, but I really don't
mind it at all.  Once in a while I make something new
that's not as good as it sounded, or I make something
that just doesn't turn out the best.  Then I sort of have
to force myself to finish it.  But it has to be really
bad before I will throw it out and waste food.

Anyway, I look at the benefits (cook once eat for
2 weeks) versus the drawbacks (eat the same thing every
night for 2 weeks).  Less work wins.  And if something
is really good, I crave more of it and can't wait to
eat again the next night.

Why not cook a few dishes at once but in quantities that allow for
freezing extra servings so that you can vary your diet more?
I can think of nothing duller than eating the same damn thing day after
