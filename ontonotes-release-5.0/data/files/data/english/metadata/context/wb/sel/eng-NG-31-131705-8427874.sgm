What a lesson in dynamics! We talk so much about notes and rhythms but
Joe's touch is what makes this one so great. I love how his right hand
continually moves along the fretboard (he barely touches the low E
string) to bring out the gradations in each phrase. Thanks Charlie.

This one also shows that things don't have to be highly complex Â in order to
be great.
