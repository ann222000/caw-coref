Greetings. Please bear with me, as an interesting revelation is about
to unfold - a revelation that will unveil not how history is made, but
how it is REPORTED, and who exerts influence on that reporting.

When one is studying history, one must obviously consider the
perspective of he who is reporting on that history. But more
importantly, one must consider the PRESSURES that are brought to bear
on those that are reporting said history - and the ways in which these
pressure influence what is finally reported and in turn read by the
consumer of that reporting.

The manipulations exposed in the following represent a minor symptom
of a MAJOR disease that has infiltrated and infected every aspect of
every level of &quot;history&quot;, and especially that of WWII and the events
that led to the founding of the Jewish State - not to mention
countless other incidents that have shaped our modern world.

First, I call your attention to TWO versions of ONE webpage at
Scrapbookpages.com - The first is the Google cached version of the
page, and the second is the page that was MODIFIED at the insistence
of the Semitist/Zionist Cabal.  Please pay particular attention to the
last two paragraphs of each page, as this is where the change was
implemented.

The ORIGINAL version, from Google cache:

http://tinyurl.com/2qd4wk

Compare this to the recently modified &quot;Jew Friendly&quot; version:

http://www.scrapbookpages.com/AuschwitzScrapbook/History/Articles/Hun...

Look quick, before  Jewish/Semitist/Zionist interests attack Google.
(Full text of each quoted at the end of this article)

In the alt.revisionsm, soc.culture.israel thread entitled &quot;Shawcross
on his deathbed&quot; Ben Cramer posted a quote from Sir Hartley Shawcross,
one of the Justices at the Neurember Nazi (show) trials. The quote was
from a 1984 speech that Shawcross gave at Stourbridge, and in the
speech, Shawcross lamented that the British had not sided with
Hitler's Germany during WWII, stating:

&quot;We ignored Hitler's pleading not to enter into war. Now we are forced
to realise that Hitler was right. He offered us the co-operation of
Germany: instead, since 1945, we have been facing the immense power of
the Soviet Empire.&quot;

http://groups.google.com/group/alt.revisionism/browse_frm/thread/7b42...

Predictably, the Zionists and Semitists that haunt these groups sensed
that such a statement coming from one of the justices at NUREMBERG
would be extremely damaging to the Semitist/Zionist cause, and
attacked the speech as a &quot;fraud&quot; and a &quot;forgery&quot;.

The basis for their claims? That the speech was to be found on
websites that they label as &quot;Jew hating&quot;, &quot;Revisionist&quot; and &quot;Holocaust
denying&quot;.

Being well aware of their slanderous tactics, I did a brief Google
search, and found the same Shawcross text quoted on
Scrapbookpages.com, which can hardly be called a  &quot;Jew hating&quot;,
&quot;Revisionist&quot; or &quot;Holocaust denying website, and indeed, is frequently
cited by Jews, Semitists and Zionists to BOLSTER their Holocaustic
agenda. I posted this link to the thread:

http://groups.google.com/group/alt.revisionism/msg/eab1a0835c83514f

Scrapbookpages.com attributed the quote to an Associated Press
article, and would certainly NEVER have posted it on their site had
they any qualms regarding its authenticity.

Distraught and disheveled by the fact that this &quot;fraudulent&quot;,
&quot;forged&quot; (and EXTREMELY DAMAGING) quote appeared on a &quot;reputable&quot;
webpage, the Semitist Machine went into action. Within 48 hours of my
posting the link to the &quot;offending&quot; Scrapbookpages.com page, the text
that offended the JEWS had been REMOVED. Someone from the Semitist/
Zionist camp had obviously contacted the webmaster of
scrapbookpages.com, and either convinced or COERCED them into removing
the &quot;offending&quot; material.

Furthermore, the page, which had been modified less than two days
earlier, had a notation at the bottom indicating that it hadn't been
modified since January 10, 2007, which was clearly a falsehood.

Look at the above links while they're intact, as it may well be that
the Google (which has been known to bend to the will of strident
Jewish whinings in the past) will shortly modify said cache, or delete
it entirely.

What does this tell us? What conclusion should we draw from the
lengths that Jewish/Semitist/Zionist interests are willing to go to
protect the gains that they have made at such GREAT costs to others -
the cost of tens upon tens of millions of lives, of two world wars,
multiple regional conflicts and numerous revolutions, all to promote
and protect the aims of an insignificantly tiny minority of the
Earth's population?

It should tell us that there IS no price that these reprobates would
consider too high to pay to fulfill their goals - particularly when
that price is paid in the form of the toil, gold and sweat of OTHERS.

Below is my post in the thread &quot;Shawcross on his deathbed&quot;, in which I
responded to one who calls himself &quot;Richard Warren&quot;, exposing the
manipulation of Scrapbookpages.com by &quot;Warren&quot; and/or his Semitist/
Zionist cohorts.

Below that you'll find the complete text of the Scrapbookpages.com
article - both the original version (from google.cache) and the Jew-
friendly version that was modified as the result of Jewish/Semitist
meddling.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; So where's the Holocaust denial?

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Was there meant to be any Holocaust denial, troughlicker?-

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Then why did you quote him, Aussie faggot? You must have been trying
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; to make a point.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I believe I did.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; No, you didn't.  You took his speech out of context and tried to make
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; him into a Holocaust denier, which, of course, he wasn't.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; In 1940, Hitler had wanted an alliance with Britain so he could finish
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; off &quot;Jewish Bolshevik&quot; Russia without interference, but Churchill had
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; just been elected and all he got was the cold shoulder.  Hitler's
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; offer to Britain was:  &quot;You can have your Empire; just give us the
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Continent. Ally yourselves with us.  Be on the winning side.&quot;  The
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; British reply was: &quot;No deal, gangster.&quot;

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Shawcross, in 1984, thought that Britain should have taken the deal
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; and allied itself with Nazi Germany.  Perhaps Shawcross thought that
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; if Britain had been a Nazi ally, it would have preserved the Empire.
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Perhaps he was simply switching political loyalties to cement his ties
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; to business.  Or perhaps both reasons were true.  But then again,
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Shawcross isn't important. He's just a latter-day John Dos Passos---
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; switching allegiances so he can be on the winning side.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Shawcross was an idiot, but no Holocaust denier.  Too bad for you and
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; all the other idiots who take his words out of context and post them
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; on neo-Nazi websites.  I do believe it's time for you to be carried
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; out to sea in a rip current, to get eaten by a shark.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Lisa

&gt; &gt;&gt; Sorry but, once again, Shawcross made no such speech - not in Stourbridge
&gt; &gt;&gt; or
&gt; &gt;&gt; any other place, not in 1984 or any other year.

&gt; &gt; And you base this statement on what, Warrenski? That you don't like
&gt; &gt; what was said?  That you don't like the websites where the text can be
&gt; &gt; found?

&gt; &gt; Substantiate your allegation.

You neglected to mention that you (or one of your Semitist cohorts)
ALSO contacted scrapbookpages.com, and either convinced or coerced
them to REMOVE the Shawcross text that I dug up and quoted earlier -
POOF- GONE like the six million &quot;missing Jews&quot;.

Now I suppose you think you can crow that &quot;no such text exists&quot; on
Scrapbookpages.com. and presume to call me a liar, right Warren?

Have you good connections at Google? Well you'd better get dialing
fast, because below are links to scrapbookpages site AFTER you and/or
your meddling Semitist cohorts coerced them into deleting the text,
AND google's CACHED version, which shows the text INTACT.

At the bottom of the modified page is a LIE, stating that the page was
last updated on January 10, 2007. It was in fact updated yesterday or
today - September 27, 2007.

Here's the Jew-meddled link:

You are a gem, Waldo. A brilliant piece of detective work, and a brilliant
example of the lack of honesty and integrity these horrid people possess.
They must protect their myth at all cost, no matter the deceit and
skullduggery involved.

The Scrapbookpages link you provide below, is already gone, giving a &quot;IE
cannot load this page&quot; error.

It remains to be seen how the &quot;experts&quot; explain this away.

I look forward to comments from Keenan, Oy Vey I and II, and particularly
Holman.

Twatty and Salzman will no doubt simply parrot their &quot;You're a liar - It's a
forgery&quot; mantra.

Again - Great work. I've archived this for future reference.

&gt; There were many views on Hitler before and after the war, and, knowing

&gt; about Hitler and Nazism in his marathon five-hour speech at the
&gt; Nuremberg Trials in 1946, would certainly have had the right to express
&gt; a different view in 1984, when the Cold war was still very much a
&gt; reality, even if claiming that &quot;Hitler was right&quot; does seem to be an
&gt; exterme reversal. The problem is determining whether the quote is
&gt; authentic.

&gt; I checked out David Irving's site dealing with Lord Shawcross,
&gt; http://www.fpp.co.uk/History/Nuremberg/Times110703.html , and was
&gt; surprised that no mention made of the speech in the obituary posted
&gt; there. Nor was any commentary added by Irving concerning the alleged
&gt; speech even though, if true, it was clearly in the spirit of many of
&gt; Irving's writings at the time, which often showed a certain degree of
&gt; sympathy for Hitler and his aims.

&gt; A little bit of detective work indicated that the source of the quote is
&gt; allegedly an Associated Press release of March 16, 1984. A look at the
&gt; microfilmed copies of *The Times (London)* and the *Economist* for March
&gt; 15 to 25, 1984 revealed no mention of such a speech, although one would
&gt; suspect that so radical a reversal of opinion by such a prominent
&gt; personality as Lord Shawcross, even if by then a relatively old man of
&gt; 82, would have given rise to some comment, at least in the form of a
&gt; letter to the editor or a small news item. I did not, unfortunately,
&gt; have the resources to access the Associated Press archives for the date
&gt; in question to see if there was indeed such a press release.

&gt; On the other hand, further investigation revealed the following:

&gt; &lt;quote&gt;
&gt; &lt;deletions&gt;
&gt; One of our readers has informed us of this:

&gt; The Times (London ), March 13, 1948, p. 4, reports:
&gt; &quot;SINISTER AIMS OF COMMUNISM SIR H. SHAWCROSS ON WESTERN UNION Sir
&gt; Hartley Shawcross, the Attorney-General, speaking at Stourbridge last
&gt; night [March 12th], said that recent tragic events in Czechoslovakia
&gt; [communist putsch followed by suicide of Masaryk] had brought a new
&gt; sense of urgency to the movement for western union. [...] SAME NAZI
&gt; TECHNIQUE [...] Step by stepp I have been forced more and more to the
&gt; conclusion that the aims of Communism in Europe are sinister and deadly
&gt; aims. I prosecuted the Nazis in Nuremberg. With my Russian colleagues I
&gt; condemned Nazi aggression and Nazi terror. I feel shame and humiliation
&gt; now to see under a different name the same aims pursued, the same
&gt; technique followed, without check. [...]&quot;

&gt; This Times article does not claim to be based on an AP press release,
&gt; nor does it contain the following sentences, sometimes quoted with other
&gt; wording:

&gt; &quot;I believe now that Hitler and the German People did not want war. But
&gt; we declared war on Germany, intent on destroying her. In this we were
&gt; encouraged by the Jews around Roosevelt. This was said to be in
&gt; accordance with our principle of the 'Balance of Power'. We ignored
&gt; Hitler's pleading not to enter into war. Now we are forced to realize
&gt; that Hitler was right. He offered us the co-operation of Germany.
&gt; Instead, since 1945, we have been facing the immense power of the Soviet
&gt; Empire.&quot;

&gt; I will keep looking in the media of these days for other press
&gt; clippings, also for an AP release, if there was one. If it exists, it is
&gt; more likely to have been on March 12, 1948, rather than March 16. The
&gt; often quoted year 1984 is an obvious result of a digit swap.
&gt; &lt;deletions&gt;
&gt; &lt;/quote&gt;

&gt; I was able to verify this by checking the microfilmed copy of the *Times
&gt; (London) for March 13, 1948, page 4. Mention is made there of a speech
&gt; by Lord Shawcross given on March 12, 1948 at Stourbridge, and of the
&gt; fact that he referred to prosecuting the Nazis at Nuremberg and of
&gt; condemning &quot;Nazi aggression and Nazi terror&quot;, methods he accuses the
&gt; Soviets of using with respect to the then recent events in
&gt; Czechoslovakia that he was commenting on. It would be strange indeed for
&gt; him to continue such a speech by claiming that &quot;Now we are forced to
&gt; realize that Hitler was right.&quot;, nor does the article contain these
&gt; words or the rest of the paragraph in the alleged quotation beginning:
&gt; &quot;I believe now that Hitler and the German People did not want war.&quot;

&gt;&gt; The Scrapbookpages link you provide below, is already gone, giving a &quot;IE
&gt;&gt; cannot load this page&quot; error.

&gt;&gt; It remains to be seen how the &quot;experts&quot; explain this away.

&gt;&gt; I look forward to comments from Keenan, Oy Vey I and II, and particularly
&gt;&gt; Holman.

&gt;&gt; Twatty and Salzman will no doubt simply parrot their &quot;You're a liar -
&gt;&gt; It's a
&gt;&gt; forgery&quot; mantra.

&gt;&gt; Again - Great work. I've archived this for future reference.

&gt; So, a trip to the library and less than an hour's work reveals that:

&gt; - there is no mention in the British quality press of Lord Shawcross
&gt; having made a speech at Stourbridge, England, containing the words in
&gt; question on March 16, 1984, nor does there seem to be any Associated
&gt; Press release telling of such a speech.

&gt; - I checked the *New York Times* as well, and found no reference to such
&gt; a speech within the interval March 17 - 27, 1984.

&gt; - David Irving, who loves this kind of materal and would certainly
&gt; exploit it if it were genuine, makes no reference to such a speech at
&gt; his webpages devoted to Lord Shawcross.

&gt; - Lord Shawcross did, according to the March 13, 1948 *Times [London]*,
&gt; make a speech at Stourbridge on March 12, 1948, in which some of the
&gt; phrases in the alleged quote were used. There is no mention in the news
&gt; item, which the *Times* does not ascribe to the Associated Press, about
&gt; being forced to any realization that &quot;Hitler was right&quot;.

&gt; My conclusion is that the quote is a clumsy forgery, with manipulated
&gt; dates and words added, to drive a specific agenda. Speaking in 1948 and
&gt; using some of the phraseology in the alleged quote, Lord Shawcross was
&gt; not claiming that we had come to a realization that &quot;Hitler was right&quot;,
&gt; but rather that the Soviets, still allies in 1946, were capable of the
&gt; type of terror and aggression that he and his Russian colleagues had so
&gt; soundly condemned in 1946.

&gt; As to the manipulated websites, I haven't a clue to who might have
&gt; changed it or why. My hunch would be that someone pointed out that the
&gt; quotation ascribed to Lord Shawcross is most likely bogus, and that it
&gt; was removed by a webmaster who was sloppy about updating the information
&gt; about the last modification.

&gt; Imagining this to be yet another plot by the &quot;horrid&quot; Jews to maintain
&gt; their &quot;myth&quot; is, in my view, a paranoid conclusion. Lord Shawcross never
&gt; changed his view that Hitler and the Nazis were criminals, or that their
&gt; actions were justified. The 1948 speech expressed his view that the
&gt; Soviets, with which he had cooperated in 1946 when condemning the Nazis,
&gt; were every bit as evil. The existence of a speech given by Lord
&gt; Shawcross at the same place in 1984 cannot be verified, nor does there
&gt; seem to be any mention of the controversy that a speech with such
&gt; content given by such a prominent person in the quality British or
&gt; American press during the latter half of March, 1984.

You carped about my manner of introducing the issue, but failed comment
on my actual findings and analysis. I began by commenting on the Irving
trial because, there, as here, it is not necessarily the Jews who had
the most or even anything to gain in either case. The issues at stake,
however, are precisely the same.

Despite what you claim about the Irving trial being a Jewish effort to
silence David Irving, the primary issue being scrutinized there was the
responsibility of the professional community of historians to blow the
whistle on a pseudo-professional who gains is reputation by purposely
peddling lies based on fiddling with dates and manipulating quotes to
serve a political agenda as &quot;real history&quot;. It was not &quot;the Jews&quot;, but
the professional community of historians, some of them Jews, like
Deborah Lipstadt, but many of them not, like Richard Evans and
Christopher Browning, who were blowing the whistle on malpractice and
unacceptable professional conduct.

With respect to the alleged quote from a speech by Lord Shawcross, some
anonymous but responsible individuals have called attention to the fact
that there is no reliable record of Lord Shawcross ever having given a
speech at Stourbridge on March 16, 1984, or of his ever having publicly
pronounced anything about coming to a realization that Hitler was right.
Instead, the quotation in question bears all the evidence of being a
clumsy fabrication roughly based on a speech Lord Shawcross is known to
have given at Stourbridge on March 13, 1948 shortly after the communist
takeover in Czechoslovakia. In that speech Lord Shawcross made no claims
about Hitler being right, but rather accused the Soviets of using
precisely the same policies of aggression and terrorism and thus of
behaving in precisely the same manner as Hitler and the Nazis had done.

Thus, my fine feathered friend, my having made mention of the Irving
trial and of your kneejerk-like proclivity to blame anything and
everything on the Jews, was cogent to the issue.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

You did not comment on the fact that there appears to be no reference in
the quality newspapers of the time to, or any Associated Press release
of, the speech alleged to have been given by Lord Shawcross on March 16,
1984. There *is*, however, abundant evidence of a speech given by him on
March 12, 1948, in which some of the phraseology in the alleged 1984
quote appears, but as part of a very different argument. Nor did you
tell us why you think that it is specifically the Jews who would benefit
so much from removal of a quotation that not only bears all the marks of
being a forgery, but which also contradicts everything known about Lord
Shawcross's opinions about Hitler and Nazi Germany. The man lived for
eighteen year after 1984, and he was never known to have made public
statements apologizing for Hitler or Nazism.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Your pathetic attempt to detract from the involvement of the stinky yids

Anybody interested in honesty in general and in protecting the legacy of
the honorable Lord Shawcross in particular would react to such a
pernicious practice. Anybody who, like myself, detests seeing people try
to fool the gullible and historically naive by inventing sources,
fiddling with dates, and misquoting people in an effort to push an
agenda that cannot otherwise find support.  Of course that excludes you,
an aficionado of David Irving, the man who turned such charlatanry and
historical hi-jinks into a profession and art form.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; by bringing the totally off topic subject of

By not realizing that this is precisely the kind of crap that David
Irving got burned for you demonstrate brilliantly your lack of pattern
recognition abilities. You miss the forest because you are satisfied
with glancing superficially at the trees.

Thanks for the complement. Kudos to you, too. I detest tomfoolery, but I

&gt; You did not comment on the fact that there appears to be no reference in
&gt; the quality newspapers of the time to, or any Associated Press release
&gt; of, the speech alleged to have been given by Lord Shawcross on March 16,
&gt; 1984. There *is*, however, abundant evidence of a speech given by him on
&gt; March 12, 1948, in which some of the phraseology in the alleged 1984
&gt; quote appears, but as part of a very different argument. Nor did you
&gt; tell us why you think that it is specifically the Jews who would benefit
&gt; so much from removal of a quotation that not only bears all the marks of
&gt; being a forgery, but which also contradicts everything known about Lord
&gt; Shawcross's opinions about Hitler and Nazi Germany. The man lived for
&gt; eighteen year after 1984, and he was never known to have made public
&gt; statements apologizing for Hitler or Nazism.

&gt;&gt; Your pathetic attempt to detract from the involvement of the stinky yids
&gt;&gt; (who else could it be) laddie,

&gt; Anybody interested in honesty in general and in protecting the legacy of
&gt; the honorable Lord Shawcross in particular would react to such a
&gt; pernicious practice. Anybody who, like myself, detests seeing people try
&gt; to fool the gullible and historically naive by inventing sources,
&gt; fiddling with dates, and misquoting people in an effort to push an
&gt; agenda that cannot otherwise find support.  Of course that excludes you,
&gt; an aficionado of David Irving, the man who turned such charlatanry and
&gt; historical hi-jinks into a profession and art form.

&gt;&gt; by bringing the totally off topic subject of
&gt;&gt; the Irving trial into play, is a brilliant example of not only your
&gt;&gt; desperation and bad scholarship, but your fuckwittery and total lack of
&gt;&gt; integrity.

&gt; By not realizing that this is precisely the kind of crap that David
&gt; Irving got burned for you demonstrate brilliantly your lack of pattern
&gt; recognition abilities. You miss the forest because you are satisfied
&gt; with glancing superficially at the trees.

&gt;&gt; Well done.

&gt; Thanks for the complement. Kudos to you, too. I detest tomfoolery, but I
&gt; have to give recognition to a person who has honed his skills at it to a
&gt; professional level.

non-existent speech allegedly given by Lord Shawcross at Stourbridge on
March 16, 1984, spiced up with some misquotations and forged material

&gt;&gt; You are a gem, Waldo. A brilliant piece of detective work, and a
&gt;&gt; brilliant
&gt;&gt; example of the lack of honesty and integrity these horrid people possess.

&gt; There is no denying that the page was modified, but you do not know by
&gt; whom or why. Generically blaming it on &quot;the Jews&quot; is as silly as
&gt; claiming that &quot;the Jews&quot; &quot;browbeat&quot; and &quot;bamboozled&quot; Judge Charles Gray
&gt; into passing a verdict that a book, in your view, was &quot;libelous from
&gt; start to finish&quot; was not libelous at all.

&gt;&gt; They must protect their myth at all cost, no matter the deceit and
&gt;&gt; skullduggery involved.

&gt; There were many views on Hitler before and after the war, and, knowing
&gt; what an unprincipled gambler Hitler was, I have long known that Hitler
&gt; did not want war with the UK and was frankly surprised that the UK
&gt; actually lived up to its commitment to defend Poland after Germany's
&gt; Sept. 1, 1939 attack consequent to the fabricated border incident at
&gt; Gleiwitz. Lord Shawcross, who had some extremely negative things to say
&gt; about Hitler and Nazism in his marathon five-hour speech at the
&gt; Nuremberg Trials in 1946, would certainly have had the right to express
&gt; a different view in 1984, when the Cold war was still very much a
&gt; reality, even if claiming that &quot;Hitler was right&quot; does seem to be an
&gt; exterme reversal. The problem is determining whether the quote is
&gt; authentic.

&gt; I checked out David Irving's site dealing with Lord Shawcross,
&gt; http://www.fpp.co.uk/History/Nuremberg/Times110703.html , and was
&gt; surprised that no mention made of the speech in the obituary posted
&gt; there. Nor was any commentary added by Irving concerning the alleged
&gt; speech even though, if true, it was clearly in the spirit of many of
&gt; Irving's writings at the time, which often showed a certain degree of
&gt; sympathy for Hitler and his aims.

&gt; A little bit of detective work indicated that the source of the quote is
&gt; allegedly an Associated Press release of March 16, 1984. A look at the
&gt; microfilmed copies of *The Times (London)* and the *Economist* for March
&gt; 15 to 25, 1984 revealed no mention of such a speech, although one would
&gt; suspect that so radical a reversal of opinion by such a prominent
&gt; personality as Lord Shawcross, even if by then a relatively old man of
&gt; 82, would have given rise to some comment, at least in the form of a
&gt; letter to the editor or a small news item. I did not, unfortunately,
&gt; have the resources to access the Associated Press archives for the date
&gt; in question to see if there was indeed such a press release.

&gt; On the other hand, further investigation revealed the following:

&gt; Source:
&gt; http://www.geocities.com/gambanreidi.geo/SurprisingRevelation.html

&gt; &lt;quote&gt;
&gt; &lt;deletions&gt;
&gt; One of our readers has informed us of this:

&gt; The Times (London ), March 13, 1948, p. 4, reports:
&gt; &quot;SINISTER AIMS OF COMMUNISM SIR H. SHAWCROSS ON WESTERN UNION Sir
&gt; Hartley Shawcross, the Attorney-General, speaking at Stourbridge last
&gt; night [March 12th], said that recent tragic events in Czechoslovakia
&gt; [communist putsch followed by suicide of Masaryk] had brought a new
&gt; sense of urgency to the movement for western union. [...] SAME NAZI
&gt; TECHNIQUE [...] Step by stepp I have been forced more and more to the
&gt; conclusion that the aims of Communism in Europe are sinister and deadly
&gt; aims. I prosecuted the Nazis in Nuremberg. With my Russian colleagues I
&gt; condemned Nazi aggression and Nazi terror. I feel shame and humiliation
&gt; now to see under a different name the same aims pursued, the same
&gt; technique followed, without check. [...]&quot;

&gt; This Times article does not claim to be based on an AP press release,
&gt; nor does it contain the following sentences, sometimes quoted with other
&gt; wording:

&gt; &quot;I believe now that Hitler and the German People did not want war. But
&gt; we declared war on Germany, intent on destroying her. In this we were
&gt; encouraged by the Jews around Roosevelt. This was said to be in
&gt; accordance with our principle of the 'Balance of Power'. We ignored
&gt; Hitler's pleading not to enter into war. Now we are forced to realize
&gt; that Hitler was right. He offered us the co-operation of Germany.
&gt; Instead, since 1945, we have been facing the immense power of the Soviet
&gt; Empire.&quot;

&gt; I will keep looking in the media of these days for other press
&gt; clippings, also for an AP release, if there was one. If it exists, it is
&gt; more likely to have been on March 12, 1948, rather than March 16. The
&gt; often quoted year 1984 is an obvious result of a digit swap.
&gt; &lt;deletions&gt;
&gt; &lt;/quote&gt;

&gt; I was able to verify this by checking the microfilmed copy of the *Times
&gt; (London) for March 13, 1948, page 4. Mention is made there of a speech
&gt; by Lord Shawcross given on March 12, 1948 at Stourbridge, and of the
&gt; fact that he referred to prosecuting the Nazis at Nuremberg and of
&gt; condemning &quot;Nazi aggression and Nazi terror&quot;, methods he accuses the
&gt; Soviets of using with respect to the then recent events in
&gt; Czechoslovakia that he was commenting on. It would be strange indeed for
&gt; him to continue such a speech by claiming that &quot;Now we are forced to
&gt; realize that Hitler was right.&quot;, nor does the article contain these
&gt; words or the rest of the paragraph in the alleged quotation beginning:
&gt; &quot;I believe now that Hitler and the German People did not want war.&quot;

&gt;&gt; The Scrapbookpages link you provide below, is already gone, giving a &quot;IE
&gt;&gt; cannot load this page&quot; error.

&gt;&gt; It remains to be seen how the &quot;experts&quot; explain this away.

&gt;&gt; I look forward to comments from Keenan, Oy Vey I and II, and particularly
&gt;&gt; Holman.

&gt;&gt; Twatty and Salzman will no doubt simply parrot their &quot;You're a liar -
&gt;&gt; It's a
&gt;&gt; forgery&quot; mantra.

&gt;&gt; Again - Great work. I've archived this for future reference.

&gt; So, a trip to the library and less than an hour's work reveals that:

&gt; - there is no mention in the British quality press of Lord Shawcross
&gt; having made a speech at Stourbridge, England, containing the words in
&gt; question on March 16, 1984, nor does there seem to be any Associated
&gt; Press release telling of such a speech.

&gt; - I checked the *New York Times* as well, and found no reference to such
&gt; a speech within the interval March 17 - 27, 1984.

&gt; - David Irving, who loves this kind of materal and would certainly
&gt; exploit it if it were genuine, makes no reference to such a speech at
&gt; his webpages devoted to Lord Shawcross.

&gt; - Lord Shawcross did, according to the March 13, 1948 *Times [London]*,
&gt; make a speech at Stourbridge on March 12, 1948, in which some of the
&gt; phrases in the alleged quote were used. There is no mention in the news
&gt; item, which the *Times* does not ascribe to the Associated Press, about
&gt; being forced to any realization that &quot;Hitler was right&quot;.

&gt; My conclusion is that the quote is a clumsy forgery, with manipulated
&gt; dates and words added, to drive a specific agenda. Speaking in 1948 and
&gt; using some of the phraseology in the alleged quote, Lord Shawcross was
&gt; not claiming that we had come to a realization that &quot;Hitler was right&quot;,
&gt; but rather that the Soviets, still allies in 1946, were capable of the
&gt; type of terror and aggression that he and his Russian colleagues had so
&gt; soundly condemned in 1946.

&gt; As to the manipulated websites, I haven't a clue to who might have
&gt; changed it or why. My hunch would be that someone pointed out that the
&gt; quotation ascribed to Lord Shawcross is most likely bogus, and that it
&gt; was removed by a webmaster who was sloppy about updating the information
&gt; about the last modification.

&gt; Imagining this to be yet another plot by the &quot;horrid&quot; Jews to maintain
&gt; their &quot;myth&quot; is, in my view, a paranoid conclusion. Lord Shawcross never
&gt; changed his view that Hitler and the Nazis were criminals, or that their
&gt; actions were justified. The 1948 speech expressed his view that the
&gt; Soviets, with which he had cooperated in 1946 when condemning the Nazis,
&gt; were every bit as evil. The existence of a speech given by Lord
&gt; Shawcross at the same place in 1984 cannot be verified, nor does there
&gt; seem to be any mention of the controversy that a speech with such
&gt; content given by such a prominent person in the quality British or
&gt; American press during the latter half of March, 1984.

Provide evidence that there actually was an Associated Press release
from March 16, 1984 telling of Lord Shawcross's speech at Stourbridge,
or that there was any reaction in the British or international press to
such a speech.

I have been able to demonstrate beyond reasonable doubt that Lord
Shawcross gave a speech at Stourbridge on March 12, 1948, reported in
pag 4 of the London *Times* of March 13, 1948 with no attribution to the
Associated Press, that contained some of the phraseology attributed to
the alleged March 16, 1984 speech.

Since I can provide evidence (which anyone can check out by going to a
library and accessing the March 13, 1948 edition of the London *Times*
and looking at page 4)  that the March 12, 1948 speech was held, that
some of its phraseology was identical with that of the alleged 1984
speech, but that he did not say that Hitler was right, but only that the
Soviets were suing the same tactics of aggression and terror that Hitler
had used, I will continue to consider my position to be mor credible
than yours *until* you are able to prove the existence, preferably by
providing more concrete information about this alleged Associated Press
release, of the alleged speech given by Lord Shawcross on March 1, 1984.
A link to an article in a mainstream newspaper or newsmagazine would
suffice, although you would win the case hands down if you could locate
the alleged Associated Press release.

Any input you might have about the phraseological links between his
documented anti-Soviet speech of March 12, 1948 and his alleged
pro-Hitler speech of March 16, 1984 would, of course, be welcomed by
myself and other participants in this discussion.

ROTFL!!!!!

The only person to have solidly benefitted from the case is David Irving
himself. He got three months of free publicity that made his name a
household word and brought him more fame than he has ever had before or
since. He was given an opportunity that few people ever have to present
and defend his viewpoints and professional behavior. When they were
eventually shown to be bankrupt and he was handed a multimillion pound
bill in legal costs, he claimed bankruptcy and, although losing his
home, fancy car, and grand-bourgeois lifestyle, did not have to cough up
a farthing to cover the legal costs. Indeed, discredited and unable to
find a publisher, David Irving can finally retire and devote the rest of
his life to his wife and family, living off the donations of the
gullible and the profits generated by the loot he probably has stashed
away in various tax shelters. That, and the more than a year spent as a
guest of the Austrian state, with all the time in the world to devote to
writing about the multiple and multiplex wrongs he has suffered, and
sheltered from the mundane and tawdry chores of hustling his wares to
earn his board and keep, ensuring that his wife and child are happy, or
entertaining relatives and dinner guests, constitute quite a windfall
for a man of David Irving's proclivities, talents, and appetites.

The Jews do not benefit from this in the least, because nobody with a
head on his shoulders took David Irving seriously in the first place.
Silenced or pontificating, he was a non-entity trying to write history
books that were also best sellers, an oxymoron. Even though he had
denied or severely questioned certain aspects of the Holocaust, David
Irving was not foolish enough to deny the historical factuality of Nazi
Germany's genocide of European Jews, including the use of gas chambers
for this purpose. As those who have followed his subsequent antics and
semantic shenanigans know, he has claimed to have been &quot;right&quot; about
there not having been mass execution gas chambers &quot;at&quot; Auschwitz because
they were actually located just outside the perimeter and thus only
&quot;next to&quot; or contiguous with Auschwitz.

The community of professional historians, including Deborah Lipstadt,
gained marginally. They did a service to their profession by unmasking a
malpracticing charlatan for all the world to see, in addition to
generating a healthy debate about the nature of history and of the
historian's professionality. As I have said here many times, the
Holocaust was not on trial at the David Irving vs. Deborah
Lipstadt/Penguin Boks Ltd. trial. The trial was about whether a
professional community has the right and responsibility to bring public
attention to the fact that a person claiming to be a member of that
community is flagrantly malpracticing it, and then using the reputation
and authority thus acquired to further a pernicious political agenda.
David Irving brought suit in an attempt to silence such professional
criticism and whistle-blowing, but the court found the accusations of
malpractice to be substantially true and thus ruled against him. This
was an important victory for professional communities in their constant
struggle to maintain standards and identify malpractitioners. and
charlatans.

&gt; &gt;&gt; this current issue, laddie. To think any differently shows your

&gt; &gt;&gt; in a different light.

&gt; &gt; You evidently think that only a Jew, but not a responsible historian,
&gt; &gt; would be willing to challenge a fabricated quotation from an evidently
&gt; &gt; non-existent speech allegedly given by Lord Shawcross at Stourbridge on
&gt; &gt; March 16, 1984, spiced up with some misquotations and forged material
&gt; &gt; from a speech on a completely different topic given at Storbridge on
&gt; &gt; March 12, 1948.

&gt; Jayzus, you're a fucking wanker. No wonder you're such a Holocaust(tm)
&gt; advocate. Lies come so terribly easily to you.
">

Until you staisfactoricly demonstrate that a speech with this content
was indeed given by Lord Shawcross on March 16, 1984 and reported by the
Associated press, I cannot be regarded as a liar. Page 4 of the March
13, 1948 edition of the London *Times* demonstrates clearly that some of
the material alleged to have been contained in the March 16, 1984 speech
actually derives from the March 12, 1948 speech, although in a context
that was anti-Soviet, not Pro-Hitler.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Why aren't you dealing with the issue of the yids having the reports pulled
&gt; from the Internet? THAT is the real crux of the matter.
">

Because:

1. you have no proof at all that the Jews, &quot;the yids&quot; as you so demurely
call them, had anything whatsoever to do with the reports of the alleged
speech being pulled from a certain internet site;

2. reports on the alleged speech are still to be found at several
internet sites, so whovever had it pulled was only partially successful;

3. you refuse to entertain the possibility, refusing to acknowledge any
evidence in support of it, that the alleged speech is actually a clumsy
fabrication incorporating fiddling with dates  March 12, 1948 becomes
March 16, 1984, taking material out of context, and presenting forged
material as a quotation. Anybody concerned with the legacy and
reputation of  Lord Shawcross, a leading figure in the British legal
system for more than five decades and one of the more important
participants in the Nuremberg Trials, would be appalled upon seeing such
an opinion attributed to him in a speech that he evidently never gave.

You call me a deceitful twerp for not focusing on what, to me, are
unsubstantiated issues. If you can demonstrate: 1) that the speech was
actually given, 2) that it contained the material attributed to it, and
3) that the Jews, acting as a community, rather than someone, whether
Jewish or not, concerned about the legacy of Lord Shawcross, put
pressure on certain internet sites to have it pulled, then I will have
to consider your position seriously. As it stands, there are several
issues that have to be clarified before that of the Jews allegedly
censoring the internet becomes relevant.

Now, get off your butt and hit the libe; you've got some research to do,
you!

No. Deborah Lipstadt's legal defense fund was able to round up a large
sum of money, hardly $13,000,000 though, to ensure that she could defend
herself against a frivolous suit brought against her in a foreign
country where libel law is very different from anything that she would
have been used to.

It was never Deborah Lipstadt's intention to destroy David Irving.
Unlike the case with medicine or dentistry, the profession of historian
is not controlled by a formal licensing body, so nobody could have
prevented David Irving from continuing to write skewed history. Deborah
Lipstadt and her team of expert witnesses did all that  the members of
an academic profession can do to call attention to the fact that David
Irving was a malpractiioner of their profession, and that he was using
the reputation he had gained by malpracticing to  further his political
objectives, one of which was making Hitler and Nazi Germany look better
than they were by denying or trivializing certain aspects of the
Holocaust. She achieved her goal in that David irving was forced to
admit several times during the court that he had been guilty of
precisely the practices that Deborah Lipstadt had faulted him for. David
irving continues to write, but no reputable publisher regards im as
anything more than a discredited pseudo-historian nowayds, so he has to
distribute his writings for free ­ although he requests contributions to
cover costs ­ over the internet.

David Irving *knew* that he had done the things that Deborah Lipstadt
accused him of having done, but he assumed that, already having a
home-turf advantage, he could emerge victorious from the fray by
grandstanding in the courtroom and intimidating Deborah Lipstadt and
Judge Charles Gray with his mastery of minutiae. He failed initially to
understand that the trial was only about his charge that Deborah
Lipstadt had libeled him in her 1993 book *Denying the Holocaust. The
Growing Assault on truth and Memory*, and came to the court prepared to
wage a battle of elocution and debate with Deborah Lipstadt, when the
real issue at stake was whether Deborah Lipstadt's *written* criticism
of his methodology and agenda as published in the single book in
question was based on demonstrable fact or not.  Deborah Listadt did not
have to utter a single word and, to the constant frustration of David
irving, she did not. Thus, like Hitler launching a three-pronged attack
on the USSR at Midsummer with no back-up plan for the possibility that
everything might not go precisely according to plan, David Irving failed
to do his homework and wound up, like the German tanks along the roads
to Moscow, mired in the mud rather than rolling on to a crucial strike
at the jugular.

Like Deborah Lipstadt, David Irving had supporters with deep pockets,
and he also appealed for money to fill the coffers of his legal defense
fund. How much he received, or what he did with this money is not known
but, unlike Deborah Lipstadt, he obviously did not use it to hire the
best legal council and defense team that his money could buy.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; and you're now saying Irving benefited from the exchange.
">

It was David Irving's show from start to finish.

1. He initiated the legal action.

2. He could have sued Deborah Lipstadt and her small academic publisher
when the book first appeared, but he waited to sue until it was
published by a major and very wealthy multinational publishing
corporation, this meaning that big bucks were at stake if he were to win
the case.

3. To maximize the potential profit for himself, David Irving dispensed
with a trial lawyer or legal team, thus avoiding the necessity of having
to share any possible damages awarded to him.

4. His name was constantly in the headlines for three months. Even here
in Finland and our neighbor Estonia, where most people had never heard
of him or of Holocaust denial of historical revisionism (in the
alt.revisionism sense) before the case, the trial was a constantly
running top news story.

5. Anyone who knows what publicity costs understands that David Irving
received more publicity for himself and his views than almost any
author, not to mention any author of works not intended to be fiction,
receives in several lifetimes.

6. Even people uninterested in history or in David Irving's
interpretation of it, were exposed to a dissection of his views in their
newspapers, news magazines, television news, and even on talk shows, for
weeks on end.

7. Most of the people who followed the story from start to finish agreed
wholeheartedly with Judge Charles Gray's verdict that Deborah Lipstadt's
critique of Irving had been justified, that Irving was a malpractitioner
of the historian's profession, and that he had not been libeled.

8. David Irving got the trial and the publicity that he wanted, but he
succeeded in having others pay for it. The legal and other fees that he
was ordered to pay will probably never be recovered.

Summa summarum: David Irving had his fun playing historian and trial
lawyer, got a world-wide forum and audience, and all this for free. What
an exhibitionistic way to commit professional suicide!

The only deceit and skullduggery involved in this whole affair was the
posting of an obvious forgery.  I love the subject heading &quot;Shawcross On His
deathbed&quot;.  The non-speech was non-delivered in 1984.  Shawcross died in
2003.  I suppose Shawcross was on his deathbed for 19 years.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; There were many views on Hitler before and after the war, and, knowing
&gt; what an unprincipled gambler Hitler was, I have long known that Hitler
&gt; did not want war with the UK and was frankly surprised that the UK
&gt; actually lived up to its commitment to defend Poland after Germany's
&gt; Sept. 1, 1939 attack consequent to the fabricated border incident at
&gt; Gleiwitz. Lord Shawcross, who had some extremely negative things to say
&gt; about Hitler and Nazism in his marathon five-hour speech at the
&gt; Nuremberg Trials in 1946, would certainly have had the right to express
&gt; a different view in 1984, when the Cold war was still very much a
&gt; reality, even if claiming that &quot;Hitler was right&quot; does seem to be an
&gt; exterme reversal. The problem is determining whether the quote is
&gt; authentic.

&gt; I checked out David Irving's site dealing with Lord Shawcross,
&gt; http://www.fpp.co.uk/History/Nuremberg/Times110703.html , and was
&gt; surprised that no mention made of the speech in the obituary posted
&gt; there. Nor was any commentary added by Irving concerning the alleged
&gt; speech even though, if true, it was clearly in the spirit of many of
&gt; Irving's writings at the time, which often showed a certain degree of
&gt; sympathy for Hitler and his aims.

&gt; A little bit of detective work indicated that the source of the quote is
&gt; allegedly an Associated Press release of March 16, 1984. A look at the
&gt; microfilmed copies of *The Times (London)* and the *Economist* for March
&gt; 15 to 25, 1984 revealed no mention of such a speech, although one would
&gt; suspect that so radical a reversal of opinion by such a prominent
&gt; personality as Lord Shawcross, even if by then a relatively old man of
&gt; 82, would have given rise to some comment, at least in the form of a
&gt; letter to the editor or a small news item. I did not, unfortunately,
&gt; have the resources to access the Associated Press archives for the date
&gt; in question to see if there was indeed such a press release.

&gt; On the other hand, further investigation revealed the following:

&gt; Source:
&gt; http://www.geocities.com/gambanreidi.geo/SurprisingRevelation.html

&gt; &lt;quote&gt;
&gt; &lt;deletions&gt;
&gt; One of our readers has informed us of this:

&gt; The Times (London ), March 13, 1948, p. 4, reports:
&gt; &quot;SINISTER AIMS OF COMMUNISM SIR H. SHAWCROSS ON WESTERN UNION Sir
&gt; Hartley Shawcross, the Attorney-General, speaking at Stourbridge last
&gt; night [March 12th], said that recent tragic events in Czechoslovakia
&gt; [communist putsch followed by suicide of Masaryk] had brought a new
&gt; sense of urgency to the movement for western union. [...] SAME NAZI
&gt; TECHNIQUE [...] Step by stepp I have been forced more and more to the
&gt; conclusion that the aims of Communism in Europe are sinister and deadly
&gt; aims. I prosecuted the Nazis in Nuremberg. With my Russian colleagues I
&gt; condemned Nazi aggression and Nazi terror. I feel shame and humiliation
&gt; now to see under a different name the same aims pursued, the same
&gt; technique followed, without check. [...]&quot;

&gt; This Times article does not claim to be based on an AP press release,
&gt; nor does it contain the following sentences, sometimes quoted with other
&gt; wording:

&gt; &quot;I believe now that Hitler and the German People did not want war. But
&gt; we declared war on Germany, intent on destroying her. In this we were
&gt; encouraged by the Jews around Roosevelt. This was said to be in
&gt; accordance with our principle of the 'Balance of Power'. We ignored
&gt; Hitler's pleading not to enter into war. Now we are forced to realize
&gt; that Hitler was right. He offered us the co-operation of Germany.
&gt; Instead, since 1945, we have been facing the immense power of the Soviet
&gt; Empire.&quot;

&gt; I will keep looking in the media of these days for other press
&gt; clippings, also for an AP release, if there was one. If it exists, it is
&gt; more likely to have been on March 12, 1948, rather than March 16. The
&gt; often quoted year 1984 is an obvious result of a digit swap.
&gt; &lt;deletions&gt;
&gt; &lt;/quote&gt;

&gt; I was able to verify this by checking the microfilmed copy of the *Times
&gt; (London) for March 13, 1948, page 4. Mention is made there of a speech
&gt; by Lord Shawcross given on March 12, 1948 at Stourbridge, and of the
&gt; fact that he referred to prosecuting the Nazis at Nuremberg and of
&gt; condemning &quot;Nazi aggression and Nazi terror&quot;, methods he accuses the
&gt; Soviets of using with respect to the then recent events in
&gt; Czechoslovakia that he was commenting on. It would be strange indeed for
&gt; him to continue such a speech by claiming that &quot;Now we are forced to
&gt; realize that Hitler was right.&quot;, nor does the article contain these
&gt; words or the rest of the paragraph in the alleged quotation beginning:
&gt; &quot;I believe now that Hitler and the German People did not want war.&quot;

&gt;&gt; The Scrapbookpages link you provide below, is already gone, giving a &quot;IE
&gt;&gt; cannot load this page&quot; error.

&gt;&gt; It remains to be seen how the &quot;experts&quot; explain this away.

&gt;&gt; I look forward to comments from Keenan, Oy Vey I and II, and particularly
&gt;&gt; Holman.

&gt;&gt; Twatty and Salzman will no doubt simply parrot their &quot;You're a liar -
&gt;&gt; It's a
&gt;&gt; forgery&quot; mantra.

&gt;&gt; Again - Great work. I've archived this for future reference.

&gt; So, a trip to the library and less than an hour's work reveals that:

&gt; - there is no mention in the British quality press of Lord Shawcross
&gt; having made a speech at Stourbridge, England, containing the words in
&gt; question on March 16, 1984, nor does there seem to be any Associated
&gt; Press release telling of such a speech.

&gt; - I checked the *New York Times* as well, and found no reference to such
&gt; a speech within the interval March 17 - 27, 1984.

&gt; - David Irving, who loves this kind of materal and would certainly
&gt; exploit it if it were genuine, makes no reference to such a speech at
&gt; his webpages devoted to Lord Shawcross.

&gt; - Lord Shawcross did, according to the March 13, 1948 *Times [London]*,
&gt; make a speech at Stourbridge on March 12, 1948, in which some of the
&gt; phrases in the alleged quote were used. There is no mention in the news
&gt; item, which the *Times* does not ascribe to the Associated Press, about
&gt; being forced to any realization that &quot;Hitler was right&quot;.

&gt; My conclusion is that the quote is a clumsy forgery, with manipulated
&gt; dates and words added, to drive a specific agenda. Speaking in 1948 and
&gt; using some of the phraseology in the alleged quote, Lord Shawcross was
&gt; not claiming that we had come to a realization that &quot;Hitler was right&quot;,
&gt; but rather that the Soviets, still allies in 1946, were capable of the
&gt; type of terror and aggression that he and his Russian colleagues had so
&gt; soundly condemned in 1946.

&gt; As to the manipulated websites, I haven't a clue to who might have
&gt; changed it or why. My hunch would be that someone pointed out that the
&gt; quotation ascribed to Lord Shawcross is most likely bogus, and that it
&gt; was removed by a webmaster who was sloppy about updating the information
&gt; about the last modification.

&gt; Imagining this to be yet another plot by the &quot;horrid&quot; Jews to maintain
&gt; their &quot;myth&quot; is, in my view, a paranoid conclusion. Lord Shawcross never
&gt; changed his view that Hitler and the Nazis were criminals, or that their
&gt; actions were justified. The 1948 speech expressed his view that the
&gt; Soviets, with which he had cooperated in 1946 when condemning the Nazis,
&gt; were every bit as evil. The existence of a speech given by Lord
&gt; Shawcross at the same place in 1984 cannot be verified, nor does there
&gt; seem to be any mention of the controversy that a speech with such
&gt; content given by such a prominent person would have generated in the
&gt; quality British or American press during the latter half of March, 1984.

&gt;&gt; &gt; Provide evidence that there actually was an Associated Press release
&gt;&gt; &gt; from March 16, 1984 telling of Lord Shawcross's speech at Stourbridge,
&gt;&gt; &gt; or that there was any reaction in the British or international press to
&gt;&gt; &gt; such a speech.

&gt;&gt; Done.

&gt; We're waiting... You will, of course, have no difficulty citing its full
&gt; and precise content, and providing precise information about the
&gt; publication(s), particularly the British ones, in which it first
&gt; appeared in March, 1984.

&gt; &lt;deletions&gt;

&gt;&gt; &gt; The only person to have solidly benefitted from the case is David
&gt;&gt; &gt; Irving
&gt;&gt; &gt; himself.

&gt;&gt; God you talk shit. The fucking yids spent $13m dollars to destroy the
&gt;&gt; man,

&gt; No. Deborah Lipstadt's legal defense fund was able to round up a large
&gt; sum of money, hardly $13,000,000 though, to ensure that she could defend
&gt; herself against a frivolous suit brought against her in a foreign
&gt; country where libel law is very different from anything that she would
&gt; have been used to.
">

This thread has nothing to do with the unhealthy obsession you hold for
lipschitz, holman, and all to do with the fact an article was pulled from
the web after it became apparent it was embarrasing to the yids.

The $13m figure is admitted to themselves, clown.

My dedicated and incessant research into the issue indicates you to be

David Irving took umbrage at and tried to sue Deborah Lipstadt because
she had accused him of presenting material with fiddled dates,

You are taking umbrage at me for intimating that you are having a

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

My present position is the following.

1. The article has *not* been pulled from the web, it has only been
pulled from certain websites. A Google search for &quot;Shawcross,
Stourbridge, 1984&quot; yields 219 hits, including e.g.
http://www.biblebelievers.org.au/witness2.htm and
http://www.stormfront.org/forum/showthread.php/churchills-war-memoirs...
tion-no-405155.html.

2. All of the ones that I have checked make a vague reference to an
Associated Press release.

3. A preliminary inspection of the London *Times*, the *New York Times*,
the *Economist*, *Newsweek*, *Time*, *Der Spiegel*, *Suomen Kuvalehti*,
and *Nedelya*,  for the period between March 16 and March 31, 1984
reveals *no reference whatsoever* to a speech given by Lord Shawcross at
Stourbridge on this or any other topic.

4. I have contacted Associated Press and requested them to search their
archives to determine whether they ever published a press release about
such a speech in March 1984.

5. Lord Shawcross's own biography, *Life Sentence*, 1995, makes no
reference to such a speech or to the sentiments that it allegedly
contains.

6. If Lord Shawcross had indeed made such an apologetic statement about
Hitler, it would have been embarrassing to him and his legacy, but
hardly to &quot;the yids&quot;.

7. There is abundant evidence that Lord Shawcross made a speech on March
12, 1948 containing some of the phraseology attributed to him for the
alleged 1984 speech, but his purpose then was to excoriate the USSR for
using Hitlerite policies, not to apologize for Hitler.

8. I strongly suspect that the AP release is fraudulant, and that the
references to Lord Shawcross's alleged 1984 Stourbridge speech are
fabrications based on his real speech at Stourbridge given in 1948.

It's beginning to look as though you have been had. You have gotten
yourself all in a hussy over what appears to be an Irvingesque soundbite
into &quot;real history&quot;, the historiographical equivalent of a fart.

I might add that I have a special interest in this, since, once ­
mukashi, mukashi, omukashi ­ I spent a happy summer in Honesdale,
Pennsylvania, a town which any railway buff knows has a special link to
Stourbridge, as a child within the framework of the *Herald Tribune

Every occasionally I see a topic and a debate that seems interesting
only to find that the likes of Jacobson and Warren run it into the
ground with their mindless one-liners.

Holman is good but so is Waldo and it would be interesting to see how
they argue a controversial topic but it is impossible with these
around. It reminds one of two lions going at each other while a pack
of hyenas keeps nipping at one of them. The one being harassed by the
pack of hyenas is sure to get distracted eventually. Are these
zionazis so afraid of a debate that they have to resort to tactics
like this?

Why should anyone answer any zionazi questions?

As soon as you answer a zionazi question, the zionazi comes back
asking the same question you just answered. It seems that zionazis can
do that repeatedly until anyone gullible enough to have tried to
answer a zionazi's question is exhausted.

After you get tired of going around in circles with the zionazi asking
the same question repeatedly and ignoring your responses, the zionazi
will declare victory.

That is the zionazi way.

Did anyone notice that zionazis only ask questions but never answer
them?

Have a nice zionazi day!

&gt; other sensitive parts of my anatomy are not aroused by every conspiracy
&gt; theory, imbecility, and sound-byte of &quot;real history&quot; that happens past.

&gt;&gt; &gt; I might add that I have a special interest in this, since, once ­
&gt;&gt; &gt; mukashi, mukashi, omukashi ­ I spent a happy summer in Honesdale,
&gt;&gt; &gt; Pennsylvania, a town which any railway buff knows has a special link to
&gt;&gt; &gt; Stourbridge, as a child within the framework of the *Herald Tribune
&gt;&gt; &gt; Fresh Air Fund*.

&gt;&gt; Que? What the fuck are you blathering about?

&gt; There is an important historical ferrovial link between Honesdale,
&gt; Pennsylvania and Stourbridge. Have you ever heard of the Stourbridge
&gt; Lion?

No. Nor do I have any need to.

I don't need to. I walk or use our excellent public transportation. If
pressed, as in &quot;fair damsel in distress&quot;, I do know how to use a jack,
wrench, and associated nuts and bolts to change a tire [sic].

&gt;   For conclusive proof that &quot;Cramer&quot; is a forger,  look

I checked the above thread, Mr. Jacobson, and at a later stage, Mr. Cramer
admitted his mistake and made good the source of his reference.

Does that in any way make the document linked to a forgery, Mr. Jacobson?
I'm afraid not. It simply says the original poster mistakenly attributed the
wrong source to the article. A mistake he made good, which you have
completely ignored.

Having had time to read even more of your posts, and acquaint myself with
your posting history, I have come to the conclusion you are a master of the
&quot;out of context&quot; post, Mr. Jacobson and an extremely dishonest person.

Apart from the above, and being consumed by hatred, you are such a strange,
and quite vile creature in so many other ways Mr. Jacobson.

I make particular note of the fact I seem to be the only person responding
to your posts. This suggests to me all other readers of this forum are quite
sick of your nonsense, and have you killfiled.

I seriously doubt I will bother carrying on dialogue with you, my good man.
You seem to be completely beyond redemption.

Charles.
