People With Down Syndrome Aren't 'Bad Outcomes'

PATRICIA E. BAUER
November 19, 2007

All across the land this fall, people have been gathering to promote
awareness and acceptance of Down syndrome. Central to their message is the
idea that people with the condition are valued family members who lead happy,
fulfilling lives.

At the National Institutes of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, scientists meet to develop research agendas to improve the lives
of people with Down syndrome, the genetic condition that results when a
person has three copies of the 21st chromosome instead of the usual pair.

But in the places where medicine is practiced, a very different and less
benevolent awareness of Down syndrome reigns. Women are undergoing prenatal
diagnostics for Down syndrome in unprecedented numbers ‹ often multiple times
during their pregnancies. When the condition is detected, they are having
abortions at rates that are thought to approach 90 percent.

Those of us who have relationships with people with Down syndrome, and who
see them achieving and thriving in their communities, view this paradox as
baffling at best, tragic at worst.

We cherish our friends and family members and think their unexpected extra
chromosome is not the most important thing about them. And we worry that the
relentlessness of genetic testing is amplifying stigma and bias against the
350,000 flesh-and-blood Americans who have the condition, as well as people
who have other conditions that are now or soon will be prenatally
discoverable.

In recent conversations with obstetricians and gynecologists, I've found that
we family members aren't the only ones with these fears. Physicians say
they're disturbed by mounting demands from prospective parents for nothing
less than the &quot;perfect&quot; child, and by lawyers who troll for lawsuits against
doctors who have the misfortune to deliver nonstandard babies.

Doctors are left to practice defensive medicine, ordering expensive tests and
drowning patients in mind-numbing data, while parents labor under the
misapprehension that they have a duty to terminate if the tests so dictate.

It's bad enough that the prenatal screens themselves aren't exact. They can't
tell for sure whether a fetus has an extra chromosome. They have significant
rates of both false positives and false negatives, which is the medical way
of saying they're not infrequently wrong. It's no wonder pregnant women are
stressed.

And here's the worst part: The diagnostics carry the unspoken message that
people with Down syndrome are &quot;bad outcomes,&quot; people whose lives are not
worth living.

Nobody thinks the tests are going away. Still, there is much physicians could
do to reform the testing process, reducing women's stress and lessening the
risk of stigma against people with Down syndrome and other genetic
differences:

€ Doctors should encourage couples to explore their beliefs about when life
begins, and the value of people with disabilities, before asking about
screening. Couples need to know that a conversation about screening may well
wind up a conversation about abortion.

€ Doctors should make clear the risks, benefits and limitations of the tests
before asking couples if they wish to screen. Couples should be told that the
tests are voluntary and that their purpose is not to offer reassurance (as
some doctors say) but rather to identify genetic and developmental
differences in fetuses.

€ Doctors should provide accurate, current information about Down syndrome to
couples in a respectful context before asking if they wish to screen, while
people are calm and can absorb information.

€ Doctors should support and respect every woman's right to choose whether to
be screened and whether to continue a pregnancy.

€ Doctors delivering an unexpected diagnosis should refer parents to the real
experts ‹ other parents ‹ through local support groups and should also
provide resources from national Down syndrome organizations.

Most important, physicians should insist on comprehensive research into the
quality of life and outcomes of people with Down syndrome and their families,
and those data should be used to develop accurate materials to share with
prospective parents.

After all, if physicians don't have reliable information about the lives of
people with Down syndrome, how can they advise patients? And how can patients
possibly give informed consent?

In the meantime, I'll keep hoping for acceptance of genetic diversity. That
would be the best resolution of all.

It's because of that damned music from the 1970s! They based their
belief system on it.

In my book, nothing will ever top the two deaf lesbians* who stacked

like them.

But this drivel makes runner-up.

Um, I don't really think so. How many parents of a tard, support
group or national organization is going to tell the prospective
parents, &quot;Yeah, I'd rather we had aborted the damned thing but
we didn't and now we're stuck?&quot;

On Tue, 20 Nov 2007 21:34:26 -0500, Omixochitl reached into its ass and
pulled out (in article &lt;Xns99EEDB035706Bidto ... @204.153.245.131&gt;):

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Aren't &quot;deaf cultures&quot; just cultures which share a sign language like the
&gt; way some other cultures share a spoken language?  I got the impression that
&gt; &quot;signing cultures&quot; would be more accurate than &quot;deaf cultures&quot; for those.

&gt; The &quot;deafness isn't a disability and hearing is a crutch&quot; brigade, on the
&gt; other hand...
">

The latter is &quot;Deaf culture,&quot; emphasis on the capital &quot;D&quot;. Their core belief
seems to be that communicating with their hands, and rejecting such Stepin
Fetchit behaviors as lip-reading, constitutes a separate &quot;culture.&quot; I hadn't
actually (er) heard the sentiment &quot;Hearing is a crutch&quot; before, but I'm not
too surprised by it; it manifests the same hostility toward anyone who is
whole of body that is reflected in the phrase &quot;temporarily abled,&quot; which is
how militant &quot;cripples&quot; (their term) refer to us.

The Misanthropic Bitch did a rant on Deaf culture at one point. Last I knew
her site was gone, but you can probably find it via archive.org.
