Hi all,
I have started to consider the use of sprinklers in a small room
(2.5x3.6x2.4).  I used a burner (mimicking a growing fire) and I also
used a small burner to ignite upholstery.  Am I correct in my
assumptions that the slight differences in HRR etc. as observed
between a sprinklered and non sprinklered fire scenario with window
open/closed is due to the room being small.  I was expecting the
sprinkler to knock down the fire after some time for the upholstery
case.  I have read about the E_Coefficient to be achieved
experimentally, is the via test or by applying differing values, if
the latter is the case what is a typical value range.

Many thanks in advance, John

Seems like you've got too many things going on. Decompose the problem
into its various parts. First, decide if you want to just use a
&quot;burner&quot; to mimic an actual HRR curve, or if you want to use a small
burner just to ignite the upholstery, which would then burn according
to the heat feedback from the fire. E_COEFFICIENT only has meaning in
cases where you have set an HRRPUA and RAMP to mimic the HRR curve.
Try both of these options with an open room. Gas phase flame
extinction is going to complicate everything. Just work out your fire
strategy, then your sprinkler strategy, then your ventilation.

Many thanks Kevin, I will try out the options as suggested.

Best Regards, John

Hi all,

OK, I will admit it, I was using FDS 4 to run my sprinkler scenario
and found that the sprinkler did not show decay on sprinkler
activation, for both a thermally thick and thin item of upholstery
ignited by a burner.  When I transferred the file to FDS 5 (based on
the couch sprinkler data file) I found that not only did the sprinkler
control the fire it quenched it.  Am I correct in assuming that
sprinklers in FDS 5 are better than in FDS 4 or have I fluked it?

Many thanks, John

Certainly the handling of under-ventilated combustion is better and
more reliable. The basic droplet trajectory stuff is the same.
Droplets on the surface are being treated better, we feel, but this is
still very difficult to validate. There are so many heat transfer
parameters for the water-surface interface, water-air, radiation-
droplet, and so on. So use with caution and consider results
qualitative until you or we provide further validation.
