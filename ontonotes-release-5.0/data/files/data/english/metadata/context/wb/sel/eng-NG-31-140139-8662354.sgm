Dear all.

I hope you'll agree that gnet provides a great and effective forum to
reach many groups and individuals scattered throughout the world.

As such, please excuse me as I send the attached copy email to you. It
heralds the launch of the City Foundation, and the good news that it
spells for the Club. If you and/or a group (whether City related or not)
could get behind it, with its large cash and other prizes, that would be
great! As you'll see, there are some superb benefits for being a
Foundation member!

Thanks for your support!

Kind regards
Paul

Dear All,

Firstly can I, on behalf of the Club Board, start by taking the
opportunity to formally thank each and every one of you and your fellow
group committee members and other helpers for all that you do to support
the various activities of the Club. These things are very much appreciated.

It is now though time for us to ask for your help in a different way -
with the aim of us paying you money!

You each represent an important and vital group of our fans and the
extended communities of which we are all a part. Accordingly, we would
like to invite you to link together your contacts and groups to drive up
the membership of the newly launched City Foundation. The Foundation is
built on the principles that have underpinned some of the most
successful schemes of its kind in the country, with three other main
benefits unique to Exeter City:
1. our offer to Season Ticket holders below;
2. our commitment to support the playing and youth side of the Club with
the profits we generate;
3. our focus on the Foundation being for anyone in the community to take
part in, in order to make our community football club even more relevant
and accessible to all.

The early application numbers have been very strong indeed. We now wish
to take the next stage of our launch plans forward, and would like to
enlist you, if you can, to drive us to big membership numbers. For each
new member signed up we will pay the recruiting group/individual (who
should mark the application form to advise us of the source) £10. We are
happy to pay this money to groups or individuals, so if you as a group
are able to co-ordinate your sales efforts then the financial reward
coming from us to you could be very significant indeed!

Our next phase is to sell the Foundation across the county in pubs,
clubs, shops etc. There is no need for anyone to collect cash as the
whole scheme is run by direct debit. Anyone recruiting members will be
able to claim their £10 per member signed up.

I have attached to this email the brochure and application form for the
Foundation. These were handed out at the Weymouth match, will be in the
programme for this weekend's match, and are being sent out in the first
instance to two priority groups - existing Bond scheme members (the
existing Bond, which for some while now has been barely breaking even,
is being closed) and season ticket holders (reflecting the fact that for
Foundation members season ticket prices will be frozen for life from now
on if they join the Foundation before the end of this year, or from
whenever future or current season ticket holders join up!). The letters
to each of these groups are also attached for your information.

We have printed many thousands of the brochures and we will gladly
dispatch these to reach you wherever best suits you. John Fournier is
the promoter and administrator of the Foundation so please contact him
directly (johnfourn ... @eclipse.co.uk) for brochures, queries or any
other matter!

Please do feel free to use this email in your communications to help you
launch your sales and communication drive. We have capped membership at
2,000 so please do bear this in mind as we expect to hit these numbers
in good time.

Thank you in advance for making this something else for us as a club to
be proud of!

Kind regards

Paul

Sorry to spam you all, but as I have had no reply following an email to the
address specified on the official site in the news item!

I have just paid £52 by standing order in the last 10 days representing 4
entries in the Bond (2 for me and 2 for my son) for 13 weeks - meaning we
are now paid up until the end of the year.

When did/does the Bond cease and the new scheme take over. If we don't wish
to transfer, how do we go about getting our overpaid monies back? If we do
wish to transfer, how is the overpaid subscription transferred?

Cheers,
Phil

I've had an application form to join the City Foundation come in the post
(like many others I should imagine).  From the accompanying letter I think
it's saying it is going to replace the City Bond Scheme, though it doesn't
make it 100% clear.  Does anyone know if that is the case?  Talking of the
City Bond I haven't seen an updated draw for a couple of months, is it still
running?

I've just e-mailed the club asking the same questions, but thought I would
ask on here as well, just in case anyone knows the answers.

Regards,
Mark Crocker

Hi Mark!

Thanks for your mail. The main answer is that, yes, the Foundation is
replacing the Bond (see my mail posted to gnet earlier for a clearer
explanation). I will also also Jubby (who is administering the Bond and
transfer across of that) to contact you re the Bond draws.

Many thanks

Paul

Noticed the foundation got a mention in Tiz's post match interview  too.
That's what I call product placement!  .......
