For consumers, rebates inspire glee - and rage
By Deb Kollars -- Bee Staff Writer
Published 2:15 am PST Tuesday, December 21, 2004

In the land of shopping, there is nothing like a rebate to make people
feel they've gotten a good deal.

And nothing like a rebate to make them feel ripped off.

Computers, printers, shredders, cell phones - name a hot product and
chances are a manufacturer is trying to swing a sale with a mail-in
rebate offer.

There's also a good chance that rebate offer has ticked somebody off.

Rebate rage is on the rise, according to the Council of Better
Business Bureaus and the Federal Trade Commission.

The agencies' most recent statistics show that complaints about
mail-in rebates have nearly doubled in the past couple of years.

&quot;A lot of people have been burned by rebates,&quot; said Sheila Adkins,
spokeswoman for the Council of Better Business Bureaus, based in
Arlington, Va.

Nationally, she said, rebate complaints nearly doubled last year, from
974 in 2002 to 1,710 in 2003. The Federal Trade Commission has seen a
similar spike: from 1,100 in 2003 to a projected 1,900 for this year.

&quot;And we know that's just a small piece of the story,&quot; said Matthew
Gold, an FTC staff attorney in San Francisco.

&quot;Only a very small percentage of complaints ever wind up at this
level.&quot;

Jill Beckett, a coupon-clipping stay-at-home mom from Elk Grove, is
among the many who have never filed an official rebate complaint.

But how she despises rebates.

Beckett has what could be considered a quintessential relationship
with rebates. She gets dazzled by the offers and leaves the checkout
stand delighted by her bargains.

Then she gets home and starts cutting out the little codes on the
boxes, and filling in the forms with print so small she can barely
read it, and mailing her rebate packets to faraway post office boxes.

And then she waits.

And waits.

Sometimes the checks come.

Sometimes they don't.

&quot;I hate rebates,&quot; she said.

&quot;They're such a pain. But still I do them.&quot;

Two years ago, Beckett became an official member of the rebate rage
club, when she sent in a $20 mail-in rebate on a $40 software
purchase.

After months of waiting for her money, she called the company and was
told her paperwork never arrived. Since she kept no record of the
rebate application, she was out of luck.

Now when she applies for rebates, she makes copies of everything - UPC
codes, receipts, the rebate forms themselves.

And like a lot of Americans, she wonders: Why don't the companies save
everyone the hassle and just discount the prices at the cash register?

According to Claire Rosenzweig, president of the Promotion Marketing
Association in New York City, companies offer rebates because people
like them.

&quot;They're extremely popular with consumers,&quot; she said.

&quot;People enjoy getting money back on these products. It makes it more
fun. It makes it more interesting.&quot;

There's another reason companies favor the rebate process, said
Stephen Shapiro, a professor of marketing at Babson College, a private
school of business in Wellesley, Mass.

&quot;It's called slippage,&quot; he said.

Shapiro explained that companies build cumbersome steps and long waits
into the rebate process, knowing that a good percentage of people will
give up along the way or not bother at all.

If companies offered the price break at the register, they would have
to pay on every item sold. By some estimates, however, as few as 40
percent of people bother to return rebates.

And in many of those cases, customers make some sort of mistake, such
as filing too late, that voids the rebate.

&quot;They bank on people not following through,&quot; Adkins said.

The higher the value of the rebate compared to the purchase price, the
greater the follow-through by customers, said Roger Lanctot, an
advertising analyst with the Beyen Corp., a firm in Niagara Falls,
Ontario, that tracks retail advertising trends.

In the consumer electronics industry, where rebates can run into the
$100 and even $200 range, companies see a fulfillment rate of 50
percent or higher, Lanctot said. &quot;Bundled&quot; rebates are a recent
development, requiring people to buy two items in tandem, such as a
digital camera and a printer, to get a single rebate.

When the big checks arrive after a big purchase, it's a great feeling
for consumers, he said. When they don't come - whether because the
consumer didn't follow the process perfectly or because of glitches on
the company's part - it can lead to aggravation.

A year ago, Will Farris, 57, decided to buy a $700 computer from a
catalog after noting he could get a $200 rebate through the mail. &quot;It
sounded almost too good to be true,&quot; said Farris, who lives in the
town of Twain, in the Feather River Canyon.

Months later, he still hadn't received the money and called the
company. After surviving one of those annoying series of telephone
prompts, he was informed he hadn't sent in the correct papers. But the
clerk couldn't tell him precisely what was missing.

Many people would have responded by calling, writing and calling some
more until they finally shook loose their rebate.

But Farris, a disabled veteran with post traumatic stress disorder,
knew chasing the rebate would not be worth the price.

&quot;I wrote off the rebate in exchange for peace of mind,&quot; he said.

Bit by bit, companies are getting the message that consumers are fed
up with rebate hassles. Some now offer duplicate receipts at the time
of purchase. In October, Staples, a national office supply retailer,
began allowing people to file rebates online.

&quot;Our whole brand promise is making things easy,&quot; said Karen O'Neil, a
Staples spokeswoman. &quot;And we kept hearing, rebates are not easy.&quot;

The program has been popular, with more than 250,000 people submitting
rebates on line as of mid-December, O'Neil said.

Manufacturers also like the electronic system because it helps stop
fraud by identifying those who return products while still trying to
collect on rebates.

This is great-I'm glad that retailers such as Staples are listening to
what we as consumers want and need! Sounds like they are pioneers in
this area.

what a load of crap! the rebate fulfillment houses -guarantee-
manufacturers only x% of people will claim them or they'll eat the extra --
that's why they're ubiquituous in the consumer electronics market and why
the rebate houses seem to 'lose' or disqualify so many of them.

i even photocopy the stamped envelope i mail the materials in so they cannot
claim i put the wrong address on or had inadequate postage. I also hound
them by calling and documenting everything -- names, times i called, etc..
Then when they try to screw you, write to either your state's attorney
general or office of consumer affairs, whoever handles this stuff in your
state, and copy the CEOs of the companies involved. It works. They do not
want that sort of attention. My father has gotten long-missing rebates
after contacting his state's AG, and I just had luck in my state after
BellSouth kept falsely denying my claims. I suddenly got my checks.

Bill-how so - Can you clarify a bit? I'd think it would be great to
have a few alternatives to mailing it in the old fashioned way.

"/> The processing cycle for Staples Easy Rebates is supposed to be:

1) Pending (which the website is waiting to get the transaction
info, should be less than a day)
2) Pending Return Interval Complete (waiting to make sure you
don't return it within the allowable period, typically 14 days
for technology items)
3) Fulfillment (there are a few different steps here but the
bottom line is they're paying you).

For some rebates (including some of mine), they are never
getting past &quot;Pending&quot;, even though we have received email
saying that they found the information. And then some people got
their rebates rejected as &quot;invalid purchase date&quot;, even though
it was correct. And stuff seems to showing a different status
online than they really should be. I.e., you'll get &quot;we've got
it&quot; email, which means that they have gotten your transaction
info and verified your rebate. But when you look online, it
still shows &quot;Pending&quot;.

It's sad that it's broken like this because for the first coupon
of weeks that they had it running (late October/early November)
it worked great, and rebates were paid very quickly. But my
mid-November, things were broken, and they have not gotten much
better since then. In fact, they had to take the entire site
down for a few days after &quot;Black Friday&quot; (the day after
Thanksgiving), apparently it was overloaded.

"/> Thanks for sharing, Bill and appreciate you explaining the process. So
this has happened to you several times? And what type of reaction do
you get from the customer service department in response to some of
these complications? As with all things, sounds like they are trying to
iron out the kinks with the new process.
