Venezuelan, US Oil Co's Sign New Agreement

Caracas, Sep 12 (Prensa Latina) Petroleos de Venezuela SA and US
Harvest Vinccler companies signed an agreement to reorganize the joint
Petrodelta venture under the Hydrocarbon organic law, sources of the
sector report.

A PDVSA release Wednesday informed that the agreement was signed by the
Venezuelan Oil Corporation, on the national side, effecting the change
of the operational agreement to a new modality, according to the
legislation currently in force.

As the Venezuelan representative, CVP Executive Eulogio del Pino signed
the document, while James Edmiston, Petrodelta president, and Vice
Presidents Kart Nesselrode and Kurt Nelson inked the text on the US
side.

Del Pino said Petrodelta is a very important joint venture because,
with National Assembly approval of additional areas such as IsleC1o,
Temblador and El Salto, it will be possible to increase production in
three or four years from 14,000 barrels to 50,000 daily.

He highlighted that the entity will play an essential role in the
Orinoco Socialist Project, because it is located in southern Monagas
State, &quot;a very needy region, where the old oil industry came with the
traditional exploitation model.&quot;
