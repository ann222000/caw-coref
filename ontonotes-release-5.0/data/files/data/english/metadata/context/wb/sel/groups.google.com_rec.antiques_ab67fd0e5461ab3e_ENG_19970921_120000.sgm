Hello,

I have some newspaper clippings (front pages) etc, that I would like
to preserve. Is there anything that I can use that will help stop or
slow the yellowing?

Please also email me with a response.

Thanks,
Brock

Rule 47 (or is it 89); information given must be
shared with the group.
Keep it out of the sun (such as: hid it in a closet !). Also,
There is a solution you can soak the newspaper in, which will
help preserve it - perhaps it just makes the paper acid-neutral.
Someone else will have to confirm/supply the &quot;solution&quot;.

you must spell out thedoctor, else post here.
