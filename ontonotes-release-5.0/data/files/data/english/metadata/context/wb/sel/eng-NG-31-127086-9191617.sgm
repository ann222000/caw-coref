Hi all.  Frequent Lurker, here.  I've learned a lot from you folks over
time.  I've most recently been dealing with neck/skull/shoulder pain and
some brachial parasthesia for about 10 months since a MVA.  I've had lumbar
pain/sciatica for 10 years or more, so I'm no stranger to hurting.

A neurosurgeon says I'm a candidate for C5-6 fusion w/ autograft from hip
and titanium plate.  This would entail full removal of disc.  MRI shows
stenosis/osteophytes through several C vertebrae.  I'd like to hear some
feeback from those who went through similar Sx.

I take: naproxen 500 BID, Cymbalta 60 BID, Lyrica 75 BID, hydrocodone 5 PRN
(about 20-40mgs/day lots of APAP).

Thanks,
M

sorry, not much help for the question you asked. I had a simular
surgery to my lumbar area and it was very successful. in that area
a year later, I'm still completely pain free. lol just the rest still
hurts.

but i'm more concerned over the list of meds you state. you're not
on very much naproxen and then you're overlapping it with apap
an i'm not sure if the hydrocodone has apap in it as well. I hope your
doctor is testing you often for liver damage. it can sneak up on you
quickly when taking too much apap. but I'm confused as to why
you're taking both cymbalta and lyrica, they basically do the same
thing.

best of luck to you. just check out your doctor carefully and ask them
for patient referals, don't be scared and call them, ask them how they
feel today. while having a fusion is a 50/50 shot, it works on some and
fails on some, at least you'll get an idea of his bedside manners.

Of the surgries I've had (5) the C5-C6 has been the best. It has corrected
the pain and I've had no reacurance. As for the lyrica can work on pain
receptors while cymbalta is is more for depression.

Hope all goes well and if you have more questions there are people musch
more knowledgable than me.

Thanks.  All the APAP is from the hydrocodone (Vicodin 5/500 'round these
parts). Lyrica and Cymbalta are very different, though both have shown some
efficacy w/neurologic pain.  Cymbalta helps my sciatica greatly, and helps
somewhat with depression.  Lyrica's new to me, so I'm not sure about that,
yet.

Hi M,

Oct 9th I will be having a fusion with rod and screws... Because my bones
are paper thin (bone
density test proved this out) I am not a candidate for the titanium plate
which would have been
the first choice...  I will have cadaver bone instead of bone from my
hip....  Hope you will be able
to find relief in the near furture...

Think long and hard about this. I had a herniated dick at C6-C7 parts
of which had migrated into the spinal canal to T1. I was told it would
help my arm pain and my severe headaches. That didn't happen. What has
happened is that my cervical spine is destabilized at C5-C6 with
bulging at all levels above pressing on multiple nerve roots on both
sides with varying severity. I only have occasional tingling in my
left arm but there is some muscle dis-coordination in both hands (I
drop things and sometimes have trouble writing.)

Now a little about the surgery: It was really an easy surgery. Little
to no neck pain the first two days. I was up and walking the second
day. Then my neck hurt. What hurt the most was my hip. After walking
for a couple of hours that subsided too. I did suffer some spinal cord
damage that affected my abdominal area. I could not urinate for three
days without a catheter so they kept me during that time. Long term
abdominal and right leg problems not related to the surgeon just the
luck of the draw.

I wish I had explored alternative procedures (and there are
alternatives) from bone trimming to disk trimming and/or disk heating
to reduce its spread. You can always get the fusion later if more
conservative treatments fail.

You should ask your neurosurgeon if your paresthesia will go away or
if it is permanent.

Your pain medication is a little lacking in the opioid category. If
you are seeing a pain specialist immediately locate a new on willing
to treat chronic pain with better pain control. If you are not seeing
a pain specialist do so immediately.

Get a second opinion from another neurosurgeon not associated with
your neurosurgeon just to be sure of your options.

Google and read up on treatment options for your condition and learn
as much of the medical jargon as you can so you will be able to
understand what your doctors say and write.

I wish I had not gotten the fusion. I didn't do any of the above
except get the second opinion but I later learned it was an associate
of my neurosurgeon (They NEVEER contradict each others treatment
options unless it is life threateing)That's my 2 cents worth.

cymbalta and lyrica are both used to help with neurological pain.
as with elavil different dosages are used as to if it's treating

or nerve pain. none of that has ever helped me even though I have mild
nerve pain. and again I say, you state you're taking naproxen as well as
apap. those 2 combos at high enough doses WILL cause liver damage.

&gt; I suppose you've already heard every comment and lame joke about setting

&gt; thought (ouch!) to come up with new &quot;material&quot; for you. BUT...for
&gt; starters, you will be one of the very rare people with documentation
&gt; that you do not have a single screw loose! Not many of us can lay claim
&gt; to that distinction.

&gt; &lt;groan&gt; sorry.....had to...no doubt there will be more! What is your
&gt; expected hospital stay before you get to go home and be waited on hand
&gt; and foot by hubby?

&gt; PS....do you need a delicate bell for your bedside? I know I'd need a
&gt; Navy Claxon! (hoping I spelled it right).

Don't believe all the stories about our rods and screws setting off the
alarms at the airport. First time I went through I set the alarm of but
the alarm guy showed me with his wand it was my belt. All that time I
carried the  medical card ths says I have medical hardware in my back. The
guy could have looked at the card at least. Point being most the newer
hardware doesn't set off the alarms. I ere on the safe side though.

Thanks for your $.02.  I'm planning on a 2nd opinion, of course.  As far as
the opiates, you know the game.  I asked my PCP why I'm taking so much
tylenol and he gave me the hairy eyeball as if I had asked for heroin. Can I
ask when you had your Sx? I've known people who had (lumbar) fusion 20yrs
ago who would not have done it had they known, and two who had (1 lumbar, 1
thoracic) this within the past couple years and wondered why they didn't
have it done sooner.

i have bad cervical - did a fair amount of research before having to
rule it out - am not a candidate for fusion since i'm also brittle

are you aware of the comparatively new replacement cervical disc(s) that
are only now coming on the market here in the states?

used over in europe, but always slower to be approved here - might be
worth your checking out.

donation site from hip can take longer to heal and become comfortable
than the neck itself.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Hi all.  Frequent Lurker, here.  I've learned a lot from you folks over
&gt;&gt;&gt;time.  I've most recently been dealing with neck/skull/shoulder pain and
&gt;&gt;&gt;some brachial parasthesia for about 10 months since a MVA.  I've had
&gt;&gt;&gt;lumbar
&gt;&gt;&gt;pain/sciatica for 10 years or more, so I'm no stranger to hurting.

&gt;&gt;&gt;A neurosurgeon says I'm a candidate for C5-6 fusion w/ autograft from hip
&gt;&gt;&gt;and titanium plate.  This would entail full removal of disc.  MRI shows
&gt;&gt;&gt;stenosis/osteophytes through several C vertebrae.  I'd like to hear some
&gt;&gt;&gt;feeback from those who went through similar Sx.

&gt;&gt;&gt;I take: naproxen 500 BID, Cymbalta 60 BID, Lyrica 75 BID, hydrocodone 5
&gt;&gt;&gt;PRN
&gt;&gt;&gt;(about 20-40mgs/day lots of APAP).

&gt;&gt;&gt;Thanks,
&gt;&gt;&gt;M

&gt;&gt; Think long and hard about this. I had a herniated dick at C6-C7 parts
&gt;&gt; of which had migrated into the spinal canal to T1. I was told it would
&gt;&gt; help my arm pain and my severe headaches. That didn't happen. What has
&gt;&gt; happened is that my cervical spine is destabilized at C5-C6 with
&gt;&gt; bulging at all levels above pressing on multiple nerve roots on both
&gt;&gt; sides with varying severity. I only have occasional tingling in my
&gt;&gt; left arm but there is some muscle dis-coordination in both hands (I
&gt;&gt; drop things and sometimes have trouble writing.)

&gt;&gt; Now a little about the surgery: It was really an easy surgery. Little
&gt;&gt; to no neck pain the first two days. I was up and walking the second
&gt;&gt; day. Then my neck hurt. What hurt the most was my hip. After walking
&gt;&gt; for a couple of hours that subsided too. I did suffer some spinal cord
&gt;&gt; damage that affected my abdominal area. I could not urinate for three
&gt;&gt; days without a catheter so they kept me during that time. Long term
&gt;&gt; abdominal and right leg problems not related to the surgeon just the
&gt;&gt; luck of the draw.

&gt;&gt; I wish I had explored alternative procedures (and there are
&gt;&gt; alternatives) from bone trimming to disk trimming and/or disk heating
&gt;&gt; to reduce its spread. You can always get the fusion later if more
&gt;&gt; conservative treatments fail.

&gt;&gt; You should ask your neurosurgeon if your paresthesia will go away or
&gt;&gt; if it is permanent.

&gt;&gt; Your pain medication is a little lacking in the opioid category. If
&gt;&gt; you are seeing a pain specialist immediately locate a new on willing
&gt;&gt; to treat chronic pain with better pain control. If you are not seeing
&gt;&gt; a pain specialist do so immediately.

&gt;&gt; Get a second opinion from another neurosurgeon not associated with
&gt;&gt; your neurosurgeon just to be sure of your options.

&gt;&gt; Google and read up on treatment options for your condition and learn
&gt;&gt; as much of the medical jargon as you can so you will be able to
&gt;&gt; understand what your doctors say and write.

&gt;&gt; I wish I had not gotten the fusion. I didn't do any of the above
&gt;&gt; except get the second opinion but I later learned it was an associate
&gt;&gt; of my neurosurgeon (They NEVEER contradict each others treatment
&gt;&gt; options unless it is life threateing)That's my 2 cents worth.

&gt;&gt; Mike

&gt;Thanks for your $.02.  I'm planning on a 2nd opinion, of course.  As far as
&gt;the opiates, you know the game.  I asked my PCP why I'm taking so much
&gt;tylenol and he gave me the hairy eyeball as if I had asked for heroin. Can I
&gt;ask when you had your Sx? I've known people who had (lumbar) fusion 20yrs
&gt;ago who would not have done it had they known, and two who had (1 lumbar, 1
&gt;thoracic) this within the past couple years and wondered why they didn't
&gt;have it done sooner.
&gt;M
">

Sorry, not completely sure what Sx refers to. If it is when I had my
fusion, that was in Aug/2002. Another neurosurgeon I saw that the UCSF
pain clinic referred me to said that an anterior fusion was only half
of the treatment. He said that a posterior procedure would complete
the treatment and minimize nerve impingement.

My neurosurgeon was top notch. The scar on my neck is virtually
invisible.

I don't know enough about your condition or situation to tell you what
to do. I am only trying to give you food for thought. There are so
many things you can try before doing the one thing that cannot be
undone. Another neurosurgeon I saw about getting evaluated for
Epidural Steroid Injections told me to wait until they can rebuild my
spine and re-grow nerves and the spinal cord before letting anyone
touch my neck again. He also pointed out why the radiologist was wrong
and that my spine had destabilized a lot and continues to do so
because of the fusion. He approved me for the injections, just what
the insurance company thought he would not do...

You can always email me if you like.

No one can tell me what to do--even the docs!  Just looking for, as you say,
food for thought.  And I've been doing a lot of thinking.  It's tough,
because I want to get better, and not mess around anymore with things that
don't help.  I'm not jumping into anything right away, though.

x,

You need to see a pain management doctor ASAP. Ask your PCP for a
referral. He is never going to give you the pain medication you need -
based on what you wrote about him. They can be Dr. Jekyll until the
question of pain medication comes up then they turn to Mr. Hyde.

No matter what you do about your neck, proper pain reduction would
help. A pain specialist has more at his disposal than just pain
medications. There are procedures that may reduce your pain while you
weigh the merits of different treatment options.

Try to get an urgent referral request to make it happen sooner.
Please, don't live with the pain and inadequate treatment. I know
where that can lead!

Everyone is different but all tricyclic antidepressants ever did for
me is fog my reality and make me constipated. I tried amitriptyline
and nortriptyline. I agree they help some people. It is also important
that people taking these medications for pain be told that there are
potential tradeoffs besides the constipation: impaired thinking,
memory loss and personality changes. Some of these conditions come
about from the abnormally high doses it sometimes takes to achieve
pain reduction. People need to know that using these medications may
affect their job performance and their relationships with friends and
family.

If someone could figure out HOW these drugs help reduce pain then
maybe a drug targeted at pain reduction could be developed.
Personally, I suspect the pain reduction comes from the brain/body
alterations that these drugs cause. The same alterations that impair
memory, alter behavior and affect sexual function. Maybe we just don't
remember the pain due to impaired short and long term memory.

Hi!
I'm so glad to have found you!!!  I've had two recommendations for
cervical fusion surgery in three places.  Both neurosurgeons used same
MRIs - same diagnosis and same recommendation for surgery - BUT one
said that bleeding would be a major concern - I'd definitely need at
least one transfusion and I'd be in intensive care for three days.
The other said there would be practically NO bleeding and I'd go home
the next day (possibly even that day).  Guess which I chose!  And he's
performed over 5,000 of these operations.  He said he found in using
the bone from the hip there was much more problem with the hip
afterward!!!  Now he uses a synthetic material for disc replacement.

I'm on very little medication because I'm so stubborn - but I'm
&quot;suffering&quot; more and more.  I expected &quot;pain&quot; meant severe &quot;pain&quot; but
I'm coming to the conclusion - and I'm asking all of you for opinions/
advice here, (in addition to the numbness, tingling, etc from the disc
problem) that what I'm experiencing is an inability to concentrate,
poor memory at times, extreme irratability, personality change, etc.
Are these &quot;typical&quot; or am I losing my mind too???  Also, nagging, pain
in my back - hurts to do most everything (sitting, standing, driving,
turning my head, going up and down stairs, etc.) after a short period
of time.

The doctor prescribed Panlor DC but I've not taken it because it
contains codeine and I'm VERY allergic to Codeine.  The doctor felt
the Codeine was such a small amount it wouldn't bother me - but after
being hospitalized from the reaction to Codeine many years ago, I stay
away from it at all costs.

I'm sorry to be so long winded - PLEASE GIVE ME ADVICE!  Thanks so
much!

Some of that sounds like what I call pain rage. Hurting for so long,
unrelenting pain pushes us to anger and depression. Forgive me if you
already mentioned this but are you taking Depakote, Topamax, Lyrica or
Neurontin  or any other anticonvulsant or anti-depressant for pain
prophylaxis? Anti-convulsants and some anti-depressants may give you
side effects like the symptoms you describe. But it could also just be
the pain wearing away your good judgment and interfering with normal
memory processes. For me it was primarily the anti-convulsants but it
is also part of my migraine aura to get irrationally angry. My family
knows when I am going to have a migraine before I do. Pain interferes
with our ability to think and remember.

As for the procedure, Just as long as he doesn't use cadaver bone you
should be OK. They say it is safe but when I asked if they were able
to remove prions from cadaver bone before its use he answered, you can
self donate... The synthetic option wasn't available.

This procedure can prevent additional nerve and cord damage but do not
count on it to make any part of your arm's or hand's tingling and
numbness get better. Ask your neurologist just what to expect after
the procedure. I am not a doctor so remember to ask your doctors about
anything that concerns you. Sometimes they do not know about the long
term effect pain has on us, that is one place we can help you.

My wife and I had fusion at C5-C6. We both had the doc use bone from the
hip. We both have favorable results from the surgery. I think we both
spent over night in the hospital and that was that. We had to wear collars
for 3 -6 weeks, not sure of that though. This sugery turned out better
than my lumbar surgeries. No blood transfusion was needed and we spent no
time in intensive care. If have more questions this is a good group to ask

&gt; away from it at all costs.

&gt; I'm sorry to be so long winded - PLEASE GIVE ME ADVICE!  Thanks so
&gt; much!

Howdy, Nancy!

Forgive me for not being able to tell, but have you already had the
artificial disc replacement done?  Did he use a Charite disc?

If you haven't had it done, i'm asking you to do a LOT of research before
having a Charite used in you.  One place you'll want to check is the FDA
Adverse Event Reports on the disc.

http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfMAUDE/Search.cfm

Under Brand Name, enter Charite.  That only gives you 242 of the over 500
complaints entered.  For some reason, if you do a search on the FDA Adverse
Event Reports, it won't keep the search. I can't seem to find the way in to
find the full amount, but it is terrifying.  Did your doctor tell you that
it is practically impossible to extract the disc if it causes problems, due
to the high mortality rate?  Did he tell you about the disc causing more
nerve damage?  Did he tell you about the over 300 lawsuits against J&amp;J for
this product?  (that's just one big lawyer in NYC...there are several
smaller ones.)  Did he tell you about the problems they had in Europe, where
the disc was first tried?

I have a close friend who had the Charite put in around mid-July.  Glen is
in horrible agony, and in much worse shape than he was before the surgery.
A Dr. Rosen at UC Irvine has been dealing with patients like my friend....he
is going to help Glen.  He has successfully extracted 35 or so.  Do a search
for the articles Dr. Charles Rosen has written concerning the disc.

Please realize that my complete freak-out was in fear for your safety.  I
don't want to see another person go thru what many have already suffered.
There have to be folks who have gotten better after getting the disc....but
please be informed about the decision.

deep peace,
Lavon

&gt;&gt; Hi all.  Frequent Lurker, here.  I've learned a lot from you folks over
&gt;&gt; time.  I've most recently been dealing with neck/skull/shoulder pain and
&gt;&gt; some brachial parasthesia for about 10 months since a MVA.  I've had
&gt;&gt; lumbar
&gt;&gt; pain/sciatica for 10 years or more, so I'm no stranger to hurting.

&gt;&gt; A neurosurgeon says I'm a candidate for C5-6 fusion w/ autograft from hip
&gt;&gt; and titanium plate.  This would entail full removal of disc.  MRI shows
&gt;&gt; stenosis/osteophytes through several C vertebrae.  I'd like to hear some
&gt;&gt; feeback from those who went through similar Sx.

&gt;&gt; I take: naproxen 500 BID, Cymbalta 60 BID, Lyrica 75 BID, hydrocodone 5
&gt;&gt; PRN
&gt;&gt; (about 20-40mgs/day lots of APAP).

&gt;&gt; Thanks,
&gt;&gt; M
