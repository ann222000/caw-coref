Enguerrand I de Coucy repudiated his wife Ada de Marle for her adultery. At least he waited until after Ada died when he abducted Sibil de Porcean, wife of Godefroid, comte de Namur. He married her despite the fact that she was still married to Godefroid (who later divorced her and married again.

For his actions Enguerrand was excommunicated by the Church. He sought to make amends by taking part in the First Crusade; between 1096 and 1099 he fought heroically in the Holy Land.

During one battle with the Moslems he mislaid his banner; he tore off his coat of scarlet lined with squirrel fur, and cut out a new emblem from it. Thus was born the celebrated description of his arms: &quot;Fasse de vair et de gueulle de six pieces&quot; (fessy of squirrel fur and gules of six parts), which would bear the name of Coucy on many battlefields.

Enguerrand's excommunication was lifted through the help of his kinsman, also called Enguerrand, the bishop of Laon.

3. Ida's marriage to count Godfrey I of Louvain is assumed for the year 1105. The marriage period 1087-1103 for count Godfrey of Namur is sufficient to have a marriageable daughter in ca.1105. A firstborn daughter in 1088 could have been married in 1100 or before the elopement of mother in 1103.

Great! We are coming to fine tuning. I have that Godefroid de Namur divorced
Sibil de Porcean about 1104 The bigamous marriage, of course, took place
before. But you have lost me a little. &quot;Ida's marriage to count Godfrey I of
Louvain is assumed for the year 1105&quot; I have (well ES) two daughters
Elisabeth and Flandrine, for Godefroid de Namur and Sibil de Porcean. Where
does Ida fit in?

Help! This may make me change a small biography I am at present entering
into my database.

The confusing part (for me) is that Godefroid has no daughter Ida, he has 1st marriage Elisabeth and Flandrine 2nd marriage Clemence, Adele/Ermesinde and Beatrice. Also I don't see a Godfrey I of Louvain in that period. Perhaps this Godfrey I of Louvain was known by another name?

Godefroid de Namur's mother was Ida of Saxony and so the name Ida may well be part of this family.

Dear Leo
Thankyou for this interesting little bio of Enguerrand de Coucy.  I was
going to cut and paste it into my database, and noticed a previous posting
by Peter Stewart in 2004, (see below).  Your two posts differ slightly in
that in yours you say that Enguerrand repudiated Ada, and in Peter's he says
that Ada repudiated her first husband to marry Enguerrand.
Were there two repudiations?
Merilyn Pedrick
Seigneur de Boves de Coucy.Historians usually prefer to follow sources that
refer to the father as Enguerrand &quot;de Bova&quot; (de Boves) and to the notorious
son as Thomas &quot;de Marla&quot; (de Marle).Both men are called count, sometimes of
Amiens and sometimes of Coucy, but other sources name them merely as lords
in the same timeframe.Enguerrand took possession of Coucy with the
complicity its heiress, Ada. She then repudiated her first husband, the
negligent castellan Alberic de Beaumont, and married Enguerrand: Marle and
Coucy belonged to him only by right of his wife.These events took place,
according to Dominique Barthélemy, in 1079 - I haven't checked this point -
and computing from the year of his parents' marriage and the fact that
Thomas himself departed on crusade in 1095, indicating that he must have
been at least 15 years old at the time, Barthélemy places his birth in 1080
The birthdate of 1044 for Ada is unfounded. She was said to be daughter of
Letald de Marle, but given the chronological stretch in this genealogy she
may have been his granddaughter.

of Godefroid, comte de Namur. He married her despite the fact that she was

You may have him as Godfrey I of Brabant, aka Godfrey the Bearded - he was
count of Louvain from 1095, then became duke of Lower Lorrain (that is,
Brabant) from 1104. The family of his wife Ida is not certain, it is thought
that she was probably a daughter of Odo II, count of Chiny by Adelais/Alix
of Namur (who was a sister of the Godefroid above).

Your memory is correct, Roger - the thread (another marathon, of 76 posts)
is at

http://groups.google.com.au/group/soc.genealogy.medieval/browse_frm/t...

and the most relevant discussion of clear evidence gets underway from
message #42 on 6 November last year. I haven't got round to looking into it
further so far, and certainty for me about the Chiny connection had very
nearly but not quite reached 100% when I considered it last year.

I should add that the small lingering doubt over this is whether Adelais of
Namur, who was the mother of Bishop Adalbero II of Liège and his sister Ida,
might have been married to another, unknown, husband (who was their father)
before Count Odo II of Chiny. The chronology of her parents' and siblings'
marriages would allow for this possibility, but there is no direct evidence
for it as far as I am aware.

On the biographical side of the family de Coucy, Barbara Tuchman wrote
in 1978 a book called &quot;A distant mirror&quot;. It came out in 1980 under
the Dutch translation &quot;De waanzinnige 14de eeuw&quot;.

Leo,

Additional to the previous post I noticed a few lines on the
'bastard'  (according to a certain monk Guibert of Nogent) Thomas van
Marle and his stepmother Sybille, wive of his father the lord of
Coucy, and the lives and times in France around 1112.

It can be read in Georges Duby's, 'Ridder, vrouw en priester. De
middeleeuwse oorsprong van het moderne huwelijk', 2e druk 1987 ( La
Chevalier, la Femme et le Prêtre. Le mariage dans la France féodale,
1981), chapter VIII Guibert van Nogent.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Leo,

&gt; Additional to the previous post I noticed a few lines on the
&gt; 'bastard'  (according to a certain monk Guibert of Nogent)
&gt; Thomas van Marle and his stepmother Sybille, wive of his
&gt; father the lord of Coucy, and the lives and times in France
&gt; around 1112.

Guibert of Nogent casts doubt on the paternity of Thomas, almost certainly
(though even this has been interpreted differently), but at no point does he
call him a bastard.

It appears more likely that a question was current, when Enguerrand was
trying to disinherit Thomas at the behest of Sybille, over which of Ada's
two successive husbands had actually sired the boy, rather than any scandal
that he had been conceived from an extramarital liaison.
