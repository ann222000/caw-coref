Let me start by saying we are now in the dog days of summer in
Clearwater.  Whether you are in the business of selling time shares or
stealing souls things are bound to be slow this time of year.  Having
said that the down town area is as dead as I have ever seen it.

There are several reasons for this, most importantly that the new
causeway bridge routes beach bound traffic around the down town area.
Cleveland St., the &quot;main drag&quot;, is no longer U.S. 60 and Ft.
Harrission is no longer Alt. U.S.19.  This means that with the
exception of the public library and a hand full of businesses there is
no reason for anyone to even drive through the area unless they are
CoS.  The Sand Castle is now effectively on a Cull DE sac since you
have to go back up the hill to access the bridge to the beach.  The
&quot;beautification&quot; project  has transformed Cleveland St. into a foot
traffic mall with two lanes for local vehicular delivery.  This may
change when some of the new condos are occupied and the non-
scientology staff population of down town goes up, but that may not be
anytime soon in this real estate market.

Some time back the mayor talked the CoS into easing off on the
uniforms because they gave a quasi &quot;military occupation&quot; look to the
area.  This resulted in several different coloured uniforms of a less
military look.  Now it has gotten to the point that few uniforms are
seen at all.  Every now and then there is some event at the Ft.
Harrision but other than that things are pretty dead.  There is some
traffic on &quot;Blood Ally&quot; on the north side entrance of the building
around meal times, but even then there are no lines as in the past.
The publix supermarket and shopping center that opened up on Ft.
Harrison some time back is never very busy and the parking lot always
has plenty of spots available.  I'm not sure, but I wouldn't be
surprised if some of the staff were not working in St. Petersburg and
Tampa due to their recent expansion there.

The entire area is dominated by the Super Power building which should
be called the Fortress of Solitude.  If it were at the north pole it
couldn't look anymore dead and foreboading.  Even Matrix tends to
growl and get uneasy when we walk past.  Funny how architecture can
take on an aura of evil.

I'm not sure how many people are aware of the complete coverage of the
down town area with cameras.  This goes way beyond building security
since many of them are mounted to cover the streets and public areas
and not private property.  Just another way to give the area a &quot;cozy&quot;
feeling.

All in all there is not much excitement in Hubbardville.  I will post
anything I think may be of interest if it occures but for now it's
pretty boring.

Hi, Uncle Bruce,

A few years ago, I wrote to one of the reporters on the SP Times about
the camera coverage downtown. She was intrigued, so I put her in touch
with a local who gave her the walking tour. It was written up in the SP
Times as part of a larger article, so I'm pretty sure people who read
that paper are aware of it.

Also a while ago, someone did a photo essay of downtown CW. It was just
surface streets, closed shops etc. Should you feel inclined to stir your
retired bones and stray into the Dead Zone with a digital camera, the
effort would be appreciated. We've already seen pix of Superpower, the
Ft. Homicide, etc. But a photo essay of the empty streets in the middle
of the day on a weekday would be interesting.

Maybe we could get everyone to do the same in their downtown areas. I
guarantee you that, unless they're in Bugtussle Arkansas or something,
Clearwater would win the 'Moribund Downtown' contest hands down!

Dear Uncle Bruce!

That's only great news (except for the few non-cultist owners in downtown
CW). CW is void. Stats are low. People traffic and even car traffic is dead.

How come a town can be so fast transformed by some SP into some sort of a
terrible desert, humanly speaking?

Thanks a lot for the news.

You have to keep in mind that we are only talking about the downtown
area.  Clearwater is a thriving city in a thriving area and the CoS is
small potatoes in the over all picture.  If you take a quick trip to
the beach you will see development worth many times the CoS's total
investment in the area.  As I mentioned, this time of year is rather
dead routinely.  Also, they have spread out somewhat from the way
things were a few years ago.  They have a number of new locations in
the Tampa Bay area all of which have to draw staff from somewhere.
The bottom line is that things may have slowed down for the CoS but
the city itself is far from a desert.  The main point of my posting is
that there isn't much of interest going on with the CoS downtown at
this time.

I'm not sure of what you mean by &quot;some SP turning the place into a
desert&quot;.

Thanks for the update.

I'm a little puzzled by what the CoS wants here, with Clearwater...
Isolation, e.g. traffic rerouting and slow takeover of local
businesses?  Privacy?

Or do they want a busy area of non-Cos / CoS people mixing so that
they can attract more business?

Always seemed like a strange mixed message to me, the privacy vs.
revitalization thing, maybe someone can enlighten me here? =)

You have to keep in mind that we are only talking about the downtown
area.  Clearwater is a thriving city in a thriving area and the CoS is
small potatoes in the over all picture.  If you take a quick trip to
the beach you will see development worth many times the CoS's total
investment in the area.  As I mentioned, this time of year is rather
dead routinely.  Also, they have spread out somewhat from the way
things were a few years ago.  They have a number of new locations in
the Tampa Bay area all of which have to draw staff from somewhere.
The bottom line is that things may have slowed down for the CoS but
the city itself is far from a desert.  The main point of my posting is
that there isn't much of interest going on with the CoS downtown at
this time.

I'm not sure of what you mean by &quot;some SP turning the place into a
desert&quot;.

Yes, I meant indeed the part of the downtown where the fraud cult bought and
built buildings and uses its slaves to ruin its clients and weakens
xenu-city by getting undeserved tax exemptions for its crookery.

&gt; &gt; have to go back up the hill to access the bridge to the beach.  The
&gt; &gt; &quot;beautification&quot; project  has transformed Cleveland St. into a foot

&gt; &gt; change when some of the new condos are occupied and the non-

&gt; &gt; anytime soon in this real estate market.

&gt; &gt; Some time back the mayor talked the CoS into easing off on the
&gt; &gt; uniforms because they gave a quasi &quot;military occupation&quot; look to the
&gt; &gt; area.  This resulted in several different coloured uniforms of a less

&gt; &gt; seen at all.  Every now and then there is some event at the Ft.
&gt; &gt; Harrision but other than that things are pretty dead.  There is some
&gt; &gt; traffic on &quot;Blood Ally&quot; on the north side entrance of the building
&gt; &gt; around meal times, but even then there are no lines as in the past.
&gt; &gt; The publix supermarket and shopping center that opened up on Ft.
&gt; &gt; Harrison some time back is never very busy and the parking lot always
&gt; &gt; has plenty of spots available.  I'm not sure, but I wouldn't be
&gt; &gt; surprised if some of the staff were not working in St. Petersburg and

&gt; &gt; The entire area is dominated by the Super Power building which should

You and I both kid!  From what I got out of the books I read L. Ron
was pretty much on the run and under the gun when these decisions were
made.  He had more or less run out of ports that would allow his
ship(s) of fools to dock, at least in any civilized country.  He was
&quot;persona non grata&quot; in a number of countries and could expect the same
anywhere he went.  He was more or less forced to return to the U.S.
At that point he had a number of things he was looking for in a new
Land Flag Base.
By it's nature Flag would have to be near the sea.  It would have to
be in some small town where most people had never heard of Scientology
or LRH.  It should be in a run down urban area where almost anyone's
investment would be welcome.  A mild year around climate was desirable
and it had to be near a major airport.  Along with this there was some
talk about the very name of the place, CLEARwater being considered.
Keep in mind that the downtown area was really in bad shape in the
seventies.  The Ft. Harrison was the largest building in the downtown
area and it was a dump.  Most of the major real estate was in the same
shape and available for a song.  And, as in many decisions made by the
CoS, this one may defy rational analysis.
In any case like all the decisions LRH made there was zero chance he
would admit error once it had been made.
The results have been mixed.  While on the one hand the area has been
greatly improved as far as infrastructure is concerned there is little
diversity The CoS dominates the downtown area to the point of making
it a campus.  No entity, secular or religious should totally dominate
any urban area.  There HAS been a lot of new construction of high rise
living space and if they manage to sell it to people other than
Scientologists the area may change.  If in fact the CoS is having
problems finding new &quot;raw meat&quot; and they fail to draw large numbers to
the S.P. building they may lose their domination of the area.  all
that remains to be seen.

Thanks for the report - much appreciated.  Tampa org seems to have a
lot of the 'kinder, gentler' uniforms these days. I have heard that
Flag staff are sent there for training.

I think the cameras are part of the organizational, policy-driven
paranoia. Making  'safe space' or 'theta space' has always been the
goal.  It's wierd how they tout how powerful Scientology is, but it's
so weak it can't flourish without a controlled environment.

A Sea Org member admitted in court once that there are over 100 Scn,
Inc. &quot;security&quot; cameras pointing all over downtown Clearwater.  So
remember to wave and smile!

Thanks again B
Please keep us posted.. I'm really interested in the progress of the
SP building.

Maybe the hole in the side of the building is for people to test their
new flying SuperPowerz!!!
