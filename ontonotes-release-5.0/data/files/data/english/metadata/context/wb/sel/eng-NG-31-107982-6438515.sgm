I have recently received a stamp from Bohemia / Moravia, Michel 34 (The
Olomouc Holy Trinity -- 2 kcs -- engraved by Karl Seizinger). Do any of you
know where in Michel Böhmen-Mähren is listed?  I simply cannot find any such
listings for more details about this stamp. For your information a similar
stamp of 5 kcs was issued for Czechoslowakia, Michel 358.

Thanks in advance for any hints.

Hi Gerhard,
Thanks!  I just found it on my own, and had hoped to be the first to answer
my own question ;-)  Deutsche Besetzungsausgaben [German Occupation Issues]

Thanks, also to you. As you will see from my recent answer to Gerhard
Reichert, I have found it on my own in an old German Catalogue, Michel
1997/1998. How silly of me not to think of that at first :-)

G'day Mette,
apologies for new thread, I had just completed
a OE "maintenance" and cannot regurgitate the orig thread.

That particular image appears 3 times in B&amp;M, as an overprint,
and on the 2k and 2.5k.
I have high def scans of the complete set if you so require,
I am unaware if the same engraver worked all of them,
but you would think so.
I am not aware either, if this set comes with attached "tabs"
as a lot of B&amp;M do.
Can you offfer any info on the subject of that issue please
(the holy trinity) ?
Cheers.

As an aside,
can anyone advise the story behind the
unusual box cancels that adorn many B&amp;M stamps?
eg: 2 over 70, 2 over 235, in small curved corner boxes.
Thanks

G'day Mette,

G'day Rod,

Yes, there are several of such overprints. On Olomouc I don't have much
info, but the BM-stamps as such might interest. They are engravings by Karl
Seizinger (the German equivalent to Slania). Details about the stamps as
such are on my Olomouc-page within the World Heritage-subject:
http://worldheritage.heindorffhus.dk/frame-CzechRepOlomouc.htm

More interesting might be Gerhard Batz' excellent website about Czech and
Slovak Art Stamps
http://www.batz-hausen.de/seizeng.htm

Regards from Denmark, temporarily buried in snow -- and another blizzard
expected later in the day ...

Mette

Great page, good fun, I found secret initials on about half,
(perhaps he likes to tease)
I hadn't realised he was the engraver of the "old view of Zagreb"
which is in my "My top 10 stamps of all time".
He shared a lot of issues with another engraver that I feel is just
as good, Bohumil Heinz.
I went looking for Bohumil and bumped into Karel, who share the
Gibbons Catalogue just one year apart.

Thanks for the links.
