Like in many countries in the world, the tanks and guns is in power in
Myanmar for 40 years now. It will kill those who try to snatch power
from them. No matter what happened,  the generals will  NOT give up
power. This the reality in Myanmar.

Yes. the demonstration by the monks and lay people in Myanmar was good
for the media....thousands marching with banners....chatting slogans.
It is almost like Hollywood.

The monks and people demostrated for almost 10 days now.  What have
been achieved? They got more sympathy from USA and western
countries...who have been trying to dispose the generals.  NOTHING
else.

Will the general resign ?   No.
Will the monks take over power ?  No.
Will the US stooge take over power ? No.
Will Myanmar became a democracy ?  No.
Will the USA invade Myanmar and remove the generals ? No.

As far as the people is concerned....they got absolutely nothing.

What is the price that the people have to pay...for their foolishness?

One has been killed and 3 injured....many got beaten. More will
certainly be killed, if the demostration continue.  How many more are
prepared to die ?  100,...1000,...10000....100,000..

Bush killed over 600,000 civilian Iraqi.....I think the generals are
quite prepared to match him...in order to stay in power.

In this contest...the tanks and guns vs the people .....there is only
one winner.

The winner is still the Generals. Their tanks will take over powers.
Even if people can take over powers, there is only Aung Sung Su Ki to
take over. But she has been in house arrest for so long and she has
not has any administrative expereicne at all to run the country. THe
only assistance she can get is from the UN or the USA.

Not the USA, unless she think another a country like Iraq is
desirable. If
she wants democracy, Mynarmar's democracy must rely on the people of
Mynarmar.

The people of Myanmar have been living under a totalitarian military
dictatorship for over 4 decades now, and Western Powers haven't budged

the West depends too much on the heroin that comes from there?

Oil and heroin are NOT the reasons for USA to be interested in
Myanmar. The CIA could get limitless cheap supply of heroin from
Afghanistan and Latin America. CIA openly consort with poppy growers
in Afghanistan.

The USA wanted to remove the anti-American regime in Myanmar for a
much stronger reasons...to preserve its status as the sole
superpower.
In order to achieve this, the US continued with the policy of
containment of China even decades after the cold war was over.
As part of this grand design...the US seek to control

The USA has very good reasons for spending billions on its effort to

The ONLY power capable of holding Myanmar together,  preventing the
separatists from quartering the nations into different states.....is
the Generals.

NO one, not even the USA,  is able to keep Myanmar as a whole country
if and when the general were removed from power.

Yes. Should the generals fall from power....Myanmar will see a long
period of total chaos with .....massive killings... inhuman suffering
and miseries for the people,....different warlords fighting for
control of the disputed land.....may be far worse than it is in Iraq
now.

The USA hope to sow such chaos in Myanmar....so that China become

Yes it may not be possible for this barehand flesh and blood fight in
Burma. This was also because Burmese are largely comprised of monks
instead. The large numbers of devotees and their devotion to monkships
in the early age made their lives so subdue to the miltary regime. In
addtion there is no reverred figurehead in Burma to be admired bby the
miliarty regime's Generals. As there is no King, the generals are the
Kings.

But in Thailand, it was not the same. The people revolts instead. In
the past the Thais had street demonstration in opposing military coup
and so on - under the reverred strength of their Thai King. The
military coup regime  also have t o respect and listen t the King.
This made military regime as representative of the King instead.

If say theB urmese's showdown of protests with the miliitary is
successfully, and, if democracy is given back to the people, do you
think the people of Burma is able to manage democracy instead.?

Do you think Burmese have the leaderships of people to handle the
throngs of problems in the democratic life, given that Burma has been
still in the 60s era; and that the people has been under caged in
military rule for more than 40 years without much update, and worse,
not much economic activities at all.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Yes it may not be possible for this barehand flesh and blood fight in
&gt; Burma. This was also because Burmese are largely comprised of monks
&gt; instead. The large numbers of devotees and their devotion to monkships
&gt; in the early age made their lives so subdue to the miltary regime. In
&gt; addtion there is no reverred figurehead in Burma to be admired bby the
&gt; miliarty regime's Generals. As there is no King, the generals are the
&gt; Kings.

&gt; But in Thailand, it was not the same. The people revolts instead. In
&gt; the past the Thais had street demonstration in opposing military coup
&gt; and so on - under the reverred strength of their Thai King. The
&gt; military coup regime  also have t o respect and listen t the King.
&gt; This made military regime as representative of the King instead.

&gt; If say theB urmese's showdown of protests with the miliitary is
&gt; successfully, and, if democracy is given back to the people, do you
&gt; think the people of Burma is able to manage democracy instead.?

&gt; Do you think Burmese have the leaderships of people to handle the
&gt; throngs of problems in the democratic life, given that Burma has been
&gt; still in the 60s era; and that the people has been under caged in
&gt; military rule for more than 40 years without much update, and worse,
&gt; not much economic activities at all.

It is a highly unlikely scenario.
But, let's assume that Allah somehow removed the Generals...
will democracy have a chance to take root in Myanmar ?

Myanmar is not unlike Iraq...it is a countries with different
ethnic tribes, different level of social development...from
peasants in the Mountains to business men in the city of
Yangon...
Without a strong hand in control, Myanmar is likely to
disintegrate into  complete chaos  where  war lords would
fight for control of local areas.,,there will be large scale
unrest ..or even  civil wars.
Would democracy have a chance in such chaotic landscape...
Only idealist would say yes....realists would sadly shake their
head in despair.

Common people would have to suffer a far worse fate than
they are under the dictatorship of the current Generals.

The current situation, though far from ideal, but with help
from ASEAN, China and India it could improve.
Against  the economic sanctions from the West, Myanmar
could still achieve reason level of development which would
benefit the people.
If there was no political threat, such as the current demo, the
Generals will eventually be forced  by economic realities, to
relax their control...to open up.
Like China, the tight political hold will slowly give way to
a free market economy.  This is a better route for Myanmar.

But the USA and human rights agitators would not allow
this to happen...they want to put their man in charge of
Myanmar.

Unfortunately....Myanmar road to development is set back a
few notches with the current political problems. Like the
snake a ladder game...back to square one.

&gt; &gt;&gt; You are making stupid comparison !
&gt; &gt;&gt; Su Ki and her party was elected by the people of
&gt; &gt;&gt; Myanmar but overthrown by military. Has Francis
&gt; &gt;&gt; Seow been elected ? He was not even elected as MP
&gt; &gt;&gt; not to say as PM !!!! hahaha !

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Like in many countries in the world, the tanks and guns is in power in
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Myanmar for 40 years now. It will kill those who try to snatch power
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; from them. No matter what happened,  the generals will  NOT give up
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; power. This the reality in Myanmar.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Yes. the demonstration by the monks and lay people in Myanmar was good
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; for the media....thousands marching with banners....chatting slogans.
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It is almost like Hollywood.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The monks and people demostrated for almost 10 days now.  What have
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; been achieved? They got more sympathy from USA and western
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; countries...who have been trying to dispose the generals.  NOTHING
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; else.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Will the general resign ?   No.
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Will the monks take over power ?  No.
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Will the US stooge take over power ? No.
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Will Myanmar became a democracy ?  No.
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Will the USA invade Myanmar and remove the generals ? No.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; As far as the people is concerned....they got absolutely nothing.
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The winner is still the Generals. Their tanks will take over powers.
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Even if people can take over powers, there is only Aung Sung Su Ki to
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; take over. But she has been in house arrest for so long and she has
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; not has any administrative expereicne at all to run the country. THe
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; only assistance she can get is from the UN or the USA.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Nonsense !
&gt; &gt;&gt; China has never worried about the border with
&gt; &gt;&gt; Myanmar !
&gt; &gt;&gt; If US started to heavily invest in Myanmar, that
&gt; &gt;&gt; will really worry China.
