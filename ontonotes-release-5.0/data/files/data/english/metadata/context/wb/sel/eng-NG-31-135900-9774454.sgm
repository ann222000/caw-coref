Hi,

As promised to Mr. Mastruko - something to be *really* excited about
if you're into monster wargames :)

What's different from the regular WitP :

I'm seriously considering WitP, especially after this announcement. I have
recently had a number of very good UV games - even the scenarios without
carriers are fun. The more I play, the more I'm getting to appreciate this
system.

Looks very good. However I am slightly disappointed by the
expected release date. I expected less ambitious project, but sooner.
Next summer, in gaming, may well mean &quot;in the next life&quot; :o) I try not
to even think about games further than 2 months away....

Also, I don't understand why it's going to be released as
&quot;expansion&quot; for those who already own WITP? Does not seem like smart
idea. Why not make it into standalone product? I don't see much logic
(business or otherwise) behind this decision. For those who are hooked
on WITP this is pretty much a must buy anyway, standalone or not. For
those who heard legends about WITP, but didn't take a plunge yet, WITP
AE standalone is much better proposition than buying WITP first, then
AE later (I mean, why?).

I think we're going to see a &quot;bundle pack&quot; offer - get both WitP + the
expansion pack for $10 more or so. That way they can sell some
additional WitP games on top of the expansion pack. I dunno - wait and

I hope so.  I never bought WITP but I'd seriously consider this version.

Agreed - it should be standalone. The thing'll probably cost at least 40
bucks. Add the price of WiTP and Matrix's high shipping rates and you've
got +$120 in one game. That's a pretty steep price for a game.

I find that decision quite weird too, especially given the general spruce up
that they have given to the graphics. Matrix claims that changing the
resolution would mean big changes to the game engine. Well coded games
shouldn't need vast amounts of rework to incorporate additional screen
resolutions. Maybe they tried it and the text and icons came out too small?
Who knows. But I thought it was quite a bizarre decision, especially given
the popularity of widescreen monitors these days compared with their target
date where uptake would be even higher.

Perhaps with enough complaining they will changed their minds? :)

We haven't set a price yet - and what's this about our high shipping
rates?  From what I've seen, they're about the same or better as any
other wargame company out there.  We don't get a single penny from

Unlikely, though not completely impossible - WITP was in development
for 6-7 years before it was released in 2004.  We have done about as
much as can be done with that engine in the expansion.  From what I've
heard from the programmers, multiple resolution support would be a
massive can of worms.  WITP does support a Windowed mode and always
has and it looks fine on big screens even though it's not in native
res.  I can't say I really understand folks who would miss out on this
because it doesn't run in their favorite resolution - there's never
been anything like what WITP + AE is going to be in terms of detail,
gameplay and realism for the entire Pacific Theater and who knows when
someone will do something like this again in a higher res.

If higher res support ever gets in, it will be post-release if there's
a technical breakthrough.

And this is the very point. Are you aware that by changing the scale from 60
miles/hex to 40 miles/hex you will have an immense map while still being
forced to look at it in a small 1024x768 window? It will be like playing the
old &quot;Fire in the East/Scorched Earth&quot; in the &quot;Europa&quot; series while looking
at the map only through a magnifying glass.

&quot;Monster&quot; wargames where the player must be able to conduct operational and
strategic operations in the... er... whole PTO *need* the possibility to
contemplate as much of the map as possible on screen in the planning phase -
maybe even whole sub-theatres. This happens in TOAW, where I'm now enjoying
monster scenarios at 1920x1200 and it is like looking at the old paper maps
on the cellar table.

IMHO, limiting this &quot;window&quot; to a fixed rez was a fundamental planning
mistake in WitP - and with a still bigger map the results will be still more
claustrophobic.

If you read what the people working on WiTP:AE are writing in the Matrix
forums, it becomes very clear that they are not being given the time or
resources to do major programming changes.  Re-writing Grigsby's DOS-based
graphics display is one of the things deemed &quot;not worth&quot; the time and
effort.

Basically, WiTP:AE is just further tweaking, stretching and banging on code
that was badly written twenty years ago.  The company is unwilling to spend
the time and money necessary to actually address the underlying problems.
If you look at the people who are doing the work, almost every one of them
is a player, not a Matrix or 2by3 employee.  The two or three who are
employees, while they have been working very hard on patches, are the people
brought in years after the program was released and not part of the original
WiTP team.  Now consider that even the original WiTP team was simply working
on expanding the existing Uncommon Valor code, which itself was a port of
something earlier....

I bought WitP yesterday as I have been having a blast with UV and wanted
more of the same - just bigger :) I'm amazed at how much extra is built into
this system, even though they both look superficially the same. I do have a
question though...

In UV I can select between 800x600 and 1024x768 from the options panel. I
haven't been able to find the same option in WitP. I'm sure it's just me
being thick and it's right there in front of my eyes...

As for the resolutions issue, I have to say that on my machine it looks fine
and the aspect ratio even looks good, despite the widescreen nature of my
LCD display. That said, from the quick test I played, you don't get to see
an awful lot of real-estate at one go, which for a grand strategic game is a
bit of a let down. I'm guessing my system is currently in 800x600 mode
(until I find the relevant settings) and this might be exasperating the
issue.

I will buy the add-on pack when it arrives as the game system is so unique.
But then again I have already been bought into the whole thing after playing
a number of scenarios in UV. I wonder how the add-on would look to new
people of the series? Requires original game and doesn't support modern
screen resolutions?

Higher res should be supported, PERIOD.

Same goes for Empires in Arms. And Guns of August. And....

I don't think it's that hard to do at all. I think part of your
job is to make us, the players, think it's a job comparable to moving
a mountain, because if you admit it can be done, and relatively easy,
you will be swamped with requests to do it for other games as well.

To me, releasing a game without variable resolution support in

Um.. the graphics for WITP are most certainly not &quot;DOS-Based&quot;.  They
just don't have support for variable resolutions - it's hardly the
only game with that requirement.  Also, the project as is will have
been underway for over two years by the time it's released, with work
by over two dozen people during that time.  How much more time and
resources do you think it should have had?

Incorrect - WITP was written as a new engine from the ground up,
without 20 year old code.  However, it took more than 5 years to
develop by the time it was released in 2004.  Rewriting a game of the
scope and complexity of WITP is not a project to be undertaken
lightly.  I think you could easily be looking at a 6+ year timeframe
and an astronomical budget for a wargame.

You're off-base again - yes, 2by3 is working on their Civil War Game
now.  However, most of the same folks at Matrix that were involved in
WITP are involved in AE.  Also, the new team is frankly larger and
able to do more than 2by3 would be able to do at this time.  The
choices made here were in fact a way to give WITP more time and
resources than it could have otherwise had.

As far as UV... WITP was always the development goal.  UV was released
along the way to WITP, it was not the goal itself.  It's more accurate
to say that UV was &quot;WITP in progress&quot; rather than that WITP was built
on top of UV.  Neither one was a &quot;port of something earlier&quot;.  I
honestly don't know where folks who were not involved in the project
get these so-called facts.

IIRC UV, which is based on same engine as WITP, did in fact have
two resolution options - 800 x 600 and 1024 x 768. All WITP did was to
omit the ancient 800 x 600 as unneeded. So, if two variable
resolutions are/were possible for UV I really don't see how hard it
must be to introduce 1280 x 1024 or any other popular res for that
matter.....

OK; so I am not a programmer so who am I to say.... anyhow it
saddens me to see leading wargame publisher pushing fixed-res, low-res
entertainment products in 2007..... and apparently 2008 as well I
guess.

BTW I remember the similar outcry regarding 32-bit color depth
for WITP. Original color depth was 16-bit which does not look good on
new LCD screens. Request for 32-bit color depth was initially brushed
away as unneeded, too much work and nigh on impossible, comparable to
sending a manned mission to Saturn, only to be introduced relatively
quietly in the next patch. Ha! So it was possible after all? That's
why I said it's probably a part of your job to make every little
request look like huge impassable mountain of work :o)

The point I'd make here is that even if we put aside games which were
already developed and which already have been left behind by the growth
of screen resolution technology, it's still frustrating - as gamers - to
find developer after developer *today* refusing to support the rapidly
growing number of screen sizes and shapes.

So, OK, nobody at 2by3 could foresee the widescreen / hires monitor.

&lt;cough!:bullshit&gt;

Dear Developer of 2007:  *You* have no fucking excuse for not seeing
that 1024x768 isn't going to cut it in a year ... if it even does now.
Please don't be an idiot, and build hooks for higher resolutions into
your code.  Because when you try to sell me a new version of your game
two years from now, I'm going to be on Oleg's side.

Yeah, those were the only two resolutions the engine supported. It
also supports windowed mode,  This is not a request of necessity,
frankly it's one of luxury.  The game will work and run fine on all
higher res widescreen systems. It just won't use them to their
maximum.  In order to do that, we could literally have spent half or
more of the project time on that one luxury feature.  I'm sure you'd
be happy with the list of other improvements we would have had to
discard (read: most of them) in order to make that one minor
improvement.

Would I like to see WITP in 1680x1050?  Heck yes, but it was not a
realistic option.

We've got titles that also support higher resolutions, but not all of
our pre-existing engines can do that.  We've been encouraging all
future development to support higher resolutions, but it's not
possible in all cases.  This is a request we're very much aware of,
but I'm frankly surprised coming from a WITP vet that you would have
effectively put high res ahead of all the other feature improvements
we made.  It's not as if we downgraded the resolution of the game you
already know and love - we kept it the same while improving just about
everything else.

Not in this case.  I'm telling you how it is - I don't recall what the

engines that would be a minor change compared to adding a resolution.

You know, you might consider that hardware in this case changed pretty
quickly.  Wargame developers generally work on games for longer than
mainstream developers as well and also have much smaller budgets.  A
mainstream developer/publisher can build a new engine every year or
two, a wargame engine often has to last for 5+ years.

Back in 1999 when WITP development started?  I'm sure they considered
it possible, but it was hardly more than 1% of the market at that
point.  Everything in development is a process of trade-offs and it's
rare that a major feature that 1% of the market will enjoy is high on
the list.  If development on WITP's engine would have started in 2005,
you better believe it would have supported high res and widescreen.

If only it were that easy...  like I said, for new engines we're

unlikely to happen until there's time and budget for a new engine or

I think this is an area of conflict, though, in that panels have become
so huge and hi-res these days that it almost feels ... *nuts* to look at
a 1024x768 postage-stamp in the middle of a 1900x1200 widescreen panel.
As Vinnie points out, TOAW supports giganormous resolutions, and it's a
half-dozen years *older* than WITP; clearly, some developers foresaw the
increasing resolutions and planned for them.

Does it?  I can summarize the future for developers in a single
sentence:

SCREENS WILL GET *BIGGER*; PLAN FOR THIS.

This is as true now as it was in 199X.  Every day, it seemed, screens
got bigger, and higher resolution, and cheaper.  There was a brief pause
as the LCD took over from the CRT, but now the process will only
*accelerate*.

Dudes.  Plan for this.

My point is that the *trend* - bigger screens, cheaper screens, higher
resolutions - was well-established even in 1999.  And some games - TOAW,
an obvious example (though I have more) - just look better and better
and better every time I buy a new screen.  Some games make me stare at a
tiny postage stamp.

Here's my practical, life-experience-based problem with screen
resolution and game engines, though:

Low-graphics programs scale to new resolutions like a dream.  Microsoft
Word, for example, works as perfectly and beautifully on a 1900x1200
screen as it does on an 800x600 tube.

High-graphics programs scale to new resolutions like a dream.  When the
5000x2400 panel comes out, the boys at Valve will release an update for
HALF-LIFE EPISODE 1 that encompasses this.  It'll be free to registered
owners.

This is just an observation.  I really don't know what to make of it.

My guess is because 2x3 is not affiliated with the expansion. This is

Even Tiller's old Battleground games run at whatever screen res you're
using.  Those are over ten years old.  It's hard to understand why a
map-based game should have problems with that.  I can see why a FPS or
other 3D type game would have problems.

I'll bet.  All the more reason to assume from the get-go that trends in
computing are going to continue and accelerate ... not stop.  And in
this case, we have a painfully apt example, in that they're looking to
sell us a &quot;new&quot; product - and one that would *really* benefit from
higher resolutions - that was clearly built as though 1999's top of the

Guns of August v1.2, released with 1024x840 res only, now supports
resolutions up to 1600x1200 (incl WS).

Of course this does not mean that it is as easy for other games; it
all depends on how the graphics engine is coded.
If it is difficult to add new resolutions to  WITP, I can understand
that the team is focusing on new functionality for the expansion
rather than spending a sizeable part of the budget on rewriting the
graphics engine of the parent game.

If WITP2 came out with a fixed res, then I would share your ire.

Empires in Arms switches the screen resolution to 1024x768 - I can
live with that.

What I have trouble accepting is that when I &lt;alt&gt;&lt;tab&gt; to the Empires
in Arms manual, which was clearly designed for higher resolutions, the
resolution does not switch back to my default, but *stays* at
1024x768.

As Empires in Arms is programmed in Delphi I'd like to share with
everyone how bloody difficult this is to get right.

Below is the *complete* code of a demo app which switches the
resolution to 1024x768 for that app but which on &lt;alt&gt;&lt;tab&gt; or
minimize or whatever else which takes you out of the app switches your
screen resolution back to the default, and, of course, when you
&lt;alt&gt;&lt;tab&gt; back into the game or whatever changes it back to the
resolution the game prefers.

- start of code -

unit Main;

interface

uses
Windows, Messages, SysUtils, Variants, Classes, Graphics, Controls,
Forms, Dialogs, StdCtrls;

type
TfrmMain = class(TForm)
procedure FormClose(Sender: TObject; var Action: TCloseAction);
procedure FormCreate(Sender: TObject);
private
{ Private declarations }
Procedure ChangeResolution(iWidth: Integer; iHeight: Integer);
Procedure AppActivate(Sender: TObject);
Procedure AppDeActivate(Sender: TObject);
public
{ Public declarations }
OrigScreenHeight : Integer;
OrigScreenWidth : Integer;
end;

var
frmMain: TfrmMain;

implementation

{$R *.dfm}

procedure TfrmMain.FormCreate(Sender: TObject);
begin
// save the original setting
OrigScreenHeight := Screen.Height;
OrigScreenWidth := Screen.Width;
Application.OnActivate := AppActivate;
Application.OnDeActivate := AppDeActivate;
end;

procedure TfrmMain.FormClose(Sender: TObject; var Action:
TCloseAction);
begin
// change back to the original screen resolution
ChangeResolution (OrigScreenWidth,OrigScreenHeight);
end;

// Called when the app receives the focus
Procedure TFrmMain.AppActivate(Sender: TObject);
Begin
// Change to what the application needs
If ((Screen.Width &lt;&gt; 1024) or (Screen.Height &lt;&gt; 768)) Then
ChangeResolution(1024,768);
end;

// Called when the app loses focus
Procedure TfrmMain.AppDeActivate(Sender: TObject);
Begin
// Change to the default setting
ChangeResolution (OrigScreenWidth,OrigScreenHeight);
end;

// Actual procedure which changes the display resolution
procedure TfrmMain.ChangeResolution(iWidth: Integer; iHeight:
Integer);
var
a : Boolean;
i : LongInt;
DevM : TDEVMODE;
begin
i := 0;
With DevM Do
Begin
Repeat
a := EnumDisplaySettings(pchar(0), i, DevM);
i := i + 1;
Until (a = False);
End;
DevM.dmFields := DM_PELSWIDTH or DM_PELSHEIGHT;

DevM.dmPelsWidth := iWidth;
DevM.dmPelsHeight := iHeight;

ChangeDisplaySettings(DevM, 0);
end;

end.

- end of code

Took me half an hour to get it working and all of the above code was
either in the help file or on the 'Net. It's trivial to get it right,
so get it right. No excuses.

&gt; Took me half an hour to get it working and all of the above code was

Lol this is like being at work! This code will work fine for GDI based
stuff, but if they are using (and I don't know) direct-x they will need a
different approach.

To me this whole resolutions thing is bizarre. Coding a game to support all
resolutions supported by the current graphics card is a trivial task.
Wargames are especially suited to this as all you have to do is show more of
the map! There might be issues around bitmaps or text being too small, but
both of these can be worked around too.

I can see where it would be a problem with WitP. Some of the UI
buttons (on the bases screen for instance) are small enough already. I
can see where  trying to click them on a high-rez screen would be a
nightmare unless they scaled the windows.

Not that I have a problem with WitP at it's standard resolution. IMO
it looks good enough running on my widescreen in full-screen mode.

Sure - then you do stuff like this (snippet from my own code based on
a DirectX component set):

if Key = VK_ESCAPE then // or you could go back to the launch pad
Close;

if (ssAlt in Shift) and (Key = VK_RETURN) then //  Screen mode
change
begin
DXDraw.Finalize; // basic ALT-ENTER stuff
if doFullScreen in DXDraw.Options then
begin
RestoreWindow;
BorderStyle := bsSizeable;
DXDraw.Options := DXDraw.Options - [doFullScreen];
end
else
begin
StoreWindow;
BorderStyle := bsNone;
DXDraw.Options := DXDraw.Options + [doFullScreen];
end;
DXDraw.Initialize;
end;

-

Short : It's even more trivial in DirectX.

I think WitP looks good at 1680x1050 too. My one issue with it is that one
doesn't get to see an awful lot of real estate at once, which can make it a
little bit harder to take in the overall picture. If this game supported
1680x1050 it would look simply stunning - would probably sell a lot more. I
guess the question is down to what Mr Rutin's mentions. Is it worth a
disproportionate amount of development time or should this be invested in
improving the mechanics of the game?

IMHO as a wargamer, if someone told me &quot;You can either have 2 years
worth of feature improvementsto WITP or 1 year of feature improvements
+ an additional resolution&quot; I know what I'd pick...

AE is an expansion pack for WITP.  It has a LOT of amazing stuff to
offer, but it does not replace the WITP engine with a new one.  When
we come around with WITP II, feel free to slam us if we don't support
higher resolutions.  Right now, we're doing what the vast majority of
our customers wanted us to do with the original WITP.

It would have been if they had had the foresight to create a graphics
engine that supports any res the video card and/or monitor does. I've
got plenty of games that do this so it is their fault for creating a
slow and clunky graphics engine in the first place.

It's not a problem for 3D games. 3D graphics are scalable to any res.
The problem is some developers not putting in hooks to support other
resolutions and/or aspect ratio. Some 3D games can be easily fixed with
text file editing and a few require editing the hex code in the exe file
because they hard coded the supported resolutions. Here's an example,
EA's F1 '99-02' doesn't support 1680x1050 widescreen but GTR, which is
based on the same graphics engine does.
