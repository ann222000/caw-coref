[from Geof. Riggs; not Eliz. H., my better half]

Incorrigible query, granted; but I'm curious (regardless of whether or
not this has been asked here before) as to readers' current orders of
preference in the Shak(e)speare canon.

FWIW, here is mine &quot;[f]rom top to toe&quot;&lt;G&gt; (with 9 paragraph divisions
marking off wider levels of overall quality):

2. Macbeth

3. Hamlet
4. Measure for Measure

6. Coriolanus

7. Antony and Cleopatra
8. Othello
9. Julius Caesar
10. Troilus and Cressida
11. Henry V
12. 2 Henry IV
13. 1 Henry IV

14. Midsummer Night's Dream
15. Romeo and Juliet
16. Tempest
17. Timon of Athens

18. As You Like It
19. Richard III
20. Sonnets

21. Much Ado about Nothing
22. Taming of the Shrew
23. Merchant of Venice
24. All's Well that Ends Well
25. Love's Labor's Lost

26. Winter's Tale
27. Phoenix and Turtle
28. Rape of Lucrece
29. Comedy of Errors
30. Venus and Adonis
31. Scenes from Sir Thomas More
32. King John
33. Richard II
34. 1 Henry VI

35. 3 Henry VI
36. 2 Henry VI
37. Two Gentlemen of Verona

But fun. No time to think an order out but will say for now I rate Merry Wives
much higher than you, and Twelfth Night first. For me, HIV, 1 and HIV, 2 are a
hundred times better than HV because of Falstaff. Timon of Athens is my least
favorite Shakespeare work. MND is in my top ten as is The Tempest. I think
tragedy is a much over-rated class but Hamlet, Macbeth and Lear would probably
make my top ten. I think Julius Caesar by far his best history, which is
interesting from an authorship point of view considering that it isn't English
History, and the out-of-his-life crowd think he knew English history from the
inside.

I'll come back to this, I suspect.

how high they pass the &quot;memorable&quot; test and carry us into something
strange and awsome. bb

Well, all the plays have merit for *some* audience, so
I'm not surprised we'd all widely disagree and/or agree.
Much depends on having experienced the play and
the quality therein. I found more than a few of them
intimidating on the page and glorious on the stage.

I didn't think I'd return so soon. I'd put Caesar and HIV, 1/2, below Wives,
but reversed (because I don't consider HIV, 1/2 quite a history). I would
probably would insert other plays into my top ten if I really thought about it,
but don't wanna right now. I'll just add that Loves Labours Lost is a very
difficult one to rank because it's very funny but also possibly his worst
constructed play, and construction is important to me.

I based my rankings on a combination of personal enjoyment when watching,
how satisfying I feel they are to act in or direct, and how popular they are
to audiences in general.

The Premiership

1 Twelfth Night (deepest range of characters, very funny but with a dark
heart, always seems to work no matter what the setting)
2 Othello (an incredibly electric play on stage, as well as probably the
most satisfying roles I've played)
3 Macbeth (always amazing to watch, but falls down a bit because the
range of good characters isn't so great)
4 Midsummer Night's Dream (the most idiot-proof play in the canon - no
one can get this wrong, surely)
5 Henry V (my first love affair with Shakespeare; patriotic and
jingoistic, antiwar and
6 King Lear (another play with a huge range of good characters to play,
but the lead role often overwhelms the actor, perhaps normally because they
take it on too old, meaning it's often unsatisfying for me)
7 Merry Wives of Windsor (Falstaff's starring role. 'Nuff said, surely?)
8 Much Ado About Nothing (Brilliant lead roles, great suppoinrtg parts,
audiences love it; I've never acted in it, or it might go a couple of
notches higher)
9 Hamlet (I can admire the writing, but I don't find it as satisfying
intellectually or dramaticall as a lot of critics)
10 Tempest (nice writing and characters, shame about the plot)

The First Division

11 Henry IV Part 1 (The only split between the two parts for me is that I
love Hotspur, otherwise they're a match for each other)
12 Henry IV Part 2
13 Taming of the Shrew (the funniest play of all; the writing's not as
high quality os Much Ado or Merry Wives, but otherwise it's superb)
14 Coriolanus (would be much higher if I didn't allow for how relatively
unpopular this is; probably up to between 5th and 7th)
15 Romeo and Juliet (would be much lower if it weren't for its continuing
popularity with audiences, I don't appreciate this one that much, maybe down
to 26th or 27th)
16 Richard II (doesn't seem to be popular for performing, which I find
surprising given the quality of the writing. I enjoy reading it, but would
be hard pressed to find a character I'd like to play. I#d love to dreict
this one though, I know I could do a lot with it)
17 Richard III (a bit rough around the edges, and not a very deep set of
roles, but Dick is a great piece to watch someone tear a cat in)
18 Merchant of Venice (been in it twice, enjoyed it enormously once and
hated it second time around, seems very sensitive tohow the director chooses
to do it to me)
19 Winter's Tale (I keep revisiting this one, as I think it has more to
offer than appears at the moment. One day I'll figure it out, until then it
languishes quite low down)
20 As You Like It ( I can't see anything I'd like to play in it, nor does
it inspire any great thoughts for directing it)

The Second Division

21 King John (coming up fast; I've always enjoyed reading this, but
didn't think it was stageable until Greg Doran's RSC production)
22 Comedy of Errors (nice straightforward comedy, I've enjoyed acting
this one, but no particular depth)
23 Pericles (oh I wish this wasn't corrupt, when I've seen it done
sensitively it's seemed worthy of top 10 status)
24 Troiuls and Cressida (I like this quite a lot, but it's a long way of
being top-drawer work, mainly in terms of audience satisfaction. It's quite
difficult to stage well, I find. If it was just on readability, I might
push this up to 17th or 18th)
25 Love's Labours Lost (enjoyed acting this, but it doesn't have the
depth of satisfaction of some of the other comedies. The wordplay means you
have to know it well, either acting or reading it, to get a lot of the
humour, which tends to pass audiences by)
26 All's Well that Ends Well (well I like this as a plot and as a play,
but I don't like either Bertram or Helena - I think they deserve each other
completely)
27 Henry VIII
28 Julius Caesar (It has Brutus, and ... oh wait, that's it. This one
has never done it for me. And can directors please stop setting it in a
modern fascist state, please?)
29 Henry VI Part 3 (slightly higher ranked than the other two parts,
mainly because they read similarly badly, but I've seen this one done quite
well on the stage)
30 Antony &amp; Cleopatra (doesn't work on stage for me. seen it 6 or 7
times and i find it stupefyingly dull, sorry)

The Third Division

31 Two Gentlemen of Verona (I was surprised how much I enjoyed directing
this a couple of years ago; it's weak next to most of the comedies, but if
you take it on its own merits it can be fun)
32 Henry VI Part 1 (I really need to see this, and part 2, before I can
make a proper judgement on them, but they're not the most popular of plays
to produce)
33 Henry VI Part 2
34 Cymbeline (I had a laugh playing Iachimo a couple of years ago, but
the general plot is pretty rubbish, and I cringed every performance at
making the audience sit through that interminable last scene. Nice songs,
though)
35 Measure for Measure (There's Angelo as ana ctor's role, and that's all
this has to recommend it. It seems too sour and dark to me, and wilfully
enigmatic at the end)
36 Edward III (Yes I include this, and there are a cuple of lovely bits
in it, but in general it's badly written and dull to watch)
37 Titus Andronicus (Don't like it. Makes a good unintentional comedy,
though).
38 Two Noble Kinsmen (Very marginal play. I'm actually enjoying
rehearsing this at the moment, but I've seen it on stage and it's pretty
dull)
39 Timon of Athens (it's awful. Awful, awful, awful. It reads badly, it
performs badly, it just doesn't work. And it's awful)

Hope that's of some interest

I have to distinguish between what I've seen performed and what
I've only read. Most of the plays that I really like, except for
Troilus and Cressida and the majority of the histories, I've also
seen in movie versions. If I were to see a good performance of Two
Gentleman of Verona I might like that as well. Favorites would
have to be Twelfth Night, Hamlet, H5, Titus Andronicus, Troilus
and Cressida, RIII, 1,2H4, Measure for Measure, Cymbeline, Winters Tale
and Tempest.
But I really like all of the history plays that I've only read (would
really like to see a good complete performance of the H4 plays)
and I like most of the plays except TGV and Midsummer Night's Dream,
although MSND has plenty of great lines, I just don't care for
the story much. AYLI is not a great favorite of mine for reading
but again if I saw a good performance I might like it a lot, and
Othello used to be a favorite of mine when I first began reading
Shakespeare long ago, but now I find it somewhat unbelievable.
Plenty of great poetry in it though. Timon seems to me to be
unfinished, and I can't figure out what's going on some of the
time.

&gt;&gt; Incorrigible query, granted; but I'm curious (regardless of whether or

&gt; Funny, I've seen it spelt with a hyphen but never parentheses.

"/>

My own eccentricity. If I wanted to be even more eccentric, I'd simply
spell it &quot;Shakspeare&quot; and be done with it. But that might make readers
think the missing &quot;e&quot; was simply a typo. Does no one any good.

Fact is, the Bard never placed an &quot;e&quot; there in any of his signatures,
nor, as I recall, is there any silent &quot;e&quot; in the first syllable in the
two authorized publications of his two narrative poems.

Unfortunately, as shown by the play on his name (&quot;the only Shake-scene
in a country&quot;), it was clearly pronounced with the long &quot;a&quot;. Modern
readers faced with &quot;Shakspeare&quot; might pronounced it as &quot;shack&quot;, which is
definitely wrong. Retaining the silent &quot;e&quot;, albeit set apart in some
way to denote its lack of authenticity, seems the only alternative, IMO.

I'm not necessarily wedded to the paren as the only way of doing that, BTW.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; 10. Troilus and Cressida

&gt; Wow, top ten?

"/>

Yup. He 's trying for something really unusual in Troilus, and the
feeling of a world turned topsy-turvy is peculiarly appealing in today's
world, IMO.....well, it certainly is to me anyway.....

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; 11. Henry V

&gt; It's a guy thing

"/>

LOL! I guess I'm enthralled by this play because of certain
individual speeches. And above all, there is the deeply stirring way in
which so many thematic strands of the entire dynastic struggle in all 8
main history plays are brought together in Henry's haunted wanderings
around the camp on the night before Agincourt (Act IV).

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; 15. Romeo and Juliet

&gt; Has to be the most overrated of all

"/>

I would agree there are places where everything is not really fleshed
out. But it's unusual in that here we have a tragedy with all the
makings of a standard comedy through much of it. The way that such
expectations are dashed -- and the way those dashed expectations are
depicted -- makes this entry exceptional and an important breakthrough, IMO.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; 19. Richard III

&gt; Wha? This is a fantastic play. What do
&gt; you not like about it? It's my favorite.

"/>

Actually, all the entries that I've placed at #20 or higher I
fundamentally like.

I agree that Richard III is essentially a fine play, of course. But it
has to be judged against the genius of his later plays, IMO. Judged by
that yardstick, I don't feel that -- once we're past Richard himself,
Buckingham and Margaret -- most of the other characters have _quite_ the
complexity of most of the characters in the greatest tragedies.

Perhaps I should have placed a big demarcation line after the Sonnets,
since everything from the Sonnets on up here are basically fabulous
anyway, IMO.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; 29. Comedy of Errors

&gt; The worst.

"/>

Just a thought -- and I mean no disrespect here: is it possible that one
should judge it on its own merits as clearly the shortest play in the
canon and hence (sometimes, perhaps?) performed as part of a double
bill? A slight work perhaps, but lively and inventive, IMO.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; 39. Cymbeline

&gt; Read it again. Think of it as &quot;Imogen&quot;
&gt; as she is the star (Cym is an idiot with
&gt; stolen kids, a bitchy wife, a freaky stepson
&gt; and what--about ten lines total? The
&gt; male lead, Posthumus, is a dolt, but, hey,
&gt; it has a chase scene)

"/>

This does have Imogen, yes. But the very fact that all the characters
do not exert an equivalent pull is really a flaw, IMO. By absolute
standards, this is hardly a poor play -- primarily because of Imogen, no
question. But judging by the Bard's own standards, this has to be rated
as fairly spotty, I feel.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; 40. Titus Andronicus

&gt; Sorry, but this is a great play. You march right
&gt; back to the canon and apologize.

"/>

Frankly, I agree with another poster here that Titus is occasionally
unintentionally comic. Of course, there are individually haunting
speeches, but the whole does not hang together -- except as sheer
voyeurism, IMHO.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Well, all the plays have merit for *some* audience, so
&gt; I'm not surprised we'd all widely disagree and/or agree.

Granted -- and neither am I.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Much depends on having experienced the play and
&gt; the quality therein. I found more than a few of them

Measure for Measure is a prime case of that, I feel. It exerts a
profound effect on the stage, but it's a bit harder maintaining the
complexity of the relationships in one's head when simply reading it.

Anyone merely reading this piece can never truly experience its blinding
genius.

&gt;&gt; 1. King Lear

&gt; can't argue

&gt;&gt; 2. Macbeth

&gt; I just think the title character is boring

&gt;&gt; 3. Hamlet
&gt;&gt; 4. Measure for Measure

&gt; Yes, this is a worthy rank

&gt;&gt; 5. Twelfth Night

&gt; This is one of several formula plays that I don't
&gt; find to be so outstanding

&gt;&gt; 6. Coriolanus

&gt; This is the highest I've ever seen anyone

&gt;&gt; 7. Antony and Cleopatra

&gt;&gt; 17. Timon of Athens

&gt;&gt; 18. As You Like It

&gt; This is one of the best in my book.
&gt; It lets the audience in.

&gt;&gt; 19. Richard III

&gt; Wha? This is a fantastic play. What do
&gt; you not like about it? It's my favorite.

&gt;&gt; 20. Sonnets

&gt; I find it difficult to just lump them into a category.
&gt; But I'd rate them very high for intrigue.

&gt;&gt; 21. Much Ado about Nothing

&gt; About right--midrange.

&gt;&gt; 22. Taming of the Shrew
&gt;&gt; 23. Merchant of Venice
&gt;&gt; 24. All's Well that Ends Well
&gt;&gt; 25. Love's Labor's Lost

&gt; About right.

&gt;&gt; 26. Winter's Tale
&gt;&gt; 27. Phoenix and Turtle
&gt;&gt; 28. Rape of Lucrece

&gt; Well, it's no play but it is a tight little story
&gt; and I find it engrossing and underrated.

&gt;&gt; 29. Comedy of Errors

&gt; The worst.

&gt;&gt; 30. Venus and Adonis
&gt;&gt; 31. Scenes from Sir Thomas More
&gt;&gt; 32. King John

&gt; This is not a great story but has many enjoyable characters
&gt; and that alone hoists it up for me.

&gt;&gt; 33. Richard II
&gt;&gt; 34. 1 Henry VI

&gt;&gt; 35. 3 Henry VI
&gt;&gt; 36. 2 Henry VI

&gt; Interesting--maybe 'parts' can be a single entry

&gt;&gt; 37. Two Gentlemen of Verona

&gt; Yes, unbecoming.

&gt;&gt; 38. Henry VIII

&gt; Yes, shameful.

&gt;&gt; 39. Cymbeline

&gt; Read it again. Think of it as &quot;Imogen&quot;
&gt; as she is the star (Cym is an idiot with
&gt; stolen kids, a bitchy wife, a freaky stepson

The rendition I saw (and totally enjoyed) made
Octavius the strongest character and Octavia
a major winner. (Charmain gave everyone a
chubby.) A &amp; C are, of course, losers. They gave
away power for love, then didn't use the love
anyway. I learned their lesson (that love makes
you kuh-razy). The Pompey character resembled that
guy &quot;Rupert&quot; on Survivor. The eunuch I think was!
The play was exciting, with the party on the ship and the
snakes and the weird contraption Antony dies in.
All the while Octavius just observes madness--why
interrupt the self-destruction of a klutz? I think
Cleopatra died because her beauty had left her
and that was her power, not the realm.
Antony just ran out of fuel. They might be R&amp;J grown
up, but still young.

1. Hamlet. It's got everything. Besides, it's fun. A bit long to sit
through uncut, of course
2. Macbeth. True to life: a man who knows better, does evil anyway,
and recognizes that he tempted himself. I've never seen the Lady
played correctly.
3. The Tempest.
4. Othello. Depressing but complete. As Shaw said, Verdi didn't write
a Shakespearean opera; Shakespeare wrote an operatic play.
5. Richard II. Again: the tragedy complete within the character, and
the self-dramatizing poetry of it.
6. Much Ado -- the funniest of the comedies.
7. As You Like It -- the sweetest of the comedies.
8. Twelfth Night -- the perfect court comedy.

These are the ones I go back to with the most pleasure and frequency.

9. Midsummer -- I think I like this better as an opera or ballet than
as a play. Having seen it as all three within the past two years. But
the poetry, if spoken well, can always win me over. But that's true
for any of them.
10. King John -- because he's my namesake and I think he deserves a
better deal than most commentators give him. And the Bastard is fun.
11. M4M
12. Richard III -- good clean fun
13. Troilus and Cressida -- precisely because it's so strange.
14. All's Well
15. Cymbeline
16. 2NK -- I may be overinfluenced by a recent good production
17. King Lear -- I may be overinfluenced by a recent mediocre
production.
18. Julius Caesar -- I feel in the mood for a new production.
19. A&amp;C -- Ditto, but I want to direct it myself. And cast it. Bob
Hoskins and Helen Mirren. With Kevin Branagh as Octavian. Or better
yet, Bob Hoskins as Caesar and Ian Mackellen as Antony, the two plays
run together.
20. Merchant of Venice
21. Romeo and Juliet -- the poetry conquers when the characters don't
22. Winter's Tale
23. Pericles
24. 1 Henry IV because it has Hotspur and Glendower as well as
Falstaff
25. 2 Henry IV because it still has Falstaff
26. Henry V for the poetry
27. Taming of the Shrew for the Cole Porter songs.
28. Comedy of Errors for the Rodgers &amp; Hart songs. (And the Flying
Karamazovs.)
29. Henry VI, Part 2
30. Henry VI, Part 3
31. Love's Labor's Lost -- which is nothing but poetry and parody.
32. Merry Wives of Windsor, but I know this works better as several
operas.
33. Timon of Athens
34. Henry VIII -- for the first half and the Old Lady
35. Henry VI, Part 1
36. 2 Gentlemen of Verona
37. Titus Androncicus.

&gt;&gt;&gt;30 Antony &amp; Cleopatra (doesn't work on stage for me. seen it 6 or 7

&gt;&gt;Badly done it can be deadly (the BBC video comes to mind) but I think
you've
&gt;&gt;just been unlucky here -- try if you can to see the video of Trevor
Nunn's
&gt;&gt;1972 RSC production with Janette Suzman, Richard Johnson, Patrick Stewart
&gt;&gt;(Enobarbus) and Corin Redgrave (Octavian) -- it'll change your view of
the

Had to reply here, as Peter's reply doesn't itself show on my newsreader.
I can't base any judgment on seeing a video. Dynamics and structure are so
different.

&gt; The rendition I saw (and totally enjoyed) made

&gt; away power for love, then didn't use the love

&gt; The play was exciting, with the party on the ship and the
&gt; snakes and the weird contraption Antony dies in.
&gt; All the while Octavius just observes madness--why
&gt; interrupt the self-destruction of a klutz? I think
&gt; Cleopatra died because her beauty had left her
&gt; and that was her power, not the realm.
&gt; Antony just ran out of fuel. They might be R&amp;J grown

I think a comparison or rating of the plays is very useful. I've only
read a couple seriously, and 6 or 7 just once, as in high school. Although I
have a just-a- conventional idea of what say the top plays are, that still
leaves about 26 that I haven't read, and reading different opinions would
help to pick a flight route. I'll print out a few from this collection, but
it might be nice if there was a book of different person's rankings in which
each might comment in depth. Another idea might be to get 12 well-read
persons in a jury room until they reach consensus... wonder if that could
happen?

&quot;Tithonus&quot; is one of the greatest short poems ever written, IMHO - a
ravishingly beautiful evocation of the nightmarish realization that you
have outlived your time. Tennyson had an uncommon gift for capturing
melancholy in a language poorly-suited to the task:

Ah, sad and strange as in dark summer dawns
The earliest pipe of half-awaken'd birds
To dying ears, when unto dying eyes
The casement slowly grows a glimmering square...

He shares a great deal in common with his shorter-lived contemporary,
Gerard de Nerval. I'm glad I didn't give up on him after being
repeatedly exposed to &quot;The Charge of the Light Brigade&quot; in elementary
and secondary school -- that was as bad as getting my first impression
of Whitman from &quot;O Captain! My Captain!&quot;

I know some people think otherwise, but there is more to the desire to see a
play than aesthetic excellence. Context plays a large part in a hypothetical
discussion such as this. For instance, if I had a choice of seeing any play
of the canon, I would choose one that I had not seen before. But if the
choice were to see only one play, and that would be the only play I could
see for the rest of my life (kind of like a desert island reading list), I

Right. And I think in Shakespeare's case, his fellows were collaborating with
him BEFORE he began plays--bringing him ideas and material, and possibly
requesting certain roles. But a chess game always has two players necessarily
constructing the artwork the game is. Some plays have just the playwright
doing that, and few have anyone other than the playwright who as importantly
determines the final product as the loser in a chess game.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;This is a silly parlor game, rather like choosing the best World

&gt;&gt;&gt;of

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;chess.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I disagree that it's silly: requiring one to state a preference leads

&gt;&gt;&gt;directly

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;to the most important question in art: what makes for aesthetic

&gt;&gt;&gt;excellence?

&gt;&gt;&gt;Bob, we aren't being asked to state a preference, but to make a list.
&gt;&gt;&gt;Weren't you objecting to Bloom doing just that in his recent poetry
&gt;&gt;&gt;anthology?

&gt;&gt;Actually, the only reason why I refrained from explaining the reasons
&gt;&gt;for my own order was a reluctance to beat anyone over the head absent a
&gt;&gt;direct invitation (I realize this is my thread, but still....;-).

&gt; OK, beat us all over the head. :-)

"/>

Fine.&lt;G&gt;

In a nutshell (I know, I know, Hamlet, Act II, Scene 2;-), the most
fascinating accomplishment in Shakspeare's plays is the knack shown at
maintaining a staggeringly conversational quality through the most
carefully written verse.

At its best, this translates into a capacity for designing a character's
lines in such an acute and vivid way that not only can one almost
convince oneself that a character's &quot;downtime&quot; would naturally find
her/him still speaking verse(!), those very lines manage to intimate --
in addition to the surface message the character wants to convey -- part
of the character's &quot;subtext&quot; as well, where the character is ultimately
&quot;coming from&quot;, what the character might wish to say had he the guts/the
opportunity to, even what the character possibly wishes to conceal!

The connotations, spoken and unspoken, are somehow brought out in an
amazingly allusive way. Watching all this done well on stage can be
downright FUN -- IMO.

The greater number of characters depicted in this astoundingly
&quot;telepathic&quot; way, while still plausible on one level as a
straightforward and credible exchange among two or more characters, the
more satisfying the play -- for me.

I find that the most populous and multi-layered assemblage of
characters, with the highest percentage of vividly drawn parts complete
with implicit &quot;subtexts&quot;, are found in the nitty-gritty dramas
concentrated in the first decade of the 1600s.

The complexity of the poetry certainly continues to develop somewhat
after this, but not every character continues to yield as consistently
multi-layered a &quot;subtext&quot; as is routinely found throughout this peak
decade, IMO. Thus, after this, for instance, we might have one or two
stunningly distinct characters -- like Imogen -- alongside a Dramatis
Personae backdrop that seems _relatively_ sketchy.

In Lear and Macbeth, his peak achievements, IMO, it is hard to find any
character where one cannot immediately &quot;hear a voice&quot; for a role, even
the &quot;voice&quot;'s inflections(!), as somehow inseparable from the written
lines on the page. And to combine this with a way of telling a story
that seems to combine both momentous issues and the routine rhythms of
daily life in all its randomness constitutes pure genius.

The momentous issues are not abandoned later, but &quot;the routine rhythms
of daily life in all its randomness&quot; tend to emerge only fitfully in the
final plays, excellent as some of them are.

At the other end of the spectrum, the earlier one goes into the Bard's
development in the 1590s (generally speaking, that is; and granted, it's
not necessarily an entirely straight line), the less
characterizationally allusive and the less conversational the verse
tends to get.

When the highest stakes are in question and when the all-too-human
stumbling of fallible characters are brought together in the keenest and
most naturally bustling way, that's when Shakspeare soars, IMO.

I suppose this continually realistic bustle of three-dimensional
&quot;subtexts&quot; in profusion against a daunting backdrop of life's ultimate
meanings is the real key to any rationale I have for having elevated
certain plays to the top of my list and having relegated others to the
bottom.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;Absolutely, everyone is invited to tell us in as much detail as s/he
&gt;&gt;likes the reasons for each and every preference -- and lack thereof.
&gt;&gt;This is why I found -- BTW -- the James Doyle posting especially
&gt;&gt;worthwhile. It was just the kind of posting I was looking forward to.

&gt; Oh, I'm in favor of discussing the canon. It's the numerical ranking aspect
&gt; I question.

"/>

I feel that sometimes that can be useless, yes. But sometimes it can
help one concentrate -- even learn more -- on just what it is that draws
one continually back to these plays in the first place.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;So feel free, please, to tell us which aspects -- in your opinion --
&gt;&gt;make for a particularly compelling and satisfying Shak[e]speare play.

&gt; It's hard to take you seriously while you insist on spelling Shakespeare
&gt; that way, Mr. Rig[g]s.

"/>

Well, for me, it's &quot;gonna&quot; be that or Shakspeare, so.....&lt;G&gt;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;If you want to go ahead and explain what you think the Bard may have
&gt;&gt;been driving at in each one, where he was especially successful, where
&gt;&gt;not, etc., that is all very welcome.

&gt;&gt;I look forward to that.

&gt; Does this mean I have to continue my argument with Grumman over Two
&gt; Gentlemen of Verona? As I said, Launce, Crab, and &quot;Who is Sylvia&quot; don't save
&gt; the play. It's a 'learning the trade' sort of play, like Comedy of Errors
&gt; and Loves' Labor's Lost, and the early history plays.

"/>

Actually, I agree. Too often, I can sense that characters in TGV are
made to say certain things purely in order to propel the story along
rather than to reveal an allusive subtext. It comes off as too convenient.

I do feel, though, that character strokes have developed to a somewhat
more imaginative level by the time we get to Love's Labor's Lost, uneven
as the latter is. As to Comedy of Errors, it's roughly at the same
level of character development as TGV really. But presentationally,
there is a genius of sorts in Errors that is intriguing and that makes
it a reasonably interesting and inventive work, IMO.

Cheers,

Geoffrey Riggs

Funny you should mention those two. My two favorite moments in Shakespeare
are Lear's reunion with Cordelia and MacDuff's reaction to the news of the
slaughter of his family. MacDuff's reaction shows Shakespeare as a true
student of human behavior; a lesser dramatist would have MacDuff cry for
revenge right away, but Shakespeare has him dazed at first.

&gt; might be that fails to make these two achieve the same full effect _for
&gt; you_ that they do for most other readers.

"/>

Hmm. It's a combination of things, I think, and none of them very
strong by itself. My first attraction to Shakespeare's plays has
always been characterization and, in a close second, language. Of
course, since his characters are revealed through language, I don't
know if what I'm saying really makes any sense. One of these days
I'll have to figure out what exactly it is that attracts me to
Shakespeare.

Regarding why I rate Macbeth so low: I had to read it in high school
(way back in the day) and write essays on the Tragic Flaw of Ambition,
etc etc. I didn't like it and avoided the play for many years
thereafter, although I had no problem with tragedies like Romeo &amp;
Juliet or Othello (incidentally, I didn't care for Hamlet back then
either). In the past few years, in an attempt to give Macbeth another
chance, I saw two stage productions; unfortunately, they both turned
out to be pretty lousy. I came away confirmed in the idea that
Macbeth was an idiot. I found myself mentally berating the
character: &quot;You grabbed at one thing and lost everything. What a
jerk.&quot; Do people really act like that? Yes. Am I tolerant of the
follies of humanity? Not when I find them in fiction. I've never had
much patience for entertainments featuring self-destructive people.
(I'm for a jig or a tale of bawdry, or I sleep.) Then, a couple of
months ago, my daughter had a high school assignment on Macbeth. She
asked for my help, so she and I went over the play in detail in
preparation for her completing her project. It was then that I
started to get interested in what makes Macbeth and Lady M what they
are. I also had a chance to read Harriet Walter's little book on
playing Lady Macbeth opposite Antony Sher, and the chapter in Carol
Rutter's book *Clamourous Voices* about the production back in the
1980s (?) with Sinead Cusack and Jonathan Pryce. As a result, my
opinion of the play has improved somewhat. If you had asked us to
list our favorites a few months ago, Macbeth would have been even
lower on my list.

Same with King Lear. For many years I thought of him as a foolish old
man with a couple of awful daughters. Who wants to watch people
behaving badly for two to three hours? Ugh. The difference with my
reaction to Macbeth was that I held this opinion about Lear even
though I'd never read the play. I knew the plot; I read commentary
about the play, and reviews of productions, but not the play itself,
beyond quoted passages. Possibly I avoided it in part because
everyone was always raving about it being Shakespeare's &quot;best&quot;
tragedy. (Once upon a time I avoided reading *Jonathan Livingston
Seagull* just because everyone around me was saying how great it was.)
What brought King Lear up in my estimation was seeing the televised
production with Ian Holm back in 1997. I think I said in my last post
that my least favorite plays were the histories and the Roman plays,
but when I saw productions of some of them, they were better than I
thought they'd be. Same with King Lear. I found myself sympathizing
with Cordelia and Edgar, and eventually with Lear.

It's not a very good reason for rating a play lowly, but I guess I
just need a character to sympathize with. As I said, it's hard for me
to sympathize with fictional characters who ruin their own lives and
the lives of those around them. It's just my own weirdness.
(F'rinstance, I like the character of Melanie Wilkes better than I do
Scarlett O'Hara.)

Perhaps in a few years more, as I continue to mature and learn, both
of these plays will have moved up into the top 15. But I can't
imagine them ever displacing any of the plays in my top 10.

IMO, the Pericles/Marina reunion is almost as wrenching. A shame the
rest of the play is in such a shambles of a text. I feel fairly sure
the only reason the First Folio did not include this was because the
original text may simply have been lost (the 1613 fire?). Especially
regrettable since it appears to have been one of Shakspeare's most

&gt;&gt;&gt;Oh, I'm in favor of discussing the canon. It's the numerical ranking

&gt;&gt;&gt;I question.

&gt;&gt;I feel that sometimes that can be useless, yes. But sometimes it can
&gt;&gt;help one concentrate -- even learn more -- on just what it is that draws
&gt;&gt;one continually back to these plays in the first place.

&gt; I am coming to agree with you, and Grumman (did I really write that :-)).
&gt; Your thread has been the most interesting on HLAS in a while. Thanks.

Well, thanks for saying that. Personally, I miss some of the threads
that concentrated on either the POTM themes or some of the
textual/editorial problems of the &quot;Knotty Six&quot;;-) (i.e., HIV2, RIII,
T&amp;C, Hamlet, Lear, Othello).

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;So feel free, please, to tell us which aspects -- in your opinion --
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;make for a particularly compelling and satisfying Shak[e]speare play.

&gt;&gt;&gt;It's hard to take you seriously while you insist on spelling Shakespeare
&gt;&gt;&gt;that way, Mr. Rig[g]s.

&gt;&gt;Well, for me, it's &quot;gonna&quot; be that or Shakspeare, so.....&lt;G&gt;

&gt; Which of the various antiShakespearean covens do you belong to? We have
&gt; several Oxfordian nutcases, a Baconian bot named Weir, and a couple of
&gt; thin-skinned Marlovians. There are some &quot;anyone but Shakespeare&quot;
&gt; fence-sitters as well.

"/>

I am a complete fan of Schoenbaum's biography, frankly. I am quite
convinced now that Shakspeare's life was as straightforward a chronicle
as the documents appear to indicate. Moreover, I do not find the
documentation all that sparse as that era goes. True, Jonson and a few
others may have somewhat more documentation, but there are also writers
from that period who have somewhat less. A wash. Shakspeare was
Shakspeare, IMHO.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;If you want to go ahead and explain what you think the Bard may have
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;been driving at in each one, where he was especially successful, where
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;not, etc., that is all very welcome.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I look forward to that.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Does this mean I have to continue my argument with Grumman over Two
&gt;&gt;&gt;Gentlemen of Verona? As I said, Launce, Crab, and &quot;Who is Sylvia&quot; don't

&gt; save

&gt;&gt;&gt;the play. It's a 'learning the trade' sort of play, like Comedy of

&gt; Errors

&gt;&gt;&gt;and Loves' Labor's Lost, and the early history plays.

&gt;&gt;Actually, I agree. Too often, I can sense that characters in TGV are
&gt;&gt;made to say certain things purely in order to propel the story along
&gt;&gt;rather than to reveal an allusive subtext. It comes off as too

&gt; convenient.

&gt; And the ending? Yuck.

Thoughtfully put;-)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;I do feel, though, that character strokes have developed to a somewhat

It may be beside the point, but the very fact therefore that he tried
his hand at this kind of purely farcical genre indicates which direction

It is a study of just how Shakespeare pulls off the
realism-in-verse-dialog trick by the use of redundant scattershot simile
and metaphor (e.g., &quot;See what a grace was seated on this brow&quot;, or
Macbeth's catalog of metaphors on sleep), of how other Elizabethan and
Stuart playwrights use the same device, with greater or lesser success,
and how it eventually declines to a mere stylistic tic in the hands of
poets who imitate it without understanding, achieving only logorrhea in

I'm not sure that we disagree here. My point was that it was early work that
Shakespeare learned from. That doesn't mean it was bad at all, aside from

No......it's only bad because the final scenes show not one scintilla of
the inspiration displayed in its first half;-) IM incorrigible O, the
best such example instead might be Wagner's Die Feen: here we have a
(yes) apprentice composer maintaining at the same time a sincerity of

Looking at the &quot;See what a grace&quot; passage brings something else to mind.
The sense of bustle is maintained by making this entire passage not
merely a description but an invitation to _action_ from one person to
another: _SEE_ what a grace was seated&quot; etc. This is something
Shakspeare does again and again. Even when one character is speaking at
considerable length, there will be innumerable clues reminding one that
a transformation, a movement from point A to point B, is transpiring for
more than one person at a time. That too enhances both the sense of
bustle and the conversational quality, IMO.

Thanks for responding. I'm going to check this one out.

Tennyson wrote two of my all-time favorite poems, Ulysses and Audley Court,

&gt;&gt;&gt;This is a silly parlor game, rather like choosing the best World Champion
&gt;of
&gt;&gt;&gt;chess.

&gt;&gt; I disagree that it's silly: requiring one to state a preference leads
&gt;directly
&gt;&gt; to the most important question in art: what makes for aesthetic
&gt;excellence?

&gt;I know some people think otherwise, but there is more to the desire to see a
&gt;play than aesthetic excellence. Context plays a large part in a hypothetical
&gt;discussion such as this. For instance, if I had a choice of seeing any play
&gt;of the canon, I would choose one that I had not seen before. But if the
&gt;choice were to see only one play, and that would be the only play I could
&gt;see for the rest of my life (kind of like a desert island reading list), I
&gt;would choose Hamlet.

&gt;TR

"/>

Right. I meant stating a general life preference as with a list like this.

For the desert island, I might not take any of my favorite plays because I'm so
familiar with them, but choose one I vaguely remembered as interesting but had
read or seen more than onece like Cymbeline--or even Pericles, which I still
haven't read or seen. There could be all kinds of complications--for instance,
I might take A Midsummer Night's Dream because I've always wanted to write my
own version of it (as Woody Allen once did--his version only mildly parallelled
Shakespeare's but was a fun film, as I remember). My version, ironically, would
be more scatological than Shakespeare's--but that would not be the main
difference.

I would have a hard time putting them in any kind of numerical order.
To me the value of the plays in the long run lies in their poetry, and they
all, even the plays that don't seem to work well as plays, have great
poetry in them. Some of my favorites, like 12th Night, RIII and H5
became so only after I saw a good performance of them, others like
Troilus and Cressida and the H6 plays and the late plays I liked after
only reading them. I would guess that if I were to see a great performance
of all of them that I would like them all about the same. If you include
the poems, the only work by him that I really don't like much at all is
Lucrece.

I've come in on this very late, and only because it's raining where I
am, :( but my favourites are Winter's Tale, Measure for Measure, and
also Merchant of Venice (This one probably only because I've done a
lot of work on Shylock). I may have seen Hamlet and Lear and a few
others too often to judge them objectively.

I will say, however, that Pericles was my least favourite play till I
saw it in Stratford, Ontario, last year. It was magnificent. The best
production of any Shakespeare (?) play I've ever seen.

&gt; Hey, leave me outta this! I'm not a pre-1950 poet. (While I'm again arguing

&gt; little more than stilted rhetoric and miscopied history books).

No question that Timon is a flawed play. But its finest sequences,
particularly the extended forest scene in Act IV, shows, IMHO, far more
genius in its verse, and in the implied emotions its verse carries, than
anything in TGV. No question that TGV has a tighter structure as an
evening's entertainment, but Timon might have equalled or surpassed
that, I would guess, had it ever been finished of course.

Each of us is entitled to our opinion, granted. For me, since the depth
of characterization and vivid feeling through verse weighs heaviest in
assessing a Shakspeare play, I gravitate more to an unfinished work with
flashes of mature insight like Timon than to slicker but less profound
writing such as is found in TGV. It makes perfectly good sense, OTOH,
that a reader for whom relative theatrical and presentational tightness
weighs heavier would find TGV preferable. There's clearly nothing
intrinsically wrong with that.

Respectfully,

I suppose I've always taken it as pretty much a given that

A) the more accurate pronunciation is CorTEZ, but that

B) Keats' own pronunciation was evidently CORtez, since, candidly, I
always find the iamb argument a clincher.

I've always solved this by pronouncing it CorTEZ when merely referring
to the historical figure but pronouncing it CORtez when quoting the poem.

I still feel that -- since &quot;BalBOa&quot;'s three syllables would have to
replace &quot;stout CORtez&quot; -- the loss of &quot;stout&quot; would seriously affect the
tone of the whole poem. So I'm happy to give Keats his historical
innaccuracy here for the sake of not affecting the highly individual
character of the lines.

I looked it up in the encyclopedia and the stress is indeed on the
second syllable. It also said his name was spelled Cortés, which
makes more sense to me than &quot;Cortez&quot; stressed on the last syllable.
In my pronunciation, I was going by what I'd heard while living in
Central America: names ending in 'ez' have the stress on the
second-to-last syllable, e.g. rodRIguez, jiMEnez, PErez, etc. But if
it was spelled Cortés (which means courteous), that would explain the
apparent discrepancy.

Now I have to go against a decades-old habit when I read the poem in
future! But like Geoffrey I wonder if Keats didn't pronounce it
CORtez, too.

What &quot;iamb argument&quot;? Every line varies considerably from the iambic

a formal, &quot;iambic pentameter-like&quot; structure, but the variation

&gt; ..
&gt; How about the Eagle? &quot;He clasps the crag with crooked hands&quot; etc.

&gt; When my brother was seven, the class was given an exercise, to write a
&gt; poem. He got this wrong, thinking it was just writing practice, but
&gt; what you wrote had to be a poem, and so he wrote down Tennyson's Eagle
&gt; which he had learned with his mother the previous evening. It was
&gt; marked second in the class.

&gt; Apart from not recognizing it, the teacher with over 40 of these to
&gt; mark did not do badly.

"/>

Seems more like doggerel to me:

==================================
He clasps the crag with crooked hands;
Close to the sun in lonely lands,
Ring'd with the azure world, he stands.

The wrinkled sea beneath him crawls;
He watches from his mountain walls,
And like a thunderbolt he falls.
==================================

The image of the eagle falling like a thunderbolt is
good in itself, but there is far too much
alliteration and rhyme. The variation and free-form
lyricism of &quot;Audley Court&quot; are not like &quot;The Eagle&quot;
at all, IMO:

======================================
&quot;Audley Court&quot;

&quot;The Bull, the Fleece are crammed, and not a room
For love or money. Let us picnic there
At Audely Court.&quot;

I spoke, while Audley feast
Hummed like a hive all round the narrow quay,
To Francis, with a basket on his arm,
To Francis just alighted from the boat,
And breathing of the sea. &quot;With all my heart,&quot;
Said Francis. Then we shouldered through the swarm,
And rounded by the stillness of the beach
To where the bay runs up its latest horn.

We left the dying ebb that faintly lipped
The flat red granite; so by many a sweep
Of meadow smooth from aftermath we reached
The griffin-guarded gates, and passed through all
The pillared dusk of sounding sycamores,
And crossed the garden to the gardener's lodge,
With all its casements bedded, and its walls
And chimneys muffled in the leafy vine.

There, on a slope of orchard, Francis laid
A damask napkin wrought with horse and hound,
Brought out a dusky loaf that smelt of home,
And, half-cut-down, a pasty costly-made,
Where quail and pigeon, lark and leveret lay,
Like fossils of the rock, with golden yolks
Imbedded and injellied; last, with these,
A flask of cider from his father's vats,
Prime, which I knew; and so we sat and ate
And talked old matters over; who was dead,
Who married, who was like to be, and how
The races went, and who would rent the hall:
Then touched upon the game, how scarce it was
This season; glancing thence, discussed the farm,
The four-field system, and the price of grain;
And struck upon the corn-laws, where we split,
And came again together on the king
With heated faces; till he laughed aloud;
And, while the blackbird on the pippin hung
To hear him, clapt his hand in mine and sang -

&quot;Oh! who would fight and march and countermarch,
Be shot for sixpence in a battle-field,
And shovelled up into some bloddy trench
Where no one knows? but let me live my life.

&quot;Oh! who would cast and balance at a desk,
Perched like a crow upon a three-legged stool,
Till all his juice is dried, and all his joints
Are full of chalk? but let me live my life.

&quot;Who'd serve the state? for if I carved my name
Upon the cliffs that guard my native land,
I might as well have traced it in the sands;
The sea wastes all: but let me live my life.

&quot;Oh! who would love? I wooed a woman once,
But she was sharper than an eastern wind,
And all my heart turned from her, as a thorn
Turns from the sea; but let me live my life.&quot;

He sang his song, and I replied with mine:
I found it in a volume, all of songs,
Knocked down to me, when old Sir Robert's pride,
His books -the more the pity, so I said -
Came to the hammer here in March -and this -
I set the words, and added names I knew.

&quot;Sleep, Ellen Aubrey, sleep, and dream of me:
Sleep, Ellen, folded in thy sister's arm,
And sleeping, haply dream her arm is mine.

&quot;Sleep, Ellen, folded in Emilia's arm;
Emilia, fairer than all else but thou,
For thou art fairer than all else that is.

&quot;Sleep, breathing health and peace upon her breast:
Sleep, breathing love and trust against her lip:
I go tonight: I come tomorrow morn.

&quot;I go, but I return: I would I were
The pilot of the darkness and the dream.
Sleep, Ellen Aubrey, love, and dream of me.&quot;

So sang we each to either, Francis Hale,
The farmer's son, who lived across the bay,
My friend; and I , that having wherewithal,
And in the fallow leisure of my life
A rolling stone of here and everywhere,
Did what I would; but ere the night we rose
And sauntered home beneath a moon, that, just
In crescent, dimly rained about the leaf
Twilights of airy silver, till we reached
The limit of the hills; and as we sank
From rock to rock upon the glooming quay,
The town was hushed beneath us: lower down
The bay was oily calm; the harbour-buoy,
Sole star of phosphorescence in the calm,
With one green sparkle ever and anon
Dipped by itself, and we were glad at heart.

You must have terrible difficulties dealing with &quot;Don Juan&quot;.

I do not believe that Keats intended a hiatus following &quot;Cortez&quot;; it
puts Cortez into far too great a prominence in a poem that is, after
all, on a different subject. It is far more likely that Keats
pronounced the name as a trochee.

With respect, the only &quot;irregularities&quot; in the metre are the occasional

balanced against quite a regular pulse throughout the entire poem.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I suppose I've always taken it as pretty much a given that

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;A) the more accurate pronunciation is CorTEZ, but that

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;B) Keats' own pronunciation was evidently CORtez, since, candidly, I
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;always find the iamb argument a clincher.

&gt;&gt;&gt; What &quot;iamb argument&quot;? Every line varies considerably from the iambic
&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;norm&quot; in the first part of the line, and every line except the last
&gt;&gt;&gt; finishes with two iambs. Ending each line that way gives the poem
&gt;&gt;&gt; a formal, &quot;iambic pentameter-like&quot; structure, but the variation
&gt;&gt;&gt; at beginning of each line gives it the variation it needs to be
&gt;&gt;&gt; interesting. I can hardly see how the pronunciation

&gt;&gt;&gt; Or like STOUT CORtez

&gt;&gt;&gt; can work, because for the one thing, the poet is writing in English,
&gt;&gt;&gt; and we prounounce the word CorTEZ. Competent poets don't expect
&gt;&gt;&gt; their readers to use an odd pronunciation out of the blue.

&gt;&gt; We just think it's odd because we're probably more aware of correct
&gt;&gt; pronunciation today than many of Keats's countrymen may have been. Even
&gt;&gt; today, it's likely that there may still be certain regions of the
&gt;&gt; Commonwealth where the pronunciation CORtez rather than CorTEZ prevails.

&gt;&gt;&gt; In addition,
&gt;&gt;&gt; the first two syllables of the line are unstressed, and a reader
&gt;&gt;&gt; will normally expect some kind of &quot;iambic&quot; or &quot;iambic-like&quot; cadence
&gt;&gt;&gt; to resolve the tension, which &quot;like STOUT CorTEZ&quot; provides.

&gt;&gt; I see the word &quot;like&quot; here as easily stressed making the introduction of
&gt;&gt; Cortez that much more rhetorically effective, IMO. I may be unduly
&gt;&gt; influenced by the Ralph Richardson LP, but it becomes highly effective
&gt;&gt; when he reads it &quot;Or LIKE STOUT CORtez WHEN with EAGle EYES&quot;. The line,
&gt;&gt; in the context of the rest of the poem, attains a swing this way that it
&gt;&gt; lacks if neither &quot;like&quot; nor &quot;Cor...&quot; are stressed.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I've always solved this by pronouncing it CorTEZ when merely referring
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;to the historical figure but pronouncing it CORtez when quoting the
poem.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Why? Then you have two stressed syllables in row, which is not
&quot;iambic&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt; either, and sounds bad to boot.

&gt;&gt; But your suggestion doesn't avoid two stressed syllables in a row:
&gt;&gt;&quot;...tez&quot; and &quot;when&quot;. &quot;OR like STOUT CorTEZ WHEN with EAGle EYES.&quot;
&gt;&gt; Personally, I find two stressed syllables in a row at the middle of the
&gt;&gt; line more awkward than a series of stressed syllables at the opening.

&gt; I don't see two stressed syllables in a row here, I see two pairs
&gt; of unstressed syllables:

&gt; Or like STOUT CorTEZ when with EAgle EYES.

That may be incorrect (although I don't think so), but it sure sounds better

That argument is veering perilously close to sheer idiocy, especially

This whole business concerning &quot;tin ears&quot; is pretty funny. From my point
of view, if you pronounce the words naturally, you will scan the poem
correctly, with minor variations between individuals. Most of those
differences come from people who insist on rigidly following some
iambic &quot;norm&quot; which doesn't exist, so they, for example, insist on
seeing a full stress on two adjacent syllables that are both unstressed,
though one may be slightly more stressed than the other.

A &quot;tin ear&quot;, to me, doesn't relate to scansion. To me, it means the
inability to recognize the trite phrase from the fresh one, as in
this excerpt from a modern poem:

=====================================
Because life's too short to blush,
I keep my blood tucked in.
I won't be mortified
by what I drive or the flaccid
vivacity of my last dinner party.
I take my cue from statues posing only

===============================================

&quot;life's too short&quot;, &quot;I take my cue&quot; are ready-made
phrases that don't belong in poetry. Even &quot;you

A couple of weeks ago I read an essay by Charles Willeford on what he called
&quot;found&quot; poetry, poems that are written using rearranged excerpts from
existing sources, such as newspapers and advertisements. I don't know if he
would have considered Alice Fulton to be that type of poet, but he did think
Eliot and Pound were.

It's pretty interesting. It's in a collection of his essays titled *Writing

Fine. That's entirely up to you, Tom. The question you might

Have I ever said that? I don't think so. What I do say,
however, is that those people who 'understand' what the
poet had in mind in this area will probably enjoy the
poetry more than those who don't. And those who simply

even more.

Ay, there's the rub, Jim. How the words should be pronounced
&quot;naturally&quot; to you is not what would have sounded natural to
Keats. You live in a society in which the Spanish language
has played a major part. We do not. And most Englishmen who
have not had the benefit of learning Spanish would *not*
emphasize the second syllable in the way that you do. They
would emphasize the first syllable at least as much (if not
more) than the second. I am reasonably familiar with both
French and German, but not Spanish, and I assure you that
this is certainly the case with me.

It was one of the last plays of Shakespeare I read--a couple of years ago. (I
think the only one I haven't read is Henry VIII. I don't consider Pericles a
Shakespeare play but hope to read it before long.) I had nothing against Timon
when I started it, except that it wasn't a comedy, and I'm biased in favor of
comedies. But it had no plot to speak of, and the main character was a jerk and
one-dimensional. If it had any decent poetry, I can't remember it. A few
passages of standard misanthropy with some eloquence. It was structurally
inept, so much so that I was convinced by my reading of it, not by the critics
who have argued it, that it was an unfinished play.

But I think yours and my taste are diametrically opposed. The only plays I
think close to as bad as Timon are the Henry VI ones. I like Troilus and
Cressida, though . . . .

I don't see why the heroic figure thing should have anything to do with it.
Keats compares his thrill as a discoverer of Chapman's Homer to the thrill of
the discoverer of the Pacific, and it was Balboa, heroic or no, who experienced
that thrill. I don't think the jangled up line resultant of his stuffing the
wrong discoverer into the wrong place in the wrong way contributes to its being
tonally better, as you put it. More like his heroic figure has prat-fallen and
can't get up. But on Balboa we essentially agree, for as you say:

***Hm. I think the difference is perhaps one of expectations. I'd
guess that you approached Timon with Shakespearean expectations--that
is, that it would rise to a certain level in poetry, plot, and
characterization--whereas I limped in from the other direction--no
expectations--and appreciated how far above &quot;zero&quot; it scored (same
with the Henry VI bunch). Characters strike people differently.
&quot;Jerk&quot; wouldn't occur to me as a description of Timon (though it
certainly would for a number of the other characters in the play). He
supposes himself, correctly, to be acting in accord with decent and
established principles, finds that he is being abused and that others
don't follow the principles when they are not themselves the material
beneficiaries of them, and--abandoned by &quot;friends&quot; and let down, as he
sees it, by his principles--he bitterly departs society, letting those
who drove him to this know what he thinks of them. Is that a jerk? A
disappointed Pollyanna, perhaps, but not a jerk, I think. In
Timon/Alcibiades, I see something of a parallel to Hamlet/Fortinbras,
a contrast between abstraction and pragmatism; and compare the last
line of *Hamlet* with that of *Timon*. Timon one-dimensional? Well,
perhaps, to some degree; but if he weren't, we wouldn't have a story.
Read it as a very dark comedy.

Just a quick comment that Cortez was much more stout than Balboa, and conquered
a nation with a handful of men, a heroic act, in spite of the silly
anti-imperialism of the descendants of conquerers, so the mere name, Cortez&lt;
adds stature to the poem. An editor is within his rights to improve word-choice
as well as correct mistakes, but one could retain &quot;eagle-eyes&quot; and the rest of
the original and trade &quot;Balboa&quot; for &quot;stout Cortez&quot; in my version. In yours
Balboa is stout, which he wasn't, and Cortez was, however unfair to a victim
group he was.

One doesn't have to be anti-imperialist to notice that for all his courage,
Hernán Cortés was a butcher and a thief. He was also exceptionally lucky;
but for his exploitation of the myth of Quetzalcoatl, and the assistance he
received from La Malinche, he would have ended up about where Balboa did,
on the headsman's block. The destruction of the Aztec Empire was a
historically important act, but it was about as heroic as the destruction
of the Byzantine Empire by the Turks.

Not that Cortés' heroism, or lack of same, is relevant. Keats honored him
not as a hero but as a discoverer. Keats wasn't the sort of person who
reveres warriors and conquerers.

They only aggravate me when they're deployed by someone who's trying, and

his real talents by trying to make his poetry sound and look as though it
had been composed by the bastard son of Sir Philip Sidney and John Milton.
His Jacobethan style is nearly as irritating as Kipling's dropped aitches.

Try &quot;stout Hitler&quot; in place of &quot;stout Cortez.&quot; I agree that poems are mainly
word-objects but it's very difficult to put aside historical knowledge when
reading one. In fact, it's exactly like putting aside one's knowledge of the

I meant to reply to this but forgot. Part of the tone of this poem is
excitement over discovering something very important through some kind of
(physically or intellectually) heroic action. Because Cortez was a great,
heroic conquerer and Balboa was not, he contributes more to this tone than
Balboa, and he contributes more than a little, because Keats is saying he felt
like not any man discovering the Pacific but like a great conquerer discovering
the Pacific.

Yes, I'm aware that in very old texts you sometimes need to pronounce
some words *sometimes* in a way which is not normally done today.
For example, &quot;revenue&quot; pronounced &quot;REVenue&quot; can be scanned as having a
strong, weak, not as strong syllabic pattern, and it's hard in
some cases not to scan it that way:

Cymbeline
Act 2, Scene 3

IMOGEN I am spirited with a fool.
Frighted, and anger'd worse: go bid my woman
Search for a jewel that too casually
Hath left mine arm: it was thy master's: 'shrew me,
If I would lose it for a revenue
Of any king's in Europe. I do think
I saw't this morning: confident I am
Last night 'twas on mine arm; I kiss'd it:
I hope it be not gone to tell my lord
That I kiss aught but he.

Otherwise that line ends in a weak syllable, and it's not feminine,
and that's where the pedantic effort to make every verse line
of blank verse a perfectly iambic line leads you. It's impossible,
and it's not the way verse works anyway.

[from Geof. Riggs; not Eliz. H., my better half]

A sign of the marvelous diversity of human nature [and I trust readers
will excuse my duplicating this post as I have a separate &quot;send-out&quot; below]:

Looking through the Order of Preference thread, certain favorites emerge
but also certain highly individual likes and dislikes along with them.

A simple tabulation can't truly cover the variety of perspectives, but
this may still be useful for gaining some perspective on the different
voices heard from -- perhaps even on the status of certain plays in the
canon itself.

In the following tabulation, I add in square brackets what the average
rating of each work comes to. In the case of a tie, I look at the
highest slot which each play has received. Thus, the highest rating
anyone gives Richard III is #1, while the highest given to Much Ado is
#6. Richard III is therefore listed before Much Ado.

? It's not &quot;quite impossible&quot; or even impossible. It's simply
an irregular iambic pentameter line. It ends with two iambs,
which is all that's needed to resolve the tension created at the
beginning of the line. In this poem, Keats splits his lines
in half, with the second half providing the iambic base. Milton,
for example, creates tension and release usually by following an
irregular line with a completely regular one (so that every other
line is &quot;perfectly&quot; iambic).

Hopkins' &quot;sprung rhythm&quot; is just his buzz phrase for &quot;I'm going
to write whatever I want whenever I want&quot;.

I have no idea what you are talking about here. It seems to me
that the strongest stresses are on &quot;EAgle EYE&quot;. And if you pronounce

weirdness and three weak(er) syllables in a row.

I don't see Shakespeare or Milton doing things (with regard to

in how they released the tension they created when they used irregular feet.

It's nothing of the sort, either in Hopkins or in others. Consider
Charles Williams' line:

In Logres the King's Friend landed, Lancelot of Gaul.

Conventionally (in what Hopkins called &quot;running rhythm&quot;), that line
can't be scanned at all. But as sprung rhythm it's an alexandrine that
hits like six hammer blows (it is the last line of an otherwise
sprung-pentameter poem).

I don't see where you're coming from in the first place. It is simply

Once again you're invoking the rules of Spanish pronunciation, when
there is no reason to believe that Englishmen two hundred years ago
observed them, and strong anecdotal evidence that they did not. And an
acute accent does not in itself imply stress. It does no such thing in
French, a language far better known in England than Spanish; and I'm not
at all sure that today's dictionary convention of using the prime mark
for stress even existed in Keat's time. (The first pronouncing
dictionary was Thomas Sheridan's of 1780; I have no idea of what, if
anything, he used to indicate stress, and I have no idea of whether
Keats ever saw it, or any other pronouncing dictionary, at all. &quot;The&quot;
dictionary, in his day, was Johnson's, which carried no pronunciations.)

Unless you can show me that Englishmen definitely did not pronounce it
that way, I'm afraid it's all a lot of smoke. And the scansion of
the line not only doesn't require CORtez, it sounds bad that way, and
you end up with 3 unstressed syllables in a row beginning with the &quot;-ez&quot;,
and if you say &quot;CORtez&quot; rather than &quot;CorTEZ&quot;, the first 3 syllables
of the line including the &quot;stout&quot; can sound relatively unstressed, so
you end up with something even worse than what you are trying so hard
to avoid in the first place:

&quot;or like stout CORtez when with EAGle EYES&quot;

But there must be an infinite number of lines in the world of
poetry like

&quot;or like STOUT CorTEZ, when with EAGLE EYES&quot;.

with a natural caesura after &quot;-TEZ&quot;.

&gt;&gt; Once again you're invoking the rules of Spanish pronunciation, when
&gt;&gt; there is no reason to believe that Englishmen two hundred years ago
&gt;&gt; observed them, and strong anecdotal evidence that they did not. And an
&gt;&gt; acute accent does not in itself imply stress.

&gt; It does in Spanish, and that's all that it does.

&gt;&gt;It does no such thing in
&gt;&gt; French, a language far better known in England than Spanish;

&gt; I'm quite sure that Keats (and other Englishmen) knew that
&gt; Cortez was not a Frenchman.

&gt;&gt;and I'm not
&gt;&gt; at all sure that today's dictionary convention of using the prime mark
&gt;&gt; for stress even existed in Keat's time. (The first pronouncing
&gt;&gt; dictionary was Thomas Sheridan's of 1780; I have no idea of what, if
&gt;&gt; anything, he used to indicate stress, and I have no idea of whether
&gt;&gt; Keats ever saw it, or any other pronouncing dictionary, at all. &quot;The&quot;
&gt;&gt; dictionary, in his day, was Johnson's, which carried no pronunciations.)

&gt; Unless you can show me that Englishmen definitely did not pronounce it
&gt; that way, I'm afraid it's all a lot of smoke. And the scansion of
&gt; the line not only doesn't require CORtez, it sounds bad that way, and
&gt; you end up with 3 unstressed syllables in a row beginning with the &quot;-ez&quot;,
&gt; and if you say &quot;CORtez&quot; rather than &quot;CorTEZ&quot;, the first 3 syllables
&gt; of the line including the &quot;stout&quot; can sound relatively unstressed, so
&gt; you end up with something even worse than what you are trying so hard
&gt; to avoid in the first place:

&gt;&quot;or like stout CORtez when with EAGle EYES&quot;

&gt; But there must be an infinite number of lines in the world of
&gt; poetry like

&gt;&quot;or like STOUT CorTEZ, when with EAGLE EYES&quot;.

&gt; with a natural caesura after &quot;-TEZ&quot;.

&gt; Whatever you do, don't take on Spenser's Epithalamion!

I think Bulldog Jim is angling for the Crowley Award here, for Conspicuous
Pigheadedness, Wilful Ignorance and Metrical Incompetence.
