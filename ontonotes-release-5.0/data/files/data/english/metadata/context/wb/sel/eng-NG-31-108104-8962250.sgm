&gt; I feed the ferals, and sometimes they get impatient with me.

&gt; This afternoon, for instance, when I returned from the groceru store.
&gt; Four ats were waiting on me - Acqui, who is mean, Fluffy who is still
&gt; mostly nervous of people, Blacky and Spot, who are sweet and lovable.

&gt; I tell the cats &quot;Go around to the other door. I just put food out over
&gt; there. I'm NOT putting the food out over here.&quot; Of course, they ignore
&gt; me. Acqui even swatted my (thankfully leather-clad) foot twice, with
&gt; claws out.

&gt; I finishe unloading the groceries, and tell the cats again, to go to
&gt; the other door. I then go inside and close the door. Fifteen minutes
&gt; later, all four cats are still at the wrong door. Siiigh.

&gt; Okay, I am a good slave. I pick up Spot, carry him through the house,
&gt; open the door and show him the food. He gets the idea, and starts
&gt; chowing down. I go back, grab Blacky, carry him through the house,
&gt; open the door and show him the food. He alsl gets the idea, and starts
&gt; eating.

&gt; I go back, ask Fluffy if I can pick him up, and he says no.

&gt; Acqui, on the other hand, is rubbing against my leg and rolling on his
&gt; back to have his tummy petted.

&gt; I look Acqui in the eye, tell him I am not stupid, and have absolutely
&gt; no plans to rub his tummy, but that if he wants food, it's around at
&gt; the other door (big grin).

&gt; Half an hour later, Acqui and Fluffy have figured things out, and are
&gt; eating while Spot and Blacky clean their pretty faces...

&gt; Hugs and Purrs,
&gt; Mark

Acqui is so cheeky!  I'm glad that even the ferals know how to
enslave.

Of course you're not stupid Mark.  But.....you ARE a total cat slave.

I know, I know.....just like the rest of us.
