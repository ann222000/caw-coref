McCain's Finest Hour
Leadership sometimes means bucking public opinion.

Wednesday, April 11, 2007 12:01 a.m. EDT

These columns have had more than one disagreement with John McCain over the
years, especially on issues that typically win the Arizona Republican
accolades from the rest of the media: campaign-finance reform, global
warming, detainee interrogations and tax cuts. Yet now that he is under
attack from his erstwhile media "base" for refusing to repudiate the war in
Iraq, we think he deserves some covering fire. The word for what he's
demonstrating is character.

Presidential campaigns often have their defining media moments, for better
or worse: Think of Teddy Kennedy's fumbling replies to Roger Mudd's
Chappaquiddick questions in 1979, or George H. W. Bush shaking off the
so-called wimp factor in his 1988 interview with Dan Rather. It's too soon
to say if Mr. McCain's interview Sunday with Scott Pelley of CBS's "60
Minutes" will be equally defining. But it certainly illuminated the chasm
that distinguishes Mr. McCain from the Beltway media that used to adore him.

The most revealing exchange came when Mr. Pelley, in all apparent
seriousness, asked the Senator "at what point do you stop doing what you
think is right and you start doing what the majority of the American people
want?"

Answered Mr. McCain: "I disagree with what the majority of the American
people want. I still believe the majority of the American people, when
asked, say if you can show them a path to success . . . then they'll support
it." Later Mr. Pelley observed that Mr. McCain was betting his entire
campaign on the success of the current "surge" strategy in Baghdad. The
Senator replied that he'd "rather lose a campaign than lose a war."

It's hard not to respect that. Hard, too, not to notice that statements like
those exist at a vast and principled remove from the recent Solonic
utterances of other Senators who supported the war when it was popular. Such
as "let's cut and run, or cut and walk" (Oregon Republican Gordon Smith,
running for re-election next year), and "if we knew then what we know now,
there wouldn't have been a vote and I certainly wouldn't have voted that
way" (Hillary Rodham Clinton, trying to appease the antiwar left as she
seeks the Democratic Presidential nomination).

The difference is not merely of consistency but of conviction. Mr. McCain is
making clear he understands that leadership is often by nature unpopular. He
has been equally clear about the consequences of U.S. withdrawal from
Iraq--"chaos" and "genocide" were among the scenarios he painted for Mr.
Pelley.

He has also shown that he understands the moral obligation his vote
authorizing the war entailed, which was to see it through to victory, or at
least until the conclusion becomes inescapable that victory is impossible.
With General David Petraeus only recently installed in Baghdad and his surge
strategy not yet fully under way, Mr. McCain realizes that we are nowhere
near being able to draw that conclusion.

Not surprisingly, all this has the media in a state of apoplexy, with his
former liberal pals shaking their heads in phony regret that his supposed
blunder in Baghdad--observing last week that a market is safer than it was
only a few months ago--is going to sink his candidacy. Our view is that Mr.
McCain's difficulty so far in attracting conservative voters has nothing to
do with Iraq, and everything to do with the positions that once made him the
media darling. On the contrary, his support for the war and his appreciation
of the stakes is one thing that keeps his candidacy alive, at least within
the Republican Party.

Later today, Mr. McCain will deliver a speech at the Virginia Military
Institute about how the war in Iraq can be won. Along with many Americans,
we will listen with interest and respect, not because we always agree with
Mr. McCain, but because he has demonstrated that his views on the subject
are serious and born of belief, not of polls. That's more than can be said
for most of our political and chattering classes, and a reason to admire a
politician whose newfound unpopularity coincides with his finest political
hour.
