My girlfriend is planning on moving in soon and she has a 3 year old
Papillion (butterfly dog) that needs some company while we're at work
during the day.   She's also bringing a cat.

We have 1/2 an acre for them to play, but I would like a smaller breed
if possible.   What would be a good small companion breed for the
papillion?

My brother has a Papillon, and recently purchased a mini  Dachshund.  They
get a long fine.  I think you would have to have another small dog like the
Papillon if you want them to play together.  When the Papillon visits me, it
has no fear of my Rottweiler, but tends to stay clear of it, because it
fears getting stepped on. So lots of times it just sits under a chair when
at my place.

My mini poodle and GSD are best friends and play together more than the
mini plays with our other small dog or the GSD plays with the other big
dog.  It just depends on the dog.  Good time to plug rescue organizations
that have fostered the dogs in homes with other dogs.  Often you can get
a dog that has already proven to be good with other dogs (including small
dogs if that is a worry) and with cats so you know in advance.

Thanks for the quick replies!

I think what it boils down to is that I'm pretty much clueless about
breeds.   When I was growing up we had a Sheltie (miniature collie)
Great dog, was fairly quiet and very timid.  That's really what we need
now I think.

What about Beagles?   I understand they're good with children, which is
a huge plus...but I've read that they have a very interesting bark.
I've never met a beagle before, so I'm not sure what this means.  Will
it wake up our neighbors?   The Papillion has this unique little bark
that can be intense, kinda like that road runner in the old looney
tunes, you'll jump if you don't expect it.

Also, where can I find a dog?   I've had friends go to the humane
society before and they pick up a young "smaller mix-breed" and they
end up growing to 40 lbs....but still cute as a button.    Price isn't
a huge issue, and neither is pedigree as we're not breeders.   I don't
even mind a mixed breed as long as I know what I'm getting, as in one
that won't stomp on our Papillion in a few years.

Thanks again!

A quiet Sheltie?  That's pretty rare.  They have a loud bark relative to
their size and they like to talk.  A lot.  Many consider that a drawback
of the breed.  They tend to be shy with strange people, but generally not
with dogs.  Poorly bred Shelties can be skittish/nervous.

Any dog left outside to it's own devices at night can wake up the
neighbors.  You aren't planning to leave your dogs outside at night are
you?  They need to be with their people.

Beagles bark, but more often, they bay.  It's kind of like a barky howl.
Very distinctive, and the sound carries really well.  They are generally
good with children, but any dog who isn't raised around children might
not be.

The shelties I've known have been both timid and very noisy. According to a
sheltie breeder I've talked to, there can be temperament problems in the
breed in terms of being excessively highstrung. As with all breeds, you have
to be careful.

Beagles make a sound as if someone is sawing them in half with a dull knife.
Beagle people love it. &lt;G&gt; I don't know if your neighbors would. But the
most frequently cited drawback of beagles is their tendency to take off on a
scent and be deaf to all recall attempts. So they have to be managed
carefully.

That's the problem, isn't it? You never really know with a mix. Unless you
get an adult, of course, which could be a good idea. Another option would be
breed rescue, if you decide on a breed. They will have adults for adoption
and have a good idea of their character, so you'd be getting more of a known
quantity.

I should also add that Shelties are great with children and really bond
with their handler.  And for such small, pretty dogs, they are very sturdy
physically.  Mine have loved hiking in the woods and navigating obstacles
on the trails.  They are also very smart and biddable.  Just don't count on
ever meeting a quiet Sheltie again for as long as you live!

Another thing to consider about Shelties is that they need to be groomed
very regularly.  They shed year round and blow their coats twice a year.
They can easily and quickly get uncomfortable matts without daily brushing.

Super folks, thanks!

One last thing, where do I find a beagle or a Papillion?   My
girlfriend got hers a few hours away for $800, but he's got papers.   I
don't care so much for the papers, but I guess if we're getting another
Papillion I *could* get a female and breed them, but there's probably
all kinds of tricks to make that work out, and I'm definitely not the
sharpest when it comes to dogs, let alone breeding them.

I hate the idea of driving three hours to pick up a dog.   someone
really ought to start up a website or something where you can pick a
breed or a city and see what folks have available... the humane society
would probably find more homes that way!

I recommend breed rescue for the tiny dogs. When I was kind of looking
for a toy dog, I had been thinking of a Papillon -- there are some in
rescue but I would suspect the wait to be a bit longer than for other toy
dogs, notably Poodles and Pomeranians. I got my Pom through a rescue
group that fosters all kinds of dogs (and that I knew and trusted), but
there are breed-specific rescues too.

Just fyi, he's great and loved to play with the chihuahua in his foster
home. Now he mostly plays with Queenie the giant. He's a bit sturdier
than a Papillon (imo) but plays very nicely.

==================
Here are a few rescue links you can look over.
Many times they have drivers that deliver the dog and will meet you in a
certain area of your town.  You pay a fee for the service, as they usually
have to drive a long distance.  This was the situation with my daughter's
adopted pugs anyway.  You could inquire.

Because breeding should never be taken lightly, and never by the
clueless.  You admit that you are the latter, so........

in short - there are millions of dogs in need of homes.  They are
"surplus", not because of RESPONSIBLE breeding, but because of
irresponsible breeding (leading to poorly screened owners who fail to
train and be responsible......).

Unless you have a specific goal in mind (and no, "play with puppies"
and "make money" are not good goals), and can back it up with
excellent decision making processes (wonderful examples of the breed,
proven in one or more appropriate objective forum, health testing,
temperament evaluation, etc), it just shouldn't be done.  Oh yeah -
and be willing to stand behind every puppy you sell, forever,
including responsibility for THEM pumping out more puppies.

Try petfinder.com.  Also, your sheltie that was quiet was not normal for
the breed.  Shelties tend to be pretty barky, so don't think you can get
another one of those and expect it to be quiet.  You just lucked out the

Don't get a female and breed them.  More trouble than you want to deal
with and there are too many dogs out there needing homes as it is.
There's a regular poster on rec.pets.dogs.behavior who took in a dog that
turned out to be pregnant.  She'll tell you that you don't want to put in
the sleepless nights and hassles of puppies.  Spay or neuter whatever dog
you get so you don't have to worry about it.

There are tons of genetic issues that are more prevalent in some breeds
than others.  If you don't know the genetic background of both dogs you
breed, you could be breeding dogs with serious health issues (big vet
bills and then dying young anyway) and temperament issues.  Add to that
the fact that there are so many dogs looking for homes that it is sad to
see any more brought into the world to die in shelters.  Go to your local
shelters and look at the dogs about once a week and you won't be able to
even think about breeding a dog.  If you go to the petfinder site, you'll
see all the dogs that need homes.  If you breed and create dogs that
break their owners' hearts and pocketbooks and live to suffer, you won't
be able to look yourself in the mirror.  Bob Barker may know what price
is right, but he doesn't know much about the dog world.

The type of answer depends on the type of dog being bred. But it tends
to fall into two basic categories:
1) the health of the dogs being created by the breeding
and
2) the numbers of irresponsibly bred dogs that are already out there
desperate for homes.

In the case of a toy breed, you're mostly going to fall into category 1,
though depending on your area, category 2 might also still apply.

In terms of health and temperament issues:

Do you know what the genetically inherited problems are for Paps? The
list is long. And the most common actually create a partially crippled
dog. Luxating Patellas are rampant in irresponsibkly bred toy breeds. To
the point that its actually hard to even find a breeder (at least in the
US, but also in many other countries as well) that is taking pains to
get it out of their lines. The reason for this? Toy breeds are small,
therefore people think that breeding their already teeny dog is easy
peasy....and so they just do it. And so do the people they sell their
pups to. And so on and so on....

That's how a couple of dogs with an unknown problem (often, this kind of
problem doesn't clinically show up until the dog is a year or two older
than most backyard breeders choose to breed their dogs) can create a
legion of dogs who all carry the gene for crappy kknees that pop out of
joint at the slightest pressure and who develop crippling arthritis long
before their lives are over.

And that's just *one* genetically related issue. There are plenty more.

Then there's a dog's temperament. A dog's temperament is also
genetically linked. But those that don't know what they're evaluating
for are in no position to even hazard the vaguest guess of what the
temperament of the offspring is going to be. That's what trials and
obedience competitions (or even just working your dog) are for. While
I'd rather that people get third party evaluations of their dog's
structure (for health- sort of-  and for type) and training (for
temperament and teachability), I'd even take some sort of working
training program and temperament screener like a Therapy Dog program, or
anything that requires a high level of training in order for the dog to
participate. But the irresponsible breeder doesn't bother. Their answer
to that sort of thing is "I taught my dog to heel, sit and come when
called. That's enough. Plus, my dog loves everyone, so I know his/his
temperament is great". No, they don't know anything. They know that in
the limited world they've exposed their dog to, their dog has done ok so
far.

A good temperament isn't only good under limited conditions like that,
the teperament needs to be rock solid under *many* conditions, under
many circumstances. If the owner hasn't bothered to train and socialize
their dog to that level (which is a damn lot of work to do), then
they're just hoping and guessing. And there the shelters are filled to
capacity with dogs that are shy, sharp, scared, aggressive, resource
guarding, nervous barkers, skittish biters....the list goes on and on.
And I have *yet* to meet someone about to breed their dog on purpose who
says "yeah, my dog has never been exposed to much outside of my own
house and I don't really know her temperament, and I know the pups may
end up all going to be crazy because of that....but I'm going to breed
them anyway". Nope. They all say "My dog is really great. Everyone loves
her. I just know the pups are going to be great!" Really? Nope. That's
not really how it works. Breed rescues have to deal with MANY lousy
temperaments in dogs that were parts of "family" litters like that. Its
what keeps them so busy, actually. That and the sheer numbers of dogs
created by those same situations.

That's a (believe it or not) brief overview of the health and
temperament issues involved. I left it at that since one of the breeds
you were asking about was a toy breed. If you're looking at a breed
that's even slightly harder to place, then someone else can chime in
with the "sheer numbers in shelters and rescues" part of the equation
&lt;grin&gt;

Keep asking questions. If you're honestly looking for answers, then
there is NO SUCH THING as a stupid question. The more questions you ask,
the more information you'll get.

While you're in the looking phase, actually, the above can all be used
as a warning of what kind of breeder to avoid as well. You also don't
want to be on the receiving end of a pup that's going to end up in pain
and have limited mobility later on. That's something to consider as
well.

Shelters and breed rescues come to mind first.  It's
worthwhile to meet with the rescues, outline your
expectations, learn their expections, and dazzle them with
your lifestyle and dog caringness (careability?).  Since
you're looking for a smaller dog it may take some time.

You didn't ask, but what I'd do in your situation is get an
adult dog from the shelter or rescue.  By getting a grown-up,
two of your concerns will have been pretty well answered: size
and temperament.  Going through rescue and getting a dog which
has spent time in a foster home will give you a better heads-
up on temperament.

Good luck!

I don't think I expressed apprehension about breeding, but you seem to be
responding to me. I just prefer shelter or rescue dogs for myself and
like to encourage others to consider them. If there was a particular
breed of dog that I really, really loved, and which was not readily
available through rescue, then I might consider buying one. But I love so
many breeds, and so many mixed breeds, that I would just prefer to give a
home to someone who might not otherwise find one.

I agree.  Everyone knows, beagles are the result of crossing a wailing

the beagles bark/yelp/howl-thing.  Unless you live on acreage... there
is a chance that a beagle will wake up your neighbors.  Not to mention,
the stupid things are impossible to get rid of.  My fiance has a beagle
who has eaten huge quanitities of chocolate and still won't die.

PS.  The majority of the previous paragraph was sarcastic... I don't
want him to die, and they most likely aren't half banshee.  But I do
find their vocalization to be the most annoying bark I have ever heard.

&gt; The shelties I've known have been both timid and very noisy. According to

There can be temperament problems with poorly bred dogs, either backyard
breeders or show breeders who are not breeding sound temperaments, but that
occurs in every breed. A well bred, well socialized Sheltie will rarely be
timid, and in fact I'm seeing more and more of the opposite - overly
friendly dogs who greet strangers with glee, which is not the correct
temperament either. Given the choice of shy or outgoing, I'd take the
latter, but my preference is the correct one - reserved with strangers,
which means not afraid or timid but not particularly interested until they
know you.
They shouldn't be high strung (which to me means full of nervous energy and
sharply reactive) but they are certainly high energy, and definitely not
quiet. In a Pap house, though, would extra barking even be noticed?

Well, for one thing, Paps have terrible knees in their lines, and
irresponsible breeders (who would sell intact puppies without neuter
requirements, for example) don't bother to check knees prior to breeding. So
if you did find a female and breed a litter, chances are very high that
prior to the end of those puppies adult lives, their owners would be facing
$3-6K in knee surgeries. In fact, there's a pretty high chance that you'll
be facing that as well, and it would be double with two Paps...

We used to encourage it with the beagles living IN our house.

There are different barks.  There's the basic bark - like most dogs.  Let
them raise the alarm and then train a Shut Up.  There's a talking bark -
similar to the yodel we also encourage in our schnauzers.  That's
conversational.  And then there's the actual baying bark - which usually
requires the nose to be filled with rabbit scent to properly initiate.

The basic bark and the talking barks can be controlled just as they would be
for any other breed.  The baying bark is almost primeval.  It sends chills
down my spine.  And I love that one too.

This is an absolutely true story:

Anna wanted to take voice lessons because her stepmom told her she had a
great voice and should have lessons.  Since she hates her stepmom, I told
my ex that I thought that would be great for them to get her voice
lessons and I'd be happy to take her and even pay for half of it because
it was the first positive thing I'd ever heard her say about her stepmom.
He didn't want to pay.  I pointed out that I pay for all of their dance
(which is pretty expensive since Anna started competing) and he still
said he was too poor to pay for it.  When Anna found out, she had a fit
because she had been trying to get them to get a dog from rescue, but the
stepmom insisted that all rescues and shelter dogs have huge issues and
are horrible dogs so she wanted a sheltie puppy from a breeder that they
paid a huge amount of money for.  Plus, she had noted that the sheltie
has more toys than all four of our dogs combined.  Spending more money on
the dog than a year of voice lessons would cost for her didn't make her
feel very important.

So I called him back to talk to him about that and asked him what he was
going to do with the puppy while they went to a family reunion about a
month after this discussion was going on.  He said they were going to
kennel the dog.  I offered to watch the dog, who was not housetrained yet
or trained in any way yet, FOR FREE, let her play with my dogs, work on
her housetraining, work on her house manners, not have her stuck in a
cage for days, etc. FOR FREE so he could put what the kennel would cost
toward Anna's voice lessons and I wouldn't even tell her what I had done.
He would just get credit for putting out money for her voice lessons and
I'd tell the kids I was watching the puppy so she could be in a home
instead of a kennel.

He refused because his wife wouldn't hear of it.  This is the same woman
who brushes the sheltie with a hairbrush, told him shelties don't bark or
shed and also told him that Anna is developing a narcissistic personality
disorder and it is caused by how I am raising her.  I didn't know the
part about what she'd said about Anna until later, but I still wouldn't
have made the dog pay for the stepmom being a bitch.  I've seen poms in
rescue that hadn't been brushed properly regularly and it's not a nice
thing to do to a dog.

By the way, the stepmom's dog completely ignores everyone in that family
and follows my girls around when they are there even though she only sees
them every other weekend.  And when they were trying to teach her to walk
on a leash and she sat and refused to move, Anna took the leash and
Krista, the dog, walked right beside her loose leash without even working
on it.  I think that made it less likely that the stepmom will ever let
Anna brush the dog out, but she was just trying to help and she knows how
to make it fun for a dog to stay with her and keep its attention on her.

&gt; There are different barks.  There's the basic bark - like most dogs.  Let
&gt; them raise the alarm and then train a Shut Up.  There's a talking bark -
&gt; similar to the yodel we also encourage in our schnauzers.  That's
&gt; conversational.  And then there's the actual baying bark - which usually
&gt; requires the nose to be filled with rabbit scent to properly initiate.

&gt; The basic bark and the talking barks can be controlled just as they would be
&gt; for any other breed.  The baying bark is almost primeval.  It sends chills
&gt; down my spine.  And I love that one too.

My BC has a pretty wide vocabulary of noises, each specific to certain
situations.  I can usually tell what's going on just by the sound of
him.  When he wants something - petting, supper, a game of ball - he
moans and grunts.  There's the polite, soft yip he uses to get my
attention when I'm sewing.  There's the "I'm barking because everybody
else is but I'm not particularly concerned" bark.  There's the
high-pitched, frenzied flyball bark.

None of them compare to his intruder alert, a deep roar of rage that
starts from the bottom of his lungs.  The sound that comes out of him
leaves no doubt that he perceives a real threat and means to deal with
it personally.  It makes him sound like a werewolf on steroids.  The
FedEx guy doesn't peek in the sidelight window anymore, either...
