Forget Turkey
What the Armenian Genocide Resolution Is Really About

Irshad Manji,  The New Republic  Published: Tuesday, October 23, 2007

Now playing on Capitol Hill: a political drama over whether Turkey
deserves denunciation for its mass deportation and murder of Armenians
starting in 1915, otherwise known as genocide.

Initiated by the House Foreign Affairs Committee, this symbolic vote
has sparked more than symbolic anger from at the White House--and from
the Turkish government itself. The Bush administration insists that
now is the not the time to be offending Turkey, which borders Iraq and
provides the United States with key access routes in its war on
terror.

Then there are ordinary people like my sister. More accustomed to
condemning President Bush, she too frowns on the anti-genocide
resolution. &quot;How would it benefit the U.S.?&quot; she asked me bluntly in
an e-mail last week. Her question was not that of an American wanting
to protect her country's best interests, but that of a Canadian who
does not trust the motives of her narcissistic neighbor. I told my
sister I would get back to her.

The timing of this resolution should raise questions--all the more so
because of who initiated it: Democrats in Congress. They are the gang
for whom success in today's Iraq, not slaughter in yesterday's Turkey,
is the signal issue in America. HBO's Bill Maher nailed that point
when he quipped, &quot;This is why the voters gave control of the House to
the Democrats. To send a stern message to the Ottoman Empire.&quot;

Still, there is at least one important reason to recognize the
Armenian genocide now, and it relates directly to America's implosion
in Iraq: Democracy has been redefined not just in the Middle East, but
also in the United States. These days, American politicians must pay
attention to &quot;voters&quot; who live well beyond their shores.

As House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has put it, &quot;Some of the things that are
harmful to our troops relate to values--Abu Ghraib, Guantanamo,
torture.... Our troops are well-served when we declare who we are as a
country and increase the respect that people have for us as a nation.&quot;

Hers is a subtle argument about the need for the United States to
reclaim the moral high ground on human rights. It might be too subtle
for most Americans who, let us face it, have little concern for what
may or may not have happened countless miles away more than three
generations ago--especially if the debate harms U.S. troops right
now.

But Ms. Pelosi's argument is not meant for Americans. It is intended
for an international audience.

America remains the only country in the world with a universal
constituency. Domestic politics in the United States often have a
profound effect in every corner of the earth, from determining
immigration flows and investment patterns to handing leaders and their
heirs the excuses they crave to blur the lines between God and
government.

The same cannot be said of domestic politics in modern, multicultural
entrepots such as India, Britain, or China. Nor do domestic politics
in feisty, fiery states like Iran and Israel set precedents for the
rest of us. Not yet, anyway.

No wonder so much of the world seethes that only Americans can vote
for the next president of the United States. I hear it from young
Muslims whenever I travel to Europe. And it is not just Muslims who
express a sense of disenfranchisement. In my home of Canada, a regular
columnist for the newspaper of record recently suggested that Al Gore
would be president if people outside of the United States could cast
ballots.

How many countries enjoy a reach so long and far that non-citizens
would care enough to want a say in its leader--or journalists would
care enough to speculate how the rest of the world would vote?

America's universal constituency is what House Democrats are
acknowledging in their Armenian genocide resolution.

Doubtless, I am about to be accused of naiveté. Left-wing critics will
sniff that this condemnation is a pretext to milk campaign
contributions from Armenian genocide survivors, who, like their Jewish
counterparts, are dying off. And, bonus, worshipping at the altar of
their potent lobbies has its rewards, after all. Right-wing detractors
will sneer that this move is meant to undermine the war on terror by
alienating a crucial ally, even if unintentionally. Indeed, many House
Democrats have begun wavering on the anti-genocide measure because of
Turkey's threat to block its borders to American war planners should
any vote pass.

That threat may be moot: With tensions escalating between military
conflict now looming between Turkey and the Kurdistan Workers Party
(PKK), the border that Washington desperately needs to be free and
clear is not. Ankara has been moving tanks, troops, and choppers to
the Turkey-Iraq border. America's priorities do not count nearly as
much as they did a week ago, genocide resolution or no genocide
resolution.

Which brings us back to the original case for pronouncing on the
Armenian slaughter--a moral case.

The question for Americans ought to be: Since when is it wrong to
speak out against genocide, however many years have elapsed? People of
good conscience continued raising their voices against slavery in the
United States well after abolition. Are they reckless or sinister for
offending many Americans? In any event, is causing offense a reason to
stop remembering?

Here is the question for Turks: Why should your history be immune to
America's judgment when, according to surveys of global attitudes
about the United States, you as a nation are among the most anti-
American (read: judgmental) in all of the Muslim world?

Finally, a question for my sister in Vancouver who suspects American
intentions: As a voter in that massive caucus called international
public opinion, are you ready to credit some United States legislators
for maturing?

I am not sure. Canadians take smug glee in the claim that only one-
third of United States Congress members have passports. It is an old
rumor that Democrats, at least, are striving to shed.

Will non-Americans meet them half way, or will we continue to charge
them all with tribalism in order to appease a deeper insecurity within
our own nations?

The campaign is on. Welcome to democracy.
