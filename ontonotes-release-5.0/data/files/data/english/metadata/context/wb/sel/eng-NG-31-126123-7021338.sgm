Got myself an Epiphone Casino a few years back.  Great guitar with
great action and tone.  The only problem is it hums like crazy and I
can't record with it.

I want to update the electronics on it.  I know that they have been
changed from original, and I want to put them back the way they belong.

Does anyone know where I can find a wiring diagram for this guitar.

Sure. The internet. Google "guitar wiring diagram." It's a typical
Gibson-style 2-pickup circuit.

The real challenge with your Casino is going to be getting the wiring
harness out through the bridge pickup opening, and getting everything back
in its place when you're done.

If it really hums, there are basically two reasons.

The first is the bridge ground not being connected.   On a Casino, this will
go from one of the pots to a hole in the tailblock of the guitar.   Remove
the tailpiece (after loosening the strings!) and you will see it.    You can
test for this by simply connecting a wire from the output jack barrel to the
tailpiece, or by using an ohm-meter set to continuity between those two
spots.

The second is that it has single-coil pickups that can benefit greatly from
shielding, particularly if the guitar has plastic pickup covers.

The stock wiring is very simple and there are many illustrations of it,
standard Gibson, two pickup, two volume, two tone.

I changed pickups in my brothers a while back. Not a scrap of shielding and
not a bit of hum. I put P90's back into it. Single coils with plastic
covers.  Shield your typing fingers and save people a bunch of  wasted time
spent shielding.

if you do have to remove any controls, tie a piece of string round each
one first and leave it dangling out the front of the guitar...you can
use it to pull the control back thru the hole later
