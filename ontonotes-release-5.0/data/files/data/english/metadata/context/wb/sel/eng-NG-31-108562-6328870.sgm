Dear experts,

I've seen some really strange behavior lately, like I've
never seen before.

I have a Dell 4600, with an Nvidia Geforce 5200 card in it.
To date, I've used a simple CRT monitor from Dell.
But this week, I bought an LCD screen from Sony.

There was some flicker.  So, I downloaded the latest
drivers and everything from NVidia, and installed
everything.   There still was flicker.  So, I
decided to compare.

I also have a Sony laptop, and an LCD TV.  I use
my Laptop to play DVDs on the TV.  I took the 4600
downstairs, and plugged it into the TV.  It had
weird display setting when I logged in, but I
changed them and it worked fine.  No flicker on
the TV.

I also brought the LCD display downstairs, and
tried it with the same 4600 computer there.
Interestingly enough, no flicker.

So, what is causing the flicker with the LCD?

I also have another desktop, with an ATI card, that
sits right beside the 4600, and it doesn't give flicker
with the LCD.  (I use a KVM switch to move between computers.)

So, the location makes a difference.
Upstair         flicker
downstairs      no flicker

But, why would I also not get flicker with the other
machine, right beside it?  Strange!

The machines are XP/Linux dual boot.  On the 4600,
it also flickers in Linux.

I read that perhaps the power source might have something to
do with it.  So, I ran an extension from the main floor
upstairs.  No difference.

So, if that is not enough, today when I boot the 4600,
the video settings are off.  They are the same as they
were with the LCD TV.  I change them back.  And when I
reboot, they go back to what they were with the LCD TV!

What a bother!

Questions

1)
How do I set the video settings so that they stay as I
set them?  when I reboot, they are the same as what I
set them to.

2)
Any ideas on what is causing the flicker?

What refresh freq did you set the GeForce card up to?

Check the refresh rate in Display Settings of Control Panel.  It is more
than likely set to 75 or so.  Change it to 60 to stop the flicker.

With the ATI drivers the settings you'll see without forcing the issue will
depend on the .INF file for the monitor. So the next question is, are the
settings ones that the monitor supports? Whether or not the GeForce works
this way it's best to have the proper .INF file. If the monitor didn't come
with one get it from MFG website. If Windows doesn't detect the monitor
change check Device Manager to see what the display is set for. Install the
correct .INF.

Display issues are almost always driver issues. It certainly isn't necessary
to cross post something so simple to 4 groups. Start with the video card
group. Not that familiar with Nvidia but seriously doubt it's worth
repairing anyway. Would make much more sense to get a newer card if it had a
hardware problem.

Check the KVM and all of the cables, in addition to the other
suggestions given.

Depends, are you using the VGA cable to connect to the LCD or a DVI
cable? VGA cables are analog, while DVI are digital. This normally
wouldn't make a difference to an LCD monitor, except unless if the LCD
has a crappy analog-to-digital converter built-in, then you might see
artifacts like this when connecting through a VGA cable. There won't be
any such problem if you connect with a DVI cable, since it's all digital
all of the way.

Change the refresh rate to 60 hz to stop the flicker.

That was the solution!
Geez, you are good!

Thanks a lot!!!

I replaced my very old KVM with a new one just a few days ago.
My old MAG 17" LCD display is the one which I switch.  It's a 75
Hz unit and for some reason when I switched it to the newer PC
its driver kept getting reset to 60 Hz, which causes a dazzling
effect rather than flicker.

The two PCs use the same ATI x1300 256 PCIe card.  After
resetting the scan rate to 75 in CCC for at least the fourth
time, it finally took and the display has been fine since.

The KVM is not properly switching the monitor ID lines, only the video
lines. I think there is a way to specify that the driver ignore the
Monitor ID and just use what you specify...
