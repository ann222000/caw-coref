SUMNER, Wash. -- Detectives say he's like a ghost, switching from one
identity to the next as he steals.

The man's name is a mystery, but detectives have no doubts about his
one-man crime wave around the Pacific Northwest.

He used a stolen ID to buy a pickup truck on a loan. But the
dealership has not seen its money or the truck since the man drove off
with it.

He is also a master at altering his appearance. He takes pains to
alter his appearance.

He has gone by many names over the last ten years, and each identity
is stolen.

Detectives say the man has learned how to get a driver's license for
each alias, which he uses to illegally run up credit.

&quot;We're still trying to ascertain his true and correct ID, his birth
name,&quot; said state trooper Jeff Merrill.

Car dealerships appear to be his favorite target.

Investigators say he takes out auto loans under these assumed
names .They say he used a New Mexico man's identity to buy a $120,000
worth of cars. Boats and jet skis were also on the tab.

&quot;it's a big investigation. It's the forefront of what we're doing in
terms of our auto theft division,&quot; Merrill said.

The man was once caught in Whatcom county on an assault warrant. He
was fingerprinted, but the name he provided proved to be false. But
the man bailed out and fled before anyone realized the mistake.

&quot;He's a clever guy, but he's also very dangerous,&quot; said Merrill.

Detectives say the man is a construction worker by trade and
specializes in framing jobs. But the people who hire him often become
his next victims.

&quot;Our concern at this point is that these crimes seem to be escalating
and we want to stop it before anything more serious or heinous
occurs,&quot; Merrill said.

Detectives say the man lives in the Northwest from time to time, and
say they believe he's currently in the area.

&quot;And we're asking for some help in locating him,&quot; said Merrill.

Anyone with information on the man or his whereabouts is urged to call
911.
