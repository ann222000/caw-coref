One of the internal doors in our 150 year old property has two clear
glass panels some 10 x 30 inches. The glass is deeply etched with an
intricate repeating pattern which features the rose, thistle,
shamrock, and what I take to be an ash leaf, all intertwined with
what could be holly. The roses are about 1.25 inches across to give
some idea of the scale. Although it's clear glass the effect of the
pattern is to make it opaque.

The question is, does anyone know how old these panels are likely to
be? I doubt whether they were original to the property in that they
would, I suspect, have been too 'grand' for what started out as a
very humble farmhouse. But you never know.

I ask because we are in the process of selling up and I would not
like to think of a new owner carelessly tossing the door, complete
with the glass panels, into a
builder's skip, with scarcely a passing thought, as part of some
grand refurbishment. If I could give a little of the probable
history, it might help ensure the panels' survival.

If anyone is into antique glass, I have a somwhat crude brass-rubbing
type image of the pattern which I could forward as an attachment, if
that would help to date them.

What you need is not a rubbing of the design ( I could take your design, or
for that matter , any design from any period, and reproduce it exactly in
glass). You need for someone to look at the glass itself. Depending on the
size of the waves, bubbles, etc. an old glass junkie could give you a pretty
accurate quess. While its true that archetectural restoration glass is
being produced today, you can still pretty easily tell the difference. What
I find interesting, is that you describe the glass as &quot;deeply etched&quot;. It
was standard to just do a surface blast to establish the pattern. Depth
etching is a fairly modern development.

George,
2mm would not exclude the possibility of it being &quot;old&quot;. And of course you
would need to bring the expert to the door and NOT the other way around!
Surely when you sell the house, if you ask for first refusal on buying the
doors if they are ever removed, that will get the point across that they are
desirable/ valuable?
Best wishes,
Janice
