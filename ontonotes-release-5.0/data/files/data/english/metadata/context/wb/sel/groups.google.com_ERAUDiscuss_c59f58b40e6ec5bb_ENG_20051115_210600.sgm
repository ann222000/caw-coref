-Again, my uncle sent me this one. It talks about the basis of our
country back into the making of the constitution. I have no idea who
this guy is who wrote it but it seems like a segment to an ongoing
series. Take from it whatever you wish...

A Lesson From My Past: Part Three

We're on a historical quest to find out why a Supreme Court nomination
provokes such a deep, visceral firestorm in America today.

It didn't used to be that way. Something has drastically changed. What
is it?

Last time, with a brief glance at the U. S. Constitution, we answered
part of our question. The Founding Father's noble plan for a limited
federal government has largely evaporated. A skinny Uncle Sam has been
replaced by a voracious behemoth whose tentacles reach into virtually
every aspect of American life.

And, as we commented last time, few care about an office that wields
little power. Hence, with expanding judicial power comes intense
political battle.

Our answer is still incomplete. There is something deeper here than
mere judicial expanse of power and scope--something that explains why
this has happened. Without the &quot;why&quot; we will miss the &quot;how&quot; of
recovery. So, for our next historical insight, we need to take the
elevator down into the basement of America and examine her foundations.

On my first visit down here, I thought I would find the U. S.
Constitution. I didn't. (That is actually on the second floor, along
with the Declaration.)

What do we find here? Consider a clue from Daniel Webster, July 4th,
1800:

&quot;To preserve the government we must also preserve morals. Morality
rests on religion; if you destroy the foundation, the superstructure
must fall. When the public mind becomes vitiated and corrupt, laws are
a nullity and constitutions are waste paper.&quot;

Hmmm. That's interesting. But certainly not an anomaly. Washington said
it. John Adams said it. Patrick Henry, Samuel Adams, Benjamin Rush,
Noah Webster, and virtually every Founding Father said that the
foundation of America was not the Constitution, contrary to popular
opinion today, but religion. That's what is in the basement. The first
floor was morality, which sprang from religion.

When you read the Founding Fathers, you will find that the issue of
morality was deeply important to them. John Adams tells us why:
&quot;We have no government armed in power capable of contending in human
passions unbridled by morality and religion ... Our Constitution was
made only for a moral and religious people. It is wholly inadequate to
the government of any other.&quot;

The key lies in the perspective they all seemed to share: The
government of the United States was built with the fundamental
presupposition that its people would remain moral and religious. Adams
states that it was &quot;wholly inadequate&quot; for any other.

Patrick Henry went so far as to say that this foundation was the &quot;armor
... and this alone, that renders us invincible.&quot; It is not our tanks,
or planes, or ships that make us invincible, but it is our foundation
of religion and the morality that springs from it. What a vastly
different view from today.

After many years of study, I have concluded that this bedrock is none
other than a deep, comprehensive biblical worldview. It was this
worldview that permeated the writings of the Founding Fathers. It was
this worldview that made up the early American educational system. It
was this worldview that shaped the Constitution.

Does this provide any further insight into our original question? Well,
in fact, it does. But it may not become clear until we fast forward to
1869 and visit a prominent American campus.

See you next time!
