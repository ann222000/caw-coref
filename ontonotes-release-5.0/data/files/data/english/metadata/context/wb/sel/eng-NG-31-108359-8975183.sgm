Well, I started typing &quot;Matt Badiali&quot; into Google and it suggested I
probably wanted to search for &quot;Matt Badiali scam.&quot; That's not entirely
fair though, because a good bit of his hyped up information seems like
it might be within shouting distance of real. I'd hear about the
Alberta tar sands and Colorado oil shale when I was a kid, how it
could supply the world for 500 years but we'd have to pay $100/barrel
for it. So we weren't going to run out soon, it would just get real
expensive. Of course today it looks like if we all keep burning the
oil we'll drown a long time before that 500 years is up.

One thing he got right for sure is that it would take you 18 months of
research at least to really learn enough not to just be gambling like
with anything else you don't really know. The tar sands are finally
paying off. As a pure guess based on 18 seconds of research, I'd doubt
oil shale is going to move all that quick because I hear there is a
lot more variation in quality and thus in cost of recovering the oil
than you have in the tar sands. Each barrel costs more to get than the
last.  So if the prime 10% of the shale is commercially viable with
current prices and technology, the rest still isn't and most of it
probably isn't anywhere close. It not all going to come in together at
the same time like strawberries.

fry - Well stated. In stock market lingo it's called an email blast. I
receive them periodically, and for the most part they are pump and
dump scams. Not to single out this person, but many companies will pay
promoters with shares of their stock, or cash, or both, to write a
report that will drive up the price of their stock. Occasionally these
guys will get lucky and a stock will go up, but for the most part they
have already 'front loaded' a ton of shares, and by the time one gets
the email or pays a fee to see just what company is being touted, the
stock has peaked, the pumpers (i.e...paid promoters) have sold, and
the stock is on it's way back down.

Go to the below website and read about the oil discovery in Colorado.
In the article is a link to another web site called US government

And here's is the best part.

GUEST - Just when you thought the promoters have promoted the Barnett
Shale into the dirt They have dreamed up a new scam for the Barnett
Shale! Promoters with &quot;Barnett Shale&quot; wells long since completed,
watered out or in rapid decline, now are promoting a profitable &quot;cure&quot;
for these wells!!! Investors are now being asked to pony up for this
miracle cure which will allow the well to produce records amount of
natural gas!!! Here is how the scam works. It originates with Humic
Acid (which is a natural MINERAL used from growing plants to cleaning
pipes in Nuclear Reactors) This is true. The scam is some &quot;unnamed&quot;
rogue inventor for a fortune 10 energy company, invented a little
bug... insect that is a cross between a termite and a mineral (humic
acid) that lives the salt water, eats the petroleum bearing shales,
limestone and conglomerate formations. As this bug, insect or critter
eats the formation it passes (farts) huge volumes of natural gas thus
restoring the well back to production higher than when first completed
and will continue eating &amp; (farting) until there is no more formation
to eat. Investors will be approached to buy a bag of these critters,
the operator will &quot;grow&quot; more and once there are pounds of these
critters he will call the service company and they will &quot;inject&quot; the
bugs into the formation and within 72 hours the well will be making
(fill in the blank) _____ MCF per day. I don't know whether to laugh
hysterically or cry at this proposed snake oil, the hype is building
and my guess is in the next 6 months to a year it will be &quot;all the
rage&quot;. You investors don't fall for this scam when it comes a knockin'
at your door.

Just sitting here thinking about all this selling and stuff and
thought.....this is nothing new. Companies sell of assets everyday but
they seldom sell the most profitable. That would be stupid. Even the
stock market and commodity market are influenced by &quot;projections&quot;.
Some are right on the money , some are close while others are totally
out of the ballpark. Mortgage companies make their money solely by
originating, selling and servicing loans. Go get a mortgage. No
telling who you will send your payment to in a couple of months, let
alone next year.

Barnett Shale gas production for Wise, Denton and Tarrant Counties
alone was over 28 billion cubic feet in July. Even at only a 12.4%
royalty and $6.50 gas that put over $23,000,000 into the pocket of
royalty owners and that is just for one month. The same companies
drilling in the Barnett Shale are the people drilling in Freestone
County, Limestone County, Robertson County and all the active counties
of East and South Texas. Barnettt Shale, Travis Peak, Bossier Sand,
Cotton Valley.  They are in it to find gas and make money. And by the
way Travis Peak wells fall off too...someone earlier referred to that
formation on this forum as the &quot;Tragic Peak&quot;.

Will oil sand and tar sound be a big player anytime soon....probably
not...but in time I'd bet the family farm that it will become more and
more feasible to get involved with it. We'll see $100 a barrel oil
next year and probably $115. Makes those areas that were once too
expensive to explore a bit more attractive.

Now...for &quot;Farting Bug&quot;. Man they must have some out of this world
pressure to stimulate a gas well into production. Why not just pour
that big bore hole full of pinto beans and leave out the bugs (the
middle man).

Looks like we opened a bag of bugs.
Here's a guy who claims he invented a method of producing natural gas
by injecting CO2 and water into the Barnett Shale,
(Elementary chemistry?  CO2 + H2O &gt; CH3 + CO2 ?) and then recycling
the resulting CO2 to &quot;make&quot; more natural gas.
Foolproof!

There was a show on modern marvels about this process.  This process
was being tested out in New Mexico.  Where several by products from
other processees was being used to create the CO2.  Real interesting
show but took a large to be successfulll.  Very good show to watch
once in a while.  There are a lot a test plans being done but just not
yet done on a commercial basis.

The individual I mentioned above also says he is a major player in the
Barnett Shale. His operating company really has drilled 10 vertical
wells in the core area (Texas RRC), but the best well seems to be
producing about 50,000 cu.ft. per day (50 mcf). Maybe a glitch in
reporting. They might get more gas by hooking up hoses between a herd
of cows and the pipeline.

Shell has developed a process by which they drill vertical holes,
insert electrodes and heat to 6- 7 thousand degrees, liquifying the
shale in place.  Alleviates the most costly processes, extraction,
transport, crushing, etc,.  They contain the sludge and protect ground
water supply with a twenty to thirty foot wall of ice.  Liquid pumped
around the perimeter and frozen.  They have extracted twelve thousand
barrels using this method.  Exxon cited transportation for inability
to make mining feasible in 1981 and thus closed their extraction
plant.
