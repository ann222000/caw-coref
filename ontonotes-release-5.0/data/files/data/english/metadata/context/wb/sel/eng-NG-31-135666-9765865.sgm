She's in fantastic condition apart from a small error with the DVDRW.
I don't notice any problems with data or video DVD's written, but with
some music CD's containing a large number of tracks (17-20) the last
few skip when imported into iTunes. I suspect there is a minor error
with the superdrive.

She's kitted out with:-

17&quot; Display.
2GB DDR400 SDRAM
250GB HD
SuperDrive (DVD-RW/CD-RW)
Aiport card and Bluetooth built in.
128 MB ATI graphics card
Wireless Kybd
Wireless new Mighty Mouse
Original Box.

It will come freshly formatted with a copy of Leopard (brand new
boxed) installed, ready to go. All for £350 ono.

Note: There is no built in isight camera.

I forgot the processor speed, sorry...

Tis 2Ghz and runs everything I've thrown at it really well. Apart from
Windows that is... It ran Windows XP quite well using Microsoft
Virtual PC 2004.

Thanks Darren, are you selling due to upgrade or some other reason?
Have you had much interest?
Sorry with all the questions, I've never had an iMac before believe it
or not, Powermacs, powerbooks, Macbooks, Minis, yes, but never an
iMac, I'm tempted just because of that and they are lovely but I may
need to sell a couple of Powermacs to rustle up the cash.

thanks
Matt

I'm selling because I have just purchased a new iMac, I loved my old
one so much I had to have another iMac. I've not had any interest
apart from yourself, if you check out the time of the posts you will
see that about an hour after I posted the for sale notice, you mailed
asking about it. So you are the first to ask.

No worries with the questions. I'll see if I can take a photo of it
tomorrow and put it in the files area. It still looks rather gorgeous
even next to the aluminium model.

up this week.And did you say it has leopard installed on it? Disks included
or are you keeping them?

Sold! To Matt,

Yes it (will have) Leopard installed on it, Disks (and fancy box /
manuals) are included. The copy of Leopard is brand new, disc has only
been inserted once.
BTW because it is a new copy of Leopard this does not include the
iLife suite but I'd be happy to include a copy of iLife 06 for an
extra £20, which is again boxed.

Cheers. Send a message to my email account to sort out all the
details.
