J.THOMAS LOONEY
MASON/HELOT JOY
------------------------------------------------------
HELOTS: the serfs of the ancient Spartans. The word was derived in
antiquity from the town of Helos in Laconia, but is more probably
connected with ~Xos, a fen, or with the root of ~XeIv, to capture. Some
scholars suppose them to have been of Achaean race, but they were more
probably the aborigines of Laconia who had been enslaved by the Achaeans
before the Dorian conquest. After the second Messenian war the conquered
Messenians were reduced to the status of HELOTs, from which Epaminondas
liberated them three centuries later after the battle of Leuctra (371 B.c.).

The HELOTs were state slaves bound to the soil assigned to
individual Spartiates to till their holdings; their masters could
neither emancipate them nor sell them off the land, and they were under
an oath not to raise the rent payable yearly in kind by the HELOTs. In
time of war they served as light-armed troops or as rowers in the fleet;
from the Peloponnesian War onwards they were occasionally employed as
heavy infantry, distinguished bravery being rewarded by emancipation.
That the general attitude of the Spartans towards them was one of
distrust and cruelty cannot be doubted. Aristotle says that the ephors
of each year on entering office declared war on the HELOTs so that they
might be put to death at any time without violating religious scruple
(Plutarch, Lycurgus 28), and we have a well-attested record of 2000
HELOTs being freed for service in war and then secretly assassinated
(Thuc. iv. 8o). But when we remember the value of the HELOTs from
a military and agricultural point of view we shall not readily believe
that the crypteia was really, as some authors represent it, an organized
system of massacre; we shall see in it a good police training,
inculcating hardihood and vigour in the young, while at the same time
getting rid of any HELOT found to be plotting against the state.

Gulliver's Travels - by Jonathan Swift
[A further account of Glubbdubdrib.
Ancient and modern history corrected.]

I spent five days in conversing with many others of the ancient learned.
I saw most of the first Roman emperors. I prevailed on the governor
to call up Heliogabalus's cooks to dress us a dinner, but
they could not show us much of their skill, for want of materials.
A HELOT of Agesilaus made us a dish of Spartan broth,
but I was not able to get down a second spoonful.

Plutarch's Parallel Lives: Agesilaus

&lt;&lt;But it added still more to his ill-repute when he put himself into the
service of Tachos, the Egyptian. They thought it too unworthy of a man
of his high station, who was then looked upon as the first commander in
all Greece, who had filled all countries with his renown, to let himself
out to hire to a barbarian, an Egyptian rebel, (for Tachos was no
better) and to fight for pay, as captain only of a band of mercenaries.
If, they said, at those years of eighty and odd, after his body had been
worn out with age, and enfeebled with wounds, he had resumed that noble
undertaking, the liberation of the Greeks from Persia, it had been
worthy of some reproof. To make an action honorable, it ought to be
agreeable to the age, and other circumstances of the person; since it is
circumstance and proper measure that give an action its character, and
make it either good or bad. But Agesilaus valued not other men's
discourses; he thought no public employment dishonorable; the ignoblest
thing in his esteem, was for a man to sit idle and useless at home,
waiting for his death to come and take him. The money, therefore, that
he received from Tachos, he laid out in raising men, with whom having
filled his ships, he took also thirty Spartan counselors with him, as
formerly he had done in his Asiatic expedition, and set sail for Egypt.
As soon as he arrived in Egypt, all the great officers of the kingdom
came to pay their compliments to him at his landing. His reputation
being so great had raised the expectation of the whole country, and
crowds flocked in to see him; but when they found, instead of the
splendid prince whom they looked for, a little old man of contemptible
appearance, without all ceremony lying down upon the grass, in coarse
and threadbare clothes, they fell into laughter and scorn of him, crying
out, that the old proverb was; now made good, &quot;The mountain had brought
forth a mouse.&quot; They were yet more astonished at his stupidity, as they
thought it, who, when presents were made him of all sorts of provisions,
took only the meal, the calves, and the geese, but rejected the
sweetmeats, the confections and perfumes; and when they urged him to the
acceptance of them, took them and gave them to the HELOTs in his army.
Yet he was taken, Theophrastus tells us, with the garlands they made of
the papyrus, because of their simplicity, and when he returned home, he
demanded one of the king, which he carried with him.&gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt;In 464, an earthquake leveled most of Sparta's dwellings and killed
around 20,000. The Spartans believed that the earthquake was the work of
the earthshaking god Poseiden and that Poseiden had been offended by a
recent violation of his sanctuary, from which some HELOTs had been
dragged away and executed. Following the earthquake, the HELOTs
revolted, encouraged perhaps by their belief that the god Poseiden was
sympathetic with their cause. They attacked what was left of Sparta, and
they were joined in their rebellion by nearby enemies of Sparta who
sought advantage from Sparta's sudden tragedy. The Spartans managed to
contain the revolt, which lasted into 462, while it had only ineffective
support from Athens, which was still nominally its ally.&gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt;The earthquake Sparta experienced in 464/65 B.C. strongly directed
politics of the time by contributing to animosity between the Spartans
and the Athenians and has been identified as a significant cause of
Spartan oliganthropia, or shortage of Spartiate men. Literary evidence
for this event is found in Thucydides' History of the Peloponnesian War,
Plutarch's &quot;Life of Cimon,&quot; and Diodorus' series, The Library of
History. However, these sources contradict each other in several
important ways. Thucydides writes that a single earthquake occurred and
places the blame of the ensuing slave revolt on the Messenian HELOTs,
whereas Diodorus refers to multiple earthquakes and
blames the rebellion largely on the Laconian HELOTs.

The possibility that the earthquake occurred at night, thus providing
time for the HELOTs to plot a revolt for the next day is eliminated by
Plutarch's account (158-59; 'Cimon' ch. 16). He relates the story of the
boys who avoid being crushed in the gymnasium because just before the
earthquake &quot;. . . a hare suddenly appeared, and the boys, still naked,
and covered with oil, dashed out to chase it&quot; (158-59; 'Cimon' ch. 16).
The older boys who stayed inside were killed when the gymnasium
collapsed. This appears an unlikely legend of how the boys escaped death
with the help of a benevolent providence, but it could be true. The
disoriented hare could have been driven from its underground burrow by
the slight changes which precede an earthquake. In Earthquakes, Bolt
writes that animals have been noted to act strangely before major
earthquakes in many different countries and time periods (198). Thus,
the above anecdote proves that the earthquake happened in the daytime,
for the boys would not be at exercise in the gymnasium, nor as Chaplin
points out, could have spotted and chased a hare in the dark.&gt;&gt;
