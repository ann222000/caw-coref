Sopranos' Pork Store No More

By JANET FRANKSTON LORIN

KEARNY, N.J. - Eight months ago, James Gandolfini drove his white SUV
out of the parking lot of Satriale's for the last time, as HBO wrapped
up the final season of &quot;The Sopranos.&quot; Now, the building has followed
the same fate as the popular show. It's gone.

Last month, owner Manny Costeira demolished the structure, home to a
fictional pork store where TV mobster Tony Soprano and his Jersey crew
hung out on the acclaimed mob drama. On TV, a life-sized pig sat atop
the building.

&quot;We whacked the pork store,&quot; said Costeira, who leased the empty
building to HBO.

Nine condo units will replace former storefront. The project is called
&quot;The Soprano,&quot; and prices range from $325,000 to $385,000.
Construction is expected to start in the spring and would be finished
in about a year.

Costeira said he can't sign any contracts because he hasn't received
permits; he said he has commitments for at least three units and a
waiting list for the rest.

The show, now popular in reruns, was mostly filmed at a New York City
sound stage, but many scenes were shot across the Garden State to
provide a real Jersey feel. Several sites, including the fake pork
store, were shot in Kearny, a working-class town across the Passaic
River from Newark and about nine miles west of Manhattan.

Now that Satriale's has been demolished, Costeira has been using the
Internet to hawk chunks of cast stone from the facade. He said he's
already sold about 1,000 pieces in two sizes, for $25 and $50, to fans
as far away as Ireland and New Zealand.

The 2-inch-square smaller chunks are mounted on a black wooden block
with an &quot;authentic porkstore&quot; name plate. A &quot;certificate&quot; that
accompanies the larger chunks, about a 5-inch-square, promising it
came from the building that once stood as &quot;the familiar location of
the fictional Satriale's pork store featured on the hit HBO television
series 'The Sopranos.' &quot;

&quot;It's quite a little gag gift,&quot; Costeira said. &quot;For a real Sopranos
fan, it's a real piece of the show. It's a piece of television
history.&quot;

And the demolished building represents one less piece of television
history seen on a popular bus tour of &quot;Sopranos&quot; sites in north New
Jersey.

&quot;The loss of Satriale's of course disappoints a few of our guests, but
we always make the effort to keep the route evolving to include
additional locations and enrich the experience however we can,&quot; said
tour guide Marc Baron.

Instead of the fake pork store, which was always shuttered, the tour
now includes a trip to the Holsten's, a real-life Bloomfield ice cream
parlor where the series' final scene was filmed.

&quot;They now sample onion rings at Holsten's, and sit in the booth that
Tony sat in,&quot; Baron said.

I went to Germany right after the Berlin Wall was knocked down, and people
everywhere in Berlin were selling chunks of it for 10-20 DM each. Â If you
had told me the pieces came from somebody's driveway or sidewalk, I wouldn't
have been able to tell the difference.
