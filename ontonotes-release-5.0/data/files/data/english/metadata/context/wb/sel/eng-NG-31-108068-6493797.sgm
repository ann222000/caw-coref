I was wondering, along with several others, about whether that M16A1 put up
for auction by the Sheriff of Lapeer County, Michigan,  was actually
registered with the feds or not.  Some pointed out a possible legal pitfall
with the 1986 registration deadline if the rifle had not already been
registered by that date.    So, I emailed UnderSheriff Bob Rapson, the man
running the auction, and inquired.  He responded back this morning with,
"The weapon is transferable and registered.  We contacted the local BATF
office to insure that this sale was legal and lawful.  US Bob Rapson".     I
hope whoever wins it sends in a range report to the newsgroup after his
first test firing at home.   If you missed this last week, check out the
auction at: http://www.county.lapeer.org/sheriff/
