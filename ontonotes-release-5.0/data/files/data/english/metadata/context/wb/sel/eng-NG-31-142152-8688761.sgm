The New Chinese Take-Out

By Michael E. Telzrow
Created 2007-08-20 05:00

Lucia Cruz, a 74-year-old Panamanian grandmother, and at least 365 of
her countrymen died last year from ingesting tainted medicine. Somehow a
deadly chemical had found its way into cough syrup produced in a
government laboratory. What Panamanians thought was a harmless
over-the-counter drug turned out to be an elixir of death.

Local doctors were mystified by Cruz's initial symptoms. Unable to
explain the rapid onset of acute kidney failure, they directed her to a
public hospital. More disturbing was the fact that Cruz was not alone.
Dozens of other Panamanians were exhibiting the same symptoms. Dr. Jorge
Motta, director of the Gorgas Institute, a joint U.S.-Panamanian medical
initiative conceived to combat avian flu, suspected an emerging
infectious disease. “Was it West Nile or E. coli or some post-influenza
disease? Could it run through the population?” thought Motta. Neither he
nor others, like Dr. Cirilio Lawson, the general director of the
Ministry of Health, knew what was sickening the population. They only
knew that it was spreading quickly, and that it was deadly.

While Panamanian doctors and officials worked to discover the cause of
the sudden syndrome, Cruz and dozens of others lay in agony as the
supposed disease ravaged their internal organs. Wracked by nausea,
vomiting, and high fever, Cruz watched as her limbs swelled to twice
their normal size. Her painful journey came to an end just weeks after
the onset of symptoms. Her doctors, fearful that she had succumbed to a
deadly communicable disease, advised her family to cremate her body.

In the following months, government officials successfully identified
the cause of the illness as diethylene glycol — a highly toxic organic
solvent commonly found in anti-freeze and other industrial applications.
Its source was contaminated cough medicine. By then over 300 Panamanians
lay dead. Lucia Cruz was No. 17. Subsequent investigations revealed that
the diethylene glycol found in the cough syrup had a Chinese origin and
that it had been passed off to a Spanish company as 99.5 percent pure
glycerin, a harmless sweetening ingredient found in drugs. It was
subsequently sold to Panama's Medicom SA, which passed it on to the
government lab. Diethylene glycol also showed up in antihistamine
tablets and skin ointments made in the same lab.
Tainted Track Record

It wasn't the first time that Chinese diethylene glycol had caused death
from ingestion. Ten years earlier, a series of pediatric deaths were
reported in Haiti. More than 76 children, most under the age of five,
succumbed to acute renal failure in much the same agonizing manner as
the Panamanian victims. As in Panama, medical officials were initially
stumped. Kidney failure is uncommon in children, even in Haiti, a
country plagued by a high infant mortality rate. Matters were further
complicated by Haiti's substandard medical facilities. When Centers for
Disease Control officials arrived from the United States to lend
assistance, they found children suffering from respiratory failure,
facial paralysis, and brain damage. They looked to infectious agents,
but found none. At the end of a long and difficult global investigation,
they discovered the source — diethylene glycol-contaminated medicine
used to treat fevers in small children. In a cruel twist of fate,
medicine designed to alleviate pain contributed to the deaths of more
than 70 children in an excruciatingly painful manner.

As later occurred in Panama, Chinese manufacturers were the source of
the poison. The modus operandi was also the same: bulk chemicals
fraudulently identified as safe glycerin were sold to European
companies, which then passed them on to drug manufacturers. In the
Haitian case, investigators traced the shipment to Xingang, China, and
the Chinese trading company Sinochem International. According to Dr.
Suzanne White Junod, a historian with the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration, attempts to find the origin of the tainted glycerin were
hampered by uncooperative Chinese officials. Her report of the Haitian
incident, which appeared in the January/February 2000 issue of Public
Health Reports, reveals that the glycerin was not even made in a
pharmaceutical plant, but rather in a “fine chemical manufacturing
plant.” According to Dr. Junod, unscrupulous European middlemen further
obscured the origin of the shipment by photocopying their letterhead
onto a copy of the Certificate of Analysis in order to “obliterate the
identity of the supplier.” By the time investigators traced the glycerin
to a Manchurian plant, the plant had been closed and the records destroyed.

Humans are not the only recent victims of contaminated Chinese food and
drug imports. This spring American Food and Drug Administration
investigators determined that Chinese producers had laced wheat gluten
with melamine scrap in an attempt to boost the appearance of added
protein value due to melamine's nitrogen-rich content. This wheat gluten
was added to over 60 million containers of pet food in the United
States. The result has been an estimated 8,000 animal deaths, but an
accurate count will not be known until the FDA finishes its
investigation this fall.

Melamine, a kidney-destroying plasticizer when eaten, is normally used
as an industrial coating or as a fertilizer. Its appearance in other
Chinese export food products, such as corn gluten sent to South Africa,
verifies that its use was intentional, not accidental as Chinese
officials claim. Indeed, during an April visit to China, American food
safety inspectors had little trouble finding Chinese workers who openly
admitted that scrap melamine is routinely used to augment low-grade
wheat, corn, and soybean products, particularly those made for animal
consumption. According to an ABC News source, melamine-tainted products
have been used in the United States as hog feed. Despite a subsequent
Department of Agriculture directive to slaughter 6,000 suspect hogs,
American consumers are now left wondering whether melamine has made its
way into the human food supply.
Death Trade

Recent revelations of diethylene glycol and melamine poisoning highlight
the dangers faced by unsuspecting consumers. As Americans are now
discovering, the pet-food scandal is merely the tip of the iceberg.
Since the discovery of the melamine-laced pet food earlier this year, a
catalog list of tainted and counterfeit export products has emerged,
providing irrefutable evidence of China's deliberate attempt to dump
dangerous products on the world market. From children's toys to
toothpaste, the list continues to grow.

Tainted and counterfeit toothpaste with a Chinese origin has been
discovered in Canada, in Massachusetts, and in prison systems in the
southern United States. A temporary halt to the import of Chinese
toothpaste has failed to eliminate the threat, as Canadian and U.S.
communities are discovering evidence of tainted toothpaste already in
the market. Health authorities began to warn consumers in early July
after tests conducted on counterfeit toothpaste sold under the Colgate
brand name turned up evidence of harmful bacteria. Canadian authorities
then urged consumers to avoid Chinese toothpaste after high levels of
diethylene glycol were discovered. At the same time, Massachusetts
authorities advised consumers to avoid toothpaste marked “Made in
China,” and “Colgate” produced in South Africa, after toxic chemicals
were discovered in the toothpaste sold in several communities. Despite
an FDA warning posted in early June, contaminated products continue to
surface, typically in independently owned grocery and convenience stores.

Tea leaves, the iconic Chinese export, can now be added to the list of
suspect food products. William Hubbard, former deputy commissioner of
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, told National Public Radio about
one Chinese manufacturer's practice of drying tea leaves by using truck
exhausts. “To speed up the drying process, they would lay the tea leaves
out on a huge warehouse floor and drive trucks over them so that the
exhaust would more rapidly dry the leaves out,” said Hubbard. “And the
problem there is that the Chinese use leaded gasoline, so they were
essentially spewing the lead over all these leaves.” Hubbard noted that
the FDA only inspects about one percent of all food and food ingredients
coming into the country, and tests only about half of one percent.

As if contaminated food products were not enough of a concern, American
consumers are now faced with the realization that Chinese-produced toys
pose a health threat nearly as serious as contaminated or tainted food.
In mid-June of this year, more than 1.5 million Thomas &amp; Friends
miniature wooden railway sets were recalled because of lead paint.
Neither the Thomas &amp; Friends manufacturer, RC2 Corporation of Chicago,
nor the British license holder, HIT Entertainment, knew that the popular
children's toys contained lead paint.

Lead paint has the potential to damage developing nervous systems, and
anxious parents now wonder how many other Chinese-made toys might
contain the dangerous material. Preschool children, precisely the group
that is most attracted to these types of toys, routinely put playthings
in their mouths. A toy containing a lead base then becomes a vehicle for
dispersing the harmful substance into a developing child. That type of
exposure may eventually lead to reduced IQ, severe learning
disabilities, kidney damage, and stunted growth, among other adverse
effects.

In all, 24 types of toys recalled in the United States during the first
half of 2007 were manufactured in China. According to the Consumer
Product Safety Commission, 60 percent of all toys recalled in the United
States in 2007 were manufactured in China.
“OPEC of Vitamin C”

Most U.S. consumers are aware that Chinese products dominate the shelves
of most retail stores, but few realize the dominance extends to vitamins
and drugs. Fully 90 percent of all the vitamin C sold in America comes
from the communist trade giant. This near-monopoly control of the
vitamin-C market caused the Wall Street Journal to dub China the “OPEC
of vitamin C,” and like the oil cartel it has been accused of price
fixing. In 2001, China's four largest producers met to form a
consortium, and shortly thereafter began a series of price manipulations
undercutting U.S. and European competitors. Volatile prices induced
American companies, which were operating in a very different regulatory
environment than that existing in Communist China, to file anti-trust
suits. In the end the suits hardly mattered; the last U.S. vitamin-C
plant closed in 2006.

China has since captured much of the world's pharmaceutical market,
producing 70 percent of the world's penicillin, 50 percent of its
aspirin, and most of its vitamins. There are already signs that
Chinese-produced vitamins suffer from the same type of quality assurance
problems affecting Chinese food and goods exports. Recently, the
European Union discovered Enterobacter sakazakii, a lethal bacterium
that causes meningitis in infants, in imported batches of vitamin A. In
America, traces of arsenic, lead, and iron have shown up in discount
products containing vitamin C.

Not surprisingly, Chinese authorities dismiss claims that they are not
following international standards, despite mounting evidence to the
contrary. Meanwhile millions of unsuspecting Americans consume both food
and vitamins of a dubious nature without even realizing it.

As the level of Chinese imports continues to hit record highs, Americans
will be potentially exposed to even greater risks. Even as it stands
now, Gary Weaver, director of the Program on Agriculture and Animal
Health Policy at the University of Maryland, estimates that the average
American consumes approximately 260 pounds of imported food annually.
Annual imports of agricultural products currently top $70 billion, twice
the level of 1997. But unlike playthings or clothes, the Chinese origin
of the food is typically not included on the labeling and American
consumers are forced to play Russian roulette when they buy their groceries.
Behind the Problem

What is the underlying problem behind unsafe and hazardous food from
China? Is the problem largely localized to a few local or regional
officials in the vast country? Is China experiencing growing pains as it
rapidly increases its market share over the food that we consume? If
it's bureaucratic ineptness, can that ineptness be corrected through
more regulation and oversight from the central government in Beijing? Or
is the Beijing regime itself the problem? Put simply: should we trust
the communist giant to make and keep its food imports safe as it amasses
more and more control over our food supplies on the way to monopoly control?

Of course, the Chinese regime blames a few corrupt officials, not the
regime. Tan Jiangying, an official of China's food and drug agency,
parroted the official party line recently when he said: “The few corrupt
officials of the State Food and Drug Administration are the shame of the
whole system and their scandals have revealed some very serious
problems.” Mr. Tan is right in one sense. The scandals have revealed
some serious problems. But the problems go much deeper than just a few
corrupt officials.

The conventional wisdom, espoused by trade specialists and supported by
the mainstream media, is that Chinese central government control over
manufacturers is lax. According to David Fernyhough, of Hill and
Associates, a risk-management firm providing services to corporations
operating in Asia, “The further you get away from Beijing, the more
opaque things get, and at a provincial and municipal level, the
corruption, the influence of the people involved, quite often officials
themselves,... it makes it a very, very difficult environment.” Ian
Coxhead, a professor of economics at the University of
Wisconsin-Madison, told The Why Files that China fits the typical
pattern of an emerging economy: “China, like other fast growing
economies, is undergoing a transition in which the opportunities created
by markets are expanding much faster than the institutions that govern
them, especially accountability in corporate and public sector behavior,
and governmental capacity for design and implementation of regulations
covering health, occupational safety, etc. Under these conditions, fraud
and corporate irresponsibility are to be expected, and these traits are
hardly unique to China, or even to low-income countries.”

Academics and experts may be willing to give China a free pass for its
continued transgressions, but it is doubtful that Americans will react
with such insouciance now that Chinese imports are nearing the $1
trillion mark.

The reputed lack of central government control to rein in corruption on
the part of individual bureaucrats may be a contributing factor in the
eyes of most experts, but to focus on that individual corruption is to
miss the point. Lord Acton famously remarked, “Power tends to corrupt,
and absolute power corrupts absolutely.” The totalitarian communist
regime that has ruled China with an iron fist for almost 60 years has
had a major corrupting influence on those who wield power from top to
bottom. But the power vested in the top officials puts them in a
position to blame their underlings for the corruption, deflecting
attention from the fact that the system itself is corrupt and will not
be changed by replacing one corrupt official with another.

Despite China's integration into the world economy, it remains a
communist model of brute authority and moral ambiguity — one that, by
the way, is openly hostile to the United States.

Chinese ethical transgressions are mainly designed to gain an unfair
advantage over the West, and they show the disdain communist leaders
have for people. Since instituting market reforms, China has manipulated
currency (which forces them to keep the bulk of the populace at poverty
wages), erected importation roadblocks (which lead to higher prices of
Chinese goods for already poor people), and employed slave labor camps
to reduce labor costs, the most recent example discovered in China's
northern Shanxi province that involved 576 involuntary workers.

Communist China is arguably one of the most brutal “post-Cold War”
regimes. The central government persecutes Buddhists, Roman Catholics,
and other religious groups, and Beijing imprisons an estimated eight
million persons — many of them political dissidents. In a display of
utter brutality, Chinese authorities openly engage in organ harvesting.
According to the BBC, the British Transplantation Society maintains that
the organs of executed prisoners are routinely harvested without
consent. China's brutal “one child” policy and its practice of forced
abortions are well known and require little elaboration here. But it is
part and parcel of the lack of respect for human life that seems to
permeate Chinese political will, extending to their trade dealings with
the West.
Questionable Policy

The extent of the problem with China and the cause of the problem and
the low likelihood of change leads us to ask: “Why is our government
sitting on its hands while we give a monopoly on production to China for
items ranging from food to drugs to clothes — all to a country that is
an avowed enemy of the United States?”

Despite our efforts to engage China, first starting with President
Nixon, and carried on by successive administrations, the communist giant
remains a military threat. The People's Liberation Army has developed
and published plans that include an attack on Taiwan. The PLA plan
includes threatening the United States with nuclear war to sway public
opinion before staging an attack on Taiwan. The plan includes strategies
that seek to isolate the United States from its Pacific allies, leaving
Japan and others defenseless in the face of Chinese aggression.
According to Philippine authorities, the Chinese have begun to establish
outposts on uninhabited islands near the island nation. Meanwhile, Los
Angeles and Alaska remain in the sights of a highly advanced Chinese
cruise and ballistic missile system. In a perversely ironic twist, it is
American trade dollars that subsidize China's military build up. Joint
venture investments allow the Chinese to enter the U.S. bond market.
There they borrow millions from U.S. mutual and pension funds and invest
the cash in their armed forces.

The world sees that the Chinese are capable of monstrous acts of
brutality such as forced abortions, organ harvesting, religious and
political persecution, and deliberate food contamination. Likewise,
their push for Pacific Rim hegemony and global trade domination is
manifest. Given those realities, is it paranoia to question the
prudential nature of allowing such a nation to gain control of much of
our food and drug supply?
Country-of-origin Labeling

As already indicated, you cannot escape consuming contaminated Chinese
products by avoiding those marked with “China” as the country of origin.
This is despite the fact that five years ago President Bush signed into
law the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act, which included a
provision establishing the requirement for country-of-origin labeling
for beef, lamb, pork, seafood, perishable agricultural commodities, and
peanuts. Republicans, prodded by retailers who claim the provision is
burdensome, delayed implementation.

President Bush, supported by a Republican majority, effectively
nullified the provision by delaying its implementation until September
2008. Political pressure in the wake of the recent scandals appears to
have moved Congress to revisit the provision. Until it is revisited,
however, there is simply no way of knowing whether your food item
originates in China. Not long after the pet food scandal receded from
the news cycle, Food and Drug Administration officials reported that
rejections of Chinese food products reached 257 for the month of April.
In contrast, Mexico and Canada had 140 and 23 respectively. Among the
offending Chinese food items were salted bean curds, which were rejected
for being “filthy,” and frozen channel catfish, which were infected with
salmonella and laced with “a new animal drug” considered unsafe for
consumption! The FDA refusal-actions list includes dried fruits, apple
flavored jelly, olives, frozen seafood, and sardines.

The government's reluctance to enforce labeling laws has encouraged
savvy farmers and independent ranchers to take matters into their own
hands and to market farm-direct products in the wake of the Chinese
import scandals. By marketing directly off the farm, owners can
eliminate the middle man, thereby reducing mark-up. While farm-direct
sales have always existed, increased consumer awareness about Chinese
food products has led to an increase in activity throughout the country,
and many Americans are taking control of their food sources.

One U.S. health food company has taken the country-of-origin label
concept a step further. Orem, Utah's Food for Health International
intends to label its products “China-Free.” President Frank Davis
recently told Reuters that “It is a response to the (headlines) coming
out, and we are taking a position that we are not the only ones reading
them.”

A comprehensive country-of-origin law would greatly enhance the
consumer's ability to choose, and might even result in a voluntary
boycott of Chinese goods, providing a boost to domestic producers. But
country-of-origin labeling would not be a panacea. For starters, false
labeling, a favorite trick of the Chinese, was discovered on boxes
marked “tangerine candy,” and in a number of other instances. In May,
U.S. officials warned Americans to beware of imported fish labeled as
monkfish. It seems that the Chinese exporter mislabeled puffer fish,
whose flesh contains deadly toxin, as the popular monkfish. The tail of
the monkfish is especially prized for its delicate flavor, while
ingesting puffer fish flesh can lead to serious illness or even death
from tetrodotoxin poisoning. According to an FDA press release, a total
of 282 22-pound boxes labeled as monkfish were distributed to
wholesalers in Illinois, California, and Hawaii beginning in September
2006. These fish were then sold to restaurants or sold in stores.
Degrease the Skids

But even more important than requiring country-of-origin labeling, or
labeling products “China-free,” is changing those U.S. government
policies that have greased the skids for China's rapidly increasing
market share of what we buy from toys to food. Those policies include
encouraging American corporate interests to do business with China and
to establish operations there, and providing U.S. taxpayer-subsidized
and -backed loans and loan guarantees through agencies such as the U.S.
Export-Import Bank and the World Bank.

Meanwhile, operations that remain in the United States are compelled to
comply not only with an unfavorable tax situation but with a massive
regulatory system that squeezes profits and forces owners to pass the
costs on to the consumer. The Competitive Enterprise Institute recently
released a report entitled Ten Thousand Commandments 2007: An Annual
Snapshot of the Federal Regulatory State. Its preparator, Clyde Wayne
Crews, lays out a picture of a federal regulatory system that cost
Americans $1.14 trillion last year!

America has traditionally been committed to maintaining a policy of
competitive enterprise. In 1952, Harold R. Bruce, government professor
at Dartmouth, wrote in American National Government: “This policy has
its roots both in the democratic political tradition of equality of
opportunity and in the belief that economic progress and efficiency are
promoted by the spur of competition.” Unless America returns to its
tradition of “equality of opportunity” by de-regulating the business
environment and seeks to seriously address the trade imbalance, it will
become increasingly dependent upon China at its own peril.

The stakes are high. The ease with which the Chinese are now able to
flood our market with substandard and highly dangerous consumer and food
products gives rise to the question — how hard would it be to use the
current import system to introduce harmful elements into the food supply
as an asymmetrical warfare technique? Given China's record of brutality
and military aggression, is there any reason to believe that China might
not employ such measures in the future, particularly if its market share
of our food supplies continues expanding? For Americans the possibility
seems less fantastic with each new headline. Until the United States
strengthens its ability to prevent the importation of dangerous goods,
and significantly reverses the trade imbalance through a reduction in
regulatory requirements and other measures, American consumers will be
left to their own devices.
