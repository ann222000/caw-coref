OK.... I will begin the croc story. Of course Janice will have much more to
add...

It is possible to get from our house to town via a "golf cart road". This is
just a sand path that has horrible pot holes, and the holes fill up with
water when it has rained. It is also through the jungle, abuts the lagoon in
some areas, and the mosquitoes can be horrible. The other option for getting
to and from town is a boat ferry which runs every 2 hours. It's about a 15
minute ride to town, and is a breezy cool, bugless way to get to town. The
road takes... maybe 45 minutes on a good day, maybe impassible on other
days.

Janice and Kim (another friend) decided that they just had to have a golf
cart. They rented one. Monday I'm working away (early afternoon) and they
say "We're going to drive north on the golf cart road - sight seeing." (away
from town). So, great... "see you later". About 3 o'clock they stop back by
the house and say that they are going to now go to Journey's End Resort for
a drink. This is the other way - south, toward town. It is just a little
ways down the beach - 5 minutes by golf cart.

So, I keep working... typing away... glancing at my watch. Pretty soon it is
dark outside. I finish up my work and go upstairs and start to wonder what
I'm going to do... It is now quarter til 7, and very dark. They should have
been home hours ago. Just as I am figuring out a plan I hear a golf cart and
voices and giggling on the road, and sure enough here they come.

They have pizza in hand. They have driven all the way to town. Got stuck in
a hole in the road. This part of the road borders the lagoon. They can't get
out of the hole, so Janice stepped out into thigh-high water/muck. She tells
me "Then I head a "smack" on the water... wonder what that was." Um... that
would be a crocodile. Good thing she didn't have the pizza in her hands or
the croc would have had dinner, and Janice would not have hands. Then Janice
had to walk and find some locals to pull them out of the muck - for a price.
She left Kim on the cart with the pizza and an open bottle of wine. Kim had
a good time.

Now, I'm sure Janice can embellish on this story because at that point I did
not want to hear any more about it. I ate my pizza and took away their keys.
Janice and Kim continued to giggle and talk about it, and said the whole
one-day adventure was worth the 5-day rental of the cart. KIDS!
