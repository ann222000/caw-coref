It's always a (theoretical) possibility.
How could anyone prove or disprove
that contention?

One guide is to look at the competition.
About the only 'topical allusion' Strats
find in the sonnets is the 'hate away' =
'Hathaway' pun of Sonnet 145. Apart
from being an appalling 'pun' in its own
right, it does not fit the grammar of the
sonnet . . . nor any other aspect of it.

11. Doth follow night, who like a fiend
12. From heaven to hell is flown away.
13. I hate, from hate away she threw,
14. And sau'd my life saying not you.

And then there are the Marlites who drag
something right out of context from
Sonnet 112 (something about him really
being alive after 1609, when everyone
thinks he's dead -- but they have the poet
writing about himself -- or something).

11. To cryttick and to flatterer stopped are:
12. Marke how with my neglect I doe dispence.
13. You are so strongly in my purpose bred,
14. That all the world besides me thinkes y'are dead.

Not one of the allusions, references
or puns that I find are remotely as far-
fetched as either of these.

&gt; I once gave a reading of my poetry at Harbourfront in Toronto. A very
&gt; effusive woman came up to me afterwards, asking me to autograph a book
&gt; for her. She adored my poetry, particularly one poem which she talked
&gt; about in great and wondrous detail. I was extremely flattered. My
&gt; poetry was deep, my poetry was full of metaphor, my poem contained a
&gt; brilliant allegory. Only one problem. All of that stuff existed in her
&gt; head. My poem was about something else entirely. She fashioned her
&gt; construction of my words so that they fitted a topic she was extremely
&gt; interested in. I believe you're doing the same thing.

"/>

That's a fine belief -- common around here.
The only way to argue for it -- or its opposite
is on the words of the sonnets. Guess who
quotes the words -- all the time. Guess who
avoids quoting them as much as possible.

IF you (or your fellow-'fair youth' theorists
around here) had the beginnings of a case,
then it should be child's play to focus on
particular instances and show how my 'puns'
do _not_ fit the grammar of the sonnet -- or
that they are not reasonable puns, or that
they are not puns Shakespeare uses else-
where -- or that they are not of the nature
of the kind of puns he uses elsewhere.

How come I NEVER get that sort of
challenge? How come that best of the
objections is of the same vacuous,
context-free nature as the one you are
making now?

I have shown how numerous sonnets fit the
model of a particular courtier addressing his
monarch in sonnet form, mostly in the late
1570s and early 1580s. She is known to have
love such poetry and to have received it in
large quantities. Oxford is known to have
been a courtier in high favour at the time,
with a dramatic fall from grace in 1581.
So the Oxford-Queen theory makes sound
economic, historical and personal sense
It also provides more than adequate reasons
for the anonymity of the poet -- extending to
his plays.

The 'fair youth' theory makes no economic,
historical nor personal sense, and derives
entirely from crude, unimaginative readings
of the poems by those were fooled by the
cover-up. So they never knew the identity
of the poet and could never have imagined
that of the addressee.)

For those who might wonder what Paul is blethering about
this time, I imagine he is referring to a thread which I
started back in June 2001 called &quot;Sonnet 112 - from a
Marlovian viewpoint&quot;. It was not &quot;Marlites&quot;, it was me.

I will repost it now, for more than one reason:

1) It will enable people more easily to see precisely what
I did say at the time, rather than having to rely upon
Paul's grotesquely inadequate representation of it.

2) It illustrates rather well, I think, just what Gary,
Lynne and others have been asking for when they suggest
that Paul needs to relate the meanings he finds within
a sonnet to an overall meaning for the sonnet itself.

3) It might be possible to use it as a sort of 'pilot' to
try out how an individual sonnet might be dealt with in
Bob's proposed book. (It is about twice as long as he has
in mind, but as he is allowing two bites, that might work
out reasonably well).

&lt;quote&gt;

*Sonnet 112 - from a Marlovian viewpoint*

As I promised in the 'The Authorship' thread, another (brand
new?) piece of 'evidence'.

The first thing we need to be aware of is that this Sonnet is
the last in a group of four.

Sonnet 109 is - as Katherine Duncan-Jones puts it - &quot;The first
of two sonnets on the speaker's voluntary absence from the
youth.&quot; The words of the sonnet make it fairly clear, however,
that he has not only &quot;rang'd&quot;, but has done something
(unspecified) of which he is ashamed.

In Sonnet 110 we find out what it is. He has &quot;gone here and
there&quot; (or as we might say, been putting it about) and his
affection seems to have strayed to an even younger friend. He
has, furthermore, &quot;lookt on truth / Askonce and strangely&quot;,
which sounds very much like what Marlowe was accused of doing.
He has, in doing this, made himself appear a fool, &quot;a motley to
the view&quot;.

[Aside: the function of a Fool at Court was apparently to be
'licensed' to say things which, said by anyone else, would have
led them swiftly to the gallows. If Baines's report of
Marlowe's sayings was in any way accurate, this is exactly how
he too seems to have acted whenever he had an audience.]

In Sonnet 111, he goes on about his &quot;harmfull deeds&quot;, which,
as Kerrigan points out, are &quot;No doubt the faults recorded in
Sonnets 109 and 110&quot;. We learn that, as a result, his &quot;name
receiues a brand&quot; (something that is very difficult to relate
to Shakespeare, but which would fit Marlowe - branded an
'atheist' - perfectly), and begs the youth, twice, to pity him.

So to Sonnet 112, which goes thus (in Q):

YOur loue and pittie doth th' impression fill,
Which vulgar scandall stampt vpon my brow,
For what care I who calles me well or ill,
So you ore-greene my bad,my good alow?
You are my All the world,and I must striue,
To know my shames and praises from your toungue,
None else to me ,nor I to none aliue,
That my steel'd sence or changes right or wrong.
In so profound *Abisme* I throw all care
Of others voyces,that my Adders sence,
To cryttick and to flatterer stopped are;
Marke how with my neglect I doe dispence.
You are so strongly in my purpose bred,
That all the world besides me thinkes y'are dead.

(1) YOur loue and pittie doth th' impression fill,
(2) Which vulgar scandall stampt vpon my brow,

Referring back to the love spoken of in 109, 110 and 111, to
the 'brand' which his name has received, and to the pity begged
in 111, he says that the youth's love and pity has helped to
remove the pain he has felt at being so stigmatized by the rest
of the world.

(3) For what care I who calles me well or ill,

He doesn't care what people call him, with, I think, a joke
about his having to write as 'Will'. As Booth puts it:

The sense of the clause is obvious ... but the use of this
sense of &quot;to call&quot; (&quot;to title&quot;, &quot;to address by the name of&quot;)
with adverbs is not idiomatic. The unusual construction may
be accountable to a pun on &quot;who calls me Will&quot;...

(4) So you ore-greene my bad,my good alow?

...As long as the youth forgives him his faults and accepts the
good in him.

I am reminded of Edward Blount's words concerning
Thomas Walsingham's attitude to Marlowe, which were of his
&quot;entertaining the parts of reckoning and worth that you found
in him&quot;, implying, perhaps, that not all of his &quot;parts&quot; were
equally commendable.

(5) You are my All the world,and I must striue,
(6) To know my shames and praises from your toungue,

The youth is everything to the poet, who uses the phrase &quot;all
the world&quot; to be able to use it again with a different meaning
later. The poet must find out these things only from him
because...

(7) None else to me ,nor I to none aliue,
(8) That my steel'd sence or changes right or wrong.

...there is nobody else who is alive to him (nor he himself -
who is alive to nobody else) that can, whether right or wrong,
change his well-defended self-image. The idea of being alive to
nobody else (which was of course literally true in Marlowe's
case) is also introduced, as we shall see, to be built upon
later.

(9) In so profound *Abisme* I throw all care
(10) Of others voyces,that my Adders sence,
(11) To cryttick and to flatterer stopped are;

He has buried (deep in his unconscious mind?) all care about
what others might say about him and, like the adder referred to
in Psalm 58, is deaf to anything they say about him, whether
flattering or critical.

(12) Marke how with my neglect I doe dispence.

Now we come to the denouement for all four sonnets. The
'neglect' must be his neglect of the youth which was the main
topic of the first three, and he is now (I think with tongue
planted firmly in cheek) going to explain how it happened.
&quot;Observe how I now excuse my having neglected you&quot;.

(13) You are so strongly in my purpose bred,

The youth has become so much a part of him...

(14) That all the world besides me thinkes y'are dead.

To understand this, we need to look carefully at the words
&quot;besides&quot; and &quot;y'are&quot; and see precisely how Shakespeare used
them in other contexts.

If we look at the First Folio, for example, we find the word
&quot;besides&quot; just over 100 times. These are almost always either
the adverbial 'Besides', mostly at the beginning of a sentence
and meaning, as in *OED* 2.b, &quot;Introducing a further considera-
tion: As an additional or further matter, moreover, further.&quot;
(about 60 times):

Besides, I will be sworne these eares of mine,
Heard you confesse you had the Chaine of him,

or the preposition meaning &quot;over and above&quot;, &quot;as well as&quot;, or
&quot;in addition to&quot; (about 40 times):

Might yet enkindle you vnto the Crowne
Besides the Thane of Cawdor

There are just a few (about 4) where it means &quot;out of &quot; (some
mental state):

Alas, sir, how fell you besides your fiue witts?
or
Quite besides the gouernment of Patience

But on NO occasion is the word used in the sense of &quot;other
than&quot;, &quot;with the exception of&quot;, or &quot;excluding&quot;.

As far as &quot;y'are&quot; is concerned, I managed to find 43 in the
First Folio, all except one (which seems to have been a
misprint for the word &quot;yare&quot;) quite clearly meaning &quot;you are&quot;.
These include two quite well known ones from the Danish Prince
himself:

Excellent, excellent well: y'are a Fishmonger
and
Y'are welcome Masters, welcome all.

So, getting back to that last line - what do we find? Well I
would say it harks back to line 7 (&quot;nor I to none alive&quot;),
and should be interpreted: &quot;That all the world thinks not only
that I am dead, but that you are too&quot;.

As with my interpretation of the Monument's meaning, I have
again assumed that the words as printed were intentional, and
do make perfect sense. But you will see, I guess, why I say
that this is from a Marlovian viewpoint. Everybody did think
(erroniously, we would say) that Marlowe was dead, but there is,
as far as I can tell, no way in which Wlliam Shakespeare of
Stratford could be so snugly fitted into this otherwise fairly
obvious meaning.

&lt;end quote&gt;

For anyone interested in the arguments which were offered to
counter this suggestion (which I am not intending to deal
with all over again), they are all still available, courtesy
of the Google database.

&quot;Each and every sonnet&quot; -- nonsense.

Strats (and all 'fair youth' theorists) haven't
a clue about ANY sonnet . . When did you
last see a remotely plausible exegesis of
any one of them? Neither do they have the
honesty to admit that. We have hundreds
of books full of false claims -- that they
'explain' the sonnets -- when any child can
tell that there is not a single explanation in
the whole book.

I freely admit that I don't understand many
sonnets. But I do understand quite a lot --
and I have gone into them in detail here.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Saying that your
&gt; theory is correct and that the rest of us are dunces for not

I get annoyed when the words of the sonnets

idly waffling on and on.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; This has nothing to do with being

So quote some words 'on the page'

Yeah. Great theory. Send homosexual love
poems to a fair youth to encourage him
to marry someone (anyone) -- before his
beauty fades -- otherwise (once he loses
that beauty) he won't be able to pass it on.
Great idea -- been done millions of times

This is all very well, but sonnets are personal expressions. They are
not meant to make economic, historical or personal sense. They are
usually written because the poet is driven to write. Other readings
may be possible (I've seen some great ones. Marty Hyatt just did one
in Carmel) but they cannot be, I believe, the most important meaning,
or the generating reason for writing them.

I'm sorry I haven't seen all your work on the sonnets. I haven't been
on hlas long but will pay close attention to it in future. However,
although I can quite see the Queen may well have been a &quot;character&quot; in
the poetry, and she might also have been given it to read, I still
can't get over the s/he problem in the first 120 odd sonnets. I don't
believe she is the addressee. She may be &quot;Beauty&quot; in some instances.
Bob Prechter's analysis of a cipher in the dedication to the sonnets,
given three years ago at Stratford, was extremely clever and made
numerous allusions to the Queen (spelt &quot;Elisabeth,&quot; by the way). But
it also unmasked the names Oxford, Wriothesley, Bassana (Emilia
Bassano?), among others. I wish he would publish his findings.

Yes, Paul. I was jet-lagged. My jet lag usually announces itself in an
inability to sleep. I flew from Toronto to Baltimore to Chicago to San
Jose to Dallas to Baltimore to Toronto. One day I dipped my toes in
the Atlantic, the next day in the Pacific. Three days later I was back
on the Atlantic coast. I was also travel weary, in the sense of Sonnet
63's &quot;travail.&quot; I was helping to run a conference, speak on a panel,
and give readings/workshops to university students. The fact that I am
not yet completely well probably helped the jet lag along, but if you
know that I arrived back in Baltimore at about 2am, didn't get to bed
till sometime later, and had to get up at 6am (which had been 3 am the
day before) to go speak to a college class, you may comprehend better
why I may have been suffering from jet lag.

If you can't, I now understand why *you* don't understand the
arguments of others concerning the sonnets.

Lynne

P.S. By the way, in Canada, unlike the States, there are four and a
half time zones. I traversed three of them on my travels through the
US, but had been in yet another, Atlantic Time, a small while before.

&gt; So, getting back to that last line - what do we find? Well I

This illustrates my argument perfectly.
We all believe (to some extent) that the
poet expressed personal feelings about
his life in his sonnets. So there should be
_something__somewhere_ supporting
authorship contentions (of the Stratman,
of Marlowe, etc.)

Marlowe was supposedly absent on the
Continent from 1593, sending his sonnets
to his 'adored' by post. Is there _anything_
in the sonnets indicating that?

No.

Ah well. -- But there is a quick reference in
Sonnet 112 about 'all the world' thinking
someone is dead. Marlites make a grab at
this. But it ain't right. So what to do?
Obviously -- reinterpret it to get it to fit,
somehow, in some way.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; 14. That all the world besides me thinkes y'are dead.

&gt; should be interpreted: &quot;That all the world thinks not only

"/>

If I was guilty of a single 'interpretation'
as forced as this, I would not dare to
show my face. Yet THIS is the sum total
of all that Marlites rely upon (as far as
anyone has ever indicated in this forum).

Likewise the 'hate away' = 'Hathaway'
'pun' is the sum total of all that Strats
rely upon. (And that, if anything, is
even worse.)

Why are both so bad? And not just
bad -- but abysmal.

Could it be that neither the Stratman
nor Marlowe had anything to do with
the sonnets? Could it be that there
is nothing in the sonnets that can be
forced -- without this sort of straining
and these sorts of distortions -- to
relate to the lives of either the Stratman
or Marlowe?

How come, then, that Crowley can do
it so easily for Oxford? And at such
length, and with such thoroughness
in so many sonnets?

The only 'interest' I can see is the extent

I never distort meaning or grammar.

Your claims will be vague because no
remotely reasonable scenario is possible
for the 'fair youth' theory. I could pose
a hundred questions on it, that you
would have to dodge. Likewise you
will be unable to get any support for
it from the sonnets.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; The 'fair youth' theory makes no economic,

&gt; This is all very well, but sonnets are personal expressions. They are
&gt; not meant to make economic, historical or personal sense.

"/>

Most of human life makes (and has to make)
economic, historical and personal sense.
Anyone who has studied the sonnets knows
that they represent thousands of man-hours
from one of the most capable persons of all
time. That man could (at least theoretically)
have used that ability to make thousands of
pounds of income in that time. Yet, we know
that he also had to live, and that he was
desperately short of money for most of his
adult life. How many other great works of
art have been produced for free?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; They are
&gt; usually written because the poet is driven to write.

"/>

The sonnets, as we see them, are not,
generally, of that nature. They are
essentially frivolous -- 'courtier poems'
(as, ironically, Stratfordian commentators
often remark).

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; However,
&gt; although I can quite see the Queen may well have been a &quot;character&quot; in

So quote your best examples of sonnets

&quot;Proof&quot; is always a bad word to use in these discussions. Better to

Ah, this from the man who claims &quot;poverty&quot; is a pun for &quot;poop,&quot; or the
like, gave my a truly Kathmanian laugh. Paul, &quot;Hathaway&quot; was
pronounced &quot;Hat a way,&quot; back then. It was an excellent pun, and
worked in the context of the poem. It is also very direct.

&quot;I hate&quot; from hate away she threw/ And saved my life, saying, &quot;not

The pun makes two harmonizing meanings, both grammatical, possible:

(1) she propelled the phrase, &quot;I hate,&quot; away from the emotion of hate
and in the process kept the poet from dropping dead of disappointed
love by adding the phrase, &quot;not you.&quot;

(2) she propelled the phrase, &quot;I hate,&quot; away from herself, Hat-a-way,

&gt;&gt; I once gave a reading of my poetry at Harbourfront in Toronto. A very

&gt;&gt; poetry was deep, my poetry was full of metaphor, my poem contained a
&gt;&gt; brilliant allegory. Only one problem. All of that stuff existed in her
&gt;&gt; head. My poem was about something else entirely. She fashioned her
&gt;&gt; construction of my words so that they fitted a topic she was extremely
&gt;&gt; interested in. I believe you're doing the same thing.

It's a foolish belief. How can the poet be sure his poem was NOT
about what the woman said it was about? I've found things in poems of
others that their creators never intended but agreed were there, and
others have found things in my poems that I never intended--even
unconsciously--but had to admit were there. (For instance, some
ancient Egyptian symbolic meaning of &quot;lilac,&quot; that worked very well in
a poem I wrote about the wanderings of Odysseus, in my opinion.)

&gt; that they are not reasonable puns, or that
&gt; they are not puns Shakespeare uses else-

&gt; 2) It illustrates rather well, I think, just what Gary,

I definitely agree that Peter's discussion illustrates what we've been

Almost. That is, I would accept it happily, but would want more
discussion of each sonnet as a poem: what devices does it use, why is
it pleasurable for most people to read (or not), etc. This latter is
important, because many anti-Stratfordian interpretations assume that
the sonnets would be of no value if not for the sub-meanings they
discover while Stratfordians tend to find poetic excellences in the
sonnets that make them of great value without said sub-meanings--that,
in fact, tend to make most said sub-meanings intrusive.

There are several sonnets which could be taken to support

Er, not quite, Paul.

Editors and commentators have always had difficulty agreeing
upon the meaning of the last line of Sonnet 112,

&quot;That all the world besides me thinkes y'are dead&quot;.

but as far as I am aware, none of them has taken account of
the following two facts.

1) In over 100 uses of the word &quot;besides&quot; in his plays and
narrative poems, Shakespeare *never* uses the word to mean
&quot;with the exception of&quot;, &quot;other than&quot; or &quot;excluding&quot;.

2) Shakespeare uses the abbreviation &quot;y'are&quot; over 40 times,
and (with the exception of one obvious misprint) it always
means &quot;you are&quot;.

Therefore, *by far* the most likely two meanings for the
line are:

&quot;That all the world thinks not only that I am dead, but
that you are too.&quot;

and

&quot;That all the world, including me, thinks that you are
dead&quot;

It is my contention (slightly different to what I thought
a couple of years ago) that 'Shakespeare' had *both* of
these interpretations in mind when he wrote the last line.
He was (with tongue in cheek) excusing his neglect of the
addressee on the grounds that:

a) the addressee is so much a part of the poet that all
the world thinks he must be dead too, and

b) all the world thinks the addressee must be dead, so he
did too.

Now this interpretation, based as it is upon the words as
they were printed in Q, and using the meanings that Shake-
peare himself invariably used, makes perfect sense if we
assume that the Marlovian scenario is correct. I am,
however, unaware of any other Anti-Stratfordian or Strat-
fordian interpretation that doesn't have to rely instead
upon an unprecedented (by Shakespeare) use of the words
&quot;besides&quot; and &quot;y'are&quot; and/or upon a misprint of some kind.

Is anyone?

One of the many differences between our approach to this
whole thing is that I find, generally speaking, that I am
happy to go along with the various interpretations of the
Sonnets offered by Shakespearean scholars. In some cases,
however, it seems to me that a Marlovian perspective can
provide a better reason for the poet having said something
in a particular way, or (as in this case) solve what is
otherwise an intractable problem for them. That'll do.

'Besides' is a perfectly ordinary word, and
the poet knew exactly how it was used.
When he wrote those words, he knew
exactly how they would be read. Of course,
he was often mischievous, and might have

No. It is a very difficult confusing sonnet.
But the meanings you extract from it are
as clear as mud. You illuminate not a

backing in other sonnets for anything of
this nature. IF your theory had a scrap
of truth, you should find plenty.

Likewise . . or much worse . . the whole
'fair youth' thing is bad enough under
the Stratfordian scenario (no worse than
merely insane). Oxfordian 'Tudor Heir'
theorists square that level of insanity.
But it seems that a Marlite would have
to cube it. -- The poet was carrying on
this relationship from the other side of
the Continent?

This requires the poet to have written, &quot;That all think,' or &quot;the
world thinks,&quot;&quot;you as well as me are dead,&quot; in a ridiculously awkward
way, even for an Elizabethan poet, and it does not fit the sense of
the rest of the poem. Previous to that, the poet says he's consigned
others' voices, pro and con, to a place where he can't hear
them--i.e., made them dead. Then he asks the addressee to pay
attention to how with his &quot;neglect,&quot; or refusal to give heed to those
voices, he has--what? Made the world think he and the addressee are
dead rather than make the world seem to him dead? Which makes more

I think it must mean, as was said before: &quot;that all the world except

&gt;&gt; I will repost it now, for more than one reason:

&gt;&gt; 1) It will enable people more easily to see precisely what
&gt;&gt; I did say at the time, rather than having to rely upon
&gt;&gt; Paul's grotesquely inadequate representation of it.

&gt;&gt; 2) It illustrates rather well, I think, just what Gary,
&gt;&gt; Lynne and others have been asking for when they suggest
&gt;&gt; that Paul needs to relate the meanings he finds within
&gt;&gt; a sonnet to an overall meaning for the sonnet itself.

&gt; I definitely agree that Peter's discussion illustrates what we've been
&gt; asking from Paul in vain: a surface meaning with a possible, implicit
&gt; meaning that all of the surface meaning harmonizes with.

&gt;&gt; 3) It might be possible to use it as a sort of 'pilot' to
&gt;&gt; try out how an individual sonnet might be dealt with in
&gt;&gt; Bob's proposed book. (It is about twice as long as he has
&gt;&gt; in mind, but as he is allowing two bites, that might work
&gt;&gt; out reasonably well).

&gt; Almost. That is, I would accept it happily, but would want more
&gt; discussion of each sonnet as a poem: what devices does it use, why is
&gt; it pleasurable for most people to read (or not), etc. This latter is
&gt; important, because many anti-Stratfordian interpretations assume that
&gt; the sonnets would be of no value if not for the sub-meanings they
&gt; discover while Stratfordians tend to find poetic excellences in the
&gt; sonnets that make them of great value without said sub-meanings--that,
&gt; in fact, tend to make most said sub-meanings intrusive.

"/>

I think there's a value to both text and subtext. In Shakespeare the
surface meaning of the poetry is stunning and certainly holds great
value for me, but his words are not always comprehensible. We
anti-Strats try to find sub-meaning because it makes the poetry (and
the plays) more significant, more accessible for us, and informs our
reading of the work, just as David Copperfield is more significant if
we know what Dickens went through as a child, just as Ben Jonson's
work is more understandable if we know about the sons of Ben, etc.
Otherwise, how would we decipher

&quot;Welcome all who lead or follow
To the Oracle of Apollo...&quot;

If we tried, we'd likely be entirely wrong. So what we are all doing
(Paul, and Peter, and I and others) is trying to give context to the
poetry. We may be either right or wrong. But it's a fascinating and
meaningful game.

Best wishes,

Sonnet 112 has great Baconian significance. From the beginning of the
Sonnets, Sonnet 112 contains lines 1556 through 1569. We know Bacon
was born in 1561.
(Line 1561 begins with the word &quot;To&quot;, which adds up to 33 in
Elizabethan Simple Cipher, which is the same as &quot;BACON&quot;.) (Is that
Peter I hear laughing?)

Are there Ciphers? Well, maybe, they might be coincidences. For
instance in the facsimili of the original 1609 version, line 9 of the
Sonnet says:

&quot;In so profound Abisme I throw all care&quot;

The word &quot;Abisme&quot; is capitalized and italisized. The Reverse Cipher is
103.
A=24 + B=23 + I=16 + S=7 + M=13 + E=20 = 103. 103 is the Simple Cipher
of
&quot;SHAKESPEARE&quot;. (Peter, control yourself, probably a coincidence.)

Reverse the &quot;Ab&quot;, and then the word can become, &quot;Ba is me&quot;, &quot;Bacon is
me.&quot; (Coincidence.)

Anyway, look closely at the next line:

&quot;Of others voyces,that my Adders sense,&quot;

Meaning? &quot;In so profound Shakespeare I throw all care, of other's
voices (Shakespeare's voices), that my Adders (capitalized by Bacon
for emphasis, &quot;adders&quot; defines as &quot;those who add&quot;, like me) sense
(yes, I am an adder who senses his meaning). (Coincidence.)

Next line:

&quot;To cryttick and to flatterer stopped are:&quot;

This line is self explanatory I think. The &quot;adders&quot; sense the real
meaning, his critics and flatterers are stopped from knowing. Next
line:

&quot;Marke how with my neglect I doe dispense.&quot;

He is saying to notice how he dispenses his message only to those who
he wants to know. (Maybe.) Now the important lines:

&quot;You are so strongly in my purpose bred,&quot;

His mother, Elizabeth, is so strongly bred into his purpose, his life.

&quot;That all the world besides me thinkes y'are dead.&quot;

Of course, she died in 1603, and all the world is unaware that she
lives in him. Sad isn't it?

This Sonnet is one that is significant to Baconians, if for no other
reason than being where Line 1561 happens to land. There is more about
this one that I won't even get into on this forum. But hey, of course
this might just be coincidences. Even though others were playing games
like this with their literary works, that doesn't mean &quot;Shakespeare&quot;
was.

I apologize for the above post. I know it will drive some of you nuts!

I can't understand this at all. But I obviously need to
clarify what I am suggesting. First, it is - as I said -
tongue in cheek. He doesn't expect this argument to be
taken any more seriously than lines 5-8 of Sonnet 109.
(Booth's notes on which are very helpful).

The pseudo-logic in 112 goes something like this:

1) (You are so much a part of me) that all the world must
think you are dead as well as me.

2) In other words: &quot;That all the world besides me thinkes
y'are dead&quot;

3) Which also means &quot;That all the world (and me too) thinks
you are dead.

4) And this explains why I have been neglecting you.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Sure, the &quot;y'&quot; has to be taken as a misprint which I don't
&gt; want to do, but the other interpretation requires the poet
&gt; to express himself too awkwardly and illogically to seem

You, of all people, want poetry to be *logical*!?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;&quot;That all the world, including me, thinks that you are

&gt; This can't be because it contradicts all the rest of the poem,
&gt; especially line 7, which says no one else (but the addressee)
&gt; is alive to the poet.

"/>

Blimey, Bob. Not even Paul pretends to know what *that* line
means. In the context of what I say above, however, it could
mean that there is no-one else alive to him (ie whom he knows)
who is able to change his mind. His reason for putting it this
way would be to allow the &quot;nor I to none alive&quot;, which paves
the way for the denouement.

First, I'm not an anti-Shakespearean. I'm an anti-Stratfordian. There
is a world of difference.

Second, you've just made an old, tired argument, Spam. You know
nothing about me or many other Oxfordians and cannot generalise.
Almost all the Oxfordians at the Shakespeare Fellowship conference
were left wing. And I'm anti-Royalist, as it happens. The only reason
Oxfordians suggest that de Vere wrote Hamlet is that they believe his
upbringing, education, and experience are an excellent fit with the
play, that the play was written from an aristocratic viewpoint, and
that there are obscure legal issues which only someone well-versed in
the law and with access to the legal documents (which were not in
English) would know and understand.

I could say: The only reason that Stratfordians aren't interested in
submeanings is that they might turn up something which is anomalous or
contrary to their ideas about Shakespeare and which they don't wish to
examine. But I don't. It's not too polite, and I realise I have no
right to generalise.

Of course. To see it as anything else is to get angry and bitter about
it. There are enough things in life which are difficult without
allowing one's views on Shakespeare to become an added hardship.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt; Therefore, *by far* the most likely two meanings for the
&gt;&gt;&gt; line are:

&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;That all the world thinks not only that I am dead, but
&gt;&gt;&gt; that you are too.&quot;

&gt;&gt; This requires the poet to have written, &quot;That all think,'
&gt;&gt; or &quot;the world thinks,&quot;&quot;you as well as me are dead,&quot; in a
&gt;&gt; ridiculously awkward way, even for an Elizabethan poet,

&gt; His words are &quot;That all the world besides me thinkes y'are
&gt; dead&quot;. The &quot;besides me&quot; means &quot;as well as me&quot; and &quot;y'are&quot;
&gt; means &quot;you are&quot;.

&gt; Replacing them, we get &quot;That all the world as well as me
&gt; thinks you are dead&quot;. Whilst the more obvious meaning is
&gt; that it is &quot;all the world as well as me&quot; doing the thinking,
&gt; it is also *possible* for the &quot;as well as me&quot; to refer to
&gt; the being dead.

"/>

Yes, if the poet was being ridiculously awkward. As I said. If I
were writing the poem and tried to get a double meaning in, and ended
with such an awkwardly expressed second meaning, I'd take it out.
Pride in craft, and all that.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;I am suggesting that this double meaning
&gt; was deliberate, as I will explain below.

&gt;&gt; and it does not fit the sense of the rest of the poem.
&gt;&gt; Previous to that, the poet says he's consigned others'
&gt;&gt; voices, pro and con, to a place where he can't hear
&gt;&gt; them--i.e., made them dead.

&gt; He certainly doesn't. It is his *care* about what is said
&gt; that he has thrown into the *Abysme*.

"/>

It's a follow-up to &quot;none else to me, nor I to none alive.&quot; True, he
threw his &quot;care&quot; of other voices into the abysm, literally, but in
doing so, he makes the others' voices dead, since he can't hear them.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Then he asks the addressee to pay attention to how with
&gt;&gt; his &quot;neglect,&quot; or refusal to give heed to those voices,

&gt; No, Bob, as I explained, the neglect he is excusing (in my
&gt; interpretation, which is the one we are discussing) is his
&gt; neglect of the 'fair youth'.

"/>

I'm discussing what the poem says. There's is nothing in it
indicating his neglect of the fair youth; to the contrary, he says the
fair youth is central to his purpose, which is the opposite of
neglect.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; he has--what? Made the world think he and the addressee
&gt;&gt; are dead rather than make the world seem to him dead?
&gt;&gt; Which makes more sense?

&gt; I can't understand this at all.

"/>

I'm asking how, in the context of this poem, he can logically suggest
that he's jettisoned the world to concentrate on the fair youth and as
a result has made the world think him and the fair youth dead instead
of making the world seem dead to him.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; But I obviously need to
&gt; clarify what I am suggesting. First, it is - as I said -
&gt; tongue in cheek. He doesn't expect this argument to be
&gt; taken any more seriously than lines 5-8 of Sonnet 109.
&gt; (Booth's notes on which are very helpful).

&gt; The pseudo-logic in 112 goes something like this:

&gt; 1) (You are so much a part of me) that all the world must
&gt; think you are dead as well as me.

&gt; 2) In other words: &quot;That all the world besides me thinkes
&gt; y'are dead&quot;

&gt; 3) Which also means &quot;That all the world (and me too) thinks
&gt; you are dead.

&gt; 4) And this explains why I have been neglecting you.

&gt;&gt; Sure, the &quot;y'&quot; has to be taken as a misprint which I don't
&gt;&gt; want to do, but the other interpretation requires the poet
&gt;&gt; to express himself too awkwardly and illogically to seem
&gt;&gt; possible.

"/>

Make that, &quot;to seem as likely as a misprint.&quot;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; You, of all people, want poetry to be *logical*!?

"/>

Absolutely. See my brilliant analysis of the fish in the pond poem I
shook Crowley to the roots of his critical being with. The logic of
the best poems take a long time to recognize but has to be there. By
logic, here, I mean mainly lack of unexplained flagrant contradiction.
An effective poem can say I love you and I hate you, but only if the
poet makes it clear that it is about inner conflict or the like.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt; and

&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;That all the world, including me, thinks that you are
&gt;&gt;&gt; dead&quot;

&gt;&gt; This can't be because it contradicts all the rest of the poem,
&gt;&gt; especially line 7, which says no one else (but the addressee)
&gt;&gt; is alive to the poet.

&gt; Blimey, Bob. Not even Paul pretends to know what *that* line
&gt; means.

"/>

I didn't realize it was a tough line. &quot;none else to me,&quot; means no one
else (but you) is to me (alive); &quot;nor I to none alive&quot; means &quot;nor am I
to anyone alive,&quot; with a typical double-negative of Shakespeare's
ignored.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; In the context of what I say above, however, it could
&gt; mean that there is no-one else alive to him (ie whom he knows)
&gt; who is able to change his mind. His reason for putting it this
&gt; way would be to allow the &quot;nor I to none alive&quot;, which paves
&gt; the way for the denouement.

"/>

Well, it's better than any of Paul's sub-meanings. I prefer my take,
naturally, but looking at the case objectively, I would say it's a
toss-up as to who is right. But external evidence would decide
whether there was anything in the poem about someone being thought
literally dead who is alive.

&gt;&gt;&gt; a sonnet to an overall meaning for the sonnet itself.

&gt;&gt; I definitely agree that Peter's discussion illustrates what we've been
&gt;&gt; asking from Paul in vain: a surface meaning with a possible, implicit
&gt;&gt; meaning that all of the surface meaning harmonizes with.

&gt;&gt;&gt; 3) It might be possible to use it as a sort of 'pilot' to
&gt;&gt;&gt; try out how an individual sonnet might be dealt with in
&gt;&gt;&gt; Bob's proposed book. (It is about twice as long as he has
&gt;&gt;&gt; in mind, but as he is allowing two bites, that might work
&gt;&gt;&gt; out reasonably well).

&gt;&gt; Almost. That is, I would accept it happily, but would want more
&gt;&gt; discussion of each sonnet as a poem: what devices does it use, why is
&gt;&gt; it pleasurable for most people to read (or not), etc. This latter is
&gt;&gt; important, because many anti-Stratfordian interpretations assume that
&gt;&gt; the sonnets would be of no value if not for the sub-meanings they
&gt;&gt; discover while Stratfordians tend to find poetic excellences in the
&gt;&gt; sonnets that make them of great value without said sub-meanings--that,
&gt;&gt; in fact, tend to make most said sub-meanings intrusive.

&gt; I think there's a value to both text and subtext. In Shakespeare the
&gt; surface meaning of the poetry is stunning and certainly holds great
&gt; value for me, but his words are not always comprehensible. We

I am not a blatant liar, but I am tending towards denial that he twice

very charitable, Greg, was he? This is from *Timber,* I believe,
published after his death. Here is the entire note:

DE SHAKESPEARE NOSTRAT
I remember, the Players have often mentioned it as an honour to
Shakespeare, that in his writing, (whatsoever he penn'd) hee never
blotted out line. My answer hath beene, would he had blotted a
thousand. Which they thought a malevolent speech. I had not told

to commend their friend by, wherein he most faulted. And to justifie
mine owne candor, (for I lov'd the man, and doe honour his memory (on

an open, and free nature: had an excellent Phantsie; brave notions,
and gentle expressions: wherein hee flow'd with that facility, that
sometime it was necessary he should be stop'd: Sufflaminandus erat; as
Augustus said of Haterius. His wit was in his owne power; would the

I am very difficult to satisfy, Greg. Ask my husband. And Jonson was a
master of the game. Where does it say &quot;of Stratford?&quot; And even if it
did say that, there was a Stratford atte Bowe in London. We all know
that Shakespeare (or Shake-speare) wrote the canon. So did Jonson. But
who was Shakespeare? I also must say, now that you've brought the
topic up, as it were, that I love the line: &quot;wherein hee flow'd with
that facility, that sometime it was necessary he should be stop'd:
Sufflaminandus erat...&quot; and wonder (don't want to upset you guys with
my vulgarity) whether it might refer to farting. Jonson was a great
joker and the story goes that Oxford was a great farter. There is an
anecodote that he was so embarrassed because he farted at court that
he went away for a long time. When he returned, the Queen said: &quot;My
Lord, I had forgot the fart.&quot; (John Aubrey's Brief Lives)

Now I'm sure that Terry will be after me for my bad Latin. However, I
should like to point out that the following is from Encyclopaedia
Britannica:

&quot;Here Jonson held forth on the nature of poetry and drama and paid his
final tribute to Shakespeare: in spite of acknowledging a belief that
his great contemporary was, on occasion, 'full of wind'—sufflaminandus
erat—he declared that 'I loved the man, and do honour his memory, on
this side idolatry, as much as any.'

Right, Jonson knew. But what he knew is not quite as evident as you
believe it to be. He had no hate clubs (neither do we). He had the
Sons of Ben at the Apollo Room at the Devil's Tavern. He ran a secret
society with initiation rites--although this may have been some kind
of travesty of Freemasonry or Rosicrucianism--and some of us still
wonder what the big secret was.

Thank you for allowing me to talk about one of my favourite topics. If
you like I'll do part two: Haterius and Augustus.

&quot;sufflamen&quot; (from which the verb comes) is a brake or drag-chain on a cart

Augustus, which is recorded in one of Seneca's vivid descriptions of
Haterius' style as an orator. He spoke very fast, with a copious flood of
wide-ranging imagery, not appreciated by Augustus, who presumably shared
Seneca's stated preference for the older, cooler style of oratory: &quot;our
friend Haterius needs the brake putting on&quot;. So Jonson was suggesting that
Shakespeare wrote too fast and with little discipline, pouring out rhetoric
and poetry unchecked by self-criticism. Haterius was, it should be said, the
most admired orator of Seneca's day, as, one imagines, Jonson took
Shakespeare to be the most admired dramatist of his own.

It's interesting to note that Milton, apparently in his youth a keen
theatre-goer, wrote of Shakespeare as &quot;Fancy's child&quot; (i.e. the offspring of
Imagination) pouring out his &quot;native wood-notes wild&quot; - and contrasted him
with the &quot;learned&quot; Jonson.

That is indeed the premier meaning, but one can see it as a kind of
double entendre: a brake on garrulousness (not so much on writing.
Look at the excerpt again), and a *plug* for a fart. You might see if
you can find that meaning in the Latin. To deny that Jonson ever
played with words this way is almost as silly as to deny that he,
well, passed wind. And to deny that Oxford was talkative...well....:)

Sorry, the word means what it means. I don't see how there is even the
slightest possibility of double entendre. I can only think that the EB
writer was confusing it with some other word. There is a Latin verb
&quot;sufflare&quot; meaning &quot;blow, inflate [as of a trumpeter's cheeks]&quot; or
figuratively (as a reflexive) &quot;become angry&quot; or (in the perfect participle
form 'sufflatus') &quot;puffed up with self-importance&quot;. None of these seems to
imply farting, even faintly or as a pun, and certainly none fits the passage
from Seneca, where we find the gerundive implying &quot;... ought to be/should
be/must be/needs to be....&quot;&quot;Our friend Haterius&quot;, said Augustus, &quot;needed to
have the brake put on&quot;. The criticism that Haterius spoke too fast and
couldn't control his rhetoric is clear from the original context: we're even
told that he employed a freedman to signal to him when he ought to slow
down or stop.

I look forward to that. It's clear that, especially in &quot;L'Allegro ...&quot; and
&quot;Comus&quot; but also in parts of &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;, Milton was deeply influenced
by his knowledge of Shakespeare. The passage from which I was quoting seems
to imply that Milton had not just read the plays but also seen at least a
few of them.

Perhaps you'd like to explain the
meaning or the 'wit' of the pun. Is
there some interesting analogy or
parallel or striking contrast between
a 'hate away' and a 'Hathaway'? Or
does the switch from a phrase to a
person make it interesting in some
way?

Perhaps one way to look at it would
be to try to consider how (IF it were
truly present, and the Stratman had
been the poet) the illiterate Anne (as
wife or as the wooed lover) would
have seen it. She's had to have it
explained to her. So maybe you can
see yourself as the person doing
that?

If you were courting a woman with
the surname of 'Hathaway' (or even
with the Christian name 'Anne') would
you be tempted to recite this sonnet
to her ?

Those lips that Loues owne hand did make,
breath'd forth the sound that said I hate,
To me that languisht for her sake:
But when she saw my wofull state,
Straight in her heart did mercie come,
Chiding that tongue that euer sweet,
Was vsde in giuing gentle dome:
And tought it thus a new to greete:
I hate she alterd with an end,
That follow'd it as gentle day,
Doth follow night who like a fiend
From heauen to hell is flowne away.
I hate, from hate away she threw,
And sau'd my life saying not you.

&gt;&gt; 'Besides' is a perfectly ordinary word, and

&gt;&gt; When he wrote those words, he knew

&gt; No, Paul, it is up to you to show what wit was intended for

I don't follow this 'argument'. I am not
putting forward some peculiar interpretation.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt; Therefore, *by far* the most likely two meanings for the
&gt;&gt;&gt; line are:

&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;That all the world thinks not only that I am dead, but
&gt;&gt;&gt; that you are too.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt; and

&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;That all the world, including me, thinks that you are
&gt;&gt;&gt; dead&quot;

&gt;&gt; 14. That all the world besides me thinkes y'are dead.

&gt;&gt; So how come this is the way in
&gt;&gt; which nearly everyone reads the line?

&gt;&gt;&quot;That all the world except me thinks you are dead.&quot;

&gt; They don't. Certainly neither Booth nor Kerrigan anyway.

"/>

They most certainly do. Kerrigan goes for
'they are' but reads 'beside me' as 'except me':

This is Booth: (part of a very long discussion
of this sonnet):

&quot;A third kind of reading leaves line 14 essentially as it is in Q
and understands it as it would be understood if its context
were unknown: &quot;That, except for me, all the world thinks you
are dead&quot; (a reading which, like the &quot;they are&quot; reading, allows
for the ambiguity of besides me-&quot;except me&quot; or &quot;in addition
to me&quot;- by which the assertion would include its own
contradiction, &quot;not only I, but all the world thinks you are
dead&quot;). This third way of reading the line is in some ways more
satisfactory than the others: it makes no major change in the
line; it requires no puzzling out of y'are as a contraction of
&quot;they are&quot;; it takes y'are as an obvious contraction of &quot;you are&quot;;
it provides an appropriately startling conclusion instead of a
mere restatement of lines 5 and 7. On the other hand, this
straightforward acceptance of the meaning on the page
demands that a reader spin out the argument by which this
obvious sense of the Q line relates to the poem, a task so
difficult that it is the source of the whole controversy about
the line; this is Martin Seymour-Smith's strenuous effort to
justify taking the line at face value:

Booth quotes Seymour-Smith
&quot;The sense [of lines 13-14] is: &quot;The world (which does not
understand anything about my love for you, or about my
desire for the ideal personage that you could become),
imagines you as dead, i.e. ordinary and vulgar as it is itself.&quot;
He [the speaker] has already said (1.5) that the Friend is his
&quot;All the world,&quot; and here he clearly shows that he knows he
is addressing one (the Friend as he actually is) who, like
&quot;all the world besides me,&quot; has no understanding of his
poetically inspired &quot;purpose.&quot; . . &quot;

Have you done the same work on other
Elizabethan texts? Or on modern texts?
'Besides' is such a common word that to say
you locate relatively few instances _in_this_
_sense_ probably merely indicates that other
senses are more common. So what?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Given your views on the abilities of the editors in general,

They go wrong with their slavish adherence
to sets of daft notions (e.g. 'the fair youth') but
they would be sound enough on language
issues, such as the normal use of words, or on
slippages (over the centuries) in meaning and
sense. It's not a particularly recondite topic.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; What tools did the 'fair youth' have

&gt; He knew how the word 'besides' was understood at the
&gt; time. Most of 'us' clearly do not.

"/>

You need to show that there has been a
systematic change in the use of the word,
and that an Elizabethan would NOT have
been expected to read it as 'EXCEPT' or
'OTHER THAN' or 'EXCLUDING'. But, of
course, you can't do that -- because that
was a (or the) common sense of 'besides'
at the time.

With wanton heed, and giddy cunning,
The melting voice through mazes running;
Untwisting all the chains that tie
The hidden soul of harmony.

Notice that Milton draws a clear distinction between Jonson's
learning and Shakespeare's &quot;native&quot; talent.

I concede your point in the first and
third cases (where I was too hasty)
but not in the second.

Peter Farey wrote

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 1) In over 100 uses of the word &quot;besides&quot; in his plays and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; narrative poems, Shakespeare *never* uses the word to mean
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;with the exception of&quot;, &quot;other than&quot; or &quot;excluding&quot;.
&gt; Here are three from Cymbeline:

&gt; First Gentleman: I cannot delve him to the root: his father
&gt; Was call'd Sicilius, who did join his honour
&gt; Against the Romans with Cassibelan,
&gt; But had his titles by Tenantius whom
&gt; He served with glory and admired success,
&gt; So gain'd the sur-addition Leonatus;
&gt; And had, BESIDES this gentleman in question,
&gt; Two other sons, who in the wars o' the time
&gt; Died with their swords in hand;

&gt; And had, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF this gentleman in question,
&gt; Two other sons, who in the wars o' the time
&gt; Died with their swords in hand;

&gt; And had, OTHER THAN this gentleman in question,
&gt; Two other sons, who in the wars o' the time
&gt; Died with their swords in hand;

&gt; And had, EXCLUDING this gentleman in question,
&gt; Two other sons, who in the wars o' the time
&gt; Died with their swords in hand;

"/>

In the above case 'excluding' would be
wrong. The 'First Gentleman' obviously
did not mean to exclude Posthumus from
being his father's son.

But in the following, Iachimo IS excluding
'that hook of wiving' from his list of those
qualities that make men love women.

&gt; IACHIMO [ . . . .]

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Of him that best could speak, for feature, laming

"/>

Here Imogen does NOT exclude all of Cloten's
vices from her list of his attributes.

The use of 'besides' is certainly complicated.
(God knows how a non-native speaker can
manage to learn its use.) Peter Farey's
argument is that Shakespeare's use of it
is unusual. He has not yet shown that.
Its sense as 'excluding' seems to be
_relatively_ uncommon (in both modern
English and in Elizabethan English).

In any event, it is a known sense, and the
poet can be expected to have chosen the
word with great care. Peter makes the
quite false claim that we can base our
understanding of the poet's meaning in
this location in this sonnet on his usual
practice in other texts. It's as though
'table' must always mean an article of
furniture, and should never be read as
anything else.

Why can't a tiny fraction of the effort that
goes into analysing these wothless 'puns'
be devoted to some of those I have found?

Oh, I know why. Mine work. Everyone
knows that. But the last thing anyone
would want to do is to prove that to
themselves. That would mean that they
would have to change their opinions on
all sorts of matters -- opinions to which
they have grown excessively fond.
That would never do.

I never said there were no metaphors. I said something to the effect
that what Milton said contradicted Oxfordian doctrine, which it does.
A metaphor can be used to contradict a doctrine.

Thanks for making my point, Jim. I didn't realize the Milton passage
was in L'Allegro.

"/>

I don't think Milton is denying that Shakespeare had a formal education or
asserting that Jonson had one. &quot;Jonson's learned sock&quot; is not the same as
&quot;Jonson's university-educated sock.&quot;

See Milton's &quot;Of Education&quot; for his opinion of the ways students were
taught in his time (and his ideas for reforming education). Here are a
few paragraphs:

The end, then, of learning is to repair the ruins of our first parents by
regaining to know God aright, and out of that knowledge to love him, to
imitate him, to be like him, as we may the nearest, by possessing our
souls of true virtue, which, being united to the heavenly grace of faith,
makes up the highest perfection. But because our understanding cannot in
this body found itself but on sensible things, nor arrive so clearly to
the knowledge of God and things invisible as by orderly conning over the
visible and inferior creature, the same method is necessarily to be
followed in all discreet teaching.

And seeing every nation affords not experience and tradition enough for
all kind of learning, therefore we are chiefly taught the languages of
those people who have at any time been most industrious after wisdom; so
that language is but the instrument conveying to us things useful to be
known. And though a linguist should pride himself to have all the tongues
that Babel cleft the world into, yet if he have not studied the solid
things in them as well as the words and lexicons, he were nothing so much
to be esteemed a learned man as any yeoman or tradesman competently wise
in his mother-dialect only.

Hence appear the many mistakes which have made learning generally so
unpleasing and so unsuccessful. First, we do amiss to spend seven or eight
years merely in scraping together so much miserable Latin and Greek as
might be learned otherwise easily and delightfully in one year. And that
which casts our proficiency therein so much behind is our time lost in too
oft idle vacancies given both to schools and universities; partly in a
preposterous exaction, forcing the empty wits of children to compose
themes, verses, and orations, which are the acts of ripest judgment, and
the final work of a head filled, by long reading and observing, with
elegant maxims and copious invention.

These are not matters to be wrung from poor striplings, like blood out of
the nose, or the plucking of untimely fruit; besides the ill habit which
they get of wretched barbarizing against the Latin and Greek idiom with
their untutored Anglicisms, odious to be read, yet not to be avoided
without a well-continued and judicious conversing among pure authors,
digested, which they scarce taste. Whereas, if after some preparatory
grounds of speech by their certain forms got into memory they were led to
the praxis thereof in some chosen short book lessoned thoroughly to them,
they might then forthwith proceed to learn the substance of good things
and arts in due order, which would bring the whole language quickly into
their power. This I take to be the most rational and most profitable way
of learning languages, and whereby we may best hope to give account to God
of our youth spent herein.

And for the usual method of teaching arts, I deem it to be an old error of
universities, not yet well recovered from the scholastic grossness of
barbarous ages, that, instead of beginning with arts most easy (and those
be such as are most obvious to the sense), they present their young
unmatriculated novices at first coming with the most intellective
abstractions of logic and metaphysics; so that they, having but newly left
those grammatic flats and shallows where they struck unreasonably to learn
a few words with lamentable construction, and now on the sudden
transported under another climate, to be tossed and turmoiled with their
unballasted wits in fathomless and unquiet deeps of controversy, do, for
the most part, grow into hatred and contempt of learning, mocked and
deluded all this while with ragged notions and babblements, while they
expected worthy and delightful knowledge; till poverty or youthful years
call them importunately their several ways, and hasten them, with the sway
of friends, either to an ambitious and mercenary, or ignorantly zealous
divinity: some allured to the trade of law, grounding their purposes not
on the prudent and heavenly contemplation of justice and equity, which was
never taught them, but on the promising and pleasing thoughts of litigious
terms, fat contentions, and flowing fees. Others betake them to state
affairs with souls so unprincipled in virtue and true generous breeding,
that flattery, and court-shifts, and tyrannous aphorisms appear to them
the highest points of wisdom, instilling their barren hearts with a
conscientious slavery, if, as I rather think, it be not feigned. Others,
lastly, of a more delicious and airy spirit, retire themselves, knowing no
better, to the enjoyments of ease and luxury, living out their days in
feast and jollity; which, indeed, is the wisest and safest course of all
these, unless they were with more integrity undertaken. And these are the
errors, these are the fruits of mis-spending our prime youth at the
schools and universities, as we do, either in learning mere words, or such
things chiefly as were better unlearned.

================

For Milton (and, I hope, for us) attendence at a university was neither
sufficient in itself nor absolutely necessary to a true education.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; One guide is to look at the competition.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; About the only 'topical allusion' Strats
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; find in the sonnets is the 'hate away' =
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 'Hathaway' pun of Sonnet 145. Apart
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; from being an appalling 'pun' in its own
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; right, it does not fit the grammar of the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; sonnet . . . nor any other aspect of it.

&gt;&gt;&quot;I hate&quot; from Hathaway(ie herself) she threw,
&gt;&gt; And saved my life saying &quot;not you&quot;.

&gt;&gt; As far as I can tell, there is
&gt;&gt; nothing ungrammatical about it.

&gt; Do you think a phrase can be thrown
&gt; from yourself? It's a stretch IMO.

"/>

Actually, I think &quot;I hate&quot; is supposed to
be more than just a phrase. I think it's
also intended to represent a state of
mind.

Here's the line again:

I hate, from hate away she threw,

What is it that you think she's throwing?
What do you think she's throwing it
away from?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Then we have the problem of how that reading leads into the next line.

"/>

Can't say that I see the problem.

In the first line(13), she rejects the
hate she was feeling before mercy
entered her heart. In the second(14),
she adds the two words that remove
the hurt, and so saves his life. It's
hyperbole, but so what?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Nor do I see any aspect to it
&gt;&gt; that doesn't fit in with the
&gt;&gt; rest of the sonnet. And I'm not
&gt;&gt; clear on what makes it a
&gt;&gt; particularly appalling pun.

&gt; Perhaps you'd like to explain the
&gt; meaning or the 'wit' of the pun. Is
&gt; there some interesting analogy or
&gt; parallel or striking contrast between
&gt; a 'hate away' and a 'Hathaway'? Or
&gt; does the switch from a phrase to a
&gt; person make it interesting in some
&gt; way?

"/>

I'm sure someone named Anne Hathaway would
find it very interesting. The rest
of us, I'm afraid, are not likely to have
the same sort of attachment.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Perhaps one way to look at it would
&gt; be to try to consider how (IF it were
&gt; truly present, and the Stratman had
&gt; been the poet) the illiterate Anne (as
&gt; wife or as the wooed lover) would
&gt; have seen it. She's had to have it
&gt; explained to her.

"/>

We know some people in Elizabethan times
could read but not write. Therefore, it
is not entirely safe to assume from Anne
Hathaway's mark that she could not read.

Disregarding that caveat, you seem to
have confused illiteracy with stupidity.

If Anne Hathaway was indeed illiterate,
she would have had to have it read to her,
but ears hear puns at least as well as
eyes see them.

FWIW, Gurr, I believe, said that in
16th century Warwickshire, 'Hathaway'
would have been pronounced 'hate away'.
If that is so, then I think the pun
would be that much harder to miss.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; So maybe you can
&gt; see yourself as the person doing
&gt; that?

"/>

Can you really see someone reciting
this poem to any reasonably intelligent
woman named Anne Hathaway and her not
getting it?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; If you were courting a woman with
&gt; the surname of 'Hathaway' (or even
&gt; with the Christian name 'Anne') would
&gt; you be tempted to recite this sonnet
&gt; to her ?

"/>

No doubt. And I'm fairly sure there
hasn't been a woman born with the name
of 'Hathaway' who wouldn't, at the very
least, find the pun entertaining the
first time she heard it.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Those lips that Loues owne hand did make,
&gt; breath'd forth the sound that said I hate,
&gt; To me that languisht for her sake:
&gt; But when she saw my wofull state,
&gt; Straight in her heart did mercie come,
&gt; Chiding that tongue that euer sweet,
&gt; Was vsde in giuing gentle dome:
&gt; And tought it thus a new to greete:
&gt; I hate she alterd with an end,
&gt; That follow'd it as gentle day,
&gt; Doth follow night who like a fiend
&gt; From heauen to hell is flowne away.
&gt; I hate, from hate away she threw,

"/>

If I reorder that last line into
the order that seems most natural,
I get:

&quot;She threw 'I hate' away from hate&quot;

The rhyme requires the moving of the
'she threw' to the end of the line
which(if rhyming had been Shakespeare's
only concern) would leave us with:

&quot;'I hate' away from hate she threw&quot;.

Unless my ear has gone completely
tin, the line above is metrically
sound. It also seems considerably
less awkward than the line we were
given. That awkwardness, I think
perhaps has something to do with
the extra work needed to parse
lines with unusual word order.

Would a really good poet make a
line harder to parse by accident?
I doubt it. I'm fairly sure there
was some thought behind the unusual
word order and as I said earlier,
I don't think the reason can have
to do with metrics. And it doesn't
seem to me that the unusual word
order does anything to make the
line more mellifluous.

So why'd he give it to us the way
he did? Did the pun dictate the
word order? It certainly seems
reasonable to suppose so.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; And sau'd my life saying not you.

"/>

If the Hathaway pun wasn't there, not
only would the 'And/Anne' pun be pretty
unrecognizable, there wouldn't be nearly
as much fun in it. (I don't think I'd
attempt this one on just anyone named
Anne.)

I didn't think it meant that. I thought &quot;learned&quot; simply meant &quot;learned&quot; in
the sense of &quot;erudition&quot;. In Shakespeare's case, he seems to
be saying that his work is &quot;natural&quot; or &quot;unlearned&quot; or &quot;non-erudite&quot;, and
by implication not university educated. In Shakespeare's lifetime there were
only two kinds of serious writers: the educated, like the University Wits,
or Jonson, who tried to make himself a University Wit, mostly by his own
effort,
and Shakespeare's type, who discarded the idea that literary works must
be full of learning. I think in his lifetime Shakespeare was the only example
of the latter kind, and I can't imagine how he could have written the same
kinds of plays if his education had been spent in a university rather than
on the stage itself, learning how to present action rather than the old
fashioned tableaux style. And it's those two choices that Milton is
contrasting in his poem.
In any case, I don't see anything in Milton's essay that contradicts my
interpretation, and secondly, even if there were, the essay was published
in 1673, and it says on the title page that it was written twenty years
earlier,
which would put it about 1653, about 20 years after the ~1631 L'Allegro.
I don't see how you can insist on the relation of a factual essay to an
expressive poem written 20 years earlier, especially when that poem
contains only the word &quot;learned&quot;, not a similar exposition on education.

How does this contradict what I've said about L'Allegro? In the poem
he is saying that Jonson's plays were learned, not how he came about
that learning, and that Shakespeare's plays were primarily the product of his
imagination and his &quot;native&quot; understanding, and he is obviously contrasting
the two.

Notice that Milton, who would have known of Jonson's learnedness
(perhaps, even, directly), isn't necessarily denying Shakespeare's own
learnedness, but is simply carrying on with what could be gathered of
the Shakspere of the London theater, part of which was that he was not
a university man. He was seen to be prolific, but his educational
background was unknown, so people simply chalked it all up to a
natural gift. However, Shakespeare the Author is full of learnedness.
He is a widely-read and erudite ---goddammit! I did it again!

I think Milton is being somewhat ambiguous with the warbling &quot;green
man&quot; line, but on the whole I think he is saying that Shakespeare is
extremely imaginative and natural and that Jonson is more--this is a
hard one--cerebral? intellectual? academic? The two writers are the
right and left brains of literature, you might say.

&gt;&gt; Thank you. I believe even I was clever enough to work that out for

&gt;&gt; Here are the lines from Milton's L'Allegro:

&gt;&gt;&gt; If Jonson's learned sock be on,
&gt;&gt;&gt; Or sweetest Shakespeare, fancy's child,
&gt;&gt;&gt; Warble his his native wood-notes wild,

&gt;&gt;&gt; Lap me in soft Lydian airs,

&gt;&gt;&gt; Such as the meeting soul may pierce
&gt;&gt;&gt; In notes, with many a winding bout
&gt;&gt;&gt; Of linked sweetness long drawn out,
&gt;&gt;&gt; With wanton heed, and giddy cunning,
&gt;&gt;&gt; The melting voice through mazes running;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Untwisting all the chains that tie
&gt;&gt;&gt; The hidden soul of harmony.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Notice that Milton draws a clear distinction between Jonson's
&gt;&gt;&gt; learning and Shakespeare's &quot;native&quot; talent.

&gt; Thanks for making my point, Jim. I didn't realize the Milton passage
&gt; was in L'Allegro.

&gt; If you can ever figure out what LynnE is trying to argue, let me know.

&gt;Date: 10/24/2003
&gt;&gt;&gt; Ok, sorry for the confusion. It didn't appear from your comments that
&gt;&gt;&gt; you accept that Milton is saying that Shakespeare had no formal higher
&gt;&gt;&gt; education, but now I see that you do.

&gt;&gt;I don't think Milton is denying that Shakespeare had a formal education or
&gt;&gt;asserting that Jonson had one. &quot;Jonson's learned sock&quot; is not the same as
&gt;&gt;&quot;Jonson's university-educated sock.&quot;

&gt;I didn't think it meant that. I thought &quot;learned&quot; simply meant &quot;learned&quot; in
&gt;the sense of &quot;erudition&quot;. In Shakespeare's case, he seems to
&gt;be saying that his work is &quot;natural&quot; or &quot;unlearned&quot; or &quot;non-erudite&quot;, and
&gt;by implication not university educated. In Shakespeare's lifetime there were
&gt;only two kinds of serious writers: the educated, like the University Wits,
&gt;or Jonson, who tried to make himself a University Wit, mostly by his own
&gt;effort,
&gt;and Shakespeare's type, who discarded the idea that literary works must
&gt;be full of learning. I think in his lifetime Shakespeare was the only example
&gt;of the latter kind...

"/>

Two kinds of serious writers: the educated and Shakespeare. I will make a note
of that.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;and I can't imagine how he could have written the same
&gt;kinds of plays if his education had been spent in a university rather than
&gt;on the stage itself, learning how to present action rather than the old
&gt;fashioned tableaux style. And it's those two choices that Milton is
&gt;contrasting in his poem.

Interesting stuff. Now, Jim, would you think de Vere spent more time around/in

OK, maybe it can be read in that way -- the

suspect that 'besides' is only rarely used
in its sense of 'exclude' -- and the rarity in
Shakespeare's case is irrelevant.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; What the OED says is that it means &quot;Other than, else
&gt; than: in negative and interrogative (formerly sometimes
&gt; in affirmative) sentences, capable of being rendered
&gt; 'except, excluding'.

"/>

That 'formerly' implies that 'besides' is not
used now in affirmative statements. Yet a
1758 statement is quoted: &quot;In the opinion
of everyone besides himself&quot;. There is
nothing obscure or obsolete about that
sentence to my ear -- even if 'except
himself' would be the standard usage.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; That Shakespeare gives not a single
&gt; example of such an affirmative use most probably
&gt; indicates that this usage was well out of fashion by
&gt; then.

"/>

If it's still in use now, so I can't see how it
ever 'went out of fashion'. Secondly, there
were many other writers on which to base
such a theory about usage. Thirdly, we
have to look at the context. How can we
say &quot;In the opinion of everybody in
addition to himself&quot;? This is what you
are suggesting. &quot;All the world in addition
to myself thinks you're dead&quot;.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Not that it really matters, since it is Shake-
&gt; speare's typical usage to which I am referring.

&gt; You are so firmly in my purpose bred
&gt; That all the world besides me thinkes y'are dead.

&gt; It is perfectly clear that the word 'besides', as used
&gt; here is a preposition.
&gt; I claim that he is (as I put it to Bob earlier) jokingly

I'm sure that you will accept that such a
claim is inherently far-fetched. I've asked
you several times to provide some
analogous situation we could recognise
-- and you've always ducked.

I really don't know what you are talking
about -- &quot;jokingly excusing his neglect of
the addressee with false logic&quot; and I am
sure that you don't either.

Could Prince Charles have sought to excuse
his neglect of Princess Diana with a similar
piece of 'false logic'?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; 1) (You are so much a part of me) that all the world must

&gt; 2) In other words: &quot;That all the world besides me thinkes

&gt; 3) Which also means &quot;That all the world (and me too) thinks
&gt; you are dead.

&gt; 4) And this explains why I have been neglecting you.

&gt; And, as I also said before, no other explanation makes
&gt; sense

"/>

Maybe, but yours makes none either. Would
Henry VIII have used such an excuse with
Anne Boleyn? Would Ulysses have said it
to Penelope? Would David Gest have said it
to Liza Minelli? If you can't put it into any
remotely recognisable human context, then
it does _not_ make sense.

Paul, to cut to the core, Shakespeare does not use &quot;besides&quot; the way
you want him to because (1) he never uses it that way AND (2) it makes
good sense used the way he always uses it, as &quot;as well.&quot; It is true
that a writer might use a word a hundred times one way, and once
another, but almost certainly not in a case in which the word seems to
most observers to be used the first way.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Ok, sorry for the confusion. It didn't appear from your comments that

&gt;&gt;I don't think Milton is denying that Shakespeare had a formal education or

&gt;&gt;&quot;Jonson's university-educated sock.&quot;

&gt; I didn't think it meant that. I thought &quot;learned&quot; simply meant &quot;learned&quot;
&gt; in the sense of &quot;erudition&quot;. In Shakespeare's case, he seems to be
&gt; saying that his work is &quot;natural&quot; or &quot;unlearned&quot; or &quot;non-erudite&quot;, and
&gt; by implication not university educated.

"/>

Milton did not equate a university education with erudition.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; In Shakespeare's lifetime there were only two kinds of serious writers:
&gt; the educated, like the University Wits, or Jonson, who tried to make
&gt; himself a University Wit, mostly by his own effort, and Shakespeare's
&gt; type, who discarded the idea that literary works must be full of
&gt; learning.

"/>

I don't know that Shakespeare tried to keep what learning he had out of
the plays -- quite the reverse, in fact: the plays are full of his
learning. He obviously read very widely, but most of what he read was not
the sort of thing that would have been part of any university curriculum
in his (or Milton's) day, just as Milton would not have read (or attended)
Jonson's and Shakespeare's plays as part of a classroom assignment, but
his familiarity with them is part of what he (and we) would consider his
education.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I think in his lifetime Shakespeare was the only example of the latter
&gt; kind, and I can't imagine how he could have written the same kinds of
&gt; plays if his education had been spent in a university rather than on the
&gt; stage itself, learning how to present action rather than the old
&gt; fashioned tableaux style.

"/>

Say, what? I must be missing something here, because you can't possibly
mean to suggest that all Elizabethan comedy other than Shakespeare was
done in &quot;the old fashioned tableaux style.&quot; Is that what you think of
*The Shoemaker's Holiday*? To take an old-fashioned play, is that what
you think of *Gammer Gurton's Needle*?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; And it's those two choices that Milton is contrasting in his poem.

"/>

Have you read Jonson's comedies? Do you think *Bartholomew Fair* or
*Epicoene* is presented in &quot;the old fashioned tableaux style&quot; (whatever
that may mean -- I'm not at all sure what non-Shakespearean comedies you
could have in mind).

Then to the well-trod stage anon,
If Jonsons learned Sock be on,
Or sweetest Shakespear fancies childe,
Warble his native Wood-notes wilde,

The contrast is not just between &quot;learned&quot; and &quot;wilde&quot; but metaphorically
between a comic actor (the &quot;sock&quot; is work not by the author of a comedy
but by the players) and a non-human performer, a bird of the woods (a
thrush, I imagine). The phrase &quot;learned sock&quot; is witty in the highest
sense, being funny, apt, and surprising. Milton, displaying some of the
erudition that he did NOT gain in a classroom, echoes the Shakespearean
phrase &quot;child of fancy.&quot;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; In any case, I don't see anything in Milton's essay that contradicts my
&gt; interpretation,

"/>

Then step back a bit, and consider whether the antistratfordian insistence
that the author of Shakespeare's works must have been a university man is
not merely misguided but would have appeared so in his own or in Milton's
time.

The antistratfordian argument seems to go something like this:

1. Shakespeare's works display an extraordinary erudition.
2. All university men were extraordinarily erudite.
3. Argal, Shakespeare must have been a university man.

There are many things wrong with this argument. First, even if the
premises were true, the conclusion does not follow from them (Shakespeare
might have been erudite without a university education). Second, the
terms are not used consistently. The &quot;extraordinary erudition&quot; one finds
in Shakespeare's plays could not be explained by a university education,
as most of the works that are generally considered his sources were not
part of the curriculum, and thus the word &quot;erudite&quot; in the second premise
refers to a different body of knowledge (albeit with some possible
overlap) from that which is suggested by &quot;erudition&quot; in the first.
Third, not every person who spent time in a university came out erudite
even in the things a university tried to teach. There are more things
wrong with the argument, but this should be enough for our purposes.

It is true that Shakespeare (like Kyd) was NOT considered extraordinarily
erudite in his time; he was sometimes mocked for his relative ignorance,
or his fans were for being so fond of his unworthy works. However, it is
also true that he somehow or other picked up quite a bit of book-learnin'
from somewhere (again, most of this could NOT have been part of a
university curriculum in his time). Shakespeare must have been a
voracious reader.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; and secondly, even if there were, the essay was published in 1673, and
&gt; it says on the title page that it was written twenty years earlier,
&gt; which would put it about 1653, about 20 years after the ~1631 L'Allegro.

"/>

&quot;Of Education&quot; was registered on June 5, 1644. &quot;L'Allegro&quot; was first
printed in 1645, but 1631 is a plausible guess for the date of its
composition.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I don't see how you can insist on the relation of a factual essay to an
&gt; expressive poem

"/>

Surely you could not have overlooked how &quot;expressive&quot; Milton's prose is.
Although he regarded his prose as the work of his &quot;left hand,&quot; his essays
should not be read as if they were some Grandgrinian exposition of mere
facts.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; written 20 years earlier, especially when that poem contains only the
&gt; word &quot;learned&quot;, not a similar exposition on education.

"/>

You seemed in danger of allowing yourself to appear to be buying the
antistratfordian assumption that anybody who spent time in a university
came out extraordinarily erudite, and perhaps also in danger of offering a
Shakespeare who was scarcely better than a Li'l Abner with a knack for
fine phrasing. Neither extreme seems to me either plausible or helpful,
and if I had my druthers, I'd have you consider the difference (for
Milton) between university attendance and true education. Milton
considered Spenser &quot;a better teacher than Scotus or Aquinas&quot; -- nobody
read Spenser as part of a university curriculum in his day (alas,
nowadays, nobody reads Spenser EXCEPT as part of a curriculum).

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; [snip]
&gt;&gt;For Milton (and, I hope, for us) attendance at a university was neither
&gt;&gt;sufficient in itself nor absolutely necessary to a true education.

&gt; How does this contradict what I've said about L'Allegro? In the poem he
&gt; is saying that Jonson's plays were learned, not how he came about that
&gt; learning, and that Shakespeare's plays were primarily the product of his
&gt; imagination and his &quot;native&quot; understanding, and he is obviously
&gt; contrasting the two.

"/>

Jonson's comedies and Shakespeare's are both delightful to l'Allegro. He
is not saying that Jonson entirely lacked invention or that Shakespeare
entirely lacked art. Part of the contrast is that there is a higher
proportion of verse in many of Shakespeare's comedies (the warbling of the
thrush).

It may be that there is also a sense that Jonson is a native of the
&quot;Towred Cities,&quot; fully at home among &quot;the busie humm of men&quot; while
Shakespeare came from a pastoral context (and perhaps from the
hinterlands) to warble on the &quot;well-trod stage.&quot; I don't think the poem's
&quot;upland Hamlets&quot; are a reference to Shakespeare (through Brome and Popova
would), but &quot;Faery Mab&quot; owes something both to Shakespeare and to Jonson.

I've always wanted to know why Milton used the word sock, and have

used &quot;sock&quot; in the sense of muse of comedy? Or the shoes that
classical comic actors wore? (both definitions from Webster's.)Given
those meanings, I think it could apply both to the author of a comedy

would like to hear more. By the way, it now occurs to me that in the

I think your syllogism is a bit scewy. I can't imagine that anyone
believes that all university men were extraordinarily erudite. Here's
my go at it:

A. Shakespeare's works display extraordinary erudition
B. Oxford was extraordinarily erudite
C. Argal, Shakespeare must be Oxford.

(This is a bit of a joke, people, before you all jump down my throat.
It's rather a small throat, and I barely have room for a mouse).

&quot;Argal,&quot; by the way, in Hamlet, appears to be part of a kind of
grave-digger travesty of a very interesting and rather obscure legal
argument used in a case of the time involving a suicide, as Bill
Causey explained to us at the conference and Thomas Regnier speaks of
in his article. I'm sure you've heard that, Terry, so forgive me for
speaking of it. It's for those who may not know.

I've quoted chapter and verse for the article in another post, but
would be glad to do so again here, should anyone want it.

Why have you suddenly narrowed Shakespeare's oevre to just comedy?
The old fashioned style of plays like &quot;Jocasta&quot; and &quot;Gorboduc&quot; had
actors primarily standing around making speeches, and most if not
all the action took place off-stage, which the characters then spoke
abou after the fact. Shakespeare (I believe, anyway) revolutionized the stage
with
plays like 1H6, where there is constant and vigorous action, as

&gt; and the players. But I'm not sure that's what you're getting at, and
&gt; would like to hear more. By the way, it now occurs to me that in the
&gt; old series *Laugh In*, the actors would yell: &quot;Sock it to me, baby!&quot;
&gt; and that might have a different meaning from the one I then imagined.

&gt;&gt; The antistratfordian argument seems to go something like this:

&gt;&gt; 1. Shakespeare's works display an extraordinary erudition.
&gt;&gt; 2. All university men were extraordinarily erudite.
&gt;&gt; 3. Argal, Shakespeare must have been a university man.

&gt; I think your syllogism is a bit scewy. I can't imagine that anyone
&gt; believes that all university men were extraordinarily erudite. Here's
&gt; my go at it:

&gt; A. Shakespeare's works display extraordinary erudition
&gt; B. Oxford was extraordinarily erudite
&gt; C. Argal, Shakespeare must be Oxford.

"/>

I think it more probably goes like this in reality, since most
antistratfordians can't discern what is erudite in the canon:

A. Shakespeare is studied in university.
B. Shakespeare must have attended university.
C. Oxford went to university and Shakespeare didn't.
D. Therefore, Oxford must be Shakespeare.

Only after the certainty that Oxford is Shakespeare sets in does the
antistratfordian look for a better syllogism, albeit based on a false
premise such as your example.

&gt; It's rather a small throat, and I barely have room for a mouse).

&gt;&quot;Argal,&quot; by the way, in Hamlet, appears to be part of a kind of
&gt; grave-digger travesty of a very interesting and rather obscure legal
&gt; argument used in a case of the time involving a suicide, as Bill
&gt; Causey explained to us at the conference and Thomas Regnier speaks of
&gt; in his article. I'm sure you've heard that, Terry, so forgive me for
&gt; speaking of it. It's for those who may not know.

&gt; I've quoted chapter and verse for the article in another post, but
&gt; would be glad to do so again here, should anyone want it.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I've been quite explicit, Agent Jim. I assumed Bob knew where

can

not

to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; reveal it before we're done. I was talking to Alan originally, and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; just mentioned it in passing.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; They're working to show that Milton's comments about Shakespeare
were

It will be interesting to see what you meant when you wrote: &quot;Wish I could

&gt;&gt; it, as &quot;as well.&quot; It is true that a writer might use a word
&gt;&gt; a hundred times one way, and once another, but almost
&gt;&gt; certainly not in a case in which the word seems to most
&gt;&gt; observers to be used the first way.

&gt; I have little argument with Strats here. Most
&gt; do not claim to understand this sonnet -- nor
&gt; the last line. Some put in their own appalling
&gt; 'improvements' -- but that's just routine Strat
&gt; idiocy.

&gt; 11. To cryttick and to flatterer stopped are:
&gt; 12. Marke how with my neglect I doe dispence.
&gt; 13. You are so strongly in my purpose bred,
&gt; 14. That all the world besides me thinkes y'are dead.

&gt; All the world, besides Peter, reads the 'besides' in
&gt; the last line as 'All the world EXCEPT me thinkes . . &quot;.

&gt; Uniquely, Peter want to read it as &quot;all the world
&gt; AS WELL AS me thinkes . . &quot;

&gt; He then 'justifies' his reading by claiming that
&gt; poet was &quot;jokingly excusing his neglect of the
&gt; addressee with false logic&quot;.

"/>

Doesn't it embarrass you to be forced into such a
blatant disregard of what I really said? I quite
clearly, and in considerable detail 'justified' my
reading by showing every single example I could find
of how Shakespeare used the word throughout his
career. (I could have done the same for Marlowe &amp;
Spenser with no different result, by the way). This,
together with the OED, showed that use of the word
'besides' to mean 'except' in this context would be
not only unique for Shakespeare, but would also be
most unusual at any time, and certainly unheard of
today.

I reason from this that Shakespeare did in fact
mean it to be read as &quot;as well as&quot;. Unfortunately
for Shakespearean scholars, however, this definition
leads to a meaning that makes no sense to them - that
the poet is thought to be dead. It does make sense
to me, of course.

Furthermore, this is not the only way in which that
interpretation is indicated.

1) The poet has already *said* in the same Sonnet
that he is &quot;to none alive&quot;.

2) He claims that the addressee is &quot;so strongly in
my purpose bred&quot; that everyone (...) thinks the
the addressee is dead. Why?

3) This one, i.e. that the addressee is thought dead
&quot;besides (= as well as) me&quot;.

It is, of course, evidence that the poet was thought
dead at the time, but as this does not fit anything
other than the Marlovian scenario, the evidence has
to be distorted in some way. I am not suggesting
they're being deceitful, by the way - just making an
honest attempt to fit it within a context that is
simply not able to accommodate it.

&gt; I've always wanted to know why Milton used the word sock, and have never

The &quot;sock&quot; is to be contrasted to the &quot;buskin.&quot; Greek and Roman actors
used different shoes for different types of plays. For comedy the
&quot;soccus&quot; (a low-heeled slipper); for tragedy the &quot;cothurnus,&quot; a
thick-soled boot. Soccus/cothurnus == sock/buskin. The same actor might
perform in comedies and tragedies, just as a single playwright might
produce both kinds of plays. Jonson is portrayed as a comic actor wearing
a sock -- we are not to assume that Aristophanes wrote while wearing socks
while Aeshcylus put on buskins before composing the *Agamemnon*. Both
Jonson and Shakespeare had been actors, and both are here presented as
performers, but understood as writers. Milton transfers the epithet
&quot;learned&quot; to Jonson's &quot;sock,&quot; and I hope I'm not the only one who finds
that amusing.

While l'Allegro is fond of comedy, il Penseroso prefers tragedy:

Som time let Gorgeous Tragedy
In Scepter'd Pall com sweeping by,
Presenting Thebs, or Pelops line,
Or the tale of Troy divine.
Or what (though rare) of later age,
Ennobled hath the Buskind stage.

While l'Allegro prefers the comedies of Jonson and Shakespeare, il
Penseroso prefers classical tragedy for the most part, with the rare
modern exception (no author is named).

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&quot;Sock&quot; strictly speaking applies to the player; metaphorically to the
author (just as Shakespeare's warbling strictly speaking applies to a
performing thrush and metaphorically to the author). In &quot;il Penseroso&quot; it
is the stage itself that is &quot;Buskind&quot; -- of course one did not signify a
tragedy by placing the entire stage in a gigantic boot; the stage is
&quot;buskind&quot; because a tragedy is performed there; if a comedy were being
played, the stage would &quot;wear&quot; a sock.

Thus one and the same stage can sometimes hold a comedy, and sometimes a
tragedy; the same actor may today appear in a comedy and tomorrow in a
tragedy; the same playwright may at one time compose a comedy and at
another a tragedy. The same reader or playgoer may in a Penseroso mood
prefer tragedy and in an Allegro mood prefer comedy.

But Terry makes a good point, whether or not you find it &quot;helpful.&quot;
I know of no evidence that Oxford had a keen legal mind. Nor do I know
of any indication of Oxford's supposed erudition (unless one supposes at
the outset that he wrote the Shakespeare canon). Finally, I know of no
evidence that Oxford was an accomplished prose stylist. His letters do
not suggest as much. His verse is, as Terry noted, that of a minor
court poet, capable of occasional felicities, but also of monstrosities
like the rhythmically plodding and relentlessly alliterative

Fain would I sing but fury makes me fret,
And rage hath sworn to seek revenge of wrong;
My mazed mind in malice is so set,
As death shall daunt my deadly dolours long;
Patience perforce is such a pinching pain,
[...]

or his wretched, extended metaphor of love as a tennis game.

So tell me, Lynne, what IS the evidence, if any, of Oxford's legal
mind? What IS the evidence, if any, for his supposedly extraordinary
erudition? What IS the evidence, if any, that Oxford was either an
accomplished prose stylist or a poet of genius? Note that I am not
asserting that YOU have necessarily claimed that Oxford was erudite,
that he had a keen legal mind, or that he was a magisterial prose
stylist or poet, but one hears these assertions so routinely from
Oxfordians that I am curious whether you concur with of the Oxfordian
&quot;search-and-replace&quot; adaptations of old Baconian arguments to which
Terry alludes above.

David:

I know of no evidence that Shakespeare of Stratford had a keen legal
mind. Nor do I know of any indication of Shakespeare's supposed
erudition (unless one supposes at the outset that he wrote the
Shakespeare canon). Finally, I know of no evidence that Shakespeare
was an accomplished prose stylist. His letters (which are
non-existent) do not suggest as much. Here is an example of his verse:

To be a little more serious, but very hasty:

We have some evidence of Oxford's legal mind, apart from the fact he
attended Gray's Inn. See Regnier's article ((University of Miami Law
Review, Volume 57, Number 2, January 2003). The plays require legal
knowledge and an ability to read legal documents in the original
language as some of them weren't translated, and Oxford had that
ability. To my knowledge, no one except Twain has suggested that
Shakespeare had to be the greatest legal mind of his era, and I've
often heard Stratfordians say it wasn't necessary to have any
specialised legal knowledge--don't agree with this, by the way--so I
think the article I've given will suffice. One can't have it both
ways, saying that Shakespeare didn't need special legal training
because Shakespeare of Stratford couldn't have had any, and then
asking me to prove Oxford was the greatest legal mind of his time.

Stephanie Hopkins Hughes' B.A. thesis is to my mind the best source
for Oxford's education. It was written while she was at Concordia in
Portland, and shows that Oxford was tutored by some of the finest
minds in the country. You might try to access it.

There is much evidence for his extraordinary erudition. Lawrence
Nowell, his tutor for a short time when Oxford was just entering his
teens, says: &quot;I clearly see that my work for the Earl of Oxford can
not be much longer required.&quot; Oxford's first (extant) letter, written
at fourteen, is in French. Burleigh (letter to Rutland) writes: &quot;And
for my own part, I find that whereof I take comfort in his wit and
knowledge grown by good observation.&quot; These are all examples taken
from *Monstrous Adversary*, by the way. There are many more. Nelson, a
Stratfordian, also says earlier in the book: &quot;Golding attributes to
his nephew, now fourteen, an interest in ancient history and current
events&quot; when he dedicates his translation of *Thabridgment of the
Histories of Trogus Pompeius* to him.&quot; I can go on for months. I can
find better stuff if I look. I just found these by flicking through a
book which isn't even Oxfordian. Would you like more?

For a discussion of prose style with particular reference to the
letter of September 1572 to Burghley, please see Dr. Stritmatter's PhD
dissertation, Appendix N, and tell me what you see there that shows
Oxford to be a poor prose writer. You might also look at Fowler's
*Shakespeare Revealed in Oxford's Letters.&quot; I might add here that
writing business letters usually casts little light on how good a
playwright or author one is, but I think the particular letter that
Stritmatter chooses shows a similarity of style to that of
Shakespeare.

Oxford wasn't a good poet? The example you give appears to be
juvenilia. Have you seen Jane Austen's juvenilia? It's dreadful. Even
writers have to serve an apprenticeship. What about looking at the
following instead:

IF WOMEN COULD BE FAIR AND YET NOT FOND

IF women could be fair and yet not fond,
Or that their love were firm, not fickle still,
I would not marvel that they make men bond
By service long to purchase their good will ;
But when I see how frail those creatures are,
I laugh that men forget themselves so far.

To mark the choice they make, and how they change,
How oft from Phoebus do they flee to Pan ;
Unsettled still, like haggards wild they range,
These gentle birds that fly from man to man ;
Who would not scorn and shake them from the fist,
And let them fly, fair fools, which way they list ?

Yet for our sport we fawn and flatter both,
To pass the time when nothing else can please,
And train them to our lure with subtle oath,
Till, weary of their wiles, ourselves we ease ;
And then we say when we their fancy try,
To play with fools, O what a fool was I !

Stephen May, a Stratfordian, has also attributed the following poem to
Oxford (It was formerly attributed to Dyer, though I understand it was
considered anon till the middle eighteen hundreds. Changes in
attribution are not that uncommon. The Trumpet Voluntary was said to
be written by Purcell until twenty or thirty years ago. It's now
accepted to be by Jeremiah Clarke):

MY MIND TO ME A KINGDOM IS

MY mind to me a kingdom is;
Such present joys therein I find,
That it excels all other bliss
That earth affords or grows by kind:
Though much I want that most would have,
Yet still my mind forbids to crave.

No princely pomp, no wealthy store,
No force to win the victory,
No wily wit to salve a sore,
No shape to feed a loving eye;
To none of these I yield as thrall;
For why? my mind doth serve for all.

I see how plenty surfeits oft,
And hasty climbers soon do fall;
I see that those which are aloft
Mishap doth threaten most of all:
They get with toil, they keep with fear:
Such cares my mind could never bear.

Content I live, this is my stay;
I seek no more than may suffice;
I press to bear no haughty sway;
Look, what I lack my mind supplies.
Lo, thus I triumph like a king,
Content with that my mind doth bring.

Some have too much, yet still do crave;
I little have, and seek no more.
They are but poor, though much they have,
And I am rich with little store;
They poor, I rich; they beg, I give;
They lack, I leave; they pine, I live.

I laugh not at another's loss,
I grudge not at another's gain;
No worldly waves my mind can toss;
My state at one doth still remain:
I fear no foe, I fawn no friend;
I loathe not life, nor dread my end.

Some weigh their pleasure by their lust,
Their wisdom by their rage of will;
Their treasure is their only trust,
A cloakèd craft their store of skill;
But all the pleasure that I find
Is to maintain a quiet mind.

My wealth is health and perfect ease,
My conscience clear my chief defence;
I neither seek by bribes to please,
Nor by deceit to breed offence:
Thus do I live; thus will I die;
Would all did so as well as I!

This is one of the most enduring and popular poems in the English
language. It is also, imo, a fine piece of work though not as good as
some of his later sonnets. Sorry, couldn't resist that. :)

Respectfully submitted,
Lynne

&gt;&gt; I didn't think it meant that. I thought &quot;learned&quot; simply meant &quot;learned&quot;

&gt;&gt; saying that his work is &quot;natural&quot; or &quot;unlearned&quot; or &quot;non-erudite&quot;, and
&gt;&gt; by implication not university educated.

"/>

Ross:

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Milton did not equate a university education with erudition.

"/>

Heh, heh. This is ALL I could ask for: another exchange on what
constitutes erudition. One MUST wonder why it's such a touchy topic
and the only answer is to be found in the context. No one claims that
Shakspere was a University man and, so, he must be, to the orthodox,
an auto-didact. Shakespeare, on the other hand, was obviously erudite,
but it's the WRONG PEOPLE who make that claim. Why can't the orthodox
agree that the Author was well-read? Well, because it conflicts with
the earliest remarks about his &quot;natural wit&quot; and &quot;artlessness&quot; and so
forth. Even though even a cursory glance at the sources for
Shakespeare's plays will reveal someone who read a lot (in other
langauges, too!), it cannot be admitted. After all, these plays were
tossed-off patch-jobs: where's the benefit in resorting to erudition?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; In Shakespeare's lifetime there were only two kinds of serious writers:
&gt;&gt; the educated, like the University Wits, or Jonson, who tried to make
&gt;&gt; himself a University Wit, mostly by his own effort, and Shakespeare's
&gt;&gt; type, who discarded the idea that literary works must be full of
&gt;&gt; learning.

&gt; I don't know that Shakespeare tried to keep what learning he had out of
&gt; the plays -- quite the reverse, in fact: the plays are full of his
&gt; learning. He obviously read very widely, but most of what he read was not
&gt; the sort of thing that would have been part of any university curriculum
&gt; in his (or Milton's) day, just as Milton would not have read (or attended)
&gt; Jonson's and Shakespeare's plays as part of a classroom assignment, but
&gt; his familiarity with them is part of what he (and we) would consider his
&gt; education.

"/>

I'm sure you're right about the curricula, but how does being &quot;very
widely&quot; read and writing plays &quot;full of his learning&quot; qualify him for
the back-handed charges of artlessness and being naturally witty? The
Author was, I hope it can be admitted, fluent in Latin (based on the
very obvious etymological awareness in his English) and French, if not
Italian (based on the languages of his sourceworks). He wasn't reading
pulp fiction, exactly, even if it wasn't properly a part of any
University curriculum.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; I think in his lifetime Shakespeare was the only example of the latter

See how an imperfect biography drives interpretation?

I was reading some essays by a guy named Jan Kott lately and he
reminded me of something that I enjoyed in Ogburn: Shakespeare was
probably never very fond of the limitations of the stage. He wrote
with a cinematic eye. His plays were not practically situated or timed
and, thus, were often cut up for the stage.

&gt; Say, what? I must be missing something here, because you can't possibly

&gt; you think of *Gammer Gurton's Needle*?

&gt;&gt; And it's those two choices that Milton is contrasting in his poem.

I think Milton is just echoing what he had heard. There's no need to
suppose that he regarded Shakespeare (relative to Jonson) as some sort
of preternatural freak or fluke. Besides, don't we have to wait on
Coleridge before we get to the level of fancy-pants literary criticism
expected here?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Have you read Jonson's comedies? Do you think *Bartholomew Fair* or

&gt; could have in mind).

&gt; Then to the well-trod stage anon,
&gt; If Jonsons learned Sock be on,

&gt; but by the players) and a non-human performer, a bird of the woods (a
&gt; thrush, I imagine). The phrase &quot;learned sock&quot; is witty in the highest
&gt; sense, being funny, apt, and surprising. Milton, displaying some of the
&gt; erudition that he did NOT gain in a classroom, echoes the Shakespearean
&gt; phrase &quot;child of fancy.&quot;

It's good to note that you consider a faculty for comedic dissonance
evidence of erudition.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; In any case, I don't see anything in Milton's essay that contradicts my
&gt;&gt; interpretation,

&gt; Then step back a bit, and consider whether the antistratfordian insistence
&gt; that the author of Shakespeare's works must have been a university man is
&gt; not merely misguided but would have appeared so in his own or in Milton's
&gt; time.

"/>

Do Anti-Stratfordians insist on that? Maybe. I know they expect the
Author to have been well-educated, both formally and experientially.
Either way, it leaves Shakspere out of the picture. Even if you give
the guy a formal education up to about the age of 12 and the ability
to read, where is the evidence or even the motivation for him to have
gone off and invested as much of himself in the old R &amp; D as we should
expect of the Author? There's no books or paper trails or stories of
time spent in some great patron's library.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; The antistratfordian argument seems to go something like this:

&gt; 1. Shakespeare's works display an extraordinary erudition.
&gt; 2. All university men were extraordinarily erudite.
&gt; 3. Argal, Shakespeare must have been a university man.

&gt; There are many things wrong with this argument. First, even if the
&gt; premises were true, the conclusion does not follow from them (Shakespeare
&gt; might have been erudite without a university education).

"/>

True, but without evidence of his autodidactism, too?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Second, the
&gt; terms are not used consistently. The &quot;extraordinary erudition&quot; one finds
&gt; in Shakespeare's plays could not be explained by a university education,
&gt; as most of the works that are generally considered his sources were not
&gt; part of the curriculum, and thus the word &quot;erudite&quot; in the second premise
&gt; refers to a different body of knowledge (albeit with some possible
&gt; overlap) from that which is suggested by &quot;erudition&quot; in the first.

"/>

I will defer to you on the question of the curriculum, so long as the
Author still gets to be erudite in some sense.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Indeed.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; There are more things
&gt; wrong with the argument, but this should be enough for our purposes.

&gt; It is true that Shakespeare (like Kyd) was NOT considered extraordinarily
&gt; erudite in his time; he was sometimes mocked for his relative ignorance,
&gt; or his fans were for being so fond of his unworthy works. However, it is
&gt; also true that he somehow or other picked up quite a bit of book-learnin'
&gt; from somewhere (again, most of this could NOT have been part of a
&gt; university curriculum in his time). Shakespeare must have been a
&gt; voracious reader.

"/>

If so, it is especially incredible that he left behind no books. (And
the chattel and other goods argument or the missing inventory thang is
still quite lame, thank you.)

&lt;snip&gt;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; [snip]
&gt;&gt;&gt;For Milton (and, I hope, for us) attendance at a university was neither
&gt;&gt;&gt;sufficient in itself nor absolutely necessary to a true education.

&gt;&gt; How does this contradict what I've said about L'Allegro? In the poem he
&gt;&gt; is saying that Jonson's plays were learned, not how he came about that
&gt;&gt; learning, and that Shakespeare's plays were primarily the product of his
&gt;&gt; imagination and his &quot;native&quot; understanding, and he is obviously
&gt;&gt; contrasting the two.

&gt; Jonson's comedies and Shakespeare's are both delightful to l'Allegro. He
&gt; is not saying that Jonson entirely lacked invention or that Shakespeare
&gt; entirely lacked art. Part of the contrast is that there is a higher
&gt; proportion of verse in many of Shakespeare's comedies (the warbling of the
&gt; thrush).

&gt; It may be that there is also a sense that Jonson is a native of the
&gt;&quot;Towred Cities,&quot; fully at home among &quot;the busie humm of men&quot; while
&gt; Shakespeare came from a pastoral context (and perhaps from the
&gt; hinterlands) to warble on the &quot;well-trod stage.&quot;

"/>

I agree with this. And it doesn't change the fact that people thought
Shakspere was Shakespeare from the country.

Nonsense. There can't be more than one or two Shakespeare-deniers who

No, Toby, he was not erudite in the way most people think of being
erudite. He was a sloppy thinker whose knowledge is clearly absorbed
rather than memorized, impressionistic rather than exact, life-based
rather than book-based. . . .

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; but it's the WRONG PEOPLE who make that claim. Why can't the orthodox
&gt; agree that the Author was well-read?

"/>

Very few don't believe Shakespeare read a lot. But he does not seem
to have read systematically.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Well, because it conflicts with
&gt; the earliest remarks about his &quot;natural wit&quot; and &quot;artlessness&quot; and so
&gt; forth. Even though even a cursory glance at the sources for
&gt; Shakespeare's plays will reveal someone who read a lot (in other
&gt; langauges, too!), it cannot be admitted. After all, these plays were
&gt; tossed-off patch-jobs: where's the benefit in resorting to erudition?

&gt;&gt;&gt; In Shakespeare's lifetime there were only two kinds of serious writers:
&gt;&gt;&gt; the educated, like the University Wits, or Jonson, who tried to make
&gt;&gt;&gt; himself a University Wit, mostly by his own effort, and Shakespeare's
&gt;&gt;&gt; type, who discarded the idea that literary works must be full of
&gt;&gt;&gt; learning.

&gt;&gt; I don't know that Shakespeare tried to keep what learning he had out of
&gt;&gt; the plays -- quite the reverse, in fact: the plays are full of his
&gt;&gt; learning. He obviously read very widely, but most of what he read was not
&gt;&gt; the sort of thing that would have been part of any university curriculum
&gt;&gt; in his (or Milton's) day, just as Milton would not have read (or attended)
&gt;&gt; Jonson's and Shakespeare's plays as part of a classroom assignment, but
&gt;&gt; his familiarity with them is part of what he (and we) would consider his
&gt;&gt; education.

&gt; I'm sure you're right about the curricula, but how does being &quot;very
&gt; widely&quot; read and writing plays &quot;full of his learning&quot; qualify him for
&gt; the back-handed charges of artlessness and being naturally witty? The
&gt; Author was, I hope it can be admitted, fluent in Latin (based on the
&gt; very obvious etymological awareness in his English)

"/>

Baloney. He uses Latin in his plays. That's what shows that he had
some familiarity with the language. That he often used words derived
from Latin, or made up words based on Latin only indicates he knew his
own language. Your use above of the word &quot;curricula&quot; does not
indicate you've had any Latin, only that you know the English word,
&quot;curricula.&quot; My coinage of the word,
&quot;pseudosopher,&quot; does not show I know a damned thing about Greek, only
that I know the meanings in English of &quot;pseudo&quot; and &quot;sopher.&quot; That I
indicate here that I know the latter two come from Greek is because I
learned from English texts that certain prefixes and suffixes have.
The only way you can plausibly show that a given writer knows a given
language other than his own is from an original translation of his
from the given language, or his use of the given language in a
reasonably lengthy, original passage. You can't deduce it from your
belief in his &quot;etymological awareness&quot; of that language.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; and French, if not
&gt; Italian (based on the languages of his sourceworks). He wasn't reading
&gt; pulp fiction, exactly, even if it wasn't properly a part of any
&gt; University curriculum.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I think in his lifetime Shakespeare was the only example of the latter
&gt;&gt;&gt; kind, and I can't imagine how he could have written the same kinds of
&gt;&gt;&gt; plays if his education had been spent in a university rather than on the
&gt;&gt;&gt; stage itself, learning how to present action rather than the old

Baloney. Anyone guessing at the workings of another's mind will be
wrong at tiems due to lack of biographical information no matter how
detailedly that other has been written of. Oxford-backers make
similar guesses about Oxford--and about Shakespeare (who loaned money
at least twice so could not have had the exalted kind of soul that a
play like Lear could have issued from, for example).

So one would hope, but such is not always the case, even today. I quoted
at some length Milton's discussion of the problems with education in his
time. Milton complains about &quot;the fruits of mis-spending our prime youth
at the schools and universities, as we do, either in learning mere words,
or such things chiefly as were better unlearned.&quot;

You may not be very familiar with Jonson's comedy, or with

Because comedy is what &quot;l'Allegro&quot; is talking about in the passage we have

prefers tragedy. It is in &quot;l'Allegro&quot; that we find these lines:

while it is in &quot;il Penseroso&quot; that we find these:

Presenting Thebs, or Pelops line,
Or the tale of Troy divine.
Or what (though rare) of later age,
Ennobled hath the Buskind stage.

&quot;Jonson's learned sock&quot; is not a reference to *Sejanus* or *Cataline* but
to Jonson's comedies (not that any characters in those tragedies speak
&quot;extended quotes in Latin from the classics&quot; -- *Sejanus* and *Cataline*
are written in English).

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; The old fashioned style of plays like &quot;Jocasta&quot; and &quot;Gorboduc&quot;

"/>

Neither *Jocasta* nor *Gorboduc* was a comedy; those plays would have been
performed on the &quot;Buskind stage&quot; that Penseroso favored, though I doubt he
would have included them among the &quot;rare&quot; plays of a later age that ranked
with the finest Greek tragedies. *Jocasta* is an English translation of
an Italian version of a Latin version of a play by Euripides, so in some
ways it is extremely old-fashioned, but it was very modern in its day.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; had actors primarily standing around making speeches,

"/>

A great many plays, even today, consist primarily of actors &quot;making
speeches.&quot; Similarly, a great many operas consist primarily of performers
standing around singing. Sure, there is a bit of sitting or walking or
lying once in a while, and sometimes characters are flown in, but &quot;making
speeches&quot; (or singing) may still turn out to be a large part of the show.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; and most if not all the action took place off-stage, which the
&gt; characters then spoke abou after the fact.

"/>

Every act of *Jocasta* and *Gorboduc* began with a dumb show. Here is the
dumb show for act 5 of *Gorboduc*:

First the Drums and Flutes, began to sound, during which there came forth
upon the Stage a company of Harquebusiers and of Armed men all in order of
Battle. These after their Pieces discharged, and that the Armed men had
three times marched about the Stage, departed, and then the Drums and
Flutes did cease. Hereby was signified tumults, rebellions, Arms, and
civil wars to follow, as fell in the Realm of great Britain, which by the
space of fifty years and more continued in civil war between the Nobility
after the Death of king Gorboduc, and of his Issues, for want of certain
limitation in the Succession of the Crown, till the time of Dunwallo
Molmutius, who reduced the Land to Monarchy

During the dumb shows, none of the actors stood around making speeches.

Some very important things happen even when the actors DO stand around
making speeches. *Gorboduc* is one of those plays in which a king divides
his kingdom. Of course, being a play, we can't really SEE the actual
kingdom being divided; instead we have actors standing around making
speeches about dividing the kingdom, just as we have in *King Lear*.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Shakespeare (I believe, anyway) revolutionized the stage with plays like
&gt; 1H6, where there is constant and vigorous action, as well as dramatic
&gt; argument *on the stage itself*, and other playwrights like Marlowe,
&gt; Greene, Peele and others tried to imitate him.

I tend to believe that Shakespeare was open to influence (why should he
have been different from everybody else in that regard?).

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; Is that what you think of *The Shoemaker's Holiday*? To take an
&gt;&gt; old-fashioned play, is that what you think of *Gammer Gurton's
&gt;&gt; Needle*?

&gt; I don't know *Needle*, but I was talking about plays before Shakespeare
&gt; came on the scene.

"/>

Many collections of pre-Shakespearean Tudor plays include *Gammer Gurton's
Needle* and *Ralph Royster Doyster*, neither of which matches your
description. I'm guessing you haven't read many non-Shakespearean
comedies.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;&gt; And it's those two choices that Milton is contrasting in his poem.

&gt;&gt; Have you read Jonson's comedies? Do you think *Bartholomew Fair* or
&gt;&gt; *Epicoene* is presented in &quot;the old fashioned tableaux style&quot;
&gt;&gt; (whatever that may mean -- I'm not at all sure what non-Shakespearean
&gt;&gt; comedies you could have in mind).

&gt; No, he learned from Shakespeare, his senior.

"/>

Does this contradict what you said earlier? You seemed to league Jonson
with the stand-around-making-speeches brand of dramatist. Your Jonson is
the fellow who fills his English plays with Latin dialogue. The actual Ben
Jonson learned some of what NOT to do from Shakespeare. Here is his
prologue to *Every Man In His Humor*:

THough Need make many Poets, and some such
As Art and Nature have not better'd much;
Yet ours, for want, hath not so lov'd the Stage,
As he dare serve th'ill Customs of the Age,
Or purchase your delight at such a rate,
As, for it, he himself must justly hate:
To make a child now swadled, to proceed
Man, and then shoot up in one beard and weed,
Past threescore years: or, with three rusty swords,
And help of some few foot-and-half-foot words,
Fight over York, and Lancasters long jars,
And in the Tyring house bring wounds to scars.
He rather prays, you will be pleas'd to see
One such to day, as other plays should be;
Where neither Chorus wafts you o're the seas,
Nor creaking Throne comes down, the boys to please;
Nor nimble Squib is seen, to make afeard
The Gentlewomen; nor roul'd Bullet heard
To say, it Thunders; nor tempestuous Drum
Rumbles, to tell you when the Storm doth come;
But Deeds, and Language, such as men do use:
And Persons, such as Comoedy would chuse,
When she would shew an Image of the Times,
And sport with Humane Follies, not with Crimes.
Except, we make 'em such by loving still
Our popular Errors, when we know th' are ill.
I mean such Errors as you'll all confess
By laughing at them, they deserve no less:
Which when you heartily do, there's hope left, then,
You, that have so grac'd Monsters, may like Men.

Shakespeare's plays are popular, but Jonson offers an example of what he
thinks plays SHOULD be. Is it significant that Jonson in 1616 would
complain thus about Shakespearean drama (yet even here he writes of

&gt;Heh, heh. This is ALL I could ask for: another exchange on what

&gt;and the only answer is to be found in the context. No one claims that
&gt;Shakspere was a University man and, so, he must be, to the orthodox,
&gt;an auto-didact. Shakespeare, on the other hand, was obviously erudite,

"/>

If he was, it was not the sort of erudition that Jonson displayed.
Shakespeare's
knowledge of literature in English was great, but he made little attempt
to translate the classics of Greek and Latin directly, as Jonson did, and
his use of Latin in his plays is meagre.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;but it's the WRONG PEOPLE who make that claim. Why can't the orthodox
&gt;agree that the Author was well-read? Well, because it conflicts with
&gt;the earliest remarks about his &quot;natural wit&quot; and &quot;artlessness&quot; and so
&gt;forth. Even though even a cursory glance at the sources for
&gt;Shakespeare's plays will reveal someone who read a lot (in other
&gt;langauges, too!), it cannot be admitted. After all, these plays were
&gt;tossed-off patch-jobs: where's the benefit in resorting to erudition?

"/>

You don't seem to understand the difference between auto-didactism
and formal education.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt; In Shakespeare's lifetime there were only two kinds of serious writers:
&gt;&gt;&gt; the educated, like the University Wits, or Jonson, who tried to make
&gt;&gt;&gt; himself a University Wit, mostly by his own effort, and Shakespeare's
&gt;&gt;&gt; type, who discarded the idea that literary works must be full of
&gt;&gt;&gt; learning.

&gt;&gt; I don't know that Shakespeare tried to keep what learning he had out of
&gt;&gt; the plays -- quite the reverse, in fact: the plays are full of his
&gt;&gt; learning. He obviously read very widely, but most of what he read was not
&gt;&gt; the sort of thing that would have been part of any university curriculum
&gt;&gt; in his (or Milton's) day, just as Milton would not have read (or attended)
&gt;&gt; Jonson's and Shakespeare's plays as part of a classroom assignment, but
&gt;&gt; his familiarity with them is part of what he (and we) would consider his
&gt;&gt; education.

&gt;I'm sure you're right about the curricula, but how does being &quot;very
&gt;widely&quot; read and writing plays &quot;full of his learning&quot; qualify him for
&gt;the back-handed charges of artlessness and being naturally witty?

"/>

What backhanded charge of artlessness? Milton said he &quot;warbled
his wood-notes wild&quot;, implying that his talent and his knowledge were
acquired &quot;naturally&quot;, i.e., self-taught, rather than through formal
university education.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;The
&gt;Author was, I hope it can be admitted, fluent in Latin (based on the
&gt;very obvious etymological awareness in his English)

That's nonsense. The English language is naturally full of words with
Latinate roots. If he were fluent in Latin, you would expect the kinds
of direct translations and quotes in Latin itself of the kind found
in Jonson's work.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;and French, if not
&gt;Italian (based on the languages of his sourceworks). He wasn't reading

There is nothing to indicate that he was fluent in either French or Italian.
There are 2 or 3 partial sources in French and Italian for which no
English translations are known to exist, but that hardly demonstrates
his fluency in those languages. It's more likely he had someone else do
the translating for him.

&gt;&gt; interpretation is indicated.

&gt;&gt; 1) The poet has already *said* in the same Sonnet
&gt;&gt; that he is &quot;to none alive&quot;.

&gt;&gt; 2) He claims that the addressee is &quot;so strongly in

&gt;&gt; 3) This one, i.e. that the addressee is thought dead

&gt; Then, for the next step, you find some points that will
&gt; additionally indicate support in the text for what you
&gt; are saying Shakespeare intentionally put there.

It would not cross the mind of any Shakespearean scholars

&gt;&gt;&gt;Milton did not equate a university education with erudition.

&gt;&gt; How could that be possible?

&gt;Please take another look at what Milton said.

"/>

Milton nowhere says that a university education cannot under
any circumstances be equated with erudition. All he says is
that sometimes those who are university educated do not
acquire erudition.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Erudition certainly must be one of the qualities imparted by a
&gt;&gt; university education.

&gt;So one would hope, but such is not always the case, even today. I quoted
&gt;at some length Milton's discussion of the problems with education in his
&gt;time. Milton complains about &quot;the fruits of mis-spending our prime youth
&gt;at the schools and universities, as we do, either in learning mere words,
&gt;or such things chiefly as were better unlearned.&quot;

"/>

What does this have to do with Jonson's erudition?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; In Shakespeare's lifetime there were only two kinds of serious writers:
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the educated, like the University Wits, or Jonson, who tried to make
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; himself a University Wit, mostly by his own effort, and Shakespeare's
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; type, who discarded the idea that literary works must be full of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; learning.

&gt;&gt;&gt;I don't know that Shakespeare tried to keep what learning he had out of
&gt;&gt;&gt;the plays -- quite the reverse, in fact: the plays are full of his
&gt;&gt;&gt;learning.

&gt;&gt; His plays are not full of the kind of learning that Jonson displays in
&gt;&gt; *his* plays: extended quotes in Latin from the classics, adaptions by
&gt;&gt; nearly literal translation from classical writers. That's all I'm
&gt;&gt; talking about here and don't understand this hair splitting that you are
&gt;&gt; engaging in. I think everyone can agree that Shakespeare was well-read
&gt;&gt; in English.

&gt;You may not be very familiar with Jonson's comedy, or with
&gt;non-Shakespearean comedy from the period. Do you find &quot;extended quotes in
&gt;Latin from the classics&quot; in *Volpone*? Is *The Alchemist* a &quot;nearly
&gt;literal translation from classical writers&quot;?

"/>

Jonson drops quite a bit of Latin in his comedies. I started a compilation
of his use of Latin for another argument here but gave it up because there
was so much of it. Here is what I got out of Bartholomew Fair:

2.4
If I can, with this daies travell, and all my policy, but rescue
this youth, here, out of the hands of the lewd man, and the
strange woman. I will sit downe at night, and say with my
friend Ovid, Iamq; opus exegi, quod nec Jovis ira, nec ignis, Etc

3.2
Nor the Piper of the Parish (Ut parvis componere magna solebam)
to put up his pipes, for one rainy Sunday.

4.6
I do not feele it, I do not thinke of it, it is a thing without me.
Adam, thou art aboue these Battries, these contumelies. In te
manca ruit fortuna, as thy friend Horace saies; thou art one,
Quem neque pauperies, neque mors, neque vincula terrent. And
therefore as another friend of thine saies, (I thinke it be thy friend
Persius) Non te quæsiveris extra.

5.6
If this graue Matron be your mother, Sir, stand by her,
Et digito compesco labellum, I may perhaps spring a wife for you,
anon.

5.6
Is she your wife? Redde te Harpocratem!

5.6
I invite you home, with me to my house, to supper:
I will have none feare to go along, for my intents are
Ad correctionem non ad destructionem; Ad ædificandum,
non ad diruendum: so lead on.

Jonson quotes Horace, Ovid, Virgil, Persius and Juvenal and
supplies his own Latin lines as well (Redde te Harpocratem!)
and also supplies a few two-word Latin phrases (Ursa Major,
Actum Est), all within a single play. There is nothing like this
extensive use of Latin in Shakespeare. Love's Labour's Lost
has the most, but the use of Latin there consists mostly
of single words, not phrases or lines, spoken by the pedant
Holofernes.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;He obviously read very widely, but most of what he read was not
&gt;&gt;&gt;the sort of thing that would have been part of any university curriculum
&gt;&gt;&gt;in his (or Milton's) day, just as Milton would not have read (or attended)
&gt;&gt;&gt;Jonson's and Shakespeare's plays as part of a classroom assignment, but
&gt;&gt;&gt;his familiarity with them is part of what he (and we) would consider his
&gt;&gt;&gt;education.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I think in his lifetime Shakespeare was the only example of the latter
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; kind, and I can't imagine how he could have written the same kinds of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; plays if his education had been spent in a university rather than on the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; stage itself, learning how to present action rather than the old
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; fashioned tableaux style.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Say, what? I must be missing something here, because you can't possibly
&gt;&gt;&gt;mean to suggest that all Elizabethan comedy other than Shakespeare was
&gt;&gt;&gt;done in &quot;the old fashioned tableaux style.&quot;

&gt;&gt; Why have you suddenly narrowed Shakespeare's oevre to just comedy?

&gt;Because comedy is what &quot;l'Allegro&quot; is talking about in the passage we have
&gt;been discussing. Milton's Allegro likes comedy; Milton's Penseroso
&gt;prefers tragedy. It is in &quot;l'Allegro&quot; that we find these lines:

&gt; Then to the well-trod stage anon,
&gt; If Jonsons learned Sock be on,
&gt; Or sweetest Shakespear fancies childe,
&gt; Warble his native Wood-notes wilde,

&gt;while it is in &quot;il Penseroso&quot; that we find these:

&gt; Som time let Gorgeous Tragedy
&gt; In Scepter'd Pall com sweeping by,
&gt; Presenting Thebs, or Pelops line,
&gt; Or the tale of Troy divine.
&gt; Or what (though rare) of later age,
&gt; Ennobled hath the Buskind stage.

&gt;&quot;Jonson's learned sock&quot; is not a reference to *Sejanus* or *Cataline* but
&gt;to Jonson's comedies (not that any characters in those tragedies speak
&gt;&quot;extended quotes in Latin from the classics&quot; -- *Sejanus* and *Cataline*
&gt;are written in English).

"/>

Yes, I know that the poem refers to Jonson's comedies, but there is
nothing to imply that the speaker is referring to Shakespeare's comedies.
&quot;Warble his wood-notes wild&quot; sounds to me like he is referring to any
lyric passage in any Shakespearean play, for example Clarence's
speech at the beginning of 1.4 of R3, or the passage in Titus where
Titus says &quot;For now I stand as one upon a rock/ Environ'd with a wilderness
of sea&quot; etc. &quot;Warble his wood-notes wild&quot; seems like an odd
description of &quot;The Comedy of Errors&quot; or &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot;,
or &quot;Love's Labor's Lost&quot;.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; The old fashioned style of plays like &quot;Jocasta&quot; and &quot;Gorboduc&quot;

&gt;Neither *Jocasta* nor *Gorboduc* was a comedy; those plays would have been
&gt;performed on the &quot;Buskind stage&quot; that Penseroso favored, though I doubt he
&gt;would have included them among the &quot;rare&quot; plays of a later age that ranked
&gt;with the finest Greek tragedies. *Jocasta* is an English translation of
&gt;an Italian version of a Latin version of a play by Euripides, so in some
&gt;ways it is extremely old-fashioned, but it was very modern in its day.

&gt;&gt; had actors primarily standing around making speeches,

&gt;A great many plays, even today, consist primarily of actors &quot;making
&gt;speeches.&quot;

"/>

Yes, yes, yes, but that was not the end of my sentence.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Similarly, a great many operas consist primarily of performers
&gt;standing around singing. Sure, there is a bit of sitting or walking or
&gt;lying once in a while, and sometimes characters are flown in, but &quot;making
&gt;speeches&quot; (or singing) may still turn out to be a large part of the show.

&gt;&gt; and most if not all the action took place off-stage, which the
&gt;&gt; characters then spoke abou after the fact.

&gt;Every act of *Jocasta* and *Gorboduc* began with a dumb show. Here is the
&gt;dumb show for act 5 of *Gorboduc*:

&gt;First the Drums and Flutes, began to sound, during which there came forth
&gt;upon the Stage a company of Harquebusiers and of Armed men all in order of
&gt;Battle. These after their Pieces discharged, and that the Armed men had
&gt;three times marched about the Stage, departed, and then the Drums and
&gt;Flutes did cease. Hereby was signified tumults, rebellions, Arms, and
&gt;civil wars to follow, as fell in the Realm of great Britain, which by the
&gt;space of fifty years and more continued in civil war between the Nobility
&gt;after the Death of king Gorboduc, and of his Issues, for want of certain
&gt;limitation in the Succession of the Crown, till the time of Dunwallo
&gt;Molmutius, who reduced the Land to Monarchy

&gt;During the dumb shows, none of the actors stood around making speeches.

&gt;Some very important things happen even when the actors DO stand around
&gt;making speeches. *Gorboduc* is one of those plays in which a king divides
&gt;his kingdom. Of course, being a play, we can't really SEE the actual
&gt;kingdom being divided; instead we have actors standing around making
&gt;speeches about dividing the kingdom, just as we have in *King Lear*.

"/>

In &quot;King Lear&quot;, people have their eyes poked out on stage. In the
dumb show which introduces act 4 of &quot;Gorboduc&quot;, it is explained that Porrex
will be slain by his own mother, and Gorboduc and his queen Videnia
will be killed by their own subjects. But none of these things happen
in act 4, only a lot of talk, and then Act 5 ...

Fluency in other languages does not necessarily make their use in an

&gt; There are 2 or 3 partial sources in French and Italian for which no

Right. There he is, in his cups, at a tavern, as sure as the world
that the plot or some theme or character for his next play is to be
found in some literary work that he can't even read. Fine. It just
came up in conversation and he simply has to have it in English. And,

Fine, take it up with the OED. They are always on the
look out for changed usages, and will no doubt be
delighted to hear from you. Make sure you eliminate
all of the examples within negative and interrogative
sentences, however, which you failed to do this time.

Why you should imagine for a moment that the way the
word is used on the internet these days (especially
given the appalling standard of English of much that
is posted there) is incomprehensible, however.

What IS of relevance is, of course, how the word was
used at that time, mainly by Shakespeare himself, but
also by his contemporaries, as you suggested.

Looking at that, we have seen that Shakespeare used
the word on 108 other occasions, none of which had
meaning 'except' as a preposition in an affirmative
sentence. Here are the results for him and those
examples I have managed to find for some of his
contemporaries:

Shakespeare 108 (0)
Spenser 40 (0)
Marlowe 24 (0)
Bacon (Essays) 21 (0)
The Bible (KJ) 16 (0)
Kyd 5 (0)
Dekker 3 (0)
Daniel 1 (0)
Constable 1 (0)

I think therefore that we can safely say that such a
usage would have been extremely rare, even unheard of,
at the time, and that by far the most likely meaning
intended for the word 'besides' in the last line of
Sonnet 112 has to be &quot;as well as&quot;.

Whether this means &quot;as well as all the world&quot; or
&quot;dead as well as me&quot; is up to the commentator to
decide, but I do not think that changing the meaning
of the word from &quot;as well as&quot; to &quot;except&quot; is really
an acceptable option.

I disagree. If you were to read some of the more erudite posts I've
made here (tee hee), you could probably deduce that I was, at least at
one point, essentially fluent in Latin. That's a relative claim (and
not one I'd press beyond its context), but there can be no doubt that
my own present command of the English language remains deeply rooted
in my early experience with Latin and Spanish both.

The bottom line is that you don't want Shakspere to have had to have
mastered Shakespeare's degree of Latin fluency because it's a hassle.
Takes too much energy to defend and/or justify, so you just water it
down.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I think in his lifetime Shakespeare was the only example of the latter

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; plays if his education had been spent in a university rather than on the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; stage itself, learning how to present action rather than the old

I'm not going to guess at what you're [saying], but let's be clear:
Carroll is passing a rather large stone here. He is saying he can't
conceive of a University-educated Shakespeare. He can ONLY conceive of
a Shakespeare whose most relevant and important schooling came by
experience on the stage, where he learned to write SPECIFICALLY for
the stage and for its particular requirements. Are you telling me that
such an opinion was not first formed in the knowledge that Shakspere,
in fact, lacked such an education? Many scholars would disagree with
Jim's beliefs and say that, at times, Shakespeare's plays seem more
suited to a later age of presentation (e.g., cinema or television).
They would point out the impracticalities of staging some of
Shakespeare's plays (i.e., Birnham woods coming to Dunsinane would be
an interesting sight to see). Maybe some plays ARE too long or too
thickly populated or whatever.

What is there about Oxford that would disqualify him from being the

&gt;&gt; with a cinematic eye. His plays were not practically situated or timed
&gt;&gt; and, thus, were often cut up for the stage.

&gt; Right, he was one of us. All bardolators come up with baloney like

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; And it's those two choices that Milton is contrasting in his poem.

&gt;&gt; I think Milton is just echoing what he had heard. There's no need to

&gt;&gt; Coleridge before we get to the level of fancy-pants literary criticism

The OED is far from infallible. Its error here
may be merely a typo -- i.e. the inclusion of
the word 'formerly'. That word suggests that
around 1900, when the OED being compiled the
editor was under the impression that this sense
was no longer in use. If so, that was clearly a
false impression -- or, perhaps, was a rule only
maintained in writing. The meanings of basic

None of us has the least problem with the
phrase 'everybody besides me' (meaning
'everybody except me') including you --

special manner.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; What IS of relevance is, of course, how the word was

&gt; Looking at that, we have seen that Shakespeare used
&gt; the word on 108 other occasions, none of which had

You are tackling the issue in a completely
nonsensical manner. The phrase you need
to focus on is 'everybody besides me' (and
possibly 'everybody besides you / him / her
/ us / them'). Such a phrase is only going
to be used in particular circumstances:
i.e. in some kind of personal confession or
accusatory context. So you're unlikely to
find it in the Bible or in a set of essays.

We'll get it much more in direct speech, and
not in discursive texts which -- with their
enormous bias towards such texts -- is
almost certainly why the OED went wrong
(if we assume that their 'formerly' is not just
a typo).

However, no native English speaker has the
slightest difficulty in understanding phrases
like 'all the world besides me' or 'everybody
besides me' -- that is: everybody besides
Peter Farey (who is only pretending).

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; by implication not university educated.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Milton did not equate a university education with erudition.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Heh, heh. This is ALL I could ask for: another exchange on what

&gt;&gt;&gt;Shakspere was a University man and, so, he must be, to the orthodox,
&gt;&gt;&gt;an auto-didact. Shakespeare, on the other hand, was obviously erudite,

&gt;KQKnave:

&gt;&gt; If he was, it was not the sort of erudition that Jonson displayed.

&gt;Great. I just KNEW there had to be more levels of erudition than the

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; but he made little attempt

&gt;We now know that your definition of erudition contains the ability to
&gt;translate Classical languages. Okay. And this is a greater type of
&gt;erudition than Shakespeare's, which merely manifested itself in an
&gt;unprecedentedly expansive and inventive use of the English language
&gt;---and which counts as a reason why Jonson today is read by grad
&gt;students and Shakespeare is read by kids in inner- city middle

&gt;&gt;&gt;forth. Even though even a cursory glance at the sources for
&gt;&gt;&gt;Shakespeare's plays will reveal someone who read a lot (in other

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; In Shakespeare's lifetime there were only two kinds of serious
&gt;writers:
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the educated, like the University Wits, or Jonson, who tried to make
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; himself a University Wit, mostly by his own effort, and Shakespeare's
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; type, who discarded the idea that literary works must be full of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; learning.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I don't know that Shakespeare tried to keep what learning he had out of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the plays -- quite the reverse, in fact: the plays are full of his
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; learning. He obviously read very widely, but most of what he read was
&gt;not
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the sort of thing that would have been part of any university curriculum
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in his (or Milton's) day, just as Milton would not have read (or
&gt;attended)
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Jonson's and Shakespeare's plays as part of a classroom assignment, but
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; his familiarity with them is part of what he (and we) would consider his
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; education.

&gt;&gt;&gt;I'm sure you're right about the curricula, but how does being &quot;very
&gt;&gt;&gt;widely&quot; read and writing plays &quot;full of his learning&quot; qualify him for
&gt;&gt;&gt;the back-handed charges of artlessness and being naturally witty?

&gt;&gt; What backhanded charge of artlessness? Milton said he &quot;warbled
&gt;&gt; his wood-notes wild&quot;, implying that his talent and his knowledge were
&gt;&gt; acquired &quot;naturally&quot;, i.e., self-taught, rather than through formal
&gt;&gt; university education.

&gt;I prefer to believe that such characterizations were the consequence
&gt;of following Jonson's lead too much and not of any kind of worthwhile
&gt;analysis. Unless you're saying that Milton's knowledge of
&gt;Shakespeare's biography was derived from internal/textual clues.
&gt;Hmmm... Didn't know that was permissible.

&gt;&gt;&gt;The
&gt;&gt;&gt;Author was, I hope it can be admitted, fluent in Latin (based on the
&gt;&gt;&gt;very obvious etymological awareness in his English)

&gt;&gt; That's nonsense. The English language is naturally full of words with
&gt;&gt; Latinate roots.

&gt;Which, believe it or not, is not equivalent to the sort of
&gt;etymological awareness that Shakespeare had. Shakespeare knew his
&gt;roots and was able to come up with great puns and associations that
&gt;would never occur to lesser writers.

That's just nonsense.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; If he were fluent in Latin, you would expect the kinds

&gt;English-language play relevant or appropriate. If Shakespeare had
&gt;written with that attitude of ostentatiousness, his dramatic appeal
&gt;would have smothered itself in its own cradle, rather than continue to

&gt;Right. There he is, in his cups, at a tavern, as sure as the world

&gt;himself.

It may very well have come up in conversation. The inns where plays
were staged were frequented by educated men. One such man,
John Manningham, noted a performance of Twelfth Night in his
diary. Not only did he say that it was like the play Menachmi by
Plautus, but also that it was like a play in Italian called Ingani.
If he knew these things, I don't see why they couldn't have found
their way to Shakespeare, especially if Shakespeare actively
sought plots. But by far the most likely sources are simply
either English translations that have been lost, or English
adaptions in the form of plays that were lost. If you want
to see how many and varied his sources could be, read Bullough's
discussion of the sources of Merchant of Venice.
It's not as if there are many sources of his plays that can
only be found in French or Italian. There are just a couple,
and since the majority of his sources were in English, that
makes much more sense.

&gt;&gt;while it is in &quot;il Penseroso&quot; that we find these:

&gt;&gt; Som time let Gorgeous Tragedy
&gt;&gt; In Scepter'd Pall com sweeping by,
&gt;&gt; Presenting Thebs, or Pelops line,
&gt;&gt; Or the tale of Troy divine.
&gt;&gt; Or what (though rare) of later age,
&gt;&gt; Ennobled hath the Buskind stage.

&gt;&gt;&quot;Jonson's learned sock&quot; is not a reference to *Sejanus* or *Cataline*
&gt;&gt;but to Jonson's comedies (not that any characters in those tragedies
&gt;&gt;speak &quot;extended quotes in Latin from the classics&quot; -- *Sejanus* and
&gt;&gt;*Cataline* are written in English).

&gt; Yes, I know that the poem refers to Jonson's comedies, but there is
&gt; nothing to imply that the speaker is referring to Shakespeare's
&gt; comedies.

"/>

Nothing except the fact that, as Terry noted above, the speaker in
&quot;L'Allegro&quot; likes comedies, and the speaker in &quot;Il Penseroso&quot; likes
tragedies. Thus, if the reference to Shakespeare is from &quot;L'Allegro,&quot;
we may safely assume the reference is to comedies.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&quot;Warble his wood-notes wild&quot; sounds to me like he is referring to any
&gt; lyric passage in any Shakespearean play, for example Clarence's speech
&gt; at the beginning of 1.4 of R3, or the passage in Titus where Titus
&gt; says &quot;For now I stand as one upon a rock/ Environ'd with a wilderness
&gt; of sea&quot; etc. &quot;Warble his wood-notes wild&quot; seems like an odd
&gt; description of &quot;The Comedy of Errors&quot; or &quot;The Merchant of
&gt; Venice&quot;, or &quot;Love's Labor's Lost&quot;.

"/>

On the other hand, it's a plausible characterization of the pastoral
comedy &quot;As You Like It,&quot; which fits nicely with overall pastoral feel of
&quot;L'Allegro&quot; and the specific reference to Hymen, who does in fact appear
onstage at the end of &quot;As You Like It.&quot;&quot;A Midsummer Night's Dream&quot;
also fits, given Milton's allusions to English fairy-lore. It seems
highly unlikely that a poem which begins by banishing &quot;loathed
Melancholy&quot; would invite the reader to imagine an audience delighted by
the Lydian airs of &quot;Richard III&quot; or &quot;Titus Andronicus.&quot;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;I may have. I now think you misunderstand Milton's views on
&gt;&gt;universities and Allegro's taste for comedy, but I had earlier assumed
&gt;&gt;that you probably understood them, and based on that assumption, I
&gt;&gt;misunderstood what you were saying.

&gt; Actually I think it is you have misunderstood Milton's poetic
&gt; expression in L'Allegro because you seem to think it has something to
&gt; do with an essay primarily directed at the education of barristers and
&gt; politicians that he wrote much later.

"/>

Terry thinks that we may get some insight into Milton's use of the word
&quot;learned&quot; in &quot;L'Allegro&quot; by studying what Milton had to say about
learning. That looks like a plausible claim to me.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; And I don't think Milton was thinking specifically thinking of
&gt; Shakespeare's comedies, only Shakespeare as pleasant entertainment,
&gt; either complete comedies, or pleasing excerpts from other plays.

"/>

There's no support for that reading in the poem. Given that &quot;L'Allegro&quot;
and &quot;Il Penseroso&quot; are paired poems, and that one focuses on the light,
comic side of life and the other on the melancholy, tragic sense of
life, and that &quot;Il Penseroso&quot; contains lines in praise of tragic drama,
it makes no sense to imagine that Milton was referring to anything *but*
Shakespeare's comedies in &quot;L'Allegro.&quot;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;A comic playwright doesn't need to put on socks in order to write a
&gt;&gt;comedy, but classical actors wore &quot;socks&quot; (actually low slippers) and
&gt;&gt;buskins (high-heeled boots) for tragedy. &quot;If Jonson's learned sock be
&gt;&gt;on&quot; suggests that Jonson is a sock-wearing actor, but of course refers
&gt;&gt;to him as an author of comedy. The comic playwright Shakespeare is
&gt;&gt;also described as a performer, but not an actor. What kind of creature

&gt;&gt; 1. warbles
&gt;&gt; 2. is native to the woods
&gt;&gt; 3. is wild

&gt;&gt;-- a bird, obviously, and I think probably a thrush of some kind.

&gt;&gt;Thus Allegro describes BOTH of his favorite comic playwrights as
&gt;&gt;performers.

&gt; Doubt it. He describes Jonson *metaphorically* as an actor.
&gt;&quot;If Jonson's learned sock be on&quot;-----&gt;&quot;If a learned comic play
&gt; by Jonson is on the stage&quot;. And he doesn't describe Shakespeare
&gt; as an actor at all, only metaphorically as a bird with a pleasing
&gt; song. (And why couldn't it be a nightingale Milton had in mind, if
&gt; indeed he had any specific bird in mind when he came up with
&gt; that line?)

"/>

As Terry pointed out in another post, the nightingale shows up in &quot;Il
Penseroso,&quot; where its presence makes sense, the nightingale being a bird
associated with tragedy and melancholy since the days of the ancient
Greeks.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Most Oxfordian arguments begin as Baconian arguments to which a

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; pretty good case can be made for Bacon's extraordinary erudition, the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Oxfordian case has to be dummed down a bit, as fits the candidate.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Thus
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Mark Twain could speak of the &quot;real author&quot; as having had the greatest
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; legal mind of his era, which might describe Bacon, but is just silly
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; when
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; applied to Oxford. For Oxford the argument is reduced to &quot;attended
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Gray's
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; inn for a bit,&quot; which translates to &quot;must have picked up SOMETHING of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; law.&quot; Similarly, Bacon's actual writings reveal a brilliant thinker
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and accomplished prose stylist; Oxford's actual writings are
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; negligible,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; revealing a minor poet capapable of the occasional good line.
&gt;&gt;&gt; This, of course, isn't so helpful. ;)
&gt;&gt; But Terry makes a good point, whether or not you find it &quot;helpful.&quot;
&gt;&gt; I know of no evidence that Oxford had a keen legal mind. Nor do I know
&gt;&gt; of any indication of Oxford's supposed erudition (unless one supposes at
&gt;&gt; the outset that he wrote the Shakespeare canon). Finally, I know of no
&gt;&gt; evidence that Oxford was an accomplished prose stylist. His letters do
&gt;&gt; not suggest as much. His verse is, as Terry noted, that of a minor
&gt;&gt; court poet, capable of occasional felicities, but also of monstrosities
&gt;&gt; like the rhythmically plodding and relentlessly alliterative

&gt;&gt; Fain would I sing but fury makes me fret,
&gt;&gt; And rage hath sworn to seek revenge of wrong;
&gt;&gt; My mazed mind in malice is so set,
&gt;&gt; As death shall daunt my deadly dolours long;
&gt;&gt; Patience perforce is such a pinching pain,
&gt;&gt; [...]

&gt;&gt; or his wretched, extended metaphor of love as a tennis game.

&gt;&gt; So tell me, Lynne, what IS the evidence, if any, of Oxford's legal
&gt;&gt; mind? What IS the evidence, if any, for his supposedly extraordinary
&gt;&gt; erudition? What IS the evidence, if any, that Oxford was either an
&gt;&gt; accomplished prose stylist or a poet of genius? Note that I am not
&gt;&gt; asserting that YOU have necessarily claimed that Oxford was erudite,
&gt;&gt; that he had a keen legal mind, or that he was a magisterial prose
&gt;&gt; stylist or poet, but one hears these assertions so routinely from
&gt;&gt; Oxfordians that I am curious whether you concur with of the Oxfordian
&gt;&gt;&quot;search-and-replace&quot; adaptations of old Baconian arguments to which

&gt; We have some evidence of Oxford's legal mind, apart from the fact he
&gt; attended Gray's Inn. See Regnier's article ((University of Miami Law
&gt; Review, Volume 57, Number 2, January 2003). The plays require legal
&gt; knowledge and an ability to read legal documents in the original
&gt; language as some of them weren't translated, and Oxford had that
&gt; ability. To my knowledge, no one except Twain has suggested that
&gt; Shakespeare had to be the greatest legal mind of his era, and I've
&gt; often heard Stratfordians say it wasn't necessary to have any
&gt; specialised legal knowledge--don't agree with this, by the way--so I
&gt; think the article I've given will suffice. One can't have it both
&gt; ways, saying that Shakespeare didn't need special legal training
&gt; because Shakespeare of Stratford couldn't have had any, and then
&gt; asking me to prove Oxford was the greatest legal mind of his time.

I agree, and I don't think that the plays require specialized legal
training, merely an acquaintance with the law. As far as I am aware,
only anti-Stratfordians make the author of the canon a formidable legal
scholar.

I would regard that as evidence that his education was progressing
satisfactorily, not as evidence of any extraordinary erudition. Indeed,
formidable erudition was not required of someone of Oxford's station, so
his educational attainments need not have been anything particularly out
of the ordinary to have been regarded as satisfactory by either his
tutor or his guardian. He may well have exceeded what was expected of
him, but if so I would scarcely call him erudite.

&gt;&gt; Oxfordians do, now that Alan Nelson and others have shown that he
&gt;&gt; barely attended any university.

&gt; I'm about twenty pages into Nelson right now and all I can remember is
&gt; him begging my pardon for being so hostile to his subject. Interesting
&gt; approach. *Cough*

&gt;&gt;&gt; and, so, he must be, to the orthodox,
&gt;&gt;&gt; an auto-didact. Shakespeare, on the other hand, was obviously erudite,

&gt;&gt; No, Toby, he was not erudite in the way most people think of being
&gt;&gt; erudite.
&gt; Yesss! (Marv Albert style) You have no idea how much fun this is,

&gt; now, it's coming through again ---and I wanna pull a full-on Casey
&gt; Jones, man! Ha, ha, ha!
&gt;&gt; He was a sloppy thinker whose knowledge is clearly absorbed
&gt;&gt; rather than memorized, impressionistic rather than exact, life-based
&gt;&gt; rather than book-based. . . .

&gt; Just so that everyone will know it for sure, that was BOB saying that,
&gt; folks. Surely you're not going to sit back and let him have his way
&gt; with the Shanxphirr's memory that way, are you?
&gt;&gt;&gt; but it's the WRONG PEOPLE who make that claim. Why can't the orthodox
&gt;&gt;&gt; agree that the Author was well-read?

&gt;&gt; Very few don't believe Shakespeare read a lot. But he does not seem
&gt;&gt; to have read systematically.

&gt; This is cheese and I'm a rat. What other explanation could there be?

&gt;&gt;&gt; Well, because it conflicts with
&gt;&gt;&gt; the earliest remarks about his &quot;natural wit&quot; and &quot;artlessness&quot; and so
&gt;&gt;&gt; forth. Even though even a cursory glance at the sources for
&gt;&gt;&gt; Shakespeare's plays will reveal someone who read a lot (in other
&gt;&gt;&gt; lang[ua]ges, too!), it cannot be admitted. After all, these plays were
&gt;&gt;&gt; tossed-off patch-jobs: where's the benefit in resorting to erudition?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; In Shakespeare's lifetime there were only two kinds of serious writers:
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the educated, like the University Wits, or Jonson, who tried to make
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; himself a University Wit, mostly by his own effort, and Shakespeare's
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; type, who discarded the idea that literary works must be full of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; learning.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I don't know that Shakespeare tried to keep what learning he had out of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the plays -- quite the reverse, in fact: the plays are full of his
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; learning. He obviously read very widely, but most of what he read was not
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the sort of thing that would have been part of any university curriculum
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in his (or Milton's) day, just as Milton would not have read (or attended)
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Jonson's and Shakespeare's plays as part of a classroom assignment, but
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; his familiarity with them is part of what he (and we) would consider his
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; education.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I'm sure you're right about the curricula, but how does being &quot;very
&gt;&gt;&gt; widely&quot; read and writing plays &quot;full of his learning&quot; qualify him for
&gt;&gt;&gt; the back-handed charges of artlessness and being naturally witty? The
&gt;&gt;&gt; Author was, I hope it can be admitted, fluent in Latin (based on the
&gt;&gt;&gt; very obvious etymological awareness in his English)

&gt;&gt; Baloney. He uses Latin in his plays. That's what shows that he had
&gt;&gt; some familiarity with the language. That he often used words derived
&gt;&gt; from Latin, or made up words based on Latin only indicates he knew his
&gt;&gt; own language.

&gt; I say it goes deeper. I say he's etymologically aware enough to pull
&gt; off puns and make associations that would never have occurred to
&gt; others. Why would you deny him fluency in Latin? There can only be one
&gt; reason: it's more weight than you want your mule to bear.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Because comedy is what &quot;l'Allegro&quot; is talking about in the passage we
&gt;&gt;&gt;have been discussing. Milton's Allegro likes comedy; Milton's
&gt;&gt;&gt;Penseroso prefers tragedy. It is in &quot;l'Allegro&quot; that we find these
&gt;&gt;&gt;lines:

&gt;&gt;&gt; Then to the well-trod stage anon,
&gt;&gt;&gt; If Jonsons learned Sock be on,
&gt;&gt;&gt; Or sweetest Shakespear fancies childe,
&gt;&gt;&gt; Warble his native Wood-notes wilde,

&gt;&gt;&gt;while it is in &quot;il Penseroso&quot; that we find these:

&gt;&gt;&gt; Som time let Gorgeous Tragedy
&gt;&gt;&gt; In Scepter'd Pall com sweeping by,
&gt;&gt;&gt; Presenting Thebs, or Pelops line,
&gt;&gt;&gt; Or the tale of Troy divine.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Or what (though rare) of later age,
&gt;&gt;&gt; Ennobled hath the Buskind stage.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;Jonson's learned sock&quot; is not a reference to *Sejanus* or *Cataline*
&gt;&gt;&gt;but to Jonson's comedies (not that any characters in those tragedies
&gt;&gt;&gt;speak &quot;extended quotes in Latin from the classics&quot; -- *Sejanus* and
&gt;&gt;&gt;*Cataline* are written in English).

&gt;&gt; Yes, I know that the poem refers to Jonson's comedies, but there is
&gt;&gt; nothing to imply that the speaker is referring to Shakespeare's
&gt;&gt; comedies.

&gt;Nothing except the fact that, as Terry noted above, the speaker in
&gt;&quot;L'Allegro&quot; likes comedies, and the speaker in &quot;Il Penseroso&quot; likes
&gt;tragedies. Thus, if the reference to Shakespeare is from &quot;L'Allegro,&quot;
&gt;we may safely assume the reference is to comedies.

"/>

I wouldn't assume any such thing. The reference is to pleasant
entertainments, nothing more is specified. You and Ross are trying
to turn these poems into cartoons to suit your interpretation of
those two lines. Neither L'Allegro nor Il Penseroso is so one
dimensional. L'Allegro begins with

&quot;Hence loathed Melancholy
Of Cerberus, and blackest midnight born,
In Stygian Cave forlorn
'Mongst horrid shapes, and shreiks, and sights unholy,
Find out some uncouth cell,
Where brooding darkness spreads his jealous wings,
And the night-Raven sings;
There under Ebon shades, and low-brow'd Rocks,
As ragged as thy Locks,
In dark Cimmerian desert ever dwell.&quot;

No comedies there. And later

&quot;Mountains on whose barren brest
The laboring clouds do often rest.&quot;

No comedies there either. Or

&quot;How Faery Mab the junkets eat,
She was pincht, and pull'd she said,
And he by Friars Lanthorn led
Tells how the drudging Goblin sweat,
To earn his Cream-bowl duly set&quot;

And Il Penseroso is not unrelievedly dark:

&quot;Thus night oft see me in thy pale career,
Till civil-suited morn appear,
Not tricked and frounced as she was wont,
With the Attick boy to hunt,
But kerchiefed in a comely cloud,
While rocking winds are piping loud,
Or ushered with a shower still,
When the gust hath blown his fill,
Ending on the russling leaves,
With minute drops from off the eaves.&quot;

and especially

&quot;There in close covert by some brook,
Where no profaner eye may look,
Hide me from day's garish eee,
While the bee with honied thigh,
That at her flowery work doth sing,
And the waters murmuring
With such consort as they keep,
Entice the dewy-feather'd sleep;
And let some strange mysterious dream,
Wave at his wings in airy stream,
Of lively portraiture displayed,
Softly on my eye-lids laid.
And as I wake, sweet music breath
Above, about, or underneath,
Sent by some spirit to mortals good,
Or th' unseen Genius of the wood.&quot;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&quot;Warble his wood-notes wild&quot; sounds to me like he is referring to any
&gt;&gt; lyric passage in any Shakespearean play, for example Clarence's speech
&gt;&gt; at the beginning of 1.4 of R3, or the passage in Titus where Titus
&gt;&gt; says &quot;For now I stand as one upon a rock/ Environ'd with a wilderness
&gt;&gt; of sea&quot; etc. &quot;Warble his wood-notes wild&quot; seems like an odd
&gt;&gt; description of &quot;The Comedy of Errors&quot; or &quot;The Merchant of
&gt;&gt; Venice&quot;, or &quot;Love's Labor's Lost&quot;.

&gt;On the other hand, it's a plausible characterization of the pastoral
&gt;comedy &quot;As You Like It,&quot; which fits nicely with overall pastoral feel of
&gt;&quot;L'Allegro&quot; and the specific reference to Hymen, who does in fact appear
&gt;onstage at the end of &quot;As You Like It.&quot;

"/>

There are references to lots of things in the poem, most of which
don't appear in Shakespeare.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&quot;A Midsummer Night's Dream&quot;
&gt;also fits, given Milton's allusions to English fairy-lore. It seems
&gt;highly unlikely that a poem which begins by banishing &quot;loathed
&gt;Melancholy&quot; would invite the reader to imagine an audience delighted by
&gt;the Lydian airs of &quot;Richard III&quot; or &quot;Titus Andronicus.&quot;

"/>

But that's not my point. I don't think he meant the whole of those plays
either. Milton was referring to the lyric nature of the verse in Shakespeare,
not specific plays.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;[snip]
&gt;&gt;&gt;I may have. I now think you misunderstand Milton's views on
&gt;&gt;&gt;universities and Allegro's taste for comedy, but I had earlier assumed
&gt;&gt;&gt;that you probably understood them, and based on that assumption, I
&gt;&gt;&gt;misunderstood what you were saying.

&gt;&gt; Actually I think it is you have misunderstood Milton's poetic
&gt;&gt; expression in L'Allegro because you seem to think it has something to
&gt;&gt; do with an essay primarily directed at the education of barristers and
&gt;&gt; politicians that he wrote much later.

&gt;Terry thinks that we may get some insight into Milton's use of the word
&gt;&quot;learned&quot; in &quot;L'Allegro&quot; by studying what Milton had to say about
&gt;learning. That looks like a plausible claim to me.

"/>

It would be if L'Allegro were an essay concerning education,
or a speech by character on eduction, but we are talking about
one word in a three-line reference to playwrights. Milton
no doubt had something specific in mind when he used
the word &quot;learned&quot; in reference to Jonson, and you would
be better served by studying the nature of Jonson's comedies
than the essay by Milton.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; And I don't think Milton was thinking specifically thinking of
&gt;&gt; Shakespeare's comedies, only Shakespeare as pleasant entertainment,
&gt;&gt; either complete comedies, or pleasing excerpts from other plays.

&gt;There's no support for that reading in the poem. Given that &quot;L'Allegro&quot;
&gt;and &quot;Il Penseroso&quot; are paired poems, and that one focuses on the light,
&gt;comic side of life and the other on the melancholy, tragic sense of
&gt;life, and that &quot;Il Penseroso&quot; contains lines in praise of tragic drama,
&gt;it makes no sense to imagine that Milton was referring to anything *but*
&gt;Shakespeare's comedies in &quot;L'Allegro.&quot;

"/>

See the above quotes from the poems. You are reducing these
poems to the level of an explication for high schoolers.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;A comic playwright doesn't need to put on socks in order to write a
&gt;&gt;&gt;comedy, but classical actors wore &quot;socks&quot; (actually low slippers) and
&gt;&gt;&gt;buskins (high-heeled boots) for tragedy. &quot;If Jonson's learned sock be
&gt;&gt;&gt;on&quot; suggests that Jonson is a sock-wearing actor, but of course refers
&gt;&gt;&gt;to him as an author of comedy. The comic playwright Shakespeare is
&gt;&gt;&gt;also described as a performer, but not an actor. What kind of creature

&gt;&gt;&gt; 1. warbles
&gt;&gt;&gt; 2. is native to the woods
&gt;&gt;&gt; 3. is wild

&gt;&gt;&gt;-- a bird, obviously, and I think probably a thrush of some kind.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Thus Allegro describes BOTH of his favorite comic playwrights as
&gt;&gt;&gt;performers.

&gt;&gt; Doubt it. He describes Jonson *metaphorically* as an actor.
&gt;&gt;&quot;If Jonson's learned sock be on&quot;-----&gt;&quot;If a learned comic play
&gt;&gt; by Jonson is on the stage&quot;. And he doesn't describe Shakespeare
&gt;&gt; as an actor at all, only metaphorically as a bird with a pleasing
&gt;&gt; song. (And why couldn't it be a nightingale Milton had in mind, if
&gt;&gt; indeed he had any specific bird in mind when he came up with
&gt;&gt; that line?)

&gt;As Terry pointed out in another post, the nightingale shows up in &quot;Il
&gt;Penseroso,&quot; where its presence makes sense, the nightingale being a bird
&gt;associated with tragedy and melancholy since the days of the ancient
&gt;Greeks.

"/>

Yes, quite right, but why a thrush for L'Allegro? The lark appears
in L'Allegro.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; reading by showing every single example I could find
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of how Shakespeare used the word throughout his
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; career. (I could have done the same for Marlowe &amp;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Spenser with no different result, by the way). This,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; together with the OED, showed that use of the word
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 'besides' to mean 'except' in this context would be
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; not only unique for Shakespeare, but would also be
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; most unusual at any time, and certainly unheard of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; today.

&gt;&gt;&gt; So, first, you list all the usages. You identify the
&gt;&gt;&gt; two different lists as an absolute difference between
&gt;&gt;&gt; Shakespeare and everybody else.

&gt;&gt; I do WHAT??

&gt; See below.

"/>

But this isn't in any way an accurate summary of what I did,
Janice, and I was expressing incredulity that you should
think it was. What I did was to examine every occasion that
Shakespeare used the word 'besides' and allocate each of
them according to which of the various definitions given by
the Oxford English Dictionary applied to it. I thus showed
that he never used the word 'besides' as a preposition
with the meaning 'except' in an affirmative sentence, as it
would need to be if it meant 'except' in the last line of
Sonnet 112 in the way that many commentators suggest. I
have since then also looked at how several of his contemp-
oraries used the word (including Marlowe and Spenser) and
found that they seem never to have used it in this way either.

Contrary to what you said, therefore, there is only the
*one* list, and his usage is exactly same as everyone
else's. OK?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I reason from this that Shakespeare did in fact
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; mean it to be read as &quot;as well as&quot;. Unfortunately
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; for Shakespearean scholars, however, this definition
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; leads to a meaning that makes no sense to them - that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the poet is thought to be dead. It does make sense
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to me, of course.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Then, second, you argue that the difference between
&gt;&gt;&gt; Shakespeare and everyone else was intentionally chosen
&gt;&gt;&gt; on Shakespeare's part.

&gt;&gt; I do WHAT??

&gt; See below.

"/>

Once again, I express bewilderment at how you managed to
dredge that meaning from my words. I claim that, if we take
the *normal* usage of the word 'besides', as demonstrated
by Shakespeare and several of his contemporaries, it leads
to a meaning for the last line of the Sonnet that most
commentators would find inexplicable - that the poet is
saying he is thought to be dead.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt; You note that nobody but you believes this, but that
&gt;&gt;&gt; you really do believe it, and in fact that you think
&gt;&gt;&gt; it's quite plausible (on the basis of your previous
&gt;&gt;&gt; list).

"/>

No, Janice. I believe it quite plausible for the poet to
say that he is thought to be dead because I think it is
plausible that Marlowe survived 1593, and also think it
plausible that he wrote the Sonnets. I give my reasons as
to why I think these things plausible on my website.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Furthermore, this is not the only way in which that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; interpretation is indicated.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 1) The poet has already *said* in the same Sonnet
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that he is &quot;to none alive&quot;.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 2) He claims that the addressee is &quot;so strongly in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; my purpose bred&quot; that everyone (...) thinks the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the addressee is dead. Why?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 3) This one, i.e. that the addressee is thought dead
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;besides (= as well as) me&quot;.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Then, for the next step, you find some points that will
&gt;&gt;&gt; additionally indicate support in the text for what you
&gt;&gt;&gt; are saying Shakespeare intentionally put there.
&gt;&gt;&gt; (Presumably you have chosen points that are
&gt;&gt;&gt; difficult to find, that are not in every text.)

&gt;&gt; Does *anybody* have a clue what Janice is trying to say?

At this point I had completely lost track (if I had ever been
on it in the first place) of what you were trying to say. As
I had no way of knowing whether this was some deficiency on
my part (although I doubted it) I just wanted to know if any-
body else was having the same difficulty as me.

&gt; Is there one standard for Peter Farey and Paul Crowley --
&gt; we presume at the outset that they are making sense -- and
&gt; another for Janice Miller and Elizabeth Weir?

I try to understand what people say to me, Janice, that's all.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It is, of course, evidence that the poet was thought
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; dead at the time, but as this does not fit anything
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; other than the Marlovian scenario, the evidence has
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to be distorted in some way. I am not suggesting
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; they're being deceitful, by the way - just making an
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; honest attempt to fit it within a context that is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; simply not able to accommodate it.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Finally, you must take notice of the fact that the facts
&gt;&gt;&gt; don't fit what you've found. Therefore, the facts as
&gt;&gt;&gt; accepted must be incorrect.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; In Shakespeare's case, he seems to be

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; by implication not university educated.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Milton did not equate a university education with erudition.

&gt;&gt;Please take another look at what Milton said.

&gt; Milton nowhere says that a university education cannot under any

"/>

Jim, you ask &quot;how could it be possible&quot; that &quot;Milton does not equate a
university education with erudition&quot;? I quoted Milton's *Of Education*
and give a link to the entire essay. Milton does not say that
universities do a very good job in general of producing educated men -- he
thinks the educational system in England is a failure and should be
replaced. Even your own understanding of Milton, that he says &quot;sometimes
those who are university educated do not acquire erudition&quot; should
demonstrate to you that he does not equate a university education with
erudition.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt; Erudition certainly must be one of the qualities imparted by a
&gt;&gt;&gt; university education.

&gt;&gt;So one would hope, but such is not always the case, even today. I quoted
&gt;&gt;at some length Milton's discussion of the problems with education in his
&gt;&gt;time. Milton complains about &quot;the fruits of mis-spending our prime youth
&gt;&gt;at the schools and universities, as we do, either in learning mere words,
&gt;&gt;or such things chiefly as were better unlearned.&quot;

&gt; What does this have to do with Jonson's erudition?

"/>

It has to do with Milton's not equating a university education with
erudition. Jonson's own erudition, of course, was not the product of a
university education.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; In Shakespeare's lifetime there were only two kinds of serious writers:
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the educated, like the University Wits, or Jonson, who tried to make
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; himself a University Wit, mostly by his own effort, and Shakespeare's
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; type, who discarded the idea that literary works must be full of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; learning.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I don't know that Shakespeare tried to keep what learning he had out of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the plays -- quite the reverse, in fact: the plays are full of his
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;learning.

&gt;&gt;&gt; His plays are not full of the kind of learning that Jonson displays in
&gt;&gt;&gt; *his* plays: extended quotes in Latin from the classics, adaptions by
&gt;&gt;&gt; nearly literal translation from classical writers. That's all I'm
&gt;&gt;&gt; talking about here and don't understand this hair splitting that you are
&gt;&gt;&gt; engaging in. I think everyone can agree that Shakespeare was well-read
&gt;&gt;&gt; in English.

&gt;&gt;You may not be very familiar with Jonson's comedy, or with
&gt;&gt;non-Shakespearean comedy from the period. Do you find &quot;extended quotes in
&gt;&gt;Latin from the classics&quot; in *Volpone*? Is *The Alchemist* a &quot;nearly
&gt;&gt;literal translation from classical writers&quot;?

&gt; Jonson drops quite a bit of Latin in his comedies. I started a compilation
&gt; of his use of Latin for another argument here but gave it up because there
&gt; was so much of it. Here is what I got out of Bartholomew Fair:

"/>

Jim, your point was not that some Latin words or phrases occur in Jonson's
plays but that they contain &quot;extended quotes in Latin from the classics.&quot;
Do you consider a line or two to constitute &quot;extended quotes&quot;? Compare
Shakespeare's use of two lines from Ovid's *Heroides* in *Taming of the
Shrew*:

Luc. Heere Madam: Hic Ibat Simois, hic est sigeria
tellus, hic steterat Priami regia Celsa senis.
Bian. Conster them.
Luc. Hic Ibat, as I told you before, Simois, I am Lu-
centio, hic est, sonne vnto Vincentio of Pisa, Sigeria tel-
lus, disguised thus to get your loue, hic steterat, and that
Lucentio that comes a wooing, priami, is my man Tra-
nio, regia, bearing my port, celsa senis that we might be-
guile the old Pantalowne.
Hort. Madam, my Instrument's in tune.
Bian. Let's heare, oh fie, the treble iarres.
Luc. Spit in the hole man, and tune againe.
Bian. Now let mee see if I can conster it. Hic ibat si-
mois, I know you not, hic est sigeria tellus, I trust you not,
hic staterat priami, take heede he heare vs not, regia pre-
sume not, Celsa senis, despaire not.

Does the scene work better if the playgoer or reader understands Latin or
(better still) remembers the Ovid? Sure, but even a complete lack-Latin
will get much of what's going on.

Now let's look at your quotations from *Bartholomew Fair*; you neglected
to point out something important about the Latin tags -- the character who
speaks them.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Jonson quotes Horace, Ovid, Virgil, Persius and Juvenal and supplies his
&gt; own Latin lines as well (Redde te Harpocratem!) and also supplies a few
&gt; two-word Latin phrases (Ursa Major, Actum Est), all within a single
&gt; play. There is nothing like this extensive use of Latin in Shakespeare.
&gt; Love's Labour's Lost has the most, but the use of Latin there consists
&gt; mostly of single words, not phrases or lines, spoken by the pedant
&gt; Holofernes.

"/>

Every instance you give (except &quot;Ursa Major&quot;) is spoken by a single
character, Adam Overdo; it is the character who quotes Horace and the
others, just as it is Lucentio who quotes Ovid in *Taming of the Shew*.
The quotations you posted are short. I think the part of Overdo works a
bit better if the playgoer or reader knows the Latin, but it is not
essential to an understanding.

As for &quot;Ursa Major,&quot; the one bit of Latin you cited from *Bartholomew
Fair* that was NOT spoken by Overdo, Shakespeare himself uses the term in
*King Lear*.

Holofernes, by the way, is not the only character in *Loves Labors Lost*
to speak Latin:

Nath. Facile precor gellida, quando pecas omnia sub umbra ru-
minat, and so foorth. Ah good olde Mantuan, I may speake
of thee as the traueiler doth of Venice, vemchie, vencha, que non
te vnde, que non te perreche. Olde Mantuan, olde Mantuan,
Who vnderstandeth thee not, loues thee not, vt re sol la mi fa:
Vnder pardon sir, What are the contentes? or rather as Her-
race sayes in his, What my soule verses.

Both Jonson and Shakespeare saw the usefulness of giving a character a
fondness for Latin words, phrases, and even complete lines -- but neither
Jonson nor Shakespeare did this for every character in a play
(Zeal-of-the-land Busy would consider the use of Latin a sign of Popery).

Sorry, Jim, but you did not show us what you told us we would find in
Jonson's comedies: &quot;extended quotes in Latin from the classics, adaptions
by nearly literal translation from classical writers.&quot; Shakespeare can
also drop Latin words, phrases, or lines into his plays when he so
chooses, but the occasional use of such Latin when it is appropriate to a
scene or character is not the same thing as constructing plays on
&quot;extended quotes in Latin from the classics.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Most Oxfordian arguments begin as Baconian arguments to which a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; search-and-replace has been done (for &quot;Bacon&quot; read &quot;Oxford&quot;). While a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; pretty good case can be made for Bacon's extraordinary erudition, the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Oxfordian case has to be dummed down a bit, as fits the candidate.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Thus
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Mark Twain could speak of the &quot;real author&quot; as having had the greatest
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; legal mind of his era, which might describe Bacon, but is just silly
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; when
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; applied to Oxford. For Oxford the argument is reduced to &quot;attended
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Gray's
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; inn for a bit,&quot; which translates to &quot;must have picked up SOMETHING of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; law.&quot; Similarly, Bacon's actual writings reveal a brilliant thinker
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and accomplished prose stylist; Oxford's actual writings are
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; negligible,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; revealing a minor poet capapable of the occasional good line.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This, of course, isn't so helpful. ;)

&gt;&gt;&gt; But Terry makes a good point, whether or not you find it &quot;helpful.&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt; I know of no evidence that Oxford had a keen legal mind. Nor do I know
&gt;&gt;&gt; of any indication of Oxford's supposed erudition (unless one supposes at
&gt;&gt;&gt; the outset that he wrote the Shakespeare canon). Finally, I know of no
&gt;&gt;&gt; evidence that Oxford was an accomplished prose stylist. His letters do
&gt;&gt;&gt; not suggest as much. His verse is, as Terry noted, that of a minor
&gt;&gt;&gt; court poet, capable of occasional felicities, but also of monstrosities
&gt;&gt;&gt; like the rhythmically plodding and relentlessly alliterative

&gt;&gt;&gt; Fain would I sing but fury makes me fret,
&gt;&gt;&gt; And rage hath sworn to seek revenge of wrong;
&gt;&gt;&gt; My mazed mind in malice is so set,
&gt;&gt;&gt; As death shall daunt my deadly dolours long;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Patience perforce is such a pinching pain,
&gt;&gt;&gt; [...]

&gt;&gt;&gt; or his wretched, extended metaphor of love as a tennis game.

&gt;&gt;&gt; So tell me, Lynne, what IS the evidence, if any, of Oxford's legal
&gt;&gt;&gt; mind? What IS the evidence, if any, for his supposedly extraordinary
&gt;&gt;&gt; erudition? What IS the evidence, if any, that Oxford was either an
&gt;&gt;&gt; accomplished prose stylist or a poet of genius? Note that I am not
&gt;&gt;&gt; asserting that YOU have necessarily claimed that Oxford was erudite,
&gt;&gt;&gt; that he had a keen legal mind, or that he was a magisterial prose
&gt;&gt;&gt; stylist or poet, but one hears these assertions so routinely from
&gt;&gt;&gt; Oxfordians that I am curious whether you concur with of the Oxfordian
&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;search-and-replace&quot; adaptations of old Baconian arguments to which
&gt;&gt;&gt; Terry alludes above.

&gt;&gt; To be a little more serious, but very hasty:

&gt; Thank you for responding in more detail.

&gt;&gt; We have some evidence of Oxford's legal mind, apart from the fact he
&gt;&gt; attended Gray's Inn. See Regnier's article ((University of Miami Law
&gt;&gt; Review, Volume 57, Number 2, January 2003). The plays require legal
&gt;&gt; knowledge and an ability to read legal documents in the original
&gt;&gt; language as some of them weren't translated, and Oxford had that
&gt;&gt; ability. To my knowledge, no one except Twain has suggested that
&gt;&gt; Shakespeare had to be the greatest legal mind of his era, and I've
&gt;&gt; often heard Stratfordians say it wasn't necessary to have any
&gt;&gt; specialised legal knowledge--don't agree with this, by the way--so I
&gt;&gt; think the article I've given will suffice. One can't have it both
&gt;&gt; ways, saying that Shakespeare didn't need special legal training
&gt;&gt; because Shakespeare of Stratford couldn't have had any, and then
&gt;&gt; asking me to prove Oxford was the greatest legal mind of his time.

&gt; I agree, and I don't think that the plays require specialized legal
&gt; training, merely an acquaintance with the law. As far as I am aware,
&gt; only anti-Stratfordians make the author of the canon a formidable legal
&gt; scholar.

"/>

Ah, but I do think the plays require specialised legal training
(again, read Regnier. You might be surprised) and that's why so many
Stratfordians suggest Shakespeare of Stratford must have spent some of
the lost years as a legal clerk--which I don't think, by the way,
would have given him the ability to read legal French or talk about
cases that were conducted before his time. I didn't say Oxford didn't
have legal training, only that there is no necessity for him to be
considered the greatest legal mind of his era.

&gt;&gt; Stephanie Hopkins Hughes' B.A. thesis is to my mind the best source
&gt;&gt; for Oxford's education. It was written while she was at Concordia in
&gt;&gt; Portland, and shows that Oxford was tutored by some of the finest
&gt;&gt; minds in the country. You might try to access it.

&gt; Try to access an undergraduate thesis?! Was it ever published
&gt; anywhere?

Don't know. Will ask if it can be made available to you.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; There is much evidence for his extraordinary erudition. Lawrence
&gt;&gt; Nowell, his tutor for a short time when Oxford was just entering his
&gt;&gt; teens, says: &quot;I clearly see that my work for the Earl of Oxford can
&gt;&gt; not be much longer required.&quot;

&gt; I would regard that as evidence that his education was progressing
&gt; satisfactorily, not as evidence of any extraordinary erudition.

"/>

That's because you're espousing the Stratfordian pov. Since Nowell had
just started teaching him, it seems strange that he felt there was
little left to teach, and to my mind means that Oxford was brilliant
beyond his years. Of course, just to play Devil's advocate with myself
(which is a fun thing to do. Have you tried it?) Nelson presents the
possibility that Oxford was too unruly for Nowell to deal with. I do
think that's a rather weak argument, however.

Indeed,

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; formidable erudition was not required of someone of Oxford's station, so
&gt; his educational attainments need not have been anything particularly out
&gt; of the ordinary to have been regarded as satisfactory by either his
&gt; tutor or his guardian. He may well have exceeded what was expected of
&gt; him, but if so I would scarcely call him erudite.

&gt;&gt; Oxford's first (extant) letter, written
&gt;&gt; at fourteen, is in French.

&gt; And? The letter is pretty ordinary French.

It's more French than Shakespeare of Stratford had, I believe. In
fact, Nelson is worried that it is such good French that he feels it
necessary to raise the possibility that it might have been dictated.

&gt;&gt; Stratfordian, also says earlier in the book: &quot;Golding attributes to
&gt;&gt; his nephew, now fourteen, an interest in ancient history and current
&gt;&gt; events&quot;

&gt; I, too, was keenly interested in ancient history and current events
&gt; by that age, but I would be shocked if a teacher's or a relative's
&gt; approving mention of that interest were regarded as evidence of my

Well, most of it's in Stephanie's thesis, so I should ask her if I can
use it. In the meantime, I'd like you to try to accept that he
graduated with a BA from Cambridge at the age of fourteen and obtained
a master's at the age of 16. In 1567, at the age of seventeen, he was
admitted to Gray's Inn. I realise anything I say can be brushed off by
the opposition, but would also posit that you know nothing that would
link Shakespeare of Stratford with any kind of further education, or,
if you're honest, any kind of education at all. That is not to say
categorically that he had none, of course.

Carroll:

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; In Shakespeare's lifetime there were only two kinds of serious writers:

I'm not going to guess at what you're [saying], but let's be clear:
Carroll is passing a rather large stone here. He is saying he can't
conceive of a University-educated Shakespeare. He can ONLY conceive of
a Shakespeare whose most relevant and important schooling came by
experience on the stage, where he learned to write SPECIFICALLY for
the stage and for its particular requirements. Are you telling me that
such an opinion was not first formed in the knowledge that Shakspere,
in fact, lacked such an education?

&lt;snip&gt;

So, as you have him, Shakspere was an apprentice playwright who
learned the whole of his craft from his experience on the stage and in
the company of other actors. You cannot believe that the Author was
University-educated or otherwise formally tutored? Do you, as Grumman
does, claim that such a formal education would have been an impediment
to Shakespeare's genius? I think that is absolutely ridiculous. There
can't be any doubt that those early reckonings of &quot;Shakespeare's&quot;
origins has incorrectly influenced you, too.

You have once again completely misunderstood what I said.
The 'evidence' to which I was referring was the *normal*

find a meaning for the last two lines of the Sonnet which
makes sense to orthodox scholars without changing either

&gt;Jim, you ask &quot;how could it be possible&quot; that &quot;Milton does not equate a
&gt;university education with erudition&quot;? I quoted Milton's *Of Education*
&gt;and give a link to the entire essay. Milton does not say that
&gt;universities do a very good job in general of producing educated men -- he
&gt;thinks the educational system in England is a failure and should be
&gt;replaced. Even your own understanding of Milton, that he says &quot;sometimes
&gt;those who are university educated do not acquire erudition&quot; should
&gt;demonstrate to you that he does not equate a university education with
&gt;erudition.

This is getting old, and pretty silly. I am quite sure that Milton equated
A QUALITY UNIVERSITY EDUCATION with erudition, and other things,
and that he equated A POOR UNIVERSITY EDUCATION with other
things.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Erudition certainly must be one of the qualities imparted by a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; university education.

&gt;&gt;&gt;So one would hope, but such is not always the case, even today. I quote=
&gt;d
&gt;&gt;&gt;at some length Milton's discussion of the problems with education in his
&gt;&gt;&gt;time. Milton complains about &quot;the fruits of mis-spending our prime yout=
&gt;h
&gt;&gt;&gt;at the schools and universities, as we do, either in learning mere words=
&gt;,
&gt;&gt;&gt;or such things chiefly as were better unlearned.&quot;

&gt;&gt; What does this have to do with Jonson's erudition?

&gt;It has to do with Milton's not equating a university education with
&gt;erudition. Jonson's own erudition, of course, was not the product of a
&gt;university education.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; In Shakespeare's lifetime there were only two kinds of serious writ=
&gt;ers:
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the educated, like the University Wits, or Jonson, who tried to mak=
&gt;e
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; himself a University Wit, mostly by his own effort, and Shakespeare=
&gt;'s
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; type, who discarded the idea that literary works must be full of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; learning.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I don't know that Shakespeare tried to keep what learning he had out =
&gt;of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the plays -- quite the reverse, in fact: the plays are full of his
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;learning.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; His plays are not full of the kind of learning that Jonson displays in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; *his* plays: extended quotes in Latin from the classics, adaptions by
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; nearly literal translation from classical writers. That's all I'm
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; talking about here and don't understand this hair splitting that you a=
&gt;re
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; engaging in. I think everyone can agree that Shakespeare was well-read
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in English.

&gt;&gt;&gt;You may not be very familiar with Jonson's comedy, or with
&gt;&gt;&gt;non-Shakespearean comedy from the period. Do you find &quot;extended quotes =
&gt;in
&gt;&gt;&gt;Latin from the classics&quot; in *Volpone*? Is *The Alchemist* a &quot;nearly
&gt;&gt;&gt;literal translation from classical writers&quot;?

&gt;&gt; Jonson drops quite a bit of Latin in his comedies. I started a compilatio=
&gt;n
&gt;&gt; of his use of Latin for another argument here but gave it up because ther=
&gt;e
&gt;&gt; was so much of it. Here is what I got out of Bartholomew Fair:

&gt;Jim, your point was not that some Latin words or phrases occur in Jonson's
&gt;plays but that they contain &quot;extended quotes in Latin from the classics.&quot;
&gt;Do you consider a line or two to constitute &quot;extended quotes&quot;?

Yes, but there are passages in Jonson longer than a line or two.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Compare
&gt;Shakespeare's use of two lines from Ovid's *Heroides* in *Taming of the

Does Shakespeare do this often? In fact, are there ANY examples
other than this and a couple of quotes in another early play,
Titus Andronicus?

&gt;Does the scene work better if the playgoer or reader understands Latin or
&gt;(better still) remembers the Ovid? Sure, but even a complete lack-Latin
&gt;will get much of what's going on.

"/>

Shakspeare's use of Latin in his earliest plays is both meagre and well-known.
He soon dropped it. And he only quotes Ovid, not Horace, Persius, Juvenal
and Virgil as Jonson does. The difference is Jonson's wide range
of Latin sources, and his more extensive quotes. I'd type in the 40
consecutive lines from Ovid that Jonson &quot;corrected&quot; from Marlowe's
translation that he used in his comedy &quot;Poetaster&quot;, but I don't feel like
it (1.1.43-84, Cain edition).

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Now let's look at your quotations from *Bartholomew Fair*; you neglected
&gt;to point out something important about the Latin tags -- the character who
&gt;speaks them.

"/>

What I neglected to point out was that &quot;Bartholomew Fair&quot; was
Jonson's last major comedy, and by that time his style had changed
to a less self-consciously &quot;learned&quot; one. But even in that play
he displays knowledge of a wide variety of Latin source material, much
wider than Shakespeare. See &quot;Volpone&quot; for a more typical example
of Jonson's &quot;learning&quot;.

&gt;&gt; non ad diruendum: so lead on.

&gt;Spoken by Justice Overdo.

&gt;&gt; Jonson quotes Horace, Ovid, Virgil, Persius and Juvenal and supplies his
&gt;&gt; own Latin lines as well (Redde te Harpocratem!) and also supplies a few
&gt;&gt; two-word Latin phrases (Ursa Major, Actum Est), all within a single
&gt;&gt; play. There is nothing like this extensive use of Latin in Shakespeare.
&gt;&gt; Love's Labour's Lost has the most, but the use of Latin there consists
&gt;&gt; mostly of single words, not phrases or lines, spoken by the pedant
&gt;&gt; Holofernes.

&gt;Every instance you give (except &quot;Ursa Major&quot;) is spoken by a single
&gt;character, Adam Overdo; it is the character who quotes Horace and the
&gt;others, just as it is Lucentio who quotes Ovid in *Taming of the Shew*.
&gt;The quotations you posted are short. I think the part of Overdo works a
&gt;bit better if the playgoer or reader knows the Latin, but it is not
&gt;essential to an understanding.

&gt;As for &quot;Ursa Major,&quot; the one bit of Latin you cited from *Bartholomew
&gt;Fair* that was NOT spoken by Overdo, Shakespeare himself uses the term in
&gt;*King Lear*.

&gt;Holofernes, by the way, is not the only character in *Loves Labors Lost*
&gt;to speak Latin:

&gt; Nath. Facile precor gellida, quando pecas omnia sub umbra ru-
&gt; minat, and so foorth. Ah good olde Mantuan, I may speake
&gt; of thee as the traueiler doth of Venice, vemchie, vencha, que non
&gt; te vnde, que non te perreche. Olde Mantuan, olde Mantuan,
&gt; Who vnderstandeth thee not, loues thee not, vt re sol la mi fa:
&gt; Vnder pardon sir, What are the contentes? or rather as Her-
&gt; race sayes in his, What my soule verses.

&gt;Both Jonson and Shakespeare saw the usefulness of giving a character a
&gt;fondness for Latin words, phrases, and even complete lines -- but neither
&gt;Jonson nor Shakespeare did this for every character in a play
&gt;(Zeal-of-the-land Busy would consider the use of Latin a sign of Popery).

"/>

You neglect to point out that for Shakespeare, the use of Latin is by and
large the exception, whereas for Jonson it is the rule in his plays.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Sorry, Jim, but you did not show us what you told us we would find in

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; plays if his education had been spent in a university rather than on
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the

&gt;I'm not going to guess at what you're [saying], but let's be clear:
&gt;KQKnave is passing a rather large stone here. He is saying he can't
&gt;conceive of a University-educated Shakespeare. He can ONLY conceive of
&gt;a Shakespeare whose most relevant and important schooling came by
&gt;experience on the stage, where he learned to write SPECIFICALLY for
&gt;the stage and for its particular requirements. Are you telling me that
&gt;such an opinion was not first formed in the knowledge that Shakspere,
&gt;in fact, lacked such an education?

No. It was formed by comparison of his plays with those by playwrights
who are known to have had a university education.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;So, as you have him, Shakspere was an apprentice playwright who

I think that's likely. It's not absolutely necessary for me to believe that
he was not university educated, it just seems most likely from comparison
with other university educated writers of his time. A university education
is more likely to lead to conformism, not creativity. There aren't very many

comedies.

Mountains on whose barren brest

And you find this tragic rather than pastoral? How odd.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; And Il Penseroso is not unrelievedly dark:

"/>

And no one said it was. Tragedies are not unrelievedly dark, either,
and comedies are not unrelievedly light, as readers of Shakespeare are
well aware.

The fact remains, however, that Milton alludes to comedy (the sock) in
L'Allegro and tragedy (the buskin) in Il Penseroso. Milton is the one
defining the associations. If Milton had wanted to indicate that
lyrical extracts from tragedies would suit the pastoral mood just as
well as comedies, he was certainly capable of doing so: yet he did not.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;Warble his wood-notes wild&quot; sounds to me like he is referring to
&gt;&gt;&gt; any lyric passage in any Shakespearean play, for example Clarence's
&gt;&gt;&gt; speech at the beginning of 1.4 of R3, or the passage in Titus where
&gt;&gt;&gt; Titus says &quot;For now I stand as one upon a rock/ Environ'd with a
&gt;&gt;&gt; wilderness of sea&quot; etc. &quot;Warble his wood-notes wild&quot; seems like an
&gt;&gt;&gt; odd description of &quot;The Comedy of Errors&quot; or &quot;The Merchant of
&gt;&gt;&gt; Venice&quot;, or &quot;Love's Labor's Lost&quot;.

&gt;&gt;On the other hand, it's a plausible characterization of the pastoral
&gt;&gt;comedy &quot;As You Like It,&quot; which fits nicely with overall pastoral feel
&gt;&gt;of &quot;L'Allegro&quot; and the specific reference to Hymen, who does in fact
&gt;&gt;appear onstage at the end of &quot;As You Like It.&quot;

&gt; There are references to lots of things in the poem, most of which
&gt; don't appear in Shakespeare.

"/>

And? &quot;L'Allegro&quot; is a pastoral poem; &quot;As You Like It&quot; is a pastoral
comedy. We will never know which specific work or works of
Shakespeare's Milton was thinking of, by &quot;As You Like It&quot; is a good
guess.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&quot;A Midsummer Night's Dream&quot; also fits, given Milton's allusions to
&gt;&gt; English fairy-lore. It seems highly unlikely that a poem which
&gt;&gt; begins by banishing &quot;loathed Melancholy&quot; would invite the reader to
&gt;&gt; imagine an audience delighted by the Lydian airs of &quot;Richard III&quot; or
&gt;&gt;&quot;Titus Andronicus.&quot;

&gt; But that's not my point. I don't think he meant the whole of those
&gt; plays either. Milton was referring to the lyric nature of the verse in
&gt; Shakespeare, not specific plays.

"/>

It's more plausible that he was referring to whole plays:

&quot;Then to the well-trod stage anon,
If Jonsons learnèd Sock be on,
Or sweetest Shakespear fancies childe,
Warble his native Wood-notes wilde...&quot;

In Milton's time, people would not go to the well-trod stage to listen
to selected extracts from Shakespeare's plays: they'd go to see
performances of the entire works. If Milton wanted to refer to the
lyric nature of the verse without reference to whole plays, it was
obtuse of him to introduce the image of people going to the theater.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;[snip]
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I may have. I now think you misunderstand Milton's views on
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;universities and Allegro's taste for comedy, but I had earlier
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;assumed that you probably understood them, and based on that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;assumption, I misunderstood what you were saying.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Actually I think it is you have misunderstood Milton's poetic
&gt;&gt;&gt; expression in L'Allegro because you seem to think it has something
&gt;&gt;&gt; to do with an essay primarily directed at the education of
&gt;&gt;&gt; barristers and politicians that he wrote much later.

&gt;&gt;Terry thinks that we may get some insight into Milton's use of the
&gt;&gt;word &quot;learned&quot; in &quot;L'Allegro&quot; by studying what Milton had to say about
&gt;&gt;learning. That looks like a plausible claim to me.

&gt; It would be if L'Allegro were an essay concerning education, or a
&gt; speech by character on eduction, but we are talking about one word in
&gt; a three-line reference to playwrights. Milton no doubt had something
&gt; specific in mind when he used the word &quot;learned&quot; in reference to
&gt; Jonson, and you would be better served by studying the nature of
&gt; Jonson's comedies than the essay by Milton.

"/>

How would studying Jonson's works help one better understand Milton's
use of words? It makes no sense to study Jonson's works and try to
guess which aspects of them Milton thought of as learned when we can
just as easily study Milton's other works to better understand how he
would have used the term.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt; And I don't think Milton was thinking specifically thinking of
&gt;&gt;&gt; Shakespeare's comedies, only Shakespeare as pleasant entertainment,
&gt;&gt;&gt; either complete comedies, or pleasing excerpts from other plays.

&gt;&gt;There's no support for that reading in the poem. Given that
&gt;&gt;&quot;L'Allegro&quot; and &quot;Il Penseroso&quot; are paired poems, and that one focuses
&gt;&gt;on the light, comic side of life and the other on the melancholy,
&gt;&gt;tragic sense of life, and that &quot;Il Penseroso&quot; contains lines in praise
&gt;&gt;of tragic drama, it makes no sense to imagine that Milton was
&gt;&gt;referring to anything *but* Shakespeare's comedies in &quot;L'Allegro.&quot;

&gt; See the above quotes from the poems. You are reducing these
&gt; poems to the level of an explication for high schoolers.

I'm sorry that you think so, especially since your quotes above do
nothing to disprove my statements about the poems. Just out of
curiosity, what do you think Milton was getting at in these two poems?

&gt;&gt;&gt; by Jonson is on the stage&quot;. And he doesn't describe Shakespeare
&gt;&gt;&gt; as an actor at all, only metaphorically as a bird with a pleasing
&gt;&gt;&gt; song. (And why couldn't it be a nightingale Milton had in mind, if
&gt;&gt;&gt; indeed he had any specific bird in mind when he came up with
&gt;&gt;&gt; that line?)

&gt;&gt;As Terry pointed out in another post, the nightingale shows up in &quot;Il
&gt;&gt;Penseroso,&quot; where its presence makes sense, the nightingale being a
&gt;&gt;bird associated with tragedy and melancholy since the days of the
&gt;&gt;ancient Greeks.

&gt; Yes, quite right, but why a thrush for L'Allegro? The lark appears
&gt; in L'Allegro.

Well, the boys at the Cornell Ornithology lab disagree with you:

Select &quot;Horned Lark&quot;:

&quot;The tinkling song is a thin rapid warble, &quot;tsip, tsip tsee, didididi.&quot;
A commonly heard flight call is a two-syllable &quot;see-tu, see-tu.&quot;&quot;

A very nice site, by the way, where you can listen to recordings
of the bird calls.

I interpret this to say:

double negative for emphasis, or to get the meter right, or because he
wasn't the most grammatically correct writer of all time)

so that my rigid sense changes either right or wrong

&gt; Select &quot;Horned Lark&quot;:

"/>

Of course, the lark in &quot;L'Allegro&quot; is a sky lark (Alauda arvensis), not
a horned lark (Eremophila alpestris). In any case, I was referring not
to actual birds but to poetic birds; so far as I know, the standard
poetic figure in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries had the lark
singing, never warbling.

Oddly enough, in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries the
lark did indeed begin to warble, as noted by Wordsworth (&quot;I heard the
sky-lark warbling in the sky&quot; -- where else?), Burns (&quot;O, stay, sweet
warbling wood-lark, stay&quot;), Thomas Gray (&quot;But chief the sky-lark warbles
high&quot;), and others. (Not Shelley, though -- the Skylark of his Ode
warbleth not).

The warbling lark also appeared in other countries: Müller's _Die Schöne
Müllerin_ contains the line &quot;Die Lerche wirbelt in der Luft.&quot; I can't
find a single warbling lark before 1750, though. Counterexamples are
welcomed.

Poetic sky larks are associated with three distinct characteristics:
they sing in flight, they fly straight up, and they appear at daybreak -
thus Milton: &quot;To hear the Lark begin his flight,/And singing startle the
dull night/From his watch-towre in the skies,/Till the dappled dawn doth
rise&quot; (cf. Shakespeare's Sonnet 29). The fact that the Shakespeare-bird
has none of these characteristics indicates that Milton is not imagining
him as a lark.

Okay, steel'd meaning &quot;armored.&quot; He has armored his sense, his

It appears to me the poet sayeth, There is no one else in existence

Makes no sense. It flatly contradicts the rest of the poem. The poet
could not know his shames and praises from a dead man's tongue; the
dead don't speak.

The point of the poem is that only the one addressed is &quot;alive&quot; for
the poet. The poet is dead, unresponsive, to the rest of the world,
and he draws his love in, making his love &quot;dead&quot; to the rest of the
world, too. Or the poet seeks to do that. The poet's &quot;purpose,&quot; line
13, is to isolate himself, and his love, so they are dead,
unresponsive, to others, and alive only to each other.

Just to muddy the waters a little more, let me
say that I have seen the compositor responsible for
g4 described as particularly prone to misread his
copy. (A facsimile of a 1609 quarto can be seen at
.
Sonnet 112 is on g4r.)

Somewhere on the web I've seen the line given this way:

That all the world besides methinks th'are dead

The emender obviously took the 'y' to be a thorn.

I don't have a problem losing the space. I'm
not so sure about the thorn, but the emendation
does seem to fit the rest of the sonnet pretty
well.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

How you understand the word is irrelevant to the question of how Milton
understood the word, and from the evidence of his poetry, we may safely
infer that he did not understand it as applying to the song of the sky
lark.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; And now you've managed to reduce Milton to &quot;standard poetic figures&quot;.

Like William Shakespeare?

Haply I think on thee, and then my state
Like to the lark at break of day arising
From sullen earth, sings hymns at heaven's gate...

The way we determine standard poetic figures is by studying the works of
poets: a figure becomes standard when it is employed by many different
poets. I hope it doesn't come as too much of a surprise to you to learn
that in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries it was common for poets
to write so as to be understood by their readers. It happens that a
contemporary reader of &quot;L'Allegro,&quot; reading the lines about Shakespeare,
would infer that Milton was likening the poet to a songbird, but would
not infer that Milton might have been thinking of a sky lark.

If Milton had wanted the reader to think he was likening Shakespeare to
a sky lark, he had a number of devices at his disposal; he could have
used the word 'lark'; he could have made reference to singing while
ascending vertically; he could have made reference to singing at the
break of day. Milton was not in the habit of forcing his readers to
play twenty questions with him.

A modern reader, unfamiliar with the poetic tropes and figures used in
the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, might well think Milton's
warbler of native wood-notes wild was a sky lark, or even a nightingale,
but that only demonstrates how wide the gap is between our time and
Milton's. Milton had a deep respect for poetic tradition; the fact that
he used standard poetic figures is as unsurprising as the fact that he
used standard parts of speech.

It isn't demonstrably untrue, in fact it's nonsense, in fact in your earlier
post you gave examples of other birds warbling. Steese, this kind
of rigid analysis is why so many people hated their high school
English courses!

The lines are

&quot;Or sweetest Shakespeare, fancy's child,
Warble his native wood-notes wild,&quot;

There is no mention of a specific bird here, and warble could apply
to any bird song. In fact, unlike you and Ross, I don't believe that
Milton had any specific bird in mind at all. What he had in mind
was the lyric, song-like nature of Shakespeare's verse, and the
consonantal echo involving &quot;warble&quot;, &quot;wood&quot; and &quot;wild&quot;.

Here are some examples from Milton's other poetry that
show that as far as Milton was concerned (and I would imagine
any other poet as well), &quot;warbling&quot; applied to anything that
could sing, including humans beings, or the &quot;warbling&quot; of
a brook.

People warbling a song:

Comus lines 852 ff
And, as the old swain said, she can unlock
The clasping charm, and thaw the numming spell,
If she be right invoked in warbled song,

A woman (Dalilah in this case) can warble:

Samson Agonistes lines 932 ff
I know thy trains
Though dearly to my cost, thy ginns, and toils;
Thy fair enchanted cup, and warbling charms
No more on me have power, their force is nulled,

A nightingale can warble:

Paradise Regained lines 244 ff
See there the olive-grove of academe,
Plato's retirement, where the Attic bird
Trills her thick-warbled notes the summer long;

People again:

Paradise Lost Book 2, lines 237 ff:
Suppose he should relent
And publish Grace to all, on promise made
Of new subjection; with what eyes could we
Stand in his presence humble, and receive
Strict laws imposed, to celebrate his throne
With warbled hymns, and to his Godhead sing
Forced halleluiah's;

A brook:

PL, Book 3, lines 26 ff:
Yet not the more
Cease I to wander where the Muses haunt
Cleer spring, or shady grove, or sunny hill,
Smit with the love of sacred song; but chief
Thee Zion and the flowery brooks beneath
That wash thy hallowed feet, and warbling flow,
Nightly I visit;

Some unspecified bird that warbles a night:

PL, Book 5, lines 37 ff
Why sleepst thou Eve? now is the pleasant time,
The cool, the silent, save where silence yields
To the night-warbling bird, that now awake
Tunes sweetest his love-labor'd song;

Here Milton seems to imply that people and
any birds that sing, as well as streams, can
warble:

Book 5, lines 195 ff
Fountains and ye, that warble, as ye flow,
Melodious murmurs, warbling tune his praise.
Joyn voices all ye living souls, ye birds,
That singing up to heaven gate ascend,
Bear on your wings and in your notes his praise;

The nightingale again:

Book 7, lines 433 ff
From branch to branch the smaller birds with song
Solac'd the woods, and spred their painted wings
Till ev'n, nor then the solemn nightingale
Ceased warbling, but all night tuned her soft lays:

Any kind of bird:

Book 8, lines 261 ff
about me round I saw
Hill, dale, and shady woods, and sunny plains,
And liquid lapse of murmuring streams; by these,
Creatures that lived, and moved, and walked, or flew,
Birds on the branches warbling; all things smiled,
With fragrance and with joy my heart oreflowed.

So if you are going to insist on some specific image that
Shakespeare had in mind, at least do your homework.

It is demonstrably untrue that sky larks warble in English poetry
written prior to 1750. Thus, your suggestion that Milton may have been
comparing Shakespeare to a sky lark is wrong.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; There is no mention of a specific bird here, and warble could apply
&gt; to any bird song. In fact, unlike you and Ross, I don't believe that
&gt; Milton had any specific bird in mind at all.

"/>

I don't know whether Milton had a specific bird in mind, either, and I
have never said otherwise.

Terry said he thought the bird was *probably* a thrush, and you
disagreed with him. Instead of simply stating your opinion that Milton
had no specific bird in mind, you suggested alternative birds. Now, so
far as I'm concerned there is nothing to argue about in your &quot;no
specific bird&quot; opinion, but your alternatives were highly debatable. I
pointed out that your initial suggestion of a nightingale was
improbable, and your revised suggestion that he might have been thinking
of a lark was equally improbable. As you have not tried to defend
either suggestion, I gather that you concur.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

I don't see any reason why you should be granted special insight into
what Milton &quot;had in mind,&quot; and given that you've criticized me for
&quot;trying to turn these poems into cartoons,&quot; your suggestion that Milton
cared more about alliteration than meaning is a bit puzzling.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

All that effort, and you couldn't find a single example of a sky lark
warbling?

Now *this* is an interesting example. Notice that while fountains and
other flowing waters warble, the birds *sing* as they ascend up to
heaven gate. What kind of bird might Milton have associated with the
gate of heaven? Let's see what Shakespeare has to say about this. From
Cymbeline, II:iii:

Hearke, hearke, the Larke at heavens gate sings and Phoebus gins
arise...

And our old favorite, Sonnet 29:

Haply I thinke on thee, and then my state
(Like to the Larke at breake of daye arising)
From sullen earth sings himns at Heauens gate...

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Not any kind of bird. Many kinds of birds do not sing while sitting on
branches. Sky larks, for example.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

I'll promise to do my homework if you'll promise to proofread your posts
before sending them. We were talking about Milton, remember? And I was
not insisting that he had any specific image in mind; quite the
contrary; I was pointing out that he clearly did *not* have one specific
image in mind, i.e., Shakespeare as a sky lark. As I noted above, you
evidently agree with me on this. What, exactly, are you arguing about?

&gt; Carroll:

&gt;&gt;&gt; I didn't think it meant that. I thought &quot;learned&quot; simply meant
&quot;learned&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt; by implication not university educated.

&gt; Ross:

&gt;&gt; Milton did not equate a university education with erudition.

&gt; Heh, heh. This is ALL I could ask for: another exchange on what

You know what, Toby? I'm going to agree with you. I think he was a pretty
smart fella and I think he read a lot of books. He just didn't read a lot of
college textbooks. But I might be talking through my ass, because I don't
know what books they read in college. Do you?

I know some they read in grammar school, and the plays are full of
references to them. I also know the plays are full of references to and
outright thefts from history books. Do you know if they studied history in
college back then? I don't.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

I just admitted it!

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; After all, these plays were

Who said they were tossed-off patch jobs? You're the only one saying that.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt; In Shakespeare's lifetime there were only two kinds of serious
writers:
&gt;&gt;&gt; the educated, like the University Wits, or Jonson, who tried to make
&gt;&gt;&gt; himself a University Wit, mostly by his own effort, and Shakespeare's
&gt;&gt;&gt; type, who discarded the idea that literary works must be full of
&gt;&gt;&gt; learning.

&gt;&gt; I don't know that Shakespeare tried to keep what learning he had out of
&gt;&gt; the plays -- quite the reverse, in fact: the plays are full of his
&gt;&gt; learning. He obviously read very widely, but most of what he read was
not
&gt;&gt; the sort of thing that would have been part of any university curriculum
&gt;&gt; in his (or Milton's) day, just as Milton would not have read (or
attended)
&gt;&gt; Jonson's and Shakespeare's plays as part of a classroom assignment, but
&gt;&gt; his familiarity with them is part of what he (and we) would consider his
&gt;&gt; education.

&gt; I'm sure you're right about the curricula, but how does being &quot;very
&gt; widely&quot; read and writing plays &quot;full of his learning&quot; qualify him for
&gt; the back-handed charges of artlessness and being naturally witty?

"/>

Well, the university people wrote a certain way, and Shakespeare didn't
write that way. Does that make it clearer?

The

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Author was, I hope it can be admitted, fluent in Latin (based on the
&gt; very obvious etymological awareness in his English)

"/>

Well, he should have been given what the grammar school curriculum was,
don't you think?

and French, if not

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Italian (based on the languages of his sourceworks).

"/>

If he knew Latin, French and Italian should have been pretty easy for him,
don't you think? I took only four semesters of French and I haven't been to
France in years, but I can still read it some. Back when I was in school, I
could understand Italian movies better than I could French, but I never took
any Italian.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; He wasn't reading
&gt; pulp fiction, exactly, even if it wasn't properly a part of any
&gt; University curriculum.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I think in his lifetime Shakespeare was the only example of the latter
&gt;&gt;&gt; kind, and I can't imagine how he could have written the same kinds of
&gt;&gt;&gt; plays if his education had been spent in a university rather than on
the
&gt;&gt;&gt; stage itself, learning how to present action rather than the old
&gt;&gt;&gt; fashioned tableaux style.

&gt; See how an imperfect biography drives interpretation?

&gt; I was reading some essays by a guy named Jan Kott lately and he
&gt; reminded me of something that I enjoyed in Ogburn: Shakespeare was
&gt; probably never very fond of the limitations of the stage. He wrote
&gt; with a cinematic eye.

"/>

Cetainly different from the university wits, don't you think?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; His plays were not practically situated or timed
&gt; and, thus, were often cut up for the stage.

&gt;&gt; Say, what? I must be missing something here, because you can't possibly
&gt;&gt; mean to suggest that all Elizabethan comedy other than Shakespeare was
&gt;&gt; done in &quot;the old fashioned tableaux style.&quot; Is that what you think of
&gt;&gt; *The Shoemaker's Holiday*? To take an old-fashioned play, is that what
&gt;&gt; you think of *Gammer Gurton's Needle*?

&gt;&gt;&gt; And it's those two choices that Milton is contrasting in his poem.

&gt; I think Milton is just echoing what he had heard. There's no need to
&gt; suppose that he regarded Shakespeare (relative to Jonson) as some sort
&gt; of preternatural freak or fluke. Besides, don't we have to wait on
&gt; Coleridge before we get to the level of fancy-pants literary criticism
&gt; expected here?

&gt;&gt; Have you read Jonson's comedies? Do you think *Bartholomew Fair* or
&gt;&gt; *Epicoene* is presented in &quot;the old fashioned tableaux style&quot; (whatever
&gt;&gt; that may mean -- I'm not at all sure what non-Shakespearean comedies you
&gt;&gt; could have in mind).

&gt;&gt; Then to the well-trod stage anon,
&gt;&gt; If Jonsons learned Sock be on,
&gt;&gt; Or sweetest Shakespear fancies childe,
&gt;&gt; Warble his native Wood-notes wilde,

&gt;&gt; The contrast is not just between &quot;learned&quot; and &quot;wilde&quot; but
metaphorically
&gt;&gt; between a comic actor (the &quot;sock&quot; is work not by the author of a comedy
&gt;&gt; but by the players) and a non-human performer, a bird of the woods (a
&gt;&gt; thrush, I imagine). The phrase &quot;learned sock&quot; is witty in the highest
&gt;&gt; sense, being funny, apt, and surprising. Milton, displaying some of the
&gt;&gt; erudition that he did NOT gain in a classroom, echoes the Shakespearean
&gt;&gt; phrase &quot;child of fancy.&quot;

&gt; It's good to note that you consider a faculty for comedic dissonance
&gt; evidence of erudition.

&gt;&gt;&gt; In any case, I don't see anything in Milton's essay that contradicts
my
&gt;&gt;&gt; interpretation,

&gt;&gt; Then step back a bit, and consider whether the antistratfordian
insistence
&gt;&gt; that the author of Shakespeare's works must have been a university man
is
&gt;&gt; not merely misguided but would have appeared so in his own or in
Milton's
&gt;&gt; time.

&gt; Do Anti-Stratfordians insist on that? Maybe. I know they expect the
&gt; Author to have been well-educated, both formally and experientially.

"/>

Do you mean university-educated when you say &quot;formally?&quot;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Either way, it leaves Shakspere out of the picture.

"/>

How about showing us something in the plays that only a university-educated
person could have written? There are no references to the play to a
university education, but there are many to a grammar school education.

Even if you give

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; the guy a formal education up to about the age of 12 and the ability
&gt; to read, where is the evidence or even the motivation for him to have
&gt; gone off and invested as much of himself in the old R &amp; D as we should
&gt; expect of the Author?

"/>

Mmm, he was in the theatre business and he had a knack andlove for writing?
That sounds like a pretty good motivation to me.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; There's no books or paper trails or stories of
&gt; time spent in some great patron's library.

You know, it's too bad there wasn't someone around with a video camera
recording all this for you, Toby.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; The antistratfordian argument seems to go something like this:

&gt;&gt; 1. Shakespeare's works display an extraordinary erudition.
&gt;&gt; 2. All university men were extraordinarily erudite.
&gt;&gt; 3. Argal, Shakespeare must have been a university man.

&gt;&gt; There are many things wrong with this argument. First, even if the
&gt;&gt; premises were true, the conclusion does not follow from them
(Shakespeare
&gt;&gt; might have been erudite without a university education).

&gt; True, but without evidence of his autodidactism, too?

"/>

Well, if you're going to disqualify all the plays as evidence for his
autodidactism, I guess you're right.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; Second, the
&gt;&gt; terms are not used consistently. The &quot;extraordinary erudition&quot; one
finds
&gt;&gt; in Shakespeare's plays could not be explained by a university education,
&gt;&gt; as most of the works that are generally considered his sources were not
&gt;&gt; part of the curriculum, and thus the word &quot;erudite&quot; in the second
premise
&gt;&gt; refers to a different body of knowledge (albeit with some possible
&gt;&gt; overlap) from that which is suggested by &quot;erudition&quot; in the first.

&gt; I will defer to you on the question of the curriculum, so long as the
&gt; Author still gets to be erudite in some sense.

&gt;&gt; Third, not every person who spent time in a university came out erudite
&gt;&gt; even in the things a university tried to teach.

&gt; Indeed.

&gt;&gt; There are more things
&gt;&gt; wrong with the argument, but this should be enough for our purposes.

&gt;&gt; It is true that Shakespeare (like Kyd) was NOT considered
extraordinarily
&gt;&gt; erudite in his time; he was sometimes mocked for his relative ignorance,
&gt;&gt; or his fans were for being so fond of his unworthy works. However, it
is
&gt;&gt; also true that he somehow or other picked up quite a bit of
book-learnin'

It's not something we can settle, but if Milton did have a particular kind

we might be able to narrow the choices somewhat by attending to the

in the twin poems; it would be a bird of the woods; it would be a bird
that was a great song stylist.

The problem with this is that the &quot;they&quot; is superfluous. It sounds

That's ridiculous. IF Milton had a particular bird in mind when
he wrote those lines (and a particular bird, a thrush, is Terry Ross's

larks sing, and all birds that sing warble, and he mentioned a

&gt;&gt; There is no mention of a specific bird here, and warble could apply
&gt;&gt; to any bird song. In fact, unlike you and Ross, I don't believe that
&gt;&gt; Milton had any specific bird in mind at all.

&gt;I don't know whether Milton had a specific bird in mind, either, and I
&gt;have never said otherwise.

&gt;Terry said he thought the bird was *probably* a thrush, and you

To which I replied, &quot;quite right&quot;, because of its association
with night and its presence in Il Penseroso. But what
Milton had in mind when he wrote about Shakespeare
warbling was anything and everything that could sing,
including nightingales, larks, babbling brooks, and
people singing.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;and your revised suggestion that he might have been thinking
&gt;of a lark was equally improbable. As you have not tried to defend
&gt;either suggestion, I gather that you concur.

"/>

Sorry Steese, but IF you are going to propose a specific bird,
a lark seems to me more likely than a thrush, since thrushes
are not alluded to at all in the poem, but the lark is, and larks
warble.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; What he had in mind was the lyric, song-like nature of Shakespeare's
&gt;&gt; verse, and the consonantal echo involving &quot;warble&quot;, &quot;wood&quot; and &quot;wild&quot;.

&gt;I don't see any reason why you should be granted special insight into
&gt;what Milton &quot;had in mind,&quot; and given that you've criticized me for
&gt;&quot;trying to turn these poems into cartoons,&quot; your suggestion that Milton
&gt;cared more about alliteration than meaning is a bit puzzling.

"/>

I didn't say that Milton cared about alliteration more than meaning.
Alliteration is one consideration, and a major one for a poet.
But Milton's meaning is not defined by a single bird in this instance.
He is likening the quality of Shakespeare's verse to singing in
general, and the examples from his other verse that I provided
show that he thought birds in general can warble, so can a
running stream or brook, so can people. Now the image of
a Shakespeare who can &quot;warble his native wood-notes wild&quot;
makes perfect sense. Milton obviously associated &quot;warbling&quot;
with the natural world of birds and streams, and country
people singing to conjure up their gods, so the association
of &quot;warble&quot; with &quot;native&quot;, &quot;wood-notes&quot; and &quot;wild&quot; tells us
that Shakespeare's verse was the product of the natural world
(not the unversity educated world).

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Here are some examples from Milton's other poetry that show that as
&gt;&gt; far as Milton was concerned (and I would imagine any other poet as
&gt;&gt; well), &quot;warbling&quot; applied to anything that could sing, including
&gt;&gt; humans beings, or the &quot;warbling&quot; of a brook.

&gt;All that effort, and you couldn't find a single example of a sky lark
&gt;warbling?

"/>

I don't have to, since no specific bird is alluded to by Milton's
lines. It's enough to show that Milton associated warbling with
several different things, including birds in general.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Book 5, lines 195 ff
&gt;&gt; Fountains and ye, that warble, as ye flow,
&gt;&gt; Melodious murmurs, warbling tune his praise.
&gt;&gt; Joyn voices all ye living souls, ye birds,
&gt;&gt; That singing up to heaven gate ascend,
&gt;&gt; Bear on your wings and in your notes his praise;

&gt;Now *this* is an interesting example. Notice that while fountains and
&gt;other flowing waters warble, the birds *sing* as they ascend up to
&gt;heaven gate. What kind of bird might Milton have associated with the
&gt;gate of heaven? Let's see what Shakespeare has to say about this. From
&gt;Cymbeline, II:iii:

&gt; Hearke, hearke, the Larke at heavens gate sings and Phoebus gins
&gt; arise...

&gt;And our old favorite, Sonnet 29:

&gt; Haply I thinke on thee, and then my state
&gt; (Like to the Larke at breake of daye arising)
&gt; From sullen earth sings himns at Heauens gate...

&gt;&gt; Any kind of bird:

&gt;&gt; Book 8, lines 261 ff
&gt;&gt; about me round I saw
&gt;&gt; Hill, dale, and shady woods, and sunny plains,
&gt;&gt; And liquid lapse of murmuring streams; by these,
&gt;&gt; Creatures that lived, and moved, and walked, or flew,
&gt;&gt; Birds on the branches warbling; all things smiled,
&gt;&gt; With fragrance and with joy my heart oreflowed.

&gt;Not any kind of bird. Many kinds of birds do not sing while sitting on
&gt;branches. Sky larks, for example.

&gt;&gt; So if you are going to insist on some specific image that Shakespeare
&gt;&gt; had in mind, at least do your homework.

&gt;I'll promise to do my homework if you'll promise to proofread your posts
&gt;before sending them. We were talking about Milton, remember? And I was
&gt;not insisting that he had any specific image in mind; quite the
&gt;contrary; I was pointing out that he clearly did *not* have one specific
&gt;image in mind, i.e., Shakespeare as a sky lark. As I noted above, you
&gt;evidently agree with me on this. What, exactly, are you arguing about?

You are just playing games Steese. You never came out and

Thus wore out night; and now the herald Lark

The Morn's approach, and greet her with his song.
-*Paradise Regain'd*, Book II, lines 279-281

And, if your stray attendance be yet lodged,

I won't be at all surprised to find pre-1750 examples of warbling
skylarks. If the truth be known, I made my initial statement about non-
warbling larks based on nothing more than a general impression. I am
actually a bit disconcerted, albeit gratified, that so far I haven't
found any counterexamples.

I have learned a great deal about the symbolism of the lark in English
poetry, so this debate has not been entirely frivolous. Anent Jim's
assertion that only bad poets use standard poetic figures, I was
interested to see that John Lyly used the trope of the lark singing at
heaven's gate before Shakespeare got ahold of it, and Shakespeare used
it before Milton got ahold of it.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; but I would be surprised if he thought of the lark as warbling &quot;native

&gt; a woodland bird. The lark has already appeared in &quot;l'Allegro&quot;:

&gt; To hear the lark begin his flight,

Milton's allusions to larks in &quot;Paradise Regain'd&quot; and &quot;Comus&quot;
demonstrate that he was familiar with the lark's habitat, which
strengthens the inference that the Shakespeare-bird is no lark.

Not everything, true. That was exaggeration on my part. But a letter
here, and a space there, can completely change meaning. You can go

&gt;[snip]
&gt;&gt;&gt;It is demonstrably untrue that sky larks warble in English poetry
&gt;&gt;&gt;written prior to 1750. Thus, your suggestion that Milton may have
&gt;&gt;&gt;been comparing Shakespeare to a sky lark is wrong.

&gt;&gt; That's ridiculous. IF Milton had a particular bird in mind when
&gt;&gt; he wrote those lines (and a particular bird, a thrush, is Terry Ross's
&gt;&gt; assertion, not mine)

&gt;Terry said that it was a songbird, *probably* a thrush. He did not
&gt;assert that it *was* a thrush. Moreover, a thrush is not &quot;a particular
&gt;bird,&quot; but rather any of numerous particular birds.

"/>

What he said, repeatedly, was that it was a thrush. If he meant
a particular sub-species of thrush, or the group of thrushes as
a whole is irrelevant. Here is what he said in three different
posts:

======================================================
&quot;The contrast is not just between &quot;learned&quot; and &quot;wilde&quot; but metaphorically
between a comic actor (the &quot;sock&quot; is work not by the author of a comedy
but by the players) and a non-human performer, a bird of the woods (a
thrush, I imagine).&quot;

&quot;&quot;Sock&quot; strictly speaking applies to the player; metaphorically to the
author (just as Shakespeare's warbling strictly speaking applies to a
performing thrush and metaphorically to the author).&quot;

&quot;The comic playwright Shakespeare is also
described as a performer, but not an actor. What kind of creature

1. warbles
2. is native to the woods
3. is wild

-- a bird, obviously, and I think probably a thrush of some kind.&quot;
==============================================

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; there is no reason it couldn't have been a lark, since larks sing, and
&gt;&gt; all birds that sing warble, and he mentioned a lark earlier in the
&gt;&gt; poem.

&gt;Unfortunately, you have not yet demonstrated that &quot;all birds that sing
&gt;warble.&quot;

"/>

And how would I &quot;demonstrate&quot; it? I could point you to web sites
with bird songs and you can hear the warbling yourself, but it
is self-evident, since &quot;warbling&quot; is just rapid trilling or other
ornamentation of a melody. Not all birds sing, but all birds that
sing, warble.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Not that it matters. I have already pointed out other reasons
&gt;why Milton did not have a lark in mind:

&gt;a) larks sing while in flight
&gt;b) larks are associated with the break of day

"/>

You can't possibly know exactly what Milton had in
mind, all you can state is that he didn't allude explicitly
to the lark in the usual fashion in the lines on Shakespeare.
But he didn't allude to any other specific bird either. What
we do know from the other quotes from Milton that I
posted is that Milton knew that many things could
warble, including birds in general, streams and brooks,
and people. So he probably had in mind any number
of things, *including* larks.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Terry and David Webb have pointed out another reason:

&gt;c) larks are grassland birds; Milton refers to &quot;wood-notes&quot;

"/>

Ah yes, and of course Shakespeare only lived in the woods.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;You have focused on the warbling and ignored the other points. The fact
&gt;is that *if* Milton had a specific bird in mind, it was *not* a sky
&gt;lark, for the reasons noted above.

"/>

I have focused on the warbling because that is the only word
in those lines that could indicate that Milton had some kind
of bird in mind.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Steese, this kind of rigid analysis is why so many people hated
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; their high school English courses!

&gt;&gt;&gt;And I imagine you'll post evidence to support that claim right after
&gt;&gt;&gt;you get around to backing up your assertion that the only people
&gt;&gt;&gt;buying Francis Bacon's books are college students.

&gt;&gt; College students who are taking a course that requires it,
&gt;&gt; professors studying the history of philosophy and/or science,
&gt;&gt; and nuts looking for secret codes and other nuts who want to believe
&gt;&gt; that Bacon wrote Shakespeare's work.

&gt;And we eagerly await your evidence in support of this emended claim.

"/>

My original assertion was not a &quot;claim&quot;, it was sarcasm. I have
read enough in the history of science to know that Bacon is a minor
figure only.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;[snip]
&gt;&gt;&gt;Terry said he thought the bird was *probably* a thrush, and you
&gt;&gt;&gt;disagreed with him. Instead of simply stating your opinion that
&gt;&gt;&gt;Milton had no specific bird in mind, you suggested alternative birds.

&gt;&gt; Sure, but not because I believe that he had a particular bird in
&gt;&gt; mind, because I thought it was silly to think he had one in mind, and
&gt;&gt; if you are going to propose a bird, why not a nightingale or a lark
&gt;&gt; rather than a thrush?

&gt;For the reasons Terry, David Webb, and I have pointed out.

"/>

None of which are very convincing.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;Now, so far as I'm concerned there is nothing to argue about in your
&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;no specific bird&quot; opinion, but your alternatives were highly
&gt;&gt;&gt;debatable.

&gt;&gt; Please. If there is nothing to argue about, why didn't you point
&gt;&gt; it out until now? You've spent all this time trying to negate my
&gt;&gt; alternatives to Terry's thrush, without once saying, AS I BELIEVE,
&gt;&gt; that he had no specific bird in mind, until now.

&gt;Please read for comprehension. I didn't say that I agreed with your
&gt;assertion that Milton had no specific bird in mind. I said that I don't
&gt;know whether he did or not. My point was simply that your expressed
&gt;opinion is inarguably your opinion, and since it rests solely on your
&gt;belief, there is no arguing with it. When you introduce factual
&gt;questions (why not this bird, or that?), you provide arguable content.

&gt;&gt;&gt;I pointed out that your initial suggestion of a nightingale was
&gt;&gt;&gt;improbable,

&gt;&gt; To which I replied, &quot;quite right&quot;, because of its association
&gt;&gt; with night and its presence in Il Penseroso. But what Milton had in
&gt;&gt; mind when he wrote about Shakespeare warbling was anything and
&gt;&gt; everything that could sing, including nightingales, larks, babbling
&gt;&gt; brooks, and people singing.

&gt;And once again you perform astonishing feats of mentalism and reveal
&gt;what Milton had in mind.

"/>

It isn't mentalism. I gave many quotes from Milton's other poems
to show the kinds of things that he thought could warble, including
birds, brooks and people.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;and your revised suggestion that he might have been thinking
&gt;&gt;&gt;of a lark was equally improbable. As you have not tried to defend
&gt;&gt;&gt;either suggestion, I gather that you concur.

&gt;&gt; Sorry Steese, but IF you are going to propose a specific bird,
&gt;&gt; a lark seems to me more likely than a thrush, since thrushes
&gt;&gt; are not alluded to at all in the poem, but the lark is, and larks
&gt;&gt; warble.

&gt;Regardless of whether pre-1750 poets had larks warble (and I'm still
&gt;looking for an example), larks are grassland birds, not warblers of
&gt;native wood-notes wild.

"/>

They are, if &quot;native wood-notes&quot; is taken to mean metaphorically
&quot;of nature&quot;, unless you want me to believe that Milton thought
that Shakespeare lived in the woods.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; What he had in mind was the lyric, song-like nature of Shakespeare's
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; verse, and the consonantal echo involving &quot;warble&quot;, &quot;wood&quot; and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;wild&quot;.

&gt;&gt;&gt;I don't see any reason why you should be granted special insight into
&gt;&gt;&gt;what Milton &quot;had in mind,&quot; and given that you've criticized me for
&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;trying to turn these poems into cartoons,&quot; your suggestion that
&gt;&gt;&gt; Milton cared more about alliteration than meaning is a bit puzzling.

&gt;&gt; I didn't say that Milton cared about alliteration more than meaning.

&gt;It was suggested by what you wrote, hence my use of the word
&gt;'suggestion.'

"/>

And you complain about me &quot;misreading&quot;. Nowhere did I express
any opinion on Milton's preference.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Alliteration is one consideration, and a major one for a poet.
&gt;&gt; But Milton's meaning is not defined by a single bird in this instance.

&gt;This is an interesting example of begging the question.

"/>

No, it's not, because no definite type of bird is alluded to in the lines
in question, in fact, he might not be alluding to a bird at all,
but a stream flowing through the woods. I think it's probable
that he had all of the things I mentioned before in mind.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; He is likening the quality of Shakespeare's verse to singing in
&gt;&gt; general, and the examples from his other verse that I provided
&gt;&gt; show that he thought birds in general can warble,

&gt;No; they show that he associated warbling with birds who perch on
&gt;branches, nightingales, and an unnamed &quot;night-warbling bird.&quot; Larks do
&gt;not sing while perched on branches, they are not nightingales, and they
&gt;do not sing at night.

"/>

You missed one:
PL Book 5, lines 195 ff
Fountains and ye, that warble, as ye flow,
Melodious murmurs, warbling tune his praise.
Joyn voices all ye living souls, ye birds,
That singing up to heaven gate ascend,
Bear on your wings and in your notes his praise;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;You advised me earlier to 'do my homework.' It evidently didn't occur
&gt;to you that I might have already looked up references to *larks* in
&gt;Milton, rather than references to warbling:

&gt;Thus wore out night; and now the herald Lark
&gt;Left his ground-nest, high towering to descry
&gt;The Morn's approach, and greet her with his song.
&gt; -*Paradise Regain'd*, Book II, lines 279-281

&gt;And, if your stray attendance be yet lodged,
&gt;Or shroud within these limits, I shall know
&gt;Ere morrow wake, or the low-roosted lark
&gt;From her thatched pallet rouse.
&gt; -*Comus*

&gt;Milton knew that larks are ground-nesting birds of open grasslands.

"/>

Which couldn't apply to Shakespeare, because Shakespeare, as
we all know, lived in the woods.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; so can a running stream or brook, so can people. Now the image of
&gt;&gt; a Shakespeare who can &quot;warble his native wood-notes wild&quot;
&gt;&gt; makes perfect sense. Milton obviously associated &quot;warbling&quot;
&gt;&gt; with the natural world of birds and streams, and country
&gt;&gt; people singing to conjure up their gods, so the association
&gt;&gt; of &quot;warble&quot; with &quot;native&quot;, &quot;wood-notes&quot; and &quot;wild&quot; tells us

Agreed. I've been wanting to say that too, but was much too polite. :) A
propos of nothing, as usual, I heard a bird with a lovely voice in Baltimore
when a friend and I were sitting under a tree down by the harbour. Terry
later told us that it must have been a mockingbird. My first mockingbird! I
was so excited.

When I think of Shakespeare and his wood-notes wild, I always think of
nightingales and larks. I believe it is only because of R and J's dialogue
about whether it is day or night: &quot;It was the nightingale, and not the lark,
that pierc'd the fearful hollow of thine ear...&quot; Etc. Nothing to do with
warbling.

How do you think that helps your case? Milton uses warbling to refer to
fountains and flowing things (e.g., brooks), full stop, *and switches to a
different verb* when the living souls enter the picture. These particular
birds, which do not warble, sing as they ascend up to heaven gate, which is
a good indication that he had larks in mind (as is the reference to living
souls -- the skylark was used as a metaphor for the human soul ascending
after death).

That strikes me as very similar to the anti-Shakespearean style of

find your argument that Milton was thinking some warbling chimerical

implausible.

As long as we're completely off-topic, I've always loved Northern
Mockingbirds. However, many in my home town were less enamored of the
birds than I, in large part because during breeding season the birds
will often sing ceaselessly in the hours past midnight but well before
dawn. I'm always stunned as much by the originality of their material
as by the accuracy of their rendition of even complex borrowed material
(I've heard them imitate the Wood Thrush beautifully, although in some
more urban locales they imitate car alarms with uncanny verisimilitude).

Steese, I've had enough of this. There's no reason why &quot;wood-notes&quot; could
not mean nature in general, and there is no reason that &quot;wood-notes&quot; *must*
refer only to birds the live in the woods.

The lines from Milton are:

&quot;Or sweet Shakespeare, fancy's child,
Warble his native wood-notes wild.&quot;

There is nothing here that alludes to a specific bird. What Milton alludes
to is SONG. Specifically, the song-like character of Shakespeare's
verse. Milton in his other poems finds that birds, brooks, springs and
people can sing and warble, therefore it is logical to assume that
he had, in the back of his mind, all or some those things in mind when he said
that Shakespeare could &quot;warble&quot;. The train of connections is

Shakespeare-----------&gt; singing (not Shakespeare---------------&gt;bird), and
then singing------------&gt;birds, brooks, people; and then
| birds--------------------&gt;larks, nightingales, any birds that sing and
----| brooks----------------&gt;any of the brooks or streams that he knew
| people---------------&gt;the singing of groups and individuals and
individual singer--------------------&gt; Shakespeare

And all of this has to fit into

Rhyme with &quot;child&quot;----------------&gt;&quot;wild&quot;
&quot;wild&quot;---------------&gt; nature
nature-----------&gt; the woods
the woods-----------------&gt;&quot;wood-notes&quot;
alliteration with &quot;wood&quot;-----------------&gt;&quot;warble&quot; and
&quot;warble&quot;----------------&gt;singing, which also connects to &quot;notes&quot;.

That seems to me to be a reasonable conjecture of how the
general thought process went, but of course all of this could
happen unconsciously in an instant. But this is the poet's
point of view, not the pedant's. The pedant will try mightily
to shoe horn a thrush and only a thrush into these lines, but
that simply limits the lines to something other than what
the poet intended.

If I had lost the argument even once, it would have been reasonable for

Unfortunately for your case, there is no such thing as &quot;the&quot; pedant or
&quot;the&quot; poet. It is in my opinion absurd to suppose that you, or anyone,
could reconstruct Milton's thought processes, much less a pedant's.
Indeed, as your posts show no whiff of either poetry or pedantry, I am
not inclined to agree with your point of view. Still, it is your point
of view, and you are entitled to it.

The only thing I remain curious about is your ill-will toward Terry
Ross. Ill-will toward me is understandable, but why Terry? He is the
most courteous of posters, and a scholar of genuine accomplishments; why
do you tar him with the grossly inaccurate label 'pedant'?

I don't have any ill will toward Terry. I just think the idea

is silly.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Most Oxfordian arguments begin as Baconian arguments to which a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; search-and-replace has been done (for &quot;Bacon&quot; read &quot;Oxford&quot;). While a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; pretty good case can be made for Bacon's extraordinary erudition, the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Oxfordian case has to be dummed down a bit, as fits the candidate. Thus
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Mark Twain could speak of the &quot;real author&quot; as having had the greatest
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; legal mind of his era, which might describe Bacon, but is just silly when
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; applied to Oxford. For Oxford the argument is reduced to &quot;attended Gray's
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; inn for a bit,&quot; which translates to &quot;must have picked up SOMETHING of the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; law.&quot; Similarly, Bacon's actual writings reveal a brilliant thinker and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and accomplished prose stylist; Oxford's actual writings are negligible,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; revealing a minor poet capapable of the occasional good line.

&gt;&gt;&gt; This, of course, isn't so helpful. ;)

&gt;&gt; But Terry makes a good point, whether or not you find it &quot;helpful.&quot;
&gt;&gt; I know of no evidence that Oxford had a keen legal mind. Nor do I know
&gt;&gt; of any indication of Oxford's supposed erudition (unless one supposes at
&gt;&gt; the outset that he wrote the Shakespeare canon). Finally, I know of no
&gt;&gt; evidence that Oxford was an accomplished prose stylist. His letters do
&gt;&gt; not suggest as much. His verse is, as Terry noted, that of a minor
&gt;&gt; court poet, capable of occasional felicities, but also of monstrosities
&gt;&gt; like the rhythmically plodding and relentlessly alliterative

&gt;&gt; Fain would I sing but fury makes me fret,
&gt;&gt; And rage hath sworn to seek revenge of wrong;
&gt;&gt; My mazed mind in malice is so set,
&gt;&gt; As death shall daunt my deadly dolours long;
&gt;&gt; Patience perforce is such a pinching pain,
&gt;&gt; [...]

&gt;&gt; or his wretched, extended metaphor of love as a tennis game.

&gt;&gt; So tell me, Lynne, what IS the evidence, if any, of Oxford's legal
&gt;&gt; mind? What IS the evidence, if any, for his supposedly extraordinary
&gt;&gt; erudition? What IS the evidence, if any, that Oxford was either an
&gt;&gt; accomplished prose stylist or a poet of genius? Note that I am not
&gt;&gt; asserting that YOU have necessarily claimed that Oxford was erudite,
&gt;&gt; that he had a keen legal mind, or that he was a magisterial prose
&gt;&gt; stylist or poet, but one hears these assertions so routinely from
&gt;&gt; Oxfordians that I am curious whether you concur with of the Oxfordian
&gt;&gt;&quot;search-and-replace&quot; adaptations of old Baconian arguments to which
&gt;&gt; Terry alludes above.

&gt; To be a little more serious, but very hasty:

&gt; We have some evidence of Oxford's legal mind, apart from the fact he
&gt; attended Gray's Inn. See Regnier's article ((University of Miami Law
&gt; Review, Volume 57, Number 2, January 2003). The plays require legal
&gt; knowledge and an ability to read legal documents in the original
&gt; language as some of them weren't translated, and Oxford had that
&gt; ability. To my knowledge, no one except Twain has suggested that
&gt; Shakespeare had to be the greatest legal mind of his era, and I've
&gt; often heard Stratfordians say it wasn't necessary to have any
&gt; specialised legal knowledge--don't agree with this, by the way--so I
&gt; think the article I've given will suffice. One can't have it both
&gt; ways, saying that Shakespeare didn't need special legal training
&gt; because Shakespeare of Stratford couldn't have had any, and then
&gt; asking me to prove Oxford was the greatest legal mind of his time.

"/>

Writers are inventive, creative, and able to borrow whatever they need.
A pound of flesh is the fancy of a writer, not a lawyer.

BUT IF EXPERIENCE WITH LAW were a factor,
Shakespeare had far more known court proceedings than did Oxford,
so if that's your angle, Will knew the lingo better. He both sued and
was sued. Oxford was excused from his crimes (murder, pederasty,
treason, ...) so that he hasn't many known days in a trial. Okay,
he was sent to the Tower for impregnating the Queen's lady in waiting,
but you won't find that sort of language for that sort of crime in the plays.

His law degree was bestowed upon him as a teenager, so let's get real: did
he even so much as attend any classes? He never practiced law or gave
any legal advice of which we are aware. He broke more laws than he ever
interpreted/administered/upheld/defended.

Oxford's legal mind? I think not. Lawyers who are caught today in his
situations are disbarred (in civilized jurisdictions.) I don't think he showed
any legal expertise in his life, and I think it is your forced conclusion to say
the plays required a legal mind. Writing trumps law, just as writing trumps
any subject matter in the world (because the play IS the thing).

Oxfordians would have a better shot if they could start showing any
likelihood that Oxford was something of a source or an inspiration or
a consultant or just some subject matter. Writer? That seems impossible
considering that hard-working Lynne has nuthin' and she is as delightful
and informed as any Oxfordian we've ever met here.

We had that analyzed by a French teacher about 5 years ago (who was

French to 14 year olds for the past 30 years, the teacher saw right

accomplishing his studies. (Are you familiar with the letter, Lynne?)
That is the story of the earl's life--success without effort, failure when

More what? You were speaking of erudition and wound up with
the kid's curiosity. That's nothing as momentous as Ben Jonson
saying that William Shakespeare &quot;was (indeed) honest, and of an
open, and free nature: had an excellent fancy; brave notions, and
gentle expressions&quot;. (Laughing at how gentle an expression it would
be to impale a busboy and cost his wife and family their breadwinner
because YOUR SAME Burghley called Brincknell's murder a suicide.)

You're talking about a teenager being praised by his guardian. He
sounds to be getting the fast track, just like special athletes get because
they don't need the education for their success ( = Oxford never
practiced law).

The Poet Laureate of England (I know he wasn't named such, just
his successors in the position were) is talking about a WRITER.

No contest, Lynne....
Especially in light of the fact that Jonson
said Shakespeare was deficient in Latin and Greek. (I know you
evade that one because it is not a good point for your
supposedly erudite earl--but please stop pretending your reason is
my manners--I use the very same facts found in libraries all over
