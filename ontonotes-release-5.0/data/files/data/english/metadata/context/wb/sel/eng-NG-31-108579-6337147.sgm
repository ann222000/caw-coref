I want to ask my dentist in town to share the X-rays and results with a
dentist nearer to me.  What is the proper way to approach this?  I don't
want to ruffle any feathers, but I do want to see if the dentist closer to
me has lower prices for re-doing some ancient fillings.  The dentist in
town uses a laser for small cavities.  I want to see if I can have the
dentist with the laser fill the small cavities in front and do the
"cosmetic" parts of what I need done.  How do I go about letting both of
these dentists know that I want to "use" each one for different things
without upsetting either one of them?

The dentist in town is extravagantly expensive, I think.  I have an
appointment with his dental hygienist next month.  I have an appointment
for a consultation with the dentist nearer to me in March.

Do dentists get insulted by this kind of thing?  I want to handle this in
a professional manner and need a little advice about how to tell them.
I'm sort of a timid person, but I need to stand up for myself here and
insist on doing this my way.

Thanks in advance for any advice you have.

couple of things.
a laser is not going to give you any kind of advantage over the modern
drill. In fact it will take longer to explode away the decayed tooth
structure.
having a second dentist treat you, you may find a considerable
difference in philosophy and the amount of work that is recommended to
be done. If you are happy with your current dentist and the only thing
that is stopping you from continuing is cost on a few fillings, you may
find that taking a chance with someone else long term this may not be
the best cost savings. There are patients that switch for this reason
end up going to a cheaper clinic to then having to return to the
original dentist or someone else with far more work and problems.

That said if you still want to visit the other office, ask them to
obtain the records for you. But my advice is to stick to one office it
makes things a lot easier for warranty purposes and you are dealing
with somebody who knows your mouth.

They shouldn't.  You are entitled to a copy of your records (including
x-rays) and a reasonable fee for copying may be charged.  You need not
explain why, and any dentist who would be insulted IMO is a fool.
I agree with Alex about the laser, BTW.

I was talking with my brother in law who is a lawyer in personal injury
and he was telling me that there was a case ruling that the original
records are the property of the patient. In fact there was a case he
mentioned where the original records were demanded by the plantif and
the doctor did not want to give up the originals. the lawyer went to
the judge and the judge placed a "body attachment warrant" on the
doctor. I am told that a body attachment means the sheriff will
actively search for the person and take them to jail in their underwear
vs a bench warrant where they wait for the person to be pulled over for
minor traffic violation etc... This is another good reason to go
paperless and digital x-rays, this way both parties maintain identical
electronic records.
As far as I know from the dental practice act, doctor offices are
allowed to charge a moderate fee for duplication of records.
The issue here with duplicates vs originals is that when it comes to
x-rays duplicate films are not the same quality as originals and
sometimes this gets difficult because the originals deteriorate over
time due to improper fixer time. and making a duplicate of a
deteriorating original is even worse quality. Problem may arise if an
insurance company wants to re-question a benefit payment and they ask
to see the x-rays and the doctor then can not send them the same
quality x-ray as original which may contain critical detail such as
subtle decay explaining the procedure. Digital x-rays solves this
problem although it requires software and hardware and database back-up
maintenance which is still currently expensive. Therefore I do not
forsee the modest duplicating fee disappearing anytime soon.

Alex--

This is the first I've heard of this.  Of course dental practice law
may differ in California, but just a few months ago I took the web-based
risk management course offered by the NYSDA, and it said in no uncertain
terms that here the records were the property of the practice (so if the
practice is sold, it belongs to the practice, and retiring dentists had
to provide for access to the records).
Of course, in this day of warrentless searches (yeah, I know, they're
stopping that) and the executive branch searching congressmen's offices,
things could change.

the lawyer went to

I agree.  From a practical standpoint though, if a patient of mine
leaves frequently I don't have a FMX-ray series under a year old, and
the new dentist is going to want to take a new one.  I've never had
copies rejected in 30 years though, and I have no illusions that this
had anything to do with the quality of the copies.

The records of the patient belong to the PRACTICE. However, a copy of
the entire record MUST be given to the patient. A nominal fee for
copying,$25USD, is allowed. However if the pt. will not pay the copying
fee, the office MUST still provide the copy. The ruling is for the
consumer, but also protects the dentist by allowing to keep the originals.

Forgive the top posting.  I'm responding through google groups because
your original message does not show up in my dinosaur newsreader.  I
could only see responses to your post.

I'm curious about your statement that the laser will take longer to
"explode" (geez, does it have to explode??) the decayed part of the
tooth.  In my understanding, the laser is painless and doesn't require
numbing.  Does the fact that it will take longer affect the quality of
the work done?

I appreciate your response, and I am trying to figure out which dentist
to use.  My niece has gone to the first dentist since she was very
little, and he has been very good to her and has not caused her to be
afraid like I am.  Maybe you can tell me what you think of his prices
-- I have an estimate here in front of me.  The first item is "onlay 4
surf (porcelain) -- $1,101.00."  Is this a good price?  I think that
just means replace an old filling -- yes?

I'm trying to do my homework.  Cost is important.  I'm on early
retirement and get a small pension.  I was forced out before I reached
full retirement because I was sick a lot with Meniere's Disease.  OK,
sad story over -- back to basics.  I want to get my teeth fixed if I
can.  I am going to have numbers 21, 28, and 29 removed by an oral
surgeon the first week of February.  I went to see him today, and he
gave me a price of $860.  Sounds reasonable since I will be in la-la
land and won't have to go through the procedure awake.  He says my
other teeth are good -- look strong -- and should be fixable.  Trouble
is -- I'm looking at about $7,000 that would wipe me out.  So I really
need to research prices.

Whatever advice/help you can offer is very much appreciated.  This
whole thing gives me a headache.  The problems are my fault -- stayed
away from dentists a long time because of fear and some bad treatment.
I found a good one -- very skilled, but not a nice man.  He scared me
away again, and now I'm losing these three teeth that could've been
saved if I hadn't been so scared.  Now that you've read this whole long
message (at least I hope you have), can you advise me?

Thank you, Eva

Eva:

I'm sure Alex can speak for himself, but the "explode" part is a
bit...florid.  There is a popping noise from water particles being
energized.  Laser advocates say it is pain free, but I've gotten
differing opinions.  Since you are not using pressure as you would with
a drill there is little heat generation within the substance of the
tooth.  I doubt very much that it would be totally pain-free, esp. if
you're close to the nerve, but there may well be an advantage.
Still, I look at it this way.  Even if the pain is less, to be totally
relaxed you will want to know you will have no pain, and there's no way
to guarantee that without local anesthesia if the patient is conscious.
Once you have well-administered anesthesia, it doesn't matter from a
pain standpoint whether you're using a laser for decay removal or a
low-speed handpiece with a #8 round bur.  I can equip my operatory with
handpieces for a couple of thousand bucks.  The laser may be $20-30K.
There is nothing you can do on hard tissue with a laser that you can't
do with a high-speed and a low-speed air driven handpieces more quickly
and obviously more cheaply.  If money is a concern, I would go for
solid, well-done restorative dentistry and skip the ray gun razzle dazzle.
Call me an old fart--I'll pass on the laser.

I like top posting. &lt;G&gt;

Anyway, I'm an old fart *with* a laser.

IME, (other laser 'experts' may disagree with me) 'laser anesthesia'
is a bunch of crap.  Like Dr. Steve says, it is a less traumatic
method of removing decay and tooth structure, but it is *not* pain
free.  Most of the time that I use it, patients are numb.

There are definitely patients who need little (and even no) anesthesia
for dental treatment.  In a metro area, there are probably
thousands of people who would rather not be numbed for most dental
treatment.  With a laser, these people will be very happy.  They are
likely to believe it is the magic of the laser, but it is probably
more within their own nervous system.  IME, most people will still need
anesthesia.

Advantages of the laser:

It does not induce cracks into the enamel as it cuts.

Patients like not feeling vibration and pressure.

I can trim soft tissue with very little hemorrhage.

The lased surface is supposed to bond better to filling material.

The laser actually destroys bacteria as it works.

Disadvantages:

Initial expense (my Waterlase was ~$50K).

It does cut slower than a bur.

It won't cut amalgam (or other metal).

It does not live up to the hype put out by the laser companies.

I love it for decay along the gum line and most restorations on
anterior teeth.  I don't like it for occlusal or interproximal
decay on posterior teeth.

After all of that, I don't think your decision on which dentist
to 'trust' should come down to the laser or other pieces of
equipment.

Cost of treatment (though a very real issue) is also seldom a great
factor when determining quality of care.

As a lay person trying to judge dentists, you are at a distinct

&gt;&gt; I'm curious about your statement that the laser will take longer to
&gt;&gt; &quot;explode&quot; (geez, does it have to explode??) the decayed part of the
&gt;&gt; tooth.  In my understanding, the laser is painless and doesn't require
&gt;&gt; numbing.  Does the fact that it will take longer affect the quality of
&gt;&gt; the work done?

&gt;&gt; I appreciate your response, and I am trying to figure out which dentist
&gt;&gt; to use.  My niece has gone to the first dentist since she was very
&gt;&gt; little, and he has been very good to her and has not caused her to be
&gt;&gt; afraid like I am.  Maybe you can tell me what you think of his prices
&gt;&gt; -- I have an estimate here in front of me.  The first item is &quot;onlay 4
&gt;&gt; surf (porcelain) -- $1,101.00.&quot;  Is this a good price?  I think that
&gt;&gt; just means replace an old filling -- yes?
&gt;&gt; Whatever advice/help you can offer is very much appreciated.  This
&gt;&gt; whole thing gives me a headache.  The problems are my fault -- stayed
&gt;&gt; away from dentists a long time because of fear and some bad treatment.
&gt;&gt; I found a good one -- very skilled, but not a nice man.  He scared me
&gt;&gt; away again, and now I'm losing these three teeth that could've been
&gt;&gt; saved if I hadn't been so scared.  Now that you've read this whole long
&gt;&gt; message (at least I hope you have), can you advise me?

&gt;&gt; Thank you, Eva
&gt;     Still, I look at it this way.  Even if the pain is less, to be
&gt; totally relaxed you will want to know you will have no pain, and there's
&gt; no way to guarantee that without local anesthesia if the patient is
&gt; conscious.  Once you have well-administered anesthesia, it doesn't
&gt; matter from a pain standpoint whether you're using a laser for decay
&gt; removal or a low-speed handpiece with a #8 round bur.  I can equip my
&gt; operatory with handpieces for a couple of thousand bucks.  The laser may
&gt; be $20-30K. There is nothing you can do on hard tissue with a laser that
&gt; you can't do with a high-speed and a low-speed air driven handpieces
&gt; more quickly and obviously more cheaply.  If money is a concern, I would
&gt; go for solid, well-done restorative dentistry and skip the ray gun

&gt; It does not induce cracks into the enamel as it cuts.

&gt; Patients like not feeling vibration and pressure.

&gt; I love it for decay along the gum line and most restorations on

I imagine the thing about better bond strengths is because the laser

I have no idea where I fall into these categories.  I don't know if I
could take this treatment without being numb.  My biggest problem is fear.
When I went to the oral surgeon -- just to talk -- they took my blood
pressure, and it was 144/71.  I have never, ever registered that high in
my life.  The highest reading I've ever seen, when I was rushing to get to
an appointment on time, was 120/70.  My normal is 100/70 -- right where it
should be.  I wonder if my fear will make me think I'm feeling more pain.

I would like that part.  Does this laser make a loud noise?  Since I have
Meniere's Disease, one of the most distressing things for my hyperacusis

Egad.  How do I gain an advantage then in making this decision?  There
must be a way for a lay person to choose the best dentist.  I do know of a

barely felt it at all.  That leads me to the question of skill being
measured by the way a dentist gives a shot.  If he can do it without my
feeling it, does this always mean that he has more skill?  This dentist
I'm considering -- the one with the laser -- uses this vibrator.  An
assistant holds the vibrator on my face while he gives me a shot.  If the
metal syringe touches my teeth when this thing is vibrating, it drives me
nuts!  And why is he using a metal syringe?  I thought those were

Eva--

I might have top-posted too, but decided not to.  Dartos (the other
Steve) should answer the bulk of your questions, since he's laser-guy.
An onlay is generally an indirect filling (IOW, it isn't formed like
amalgam or resin just placed in the prepared tooth--an impression is
taken or the tooth is scanned in a machine like a CEREC) that covers the
chewing prominences (cusps) of the back teeth.
This vibrator thing I know nothing about--sounds intriguing!  Back in
dental school we had an instructor who would grab the patient's cheek,
retract and shake the living daylights out of the cheek.  I figure it's
some kind of distraction technique.
As far as metal syringes, for some reason as local anesthesia developed
in dentistry we use reusable (sterilizable) metal syringes and
disposable single-dose cartridges of anesthetic, and a disposable
needle.  This is probably just tradition, but it's convenient.  When I
was a resident if I had to use anesthetic in the emergency room we
generally used disposable syringes and a multidose vial of anesthetic.

Yes, there is supposed to be no smear layer.  But for SE Bond,
isn't the smear layer part of the process?  IOWs, I don't know
composite bonds better with all systems (or even any).  With 4.5
loupes, the surface is certainly 'rough' before etching or
'conditioning'.

I remember you posting a photo of you in your telescopes, but I don't
remember them being the long ones.  I'm still using my 2.5s, Mark is
using about what you're using (he's so competitive--"mine's longer than
yours).
I use Pentron "Bond-1--I haven't worried much about what happens to the

Oh, thanks for the info on that.  I felt like I was in the dark ages when
I saw the metal syringe.  I wanted to get up and run away.  It seems to me
that dentists need to work on the environment they set up for a patient to
endure.  Scary things like metal syringes should be updated.  I know there
are lots of people like me who are scared of dentists.  But it also seems
that dentists are fairly unaware of this.  Why is that?  How can they not
know how scary they are?  I'm sure you don't mean to scare people, but
there it is.  OK, now I'm just venting I guess.

&gt;&gt; developed in dentistry we use reusable (sterilizable) metal syringes
&gt;&gt; and disposable single-dose cartridges of anesthetic, and a disposable
&gt;&gt; needle. This is probably just tradition, but it's convenient.  When I
&gt;&gt; was a resident if I had to use anesthetic in the emergency room we
&gt;&gt; generally used disposable syringes and a multidose vial of anesthetic.

&gt; Oh, thanks for the info on that.  I felt like I was in the dark ages
&gt; when I saw the metal syringe.  I wanted to get up and run away.  It
&gt; seems to me that dentists need to work on the environment they set up
&gt; for a patient to endure.  Scary things like metal syringes should be
&gt; updated.  I know there are lots of people like me who are scared of
&gt; dentists.  But it also seems that dentists are fairly unaware of this.
&gt; Why is that?  How can they not know how scary they are?  I'm sure you
&gt; don't mean to scare people, but there it is.  OK, now I'm just venting I
&gt; guess.

I know I'M scary.  But is a plastic syringe really less scary than
steel?  After all, the needle is still steel.  Steel is real!!

1-10 &lt;g&gt;.  It depends on what I'm trying to do, the patients perception
of pain, the power level setting, and whether I've used any local
anesthesia.

IME, fear spikes quite rapidly when something is painful.  The more
it hurts, the greater the panic.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt; There are definitely patients who need little (and even no) anesthesia
&gt;&gt;&gt; for dental treatment.
&gt; I have no idea where I fall into these categories.  I don't know if I
&gt; could take this treatment without being numb.  My biggest problem is
&gt; fear. When I went to the oral surgeon -- just to talk -- they took my
&gt; blood pressure, and it was 144/71.  I have never, ever registered that
&gt; high in my life.  The highest reading I've ever seen, when I was rushing
&gt; to get to an appointment on time, was 120/70.  My normal is 100/70 --
&gt; right where it should be.  I wonder if my fear will make me think I'm
&gt; feeling more pain.
">

My guess is that it wouldn't be a great idea to find out how much you
could take without anesthesia.  I would probably recommend nitrous
oxide and plenty of local anesthetic before any treatment (laser or no).

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt; Advantages of the laser:

&gt;&gt;&gt; It does not induce cracks into the enamel as it cuts.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Patients like not feeling vibration and pressure.

&gt; I would like that part.  Does this laser make a loud noise?  Since I
&gt; have Meniere's Disease, one of the most distressing things for my
&gt; hyperacusis is hearing the drill sound.  I have to wear an ear plug if
&gt; they work on my left side.
">

The laser makes a popping noise.  It is certainly less shrill than
the drill.  Patients seem to not tense up quite as much (maybe
just because they have 'learned' that the drill may hurt and the
popping noises are not [so far] associated with pain).

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; That's exactly what I've got -- decay along the gum line on anterior
&gt; teeth.  I can see these little red spots along the bottom edge of my teeth
&gt; where they meet the gum.  The laser wouldn't apply to my posterior teeth
&gt; because they are the ones with old metal to be taken out and replaced.
&gt; You lose me with the technical terms occlusal and interproximal, tho.
">

I'm sure these areas could be treated with or without a laser.  The
laser is nice due to lack of pressure, less and different sound,
bleeding control, and *maybe* better bonding of the composite.

Occlusal=biting surface of posterior teeth.  Interproximal=between
the teeth.

Why are the metal filling being replaced?  Age alone is not a good
reason.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Egad.  How do I gain an advantage then in making this decision?
">

Friends and co-workers may be a good place to start.  Try to find
the difference between salesmanship and craftmanship.  Comfortable
delivery of local anesthesia is a big plus, but this may or may not
mean the rest of the treatment is excellent.  Usually I would throw
out the cheapest and most expensive.  Someone inbetween who doesn't
rush through appointments.  Busy, but under control.

If you e-mail me privately with your general location, I might
know of a particular dentist you might want to visit.

After I got the laser, I got a pair of 4.5s.  Laser work (since you
can't 'feel' anything, you need to see better) and endo
get the 4.5s.  Most other stuff is 2.5.

I use Bond-1 for all regular bonding.  Deep restorations, places
apt to bleed (even with no apparent bleeding, the application of
Bond-1 will often get it started...if it's oozing a little, it will
gush), and pedo usually get Clearfil SE.

Ummm, yes, the metal syringe is much scarier to me than a plastic one.  I
can't say exactly why.  I think a lot of people's fear of dentists comes
from how things look, sound, and smell in the office.  The appearance of
this huge, scary-looking metal syringe makes me panic.  The drill looks so
mean and dangerous.  I can't be the only one who thinks like this.  I walk
into a dentist's office, and the smell hits me.  It is unmistakable and is
associated with terror -- for me.

OK -- so it might not make sense.  But that's the way I see it.  Maybe
it's because the syringe looks so BIG -- I guess I think the needle will
be BIG, too.

If you're interested in a scared patient's point of view, here it is.
The equipment is daunting -- the atmosphere is scary as hell.  Here's this person
standing over you.  He holds all the power in his hands.  You are at his
mercy.  It's very intimidating.  It's one of the reasons I don't know how
to ask about the 2nd opinion.  I don't want anybody who might be slightly
ticked off at me holding a big metal syringe and coming at me with it.

Within the last year, I have had the 'opportunity' to use plastic
syringes.  It is much more difficult to control the plunger to
give a *slow*, steady injection (an extremely important aspect
of a comfortable 'shot').

I think there are some new designs on the market with composite
types of materials, but they were pretty expensive IIRC.

Just keep the syringes mainly out of sight.

One reason I have equipment that swings under the counter instead
of over the top of the patient.  Who wants to sit in the chair
staring at all of the equipment and instruments right in front of
them?

I think that's a great idea.  The appearance of some of the instruments is
scary in itself.  I should never be allowed to see what will be used on me
since I'm such a scaredy-cat.  Geez, once I was sitting there in the chair
ready to have a tooth pulled out, and they rolled in this cart with all
kinds of horrific looking stuff on it.  One dentist told me I had such a
low threshhold of pain that it was hard to work with me.  But I think it's
not pain -- it's fear.  He used to be angry if I made whimpering sounds.
He would stop what he was doing and ask if he was hurting me.  I'd say
"no."  Then I realized I had been making these noises just because the
fear had taken over my brain.  If only he had had a little more patience
and took the time to talk to me, I could've kept going to see him.  But he
didn't.  He yelled at me and made me cry.  Scared the crap outta me, too.
The new dentist understands that I might make these scared sounds, and he
says that's OK.  I am where I am now because the last dentist scared me so
much.  I stayed away from dentists for three years, and now I'm losing
three teeth that could've been saved had that dentist not destroyed my
trust in him.

Ummm, yes, I do blame him somewhat.  I also know that the majority of the
blame is mine.  It's not like he tied me up and locked me in a room
somewhere to keep me from going to the dentist.  But he did take an
already scared person and make the fear worse.  He didn't do me any
favors.  I don't think I'm projecting at all.  I have been completely

Sure it is.  It's also your prerogative to ignore the main reason I
posted anything at all and focus in on one off-the-cuff remark made in
a weak moment.  But that's OK.  Other people here have been very
helpful and understanding.  I've also said in here that the old dentist
was very skilled, but was sorely lacking in people skills.  My new
dentist was gentleman enough to say, "I apologize for my colleague's
bad behavior."  There are gazillions of really good and caring
dentists.  I just happened to run into one who was good but not very
caring at all.  If you don't think that a professional has some
responsibility in how his actions affect his patients, then we do
indeed disagree.
