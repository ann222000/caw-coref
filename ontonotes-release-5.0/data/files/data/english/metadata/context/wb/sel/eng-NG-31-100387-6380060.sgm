The 10 Worst Rap Album Covers Ever Made!

These are all real. (Feel free to search Amazon or Google for them.) They
have not been edited in any way except for size. If you click on them, they
will bring you to the full sized version. I highly recommend doing this
since you cannot truly appreciate these works of art at low resolution. They
are numbered in descending order from bad to worst.

10. Spice 1 - Amerikkka's Nightmare

This is the least intimidating rapper I have ever seen in my entire life.
Spice 1, what the hell kind of name is that? Does he have a posse of higher
numbered spices that combine to form a group known as the spice rack? I
think he is trying to look at the viewer but all the smoke from caused by
Amerikkka's oppression is blinding him. He appears to be speaking in front
of an American flag like some sort of rapper Patton. The guns and the straps
on his shoulders should be intimidating, but instead make him look like some
rejected Unreal Tournament model or a black extra from a Mad Max movie. I
think he's wearing some sort of sports jersey too. Never has anyone tried so
much to look hard and failed so utterly. If you are holding a Tec-9 and look
soft, it's time to get out of the rap game.

9. Hot Boyz - Let 'Em Burn

See if you can count the number of Photoshop filters in this image. Somebody
needs to talk to their prop department, because it looks like they are about
to be put to death in a bunch of salon hairdryers. The two rappers in the
middle look terribly bored, but they attempt to pose by gripping the wooden
chairs that they stole from someone's garage sale. I don't think the one on
the far left even knew that the picture was being taken. However, the real
hero is the one on the far right. Despite the fact that he is about to be
put to death for the crime of abusing image editing software, he still
manages to flash his bling at the camera. I don't know why fire is circling
their feet, but I like to imagine it is because a spark from their electric
chairs lit one gigantic collective fart unleashed by the group at the very
moment the executioner pulled the switch.

8. Kingpin Skinny Pimp - 2000 Rapdope Game

Nothing about the album comes close to making sense: not the album cover,
not the album name, and certainly not the rapper's name. If he had put
Kingpin at the end and used the other two works as adjectives, we might have
had something. Instead he just throws three random words on the cover to
piss everyone off. I guess the idea he had was some sort of futuristic
theme. Apparently in the year 2000, the entire landmass of America has been
reduced to the size of 5 city blocks. This explains how the Seattle Space
Needle and the Statue of Liberty can be seen in the same skyline. Wait, we
have a pyramid in there. What the hell is this, Total Recall? I guess
Rapdope Game is a stock, or maybe it's a futuristic blood sport. He's
already ripped off one Schwarzenegger movie, why not add the Running Man in
there as well? The best bit is what appears to be a plane flying into a
futuristic version of the twin towers while he nonchalantly puffs on his
cigar and enjoys the suit he lifted from a funeral home. Hopefully his next
album will be called 2001 Rapdope Game and feature him diving out of the top
floor of the building he is in and/or burning alive. The fact that it
contains a song called "Goldie of Concentration Camp" only raises more
questions that would require the use of heavy sedatives to answer.

7. Tec-9 - Straight from tha Ramp

Finally, a photograph that captures of the essence of New Orleans. You'd
think he'd be holding, oh I don't know, a Tec-9. This has to be the lowest
budget rap album cover ever made. I'm pretty sure they just took this
picture on a street corner, wrote on the photo with a magic marker, and then
copied it several times at a public library in order to make the necessary
number of covers. Tec-9 would buy a magazine for his AK-47 if he hadn't
spent his remaining money on a pair jean shorts and a red tank top. At last,
a cover that recalls the days when gangsta rap was just about killing people
and not about how much crap you owned or hoes you pimped.

6. Pimp Daddy - Still Pimpin'

When the ghetto genie isn't busy watching over New Orleans, he enjoys
sitting in a chair he borrowed from his grandmother's parlor and stomping
the area surrounding the Super Dome before it became lorded over by Tina
Turner and known as Thunderdome. I guess Pimp Daddy is featured twice on the
album to compensate for his name being so generic. As for the hat, I have no
clue. All I know is that you have to rub Tec-9's AK-47 to make Pimp Daddy
appear. He will then grant you 3 wishes, provided they are about crack, bass
beats, or fake diamond necklaces.
