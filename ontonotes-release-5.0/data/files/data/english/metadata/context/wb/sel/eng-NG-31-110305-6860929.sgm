Dear Parent,

Please be advised that on Tuesday, May 1, 2007, 8th graders will be
administered the New York State Science Test.  8th graders will report
to school at the regular time, while 6th and 7th graders will report
to school by following a two-hour bus delay schedule.  A summary of
bus arrival times is listed below:

8th graders - 7:50 a.m.

7th graders - 9:50 a.m.

6th graders - 9:50 a.m.

I encourage our students to eat a healthy and nutritious breakfast.

If you have any questions, please call the school.

Thank you.

Respectfully,
Steven Shuchat, Principal
