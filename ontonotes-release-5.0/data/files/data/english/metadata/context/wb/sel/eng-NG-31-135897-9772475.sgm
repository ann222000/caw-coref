Just picked up Vietcong 2 in a bargain bin. I was a great fan of the
original.

Vietcong 2 was panned a little by the fans, but I must say I don't see
why. It's very, very good. If you see it in a bargain bucket, get it.

very tense (like the original) and very unforgiving if you run and gun
as opposed to use tactics and stealth.

The first Vietcong still rates as one of my most favourite games, the sequel
I absolutely loathed.  Part of the reason may have been that it ran like
absolute crap on what was then a respectable system.  I may re-install it
and give it another go.

I keep getting this one mixed up with Men Of Valor.
I wish they'd do another part to it. To me, the other
game had clumsy controls, and I didn't like the
squad &quot;out of body&quot; thing. All of that was too
distracting for me to enjoy the game.

Oh common mitty! Vietcong 2 is awful - even more appalling than the
original.

My mate couldn't pay me to take it off his hands!

Thoroughly enjoying it.

Maybe it was too stuttery before? my kick ass PC can even run an AI
program to decipher &quot;johns&quot; posts while playing it. Almost.

Maybe I just don't play enough FPS to care enough anymore? OK, HL2 it isn't
(:-;), but its kind of fun.

Take it slow!

Love the Ozzie medic.

Vietcong 1 appalling???? It was a stunning game in terms of immersion
and tension. It had its flaws, but the bits it got right were superb.

I was thinking about Vietcong when playing Crysis - they should redo
it using the Crysis engine, and then do Predator...

Sometimes I'm not sure. When the gameplay/engine/sound are a good enough mix I
dont really notice after the initial &quot;wow&quot; factor. I mean Crysis looks
good (except for the LOD causing graphics to flicker in the distance)
but the gameplay and tension just isnt there. With vietcong they just
got everything right IMO - it was like playing Platoon.

Take Vietcong 2 for example. Certainly not the best engine, but does
what it does well. I am too busy concentrating on aiming and sneaking
around and marshalling my team to worry about some flat texture.

Hay Shawk:  Every Vietcong fan should rent the movie _Go Tell The
Spartans_, with Burt Lancaster.  This movie is without a doubt an
inspiration for the game, and keep a close eye on the several different
weapons shown, they exactly match those in the game, from the revolvers to
the greaseguns.  And it's a great movie!

I've taken on board everyone's points and I really did enjoy Vietcong
when I bought it (2003) but after a friend told me how to finish it
earlier this year (I never got past the final mass attack on the base) I
loaded it up back on the PC to play again and much as I loved it before
it was a painful experience graphically and I couldn't play it.

I know some can ignore this and perhaps that makes me shallow in gaming
terms but I just hated it.  Where I was immersed, scared, nervous, or
excited last time, all I could think of on the last play through was the
damn cardboard cut-out trees etc and there was absolutely no chance of
immersion or excitement.

Great game for its time but not now.  And other games of the same year
seem to have held up better too.  Look at COD or Max Payne 2, both of
which I can still pick up and play.

Its a bit like an old relative - you still love them but you have to
eventually admit that yes, they are starting to smell of urine  ;-)

And I'm not talking about doing it on the Crysis engine.  Far Cry
graphics would do me fine...

BTW - I'm only talking about the graphics - played quite a bit on the
quick missions and I'm *still* impressed how the non-scripted AI means
its different every time.

Seen it, enjoyed it and yes I see the inspiration.  My favourites are
still Platoon and We Were Soldiers.  Enjoyed seeing the conflict from
the other side in the latter.  Not enough of that - which is strange
seeing as they say the winners are the ones that write history...
