I've been reading the article on B.F.Skinner's 1943 pigeon experiment
for which Kellie provided a link in a post. Unfortunately, I don't
have it with me here at work, but hopefully I can explain my question
without mangling the terminology too much.

The word &quot;shaping&quot; appears several times in the article without
qualifiers, and is defined as associated with &quot;successive
approximations&quot;. The term &quot;approximation&quot; is not defined in the
article, but it clearly means an offered approximation.

In addition to &quot;shaping&quot; appearing by itself, it also is frequently
qualified as &quot;hand shaping&quot;, and occasionally as &quot;free-form hand
shaping&quot;.

If I understood the article correctly, the phrase &quot;hand shaping&quot; is
intended to distinguish the way Skinner's team shaped the pigeon in
contrast to setting up a machine that is activated by the subject's
behavior. Similarly, I believe that the phrase &quot;free-form hand
shaping&quot; is intended to distinguish the way Skinner's team shaped the
pigeon in contrast to a formal, preset program of contingencies to be
followed from one session to another.

If those variations of Skinner's concept of &quot;shaping&quot; are correct (I
don't know what the terms for the alternative versions are), what do we
mean on this list by &quot;shaping&quot;? Do we mean all of the variations
Skinner might have meant by the term, or do we specifically mean
&quot;free-form hand shaping&quot;?

Putting it a different way, if someone says he used shaping to train a
particular behavior to his dog, would it be meaningful to ask whether
or not he used &quot;hand&quot; shaping, or would that be implicit? Would it be
meaningful to ask whether or not he used &quot;free-form&quot; shaping, or would
that be implicit?

Thanks for the clarification.

Ok, my turn to ask for clarification.

Lindsay, are you arguing for the continued use of the term &quot;Freeshaping&quot; as
you and others have used the term in the common vernacular of Clicker
Training? Do you defend the need for both terms - Shaping and Freeshaping -
in order to have meaningful discussion on animal training on this list which
is, as Kellie has defined it, focused on a Behavioral Analytic approach?
The distinctions drawn by Kellie and others regarding prompted and
unprompted behaviors and the terminology to define them seems pretty clear
to me.

As I understand the definitions presented by Kellie and others, &quot;Shaping&quot; is
simply the marking and reinforcing of a given behavior, incrementally
raising the criteria for reinforcing behavior, and again marking and
reinforcing new behavior as it appears. All of this without prompting,
luring, guiding, targeting, manipulating, slapping, screaming, or writing
sternly worded letters to get the animal to do the behavior. Simply
standing there with criteria in your head, marking when you see it and
delivering the reinforcer in a timely fashion.

Any behavior that is elicited by outside intervention of any kind is NOT, by
the definitions presented on this list, Shaping. If you stuck food in the
dogs face, that trial was &quot;lured.&quot; If you used a hand to get the dog to
move in a particular direction, that trial was &quot;targeted.&quot; If you stepped
into the dog to get them to move in a particular direction, that trial was
&quot;manipulated physically.&quot; When you do NOTHING AT ALL and the dog offers a
behavior you can mark and reinforce, that is the beginning of shaping. If
you raise the criteria and watch for more (faster, higher, farther, etc.) of
the behavior and mark/reinforce the &quot;bigger&quot; behavior (again with out
interfering with the animal in any way), then you continue &quot;Shaping&quot; the
behavior. The minute you intervene in any way to elicit a behavior, you are
NOT &quot;Shaping.&quot;

Based on what you describe as Skinners distinction of &quot;hand shaping&quot; as
opposed to &quot;mechanical shaping&quot;, it seems to me that the difference is that
in &quot;mechanical shaping&quot; a mechanism was responsible for deciding whether or
not criteria has been met before reinforcing. The description of &quot;hand
shaping&quot; sounds like humans made the determination whether or not a
reinforceable behavior had been offered.

Frankly, I don't see why we are still going round and round on this.
&quot;Shaping&quot; means doing nothing but observing/marking/reinforcing,
incrementally raising success criteria, and observing/marking/reinforcing
based on new criteria.

Can we agree to use the terms that Kellie suggests in order to move on to
more important topic other than redefining terms?

Kellie and no doubt everyone else a little batty.

So unless I hear otherwise, I'll assume that we no longer use the

Lindsay, what Skinner wrote was that instead of having a Skinner Box that
was set to automatically deliver food every time the pigeon did something
like push a button, the scientists ***delivered the food by hand*** every
time the bird did a behavior that was a wee bit more like the target
behavior than the one before that instead of the ***machine delivering the
food***. .

Before the incident with the pigeon on top of the General Mills flour
building, shaping had been done by creating a Skinner box that delivered a
treat based on some behavior like pressing a button. The bird was put in
the box, and everyone waited. The treat delivery happened automatically
every time the button was pushed. The bird had to figure out on his own
what to do to get the food delivered. They just put the bird in and waited.
It was all mechanized.

In the bowling thing, they didn't want to wait so long, so they gave the
bird a treat every time he offered a behavior a wee bit more like the target
behavior. They didn't lure. They didn't target. They let the bird decide
what he was going to do next. When the behavior was a wee bit closer to the
target behavior, they manually delivered a treat down a little tube into the
cardboard operant chamber they had made. The delivery of the food was all
that was manual.

What this did was make it possible to get the behavior faster and more
efficiently than if they just waited for the bird to figure it all out on
his own.

It's like playing the Warmer-Colder game.

Shaping means you reinforce successive behaviors offered by the organism
(without prompting, targeting or luring) to the target behavior.

I'm ready to move on from the shaping discussion. Shall we?

If this is referring to Gail Peterson's article on the origin's of shaping,
we must remember that it is a retrospective based on a retrospective, the
significance of which I will point out soon. Gail is able to use the terms
&quot;shaping,&quot;&quot;hand-shaping,&quot;&quot;successive approximation,&quot; etc. because he was
writing for (and, since much of this was based on one or more talks he gave,
talking to) an audience that was linguistically on the same page.
Fortunately, most of the time, we are able to verbalize without having to
define words, or defend definitions. This is true even of the vast majority
of technical papers I have read. There were those times where definitions
were called for; when new words or terms are coined, or when old words or
terms are redefined or clarified. Time, and the preponderance of usage
amongst the consumers (the &quot;verbalizing&quot; people) would be the measure of a
definition. If a word or term is defined differently by different
consumers, then inter-consumer communication suffers. Behavior analysts have
a rather specific definition of &quot;shaping,&quot; while outside this group, and
over time, &quot;shaping&quot; and add-ons to and variations of &quot;shaping&quot; have
appeared. Again, language can be used to obscure or enhance understanding.
The use of terms such as &quot;hand-shaping,&quot; and &quot;free-form hand-shaping&quot;
(hyphens are mine to indicate modifiers of &quot;shaping&quot;) simply enhance the
meaning to those accepting behavior analytic definition of &quot;shaping&quot; and
somewhat familiar with the history of behavior analytic technology (that is
the process of lab conditioning rats and pigeons, and instrumental
conditioning in general). Gail was attempting to communicate that Skinner,
and the others involved, had essentially substituted human hands and brains
for laboratory feeders, switches, timers, and relays. Most of those even
faintly familiar with early operant conditioning know that most conditioning
was done using machines. Further, for Gail's consumers, his literary devices
added interest and clarity. For those not wishing to accept the rather
simple meaning of &quot;shaping&quot; I am not sure Gail's words were useful, but then
they were not Gail's intended &quot;consumers.&quot; Fortunately, on this list, Kellie
is free to define the language according to behavior analysis, which should
simplify word choice.

So, Gail wrote a retrospective, and made it interesting, and, procedurally
accurate. However, there were some omissions in his historical record. His
reporting was incorrect because his single source, Skinner's recollections,
were incorrect. How do I know this? I talked with Keller Breland, Norman
Guttmann, Fred Skinner, and, most of all, I talked many times with Marian
Breland Bailey, about the event. Skinner's public writings indicates that
this discovery of shaping was a single event. Actually, according to what I
heard from Keller, Norm, Marian, and Fred, was that they all had previously
shaped behavior by hand-firing electric feeders. At that time Skinner used
the term &quot;differentiation&quot; to describe the process we now call shaping.
Differentiation used here is reasonably clear, and the relation between
differential reinforcement and differentiation is made clear. However,
differentiation is a clumsy term. Besides being easier to say, &quot;shaping&quot;
may also create a better visual image of the process. According to Marian,
Skinner did not like the term &quot;shaping,&quot; preferring &quot;differentiation.&quot;
However, over time, Skinner came around.

The hand-shaping exercise Skinner described used no automation at all, and
the food was hand delivered in a small cup. What was unusual is the
unusually complex nature of the behavior Skinner selected, and the fact that
they got this behavior so quickly by the rapid change of criteria. It was
the speed of acquisition of the finished behavior that astounded everyone.
Before, the behaviors were relatively simple, and, either the behavior was
machine conditioned (auto-shaping), or the early stages were hand shaped,
and then the machine took over. In the event Gail described, the entire
process was done by hand. Another fact Skinner failed to mention was that
Marian was there, in addition to Keller and Norm. There was a lot more
detail to this, but I don't wish to bore people.

"/> As Bob mentioned in one of his recent posts,
a target is not a target until we make it one
with reinforcement.

At first a target stick is just a neutral object.
We can shape a dog to touch it, or, if we are lucky,
the dog will investigate the stick on its own and
we can capture the behavior of touching the stick.

We can also smear the stick with something the dog
likes and lure the behavior, but then we may need
to shape the dog to touch the stick with its nose
instead of biting or licking it ;-)

To me, targeting is just second-order luring. A dog
will go to a cookie, because he likes it. The same
dog will go to a target, because he knows that
touching the stick will produce a cookie, which he
likes. There is just an extra step involved.

I know trainers who use targets all the time but to
whom luring is a dirty word. I've never quite
understood the big difference.

Hi there Pertti,

Thank you so much, I realise this part of teaching is shaping but why not
all of it?

I have never understood the difference, it's inducing behaviour either way.
Bob Bailey's Mantra is &quot;Get the behaviour&quot; I reckon you cannot train unless
you have behaviour to work with.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----

To me the difference is the way the target plate is used. If the dog has been trained through shaping that touching the target plate with its nose or what ever is the criteria will get it a click/reward, then the dog has learned this behavior. BUT if the plate is used to hold food (luring), then there's no behavior learned but running to the plate to get the food.

With the former, the dog has learned a behavior from which one moves on very quickly by fading the target and transitioning to the desired behavior. Which is on the Dog-Walk contact that of weight back on haunches, front feet on ground straight ahead and nose touch, straight ahead between front feet.

In training complex linked multiple behaviors like agility, most cannot be shaped, particularly the moving from one to the other. It's been my experience that the dog (and the handler :-0)) ) don't know what behavior is being clicked. So breaking the behavior down into tiny increments and building upon that is what works. The use of aids like targets helps obtain the desired behavior and understanding, but the aids must be faded very quickly so it doesn't become part of the behavior.

Using the Dog-Walk contact mentioned above, one starts with the end and back-chains to the complete behavior. This is actually taught on stairs at the beginning. The dog learns to touch the target plate in the correct fashion for the click. But the plate is faded (removed) from the behavior because it's the nose touch to the ground that's the desired behavior (there's no target plates allowed on an the Agility Course :-0)

To me that's the difference between luring and using a target as an aid.

I think what Pertti meant was the relative &quot;unholiness&quot; of using one as opposed to the other. There are those who say &quot;never lure, never target, only shape.&quot; There are those who say&quot;only shape or target; to lure is impure.&quot; And, then, there is the Bailey &quot;get the behavior&quot; view, that you do what you have to do to get behavior.

I never lure, if I don't have to or don't want to. I never target, if I don't have to or don't want to. I never shape, if I don't have to or don't want to. When I can, or when I want to, I arrange the environment such that the animal is highly likely to give me what I want, and I reinforce the behavior I want. If I have to, or want to, I will lure, or I will target, or I will shape. I will lure only as much or as long as necessary. I will target as much or long as is necessary. While shaping, I will avoid or reduce reinforcing behavior I won't want later on (means move along).

On strength or quality of behavior obtained by targeting, luring, or shaping, or environmental manipulation, I have found no significant difference. Shaping takes the longest to get behavior in most instances, in my experience. Luring is the toughest to use and fade, in my opinion. Targeting is the easiest to use and fade, and is the most versatile, in my experience. Environmental manipulation is usually the fastest training method but most difficult to arrange for many behaviors, in my experience.

How you start to get a behavior does not have to be how you finish getting the behavior (something about being OK to change horses).

For the professional trainer, time is money. For the serious hobbyist, time and quality are a matter of pride and prizes. For the hobbyist, have a good time.

Every trainer worth his or her salt should shape at least one behavior a month, just to maintain the skills essential to ply the training craft.

Let's see, I think I have just summarized 4 to 6 of my 20-30 minute lectures. Does anyone out there understand what I have said?

......I know trainers who use targets all the time but to whom luring is a dirty word. I've never quite
understood the big difference.

Pertti

--------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---

To me the difference is the way the target plate is used. If the dog has been trained through shaping that touching the target plate with its nose or what ever is the criteria will get it a click/reward, then the dog has learned this behavior. BUT if the plate is used to hold food (luring), then there's no behavior learned but running to the plate to get the food.

With the former, the dog has learned a behavior from which one moves on very quickly by fading the target and transitioning to the desired behavior. Which is on the Dog-Walk contact that of weight back on haunches, front feet on ground straight ahead and nose touch, straight ahead between front feet.

In training complex linked multiple behaviors like agility, most cannot be shaped, particularly the moving from one to the other. It's been my experience that the dog (and the handler :-0)) ) don't know what behavior is being clicked. So breaking the behavior down into tiny increments and building upon that is what works. The use of aids like targets helps obtain the desired behavior and understanding, but the aids must be faded very quickly so it doesn't become part of the behavior.

Using the Dog-Walk contact mentioned above, one starts with the end and back-chains to the complete behavior. This is actually taught on stairs at the beginning. The dog learns to touch the target plate in the correct fashion for the click. But the plate is faded (removed) from the behavior because it's the nose touch to the ground that's the desired behavior (there's no target plates allowed on an the Agility Course :-0)

To me that's the difference between luring and using a target as an aid.

I think what Pertti meant was the relative &quot;unholiness&quot; of using one as opposed to the other. There are those who say &quot;never lure, never target, only shape.&quot; There are those who say&quot;only shape or target; to lure is impure.&quot; And, then, there is the Bailey &quot;get the behavior&quot; view, that you do what you have to do to get behavior.

You are exactly right, it does depend on how one does it, whatever &quot;it&quot; is. Even the &quot;experts&quot; screw up, and, the longer you do this stuff the more opportunity to make mistakes. If you lure or target to get a behavior, you may get the behavior faster than shaping, but what is the reinforcement history? By putting a piece of food on an object on the table, I can get a chicken to peck at that object literally in seconds, where it might take a one to several minutes to shape, depending on the chicken and the person's skill. Consider the specs are that a naive (clicker conditioned, but that's all) chicken must peck at the stationary target at a rate of once every 4 seconds. I usually can get a novice chicken to peck at the target at this rate by luring in less than one minute, sometimes less than 30 seconds, and that includes fading the lure. OK, the rules are I stop training as soon as the chicken pecks once every 4 seconds. Shaping a naive chicken to the same specs might take 5 minutes, maybe more, with the bulk of the time teaching the bird the rules of the game. The point here is that there is a lot of reinforcement leading up to criteria of one peck every 4 seconds. Now, we put each chicken on extinction. Which chicken will persist pecking longer at the target? Of course, the shaped chicken. The observer might then conclude, based solely on the test, shaping is better than luring.

OK. NO! What about the time and number of reinforcements. Let's say it took 5 minutes to shape the behavior, and one minute to lure the behavior, including fading, all to specs. Now, with the lured chicken, let's say I continued reinforcing pecks meeting specs (love rhyming) for another one and a half minutes, which brings the time to one half of the time it took to shape the behavior. One and a half minutes is time spent reinforcing exactly what you want. Now, compare the strength of behavior between the shaped and lured behavior, and remember, I faded the lure in less than a minute, so the behavior of both the chicken and the trainer will look the same. Gads! Most of the time the lured behavior is stronger, often much stronger. Why? Of course, more time was spent reinforcing at criteria, building a stronger behavior.

Most trainers who lure, or target, get the behavior so fast that they fail to recognize that most behaviors are only as strong as the reinforcement history (won't go into certain innate, and almost innate behaviors). Once they get the behavior, the begin to stress the behavior (attempting ratios, or introducing environmental distractions, or whatever) and find that the behavior is not as strong as they thought. So, using prompts can be an effective training method, but only when used correctly. Of course, I have already said, unless I want to, or need to, I won't use prompts of any kind.

If the trainers at Animal Behavior Enterprises relied on shaping to get the behavior of the thousands of animals we trained, we would have gone broke in a hurry. We learned how to get accurate and strong behavior quickly, using a variety of methods. However, our trainers still prided themselves on their ability to shape behavior. To me, shaping embodies the purist elements of the training craft. To test trainer skill, shaping is where the rubber meets the road. Shaping, requiring the process of splitting behaviors into smaller and smaller pieces, should be in a trainers mind, even while luring, targeting, or whatever. I repeat: every trainer should shape at least one behavior every month.

Everyone who completed my introductory class shaped at least one behavior.

You have zeroed in on a huge issue...time spent and number of reinforcements = stronger behavior. I know I'm guilty of &quot;upping the ante&quot; too soon rather than spending more time reinforcing. Note to self....

As to shaping a behavior a month, I'm thinking it will not only benefit me, but will really help my dog's thinking ability. Now that we've progressed into more complex behaviors for agility, all this running and playing has replaced the mind games we used to play. My shaping a behavior will also cause him to continue to expand his thinking ability. Might be too much of a good thing though, he's continually trying to train me. I have to really be on guard to avoid ending up with a demanding little tyrant..... :-0))

Thanks for sharing all your insight and Kellie thanks for initiating this list. I've learned more the in the past 2 days than in the last year.

I am sure that Kellie wants to maintain historical accuracy. Kellie was smart enough to use something already there, rather than try to rediscover the wheel (trainers should pay attention). The Click-L list has been around for a long time. Some of you know the history, and I hope that Kellie will keep reminding people that this list is the &quot;granddaddy&quot; of the &quot;clicker-craze&quot; promotions, and I mean that in a good sense. Kathleen Weaver started it, but Kellie is making in work now. A note to list members: List Mistresses work better when their good behavior is reinforced &lt;smile&gt;. Thanks, Judy.

Most list owners where I post know this, either by my words or by my actions. I move around a bit. My internet activity is fairly high, especially to Europe and Asia. I can't be on forums consistently. Also, if you wish me to address certain issues, be sure Bailey appears in the subject line. I don't mean to sound egocentric, but I get well over 400 emails a day, and I am brutal with the delete key. I do have my filters set so Bailey in the subject will cause a flag. I cannot promise to answer, but I will at least see the flagged post and perhaps save the message. If I can, I will respond. If I cannot respond because of the pressure of time, please remember two things: 1) I am interested in training as a craft, and interested in the people who do it; 2) I am a retired 70 year old, after all, and I do take a break from time to time. For instance, I will be going to Hawaii next month, and a few days will be spent studying the behavior of volcanoes, and maybe whales at sea. In March, I will be in San Diego attending meetings, and teaching. I will not be on line!!! &lt;smile&gt;.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;I have a question, how do we teach targeting if we are not shaping?

"/> Oh! Interesting question.

First, what does targeting mean? We have to define targeting behaviorally.
People target in different ways, so once again (as usual!) a clear
definition is important. Here are some examples:
* Targeting is to touch the end of a stick with the nose.
* Or targeting is to touch an object that has just been tapped with
a target stick.
* Or targeting is following my owners hand around until I'm close
enough to touch it with my nose.

Let's say we're going with the first one (because it makes for easier
explanation!)

Targeting is a target behavior, yes? Targeting is the goal of the shaping
project. What behaviors do I have to get the project going?

Sometimes Fido looks at the target stick held in front of his face. Click
Treat!
After getting that CT Fido looks at the stick, and turns his head toward it.
CT!
Now Fido looks, turns and leans toward the stick. CT!
Now Fido looks, turns, leans and touches the stick with his nose! YEAH!
CLICK TREAT!

That was a shaping procedure to teach the dog to target. Now we have a tool
that can be used to jump start behaviors that can get us closer to more
complex behaviors. I often teach animals to touch any object I just tapped
with the target stick. I tap the door, and Fido, rather than touching the
stick nudges the door with his nose. By nudging the door with his nose, he
has offered a behavior that I can now reinforce and then shape into opening
or closing the door.

So, you can shape targeting. (You can also just capture it, which is usually
easier than what I described above. Just put the stick in front of the
dog's face, when he instinctively sniffs it, click and treat.)

So now you have a nice shaped behavior... Targeting. Targeting can now be
used to jump start behaviors to be shaped. Or targeting can be used to lure
behaviors. The sport of cat agility is fairly new and from what I can see
most cats are still taught by luring with a laser pointer used as a target.
The cats don't necessarily learn to run the obstacles because they are lead
through them by their tendency to chase the light on the pointer. If the
trainers would only offer the playful bouncing laser light AFTER the cat had
performed successive approximations, the cat would learn to run the agility
course the way dogs do. The temptation for the trainer, however, is to lead
the cat with the light since young athletic cats often chase laser lights
anyway and initially it's quicker than shaping.

The value of shaping is that the animal learns to perform the behavior on
its own right up front. No fading needed. Is it sometimes faster to target
and fade the target? Probably! Do it that way if it works better. But
just remember that animals (and people) can become prompt dependent.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Thank you so much, I realise this part of teaching is shaping but why not

"/> all of it?

Shaping involves letting the animal figure out what to do next. It's like
the Warmer Colder game... But you just use the &quot;warmer&quot; part. (Do you play
that in Australia as children?) You decide in advance what you want the
person in the next room to do. She comes back in and starts trying stuff.
If she gets closer to what you decided you want her to do you say &quot;warmer&quot;.
If she gets off course, you say nothing. &quot;Warmer&quot; is the Click &amp; Treat.
That's what shaping is.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;I have never understood the difference, it's inducing behaviour either way.

"/> Here's an example. Suppose you're on a wilderness hike with a guide who
leads you through some dense woods at a quick clip. The guide has been
through these woods a million times, and knows every broken twig. You've
never been in these woods before. There are hills and valleys, streams to
be traversed, armadillo holes to be avoided (you're in Texas, of course!)
and you have to ignore the scenery or you'll lose your target/guide. The
guide is right there, up ahead, but you have to pay attention to him or
you'll get lost. He's not going to leave you behind, but he's also not
going to wait for you to figure a lot out on your own. Why should he? He
can show you much faster. You get through to the campfire at the far end
where the guide offers you a beer for a job well done.

The next morning a helicopter picks you up and puts you back at the start
and you have to do the whole trip on your own. How well will you be able to
navigate those woods?

Now, suppose that you had a different guide who let you look around and take
in your surroundings, try different footings on the steep parts, etc. He'd
even let you back track if you had trouble navigating a certain part of the
path. He stayed beside you instead of moving on ahead and when you were on
the right path he'd say, &quot;That's right! This is the way!&quot; At the end you
still get your beer and your well done. Now, how easy would it be to get
through the woods the next day?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Bob Bailey's Mantra is &quot;Get the behaviour&quot; I reckon you cannot train unless

"/> you have behaviour to work with.

I want to point out that I am NOT saying there is no use for targeting. I am
not saying there is no use for luring. I am NOT saying &quot;Thou shalt not
target and thou shalt not lure.&quot; NOT! NOT! NOT! I AM saying that
targeting is not shaping. I AM saying that luring is not shaping.

Hi, Judy...

] &gt; To me the difference is the way the target plate is used. If the dog
has been trained through shaping that touching the target plate with its
nose or what ever is [] &gt; the criteria will get it a click/reward, then the
dog has learned this behavior. BUT if the plate is used to hold food
(luring), then there's no behavior learned but [] &gt; running to the plate to
get the food.

Excellent point!

I like to teach targeting a little differently than a lot of people. (So
maybe I'm guilty of misusing a word... you may chastise me if you must!)
This method is for behaviors that involve interacting with some object or
going to some location.

I teach the animal to touch something I tap with a target stick. I touch
the door and the dog nudges the door. I touch the perch and the parrot
touches the perch. (Of course I have to teach them to do that!) This way
the target stick is out of the picture quickly, all it does is jump start
some behaviors that can then be shaped. Once the animal is interacting with
the object and trying different things to see what I'll click for I stop
using the target stick and go to pure shaping.

[] &gt; In training complex linked multiple behaviors like agility, most cannot
be shaped, particularly the moving from one to the other. It's been my
experience that [] &gt; the dog (and the handler :-0)) ) don't know what
behavior is being clicked.
[]
That's an interesting point. Is that when you use targeting to direct the
dog?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; For the professional trainer, time is money. For the serious hobbyist,
&gt; time and quality are a matter of pride and prizes. For the hobbyist, have a
&gt; good time.

&gt; Every trainer worth his or her salt should shape at least one behavior a
&gt; month, just to maintain the skills essential to ply the training craft.

&gt; Let's see, I think I have just summarized 4 to 6 of my 20-30 minute
&gt; lectures. Does anyone out there understand what I have said?

&gt; ......I know trainers who use targets all the time but to whom luring is a
&gt; dirty word. I've never quite
&gt; understood the big difference.
&gt; --
&gt; Pertti
&gt; ------------------------------
&gt; To me the difference is the way the target plate is used. If the dog has
&gt; been trained through shaping that touching the target plate with its nose or
&gt; what ever is the criteria will get it a click/reward, then the dog has
&gt; learned this behavior. BUT if the plate is used to hold food (luring), then
&gt; there's no behavior learned but running to the plate to get the food.

&gt; With the former, the dog has learned a behavior from which one moves on
&gt; very quickly by fading the target and transitioning to the desired
&gt; behavior. Which is on the Dog-Walk contact that of weight back on haunches,
&gt; front feet on ground straight ahead and nose touch, straight ahead between
&gt; front feet.

&gt; In training complex linked multiple behaviors like agility, most cannot be
&gt; shaped, particularly the moving from one to the other. It's been my
&gt; experience that the dog (and the handler :-0)) ) don't know what behavior is
&gt; being clicked. So breaking the behavior down into tiny increments
&gt; and building upon that is what works. The use of aids like targets helps
&gt; obtain the desired behavior and understanding, but the aids must be faded
&gt; very quickly so it doesn't become part of the behavior.

&gt; Using the Dog-Walk contact mentioned above, one starts with the end and
&gt; back-chains to the complete behavior. This is actually taught on stairs at
&gt; the beginning. The dog learns to touch the target plate in the correct
&gt; fashion for the click. But the plate is faded (removed) from the behavior
&gt; because it's the nose touch to the ground that's the desired behavior
&gt; (there's no target plates allowed on an the Agility Course :-0)

&gt; To me that's the difference between luring and using a target as an aid.

Hi Kellie,
Just wanted to say that I really liked the hike through the woods analogy.
Really great!

Another awesome post!!! Oh my goodness me... music to my ears. Thank you so
much for an excellent explanation of getting lost and the difference between
targeting luring and shaping. It really is quite understandable isn't it Kellie!!!
Easy when it is pointed out, thank you again for taking the time to explain!
I really appreciate it and I am sure others do to.

First, what does targeting mean?

Hi Kellie!!!!

An awesome post, something I can really sink my teeth into!!! This was
exactly what I wanted to know, a clear definition of what we are actually
doing.!!!!

Thank you for reviving the CLICK- L list!!! I am starting to look forward to
turning on my computer again. It has become reinforcing for me to do so.

&gt;&gt;You have zeroed in on a huge issue...time spent and number of reinforcements = stronger behavior. I know I'm guilty of &quot;upping the ante&quot; too soon rather than spending more time reinforcing. Note to self....&lt;&lt;

"/> Guilty here...I fight the get the behavior and move on urge everytime I teach. I find this urge even stronger with a dog who is a quick learner...

When working with those who &quot;want to teach&quot; their dogs but are not interested in learning the &quot;rest of the story&quot;... I have problems with &quot;she will do it in the kitchen but not outside&quot; or &quot;I know she knows it because she did it for me 3 times...&quot;

&quot;get it and go&quot; is NOT the success mantra for this method and set you and the dog up for failure...
&quot;get it and go SLOW&quot; and is what I say every time I use the newspaper over my own head because I have to go back to the beginning and reteach a behavior because I did not do it right from the beginning.

I am often asked how do I know when a behavior is really a proofed behavior...my personal litmus test is...if my 4 year old granddaughter can walk up to a dog, in the middle of a crowded Wal-mart and give the cue and the dog responds correctly I can be reasonably assured that this dog knows the behavior... &lt;smile&gt;

Formal teaching sessions, IMHO, should be kept short. I watched a demo with a dog that 5-6 months old pup that went on for 45 min. as time went on the dog began to whine and the behaviors began to break down quickly..and finally ending in refusal. It was sad to watch.

I use what I call the 3-5 rule...I teach 3-5 formal sessions a day...with 3-5 minute in length..always ending on a positive.
I have come to learn that TV commercials are a good judge of time if you are teaching on the fly... I find that in most cases it leaves the dogs wanting more...and sets up the next session for enthusiasm.

Thanks, Pat! I, too, am finding it a lot of fun. I'm so grateful to all of
you and Bob Bailey for digging right into some important discussions.

As Bob wrote, it's not about everyone taking MY word for things... it's
about dissecting things down to the basics so we can see what's really
there. I didn't make any of this up, and I can almost always provide you
with references. If not, I can say, &quot;Um... I don't know.&quot;

If the main thing that comes out of this list is that everyone here reads
each new book about dog training with a few skeptical questions in mind:
&quot;Where did this info come from? Did the author make it up? Is there data?
Did she do it herself? Is there a legitimate reason for her to make these
claims? Where's the data? Has anyone else had the same results?&quot; That
would be a valuable outcome to me.

Diane, this is anecdotal, but hopefully if I mis-report Bob will pop in and
correct my version. Jesus Rosales told the ORCA students that the first
time Bob and Marian came to UNT several years ago and taught with chickens,
they had the students do 5 minute sessions. The next time they came they
used 30 second sessions. Jesus asked them why. They said, &quot;If we give them
5m they take 5m. If we give them 30s they get it in 30s.&quot;

I will admit that *I* get bored with long sessions. My Chinese Crested has
a longer attention span. I keep it short. 10 trials. 20 trials when we're
really into it.

Think about this... SCHOOL CHILDREN! What do we do to them? We make 6 year
olds do math for an hour. We make 6 year olds do English for an hour. We
skip over science as quickly as possilbe, then we squeeze in art and music
maybe once a month. By the time they get to Jr. high is it any wonder they
have bad attitudes?

It's not just the long sessions. Constant pressure (-R) and the
consequences of failure (+P) seem to be the primary OC quadrants
used, with predictable fallout. +R (that is, intended reinforcers
that actually have a reinforcing effect) are often long-delayed (bad
timing) or non-existent, and the child is expected to come equipped
with his own fount of motivation. Any suggestion for reform is
dismissed as radical.

A generation of dog trainers has learned to make agility and other
training activities fun for dogs, yet a kid who thinks school is fun
is almost unheard of.

So true!!! It went pretty good for my kids throughout elementary school
where some R+ techiques were at least attempted. Once they hit middle
school that all went out the window and the kids were blamed for their bad
attitudes. They never heard anything about, &quot;The rat is always right&quot;!

There were some folks in the 70s who tried to reform the schools with
positive reinforcement. Unfortunately it wasn't always administered very
well and became confused with permissive parenting... and often was all
mixed in with permissiveness. Another of Skinner's students, Carl Binder,
tried to do some public school reform. He eventually just got exhausted
and started a private school. Makes most of his money in organizational
behavior-- corporate behavior reform.

I don't know what the logic is. We don't want to spend any money on
schools. (College loans have just been dramatically slashed in the US.) We
just want kids to appreciate the value of a good education. Who are we
kidding? Maybe ourselves. The kids certainly aren't falling for it.

The intended R- isn't even used well. For R- to be effective it has to be
'turned off' once you get the behavior you want. In school that rarely
happens.

Very true! In my undergrad class I tell them that if you keep using
aversive techniques when you see they're not working or after the learner
does the behavior, that's just abuse. Sounds strong, but it's true, IMO.
