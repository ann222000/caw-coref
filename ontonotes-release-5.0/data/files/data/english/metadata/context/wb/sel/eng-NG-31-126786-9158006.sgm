1 Mass action

1.1 Samwu workers to march over McBride

IOL, 23 August 2007

Ekurhuleni municipal workers will march next week to call on disciplinary action to be applied consistently to all employees, including embattled police chief Robert McBride.

The controversial anti-apartheid struggle veteran is on paid leave, which members of the SA Municipal Workers' Union (Samwu) want withdrawn.

He faces charges of driving under the influence of alcohol, defeating the ends of justice, and fraud, relating to a car accident in Pretoria in December last year.

McBride was given time off from work on July 21. This was after he appeared in the Pretoria regional court and was granted R1 000 bail. He will reappear in court in November.

Also raising the ire of the Samwu branch in McBride's municipality is the city manager's decision to pay his legal costs. Their memorandum to Ekurhuleni executive mayor Duma Nkosi will demand this be withdrawn.

Samwu branch secretary Koena Ramotlou said the march was scheduled to start from the Germiston Civic Centre at noon on Friday next week. - Sapa

1.2 NUM considers end to Lonmin strike

Platinum Today, 23 August 2007

South Africa's National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) is understood to be considering bringing its strike action at Lonmin's Marikana operations to an end.

According to Frans Baleni, the NUM's General Secretary, said the union is looking to suspend its industrial action, which was launched following concerns over Lonmin's payment process.

Speaking to Mining Weekly, Mr Baleni said: &quot;We are engaging members and management to suspend the strike until such a time that the court issues have been resolved.&quot;

Despite some claims that the strike was in breach of a court order that prohibited any such action until a full hearing into the matter had been held, Mr Baleni defended his union's action.

He insisted that the NUM had taken the proper legal steps before ordering its members to down tools.

Reuters reports that negotiations between Lonmin and the NUM broke down on Wednesday without any agreement being reached.

1.3 Security guards unhappy

Sebabatso Mosamo, Vuvuzela, 23 August 2007

WITS security guards are unhappy about what they term &quot;intolerable&quot; employment allowances, and claim they are mistreated by top management.

A number of security guards, who asked not to be named for fear of victimisation, said their biggest concern was that management was neglecting their needs. They complained about receiving &quot;no positive feedback&quot; when they tried to resolve these issues in the past.

Employment allowances include night shift, weekend, transport, telephone and meal allowances from the university.

Security guards claim they have not received all their allowances. One security guard's pay-slip, inspected by Vuvuzela, did not specify weekend, transport or telephone allowances at all.

His pay-slip also showed differences in the night shift allowance paid. He was paid R150 in January, R170 in February and R150 again in April this year.

The guards claim that night shift allowances were not paid at all early in the year. Guards are also unhappy about receiving between R15 and R30 for meal allowances.

They believe they are getting the short end of the stick, and say they have made numerous attempts to appeal to management, through their union, National Education, Health and Allied Workers' Union (Nehawu).

In 2005, the union's Delegating and Teams Committee members met with Wits Head of Security, Robert Kemp, to discuss allowances. The guards claim it was agreed that all the allowances would be fully paid.

The 2005/2006 report from the Nehawu branch, states:  &quot;On these issues it was agreed that inquiries would be made with other departments and institutions for benchmarking.&quot;  And yet, &quot;nothing has been done&quot;, said one security guard.

In response to the complaints, a statement by Robert Kemp, director of Campus Control, said: &quot;The issues raised in your [Vuvuzela] inquiry were referred to the Department of Labour by 'the staff in Campus Control' on 26 June 2006. The University was called to a meeting on 7 July 2006 where the University responded to each allegation.&quot;

According to the statement the Department of Labour was satisfied with the outcome of the meeting, and that all legal requirements were met. &quot;The matter was then closed and all formal legal channels are thus exhausted.&quot;

Besides dissatisfaction with allowances, security guards also feel the department is not dedicated to skills development, and fear losing their jobs due to outsourcing. Kemp responded that Campus Control operated within a budget allocated by the University. Outsourcing was a result of the cost and preference of the different university departments.

Guards complain of  staff shortages, saying they have too many security issues to deal with at one time. In his statement, Kemp acknowledged this. They were working on the issue with the procurement office, he said.

&quot;We have had some vacancies in recent months and we are currently recruiting new staff to fill these positions at the moment.&quot;

1.4 Teachers at their wits' end

Sne Masuku, Sowetan, 24 August 2007

Teacher's union Natu in KwaZulu-Natal says it will meet with the provincial department of education today in a last-ditch effort to reclaim all outstanding monies owed to its members.

Union members are seeing red and have accused the department of docking 21 days off their salaries as opposed to only 14 during the strike in July.

Natu spokesman Musa Gumede said the department has docked the salaries of their members for 21 days, instead of 14.

&quot;The department has failed to take into consideration the number of days the department took to make a decision to close down schools by asking principals at schools to use their discretion.

&quot;Many teachers were on duty regardless of the strike.&quot;

He said it was imperative for the department to thoroughly investigate who was on duty and who was actively on strike, and for how many days, before deducting the money from all teachers.

Gumede said if there was no favourable outcome to the matter they would go to court.
Education spokesman Christie Naudé said various structures were in place to deal with this matter.

1.5 Blaze hits 100 timbermill jobs

Malungelo Booi and Lubabalo Ngcukana, Mthatha Bureau, Dispatch, 24 August 2007

DAMAGE estimated at close to R2million was caused by a fire which gutted a Mthatha timber factory on Tuesday night, leaving the jobs of around 100 workers in jeopardy.

Firefighters battled for more than seven hours at the Highbury Treated Timber plant to bring the blaze under control.

The factory was apparently set alight by a nearby veld fire around the lunch hour, police spokesperson Mzukisi Fatyela said.

A Dispatch team was on the scene as the fire blazed fiercely inside the plant and corrugated iron structures collapsed.

Firefighters from as far as Mbashe municipality laboured side-by-side with local municipal and fire fighters from the Mthatha airport to stop the flames spreading to nearby homes at Fort Gale, just outside the city.

A strong smell of chemicals hung over the area as managers and workers looked on helplessly.

As the wreckage was cooling down yesterday, one of the company's three directors, Zolani Ngcingwana, said damage was estimated at around R2 million.

He said the directors would soon meet to decide on the fate of the employees. &quot;Obviously we cannot keep people when we have nothing to do, and right now people are not at work.&quot;

He said he could not rule out the factory closing permanently.

The factory supplied timber to wholesalers and projects throughout the province.

&quot;We have informed those businesses and some of them have indicated that they are cancelling because they cannot wait.&quot;

Ngcingwana said the saw mill - the main driver of the business - was destroyed in the blaze.

&quot;It's going to take us a long time to rebuild, depending on when the insurance comes to the party. I suppose if they are quick enough we will be able to get back on our feet fast,&quot; he said.

Yesterday, employees were uncertain about their future. &quot;I am very scared and I do not know what will happen now, but it is possible that we are going to be laid off,&quot; said Phillip Bishop, a father of eight who has been with the factory for more than 10 years. &quot;It is really sad because I have children to look after.&quot;

2 South Africa

2.1 Cosatu, state in a spat over imports

Eric Naki, Sowetan, 24 August 2007

The Trade and Industry department said yesterday it was opposed to any targeted boycott of unsafe products from China because South Africa had good economic and political relations with that country.
Any problems emanating from poor standards of Chinese products coming into the country will be raised with the Chinese government through proper bilateral channels.

This was the view of DTI spokesman Vukani Mde in response to a call by Cosatu in the Western Cape for the boycott of Chinese products.

Cosatu's regional secretary Tony Ehrenreich said while unsafe and hazardous materials found their way into the country, China was a good example of unsafe products that must be avoided.

Mde acknowledged that there were plenty of products, including food products and pork from overseas countries coming into the country which often failed to meet standard tests.

&quot;We need to protect our consumers by jacking up our safety checks. Products from all countries have to be subjected to our rigorous standards tests of safety and health. However, we will not support any targeted boycott of any country's products. We have good and open relations with China and if we have any problem with their products, we will take it up with them,&quot; said Mde.

&quot;These products are dangerous and pose a health risk to communities,&quot; countered
Ehrenreich.

Speaking to Sowetan yesterday, he cited toothpaste and toys that were found to be health hazards. He also made mention of a poisonous fertiliser from China that contaminated pineapple and posed danger to the health of workers at a farm in Limpopo.

&quot;These products are not properly tested back home. We know of TV sets that exploded and machine tools that were not up to standard.

&quot;We want a boycott of all unsafe products no matter where they come from, but China is our main target,&quot; said Ehrenreich.

He urged workers to insist that their companies don't buy Chinese machinery or cars unless they were fully compliant with guidelines set by the SA Bureau of Standards (SABS) as the &quot;low-cost sub-standard machinery&quot; posed a risk to workers.

SABS spokesman Erno Botes said the body was aware of sub-standard products that came into the country undetected.

&quot;We try to take these products off the shelves to prevent their sale, but the problem is that we are not always aware of where they are.

&quot;However, there are products that require compulsory testing to ensure they meet safety standards. These are automotive and electrical equipment and cement.

&quot;These products are subject to compulsory testing because they pose the highest risk to the lives of people,&quot; Botes said.

Recently SABS issued a warning to consumers about non-compliant electrical products, saying it would not allow these to be sold in the country as they were unsafe.

Alan Cohen, SABS's technical specialist said products identified as unsafe included stoves, rice cookers, electrical scales, hair clippers, steam irons, adaptors, plugs, appliance switches and flexible cords and extension cords. Cohen said the intention was to remove all these products from the market within three months, as from July.

Botes said SABS had despatched inspectors to visit suppliers to prevent the sale of unsafe products.

He said suppliers who import products have to obtain a letter of authority granted after a product had been tested by the SABS.

Another option would be for the importers to produce a certificate from a credible and approved certification body from the affected country.

2.2 Construction industry blitz

Sowetan, 24 August 2007

More than 90 percent of construction companies visited by labour inspectors in the Eastern Cape recently had violated occupational health and safety regulations, the Labour Department said yesterday.

Spokesman Zolisa Sigabi said the first two days of nationwide construction workplace inspections showed an &quot;alarming&quot; dip in labour law compliance.

&quot;Inspections of one of the leading industries of workplace fatalities exposed employers as breaking the law,&quot; she said.

The two-week labour blitz started on Monday and will end next Friday.

She said Eastern Cape employers who failed to comply with regulations, were issued with contravention notices. Of 33 employers 31 were issued with notices. - Sapa

2.3 Construction employers breaking labour laws

IOL, 23 August 2007

Several employers in the construction industry were found to have been breaking occupational health and safety regulations, the labour department said on Thursday.

Spokesperson Zolisa Sigabi said the first two days of nationwide construction workplace inspections showed an &quot;alarming&quot; dip in labour law compliance.

&quot;Inspections of one of the leading industries of workplace fatalities have exposed employers as contravening the law,&quot; she said.

The two-week labour blitz started on Monday and will end next Friday.

She said Eastern Cape employers who failed to comply with regulations were issued with contravention notices. Thirty-one out of 33 employers were issued with contravention notices.

A contravention notice gives an employer 21 days or more to rectify the mistake pointed out by inspectors.

In the Northern Cape, inspectors had to call an immediate halt to workers as several construction sites.

&quot;Employees were found to be working in dangerous conditions including trenches of up to four metres in depth with no protective equipment,&quot; said Sigabi.

Of the 45 sites visited, 31 were issued with contravention notices.

In Limpopo, 16 contravention notices were issued, while operations were stopped at two workplaces.

Twelve Pretoria employers were also served with notices.

&quot;Inspectors will be conducting law awareness campaigns in several provinces,&quot; said Sigabi. - Sapa

2.4 Huge security scam rocks Parliament

Nic Dawes and Sam Sole, Mail &amp; Guardian, 24 August 2007

Crucial security functions at Parliament, the South African Revenue Service (Sars), the KwaZulu-Natal legislature, two parastatals and several big private companies are in the hands of a firm with a history of corrupt practices, the Mail &amp; Guardian can reveal.

Africa Strategic Asset Protection (Asap) won a R32-million access-control contract and a R12-million asset-tracking contract for Parliament in what appear to be clear cases of tender-rigging.

Asap still has a R450 000-per-month maintenance contract at the legislature, despite repeated South African Police Service (SAPS) complaints that the company's poor performance threatens security at premises frequented by MPs, Cabinet ministers and government officials.

Asap also stands to earn millions in commission after a Chinese company it represents won a massive tender from Sars for scanners that will enable customs officials to look inside containers without opening them.

And it helped supply electronic snooping equipment to the National Communications Centre, which helps law enforcement and intelligence agencies spy on telephone and internet traffic.

Asap and its subsidiaries have contracts at Coega, the National Prosecuting Authority, PetroSA and oil company BP.

The company is bidding for more than R20-million of work at the Pretoria ministerial estate, Bryntirion, and other public and private-sector tenders.

Further afield, it has been involved in a controversial Nigerian airport contract and a bid to provide security technology for the palace of Swaziland's King Mswati III.

An inside man
Asap won almost complete control of Parliament's access technology, surveillance cameras and X-ray scanning equipment in a series of tenders beginning in 2001, in highly irregular circumstances.

The M&amp;G has established that:
* Russel Christopher, the intelligence and security adviser to then-speaker of the National Assembly Frene Ginwala, received and continues to receive large payments and expensive gifts from Asap.
* Shane Jacobs, a consultant employed by engineers Lewis &amp; De Kroon to help the Public Works Department develop tender documents and assess applicants, was effectively an employee of Asap at the same time. He received and continues to receive regular payments from the company he was supposed to help evaluate.
* Jacques du Plessis, a former policeman who heads Asap, paid kickbacks to both Jacobs and Christopher.
* The late Thobile &quot;Tall&quot; Mtwazi, who was Nelson Mandela's chief bodyguard and owned 67% of Asap, helped smooth the political path for the company.
The installations at Parliament gave Asap a foot in the door at provincial legislatures. It recently completed an R11,7-million installation at the KwaZulu-Natal legislature in Pietermaritzburg after Jacobs and Christopher advised on its security needs.

Christopher, Jacobs and Asap managing director Jacques du Plessis deny any impropriety.

Scan this
Christopher was uncomfortably close to Sars during the complex tender process for its container scanner purchase. During the first tender round, Asap formed part of a consortium, Thibela, short-listed to form a public-private partnership that would install and manage the scanners.

When Sars cancelled that tender and opted to buy the scanners outright, Nuctech, the Chinese company represented in South Africa by Asap, won the tender. Asap stands to earn a minimum of 3% commission on this deal. The value of the tender has been put at roughly R1-billion, which would earn Asap R30-million, but Du Plessis told the M&amp;G the precise amount was still being negotiated.

Christopher was employed at Sars from May 2006 to March this year, when the tender was being evaluated. He had been headhunted by, and reported directly to, Sars general manager for risk Pete Richer, who served on the eight-person tender committee.

During the latter part of this period he was also being paid R78 000 per month by Asap, through an associate company. More recently, he appears to have received R140 000 for one month's work.

Sars communications chief Logan Wort was adamant that Christopher's work -- drafting a report -- had no bearing on the scanner contract, and that no procurement decisions arose from his work there. &quot;We emphatically believe that he was not in a position to influence the tender in any way,&quot; Wort said, adding that the process had been &quot;triple audited&quot;, and that Sars had been unaware at the time of Asap's relationship with Nuctech.

How to win friends
In October 2000, the Public Works Department appointed consulting engineers Lewis &amp; De Kroon (LDK) to develop a specification for a revamped access control system in Parliament and to help evaluate tenders. They were required to be independent of any company that might tender.

Christopher drove the process, and told the M&amp;G he was trying to address security worries while making Parliament more accessible to the people.

In fact Jacobs was already close to both Christopher and Asap. In October 1999 Christopher wrote a glowing letter of recommendation for him on parliamentary stationery. Jacobs was also instrumental in Asap's reinvention as an empowerment company.

&quot;Shane introduced me to Thobile,&quot; Asap's Du Plessis told the M&amp;G, explaining how he had met his 67% black economic empowerment partner.

Jacobs's and Christopher's clear conflict of interest deepened as the tender process gathered momentum, and Jacobs was appointed as a consultant for LDK.

At an early meeting of the &quot;client and professional team&quot; on April 11, Christopher represented Parliament. LDK was represented by Jacobs and a senior engineer, minutes show. Christopher had already instructed all concerned to treat the process as &quot;secret&quot;.

On April 30 2001, the company agreed to pay a trust controlled by Jacobs &quot;the minimum of R12 000 per month ... for a contract period of three years&quot;. In the same month, Jacobs also billed LDK for R76 189.

The tender was awarded to Asap two months later.

By June 2002, with LDK signing off on the contract's progress, and public works payments beginning to flow to Asap, Jacobs was regularly presenting the company with monthly invoices for R20 000.

Jacobs admits receiving payments from both Asap and LDK, but denies acting as player and referee. &quot;I can wear many hats,&quot; he said. &quot;I have that ability, which is hard to find.&quot;

He said he had informed managers at public works and LDK of this. But the public works manager concerned, Chris Wallem, denied this. &quot;I have no recollection of him telling me that,&quot; Wallem said. He declined to comment further. It seems Christopher also wore many hats.

His mother and her husband are directors of Zoyus Security Consultants, a company through which Asap continues to channel large sums. Zoyus submitted its first invoice in May 2001, and by March 2002 was regularly invoicing Asap for amounts ranging up to R250 000. That year alone, Zoyus was paid at least R1-million.

Questioned about this, Jacobs said he controlled Zoyus and that the payments were intended to reward him for marketing Asap. Du Plessis also said the money was a &quot;success-based&quot; fee for Jacobs. Neither admitted knowledge of Zoyus's relationship with Christopher.

Christopher denied knowing anything about Zoyus, saying that while he was close to his mother, he had a difficult relationship with her husband.

&quot;Someone is really out to get us, this is making me sick,&quot; he said.

But Christopher was clearly pressuring Jacobs to pay him kickbacks.

In an email dated September 5 2001, Jacobs writes to Asap: &quot;R has been speaking to me about the 50% payment. The company has to pay 50% back on every payment received by the company from the client. It is very important that this is done because this is what was agreed ... Mr R has called me yesterday to ask if the transfer has been done ... I thought I would put this on an email to you as the phones cannot be trusted.&quot;

Confronted, Jacobs claimed the email referred to another Asap supplier for work done on the R12-million asset-tracking project. That project began more than two years later.

Christopher's credibility is further damaged by the fact that he bought Cuban cigars worth more than R30 000 from a store at Cape Town's V&amp;A Waterfront between February and July 2003, and Asap paid.

Christopher claimed he had picked up the cigars as a favour for Jacobs. &quot;He had a cigar club, he phoned me, and I was at the waterfront, so he asked me to fetch them.&quot; He admitted smoking a few of them.

But Jacobs and Du Plessis contradict this, saying the cigars were bought as part of an arrangement with Mtwazi, who would hand them out as gifts to MPs.

More recently, Asap has been paying Christopher through two companies of which Jacobs is a director, vehicle-tracking specialist B'smart Solutions and Andulela Communications. These payments appear to have overlapped with Christopher's time at Sars.

Jacobs, Du Plessis and Christopher initially denied this, but are contradicted by internal correspondence.

On November 16 last year Jacobs wrote to Du Plessis: &quot;Russel needs us to look after him for the next six months financially with a salary, we have decided to incorporate him into B'smart as a director of marketing where he will be pursuing government sector directly and the 2010 World Cup. He requires a minimum of R78 000 per month starting 25th November 2006, he will also require a thirteen [sic] cheque. B'smart will invoice Asap for this amount including VAT.&quot;

On May 24 2007, the payments began to be routed through Andulela Communications, and the invoice for that month, also sent to Du Plessis, is for R140 000.

Du Plessis told the M&amp;G he had never heard of Andulela. He said B'smart helped Asap prepare tender documents.

Meanwhile, payments to Zoyus continue, and other Asap correspondence further contradicts the claim that they were intended for Jacobs.

On August 14 2006 Jacobs wrote to Du Plessis: &quot;I know you are busy with lots of shit, but can we please complete the transactions with Z, so that I can get some peace in my life, we need to finalise with the final amount of 300K, THIS IS BECOMING A HEAD ACHE, LETS GET IT DONE.&quot;

And on February 12 this year he wrote: &quot;Zoyus has an expectation of profit share on the last project completed. A payment of R500 000 + VAT is required as soon as possible. This payment will make the principles [sic] aware of Asap commitment to all other future contracts. Therefore it is very important that we maintain the relationship for the future business which is to be extremely lucrative. Please advise when this payment can be made as I need to report back soonest.&quot;

Parliamentary public affairs chief Luzuko Jacobs said: &quot;We are not aware of any untoward practices, but if there was any wrongdoing we hope the matter will be thoroughly investigated.&quot;

SAPS spokesperson Vish Naidoo said the police preferred to deal with problems internally so as not to reveal security deficiencies. Police training would help mitigate the impact of any problems, he added.

LDK's Paul von Zwiklitz refused to speak to the M&amp;G.

The Department of Public Works did not respond to emailed and telephonic requests for comment.

2.5 Zuma set to use conspiracy claims to avoid probe

Karyn Maughan, The Star, 24 August 2007

Jacob Zuma is sticking to his guns that &quot;political motives&quot; are underpinning the state's efforts to investigate him for fraud and corruption despite prosecuting bosses taking court action over his allegations.

And Zuma's counsel, Kemp J Kemp SC, hinted in the Pretoria High Court yesterday that the former deputy president might well use his conspiracy claims to justify why he should not be the subject of further investigation.

Kemp was arguing that Zuma should be allowed to intervene in the state's request to obtain information from banks and lawyers in the UK.

According to Kemp, the purpose of such information was &quot;to try to link Zuma to improper payments for purposes of prosecution&quot;. Zuma has previously described himself as &quot;disturbed&quot; by the state's renewed efforts to investigate him, months before the ANC decides who its next leader will be.

Attacking the state's efforts to gather potential evidence against him from both Mauritian and UK authorities, Zuma claims that the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) &quot;wished to engineer a situation whereby (I) would appear as a criminal/accused/suspect during the crucial period of the latter part of 2007&quot;.

Confronted by Zuma's refusal to back down from his &quot;vexatious, fictitious and scandalous&quot; claims, the state yesterday demanded that the Pretoria High Court throw his allegations out of court and order him to pay their legal bills as punishment.

&quot;It would appear that my learned colleague is persisting with the allegation that political motives and undertones are driving the state's investigation,&quot; said state counsel Danie Dorfling SC.

Asking that Judge Willem van der Merwe visit and treat Zuma's claims with censure, Dorfling yesterday said the issues that Zuma raised were irrelevant to his current court action and &quot;made absent of any concrete proof&quot;.

In an earlier response to Zuma's conspiracy claims, deputy director of public prosecutions Anton Steynberg stressed that the state &quot;has no interest in Zuma's political ambitions&quot;.

Legal representatives for Zuma, French arms company Thint and the state will go head-to-head in the Supreme Court of Appeals in Bloemfontein next week, when they will wrangle over the search-and-seizure operations conducted by the Scorpions two years previously and used to obtain the 93 000 documents on which the state's as yet unrevealed forensic audit of Zuma's finances was based.

2.6 Cuba's cure for health worker ills should add to the debate in SA

Terry Bell, Business Report, 24 August 2007

Health is going to top the trade union agenda over coming months - and not because of anything to do with the travails of health minister Manto Tshabalala-Msimang.

But there will be echoes of the statement by recently sacked deputy health minister Nozizwe Madlala-Routledge that a national emergency exists. (Only the term generally favoured is &quot;crisis&quot;.)

One of the root causes of this crisis is the admitted chronic shortage of healthcare workers, from technicians to nurses and doctors. Next Friday in Johannesburg, trade unionists and representatives of a range of non-governmental organisations will discuss this staffing crisis.

In the wake of the recent public sector strike, which highlighted the massive staff shortages, the government stressed that it had a human resources plan, designed to deal with the situation - which government spokespersons prefer not to refer to as a crisis.

But a crisis it certainly is, and today it will be discussed as such.

Cosatu president Willie Madisha will give the opening address at the conference, organised under the auspices of the Joint Civil Society Monitoring Forum.

By the end of the day, there may at least be some clarity about the extent of the problem and the potential of the government's human resources plan to deal with it.

Like so many issues debated, often vociferously, there is little wholly reliable data available.

However, it is generally recognised that there are nearly 30 000 vacant posts in the public health service; that most doctors graduating from medical schools leave the country; and that many resent the required year of community service after graduation. There are also some reasonable estimates of the extent of the problem in specific areas.

For example, Itumeleng Molatlhegi, the media officer for the Democratic Organisation of Nurses (Denosa), notes: &quot;To bring the nurse-patient ratio up to acceptable levels, we probably need 80 000 or more additional nurses.&quot;

Denosa estimates that as many as 40 000 nurses may have become migrant workers abroad. Of the 191 000 nurses registered in this country, fewer than 120 000 are currently working in the profession.

Proportionately, the situation regarding doctors is probably worse.

The healthcare staffing crisis applies in many countries. It is the focus of Salud, a new documentary film about the Cuban healthcare system and its international outreach programme. Salud will be screened in Johannesburg, Cape Town and Durban next month as part of the annual TriContinental Film Festival ( www.3continentsfestival.co.za ).

Festival organisers also plan to screen the film for health sector unions and healthcare workers, as well as communities in townships and informal settlements.

South Africa, Venezuela, Honduras, Gambia and Cuba feature in the film in a way that should add useful fuel to current debates about the state and orientation of the local health system.

Venezuela did not have sufficient health workers to staff its ambitious new community clinic-based health system. Venezuelan doctors, by and large, refused to work in the shanty towns - called barrios - and remote rural areas.

The solution: Cuban doctors. Venezuela now has about 20 000 Cuban doctors working in the field.

They are also training more than 17 000 students drawn from these areas to become &quot;community doctors&quot;, complete with medical degrees.

The film reveals something of the contribution Cuban doctors have also made to South Africa's health service. Several who are interviewed tell how shocked they were at the levels of poverty, malnourishment and illness in our rural areas. It is from these very areas that students are now being recruited to train in Cuba as community doctors. They will attend what is probably the world's biggest medical school, in Havana.

The film reveals that among the students from mainly disadvantaged communities and regions in 27 countries are Hispanic Americans and African Americans. They are given full scholarships on the understanding that they will return to serve their communities in the US.

The stress of the Cuban system, which has also been introduced to Gambia, is on health rather than illness; on prevention, rather than cure.

As Dr Paul Farmer of the Harvard Medical School in the US points out in the film, prevention is better - and much less expensive - than any attempted cure once a medical problem is diagnosed.

But to operate in this way, as Farmer, other medical specialists and former US president Jimmy Carter acknowledge, healthcare must be regarded as a human right and not a commodity. Which, in turn, means an equitable public health system.

For South African trade unions, this remains a remote goal.

However, the message of Salud may stiffen the resolve to fight harder to achieve it.

3 Nozizwe Madlala-Routledge/Manto Tshabalala-Msimang

3.1 Madlala-Routledge ordered to pay up

Angela Quintal, Cape Argus, 23 August 2007

Former deputy health minister Nozizwe Madlala-Routledge has been ordered to cough up at least R312 000 in airfares for an unauthorised trip to Spain and has also had her last pay cheque docked.

The axed deputy minister found herself without a final salary payment after it was initially deposited and then withdrawn to offset a subsistence allowance of about R8 000 she received for the Madrid trip.

It could not immediately be established whether the final payment was a full month's salary or a pro rata amount for the days she worked in August before President Thabo Mbeki fired her.

As the public media focus turned to Health Minister Dr Manto Tshabalala-Msimang, the department was tying up loose ends relating to her erstwhile deputy.

The Cape Argus has established that director-general Thami Mseleku wrote to Madlala-Routledge requesting that she reimburse the department for airfares to Madrid and back totalling at least R312 000.

He could not be reached for comment, but ministry spokesperson Sibani Mngadi is expected to respond formally on Thursday after consulting the director general.

Meanwhile Madlala-Routledge has asked for copies of the in voices, given that the money claimed is almost double the R160 000 the trip was originally reported to have cost.

Madlala-Routledge, her son and an adviser were to attend a conference in June hosted by the International Aids Vaccine Initiative, but returned home immediately after it was discovered that Mbeki had not authorised the trip as had been believed.

She told a news conference soon after her dismissal that the president did not believe the conference was for politicians.

Replying to a query, Madlala-Routledge's adviser, Sukhthi Naidoo, said: &quot;I can confirm that the former deputy minister has been sent a letter requesting reimbursement for the airfares with regard to the Madrid trip. The amount specified is R312 000, with the proviso that additional funds may have to be repaid.&quot;

Madlala-Routledge had asked for copies of invoices from Magic Travel, the department of health's in house travel agent, &quot;so that we may ascertain for ourselves the correct figure&quot;, Naidoo said.

She also confirmed that Madlala-Routledge's &quot;final salary payment was withdrawn to offset a subsistence allowance paid for the Madrid trip&quot;.

As indicated by Madlala-Routledge at a news conference two weeks ago, her office had received assurances that approval would be granted for the trip to Madrid, Naidoo said.

&quot;We are trying to establish, therefore, what we are liable for.&quot;

At that news conference Madlala-Routledge was asked whether she would repay taxpayers' money.

She replied then: &quot;I would like to be given an opportunity to explain what actually happened to an institution that has the authority to do so. Indeed, if I have to repay the money, I will have to find it. I respect the public and its money.&quot;

Madlala-Routledge, who is the sole breadwinner of her family, will now receive a backbencher MP's annual package of R572 873 - R300 000 less than her salary as a deputy minister.

She also faces possible disciplinary action by the ANC that could result in her expulsion from the party, although at this stage its national working committee has merely asked secretary-general Kgalema Motlanthe to talk to her.

Madlala-Routledge has been without her husband, Jeremy, during the furore. He is apparently on a peace mission to Palestine.
?  The Cape Argus established from conference organisers last week that Madlala-Routledge's hotel accommodation would have been sponsored.

But since she had returned to South Africa, organisers were not asked to foot her travel bill.

3.2 Axed deputy now owes almost R500 000

Angela Quintal, The Star, 24 August 2007

The screws are being turned on axed deputy health minister Nozizwe Madlala-Routledge, with a second government department claiming she owes money to the public purse.

The total now stands at almost half a million rands.

A day after The Star reported that Madlala-Routledge had been slapped with a R312 000 bill from the Health Department for airfares relating to a trip to Spain in June, Defence Secretary January Masilela confirmed that his department also wanted her to repay R116 357 dating back to when she was deputy defence minister more than three years ago.

The Department of Health has also warned that additional funds might have to be repaid.

The Democratic Alliance said that expecting her to pay for the Madrid trip was nothing less than a witch-hunt and smacked of double standards.

Masilela confirmed on Thursday that Madlala-Routledge had to repay R116 357, meaning that the total allegedly owed to the two departments now stands at R428 357.

The deputy health minister has already had her last salary cheque docked to offset a subsistence allowance for the Madrid trip.

Masilela said: &quot;The records of the Department of Defence show that after reconciliation of the former deputy minister's foreign subsistence and travel account, the balance due by her is R116 357,61. This amount was arrived at after a proper audit of the account was conducted.

&quot;The former deputy minister of defence will repay the money owed to the department like any other debtor,&quot; he added.

It is not clear why the Defence Department is trying to recover the money now.

Madlala-Routledge's aide, Sukhthi Naidoo, said on Thursday that the former deputy minister had not received notification of the money owed to the Defence Department and could therefore not comment.

Madlala-Routledge is the sole breadwinner and it is not clear how she plans to repay the money or whether she would consider legal action.

As an ordinary backbencher MP she will see her annual package decrease by R300 000 to R572 873.

Madlala-Routledge's husband Jeremy is currently on a peace-building mission to the Palestinian territory and she supports two sons.

The family will also have to find accommodation, as she is no longer entitled to the perks of high office, such as ministerial homes in Cape Town and Pretoria.

Health director-general Thami Mseleku, who wrote to Madlala-Routledge ordering that she reimburse the department for the airfares, could not be reached for comment on Thursday.

Mseleku was in the Eastern Cape with the National Health Council.

Health spokesperson Sibani Mngadi said that while it was originally reported that the trip would cost R116 000, Madlala-Routledge had incurred penalties on a package fare by returning earlier, while she also had to fly back on a different carrier than the one originally booked.

The department was acting against Madlala-Routledge in terms of the Public Finance Management Act, he said.

Madlala-Routledge, her son Simon, and Naidoo were to attend a conference in June hosted by the International Aids Vaccine Initiative, but returned home immediately after it was discovered that President Thabo Mbeki had not authorised the trip.

She told a press conference soon after her dismissal that the president did not believe the conference was for politicians.

In his reaction, Democratic Alliance MP Mike Waters said the attempt by the Health Department to reclaim the money was obviously nothing but a witch-hunt.

&quot;Questions need to be asked, for example, about the health minister's visit to Geneva in May for the World Health Assembly. This year, 28 government officers devoted 12 days of their time to this meeting.&quot;

The DA estimates the costs of this meeting alone totalled R1,23-million.

3.3 Cabinet backs Manto on eve of bitter legal scrap

Karima Brown and Amy Musgrave, Business Day, 24 August 2007

AS HEALTH Minister Manto Tshabalala-Msimang and the Sunday Times prepared to slug it out in court today over the newspaper's recent reports questioning her fitness as health minister, the cabinet has come out in support of her while going on the offensive against the media for &quot;sensationalist&quot; coverage.

The cabinet's support of Tshabalala-Msimang, while unsurprising in itself, will give a boost to the beleaguered health minister, who is fighting the biggest battle of her political life.

Yesterday, she dug in her heels and thumbed her nose at her critics, saying she would not step down unless evidence was provided that she had failed in her duty as minister.

Arguments by the Sunday Times and Tshabalala-Msimang on the return of the health minister's medical records is expected in the Johannesburg High Court today.

Last night, chief government spokesman Themba Maseko said that Tshabalala-Msimang would pay her own legal costs in the court case.

Tshabalala-Msimang yesterday rejected calls for her to resign, following allegations that she has a drinking problem and a theft conviction dating from 1976.

&quot;I'm not stepping down, because I don't understand why I should step down unless, as the president has said, you give him reasons for what it is that I have done,&quot; she said at a media conference in East London, broadcast by Cape Town-based e.tv. &quot;Have I neglected the duties assigned to me?&quot;

Asked to respond to the theft allegations, Tshabalala-Msimang said: &quot;It's a long story&quot;, to be told at another time. She did not respond to questions about alleged alcohol abuse.

While the cabinet said it took a &quot;dim view&quot; of the &quot;distasteful&quot; media coverage of embattled Tshabalala-Msimang, the political fallout has widened with a call for the prosecution of Sunday Times editor Mondli Makhanya.

Further upping the ante is a challenge from axed deputy health minister Nozizwe Madlala-Routledge over the health department's demands concerning the exact amount of money she owes for taking an &quot;unauthorised&quot; trip to attend an AIDS conference in Spain. Analysts say the latest developments indicate differences have now degenerated into a situation of political point-scoring and the personalisation of the crises around certain individuals.

The South African National Civic Organisation (Sanco) yesterday called on the National Prosecuting Authority to probe Makhanya for his role in one of the self-defence units operating in KwaZulu-Natal from the late 1980s to the early 1990s, and whether he had applied for amnesty.

Political analyst at policy think-tank Idasa Steven Friedman said Sanco's actions were not surprising.
The furore around the minister broke shortly after Mbeki fired her deputy for not being a &quot;team player&quot; and taking the trip to Spain. Madlala-Routledge was often at odds with Tshabalala-Msimang, especially over the rolling out of the government's HIV/AIDS plan.

Madlala-Routledge's adviser, Sukhithi Naidoo, said while the former deputy minister was willing to pay back any money she was liable for, the &quot;conundrum&quot; was the department's authorisation of an R8000 travel allowance for the trip that was supposedly unauthorised, Naidoo said.

Health director-general Thami Mseleku has already docked the R8000 from Madlala-Routledge's last salary.

Asked why the travel allowance was given to Madlala-Routledge even though the trip was unauthorised, health department spokesman Sibani Mngadi said these allowances were paid every day to officials and recovered later if necessary.

Madlala-Routledge is also concerned that the department wants her to cough up R312000 for air fares for the trip, when she believed the figure was closer to R160000. She has written to the department requesting all invoices relating to the trip.

Centre for Policy Studies analyst Aubrey Matshiqi said all the actors in &quot;this messy saga&quot; needed to ask whether they had acted in the public interest. With Bloomberg and Sapa

3.4 SANCO wants Sunday Times editor investigated

Citizen, 24 August 2007

The SA National Civic Organisation (Sanco) in Gauteng says it has asked the National Prosecuting Authority to investigate Sunday Times editor Mondli Makhanya.

In a statement on Thursday, Sanco said it had formally requested that Makhanya be investigated for not applying for amnesty from the Truth and Reconciliation Commission.

This stemmed from Makhanya's alleged time as a member of a self-defence unit in KwaZulu-Natal in the late 1980s to early 1990s, Sanco said.

NPA spokesman Panyaza Lesufi said he was out of the office and had not seen the request.

&quot;We can't say anything until we have seen the letter and it's only when we've seen the letter that we will verify the content.&quot;

Makhanya said he would refer to lawyers on the matter.

&quot;Initially I found it amusing but I actually find it quite disturbing and sinister.&quot;

Makhanya allegedly wrote under a pseudonym in 1991, that he had witnessed killings but &quot;could not bring myself to become party to any of the killings&quot;.

The Sunday Times recently reported that Health Minister Manto Tshabalala-Msimang was an alcoholic and convicted thief, leading to widespread media coverage and debate.

The African National Congress-led government and President Thabo Mbeki have stood behind Tshabalala-Msimang.

The Sanco statement called for the Sunday Times to suspend Makhanya and to re-instate him once the NPA &quot;had concluded the matter&quot;.

The organisation also called for the SA National Editors Forum (Sanef) to suspend the &quot;inclusion of the Sunday Times&quot; if Makhanya was kept as the newspaper's representative. -Sapa

3.5 Manto fails to make the grade

Belinda Beresford, Mail &amp; Guardian, 24 August 2007

The ANC came out in defence of embattled Minister of Health Manto Tshabalala-Msimang this week, reiterating its confidence in her ability to &quot;implement the policies of the ANC-led government in working to achieve better health for all&quot;.

Tshabalala-Msimang was appointed to her Cabinet post in June 1999. In the past eight years the track record of the department of health has not been encouraging, with poor financial management accompanied by failure on healthcare delivery.

Financial management
Derek Luyt of the Public Service Accountability Monitor (PSAM) says an examination of the Auditor General's and provincial annual reports would provide ample evidence for President Thabo Mbeki to remove the health minister on the grounds of performance failure.
For the past three years the Auditor General has issued qualified audit opinions for the national department of health, indicating that there are financial management problems. One analyst describes financial management problems in the department as &quot;very severe&quot; and says it is difficult even to find a publicly available routine expenditure review.

For the 2005/06 financial year the Auditor General described internal audit function at the department as &quot;ineffective&quot;, with most planned audits being postponed to the next financial year. The Audit Committee was not operational and held only one meeting -- at which there was no quorum. This was a repeat of the committee's performance in the previous financial year. So, for two years the department has been unable to set up something as fundamental as an Audit Committee. In 2005/06 only 8% of cases reported to the fraud hotline were investigated.

The national department of health gives about 90% of its budget to the provinces, but is required to oversee the provincial departments. The latest Auditor General's report gives a list of failures in this regard, including missing monthly and quarterly reports and failure to visit the provinces on a quarterly basis.

Qualified audit opinions indicate failure to monitor expenditure. One of the results can be overspending, or underspending and a compensatory spending spree at the end of the financial year as departments try to avoid having unspent money reclaimed by national treasury.

More troubling are audit disclaimers, which effectively indicate a financial black hole with an insufficient paper trail for the Auditor General to follow. The Eastern Cape, which some analysts regard as the most inept provincial health department in the country, has received audit disclaimers in nine out of the past 10 years for amounts totalling about R25-billion in state expenditure. (Information based on research from PSAM.)

Antiretroviral programme
Despite South Africa having the world's largest antiretroviral (ARV) programme, it has been calculated that only about 44% of people in need of ARVs are receiving them. Professor Nicoli Nattrass of the University of Cape Town estimates that of the 889 293 people who needed ARVs this year, 351 479 were receiving them through all public, private and NGO facilities. The slow expansion of the ARV programme has been attributed to lack of political will, lack of human and infrastructural resources and uncertainty caused by public statements about the respective dangers and merits of ARVs and traditional and complementary medicines.

Nattrass says government prevention and treatment programmes have probably saved about 369 000 lives. However, if national government had rolled out its programmes at the same speed as the Western Cape, another 343 000 deaths and 171 000 new HIV infections would have been averted.

Researchers are calling increasingly for nurses to be allowed to monitor patients on routine ARV treatment to relieve the pressure on doctors and to allow patients more flexible access to the programme. There is a growing demand for government to amend guidelines to recommend the use of tenofovir, an anti-HIV drug that is safer and has a better barrier to drug resistance. Medical personnel are growing frustrated at the lack of progress on this issue and at slow negotiations to bring down the costs of the drug.

Prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV
About 80% of relevant healthcare facilities offer prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) programmes to pregnant women. Yet the take-up rate is estimated to be less than 30%, something researchers attribute to patient fears and ignorance and failure by the health system.

Another deficiency is that most of the country offers a single drug form of PMTCT, where mother and child are both given nevirapine. The minimum required intervention suggested by the World Health Organisation is a two-drug regime, which is better at protecting the child and preventing drug resistance. The Western Cape has successfully managed to provide this programme to its pregnant women.
Recently the Treatment Action Campaign threatened to take the health minister to court over her department's failure to implement the WHO guidelines. The TAC says at least two provinces, in addition to the Western Cape, are capable of providing the better programme, but that both are reluctant to do so without the minister's approval. Aids-related complications are the biggest killers of pregnant women and the maternal death rate almost doubled between 1997 and 2004.

Tuberculosis
The TB crisis became highly public with the identification of cases of extensively drug-resistant (XDR) TB. XDR results from failed treatment of drug-susceptible TB infection. Health experts say the arrival of XDR highlights ongoing failures in TB treatment and prevention in South Africa, which has one of the highest TB rates in the world. In 2004 TB cure rates ranged from about 70% in the Western Cape to less than 50% in Mpumalanga. TB is the single-biggest killer of HIV-positive people.

In some of South Africa's known drug-resistant TB outbreaks the bacillus appears to have been transmitted within the healthcare facilities, indicating a failure of infection control. This week has seen reports of patients with drug-resistant TB being kept in general wards without special precautions -- a situation likely to lead to infection of other patients, visitors and healthcare workers.

Infant and child mortality
A report recently released by the Medicines Control Council has highlighted the number of preventable deaths among newborns. The report, by the Perinatal Problem Identification Programme, found that about one in five of the 23 000 annual infant deaths could be prevented. Among the factors it listed were lack of access to antenatal care for pregnant women, lack of education of parents and healthcare workers, failures of healthcare workers and the lack of trained personnel and facilities. South Africa's infant mortality has stayed almost unchanged in the past seven years. Four out of five deaths among children under the age of five are attributable to HIV-related factors.

Human resources
Capacity within the health department is at crisis point. By the end of March this year a third of skilled healthcare vacancies were unfilled, up from 27,2% in 2005. Retention and recruitment of staff is a growing problem as healthcare workers head for the private sector or overseas. Changes next year to the training of doctors will result in a year-long shortage of up to 1 000 community service doctors, who are often the mainstay of rural health facilities.

In a submission to the Human Rights Commission this year the Aids Law project says the number of nurses has dropped from 120 per 100 000 public sector users in 2000 to 109 in 2005.

The Auditor General has blamed lack of capacity in the department for some of the failings in financial management.

Compromised
Security at Parliament has been compromised by the poor performance of access control and camera systems.

Police Inspector Francis Symington, who acts as a liaison between SAPS and Asap, complained in 2004 that cameras in the presidential complex at Tuynhuys were malfunctioning. Other cameras in the ministerial parking lot and the garden bordering Adderley Street were also not working.

Symington had complained less, however, since Asap took him on a trip to Britain, Shane Jacobs confirmed. Since then he had been &quot;a godsend&quot; and a champion of Asap in a &quot;largely hostile SAPS&quot;, Jacobs said.

LDK, where Jacobs is now a director, is partly responsible for enforcing these quality of service issues with Asap.

Police spokesperson Vish Naidoo said the trip had not been authorised by the SAPS, and took place while Symington was on leave. As a result he was initially moved to other duties, and then returned to his post under tighter supervision.

People close to Asap said staff members had created &quot;backdoor&quot; passwords to the system, giving them access to its functions. Others had created passes giving them access to all areas of Parliament.

Electronic visitors cards are no longer issued in Parliament; instead visitors are handed an easily falsified slip of paper giving them access to most of the precinct. &quot;It is a nightmare, and nothing's being done about it,&quot; one parliamentary security source told the M&amp;G.

Parliament's spokesperson, Luzuko Jacobs, said: &quot;Security in and at Parliament is a police responsibility.&quot;

Ncumisa Kondlo
Ncumisa Kondlo, the widow of former Asap empowerment partner Thobile Mtwazi, is an ANC MP and South African Communist Party deputy chairperson. She was the Eastern Cape's welfare minister at the time the controversial parliamentary security contract was awarded.

Kondlo is executor of Mtwazi's estate. Asap paid her R120 000 in 2005 and R170 000 in 2006, company records show. Kondlo told the M&amp;G she received this money from Du Plessis on behalf of Mtwazi's children.

It is unclear whether these benefits were declared to Parliament, because Kondlo was excused on grounds of illness from making a declaration of interests last year.4 HIV/AIDS issues
4.1 Union leaders welcome report on Aids drugs

IOL, 23 August 2007

The Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) has welcomed a scientific report recommending drugs over healthier eating as a treatment for HIV and Aids.

This week a panel of 15 members of the Academy of Science of South Africa confirmed that &quot;no evidence whatsoever has been found to suggest that healthier eating was any substitute for correctly used medical drugs&quot;.

Cosatu spokesperson Patrick Craven said on Thursday: &quot;These findings reinforce the correctness of the policy in the HIV and Aids and Sexually Transmitted Infections National Strategic Plan for South Africa 2007-2011, which emphasises the need for ARV access and to integrate HIV and TB care.&quot;

He said the plan was a major breakthrough for South Africa's fight against HIV and Aids, which united the country behind a new campaign.

&quot;This report by distinguished scientists should help us to focus even more on implementing the plan's target of making antiretroviral treatment freely available to all those who need it.&quot;

Craven repeated Cosatu's call at its national congress last year that the department of health &quot;do its job to protect society from unfounded claims of cures for HIV and Aids in violation of the laws of the country&quot;.

&quot;We hope that this report will once and for all discredit 'remedies' for HIV and Aids advocated by the minister of health, such as eating garlic, olive oil, African potato and beetroot, and bogus 'vitamin cures' such as those peddled by Mathias Rath, and clarify the previous confusion these theories caused,&quot; said Craven.

The scientists' report said there was no scientific evidence specific to South African conditions backing the use of nutrition as the primary treatment for HIV and Aids and tuberculosis.

&quot;We agree with the scientists that 'until these remedies have been proven to do more good than harm we cannot support their use,' and note their view that 'consumption of virgin olive oil, African potato and garlic could, in fact, be harmful',&quot; said Craven. - Sapa

4.2 Call for an improved HIV treatment plan

Louise Flanagan, The Star, 24 August 2007

Doctors urge two-drug regimen for infected mothers

More than 60 000 babies a year could be saved from HIV infection if South Africa updated its treatment for their HIV-positive mothers.

This was stated yesterday by a group of Joburg doctors and academics working with HIV/Aids.

&quot;The driving cause of our worsening infant and child survival rates is HIV infection,&quot; said Dr Ashraf Coovadia, of Wits University.

&quot;HIV-infected children are 15 times more likely to die than HIV-exposed uninfected children. Without antiretroviral treatment, close to 40% of HIV-infected children die in infancy, up to 60% die before reaching 2 years and almost all die by 5 years of age.&quot;

Coovadia was speaking on behalf of a group of concerned clinicians, researchers and public health specialists all serving and working at, four academic hospitals: Chris Hani-Baragwanath, Johannesburg, Helen Joseph, and Coronation Women and Children.

The group said about a third of pregnant women in South Africa are HIV-positive.

To prevent the unborn babies from being infected by their mothers, the government runs the prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) programme. This involves administering a single dose of nevirapine to pregnant women during labour and to their infants within 72 hours of delivery.

The transmission of infection rate on this programme is about 9 to 25%, said the doctors.

A year ago, the World Health Organisation (WHO) revised its policy to recommend a two-drug regimen, or dual therapy, using nevirapine and AZT.

Dual-therapy transmission rates could drop to less than 5%, said the doctors.

&quot;This revised policy recommended by the WHO is the very least we could adopt, given that several other countries have opted for an even more vigorous approach, with triple therapy being the standard in places such as Brazil, a similar-sized economy to our own.

&quot;This translates to saving more than 165 new paediatric HIV infections per day in South Africa.&quot;

They said some parts of the country - like Gauteng, the Western Cape and KwaZulu Natal - were well geared to adopt the WHO recommendations.

&quot;If adopted as proposed, and implemented, there would be a several-fold decrease in HIV transmission overnight at many sites.&quot;

The government's National Strategic Plan (NSP) on HIV/ Aids aims to reduce mother-to-child transmission to less than 5%.

Coovadia said there was no way this target was possible with single-dose therapy.
HIV is also the leading cause of maternal deaths in South Africa.

&quot;In addition to the inherent tragedy of any maternal death, a mother's death compromises the survival of her children,&quot; said the doctors.

&quot;Several studies have shown there is an increase in child mortality in the year before and after a mother's death, regardless of whether the child is infected with HIV.&quot;

In South Africa, infected mothers with low CD4 counts (less than 200) qualify for triple therapy, which would also automatically protect their unborn babies; infected mothers with higher CD4 counts don't qualify, so their babies don't benefit.

Expert opinion proposes starting pregnant women on triple therapy when their CD4 counts are less than 350.

The doctors said that upgrading the treatment made sense medically, morally and economically.

They called it an &quot;inevitable step&quot; in keeping with the NSP and said they were ready to support the Department of Health in adopting and implementing the policy.

Dr Francois Venter, president of the Southern African Clinicians' Society, supported the call.
&quot;It's simpler and the outcomes are better,&quot; said Venter, who added that HIV was preventable.

&quot;We have the resources to make it a rare disease and we're not doing it.&quot;

4.3 Antiretrovirals will get a R5bn shot in the arm

Slindile Khanyile, Busines Report, 24 August 2007

The government would spend about R5 billion on antiretrovirals (ARVs) in the next three years to boost the domestic production of these drugs, the department of trade and industry (dti) said yesterday.

Increased local production of ARVs should make it economically viable for pharmaceutical companies to manufacture them locally and reduce costs of these drugs. Currently, all active pharmaceutical ingredients for making ARVs are imported, making it unviable for pharmaceutical groups to run manufacturing plants locally.

&quot;Manufacturing ARVs involves complex technology and is costly. A company must make large volumes to make it economically justifiable and if you have a three-year contract, the manufacturer can justify the investment,&quot; said Andrew Kudlinski, the director for geographic projects at the dti.

&quot;[South Africa] has the capacity to manufacture most ARVs locally but 100 percent of the active pharmaceuticals ingredients are imported and we can use state procurement to encourage the domestic manufacturing of [the ingredients] in the future,&quot; he said.

The announcement of planned spending on ARVs follows the release of the government's industrial policy earlier this month. The policy aims to boost economic growth and cut unemployment by fast-tracking the development of certain key sectors. The pharmaceuticals industry is one of the identified sectors.

Nimrod Zalk, the chief director of industrial policy at the dti, said the government was concerned about the import ratio in the drugs sector. The sector was worth R17.7 billion last year. According to the Medical Research Council, about 5.4 million people live with HIV/Aids in South Africa - the second-highest rate in the world after India.

&quot;We want to reduce our import levels and regain our export market,&quot; said Zalk.

He said it was important to ensure that regulation concerns regarding the pricing of medicines and the registration of drugs would not discourage investment.

&quot;While the prime function of the Medicines Control Council is to ensure the safety of the drugs, we must expedite drug registration to maximise investment. There are other issues of financing, skills development and protection of intellectual property that we are looking at,&quot; said Zalk.

The Pharmaceutical Industry Association of SA (Piasa), which represents the interests of pharmaceutical groups, has welcomed the government's attempts to encourage local production of ARVs.

Vicki Ehrich, the chief operating officer at Piasa, said: &quot;A strong locally based industry of multinational and local players is vital to ensure security of supply of pharmaceuticals in the country.&quot; Val Beaumont, the executive director at Innovative Medicines South Africa, looked forward to discussions on the dti's welcome announcement.

Mohamed Bodhania, chairperson of the National Association of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers, said the association would be in a position to comment in a week after the details of the policy had been discussed.

Last month Business Report reported that the draft Genesis study on the state of the pharmaceuticals industry in the country found that the sector was shrinking. It said the industry was losing jobs, had rising import ratios and manufacturing plants were closing.

Asked if the dti had taken the Genesis findings into consideration, Zalk said: &quot;Any recent research would have been taken into consideration, but no individual study informs government policy.&quot;

5.1 50 percent of workers to lose jobs as a result of price blitz

By Regerai Marwezu, ZimOnline, 23 August 2007

MASVINGO - More than 50 percent of Zimbabwean workers could lose their jobs before year-end as companies start counting losses from a controversial government blitz on prices.
A meeting held in Masvingo on Tuesday attended by the government's Pricing and Incomes Monitoring Taskforce, the local business community and labour representatives heard that several companies had started retrenching workers in response to the unviable operating environment.
A senior Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU) official told the meeting that at least half of the country's labour force will be out of a job by December as a direct result of the price crackdown.
&quot;About half of the country's entire workforce will be on the streets before the end of the year,&quot; said Misheck Gapare, who chairs the Masvingo chapter of the ZCTU.
Gapare said more workers will find themselves on the streets as companies continue to scale down their operations since the hurried introduction of the price slash exercise.
President Robert Mugabe last June ordered companies to slash the prices of goods and services by half to contain runaway prices, which had trebled within a space of one week.
The Masvingo Cattle Producers Association said its members were laying off workers in order to cut their losses after the government set limits on the wholesale and retail prices of beef.
&quot;We cannot continue to keep our staff when things are as bad as they are,&quot; said association chairman, Vitus Hakutangwi.
The ZCTU has warned that it was forging ahead with plans to call mass protests by workers this month to force the government to address worsening economic hardships in the country.
The mass protests would be called before the end of August after the union had briefed its members on the form and nature of the protests.
The move will likely deepen tensions in Zimbabwe which is in the grip of an unprecedented economic crisis that has manifested itself in rampant inflation of over 7 200 percent last June, widespread unemployment and poverty.
Police officers who attended the meeting said the arrest of business executives for overcharging, which has so far seen more than 12 000 people nabbed since June, was meant to prevent riots in a country already sitting on knife-edge due to political tensions.
&quot;We fear that people will revolt against the government if prices continue rising,&quot; said a senior Masvingo police officer who refused to be named.
The price blitz has triggered an acute shortage of goods after panicky consumers cleaned shop shelves of basic commodities.
Fearing a backlash from the shortages, Mugabe this week partially lifted the price freeze allowing prices of some goods and services to go up.

5.2 UN support staff on strike in DRC

Mahlatse Gallens, SABC, 24 August 2007

Thousands of support staff members of the United Nations Peace Keeping Mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo have embarked on a nationwide indefinite strike. The workers are demanding better salaries. They had given the world body 48 hours to respond to their demands.

The deadline expired on Wednesday evening. The Monuc mission is the largest peace keeping force in the world, but the upholder of human rights has been accused of being a violator.

The workers gathered in their numbers, blocking the entrance to the Monuc headquarters in Kinshasa, blowing whistles, chanting and beating drums. They have accused the world body of violating human rights and labour laws. They earn $1 a day, with no extra benefits such as medical care, travel allowance, maternity leave or extra pay for irregular hours.

While the UN security forces continue work as usual, administration work has come to a stand still. More than 2 000 locals are employed as support staff. Many of them working as drivers, interpreters, technicians and cleaners. They claim that other missions on the continent are paying locals better salaries. They accuse the world body of paying expatriates deployed here much more.

The workers are demanding $40 a day and have vowed to continue the strike action until their demands are met. Similar protests are said to be underway at UN offices across the country.

The United Nations was not available for comment.
