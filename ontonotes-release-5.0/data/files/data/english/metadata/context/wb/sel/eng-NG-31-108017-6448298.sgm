Hi group,

I have never really been into Puerh teas. Havin seen many posts
about it here I decided to try some. My local tea shop do carry
Puerh but when I asked whether it was cooked or raw the shop
attendant, not the owner, did not even know what I was talking
about.

The conversation was in Swedish and I suspect I may have used
the wrong word for cooked. We have a word "kokt" that is pronounced
quite the same as cooked, but means "boiled".

Does cooked rather imply "baked"?
Could someone please give a brief explanation of the process when
_cooking_ Puerh?

I did buy some, called "King of Puerh". I tried it a few times but
since then I mostly drink the same Oolongs as I have for several
years.

See

to find out what cooked Pu'er is.  You'll probably answer your next
ten Pu'er questions while you're at it.

Hello Lars,

Cooked or ripe pu'er refers to raw pu'er that underwent a man-made
accelerated fermentation process.  Basically, sheng/raw pu'er leaves
(maocha -- before they are compressed into various shapes) are spread
on the floor of the tea producer's indoor facility and then they are
covered in wet blankets.  This way, the leaves are exposed to constant
high humidity for an extended period of time (a month, more or less)
which allow them to ferment quickly (aka: controlled rotting
process).  In that short period of time, the usually harsh raw pu'er
is transformed into a mellower and smoother tea...making them more
drinkable / approachable than the harsh new raw pu'er. The "cooking"
process turns the leaves from green to black-red.  Poorly controlled
cooking process can result in nasty-tasting tea...or mold could form.
Different pu'er factories, as far as I've read, have their own
approach...but the basic process is the same.

Such is my understanding...

I'm not a language expert but I willing to bet the term "cooked pu-
erh" (shou pu-erh) is a mistranslation.

In Chinese, the word "shou2" (熟) can have two meanings: "fully
ripened" and "fully cooked". The first case applies to green fruits on
the vines and trees when they ripen to their full sweetness. The
second case is used when cooking raw vegetables and meat to doneness.
Since shou pu-erh was never really cooked with heat (the fermentation
temperature is not that high) but rather allowed to "ripen (to
sweetness)" through a slow fermentation as described by Phyll above,
I'm willing to bet that "shou pu-erh" should really have been called
"ripened pu-erh" and not "cooked pu-erh".

Look at the spent leaves.  If black it is shu,cooked if green then
sheng,raw.  You can see a mixture of both but that is another topic.
The term baked is applied to oxidation processing.  Puer is
fermentation processing.  If it is loose puer then it heretofore meant
shu.  Recently a green version has appeared but that is also another
topic.  What is discussed mostly here is the compressed architectural
version of shu or sheng in forms of cakes,logs,mushrooms,etc.  We use
the Chinese pinyin terms of shu or sheng which would probably be
different in Swedish.  The Chinese characters speak to the Chinese and
not us.  What we use is colloquial meaning like cook,raw etc.  For
example, we refer to the term Tuocha as bird nest but that isn't the
literal meaning at all.  Is the literal term Puer used in Sweden?

Quite true Lew. I have many sheng puerhs where the spent leaf is
indeed quite dark, and at a casual glance could be mistaken for shu.
Actually this color is often seen in the most coveted of aged sheng
pu.

Cooked puerh goes through a process (as Phyll mentions) that is very
similar to composting. Each factory closely guards the specifics of
their method as if it were a state secret. But, as Phyll mentions, it
is all essentially variations of composting.

I too have heard the term "ripe" used to describe black puerh. I first
heard the term used by a Chinese puerh wholesaler in Kunming. This guy
moved literally tons of puerh each month. So it is evident, at least
to me, that the term is indeed used in this manner in China to some
degree. I first heard the term "cooked" from an American dealer who
was living in China at the time. The term "cooked" seems to be the
most prevalently used term in the US. I prefer to use either
"shu" (shou) or "black" as that side steps the whole translation
issue.

If there is any interest I can post my pictorial series of pictures
again that show the cooking process.

I have to agree with Lew here.  *Looking* at the spent leaves can tell
little if you are comparing old sheng with old shou.  If it's a fairly
young tea, then yes, cooked pu'er is obviously much darker in black-
reddish color.  In fact, you don't need to go as far as looking at the
spent leaves.  They dry leaves will be telltale enough if it's a young
tea.  (a word of caution below)

Lars, I think you also need to know of a category in between sheng and
shou...and that is sheng/raw pu'er that has gone through a period of
"wet-storage".  Conceptually it is the same: it's raw pu'er that has
gone through some intended high humidity storage to accelerate the
fermentation of the tea.  But instead of covering them in wet
blankets, the tea is usually kept in a highly humid room (basement,
warehouse, humidor, etc).  This process is usually done by middlemen
(wholesaler, vendors, etc.) or the end-consumers, and not by the
factories.  In addition, there are degrees of wet storage depending on
the level of humidity and the period in which the tea is stored as
such.  The "cooking" process done by the factories is, essentially,
the wettest of all wet storage...I think you can see it that way.
(Caution: wet storage can make a raw pu'er appear older than it
actually is...so buying "old teas" deserves a caveat emptor warning in
itself.  Get old teas from trustworthy sources.)

So here comes the conundrum: is a tea called "shou" only if it was
processed by the factory to be shou, but it remains a "sheng" with the
added notation of "wet storage" (or no notation at all) if the process
is done by parties outside of the factories?

Well, black really muddies the water because, as you pointed out, old
puerh can be very black.  It confuses people.

Ripened is perhaps more accurate, but it is not entirely without merit
to call it cooked either, as the composting process actually generates
quite a bit of heat.  The internal temperature of the piles of rotting
leaves are, from what I'm told, much higher than the surroundings.  So
in a sense, the leaves are cooking themselves into sweetness.

Actually, old sheng and old shu still look/feel different, I think,
even if the old sheng is very black.  But to get into that is rather

When you drink shu like I do you understand the translated meaning of
black,cook,ripe is darn close.  Old anything ain't going to match it.
It stands by itself and is no fast forward to the future. I think shu
is the real secret of Puer both literally and figuratively.  Anybody
can make a sheng.  I don't know who started the myth that sheng will
turn into shu.

Probably people who've drank good sheng, well aged.

This is not to say that just storing it in any place will turn out
fantastic teas, but I can assure you aged sheng is far more

True, not to mention the confusion between black and red tea, eastern
versus western, definitions.

Didnt I read something somewhere where the Chinese authorities were
considering a different classification for "cooked" puerh? Something
to the effect that raw puerh is a true black tea, like Liu An etc, and
cooked puerh is something else.

Well, Shou was actually developed to imitate aged sheng, that was the
idea originally. The results, while not bad at all, pale in comparison
to a well stored mature sheng. The best shou I have ever tasted wont
compete with authentic mature sheng. I have yet to see a shou that
attained the depths of mature sheng, although I have seen some "aged
shous" that came a little close. I suspect they were composted a
little lighter than we typically see today so that some of the
original character still developed with maturity. I have also heard
the term "mixed" used in reference to these puerhs, but I have never
felt that I fully understood that term though. Is it a blend of sheng
and shou which is then compressed, or is it just a lighter composting
treatment? For example I have a mushroom that came from TTG that was
described as "mixed" but I dont see two distinct varieties in the dry
leaf. It definitely has that finish that comes close to aged sheng
though, that mulchy woodsy, hauntingly elusive sweetness.

The P in Puer stands for Preservation.  Any claims of aging are
nothing more than a snapshot of tea taste in time.  Proper storage is
required.

&gt; True, not to mention the confusion between black and red tea, eastern
&gt; versus western, definitions.

&gt; Didnt I read something somewhere where the Chinese authorities were
&gt; considering a different classification for &quot;cooked&quot; puerh? Something
&gt; to the effect that raw puerh is a true black tea, like Liu An etc, and
&gt; cooked puerh is something else.
">

I hope nobody thinks I'm being perverse or flippant, but I think it's
actually the reverse: that the Chinese authorities pushing this
distinction regard *cooked* (shu) Pu'er as a black tea, along with the
various hydro-fermented Hunan, Sichuan, and Guangxi teas that are most
popular among non-Han peoples far from coastal China.

My notes say zao3 means jujube.  It is the most common brick in
Chinatown.  My last kilo was $8.  It was Mydnight who also mentioned
mi xiang.

I don't doubt it, but cheap bricks are not the only things that go
under the Zao Xiang name.

I was told that they learned the technique from Guangxi Liubao
teamakers, who have used the "wo dui" process decades before Yunnanese
teamakers adopted it.  True?

Here is my write up on the relationship between Guangxi Liubao wo dui

Yes, I too have heard this, although I have not found a way to
collaborate it. The CNNP was so secretive about the whole development
process that it is hard to find much that can be validated. Along the
same lines, the CNNP developed their method in the early 70s, I have
heard rumors that there was another ripening process used on puerh as
early as the 50s. Once again I have not been able to collaborate it.

One thing I have learned in this journey is to seek collaboration.
Even amongst the Chinese there is much dissension and disagreement
surrounding puerh history. Throw in a heavy dose of the mysticism ,
that the Chinese seem to thrive on (great marketing tactic), and you
often wind with a very murky picture.

This suggests an interesting possibility. If no-one is currently making
"low-composted" shu Pu-erh, perhaps one could request a smallish batch
from some congenial manufacturer, using selected maocha. It would be
great to have a tea that (whether or not drinkable now) would mature in
just a few years. If the quality-vs.-age curve for the shu-sheng
continuum is parabolic, with a low composting sweet spot at (say) 4-7
years, we might have a winner. I'd buy into that experiment.

Or maybe it would just be like doing wet storage of sheng?

I don't remember on the top of my head, but those Menghai shou cakes
with formula numbers...some of formula #### is a low-fermentation
formula...and some are heavier fermented than others.  I need to look
