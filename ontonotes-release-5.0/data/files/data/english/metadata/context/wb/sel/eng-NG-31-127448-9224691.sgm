the teaching of ID, as proposed by louann_m here:

Why teaching ID in schools is unworkable

A recent position paper by the Discovery Institute (DI)
http://www.discovery.org/scripts/viewDB/index.php?command=view&amp;id;=2544
summarizes the substantive arguments in support of Intelligent
Design as follows:

&quot;The modern theory of biological evolution (&quot;neo-Darwinism&quot;)
makes two big claims: (1) the primary mechanism for evolution is
an unguided process of natural selection acting on random
mutations; and (2) all living things are ultimately descended
from a universal common ancestor.  Scientists have been raising
criticisms about key aspects of both claims.  For example, many
scientists have questioned whether the selection-mutation
process that accounts for small biological changes
(&quot;microevolution&quot;) is sufficient to account for the development
of fundamentally new biological features and structures
(&quot;macroevolution&quot;).  Other scientists have pointed out that
mutations, which are supposed to provide the raw material for
evolutionary innovations, are almost always harmful, and thus
would not be preserved by natural selection in the wild.  Many
scientists have also questioned how Darwin's mechanism can
explain the origin of animal body plans more than 500 million
years ago during a huge burst in biological complexity known as
the &quot;Cambrian Explosion.&quot;  It is important to note that
presenting scientific criticisms of existing scientific theories
is not the same thing as presenting alternative theories.  One
can present scientific criticisms of an existing theory (this is
a standard part of science) without teaching an alternative
theory (such as intelligent design).&quot;

After referring to a non-existent scientific position
&quot;neo-Darwinism&quot; which is ambiguously defined using the
meaningless or erroneous terms &quot;unguided process&quot; and &quot;random
mutations&quot; the arguments FOR Intelligent Design (ID) are
presented.

However we see that no arguments FOR ID are presented, only
perceived weaknesses in evolutionary theory are described.
Indeed the summary ends by emphasizing that there is no need to
teach the &quot;theory&quot; of ID.

By stating that &quot;the alternative&quot; need not be taught the DI is
tacitly admitting that it has no scientific theory to teach.  And
indeed it does not, since a scientific theory must make positive
predictions which can then be tested to provide confirmation or
falsification.  No ID model has ever been presented together
with a test protocol that would allow it to be verified, thus no
theory of ID exists to be taught.

However, if we assume that an ID theory does exist, what are
the implications for faith and for science if the &quot;ID
controversy&quot; is taught in schools?  Two consequences are
obvious:

(1) Teaching ID will inevitably lead to classroom discussions of
evidence supporting evolution such as the extinction of species
seen from the fossil record, as well as junk DNA, vestigial
organs, and pathogens.  This is likely to give the impression
that science contradicts faith thus causing students to question
their faith outside the supporting environment of home and
church.

(2) However much we may try to avoid it, presenting ID in
the science classroom will be asking science teachers to take
responsibility for part of the religious development of students.
Since such teachers may be christian, muslim, hindu, buddhist,
sikh, agnostic or atheist their real or perceived perspectives
will be diverse, leading to inevitable conflicts between science
teachers of one view, and parents of a different view.  This
will lead to endless controversy both interpersonal and legal,
using up valuable time of both teachers and school
administrators.

Thus we conclude that teaching the ID controversy in schools
will instead create endless new controversies leading to an
erosion of faith in students, a loss of social solidarity
between teachers and parents, and a dilution of the quality of
science teaching in American schools.

Suggestion: The science teachers have not, in general, been
prepared to teach these subjects, and therefore, at best,
would be put in a position of teaching their own point of
view.

I think the piece as a whole is ok. However, I think the two previous
paragraphs are a bit weak, because first you state that arguments in
favour of ID are presented while later denying this. Maybe it would be
better to combine these two paragraphs into something like this (and I
apologize up front for mistakes -&gt; I'm not a native English speaker):

A problem: The DI passage you cite does not advocate the teaching of
ID in schools, but rather, the &quot;teach the controversy&quot; fall-back
approach. And the major argument here is that the DI position is
simply a lie: Within the scientific community, there is nothing
remotely approaching a &quot;controversy.&quot;

Absolutely wrong right off the bat.  Just ask the guys over at the
NCSE.  The theory of evolution says nothing about &quot;unguided.&quot;  You
might want to use the wording of the National Academy or the NCSE.

There certainly are controversies.  Just not of the type that the DI
claims.

The relative importance of drift vs selection, the role of sexual
selection, the balance between gradual evolution and puctuated equilibrium
are all controversies.

However, all the controversies are about mode and mechanisms of evolution.
Precisely none are about whether evolution occurs, whether it is
responsible for the diversity of life, or whether humans and the other
great apes share a common ancestor.

I agree with the various statements which you have given, but I think
that it is not necessarily a good idea to restrict oneself to arguments
which revolve around legal and constitutional issues. I'd think it might
be a good idea to offer some sort of preliminary statement which is
independent of specifically U.S. considerations.

I'll offer a *very* rough version of the kind of thing I have in mind:

&quot;In modern society, it is becoming increasingly important for
individuals to have a good grasp of basic science. Apart from the
importance of a having a scientifically literate workforce, many policy
debates revolve around scientific issues -- policies on global climate
change and stem-cell research to give only two examples -- and a
democratic society cannot function effectively if its citizenry lack an
understanding of the science underlying these issues.

Unfortunately, many people hold a variety of misconceptions of science.
In particular, the following three popular misconceptions of science are
extremely widespread.

(1) The idea that science is simply a body of facts which are known to
us.

(2) The idea that science is defined by its subject-matter, and that
certain subjects (the origins of life, for example) are scientific in
nature, whereas other subjects (beauty, for example) are non-scientific.

(3) That scientific ideas are inherently superior to non-scientific ones.

In fact, none of these are defining properties of science. Science is
defined by its methodology. Science provides us with a way of
approaching problems and of gaining knowledge through observation and
the formation and testing of hypotheses.

To understand science properly, it is the process by which results were
obtained which must be understood and not merely the results themselves.
While some subjects have proven more approachable by science than
others, it is not the subjects themselves which are scientific, but the
way in which they are approached. Science, for example, has proven very
successful in describing the biological processes underlying life, but
it tells us very little about the relative merits of a painting of a
flower by van Gogh and one by Georgia O'Keefe. That, however, does not
in any way devalue non-scientific discussion of the latter topic.

Confusion regarding the nature and working of science is already
reinforced by various abuses in popular culture and advertising. Any
introduction of Intelligent Design (or Creation 'Science' in any guise)
as serious scientific proposals would serve only to further students'
misunderstandings of science since, regardless of how one might feel
about the conclusions of the ID movement, ID and its various cousins are
not proposals which rely on the scientific method to reach their
conclusions. While ID deals with subject matters which science has also
addressed, it does so in an entirely nonscientific manner, and teaching
it as science would serve only to shift students' attention away from
the methodological principles which are the defining element of
scientific investigation&quot;.

OK. I admit that it needs considerable work. I simply feel that it is
important to emphasise the fact that teaching ID as science will not
only mess with students understanding of biology, but also their
understanding of science more generally.

Rambling,
André
