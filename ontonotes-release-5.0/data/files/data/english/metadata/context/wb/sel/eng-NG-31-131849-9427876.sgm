&quot;Whoever said money can't buy happiness simply didn't know where to
go shopping.&quot;

-- Bo Derek, Actress, Model

Last year, me and some friends started a performance art project
called &quot;Buy More Stuff&quot;. The idea was simple: Tell people that they
have to Buy More Stuff! If they don't, the store will run out of
stuff...or they'll run out of time!

This ended up being a lot more fun than anyone expected, so we're
doing it again this year during the most frenzied &amp; freaky shopping
days of the year, including this Friday. Black Friday. November 23rd.
The day after Thanksgiving.

Here's how you can participate:

# Get dressed up in nice corporate-slave clothes (see &quot;dressing&quot; below)

# Make nice signs and flyers that say &quot;Buy More Stuff&quot; (see &quot;making
signs&quot; below)

# Meet at Westlake Park at 1 PM, during the peak of the feeding
frenzy that surrounds the holidays (see &quot;finding us&quot; below)

# Encourage people to Buy More Stuff! (see &quot;Our Message&quot; below)

################
# OUR MESSAGE! #
################

The message is very, very simple:

# Buy More Stuff!
# Hurry!
# If you don't hurry, they'll run out of stuff...or you'll run out of time!

This isn't political -- we have no social or economic agenda. This
isn't judgmental...We are no better or worse than the people downtown
to shop. We Buy More Stuff, just like everyone. And when we're done
with Buy More Stuff, we're going to Buy More Stuff, probably drinks.

Note: Some people get really pissed off by this sort of thing.

##########
# DATES! #
##########

We meet at 1 PM at Westlake Park in downtown Seattle on each of these days:

# Fri Nov 23 -- Black Friday!
# Sat Dec 15 -- The official Buy More Stuff orgy!
# Sun Dec 23 -- The Most Desperate Day of the Year!

For more information, please see the website:

# http://BuyMoreStuff.org

If you'd like to buy more Buy More Stuff stuff, go here:

# http://www.cafepress.com/buy_more_stuff

Please note: The money that we make by selling Buy More Stuff stuff
will be used to buy more stuff, like signs and flyers that say &quot;Buy
More Stuff&quot;.

#################
# MAKING SIGNS! #
#################

Make your Official Buy More Stuff sign by following these easy directions.

# Don't be a dick and show up with some lame-ass hand-lettered sign.
If you do that, you're not Buying More Stuff, right?

# If you want a sign you have to print and laminate a sign. (Rain,
yo!)  Official artwork and directions about how to have the folks at
Kinko's make 'em are located here:

http://www.buymorestuff.org/art.html

# Download, print, laminate, put on stick. Bring extra flyers and
signs if you can!

#############
# DRESSING! #
#############

Put on your best clothes! This ain't no hippie drum circle. You want
people to Buy More Stuff? Then you gotta look like you've got stuff,
too. Good stuff, if you know what I mean. None of that geriatric
hippie raver lube-soaked tribe.net-dwelling burner drag shit. Got it?
This is what we looked like last year:

Note: It's cold. It might rain. Dress accordingly.

messages about where we are and what we're doing and what we need (ie,
coffee, more flyers, bail money etc) please join Swaggle, Jordan
Schwartz's ass-kicking text messaging service. It's like a mailing
list, but it uses text messages to communicate.

More Stuff as the situation unfolds.
