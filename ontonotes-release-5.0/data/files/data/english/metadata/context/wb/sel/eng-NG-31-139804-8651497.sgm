List:

I'm presenting at a conference this October and if the weather looks
good I'm planning on riding (with the trailer and laptop in tow). I'm
looking at 160 miles each way, which I'll break into 2 days each trip.
I'll need camping or hotel somewhere around mile 100-80 on the first
day out.

Anyone have any experience traveling north of the Adirondacks and west
of Montreal?
Here's a link to a rough route (note, this is straight from Google - I
need to route to avoid the major roads...)

I won't comment on the U.S. side.

In Canada, the section south of Salaberry-de-Valleyfield is mostly flat.
There are some nice farms almost everywhere, with nice orchards near the
U.S. border. In the fall, you will have lots of choices for apples
around Franklin. Brooks road (1st yellow road north of the border) west
of highway 201 is quite scenic, and you might like to &quot;waste&quot; some time
on highway 202 between Franklin and Huntingdon, then on highway 138 (or
the tiny local road besides it) to Ormstown. The latter stretch would be
along the beautiful Châteauguay River.

Then between the two bridges in Salaberry-de-Valleyfield, you'll be
riding through industrial and suburban wasteland. Not so nice. Still
safe, however.
Incidentally, if you're looking for other routes, the bridge in the
middle of the island (named &quot;Pont Saint-Louis&quot; on the map, though I
think it's called Pont Saint-Louis-de-Gonzague&quot;) has been closed most of
the time over the last 5-6 years. I don't know its current status, so it
might be wiser to avoid!

Then north of Salaberry-de-valleyfield, I think that highway 201 is not
the best route. While it's a bit scenic, there are bits with lots of
traffic and it has narrow, non-paved shoulders. And you're leaving it
inland to ride through harduous local roads. I think the only nice point
of that ride would be the gingerbread houses of Vankleek Hill (Ontario).

I would suggest either of these routes:

1. * http://tinyurl.com/2uw68o*
That leads you all the way on highway 201, but then west of Rigaud, it
brings you along the small Rigaud River (uphill ride). At Saint-Eugène,
the river stops being nice, so you turn North to reach the
Chute-à-Blondeau Provincial Park and use the old highway (County Road 4)
to reach Hawkesbury.
In Québec, there is basically no other choice but highway 148. Lots of
traffic, but paved shoulders almost all the way.
Alternative 1: to save a few km and a few hills, continue on highway 342
west of Rigaud. When you reach the Ontario Border, cross over the 417
and use the service road which parallels highway 417, until you reach
County Road 4. The first 2 km are hard gravel, very doable on a road
bike; the last 3-4 km are sealed tar or something like that.

Alternative 2: Use the ferry at Pointe-Fortune (no detour) or at Hudson
(a 20 km detour) to cross the Ottawa river, and ride on highway 344.

P.S. The Provincial Park is very nice (but expensive, and we don,t have
hiker-biker sites in Canada). In case you wonder, there is no entrance
on the Québec side (near Pointe-Fortune); the road shown on Google maps
is a locked emergency exit only.

2. * http://tinyurl.com/2brwff*
This is the same as above. However, West of Hawkesbury, you would
continue on local roads in Ontario (CR 4 to L'Orignal and CR 24
afterwards), and then cross via the Lefaivre to Fassett ferry.
Nice rural road, with absolutely no traffic and nice vistas of the
Ottawa river. It's slightly &quot;hillier&quot; and therefore won't be as fast as
highway 148.

Note : this variant also works with route 3.

3. * http://tinyurl.com/37b287*
This is basically a no traffic route, though farmlands. No major
feature, though. Use it if you really want to decompress.
Alternative : you could ride further West on highway 2 to Lancaster (not
shown on Google, because it's very close to highway 401), then use
highway 34 North to Hawkesbury. About 10 miles longer, but less steep
&quot;hills&quot;.

Have a nice trip.
