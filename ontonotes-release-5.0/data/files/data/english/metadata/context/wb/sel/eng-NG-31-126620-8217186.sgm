Italian Style Meat Loaf With Sage
Published in: Acooksbooks

Ingredients

2       pounds  lean ground beef
2               onions -- finely chopped (I use red and yellow)
1/4     pounds  pancetta -- finely chopped
15              fresh sage leaves -- finely chopped (see tip below)
1/4     cup     freshly grated parmesan cheese
2               eggs -- lightly beaten
3/4     cup     fine -- dry bread crumbs

Instructions

1.  Fold a 2 foot piece of aluminum foil in half lengthwise.  Place and
bottom and up the sides of the slow cooker stoneware.  *(I actually
use two
of these so the meatloaf is sitting on a cross - more stable to
remove this
way)*
**
2.  In a large bowl, combine ingredients and mix well.  Shape into
loaf and
place in middle of foil strip on bottom of slow cooker.   Cover and
cook on
low for 8 to 10 hours, or on high for 4 to 5 hours, until juices run
clear
when meat loaf is pierced with a fork or a meat thermometer reads 170
degrees f (75 degrees c).   Lift loaf out using foil strip and, using a
large lifter (sturdy spatula) transfer to a warm platter.    Garnish
with
fresh sage leaves, if available.   Pour juice into a sauceboat and serve
alongside with plenty of fluffy mashed potatoes.

Tip:   You can substitute 1/2 cup chopped Italian parsley and 1/2 tsp of
dried sage for the fresh sage leaves.

My notes:   I do not pour the juice into a sauceboat to serve as a gravy
because to me that is too full of whatever fat was in the meat. . .
and if I
were to skip using fresh sage (I have it growing in my garden most of
the
year) I would probably use more than 1/2 tsp of dried sage.

Recipe Notes

Here's the receipe I keep promising to post, and then keep forgetting to
post.  I actually remembered to bring the book it is in, into work
today.     I am a HUGE believer in keeping the history/source of the
recipe
and always giving credit to the original author -- so in keeping with
that
ethic, this recipe is from the book, '150 Best Slow Cooker Recipes&quot; by
Judith Finlayson.    This is one of my favorite crockpot/slow cooker
books
(along with the Rick Rodgers book on slow cookers).  These recipes in
these
books are not what I call the typical  &quot;dump it all in raw at 8am and
slop
it out on the plate at 6pm&quot;  slow cooker recipes which I personally
cannot
stand because those are almost universally inedible (to me and my family
anyway).  I have always maintained that the crockpot is one of the
hardest
appliances to use and get really good-to-great results from.    So
this book
from Judith Finlayson, in most of the recipes, does have more prep steps
than some of the crockpot books out there, but the results are well
worth
it.

Anyway - that being said, this recipe I have made in my crockpot and
also in
my oven like you would any other meatloaf.

&quot;My idea of pure heaven is to spend a day in the kitchen, peeling,
chopping, and stirring while the words of a good book fill the air
around me.&quot;
