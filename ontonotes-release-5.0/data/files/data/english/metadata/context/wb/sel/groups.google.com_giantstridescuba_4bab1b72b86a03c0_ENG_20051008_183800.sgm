We know that there are a lot of divers who trained and went diving with
us over the years. We're hoping that you'll want to get involved with
Giant Stride International and continue the Giant Stride traditions
that brought us together and made for so much fun.
Please share your memories of previous good times with Giant Stride.
Regardless of what it is, we'd like to hear your stories. A dive trip
we took together, a course you took with us, fun in the pool, maybe it
was the Blue Hole or Aurora Reservoir. It's all good.
It's all welcome here.

Hey Wayne,
Well in this topic I can remember my first dive trip when 31 of us went
to
Roatan, what a way to spend my first ocean diving. Though I haven't
been diving much in the last couple years, I always look for places to
go. I now work for Frontier Airlines, so i can fly free to a log of
places and get discounts to many more. (tough with a little guy running
around the house). We did make are way to San Diego a few weeks ago and
saw quite a few dive shops set up on the shore and many boats out in
the distance. It may be a place I might have to fly to and bring my
gear next time.

Hey Wayne !

I can't believe that it has been almost 8 years since my first panicky
snorkel trip arount the Pierpoint pool! Never thought I'd make it and
yet a year later there I was as a DiveCon helping others through the
same type of thing. Well, okay, maybe not like THAT! So many memories
- don't even know where to start. Tim and I haven't been in the water
for several years - and miss it. We'd love to jump back in somewhere,
sometime!

Best to Jeanette!

Janet

Hey Troy!
Good to hear from you. Your life sure has changed since we first met.
I remember all the fun we had at Giant Stride and the great work you
did becoming a Dive Leader. Those who have to overcome difficulty often
become the best trainers of others.
I hope your journey continues to be a happy and prosperous one. Any
time you're in this neck of the woods you've got a place to stay. We
should also get wet again together. We're pretty regular with trips to
Monterey Bay and Giant Stride's new website will launch soon with group
trips to consider.
Hopefully we'll cross paths again soon. Give Momma Bear and Baby Bear
a hug for us and we'll look for you again here.
Shoot us a picture when you get a chance.

Yo Janet,
Eight years! Has it been that long? It seems like yesterday and I sue
remember the hurdles you overcame to make your mark as a Dive Leader.
I have great memories of our trip to Cozumel. There was one dive where
we all got into the fast water and I'll never forget the look on your
and Tim's faces when we got back on the boat after that one. We
definitely should get ourselves back there before any of us gets old!
Send me an e-mail with an update. I hope the boys are well and that we
get a chance to see you guys before too long. Jeannette says to say
hi.
Wayne
