Now Finicky About X-Face Headers?

So I've got the latest slrn working.  On attempting to sent my first
post with it, I got a warning that my X-Face header was too long to deal
with.  WTF?  I hope *that* warning can be disabled.  With posting
forced, the X-Face works fine.

To get UTF-8, which doesn't interest me, I have to put up with this? :)

No, setting fold_headers to zero doesn't matter.  The warning still
occurs with every post.

Sounds like should.

But it also sounded like

set fold_headers 0

should've.  ;)

I don't mind the other warnings; they keep me on my toes.  Too bad I
can't just kill this new one.

With this post, I'm trying

set reject_long_lines 0

which, also, is overkill (I'd *like* to be reminded if theyr'e in the

Try

set reject_long_lines 0

From the manual:

----------
6.91.  reject_long_lines

Type: integer
Default: 2

If set to 1, slrn will not allow you to post articles
containing non- quoted lines which are longer than 80 characters.
If you set it to 2, slrn will merely issue a warning that you can
decide to ignore (e.g.  when posting source code). Setting this
variable to 0 turns the check off. Please note that long lines
are generally considered bad netiquette.

&gt;&gt;&gt; SUMMARY

&gt;&gt;&gt; So far, these are useless for this issue:

&gt;&gt;&gt; set fold_headers 0
&gt;&gt;&gt; set netiquette_warnings 0
&gt;&gt;&gt; set reject_long_lines 0
&gt;&gt;&gt; set wrap_flags 6

&gt;&gt; So when you either start a new post or reply to an existing post, does
&gt;&gt; the line wrap in your display or does it always show as one long line
&gt;&gt; regardless of screen size?

&gt;&gt; Reason I ask is that I notice my references and X-face line wrap at the
&gt;&gt; screen border, if I shrink the screen (editor window) the wrap changes.

&gt;&gt; Why would you not use wrap_flags 7?

&gt;&gt; ...
&gt;&gt; 6     wrap quoted material and body
&gt;&gt; 7     wrap headers, quoted material and body
&gt;&gt; ...

&gt;&gt; Since you DO want the header to wrap?

&gt; SECOND REPLY -- with more information:

&gt; Anyway, this looks irrelevant, because it applies to word wrap *in the
&gt; pager*, and this warning comes when I'm *posting* -- from my editor,
&gt; which is not the pager.
">

Okay, okay...maybe it technically is the pager that slrn's posting from.
Still, this setting seems to be about *display* and the warning is about
posting.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

">

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&lt;q - my emphasis&gt;

&gt; 6.142 wrap_flags

&gt; Type: integer
&gt; Default: 3

&gt; This variable controls what text is wrapped IN THE ARTICLE PAGER when
&gt; pressing the wrap_article key (bound to ``W'' by default):

&gt;&lt;snip&gt;

&gt;&lt;/q&gt;

&gt; Also note that I've been grasping for straws with the various wrap
&gt; settings anyway, because the warning is about &quot;folding&quot; -- and I can
&gt; find only one slrn setting for that:

&gt;&lt;q&gt;

&gt; 6.29 fold_headers

&gt; Type: integer
&gt; Default: 1

&gt; When encoded 8bit characters are present, slrn folds header lines that
&gt; would exceed the 76 character limit imposed by RFC2047. However, some
&gt; servers seem to choke on folded header lines, so you might have to set
&gt; this to zero if you get an error message when trying to post long
&gt; header lines.

&gt;&lt;/q&gt;

&gt; Strange!  Right now, in vim, my X-Face header *is* wrapping.  Not that
&gt; that necessarily has anything to do with &quot;folding&quot;, which, based on the
&gt; use of an apparently separate term, I take to be technically different.

&gt;&lt;clickety&gt;

&gt; And I still have to force the post to go when offered the warning.

Here's a screen cap it this &quot;header fold&quot; warning.  There's something
odd about it.

http://blinkynet.net/stuff/comp/fold_warning.jpg

Note that it says it's about line 0 ?

That X-Face header is the 11th one as I veiw the headers at the top of
this post.

(Also, with this post, that header *in my editor* is not wrapping;
earlier today when composing a reply I looked up there and it *was*
wrapping.  Huh?  Either way, I got the warning.  (And either way, I'm
not convinced that &quot;wrap&quot; and &quot;fold&quot; are the same in the context of what
slrn is trying to do.  &quot;Wrap&quot; and &quot;fold&quot; certainly mean different things
in vim, for instance.)

I wonder if slang2 sees something in the header line that makes it think
it carries over to the next line. We use different editors (vi/gvim) but
somehow I don't think that is the issue either. For giggles would you be
willing to test against my post_editor command?

set editor_command &quot;vim -f '+set tw=72' +%d '%s'&quot;

In my editor window both my refs and x-face line wrap and adjust based
on windows size, hence my previous question. Like you I also do not have
any of the previously mentioned slrnrc settings in my current config
either.

How about also posting your set custom_headers / followup_custom_headers
lines. You said above that when posting a reply you noticed it was
wrapping, is it possible that that was actually an original post rather
than a reply and perhaps the 2 act differently?

Second Reply.  This one's using your editor command.

Not surprisingly, same warning.  I will have to force the post to send

Aha!

See lines 1054 to 1069 for the source of your problem.

A very dirty fix, assuming you're compiling from source, might be to
edit line 1056
if (pos &gt; 77)
to include a number long enough to accommodate your X-Face.

Your X-Face contains a long string with no white space, and therefore
can't be folded.  This could cause problems in transmission if your
articles pass through old servers that can't handle header lines
longer than 78 octets. slrn is merely following the standards'
recommendations by complaining, while still allowing you to force the
post because the 78-octet limit is unlikely to cause problems nowadays.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Note that it says it's about line 0 ?

That seems to be a bug in generating the error message. Somebody with
a better knowledge of C than mine (i.e. *some* knowledge of C) may be
able to track it to its source.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; That X-Face header is the 11th one as I veiw the headers at the top of
&gt; this post.

Folding of headers refers to this sort of thing:

Subject: this is an unfolded header

Subject: this
is
a
folded
header

You'll also see a lot of folded headers in email, e.g. the Received:
header.

Headers can be folded manually to achieve formatting effects (though
slrn doesn't currently seem to support this, and unfolds headers for
display when sent by other newsreaders), and are usually folded
automatically if they're long enough to cause problems in
transmission. See RFCs 822 and 2822 for details, but the magic numbers
are 78 and 998: folding at 78 octets is recommended, folding at 998
octets is probably essential if the post is to propagate at all.

As other have said, nope.  The earliest slrn that compiles with slang-2
is 0.9.8.1pl1, which is available from the slrn.org website.  As an added

Can they use 8-bit characters?

Is one or more 8-bit characters the reason why my particular X-Face
header broke slrn and others' X-Faces apparently didn't?

Remember, as *stated* in the warning, it was a &quot;fold&quot; issue.

Is the following relevant?

&lt;q&gt;

6.29.  fold_headers

Type: integer
Default: 1

When encoded 8bit characters are present, slrn folds header lines that
would exceed the 76 character limit imposed by RFC2047. However, some
servers seem to choke on folded header lines, so you might have to set
this to zero if you get an error message when trying to post long
header lines.

&lt;/q&gt;

I've always used the default strings supplied.  Now I'm not using
anything.  I throw myself on the mercy of pl2.1.  Not without

I did it in mime.c by adding a couple of lines of code that Thomas
W. provided.  It was just an if statement that disengages the
length-checking routine if the header being parsed is X-Face.
Look back for all of Thomas's posts in this group (there are very
few) for the last three days and you'll find the code in one of
his responses to me, and he also tells you where it goes in that
post.  mim.c ia in the src subdirectory of the directory untarring
slrn creates.  (I won't be home for a few days, and that's where
my notes are, so this is the best I can do -- sorry.)
