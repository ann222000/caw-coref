&gt; I can't pretend Bonds' 756 homers truly matter because there's no way

&gt; I can't pretend Bonds is the legitimate successor to Aaron because
&gt; there's simply too many questions and too much evidence to suggest

&gt; This isn't about Bonds himself. This isn't about him being as

&gt; conspiracy theorists, this isn't about him being an African-American.
&gt; If this were the very freckled and very white Mark McGwire in Bonds'

&gt; the accomplishments of someone who used illegal performance
&gt; enhancers.&quot;

Check out the above graphic.

It clearly shows the top 22 long-ball baseball players (including
Rodriguez) and their performance by age.

You can clearly see:

1/ Babe Ruth was on some sort of drug, probably steroids, starting at
age 30.
2/ Rodriguez is going to break Bonds record, and probably has been on
steroids since birth
3/ Bonds only started using steroids at age 35
4/ Palmeiro deserves credit for being the most consistent player--note
his performance did not diminish at all with age.  He might in fact be
the best &quot;age-adjusted, and for his ability, the best&quot; home-run hitter
of all time.

Fun graphic -- thanks.

This says it all to me, though:

&quot;Ted Williams has the highest career batting average of any player
with 500 or more homers (.344).&quot;

Throw in his career OBP, and he's clearly the best hitter to ever play
the game.

And he served his country in two international wars, to boot.

----------   ASTONISHINGLY, like the millions of U.S.citizens who
still believe Saddam Hussein was behind the 9/11 attacks, many
benighted fans of BALCO Barry still believe he would have reached 756
home runs without using illegal, banned, proscribed, unfair, cheatful-
chemical performance-enhancement drugs!

Considering he was on a pace to hit 630 HRs, or less, when he started
taking undetectable steroidic supplements as he reached age 36, one's
intelligence and powers of reasoning would have to be low to even
consider such a notion.

And to weakly, limp-wristedly accept that his weight soared from 200
pounds to 265 inside of one calendar year due to &quot;conditioning&quot; is
beyond credulity.

Funny, anal-vents call Big-Head the &quot;greatest player ever,&quot; while
conveniently forgetting that during BALCO's highly unlikely batting-
binge years -- HIS FIELDING DURING THAT TIME WAS ATROCIOUS!

(Two-hundred versus 265 pounds!)

But, some sphincter-fissures are simply unable to analyze and make
connections, aren't they?

Ted Williams must have started the steroids around age 27. He had
several years prior where he had no home runs at all!

(Yes, I know what he was doing.)

He barely edges out Ruth (.342), and Williams had the advantage of
playing half his games in Fenway after it became a hitters park.

He again edges out Ruth, .482 to .474, but Ruth has a large edge in
slugging, .690 to .634. Throw in that Ruth played several seasons in the
dead ball era (albeit mostly as a pitcher), but Williams played at least
partially in the integrated era, and I don't think it clear at all who
was better.

The time he lost to military service enhances your claim. He lost some
of his peak years to WWII, and judging from his seasons surrounding his
Korean service, he lost quite a bit there.

Don't know if it was Letterman or Conan, but last night they told us
that it had been proved that Bonds did steroids - they gave him a
physical and they discovered two asterisks where his balls used to
be.

Fucking hilarious.
