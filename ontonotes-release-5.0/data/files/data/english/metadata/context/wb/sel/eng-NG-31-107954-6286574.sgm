I have a pair of Sidi catapult mountain shoes and the paper thin
insert is worn out. Is there a difference between the Superfeet
insoles and the generic Dr. Scholl's stuff that I can get for five
bucks at my local grocery store?

Thanks,
Javier

Yes, Superfeet are more supportive -- they don't compress as much in
use. If you need arch or other structural support, Superfeet will be
better, assuming the amount of support they provide is right.

But if you were riding the shoes with the generic Sidi insole,
Superfeet may provide too much lift -- get a cheap insole out of a
pair or running shoes or something.  Or maybe something by Dr. Scholls
that looks similar.

Not much that I can see.
Current SiDi liners are a pretty 'Squadra Azzurra' Italian Team Blue -
too bad nobody can see 'em when your feet are in 'em.

I'm sorry -- my comments earlier in this thread were about the insoles
that came with Sidi Genius 5s. Perhaps the newer insoles are more
substantial.

wal has scholls and other insoles. campmor.com  stocks hiking insoles.
the wal scholl's make excellent heel lifts superglued into place, like
two heel cuts glued together, glued in.
two complete scholl's in one shoe are a try.

Campmor also stocks eSole, which are really really good:
http://www.campmor.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?produ...
But the models Campmor carries *may* take a up a little too much space
for some people in cycling shoes.  There are thinner models direct

Almost all problems with insoles taking up too much room in the shoe
can be cured by cutting off the portion under the toes.

Yeah -- at least for narrow and low feet like mine.  Though I don't
love the lift at the back of the shoe either -- my foot still fits in
the shoe, but it's a tiny bit less secure feeling.

so try $4 of wal scholls, glue, and cut one front out if needed? buy
$6 and add 3 heel layers if kneedead
wal scholl's are heat ( as in friction or vegamatic? ) compressive as
are Sole's claim thereof.
that is to say: the soles wear out at compression points or movement
areas.

the heel lifts are manifest across the board. heels wear out quickly
for many and from lower heels many have backache, myriad health
problems, many terminal in minus life energy from the drag.

check your heels.

I got a pair of the eSoles, and they take up too much room inside my
sidis. I could trim them but they are expensive ($40). but this a
still a cheaper alternative to the heat molding lake and shimano
shoes.

Well, I wear a size 13AAA so it works for me., The shoes that I use
this technique in are Sidi Titaniums and Retro mountain bike shoes.
