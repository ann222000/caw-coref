The purpose of newsgroups is to share information.  This purpose would
be lost if all responses were e-mailed, unless they were also posted
to the group.

Whatever newsreader you are using should allow you to "post and e-
mail," "post," or "e-mail to author," or some similar terms.  Do a
little searching in your newsreader Help index, or the information
that came with it.

I use Google (only one available to me on this computer) and I can
"reply to author," or "reply," (meaning post in the group) either one.

Please do not confuse the newbs. Anyone who has been around
the technical, software development, and other intelligent
non-sports groups knows bottom posting is wrong and frowned
upon for the reason of logical flow. Top posting preserves
the logical flow of the thread and message headers within
each message. Simpletons bottom post.

Talk about overkill. So much misinformation in this group. A fake
name can also be copied, impersonated. Unless you like to plaster
your SSN and bank acct numbers all over usenet, identity theft
should not be a problem. And a few good kill filters will keep the
spam in check. Don't let the spammers control your online
experience.

No, it's simpletons using Outlook Express, and who abide by Microsoft's
backwards logic who assume that top posting is correct. Bottom posting has
been the style since Usenet began, and many veteran Usenet users killfile
top posters automatically, since they refuse to accept the standard. Also,
because they rarely have anything constructive to add. Now, do you need an

I've been emailing and reading usenet for over 15 years.  At
first, everyone bottom-posted.  It made natural sense because
we only used paper before that and you could only add to the
bottom of a page.  With email, etc., things have changed.

When you open an email, the reader always places you at the
top of the message.  I always thought having to scroll through
countless replies in a long thread was troublesome.  After I
saw a few top-postings, I thought that worked great.  I could
read the latest message first.  If I needed background info
(for context or whatever), I could scroll down.  I tried top
posting for email, and in a short time everyone emailed at my
company using top posting.

Usenet seems to be a little slower to catch on.  People are
so ingrained in their processes that they cannot (or will not)
change.  Some of the groups I visit are becoming top-posted.
Most not.  It's kind of like yenc.  Huge resistance at first,
but it is becoming more and more prevalent.

In conclusion, I generally follow the group's (or the threads)
standards, but I prefer writing and reading top-posts.  BTW, I
have never used Outhouse Express and only use Windoze when
absolutely forced to.

That's an eccentric rationale that I've never heard before :-)

Top posting works for email, because an email reply generally
is read only by the person who wrote the original message, and
therefor already knows the context.  Usenet is not email, and
you have to assume that many readers of your message may not
have read the preceeding posts.  Thus it's necessary to include
context.

The ideal technique for Usenet posts is neither top nor bottom
posting.  Instead, it's best to intersperse new comments within
the older text at the relevant points.  At the same time, one
should remove any of the older text which is no longer relevant
to the current discussion.

Top/bottom posting is 'style' or preference, not a standard. It
cannot be both style and standard. And, many newsreaders are
designed for top posting, not bottom posting. The curser starts
at the top and, most importantly, the reply headers within the
message stay in order; do not intertwine or overlap each other.

I believe you are correct. Bottom posters have generally been
on Usenet long enough to get brainwashed by the bottom posting
propaganda; 2-4 years. Thankfully, many of those are independent
thinkers who will figure out their first inclination was right,
and return to the common sense of top posting. But sadly, most
will stay with the flawed bottom posting doctrine for the sake
of go-along to get-along.

As you said, Usenet is slow to change but it is surely changing.
Reading further back through time as you go down the page is not
difficult. The method was not broken and did not need fixing.
Bottom posting is a simplistic and poorly thought out idea
that is propagated via the misguided attitude of "Be hip; don't
be a newbie. This is the cool, net savvy, way to do it." (shakes
head)

Here is my preferred method of replying.  First, change the
subject line if the subject changed.  In the body, get to the
point in the first few lines.  If further words are needed,
mention "more comments in-line" and intersperse comments
in a "bottom posting" method.  And then have a conclusion.
More comments in-line.

&gt;&gt; I've been emailing and reading usenet for over 15 years.  At
&gt;&gt; first, everyone bottom-posted.  It made natural sense because
&gt;&gt; we only used paper before that and you could only add to the
&gt;&gt; bottom of a page.

&gt; That's an eccentric rationale that I've never heard before :-)
&gt; (and I've been using email for a good 10 years longer than you).
">

OK, you caught me.  I made it up on the spot. You really started
emailing in 1982?  I only know one person that started earlier
than that.  His account is in a published paper directory of all
email accounts!

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; When you open an email, the reader always places you at the
&gt;&gt; top of the message.  I always thought having to scroll through
&gt;&gt; countless replies in a long thread was troublesome.  After I
&gt;&gt; saw a few top-postings, I thought that worked great.  I could
&gt;&gt; read the latest message first.  If I needed background info
&gt;&gt; (for context or whatever), I could scroll down.  I tried top
&gt;&gt; posting for email, and in a short time everyone emailed at my
&gt;&gt; company using top posting.

&gt; Top posting works for email, because an email reply generally
&gt; is read only by the person who wrote the original message, and
&gt; therefor already knows the context.  Usenet is not email, and
&gt; you have to assume that many readers of your message may not
&gt; have read the preceeding posts.  Thus it's necessary to include
&gt; context.
">

That's not true.  I frequently email several folks and everyone
gets the replies (sometimes).  This also applies to mailing lists,
but they too are usually bottom posters.  And yes, I agree that
the context is important and so should be included.  The context
is not as important as the new material though.  If someone is
reading this then I can assume for the most part that they are
interested in this thread.  Most, if not all, newsgroup readers
thread the articles.

Another trick I use is to stay under 70 columns.  That way, if
there are multiple replies (long thread), the quoted lines don't
get broken up by some unscrupulous newsreader making the lines a
jumbled mess.

I don't have a problem with that, because my newsreader threads
using the references header (which is what it's there for).  However
some newsreaders thread by subject, and folk using that sort of

1980, actually.  We had a system of VAX 11/780s, and DEC supplied
email with them.  Only worked on campus, the computers didn't get
tied into what was becoming the Internet until 1982.

It's generally true that in email everyone who gets a reply has
read the original message, at least.  I'd guess that I add someone
to the distribution on less than 10% of my emails.  So context
is less important for email, versus Usenet.

Yeah, I hate it when some illiterate newsreader starts wrapping

You're talking out yer butt cause you don't do as you say either.
You're not using your real address because you don't want to use
email at all not because you want to avoid spam. And I'm not using a
real address because I just don't want to use email period. You're a
ditz if you use that completely fake address of yours because of
spam alone. The whole idea is to get away with using a "real"
address and still avoid the spam. What you do is put something like
&lt;remove&gt; anywhere in the address. That makes it unusable and most
spam bots are not able to take out the word remove.

OR... you can use your real address "as is" and just make a few
clever spam filters to cut down on the spam. That way you don't have
to put &lt;remove&gt; in your email addresses and you don't have to tell
people it's there and that they need to remove it before sending you
an email. You're free to use your email addresses as they are
supposed to be used. Life is not a pain in the azz because of the
spammers. You refuse to let them dictate your habits other than
making a few spam filters that will continue to work non-stop for
all your email addresses.

I use real email addresses with my identities in other discussion
groups and I rely on spam filters alone and it works great. I like
my way better but you go right on being a ditz if you want. This
proves how ignorant bottom-posters are.

I've made no attempt whatsoever to disguise who I am.  I changed
newsreaders a few months back and configured the new one differently.  I
continued to sign the messages "Julia" for a while, then I got too damn
lazy to use a signature.  The brighter members of the NG had no trouble
following the transition, while you were completely unable to manage it.
Not surprising coming from someone whose current idol is a commercial
gimmick that you insist "really is a real person".

Now, can you explain your own name changes, JG janal??.... nah, I didn't
think so.  It would expose your own hypocrisy.
