No Weld Grinder/Sander Plans (NWGS)

By Tracy Mickley

Midwest Knifemakers Supply, LLC

www.midwestknifemakers.com

These printed plans are for a 2” x 72” belt grinder or sander. The
construction requires no welding, no machining, no lathe work, no
precision thread tapping, no special tools.

These are paper plans and will be mailed to you via US First Class
Mail upon purchase.

Just to be sure, this is not for an actual grinder or any part of
grinder. This listing is for plans that you can use to construct your
own grinder/sander using your materials.

This grinder design uses tool arms to change from a contact wheel to a
flat platen to a small wheel to slack belt attachment in seconds. If
you have a KMG grinder from Beaumont Metals already, you can use the
tools from that grinder in your NWGS.

Features:

No Welding needed!
No Lathe needed!
No Machining or Mill work needed!
15 pages of clear CAD drawings with measurements and materials list on
each drawing.
Master materials list.
Quick change tool arms allow multiple attachments to be changed in
seconds.
Plans include tool arms for: Flat Platen, Tool Table Rest, Slack Belt,
Contact Wheel.
Very low cost materials used in the construction.
Rock solid and vibration free.
Tool Table Rest design allows tool rest to be used with any
attachment.
Flexible design allows different belt lengths to be used besides 2” x
72”.
No precision thread tapping required.
Design is a no weld design but the grinder can easily be welded if you
desire.
Flexible, robust design allows you to make changes to customize your
grinder/sander to your own needs. If you make tapered tangs on your
knives or have wanted to, simply stretch the plans and make a 15” flat
platen with ease.
Can use KMG tool bar arms.
Hundreds of hours of R&amp;D and multiple proto-type testing went into the
design of this very capable grinder/sander.
Web support with additional pictures and ideas for other attachments
via www.midwestkms.com
Suitable for use in grinding metal and sanding wood. In case you are
wondering, when you are working with metal, the machine is called a
grinder, when you are working with wood, the machine is called a
sander.
2”x72” abrasive belts are one of the most common and competitively
priced sizes of belts. Compare prices on this size belt to any other.
If you are using a smaller size grinder/sander. The money you save
using 2” x 72” belts will pay for this machine in no time flat.
2” x 72” belts have more types of belts available for them than any
other size belt. It’s no wonder that knife makers and custom wood
workers have settled on this size of grinder/sander.

The printed assembly manual contains:

15 pages of detailed CAD drawings with measurements and materials
lists on each drawing. You could easily build the entire NWGS from
these CAD drawings.

In addition to the CAD drawings, there is a 28 page construction
manual with:

Clear BW pictures of various parts of the grinder for visual reference
during construction. Nothing tells it better than a picture!

5 pages of assistance in selecting the proper motor for your grinder.
Note: We do not provide wiring diagrams or support for hooking up or
wiring your motors. There are simply too many variations to do that.
If you don’t know how to wire a motor, buy it from a reputable motor
shop and they will show you in about 5 minutes how to wire it up.

3 pages of information on abrasives including a conversion chart for
the different technical standards of abrasives.

2 pages of supply sources – every part has multiple supplier sources
but nearly every single part can be purchased locally.

Tools Required:

A metal band saw is very helpful as is a drill press. If you don’t
have a band saw, you can get the heavier material cut to size for a
nominal charge (usually around $2 to $3 a cut after the first cut)
from the metal supplier. A hand hack saw can handle most of the cuts.
If you don’t have a drill press, you can use a variable speed hand
drill.

A carpenters square. A tape measure, a scribe point, assorted drill
bits (actually just 4 drill bits – 1/8”, 5/16”, 3/8” and ½”), a
3/8”-16 tap and tap wrench. A Unibit™ (step drill bit) works
exceptionally well in this project as a supplement to your regular
drill bits or even in place of them. Cutting/tapping lubricant (oil
will work but cutting lubricant works better). A rotary tool such as a
Dremmel™ tool (or hand file to) cut 2ea 1” x 3/16” key way slots. Hand
wrench or adjustable wrenches to tighten bolts.

You can see the tools required are very modest and simple.

I absolutely understand that.
I am self taught and will weld stuff in mig, tig, oxy/acet until I
drop - just for fun. I also have and use a small mill and lathe. The
problem is most people don't have the equipment or the knowledge to
weld. If some one is far enough along that the posses all those
skills, they probably don't need plans.

You need plans (and manuals).  You don't have to follow them, but
unless you have them, you hive chaos.
With them, you are able to demonstrate flexibility, initiative, and
adaptability.

Plus you can always read the manual afterwards, waiting for the
service tech, so you can tell him exactly what went wrong.  Don't wait
for him to figure it out, you've just read the manual!

While on the subject of do it yourself belt sanders, does anyone have

While I tend to buy older American machines, a belt sander is
something that is worthwhile building for the HSM shop.

Not where I worked.  They tried that a couple times, but the typing
drones kept changing &quot;All those wrong words&quot;. :(  The engineer that
designed the piece of equipment HAD to write his own manuals.  A lot of
the work writing the manuals can be copied and pasted from the
manufacturing and test documentation.  Preliminary manuals were written
while the first prototypes were being built, and fine tuned during the
first production run.

&gt; &gt; No Weld Grinder/Sander Plans (NWGS)

&gt; &gt; By Tracy Mickley

&gt; &gt;    Midwest Knifemakers Supply, LLC

&gt; &gt; www.midwestknifemakers.com

&gt; &gt; These printed plans are for a 2” x 72” belt grinder or sander. The
&gt; &gt; construction requires no welding, no machining, no lathe work, no
&gt; &gt; precision thread tapping, no special tools.

&gt; &gt; These are paper plans and will be mailed to you via US First Class
&gt; &gt; Mail upon purchase.

&gt; &gt; Just to be sure, this is not for an actual grinder or any part of
&gt; &gt; grinder. This listing is for plans that you can use to construct your
&gt; &gt; own grinder/sander using your materials.

&gt; &gt; This grinder design uses tool arms to change from a contact wheel to a
&gt; &gt; flat platen to a small wheel to slack belt attachment in seconds. If
&gt; &gt; you have a KMG grinder from Beaumont Metals already, you can use the
&gt; &gt; tools from that grinder in your NWGS.

&gt; &gt; Features:

&gt; &gt; No Welding needed!
&gt; &gt; No Lathe needed!
&gt; &gt; No Machining or Mill work needed!
&gt; &gt; 15 pages of clear CAD drawings with measurements and materials list on
&gt; &gt; each drawing.
&gt; &gt; Master materials list.
&gt; &gt; Quick change tool arms allow multiple attachments to be changed in
&gt; &gt; seconds.
&gt; &gt; Plans include tool arms for: Flat Platen, Tool Table Rest, Slack Belt,
&gt; &gt; Contact Wheel.
&gt; &gt; Very low cost materials used in the construction.
&gt; &gt; Rock solid and vibration free.
&gt; &gt; Tool Table Rest design allows tool rest to be used with any
&gt; &gt; attachment.
&gt; &gt; Flexible design allows different belt lengths to be used besides 2” x
&gt; &gt; 72”.
&gt; &gt; No precision thread tapping required.
&gt; &gt; Design is a no weld design but the grinder can easily be welded if you
&gt; &gt; desire.
&gt; &gt; Flexible, robust design allows you to make changes to customize your
&gt; &gt; grinder/sander to your own needs. If you make tapered tangs on your
&gt; &gt; knives or have wanted to, simply stretch the plans and make a 15” flat
&gt; &gt; platen with ease.
&gt; &gt; Can use KMG tool bar arms.
&gt; &gt; Hundreds of hours of R&amp;D and multiple proto-type testing went into the
&gt; &gt; design of this very capable grinder/sander.
&gt; &gt; Web support with additional pictures and ideas for other attachments
&gt; &gt; via www.midwestkms.com
&gt; &gt; Suitable for use in grinding metal and sanding wood. In case you are
&gt; &gt; wondering, when you are working with metal, the machine is called a
&gt; &gt; grinder, when you are working with wood, the machine is called a
&gt; &gt; sander.
&gt; &gt; 2”x72” abrasive belts are one of the most common and competitively
&gt; &gt; priced sizes of belts. Compare prices on this size belt to any other.
&gt; &gt; If you are using a smaller size grinder/sander. The money you save
&gt; &gt; using 2” x 72” belts will pay for this machine in no time flat.
&gt; &gt; 2” x 72” belts have more types of belts available for them than any
&gt; &gt; other size belt. It’s no wonder that knife makers and custom wood
&gt; &gt; workers have settled on this size of grinder/sander.

&gt; &gt; The printed assembly manual contains:

&gt; &gt; 15 pages of detailed CAD drawings with measurements and materials
&gt; &gt; lists on each drawing. You could easily build the entire NWGS from
&gt; &gt; these CAD drawings.

&gt; &gt; In addition to the CAD drawings, there is a 28 page construction
&gt; &gt; manual with:

&gt; &gt; Clear BW pictures of various parts of the grinder for visual reference
&gt; &gt; during construction. Nothing tells it better than a picture!

&gt; &gt; 5 pages of assistance in selecting the proper motor for your grinder.
&gt; &gt; Note: We do not provide wiring diagrams or support for hooking up or
&gt; &gt; wiring your motors. There are simply too many variations to do that.
&gt; &gt; If you don’t know how to wire a motor, buy it from a reputable motor
&gt; &gt; shop and they will show you in about 5 minutes how to wire it up.

&gt; &gt; 3 pages of information on abrasives including a conversion chart for
&gt; &gt; the different technical standards of abrasives.

&gt; &gt; 2 pages of supply sources – every part has multiple supplier sources
&gt; &gt; but nearly every single part can be purchased locally.

&gt; &gt; Tools Required:

&gt; &gt;  A metal band saw is very helpful as is a drill press. If you don’t
&gt; &gt; have a band saw, you can get the heavier material cut to size for a
&gt; &gt; nominal charge (usually around $2 to $3 a cut after the first cut)
&gt; &gt; from the metal supplier. A hand hack saw can handle most of the cuts.
&gt; &gt; If you don’t have a drill press, you can use a variable speed hand
&gt; &gt; drill.

&gt; &gt;  A carpenters square. A tape measure, a scribe point, assorted drill
&gt; &gt; bits (actually just 4 drill bits – 1/8”, 5/16”, 3/8” and ½”), a
&gt; &gt; 3/8”-16 tap and tap wrench. A Unibit™ (step drill bit) works
&gt; &gt; exceptionally well in this project as a supplement to your regular
&gt; &gt; drill bits or even in place of them. Cutting/tapping lubricant (oil
&gt; &gt; will work but cutting lubricant works better). A rotary tool such as a
&gt; &gt; Dremmel™ tool (or hand file to) cut 2ea 1” x 3/16” key way slots. Hand
&gt; &gt; wrench or adjustable wrenches to tighten bolts.

&gt; &gt;  You can see the tools required are very modest and simple.

&gt; &gt; the plans are available at: www.midwestknifemakers.com

&gt; While on the subject of do it yourself belt sanders, does anyone have
&gt; a favorite version?

&gt; While I tend to buy older American machines, a belt sander is
&gt; something that is worthwhile building for the HSM shop.

So no one has BUILT a belt sander?

Hard to believe...I thought this was rec.crafts.metalworking.
