Christmas Shopping
By: Azrael

I check my mail on Wednesday to find the usual assortment of junk mail
and flyers. God I hate the post office. I'm about to indiscreetly dump
it into the package pick-up boxes, as usual, when something catches my
eye - a flyer from Wal-Mart. On the front page is an advertisement for
a DVD player - $50. Not too bad I think. My mother has been wanting
one, and I think that would be a great Christmas present, especially
the $50 part. I love you Mom, but I'm poor as hell. You know that. So
I decide to get this for her. It won't be available until the after
Thanksgiving Holiday Sale, Friday morning at 6AM. No problem I think,
I just won't sleep Thursday night, sneak out of the parents house
Friday morning, buy the player, come back, slip back into bed, easy
enough. Right? Ha! Obviously, you can tell I've never done this
before.

The following events occur between 5AM and 6:30AM on the day after
Thanksgiving. All events occur in real time.

5:00

I roll out of bed, half awake and ready to get this over with. I sneak
downstairs, put on clothes, grab my coat and keys, and slip out of the
house without ever making a sound or waking anyone up. All the while
I'm thinking how damned slick I am, like James Fucking Bond. I get out
to my car at 5:20. My plan was to leave at 5:30, but it is freezing
out here. I need to start the car for heat, but I don't want to have
the engine running in the neighborhood, so I decide to leave ahead of
schedule. No big deal. I'll wait it out in the parking lot, and listen
to my CD's. Still, no worries.

5:30

I arrive at Wal-Mart to find a somewhat full parking lot. Odd. As I
get closer, I see something in the headlights. Asses. Legs. Jeans.
People. People in line. Yes, people standing in line to get inside of
the store at 5:30 in the goddamned morning. Holy shit. I park the car
(yes, there actually is parking at this point) and after considering
staying in the car for a minute or two, I decide to go ahead and get
in line.

At this point, the line is about 15 cars deep into the parking lot
away from the store. And oh, have I mentioned yet that it's freezing
cold? Thank God I had the foresight to wear my heaviest jacket, but it
is still fucking cold. My teeth are shivering. My knees are shivering.
My hands are shivering. Even my fucking liver is shivering at this
point. There's a lady about two people in front of me holding a
steaming cup of coffee, and I seriously considered knocking her out
and pouring the coffee over my head. The guy in front of me asks if I
know the time. I check my watch - 5:35.

Fuck.

5:35

The line is constantly getting bigger behind me. I watch as people are
steadily arriving, and making the exodus to the back of the line. And
it dawns on me - this is the most active I have ever seen the world at
5:35 in the morning. I mean, morning person or not, people don't tend
to like to move this early. There are no birds chirping, because even
they are fucking asleep. All to save a few bucks, huh? I can't think
of anything else that could motivate this many people this early in
the morning. Try it next time you see your friends, see what
happens...

You: Hey guys, why don't we get breakfast tomorrow morning? Bright and
early at 5:30! My treat!
Friends: .................(in unison) Fuck you.

There are two Hispanic ladies behind me, and one of their cell phones
rings. And I found this interesting, because who the hell else is
awake at 5:30 in the morning, and much less calling people at 5:30 in
the morning. And then I realized how far-reaching this atrocity must
be. Other stores, not just Wal-Mart, across the state. Across the
country. Truly insane motherfuckers, like me and the rest of the
condemned in this line, trying to capitalize on a sale. It was a truly
frightening revelation.

I also start to worry about my DVD player. I mean, I'm about halfway
up the line here. How many do they have? What if all the people in
front of me are here for it? The ladies behind me are talking - they
came for the TV's and DVD players. What if they sell out before I ever
get to them? The thought of me freezing my balls of at 5:30 in the
morning to not even get the DVD player does not make me happy. I'm
thinking Wal-Mart needs to do something to appease us, like free hot
chocolate for the first 100 people in line, at least guaranteed goods.
Because if we get inside and don't find what we're looking for, it
will not be pretty.

The line moves up a few feet. Nothing has happened at the door, it
just moved up. I can't explain why.

5:45

The line moves up another few feet. I think I realize why. Clearly,
people are dying of hypothermia up there. As they do, their friends
are carefully shoving them out of the line, and we're picking up the
slack back here. Some kind of shopper natural selection I suppose.
Only the strongest survive.

One of the Hispanic ladies behind me, as she's moving up in the line,
almost goes past me. She stops, says &quot;whoops&quot;, smiles, and goes back
behind me. Good thing too, because I was this close to snapping her
back.

At this point, I started to really hate the employees inside. Here we
were slowly turning into chunks of ice holding salespapers, and they
were inside their little heated building, probably watching us and
laughing. Fuckers. I remember that Wal-Mart usually hires old people
to serve as greeters - stand in the doorway and smile and welcome
people to the store. I imagine there's going to be some old,
grandfatherly guy, standing there, cheerfully greeting the mob come
6AM. And if he looks me square in the face, smiles his smile and says
&quot;Thank you for shopping Wal-Mart&quot;, I am going to summarily punch that
fucker in the nose.

My anger management classes start bright and early Monday morning.

I reach up to rub my nose, when I realize I can't even feel my nose. I
can't feel my ears either. And my sinuses are solid now. Mom, I hope
you appreciate this. Next time you try to play that whole &quot;I carried
you with me for 9 months&quot; crap, I'm going to bring up the time I got
frostbite standing in a line outside Wal-Mart to get you a DVD player
for Christmas. If I get the player at all. Fuck.

And then I start thinking - I got here at 5:30, and was this far back
in the line. When, exactly, did the people who are standing at the
door ger here? I tried to think of an earlier time in the morning, but
hell, it doesn't get much earlier than 5:30. I can only conclude that
they were here last night. I can imagine them setting up their dinner
table outside the Wal-Mart doors, carving the turkey and everything.
And they're all smiling, knowing they get first crack at those $50 DVD
players. God we're all pathetic. To make it worse, at this exact
moment, one of the ladies behind me asks &quot;If we're here now, I wonder
how early those people at the front lined up?&quot;

5:50

It's getting ugly now. Several late arrivals, not even bothering with
the line, have camped out at the entrance of the store. I guess they
figure when the doors open, they can bum rush their way in. Wal-Mart's
defense? One guy in a suit. I shit you not, one guy in a dress shirt
and dockers. Forget what I said before, this guy had better be James
Fucking Bond if he expects to survive this morning. Those in line are
getting anxious. &quot;Get in line!&quot; they angrily scream to the campers,
who aren't budging. You can feel the hint of violence in the air. And
it's going to get worse. Those front-of-store campers are going to
snap back Guy in Suit, and the people at the doors, who have clearly
been in line since Veterans Day, aren't going to have any of that, and
we will have a full-scale riot on our hands. I am going to die in a
Wal-Mart riot. Of all the ways I figured I was going to go, this sure
as hell isn't one of them. All for a $50 DVD player. I must be out of
my goddamned head.

The line moves up another few feet. I suppose the next round of
victims have been claimed from hypothermia. You will not be missed.
Natural selection.

Y'know what? This is humanity at its worst. Right here, at Wal-Mart.
You have to be here to truly appreciate the ugliness of it all. I can
imagine all the great humanitarians/peace makers spinning in their
graves right now. This might be too old school for many of you, but do
you remember this commercial in the late 70's/early 80's about
pollution? There was this Indian standing on the side of the freeway,
looking over the polluted landscape. A car drives by, and they toss
some litter, which lands at his feet. Camera pans up to catch a
teardrop falling from the Indian's eye. Right now, I could picture
Mahatma Ghandi, standing somewhere in the parking lot, surveying this
scene, with the fucking teardrop rolling down his cheek.

6:00

Allright, it's go time. The doors open, and people begin to pile in. I
half expect everyone to drop the line and just rush the door down. The
front-of-store campers try their bum rush. As we're moving, the people
in the line see this and begin to get upset. I begin praying for my
life, and planning my potential escape routes for the anticipated
riot. Somehow though, Guy in Suit keeps them all back, which leads me
to believe that he is actually Superman. We continue to make our way
to the store, and as we pass the people being held back, many taunt
them. So naturally, I'm still fearing for my life. Little do I know
the worst is yet to come.

Finally, I enter the store. There is no greeter, and good thing too
because he would have been rushed down. BAD. It's an absolute frenzy,
as people are rushing, grabbing carts. And everyone is heading towards
that mecca, that one place where all eyes are directed, where all
desires are fulfilled - electronics. Fuck.

I'm trying to walk normally. This is a mob scene, and I don't want to
feed into it. It's fine at first, but as I get closer to electronics,
it's even more of a traffic jam. A sea of humanity. And every time I
slow down, even slightly, I get rammed in the ass by a shopping cart.
Five times in ...

Its not hard to find DVD players for &lt; $50 these days. Hell, the
supermarket where I shop sometimes sells an off brand DVD player for
$30, and no one has to wake up insanely early to buy one. I have also
seen CompUSA and Circuit City also sell DVD players for $50 or less,
including yesterday where Circuit City had a DVD player on sale for
$39.99.

&gt; So yeah, I woke up early, braved the cold, and perhaps the worst face
&gt; humanity has to do something nice for my mother. Hope she appreciates
&gt; it. But unless you were there, there among the masses, in the middle
&gt; of the chaos, you don't understand what a spectacle this was. I was
&gt; nowhere near the LA Riots, but I imagine it looked a lot like this,
&gt; except replace the terrified Wal-Mart employees with terrified
&gt; policemen and shop owners. And do you want to know what the scariest
&gt; part is? If you've read any of the other editorials on this site, you
&gt; know I have a habit of comic exaggeration, making things seem bigger
&gt; than they actually are for effect. But the scariest part of all
&gt; this...? I didn't exaggerate any of that.

"/> I don't get what your point is. It is well known that humans
behave in a herd-like mentality. If that surprises you, then
you must not get out much.

BTW, I was a DVD player at Wal-Mart for $54 last summer. I recall
hearing that they had one on-line for $39. You can get deals like
that all the time. So, at best, you did all that to save $4.
What does that say about you? For me, I'd rather get a good
night's sleep than wake up at 5AM for $4.

It is one of the risks of being a human. Pointing out obvious
typos and spelling errors is the risk of being a jerk.

"/> As with everything that Ablang posts, it was not original, and
it was not current. Walmart opened at 5am on BF this year (not 6
as mentioned in the post), and $50 is not at all a good deal for
a DVD player. In fact, it wasn't a good deal last BF (2004),
either, there were plenty of $20-30 deals. And I just checked a
couple of the BF deal sites, and WM sold DVD players for under
$30 each of the past two years. I wonder what year this thing
was actually written???
