1. &quot;Weather at our destination is 50 degrees with some broken
clouds, but we'll try to have them fixed before we arrive. Thank you,
and
remember, nobody loves you, or your money, more than Southwest
Airlines.&quot;

2. &quot;Your seat cushions can be used for flotation, and, in the
event of an emergency water landing, please paddle to shore and take
them with you with our compliments.&quot;

3. &quot;As you exit the plane, make sure to gather all of your
belongings. Anything left behind will be distributed evenly among
the flight attendants. Please do not leave children or spouses.&quot;

4. And from the pilot during his welcome message: &quot;Delta airlines
is pleased to have some of the best flight attendants in the
industry. Unfortunately, none of them are on this flight!&quot;

5. Overheard on an American Airlines flight into Amarillo, Texas, on a
particularly
windy and bumpy day: During the final approach, the Captain was really
having to
fight it. After an extremely hard landing, the Flight Attendant said,
&quot;Ladies and Gentlemen, welcome to Amarillo. Please remain in your seats
with your seat belts fastened
while the Captain taxis what's left of our airplane to the gate

Here are some people who should not be allowed to venture into
society:

Police in Wichita, Kansas, arrested a 22-year-old man at an
airport hotel after he tried to pass two (counterfeit) $16
bills.

A man in Johannesberg, South Africa, shot his 49-year-old
friend in the face, seriously wounding him, while the two
practiced beer cans off each other's head.

A company trying to continue its five-year perfect safety
record showed its workers a film aimed at encouraging the use
of safety goggles on the job. According to Industrial Machinery
News, the film's depiction of gory industrial s was so
graphic that twenty-five workers suffered minor injuries in
their rush to leave the screening room. Thirteen others
fainted, and one man required seven stitches after he cut his
head falling off a chair while watching the film.

The Chico, California, City Council enacted a ban on nuclear
weapons, setting a $500 fine for anyone detonating one within
city limits.

A bus carrying five passengers was hit by a car in St. Louis,
but by the time police arrived on the scene, fourteen
pedestrians had boarded the bus and had begun to complain of
whiplash injuries and back pain.

Swedish business consultant Ulf af Trolle labored 13 years on a
book about Swedish economic solutions. He took the 250-page
manuscript to be copied, only to have it reduced to 50,000
strips of paper in seconds when a worker confused the copier
with the shredder.

A convict broke out of jail in Washington D.C., then a few days
later accompanied his friend to her trial for robbery. At
lunch, he went out for a sandwich. She needed to see him, and
thus had him paged over the courthouse intercom. Police
officers recognized his name and arrested him as he returned to
the courthouse in a car he had stolen over the lunch hour.

Police in Radnor, Pennsylvania, interrogated a suspect by
placing a metal colander on his head and connecting it with
wires to a photocopy machine. The message &quot;He's lying&quot; was
placed in the copier, and police pressed the copy button each
time they thought the suspect wasn't telling the truth.

Believing the &quot;lie detector&quot; was working, the suspect
confessed.

When two service station attendants in Ionia, Michigan, refused
to hand over the cash to an intoxicated robber, the man
threatened to call the police. They still refused, so the
robber called the police and was arrested.

A Los Angeles man who later said he was &quot;tired of walking,&quot;
stole a steamroller and led police on a 5 mph chase until an
officer stepped aboard and brought the vehicle to a stop.

If men ruled the world:

Any fake phone number a gave you would automatically
forward your call to her real number.

Nodding and looking at your watch would be deemed an acceptable
response to &quot;I love you.&quot;

Hallmark would make &quot;Sorry, what was your name again?&quot; cards.

When your friend really needed to talk to you during the
game, she'd appear in a little box in the corner of the screen
during a time-out.

Breaking up would be a lot easier. A smack to the ass and a
&quot;Nice hustle, you'll get 'em next time&quot; would pretty much do
it.

Birth control would come in ale or lager.

You'd be expected to fill your resume with gag names of people
you'd worked for, like &quot;Heywood J'Blowme.&quot;

Each year, your raise would be pegged to the fortunes of the
NFL team of your choice.

The funniest guy in the office would get to be CEO.

&quot;Sorry I'm late, but I got really wasted last night&quot; would be
an acceptable excuse for tardiness.

At the end of the workday, a whistle would blow and you'd jump
out your window and slide down the tail of a brontosaurus and
right into your car like Fred Flintstone.

It'd be considered harmless fun to gather 30 friends, put on
horned helmets, and go pillage a nearby town.

Lifeguards could remove citizens from beaches for violating the
&quot;public ugliness&quot; ordinance.

Tanks would be far easier to rent.

Garbage would take itself out.

Instead of beer belly, you'd get &quot;beer biceps.&quot;

Instead of an expensive engagement ring, you could present your
wife-to-be with a giant foam hand that said, &quot;You're #1!&quot;

Valentine's Day would be moved to February 29th so it would
only occur in leap years.

On Groundhog Day, if you saw your shadow, you'd get the day off
to go drinking. Mother's Day, too.

St. Patrick's Day, however, would remain exactly the same. But
it would be celebrated every month.

COPS would be broadcast live, and you could phone in advice to
the pursuing cops. Or to the crooks.

Two words: Ally McNaked.

Regis and Kathie Lee would be chained to a cement mixer and
pushed off the Golden Gate Bridge for the most lucrative
pay-per-view event in world history.

The victors in any athletic competition would get to kill and
eat the losers.

The only show opposite Monday Night Football would be Monday
Night Football from a Different Camera Angle.

It would be perfectly legal to steal a sports car, as long as
you returned it the following day with a full tank of gas.

Every man would get four real Get Out of Jail Free cards per
year.

When a cop gave you a ticket, every smart-aleck answer you
responded with would actually reduce your fine. As in: Cop:
&quot;You know how fast you were going?&quot; You: &quot;All I know is, I was
spilling my beer all over the place.&quot; Cop: &quot;Nice one. That's
$10 off.&quot;

Faucets would run &quot;Hot,&quot;&quot;Cold,&quot; and &quot;100 proof.&quot;

The Statue of Liberty would get a bright red, 40-foot thong.

Daisy Duke shorts would never again go out of style.

Telephones would automatically cut off after 30 seconds of
conversation.

You know it is time to reassess your relationship with
your computer when....

1. You wake up at 4 O'clock in the morning to go to the bathroom and
stop to check your email on the way back to bed.

2. You turn off your computer and get an awful empty feeling, as if
you just pulled the plug on a loved one.

3. You decide to stay in college for an additional year or two, just
for the free internet access.

4. You laugh at people with 28.8 modems.

5. You start using smileys :-) in your snail mail.

6. You find yourself typing &quot;com&quot; after every period when using a word
processor.com

7. You can't correspond with your mother because she doesn't have a
computer.

8. When your email box shows &quot;no new messages&quot; and you feel really
depressed.

9. You don't know the gender of your three closest friends because they

have nondescript screen name and you never bothered to ask.

10. You move into a new house and you decide to &quot;Netscape&quot; before you
landscape.

11. Your family always knows where you are.

12. In real life conversations, you don't laugh, you just say &quot;LOL,
LOL&quot;.

13. After reading this message, you immediately forward it to a friend!

A new soldier was on sentry duty at the main gate. His orders
were clear: No car was to enter unless it had a special sticker
on the windshield. A big Army car came up with a general seated
in the back. The sentry said, &quot;Halt, who goes there?&quot;

The chauffeur, a corporal, says, &quot;General Wheeler.&quot;

&quot;I'm sorry, I can't let you through. You've got to have a
sticker on the windshield.&quot;

The general said, &quot;Drive on!&quot;

The sentry said, &quot;Hold it! You really can't come through. I
have orders to shoot if you try driving in without a sticker.&quot;

The general repeated, &quot;I'm telling you, son, drive on!&quot;

The sentry walked up to the rear window and said, &quot;General, I'm
new at this. Do I shoot you or the driver?&quot;
-----------------------------------------------

The Bells of Notre Dame...

After the tragic of Quasimodo, the bishop of Notre Dame found
himself in need of a new bell ringer. Since few of the townspeople
could actually read, he sent the town crier out to call for applicants.

Five people showed up to try for the job. One by one, the bishop took
them up into the bell tower to let them show their skill. But alas, the
first four created such a cacophony that the bishop despaired of ever
finding a suitable replacement.

As the fifth applicant approached, the bishop did a double-take. There
before him stood a man with no arms! What could be going on here?

The bishop addressed the man. &quot;Sir,&quot; he said. &quot;I assume you're here for
the audition.&quot;

&quot;That's right,&quot; the man replied. &quot;My father taught me the joy of the
carillon when I was young, and I've been longing to try my hand at
it... so to speak.&quot;

&quot;Ah,&quot; said the bishop. &quot;That brings me to my main question. Without
arms or hands, how do you expect to perform this job?&quot;

&quot;I know it sounds odd,&quot; said the man, &quot;but I beg you to let me show you
what I can do.&quot;

The bishop reluctantly agreed, and the two climbed the tall tower
together. No sooner had they reached the top than the man began
flinging himself at the huge bells, striking them with his forehead!
And oh, what a glorious sound it made. The bishop ventured to guess
that such wonderful music had never come from the cathedral's tower.
But just as he was about to offer the man a job, the man slipped and
fell out the window, plummeting to the cobblestone streets below.

The bishop rushed down the stairs and ran to the man's crumpled body,
where a crowd was beginning to gather.

&quot;Excellency,&quot; said one of the townspeople, &quot;we were coming to hear the
music, but when we arrived, we saw this man falling from the tower.
Pray tell, who is he?&quot;

The bishop stared down at the armless figure for a moment before
replying, &quot;I don't know his name... but his face rings a bell.&quot;

(time passes)

The next morning, the bishop was still in a quandary over the bell
situation at the cathedral. Suddenly, he heard a loud thumping at his
door. When he went to open it, there stood the no-armed man from the
day before!

&quot;What???&quot; stammered the bishop. &quot;How can this be? I saw you fall to
your yesterday!&quot;

&quot;Actually, you saw my twin brother,&quot; said the man. &quot;I was hoping you
would allow me to honor his memory by auditioning for the job he
sought.&quot;

&quot;To be perfectly honest,&quot; said the bishop, &quot;I do need someone to fill
the position. You're welcome to give it a try, but you must promise to
be careful.&quot;

The man agreed, and the two climbed the tall tower together. When they
arrived at the top, the man gleefully began flinging himself head-first
into the bells. The bishop was amazed... if anything, the music was
even better than the day before!

As the man finished, the bishop smiled and told him the job was his if
he wanted it. The armless man was thrilled at the news, and he began
running around the tower in his excitement. But alas, he stepped too
close to the window and plummeted to his in the street below.

Once again, the bishop rushed down the stairs and ran out to the man's
body, where another crowd was gathering.

&quot;Your holiness,&quot; one of the townspeople said, &quot;we heard the music and
came to listen, but when we arrived, we found this man on the
street. Who is he?&quot;

The bishop looked down at the body for a moment before replying, &quot;I'm
not sure... but he's a ringer for his brother.&quot;
