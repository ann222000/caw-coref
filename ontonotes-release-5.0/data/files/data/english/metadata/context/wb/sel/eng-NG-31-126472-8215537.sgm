I've been shopping like a fiend for inexpensive online glasses. I'm a
progressive wearer and am concerned about the quality of the
progressive lenses carried by Zenni and other listed on GlassyEyes
website.

Given the fact that I have a fairly large head (my pd is 67 mm) I'm
pretty sure I need a &quot;wider corridor&quot; progressive lens to avoid some
of the problems detailed here:

Albert@Optical4Less suggested the Physio360 or Precision progressives.
So far I've only been able to find these optional lenses at Optical 4
Less (Precision) or Global Eye Glasses (Physio360).

However, opting for these lenses significantly adds to the cost of the
eyeglasses. Suddenly a normal progressive set of glasses at Zenni for
$65.80 becomes $272 at Optical4Less and $329 at Global Eye Glasses.
I'm almost tempted to try Zenni for $65 and if it doesn't work out
either return them and recoup $32.50, then spring for the more
expensive ones at Optical4Less. Any thoughts on this strategy would be
welcome.

I'm looking for comments from people that have bought the standard
progressive lens from Zenni, 39DollarGlasses or Global Eye Glasses.
What do you think of the quality of the vision they give you? Do you
notice anything you'd like to improve upon?

P.S. I did call Zenni with some questions yesterday. I was on hold for
14 minutes and received play-by-play updates as I waited, i.e. &quot;You
are caller number 9. Your estimated wait time is 11 minutes. You are
caller number 8. Your estimated wait time is 9 minutes.&quot; When I
finally spoke to a sales rep I sensed that they were under tremendous
pressure to answer questions quickly and succinctly. I got the
impression that they are deluged with calls and orders. The person did
answer my questions quickly and satisfactorily.
