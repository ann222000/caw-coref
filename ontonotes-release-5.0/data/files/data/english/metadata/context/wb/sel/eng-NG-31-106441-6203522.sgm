Apoptosome refers to the adaptor protein complex that mediates the
activation of an initiator caspase at the onset of apoptosis. In
mammalian cells, caspase-9, caspase-8, and caspase-2 rely on the
apoptotic protease-activating factor 1 (Apaf-1)-apoptosome,
death-inducing signaling complex (DISC), and PIDDosome, respectively,
for activation. In Drosophila, activation of the caspase-9 homolog
Dronc requires assembly of an apoptosome comprised of
Dark/Hac-1/Dapaf-1. In Caenorhabditis elegans, activation of the
caspase CED-3 is facilitated by the CED-4-apoptosome. Recent
biochemical and structural investigation revealed significant insights
into the assembly and function of the various apoptosomes. Nonetheless,
conclusive mechanisms by which the initiator caspases are activated by
the apoptosomes remain elusive. Several models have been proposed to
explain the activation process. The induced proximity model summarizes
the general process of initiator caspase activation. The
proximity-driven dimerization model describes how initiator caspases
respond to induced proximity and offers an explanation for their
activation. Regardless of how initiator caspases are activated,
enhanced activity must be correlated with altered active site
conformation. The induced conformation model posits that the activated
conformation for the active site of a given initiator caspase is
attained through direct interaction with the apoptosome or through
homo-oligomerization facilitated by the apoptosome.
