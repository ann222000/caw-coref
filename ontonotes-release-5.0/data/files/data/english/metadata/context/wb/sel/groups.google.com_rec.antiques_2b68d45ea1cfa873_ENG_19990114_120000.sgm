something that his newsgroup reader is putting in as blank
spaces.

Doug - do you have a way of post in HTML (or not?)

I have no idea where the AO,AO is coming from. I'm not putting in any
html or ascii or anything else new. When I go to r.a and click on my
post that you included with your e-mail I don't 'see' any AOs in my
post... It looks just as perfect as it did when I proofread it before
hitting send. If I knew what was causing this I would stop it at once.
Sorry........ IMO

Thank goodness, there is someone else who doesn't see them until someone
copies them. I never see the original AO's in Doug's posts or the HTML that
appears in some other's posts through Outlook Express, but they do show up
in DejaNews.

"/> Well, I guess I didn't explain what I was trying to explain very
well...or something like that -

My newsreader (Agent) doesn't have any problems with your messages - I
was just quoting Kris. I've seen this sort of problem before, and it's
the character set your news program is using - I assume that there
must be a setting somewhere(options?), since the =A0 wasn't complained
about until your program switched to the ISO character set -
Sorry for waxing technical on you, Doug...I've never actually used a
Webber, so it's hard for me to guess exactly where the setting has
changed -
You are forgiven...IMO

"/> Dear AOL'er...

PLEASE learn what you should have in FIRST GRADE. Capitalize the first
letter in a sentence. Days of the week are also capiltalized. &quot;Poket&quot; is
spelled with a &quot;c&quot; in the middle. If you don't know where, look it up!
Full sentences have a subject, a verb, and an object. If you don't
believe me, please read the other posts here. You will see that these
are the most incredibly annoying habits of those people with &quot;@aol.com&quot;
at the ends of their addresses, almost exclusively. Egads! If you want
to appear as a literate human being and English is not your second
language, use it properly. This is not &quot;AOL chat.&quot; Don't make an ass of
yourself. AND, if you want an answer, you're going to have to come here
to get it. Don't expect us to do the extra work of delivering it to your
personal mailbox. We discuss things. We don't respond &quot;personally&quot; to
Walmart-style bulletin board postings as a favor to you or anyone else.

That out of my system... I will comment on your mirror. How do you know
the specific date of the mirror? I would guess something closer to 1907
or 1908. There was a big hit song in 1908 called &quot;I'm Afraid to Come
Home In the Dark.&quot; It tells a great, comic story about a gal, Mabel, who
marries &quot;Jonesy,&quot; who is quite the drinker. When he stays out all night
long, he gives her the excuse, &quot;I'm afraid to come home in the dark,&quot;
citing late-night park robberies in the paper. Well, I'll let the third
verse tell you the rest:

She kissed him good morning, to see him she was glad;
But when she tucked him up in bed, said Jones, &quot;I guess I'm bad,&quot;
But next night same old story, he came home just at dawn,
But he got sober right away when he found she was gone!
At noon he heard her slam the garden gate...
Said she to Jonesy (in drunken manner), &quot;Is my hat on straight?&quot;

Then she proceeds to sing the chorus, wobbling and drunken:

Baby Dear, Listen here! I'm Afraid to Come Home in the Dark... (etc.)

Altogether forgotten today, this song was an enourmous hit. Even the
famous writer, &quot;O. Henry,&quot; said on his deathbed, &quot;I'm Afraid to Go Home
In the Dark.&quot;

I would suspect your mirror manufacturer was also cashing in on the
famous song lyric. However, if you have information about the existence
of this phrase before Harry Williams penned it in 1907, I would love to
hear about it - on this newsgroup, not just in my mailbox. Trust me.
I'll find it.

And take my advice - dump AOL, get a real ISP, and get rid of those
incessant popup messages about &quot;buddy lists.&quot; Yecch.

RAGards,

Tracy
