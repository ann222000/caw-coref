I don't understand most of it; heart surgeons speak some language other
than English.  I shall have to interpret it line-by-line and that will
take some time since I don't have a cardiologist to act as an
interpreter handy.

The bits I did understand in the description of the surgeries squicked
me a bit; I am lucky to have little memory of how cut up I was and all
the tubes.  Such a graphic description is pretty weird, especially when
she discusses moving my heart around.  She moved it, then did some
stuff, then put it back.  EEEK!!!  Probably the most intimate I've ever
been with another human being, except for being unconscious at the time.
Reading that probably raised my bp.

While there's lots I don't understand yet, I did understand a few things
right off the bat.

The admitting physician described me as a &quot;pleasant 45 year old woman.&quot;
I had spent the previous night screaming and vomiting instead of
sleeping, I was in pain and on morphine, so... not exactly at my best.
I wouldn't have been offended had he said I was a bitch under those
circumstances, so I'm kinda proud that something &quot;pleasant&quot; showed
through all that.

My A1c on admission was 11.7.  This is the result of being afraid to go
on insulin for a year, folks.  I was an idiot.  A couple months ago, I
tested at 6.2, which is the result of both going on insulin and learning
as much as I possibly could about dosing for tight control.  So I have
been cured of this particular idiocy, but it would've been nice had I
not needed a heart attack for the wake-up call.  My internist was
thrilled with my A1c whereas I thought it was so-so, but now I know why
as that's one hell of an improvement in 2 months.  I bet I make the 55
club at my labs in November.

I was admitted and had the angioplasty on May 28th, had the bypass on
June 1st, and was discharged on June 4th.  I &quot;remembered&quot; a longer
hospitalization than that, turns out they got me in-and-out pretty quickly.

My bg was checked with my daily blood work, which was usually drawn
between breakfast and lunch each day.  They also tested me daily several
times with a regular bg meter, but I have doctor's reports and lab work
here, not my entire charts, so I don't have all those readings, just the
numbers from the labs:

5/29 - 271
5/29 - 292
5/30 - 209
5/31 - 256
6/1 - 147
6/2 - 121
6/4 - 122

These are numbers with STRICT low-carbing.  I've rarely been so strict
as I was freaking terrified and knew I didn't need to eat most of the
crap they put on my tray.  Still, they were better numbers than I'd had
for the year prior, when I'd never seen a reading under 300.  I was
started on insulin right off the bat.

You're wondering what happened on 6/1.  I'm not sure how they were
dosing my insulin prior to that, but I recall a discussion with one of
the internists on the 30th and he said they had been unable to get my bg
down and I suggested they should try me on a basal/bolus routine which
was begun on the 31st.  Rather a nice improvement there when they took
my advice.  ;)

OK, I admit they might have thought of that themselves eventually.  They
were probably being conservative on the theory that someone scared of
insulin might not be very accepting of the whole basal/bolus thing,
which is 4 shots a day the way they prescribed it (I actually take 5
now).  But once I accepted I was going on insulin, I was gonna want the
best routine possible for the tightest control, so basal/bolus was a
no-brainer.

And now for the shocker, peoples!  This next bit surprised me.

My labs on 5/30 were total cholesterol: 187, triglycerides: 248, HDL:
34, LDL(calculated): 103.  They have a little risk factor calculation
based on lipids and my score fell between &quot;average&quot; and &quot;2X average&quot; risk.

Then on 6/2, after my bg was relatively controlled for all of 2 days, I
had total cholesterol: 107, triglycerides: 121, HDL: 24 and LDL
(calculated): 58.8, risk factor: &quot;average&quot;.

OK, those numbers aren't exactly perfect or anything, certainly not the
60 60 60 that Dr. Davis suggests, but obviously, just a couple days of
controlled bg made a HUGE difference in fixing my lipid panel.  I mean,
my triglycerides and LDL were cut in HALF with only 2 days of relatively
normalized bg.  I was discharged from the hospital with what *they* say
is an AVERAGE risk for heart attack based on my lipids.

THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH MY CHOLESTEROL!  OK, it's not *ideal* -
but... it's not fucked up enough to cause a heart attack either.

I have sat here with you folks and agonized over whether or not to take
a statin all this damned time, and then worked for the Zetia compromise,
with Susan sniping at my heels about adrenal suppression through it all.
I've read and read like crazy trying to figure out who is right or
wrong about the lipid hypothesis thinking it was vitally important for
me to figure this out for myself, that my life might depend on it.  I
just got the Zetia refilled and it cost nearly $100 for a month's supply
and I'm paying this much money for a problem I don't even have while I'm
out of work.  I could've bought a couple YEARs worth of fish oil for
that.  AND I NEVER NEEDED CHOLESTEROL-LOWERING MEDS AT ALL!

With 4 months of good bg control, a drop of nearly 50% in my insulin
usage, HUGE piles of vegetables in my daily diet, supplementing fish
oil, vitamin D and pantothenic acid... my lipid panel is probably mighty
good-looking by now.  I have a lab appointment on November 16th to
confirm that, and once it's confirmed, it's goodbye to Zetia.

One of the things I &quot;got&quot; from the writeup of the the angioplasty was my
other two coronary arteries are looking good and the bypass surgeon said
my mammary arteries looked good too, so I'm apparently not terribly
plaque-ridden, which is a huge relief to know.  I dunno why the left
anterior descending artery got itself clogged up; I may understand that
better once I figure out what all this stuff in this pile of papers  means.

I am even more convinced now than ever that it was the elevated bg that
caused the heart attack, my own stupidity in being afraid of insulin.
Take home lesson: Don't be afraid of insulin, rather be afraid of not
doing whatever you need to do to treat high bg.

And if a doctor ever even THINKS the word &quot;statin&quot; in my presence again,
he shall have little cause to describe me as &quot;pleasant.&quot;

I had a heart valve (mitral) repaired in 1988, out of the blue. Just sorta
fell over on the beach while riding my bicycle and ended up on the operating
table a few days later at age 44. The surgeon who did my surgery did one
just like it a few days later, and the surgery was filmed. My cardiologist
sent me a copy. This was truly hard to watch! I remember seeing the s t o p
p e d heart in the surgeons hands. Something you didn't get to see that I
did was the surgeon cutting the heart open to get to the valve leaflets.
(The type of surgery you had is often called &quot;open heart&quot; but it isn't.)

Zetia is a cholesterol-lowering med, as that's the only effect it has been
shown to have. Statins (some at least) are heart attack and stroke
preventing meds, independent of lipids.

I would reach a different conclusion. Zetia would be a non-starter, since
your cholesterol is already low. Whether a statin is needed to reduce the
probability of another heart attack or a stroke is hard to say. If your bg
is tightly controlled and your lipids are good (including your hdl), and you
have no other known risk factors (elevated fibrinogen, Lp(a), etc., then I'd
say to skip the statin and blame the heart attack mostly on the bg.
Otherwise, I'd take a statin. ($4/month.)

You were afraid to take insulin and got an MI. Now you are afraid of a
statin. You may be right this time, but you should be sure your risks are
really low. The HDL is scarey, and I don't know how much you have been
tested for other risk factors like fibrinogen, Lp(a), etc.

The low HDL and high triglycerides are enough especially combined with
frank type-2 diabetes and inflammation fueled by adipocytokines from
VAT to cause the coronary atherosclerosis which is the substrate for
heart attacks.

If your LDL cholesterol is higher than 100 mg/dl, your doctor would be
following current NCEP-ATPIII guidelines to recommend ways of getting
it lower.

I'm pleased for you at those improvements and I agree about

changes have improved that HDL.

&gt; controlled bg made a HUGE difference in fixing my lipid panel.  I mean,
&gt; my triglycerides and LDL were cut in HALF with only 2 days of relatively
&gt; normalized bg.  I was discharged from the hospital with what *they* say
&gt; is an AVERAGE risk for heart attack based on my lipids.

&gt; THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH MY CHOLESTEROL!  OK, it's not *ideal* -
&gt; but... it's not fucked up enough to cause a heart attack either.

&gt; I have sat here with you folks and agonized over whether or not to take
&gt; a statin all this damned time, and then worked for the Zetia compromise,
&gt; with Susan sniping at my heels about adrenal suppression through it all.
&gt;   I've read and read like crazy trying to figure out who is right or
&gt; wrong about the lipid hypothesis thinking it was vitally important for
&gt; me to figure this out for myself, that my life might depend on it.  I
&gt; just got the Zetia refilled and it cost nearly $100 for a month's supply
&gt; and I'm paying this much money for a problem I don't even have while I'm
&gt; out of work.  I could've bought a couple YEARs worth of fish oil for
&gt; that.  AND I NEVER NEEDED CHOLESTEROL-LOWERING MEDS AT ALL!

&gt; With 4 months of good bg control, a drop of nearly 50% in my insulin
&gt; usage, HUGE piles of vegetables in my daily diet, supplementing fish
&gt; oil, vitamin D and pantothenic acid... my lipid panel is probably mighty
&gt; good-looking by now.  I have a lab appointment on November 16th to
&gt; confirm that, and once it's confirmed, it's goodbye to Zetia.

&gt; One of the things I &quot;got&quot; from the writeup of the the angioplasty was my
&gt; other two coronary arteries are looking good and the bypass surgeon said
&gt; my mammary arteries looked good too, so I'm apparently not terribly
&gt; plaque-ridden, which is a huge relief to know.  I dunno why the left
&gt; anterior descending artery got itself clogged up; I may understand that
&gt; better once I figure out what all this stuff in this pile of papers  means.

&gt; I am even more convinced now than ever that it was the elevated bg that
&gt; caused the heart attack, my own stupidity in being afraid of insulin.
&gt; Take home lesson: Don't be afraid of insulin, rather be afraid of not
&gt; doing whatever you need to do to treat high bg.

&gt; And if a doctor ever even THINKS the word &quot;statin&quot; in my presence again,
&gt; he shall have little cause to describe me as &quot;pleasant.&quot;

Hi Jackie,

Wow, I've got to admire your &quot;sleuthing&quot;.  What a smart way to address
the controversial statin question.  It does appear that the
uncontrolled BG along with its nasty side-effects were to blame for
your MI as opposed to the &quot;classic&quot; cardiovascular risks.  Given the
hospital history you've shared, for it's worth, I'd make the same
decision in regard to the statin, especially if you follow up with
other anti-inflammatory support like the fish oil.

Thanks for sharing your fear of insulin and the horrible experience
you went through because of the fear.  I've gathered that the fear of
insulin is not uncommon, and anything anyone can do to reassure those
faced with the insulin decision is fantastic.  I'm hoping that I
personally can maintain with diet &amp; exercise for many years to come
(due to all the wonderful advice I've received here on ASD), but if
that should change, I'll definitely remember your words of wisdom.

Best regards,
Michelle C., T2

Re my being on Coreg... I presume they just put me on a beta-blocker
cause they do that when you have a heart attack.  I asked to be switched
to Coreg as I figured reduced IR and bg were good side effects.  It
hasn't particularly done that yet, which is sort of an annoyance as it
costs a LOT more than Metropolol.  Guess I'll see how it goes for a while.

The cardiologist wants my bp below 110/70.  My bp is high, but it varies
a lot.  It's highest in the morning when I wake up (insert sound of
someone reminding me that's when cortisol is highest).  I hope to have
it down a lot before the next cardiology appointment in Dec via
exercise.  The cardio also OK'd me using Lite Salt again, and since I'm
testing my bp nearly as often as my bg, I should be pretty safe doing
that, which should also help.  I will argue about reducing the
beta-blocker if I can get myself some better numbers.

The hospital lab work says the normal range for serum potassium is
3.3-5.1 mmol/L.  Most of my blood work was 3.3-4.4, except for an
outlier of 8.9 the day after the angio.  So it doesn't look like I have
a potassium problem.  Sodium was a tad low a couple times, chloride was
a tad high a couple times, but barely out of range on either.  So
overall, it kinda looks like my aldosterone is OK.

I had just a bit of glucose and ketones in my urine when admitted.  I
presume the ketones from low-carbing and the glucose from severely
elevated bg.  Nothing looking like DKA there as my anion gap was in
range except it was strangely a bit low a day after the bypass.

BUN and creatinine were all in range.  They did see a trace of albumin
in my urine once, but that's an outlier as it was negative all the rest
of the time. So I've apparently got pretty good kidneys, which is pretty
kewl to know after 2 decades as a diabetic.

Magnesium was in range, which was something I was suspicious of and can
cross off my list now.  Apparently, the well water here has that covered.

Reading some of this labwork, I ought to be healthy as a horse.  Well,
except for all the little asterisks next to all the cardiac enzyme
tests.  Those are probably bad.  ;)

The only weird mineral I've got going on is low serum calcium levels.
Apparently, my left descending artery sucked it all out of my blood.
Dr. Davis' blog convinced me to take vitamin D3 so that's probably
better now.  I'm gonna ask the internist for a blood calcidiol test with
my next set of labs to see where I'm at with that.

Total serum protein and albumin were low and AST high, so I might have
some kind of liver issue going on.  It's definetly time to add milk
thistle to my regimen.  That'll take me to 19 pills per day; I'm not
gonna die of heart disease, but of choking to death on supplements.  ;)

Other than being squicked reading the surgery descriptions, these
records are pretty encouraging.  I'm not as scared about how screwed up
my body is as I was before.  It's a relief that the most I can find to
bitch about is swallowing too many pills.

The thing is, statins--for reasons not clear--reduce MIs and strokes. They
seem to do that in everyone by about the same relative risk reduction.
They've been studied well and the other methods that might work haven't
been. I blame the government. The commercial drug companies test drugs to
gain approval to market them. But the government(s) doesn';t do squat to
test other approaches in the same rigorous ways.

That's good. Certainly if you can get your HDL up to 60 and find no risks

&gt;I don't understand most of it; heart surgeons speak some language other
&gt; than English.  I shall have to interpret it line-by-line and that will
&gt; take some time since I don't have a cardiologist to act as an
&gt; interpreter handy.

&gt; The bits I did understand in the description of the surgeries squicked
&gt; me a bit; I am lucky to have little memory of how cut up I was and all
&gt; the tubes.  Such a graphic description is pretty weird, especially when
&gt; she discusses moving my heart around.  She moved it, then did some
&gt; stuff, then put it back.  EEEK!!!  Probably the most intimate I've ever
&gt; been with another human being, except for being unconscious at the time.
&gt;  Reading that probably raised my bp.

&gt; While there's lots I don't understand yet, I did understand a few things
&gt; right off the bat.

&gt; The admitting physician described me as a &quot;pleasant 45 year old woman.&quot;
&gt;  I had spent the previous night screaming and vomiting instead of
&gt; sleeping, I was in pain and on morphine, so... not exactly at my best.
&gt; I wouldn't have been offended had he said I was a bitch under those
&gt; circumstances, so I'm kinda proud that something &quot;pleasant&quot; showed
&gt; through all that.

&gt; My A1c on admission was 11.7.  This is the result of being afraid to go
&gt; on insulin for a year, folks.  I was an idiot.  A couple months ago, I
&gt; tested at 6.2, which is the result of both going on insulin and learning
&gt; as much as I possibly could about dosing for tight control.  So I have
&gt; been cured of this particular idiocy, but it would've been nice had I
&gt; not needed a heart attack for the wake-up call.  My internist was
&gt; thrilled with my A1c whereas I thought it was so-so, but now I know why
&gt; as that's one hell of an improvement in 2 months.  I bet I make the 55
&gt; club at my labs in November.

&gt; I was admitted and had the angioplasty on May 28th, had the bypass on
&gt; June 1st, and was discharged on June 4th.  I &quot;remembered&quot; a longer
&gt; hospitalization than that, turns out they got me in-and-out pretty
&gt; quickly.

&gt; My bg was checked with my daily blood work, which was usually drawn
&gt; between breakfast and lunch each day.  They also tested me daily several
&gt; times with a regular bg meter, but I have doctor's reports and lab work
&gt; here, not my entire charts, so I don't have all those readings, just the
&gt; numbers from the labs:

&gt; 5/29 - 271
&gt; 5/29 - 292
&gt; 5/30 - 209
&gt; 5/31 - 256
&gt;  6/1 - 147
&gt;  6/2 - 121
&gt;  6/4 - 122

&gt; These are numbers with STRICT low-carbing.  I've rarely been so strict
&gt; as I was freaking terrified and knew I didn't need to eat most of the
&gt; crap they put on my tray.  Still, they were better numbers than I'd had
&gt; for the year prior, when I'd never seen a reading under 300.  I was
&gt; started on insulin right off the bat.

&gt; You're wondering what happened on 6/1.  I'm not sure how they were
&gt; dosing my insulin prior to that, but I recall a discussion with one of
&gt; the internists on the 30th and he said they had been unable to get my bg
&gt; down and I suggested they should try me on a basal/bolus routine which
&gt; was begun on the 31st.  Rather a nice improvement there when they took
&gt; my advice.  ;)

&gt; OK, I admit they might have thought of that themselves eventually.  They
&gt; were probably being conservative on the theory that someone scared of
&gt; insulin might not be very accepting of the whole basal/bolus thing,
&gt; which is 4 shots a day the way they prescribed it (I actually take 5
&gt; now).  But once I accepted I was going on insulin, I was gonna want the
&gt; best routine possible for the tightest control, so basal/bolus was a
&gt; no-brainer.

&gt; And now for the shocker, peoples!  This next bit surprised me.

&gt; My labs on 5/30 were total cholesterol: 187, triglycerides: 248, HDL:
&gt; 34, LDL(calculated): 103.  They have a little risk factor calculation
&gt; based on lipids and my score fell between &quot;average&quot; and &quot;2X average&quot; risk.

&gt; Then on 6/2, after my bg was relatively controlled for all of 2 days, I
&gt; had total cholesterol: 107, triglycerides: 121, HDL: 24 and LDL
&gt; (calculated): 58.8, risk factor: &quot;average&quot;.

&gt; OK, those numbers aren't exactly perfect or anything, certainly not the
&gt; 60 60 60 that Dr. Davis suggests, but obviously, just a couple days of
&gt; controlled bg made a HUGE difference in fixing my lipid panel.  I mean,
&gt; my triglycerides and LDL were cut in HALF with only 2 days of relatively
&gt; normalized bg.  I was discharged from the hospital with what *they* say
&gt; is an AVERAGE risk for heart attack based on my lipids.

&gt; THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH MY CHOLESTEROL!  OK, it's not *ideal* -
&gt; but... it's not fucked up enough to cause a heart attack either.

&gt; I have sat here with you folks and agonized over whether or not to take
&gt; a statin all this damned time, and then worked for the Zetia compromise,
&gt; with Susan sniping at my heels about adrenal suppression through it all.
&gt;  I've read and read like crazy trying to figure out who is right or
&gt; wrong about the lipid hypothesis thinking it was vitally important for
&gt; me to figure this out for myself, that my life might depend on it.  I
&gt; just got the Zetia refilled and it cost nearly $100 for a month's supply
&gt; and I'm paying this much money for a problem I don't even have while I'm
&gt; out of work.  I could've bought a couple YEARs worth of fish oil for
&gt; that.  AND I NEVER NEEDED CHOLESTEROL-LOWERING MEDS AT ALL!

&gt; With 4 months of good bg control, a drop of nearly 50% in my insulin
&gt; usage, HUGE piles of vegetables in my daily diet, supplementing fish
&gt; oil, vitamin D and pantothenic acid... my lipid panel is probably mighty
&gt; good-looking by now.  I have a lab appointment on November 16th to
&gt; confirm that, and once it's confirmed, it's goodbye to Zetia.

&gt; One of the things I &quot;got&quot; from the writeup of the the angioplasty was my
&gt; other two coronary arteries are looking good and the bypass surgeon said
&gt; my mammary arteries looked good too, so I'm apparently not terribly
&gt; plaque-ridden, which is a huge relief to know.  I dunno why the left
&gt; anterior descending artery got itself clogged up; I may understand that
&gt; better once I figure out what all this stuff in this pile of papers
&gt; means.

&gt; I am even more convinced now than ever that it was the elevated bg that
&gt; caused the heart attack, my own stupidity in being afraid of insulin.
&gt; Take home lesson: Don't be afraid of insulin, rather be afraid of not
&gt; doing whatever you need to do to treat high bg.

&gt; And if a doctor ever even THINKS the word &quot;statin&quot; in my presence again,

It makes me feel kind of lucky that I just needed insulin from the getgo
with my diabetes, but I had my own lessons to learn with my coma.  I was
taking insulin, but not watching what was going on and not even attempting
tight control.  Lesson for everyone is that out of control blood glucose can
kill faster than you think.

Congrats on the recovery!

Based on my personal experience, I suspect high BGs on their own are
bad for an at-risk heart, even before some of the complications of
high BG such as arterial clogging set in. I also suspect that lowering
BGs from diabetic levels can have a surprisingly beneficial effect on
a dicky heart. I'll describe how my heart was before I discovered I
was diabetic, and what happened to it when I lowered my BGs.

I've certainly had one heart attack, and may have had more. The
cardiologists I have seen are in dispute about whether I've had just
one or two, and possibly even three. But no surgical intervention was
required. The period of time in which I had those possible attacks I
also suffered from episodes of arythmia in which I'd feel
uncomfortable, slightly choked, and weak and fragile enough that I'd
sit or lie down until they went, which was often the rest of the
day. My heart also felt a little bruised almost all of the time, and
there were slight chest pains which never entirely went.

I was pretty scared by all of this, and my cardiovascular exercise
plummetted.

On hearing of all these scary pains and arythmias my sister told me
that she had them too, and they always went away if she seriously
upped her cardiovascular exercise. She regarded them as a signal that
she'd been sitting around too much and needed to take her bike out for
a good run. That encouraged me, and I soon discovered that she was
right. The more cardiovascular exercise I took, the better my heart
felt. The pains and arythmias reduced a little.  However, the more
exercise I did, the more I was capable of, and after a year I was back
at my old pre-attack level of cardio fitness with one specific
exception. I never allowed my heart rate to rise above 140bpm. It felt
dangerous if I did, and my cardiologist and doctor told me that it
probably was. A treadmill test had shown up anomalies in my
cardiograph at over 150bpm which had worried the staff enough that
they weren't able to completely conceal from me how worried they were,
even if the speed with which they pulled me off the treadmill and made
me lie down hadn't given the game away.

Then later I was diagnosed with diabetes, and started the long process
of learning how to pull my postprandial BGs down. At diagnosis I was
exceeding 200 a few times a day, pretty much after every meal, and
sometimes after snacks too. A muffin and a mocha in Starbucks would do
it. I hadn't been diagnosed because my &quot;random&quot; tests in the doc's
surgery, or fasting, were always good. That wasn't too suprising,
considering that to get to see my doc I'd cycle up a long steep hill
:-) But because my mother was a T2 diabetic, and I knew I had some of
the symptoms, I kept asking my doc. He humoured me by testing me every
time I asked, but he did think I was worrying far too much about being
diabetic. As he said to me now and then, &quot;You're too thin to be
diabetic!&quot;

(He apologised to me after diagnosis. :-)

Six months post diagnosis I had got my BGs mostly under 155 post
prandially, and was getting down much lower than I had been between
meals by snacking less frequently on smaller amounts of lower GI
things. (I was actually aiming for Jennifer's 140, but didn't at the
time know about the difference between plasma and whole blood
calibrated meters.)

After another six months on these much lower BGs (which I was sti8ll
lowering) I noticed to my surprise that the typical constant mild
chest pain had become much less, and was mostly absent, and the
arythmias had almost entirely gone. The lowering of BG had achieved a
very obvious improvement in how my heart felt that years of exercise
alone had simply been unable to get anywhere near.

You might like to try testing BP and also heart rate when you wake up,
while still lying down, before you've got up, and moving as little as
possible after waking. To do that you'll have to have the kit
carefully laid out very conveniently the night before.

I typically lie in bed for several minutes after waking, just slowly
&quot;coming to&quot;. Then I typically bounce out of bed, and by the time I've
got dressed, got downstairs, and made a cup of tea I'm feeling bouncy
enough to do little jumps while moving around just for the fun of
it. Not surprisingly I have a high heart rate and BP at that time! But
if I carefully sneak up on my heart while it's still half asleep in
bed I can get surprisingly low readings.

I have a suspicion that having a high BP when bouncy is not in itself
a bad thing at all. What I suspect does the damage is not having a
really nice low BP when resting to allow recovery from the natural
stress of exertion. The body is designed to cope with periodic high
stress. The killer for it is when it's unable to rest enough to
recover properly before the next high stress episode. Hence the
utility of the daily meditation: it's good for your heart as well as
your brain :-)

Something else to keep in mind about the potassium test if it seems
high and they will no doubt retest to check:

&quot;Is there anything else I should know?
The way that your blood is drawn and handled may cause the potassium
level in the sample to be falsely high. If you clench and relax your
fist a lot while your blood is drawn, this will make potassium rise.
If blood comes out of your veins too fast or too slow, the blood cells
can break and increase potassium. Sometimes, if more than one tube of
blood is drawn at the same time, some potassium from the tubes with
the purple tops can get into the other tubes and increase the
potassium. If the specimen does not get from your doctor's office to
the laboratory quickly, the potassium can also increase. If there are
any questions as to how your blood was collected, your doctor may
request that the test be repeated before starting any treatment.&quot;

Very true.  It gave you the chance to realize that there was something
unusual about that particular sample, situation, that hadn't been
occurring regularly.  I find it very annoying when labs report
potassium results that are incompatible with life, knowing full well
the sample was no doubt hemolyzed, without at least a comment
