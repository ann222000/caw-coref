&gt;I don't have Barb's address...So

&gt;@@@@@ Now You're Cooking! Export Format

&gt;Kathy's Wild Rice Casserole

&gt;1/3 cup wild rice; par boiled
&gt;1 cup long grain rice; uncooked
&gt;2.5 cups chicken stock
&gt;2 to 3  shallots; finely sliced
&gt;1.5 cup mushrooms; chopped
&gt;3/4 cup pecan halves
&gt;2 tbsps Butter
&gt;2 to 3  garlic cloves; minced
&gt;1/2 tsp lots of fresh ground black pepper

&gt;Rinse well and par boil the wild rice about 8 minutes.
&gt;Mix with raw rinsed long grain rice and toss in the rest.
&gt;stir and bake at 350F for about 45 min or till done.

&gt;Tastes good, but better the next day as left overs. (with chunks/slices of
&gt;meat from previous meal kinda a cold stir fry/salad).

&gt;I used salty canned stock so i didn't use salted butter or use salt
&gt;anywhere else in the recipe.

&gt;makes enough for more than 4 as a side dish. .

&gt;Sometimes I add crisp crumbled bacon too about 4 strips.

&gt;Last time I toasted the pecans but it didn't seem to make a difference in
&gt;flavour. You could also use sliced almonds.

Here are the instructions Barb gave, as quoted in the first Pastorio
cookalong post: "Send them to my name (without anything between my
first and last names) at mac.com."

From my 3/9 post when your first brought it up:    "Send them to my
name (without anything between my first and last names) at mac.com.
If somebody's got another or a better idea, that's okay, too."

Dang, I'm sorry!  I didn't post.  I wound up just making mac &amp; cheese
because I never got the ingredients for my squash casserole.  The yellow
squash at the grocery store (for my squash casserole) looked awful.  And I
found out Market Basket on Summer Avenue closed; they always had the very
best produce!  Darn.  I know you suggested the Cracker Barrel Hash Brown
casserole knockoff but after careful consideration there was no way I could
use up 2 lbs. of cooked hash brown casserole nor do I have room in the
freezer for all the leftovers.

I didn't take any photos.  Heck, it was just mac &amp; cheese.  I'll bet a lot
of people did that as "comfort food".

Same thing my mother used, of course - Velveeta!  The "cheese sauce" is
poured over the cooked macaroni in a casserole dish and stirred well to
coat.  Topped with lightly buttered &amp; breadcrumbs and baked until browned

Ya just never know!  Maybe if I had a goat. ;)  But seriously, I've made mac
&amp; cheese using cheddar and various combinations of cheddar with other
cheeses.  They just don't meld into the white sauce as well as Velveeta.  If
it's due to the additives in Velveeta, so be it.  It's not like I make the
stuff every week or even every three months.  I did have some mac &amp; cheese
in the lunch I bought last week but that, too, is a rare thing for me.

--repeated--

I've repeat posted this dish a couple times... what's one more...

Noodle &amp; Cheese Casserole

In place of the 1 &amp; 1/2 pounds homemade noodles, I substitute a bag (12oz.)
of extra-wide egg noodles.

Cook 1 &amp; 1/2 pounds homemade noodles in rapidly boiling salted water for
about 8 minutes or until al dente. Drain well and keep warm.

WHILE noodles are cooking: Mash 1 cup creamy cottage cheese with 6 ounces
of (room temperature) cream cheese and 1 cup sour cream. THEN: Mix the mash
with the noodles in a bowl and season with 1/4 teaspoon each of salt and
pepper (I use white pepper to hide the specks).

Fold in lightly 1/3 cup finely chopped scallions or chives and turn the
mixture into a generously buttered 8"x8" casserole dish and smooth evenly.
Sprinkle with 1/2 cup fresh grated parmesan regiano cheese, dot with
unsalted butter and bake in a moderate oven (350 F.) for 30 minutes on the
middle oven rack.

Let sit to cool and set, about 1/2 hour. Slice into 4 x 4 OR 3 x 3 (grid),
serve and enjoy!!!

CDC, you've been warned! :)

&gt; Noodle &amp; Cheese Casserole

&gt; In place of the 1 &amp; 1/2 pounds homemade noodles, I substitute a bag
&gt; (12oz.) of extra-wide egg noodles.

&gt; Cook 1 &amp; 1/2 pounds homemade noodles in rapidly boiling salted water
&gt; for about 8 minutes or until al dente. Drain well and keep warm.

&gt; WHILE noodles are cooking: Mash 1 cup creamy cottage cheese with 6
&gt; ounces of (room temperature) cream cheese and 1 cup sour cream. THEN:
&gt; Mix the mash with the noodles in a bowl and season with 1/4 teaspoon
&gt; each of salt and pepper (I use white pepper to hide the specks).

&gt; Fold in lightly 1/3 cup finely chopped scallions or chives and turn
&gt; the mixture into a generously buttered 8&quot;x8&quot; casserole dish and
&gt; smooth evenly. Sprinkle with 1/2 cup fresh grated parmesan regiano
&gt; cheese, dot with unsalted butter and bake in a moderate oven (350 F.)
&gt; for 30 minutes on the middle oven rack.

&gt; Let sit to cool and set, about 1/2 hour. Slice into 4 x 4 OR 3 x 3
&gt; (grid), serve and enjoy!!!

&gt; CDC, you've been warned! :)

&gt;&gt; Ya just never know!  Maybe if I had a goat. ;)  But seriously, I've
&gt;&gt; made mac &amp; cheese using cheddar and various combinations of cheddar
&gt;&gt; with other cheeses.  They just don't meld into the white sauce as
&gt;&gt; well as Velveeta.

&gt; Too bad you don't have that monkey grass on your lanai anymore.  A
&gt; goat could make quick work of that.  LOL.

Oh, it's trying to come back!  Guess I missed some of the roots when I
sprayed it with RoundUp and then raked the s**t out.  The new little sprouts
got a good blast of RoundUp yesterday.  I'll give them another good dose
today then go at it with the garden rake again tomorrow.

&gt; Isn't Velveeta the stuff that comes in a jar?  If it is, I used the

That's Cheez-Whiz.  Velveeta comes in blocks, although I think they offer
shredded Velveeta, too.

REALLY?!  Shredded Velveeta.  I can't even imagine.  It's so soft, why
would one need to shred it?  &lt;I'm not on you, Jill, just genuinely
surprised.

TammyM, when feeling nostalgic, likes Velveeta on grilled cheese
sandwiches
