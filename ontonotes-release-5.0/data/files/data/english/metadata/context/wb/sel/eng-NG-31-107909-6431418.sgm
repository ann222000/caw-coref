This is extremely common and is normally caused by putting the tires on
with an impact gun.  They are supposed to be finished up with a torque
wrench.

You can buy torque wrenches for under $30.00 that are good for finishing
wheel lug nuts or making sure the tire change pricks aren't trying to
sucker you.

It would seem one of the latest scams by some $tealerships is to get you
in for a 'free' tire rotation, hammer the wheels on with an impact gun
and sucker you for a brake job.

pulsating as in ABS kicking on, or pulsating as in drag/release/drag/release?

If it's ABS then have them check the front sensors, one is either out of
range or close to it.

If it's drag/release (warped rotor) then it may be a MFG defect.  Long as
your under waranty I'd have them diagnose it.

If the finding is warped rotor, and you have to go out of pocket to fix it,
your better off buying new rotors and installing them  yourself.  It's not
a hard job.  Basically, if you can change a tire you can replace a rotor.
It's just two more bolts.

5000 miles is obviously too early to be having to deal with problems
like this. But your dealer will tell you that rotors are 'wear items',
not covered under warranty. but it is worth a try to see if they will
cover it.

I would not turn a warped rotor. Every time I have tried it, I get only
few miles before it reoccurrs and it's off to get a new one. Say what
you will, the aftermarket cast rotors can be had for not much more than
turning.

I agree that it is extremely common, but not that it is "caused" by the
impact gun.  I have barely six thousand miles on a set of new rotors, and
they are already pulsating a bit, along with Autozone "lifetime" pads.  I
put the wheels on with a torque wrench, of course.  Maybe I drove the
vehicle in the rain, or made a panic stop or two, but what the hell are you
supposed to do?

proper brake-in (pun intended) is key to long brake life.
http://www.stoptech.com/tech_info/wp_warped_brakedisk.shtml

The procedure is basically a series of increasingly quicker
stops from increasing speed, followed by a drive to allow the
disc to cool.

What you want to avoid with new brakes is to run hard, stop
hard, then sit there at the light with your foot on the brake.
That traps a lot of heat under the pad and will start the
warping process.

Hi Earle,
Agreed, Daimler's composite rotors and weak hubs are the problem. I've
slammed thousand of wheels on the Real American cars, and trucks without a

Any competent mechanic should have a set ot torque sticks.
http://www.sjdiscounttools.com/ameext50.html
I wouldn't use them on an aluminum Porsche hub, but for iron they are great.
If you want to be finicky, use the next lower range and then torque by hand.

The tire shop I go to has a set of torque spec standards on a doorway to
the parts room. First order of business in the morning is to take the
manual clicker torque wrench and check it's accuracy. Then all wheels
are finished up using a torque wrench.

Good article. I was reading the latest JC Whitney motorcycle catalog at
lunch. During the week I had, among
other things, relined 25 sets of vintage Lotus race car brake shoes with NOS
Ferrodo asbestos linings. This stuff is nearly impossible to find and prized
by vintage racers.
The catalog shows brake shoes and pads, "made with non-asbestos low friction
linings to avoid sqeaking". Low friction brake linings? For those times when
you really don't want to stop? What next, high friction oil?

I don't know if Jeep has learned anything useful from Mercedes, but my 300TD
uses soft nodular iron rotors that should be replaced rather than turned.
They seldom make it thru a second set of pads without warping, but they are
cheap, designed to be sacrificed.
They can be bought for as low as $17.30 each.

Kaleco's cross drilled brake lines. http://www.kalecoauto.com/

They don't have high friction brake oil, but I'm willing to bet
they would carry it. :)

'If' they will warranty it, get new rotors.

One other 'scam' reported is to 'fix' it free under warranty by turning
it so when it runs out of warranty there is no turning left and you them
must replace it on your dime.
