I just came into possession of an old printing company's type setting table.
This is a real solidly built piece of work. The table has a piece of marble,
set into the top, that is 2ft. x 6ft. x 2inches thick. The top of the marble
is so worn that the leading edge is rounded down along with the wood. The
handles on the drawers, which pull both ways front to back, and vice-versa,
say &quot;Hamilton&quot;.
I would like to use it as a food preparation island in the middle of my
kitchen. There is obviously a lot of lead, from the lead type setting,
coating the surface of the marble. I was wondering if there was any way to
resurface the marble, so I wouldn't have to worry about the lead. Or, should
I flip the marble, so that the bottom is up (a delicate process), thus
preserving the authenticity? (It's better looking sister was donated to the
Smithsonian)

We've been lead-free for years - since the late '70s or early '80s - I

But still I am not paranoid.

Jon, back in the late '60, cars started switching to unleaded gasoline,
so there aren't many left that still use leaded fuel. But from what I've
read, the soil is pretty much saturated with lead from the gas fumes
already.

There are some valid concerns about lead poisoning and slow development
in children, and I wouldn't want to be rolling out dough on contaminated
marble, but I think some of the hysteria is just that... hysteria. OTOH,
I'm also not sure flipping the marble over would solve the lead problem,
as marble is porous and may have absorbed the lead all the way through.

For lead pipes, I think if you run the water for 30 seconds before using
any of it, you remove the standing water in the pipes that have had
longer contact with the lead. I wouldn't be surprised if the pipes in
our house used lead solder, nor would I be surprised if the lower levels
of paint on our walls contained lead too, but I don't worry about it too
much - I just don't sand the walls down so I don't release lead dust
into the air! &lt;grin&gt;

Most of us here grew up around lead - in paint, in gasoline, in water
pipes, etc., and most of us don't seem developmentally challenged. Most
of our mothers smoked tobacco and drank a little liquor too while they
were pregnant, and a lot of relatives smoked around us when we were
kids. We never wore helmets while riding our bicycles, and we even
talked to strangers &lt;grin&gt;, but today parents get paranoid over
everything...

I read somewhere that every generation rebels against the one before it.
We rebelled against the conservative 50's and now the current feeling is
to rebel against the liberal 70's, and everyone is back to the paranoid
50's mindset again. &lt;sigh&gt;

Have fun, Michele

"/> It's not us guv'nor...it's them Germans, honest! Hey, I never said
that we were clean in the UK, just not to worry about a very low risk
problem when there are so many other poisons around.

In a reply to a private mail I wrote:

&quot;We've had leaded and unleaded petrol for quite a few years, but next
year there will
be no more leaded petrol in the UK. Some cars, like my old Passat GL5
cannot be converted
for lead free use and have to be scrapped. My original reply was
flippant, but there are SO many scares
no-one knows where to turn.

My mother had breast cancer but never smoked or took the pill, my
father's had a stroke
and he doesn't smoke and hardly ever drinks and is as skinny as a rake
etc etc. I think that we have just got to accept
minor risks that are blown out of all proportion.

The US/UK high fat/sugar/salt diets will kill off far more people than
minute particles of lead.&quot;

BTW don't fall into the trap of thinking that &quot;lead free&quot; means
&quot;pollution free&quot;. Cat converters don't kick in for the first 50 miles
anyway...and what about the carbon monoxide and sulphur dioxide?? I'd
rather eat a thousand meals prepared on that lead covered table than
stand in ten traffic jams (US or UK)

"/> Being an infamous destroyer of antiques, my suggestions are not to be
followed, however, my ideas often trigger the more knowledgeable in the
group to offer their help (after the horrified shrieks of &quot;Don't Do
That!&quot; have died down), so I'll give it a go. I'm assuming that this is
just traces and not a sheet of lead.
1. Lead can be removed with acid, but so can marble, so that's out.
2. Lead can be removed with heat. It vaporizes at a fairly low
temperature (500F-700F? Sorry, my references are in the other room and I
don't want to go look). You could try burning the lead off using a
propane torch with a flame spreader. Caution: keep the flame moving, and
don't heat any one section more than any other. In fact, the whole table
should be heated before you start. I would try leaving it outside on a
hot sunny day for at least 6 hours, maybe covering it with a black cloth
to help it absorb even more heat before trying any flames. Don't try to
use a torch on cold, cool, or even warm marble. It WILL crack! (The
voice of experience). If you're really careful and lucky, the gray lead
streaks will go, leaving the marble kind of yellowed and patchy
looking. Let it cool off at least as long as you let it heat up. Next
day, scrub the table with steel wool/soap pads (pots and pans grade)
followed by 000 steel wool and finishing with fine pumice or rottenstone
(rinse well between each scrubbing). Wear a particle mask if you'd like,
but the risk is minor. What fumes there are will drift off to join the
ghosts of the 11:1 pistons which died off with leaded gas.
3. If the table doesn't look too bad, look into some type of (resin?)
sealer. (If it don't go, chrome it).
I'm going to go hide under my desk out of the line of fire and remember
the good old days, when lead was good and an air conditioner was a
performance drag.

proliferation of the car. Seems, one car per family is not enough, the
*minimum* these days being two, and in many cases, each family member,
of legal driving status, having their own car.

I'm not awfully sure that my Volvo estate produces any more harmful
pollution, than say, a medium sized family saloon. Or if indeed, a
current high tech BMW (or similar) really uses that much more petrol
or pollutes more, than say a low tech Japanese family import.

One of the problem over here, seems that many folk will not walk the
length of themselves, preferring to hop into the car at every
opportunity and in many cases just to go less than 1/2 mile to the
nearest shop for a bottle of milk or a pack of fags.

A brief observation outside most schools, at dropping off and picking
up time will prove how ridiculous the situation has become, parent,
child, car ... parent, child, car .... lines and lines of them every
god damn day, whilst the other parent is off driving in the OTHER car.

I think, at the end of the day, we need LESS cars, and a ban on
private cars entering our Cities. Provided the car is well designed
and has an efficient well crafted efficient engine the physical size
of the body may well be irrelevant.

"/> Uncle Scott,
Quite simply, I think you should not use that table for food preparation.
Period. Any method mentioned by this group will not completely remove the
danger of lead poisoning your food. Lead is poison. It gets into your neurons
and turns you into a precious moments collector. Think about it.
What if this table had been soaked in cyanide for years, would you want to eat
food that had been prepared on it? How much cyanide would get into the food,
and how much would kill you? Unfortunately, the only way to find out would be
the hard way.
Find another use for the table, and get a safe one for the kitchen island.
Safe is better than sorry.

I answered this in alt.home.repair too - flipping the marble over won't
help as marble is porous and the lead will have leached all the way
through. As much as I'd love kneading bread dough on a table that size,
I don't suggest using it for any kind of food preparation.

However, there are specific paints that can encapsulate lead in drywall
paint. You might want to see if there are clear sealants that can safely
encapsulate the lead in the marble - I doubt it, but it may be worth a
shot.

Good luck and let us know what you do! Michele

Uncle Scott,
Slanejess is 110% correct in letting you know NOT to prep food on that table
top. As a plumber for over 25 years, I have been exposed to many of the
elements of lead - pouring it into cast iron joints, soldering copper water
pipes for years, and I STILL have traces of it in my system having been out
of the field for over 10 years! There is no acceptable way to remove it
(heating it will cause it to melt - but as previously mentioned marble IS a
porous surface. Some will linger . . . not to mention the fumes you
receive from not having the proper respiration equipment.) A good rule of
thumb: if in doubt - DON'T DO IT. I believe that if you call the toll free
number mentioned in one of the other posts, you would receive the same
information - I even recommend you do so. The government often overstates
(and normally under-reacts) to certain situations. As a rule, I don't do
either. But if that gorgeous table was mine, I'd find a way to get rid of
the marble and keep the base for another top. Be safe . . . not sorry.
Just my .02 worth.

"/> Hiya, Ronnie...

My answer to the US car problem is not higher gas prices. Except in the
most urban of areas, mass transportation is minimal. Egads... I live in
the Sierra Nevada Foothills, about 40 miles northeast of Sacramento,
California and about 100 miles WSW of Reno, Nevada. By auto, either of
these destinations is more or less a &quot;clean shot&quot; on a nice highway
(I-80). But without a car, there is just NO WAY for me to get out of
town. Nothing. Zero. Zip. Zilch.

I travel frequently down to the San Francisco Bay area. If I could catch
a train from Sacto, I would do it. Actually, I could, but I wouldn't
arrive down there until 11 a.m. ONE train daily to and from SF, and it
doesn't even get you there in time for business hours. And, it's a
commuter train, meaning that unless I'm traveling really light, there's
no room for my baggage if I'm planning an overnight stay.

Also, I live outside of our little hamlet of Grass Valley and there is
no public transporation to Grass Valley from here without having to walk
several miles of mountainous roads with no sidewalks. Even if I could
get to Grass Valley, there's no public transportation to Sacramento.
When I looked into the cost of a shuttle to Reno (we fly out of Reno
frequently) it was $150 EACH WAY. They get you on airfares, too.
Sacramento is much closer than Reno, but to fly out of Sacramento costs
so very much more we drive more than twice as far to get an affordable airfare.

Our US railroads seem to be in the business of putting trains out of
business. We're supposed to be able to take Amtrak from the nearby town
of Colfax to points east or west, but you get a bus instead of a train,
and it only runs through two or three times a week. That's stupid. A car
is a necessity anymore in the US if you want to have any sort of a life
outside of a crowded, stinking city. The rapists at the gas pumps can
demand their pound of flesh - I can continue to be taxed more and more
heavily for the &quot;priviledge&quot; of feeding myself - and what is the
government doing with that money? Creating alternatives? Hell, no.
Believe me, out here in California, that last thing in this life I want
to do is DRIVE into an urban area and get hopelessly mired in the tangle
of traffic which seems to be a pre-designed GOAL of our traffic
engineers. But what choice do I have? NONE. Damn... I'd much rather
catch a train, but there aren't any. There just aren't any options.

And maybe someone can tell me why gas runs about $1.50 - $1.60/gallon
here, $1.80 in the Bay area and $1.09 in Illinois?

When I owned horses I took a course in horse training. Their premise was
this simple: Make the right things easy and the wrong things hard. If
only our government officials would take that training course! They seem
to be in the business of making the right things impossible and the
necessities economically punitive.

Higher prices at the gas pump won't encourage me to drive less. I can't
avoid it. All it will do is put me out of my house sooner - make me work
harder so I can earn more income so I can be taxed at a higher
percentage. For what?

Dammit... I'm getting spitting mad now. And as regards the comment about
cigarette taxes... with all the crybabies whining about how much smokers
cost the public health care system, I'm now paying approximately
$30/week in TAXES on cigarettes. That would pay for a goodly chunk of my
private health insurance, if the government would allow me to KEEP that
money and use it for that. But, Nooooooooo... Do you know where much of
that money goes? CHILDREN'S LITERACY PROGRAMS! What in the hell does
that prove? What does it do to offset the cost to the goverment for
health care for smokers? NOTHING. And why does this happen? Because an
actor, a comedian actually, thought it would be a good idea, and all the
bleeding-heart liberal sheep in Hollywood found another cause for them
to rally around as they weep &quot;Well, what about the children?!&quot;

I have never, ever been a ward of the State. I do not plan be, either.
My smoking costs the state NOTHING. The punitive taxes are just another
way for our government to extract more from my already limited income
without benefitting me in the least. I'm not hurting anybody's children,
either. I don't have any, and I judiciously avoid contact with anyone else's.

Well, I got that off my chest, but I don't feel any better.

RAGards,

Tracy

Well, it really isn't all about laziness...unless you truly live
Downtown (and then you might not even own a car) the rest of folks live in
some version of a suburb. And there are no close shops, no close schools, no
close anything. Our cities are set up assuming you will have a car. I
actually live only about a mile from a store, but you can only get there via
a very busy street that has no sidewalks. Not conducive to sending the kids
to the store. And all those parents picking kids up are only taking them to
the next place... music lessons, sports, what have you. They gotta get there
somehow...and you really can't walk there, or expect your kids to. Add to
the distance problems the whole issue of needing to supervise your kids so
much more than ever before and you get gridlock/kidlock.
It's not that we want things this way... but unless you choose to live
in a really small town, or in the heart of a really big city...that's how
things are.
Tina - who really isn't a carpool kinda mom, but I can see how it
happens.

That's absolutely the best advice. I retired at 58 for no good reason
other than that I was tired of work (and the NYT was making buy-out
offers). Sure is wonderful not to have to commute those 43 miles each

&gt;&gt; Well Marshall, that would seem to be the answer to all the US car
&gt;&gt; problem, for the feds to hike the price of petrol way up by a whopping
&gt;&gt; big tax at the pump price. Same principle as high tax on cigarettes,
&gt;&gt; hoping it will hurt people enough in the pocket and they'll stop the
&gt;&gt; filthy habit. :)

&gt;&gt; Currently we pay, at the pump (varies slightly from region to region)
&gt;&gt; 79pences per litre for 4star (leaded) and 66pence per litre for
&gt;&gt; Unleaded, dev is slightly lower than Unleaded. That's *per litre*
&gt;&gt; course no-one over here really knows what a bloody litre is, so the
&gt;&gt; price doesn't always sink in .... but APPROX £3.50 + a gallon somehow
&gt;&gt; I don't think your constitution would allow that sort of price at the
&gt;&gt; pump. :)

&gt;&gt; Thanks for the article.

&gt;&gt; Ronnie
&gt;&gt; =====

&gt;Hiya, Ronnie...

&gt;My answer to the US car problem is not higher gas prices. Except in the
&gt;most urban of areas, mass transportation is minimal. Egads... I live in
&gt;the Sierra Nevada Foothills, about 40 miles northeast of Sacramento,
&gt;California and about 100 miles WSW of Reno, Nevada. By auto, either of
&gt;these destinations is more or less a &quot;clean shot&quot; on a nice highway
&gt;(I-80). But without a car, there is just NO WAY for me to get out of
&gt;town. Nothing. Zero. Zip. Zilch.

&gt;I travel frequently down to the San Francisco Bay area. If I could catch
&gt;a train from Sacto, I would do it. Actually, I could, but I wouldn't
&gt;arrive down there until 11 a.m. ONE train daily to and from SF, and it
&gt;doesn't even get you there in time for business hours. And, it's a
&gt;commuter train, meaning that unless I'm traveling really light, there's
&gt;no room for my baggage if I'm planning an overnight stay.

&gt;Also, I live outside of our little hamlet of Grass Valley and there is
&gt;no public transporation to Grass Valley from here without having to walk
&gt;several miles of mountainous roads with no sidewalks. Even if I could
&gt;get to Grass Valley, there's no public transportation to Sacramento.
&gt;When I looked into the cost of a shuttle to Reno (we fly out of Reno
&gt;frequently) it was $150 EACH WAY. They get you on airfares, too.
&gt;Sacramento is much closer than Reno, but to fly out of Sacramento costs
&gt;so very much more we drive more than twice as far to get an affordable airfare.

&gt;Our US railroads seem to be in the business of putting trains out of
&gt;business. We're supposed to be able to take Amtrak from the nearby town
&gt;of Colfax to points east or west, but you get a bus instead of a train,
&gt;and it only runs through two or three times a week. That's stupid. A car
&gt;is a necessity anymore in the US if you want to have any sort of a life
&gt;outside of a crowded, stinking city. The rapists at the gas pumps can
&gt;demand their pound of flesh - I can continue to be taxed more and more
&gt;heavily for the &quot;priviledge&quot; of feeding myself - and what is the
&gt;government doing with that money? Creating alternatives? Hell, no.
&gt;Believe me, out here in California, that last thing in this life I want
&gt;to do is DRIVE into an urban area and get hopelessly mired in the tangle
&gt;of traffic which seems to be a pre-designed GOAL of our traffic
&gt;engineers. But what choice do I have? NONE. Damn... I'd much rather
&gt;catch a train, but there aren't any. There just aren't any options.

&gt;And maybe someone can tell me why gas runs about $1.50 - $1.60/gallon
&gt;here, $1.80 in the Bay area and $1.09 in Illinois?

&gt;When I owned horses I took a course in horse training. Their premise was
&gt;this simple: Make the right things easy and the wrong things hard. If
&gt;only our government officials would take that training course! They seem
&gt;to be in the business of making the right things impossible and the
&gt;necessities economically punitive.

&gt;Higher prices at the gas pump won't encourage me to drive less. I can't
&gt;avoid it. All it will do is put me out of my house sooner - make me work
&gt;harder so I can earn more income so I can be taxed at a higher
&gt;percentage. For what?

&gt;Dammit... I'm getting spitting mad now. And as regards the comment about
&gt;cigarette taxes... with all the crybabies whining about how much smokers
&gt;cost the public health care system, I'm now paying approximately
&gt;$30/week in TAXES on cigarettes. That would pay for a goodly chunk of my
&gt;private health insurance, if the government would allow me to KEEP that
&gt;money and use it for that. But, Nooooooooo... Do you know where much of
&gt;that money goes? CHILDREN'S LITERACY PROGRAMS! What in the hell does
&gt;that prove? What does it do to offset the cost to the goverment for
&gt;health care for smokers? NOTHING. And why does this happen? Because an
&gt;actor, a comedian actually, thought it would be a good idea, and all the
&gt;bleeding-heart liberal sheep in Hollywood found another cause for them
&gt;to rally around as they weep &quot;Well, what about the children?!&quot;

&gt;I have never, ever been a ward of the State. I do not plan be, either.
&gt;My smoking costs the state NOTHING. The punitive taxes are just another
&gt;way for our government to extract more from my already limited income
&gt;without benefitting me in the least. I'm not hurting anybody's children,
&gt;either. I don't have any, and I judiciously avoid contact with anyone else's.

&gt;Well, I got that off my chest, but I don't feel any better.

&gt;RAGards,

&gt;Tracy

The train network system here has fallen apart, England is bad enough,
NI is somewhat a joke, although, to be fair here in NI over the last
10 years the rail system has underwent a huge improvement, ironic as
it may be, most of the work has been to reinstate formerly disbanded
line networks and stations closed down in the mid - late '60s. We even
pulled down the main central station, a fine Victorian building in the
middle of Belfast, we didn't blow this one up, the developers did it
for FREE ...Now, we have just re-instated it, within the last 5 years,
replaced with a pre-fabed and glass eye-sore, with a another F^&amp;()&amp;£%G
shopping mall up front. So we all got our problems. :)

We blame the government over here for the decline of the rail system,
we blame Maggie Thatcher for flogging most of it off to the
free-market, now we blame people like Richard Branson that run parts
of it and the other fat-cats, we never blame ourselves of course, for
the state it's in. We were too busy buying motor cars and demanding
the government to built bigger and better motor ways (freeway) to
accommodate even more bloody cars and nobody would be seen dead
getting a train.

At here at home we've got one of our motor way coming North in to
Belfast City with 12 frigging lanes all built on a land fill site on
reclaimed land from the sea and the road is STILL chock-a-block with
traffic, they have now run out on both sides and nothing can be done
or built, whilst the car keep on increasing and the jams get bigger
and the craic gets hotter. Where are they all going? toing and froing
between frigging out of town shopping centres! .... out of town
shopping centres!! ... another fecking wonderful brainwave by a some
moron.

IMO. the rail network system (HERE!!) declined to its current state
due to the motor car ... what do we do? ... Ask, Nancy .. but I think
it's rather obvious. :))

They did the same thing in a BIG way in New York City when they tore
down Pennsylvania Station, that glorious old Victorian landmark, and
replaced it with a cellar under Madison Square Garden. Now, the
powers-that-be realize the mistake, and there are plans to rebuild the
station -- on the site currently occupied by the famous New York post
office! That's the building that I first saw in a textbook in third
grade when we were learning about the postal creed (Neither snow nor
rain nor dark of night ... something like that) which is chiseled into
the huge structure's marble frieze. Only in New York ....

"/> Well Tracy, here we go again---Pop and Uncle Joe both retired from the Chicago
&amp; Northwestern RR. Hense--to this day---I can not ride on one without taking a
picture of it going around a bend!!! Checking out stations where ever I
travel!!!
A locomotive; even when it's standing still, has a sound and smell like nothing
else in the world. It BREATHES.

I actually feel sorry for people who've never ridden on a train.

its these same SUV driving, conspicuous consumers who are spending so much
time at the Canadian cigar bars that their little tykes are getting into
Mommy's jewellery box and eating her jewellery down to the lead core (I
guess after the SUV and the Martini's &amp; the cigars and the appropriate haute
Couture to wear to such places Mommy can't afford real jewellery- or maybe
she is into the urban/hippie minimalist trend) and the Canadian government
is going after the Canadian retailers. Go figure- you have to take a
written and a practical test to drive your SUV but any idiot can reproduce
and neglect/abuse their offspring. Its amazing the child didn't choke to
death prior to the finding the elevated lead levels in their bloodstream (no
word that the neglected little tyke has suffered any ill effect or arrested
development to date- at least not from the lead).

"/> same situation in Canada...Used to love the travelling to the West Coast every
summer by train. During one a recent (there's been so many of them) Air
Canada strike I was stranded in Montreal. My boss didn't see fit to replace
our $240 round trip airline tickets with $1000 one way (both prices per
person) day/nighter tickets -much less actual roomettes! Coach fare cost us
approx. $400 plus meals. (about the same as our plane fare plus 2 nights in a
decent hotel with a real bed &amp; shower facilities!).

As in the US, passenger travel has been deliberately reduced to focus on
freight. Its a shame

"/> Oh, I understand the collapse. Influence and politics. The railroads came
to be over all those vast distances because they had politicians on their
side, willing to give them thousands of miles of land in return for creating
a transportation system that allowed people to settle in all that spread-out
land so all the businesses had a market for their goods. Then the railroads
were essentially abandoned as governmental subsidies were transferred to
airlines and highways for the same reasons. But the reasons behind those
shifts of favor and subsidy, that I join you in not understanding.

It is clear that mass transportation needs massive infusions of money before
people will be free to abandon their cars. (Except for those few of us
lucky enough to get houses walking distance from work.)

Recently I saw someone describe our system as &quot;socialism for the rich and
free enterprise for the poor.&quot;

Now the long-distance trains are threatening to replace the dining car with
vending machines. Pooh! Not only a decline in taste and quality, but also
the loss of the arrogant, petty dictators who run the dining cars and add
interest and spice to the relaxation and fun of travelling. Go
cross-country on the train and you find about equal parts old people and
European travellers. Interesting people, but not enough to keep people
going.

"/> Thanks, Ronnie. Looks quite like a lot of the railroad stations in Midwest
USA.I look at the cars and wonder about the balance between decent service and
decent springs. Wouldn't it be lovely to take a long trip that supplied both?

Here we tend to turn the old stations into theme restaurants with names like The
Gandy Dancer, and put a new, ugly, tiny one down the road a bit. Although one
local town uses theirs for an enormous model railroad club that is reconstructing
the Detroit-Chicago line in miniature.

Our local railroad is actually trying to add a high-speed service for that same
route, but have recently announced an indefinite delay due to lack of
infrastructure. Like nobody knew that you have to have a strong foundation
before you can run really fast trains safely. At least we haven't QUITE given
up.

Michele,

Someone should write a book about antiques that
contain small to high levels of lead.

I am unaware of what antique items I own that could
possibly have lead in them but have a general idea
about some of them like some sconces I have. It looks
like the little round thing that hangs them from a nail
was attached with molten lead. Doesn't lead have a dark
greyish color? In its purest form isn't it somewhat
irritative to the skin? Just curious.

Doesn't 18th century glass contain some levels of lead
or was that during the 17th century? I heard something
like this somewhere.

And porcelain or ceramics....

Didn't Andy Warhol die of lead poisoning from a type
or porcelain or ceramics he liked to collect and use?

lead poisoning from old flaking paint and dust. The house my brother was

furnace came on lead dust was blown through the ventilation ducts, the

Mike,

dust every time they scrape or sand old painted surfaces,

Double ditto on that one! I refinish items of furniture
only when its the last resort but don't often stop to
think about the fact that the old layers of paint might
contain lead. I do wear protective dust masks but I think
I might double them up from now on just to be safer.

Your story is a good warning to people who are going to
buy or already own an old house! I plan to buy an old
house eventually myself. Often times old houses in
Sweden are left &quot;as is&quot; especially if they
haven't been taken care of through the years.
When buying in old house is it enough to repaint
over the old lead paint or does it have to be sealed?

Kat

Finally, a topic I know quite a bit about...

First - simply handling solid lead, items painted in lead-based paint
or glaze, or leaded glass will not cause lead poisoning in an adult or
child.

Second - the lead needs to be ingested, or otherwise get past the skin
barrier. Breathing lead dust (from sanding lead-based paint) can (and
often does) do it. I've heard of 3 interesting cases of lead
poisoning, that were not-so-normal - one from where a couple were
restoring a house and they knew they were stripping lead-based paint.
Their kids were not allowed in the house, (apparently they lived in a
new home, but bought the old one to restore) but the kids still got
lead poisoning from dust brought home in their parent's clothes. The
second one was a electrician who would strip wire while at work and
chew on the insulation (I have a similar bad habit when doing DIY).
The insulation had lead in it. Lastly a woman worked in the repair of
leaded windows and it was suggested that she didn't properly wash her
hands before meals which led to lead poisoning (breathing precautions
were used).

The problem with kids is that the lead, when introduced into the
bloodstream, is deposited rather quickly in the bones as they form.
This lead is later slowly released and causing long-term illnesses
(kidney &amp; liver damage). Most adults recover rather quickly when the
lead sourse is removed and the bloodstream becomes free from existing
lead (naturally through the kidneys if the dose is small, or through a
process (I don't remember the name - cheltinaziation or something
similar) where another, less harmful material is ingested or injected.
The lead in the blood binds to this material and is removed via the
kidneys more quickly. Unfortunately, the lead deposited in growing
bones (kids) is more difficult to remove.

The lead-based glaze &amp; paint is only harmful if it gets in your body -
if it's not chipping &amp; being eaten or being made into dust that is
breathed-in or gets into the eyes then it's relatively safe. You can
paint over it to contain it, but the safest way to remove lead-based
paint is to scrape it off, no sanding or heating (heat gus can cause
lead fumes which are then breathed with the same result as the
breathing the dust).

If you have lead-glazed pottery, don't use it for eating, you can
handle it, but foods can cause the lead to &quot;leach&quot; out of the glaze.
High acidic-content foods (like tomato sauce, fruit, etc.) accelerate
the process. The same holds true for galvanized metal utensils - only
use for dry foods. (There have been cases in the military where
(properly cleaned) galvanised trashcans were used for preparing
large-scale meals resulting in large-scale zinc poisoning outbreaks).

Leaded glass is entirely safe to use, and is still widely available.
The process of heating the materials (silica &amp; lead) binds the lead
within the glass such that it will never be removed.

&gt;Double ditto on that one! I refinish items of furniture

&gt;think about the fact that the old layers of paint might
&gt;contain lead. I do wear protective dust masks but I think
&gt;I might double them up from now on just to be safer.

&gt;Your story is a good warning to people who are going to

&gt;Sweden are left &quot;as is&quot; especially if they
&gt;haven't been taken care of through the years.
&gt;When buying in old house is it enough to repaint
&gt;over the old lead paint or does it have to be sealed?

&gt;&gt;&gt; Regards,

&gt;&gt; I must of missed this one when I was away Kat, lead poisoning is a
&gt;&gt; gradual process with adults, but it's with children that the symptoms
&gt;&gt; show up in first
&gt;&gt; and quite often the symptoms are put down to the flu or some other
&gt;&gt; virus. My Niece is two years old and has just come through treatment for
&gt;&gt; lead poisoning from old flaking paint and dust. The house my brother was
&gt;&gt; living in was one of the oldest in town ( circa 1825), every time the
&gt;&gt; furnace came on lead dust was blown through the ventilation ducts, the
&gt;&gt; lead levels they found in my niece's blood were the highest recorded in
&gt;&gt; the last ten years. Despite several visits to the doctor her condition
&gt;&gt; went undetected until my brother forced the issue by taking her to the
&gt;&gt; emergency room and insisting on blood tests. The best thing that fellow
&gt;&gt; with the old print table should do is to have it completely refinished
&gt;&gt; and get a new marble top, the old one is toxic waste and should be
&gt;&gt; treated as such. In answer to your other questions, yes lead is found in
&gt;&gt; some glazes used for ceramics and lead crystal does contain lead, there
&gt;&gt; have been some reports that high lead levels have been found in liquid
&gt;&gt; contained in some crystal decanters, pure lead is quite soft and will
&gt;&gt; leave a mark on paper much like a pencil and you can scratch it with
&gt;&gt; your fingernail. Anyone who does a lot of refinishing is exposed to lead
&gt;&gt; dust every time they scrape or sand old painted surfaces, if your going
&gt;&gt; to be in this type of business it's good idea to minimize your risk as
&gt;&gt; much as you can and get your blood checked on a regular basis ( Yearly)
&gt;&gt; for lead.

Lead is dangerous if you inhale or ingest it, otherwise it's not a major
concern. Lead glaze on pottery is something to be aware of though.
Mexican pottery is still made with lead glaze, and it's usually not
marked as such. Some Fiesta ware is said to have lead in the glaze too.
I think if the glaze is crazed or cracked, I wouldn't suggest using it
if you think it might contain lead. A lot of decorative Japanese pottery
has tiny stickers on them that say &quot;For Decorative Use Only. Not for
Food Use,&quot; because the glaze (or overpaint) contains lead.

Lead solder was used in water pipes for decades, and there are a lot of
folks worrying about it today... I may have lead in my water pipes, but
I usually let the water run for a while first before using it (let the
water that had been standing in the pipes flush out).

Crystal still contains lead, but I doubt in that form it's something to
worry about, unless you're literally eating the glass. &lt;g&gt;

IOW, don't worry about most forms of lead. If you have pre-1978 paint in
your house that flaking or chalky, lead in the glaze of your pottery, or
lead in your pipes, you might want to take precautions, otherwise, Don't
Worry, Be Happy! &lt;g&gt;

Have fun, Michele

mineral wool insulation made before 1978 has lead in it, and most house

There is a bit of urban legend associated with lead poisonning.
Minimum dosage...always tough to determine...below which damage to
human will occur, including children, is based on a University of
Pittsburgh researcher whose work is disputed and cannot be reproduced.
He has been implicated in fraud and having a hidden agenda...like,
keeping his job, etc.

The issue of lead content in eating or drinking implements has been
studied, including the long-term leaching of lead into a liquid or
into food. Results always are negative. Some researches publishes a
study saying the results are inconclusive and more study is needed,
and the whole thing dies. These articles appear about as often as El
Nino.

The whole thing revolves around minimum acceptible dosage and the
effects of long-term accumulation of trace (however that is defined)
lead, which no one has determined.

The megadoses from paint or handling lead are clearly defined events
to be avoided. The dosage issue led to the banning of lead in
gasoline, to be replaced by equally noxious carcinogenic organic
compounds. Now, they are thinking of eliminating these because they
are bad.

An apparent real source of poisoning in artist is in paints used for
portraits. Turpentine, the paints themselves, and the habit of artists
to cover themselves in these things...including licking brushes for
various reasons, has implicated these substances as sufficient source
of poisoning to have the government...ugh...consider establishing
standards.

Mad as a hatter or various painters: now you know the rest of the
story.

You are correct, sir. Mercury causes a tremor, brain deterioration,
and symptoms similar to syphillus, rabies, and other degenerative brain
disorders. Lead symptoms are similar. Mercury was used for tanning,
but I am not sure of what function, I believe that it was used in
compound as a poison that killed microorganisms. Arsenic was also used
very commonly for preserving of hides.

&gt; Good reasoned post but an aside - I belive that &quot;mad as a hatter&quot;
&gt; draws from the use of mercury in felt hat manufacturing.

Painters were hit with a double problem: lead oxide pigment, and mercury
based mildewcides. On the other hand, Van Gogh was supposed to have
been a heavy consumer of Absinthe, a liquor with hallucinogenic
properties that contained wormwood and other toxic compounds. This
could easily have caused hthe breakdown that he suffered late in life,
and it may have caused a tremor serious enough to amputate an ear while
shaving

Luddites, oversimplification and/or disortion of the original luddite
motives may be presented depending on what Ref. is used. I think the
motives were economic, they wanted to keep the source of income they
had, from jobs made obsolete by automatic looms.
