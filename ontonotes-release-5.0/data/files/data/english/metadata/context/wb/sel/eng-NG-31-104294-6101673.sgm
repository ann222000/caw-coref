This is the link for the page with the example: http://tech.reumer.net/Route/route.html .
On this page you can make a route on a map.

I have two problems:
* If you move a marker the cursor stays not on the marker but moves
faster and away of the marker you drag.
* If you move over a marker and the infowindow opens and close then
after about 20-25 there is an error b has no properties
http://maps.google.com/mapfiles/maps2.75.api.js line: 131.
This problem is also in other version of the api.

How can I solve both problems?

Best regards Mike

for 1) notice that the map is always moving the dragged marker to the center
of the screen.
I think it is because you have the

route.showRoute(center);

inside your drag function, that recenters the map, which almost certainly
confuses things. I can think of no reason to recenter the map during a drag
(and the API probably doesnt expect the map to be recentering during a drag)
.

as for 2), what browser are you using? I don't see anything in the Firefox
console (other than complaints about you css)

This was the problem. I remove the center and the cursor stays with
the marker when dragging.

I'm using FF2.0.
The problem occurs if you do a lot of moveover/mouseout of the marker
on the edge of a marker so it goes fast open/close.
Then the error shows in the console.

For 2) b has no properties:

I've made the chance it occurs lower by making a correct
Gicon.imageMap and set the point for the infoWindowAnchor outside the
clickable image. Then the infowindow won't flicker.

But if I open/close on a marker the infowindow about 25-30 times the
error "b has no properties" still occurs.

Anybody an idea?

I tried this. I don't think it's a function of the number of times.
Computer code is computer code: given the same input conditions it
will always behave the same way. So if something is causing an error
after 25 identical operations, there must be something else occurring
as well as the operations you're counting.

On one occasion I managed to get an error first time, and then it
occurred every time after that. In IE, I never produced an error (and
I have the Script Debugger, so it should have been flagged if there
was one).

I have a feeling that the error happens when the mouseout event is
triggered (closing the infoWindow) before the mouseover event (opening
the infoWindow) has been completely dealt with. Once that error has
occurred, "b" is never again given any properties and always produces
the error.

Just my two-penn'orth. I've no concrete evidence for that feeling as
debugging the API is difficult at the best of times, let alone with an
error which is difficult to reproduce.

Actually, I find the idea of infoWindow-on-mouseover difficult to use.
If opening the infoWindow scrolls the map, as it does on occasion,
then the marker is moved out from under the cursor and the infoWindow
is promptly closed. Not very usable!

Andrew, thanks for your explaination.

Strange that IE doesn't have the problem and FF has this problem.

Your remark on the use of the mouseover and mouseout is a good one.
Maybe a mouseout is not a great option. I'll think about a solution to
prevent that the close infowindow will start when the open infowindow
is running and the otherway around. And set a time for a specific time
before it may close.

If that's not a solution I'll remove the mouseout or let it work the
normal way witha click.

The url isn't valid anymore.

Problem not solved but no reactions anymore.
