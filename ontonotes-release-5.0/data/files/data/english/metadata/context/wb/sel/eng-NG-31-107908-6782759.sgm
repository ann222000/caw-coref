check the coolant level and thermostat.  lockup depends on the solenoid
getting signal from the engine computer - it won't send that signal
unless temperature conditions are met.

---------------------

Ditto to what Jim said . . . The cooling system has to be full, with NO
AIR (full reservoir cures air problems) so the computer can generate the
right signals.

Change the Z1 tranny fluid now and then too, Eh?

ok, but when checking coolant, look inside the radiator, not the
reservoir.  if there's too much air, it can't suck back properly and a
giant air lock can remain in the system.

ignore the temp gauge for this diagnostic - it runs on a different
sensor and the needle movement is non-linear so a large temp difference
shows no difference in the gauge.

i should do a write-up for diagnosing this problem some time and mail it
to  tegger for hosting.  right now, i have an led wired into my solenoid
circuit for this exact same situation - so i can see when the solenoid's
getting signal.  so far, the solenoid system is rock solid in that the
clutch locks whenever the solenoid gets signal.  but there is a problem
if that signal is not consistent.

basically, the signal goes out when the ecu believes in the car is going
fast enough, is in the correct gear and when the coolant is warm enough.
a partial [out of order] checklist therefore is:

1. check the solenoid for operation
2. check the circuitry that feeds it
3. make sure the coolant system is absolutely purged with absolutely no
airlocks
4. check the thermostat
5. check the the coolant sensor [the two-wire one under the distributor,
not the single wire one, that's for the gauge on the dash]
