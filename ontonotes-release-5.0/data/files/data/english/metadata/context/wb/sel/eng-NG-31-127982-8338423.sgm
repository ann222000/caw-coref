Anyone got a recommendation for a reader that will get shot of all this
non-music political garbage that is appearing in the NG?

Outlook Excess doesn't appear to have any method of blocking by NG title
strings, unless I'm missing summat.

I use Turnpike, and I've been applying the following kill rule:

/^Newsgroups:.*,.*,.*,/h

This kills any post which is cross-posted to four or more newsgroups.
You can use it in any news-reading software which allows the use of
regular expressions.

If you're looking to abandon OE, then Mozilla Thunderbird has a very
good reputation, plus it quickly learns to identify e-mail spam as well
(you teach it carefully for the first couple of weeks, then it gets them
almost all right).  And it's free, unlike Turnpike.

I use Thunderbird, and it's greta for email, but can't work out how to
do filtering on newsgroups other than on the contents of From: and
certainly haven't seen anywhere I could insert Molly's regular
expression. Can anyone give me any pointers?

Tbird can't do it. The best you can do is ignore the thread - press K.
(And even that doesn't work properly: if it expands another thread hit
the '\' key.)

The newsgroups features of Tbird are pretty basic.

I use Thunderbird for email but Turnpike for news.

Thunderbird's news support is poor, or undocumented. Sure it reads
newsgroups but I haven't found anyway I can sensibly filter out the
cross posting rubbish using Thunderbird, so after a few days of trying I
went back to Turnpike, where I am blissfully unaware of the activities
of those trying to ruin things for the rest of us.

If anyone knows how to properly filter news in Thunderbird please let me
know.

That's what I'm finding - I'm experimenting with Tbird at the moment as
my OE had gremlins. I'm just pressing K for Ignore Thread for all the
rubbish, which seems to work well enough.

&gt;&gt;TF

&gt;Forte Agent
&gt;40tude Dialog

&gt;Both are very good. The latter is free!
&gt;I use Forte Agent 1.93/32.576 it is excellent at filtering.

&gt;That's the good news. Now the not so good news.
&gt;You need more than two neurones to operate the filter system.
&gt;Reading the various threads in this ng has led me to believe
&gt;that you lot would be hard put to scrape two good ones up for
&gt;anything. Invoking the two plank syndrome to describe you
&gt;lot would be an insult to those suffering from it.

&gt;I believe there are still trial versions of earlier versions of Forte Agent
&gt;around which when the thirty days expire revert to a crippled version
&gt;of Forte Agent.

&gt;40tude Dialog is free and very good. It can deal with more than
&gt;one ISP and you can filter out the stuff I usually post very effectively.
&gt;However, the above caveat stands.

&gt;Remember, just because you are a carbon based brachiating
&gt;life form who can fuck around with a key board does mean that
&gt;you are human. After all you might come from Norfolk UK!!

&gt;God I love being helpfull.

I use Agent for news and Thunderbird for mail. I'm actually surprised
no-one's mentioned Agent yet. Even the free version is pretty good.
Having said that, I don't bother with filtering, although I might
start having seen the latest load of crap.

I don't think the old Free Agent does kill filters.

slrn does, and it's free, but it's a terminal based program and horrible
to use.

The equivalent of Molly's expression in slrn is:
Score: -9999
Newsgroups: .*,.*,.*,

All a question of taste. Exactly the above combination of newsreader and
killfile expression has done very nicely for me for many years.

Someone in another NG recommended nfilter as an adjunct to Thunderbird
http://www.nfilter.org/

&quot;unmaintained for six years or so, but it still does the job&quot;
I haven't tried it.
