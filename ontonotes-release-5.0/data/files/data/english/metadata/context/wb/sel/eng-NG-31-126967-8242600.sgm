Can someone fill me in on the theory behind using multiple subwoofers
in a listening room?  Particularly how cancellations and peaks can be
&quot;averaged&quot; to give smoother overall bass response.  I have 2 horn
loaded subs (9 foot folded horns) in my HT room which is 15ft x 29ft x
8.5ft high, I'm trying to figure out placement procedures, loading,
should I load the throats together separate, fire into the corners,
etc.  Ive just been trying different things by ear, but would like to
hear from anyones experience in placing multiple subs.

Interesting, I've got some similar subs, but they're too large for the small
house I'm in now.

I guess the best way is to just keep experimenting, although you can
probably get a program to simulate the entire system including the room.
Subs this powerful should probably be separated. Corner loading will get the
highest output by far, but also ragged response in most parts of the room.

Don't forget the possibility of aiming the throats downwards directly at the
floor, with some suitable supporting blocks. The mechanical coupling can
shake your neighbor's house, too.  :-)

Are you using an electronic crossover?
Watch your windows, etc., you can damage them.  ;-)

Yes I have electronic crossover and EQ for bass management and a RTA
(real time analyzer) to set the EQ for flat at whatever listening
positions I want to optimize/compromise for flatness.  I built these
subs from http://www.billfitzmaurice.com with the intention of using
them for my band/dj rig.  But they sound so clean and are so much more
efficient and lower in distortion than any sealed sub enclusures I
could buy, that I decided to use them in my new HT and build a
different set for pro sound use.  I have seen articles that seem to
defy logic in stating that multiple subs, properly placed, can be used
to smoothen overall response in my smallish room.  But wanted to get
some ideas here on placement.  So far the best arrangement is wall
loading them on the narrow front wall and V'ing the throats together
to form one large throat, but it takes up all my stage space, so I'm
going to move things to the back of the room and continue trial and
error with them separated.

A very good place to ask this question would be at Home Theater Shack.
There is a great deal of subwoofer experience there.  REW is a great free
tool, right up there ith TrueRTA, IMO.

My guess is that you use one for each channel, which means you need
your own crossover network for each channel.  No point at all in
driving them both off just the subwoofer channel.

I did the latest one from Audio eXpress magazine the Tuba24 last
weekend.

http://www.billfitzmaurice.com/T24.html

I may use these after all for dj rig but was just floored by how they
work with HT, because the plywood I used is not too pretty I'll just
paint them.  His construnction emthods are similar to what a carpenter
would do as opposed to a fancy cabinet maker, just cut the parts and
glue them, shoot some brads till the glue dries.  If you do build one
the throat must be absolutely air tight over it's whole travel, fill
leaks with glue.

He does have a some HT (non dj) subs to build here:

http://www.billfitzmaurice.com/T18.html

http://www.billfitzmaurice.com/THT.html

http://www.billfitzmaurice.com/TT.html

His subs are becoming very popular with dj's but these are blowing
away my Paradigm,Velodyne and my old Kinergetics 2x10 sealed enclosure
subs.  They kind of harken back to having a humongous set of Bogens or
Kipschhorns in the 1960's.  The table tuba looks cool too.

For now I was just coming out the summed sub output of my receiver and
into rta/eq then to my my QSC amp, so initial crossover is at 80hz.
If I do use a passive subwoofer like these I will use the lowpass side
of my stereo Rane crossover and eq the sub output from there with my
rta to match the room and go stereo.  They are 24hx24dx16w.  Yes
stereo power amp with phase switch ability, in case one of them needs

afaik, there's no exact formula for where
to place the subs; certainly practicality
is one key factor.  also afaik, two subs
is better than one for evening out room
bass response.  given what you've got i can't
think of any good reason to use more than two.
i mean, it's a good bet you can blow out the
windows with just one of those subs.  :)

your 24x24x16 sub size is small enough to let
you move them around to some extent, especially
if you have your TV surface and L/R/C speakers
2 or 3 feet out from the back wall

if your AVR is good enough, it may well be
your best choice as the crossover.  with mine,
i can state speaker distance (to the nearest foot)
and i assume that the AVR builds in a variable
time delay depending on the distance given.
like you, i'm crossing my sub at 80 Hz via my AVR,
and not by the crossover that is included within
my sub

i've been in the process, for several weeks,
of getting my single sub setup within a 5.1
multichannel speaker system

to me it's one of these things where i make
a change, run a 10-200 Hz frequency sweep,
and then pay attention to how the bass sounds
during my better recordings for at least a week

since you care about sound, you might
consider getting an OPPO universal player
(either the $149 or $229, www.oppodigital.com )
coz either plays SACD multichannel disks

Ah,  Speaker Builder magazine. The best.

Definitely try floor loading with those models. I'd begin at about 3-4&quot; off
the floor.

Do you have a tone [function] generator?

Anyway here's a simple [online] Eigenmode calculator,  showing how dramatic
the irregular  response can be:
http://www.hunecke.de/english/calculators/room-eigenmodes.html

Using multiple subs in different locations will definitely smooth out these
cancellations and peaks. *Where* to put your subs in your room, I don't
know.    :-)

Whether it's &quot;marketing collateral&quot; or not, renowned acoustics expert
Dr. Floyd Toole's research is pretty darn convincing. I suggest you
read http://www.harman.com/wp/pdf/multsubs.pdf if you want to have a
better idea.

A lot of people recommend &quot;corner loading&quot; the sub as the wall will
amplify specific bass frequencies. However this isn't necessarily a
good thing, and which frequencies is dependent on the dimensions of
the room...so no two rooms will get the same result. But then a lot of
people only care about loud bass, and don't fret over whether the bass
response is flat. Personally I didn't like the boominess with my
single Velodyne 12&quot; sub stuck in the corner of MY room. It sounded a

on the bass response is certain parts of the room, including one of
the seats on my couch. I picked up a cheap Sony 12&quot; sub and put it in
the middle of the back wall per multisubs.pdf, and immediately saw a
dramatic improvement. Bass is now much more even throughout my home
theater room...and if it was &quot;marketing collateral&quot; boy I sure got the
last laugh with my VELODYNE &amp; (I hate to say it) SONY subs.

Lastly, another trick of the trade is to wait until your wife or
girlfriend goes shopping for shoes and place your subwoofer WHERE YOU
SIT...then put in a familiar track with lots of bass or preferably a
bass tone from a HT setup DVD...and you walk around the
room...whereever the bass sounds best to you is where you should put
your sub. It may sound silly, but this ensures you will hear the
frequencies that sound best to YOUR ears when you trade places. Of
course this practice presumed a single sub, but I suppose you could
simply repeat the process for the 2nd after the 1st one is in place.

&gt; A lot of people recommend &quot;corner loading&quot; the sub as the wall will
&gt; amplify specific bass frequencies. However this isn't necessarily a
&gt; good thing, and which frequencies is dependent on the dimensions of
&gt; the room...so no two rooms will get the same result. But then a lot of

I agree with your analysis and methodology, but there are limits to
where you can place your sub woofer. Mine is 72&quot;Lx18&quot;Hx22&quot;D and contains
two long throw, magnetically shielded 15&quot; drivers in separate
acoustically isolated chambers. It is marginally smaller than a love
seat and just as heavy. I think that putting it in my listening position
is not practical.

I have it in the middle of the long wall in a 20'x22', cathedral ceiling
room with my 65&quot; HDTV on top of it. I've been using it for a stand for
over 10 years.

In my application, a single sub with two drives does an excellent job of
reproducing deep bass and (thanks to a dedicated 400 watt amp) seat shaking.

I didn't know Bogen was in that particular business, I thought they just did

When my family moved in the '60s, the previous owners of the house left
behind a pair of EV Aristocrats, with the full three-way horn configuration.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Yes I have electronic crossover and EQ for bass management and a RTA
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; (real time analyzer) to set the EQ for flat at whatever listening
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; positions I want to optimize/compromise for flatness.  I built these
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; subs from http://www.billfitzmaurice.comwiththe intention of using
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; them for my band/dj rig.
&gt; &gt;&gt; Looks like good stuff there, which model subs did you build?
&gt; &gt; I did the latest one from Audio eXpress magazine the Tuba24 last
&gt; &gt; weekend.
&gt; &gt; http://www.billfitzmaurice.com/T24.html
&gt; &gt; I may use these after all for dj rig but was just floored by how they
&gt; &gt; work with HT, because the plywood I used is not too pretty I'll just
&gt; &gt; paint them.  His construnction emthods are similar to what a carpenter
&gt; &gt; would do as opposed to a fancy cabinet maker, just cut the parts and
&gt; &gt; glue them, shoot some brads till the glue dries.  If you do build one
&gt; &gt; the throat must be absolutely air tight over it's whole travel, fill
&gt; &gt; leaks with glue.

&gt;  He does have a some HT (non dj) subs to build here:

&gt; &gt; http://www.billfitzmaurice.com/T18.html
&gt; &gt; http://www.billfitzmaurice.com/THT.html
&gt; &gt; http://www.billfitzmaurice.com/TT.html
&gt; &gt; His subs are becoming very popular with dj's but these are blowing
&gt; &gt; away my Paradigm,Velodyne and my old Kinergetics 2x10 sealed enclosure
&gt; &gt; subs.  They kind of harken back to having a humongous set of Bogens or
&gt; &gt; Kipschhorns in the 1960's.  The table tuba looks cool too.

&gt; Ah,  Speaker Builder magazine. The best.

&gt; Definitely try floor loading with those models. I'd begin at about 3-4&quot; off
&gt; the floor.

&gt; Do you have a tone [function] generator?
">

Yes I keep an rta with eq in the sub signal path and can adjust the
mic position for flat, and move the mic around to see other peaks/
valleys.  The rta has white/pink noise for function generator I use a
$15 test cd recorded using a $50,000 function generator(s) with about
60 different signals/frequencies.  My goal is to get all the listening
seats (9 of them) to be flat.

That's just silly, worrying about room modes when most audio room
design is about killing reflections and eliminating modes anyway,
double silly because the subwoofer is about unlocalizable frequencies,
and triple silly because it would interfere with imaging of 80-300hz
base that should come through normal channels.

Could a single subwoofer interfere with imaging? Highly unlikely, but if it
did, then adding another one with the right placement could very well
improve it.

Bass will only reflect from something massive like concrete, brick,
etc.  It can however be non-resonantly &quot;slowed down&quot; with 7lb/cu ft
rigid fiberglass, sonotubes, membrane bass traps, etc. which I have
done.  Drywall will slow it down too, but at a resonant cost.  With
one sub I'm exciting some pretty bad modes for practical movie use,
with the right placement of multiple subs I can smooth the nodes for
all my viewers.  Imaging above 80hz is not an issue for movie
soundtracks.  For serious music listening I just use my front mains
with no sub, so this setup is only for movies and tightening up
modes.  For that matter I use a completely different speakers and
stereo for serious listening.

Yes, aiming toward the floor. It loads the system and extends frequency
response sometimes dramatically, depending on the type and tuning of the
original system.
It's an old idea, the original designs were [I believe] by Cerwin-Vega in
the 70's [where is Gene these days, anyway?].

Years ago I used an old Karlson enclosure with an old 15&quot; JBL that worked
insanely well with this.  With the right type of floor and construction, the
mechanical coupling can add a very exciting effect.
