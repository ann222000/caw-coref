In the context of giving credit, I should also be given credit for participating in discussion on the topic and for suggesting the right way to accomplish things.
My thrust of writing was not to give credit but to discredit the misguided marches and meetings and andolans. These tactics are good only to stop things, not to get things done. In my life time (and I am 67) I have not seen a single good thing being &quot;built&quot; as a result of &quot;andolans&quot;. But I have not only seen but I have stopped a lot of things through &quot;andolans&quot;. On the other hand, I have also got several things done done through appropriate strategic approach outside andolans. I will be happy to list them if the readership has an interest.
We need to recognize what is the right strategy for each objective. I disagree with those who say Gandhi brought independence through andolan. To me, indpendence was the result of the &quot;failure&quot; of Britis raj. Thus, Gandhi first paralyzed (i.e. stopped) the British government, out of which came indpendence. I will reiterate that andolans are meant to stop things not to build things.

Did you know that about 90% of rural orphans are female and most of them are discarded at birth because &quot;it is a girl, not a boy&quot;. Not one of them gets the opportunity to become a doctor, engineer, IAF or university/college faculty. Because they can not live in the orphanage when they turn 18, many of them fall vicitim to different types of exploitation, including sex trade. IAFF has created an orphanage education fund to help qualified orphans to rise as high as they can climb in the educational/professional ladder.

Hi,
Court cases being valid and everything. The primary filip to the creation of NISER was actually Manmohan singh's visit to Bhubaneswar.

That was when the foundation stone was laid.

That should be considered a very important moment. Finally, it was a political requirement which got us NISER.

But, all credit to the people who played a major role. I guess it provided Oriya people with a cause to be united in a very long time(Even the opposition has some level of support for it).

Dear Subhas babu:

I think the court battle initiated by *two* people (one guy and his

lawyer friend) did have a significant role to play in this.

However, you may wonder about the following questions?

1. How did the two people who started the case know about the NIS

issue? (They read it in the papers.)

2. How did it come in the papers? (Who all told the papers about it?)

3. Who all gave the documents that were used

in the court case? (Newspaper reports by themselves are usually not

acceptable in courts.) Where did those documents come from?

4. When the high court case was sent to supreme court,

who all found a supreme court lawyer? Who paid for them?

5. Who all persuaded Arun Jaitely, a top lawyer in India, to represent

in the supreme court? (Orissa MPs.) Who paid for it?

6. Who all asked the Orissa MPs to do that. Why did the Orissa MPs

suddenly care about NIS, when they did not even know what NIS was?

etc. etc.

If you are really interested, you can call the guys who made the court

case and ask them. They would have answers to some of these questions.

(I have one of their phone numbers, if you need it.)

Some answers can be found in http://iiser . blogspot. com. (It most

likely misses some aspects.)

Even if one accepts your contention that the court case was the only

reason NISER happened, even then a lot people were involved in it,

including people in Agami Orissa.

However, I believe that Agami Orissa's actions had a significant role

in this as among other things it impacted the coverage in the media,

aroused people and convinced the MPs to take up the issue. (A big part

of the media coverage is chronicled at http://iiser . blogspot. com ).

Chitta

&gt; The success story of NISER will certainly boost the morale of people

who have fought tooth and nail with Central Government and both of you

along with members of NIS-IISER, My Odisha, Agamee Odisha and all

those 20 MP's from Orissa along with other MP's like Dr. Murali

President Shri DK Ray, I congratulate all of you and expect your

continued assistance from abroad for such noble cause.

&gt; Coming back to IIT/IIEST/KBK University including KBK Railways and

North Central University, I have made a booklet of 20 pages with

assistance from Dr. Sukumar Mishra, Asst. Prof IIT Delhi, which also

includes your letter to PM and CM regarding KBK Railways. To day I

have gone personally to the residence of 8 MP's in North and South

Avenues in New Delhi and have appraised about it and got assurance of

their full support in future. We should not be complacent with one

achivement, rather target complete solution of all sorts of problem of

every nook and corner of Orissa.

&gt; The request of one MP was why don't you tell us details about other

problem such as Forestry and Pollution. I will request you to have a

look at it.

&gt; The NISER should open the eye of all intellectuals as to what they

can achive together for Orissa, if they want to spare some of their

Respected Subhash babu,

Here is a thread for your reference, beginning of NISER movement.
http://groups.google.com/group/OrissaToday/browse_thread/thread/b86fa...

Most of the Orissa Leaders are sleeping leaders. If you will beat a drum
near their ear, also it is very difficult to wake them up.

A mission can have different paths;e.g. Gandhiji's Non-Violence and Netaji's
Azad Hind Fauj - both had  their relevance.
Gandhiji's method worked, because British, in spite of all bad qualities,
they were civilized people; couldn't kill or murder Gandhiji. Just think
&quot;What if the enemy would have been an Islamic Invader ?&quot; - whose method
would have worked ? Gandhiji would have been slaughtered or hanged in public
as Taliban did to former Afgan President Najibullah. In this case Netaji
Subhash Bose's INA would have done this job.

Now coming to the point the HRD ministers.

Mr. Vajpayee/MM Joshi combination are genuine pairs and for them people's
movement would have been supreme. We need not have to  go to court. Our
people's representatives shout at Parliament would have done that job.
It may be noted here that unlike Chandra babu Naidu, our vision less CM
couldn't cashed that opportunity for a progressive Orissa.

Now here comes our puppet PM Shri Manmohan Singh/Sonia powered and egoistic
Arjun Singh - Our MP's shout, people's movement didn't have any impact on
them. But shots were fired, but missed. This movement , whith a combined
effort of people , unearthed documents/proofs , which strengthened the court
case. Ultimately , PM knew in advance the outcome of such a case. He didn't
have the authority to hurt Arjun Singh's ego. Hence , he spent his money for
NISER.

Thanks
Manoj Padhi

Dear Manoj
Not being a historian or a social scholar, I do not have enoug facts to counter your points or to support them.
Finding which method will work and which will not is called &quot;strategic approach&quot; and I have been advocating it here and in other forums for the last many many years.
I would not dare to predict what a Muslim Invader would have done to Gandhi. But do not forget that Gandhi did face a violent death, and this did not come from a muslim invader. Rather it was done by a fanatic hindu. Do not forget that India was ruled by muslims for hundreds of years before British. They did not simply kill and wipe out all hindus to rule India. In fact, I have read, at least one of the islamic emperorers married a Hindu woman to appease hindus. I have also read that most Muslim rulers had astute Hindu advisors in their court of cousel. Thus, muslim rulers just like British rulers did use strategy rather than public marches and andolans to rule. It is true some of their strategies worked and some did not. When it comes to fanaticism, there is absolutely no difference between a Hindu fanatic, a Muslim fanatic or a Jewish or Christian fanatic. None of these would abhor violent methods to push their points of view.

But, all credit to the people who played a major role. I guess it provided Oriya people with a cause to be united in a very long time(Even the opposition has some level of support for it).

Dear Subhas babu:

I think the court battle initiated by *two* people (one guy and his

lawyer friend) did have a significant role to play in this.

However, you may wonder about the following questions?

1. How did the two people who started the case know about the NIS

issue? (They read it in the papers.)

2. How did it come in the papers? (Who all told the papers about it?)

3. Who all gave the documents that were used

in the court case? (Newspaper reports by themselves are usually not

acceptable in courts.) Where did those documents come from?

4. When the high court case was sent to supreme court,

who all found a supreme court lawyer? Who paid for them?

5. Who all persuaded Arun Jaitely, a top lawyer in India, to represent

in the supreme court? (Orissa MPs.) Who paid for it?

6. Who all asked the Orissa MPs to do that. Why did the Orissa MPs

suddenly care about NIS, when they did not even know what NIS was?

etc. etc.

If you are really interested, you can call the guys who made the court

case and ask them. They would have answers to some of these questions.

(I have one of their phone numbers, if you need it.)

Some answers can be found in http://iiser . blogspot. com. (It most

likely misses some aspects.)

Even if one accepts your contention that the court case was the only

reason NISER happened, even then a lot people were involved in it,

including people in Agami Orissa.

However, I believe that Agami Orissa's actions had a significant role

in this as among other things it impacted the coverage in the media,

aroused people and convinced the MPs to take up the issue. (A big part

of the media coverage is chronicled at http://iiser . blogspot. com ).

Respected Subhash babu,

You are absolutely correct in the following highlighted statement.

Another example is the agitation by AIIMS students (Reservation)  and
subsequent 'cheat' by PM/Arjun duo. After cheated, they knocked the door of
supreme court and got some temporary relief.

My point is in a democracy protests/rallys are legal and should be viewed
differently than that of rallies of political parties.

There are many failures like Mandal-1, but the agitation/self-immolation
was necessary to tell V.P.Singh that his social justice is going to divide
India. Now, we are seeing the consequences of such reservation - Lalu,
Mulayam, Chautala..

Street protests shown on Television is also a startergy to motivate public
and frighten the politicians. When a mission is finalised by CIVIL SOCIETY,
we need co-operation of politicians, NGOs, Governments (if possible) and
people to achieve the goal. If things don't look good, courts are always
there to help us.

Thanks

&gt; Respected Subhash babu,

&gt; Here is a thread for your reference, beginning of NISER movement.
&gt; http://groups.google.com/group/OrissaToday/browse_thread/thread/b86fa...

&gt; Most of the Orissa Leaders are sleeping leaders. If you will beat a drum
&gt; near their ear, also it is very difficult to wake them up.

&gt; A mission can have different paths;e.g. Gandhiji's Non-Violence and
&gt; Netaji's Azad Hind Fauj - both had  their relevance.
&gt; Gandhiji's method worked, because British, in spite of all bad qualities,
&gt; they were civilized people; couldn't kill or murder Gandhiji. Just think
&gt; &quot;What if the enemy would have been an Islamic Invader ?&quot; - whose method
&gt; would have worked ? Gandhiji would have been slaughtered or hanged in public
&gt; as Taliban did to former Afgan President Najibullah. In this case Netaji
&gt; Subhash Bose's INA would have done this job.

&gt; Now coming to the point the HRD ministers.

&gt; Mr. Vajpayee/MM Joshi combination are genuine pairs and for them people's
&gt; movement would have been supreme. We need not have to  go to court. Our
&gt; people's representatives shout at Parliament would have done that job.
&gt; It may be noted here that unlike Chandra babu Naidu, our vision less CM
&gt; couldn't cashed that opportunity for a progressive Orissa.

&gt; Now here comes our puppet PM Shri Manmohan Singh/Sonia powered and
&gt; egoistic Arjun Singh - Our MP's shout, people's movement didn't have any
&gt; impact on them. But shots were fired, but missed. This movement , whith a
&gt; combined effort of people , unearthed documents/proofs , which strengthened
&gt; the court case. Ultimately , PM knew in advance the outcome of such a case.
&gt; He didn't have the authority to hurt Arjun Singh's ego. Hence , he spent his
&gt; money for NISER.

As I have said repeatedly, andolans and marches and rallies have their useful roles in the society. They are used primarily to stop thihngs, events, actions, injustice etc. They are not the right strategy to get things done. That has been my personal experience and observation for nearly 50 years. You or no one has yet shown me where these andolans and marches actually got good things done. I will however admit that if stopping bad things from happening is same as getting good things done, then I am wrong and the march and rally leaders are right. It should then be obvious my perceptions cover a different angle.

Dear All,

In my opinion  &quot;Andolan&quot; is very much necessary to  protest against injustice meted out to the State. However, it should be carried out in a democratic way without affecting the normal life of the common man. Indeed, Orissa has been the most backward State in the country, owing to perpetual injustice meted out to the State by successive  Governments at the Centre, coupled with lack of initiative and drive of the people of the State.

So according to me we must protest against injustice and at the same time we must work hard, in our own domains, to ensure uplift  of the State.

Thanks,

J.N.Mahanty

Respected Subhash babu,

Here is a thread for your reference, beginning of NISER movement.
http://groups.google.com/group/OrissaToday/browse_thread/thread/b86fa...
Most of the Orissa Leaders are sleeping leaders. If you will beat a drum near their ear, also it is very difficult to wake them up.

A mission can have different paths;e.g. Gandhiji's Non-Violence and Netaji's Azad Hind Fauj - both had  their relevance.
Gandhiji's method worked, because British, in spite of all bad qualities, they were civilized people; couldn't kill or murder Gandhiji. Just think &quot;What if the enemy would have been an Islamic Invader ?&quot; - whose method would have worked ? Gandhiji would have been slaughtered or hanged in public as Taliban did to former Afgan President Najibullah. In this case Netaji Subhash Bose's INA would have done this job.

Now coming to the point the HRD ministers.

Mr. Vajpayee/MM Joshi combination are genuine pairs and for them people's movement would have been supreme. We need not have to  go to court. Our people's representatives shout at Parliament would have done that job.
It may be noted here that unlike Chandra babu Naidu, our vision less CM couldn't cashed that opportunity for a progressive Orissa.

Now here comes our puppet PM Shri Manmohan Singh/Sonia powered and egoistic Arjun Singh - Our MP's shout, people's movement didn't have any impact on them. But shots were fired, but missed. This movement , whith a combined effort of people , unearthed documents/proofs , which strengthened the court case. Ultimately , PM knew in advance the outcome of such a case. He didn't have the authority to hurt Arjun Singh's ego. Hence , he spent his money for NISER.

We need to recognize what is the right strategy for each objective. I disagree with those who say Gandhi brought independence through andolan. To me, indpendence was the result of the &quot;failure&quot; of Britis raj. Thus, Gandhi first paralyzed ( i.e. stopped) the British government, out of which came indpendence. I will reiterate that andolans are meant to stop things not to build things.

Hi,Court cases being valid and everything. The primary filip to the creation of NISER was actually Manmohan singh's visit to Bhubaneswar.That was when the foundation stone was laid.

I support the idea of Mr. Mahanty but added few points to it.

Andolan:

1.       Why

2.       when

3.       who

Why:

When there is injustice to state, to a person, to a community etc voice
should be raised. When that voice is coupled with feelings, destructive
act, it is termed as criminal activity, not Andolan. But in present
scenario who understands the meaning of it. Neither who is causing the
Protest nor who is doing the protest.

As you mentioned clearly &quot;Andolan&quot; is very much necessary to protest
against injustice meted out to the state. But see now, the people who
are doing Andolan are no more less than a terrorist.

If there is injustice and everybody understands that, all have to come
forward and the fight should be between one and one. One party should be
the person/group/party who did the injustice and other should be rest
janata. If that happens Andolan has some meaning. For that to happen
everyone has to understand their role in the society.

You might be thinking I am talking about Rama rajya or Nayak Movie. But
this is the motive of andolan and the very purpose for which the term
andolan was created.

When a particular group is agitating against a system, chance is very
less that one will get justice.

Again the question erupt:

Is it the only way to protest against injustice. What will happen if we
do Andolan? How long one can afford to be in this state? Is it like &quot;
one has to be continue Andolan till he get justice&quot;. If that is the case
I am not sure how many decade it will take. Again it may be asked who
will give the justice. Do you think one can expect justice when the
rulling party is doing some grave injustice to the state or to a lady
like Sheila Didi and when all the controls are in there hand. I
sincerely doubt about the outcome.

All are to be answered.

That does not mean we will not show them that the public/the janata of
the country/state will be a mute spectator to their activities.

Andolan or in my term protest should be initiated before something comes
into picture not after something already happened.

When:

As I mentioned Andolan should happen before something happens not after
something already done.

To implement this frame, one has to love/care/value his
position/power/conscience more over role in and for the society.

Who:

In my opinion, the persons who are in the power, should do the protest.
Home ministry/finanance who ever is trying for mal acts, it should be
get corrected by his colleagues only.

If that is not happening, of course common man like u and me has to
raise the voice. But before that we have to measure our activity. The
persons who are doing strike or protest should understand what it means.

In the latter case the educated mass like professors/doctors/layers etc.
should come forward. Are they coming? The answer is Big No with some
percentage of yes in it.The yes part -&gt;who are either in opposition or
have intention of gaining something from the strike.

While thinking about my state and the people I am messed up. Don't know
what will happen.

Snap shot of present andolan for those who can read oriya.

Thanks

Badal Naik

Dear All,

In my opinion  &quot;Andolan&quot; is very much necessary to  protest against
injustice meted out to the State. However, it should be carried out in a
democratic way without affecting the normal life of the common man.
Indeed, Orissa has been the most backward State in the country, owing to
perpetual injustice meted out to the State by successive  Governments at
the Centre, coupled with lack of initiative and drive of the people of
the State.

So according to me we must protest against injustice and at the same
time we must work hard, in our own domains, to ensure uplift  of the
State.

Thanks,

J.N.Mahanty

Respected Subhash babu,

You are absolutely correct in the following highlighted statement.

Another example is the agitation by AIIMS students (Reservation)  and
subsequent 'cheat' by PM/Arjun duo. After cheated, they knocked the door
of supreme court and got some temporary relief.

My point is in a democracy protests/rallys are legal and should be
viewed differently than that of rallies of political parties.

There are many failures like Mandal-1, but the agitation/self-immolation
was necessary to tell V.P.Singh that his social justice is going to
divide India. Now, we are seeing the consequences of such reservation -
Lalu, Mulayam, Chautala..

Street protests shown on Television is also a startergy to motivate
public and frighten the politicians. When a mission is finalised by
CIVIL SOCIETY, we need co-operation of politicians, NGOs, Governments
(if possible) and people to achieve the goal. If things don't look good,
courts are always there to help us.

Finding which method will work and which will not is called
&quot;strategic approach&quot; and I have been advocating it here and in other
forums for the last many many years.

I would not dare to predict what a Muslim Invader would have
done to Gandhi. But do not forget that Gandhi did face a violent death,
and this did not come from a muslim invader. Rather it was done by a
fanatic hindu. Do not forget that India was ruled by muslims for
hundreds of years before British. They did not simply kill and wipe out
all hindus to rule India. In fact, I have read, at least one of the
islamic emperorers married a Hindu woman to appease hindus. I have also
read that most Muslim rulers had astute Hindu advisors in their court of
cousel. Thus, muslim rulers just like British rulers did use strategy
rather than public marches and andolans to rule. It is true some of
their strategies worked and some did not. When it comes to fanaticism,
there is absolutely no difference between a Hindu fanatic, a Muslim
fanatic or a Jewish or Christian fanatic. None of these would abhor
violent methods to push their points of view.

Subhas Babu,

Normally I avoid writing. However, I was rather surprised with your assertions on Andolan. The civil rights and disobedience movements of Gandhi, Dr. Martin Luthar King, and Nelson Mandela are nothing but &quot;Andolan&quot; in Oriya. Without these people's movements people's representatives do not always listen or act.
I have major disagreement with those who say simplistically that Gandhi and Mandela brought changes through their Andolan. What they did was exactly what I am saying for days is the role of Andolan. They stopped the efficient functioning of the British Government in India and resulted in much killing and mutilation in South Africa. Thus, in each case, they stopped the government fron functioning. That is whay I say Andolan is a good mechanism to stop things not to do do things. You or any one else has not shown a single instance wher an Andolan has resulted in an IIT, or Medical College in the USA where you live. Martin Luther Kings Andolans did not bring civil rights law to USA, his death did. But then Martin Luther King was not fighting for a college or an institution.

Probably you are trying to deny history. In any civil society there are always movements (andolan for greater causes), and lobbying is not always the best practices. Look how US is spoiling our children's future (environmment) by listening to Oil lobby.
Those who are trying to paint that I am opposed to Andolan are mischaractrizing because they (including you) are not reading all my postings. How can I oppose Andolans when I myself was leading them? I had said earlier that each case must be studied on its own merit and which method is best should be planned strategically. Otherwise it will be like trying to dig a hole in the soil with a pocket knife (because it is easily available) instead of spending time to look for a shovel, which is harder to find when needed.
your reference to lobbying: That is an activity in a functional democracy. There are lobbying in all sides. Certainly every lobbying does not win out every time. If I start writing, this alone will take at least half a dozen lengthy posting. Therefore let me stop here.
your reference to pollution: This is close to my heart because I teach and do research on environmental biology. What you have said is a clear example of our misunderstanding rather than understanding of the underlying issues. People do not realize that any time we take our children in car in a very hot day with air-onditioning on at full speed harm the children more than any oil lobbying has ever done to our children.  House and car air conditioning, carpeting and lawn mowing  is one of the primary reasons of allergic reactons and is not caused through oil lobbying. This again is a tempting subject for me to go on writing, but I will stop here.

Regards,
Somdutt

Subject: [agamiorissa] Re: Fwd: Finally: NISER gets cabinet approval

Dear Subhas babu:

I think the court battle initiated by *two* people (one guy and his
lawyer friend) did have a significant role to play in this.

However, you may wonder about the following questions?

1. How did the two people who started the case know about the NIS
issue? (They read it in the papers.)
I visit Orissa every year. I know first hand that the first person who publicly opposed center's apathy towards Orissa was actually the CM himself. I have addressed this elaborately in my earlier postings. Center was not giving any thing to Orissa as a punishment for electing a non-Congress government. Therefore to claim that andolans brought awareness about center's apathy is a false claim.

2. How did it come in the papers? (Who all told the papers about it?)
I have been reading in papers about Center's apathy towards Orissa in all aspects (including road projects) for at least the last five years. If you read Oriya news papers for this period you will see this issue addressed from time to time long before the andolan got started. In fact, the andolan got started because government's oppoistion was not working

3. Who all gave the documents that were used
in the court case? (Newspaper reports by themselves are usually not
acceptable in courts.) Where did those documents come from?
Certainly the public marches and andolans did not supply these papers. People like you did a lot of research to supply these papers. That is the right strategy and I am advocating that all along.

4. When the high court case was sent to supreme court,
who all found a supreme court lawyer? Who paid for them?
Certainly not the publicc marches and andolans did not bring the lawyer . Finding the right lawyer is the right strategy and that is what I am advocating from the beginning.

5. Who all persuaded Arun Jaitely, a top lawyer in India, to represent
in the supreme court? (Orissa MPs.) Who paid for it?
Certainly not the public marches and andolans. Those who found the lawyer and paid for it is the right strategy and did it in the background. Regardless of what you others say, I do not accept that MPs found the lawyer and paid for them through public marches and andolans. I will need more facts and figures to accept that public marches and andolans by MPs got this done.

6. Who all asked the Orissa MPs to do that. Why did the Orissa MPs
suddenly care about NIS, when they did not even know what NIS was?
Certainly not the public marches and andolans. As you know, Oirssa MPs had raised questions in the parliament about the issue years ago long before the marches and andolans took place. If these MPs took interest because marches and andolans where held in front of their offices, then it is the right strategy because politicians do respond to public uprise. But I do not buy that marching in front of the Governer's residence/office aroused the MPs. From what I have read here and in public new papers, not a single march or meeting or andolan was held in front of the MPs offices. Marching in front of the assembly and the parliament is the right strategy but not marching in front of the governer's residence.

etc. etc.

If you are really interested, you can call the guys who made the court
case and ask them. They would have answers to some of these questions.
(I have one of their phone numbers, if you need it.)
I know you and take your statements as they are.

Some answers can be found in http://iiser . blogspot. com. (It most
likely misses some aspects.)

Even if one accepts your contention that the court case was the only
reason NISER happened, even then a lot people were involved in it,
including people in Agami Orissa.
I do pleas guilty to stating my point so curtly. I should have elaborated. When I said your efforts, I meant public marches and andolans. I did not mean your excellent research and the efforts of individuals (of Agamiorissa or not) who took strategic approaches to accomplish things. If you read my statemt below, you will find that I have mentioned some of the strategies needed. I am always opposed to public marches and andolans when some thing needs to be &quot;done&quot;. I am always in favor of public marches and andolans, when some thing needs to be &quot;stopped&quot;. Because I have addressed these repeatedly before, I did not elaborate them in my comments below. If you read my comments below, you will find that I have not said the court case &quot;alone&quot; accomplished the objective. However, if my comments left that implication, my apologies to individuals who felt insulted by my comments.

However, I believe that Agami Orissa's actions had a significant role
in this as among other things it impacted the coverage in the media,
aroused people and convinced the MPs to take up the issue. (A big part
of the media coverage is chronicled at http://iiser . blogspot. com ).
I am absolutely certain that the same results would have been achieved if these people had contacted each MP individually and collectively in the hall ways of the parliament (this is called lobbying) as I had advocated repeatedly. I do not

Respected Subhash babu,

The IIT in Assam was a reslult of Assam Agreement signed by former PM Shri
Rajiv Gandhi ji and All Assam Student Union. AASU, led by Praful Mahanta was
fighting for Central negligence and they have been awarded an IIT and other
benefits.

Agitations or 'Andolans' are tools to highlight issues. There is a sanskrit
sloka &quot;Neerab Sammati Lakshnam' - if you don't protest - your silence will
be taken as granted.

The Ideal concept of 'Ram Rajya', where a king / ruler usually pay
undercover visit to villages/cities/towns to know real problems - is no
where practiced.

'Andolana(s)' do stop things and causes gross inconvenience some times, but
some times the results of 'andolana(s)' outweigh the loss due to
stoppage/halt of a system.

Here are the following:

- Non-Violence Movement led by Gandhiji
- Vilence Movement by Netaji through INA
- Aydhoya Movement by BJP -&gt; 2MPs to 89- de-throne Congress from
center.
- If land losers/trade unions  won't protest - they will not get a
better bargain. No doubt, it may bring inconvenience to public and loss to
exchequer - but the Governments never do things voluntarily, they believe in
'Dekhenge' - only promises.

Unlike American form of democracy, the Indian form of democracy put smaller
states at disadvantageous position, because of smaller representation in
Parliament. Less seats means 'least important'.

Hope you will realise, why street protests/andolanas are important to
achieve our goals, when neglected time&amp; again.

Thanks
Manoj Padhi

&gt; in Oriya. Without these people's movements people's representatives do not
&gt; always listen or act.

&gt; *I have major disagreement with those who say simplistically that Gandhi
&gt; and Mandela brought changes through their Andolan. What they did was exactly
&gt; what I am saying for days is the role of Andolan. They stopped the efficient
&gt; functioning of the British Government in India and resulted in much killing
&gt; and mutilation in South Africa. Thus, in each case, they stopped the
&gt; government fron functioning. That is whay I say Andolan is a good mechanism
&gt; to stop things not to do do things. You or any one else has not shown a
&gt; single instance wher an Andolan has resulted in an IIT, or Medical College
&gt; in the USA where you live. Martin Luther Kings Andolans did not bring civil
&gt; rights law to USA, his death did. But then Martin Luther King was not
&gt; fighting for a college or an institution. *

&gt; Probably you are trying to deny history. In any civil society there are
&gt; always movements (andolan for greater causes), and lobbying is not always
&gt; the best practices. Look how US is spoiling our children's future
&gt; (environmment) by listening to Oil lobby.

&gt; *Those who are trying to paint that I am opposed to Andolan are
&gt; mischaractrizing because they (including you) are not reading all my
&gt; postings. How can I oppose Andolans when I myself was leading them? I had
&gt; said earlier that each case must be studied on its own merit and which
&gt; method is best should be planned strategically. Otherwise it will be like
&gt; trying to dig a hole in the soil with a pocket knife (because it is easily
&gt; available) instead of spending time to look for a shovel, which is harder to
&gt; find when needed. *

&gt; *your reference to lobbying: That is an activity in a functional
&gt; democracy. There are lobbying in all sides. Certainly every lobbying does
&gt; not win out every time. If I start writing, this alone will take at least
&gt; half a dozen lengthy posting. Therefore let me stop here. *

&gt; *your reference to pollution: This is close to my heart because I teach
&gt; and do research on environmental biology. What you have said is a clear
&gt; example of our misunderstanding rather than understanding of the underlying
&gt; issues. People do not realize that any time we take our children in car in a
&gt; very hot day with air-onditioning on at full speed harm the children
&gt; more than any oil lobbying has ever done to our children.  House and car air
&gt; conditioning, carpeting and lawn mowing  is one of the primary reasons of
&gt; allergic reactons and is not caused through oil lobbying. This again is a
&gt; tempting subject for me to go on writing, but I will stop here. *

&gt; Did you know that about 90% of rural orphans are female and most of them

&gt; Dear Subhas babu:

&gt; I think the court battle initiated by *two* people (one guy and his
&gt; lawyer friend) did have a significant role to play in this.

&gt; However, you may wonder about the following questions?

&gt; 1. How did the two people who started the case know about the NIS
&gt; issue? (They read it in the papers.)
&gt; I visit Orissa every year. I know first hand that the first person who
&gt; publicly opposed center's apathy towards Orissa was actually the CM himself.
&gt; I have addressed this elaborately in my earlier postings. Center was not
&gt; giving any thing to Orissa as a punishment for electing a non-Congress
&gt; government. Therefore to claim that andolans brought awareness about
&gt; center's apathy is a false claim.

&gt; 2. How did it come in the papers? (Who all told the papers about it?)
&gt; I have been reading in papers about Center's apathy towards Orissa in all
&gt; aspects (including road projects) for at least the last five years. If you
&gt; read Oriya news papers for this period you will see this issue addressed
&gt; from time to time long before the andolan got started. In fact, the andolan
&gt; got started because government's oppoistion was not working

&gt; 3. Who all gave the documents that were used
&gt; in the court case? (Newspaper reports by themselves are usually not
&gt; acceptable in courts.) Where did those documents come from?
&gt; Certainly the public marches and andolans did not supply these papers.
&gt; People like you did a lot of research to supply these papers. That is the
&gt; right strategy and I am advocating that all along.

&gt; 4. When the high court case was sent to supreme court,
&gt; who all found a supreme court lawyer? Who paid for them?
&gt; Certainly not the publicc marches and andolans did not bring the lawyer .
&gt; Finding the right lawyer is the right strategy and that is what I am
&gt; advocating from the beginning.

&gt; 5. Who all persuaded Arun Jaitely, a top lawyer in India, to represent
&gt; in the supreme court? (Orissa MPs.) Who paid for it?
&gt; Certainly not the public marches and andolans. Those who found the lawyer
&gt; and paid for it is the right strategy and did it in the background.
&gt; Regardless of what you others say, I do not accept that MPs found the lawyer
&gt; and paid for them through public marches and andolans. I will need more
&gt; facts and figures to accept that public marches and andolans by MPs got this
&gt; done.

&gt; 6. Who all asked the Orissa MPs to do that. Why did the Orissa MPs
&gt; suddenly care about NIS, when they did not even know what NIS was?
&gt; Certainly not the public marches and andolans. As you know, Oirssa MPs had
&gt; raised questions in the parliament about the issue years ago long before the
&gt; marches and andolans took place. If these MPs took interest because marches
&gt; and andolans where held in front of their offices, then it is the right
&gt; strategy because politicians do respond to public uprise. But I do not buy
&gt; that marching in front of the Governer's residence/office aroused the MPs.
&gt; From what I have read here and in public new papers, not a single march or
&gt; meeting or andolan was held in front of the MPs offices. Marching in front
&gt; of the assembly and the parliament is the right
