Subject: Will A Goji Grow In Chile?               Mar. 26, 2007.

Here is a request from a person asking about Goji Berries.

................................................................
................................................................

My name is Rodrigo M-noz and I am looking for goji
information, I read your article about goji and I am so
interested, can you give me more details on some links where I
can find more information?
I am Chilean and I would like grow goji in Chile but I don't
know if it is possible.

................

(JW  This part tells which plant is the read Goji Berry
and they sell the berries juice but not the plants themselves.
I made the mistake of buying Wolfberries from a company
that said they were about the same as Goji Berries.)

There are more than forty different types of berries that
are often referred to as goji berries, known in Tibet as
pang jia. But Tibet Authentic's goji berry - the largest
and most mature berry grown in the mountains of Tibet - is
considered by ancient and modern-day doctors and scientists
to be superior to all other goji berries, wolf berries and
goji derivatives such as goji juice products. Only Tibet
Authentic's goji berries have passed the Tibetan Medical
College's rigorous quality selection criteria.

According to the Tibetan Medical College, our goji berry.
will help you develop a stronger immune system, which  means
better resistance to illness.
Has anti-aging properties.
Will help you guard against c-ncer.
Brightens and improves your eyesight.
Nourishes your liver and kidneys.
Normalizes your blood pressure and blood sugar levels.
Assists with weight loss.
Lowers your cholesterol.
Slows hair loss and graying.
Rejuvenates your mind, your body, and your s-irit.
Are you wondering how a tiny red berry can have such a
positive effect on your health?
To start, the goji berry is higher in
http://www.tibetauthentic.com
antioxidants than any other known food. Antioxidants help
you maintain healthy vision and reduce your risk of ca-cer
and cardiovascular disease.
The goji berry contains 18 amino acids - the building
blocks for protein.
The goji berry contains over 12 times more protein than
apples, oranges, or strawberries.
The goji berry is a better source of beta-carotene than
carrots themselves.
The goji berry has higher levels of vitamin C than oranges.
The goji berry contains polysaccharides, which can help
prevent can-er, neutralize the side effects of chemotherapy
and radiation, normalize blood pressure, balance blood sugar,
combat autoimmune disease, act as an anti-inflammatory, lower
cholesterol, and increase calcium absorption.
We've offered you lots of examples of the goji berry's
health value. But we're not the only ones who recognize how
amazing the goji berry is. The goji berry was celebrated as
early as the first century A.D. by Shen Nong Ben Cao in the
Divine Farmer's Handbook of Natural Medicine (one of the most
important texts in the history of Chinese medicine).
Other doctors and scientists have recognized the value of
the goji berry, too:
Lycium [the goji berry tonifies jing [vital energy] and qi
[breath] and strengthens the yin tao [capacity for physical
exercise.
Tao Hong Jing, Commentary on the Divine Farmer's Handbook
of Natural Medicine Pang jia [goji berries] cu-e illness
related to the heart and clear heat discomfort and illness
within the body. Gama Rangjunduojie, Tibetan Medical Doctor

Timpanogos Nursery - Growers of Lycium barbarum or Goji
berry.
Here at Timpanogos Nursery, we operate both a State
Certified Nursery and a large Goji Berry Farm.
Timpanogos Nursery is located in the Rocky Mountains of
Utah.
The climate here in the Rocky Mountains is similar to the
Himalayan Mountains where the original Lycium barbarum or
Goji Berry is grown. Our Goji Berry plants are not the
Wolfberry variety. They are true Goji Berry plants, also
known as Lycium barbarum from Tibet and Mongolia.
True Goji Berries are sweeter, better tasting, and contain
extremely high levels of Antioxidants. The Wolfberry on
the other hand, has a slight bitter taste. Both the Goji
Berry and the Wolfberry are incredibly high in Antioxidants,
Vitamins and Minerals.
