I bought for £3 a marvellous new helmet from Sainsbury's this week and
gave it a good thorough test this morning. I can happily report that it
protected my head and ears from frostbite induced damage.

Much to my surprise, I found that drivers gave me more room than when I
cycle bare-headed.

If anyone out there is looking for a good, snug winter hat, I can
heartily recommend the black Thinsulate offering from Sainsbury's.

cheers,
Luke

You are conscious of being in different clothing, drivers can see you
ridding differently, and as such they will react differently.

This is a flaw in Dr Walkers research, which needs more investigation,
but alas with have the likes of Mr Bone MP &quot;Cycle helmets reduce
injuries my 12mph of energy in all cases&quot;.

Just wash it before use, what with all those mices apparently running
around their depots ;-)

That's because people who ride bikes in black wooly hats look more manual
workerish and therefore more likely to kick the daylights out of someone who
knocks them off ;). Complete the luck with grimey hi vis gear.

Sorry, I complete the look with my barely-still-alive 1998 Kelme jersey
and bibtights.

Cheers,
