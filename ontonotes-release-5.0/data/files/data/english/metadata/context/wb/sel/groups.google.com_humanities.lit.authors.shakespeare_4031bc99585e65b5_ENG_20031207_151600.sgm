BACON&#39;S MACBETH: Parallels Kathman Likes Better Than Stritmatter&#39;s.

In his article 'Oxford's Bible,' Kathman gave the Baconians a
sarcastic review (although Stritmatter fared worse) but when it
came to making a comparison between Stritmatter's parallels
versus those of Bacon Kathman, like Abbott, could find nothing
wrong with Bacon's commonplace book, the Promus.

Kathman wrote of the Promus:

It's really a remarkable piece of work. One of the sheets of the
Promus contains so many parallels to Romeo and Juliet, including
a single speech of Friar Laurence's, that even the Shakespearean
scholar Edwin Abbott (in his preface to Pott's edition) was hard
put to call it a coincidence. On the face of it, I find the
Promus better evidence for Bacon's authorship of Shakespeare
than the Folger Bible is for Oxford. On the one hand you have a
private notebook indisputably in Bacon's handwriting and
containing many parallels to Shakespeare; on the other hand you
have a Bible (the text of which was available to and known to
everyone) with markings probably by Oxford (but possibly not), a
relatively small percentage of which correspond to passages in
Shakespeare. &lt;&gt;
--------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----------

Here's a sample from Macbeth, some from the Promus,
some from Advancement of Learning, compiled in a 1958
issue of Baconiana:

BACON: The particular remedies which learning doth minister to
all the diseases of the mind . . .

Macbeth: Canst thou minister to a mind diseased?

BACON: Sleep nourisheth, or at least preserveth bodies a long
time without other nourishment.

Macbeth: Sleep, Chief nourisher in life's feast.&quot;

BACON: No cause of war is more pious than the overthrow of
tyranny under which the people lie prostrate, as if turned to
stone by the aspect of Medusa. (Medusa was the head Gorgon).

Macduff: Approach the chamber, and destroy your sight with a new
Gorgon! (a tyrant has seceded to the throne and note the
connection of Gorgons with tyrants in both Bacon and Macbeth).

BACON: When things are at the period of ill, they turn again.

Ross: Things at the worst will cease, or else climb upward.

BACON writes Lady Macbeth's adage in the Promus (1594-95):
Le chat aime le poisson, mais il' n'aime pas a mouiller la patte.

Lady Macbeth: Live a coward in thine own esteem, Letting 'I dare
not' wait upon 'I would,' Like the poor cat in the adage.

BACON in the Promus: Things done cannot be undone.

Lady Macbeth: What's done cannot be undone.

BACON: If a witch by imagination hurt any one afar off, if
cannot be done naturally, but by working upon the spirit of one
that comes to the witch, and from thence upon the imagination
of another.

Macbeth the play: (Note: here's no single line in the play that
expresses this Baconian preference for psychological
explanations over superstition (at a time Dr. Hall was feeding
his patients 'small round worms with red heads' if the
astrological charts were right) but Bacon *shows* his audience
that it is Macbeth's psychological susceptibility to superstition
that that induces Macbeth to initiate a self-fulfillment of the
'witches prophesies' which worked upon Macbeth's 'will' which
in turn influenced the 'imagination' of Lady Macbeth).

BACON: It is in life as it is in ways; the shortest way is
commonly the foulest.

Lady Macbeth: I fear thy nature; It is too full of the milk of
human kindness, To catch the nearest way.

BACON: It is nothing else but words, which rather sound
than signify anything.

Macbeth: It is a tale Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,
signifying nothing.

BACON: He is the devil's porter who does more than what is
required of him.

Porter: I'll devil porter it no further.

Best regards,

Elizabeth

It is an interesting commentary, to be sure: an acknowledgement of
sorts.

Isn't it remarkable that the closest things we have to manuscripts of
Shakespearean writing are in Bacon's hand?

The closest thing to a manuscript of Shakespeare's is Thomas More--even if he
didn't write any of it.

Interesting Promus/Macbeth parallels, though. Serious question: has hunted for
parallels between the Promus and any other writer of Bacon and Shakespeare's
time, like Marlowe? I think the way contemporary writers' vocabulary, imagery

Went to your link. Kathman's statement, which contradicts
what he now states on his website, was made in 1994. Furthermore
his closing statement that 'most Baconians quietly agree' is
pure invention.

No Baconians agree with Robertson and this is not Kathman's first
sloppy attribution.

For a few years Robertson was a law clerk and believed his
short career in a law office qualified him to dismiss the
skeptics like the great legal scholar Chief Justice Lord Penzance,
one of the finest legal scholars in English history, and
Chief Justice Holmes among others who believed that a lawyer
wrote the Shakespeare works.

Furthermore I would put Edwin Abbott's opinion of The Promus
up against Robertson's any day.

Edwin Abbott, despite his ugly personal attack on Bacon, was one of
the most accomplished scholars of the 19th century, fluent in Latin
and Greek and thoroughly familiar with classical writers as well
as Elizabethan authors. If you go to Perseus you can see examples
of Abbott's work in the classics.

If Robertson were correct--and he is not--Abbott would not have
endorsed Pott's edition of The Promus and written the preface to
her book.

1994 is awhile ago. My impression from Kathman's article there, is
that he had not yet read the &quot;Promus&quot; but was relying on trustworthy
(to his mind then) hearsay. The comment from the website seems more
knowledgeable and, I would therefore guess, more recent.

I don't see any contradiction. Can Elizabeth quote the two

This is yet another of Elizabeth suprious &quot;quotations.&quot; Here is the
selection from Dave Kathman's post that one presumes that Elizabeth is
(mis)quoting:

&quot;The logical conclusion is that either Bacon wrote all of
Elizabethan literature, or the supposed parallels are simply
reflections of the literary conventions and knowledge shared by
all educated Elizabethans and mean diddly squat as evidence. A
few Baconians embraced the first conclusion (and some still do
today; check out the latest issue of *Baconiana*, amazingly
still kicking after a century), but most quietly acknowledged
the second.&quot;

Of course, Dave Kathman knows FAR more about Baconians and their history
than does the hapless Elizabeth.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Really?! Is Elizabeth personally acquainted will ALL Baconians on
the planet, past and present? Given the grotesque manner in which
Elizabeth has distorted and misrepresented the opinions of people like
Akrigg and J.-P. Hsu in this forum, one is apt to be skeptical about
Elizabeth's preposterous précis of ANYONE'S opinion; however, such a
sweeping statement as hers above invites not merely skepticism but
outright disbelief.

Perhaps so, but Elizabeth's endorsement is singularly unpersuasive --
after all, Elizabeth would put the opinions (or more accurately, the
moronic misunderstandings) of a handful of ignorant cranks who don't
understand even the rudiments of first-year mathematics and physics up
against the opinions of the most distinguished physicists and
mathematicians of the past century! After all, this is the person who
wrote:

&quot;Janice, when paradigms begin to fail to describe the evidence,
they crumble. Marx crumbled, Freud crumbled, Einstein is crumbling

I see that you're catching on to the classic propaganda
techniques that are rampant in HLAS, Reedy.

The particular technique you're using against Lynne is called
'incrimination by association' and you've doubled the impact
by starting with a reference in which Janice tries to smear me
by an association with Baker.

&gt;&gt; Now, where Elizabeth resembles John Baker, etc.

Then you pick up Janice's smear of both Baker and me and
connect it to Lynne.

&gt; Lynne is guilty of the same thing, etc.

So now you've equated Lynne with Baker and what's
worse, you haven't confronted Lynne directly but gone
behind her back to Janice with something Janice went
behind my back to someone else.

&gt; memory serves me ...&quot;

"/>

But there is a huge qualitative difference. Lynne has never given me
reason to suspect that she has never read the books she mentions. In
stark contrast, the conclusion that Elizabeth has never laid eyes upon
the works that she cites is inescapable.

For example, take the following exchange:
-------------------------------
Elizabeth:

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Here's a site on gender studies where a bibliography of
&gt;&gt; transexualism features a book on Southampton.

&gt;&gt; http://faculty.washington.edu/alvin/gaycat.htm

"/>

Me:

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; The only reference I see to Southampton is to Akrigg's _Shakespeare
&gt; and the Earl of Southampton_; is that *really* the book you had in
&gt; mind? If so, where does Akrigg opine that Southampton was &quot;overly fond
&gt; of drag,&quot; that he used to &quot;hang about the theatres hoping to play
&gt; female roles,&quot; or that he was &quot;very convincing as a girl&quot;? Or did you
&gt; just make that up?

"/>

Elizabeth:
Why else would a site on queer studies have a book on Southampton
listed in the biography [sic!]?
--------------------------------

While the ultimate rhetorical question above makes it evident that
Elizabeth had not read Akrigg, the following quote from the book itself
is decisive:

&quot;It all adds up to one thing: nothing would be less surprising
than to learn that during certain periods of his early life
Southampton passed through homosexual phases but, until better
evidence is found, only a fool will declare that he did.&quot;

As another example, take Elizabeth's farcical misrepresentation of
the work of J.-P. Hsu, whom she plainly had never read:

&quot;Prof. JP Hsu at UMass spent his entire professional career--close
to 40 years--'agonizing over whether the basic principles of special
relativity are correct' and found them wanting .Hsu notes that his
L-P relativity survived 15 years of intensive peer review.&quot;

and

&quot;You don't want to talk about it because if JP Hsu is right, you're
wrong and I'm right. I argued essentially what Hsu proved--that L-P
relativity underlies Einstein's rhetorical shell, that the speed of
light is local and that there is an ether, something that Einstein
had to start backing into as soon as he made his unscientific
announcement that it didn't exist.&quot;

As we have seen, Professor Hsu himself says something quite different:

&quot;...our work on Taiji Relativity is not a repudiation of Einstein's
work at all.&quot;

Or, consider Elizabeth's farcical distortion of the papers of Eliyahu
Rips that she plainly had never read, and her concomitant (and comic)
confusion of Rips with Drosnin:

&quot;Leary, at least, doesn't think that his algorithm can 'retroactively
predict the future' as Rips' unscientific bible code is claimed to
do.&quot;

The &quot;Bible code&quot; prediction nonsense is Drosnin's, not Rips's. Indeed,
Rips explicitly repudiated it in his public statement on the matter:
----------------------------------------
PUBLIC STATEMENT BY DR. ELIYAHU RIPS Professor of Mathematics Hebrew
University Jerusalem, Israel

I have seen Michael Drosnin's book 'The Bible Code'.

1) There is indeed serious scientific research being conducted with
regard to the Bible Codes.

2) While I did meet and talk to Mr. Drosnin, I did not do joint work
with him.

3) I do not support Mr. Drosnin's work on the Codes, nor the conclusions
he derives.

4) There is an impression that I was involved in finding the code
relating to Prime Minister Rabin's assassination.  This is not true.

5) However, I did witness, in 1994, Mr. Drosnin find the tableaux about
Prime Minister Rabin, which now appears on the cover of his book.

6) For me, it was a catalyst to ask whether we can, from a scientific
point of view, attempt to use the Codes to predict future events. After
much thought, my categorical answer is no.  All attempts to extract
messages from Torah codes, or to make predictions based on them, are
futile and are of no value. This is not only my own opinion, but the
opinion of every scientist who has been involved in serious Codes
research.

&gt;&gt; his closing statement that 'most Baconians quietly agree' is
&gt;&gt; pure invention.

&gt;&gt; No Baconians agree with Robertson and this is not Kathman's first
&gt;&gt; sloppy attribution.

&gt;&gt; For a few years Robertson was a law clerk and believed his
&gt;&gt; short career in a law office qualified him to dismiss the
&gt;&gt; skeptics like the great legal scholar Chief Justice Lord Penzance,
&gt;&gt; one of the finest legal scholars in English history, and
&gt;&gt; Chief Justice Holmes among others who believed that a lawyer

His infallibility as to what? He points out a clear connection; David

&gt; I see that you're catching on to the classic propaganda
&gt; techniques that are rampant in HLAS, Reedy.

&gt; The particular technique you're using against Lynne is called
&gt; 'incrimination by association' and you've doubled the impact
&gt; by starting with a reference in which Janice tries to smear me
&gt; by an association with Baker.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Now, where Elizabeth resembles John Baker, etc.

&gt; Then you pick up Janice's smear of both Baker and me and
&gt; connect it to Lynne.

&gt;&gt; Lynne is guilty of the same thing, etc.

&gt; So now you've equated Lynne with Baker and what's
&gt; worse, you haven't confronted Lynne directly but gone
&gt; behind her back to Janice with something Janice went
&gt; behind my back to someone else.

The notion that one can go &quot;behind [someone's] back&quot; on a public
forum affording world-wide access is indeed puzzling. Elizabeth
displays scant familiarity with modern technology (indeed, even such
dated technology as the book seems sufficiently novel to Elizabeth that
she evidently has not yet figured out what to do with one), so perhaps
she is confusing public Usenet discussion groups with private e-mail.

&lt;snip&gt;

Here's the link from my post above.
&lt;&gt;.

Kathman's contradictory statement is based on the fact that
Kathman didn't have Stritmatter's thesis in 1994.

Kathman's target in 1994 was Fowler's Shakespeare Revealed
in Oxford's Letters.

Kathman condemned the Promus ('Fowler's Shakespeare
Revealed reminds me of the Promus. . .') in order to link Fowler
to all the negativity Strats have dumped on the Baconians.
Sort of like tarring Fowler with the Baconian brush except
Kathman is holding the tar pot and doing the brushing.

Having associated the Promus with Shakespeare Revealed,
Kathman uses both to make an unfavorable comparison with a
Strat computer study under discussion in that thread. I don't doubt
that Fowler's Shakespeare Revealed proves nothing--I've read
Oxford's letters and there's maybe one trope in seventy letters--
but Kathman has no data on the Promus except that done by
hand by Baconians in the 19th century. In other words, Kathman
doesn't know what he's talking about but nevertheless leaves
Bacon and Oxford all tarry and the Stratford tradesman all shiny
and high tech and true.

By 2001, Kathman had Stritmatter's thesis and then compared it
very unfavorably to the Promus, characterizing the Promus
as 'remarkable' and citing Abbott's approval of it. Kathman did this
in order to lower Strittmatter to below--if you can even picture this--
the level of Baconians.

This is a familiar device in ideological rhetoric in which the
writer demotes one thing, person or idea by elevating
another. Nothing really moves and nothing is really proven,
it's just a mental trick. It worked for Kathman only because the
Strats have been hammering the Baconians into the ground since
1857 but it worked especially well because this time

Kathman was actually telling the truth.

Everything Kathman said about the Promus (in 2001) was
factually true. The Promus parallels are superior in every way to
Stritmatter's doubtful underlinings (most likely done by a closet
Calvinist in light of the sum of their doctrine). Bacon's parallels
are in the author's own hand while Stritmatter can't be sure--based
on one handwriting analyst's opinion of a very marginal sample--
that the handwriting is even Oxford's. I think it's Anne Cecil's.

So yes, Kathman contradicted himself on the Promus..

Best regards,

Elizabeth

There are 2000 notations in the Promus. It's easy to pick
out some of the proverbs and commonplaces and make the
claim that those disqualify Bacon but I doubt there are even
a hundred popular sayings in the Promus. I've looked at
Edwin Reed's book with about six hundred parallels, Cockburn
lists five hundred and I didn't see 'all parables.'

The main statistical argument here is that not much in
the notebook was wasted by Bacon. A very high percentage
of it actually landed in the plays. There are 112 notes in Romeo
and Juliet alone which matched line for line would mean every
tenth line was from Bacon's notebook but it's higher than that
because one note can furnish the material for a whole speech.

Well, here is Lynne, fresh from Christmas and Chanukah shopping (they
even have Chanukah presents for dogs now, though I doubt whether the
dogs know that they're Jewish) and finding she is being talked about.
I have usually read the books I mention, Tom. I don't go to Google for
the titles, I have them in my bookshelves. I may go and look up a
quote I half remember--my memory is rather poor lately--but in the
book, not on Google.

However, you'll only see me answering (and suggesting book titles) on
*certain* &quot;obscure or esoteric&quot; topics, the reason being that those
are the topics I am particularly interested in. MOV would be one of
those, particularly with reference to the Jews in Shakespeare's
England. I have the texts and have read them because I've given papers
on the subject. My guess is that you wouldn't find the quote I
mentioned with regard to John Donne and the Jews on Google, but I
might be mistaken. I haven't looked. The quote had stuck in my brain
because Shapiro mentioned it several times, but I still had to check
the actual wording and Shapiro's source as I hadn't read the book in
over two years.

I did make an exception when I gave a list of books and articles that
had to do with _The Tempest_ and Strachey's letter, but I think (or at
least hope) I was very clear at the time that I was passing on a list
compiled by Nina Green on Phaeton. I had read much, but not all, of
the material, and asked for her permission before posting.

Merry Christmas to all you hlas geniuses,

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; assert, or at least to imply, that she's done lots of other research
&gt; that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; she hasn't displayed here, and that we just ought to trust her, and
&gt; that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; perhaps we ought to carry out extensive literature searches prior to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; challenging her on anything she says. Because surely she (like Baker)
&gt; would
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; not say anything _that_ outlandish without having a good reason. That
&gt; also
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; seems to be the way at least some other participants here read
&gt; Elizabeth's
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; posts -- she can do no wrong, it seems (nor, it seemed, could Baker).

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; -- Janice

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Lynne is guilty of the same thing. Mention almost any topic, no matter
&gt; how
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; obscure or esoteric, and she'll pop up with a list of book titles as if
&gt; she
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; had been just perusing them just prior to your mentioning the subject or
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; mention them in a casual way, such as, &quot;It's been a long time, but if my
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; memory serves me ...&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt; But there is a huge qualitative difference. Lynne has never given me
&gt;&gt;&gt; reason to suspect that she has never read the books she mentions. In
&gt;&gt;&gt; stark contrast, the conclusion that Elizabeth has never laid eyes upon
&gt;&gt;&gt; the works that she cites is inescapable.

&gt;&gt; It's just an impression I get. She's remarkably naive if she has read all
&gt;&gt; the books she lists.

&gt; She could scarcely be an Oxfordian without being naïve.

"/>

Well, of course, that's what we Oxfordians say about you
traditionalists all the time also. ;)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; I've done the same thing a time or two in my life (more than a time or two,
&gt;&gt; to be honest). When confronted with something outside my knowledge I've put
&gt;&gt; myself through a marathon boning-up session

&gt; A marathon boning-up session is vastly preferable to Elizabeth's
&gt; marathon boner sessions -- for a particularly amusing and extended
&gt; instance of the latter, see the thread &quot;The anti-Einsteinians&quot; at

&gt;&lt;http://groups.google.com/groups?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;threadm=C0Nj
&gt; 8.7204%24W8.59025%40news.indigo.ie&amp;rnum=1&amp;prev=/groups%3Fq%3Dgroup:humani
&gt; ties.lit.authors.*%2Binsubject:anti-einsteinians%26hl%3Den%26lr%3D%26ie%3
&gt; DUTF-8%26oe%3DUTF-8%26selm%3DC0Nj8.7204%2524W8.59025%2540news.indigo.ie%2
&gt; 6rnum%3D1&gt;.

&gt;&gt; so I could pass myself off as
&gt;&gt; more knowledgable than I really was. With her, though, I get the impression
&gt;&gt; she skipped the cramming session or confined it to reading the introduction.

&gt; Even if true, that's far better than *not* reading even the
&gt; introduction, which is Elizabeth's stock in trade.

"/>

Not usually true. I have neither the time, nor the inclination, nor
the energy, to &quot;bone up&quot; on something especially for hlas. Nor do I
read only introductions to books, although I sometimes read selected
chapters as they contain the material I'm researching for a novel or a
paper.

I do, however, sometimes become interested in something someone has
said here or on the Fellowship boards, and so go and read up on it.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; She is polite, though. I'll give her that.

&gt; True -- at least she does not habitually accuse her interlocutors of
&gt; fraud, racism, mendacity, etc., as Elizabeth does.

"/>

Thank you for that, fellas.

Best wishes,
Very polite Lynne

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I have usually read the books I mention, Tom. I don't go to Google for
&gt; the titles, I have them in my bookshelves. I may go and look up a
&gt; quote I half remember--my memory is rather poor lately--but in the
&gt; book, not on Google.

&gt; However, you'll only see me answering (and suggesting book titles) on
&gt; *certain* &quot;obscure or esoteric&quot; topics, the reason being that those
&gt; are the topics I am particularly interested in. MOV would be one of
&gt; those, particularly with reference to the Jews in Shakespeare's
&gt; England. I have the texts and have read them because I've given papers
&gt; on the subject. My guess is that you wouldn't find the quote I
&gt; mentioned with regard to John Donne and the Jews on Google, but I
&gt; might be mistaken. I haven't looked. The quote had stuck in my brain
&gt; because Shapiro mentioned it several times, but I still had to check
&gt; the actual wording and Shapiro's source as I hadn't read the book in
&gt; over two years.

&gt; I did make an exception when I gave a list of books and articles that
&gt; had to do with _The Tempest_ and Strachey's letter, but I think (or at
&gt; least hope) I was very clear at the time that I was passing on a list
&gt; compiled by Nina Green on Phaeton. I had read much, but not all, of
&gt; the material, and asked for her permission before posting.

&gt; Merry Christmas to all you hlas geniuses,

Well, I'm not sure an apology was in order (and I caught what you'd
said accidentally, because I've been too busy and have read hardly
anything lately), but I accept it most gratefully anyway. Thank you.
Have a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.
