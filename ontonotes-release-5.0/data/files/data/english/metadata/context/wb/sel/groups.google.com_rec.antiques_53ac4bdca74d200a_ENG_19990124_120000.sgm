Frankly, I haven't a clue what your real question is, even though I am an
&quot;AOLer.&quot; I suggest you inquire at any good college or university that has an
art department. They should be able to decipher your question and give you a
good answer.

"/> I'm guessing with this answer so here goes.

The three main types of porcelain are

1 true (hard-paste) porcelain.
2 artificial (soft-paste) porcelain.
3 bone china.

Porcelain was first made in China (in a primitive form during 618-907)
and in the form best known in the West (1279-1368). This true, or
hard-paste, porcelain was made from petuntse, or china stone (a
feldspathic rock), ground to powder and mixed with kaolin (white china
clay). During the firing, at a temperature of about 1,450 C (2,650 F),
the petuntse vitrified, while the kaolin ensured that the object
retained its shape. Attempts by medieval European potters to imitate
this translucent Chinese porcelain led to the eventual discovery of
artificial (soft-paste) porcelain, a mixture of clay and ground glass
requiring a &quot;softer&quot; firing at about 1,200 C( 2,200 F) than hard-paste
porcelain. Although there is a superficial resemblance, artificial
porcelain can generally be distinguished from true porcelain by its
softer body. It can be cut with a file, for example, whereas true
porcelain cannot, and dirt accumulated on an unglazed base can be
removed only with difficulty, if at all, whereas it is easily removed
from true porcelain.

The glaze, originally used to seal a porous pottery body, is used
solely for decoration on hard-paste porcelain, which is nonporous.
When feldspathic glaze and body are fired together, the one fuses
intimately with the other. Porcelain fired without a glaze, called
biscuit porcelain, was introduced in Europe in the 18th century. It
was generally used for figures. In the 19th century biscuit porcelain
was called Parian ware. Some soft-paste porcelains, which remain
somewhat porous, require a glaze. After the body has been fired, the
glaze, usually containing lead, was added and fired to vitrify it.
Unlike feldspathic glaze, it adheres as a relatively thick coating.

Painted decoration on porcelain is usually executed over the fired
glaze. Because painting under the glaze, that is, on a fired, unglazed
body, must be fired at the same high temperature as body and glaze,
many colours would &quot;fire away.&quot; Thus underglaze painting on porcelain
is largely limited to the extremely stable and reliable cobalt blue
found on Chinese blue-and-white wares. Most porcelain colours, called
overglaze, enamel, or low-temperature colours, are painted over the
fired glaze and fired at a much lower temperature.

Did I guess right? :-)

"/> Hi Ronnie, just a note to add to your excellent info on porcelain. My
favourite porcelain mad man, Augustus the strong ,elector of saxony,
built a &quot;Japanese Palace&quot; just to display his 40,000 piece collection
of &quot; China &quot; and kept Alchemists working round the clock to come up with
the secret of true hard paste porcelain. Around 1707 the answer was
found by Ehrenfried Walther and his assistant Johann Bottger ( who
received the lions share of the glory). Back to Augustus the Strong, the
reason for his nick name?, He had fathered over 300 children. Makes you
wonder where he found the time to count his china!
