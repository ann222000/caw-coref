Dear yakkers

Hard on the heels of my first post in a long time, I'm also curious
about something that happened during a brief appearance interpreting
in court for a young (24 year old) defendant a week ago.

My court experience is typically in commercial litigation, with
fairly sophisticated plaintiffs and defendants. This was a criminal
matter of a very unsophisticated nature (we'll just leave it at that,
I think....) The situation was what is called a 'mention' here in
Australia, which I think is probably the American equivalent of an
arraignment.

When the judge said 'how do you plead', and I used the word 答弁　to
interpret him, the accused said 「答弁って」?

So, did I use the wrong word, or is your average young Japanese so
unfamiliar with the legal process? The laddie didn't seem to get 有罪
or 無罪, either.

Regards
Heather Glass

judge asks something along the lines of: 被告人、被告事実を認めるか、認
めないか？

I don't think 答弁 is used in this sense of plead, since it implies that
someone is answering a question, doesn't it? (I don't know, I'm asking.)

有罪 and 無罪 refer to the outcome of the trial, I think (though I'll
defer to others who have courtroom experience).

And yes, the average young Japanese is probably so unfamiliar with legal

In Japan the judge usually says something like:

検察官が今読んだ事実について何か述べることはありますか？ or

被告人、公訴事実について何か述べることはありますか？

I've been interpreting for many years and it's always been one of the two.

Mike,

When the judge asks this, is the defendant expected to make some sort of
statement--such as:

* explain the circumstances or something;
* make a guilty or non-guilty plea/statement of some sort; or
* say something like ありません meaning s/he &quot;pleads guilty&quot; by way of
not having anything to say to counter the charges or あります meaning
s/he &quot;pleads not guilty&quot; by way of having something to say to counter
the charges?

If this appears flippant, I apologize; I'm seriously interested in
knowing.

Regards,

Me too, because what happened is that when the accused said 「答弁っ
て？」I translated that back to the judge, who then re-phrased with
something  like &quot;Have you anything to say about the charge?&quot;, and the
accused said 「気持ちですか」, then with the judge's 'yes' went on to
explain 「全面的に私が悪いと認めています」. When I interpreted that,
the judge announced he would record a plea of guilty.

So, the process was served, but there was obviously either a
perception or an expectation gap between the Australian judge and the
Japanese accused.

If I followed your guide,  Mike, and invited the accused to 'say
something' about the charges, there's a very real possibility that
with the wrong judge in the Australian context, the accused would cop
a reprimand for not just answering the question (he didn't have legal
representation, by the way, so he was travelling blind), or worse if
he kept trying to 'say something', be placed in contempt of court.

The position of a mention in the Australian legal context may be like
起訴認否手続 in Japan I think. In the Australian mention, the accused
is read the charges and given the opportunity to have them dealt with
by the judge there and then by pleading guilty, or have it go to a
full hearing with legal representation if necessary, by pleading not
guilty.

Yes, but it was only a mention, not an actual hearing. If the judge
thought the outcome from the charges would be too significant, or the
case was too complex for the accused to lodge a plea without legal
advice, he would have not asked for a plea, adjourned the matter, and
instructed the accused to get legal advice. Heather Glass

I think that is similar to American court, but I understand that the
defendant can request a public defender at arraignment without entering a
plea (which could be disastrous if the defendant does not understand the
legal system).

By the way, I happened to find the following:

I don't know, but would it have been more understandable to have translated

That's it. The defendant doesn't necessarily have to use the words 有罪
or 無罪 (in fact, I've heard that some defense lawyers specifically
instruct their clients not to utter these words), but he is expected
to make his stance clear. It almost always goes something like this:

Yes, well, if it had been me, I would certainly have requested a
lawyer, who might have then advised me that I admitted guilt and
copped a fine, but asked for no sentence to be recorded. Our young

I suppose, but doesn't that rather presume the accused has committed
the 罪? I know the Japanese system tends to presume guilt until
innocence is proved (tongue in cheek here), but the phrasing ' How do
you plead?' specifically avoids any presumption either way. My
challenge seems to be how to achieve the translation in a manner that
is comprehensible to the Japanese listener, but that does not
compromise the Australian legal niceties.

Has anyone who has been watching any of the many American legal
soapies that also no doubt make their way to Japanese TV sets noticed
how the question gets dubbed, or does the American court ask
something different at an arraignment?

Yes, that is very similar to what often happens here. On a minor offense,
one can often plead guilty to a misdemeanor or other lesser charge and get
off with a fine or probation and not have a felony record.

I'm not sure, but I think the whole point of it is that the defendant stands
accused of a crime. Naturally, there is a presumption of innocence, but the
defendant must still answer the charge and thus has the opportunity to deny
their guilt and plead not guilty.

The defendant could very well answer 認めません or 否認します.

Yes, but the phrasing is only understandable if you realize that the only
two possible answers are &quot;guilty&quot; or &quot;not guilty&quot; (or perhaps nolo
contendere). Even in English, the question &quot;how do you plead?&quot; could elicit
a response along the lines of &quot;I get down on one knee&quot; if a rather cheeky
defendant does not know exactly what is expected of them.

Thanks, Mike; this is what I wanted to know. Hope it's of reference to
others as well.

What's your take on the notion that 「自分の罪を認めますか？」 phrasing?
So you believe that this presumes guilt? Given the semantic breadth of
罪, I don't think it does.

But as your first post illustrates, the usual procedure in a Japanese
court is to refer to the (起訴)事実, not 罪; so in that sense, the above
is moot, isn't it?

(Again, asking out of true curiosity about what the functional
equivalents are.)

Which is where I am getting to, that in legal concept, the Japanese
code-based expectation of the process may well be different from the
Australian common law-based expectation, and that may well have been
why my use of 答弁 and 有罪 and 無罪 really didn't compute for the
young man, quite aside from his being in a situation that would have
been unfamiliar were he in Japan, let alone in Australia.

I think I'm talking in circles, which suggests it's time for me to
say goodnight and retire, perhaps to a clearer head in the morning.

Thank you all for your thoughts on both my threads.

The temptation is to think of 「自分の罪を認めますか？」 as meaning
&quot;Do you acknowledge your crime?&quot;  The English wording presumes
that you have committed a crime, and the only question is whether you
admit having committed it, or are instead denying it.
I do not know whether this Japanese wording has the same connotations.

Similarly with the equation of 事実 = fact.
If something is a fact, then by definition of the word &quot;fact&quot;, it really happened.
But in Japanese legal language it appears that 事実 does not
always mean &quot;fact&quot;.  It sometimes merely stands for a &quot;that &lt;statement&gt;&quot; clause
and might best be translated as as &quot;claim&quot;, &quot;allegation&quot;, &quot;accusation&quot;, etc.

Guidance from the more knowledgeable is welcome.

I think that the English only presumes that the defendant is accused of committing the crime (which is clearly why they are in court in the first place) and the question asks whether or not the defendant wishes to admit their guilt.

I don't think there is any presumption of guilt in the simple question of how one pleads at arraignment.

A presumption of guilt puts the burden of proof on the defense to prove that the accused is innocent. Conversely, a presumption of innocence puts the burden of proof on the prosecution to prove their guilt.

Regardless of this matter of presumption, I think that a very important consideration when asking the defendant how they plead is that they are made very aware of the gravity of answering the question in the affirmative. They must know very clearly that they are admitting their guilt, something that may prove very difficult to retract later. They are not simply acknowledging that they understand the charges or such.

Posing the question in a very clear manner such as that above could avoid subsequent complications such as a defendant not realizing until too late that they had inadvertently plead guilty.

I think that the English [meaning the English wording &quot;Do you acknowledge your crime?&quot;, right?] only presumes that the defendant is accused of committing the crime (which is clearly why they are in court in the first place) and the question asks whether or not the defendant wishes to admit their guilt.

I don't think there is any presumption of guilt in the simple question of how one pleads at arraignment.
[Alan Siegrist]
==UNQUOTE==

Alan, I agree with your last statement:
&quot;How do you plead?&quot; contains no implication that the &quot;you&quot; is guilty of anything.
But I am surprised that two native speakers should disagree about what &quot;acknowledge&quot; means.
Let's consider some similar word-pairs, where A represents a person, and S represents a statement.
(1) &quot;A knows S&quot; implies that S is true.
(2) &quot;A believes S&quot; does not imply that S is true.
(3) &quot;A acknowledges S&quot; implies that S is true.
(4) &quot;A admits S&quot; implies that S is true.

(1) is true, and (2) is true (I think everyone will agree with this.)
(3) is true, sez I; (3) is false, sez you.
(4) is true, sez I.  What say you?
Checking a dictionary to see whether my years-long understanding
of &quot;acknowledge&quot; and &quot;admit&quot; is wrong, I find that these two words
are synonyms of each other. But the dictionary does not clearly answer,
&quot;Can one admit/adknowledge something that is not true?&quot;
I say the answer is no; you, I gather, say the answer is yes.
How would a real linguist, wearing a pith helmet and interacting
with the natives, go about resolving such questions?

I think a more literal English translation of 「自分の罪を認めますか？」
would be &quot;Do you admit your guilt?&quot; or &quot;Do you admit that you are guilty?&quot;
It is a very simple question.

The word 罪 can have many meanings including sin, crime or guilt as in the
combination 有罪 which is clearly the equivalent of &quot;guilty&quot; as in a finding
of guilt.

If asked the question above, the accused is simply being asked whether or
not they are &quot;admitting their guilt&quot; in the crime they are accused of.

Again, I don't think it makes a presumption of guilt. It is a very pointed
question, more like &quot;Did you take the cookies from the cookie jar&quot; rather
than &quot;Do you know what happened to the cookies?&quot;

Certainly, it is not pleasant being accused of a crime, but I don't think
the exact form of the question by which the accused is being asked to plead
&quot;guilty&quot; or &quot;not guilty&quot; will make this any more pleasant.

I think the judge in such situations may clarify the question and make it
more explicit by saying &quot;How do you plead: guilty or not guilty?&quot; (Or is
that just my recollection from crime dramas?) Does this clarification add
any presumption of guilt? I don't think so.

&quot;How do you plead?&quot; in this way.  As others have mentioned, that
wording *could* suggest that guilt has been established, and just be
asking whether I agree.  The careful neutral phrasing in English is
precisely to avoid this possibility.  Now perhaps 答弁 is legal
jargon, but so is the word &quot;plead&quot; in this case.  As an earlier
poster mentioned a more normal response (ie. out of legal context)
would be along the lines of, &quot;On my knees.&quot;  I think despite the
young man's initial confusion that the few moments of discussion with
the judge to clarify what was being asked was actually beneficial and
that especially in the legal situation, it would be wrong to get too
far away from the most literal translation possible.

The cookie jar metaphor:

&quot;Do you admit that you ate the cookies?&quot; is not the same as: &quot;Did you
eat the cookies?&quot;

&quot;Do you recognize your guilt?&quot; is not the same as: &quot;Did you do it?&quot;

The first, admittedly doesn't necessarily imply predetermined guilt;
but could.  The second doesn't recognize a formal legal context.  I
support the original interpretation.  I'm also glad to have learned a
little about Japanese legal tradition.  Thanks all.

I strongly disagree. In this context, 認める means exactly to admit to an
error, wrongdoing or guilt in a crime. It is roughly equivalent &quot;to
recognize&quot; but only when &quot;recognize&quot; is used in a roundabout admission like
&quot;I recognize the fact that I was at fault.&quot;

I do think that there may be a better functional Japanese equivalent for

I can't speak for the Japanese system but the Australian system the initial
appearance is simply to decide whether the matter is contested or not. If
the defendant pleads guilty they are admitting the charge, as set out by the
prosecution. If the person denies the charge they enter a plea of not
guilty.

Not guilty does not mean &quot;I did nothing&quot; - it means &quot;I am not guilty of the
charge as set out&quot;. For example the charge of shoplifting requires that the
prosecution prove that (a) the defendant not only took items from a store
without paying for them, but that (b) at the time of doing so had no such
intention to pay for them.

When it comes time to enter a plea, whether the defendant's case is that
they absentmindedly picked an item up and walked out with paying for it, or
a case of complete mistaken identity, the initial plea is simply &quot;not
guilty&quot;, because neither situation constitutes guilt under the charge in
question.

The exact words used in putting this to a defendant  may vary - &quot;Do you
admit this charge?&quot;, &quot;What do you say to this charge?&quot; but the objective is
the same - the prosecution has charged the defendant with a crime, and the
defendant must say whether they admit the charge or not.

To someone not familiar with the situation they might want to say &quot;Yeah, I
took it, but I didn't mean to...&quot; - but the court is not interested in the
nitty gritty at this preliminary stage - the court just wants to know if you
admit the charge as set out by the prosecution. If you took the item but
meant to pay for it then you do not admit the charge of shoplifting and
should just say &quot;Not guilty&quot;

I can't help but see it as a &quot;flowchart.&quot;  The wordings must foresee the
process.
The answer to the question &quot;how do you plead&quot; determines the next step
of the prescribed action.
So, I'm not sure where we're going by comparing individual words like 罪
/認める/事実 and so on.

I think that for a criminal trial, 公訴事実 is better than 起訴事実. Thus, I
think the best literal equivalents would be:

&quot;Do you admit this charge?&quot; = 公訴事実を認めますか or 罪を認めますか
&quot;What do you say to this charge?&quot; = 被告人、公訴事実について何か述べることは

None of these is exactly &quot;How do you plead?&quot; but as Will mentions, they are
probably functional equivalents thereof and just might serve.

At least, they are probably better than something involving 答弁.

I see we are finally around to Jim Lockhart's initial response several
light years ago.

Isn't the real problem here that we have a Japanese national facing a
non-Japanese legal system, with different rules and assumptions than
those in Japan, and only poor Heather in between to bridge the gap?
What was really needed is someone with legal expertise, good knowledge
of both systems, and the ability to explain that difference in
understandable Japanese terms to the defendant, as well as explaining
to the court in legally competent English the difference in
expectations.

(This is not meant as a criticism of Heather, who was put in a very
difficult if not impossible situation.)

Well thank you, Wataru, but it's even simpler; none of the above
explanations are the proper role of an interpreter. They are,
however, the role of a lawyer, whom the young man did not have, and
as I said at the outset, I am more familiar with commercial
litigation where there are always copious lawyers on hundreds
(sometimes thousands) of dollars an hour providing all those
explanations.

I'm reflecting now on Mika's post, and in particular the manner in
which 「答弁」is used in her reference, and her explanation that it
is used in the Diet. I had noted the political use before the court
appearance, but was still stumped as to what else I could use, so
when my choice confused the accused, by staying faithful to that
confusion, that alerted the judge to the fact that the accused wasn't
understanding and empowered the judge to clarify, which is textbook
interpreter transparency, of course.

Having said that, the more I think about it, the more it seems to me
I could have got away with less confusion by using the simple 「申し立
てる」. For example, 「(公訴事実に対して）どのように申し立てますか」.
I expect I would not have got the ritual response of　有罪 or 無罪,
but listening to cases before ours where other native
English-speaking defendants were unrepresented, 'guilty' or 'not
guilty' were not always the responses the judge got, either. It also
leaves it as open-ended as as 'How do you plead?' and does not seem
to pervert the common law legal presumption that 「自分の罪を認めます
か」worries me about.

Yes, and that is the basic problem I was pointing out. But I don't see
how you can make a complete separation between the role of a lawyer and
the need for the interpreter to be somewhat competent in criminal law,
the different legal customs and practices between cultures, etc.

How about interpreters who work in international diplomacy, for
example? I assume they are not diplomats themselves, but still have to
know enough about diplomacy so as to avoid making embarrassing or
dangerous gaffes in interpreting. Shouldn't the court likewise hire
legal interpreters for criminal court proceedings who have some
cross-cultural understanding of things like pleading?

(I realize I'm asking for an ideal that likely does not exist in a world
of understaffed and overcrowded court systems.)

Agreed, but active explanation is a different task than passive
application of knowledge. As an interpreter, I need to know the
differences so that I can make choices of words that will minimise
the confusion, but not to then step in and explain the confusion.

Don't start me! I have to confess here that one of the reasons I
don't normally do the type of work we are talking about is because of
the pittance that the courts pay. In effect, I've only put my name
down for this sort of stuff recently, because I'm on a fact-finding
mission on behalf of my State professional association. Interpreting
in the court system over here is a dog's breakfast and we are gearing
up to try and effect change.

Of course, along the way, if I gain more knowledge that will improve
my interpreting, it's a bonus.

the Judge and put the Defendant in more trouble. If she says &quot;Guilty&quot; it
would seem to me to be putting words in the Defendant's mouth in a very
difficult situation).

Throwing something out for a translation in an English context, how about,
被告人問われた罪の真否、又は起訴事実、あなたは有罪か無罪かをまず述べよ

(The use of the 貴方 may seem informal, but government offices use it now,
and given that a court is a direct situation, I think it makes the point to
the Defendant directly. Would be interested in what native speakers think).

To Mike, or others who have experience in interpreting in Japan, when the
judge says 被告人、公訴事実について何か述べることはありますか？ Have you
ever had the situation where the Defendant says, &quot;No I do not,&quot; when what he
really means is that he doesn't really have anything to say about the
charges, but is not necessarily admitting them?

It would seem like a possibility that could occur (probably not for a major
offense where there would be a 調書, but maybe for traffic court, even if
disputing a ticket is rare in Japan).

&gt; Interpreter: 被告人、公訴事実について何か述べることはありますか?

&gt; Defendant: いえ　ありません。

&gt; Interpreter: ???? (if she says &quot;No I do not.&quot; That could very well
&gt; irritate the Judge and put the Defendant in more trouble. If she says
&gt; &quot;Guilty&quot; it would seem to me to be putting words in the Defendant's mouth
&gt; in a very difficult situation).
">

That is rather interesting. In this case, I think the interpreter should say
something along the lines of &quot;Your honor, I have nothing to say.&quot; I agree
that the interpreter should definitely not interpret this reply as &quot;guilty.&quot;

This exchange should certainly prompt the judge to ask a more specific
question as to whether the accused wishes to plead guilty or not guilty. I
am not sure if this will irritate the judge, but he or she should realize
that something was lost in the translation and should pursue it further.

I understand that under Australian law, &quot;nolo contendere&quot; (no contest) is
not admissible as a plea. If a defendant refuses to enter a plea, the court
will record a plea of not guilty.

No sane judge in Japan will say this because in Japanese this phrasing
implies that the defendant has committed a crime, is proven guilty,
and as Mark Spahn said the only question remaining is whether the
defendant admits to his involvement or not. And I don't think I've
ever heard a judge use the word 罪 before sentencing (罪状, yes, but not
罪); perhaps the judge is trained to not use the word in order retain
an objective eye (or the appearance thereof).

The defendant is asked to comment only on the *alleged facts*, and as
for the question of 罪を認める/認めない, that's entirely up to the judge(s).

Which reminds me! :) (Really, it just hit me now!) Isn't this kind of
pleading called 罪状認否?

In any case, I think you comment means that Heather's doubts about the
phrase 「自分の罪を認める」 are warranted and valid, whereas my take
that it would not imply guilt was wrong.

Thanks for setting the record straight on that.

And it looks as though 起訴事実 is best rendered as &quot;alleged facts&quot; in
most instances.

Another, related topic I have a question about is how, in Japanese, we
should distinguish between proof and evidence. 証拠 and 証左 are the
words that we see in dictionaries the most, but as far as I can tell, in
(at least non-technical language) both can mean either proof or evidence,
without any really clear demarcation between the two concepts.

In other words, if someone were to say 「あんたがやった証拠ではないか」,
it could justifiably be translated:

1) Isn't this *proof* the you did it?
2) Isn't this *evidence* the you did it?

Even if here &quot;proof&quot; would more likely be right, what about with「お宅が
関与した証拠ではないか」? Isn't 証拠 even more ambiguous?

1) Isn't this *proof* that you were involved?
2) Isn't this *evidence* that you were involved?

Or is it that 証拠 is reserved for &quot;proof&quot; and some other expression
used (e.g., 「『A』が被告人の関与を示唆する」) to refer to mere evidence?

While sympathizing with Jim's question, I wonder what clear
distinctions exist in English between &quot;evidence&quot; and &quot;proof.&quot;

Do we only use &quot;proof&quot; for &quot;valid evidence&quot;? Evidence (material and
circumstantial) is part of the proof? Are the two terms really
distinguished in English?

I would interpret the defendant's reply below as, &quot;I stand mute.&quot;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; Interpreter: 被告人、公訴事実について何か述べることはありますか?

&gt; &gt; Defendant: いえ　ありません。
">

In most American courts, at an arraignment, the defendant is allowed to not
answer anything -- to stand mute -- and the judge or magistrate will enter a
plea of not guilty.

My experience in criminal cases has been limited to interpreting for
businessmen or engineers charged with DUI or DV so I can't speak for every
kind of case but the &quot;I stand mute.&quot; has worked so far.

Sam Spiteri

From The 'Lectric Law Library's Lexicon:

Mute

....In the case of the United States v. Hare, et al., Circuit Court,
Maryland Dist. May 1818, the prisoner standing mute was considered as if he
had pleaded not guilty.

The act of congress of March 3, 1825, has since provided as follows; That if
any person, upon his or her arraignment upon any indictment before any court
of the United States for any offence, not capital, shall stand mute, or will
not answer or plead to such indictment, the court shall, notwithstanding,
proceed to the trial of the person, so standing mute, or refusing to answer
or pleas, as if he or she had pleaded not guilty; and upon a verdict being
returned by the jury, may proceed to render judgment accordingly. A similar
provision is to be found in the laws of Pennsylvania........

In the flavor of English I speak, they are. Evidence only points in the
direction of guilt (or innocence, as the case may be) and is subject to
interpretation; whereas &quot;proof&quot; is evidence that has gone beyond
interpretation and is (at least seen as) irrefutable. That's why it's
evidence that gets laid out before a court and not proof.

And in science, isn't proof evidence that has been verified as being
true?

Or am I really just splitting too many hairs? (Serious question)

In legal terms evidence is what you adduce to prove your case. Evidence has a technical meaning and the rules and laws as to what does and does not constitute evidence are many and complicated.

Proof is a lay term.

Jim Lockhart's remarks about &quot;proof&quot; versus &quot;evidence&quot;
are a spur to try to clarify the difference between them. My attempt:
evidence (of an assertion) = something that supports the assertion
proof (of an assertion) = evidence sufficient to compel belief in the assertion.
(And while we're at it, faith = belief in the absence of proof.)

In pondering Alan Siegrist's remarks, it seems that there are
two classes of verbs that deal with statements, that is,
verbs that when expressed in Japanese can be used with
the quotative particle と :
(1) &quot;know&quot;-like verbs:  know, admit, concede, acknowledge,
own up to, prove, establish
(2) &quot;believe&quot;-like verbs:  believe, think, say, assert, claim, declare,
proclaim, announce.

With a &quot;know&quot;-like verb, the statement must be true.
In order for the statement &quot;I know that my Redeemer liveth&quot;
to be true, one's Redeemer must actually live.
One cannot know a false statement; the meaning of &quot;know&quot;
does not allow such a possibility.
But with a &quot;believe&quot;-like verb, the statement could be false.
&quot;I believe that my Redeemer liveth&quot; can be true even if
one's Redeemer does not live.

My expectation (vulnerable to statistical refutation by a survey)
is that there is little or nor disagreement among native speakers
about which statement verbs are &quot;know&quot;-like and which are
&quot;believe&quot;-like.  Probably a few centuries ago some philosopher
clarified the distinction between these two classes of statement
verbs with far greater clarity than this poor attempt of mine.

So is 認める a &quot;know&quot;-like verb (=admit, acknowledge),
or is it a &quot;believe&quot;-like verb (=declare (one's guilt or innocence))?
My understanding is that it is a &quot;know&quot;-like verb,
but maybe I'm wrong.

Yes, but truth and falsehood are subjective, or at the very least, dependent
on individual context.

really hope it moves to the philosophy phorum.

Mike's words on the 罪 rang so true, although I do not personally have
any court experience. Not to digress again into the philosophy phorum,
but there's something about the words 罪 and &quot;guilty&quot; that are so
different.

Richard Thieme asked:

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Japan, when the
&gt; judge says 被告人、公訴事実について何か述べることはありますか？ Have
you
&gt; ever had the situation where the Defendant says, &quot;No I do
&gt; not,&quot; when what he
&gt; really means is that he doesn't really have anything to say about the
&gt; charges, but is not necessarily admitting them?
">

I found just such a case, which I copy on the bottom.

By the way, it seems like Heather's judge was (in so many words) asking
the defendant to choose one of the two(?) available options, so in
Japanese, it may be something like:
被告人は、この公訴事実を認めますか？
はい＝pleads guilty

If I understand the following quote correctly, in Japan you say:
pleading guilty = 「その通り間違いありません」
not guilty = 事実関係で違うところを指摘したりします。
(As Heather noted, this is probably not a good idea in Australia.)
