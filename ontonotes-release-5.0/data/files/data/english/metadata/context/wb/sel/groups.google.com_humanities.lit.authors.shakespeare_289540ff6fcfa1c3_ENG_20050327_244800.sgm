This sounds interesting. What is the article about?

SKEPTIC magazine, from what I've read of it, is a pretty good
magazine. They seem to spend most of their time debunking many
fanciful theories - about flying saucers, psychic healing etc.

Surely they haven't decided that William Shakespeare's
authorship is such a topic?

They published an article by the guy whose book debunking
anti-Stratfordianism came out recently (and which I ordered), but then
published a letter by Price, and now an article by her. I wonder
what's up. I know very little about the magazine. I think I tried to
interest them in an article on the authorship controversy and got
turned down. Oh, well, they should let one of us respond to Price. I
signed up for a subscription, so will get the issue with her article in
it.

I used to get every issue, but found them kind of shrill, sort of the
lunatic fringe of the skeptics. Skeptical Inquirer is better, in my
opinion.

The editor of Skeptic, though, Michael Shermer, is becoming something of a
celebrity, however - monthly column in Scientific American, TV appearances,
etc.

The tendency will be to try to hear Price out but she will most likely be
shredded in the end.

-----------------------------------------------------------
The Royal Myth of the Da Vinci Code by Tim Callahan

&lt;&lt;The popularity of The Exorcist was owed to its novelty, to its well
researched material on the whole culture of the Roman Catholic church,
and its approach to the subject of demonic possession and exorcism. It
was, of course, a well-crafted work of fiction. But a deeper reason for
the success of The Exorcist is that it tapped into a basic human fear of
mind control from within. Possession would amount to the ultimate
violation of one's integrity, and the paranoid fear that unseen
intelligences have specifically targeted one for such an invasion is
sufficient to override rational objections against its likelihood. The
popularity of The Da Vinci Code likewise owes something to the novelty
of its central idea, the soundness of its supporting research, and the
professional crafting of its plot and characters. However, it also owes
much of its success to the provocative religious theory and mythic theme
at its core. The story opens with the murder of Jacques Sauniere,
curator of the Louvre Museum in Paris late at night at the hands of a
fanatical albino monk. As he is lying fatally wounded in the stomach,
Sauniere tries to think of a way to pass on ?the secret.? The novel's
hero, Robert Langdon, a Harvard professor of religious symbology, is
awakened after midnight by a visitor to his hotel room in Paris. Earlier
in the evening he had given a lecture and slide show on pagan symbolism
hidden in the stones of Chartres Cathedral. The visitor is from the
Judicial Police (the French equivalent of the FBI). He informs Langdon
of the murder of Sauniere, and says that his name was in Sauniere's day
planner. Langdon is wanted for questioning. Before escorting him to the
murder scene at the Louvre, the visitor shows Langdon a photo of the
body. Before he died, Sauniere stripped and lay down on the floor in the
position of a male figure in a famous anatomical drawing by Leonardo Da
Vinci, the Vitruvian Man. He also drew a pentagram on his stomach in his
own blood, and left a bizarre message written in a black light marker
near his body:

13-3-2-21-1-1-8-5
O Draconian devil!
Oh, lame saint!

This, it turns out, is all an elaborate coded message Sauniere had left
for Langdon. However, since Sauniere had originally intended to meet
Langdon earlier in the evening, Captain Bezu Fache of the Judicial
Police has all but concluded that Langdon is the murderer. Meanwhile,
Silas, the murderous albino, has spoken over the phone to a man
identified only as ?the Teacher,? informing him of the success of his
mission. Silas is the devoted follower of Bishop Manuel Aringarosa, and
both men are members of a rabidly militant Catholic organization called
Opus Dei (Latin for ?the Work of God?), bent on destroying a secret
society called the Priory of Sion, founded in 1099. Back at the Louvre,
Fache is irritated by the arrival of the beautiful cryptographer from
the Judicial Police, Sophie Nevue. By an elaborate ruse she secretly
communicates to Langdon that he is the murder suspect and is in danger.
She then proceeds to unravel part of Suaniere's mysterious message. The
numbers, when sequenced from low to high, are a Fibonacci series:
scrambled: 13-3-2-21-1-1-8-5 unscrambled: 1-1-2-3-5-8-13-21 This is
a sequence of numbers created by adding the last two numbers in the
sequence to get the next one. Thus, starting with 1, we get 1 + 0 = 1,
then 1 + 1= 2, then 1 + 2 = 3, etc. This sequential system was invented
by the 13 th -century Italian mathematician Leonardo Fibonacci. Sophie
then reveals to Langdon the final line of the coded message, which Fache
had covered up: ?P.S. Find Robert Langdon.? This is why Fache suspects
Langdon of the murder. However, it turns out that the message Sauniere
left wasn't for the police at all, but for Sophie Nevue: P.S. stands for
Princess Sophie, Sauniere's nickname for her. Sophie is his
granddaughter. Langdon figures out that the rest of
the coded message is an anagram:

O Draconian devil! (Leonardo Da Vinci)
Oh, lame saint (The Mona Lisa)

Sophie also shows him that Fache's men have planted a tracking device
in his jacket. They throw it out the window to make Fache and his men
believe that Langdon has fled the Louvre. With the police gone, Sophie
and Langdon go to where the Mona Lisa is hanging and find another
cryptic black light message scrawled over the protective plexiglass
cover: ?So Dark the Con of Man.? This, it turns out, is another anagram,
leading to another work by Leonardo Da Vinci:

?Madonna of the Rocks? Sauniere, it turns out, was the last of the
leaders of a secret society called the Priory of Sion, of which
Leonardo, among other luminaries, including Isaac Newton, was the Grand
Master. The Priory has been preserving the true religion started by
Jesus and brought to France (then Gaul ) by his wife, none other than
Mary Magdalene. This religion is much more egalitarian than historical
Christianity, and Da Vinci and others were devoted to the sacred
feminine, which was early on excluded by the church. The Priory has also
kept secret the bloodline of Jesus and Mary Magdalene, still in
existence today. This bloodline, it turns out, is also the Holy Grail
(the Grail as the cup of Christ, holding Christ's blood,
being merely symbolic). The reason the society has to keep the bloodline
secret is that the Catholic Church wishes to extinguish it and wipe out
all traces of the rival religion, which it sees as a threat to its
existence. This is why the crazed albino monk from Opus
Dei is out to murder all of the leaders of the Priory. The rest of the
story is a well-balanced mix of a harrowing, protracted chase?in which
the hero and heroine are pursued both by the Judicial Police and the
albino monk?and the gradual unraveling of the Da Vinci Code. It is full
of meanings beneath meanings. For example, the ?P.S.? in Sauniere's
message not only means Princess Sofie, but Priory of Sion as well. The
book is an excellent read, its intricate plot twists and rich historical
background putting it well above most books of this genre. However,
readers may reasonably ask: Is any of it true? The Priory of Sion, the
author states, is a real organization, a European secret society founded
in 1099, and Leonardo Da Vinci was a member. This was discovered in 1975
when certain parchments, known as Les Dossiers Secrets, were discovered
in the Bibliotheque Nationale in Paris . As to whether this society
still exists or not, we cannot say. Secret societies such as the
Rosecrucians and the Freemasons flourished at the end of the Middle
Ages, each of them claiming knowledge of secret wisdom hidden from all
but the initiates. The Freemasons, for example, though coming into
existence late in the Middle Ages, claim to have been founded
by Hyram, the Phoenician architect hired by King Solomon to build the
Temple . He passed on to his followers secret knowledge from ancient
Egypt . Beyond all this hocus pocus, however, such secret fraternities
were quite important in societies in which one could be put to death for
espousing heretical religious or political views. Within the Masonic
Lodges one could speak freely. In fact, most of America 's revolutionary
leaders, including George Washington, were Masons. Opus Dei is also a
real organization, a deeply pious and conservative group within the
Roman Catholic church. It has been involved in controversy over its use
of corporal mortification and accusations against it of coercion and
brainwashing. ?Corporal mortification? can run a gamut of anything from
fasting, celibacy, and sleeping on hard surfaces, on one , to
self-flagellation and like practices on the other. The growing power of
Opus Dei, along with other reactionary trends in the Catholic church at
this time, are disheartening to those of us who would like to see a
softening of certain doctrines such as condemnation of artificial birth
control and refusal to ordain women. However, Opus Dei hasn't been
accused, to my knowledge, of such skullduggery as assassination. To his
credit Dan Brown portrays the group as being duped by the ?Teacher,? the
real arch-villain of the book. Now we come to the meat of the matter:
Did Jesus and Mary Magdalene have a sexual relationship? Is there a
living bloodline descended from Jesus and Mary? Is the Grail legend part
of this? First, let's deal with Mary Magdalene. Tradition has it that
she was a prostitute reformed by Jesus. The problem here is that this is
entirely an extra biblical account. Our earliest introduction to Mary is
in Luke 8:1, 2: Soon afterward he went on through cities and
villages, preaching and bringing the good news. And the twelve were with
him, and also some women who had been healed of evil spirits and
infirmities: Mary, called Magdalene, from whom seven demons had gone
out, and Joanna, the wife of Chuza, Herod's steward, and Susanna and
many others, who provided for them out of their means. This immediately
follows a story in Luke 7 that while Jesus is preaching in the city of
Capurnum a Pharisee named Simon invites him to his house. While he is
there a woman comes in who is a sinner and starts weeping, wetting
Jesus' feet with her tears, wiping them with her hair
and anointing them with ointment. Jesus tells her that her faith has
saved her and to go in peace. The word translated as sinner is
hamartolos in the original Greek, a word related to hamartia, the Greek
concept of a fatal flaw. It is only by implication that this woman is
identified as a prostitute, and only by unfortunate textual
juxtaposition that ...

So, here's the story on the Skeptic Magazine article.

Two years ago, Scott McCrea published an article in (Vol 9, #4), which
demonstrated that the education available to Shakespeare in Stratford was
sufficient to explain the learning seen in the plays; the focus was
relatively narrow. I remember reading this article and finding it quite
reasonable. Subsequent issues published a few letters in response. As I
recall these came from nominal skeptics - people who explicitly rejected the
plausibility of ghosts, alien autopsies, etc. based on the pure lack of
evidence - but who were inclined to accept the plausibility of the
anti-Stratford case. I recall drafting a letter pointing out the inherent
implausibility of the anti-Stratford case, but I don't think I ever sent it
... certainly it was not published if I did. I haven't been reading the
magazine regularly for a year or so, so I don't know if the argument has
continued.

Now (Vol 11, #3; the issue is on the newsstands now), Price presents
arguments, very familiar to us, such as the lack of a &quot;contemporary literary
trail&quot;. As with the letter writers, she argues that doubting Shakespeare's
authorship is a reasonable skeptical position to take.

In my opinion she can only make this case by ignoring the context of the
evidence, as was true with her book. But making cases like this is not my
forte. I'd like to suggest to Mssrs Kathman and Reedy that they read the
article and consider sending a response to Price's article. We skeptics
like to think we have open minds, and I think the superficial plausibility
of Price's arguments, unrefuted, will appeal to those who don't have the
full picture.

But they are completely implausible, even at the superficial level. Her
completely arbitrary 1 year cutoff time for memorial notices is my
favorite example. As with most antiStrat arguments, it relies on an
artificial construct, a fantasy world in which people behave and
society functions in a certain way just to support the argument.

Editor: Your readers were really scammed by Diana Price's article in
the Vol. 11 No. 3 issue of SKEPTIC. This article has been cleverly
written with weasel words, half-truths, etc., to support her
pre-conceived idea that there is no evidence from Shakespeare's lifetime
that shows he was a writer. Here is just one example: She claims on p.15
that the famous 1592 reference to the &quot;Upstart Crow who pretends to be
able to bombast out a blank verse&quot; shows that Shakespeare is an actor.
But &quot;to bombast out&quot; in Elizabethan English meant &quot;to fill out&quot; or &quot;to
pad out.&quot; (Literally, it comes from &quot;cotton stuffing.&quot;) It's what poets
did in those days when they wrote lines to fit the required meter. It
had nothing to do with speaking, shouting, etc., like it does today. Any
Shakespearean or Elizabethan reference work will confirm this; it is not
controversial. Yet Price must use the modern meaning to justify her
theory, and must hope that no one will notice. There's other evidence
that Shakespeare was referred to as a writer in his lifetime, but I
charge for that. Incidentally, the desire to &quot;prove&quot; that Shakespeare
was not a writer is an attempt to ward off deeply buried feelings of
inadequacy; by belittling a great person one can elevate the self. Also,
by substituting a nobleman for the strictly middle-class Shakespeare,
today's Joe Blow can be admittedly less than Shakespeare, but still
great. Sincerely, -- Joe Mulligan

Yes, she even begins her essay with a lie: &quot;The Shakespeare authorship
question is over 400 years old.&quot;

This is 2005, so let's see . . . 2005 . . . take away 400 . . . that means
the &quot;authorship question&quot; began before 1605.

She sets up a straw man argument by claiming that the three &quot;ironclad pieces
of biographical evidence&quot; that scholars use to argue Shakespeare's
authorship are the will, the monument and the folio.

She brings in her writer's filter, and makes points such as &quot;The will does
not specify any literary effects, either, such as manuscripts or books, so,
again, it can't be used to prove that Shakespeare was a writer,&quot; as if
mention of literary effects were proof of anything.

Her arguments are for the most part logical non sequiturs that she says
indicate contemporary commentary about Shakespeare is contradictory or
ambiguous. She also hauls out the old argument that Shakespeare left behind
no receipts for payment for writing plays, didn't write commendatory verses
for other writers, and had no patrons, but she neglects to mention the fact
that he was an active sharer in an extremely successful acting company, and
therefore didn't need those revenue sources.

She demonstrates the antiStratfordian habit of speculating and then building
an entire society around that speculation as if it were true.

In short, same old shit.

You know, at one time I used to think that antiStratfordians knew they were
using such dishonest arguments, but did it anyway. That was before I noticed
that while some of them are maybe a bit brighter than the average person,
none of them are what you would call brilliant, so now I don't think they're
being dishonest. Diana Price's essay is pretty good evidence--as her book
was--that she really isn't all that bright. As C.M. Kornbluth would say, the
morons march on to inevitable majority.

Diana Price is making money by dishonestly representing
the Shakespeare family. Diana thinks she looks good by
making them look bad.

Check Diana's filter out. We know Susanna owned books,
sold some of her books but not all of them, had books
stolen from her property, and was married to a highly
literate writer and physician. Diana calls Susanna illiterate
but Diana's own device indicates Susanna has evidence
of being a writer!

Ever watch a child lie his or her way into an impossible
situation? You can watch a hypocrite contradict herself
by reading Diana Price. She is hellbent on hurting
Shakespeare and she throws away her integrity to
accomplish this nasty agenda.

The reason she shies from HLAS is because she's
been called out here and can't justify her own beliefs.

The very fact that she is intent on destroying a man's
reputation shows how low her motives are. She needs
evidence--and all her Rumsfeldesque reasoning adds
up to nothing.

She is just a mean old lady and she is trying to live off
Shakespeare. He survived plague and puritanism,
so he will have no trouble surviving her.

I guess I better buy Skeptic and see if she's
improved her methods.

(1) Non Sanz Droict” [not without right] was never used by shakespeare
or his family.
(2) The 'motto' is likel;y not a motto at all but a rejection of an
application.
(3) &quot;not without right&quot; is associated with shakespeares coat of arms
only because it is recorded on an application form at the college of
heralds. There was no public access to application forms at the college
of heralds. Therefore there was no public association between
shakespeares 'motto' and sogliardos.
(4) The source of sogliardos motto is properly traced to nashes pierce
penniless.
(5) Sogliardos coat of arms does not resemble shakespeares.
(6) Shakespears company produced EMOOHH, it is highly unlikely that the
leading member of a company would allow a play, that viciously parodied
him, to be produced. Nor is it likely that bhis fellow actors would be
willing to act in such a production.

Jonson portrays Sogliardo (&quot;filth&quot;)as &quot;ill-educated, ignorant,
pretentious, conceited and gullible&quot;. These are all traits that
antistrats are keen to push on will shakespeare of stratford. It is no
wonder then that they are so keen to identify him with jonsons
character. That identification is, of course, merely a case of prejudice
writ large.

Joe, you're basically right on &quot;bombast&quot;, but the OED does show about an
equal number of references to both written and spoken bombast in that era.
My point was that Price ignores the context of the era (as you say in a
different way) and presents only her intertpretation - that bombast =
extemporaneous speech.

&gt; Editor: Your readers were really scammed by Diana Price's article in

&gt; written with weasel words, half-truths, etc., to support her
&gt; pre-conceived idea that there is no evidence from Shakespeare's lifetime
&gt; that shows he was a writer. Here is just one example: She claims on p.15
&gt; that the famous 1592 reference to the &quot;Upstart Crow who pretends to be
&gt; able to bombast out a blank verse&quot; shows that Shakespeare is an actor.
&gt; But &quot;to bombast out&quot; in Elizabethan English meant &quot;to fill out&quot; or &quot;to
&gt; pad out.&quot; (Literally, it comes from &quot;cotton stuffing.&quot;) It's what poets
&gt; did in those days when they wrote lines to fit the required meter. It
&gt; had nothing to do with speaking, shouting, etc., like it does today. Any
&gt; Shakespearean or Elizabethan reference work will confirm this; it is not
&gt; controversial. Yet Price must use the modern meaning to justify her
&gt; theory, and must hope that no one will notice. There's other evidence
&gt; that Shakespeare was referred to as a writer in his lifetime, but I
&gt; charge for that. Incidentally, the desire to &quot;prove&quot; that Shakespeare
&gt; was not a writer is an attempt to ward off deeply buried feelings of
&gt; inadequacy; by belittling a great person one can elevate the self. Also,
&gt; by substituting a nobleman for the strictly middle-class Shakespeare,

I know that WE know all this stuff ... I do think that her case, as
presented in Skeptic, might carry some weight with that magazine's readers.
They tend to be more science-minded, for one thing, and won't be as familar
with the norms of literary scholarship, not with the quality of evidence we
have from the Renaissance. They like to keep an open mind (or think they
do) and may find this an attractive topic. To them, it won't appear as
cut-and-dried as the lunar-landing-hoax or creationism (and it's not,
really), so they may give it more consideration than it deserves.

On the other hand, they're sort of an influential bunch. Schermer and (the
Amazing) Randi are very good at self-promotion (in a good cause, I should
say). The readers tend to be very activist in their communities. It would
be good to have them on the right side of the argument.

I think a letter or article from a qualified expert would be a good thing.
Since that doesn't appear to be forthcoming, I'll give it a shot.

&gt; This is 2005, so let's see . . . 2005 . . . take away 400 . . . that means
&gt; the &quot;authorship question&quot; began before 1605.

&gt; She sets up a straw man argument by claiming that the three &quot;ironclad
pieces
&gt; of biographical evidence&quot; that scholars use to argue Shakespeare's
&gt; authorship are the will, the monument and the folio.

&gt; She brings in her writer's filter, and makes points such as &quot;The will does
&gt; not specify any literary effects, either, such as manuscripts or books,
so,
&gt; again, it can't be used to prove that Shakespeare was a writer,&quot; as if
&gt; mention of literary effects were proof of anything.

&gt; Her arguments are for the most part logical non sequiturs that she says
&gt; indicate contemporary commentary about Shakespeare is contradictory or
&gt; ambiguous. She also hauls out the old argument that Shakespeare left
behind
&gt; no receipts for payment for writing plays, didn't write commendatory
verses
&gt; for other writers, and had no patrons, but she neglects to mention the
fact
&gt; that he was an active sharer in an extremely successful acting company,
and
&gt; therefore didn't need those revenue sources.

&gt; She demonstrates the antiStratfordian habit of speculating and then
building
&gt; an entire society around that speculation as if it were true.

&gt; In short, same old shit.

&gt; You know, at one time I used to think that antiStratfordians knew they
were
&gt; using such dishonest arguments, but did it anyway. That was before I
noticed
&gt; that while some of them are maybe a bit brighter than the average person,
&gt; none of them are what you would call brilliant, so now I don't think
they're
&gt; being dishonest. Diana Price's essay is pretty good evidence--as her book
&gt; was--that she really isn't all that bright. As C.M. Kornbluth would say,

Filter (mathematics) (From Wikipedia, the free Encyclopedia)

A filter F on a set S is a set of subsets of S with the following
properties:

S is in F.
The empty set is not in F.
If A and B are in F, then so is their intersection.
If A is in F and A ? B ? S, then B is in F.

A simple example of a filter is the set of all subsets of S that include a
particular subset C of S. Such a filter is called the &quot;principal filter&quot;
generated by C. The Fréchet filter on an infinite set S is the set of all
subsets of S that have finite complement.
Filters are useful in topology: they play the role of sequences in metric
spaces. The set of all neighbourhoods of a point x in a topological space is
a filter, called the neighbourhood filter of x. A filter which is a superset
of the neighbourhood filter of x is said to converge to x. Note that in a
non-Hausdorff space a filter can converge to more than one point.

Of particular importance are maximal filters, which are called ultrafilters.
A standard application of Zorn's lemma shows that every filter is a subset
of some ultrafilter.

For any filter F on a set S, the set function defined by

is finitely additive -- a &quot;measure&quot; if that term is construed rather
loosely. Therefore the statement
can be considered somewhat analogous to the statement that ? holds &quot;almost
everywhere&quot;. That interpretation of membership in a filter is used (for
motivation, although it is not needed for actual proofs) in the theory of
ultraproducts in model theory, a branch of mathematical logic.
Filters as described above are subsets of a particular lattice, namely the
power set of S. Filters can be also be defined in other lattices - see
lattice for details.

I disagree. It has all the earmarks of crank conspiracy theory. Price's
talent is that she tries to turn it into a rational quest for the truth.
Notice her technique at the end of the article, when she tries to identify
antiStratfordians with rational skeptics: &quot;Anyone who assumes that
Shakespeare was a playwright . . . [but] a skeptic asks why . . . [blah blah
blah.]&quot;

Price, however deficient in logic and good sense she may be, is as good a
propagandizer as Eddie Bernays or Walter Lippmann, and it is them with whom
she must be compared, rather than true scholastics.

Exactly.

A witness is defined as 'someone with direct knowledge,
that is, someone who saw something occur.

It doesn't matter how old the testimony is as long
as the witness is mentally sound when called upon to

Here is an example of how you &quot;beat&quot; Diana Price:

Her favorite example of a caricature of &quot;Shakspere&quot; is the
laughingstock Sogliardo in Ben Jonson's Every Man Out of His Humour
[68-77]. This figure she takes to be virtually a portrait from life,
freely imputing his traits to the Stratford man. Sogliardo is
ill-educated, ignorant, pretentious, conceited and gullible. So
&quot;Shakspere&quot; must be all of those, to which Miss Price gratuitously
adds the faults of Sogliardo's grain speculator brother and
fashion-obsessed son.

Her chief justification for equating Sogliardo and &quot;Shakspere&quot; is
one to which she recurs frequently: &quot;Orthodox&quot; Shakespeareans have
made the same connection; hence, the &quot;orthodox&quot; cannot reasonably
reject it. By &quot;orthodox&quot;, however, Miss Price means no more than
someone who has not questioned the Stratfordian position. By that
criterion, 99-plus percent of all writers about Shakespeare are
&quot;orthodox&quot;. Necessarily, then, about 99 percent of all of the
nonsense ever written about the Bard must emanate from &quot;orthodox&quot;
sources. To find an &quot;orthodox&quot; quotation to support any opinion is
no great feat. What Miss Price never does is evaluate the credibility
of her &quot;orthodox&quot; authorities or weigh them against those (usually
much larger in number) who hold contrary views.

In the case of Sogliardo, Miss Price cites one &quot;orthodox&quot; source,
the anti-anti-Stratfordian writer H. N. Gibson (who was an able
polemicist but an amateur scholar2) and unnamed biographers. The only
specific reason that these sources present for linking Sogliardo to
Shakespeare is that the former is portrayed as the grantee of a
coat-of-arms with the motto &quot;Not Without Mustard&quot;, while
Shakespeare had, a year before the play was produced, received his own
arms, supposedly graced with the motto &quot;Non Sanz Droict&quot; (&quot;Not
Without Right&quot;).

This reasoning convinces Miss Price. She does not observe, though the
fact is stated a work that she cites frequently,3 that Every Man Out of
His Humour was written for the Lord Chamberlain's Men and staged at
the Globe Theatre. William Shakespeare was a major shareholder in the
company and part-owner of the theater. If he was the object of
Jonson's satire, and was the kind of man that Miss Price believes him
to have been, how peculiar that he would have allowed an attack on his
own character to go forward at his own expense.

Moreover, Miss Price herself has, just a few pages earlier, shown why
Sogliardo's motto would not have called &quot;Shakspere&quot; to the
audience's mind. &quot;Non Sanz Droict&quot; was never in fact used as a
motto by Shakespeare or his family [70]. &quot;Not Without Mustard&quot;, an
old joke that Jonson had cribbed from Thomas Nashe [70-71], could not
have been directed at a phrase whose association with &quot;Shakspere&quot;,
if any, was buried in the archives of the College of Heralds.

Comment:

Your parting shot is predicated on your ASSUMPTION that the &quot;Non sanz
droict&quot; motto and &quot;Not Without Mustard&quot; did not issue from the SAME pen
- that of Ben Jonson.

ASSUME otherwise - and your parting shot is a dud.

I readily agree that, *if* Ben Jonson wrote the works of Thomas Nashe
and *if* the routine court and legal records representing William
Shakespeare of Stratford as a sharer in the Lord Chamberlain's Men and
part-owner of the Globe Theatre were forged, then my criticisms lose
some of their force. I doubt, however, that those suppositions are
credible to anyone but you. (Well, Brame and Popova might believe the
first in a sense, since they think that the Earl of Oxenford wrote
practically everything.) I'm quite certain that Diana Price won't rely
on them, should she ever get around to defending herself.

The point of the exercise AFAIR was to do a
comparative exercise, and that would not be
practicable under your proposal. Besides
which, how would anyone establish who knew
the author 'Shakespeare' and who merely
claimed to have done so? There were plenty
of probable fraudsters -- such as Davenant.
He may have known of the strawman nature
of the Stratman, or guessed it, or just chanced
his arm and turned out lucky.

There is no other supposedly famous person,
in whole of English history, about whom so
little is known. No one ever remarks upon the
comments of another on the subject of Shake-
speare. No one ever seems to be remotely
likely to be in position to do so. The silence
is deafening. Yet Strats do not perceive it.

Teapot-tempests, both literary (Groatsworth of Wit) and bureaucratic
(the Stratfordian's coat of arms), have served to ensure that
associated aspects of the Stratfordian's 'houre vpon the stage'
continue to draw our attention.

Of the former, Schoenbaum wrote that it was attended by &quot;so many
ambiguities and perplexities&quot; that &quot;one can sympathize with the
exasperation voiced by one distinguished commentator in this century.
'This passage from Greene has had such a devastating effect on
Shakespearian study', [he] complains, 'that we cannot but wish it had
never been written or never discovered.'&quot; (A Compact Documentary Life,
p. 157)

As for the latter - which relates directly to your point - Schoenbaum
wrote:

&quot;Preserved at the College [of Arms] are two rough drafts of a document
dated 20 October 1596 and prepared by Sir William Dethick, Garter
King-of-Arms, granting the request of John Shakespeare for a coat of
arms. A note at the foot of one of these drafts describes 'This John'
as having received a 'pattern' on paper 'under Clarent Cook's hand...xx
years past'. THAT is how we know of the earlier application.&quot; (p. 228)

In 'Will in the World', Stephen Greenblatt does not mention THAT, but
takes the &quot;note&quot; in question at face value and then picks up the story
- AND embroiders it - as follows:

&quot;Decades later, in October 1596, the process was renewed. The OLD
sketch - &quot;Gould. On A Bend Sables, a Speare of the first steeled
argent [...]&quot; - was pulled off the shelf, where it had gathered dust;
once again, John Shakespeare's claim was reviewed and, this time round
approved. Who reinstituted the application, provided the necessary
information, and paid the fees [...]? ... The OBVIOUS answer is
William, already propsering handsomely in the London theatre.&quot; (p. 78)

Why obvious? Why not some third party?

The third-party alternative would necessarily imply that SOMETHING was
afoot with the coat-of-arms application and the attendant 1602
teapot-tempest.

Given the modus operandi of the creators of the Shakespeare Drama, that
something SHOULD have been 'documented' in a form which future students
of the matter could reconstruct from the record - as in the following:

1. The Cipher Value of the Stratfordian OF RECORD's 'Houre Vpon The
Stage' is 35662, as noted earlier.

2. IF the Stratfordian OF RECORD was a fictional character symbolizing
Microcosmic MAN-Beast alias Creation in Time and Space (Cipher Value
4627 as also noted earlier), THEN his 'passing' would mark End of the
World/Globe/Creation in Time and Space as in - 4627.

3. As in 10230 + 11156 + 345 - 4000 + 216 + 10805 - 4627 + 7933 + 2008
+ 1596 = 35662, where

10230 = 'Pure Elementall Wit';

11156 = 'Christopher Marlow';

345 = Triangle 3:4:5 as 'foundation' of MAN-Beast's Psyche;

- 4000 = Brownswerd (Beast aspect);

216 = Psyche's Resurrection symbolized by 3:4:5 raised to the third
power, as in 27 + 64 + 125 = 216;

10805 = Sweet Swan of Avon (MAN aspect);

- 4627 = End of The World;

7933 = Non Sanz Droict or Non, Sanz Droict;

2008 and 1596 = October 20, 1596.

'Christopher Marlow' and 'Pure Elementall Wit' are terms used by Thomas
Thorpe with respect to Christopher Marlowe in a 1600 Preface to
Marlowe's translation of 'Lucan's First Booke' - the 'Marlovian' heresy
may have been around longer than Stratfordian Fundamentalists suspect!

4. As also in 8110 - 4000 + 4589 - 1000 + 12735 - 4627 + 7933 + 11922
= 35662, where

8110 = Shakespear ye Player (text on 1602 sketch);

- 4000 = Brownswerd;

4589 = Sogliardo;

- 1000 = Darkness (of Ignorance);

12735 = Not Without Mustard;

- 4627 = End of the World.

7933 = Non Sanz Droict or Non, Sanz Droict; and

11922 = Ex malis moribus bonæ leges (From the death of Evil comes a
legacy of Good - motto for Emblem # 34 in 'Minerva Britanna', where Sir
Francis Bacon, Knight is depicted killing a serpent writhing on the
ground with a rod, as in the Rod of Moses?)

The odds against these three variations on the Stratfordian's 'houre
vpon the stage' being fortuitous would seem to be prohibitive.

P.S. Might &quot;This JOHN&quot; allude to the 'hand' of Cosmic Creative Power
alias Penis, 2801?

The &quot;note&quot; associates the 'hand' with Clarent Cook, 5785 as in 2801 +
5785 = 8586, as in 1000 + 3586 + 4000 = 8586, where

1000 = Light of the World;

3586 = Murder; and

4000 = Flaming Sword.

The imagery concerns Sol INVICTUS, 7645, whose 'murder' upon Sol's
incarnation in the 'seat' of Man's Lower Emotions/Anus is a temporary
thing, as in 7645 - 4000 + 7936 - 1000 + 10805 = 21386,

where 'Pure Elementall Wit', 10230, and 'Christopher Marlow', 11156 as
in 10230 + 11156 = 21386 are mirrored in:

7645 = Sol Invictus;

- 4000 = Brownswerd;

7936 = Edward Oxenford (whose mythical 'buggery' is construed as gospel
truth by his detractors);

- 1000 = Darkness (of Ignorance); and

10805 = Sweet Swan of Avon

Perhaps not, but as we don't have anything close to a perfect

Probably not a rejection.

A while back, I consulted with the folks at rec.heraldry on this.

From Francios R. Velde:

I can't answer the precise question, but a priori I find the
interpretation implausible. When an applicant submits a
request for a grant of arms, there is no possible notion
that he has a &quot;right&quot; to anything. Kings of arms were
authorized to grant arms to those they saw fit, as an exercise
of the royal prerogative. If the matter came up in a visitation,
that's something else: then the claimant would be claiming that
he had a right to use those arms (by virtue of a prior grant,
or &quot;immemorial usage&quot;), and the heralds would agree or not.
But IIRC that is not the context for Shakespeare's case, which
was a straightforward grant.

Were the heralds even using French? I don't think they did for
16th c. grants and visitations.

Derek Howard(also on rec.heraldry) informed me that the
consensus among heraldry experts is that it was intended
to be the motto.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; (3) &quot;not without right&quot; is associated with shakespeares coat of arms
&gt; only because it is recorded on an application form at the college of
&gt; heralds. There was no public access to application forms at the college
&gt; of heralds. Therefore there was no public association between
&gt; shakespeares 'motto' and sogliardos.

"/>

The odds are fairly good that some people beside John and William
Shakespeare and the Herald reviewing the document knew of the motto.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; (4) The source of sogliardos motto is properly traced to nashes pierce
&gt; penniless.

"/>

Indeed.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; (5) Sogliardos coat of arms does not resemble shakespeares.

"/>

Not in the slightest. Nor is there, as far as I know, any visible
correspondence to the other known facts of William Shakespeare's
life. (Caveat: Pat Dooley claimed on HLAS that the fact that
Sogliardo had been a morris dancer was a parallel to Shakespeare
having been an actor. Some may take that more seriously than I did.)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; (6) Shakespears company produced EMOOHH, it is highly unlikely that the
&gt; leading member of a company would allow a play, that viciously parodied
&gt; him, to be produced.

"/>

One could suppose that Jonson foisted on the company
during one of Shakespeare's absences. After all,
William Shakespeare doesn't appear on the cast list.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Nor is it likely that bhis fellow actors would be
&gt; willing to act in such a production.

"/>

Right. Either they didn't understand that it was
a vicious parody or it wasn't a vicious parody.
We certainly don't have any contemporary comment
indicating that anyone took it to be a vicious
parody.

It is worth noting that the text of the play we have
is not necessarily the text that was performed.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; wonder then that they are so keen to identify him with jonsons

&gt; writ large.

"/>

The root of their prejudice appears to be the perception
that an unworthy fellow stole the plays from the rightful
owner. It would have been a foul deed, if it were true.

I note with interest my feeling towards anti-Stratfordians
which appears to be colored by the fact that, based upon what I
have generally found to be extremely inferior evidence, they
wish to take the credit for writing the plays from William
Shakespeare and give it to someone else.

&lt;&lt;The Motto: &quot;Non Sanz Droict&quot; (being the Norman-French for

motto of William Shakespeare, ... the county's most famous son.

It suggests the authority of the County Council.

The &quot;three cross-crosslets gules on the chief or&quot; in the county's
arms are taken from the arms of the BEAUCHAMPS, who were earls
of Warwick from 1268 to 1449. They are perhaps the most famous
of all the families which have held the earldom of Warwick.

Note that the bear should be muzzled &amp; CHAINED

MONTAGUES and the Crusades, ~1095-~1588

&lt;&lt;The Montague family had a long crusading tradition.
Cristopher Tyerman, in England and the Crusades,
1095-1588, notes the following:

&quot;M.H. Keen has demonstrated the lively and persistent interest in
crusading of a number of noble families, including the BEAUCHAMPS,
Uffords, Bohuns, Percies, DESPENSERS, FitzWalters, Beaumonts,
Scropes, Courtenays, and MONTAGUES.&quot; (Tyerman, pp. 268)

Some signs of Montague crusading tradition can apparently still
be found in Turkey, where one of the seven ancient wonders
of the world was dismantled to construct a last-ditch defense,
the Castle of St. Peter at Bodrum.

&quot;... the Knights (these would be the Hospitallers, ed.), having
lost their stronghold ... to Timur the Lame (&quot;Tamurlane&quot;,) in 1402, were
establishing a new base at Bodrum, the site of the ancient Halicarnassus
and its famous Mausoleum, stone from which was used in the construction
of the Christian fortress dedicated to St. Peter. This fortress was to
act not simply as a military post, but also as a refuge for fugitive
Christians from the Ottoman Empire. ...

The castle of St. Peter itself provides more striking witness to English
participation. Over the gateway to one of its towers, known as the
English Tower, twenty-six coats of arms were set up in stone, including
those of Henry IV, the Prince of Wales, the dukes of Clarence, Bedford,
and Gloucester (the kings sons), the duke of York, and the families of
Grey, Zouche, de la Pole, NEVILLE, Percy, Holland, BEAUCHAMP,
Burleigh, STRANGE, Arundel, MONTAGUE, Stafford, DE VERE,
Courtenay, FitzHugh, Cresson, WOOLFE, &amp; FAIRFAX,
many of who could boast of both long
and recent crusading traditions.&quot; (Tyerman, pp. 313-314)&gt;&gt;

&gt;&gt; So, here's the story on the Skeptic Magazine article.

&gt;&gt; Two years ago, Scott McCrea published an article in (Vol 9, #4), which
&gt;&gt; demonstrated that the education available to Shakespeare in Stratford was
&gt;&gt; sufficient to explain the learning seen in the plays; the focus was
&gt;&gt; relatively narrow. I remember reading this article and finding it quite
&gt;&gt; reasonable. Subsequent issues published a few letters in response. As I
&gt;&gt; recall these came from nominal skeptics - people who explicitly rejected
&gt; the
&gt;&gt; plausibility of ghosts, alien autopsies, etc. based on the pure lack of
&gt;&gt; evidence - but who were inclined to accept the plausibility of the
&gt;&gt; anti-Stratford case. I recall drafting a letter pointing out the inherent
&gt;&gt; implausibility of the anti-Stratford case, but I don't think I ever sent
&gt; it
&gt;&gt; ... certainly it was not published if I did. I haven't been reading the
&gt;&gt; magazine regularly for a year or so, so I don't know if the argument has
&gt;&gt; continued.

&gt;&gt; Now (Vol 11, #3; the issue is on the newsstands now), Price presents
&gt;&gt; arguments, very familiar to us, such as the lack of a &quot;contemporary
&gt; literary
&gt;&gt; trail&quot;. As with the letter writers, she argues that doubting
&gt; Shakespeare's
&gt;&gt; authorship is a reasonable skeptical position to take.

&gt;&gt; In my opinion she can only make this case by ignoring the context of the
&gt;&gt; evidence, as was true with her book. But making cases like this is not my
&gt;&gt; forte. I'd like to suggest to Mssrs Kathman and Reedy that they read the
&gt;&gt; article and consider sending a response to Price's article. We skeptics
&gt;&gt; like to think we have open minds, and I think the superficial plausibility
&gt;&gt; of Price's arguments, unrefuted, will appeal to those who don't have the
&gt;&gt; full picture.
