I see appliances being sold now that lack UL or CSA approval markings
and instead are only ETL certified.

How good is ETL certification compared to those from UL and CSA?

Does ETL require actual sample products to be submitted for testing, or
are they like CE and let manufacturers work on the honor system (I have
a CE approved multimeter rated for use at up to 500V, but its fuses are
rated for only 250V, unlike a UL-approved Fluke).

Are coffee makers required to be made of fire resistant plastic by any
of the safety certification organizations? If so, which ones?

I'm asking all this because I noticed that an ETL-approved drip coffee
maker had only a bimetal thermostat to turn off the current while an
older UL-approved coffee maker also had two thermal fuses in series..

In the late 80's law was passed to allow other than specification writing
agencies to do testing to specifications such as UL

See  http://www.labconco.com/company/standards_certs/etl.shtml  for more
details.

Of course one really has to know what specifications the product is being
certified to.

There are a multitude of UL and IEC specifications that cover different
products and product applications.

ETL certification is valid. Whether to use UL or CSA or ETL is a matter of
cost, schedule, customer service, and factory location (proximity of facotry
to service provider affects FUS [follow-up service] costs).
ETL would require samples and documentation.
CE is just a mark, not an organization. ETL (like UL and many others) can
provide services permitting usage of the CE mark.
Your meter rated at 500V but having 250V fuses is not odd. These fuses are
for overcurrent protection, and 250V is the highest nominal value for
commonly available replacement fuses.
Coffee makers require flame retardant plastic (94-V0 or V1). Standard is
EN60335?
Thermostat versus two thermal fuses is an individual manufacturer's design
consideration. Either of these or other protection methods are valid as
long as all of these test in the standard(s) can be met.

I've had the delightful experience (~1980) of being in a computer lab
next to an office where someone left one of those things going, when
they left for the day. An unforgettable experience...by the time we
could smell the smoke in the lab, the office was completely engulfed
in flames.

Are they really any safer, now? Seeing the efforts big business has
been making to remove government oversight where it can, I'm not
terribly confident about that.

"/> Of course. But there are data. Injuries and deaths from electrical shock
and fires for one. These have remained just about constant even though the
population has increased and has become less aware of electrical hazards (my
view). The CPSC opened an investigation of electrical/lighting fires last
year and is even paying a $50 &quot;bounty&quot; to fire departments to file reports.
Nothing significant so far.

What I see as the main problem at the moment is fake and counterfeited UL
(and other) marks placed on products, mostly imported, that haven't been
inspected or built to standards. Major manufacturers are paying extra to
CSA, for example, to do &quot;dock&quot; inspections overseas to ensure that what's in
the container is what they ordered including proper standards marking.

But where does the fake stuff end up -- on the internet, in &quot;dollar&quot; stores?
I don't know.

&gt;Your meter rated at 500V but having 250V fuses is not odd. These fuses are
&gt;for overcurrent protection, and 250V is the highest nominal value for
&gt;commonly available replacement fuses.

"/> Many 600 volt fuses are available. The meter I use has 600 volt fuses
and they are readily available in the area I live.

&gt;&gt;I see appliances being sold now that lack UL or CSA approval markings
&gt;&gt; and instead are only ETL certified.

&gt;&gt; How good is ETL certification compared to those from UL and CSA?

&gt;&gt; Does ETL require actual sample products to be submitted for testing, or
&gt;&gt; are they like CE and let manufacturers work on the honor system (I have
&gt;&gt; a CE approved multimeter rated for use at up to 500V, but its fuses are
&gt;&gt; rated for only 250V, unlike a UL-approved Fluke).

&gt;&gt; Are coffee makers required to be made of fire resistant plastic by any
&gt;&gt; of the safety certification organizations? If so, which ones?

&gt;&gt; I'm asking all this because I noticed that an ETL-approved drip coffee
&gt;&gt; maker had only a bimetal thermostat to turn off the current while an
&gt;&gt; older UL-approved coffee maker also had two thermal fuses in series..

"/> The US old style glass tube automotive fuses when burned open won't
flash over at 500 volts. But if connected to a 500 volt circuit, when
they open the melting metal will likely vaporize and the conductive
plasma created will continue the conduction. The energy released would
likely cause the fuse to explode - not acceptable for most users. On
high available current circuits the plasma could go end to end causing
conduction for a relatively long period. The arc can vaporize more metal
feeding the plasma. This can cause a large explosion with flying shrapnel.

US fuses have not only a voltage rating but a rating for the maximum
current the fuse will interrupt. If the circuit has an available fault
current higher than the fuse interrupt rating the fuse can also explode,
even though the fuse is used within its voltage rating. I expect you
have the same thing over the pond.

Multimeters are rated for where in a power circuit they can be used,
like downstream from a panel (lower avalilable fault current) or on
service wires (high available fault current). This is based on the
design as in the paragraph above. I believe this is an IEC standard.

"/>&quot;Voltage Rating
The maximum voltage at which a fuse is designed to operate. Exceeding
the voltage rating of a fuse impairs its ability to clear an overload or
short circuit safely. Fuse can be used at any voltage below the fuse
voltage rating; a 250V fuse can be used in 125V circuits. Voltage
ratings are assumed to be for AC unless specifically labeled as DC.&quot;

"/> More particularly related to voltage:
When a fuse opens there will be an arc. The arc will have a voltage
across it. 32 volts will not support a very long arc. 500 volts will
suport a much longer arc and will be a lot harder to extinguish. As fuse
material is vaporized (as opposed to just ionized air) the resistance of
the arc will go down and an arc with a voltage drop of 500 volts across
it will increase and be even harder to extinguish.

"/> The interrupting capacity of a typical 1.25&quot; Fast-Acting 3AG fuse at
250V is MUCH lower than at 125VAC. They will interrupt 10kA at 125V,
but only more like THIRTY-FIVE amps at 250V. Check out the data
sheets.

Put them in a situation where they can see thousands of amperes fault
current @240V and they can and often do EXPLODE, rupturing the glass
and sending fragments everywhere.

Of course the 20mm types are worse again.

That's why Fluke multimeters use a much larger fuse.

During failure of the 3AG type fuses, the melted metal ionizes inside
the fuse and allows an arc to form directly from one end cap to the
other, which has very low impedance (low voltage drop, but lots of
watts for such a small enclosed space).

"/> All fuses (of any qulaity) are rated for a maximum voltage. Also not usualy
in big letters they will have a maximum current they can inturrupt. While
looking at the physical size of them, they all look the same. I don't know
what the differance is in them, but there must be. I was in a class put on
by one of the fuse makers. They said that at one time one of the selling
points for so many differant kinds of fuses it that they are made for a
specific purpose. Now they have reversed the thinking (selling point) that
one fuse will replace many fuses that are similar.

It is really interisting to watch the Fluke meter film on using the wrong
fuse in a circuit.
Nice demonstration of what can hapen if you hook you meter across the
circuit while in a current or ohm range when you really mean to measuer the
voltage.

At work I look in the cabinet with fuses and see about 10 differant fuses
that are almost the same size and ratings. Some will have slightly
differant tips on them so you can not use them in the some fuse holders.
Really bad to have to stock so many differant kinds.

&gt;&gt; sent a 15A, 15,000V fuse. It was just like a standard 3AG, but it
&gt;&gt; was about 3&quot; in diameter and about 12&quot; long. The ends were copper,
&gt;&gt; and it was filled with sand. Nobody knew what to do with it, so we
&gt;&gt; took it apart. Inside, down the middle of the sand, was a ceramic
&gt;&gt; rod which looked like it had been extruded through an asterisk-
&gt;&gt; shaped die. Wrapped in a very loose helix around this (like,
&gt;&gt; looser than one turn per diameter) were five very fine silvery-
&gt;&gt; colored wires, the fuse element itself. The glass tube had about
&gt;&gt; about a 3/8&quot; wall. It was quite fascinating. The sand, I guess,
&gt;&gt; was just plain old ordinary sand.

&gt;&gt; It was kinda kewl. :-)

&gt; A lot of those measures are about arc extinguishing.

&gt; Must be tricky @ 15kV though !

"/> I think it'd be fun to blow one and watch! To see if it actually
melts the sand, and how that ceramic form would stand up, and stuff
like that.

Unfortunately, this is the sport of the kind of kings who have a
15 KV 20A power supply lying around in the junque box. ;-P

Cheers!

&gt;What I see as the main problem at the moment is fake and counterfeited UL

&gt;what's in the container is what they ordered including proper standards

&gt;But where does the fake stuff end up -- on the internet, in &quot;dollar&quot;
&gt;stores? I don't know.

"/>  I have been gaining this impression that dollar stores get a lot of
stuff that is fake in one way or another.
I have had a dollar store compact fluorescent lamps burn out in an
uncomfortably spectacular manner a few minutes after I started running it.
Also I have heard of others having spectacular failures of dollar store
compact fluorescent lamps, including one that went &quot;pop&quot; 3 times
in the process of burning out.

And also fakes in matters other than safety - how about those
flashlights that say they never need batteries - shake to recharge? In my
expereince, the $2 dollar-store version (in 2 different packages now yet!)
has a fake magnet, a shorted coil, and non-rechargeable &quot;coin style&quot;
batteries.

Maybe I will send the FTC a dollar store compact fluorescent lamp that
produces somewhere around 30% of its claimed light output, in its package
that claims 1580 lumens and &quot;light of a 100 watt bulb&quot;. I have yet to see
a dollar store compact fluorescent lamp meet a light output claim. Some
dollar store compact fluorescent lamps also claim &quot;soft warm white light&quot;
but actually glow a bluish &quot;daylight&quot; color.

almost an inch long between 12 AWG copper wires with only 2-3 amps at 120

arc.

Also, fuses often have a lower voltage rating for DC than for AC.

&gt;&gt; Really? Then try a 32 volt automotive fuse at 500 volts. PS, make
&gt;&gt; sure you can pull the plug or kill the main braker before you grab the
&gt;&gt; fire extingisher.

&gt;Really? Even an 1 1/4&quot; 'automotive' fuse?

"/>  May work OK with AC voltage that high, especially if it is a lower
current fuse - but it has not been tested and certified to be reliably
safe/effective in such use. May even usually work OK. May work OK when
you try it, and then your luck may run out sometime later if that fuse is
somewhere other than under your eyes or sometime when you (or worse still
others) don't know where the power disconnect and the fire extinguisher are.

more filament-like and they start instantly, just like a bulb.

"/> It is also a matter of energy to be absorbed. A 1A fuse blowing in a 24V
circuit because the current gradually sauntered towards 2A is one thing,
the same fuse in a 240V mains circuit experiencing a sudden dead short
on the other side is quite another. The breaker for such circuits can be
designed for 16A or more depending on where you are in Europe.

I've had fuses spewing their glass and sand all over the place and
leaving nasty scorch marks. I don't think running fuses above their
maximum voltage rating is a good idea. If a manufacturer does it anyway
and something happens the lawyers will be all over them.
