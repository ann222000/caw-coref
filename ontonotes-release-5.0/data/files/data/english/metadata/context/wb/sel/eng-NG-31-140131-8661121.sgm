JP is totally inneffective and there is no way he could mount a comeback
down 19-3 especially since the defense has only stopped the Steelers once
today.

I think we all know that with the losses to the defense that the Bills
are going nowhere.

The least Jauron could do is give JP the chance to &quot;air it out&quot; and
see if he is salvageable.

That's not happening. Trent looked great in pre-season. He might be
worth be given a shot but not with Jauron's game plan.

Yes, it's definitely Losman's fault that the defense had only stopped
the Steelers once. Add that to the list in the other thread.

Exactly my point, Dude, thanks. Jim Kelly in his prime couldn't have
beaten the Steelers today with that horse***t game plan.

I'll answer that when a non-imbecile calls the offensive plays for an
entire game. Jim Kelly in his prime couldn't have beaten the Steelers
with the game plan they gave Losman to work with today, and probably
couldn't have beaten the Broncos last week with the play calling in
that game either.

They could have Joe Montana out there and it wouldn't matter if
they're going to run on third-and-16 inside the two-minute warning,
and hand the ball to the running back on their own 29-yard line on the
last play of the half instead of trying a Hail Mary.

I agree with you.  It is not so much Losman as it is the game plan.
No plays were called to minimize the pressure Pittsburgh was putting
on the offensive line/Losman.  When there is no deep threat (or
respect for a deep threat) you need to run other plays that will
minimize the defensive pass rush.  Why does Jauron refuse to run
screen plays to Lynch?  Yesterday, Lynch caught a short pass and
turned it into a long gain (unfortunately I believe it did not go for
a 1st down since it was 3rd and 20 or something).

With that said, we have no pass defense.  I joked with someone at the
bar that Buffalo would be doing really well if they were playing in
the Canadian Football League (stopped Pittsburgh on 1st and 2nd downs,
gave up the big play on 3rd down).  Next week will not be pretty
against New England.

It's Losman and the game plan.

Losman threw high to several receivers and most of those dropped
incomplete, I think one was intercepted.

The outside WRs are not making big enough plays.  5 passes to Price
looks good, 5 more to parrish looks good, but of those 10 or so
completions, I think 3 or 4 were 3 or 2 yard gains.  That is not what
we need.

Teams are neutralizing our downfield passing game.  More than likely
playing 2 to Evans side, and also blitzing a 5th player which is
forcing quicker throws.

I think we see Edwards on Monday night vs Dallas.

Good points.  If these things are obvious to us then why are they not
obvious to the coaches?  There are ways to neutralize a blitz.  I few
screens or mis-direction plays might make the defense hold up their
pass rush resulting in 1 or 2 more seconds for Losman to find a
receiver.

What has Edwards ever accomplished to warrant such high praise?  He has
played against second and third team defenses that had no defensive schemes
installed for the Bills.    In the meantime in real games there are no
screen passes, no quick slants, no draw plays, no quarterback draws, nothing
to slow the blitz.  Put Edwards in there and it will be more of the same.
There will be double teams on Evans because every team knows we have no
number two or three receiver and blitzes constantly because the Bills can't
handle them or game play away from them.  If the game plan isn't changed it
won't matter what quarterback is in there.

first i agree that edwards is too green to make a difference. and i am not
aware of any other options 'at this time' except to suck it up and get ready
in week 3 to start looking at college talent. but -- and i am sure that
there are many examples the other direction but texans traded for a qb that
is having great succes (2 weeks) after the prior qb was killed, same in
dallas with romo in the last half of last year. and maybe KC last year when
green goes down. management needs to take a chance and get ready by changes.

Dallas' D is the first &quot;light&quot; defense we see this season.  Dallas
would have a hard time tackling my wife.  And she's pretty hot, so she
would have their attention.

I think Losman plays 3 quarters vs Dallas, and if team is playing this
bad, we try Edwards for a quarter.  He at least gets some game film to
study before he takes over around week 10.

consider some recent switches:

Cutler took over for Plummer
Leinert took over for Warner
E Manning took over for Warner

I would say Cutler's team is thinking playoffs in year 1, granted that
defense is quite good
I would say Leinert's team is thinking &quot;winning season&quot; for first time
in years, and wildcard/playoffs are possible
I would say the Eli experiment is being transferred to a second coach
real soon.  Maybe we can trade Losman to the Giants?
