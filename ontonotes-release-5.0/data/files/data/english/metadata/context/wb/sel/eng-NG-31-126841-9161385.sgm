_Bush’s Betrayal of Trust: It’s Not Just Iraq _

I sure hope  Jennifer Loven of the _Associated Press_
( http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/n/a/2007/10/04/nation...
)  isn’t endangering  her career by stating the obvious today:
Over and over, President Bush confidently promised to “solve problems, not
pass them on to future presidents and future generations.” As the  clock runs
out on his eight-year presidency, a tall stack of troubles remain  and Bush’s
words ring hollow.
Iraq, budget deficits, the looming insolvency of Social Security and
Medicare, high health and energy costs, a national immigration mess —  the next
president will inherit these problems in January  2009….
… When Americans are asked to choose national priorities, they most  commonly
name the economy, health care, the war in Iraq, terrorism and gas  prices.
Consider the state of play on these and other issues:
–The economy is relatively sound and deficits are falling after peaking in
2004. But an entire presidency of red ink has ballooned the overall  federal
debt from $5.7 trillion when Bush became president to $8.9 trillion  now. The
Iraq war, including providing medical care and disability  benefits to veterans,
as well as expensive new programs like a Medicare  prescription drug benefit
threaten to drive deficits back up.  Economists fear growing odds of a
recession.
–The nation’s health care spending, public and  private, totaled $1.5
trillion when Bush took office. By the time he  leaves, it is expected to be $2.6
trillion — a 75 percent increase. Meanwhile,  the nation’s number of uninsured
has swelled, from 14 percent of the  population in 2001 to 16 percent last
year, or a total of 47 million  people.
–Now in its fifth year, the Iraq war  has claimed the lives of more than
3,800 members of the U.S. military and more  than 73,000 Iraqi civilians, wounded
over 28,000 U.S. military personnel, and  cost nearly half a trillion dollars.
Even if combat ends, Bush says  the United States will need to provide
military, economic and political  support beyond his presidency and have “an
enduring relationship” with  Iraq.
–No domestic terrorist attack has followed  those of Sept. 11, 2001. But the
intelligence community concluded in July,  nearly six years after the attacks,
that al-Qaida has been allowed to  re-centralize and rejuvenate itself in
Pakistan, where the  still-missing Osama bin Laden is believed to be hiding.
–Energy prices are volatile, and high. The cost  of a barrel of oil has
soared during Bush’s presidency, from $29 to about $80  a barrel. Gas prices
averaged $1.45 a gallon in 2001 and now are  running about $2.80 — a 93 percent
increase.
. . . “It’s hard to find something he has done that really has  improved the
situation a great deal,” said Stephen J. Wayne, a  Georgetown University
presidential scholar.
When you fail on this scale, it’s not just incompetence — it’s an  ongoing
_betrayal of trust_ ( http://www.needlenose.com/node/view/3434 ) , the
abandonment of one moral responsibility after another.
From _children’s health care_
( http://www.firedoglake.com/2007/10/03/the-test-of-greatness-is-how-we... )  to _torture_
( http://www.firedoglake.com/2007/10/04/torture-its-all-the-rage/ )  to Iraq and beyond, the
Democratic party (in Congress, or through any of their presidential candidates)
could build a day-by-day narrative that steadily reframes public perceptions
of  both parties… simply by noting a moral duty the Republicans have failed to
uphold on that particular day, and explaining what they will do to fulfill
it.
That’s why _MoveOn.org’s recent  campaign_
( https://pol.moveon.org/donate/mcconnell.html?rc=mcconnell_littleguy&amp;r...; )  on this theme is such a _threat
to the  Republicans_
( http://www.firedoglake.com/2007/09/18/moveon-betrayal-of-trust-and-th... ) ; it plants an idea in people’s minds  that
maybe the GOP doesn’t deserve that aura of morality that they’re always
claiming for themselves. And once people are cued to start looking for proof of
the Republicans’ moral failure, they’re likely to find more evidence every
day.

Pay attention to what the rightwingers claim we are doing, because  that's
exactly what they are up to. - Randi  Rhodes
