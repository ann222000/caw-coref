I might shed tears from time to time but never for any politicians,
except until a few days ago when I came across an article about a Thai
physician, Dr. Chanchai of Phrae Province who was brutally murdered on
October 22, 2007.

Dr. Chanchai devoted most of his life to serving his community.
Amongst many things in his public servant career, he wanted to bring a
meaningful political change from centralization to local autonomy. He
believed that local administrators at all levels should be elected by
the local people, not appointed from the central government in
Bangkok. He had seen more than fair share of  inefficiency on the part
of government in his lifetime (the Chaow Cham Yen Cham) at best from
centralized power. Decade after decades life at the local community
level like Prae province has not improved. If young people want a
better education, then they have to leave their community for Bangkok
or Chaing Mai. He was very popular and well loved by people in his
community.

Recently he voiced his support for People Power Party (PPP) (a TRT new
rendition). This must not have set well with the junta, as a secret
document revealed their plans to destroy PPP and their high hope of
capturing majority votes from community such as Phrae province.

Dr. Chanchai was one of the upcountry voters who the Bangkok elite
called the upcountry voters as &quot;uneducated.&quot; Yet, these upcountry
voters know all too well that freedom is never free: someone had paid
a dear price for their freedom!

I wept with Phrae people for their great loss of a leader with such a
brilliant mind: a true visionary in every sense of the word. But most
of all, I wept for Thailand for allowing a small group of evil and
selfish people to destroy the goodness of Thailand!

Are you certain that properly expressed his position?

Current teachers 'should stay under the ministry'
Published on Aug 25 , 2005  (The Nation)

Teachers currently employed by state-run schools should remain under the
Education Ministry even when their schools shift to local
administrative-body control, says the chairman of the Phrae Provincial
Administration Organisation.

&quot;Doing so would reduce teachers' concerns about their status and their
welfare,&quot; said Dr Chanchai Silapa-uaychai.

He said only new teachers should come under local administrative bodies,
which would play a greater role in educational services as the central
government pursued its decentralisation policy.

Chanchai was speaking at a seminar on decentralisation of educational
services.

He believes decentralisation should allow the ministry to be in charge of
policy, curricula and the quality of educational services, while local
administrative bodies should handle only the physical infrastructure.

He said the ministry should also evaluate each local administrative body on
how it manages the schools under its charge.
&quot;Following the evaluation, the ministry should take over any schools from
local bodies showing a poor performance,&quot; Chanchai added.
&lt;/q&gt;

So you figure anyone thinking to kill Dr. Chanchai would figure that would
intimidate voters into voting against PPP?
Really?

Bangkok Post last week:
&lt;q&gt; Authorities still don't know who was behind the killing but suspect a
political conflict may have sparked the murder. &lt;/q&gt;

So, you've got the junta as being responsible for his murder.

CRIME / THREE ALLEGED HITMEN ARRESTED

PAO squabbles linked to murder
THAWEESAK SUKKHASEM

Phrae _ Police yesterday arrested three suspected hitmen for the
murder of Phrae provincial administration organisation (PAO) president
Charnchai Silapauaychai as he was jogging in a local sports stadium on
Oct 22.

The suspects confessed to the murder, deputy national police chief
Wongkot Maneerin said.

The killing was linked to a conflict over a 120 million baht loan that
the PAO was seeking from Krung Thai Bank and the dismissal of
Provincial Administration Council speaker Pongsawat Supasiri, Pol Gen
Wongkot said.

Police nabbed the suspects in a raid yesterday on the home of Jongrak
Supasiri, 55, in Muang district.

The police arrested Thanee Wongphaet, 30, the suspected gunman who
allegedly repeatedly fired upon Charnchai, and two accomplices, driver
Itthikorn Ungtrakool, 25, and Kiattisak Ponglangka, 30.

Another alleged collaborator in the murder, Jetrin Inpradit, was still
at large, police said.

Pol Gen Wongkot said the three suspects confessed that they and Mr
Jetrin were paid 50,000 baht to kill Charnchai.

Police think an internal conflict created by the 120 million baht loan
that Phrae PAO had applied for, and the dismissal of Mr Pongsawat, led
to the murder.

Mr Pongsawat had taken his case to the Administrative Court to have
the dismissal order reversed.

Police believe Mr Jongrak, a close relative of Mr Pongsawat and his
elder sister _ former Democrat MP Siriwan Prassachaksattru _ was angry
over Mr Pongsawat's dismissal and hired the four men to gun down
Charnchai, said Pol Gen Wongkot.

Mr Jongrak has denied all charges.

Police yesterday also searched Mr Pongsawat's house where they found
six bullets for a 9mm pistol.

When gunned down during his morning exercise at the province's sport
stadium, Charnchai was shot eight times with a 9mm pistol.

Police said they detained Mr Pongsawat, 48, for questioning and
charged him with illegal possession of bullets without a licence. Mr
Pongsawat was later released, using his position as council speaker to
authorise bail.

Police yesterday planned to have the three suspects re-enact the
murder. But they cancelled the plan, fearing turmoil after learning
3,000 local residents had flocked to the stadium to watch.

The suspects were yesterday brought to Bangkok and handed over to the
Crime Suppression Division which will handle the case, police said.

Khun Noi This has been discussed on late night radio in the last few
days, the consensus is that it was yet another upcountry &quot;meu peun rab
jaang&quot; hit job over big money.  I'm sure you know they happen quite
often :-((  Evil and selfish people? yes they are, but in this case
it's becoming clear that it had nothing to do with the situation in
Thai central government politics.

Maybe for once you read the real news - and weep then - your BS story
didn't hold water - the conflict was linked to a conflict over a 120
million Baht loan that the PAO was seeking from Krung Thai Bank and
the dismissal of Provincial Administration Council speaker Pongsawat

But crocodile tears make more impressions eh, or you just believe

Chabby, she went well beyond just believing some BS innuendo to be truth, in
extending her 'creativity' three-fold:

1. Setting Chanchai up both as a highly venerated local hero (if not a
saint!) who totally opposed central control (Noi:&lt;q&gt;local administrators at
all levels should be elected by the local people, not appointed from the
central government in Bangkok&lt;/q&gt;)  AND as a Thaksinite martyr struck down
by orders of the junta. The latter shown to be utterly false, and the former
contradicted by Chanchai's OWN words in 2005: &lt;q&gt;Following the evaluation,
the ministry should take over any schools from local bodies showing a poor
performance&lt;/q&gt;

2. Vilifying the junta with such lurid prose as: &lt;q&gt; I wept for Thailand for
allowing a small group of evil and selfish people to destroy the goodness of
Thailand! &lt;/q&gt; while SOMEHOW pretending that her native land was a place all
of sweetness and light before the September 2006 coup, an event that deposed
a would-be king whose 'corrective measures' included the summary executions
of THOUSANDS, and the silencings (by various means) of more than a few
'inconvenient voices,' and the cooption of parliament and courts explicitly
for corrupt Shinawatra gain at the expense of the Nation, to name but three
of many FAR from 'goodness of Thailand' TS/TRT agendas that the
far-from-perfect/self-interested/bumbling junta SURELY embodies no
evil-vs-good comparison to !

Furthermore, even though Noi apparently left her homeland at somewhat of a
tender age, how might she be unaware that an earlier regime change included
the streets running red with blood, or that in Thailand past and present,
life is quite often very cheaply disposed of, and millions of poor lives
bear the weight of unalloyed greed of the mighty, WHATEVER government is or
is not in power?
Yet to Noi, Thailand was *good* until September 2006?
. . the mind boggles . ..

3. Once more dragging in the TRT mantra of 'BKK elite think the upcountry
people are stupid' while finagling the anti-PPP designs of the junta as if
tantamount to letting a contract on Chanchai, and nevermind the inane
implausibility of such a 'measure,' at dire risk of ENSURING a defiantly-PRO
PPP landslide even without the usual buying of votes, were such a daft move
ever brought to light.

Noi's denigratory devotions transcend mere facts into a realm of
fantasy--and then some.

Fortunate for me that I can still read and write Thai very well which
allow me read and understand the great love and respect Phrae people
have for Dr. Chanchai. One particular comment struck at the heart of
the current Thai politics, that it's dangerous for any Thai
politicians who dare to keep promises that they made to the people.

Fantasy or not, I will take words from the people who knew him
personally over the current mainstream (the military boots lickers)
Thai media any time!

&gt; &gt; all levels should be elected by the local people, not appointed from the

I don't know who commanded the murderers but it's true that the PPP
candidates are afraid by the repeted blatant threats coming from the
putchists. The polygamist general has even not denied the secret note
asking to block the anti-junta politicians.

Here is the editorial of the Thai newspaper Matichon:

Police must act against political killings

Matichon Editorial _ Political violence is so common in our society
that some people may take it for granted. But it's about time that the
Royal Thai Police Office took serious action to stop it. On Oct 22, Dr
Charnchai Silpa-uaychai, president of the Provincial Administration
Organisation (PAO) in the northern province of Phrae, was shot dead by
an unidentified gunman while jogging in the provincial sports stadium.
His murder shocked the local people.

The PAO is the highest elected provincial body, and its president may
be likened to an elected governor.

Such blatant murders of elected officials and local politicians are
not uncommon. They make front-page headlines but do not draw public
outrage or prompt law enforcement officers to crack down on hired
gunmen and the influential people behind them.

Conflicts of interest, whether in politics or business, are sometimes
resolved through violent action. A life can be taken by a hired gunman
for a sum of 50,000 or 60,000 baht. But we are a civilised country
with an established rule of law. The police must perform their duty in
maintaining law and order. They must protect innocent people against
harm. Those who commit murder or other serious crimes must be brought
to justice.

Now that political campaigning has begun, we hope those in charge of
maintaining law and order will do their utmost to stop the kind of
violence that happened in Phrae. For its part, the government must
impose more restrictions on the purchase and acquisition of firearms.
Those found to have illegal firearms or war weapons must face stern
legal action. Hired gunmen now seem to be unafraid of law enforcement
officers. They kill people in broad daylight and simply flee the
scene. Such barbaric actions must be put to an end by those in charge.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I wept with Phrae people for their great loss of a leader with such a
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; brilliant mind: a true visionary in every sense of the word. But most of
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; all, I wept for Thailand for allowing a small group of evil and selfish
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; people to destroy the goodness of Thailand!
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Noi
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Maybe for once you read the real news - and weep then - your BS story
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; didn't hold water - the conflict was linked to a conflict over a 120
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; million Baht loan that the PAO was seeking from Krung Thai Bank and the
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; dismissal of Provincial Administration Council speaker Pongsawat Supasiri,
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Pol Gen Wongkot said.
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; But crocodile tears make more impressions eh, or you just believe every BS
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; story?
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Chabby

&gt; &gt;&gt; Chabby, she went well beyond just believing some BS innuendo to be truth, in
&gt; &gt;&gt; extending her 'creativity' three-fold:

&gt; &gt;&gt; 1. Setting Chanchai up both as a highly venerated local hero (if not a
&gt; &gt;&gt; saint!) who totally opposed central control (Noi:&lt;q&gt;local administrators at
&gt; &gt;&gt; all levels should be elected by the local people, not appointed from the
&gt; &gt;&gt; central government in Bangkok&lt;/q&gt;)  AND as a Thaksinite martyr struck down
&gt; &gt;&gt; by orders of the junta. The latter shown to be utterly false, and the former
&gt; &gt;&gt; contradicted by Chanchai's OWN words in 2005: &lt;q&gt;Following the evaluation,
&gt; &gt;&gt; the ministry should take over any schools from local bodies showing a poor
&gt; &gt;&gt; performance&lt;/q&gt;

&gt; &gt;&gt; 2. Vilifying the junta with such lurid prose as: &lt;q&gt; I wept for Thailand for
&gt; &gt;&gt; allowing a small group of evil and selfish people to destroy the goodness of
&gt; &gt;&gt; Thailand! &lt;/q&gt; while SOMEHOW pretending that her native land was a place all
&gt; &gt;&gt; of sweetness and light before the September 2006 coup, an event that deposed
&gt; &gt;&gt; a would-be king whose 'corrective measures' included the summary executions
&gt; &gt;&gt; of THOUSANDS, and the silencings (by various means) of more than a few
&gt; &gt;&gt; 'inconvenient voices,' and the cooption of parliament and courts explicitly
&gt; &gt;&gt; for corrupt Shinawatra gain at the expense of the Nation, to name but three
&gt; &gt;&gt; of many FAR from 'goodness of Thailand' TS/TRT agendas that the
&gt; &gt;&gt; far-from-perfect/self-interested/bumbling junta SURELY embodies no
&gt; &gt;&gt; evil-vs-good comparison to !

&gt; &gt;&gt; Furthermore, even though Noi apparently left her homeland at somewhat of a
&gt; &gt;&gt; tender age, how might she be unaware that an earlier regime change included
&gt; &gt;&gt; the streets running red with blood, or that in Thailand past and present,
&gt; &gt;&gt; life is quite often very cheaply disposed of, and millions of poor lives
&gt; &gt;&gt; bear the weight of unalloyed greed of the mighty, WHATEVER government is or
&gt; &gt;&gt; is not in power?
&gt; &gt;&gt; Yet to Noi, Thailand was *good* until September 2006?
&gt; &gt;&gt;  . . the mind boggles . ..

&gt; &gt;&gt; 3. Once more dragging in the TRT mantra of 'BKK elite think the upcountry
&gt; &gt;&gt; people are stupid' while finagling the anti-PPP designs of the junta as if
&gt; &gt;&gt; tantamount to letting a contract on Chanchai, and nevermind the inane
&gt; &gt;&gt; implausibility of such a 'measure,' at dire risk of ENSURING a defiantly-PRO
&gt; &gt;&gt; PPP landslide even without the usual buying of votes, were such a daft move
&gt; &gt;&gt; ever brought to light.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Noi's denigratory devotions transcend mere facts into a realm of
&gt; &gt;&gt; fantasy--and then some.

&gt; &gt;Fortunate for me that I can still read and write Thai very well which
&gt; &gt;allow me read and understand the great love and respect Phrae people
&gt; &gt;have for Dr. Chanchai. One particular comment struck at the heart of
&gt; &gt;the current Thai politics, that it's dangerous for any Thai
&gt; &gt;politicians who dare to keep promises that they made to the people.

&gt; &gt;Fantasy or not, I will take words from the people who knew him
&gt; &gt;personally over the current mainstream (the military boots lickers)
&gt; &gt;Thai media any time!

&gt; &gt;Noi

&gt; I don't know who commanded the murderers but it's true that the PPP
&gt; candidates are afraid by the repeted blatant threats coming from the
&gt; putchists. The polygamist general has even not denied the secret note
&gt; asking to block the anti-junta politicians.

Tell us why you re blacklisted in Thailand.

Seems that the &quot;Thai Law enforcers&quot; are after you now, the poor PEDO
from
Paris (France)

You have also been posting enough information to let the Thai trace
you.

Now, that would be a far more interesting story

When are you planning your next trip to Thailand?
Latest news goes around that the Thai Immigration is waiting for you
to
explain some things in &quot;Hotel Bangkok&quot;.

So, can you now read the Thai numbers?
The well travelled and high educated pedo Frenchman?

You sound every day more and more boring.
Is this what staying in France do to peeple?

Of course you know Thai politics by what &quot;a few Thai ladies (whores)&quot;
have
told you.................

Care to tell the newsgroup how you remain seated, nipping on your beer
as a
&quot;ba ba boo boo fahrang supremacist&quot; while the reastaurant was on fire?

Care to tell the newsgroup your pedo story about how you seduced a
choirboy
carrying 13 condoms?

BTW, you are posting jewels of anti-Thai propaganda lately in here.
Do you plan to come back to Thailand in the near future?
Wonder if the current government know all this and &quot;lesse majeste&quot; you
show
in your posts?
Like the one where you were holding a subversive speech in an
University

&gt; Police must act against political killings

&gt; Matichon Editorial _ Political violence is so common in our society
&gt; that some people may take it for granted. But it's about time that the
&gt; Royal Thai Police Office took serious action to stop it. On Oct 22, Dr
&gt; Charnchai Silpa-uaychai, president of the Provincial Administration
&gt; Organisation (PAO) in the northern province of Phrae, was shot dead by
&gt; an unidentified gunman while jogging in the provincial sports stadium.
&gt; His murder shocked the local people.

&gt; The PAO is the highest elected provincial body, and its president may
&gt; be likened to an elected governor.

&gt; Such blatant murders of elected officials and local politicians are
&gt; not uncommon. They make front-page headlines but do not draw public
&gt; outrage or prompt law enforcement officers to crack down on hired
&gt; gunmen and the influential people behind them.

&gt; Conflicts of interest, whether in politics or business, are sometimes
&gt; resolved through violent action. A life can be taken by a hired gunman
&gt; for a sum of 50,000 or 60,000 baht. But we are a civilised country
