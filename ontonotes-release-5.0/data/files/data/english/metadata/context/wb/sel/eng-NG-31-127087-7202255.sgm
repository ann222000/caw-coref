"Tuesdays With Morrie" - very easy reading and a good book.  Took me all of
4 hours to read it.
Presently reading "The Memory Keeper's Daughter" by Kim Edwards.  I'm not
real far into the book yet but so far a good book.

I'm definitely buying this book! The subject matter sounds very interesting.
If you like this book, I recommend "My Sister's Keeper" by Jodi Piccoult.

Enjoy your book :)

I read Anita Shreve's "Light on Snow". Not one of her best, but still a very
good read. "Family Tree" by Barbra Delinsky. Highly recommend this book. The
subject matter deals with race, prejudice and family. I also recommend "The
Life You Longed For" by Maribeth Fischer. It's about a mom who's accused of
Munchausen by proxy. A page turner that you cannot put down!! I'm currently
reading Jodi Piccoult's.... The Tenth Circle". It's good........but I've read
better.

I am reading a biography about Bessie Smith. She was a very interesting
person with a lot of self-destructive behavior that you can just tell had to
end with an early death!  I can see why Janice Joplin like Bessie and
provided her grave with a tombstone - they both live very parallel careers
in many ways.

If you do not know who Bessie Smith was - you might enjoy reading the book
and/or finding some of her music (from the 1920s and 1930s).

The book is "Bessie" by Chris Albertson.

Here are a few web sites about her.
http://www.redhotjazz.com/bessie.html
http://www.pbs.org/jazz/biography/artist_id_smith_bessie.htm
http://physics.lunet.edu/blues/Bessie_Smith.html

Here's one mainly about Janice Joplin but also about her respect for Bessie.

I started to read Without a Doubt by Marcia Clark (People v. Simpson), but
it was too anxiety-provoking so I brought it back to the library.  I'll have
to find some other relaxing book to read.  It's a shame because I think that
book would've been interesting to read.

"City" by Alessandro Baricco, a most unusual and very impressive novel
(is that's what it is, ot doesn't really fit in any category). One of
the best books I've read lately.

I have started about 7 books in the past year, but I've lost my attention
span to get through them.  I find myself re-reading a page about 5 times for
comprehension.  It's almost more of a chore than fun.  Thank you anxiety!
Gotta love it.

Having to re-read pages multiple times like you do just kills any enjoyment
that I would get out of reading. I used to do a lot of reading when the
"mood struck." Now, the mood never strikes.

It doesn't strike me anymore, either.  :-P   I used to LOVE to read, too.

Kili ~

Have you tried books on tape or downloading from a place like audible.com to
an MP3 player or to listen to on your computer?

National Public Radio has many of its shows available for free to download
to your computer or MP3 player.  I always download "Wait Wait Don't Tell Me"
to listen to 2 or 3 times the week after they are on the air.  There's a
wonderful show, "The Leonard Lopate Show" that provides discussion and
information about many interesting topics.  The shows are about 30 to 50
mins. long and the topics are very varied!  "Fresh Air" is now available for
free downloads also.

When I had a knee replacement about 5 years ago - I was on wonderful pain
medicine for about 10 days and just could not concentrate or remember any
thing I read.  I found books by James Patterson easy to remember because
each chapter was usually 2 or 3 pages long.  Of course the books had some
thing like 99 chapters BUT they were all short and easy to connect together.

I find myself reading a lot more magazines like Time and Newsweek these days
too.

That's a great idea, Tom, and one I've never thought of.  I can download all
kinds of things.  Thank you for the reminder!

I've been like that for a long time and it just keeps getting worse.  I
tend to blame it on ADD/ADHD.  I can read the same thing over and over
yet nothing seems to stick.  Normally I realize that I was thinking
about something else while reading.  Try it again and the same thing
happens.  Multi tasking is defininitely out!

That doesn't work for me either.  I can start listening to the weather
forecast for example, but just after it starts, my mind drifts off to
something else.  The forecast is over and I have no clue what they just
said.  I can't blame it on the meds, I've been this way as long as I can
remember.  I can often hear the beginning of one of my favorite songs
and I'll want to sing along and hear every note, but the next thing I
know, the song is over and I'm not even sure what I was thinking about
when the song was on?
