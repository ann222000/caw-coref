Christmas Greetings! ( not the FAQ kind ;~) ), I have a problem maybe
you could all help me solve. I work alone most of the time and I really
look forward to participating in the Discussions here at RA, you might
say it gets me out of the Shop ;~)) .I would like to give each and
everyone of you (Regulars &amp; Irregulars ) a gift as a thank you for your
camaraderie and input this past year, the problem is you would have to
go through my site to &quot; Pick up&quot; your gift ( there are over 150 to
choose from) and some might view that as advertising. I am making this
offer in the spirit of the season, and I hope it is accepted as such, so
talk about it and If everyone is okay with it I will set it up. Man, I
love this business!

I think it is a very sweet gesture &amp; see no problem with it.

Sounds very sweet, Mike. :) And a touching gesture of good will.
And, er, will you be gathering data on us when we come to your site? Just
kidding! But I may as well confess now: I'm the KGB agent who visits your
site. Or have I been using my CIA internet account? :( Being a double agent
has never been more confusing.

Bill &amp; Joseph's wish list made me think that this could make
an interesting subject to discuss. As a child, what was the
one present that you wanted with all your heart, but never
received?

I always dreamed of one of those huge Victorian-style doll
houses that light up, fully furnished, of course. I was
raised by my mother &amp; money was tight for her in the 50's &amp;
60's. She always managed to save enough to buy me one
wonderful birthday or Christmas present to suppliment the
other gifts of clothing. If I had ever gotten the house, it
would have likely been made by one of my uncles, but I
wouldn't have minded. Sadly, there was not a room in our
home for one.

Over 150 items - I was thinking perhaps you were talking about 150 fresh $100
bills to help us pay for our Christmas credit card bills?

You are tooooo kind.

Cyn I think was hoping for:

50 new pairs of spiked heels
30 new sticks of red lipstick
20 new whips
10 free visits to get her nails airbrushed
20 cans of aquanet
19 full length mirrors for well...

And a partridge in a pear tree!

I think you may be right. The only thing I ever asked for from the time
I was 5 years old was a horse. I wanted a jet black horse, but with a
white mane and tail. However, any color would have been okay. I was
sure our garage in Detroit was big enough to turn into a stall.
Unfortunately my parents didn't agree with me so I had to wait until I
was grown and could buy my own horse.

&gt;And a partridge in a pear tree!

"/> Ah, yes, Reyne. Except for the Aquanet. (I like a little bounce, don't ya
know.) Substitution: 5 pair of handcuffs (the furry kind). Oh, and please
make my partridge Keith Partridge. Thank you very much.

I would like someone who could work for nothing, didn't care what hours she
worked, and was very neat and organized. Pleeze Santa, can you find someone
like that? What? Mrs. Claus already has a job?

&gt;I always dreamed of one of those huge Victorian-style doll

&gt;other gifts of clothing. If I had ever gotten the house, it
&gt;would have likely been made by one of my uncles, but I
&gt;wouldn't have minded. Sadly, there was not a room in our

I always wanted a horse, of course. But even I could see that an
apartment was not the best venue for such a critter. I wasn't until I
was 34 (a year short of being eligible for the Presidency) before I
finally bought myself one. I did get the Red Ryder BB gun that I
wanted. And the electric train.

Until then, I had made do with windup trains, and -- despairing of
ever getting the real thing -- I tacked the track to the floor around
the tree, finally DOING something about the fact that the cheapo
sections always pulled apart. Mom and Dad did their best to dissuade
me, knowing they'd just have to pull out the tacks when they set up my
new American Flyer. But I remember being adamant.

Unfortunately, my father immersed himself so thorougly in the project
that he played with the new train all through the wee hours and burned
out a switch in the engine. In the morning, there was my new electric
train!!! But it didn't work quite right, and it never did.

Ah well. Daddy had a good time. And guess what I'm expecting for
Christmas this year?? Yup. An electric train! :))

lessions in that area were a waste of time and money. Of course, I dreamed for

"/> I got a toy oven (can't remember if it was a Suzy Homemaker) and was
horribly disappointed in the teeny-weensy cakes it turned out - but of
course I was also devastated when the folks refused to buy more of the
special mixes that it required. It was one of those presents that are much
better dreamed about than had.

The one thing I really wanted was a spaceship. ( I got into my Mom's
collection of Galaxy's at a very early age.) I would have happily accepted
any old rustbucket, Buck Rogers reject, as long as I could go out there to
the stars. I still get that yearning sometimes.

Christmas. Unfortunately for her, her older brother Bud was a joker.
He played an awful joke on her one Christmas. He borrowed a halter with
a lead rope from a guy who had a livery stable. He also took a few
horse droppings. On Christmas morning, Mom came into the living room
only to find a lead rope tied to the mantle with the halter lying on the
floor. A few feet away were the horse droppings on a newspaper.
Attached to the halter was a note that said, &quot;Sorry, sis, the horse got
away!&quot; Mom was devastated and my grandparents were so mad, they
grounded Bud.

This story always struke me as the ultimate dirty trick. :-(

and just went to ground for the season. Well. I wanted to do that,

"/> One of the things that makes me sad and nostalgic these days is when I
see kids on their bicycles all dressed up with helmets, knee pads,
elbow pads, what ever. We rode our bikes bare headed and even bare
footed. They were our horses. You leaned them up against the front
porch or a tree or something and when you were ready to go you jumped
on and off you went. You could always tell where the neighborhood
kids were by the pile of bikes outside. I guess kids are safer now.
god knows I still have the scars on elbows and knees from the
occasional fall but I think if I had had to go through all that
dressing up that would have been the end of the freedom we felt riding
our bikes. Mine by the way was Blue Boy.

Merry Christmas and a VERY Prosperous New Year to you all.

Well, you had a nice fancy spaceship. My cousins &amp; I just
turned the porch rocking chairs upside down when at home.
The playground had much better equipment, such as the
merry-go-round, that made a nifty flying saucer spinning
through the galaxy.

We seemed to always be traveling to either Mars or Venus.
Never occured to us to go to the boring, old moon.

just don't get the joy out of childhood that we all seemed
to. While I sometimes wish that I had some of their
advantages, for the most part I'm glad to have been a part
of my era.

Gone are the days of the neighborhood games when children
gathered from blocks around to play Kick the Tin Can, Doctor
Doctor, Mother May I (a form of Simon Says), Crack the Whip,
Red Light Green Light Hope I See a Ghost Tonight, Red Rover
&amp; many others.

Organised sports have taken over the impromptu kickball,
football &amp; baseball games. And they have certainly changed.
My nephew shocked his parents by requesting permission to
take diet pills before a wrestling match for added energy,
as many of the other boys were. Seems his coach is not
interested so much in fair play, skill &amp; sportsmanship as he
is in winning.

"/> Hi Marshall, it's a good thing you didn't, me and the guys ( all of us
about 8-10 years of age) built an underground fort, which from ten feet
away looked like a large ground hog hole. We dug a pit about five feet
deep, roofed it over with old timbers, sheet metal and then a layer of
dirt and sod. We stocked the fort with all the goodies ten year old boys
crave ( cigarettes, junk food and 'nudie' magazines) and all went well
for about three weeks, then it rained for two days. We had taken great
pains to make the roof water tight, but had not thought of ground water
coming in, our fort had become a pool, impossible to bail out and all
our treasures ruined. Man, I love to yarn!

Debbie,

I grew up in a place called &quot;Beautiful Lane&quot; in
suburban Phoenix, Arizona near South Mountain. I never
understood why people called it a mountain when
all it was is a really big hill. You could ride
your bicycle up to the top in about an hour.
We had so much fun playing around the mountain in
the citrus fruit orchards. We had a tree house in
one of the trees and we would often sit and eat
fresh oranges or grapefruits right off our tree.
We would also make up stories about the mean orchard
owner who carried a big knife and killed little
children like us hehe! We would often ride our
bikes up South Mountain and look through the old
copper mines and find old pieces of metal and stuff.
I'm suprised that I was never stung by a black widow
or scorpion or even bitten by a rattlesnake going
into those old mining holes. We had great adventures
in old stone houses with no roofs built by the miners
so long ago.

Now things are more protected and every mine hole we
used to go into is fenced up.

Neighborhood games? We used to play Simon says
hide &amp; seek and red light green light a lot in
the front yard.

Those were the days!

One of the greatest games during my childhood was that flashlight Hide and

to come inside. If no one showed up to play, well it turned into chasing

"/> Ah, kick the can in the moonlight! Those WERE the days. But not all of
those games were as innocent as they seemed. In country school we'd
take turns picking the games to play during recess every day. Drop the
Hankerchief, Pom-pom-pullaway, Annie Annie Over, and such were
innocent. But Stealsticks! There was a game. It was a complicated
system of teams with sticks to steal, a prisoner's base to trap people
in, and many different ways to capture people. If anybody really wants
the rules, I'll explain. But unlike all the other games, perhaps
because it was so complicated, it would become a craze. The sides
wouldn't change, and the hostilities started to carry over into real
life. Ripping sticks out of each others' hands could leave us dripping
blood on our penmanship practice. Every time we got a new teacher, she
or he would let us play for about a month, realize the insidiousness of
it, and ban it completely until the next new innocent teacher could be
conned into thinking it was just another game.

Among the blood and slaughter, I recall one golden moment, when
eight-year-old me squatted to tie my shoe, was unobserved by the tallest
boy in District 21 over the hill, and wrapped myself around his knee. I
trapped their star (a possibly retarded 6'2&quot; sixteen-year-old
eighth-grader.) He dragged me six feet before he realized he'd been
had. Sweet victory for District 19. Sweet even today for the myopic
weakling little girl who usually got picked last for all those games!

I was such a tomboy, but avoided the rougher games whenever
possible.

&gt;&gt;One of the greatest games during my childhood was that flashlight Hide

the

yelling
&gt;&gt;to come inside. If no one showed up to play, well it turned into chasing
&gt;&gt;fireflies and making a lamp out of an old canning jar.....kinda cruel now
&gt;&gt;that I think about those poor bugs with the bright butts!

&gt; In our neighborhood, that in-the-dark hide and seek was called &quot;German
&gt; Spotlight,&quot; which no doubt is un-PC today. Nevertheless, it certainly
&gt; kept the kids entertained. ;-)

&gt; That reminds me: I haven't thought about this in a long time, thanks for
&gt; bringing it
&gt; up. I never asked for a rocketship, there
&gt; are things you didn't ask for in my house
&gt; and you instinctfully knew which things. I
&gt; could ask for notebook paper but not comic books. Anyway, I had a tree
&gt; outside my back door which was my rocketship.
&gt; Certain branches were for the crew and
&gt; of course the center and largest was for
&gt; me ,the Captain. I had boards that I nailed to it that turned so I could
&gt; steer my ship
&gt; and many more boards that I could use for other things like ejecting my
&gt; bro and sis
&gt; when they got in my way. I also had a rope swing so I could escape if I
&gt; was
&gt; invaded by aliens. But after the rope
&gt; broke when I was on it and I broke my
&gt; shoulder my parents had it cut down so
&gt; no one else would get hurt. Thanks for
&gt; bringing that all back to me. Doris

"/> I glad that brought back a good memory for you. I never asked for a
spaceship (didn't think even Santa was that munificent), but I used to
crawl out onto the roof to set up various types of signals so that passing
spaceships would know there was an eager passenger willing to work for
transport. Eventually a neighbor asked my grandmother what type of weird
TV antennas we were trying out and I was busted. Afterwards I'd just
wistfully hang stuff out the windows late at night and grab it back in the
morning, but I KNEW they wouldn't see it.

It's somewhat better than a large packing crate, but it still leaks
during heavy rains. (We'll man the sump pump!) All you'd need is a
cassette toilet ..... some kind of bed ..... some cans of food ...
..... water ....... warm clothes (it is underground) ...... a stove to
heat your food on ....... and whatever else you consider essential. The
access hatch is in our basement.

fairly good at Dodge Ball, too; for a different reason. You see, I've
always thought I'd been a cow pony in a previous life and, as long as I
kept an eye on the ball, I'd not get hit!
