ACLJ and Sekulow file amicus against Newdow

In God we Trust

[excerpts]

[excerpt #1]
It is commonly understood that our Government, its Constitution and its
laws are founded on a belief in God. The mere acknowledgment of God by the
Government or Government officials cannot be said to be an establishment of
religion in violation of the Establishment Clause of the United States
Constitution. Yet this is precisely what is being litigated right now in
the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Dr. Michael Newdow has
sued the United States Congress in order to remove our National Motto. In
his view, these four words constitute the establishment of a national
religion in the United States of America. We think Dr. Newdow is wrong. We
are expressing our opposition through an amicus brief that’s being prepared
now to be filed with the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. In this brief, we
represent 58 members of Congress as well as tens of thousands of citizens
from around the country.

The founders of this nation based a national philosophy on a belief in
deity. The Declaration of Independence and the Bill of Rights locate the
source of inalienable rights in a Creator rather than in Government,
precisely so that such rights cannot be stripped away by Government. In
1782, Thomas Jefferson wrote, “Can the liberties of a nation be thought
secure when we have removed the only firm basis, a conviction in the minds
of the people that these liberties are of the gift of God? That they are
not to be violated but with His wrath?” (Thomas Jefferson: Notes on
Virginia). The founders may have differed over the contours of the
relationship between religion and government, but they never deviated from
the conviction that there was an important and inseparable connection
between the two.

[excerpt #2]
Use of the slogan “In God We Trust” dates back to the War of 1812. In
September of 1814, fearing for the fate of America while watching the
British bombardment of Ft. McHenry in Baltimore, Francis Scott Key composed
the poem, The Star-Spangled Banner, of which one line in the final stanza
is “And this be our motto: ‘In God is our trust.’” Congress codified the
longstanding motto in 1956.

Star-Spangled Banner
Words by Francis Scott Key, (1780)
Music by John Stafford Smith

Oh say can you see by the dawn's early light
What so proudly we hail at the twilight's last gleaming?
Whose broad strips &amp; bright stars, through the perilous fight,
O'er the ramparts we watched, were so gallantly streaming?
And the rockets red glare, the bombs bursting in air,
Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there.
Oh say does that star-spangled banner yet wave
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave?

On the shore, dimly seen through the mists of the deep
Where the foe's haughty host in dread silence reposes,
What is that which the breeze, o'er the towering steep,
As it fitfully blows half conceals, half discloses?
Now it catches the gleam of the morning's first beam,
In full glory reflected now shines on the stream:
Tis the Star-Spangled Banner: Oh, long may it wave
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave.

And where is that band who so vauntingly swore
That the havoc of war and the battle's confusion
A home and a country should leave us no more?
Their blood has washed out their foul footsteps' pollution,
No refuge could save the hireling and slave
from the terror of flight or the gloom of the grave:
And the Star-Spangled Banner in triumph doth wave
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave.

Oh, thus be it ever when freemen shall stand
Between their loved homes and the war's desolation;
Blest with victory and peace, may the heaven-rescued land
Praise the Power that hath made &amp; preserved us as a nation.
Then conquer we must, when our cause is just,
And this be our motto: "In God is our trust"
And the Star-Spangled Banner in triumph shall wave,
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave.

Another in another forum made this observation:

Factoid: The Star-Spangled Banner was not made the official National Anthem
until 1931 ... 25 years before IGWT was made the national motto. I don't
think 25 years qualifies as "long standing" .   ninewands,--  iidb.org

. . . You can't understand a phrase such as "Congress shall make no law
respecting an establishment of religion" by syllogistic reasoning.  Words
take their meaning from social as well as textual contexts, which is why "a
page of history is worth a volume of logic."  New York Trust Co. v. Eisner,
256 U.S. 345, 349, 41 S.Ct. 506, 507, 65 L.Ed. 963 (1921) (Holmes, J.).

USAF LT. COL (Ret) Buffman (Glen P. Goffin) wrote

"You pilot always into an unknown future;
facts are your only clue. Get the facts!"

That philosophy 'snipit' helped to get me, and my crew, through a good
many combat missions and far too many scary, inflight, emergencies.

It has also played a significant role in helping me to expose the
plethora of radical Christian propaganda and lies that we find at
almost every media turn.
