Our kittens were weaned and mom was doing great growling at them.  They got
the point and didn't try to get too snuggly... Until she got fixed.  Now, she
beckons to them and they come a runnin' and jump on like they were babies
again.  They are just shy of 5 months.   Way too old!  We've started with a
squirt bottle but it seems to have no effect.  Anyone have any suggestions?

I remember Hobbes still tried to nestle with his mama after she was spayed.
She would get up and walk away from him. Eventually he got the hint and
outgrew it.

Unfortunately... Momma loves it!  The only hint she's giving is... come and
get it!

She will get tired of it...and the well will run dry sooner or later...it is
probably like a pacifier for them.

Why is this a problem?  If you are going to rehome the kittens, it's not
an issue; if you aren't, it's harmless and, while they may never
completely grow out of it, they will give it up more and more as they
become independent of each other.

I guess our biggest problem was the harm it may cause...

Please quote relevant parts of messages you reply to (and no top posting
either).  People like me who use certain newsreaders that can be synced
with a newsrc file don't download messages read on a different machine - I
read and replied to your message from work, now I'm home and don't have
much of the thread.  I do have my message, so I can figure out what you
are talking about, but it requires closing this message, opening another,
closing it, and reopening this one.  That's a lot of work to make up for
somebody not following standard procedures.

I still don't understand: the kittens are far younger they would normally
be when the mother rejects them, and even adults snuggle up to a mother
figure (in my case, that's an obese neutered male named Tigger - even
middle aged adult cats cuddle with him) so it's unclear how there could be
any harm.

Like I said... we were concerned about any harm... and since it seems like
there is none, I'm no longer going to worry about it.

Thanks to everyone for their help and advice!
