Hello,
I am writing to respectfully ask for some further information. I have
some questions for you which I hope would not offend someone who has
faith in their beliefs, but would welcome the curiosity of others.
Let me first explain something about myself. I am a 35 year old
married man, with 2 children. I am not a young teen who is struggling
with their own identity. However, I do have some troubling spiritual
questions which I feel that I have never really managed to answer.
Your particular faith seems to positively address some of my own
concerns, e.g. environmentalism, respect and tolerance for others and
a desire to positively influence the world around us. However, after
conducting some research, there are a couple of points that I would
like to address.
I am not expecting you to defend your religion. I simply want some
answers about a faith that I find myself increasingly drawn to. I hope
that, if you answer my questions, that you will not find them
offensive in any way as that is not my intention.
Deities.
Is it your belief that the Goddess and God actually exist as entities,
or are they a symbolic representation or focus for the spirituality
that exists in us all? If they DO exist, why would these &quot;higher
entities&quot; require worship from us? After all, we do not require that
animals (as beings of less highly evolved consciousness?) worship us.
Is it possible that the deities are in fact projections, in the same
way that some people believe that poltergeists are the mental projects
of troubled minds (I am not comparing the nature of poltergeists to
the Goddess and God, simply the source)?
Ritual
Why is there heavy reliance on ritual in Wicca? Does this not take
away from the freedom of individual spirituality, or is it to give it
direction and focus?
Spells
I have heard of spells as being &quot;active prayers&quot;. Do you believe that
these prayers are being answered by another consciousness, or are
simply a tool for influencing our environment for good?  I suppose an
analogy would be our influence of air pressure (via the larynx) for
sound and therefore communication.
What about the idea that Gerald Gardner &quot;invented&quot; Wicca in the
1950's, with the help of Aleister Crowley? Do you feel that this
devalues the religion in any way?
I would also like to know how you feel that Wicca seems to be a
matriarchal belief. Does this not create imbalance, in the same way
that Christianity is a patriarchal belief? Is it not discriminatory?
Thank you for your patience in viewing this,
Regards,
John

How odd.This morning, prior to posting, I was researching air magick
and the element. This led Google to the Kabbalah using air in
speech..which led to alchemy and the symbol. Doesn't help *you*
much..it just was another synchronicity I guess.

You are asking Wiccan things so I cannot help in that area. I am a
Trad. Solar and Lunar are equal to me as well as Patriarch and
Matriarch. Both are needed for balance and a Yin Yang combination of
the two can achieve very powerful magick together.

Aree these two concepts really mutually exclusive?
That would depend on how you define &quot;entity&quot;.
Even our perception of one another as human beings is as much a matter of
our own terms of reference as of the objective reality of the &quot;other&quot;. All
deities are to large degree personifications of our subjective perceptions
of abstract spiritual realities. That does not mean that they do not, ast
the same time exist both as sreal entities and as symbols pointing to more
abstract spiritual realities.

If they DO exist, why would these &quot;higher

Do any gods require worship of us, or is there a part of the character of
some of us such that we need to worship.  My cat worships nothing, but even

Now you are opening the door to a discussion of the reality of poltergeists.

I believe that some branches of Dianic Wicca are strongly matriarchal.
Wicca, in general seems to strive for balance; Lord and Lady, God and
Goddess.

Here is a poem by Stevie Smith

Our Bog is Dood

Our Bog is dood, our Bog is dood,
They lisped in accents mild,
But when I asked them to explain
They grew a little wild.
How do you know your Bog is dood
My darling little child?
We know because we wish it so
That is enough, they cried,
And straight within each infant eye
Stood up the flame of pride,
And if you do not think it so
You shall be crucified.
Then tell me, darling little ones,
What's dood, suppose Bog is?
Just what we think, the answer came,
Just what we think it is.
They bowed their heads. Our Bog is ours
And we are wholly his.
But when they raised them up again
They had forgotten me
Each one upon each other glared
In pride and misery
For what was dood, and what their Bog
They never could agree.
Oh sweet it was to leave them then,
And sweeter not to see,
And sweetest of all to walk alone
Beside the encroaching sea,
The sea that soon should drown them all,
That never yet drowned me.

Stevie Smith

Yuu have yet to define &quot;Wicca&quot; you are merely asking about things you
consider to be aspects of it.

There are probly as  many varieties of Wicca as there are Wiccans.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Does this not create imbalance, in the same way

">

Much of religion of what ever sort, is a childish longing for a
supernatural parent figure.  In that primal instinctual awe  of the
universe it is mythologized, and worshiped in various way with many
different words and rites.

Some of the priestly class have had the leisure to discover usually
hidden capacities of the human animal that if they manifest at all,
usually do so only in moments of great crisis, where the human animal
seems almost capable of miracles.

Some argue that this state can be achieved intellectually as well as
spiritually.

But some people just want the social body of a nice nature friendly
religion, are not interested in the more esoteric aspects of a magico -
religious system, and thus we have types of Wicca that are almost
offensive in their superficiality.  But Magick, like every thing else is
based on understanding, being able to understand and not have immovable
blocks to it, thus being able to understand one can understand most things.

That does not mean one can explain or defend every thing, one almost
inevitably develop a sense of &quot;right&quot; and &quot;wrong&quot; for convenience sake
if nothing else.

In a perfect Universe, nothing is in error, but its a very difficult
premise to base a conversation on.

A god or goddess is different than a spirit.

However, both can use ectoplasm to materialize before you.

Where does the ectoplasm come from -- it mostly comes from spiritists.

Some Wiccans, such as myself, consort with many spirits. They act as
our eyes in the spiritual world and also help us with our spells.

The substance of magick and spells can be thought of as a kind of
ectoplasm itself.

I can even materialize before you as spirit-like though I am
incarnate. I need to enter a lucid dreaming state and you need to
donate some ectoplasm.

Usually, when a person reaches this level, they become even more
secretive. But since my duty to the goddess and god is to act as a
teacher, I am exempt from the punishment which comes from revealing
too much.

I know that most students will not be able to accept these teachings
and will deny them.

Thanks,

I really appreciate the help and advice that you have given- it has
been invaluable!

I have been asking the opinions of Wiccans on a number of sites and
message boards. This has been useful in finding out where the wide
ranging beliefs of people across the world converge. I am obviously
not looking for a &quot;template&quot; of belief to follow, just guidance. I
believe that this has helped polarize my own particular beliefs. I
have found the general pagan community (with the exception of two
individuals) very supportive and welcoming.

Since realising that Wicca is the correct path for me, I obviously
have been continuing my research into its history and practice. I have
found www.glasstemple.com particularly useful. I don't know if you are
aware of the site and whether the information there seems to ring true
with you?

Once I am more confident in the background of Wicca (terminology, when
the Sabbats are, etc), I will try and make contact with like-minded
people in my area. Hopefully, their own experiences will help me in
developing my own relationship with the God and Goddess.

Thank you so much again for you support and help,

Blessed Be,

John
