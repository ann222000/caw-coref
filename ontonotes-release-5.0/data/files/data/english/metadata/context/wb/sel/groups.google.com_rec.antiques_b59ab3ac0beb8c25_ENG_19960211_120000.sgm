"/> Talk about coincidences. Dan Patnode had asked this question a couple
of months ago, and yesterday I was in a Royal Doulton outlet, so I
inquired.

Old Country Roses (by Royal Albert) has been in production since 1962.
I was almost certain it was older than this, but it's been verified.

Another example of how things are often much newer than we think.
