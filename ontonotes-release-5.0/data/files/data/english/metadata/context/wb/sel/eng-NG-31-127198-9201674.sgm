Yup.  Assuming Mizzou, WVU, ASU, 'SC, BC, and LSU win this weekend,
here's how it will probably come down to:

MNCG: Mizzou v. WVU
Fiesta: UGA v. ASU
Rose: 'SC v. tOSU
Orange: BC v. KU
Sugar: LSU v. Hawaii

And the best part is, you know LSU is going to be down for this game,
and Hawaii will be up for it, and will sneak in the win.

(At which point, we'll all say that since SEC &gt;&gt; BIG 10 last year,

I do think LSU will wax Hawaii in the Sugar Bowl, but I bet LSU
wouldn't go play the Rainbow Warriors in Honolulu.

And if Tennessee happens to win the SEC, Hawai'i might actually beat
them.

What?  I don't think we can say that until AFTER the bowl games.  If
Georgia, Tennesse and LSU get destroyed in their bowl games, I don't
think too many people will want to argue that the SEC is the best
conference.  After all, they are getting their reputation off of
beating each other.  I'm not saying their reputation isn't deserved,
but I'm not saying it is, either.

&gt;&gt; This post warmed my heart for two reasons...  first, because I hadn't heard
&gt;&gt; this news already.

&gt;&gt; Second, because I enjoy watching uptight blowhard fans of &quot;established&quot;

&gt;I do think LSU will wax Hawaii in the Sugar Bowl,

Once it hits OT, LSU is dooooooomed.  Also, they will need to try to
play some of that defense stuff again.

Strength of schedule. None of the teams they beat have beaten *anyone*
in the top 30.

But if they beat Washington soundly, I think they might belong.
Washington at least beat a top-30 team...whoops, I take it back. They
beat Boise State, which is supposedly number 28. The same Boise State
that is Hawaii's marquee win....

Hawaii's schedule stinks to high heaven.

why not just say they are tied with the Patriots as the #1 team in the
NFL? It would make only slightly less sense.

If team A doesn't play the same level of competition as team B, you
can't compare team A's record to team B.

Hawaii may go to a BCS bowl and win it. But they still wouldn't have
deserved the bid.

whether a team wins or loses a BCS game has zero to do with whether they

if we take the BCS seriously (absurd, sure, but ...), then the deserving
teams are the ones ranked 1-10 in the final BCS standings. any team that
isn't ranked in the top 10 is getting in by some special
consideration, such as &quot;conference champs are automatically in&quot; or &quot;if a
WAC/MAC is in the top 12, it is automatically in&quot;, or &quot;if Notre Dame is
in the top 14...&quot;, etc.

Hawaii is a Football Bowl Subdivision team.

Until that changes, the schedule is only relevant to those in the
cabal who intend to keep this crooked cabal going.

Because they're not in the NFL -- they're in the Football Bowl
Subdivision.

And if they went 16-0 in the NFL with an inferior schedule, they'd be
treated as a 16-0 record would get them -- a #1 seed in their
conference, a first-round bye, and home field advantage until the
Super Bowl.

THe only real solutions are either to give them a title shot or

That's not even logical or rational.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the issue is whether they deserve to be in the game to begin with.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;and they don't.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Why?
&gt;&gt;&gt;Because they haven't beaten BCS conference competition. Their game with
&gt;&gt;&gt;Washington will be their first game vs. a BCS team. And Washington is
&gt;&gt;&gt;hardly representative of good BCS competition.
&gt;&gt;&gt;Hey, if we're going to invite Hawaii to a BCS bowl without having beaten
&gt;&gt;&gt;any good BCS competition, why not invite them to the NFL playoffs as well?
&gt;&gt; Because they're not in that league
&gt;they aren't in a 'BCS league' either you dumbshit. they are in the same
&gt;NCAA league as teams like usc, but BCS bowls are run by the BCS, not the
&gt;NCAA.

They don't all play in Division 1-A football, Mr Jaros?  You see,
there IS NO &quot;BCS League&quot;, but there most certainly is &quot;Division 1-A&quot;.
So did you have an actual argument, or did you want to try to maintain
this silliness on your part?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;if they don't play BCS competition why should they automatically qualify
&gt;for a BCS bowl?

If they're in Division 1-A, they're in Division 1-A.  THAT is the
league.
