The Gospel of St Michaels

i. The feast was laid out before them and they saw that it was good.
ii. And the fruit of the vine was imbibed by all present.
iii. And the unleavened bread was covered in every savoury manner including
whey, salted fish, and peanut butter.
iv. Luke said unto him, Lord, whither goest thou? Jesus answered him,
Whither I go, thou canst not follow me now; but thou shalt follow me
afterwards.
v. Luke said unto him, Lord, why cannot I follow thee now? I will lay down
my life for thy sake.
vi. And there was a cry of "arse-licker" from across the hall, but those
assembled could not discover the source.
vii. Then John did produce some papyrus sheets with markings of a salacious
nature; for he was a real man and definitely not a girl no matter what the
others might say.
viii. And as they did eat, Jesus took bread, and blessed, and brake it, and
gave to them, and said, Take, eat: this is my body.
ix. And he took the cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them:
and they all drank of it.
x. And he said unto them, this is my blood of the new testament, which is
shed for many.
xi. And Matthew said "Got any Lager?".
xii. But Jesus's reply was lost because Judas had produced an emission of
such ferocity that it rendered all else inaudible.
xiii. And Jesus did say unto the assembled mass "Where is Mary, my
companion?".
xiv. And Mark said "By companion - do you mean spouse?".
xv. And Jesus said "No. If I meant spouse, I would have said spouse".
xvi. And Mark said "I saw her going into Weatherspoons earlier. She looked
in a right mood".
xvii. Then cometh he to Simon Peter: and Peter saith unto him, Lord, dost
thou wash my feet?
xviii. Jesus answered and said unto him, What I do thou knowest not now; but
thou shalt know hereafter.
xix. And the waiter did say "Come on you two; you've had enough. I'm going
to hire you a donkey".
xx. And the bill arrived with little ceremony.
xxi. And John did say "I didn't have a starter" conveniently forgetting his
side-salad.
