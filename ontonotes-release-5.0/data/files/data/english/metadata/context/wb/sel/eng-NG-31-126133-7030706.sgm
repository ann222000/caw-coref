I was expecting ELL to provide the synopsis when he started his "Bleach
110, in a nutshell" thread.  However, he ended up being transfixed like a
deer in a couple of headlights (no offense - it was a good picture) ^-^, so
I thought I'd do the honors.

Yes, the Blount filler arc is over and we're back to the manga story line.
We pick it back up around chapter 183 in tankoubon volume 21.  The episode
covers chapters 183 through 185 in their entirety and hits the beginning of
chapter 186.  There are spoilers.  However, the spoilers pretty much
introduce the new conflict and are not crucial ones.  The huge spoilers are
in the episode (111) synopsis which I'm finishing up and should have posted
tonight or tomorrow.  If you haven't seen episode 111 or read chapters
186-187 of the manga, I recommend that you not read the episode 111
synopsis and spoil the dramatic revelations.

After the opening theme gets your blood circulating, you hear some eerie
music and see the sand, craggy rocks, and lengthening shadows in Hueco
Mundo – the realm of the hollows.

The scene shifts to a dungeon at the bottom of a deep shaft.  Imprisoned
inside it is a grotesque figure completely wrapped in bandages like a
mummy.   The creature flexes its muscles obliterating the bandages.  We see
that it wears the mask of a hollow.  The mask's jaws opens.  Inside the
gaping mask we see part of a tattooed face, including his eyes, nose, and
mouth.  With malice in his voice, he speaks someone's name – Kurosaki
Ichigo.

Although he has changed, we recognize this being.  He looks like the hollow
Grand Fisher who killed Ichigo’s mother and whom Ichigo fought and defeated
in episode 9.  Bam!

"Bleach 110" explodes on the screen.  The filler arc is officially over.

The grim landscape of Hueco Mundo is replaced by blue skies and the sun
shining down on Karakura High School.  It seems like a normal day – school
is resuming after a break.  Ichigo walks nonchalantly.  He says hello to
Mizuiro.  The hyperactive Keigo runs into Ichigo's arm which he just
'happened' to raise at the wrong moment.  Keigo, lying on the ground,
barely conscious, says, "Next time, I'll show you!"  Ichigo walks off
muttering, "I swear!  It's the same every time.  It's no use - he never
learns!"

Ichigo goes over to where Chad, Orihime, and Ishida are hanging out.  This
sends Keigo into an apoplectic fit wondering what strange circumstances
caused such disparate types to group together.  Ichigo snubs Keiko sending
him packing.  Then Chizuru grabs Orihime from behind in a tight,
affectionate hug.  Chizuru’s face is full of blissful rapture.  It's at
this point, we lose ELL.

Nevertheless, the story is not over.  Chizuru's blissful rapture is
interrupted as Tatsuki's roundhouse kick to her head sends her flying
across the room.  Chizuru praises Tatsuki for a magnificent comeback.
Tatsuki says it wasn't a comeback - just a kick.  Then we have a
magnificent line that I hope will make it on Cartoon Network.

Tatsuki:  I swear!  Even though it's now fall, I have to pull you off like
a rutting stag.

(If anyone sees any of the fansubs, tell us how they translate this line.)

This preamble has refreshed our memories regarding the Karakura High School
classmates and their quirks.  Tatsuki reminds Ichigo of the vacation
assignment which, of course, he hasn't done.  Then she notices a charm he's
wearing and asks about it.  Ichigo has a flashback to the morning when he
tries to return a protection charm to his father.  The father, in a
slapstick comedy scene, says he doesn't need it and forcibly sews it on
Ichigo's shirt.  He tells Tatsuki that he's not to blame – it's his idiot
father's doing.  Tatsuki tells him she knew that already.  She'd been
around his family long enough to know how they operated.

It turns out that Tatsuki was asking about the Shinigami badge that no one
was supposed to be able to see.  Before Ichigo has to explain himself, he's
rescued by the teacher who tells everyone to take their seats.  She goes on
to say she's going to introduce a new transfer student.  Before she's able
to do so, the fab four senses the presence of a hollow outside.  Ichigo is
the first to rush out claiming it's a toilet emergency.  Chad and Inoue
follow.  The teacher yells after them and they repeat Ichigo's excuse which
leads to some more great dialog.

Teacher:  Liars!  At least Inoue!  Girls are told to hold it in and bear it
until their stomachs begin to hurt.
Orihime:  It does hurt!  It feels like pee or something is starting to
leak.

The hyperactive Keigo follows trying to use the leaking excuse but the
teacher collars him.  While all this commotion is going on, Tatsuki glances
out the window and sees Ichigo in Shinigami form crossing the playground.

Eyecatch!

It turns out the hollow is small fry that yells 'beef' in Japanese and
'pork' in English.  Ichigo dispatches it with a nonchalant swing of his
sword.  He tells Orihime and Chad there didn't seem to be a reason for them
to cut class, too.  Orihime cheerfully says she just wanted one time to try
to skip out using the lavatory excuse.  Chad said that excuses are well and
good but he thinks Orihime carried it a bit too far.

Orihime then turns serious and observes Ishida stayed back.  They talk
about having been back two weeks and Ishida still not having regained his
powers.  Ichigo gives him a vote of confidence saying he'll find a way to
cope - hat he'd always managed with or without his powers.  As they leave,
we catch a glimpse of an upside down grinning young man in the sky – but
Ichigo and company do not.  Some people have said the grinning young man
looks like Beavis from "Beavis and Butthead".

Keeping us in suspense as to who he really is, we switch to the Urahara
shop where we learn that Claude, Ririn, and Nova are going to be
freeloading there.  Since they’re no longer needed as Bount sensors, they
need a place to hang out.

Back at school where Ichigo and friends have rejoined their classmates, a
cheeky transfer student is explaining the kanji in his name beginning with
平 (hei – level, tranquil) which he says is the same kanji as in 助平 (sukebei
– lecher).  What's more, he's written his name mirror-reversed.  When his
oversight is pointed out to him, he says topsy-turvy is his specialty.
Yes, he is none other than our upside down Beavis, except his real name is
平子真子 Hirako Shinji (last name first).  You'll have to hold the kanji up to
a mirror to see how he wrote it on the blackboard.

Shinji sits down near Ichigo and says, "It looks like we're neighbors.
Let's get along well with one another, Kurosaki Ichigo."

That evening back at the Kurosaki domicile, a rowdy and irritated Kon is
complaining about being cooped up.  He wants to borrow Ichigo's body so he
can go out and flip up girls skirts, be a peeping Tom, and engage in other
nefarious activities.  He blatantly admits to using Ichigo's body as an
alibi.  As a distraught Ichigo begs him to say he's just joking, the
Shinigami badge lights up.

An overly trusting Ichigo transfers Kon's spirit into his body and naively
tells him to behave.  As Shinigami Ichigo goes hollow hunting, Kon in
Ichigo's body prepares to have a night on the town.

After Ichigo easily dispatches the first hollow, a Shinigami who identifies
himself as Kurumadani Zennosuke appears.  Apparently, he was sent as
Rukia's replacement after she was taken into custody.  He tells Ichigo he
is one of the elite but Ichigo can tell he's pretty much clueless.

While Ichigo is trying to explain to clueless about his Shinigami badge,
Beavis, I mean, Shinji, sneaks up behind him and tries to sucker-punch him
with a Zanpakutou.  Ichigo's fast reflexes save him.  Startled, Ichigo
demands who he is and asks what he's doing with a Zanpakutou sword.

Shinji, who speaks in the Kansai dialect, tells him to keep it down.  He
says someone who has as much reiatsu (spirit pressure) as Ichigo should
keep a lower profile.  He says the reiatsu will reverberate through the
world and alert others.  Ichigo wants to know whom he might alert but
Shinji mutters to himself that it should be intuitively obvious as the
camera shows us Orihime, Chad, Ishida, and some mean-looking hollows
slipping through openings between their realm and the human world.

A Menos Grande attacks Ishida.  The transformed Grand Fisher we saw at the
beginning of the show attacks, mistaking him for Ichigo – serves Kon right
for using Ichigo's body to wander around town looking to get into some
mischief.

Ichigo still has his hands full with Shinji.  Rukia’s elite replacement,
Zennosuke, is hanging on a gutter trying not to fall to the pavement.  He's
amazed at the intense reiatsu of Ichigo and Shinji.

Ichigo continues to pester Shinji for information.  He finally gives in,
produces something and says, “Look what I’ve got.”  Ichigo guesses
correctly that it’s a hollow mask.  He then brandishes his Zanpakutou and
tells Ichigo that he should understand.

While Ichigo is having flashbacks of his inner hollow taking over, Shinji
proclaims himself to be a Vaizaado (Vizard) – a Shinigami who has intruded
into the domain of the hollow.  Shinji then reminds Ichigo that he had
asked him in class to be friends (using a term that is frequently used with
comrades in arms.)  He says that, as a Vizard, he and Ichigo are two of a
kind – kindred spirits.  He tells Ichigo to switch sides and come over to
his side.

Talking about switching, we now switch to Ishida fighting the Menos Grande.
Ishida, still has a few tricks up his sleeve – gadgets that he filled with
reiatsu while he was at Soul Society.  However, the Menos Grande is a
crafty adversary and splits into two parts evading Ishida’s counter-attack.
As the Menos Grande prepares to deliver the finishing blow, Ishida is
rescued by an unexpected savior.

The savior's identity is disclosed at the end of

I thought they might misinterpret this.  The anime uses the term
sakarippanashi.  Sakari, by itself, can mean both 'in full bloom' or 'to be
in heat', 'to rut', etc.  The term sakarippanashi as a combination word
refers to separating a rutting male from a female in heat.  I'm running out
of time.  Tomorrow, I'll post the Japanese kanji, romaji, and translation.
It's a priceless line of dialog.
