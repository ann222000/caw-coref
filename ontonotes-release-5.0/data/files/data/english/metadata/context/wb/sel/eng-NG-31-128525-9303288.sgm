Just thought I'd come say Good Night to everyone. I'm on my way to bed now. I'll check in again in the morning. Hope everyone has a great night. Please know that I'm praying for everyone who reads this. I love you all. Good Night for now.

If you want to get in touch with me privately, you can. All your e-mails are important to me. I don't open forwards, or e-mails that are titled with No Subject. I hope everyone has a really great day. My favorite verses are Matthew 11:28-30. Have a great day everyone. I love you all.

Smile Because Jesus Loves You And So Do I

Angel Grubaugh

Today's Verse
December 8, 2007

Verse:

I tell you, whoever acknowledges me before men, the Son of Man will also acknowledge him before the angels of God.
Luke 12:8

Thoughts:

What a simple way to inherit a blessing. Let's make sure that we don't fall into the trap of Peter during the night of Jesus' arrest -- strong when in the presence of friends and weak in the presence of those who are hostile. Let's be ready to share our faith with friends with &quot;gentleness and respect&quot; (1 Pet. 3:15). Let's be willing to be openly identified as one of Jesus' disciples and show it by our words and deeds. Let's confess that Jesus is our Lord by our lives and our lips for all the world to see.
.Prayer:

Dear God, give me courage and wisdom to appropriately acknowledge Jesus as Lord before my friends, co-workers, and colleagues in a way that honors Christ and that is respectful of them. In Jesus' name I pray. Amen.

Our Daily Bread

December 8, 2007

Are We Selling Out?
Bible in One Year: Daniel 8-10; 3 John
READ: Hebrews 12:12-17

Looking carefully . . . lest there be any . . . profane person like Esau, who for one morsel of food sold his birthright. Hebrews 12:15-16

Have we “sold out” the way Esau did? (Heb. 12:16). Has the lure of wealth, power, prestige, position, security, style, or the approval and praise of others led us to barter away God’s riches for a single meal?
Esau sought to change his father’s mind and gain the inheritance he had forfeited by his duplicity, but he could not set right the damage he had done. He had to live with his decision. Neither can we turn back the clock and undo the wrong we have done to ourselves and to others.

Although the past is irrevocable, there can be a new day before us, filled with new chances, new opportunities, and new expectations. God will not redo the past, but when we repent He can and will forgive us and set us on a new path.

The Lord can give us opportunities to show how we have truly repented of the decisions of the past and how much we long to serve Him in the decisions to come. He will never mention the deeds by which we’ve shamed others and ourselves; they are forgiven and forgotten forever.

God will give us a place to begin again—to love, to serve, to touch others profoundly and eternally for His sake. This demonstrates the greatness of our heavenly Father’s forgiving love to us.
—David H. Roper

Dear Lord, be merciful to me;
My sin has grieved Your heart;
And grant to me Your strength anew
To make a fresh, new start. —D. De Haan

God’s forgiveness is the door to a new beginning.

Messages in this topic (1) 4. WHO IS LEADING? Posted by: &quot;Mary Ann&quot; serenity72000@yahoo.com serenity72000 Fri Dec 7, 2007 11:03 pm (PST)

&quot;O Lord , I know that the way of man is not in himself: it is not in man that walketh to direct his steps&quot; (Jer. 10:23).

&quot;Lead me in a plain path&quot; (Ps. 27:14).

Many people want to direct God, instead of resigning themselves to be directed by Him; to show Him a way, instead of passively following where He leads. --Madame Guyon

I said: &quot;Let me walk in the field&quot;;
God said: 'Nay, walk in the town&quot;;
I said: &quot;There are no flowers there&quot;;
He said: &quot;No flowers, but a crown.&quot;

I said: &quot;But the sky is black,
There is nothing but noise and din&quot;;
But He wept as He sent me back,
&quot;There is more,&quot; He said, &quot;there is sin

I said: &quot;But the air is thick,
And fogs are veiling the sun&quot;;
He answered: &quot;Yet souls are sick,
And souls in the dark undone.&quot;

I said: &quot;I shall miss the light,
And friends will miss me, they say&quot;;
He answered me, &quot;Choose tonight,
If I am to miss you, or they.&quot;

I pleaded for time to be given;
He said: &quot;Is it hard to decide?
It will not seem hard in Heaven
To have, followed the steps of your Guide.&quot;

I cast one look at the fields,
Then set my face to the town;
He said: &quot;My child, do you yield?
Will you leave the flowers for the crown?&quot;

Then into His hand went mine,
And into my heart came He;
And I walk in a light Divine,
The path I had feared to see.

To: anand mohan &lt;&gt;

Dear Uncle,

I need your powerful Intercessory prayers because the due date for my wife's delivery is any time the next few days. The doctor has told that the head of the baby is not fixed and the liquid level is less.

But whatever the doctor says God has the final word. So I request you to intercede and pray as per Math18:19 for my wife's safe and healthy normal delivery and we prefer a boy.

Also, pray for good health for my wife to endure the delivery and God's Protective cover &amp; Anointing upon me, my wife and my first Kid also during this important time of the year.

Thank you for your Intercessory and power prayers!.

Thanking You,
Sincerely Yours,

Messages in this topic (3) 6. SET YOUR HOUSE IN ORDER Posted by: &quot;Mary Ann&quot; serenity72000@yahoo.com serenity72000 Fri Dec 7, 2007 11:16 pm (PST)

HeavenSprings (Original Message)
&quot;Set Your House In Order&quot;

&quot;In those days was Hezekiah sick unto death. And Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz came unto him, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Set thine house in order: for thou shalt die, and not live.&quot; Isaiah 38:1

The Lord sent the prophet Isaiah to King Hezekiah when he was sick to tell him to get his house in order because he was going to die. Our word is.. &quot;set your house in order&quot;. I am not saying that the Lord has told me you are going to die, none of us know when that time will come. We aren't promised tomorrow- it could happen today. Jesus told us our time was always at hand.

Setting our house in order is something that we should attend to everyday. Each day I make sure the physical house that I live in is in order- it's not full of trash, cluttered, dirty, things work properly and it's not in disarray. How much more important is it that I make sure daily that my &quot;heart house&quot; is in order. We should never neglect to make sure that &quot;all is well&quot;.

How do we get our house in order? First, we make sure that we have a relationship with God through the blood of Jesus Christ. After that we make sure our house is in order by confessing and repenting of any known sin. We ask the Lord to search us and see if there is any &quot;wicked way&quot; in us. We don't neglect so great a salvation, we work out our salvation with fear and trembling, we make sure we love the Lord with all our heart and not have any other Gods before Him.

I need to make sure daily that there is nothing in my life that is displeasing to the Lord, nothing that will hinder my relationship with Him, nothing that will come between us when I stand before Him. I need to make sure that daily I walk before Him with clean hands and a pure heart. Daily I need to make sure that He occupies the throne of my heart and I decrease so that He can increase. It's in this way that I make sure my heart house is in order. Are you doing that? We must do it and not neglect it. It would be bad for Him to come and find our house &quot;out of order&quot;.

Make sure everyday that your house is in order. Is it today?

this. He needs the Lord and I tell him I care and he is very suprised that I
show him the Love of our Lord. Pray that I have wisdom in dealing with him.
I am loosing skin on my fingers again and I have blisters and he will not

wisdom. I ask you please and thank you so much in advance

Messages in this topic (1) 9. Life Is A Journey Posted by: &quot;Mary Ann&quot; serenity72000@yahoo.com serenity72000 Fri Dec 7, 2007 11:40 pm (PST)

Life Is A Journey
Life is a journey through many terrain
From gardens of pleasure to deserts of pain
From an ocean of love to a jungle of hate
From mountains of glory to canyons of fate

There's a highway for joy and a highway for sorrow
A road for today and a road for tomorrow
So choose your path wisely and walk with care
If you follow your heart, you'll find your way there

I've been to the garden and planted seeds there
I've been to the desert and felt the despair
I've swam in the ocean and drank of it's wine

I climbed up the mountain to touch the sky
I went to the canyon and started to cry
I've traveled both highways,
Both today and tomorrow
I've basked in the joy and wallowed in sorrow

My path has been chosen and
I've walked it with care
I followed my heart and I'm on my way there
So I'll just keep walking till I find what I'm after
To mountains and oceans and
Gardens of laughter.

&gt; Just a short note. Continue to keep me in your prayers. I am still having
&gt; trouble applying weight to my knee and leg. The pain is high. On a scale from
&gt; 1 to 10, pain is about 9.5!
&gt;
&gt; I am getting on line for about two to three at a time, but that is all I
&gt; can handle. God has bless me so I can get my emails caught up.
&gt;
&gt; I am very limited to motion with the knee. The doctor said no climbing,
&gt; bending, squatting, prolong walking, or standing. Boy, now that takes care of
&gt; everything, but lying down and in my recliner.
&gt; Still cannot sleep in bed yet. Cannot take the pressure of light blanket or

&gt;
&gt; I do not like to complain, but I do not like this kind of pain either!!!

Subject: ***Wonderful Praise Report Re Baby Matthew!!***

Laura, little Matthew's grandma...and our dear sister...sends this incredible
praise report regarding Matthew! Hallelujah!! Thank you so, Lord Jesus!!!
Thank each of you for praying as you have, and thank you in advance for
continued 'totally believing, no doubting' prayer...according to Psalm 107:22
Amplified version...which is written out below this praise to Him:

Laura writes:

As you know, the Genetics Clinic of Childrens Mercy Hospital told my daughter
that Matthew's 17th chromosome was abnormal and deformed. The 17th chromosome
is what predisposes what type serious diseases one will get throughout life,
which would be pretty grim for our little one if it were deformed.
Well! After prayer, a batter of tests has been run, and those tests have
determined that baby Matthew's 17th chromosome is no longer abnormal and deformed,
but...perfectly normal and well formed!!!.
PRAISE GOD!!!!!! PRAISE OUR AWESOME GOD!!! Thank YOU all for BEING SO
FAITHFUL IN YOUR PRAYERS!
It was also determined that the damage sustained during Matthew's birth
happened thus: during each contraction Athena had during labor, the contraction
didn't let up; instead the intensity became stronger and stronger, but didn't
allow her cervix to dilate completely. To add to this, her doctor was giving her
some medications to increase her labor, and as he was reading the instruments
he said that the machines were wrong...and gave her even more
medications...but the machines were not wrong, but correct. This went on for two and a half
days, until her body just quit and her labor stopped. In essence little Matthew
was being crushed by her uterus, which is why damage has been scattered

labor stopped because God stopped it, to save Matthew. Praise God...
We are seeing small improvements every day, and know that because of your
prayers, because of our Lord on our side, Matthew is going to be just fine.
God Bless You All,

DEAR PRAYER PARTNERS,

1) THE LORD HAS ANSWERED OUR PRAYERS concerning unauthorized purchases
against our debit card. You may remember a transaction review last Saturday
revealed someone in New Jersey (we live in Florida) made purchases of $427.00 and
$504.59 at a Toys-R-Us store on our debit card. After completing a Sheriffâ€™s
report, filing a sworn affidavit and completing several credit union forms, our
account was credited back yesterday for these amounts, PTL! The investigation
continues concerning who did this â€“ please PRAY FOR THEM and their salvation
and that God might ASSIST THOSE CONDUCTING THE INVESTIGATION. God Bless you
for your faithfulness to pray for others.

2) Paula Grimes brought by a dear brother in Christ to see me yesterday
afternoon. Some of you may remember, JEFF FREDRICK, owner of Rehabilitation
Engineering in Tallahassee, FL which was sold to J.E. Hanger a few years ago. As
of November 20th Jeff has returned to the Tallahassee community from
Gainesville, FL to reestablish his business. Jeff is a very committed Christian with
what I affectionately refer to as the â€œspirit of the Apostle Paulâ€ in his zeal
to serve Jesus Christ. It was great to see him again and it seemed to us
there had been no years of separation. Please pray for JEFF, HIS FAMILY LIFE and
WORK LIFE and MINISTRY. He continues to do great things for our Lord and as
you can imagine the war being waged against him is great. In His Love, Brother
Bruce.

From: cardinal@riverview.net

Thank you for the continued prayers and we are home from the pacer/defib.
clinic. So far so good with alot of healing to do ...Said it will take 2 months
to get this really inplanted and scar tissue built up around it. They have
ordered a new carelink system as his new device is wireless..meaning when we
received this machine..we will take the wand and go over his pacer and it will go
over the phone lines and put him into the Carelink system... we will then set
it in the bedroom and when he walks by it it will pick up signals if anything
is wrong with it and transmit it to them and they in turn will call the Heart
center and then call us. Every morning at 10:10 a.m. it goes thru a check
system no matter where he is and if anything is wrong will transmit a signal to
them too.....amazing what technology can do......wow........ so he is to be very
careful for the next month and we go back into the clinic on Feb. 4, 2008 ...
so all prayers are greatly appreciated and we thank God for His awesome care
and Divine healing.He is super tired and trying to pick up some kind of
bug.like we need something else.........lol
God Bless you all and our prayers for your needs too

Good morning---
Just an update on my Dad (Ray Riley), he is doing OK---after an X-ray
yesterday they determined he now has pneumonia and is also having a swallowing
problem. Dad is getting a new antibiotic in his IV and they have put some kind of
&quot;thickening&quot; substance in his liquids ( coffee, water, soup) apparently he is
having trouble with swallowing liquids more than solid food. So----------I
guess we see how this all works out. He will be in the hospital at least until
Wednesday, when they might send him back to the nursing home.
Thanks for all the prayers---they have been a tremendous help to all of us!!

Please add: Bob Marx to the prayer list---he is a Physician serving as a
hospital commander in Iraq and is having a rough time right now with depression.
His first Grandchild was born in November and he will not get to see the
Grandson until early summer. His wife, Becky, is a close friend of mine. I ask tha
t you keep this family in prayer.

Also Beecher Klingensmith---did very well with his prostate surgery and no
cancer was found. He is very relieved and appreciates the prayers. Thanks you!

Have a wonderful day and GOD BLESS !!!

Subject: Update On Me (Jerry)

I saw the doctor today and he is going to run several more test, but after
these past month of physical therapy and my continued pain being unable to
&quot;pass&quot; the physical exam concerning weakness in my arms, it is now obvious that
there is some serious damage to a nerve or nerves in my spine.

He greatly increased my pain medication and is setting me up an appointment
with a neurologist for further testing to determine the exact level of nerve
damage and what we need to do next. This is going to be a long and drawn out
process. Therapy has helped, but the traction did nothing but make matters
worse. It was the next logical step to try, but I won't be having therapy anymore.
The neurologist is a very skilled and well respected surgeon, so if that's
what I need, he can take care of me. Unfortunately, it will be late January at
the earliest before he can see me. Who knows how long all the test he will order
will take.

Thankfully, this is not a life threatening problem; just one of being
miserable. The doctor scolded me for not letting him know my pain medication wasn't
really helping. So, hopefully with the new and stronger medication, I will not
suffer needlessly.

I KNOW the Lord will bring about healing in His good time. Just pray for me
that I can keep a positive outlook on life until then. It's easy to get weary
and depressed when a person is in severe and constant pain.

I will not be bringing all of this up anymore except to give updates when
something changes. I count my blessings and will humbly seek to be a blessing to
others. If you would be so kind, forward this update to those who you have
shared my prayer requests with.

Your loving brother and friend,

Subj: Baby Callie: Details of surgeries; holding strong!.... God's Hand!

December 07, 2007 at 05:23 PM PST nccmommy@yahoo.com

Callie is still holding strong. She kept on spiking a low grade temp and have
had her on a cooling blanket. Poor thing was shivering for days. We finally
talked them into turning it off just to see if her not shivering would help
keep her core temp low and it seemed to help.
Some people had asked how the surgeons knew that her bowels were necrotic.
We've bombarded you with little pieces of information over those hellish five
days and I know we probably weren't clear. Callie went in for a routine surgery
to correct a perforated bowel. When the opened her up, according to one of the
doctors there, they were overwhelmed with the stench of decomposing tissue.
Many of her bowels were necrotic (dead); and most were borderline-necrotic. Dr.
Hanley was called in from another surgery to confirm what they were seeing.
Other attending docs came in. Apparently, I was told one had cried.
They were going to start cutting away at all the tissue but Hanley had
stopped them telling them to close her up and see if she survives 48 hours. She
couldn't live with as much tissue as they were wanting to cut. During that time,
Callie didn't die, Callie lived, and fought. She thrashed and thrashed in pain
from her intestines decomposing within her. They hit her with every medication
they could to completely sedate her. Enough to knock out an adult several
times and it didn't even make a dent on Callie. For all you medical folks,
through all this, Callie's lactate level never rose above 2. Callie's colostomy
stump also became necrotic and black. There was one unusual thing that happened.
Maybe there is a medical explanation or maybe not. The day after they closed
Callie up and gave her 48 hours to live. There were red spots and blotches on
Callie's lower abdomen. They thought it was a rash, or worse, and abcess. The
doctors circled them with pen. The red dots began to migrate across her stomach,
lighten, and then disappear. Part of me thinks that was God healing her.
Ultimately, when they went in and found most tissue alive and pink, they had to
only removed two thirds of the colon. She will need a simple connective surgery
in three months. Dr. Hanley said this will not limit her physically in any way
and that there is no reason to think she will not have normal bowel function
once this is all said and done.
One other thing I forgot to share during this whole ordeal is that the
Immunology Dept. came down and dismissed Callie from their service because her
immune system was &quot;almost normal&quot; and getting better. Not too shabby for the child
born without a thymus. Right now, in front of me is a child with a hard and
painful recovery ahead of her. I am reminded that I have to get back to putting
my nose to the grindstone in prayer to get her through this. This time with
renewed faith and fervour as I feel God has given us His opinion on the issue.
Sometimes God will have us labor to build something together in prayer instead
of handing it to us all at once. I do still pray He will decide to heal her
entirely. He's proven that's not a problem. I feel Callie's intercessors are as
a big a part of building this testimony as Joe and I are, even Callie. The was
one word I got before God healed Callie. I was grieving the situation and I
didn't understand what it meant at the time: &quot;I had to take you this far so you
would know it was Me&quot;. I understand that now. Please continue to pray for
Callie. I don't profess to understand what is going on. I know the road ahead may
be hard. I know we are in the center of His will though. God bless you all.
Please cover Callie in your prayers tonight as she is frightened and in pain.
There is rumor of extubation after the weekend.
Love,
Karen

Just a short note. Continue to keep me in your prayers. I am still having
trouble applying weight to my knee and leg. The pain is high. On a scaleÂ  from 1
to 10, pain is about 9.5!

I am getting on line for about two toÂ  three at a time, but that is all I can
handle. God has bless me so I can get my emails caught up.

I am very limited to motion with the knee. The doctor said no climbing,
bending, squatting, prolong walking, or standing. Boy, now that takes care of
everything, but lying down and in my recliner.
Still cannot sleep in bed yet. Cannot take the pressure of light blanket or
sheet on knee.

I do not like to complain, but I do not like this kind of pain either!!!

Thanks to all my friends fro praying!!!

Be blessed,
Bro. Skip

&gt;
&gt; Laura, little Matthew's grandma...and our dear
&gt; sister...sends this incredible
&gt; praise report regarding Matthew! Hallelujah!! Thank
&gt; you so, Lord Jesus!!!
&gt; Thank each of you for praying as you have, and thank
&gt; you in advance for
&gt; continued 'totally believing, no doubting'
&gt; prayer...according to Psalm 107:22
&gt; Amplified version...which is written out below this
&gt; praise to Him:
&gt;
&gt; Laura writes:
&gt;
&gt; As you know, the Genetics Clinic of Childrens Mercy
&gt; Hospital told my daughter
&gt; that Matthew's 17th chromosome was abnormal and
&gt; deformed. The 17th chromosome
&gt; is what predisposes what type serious diseases one
&gt; will get throughout life,
&gt; which would be pretty grim for our little one if it
&gt; were deformed.
&gt; Well! After prayer, a batter of tests has been run,
&gt; and those tests have
&gt; determined that baby Matthew's 17th chromosome is no
&gt; longer abnormal and deformed,
&gt; but...perfectly normal and well formed!!!.
&gt; PRAISE GOD!!!!!! PRAISE OUR AWESOME GOD!!! Thank
&gt; YOU all for BEING SO
&gt; FAITHFUL IN YOUR PRAYERS!
&gt; It was also determined that the damage sustained
&gt; during Matthew's birth
&gt; happened thus: during each contraction Athena had
&gt; during labor, the contraction
&gt; didn't let up; instead the intensity became stronger
&gt; and stronger, but didn't
&gt; allow her cervix to dilate completely. To add to
&gt; this, her doctor was giving her
&gt; some medications to increase her labor, and as he
&gt; was reading the instruments
&gt; he said that the machines were wrong...and gave her
&gt; even more
&gt; medications...but the machines were not wrong, but
&gt; correct. This went on for two and a half
&gt; days, until her body just quit and her labor
&gt; stopped. In essence little Matthew
&gt; was being crushed by her uterus, which is why damage
&gt; has been scattered
&gt; throughout his brain, and why the skull has shown
&gt; stress fractures. I believe her
&gt; labor stopped because God stopped it, to save
&gt; Matthew. Praise God...
&gt; We are seeing small improvements every day, and know
&gt; that because of your
&gt; prayers, because of our Lord on our side, Matthew is
&gt; going to be just fine.

&gt; DEAR PRAYER PARTNERS,
&gt;
&gt; 1) THE LORD HAS ANSWERED OUR PRAYERS concerning
&gt; unauthorized purchases
&gt; against our debit card. You may remember a
&gt; transaction review last Saturday
&gt; revealed someone in New Jersey (we live in Florida)
&gt; made purchases of $427.00 and
&gt; $504.59 at a Toys-R-Us store on our debit card.
&gt; After completing a Sheriffâ€™s
&gt; report, filing a sworn affidavit and completing
&gt; several credit union forms, our
&gt; account was credited back yesterday for these
&gt; amounts, PTL! The investigation
&gt; continues concerning who did this â€“ please PRAY
&gt; FOR THEM and their salvation
&gt; and that God might ASSIST THOSE CONDUCTING THE
&gt; INVESTIGATION. God Bless you
&gt; for your faithfulness to pray for others.
&gt;
&gt; 2) Paula Grimes brought by a dear brother in Christ
&gt; to see me yesterday
&gt; afternoon. Some of you may remember, JEFF FREDRICK,
&gt; owner of Rehabilitation
&gt; Engineering in Tallahassee, FL which was sold to
&gt; J.E. Hanger a few years ago. As
&gt; of November 20th Jeff has returned to the
&gt; Tallahassee community from
&gt; Gainesville, FL to reestablish his business. Jeff
&gt; is a very committed Christian with
&gt; what I affectionately refer to as the â€œspirit of
&gt; the Apostle Paulâ€ in his zeal
&gt; to serve Jesus Christ. It was great to see him
&gt; again and it seemed to us
&gt; there had been no years of separation. Please pray
&gt; for JEFF, HIS FAMILY LIFE and
&gt; WORK LIFE and MINISTRY. He continues to do great
&gt; things for our Lord and as
&gt; you can imagine the war being waged against him is
&gt; great. In His Love, Brother
&gt; Bruce.

&gt; Thank you for the continued prayers and we are home
&gt; from the pacer/defib.
&gt; clinic. So far so good with alot of healing to do
&gt; ...Said it will take 2 months
&gt; to get this really inplanted and scar tissue built
&gt; up around it. They have
&gt; ordered a new carelink system as his new device is
&gt; wireless..meaning when we
&gt; received this machine..we will take the wand and go
&gt; over his pacer and it will go
&gt; over the phone lines and put him into the Carelink
&gt; system... we will then set
&gt; it in the bedroom and when he walks by it it will
&gt; pick up signals if anything
&gt; is wrong with it and transmit it to them and they in
&gt; turn will call the Heart
&gt; center and then call us. Every morning at 10:10 a.m.
&gt; it goes thru a check
&gt; system no matter where he is and if anything is
&gt; wrong will transmit a signal to
&gt; them too.....amazing what technology can
&gt; do......wow........ so he is to be very
&gt; careful for the next month and we go back into the
&gt; clinic on Feb. 4, 2008 ...
&gt; so all prayers are greatly appreciated and we thank

&gt;
&gt; Good morning---
&gt; Just an update on my Dad (Ray Riley), he is doing
&gt; OK---after an X-ray
&gt; yesterday they determined he now has pneumonia and
&gt; is also having a swallowing
&gt; problem. Dad is getting a new antibiotic in his IV
&gt; and they have put some kind of
&gt; &quot;thickening&quot; substance in his liquids ( coffee,
&gt; water, soup) apparently he is
&gt; having trouble with swallowing liquids more than
&gt; solid food. So----------I
&gt; guess we see how this all works out. He will be in
&gt; the hospital at least until
&gt; Wednesday, when they might send him back to the
&gt; nursing home.
&gt; Thanks for all the prayers---they have been a
&gt; tremendous help to all of us!!
&gt;
&gt; Please add: Bob Marx to the prayer list---he is a
&gt; Physician serving as a
&gt; hospital commander in Iraq and is having a rough
&gt; time right now with depression.
&gt; His first Grandchild was born in November and he
&gt; will not get to see the
&gt; Grandson until early summer. His wife, Becky, is a
&gt; close friend of mine. I ask tha
&gt; t you keep this family in prayer.
&gt;
&gt; Also Beecher Klingensmith---did very well with his
&gt; prostate surgery and no
&gt; cancer was found. He is very relieved and
&gt; appreciates the prayers. Thanks you!
&gt;
&gt; Have a wonderful day and GOD BLESS !!!

&gt;
&gt;
&gt; I saw the doctor today and he is going to run
&gt; several more test, but after
&gt; these past month of physical therapy and my
&gt; continued pain being unable to
&gt; &quot;pass&quot; the physical exam concerning weakness in my
&gt; arms, it is now obvious that
&gt; there is some serious damage to a nerve or nerves in
&gt; my spine.
&gt;
&gt; He greatly increased my pain medication and is
&gt; setting me up an appointment
&gt; with a neurologist for further testing to determine
&gt; the exact level of nerve
&gt; damage and what we need to do next. This is going to
&gt; be a long and drawn out
&gt; process. Therapy has helped, but the traction did
&gt; nothing but make matters
&gt; worse. It was the next logical step to try, but I
&gt; won't be having therapy anymore.
&gt; The neurologist is a very skilled and well respected
&gt; surgeon, so if that's
&gt; what I need, he can take care of me. Unfortunately,
&gt; it will be late January at
&gt; the earliest before he can see me. Who knows how
&gt; long all the test he will order
&gt; will take.
&gt;
&gt; Thankfully, this is not a life threatening problem;
&gt; just one of being
&gt; miserable. The doctor scolded me for not letting him
&gt; know my pain medication wasn't
&gt; really helping. So, hopefully with the new and
&gt; stronger medication, I will not
&gt; suffer needlessly.
&gt;
&gt; I KNOW the Lord will bring about healing in His good
&gt; time. Just pray for me
&gt; that I can keep a positive outlook on life until
&gt; then. It's easy to get weary
&gt; and depressed when a person is in severe and
&gt; constant pain.
&gt;
&gt; I will not be bringing all of this up anymore except
&gt; to give updates when
&gt; something changes. I count my blessings and will
&gt; humbly seek to be a blessing to
&gt; others. If you would be so kind, forward this update
&gt; to those who you have
&gt; shared my prayer requests with.
&gt;
&gt; Your loving brother and friend,

&gt; Subj: Baby Callie: Details of surgeries; holding
&gt; strong!.... God's Hand!

&gt;
&gt; Callie is still holding strong. She kept on spiking
&gt; a low grade temp and have
&gt; had her on a cooling blanket. Poor thing was
&gt; shivering for days. We finally
&gt; talked them into turning it off just to see if her
&gt; not shivering would help
&gt; keep her core temp low and it seemed to help.
&gt; Some people had asked how the surgeons knew that her
&gt; bowels were necrotic.
&gt; We've bombarded you with little pieces of
&gt; information over those hellish five
&gt; days and I know we probably weren't clear. Callie
&gt; went in for a routine surgery
&gt; to correct a perforated bowel. When the opened her
&gt; up, according to one of the
&gt; doctors there, they were overwhelmed with the stench
&gt; of decomposing tissue.
&gt; Many of her bowels were necrotic (dead); and most
&gt; were borderline-necrotic. Dr.
&gt; Hanley was called in from another surgery to confirm
&gt; what they were seeing.
&gt; Other attending docs came in. Apparently, I was told
&gt; one had cried.
&gt; They were going to start cutting away at all the
&gt; tissue but Hanley had
&gt; stopped them telling them to close her up and see if
&gt; she survives 48 hours. She
&gt; couldn't live with as much tissue as they were
&gt; wanting to cut. During that time,
&gt; Callie didn't die, Callie lived, and fought. She
&gt; thrashed and thrashed in pain
&gt; from her intestines decomposing within her. They hit
&gt; her with every medication
&gt; they could to completely sedate her. Enough to knock
&gt; out an adult several
&gt; times and it didn't even make a dent on Callie. For
&gt; all you medical folks,
&gt; through all this, Callie's lactate level never rose
&gt; above 2. Callie's colostomy
&gt; stump also became necrotic and black. There was one
&gt; unusual thing that happened.
&gt; Maybe there is a medical explanation or maybe not.
&gt; The day after they closed
&gt; Callie up and gave her 48 hours to live. There were
&gt; red spots and blotches on
&gt; Callie's lower abdomen. They thought it was a rash,
&gt; or worse, and abcess. The
&gt; doctors circled them with pen. The red dots began to
&gt; migrate across her stomach,
&gt; lighten, and then disappear. Part of me thinks that
&gt; was God healing her.
&gt; Ultimately, when they went in and found most tissue
&gt; alive and pink, they had to
&gt; only removed two thirds of the colon. She will need
&gt; a simple connective surgery
&gt; in three months. Dr. Hanley said this will not limit
&gt; her physically in any way
&gt; and that there is no reason to think she will not
&gt; have normal bowel function
&gt; once this is all said and done.
&gt; One other thing I forgot to share during this whole
&gt; ordeal is that the
&gt; Immunology Dept. came down and dismissed Callie from
&gt; their service because her
&gt; immune system was &quot;almost normal&quot; and getting
&gt; better. Not too shabby for the child
&gt; born without a thymus. Right now, in front of me is
&gt; a child with a hard and
&gt; painful recovery ahead of her. I am reminded that I
&gt; have to get back to putting
&gt; my nose to the grindstone in prayer to get her
&gt; through this. This time with
&gt; renewed faith and fervour as I feel God has given us
&gt; His opinion on the issue.
&gt; Sometimes God will have us labor to build something
&gt; together in prayer instead
&gt; of handing it to us all at once. I do still pray He
&gt; will decide to heal her
&gt; entirely. He's proven that's not a problem. I feel
&gt; Callie's intercessors are as
&gt; a big a part of building this testimony as Joe and I
&gt; are, even Callie. The was
&gt; one word I got before God healed Callie. I was
&gt; grieving the situation and I
&gt; didn't understand what it meant at the time: &quot;I had
&gt; to take you this far so you
&gt; would know it was Me&quot;. I understand that now. Please
&gt; continue to pray for
&gt; Callie. I don't profess to understand what is going
&gt; on. I know the road ahead may
&gt; be hard. I know we are in the center of His will
&gt; though. God bless you all.
&gt; Please cover Callie in your prayers tonight as she
&gt; is frightened and in pain.
&gt; There is rumor of extubation after the weekend.
&gt; Love,
&gt; Karen
