Continuing with my response to Roger Stritmatter and Lynne Kositsky's
critique of the Reedy/Kathman essay.

Again, Stritmatter and Kositsky's remarks are preceded by '&gt;'.
Reedy and Kathman's remarks are preceded by '&gt;&gt;'.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;We will now respond to section 2 point by point:
&gt;&gt; 2. William Shakespeare was an actor in the company which performed the
&gt;&gt; plays of William Shakespeare.
&gt; We have already stipulated to this statement phrased correctly that is:
&gt; William Shakespeare was an actor in the company which performed the
&gt; plays of &quot;William Shakespeare&quot;. However, it may be helpful to examine
&gt; each item in this category.

"/>

(A minor question about words: is &quot;stipulated&quot; being used correctly in
the above paragraph?)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; From 1594 on, the plays of William Shakespeare were performed
&gt;&gt; exclusively by the acting company variously known as the Lord
&gt;&gt; Chamberlain's Men (1594-96, 1597-1603), Lord Hunsdon's Men (1596-97),
&gt;&gt; and the King's Men (1603-42).
&gt; How do R and K know that the plays were performed exclusively by this
&gt; company? What evidence do they have for asserting this?

"/>

I took it to mean that, based on the evidence we have, the plays were
performed exclusively by one particular company. Is there some historical
evidence available that indicates that any of Shakespeare's plays were performed
by some other company?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; William Shakespeare was a prominent member of this acting company, as
&gt;&gt; the following evidence demonstrates.
&gt;&gt; 2a. On 15 March 1595,the Treasurer of the Queen's Chamber paid
&gt;&gt;&quot;William Kempe William Shakespeare &amp; Richarde Burbage servants to the
&gt;&gt; Lord Chamberleyne&quot; for performances at court in Greenwich on 26 and 27
&gt;&gt; Dec of the previous year.
&gt; This statement does not address his prominence as an actor. It simply
&gt; lists him as a payee of the company.

"/>

Their major point here is that he was a *member* of the acting company.
This one piece of evidence (of several) is establishing that point.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; K and R also fail to note that
&gt; this is the only reference to Shakespeare of Stratford as a payee in
&gt; the 48 year existence of the company, although he was alive for 22
&gt; years of this period.

"/>

Fair enough. But we do have that one record that establishes that
someone named William Shakespeare was involved with the company.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; We note the obvious: that this sheds no light on
&gt; William Shakespeare of Stratford as an author.

"/>

So what? It's not intended to do so. Their main point, here in Part 2
of their essay, is that someone named William Shakespeare was involved with the
company.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; 2b. On 13 March 1602, John Manningham of the Middle Temple recorded in
&gt;&gt; his diary a racy anecdote about Richard Burbage and William
&gt;&gt; Shakespeare:
&gt;&gt; Upon a time when Burbidge played Richard III there was a citizen grew
&gt;&gt; so far in liking with him, that before she went from the play she
&gt;&gt; appointed him to come to her that night unto her by the name of
&gt;&gt; Richard III. Shakespeare, overhearing their conclusion, went before,
&gt;&gt; was entertained and at his game ere Burbage came. Then message being
&gt;&gt; brought that Richard III was at the door, Shakespeare caused return to
&gt;&gt; be made that William the Conqueror was before Richard III.
&gt;&gt; Shakespeare's name William.
&gt;&gt; The anecdote does not explicitly call Shakespeare an actor, but it
&gt;&gt; places him at the theater with Burbage, the leading actor of the
&gt;&gt; Chamberlain's Men. Manningham was a friend of William Shakespeare's
&gt;&gt; friend and &quot;cousin&quot; Thomas Greene, who was then finishing up his
&gt;&gt; studies at the Middle Temple and would move to Stratford the following
&gt;&gt; year.
&gt; Not only does this anecdote not explicitly call Shakespeare an actor,
&gt; but it has nothing to do with his being a writer either.

"/>

No, it doesn't. Nor is it intended to do so. This anecdote, as R&amp;K
point out, establishes some connection between someone named William Shakespeare
and Richard Burbage, a prominent actor with the LCM.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; More
&gt; important, it is interesting to note that although the name of the
&gt; author was apparently famous by 1602, Manningham is so unfamiliar with
&gt; Shakespeare of Stratford that he feels the need to leave a note to
&gt; himself that Shakespeares name William.

"/>

How famous was the name in 1602? And even if the name was famous for
many people, perhaps it was not that well-known to Manningham?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; 2c. On 19 May 1603 the Lord Chamberlain's Men were licensed as the
&gt;&gt; King's Men. The document lists &quot;Lawrence Fletcher, William
&gt;&gt; Shakespeare, Richard Burbage, Augustyne Phillippes, Iohn Heninges,
&gt;&gt; Henrie Condell, William Sly, Robert Armyn, Richard Cowly&quot; as members
&gt;&gt; of the troupe. Shakespeare's prominence is indicated by the fact that
&gt;&gt; he appears second on the list, behind only Lawrence Fletcher, who had
&gt;&gt; acted for King James in Scotland.
&gt; We stipulate to the fact that William Shakespeare of Stratfords name
&gt; was on the list; however, we cannot accept R and Ks statement that the
&gt; placement of the name indicates his prominence in the company. What
&gt; evidence do they have to assert this? And if they do have further
&gt; evidence to make this assertion, does it then mean that any list on
&gt; which Oxford appears first with regard to his writing attests to his
&gt; prominence in the literary world?

"/>

Nice try. Even if there is an argument about how prominent Shakespeare
was in the company, there can be no argument that someone named William
Shakespeare was part of the company, and that he was an actor. Reedy and
Kathman are establishing that point, which is their main objective in Part 2.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; 2d. The account of Sir George Home, Master of the Great Wardrobe,
&gt;&gt; lists the names of &quot;Players&quot; who were given four yards of red cloth
&gt;&gt; apiece for the investiture of King James in London on 15 March 1604.
&gt;&gt; They are &quot;William Shakespeare, Augustine Phillipps, Lawrence Fletcher,
&gt;&gt; John Hemminges, Richard Burbidge, William Slye, Robert Armyn, Henry
&gt;&gt; Cundell, and Richard Cowley.&quot; Here Shakespeare appears first among his
&gt;&gt; fellows.
&gt; See above.

"/>

See above.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; 2e. The will of Augustine Phillips, executed 5 May 1605, proved 16 May
&gt;&gt; 1605, bequeaths, &quot;to my Fellowe William Shakespeare a thirty shillings
&gt;&gt; peece in gould, To my Fellowe Henry Condell one other thirty shillinge
&gt;&gt; peece in gould . . . To my Fellowe Lawrence Fletcher twenty shillings
&gt;&gt; in gould, To my Fellowe Robert Armyne twenty shillings in gould . . .
&gt;&gt; .&quot; All of the people who Phillips calls his &quot;fellows&quot; were actors in
&gt;&gt; the King's Men. Augustine Phillips's bequest of 30 shillings to his
&gt;&gt;&quot;Fellowe&quot; Shakespeare was written 11 months after the Earl of Oxford's
&gt;&gt; death. If Oxford were Shakespeare, Phillips would have known that he
&gt;&gt; was dead.
&gt; We stipulate to the fact that Augustine Phillips left William
&gt; Shakespeare of Stratford a bequest of gold. We also acknowledge the
&gt; fact that the 17th Earl of Oxford died in June 1604. However, there is
&gt; no evidence that Phillips was leaving a bequest to the writer of the
&gt; plays as opposed to a fellowe in the Kings Men. The attempted argument
&gt; is strained at best and entirely without merit.

"/>

It is not at all strained or without merit to the point which Reedy and
Kathman are trying to make: that someone named William Shakespeare was part of
the LCM/KM. Once again you are accusing R&amp;K of failing to make an argument
which they, at this point, are not trying to make.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; 2f. The 1616 Folio of Ben Jonson's Works contains cast lists for his
&gt;&gt; plays. The cast list for Jonson's Every Man in His Humor, performed in
&gt;&gt; 1598, includes &quot;Will Shakespeare, Aug. Philips, Hen. Condel, Will.
&gt;&gt; Slye, Will. Kempe, Ric. Burbadge, Ioh. Hemings, Tho. Pope, Chr.
&gt;&gt; Beeston, and Ioh. Duke.&quot; Once again, Shakespeare is listed first among
&gt;&gt; his fellows.
&gt; Again, see our response to 2c.

"/>

Again, see my response to your response.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; 2g. The cast list for Jonson's Sejanus, performed in 1603, includes
&gt;&gt;&quot;Ric. Burbadge, Aug. Philips, Will. Sly, Ioh. Lowin, Will.
&gt;&gt; Shake-Speare, Ioh. Hemings, Hen. Condel, and Alex. Cooke.&quot;
&gt; Apparently William Shakespeare of Stratford had lost some status in
&gt; the five years following Every Man in his Humour.

"/>

Good one. I suppose one could make the argument that the order of names
is important, and that Shakespeare simply didn't play a prominent role in this
particular play. But even if the order in which names are listed isn't a
reflection of the relative prominence or importance of the people involved, the
lists certainly support Reedy and Kathman's main point: that someone named
William Shakespeare was a member and actor of the company.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; So William Shakespeare was an actor in the company that performed the
&gt;&gt; plays written under his name.
&gt; Again, William Shakespeare was an actor in the company that performed
&gt; the plays of &quot;William Shakespeare&quot;.

"/>

Okay.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; But was this the same William Shakespeare of Stratford-upon-Avon? The
&gt;&gt; answer, of course, is yes. We have documentary evidence of this, from
&gt;&gt; a variety of sources.
&gt; We agree.

"/>

Which again raises my question about why Stritmatter and Kositsky felt
it necessary to write this critique. But I'm getting ahead of myself.

To recap:

In Part 1 of their essay, Reedy and Kathman made the point that the
works in question were attributed to the name William Shakespeare.

Stritmatter and Kositsky agreed.

In this, Part 2 of the essay, Reedy and Kathman make the point that
someone with the name William Shakespeare was an actor in the company that
performed these works.

Stritmatter and Kositsky agree.

We shall move on to their critique of Part 3 as time permits.

No. This is obviously the good Dr. writing. He has a fondess for using terms

This is an interesting question, and one for which I would
welcome an answer anyway, having a particular example in
mind.

Writing to Anthony Bacon in January 1595/6, his secretary
Jaques Petit tells of a performance of *Titus Andronicus*
at Burley on the Hill in Rutland. The play was performed
by *les commediens de Londres* who arrived on New Year's
Day, performed that evening, and were sent on their way
the following day - * &amp; le lendemain on les despecha.*

Burley is at least a hundred miles by road from London.
As the Lord Chamberlain's Men had, I gather, played before
the Queen on 28th December, and were booked again for 6th
January, that would have been quite a slog! Twenty or more
of them, travelling with all of their costumes, props etc.,
they are unlikely to have done the trip in less than four
days each way.

How sure can we be that these were the Lord Chamberlain's
Men? And related to that, of course, how likely is it - if they
were - that William Shakespeare would have been there with
them?

"/>

Yes, the term is used correctly.

However, if the matter were &quot;stipulated&quot; to in court, most of the rest
of what's included below would be excluded as duplicative.
That is, unless the issue of whether Shakespeare of Stratford
was a &quot;prominent&quot; actor, (or even a shareholder)
might then be excluded as irrelevant,
unless the proponent can demonstrate that there is some correlation
between his &quot;prominence&quot; as an actor and the probability that he
wrote the plays. I think R &amp; S are merely pointing this out.

I think the inclusions below point more toward Will's position
as a *shareholder*, rather than the idea that he was a great actor.
R &amp; K might consider revising their argument as such, as it would
tend to support their position on the true nature of his value
to the company, which is the plays. This is especially true
where there's no evidence of his brilliance as an actor,
such as there is for Ned Alleyn. Maybe he was a horrible actor,
but Burbage &amp; Co. let him act because he wrote the plays, and
if they didn't let him act, he'd take his pen and flounce off
to join the Admiral's men. ;-)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt; From 1594 on, the plays of William Shakespeare were performed
&gt;&gt;&gt; exclusively by the acting company variously known as the Lord
&gt;&gt;&gt; Chamberlain's Men (1594-96, 1597-1603), Lord Hunsdon's Men (1596-97),
&gt;&gt;&gt; and the King's Men (1603-42).

"/>

What's the importance of whether the plays were performed &quot;exclusively&quot;
by the LCM/KM? If the plays were so hot, wouldn't they have been
pirated regularly, especially outside London?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt; William Shakespeare was a prominent member of this acting company, as
&gt;&gt;&gt; the following evidence demonstrates.
&gt;&gt;&gt; 2a. On 15 March 1595,the Treasurer of the Queen's Chamber paid
&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;William Kempe William Shakespeare &amp; Richarde Burbage servants to the
&gt;&gt;&gt; Lord Chamberleyne&quot; for performances at court in Greenwich on 26 and 27
&gt;&gt;&gt; Dec of the previous year.

&gt;&gt; This statement does not address his prominence as an actor. It simply
&gt;&gt; lists him as a payee of the company.

&gt; Their major point here is that he was a *member* of the acting company.
&gt; This one piece of evidence (of several) is establishing that point.

&gt;&gt; K and R also fail to note that
&gt;&gt; this is the only reference to Shakespeare of Stratford as a payee in
&gt;&gt; the 48 year existence of the company, although he was alive for 22
&gt;&gt; years of this period.

&gt; Fair enough. But we do have that one record that establishes that
&gt; someone named William Shakespeare was involved with the company.

&gt;&gt; We note the obvious: that this sheds no light on
&gt;&gt; William Shakespeare of Stratford as an author.

&gt; So what? It's not intended to do so. Their main point, here in Part 2
&gt; of their essay, is that someone named William Shakespeare was involved with the
&gt; company.

"/>

Their point is that this evidence is duplicative, in that it supports
a point already previously stipulated, but sheds no additional light
on the main issue. I.e., just because A+A+A+A+A = 5A, it does not
logically follow that the Actor wrote plays. A hundred more references
to William the actor would not move the argument in the direction
of William the author. Recall again, that we have no references
lauding Shakespeare as an &quot;orator.&quot;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;&gt; friend and &quot;cousin&quot; Thomas Greene, who was then finishing up his

&gt;&gt;&gt; year.

&gt;&gt; Not only does this anecdote not explicitly call Shakespeare an actor,
&gt;&gt; but it has nothing to do with his being a writer either.

&gt; No, it doesn't. Nor is it intended to do so. This anecdote, as R&amp;K
&gt; point out, establishes some connection between someone named William Shakespeare
&gt; and Richard Burbage, a prominent actor with the LCM.

"/>

I wonder why nobody has bothered to point out that
this is evidence that William Shakespeare the actor
had a quick mind and a droll sense of humor,
traits shared by Shakespeare the author?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; More
&gt;&gt; important, it is interesting to note that although the name of the
&gt;&gt; author was apparently famous by 1602, Manningham is so unfamiliar with

&gt;&gt; prominence in the literary world?

&gt; Nice try. Even if there is an argument about how prominent Shakespeare

&gt; Shakespeare was part of the company, and that he was an actor. Reedy and

&gt;&gt;&gt; fellows.

&gt;&gt; See above.

&gt; See above.

"/>

I (personally) place no particular importance on the ordering
of the names on these two lists, since if the lists ranked them in order
of their prominence as either actors or shareholders,
Burbidge would be first on both counts.
Since the ordering is different for each list, it is just as likely
that the order was set out by the person reciting the names to the scribe,
beginning with the name of the person giving the names and anyone
standing beside him at the time.

&gt;&gt; performed by some other company?

&gt; This is an interesting question, and one for which I would
&gt; welcome an answer anyway, having a particular example in
&gt; mind.

&gt; Writing to Anthony Bacon in January 1595/6, his secretary
&gt; Jaques Petit tells of a performance of *Titus Andronicus*
&gt; at Burley on the Hill in Rutland. The play was performed
&gt; by *les commediens de Londres* who arrived on New Year's
&gt; Day, performed that evening, and were sent on their way
&gt; the following day - * &amp; le lendemain on les despecha.*

&gt; Burley is at least a hundred miles by road from London.
&gt; As the Lord Chamberlain's Men had, I gather, played before
&gt; the Queen on 28th December, and were booked again for 6th
&gt; January, that would have been quite a slog! Twenty or more
&gt; of them, travelling with all of their costumes, props etc.,
&gt; they are unlikely to have done the trip in less than four
&gt; days each way.

&gt; How sure can we be that these were the Lord Chamberlain's
&gt; Men? And related to that, of course, how likely is it - if they
&gt; were - that William Shakespeare would have been there with
&gt; them?

"/>

You can't be sure it was the Lord Chamberlain's Men. The cover of the only
surviving quarto of *Titus*, published in 1594, says it had been acted by
three different companies, &quot;the Right Ho-
nourable the Earle of Darbie, Earle of Pembrooke, and Earle of Sussex their
seruants.&quot;

That tells me the play was written before Shakespeare became a member of the
LC's Men, and that either he wrote it while freelancing or had been a member
of each of those three troupes at the time they put the play on.

If Roger Stritmatter's use of the term is correct (and I have no reason to
doubt your word, since I just pulled my opinion out of my ass), then the
word has a technical legal meaning which is used here rather than just
ordinary English usage.

That can only mean that RS has had legal training, since it is a tenet of
antiStratfordianism that only trained legal minds can use legal terms
correctly! So tell us, Roger, which law school did you graduate from?

Hi Christine

I'm assuming you've got some legal training, as you've stepped forward to
give a firm opinion on this, so I'd be grateful if you could expand on this
a little.
I'd always assumed that legal 'stipulation' meant that both sides agreed on
a piece of evidence, so when I read the S&amp;K remarks (as above), I thought
that they *weren't* using 'stipulate' correctly, because they had amended
the wording. Although all they've done is add quotes to the second instance
of William Shakespeare, that does change the implicit meaning to something
that R&amp;K haven't themselves agreed, or stipulated, to.
Thanks for your input

James Doyle
No legal training beyond reading Scott Turow's novels :)

The Reedy/Kathman essay was not written for LynnE and Roger alone, but also for
people NOT stupulating to Shakespeare's being an actor. It is quite proper for
R/K to advance as much evidence that he was an actor as they can to make their
point that he was indeed an actor.

&gt;&gt;&gt; We note the obvious: that this sheds no light on
&gt;&gt;&gt; William Shakespeare of Stratford as an author.

&gt;&gt; So what? It's not intended to do so. Their main point, here in Part 2
&gt;&gt; of their essay, is that someone named William Shakespeare was involved with the
&gt;&gt; company.

&gt; Their point is that this evidence is duplicative, in that it supports
&gt; a point already previously stipulated, but sheds no additional light
&gt; on the main issue. I.e., just because A+A+A+A+A = 5A, it does not
&gt; logically follow that the Actor wrote plays. A hundred more references
&gt; to William the actor would not move the argument in the direction
&gt; of William the author. Recall again, that we have no references
&gt; lauding Shakespeare as an &quot;orator.&quot;

"/>

The reason why R&amp;K cite &quot;duplicative&quot; evidence that Shakespeare of
Stratford was an actor is that many anti-Stratfordians deny it, just
as many deny that the Stratford Man had the same name as the author
the plays. Some of S&amp;K's asides (e. g., their harping on the way that
the name is spelled in Shakespeare's signatures and their nitpicking
about whether Shakespeare was a &quot;prominent&quot; actor) hint that their
stipulation is not wholly sincere. Be that as it may, they are
disingenuous when they imply that their willingness to accept these
propositions is widely shared by their fellow travelers and that R&amp;K
therefore did not need to address them at such length.

The genesis of the essay was the antiStratfordian claim that there was no
contemporary evidence for the authorship of William Shakespeare of
Stratford. It was later expand into presenting the contemporary evidence for
his authorship. The fact that he was a player in the company that had
exclusive right to his plays is certainly relevant to the question.

&gt;&gt;&gt; It certainly wasn't the Lord Admiral's. (See Henslowe's
&gt;&gt;&gt; accounts.)

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The cover of the only
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; surviving quarto of *Titus*, published in 1594, says it had been
acted
&gt;&gt; by
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; three different companies, &quot;the Right Ho-
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; nourable the Earle of Darbie, Earle of Pembrooke, and Earle of
Sussex
&gt;&gt; their
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; seruants.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; That tells me the play was written before Shakespeare became a
member of
&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; LC's Men, and that either he wrote it while freelancing or had been
a
&gt;&gt; member
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of each of those three troupes at the time they put the play on.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I don't see how that relates to us not being sure that
&gt;&gt;&gt; it was the Lord Chamberlain's Men.

&gt;&gt; My point is that the play was not exclusive to the LC's men, so we can't
be
&gt;&gt; sure it was they who put on the play.

&gt; Q2(1600) added the Lord Chamberlain's Men to the
&gt; list of those who had performed it. If another
&gt; company was known to have played it, I'm fairly

Just so that I'm clear on this, Tom, when you and Dave write:

From 1594 on, the plays of William Shakespeare were performed
exclusively by the acting company variously known as the Lord
Chamberlain's Men (1594-96, 1597-1603), Lord Hunsdon's Men (1596-97),
and the King's Men (1603-42).

what you're saying is that from 1594 on, the plays of William
Shakespeare that were written after 1594 were performed exclusively by the
acting company known as the LCM etc.?

Otherwise, what you're now saying to Rob seems to contradict what you
wrote in the essay.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; company. Is there some historical evidence available
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that indicates that any of Shakespeare's plays were
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; performed by some other company?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This is an interesting question, and one for which I would
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; welcome an answer anyway, having a particular example in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; mind.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Writing to Anthony Bacon in January 1595/6, his secretary
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Jaques Petit tells of a performance of *Titus Andronicus*
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; at Burley on the Hill in Rutland. The play was performed
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; by *les commediens de Londres* who arrived on New Year's
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Day, performed that evening, and were sent on their way
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the following day - * &amp; le lendemain on les despecha.*

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Burley is at least a hundred miles by road from London.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; As the Lord Chamberlain's Men had, I gather, played before
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the Queen on 28th December, and were booked again for 6th
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; January, that would have been quite a slog! Twenty or more
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of them, travelling with all of their costumes, props etc.,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; they are unlikely to have done the trip in less than four
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; days each way.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; How sure can we be that these were the Lord Chamberlain's
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Men? And related to that, of course, how likely is it - if they
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; were - that William Shakespeare would have been there with
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; them?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You can't be sure it was the Lord Chamberlain's Men.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Men, what companies were active in London in 1596?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Rob

"/>

A few facts worth noting:

1) The Lord Chamberlain's Men did not even exist until June 1594,
after Q1 Titus had been published, so we naturally can't expect
that company to be mentioned in that quarto.

2) Similarly, Shakespeare obviously cannot have written the play
while he was a member of the Chamberlain's Men, for the same
reason. He must have been either a freelance playwright or
associated with another company, most likely one of the three
mentioned in the quarto.

3) Henslowe's Diary shows that Titus Andronicus was performed
by Sussex's Men at the Rose on 23 January 1594, when it was
marked 'ne' (indicating a new or newly licensed play). It took in
3 pounds 8 shillings, a good haul but not quite the best for
Sussex's in this run. (Huon of Bordeaux and George a Green had
each taken in 3 pounds 10 shillings on December 28-29, during
the Christmas holidays.) Sussex's Men performed Titus again on
28 January and 6 February, and it took in 40 shillings (or 2 pounds)
each day. But playing in London was suspended indefinitely
because of plague after the 6 February performance, and the
play was entered on the Stationer's Register by John Danter
the same day.

4) In May the Lord Chamberlain's Men were created and given
a license to act in London, with the Admiral's Men the only other
company given such a right (at least in theory). In early June, the
Lord Chamberlain's and Admiral's Men acted together at Newington
Butts (a mile south of the city) for an 11-day run, from 3-13 June.
They performed Titus Andronicus on 5 June and 12 June, with
takings of 12 shillings each time. By 15 June, the Admiral's Men
were able to return to the Rose and begin playing there by
themselves, and they continued to do so with few interruptions
for the next several years.

5) Henslowe's Diary shows that the Admiral's Men performed
&quot;The Seven Days of the Week&quot; on 1 January 1596, the day of the
performance of Titus at Burley, and that they performed &quot;The Wise
Man of Westchester&quot; on 30 December and &quot;Crack Me This Nut&quot; on
2 January. This shows pretty conclusively that they were not the
company at Burley.

6) The Chamberlain's Men do not appear in Henslowe's Diary
after that June 1594 run, and neither does Titus Andronicus.
The Admiral's Men men appear in the Diary through the end of
1596 with only minor interruptions, and Titus Andronicus is nowhere
mentioned among the plays they performed. The Chamberlain's
Men, as noted above, certainly had the rights to the play by the
publication of the 1600 quarto. All this suggests to me that if any
London company had the rights to Titus in 1596, it was the
Chamberlain's Men. One cannot prove this with metaphysical
certainty, of course, but that's what the evidence suggests to me.

7) Siobhan Keenan has a detailed discussion of this 1596
performance of Titus in her book *Traveling Players in Shakespeare's
England*, pp. 77-86. It's worth reading, as is the whole book.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Continuing with my response to Roger Stritmatter and Lynne Kositsky's
&gt;&gt;&gt; critique of the Reedy/Kathman essay.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Again, Stritmatter and Kositsky's remarks are preceded by '&gt;'.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Reedy and Kathman's remarks are preceded by '&gt;&gt;'.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;We will now respond to section 2 point by point:

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 2. William Shakespeare was an actor in the company which performed
&gt; the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; plays of William Shakespeare.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; We have already stipulated to this statement phrased correctly that
&gt; is:
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; William Shakespeare was an actor in the company which performed the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; plays of &quot;William Shakespeare&quot;. However, it may be helpful to
&gt; examine
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; each item in this category.

&gt;&gt;&gt; (A minor question about words: is &quot;stipulated&quot; being used correctly in
&gt;&gt;&gt; the above paragraph?)

&gt;&gt; Yes, the term is used correctly.

&gt; Hi Christine

&gt; I'm assuming you've got some legal training, as you've stepped forward to
&gt; give a firm opinion on this, so I'd be grateful if you could expand on this
&gt; a little.
&gt; I'd always assumed that legal 'stipulation' meant that both sides agreed on
&gt; a piece of evidence, so when I read the S&amp;K remarks (as above), I thought
&gt; that they *weren't* using 'stipulate' correctly, because they had amended
&gt; the wording. Although all they've done is add quotes to the second instance
&gt; of William Shakespeare, that does change the implicit meaning to something
&gt; that R&amp;K haven't themselves agreed, or stipulated, to.
&gt; Thanks for your input

&gt; James Doyle
&gt; No legal training beyond reading Scott Turow's novels :)

"/>

Yes, James, I are duly licensed to practice law,
a subject of endless amusement to my children.
Legal training warps the mind.
Don't try it if your mind is already warped.

As to your question:

In the beginning of a hearing or trial, generally the court will
ask for &quot;stipulations of fact.&quot;
(as well as stipulations of law, but that's not an issue here)
Any stipulation removes the issue from litigation,

i.e., if a party offered a fact, and the other side stipulated to it,
the stipulating party is then precluded from offering any evidence
which tends to disprove the stipulated fact.

(incidently, if the offering party then introduces at trial some
evidence that disputes the fact they offered for stipulation,
this introduction &quot;opens the door&quot; for the stipulating party
to offer evidence in contradiction to their own stipulation
if it benefits their case: see what I mean by &quot;warped?&quot;)

One party might offer a statement for stipulation
that contains more than one fact, as, for instance,

&quot;William Shakespeare was an actor in the company
which performed the plays of William Shakespeare.

This statement was interpreted by K &amp; S to include not one
but three facts (it's actually four or five):

1) William Shakespeare was an actor. (stipulated)

2) in the company of players that performed the plays
of William Shakespeare (Not stipulated).

The addition by K &amp; S of quotation marks indicates that
the issue of whether the actor and the author were one and the same person
will be a disputed fact, otherwise K &amp; S would be precluded
from offering evidence of this fact at trial.
The R &amp; K tactic of including multiple facts in the same statement
is often used and often successful when not intercepted by the unwary.

3) With their rephrasing, K &amp; S also stipulated
that William Shakespeare was an actor in the *same* company of players
that performed the plays of the author, William Shakespeare.
(I've included this because there is a dispute as to the issue
of whether said company had &quot;exclusive rights&quot; to perform the plays)

In other words, K &amp; S stipulated to two out of three facts
that they perceived were contained in the statement made by R &amp; K,
removing those two facts from litigation,
but telling the court that the third fact,
the identity of &quot;William Shakespeare,&quot; the author,
remained open to determination by the trier of fact.
(the court or the jury)

I'll address the issue of whether WS was &quot;an actor&quot; on another post.

I hope this was useful (and relatively clear)

Cordelialy,

Christine

Right. I'm wrong. (Been doing that a lot lately. Must be boredom.)

I first thought Peter had a good point about how quickly the actors would
have to hustle back and forth and didn't think it through. In actuality, the
eight days between performances at Hampton would have been sufficient time
to travel to Burley on the Hill in Rutland and back, even by Peter's
calculations. Not a leisurely jaunt, but then again they were a working
company. The fact that the court record shows the gap is support that the
traveling troupe that performed on the 1st was the LCM.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Men, what companies were active in London in 1596?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Rob

&gt; A few facts worth noting:

&gt; 1) The Lord Chamberlain's Men did not even exist until June 1594,
&gt; after Q1 Titus had been published, so we naturally can't expect
&gt; that company to be mentioned in that quarto.

&gt; 2) Similarly, Shakespeare obviously cannot have written the play
&gt; while he was a member of the Chamberlain's Men, for the same
&gt; reason. He must have been either a freelance playwright or
&gt; associated with another company, most likely one of the three
&gt; mentioned in the quarto.

&gt; 3) Henslowe's Diary shows that Titus Andronicus was performed
&gt; by Sussex's Men at the Rose on 23 January 1594, when it was
&gt; marked 'ne' (indicating a new or newly licensed play). It took in
&gt; 3 pounds 8 shillings, a good haul but not quite the best for
&gt; Sussex's in this run. (Huon of Bordeaux and George a Green had
&gt; each taken in 3 pounds 10 shillings on December 28-29, during
&gt; the Christmas holidays.) Sussex's Men performed Titus again on
&gt; 28 January and 6 February, and it took in 40 shillings (or 2 pounds)
&gt; each day. But playing in London was suspended indefinitely
&gt; because of plague after the 6 February performance, and the
&gt; play was entered on the Stationer's Register by John Danter
&gt; the same day.

&gt; 4) In May the Lord Chamberlain's Men were created and given
&gt; a license to act in London, with the Admiral's Men the only other
&gt; company given such a right (at least in theory). In early June, the
&gt; Lord Chamberlain's and Admiral's Men acted together at Newington
&gt; Butts (a mile south of the city) for an 11-day run, from 3-13 June.
&gt; They performed Titus Andronicus on 5 June and 12 June, with
&gt; takings of 12 shillings each time. By 15 June, the Admiral's Men
&gt; were able to return to the Rose and begin playing there by
&gt; themselves, and they continued to do so with few interruptions
&gt; for the next several years.

&gt; 5) Henslowe's Diary shows that the Admiral's Men performed
&gt;&quot;The Seven Days of the Week&quot; on 1 January 1596, the day of the
&gt; performance of Titus at Burley, and that they performed &quot;The Wise
&gt; Man of Westchester&quot; on 30 December and &quot;Crack Me This Nut&quot; on
&gt; 2 January. This shows pretty conclusively that they were not the
&gt; company at Burley.

&gt; 6) The Chamberlain's Men do not appear in Henslowe's Diary
&gt; after that June 1594 run, and neither does Titus Andronicus.
&gt; The Admiral's Men men appear in the Diary through the end of
&gt; 1596 with only minor interruptions, and Titus Andronicus is nowhere
&gt; mentioned among the plays they performed. The Chamberlain's
&gt; Men, as noted above, certainly had the rights to the play by the
&gt; publication of the 1600 quarto. All this suggests to me that if any
&gt; London company had the rights to Titus in 1596, it was the
&gt; Chamberlain's Men. One cannot prove this with metaphysical
&gt; certainty, of course, but that's what the evidence suggests to me.

&gt; 7) Siobhan Keenan has a detailed discussion of this 1596
&gt; performance of Titus in her book *Traveling Players in Shakespeare's
&gt; England*, pp. 77-86. It's worth reading, as is the whole book.

I agree on the issue that R &amp; K wrote their essay for persons other
than LynnE and Roger, and I duly note that others
do not stipulate to the issue of whether William of Stratford
was ever an actor.

Anyone who disputes the statement that William Of Stratford
was an actor may offer evidence to the contrary.
I admit that there is evidence to support the assertion that
he was an actor. There is also evidence to support the assertion
that William of Stratford was a shareholder.
I hoped I made it clear that the issues of
&quot;shareholder&quot; and &quot;actor&quot; are not mutually inclusive.

R &amp; K deliberately obfuscate the two issues,
although I'm not sure why,
because it undermines their credibility.

I.e., because William of Stratford is listed *first*
as a shareholder of the company, it does not logically follow
that he was a &quot;prominent&quot; shareholder.
Because William of Stratford is listed first
as an actor in a play, it does not logically follow
that he was a &quot;prominent&quot; actor. This is especially true wherein
they show one instance where William is listed &quot;first&quot; with
the implication that this is an indication of &quot;prominence,&quot;
followed by another instance where the ordering is different.
This is especially weak when comparing William the Actor
with Burbadge the Actor on the issue of &quot;prominence.&quot;

As the token &quot;interested but uninformed layperson,&quot;
this attempt at &quot;bootstrapping&quot; William Of Stratford's
acting abilities or shareholder rank into &quot;prominence&quot;
fairly reeks of the possibility that R &amp; K are actually uncertain
of their own position vis a vis William of Stratford as &quot;author,&quot;
or may be engaging in irony, a well-known English hobby.

R &amp; K's argument would be more cogent if they separated the two issues
of &quot;actor&quot; and &quot;shareholder&quot; into their respective categories.

I made it clear that the inclusion of the word &quot;prominent&quot;
in connection to the word &quot;actor&quot; amounts to pure speculation,
which once again undermines their credibility,
is irrelevant and invites argument to the contrary,
especially where you have Alleyn and Burbadge as yardsticks,
and if &quot;prominence&quot; is accepted without argument,
it becomes the stuff of myth, more difficult to eradicate with time.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Continuing with my response to Roger Stritmatter and Lynne Kositsky's
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; critique of the Reedy/Kathman essay.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; We note the obvious: that this sheds no light on
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; William Shakespeare of Stratford as an author.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; So what? It's not intended to do so. Their main point, here in Part
&gt; 2
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of their essay, is that someone named William Shakespeare was involved
&gt; with the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; company.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Their point is that this evidence is duplicative, in that it supports
&gt;&gt;&gt; a point already previously stipulated, but sheds no additional light
&gt;&gt;&gt; on the main issue. I.e., just because A+A+A+A+A = 5A, it does not
&gt;&gt;&gt; logically follow that the Actor wrote plays. A hundred more references
&gt;&gt;&gt; to William the actor would not move the argument in the direction
&gt;&gt;&gt; of William the author. Recall again, that we have no references
&gt;&gt;&gt; lauding Shakespeare as an &quot;orator.&quot;

&gt;&gt; The reason why R&amp;K cite &quot;duplicative&quot; evidence that Shakespeare of
&gt;&gt; Stratford was an actor is that many anti-Stratfordians deny it, just
&gt;&gt; as many deny that the Stratford Man had the same name as the author
&gt;&gt; the plays. Some of S&amp;K's asides (e. g., their harping on the way that
&gt;&gt; the name is spelled in Shakespeare's signatures and their nitpicking
&gt;&gt; about whether Shakespeare was a &quot;prominent&quot; actor) hint that their
&gt;&gt; stipulation is not wholly sincere. Be that as it may, they are
&gt;&gt; disingenuous when they imply that their willingness to accept these
&gt;&gt; propositions is widely shared by their fellow travelers and that R&amp;K
&gt;&gt; therefore did not need to address them at such length.

&gt; The genesis of the essay was the antiStratfordian claim that there was no
&gt; contemporary evidence for the authorship of William Shakespeare of
&gt; Stratford. It was later expand into presenting the contemporary evidence for
&gt; his authorship. The fact that he was a player in the company that had
&gt; exclusive right to his plays is certainly relevant to the question.

&gt; TR

"/>

Peter Farey has already partially addressed the issue of whether
there is evidence that Shakespeare's plays were performed by
other companies. However, I will state that R &amp; K's assertion
that because there is no proof that William of Stratford
wrote for only one company in his entire career,
there is therefor no proof that the Chamberlain's Men
had the &quot;exclusive&quot; right to perform &quot;all&quot; of Shakespeare's plays,
which is the (completely unneccessary) blanket assertion
made by R &amp; K, again inviting contradiction,
(exposing them to suspicions of practicing irony)
undermines their credibility, and if accepted in the manner asserted,
becomes ingrained and the stuff of myth.

&gt; Q2(1600) added the Lord Chamberlain's Men to the
&gt; list of those who had performed it. If another
&gt; company was known to have played it, I'm fairly
&gt; sure we'd see a fifth name on the list.

&gt; Rob

&gt;&gt; TR

&gt;&gt; After all, not one
&gt;&gt;&gt; of those companies(Derby's, Sussex's, or Pembroke's)
&gt;&gt;&gt; was around in 1596.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Other than the Lord Admiral's Men and the Lord Chamberlain's
&gt;&gt;&gt; Men, what companies were active in London in 1596?

&gt;&gt;&gt; Rob

"/>

Derby's Men still existed in 1596, though only the Lord Admiral's and
Lord Chamberlain's Men were licensed to play in London. Because the
Admiral's Men performed at court on January 1st and the Chamberlain's
Men on December 28th, neither could have given the provincial
performance (except by spinning off a splinter company for the purpose
- not unheard of but not likely during the Court season). Therefore,
my guess is that Derby's Men put on &quot;Titus&quot; at Burley-on-the-Hill.
Calling them &quot;London comedians&quot; was not a great stretch. The
Admiral's-Chamberlain's duopoly was less than two years old, and
Derby's had been active in London before then. Also, the individual
cast members doubtless had plenty of London experience.

Neither the Pembroke nor the Sussex company (the other two known to
have acted &quot;Titus&quot;) is a possibility, as both dissolved before 1596.

For details, see the pertinent chapters of Andrew Gurr's
&quot;Shakespearian Theatrical Companies&quot;.

There were Oxfordians who did, and others who denied him the

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Again, Stritmatter and Kositsky's remarks are preceded by '&gt;'.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Reedy and Kathman's remarks are preceded by '&gt;&gt;'.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;We will now respond to section 2 point by point:

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 2. William Shakespeare was an actor in the company which
performed
&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; plays of William Shakespeare.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; We have already stipulated to this statement phrased correctly
that
&gt;&gt; is:
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; William Shakespeare was an actor in the company which performed
the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; plays of &quot;William Shakespeare&quot;. However, it may be helpful to
&gt;&gt; examine
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; each item in this category.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (A minor question about words: is &quot;stipulated&quot; being used correctly
in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the above paragraph?)

&gt;&gt;&gt; Yes, the term is used correctly.

&gt;&gt; Hi Christine

&gt;&gt; I'm assuming you've got some legal training, as you've stepped forward
to
&gt;&gt; give a firm opinion on this, so I'd be grateful if you could expand on
this
&gt;&gt; a little.
&gt;&gt; I'd always assumed that legal 'stipulation' meant that both sides agreed
on
&gt;&gt; a piece of evidence, so when I read the S&amp;K remarks (as above), I
thought
&gt;&gt; that they *weren't* using 'stipulate' correctly, because they had
amended
&gt;&gt; the wording. Although all they've done is add quotes to the second
instance
&gt;&gt; of William Shakespeare, that does change the implicit meaning to
something
&gt;&gt; that R&amp;K haven't themselves agreed, or stipulated, to.
&gt;&gt; Thanks for your input

&gt;&gt; James Doyle
&gt;&gt; No legal training beyond reading Scott Turow's novels :)

&gt; Yes, James, I are duly licensed to practice law,
&gt; a subject of endless amusement to my children.
&gt; Legal training warps the mind.
&gt; Don't try it if your mind is already warped.

&gt; As to your question:

&gt; In the beginning of a hearing or trial, generally the court will
&gt; ask for &quot;stipulations of fact.&quot;
&gt; (as well as stipulations of law, but that's not an issue here)
&gt; Any stipulation removes the issue from litigation,

&gt; i.e., if a party offered a fact, and the other side stipulated to it,
&gt; the stipulating party is then precluded from offering any evidence
&gt; which tends to disprove the stipulated fact.

&gt; (incidently, if the offering party then introduces at trial some
&gt; evidence that disputes the fact they offered for stipulation,
&gt; this introduction &quot;opens the door&quot; for the stipulating party
&gt; to offer evidence in contradiction to their own stipulation
&gt; if it benefits their case: see what I mean by &quot;warped?&quot;)

&gt; One party might offer a statement for stipulation
&gt; that contains more than one fact, as, for instance,

&gt;&quot;William Shakespeare was an actor in the company
&gt; which performed the plays of William Shakespeare.

&gt; This statement was interpreted by K &amp; S to include not one
&gt; but three facts (it's actually four or five):

&gt; 1) William Shakespeare was an actor. (stipulated)

&gt; 2) in the company of players that performed the plays
&gt; of William Shakespeare (Not stipulated).

&gt; The addition by K &amp; S of quotation marks indicates that
&gt; the issue of whether the actor and the author were one and the same person
&gt; will be a disputed fact, otherwise K &amp; S would be precluded
&gt; from offering evidence of this fact at trial.
&gt; The R &amp; K tactic of including multiple facts in the same statement
&gt; is often used and often successful when not intercepted by the unwary.

&gt; 3) With their rephrasing, K &amp; S also stipulated
&gt; that William Shakespeare was an actor in the *same* company of players
&gt; that performed the plays of the author, William Shakespeare.
&gt; (I've included this because there is a dispute as to the issue
&gt; of whether said company had &quot;exclusive rights&quot; to perform the plays)

&gt; In other words, K &amp; S stipulated to two out of three facts
&gt; that they perceived were contained in the statement made by R &amp; K,
&gt; removing those two facts from litigation,
&gt; but telling the court that the third fact,
&gt; the identity of &quot;William Shakespeare,&quot; the author,
&gt; remained open to determination by the trier of fact.
&gt; (the court or the jury)

&gt; I'll address the issue of whether WS was &quot;an actor&quot; on another post.

&gt; I hope this was useful (and relatively clear)

&gt; Cordelialy,

SNIP

I was only addressing the silliness of K/S's complaint that K/R were presenting
&quot;duplicative evidence,&quot; which complaint you seemed to be agreeing with. As for
your other thoughts, I'm neutral at the moment. Eventually, I hope to discuss
the K/S critique in detail. I expect then to make up my mind about
actor/shareholder/etc. I'll just add that being a shareholder meant in most
cases being an actor. That is, just about all shareholders were actors, though
not all actors were shareholders. As for the issue of &quot;prominence,&quot; that
Shakespeare was a prominent actor (and first place on lists of actors then was
often given to a company's most prominent actor), it doesn't improve the case
that Shakespeare was an actor, but does improve the case that he was no

"/>

As far as I know, Alleyn never was a member of the King's Men, so I don't
see how he can be a &quot;yardstick&quot; of how prominent Shakespeare was in the
King's Men.

Cast lists, from what I understand, listed players of the biggest roles in
descending order, just like today. If that's true, Shakespeare was a
prominent cast member in at least one of Jonson's plays, Every Man in His
Humor, and a less prominent member in another, Sejanus.
It seems to be a half-baked tradition, based on nothing more than
speculation, that Shakespeare wasn't a very accomplished or well-known
actor. That view is undermined by the Dr. Altrocchi's discovery of the
&quot;Roscius&quot; annotation.

Shakespeare was an original shareholder in both the Globe and the
Blackfriars, and was a shareholder in the King's Men acting company as well.
In legal documents that did not list all the shareholders, he was listed
along with Burbage as a principal occupant of the Globe.

I suppose a count could be made in all the relevant documents to see how
many times each shareholder is listed. I think that would give a rough
measure of each member's prominence, given that least prominent members of
any organization tend to be mentioned less in both legal and other
documents. I suspect Shakespeare' prominence would be sustained if such a
count were made.

&quot;Prominent&quot; does not mean &quot;preeminent&quot;. One can reasonably say that
Noel Coward was a &quot;prominent&quot; actor without implying that he was the
peer of John Barrymore.

That Shakespeare was well-known as an actor is shown by, for instance,
John Davies' well-known epigram (&quot;To Our English Terence&quot;), whose
reference to its subject's having &quot;played some kingly parts in sport&quot;
would be pointless if he were an obscure bit player. While Reedy and
Kathman's argument does not depend upon the extent of Shakespeare's
thespian accomplishments, their characterization doesn't strike me as
&quot;the stuff of myth&quot;.

John Southworth's &quot;Shakespeare the Player&quot; makes a thorough, though
occasionally speculative, case for the importance of Shakespeare's
acting career.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Their point is that this evidence is duplicative, in that it supports
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;a point already previously stipulated, but sheds no additional light
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;on the main issue.

&gt;&gt;&gt;The Reedy/Kathman essay was not written for LynnE and Roger alone, but also for
&gt;&gt;&gt;people NOT stupulating to Shakespeare's being an actor. It is quite proper for
&gt;&gt;&gt;R/K to advance as much evidence that he was an actor as they can to make their
&gt;&gt;&gt;point that he was indeed an actor.

&gt;&gt;&gt;--Bob G.

&gt;&gt;I agree on the issue that R &amp; K wrote their essay for persons other
&gt;&gt;than LynnE and Roger, and I duly note that others
&gt;&gt;do not stipulate to the issue of whether William of Stratford
&gt;&gt;was ever an actor.

&gt; I stipulate they wrote it for its own merit and did
&gt; not aim it to any audience beyond readers.

"/>

Then you are mistaken.

Reedy &amp; Kathman expressly dedicated their website (where the essay appears)
as follows:

&quot;This website is for the intelligent nonspecialist who doesn't know
what to make of these challenges to Shakespeare's authorship.&quot;

R &amp; K accuse the Oxfordians of failing to &quot;follow the basic standards
of scholarship.&quot;

&quot;Oxfordian books can be deceptively convincing to a reader
who is unaware of the relavent historical background
and unused to the rhetorical tricks used by Oxfordians.&quot;
...
&quot;Our aim is to provide context where needed, expose misinformation
passed off by Oxfordians as fact, and in general show
the nonspecialist reader why professional Shakespeare scholars
have so little regard for Oxfordian claims.&quot;

As the type of person toward whom the website is addressed,
I suspect that they are indulging (unneccessarily in my opinion)
in some of the same hocus-pocus by deliberately stating inferences
as though they were factual, instead of drawing the inference
*within the body of their work.* When this &quot;fact&quot; is revealed
in other sources to be an &quot;inference,&quot; and
R&amp;K lose a measure of credibility with their expressly
targeted audience, wherein said audience wonders what other
inferences they've &quot;factualized.&quot;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; Anyone who disputes the statement that William Of Stratford
&gt;&gt;was an actor may offer evidence to the contrary.

&gt; There were Oxfordians who did, and others who denied him the
&gt; possibility based on their assigned illiteracy,

"/>

That is the Oxfordian privilege, but as their argument is
the weaker one, based on the evidence that William Of Stratford
*was* an actor, the bystander is left wondering why R &amp; K
feel compelled to &quot;shore up&quot; their argument with &quot;facts&quot;
about how &quot;prominent&quot; an actor William of Stratford was,
when it's a peripheral issue at best.

and others such as the

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; learned Dr. Altrocchi who limits Shakespeare to being a player,
&gt; based on Dr. Altrocchi's landmark discovery of the Camden
&gt; note. Evidence can overwhelm its bearer, as Dr. Altrocchi may
&gt; realize if he breaks through any imposed limitations of denying
&gt; Shakespeare at all costs.

"/>

Dr. Altrocchi can think whatever he likes. Various persons hold
that he Camden notation IMPLIES that the unidentified note-maker
sees Shakespeare Of Stratford as an actor, not a playright(our Roscius)
(rather than our Terence or Plautus or Seneca)
[setting aside the dispute as to the word &quot;plane&quot; or &quot;plani&quot;]
The notation can be added to the traditional body of evidence
that William Of Stratford was an actor, and to the Oxfordian
body of evidence that William Of Stratford was *only* an actor.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;I admit that there is evidence to support the assertion that
&gt;&gt;he was an actor. There is also evidence to support the assertion
&gt;&gt;that William of Stratford was a shareholder.
&gt;&gt;I hoped I made it clear that the issues of
&gt;&gt;&quot;shareholder&quot; and &quot;actor&quot; are not mutually inclusive.

&gt; But the coincidence of at least five other players being shareholders
&gt; is considerable.

"/>

Are you referring to the shareholders of the Globe?
My understanding is that their were seven in the beginning.
Richard and Cuthbert owned a 1/2 share between them
(somebody can clarify whether this 1/2 was undivided)
and that William Shakespeare, Will Kempe, Thomas Pope,
Augustine Phillipps, and John Heminge owned 1/5 each of the other half.
In section 4 of their essay, R &amp; K deliberately leave out ALL
shareholders other than Shakespeare and Richard Burbage,
giving the impression that they were the only two.
I see no reason to do so other than to make Shakespeare
appear to have a larger share than he actually had.

If you are referring to the shareholders of the Company...

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;R &amp; K deliberately obfuscate the two issues,

&gt; Untrue.

"/>

True:

They fail to state when Shakespeare became a shareholder
in the Lord Chamberlain's men.

They imply meaning to the order in which Shakespeare's name
appears among the other actors on the lists of members
without stating any authority for the inference that
this demonstrates Shakespeare's &quot;prominence&quot; as an actor.
There are five such lists, the order varies across
all five, and R &amp; K make no attempt to differentiate
the reason for such variation. They simply state,
&quot;See? Shakespeare's name is &quot;first,&quot; or &quot;second only to,&quot;
when it is, and ignore the positioning when it doesn't suit
their argument.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;although I'm not sure why,
&gt;&gt;because it undermines their credibility.

I should think the question of the definition of &quot;prominence&quot;
is more appropriately addressed to Mr. Reedy and Dr. Kathman.

Shakespeare is a &quot;prominent&quot; actor in what way?

Because:

He is very tall, has a big nose?

Is an Elizabethan Johhny Depp?

Appears in lots of plays?

Plays big-league parts? [like Burbage]

Is a popular/well-known actor? [like Kempe]

Is a distinguished/respected orator? [like Alleyn]

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; This is especially true wherein
&gt;&gt;they show one instance where William is listed &quot;first&quot; with

&gt;&gt;This is especially weak when comparing William the Actor
&gt;&gt;with Burbadge the Actor on the issue of &quot;prominence.&quot;

I stand by this argument. We have some contemporary

performances that season, the gap does appear to be
a bit too much of a coincidence to me.

Recall, neither the question, nor my answer,
addresses the issue of the *wisdom*
of the particular stipulation.

I addressed the question as a matter of procedure,
rather than substance, although I admit that the distinction
can become blurred in the present context.

Cordelialy,

I was not suggesting you were.
Here it's Stritmatter.

The 'question of procedure' would be
appropriate if this was a court of law
and all the parties were litigants with
some right to claim private or personal
knowledge as to certain facts -- when
they could justifiably 'stipulate to' as
regards this, that or the other . . .

The verb 'stipulate' is an ordinary one,
with a well-known meaning. I am sure
that you are right in saying that it can
have a peculiar legal sense. But what
possible justification is there for
introducing that around here?

How about pretentiousness, laziness
and confusion?

How about efficiency?

The word &quot;stipulate&quot; has many meanings,
inluding to cover something with stipules.

K &amp; S's use of &quot;stipulate&quot; implied that they agreed with certain
factual assertions made by R &amp; K, and removed those particular
factual assertions from the debate.

Your complaint appeared to not be concerned with whether the word
was used correctly, but instead it appeared as though
you were addressing the issue of whether K &amp; S
*should have* stipulated to the correctness of R &amp; S's factual assertions,
and you suggested those factual assertions needed closer scrutiny.

If my interpretation is incorrect, please explain.

Cordelialy,

Christine

What can 'efficiency' mean here?

The issue is clarity. Stritmatter writes
with all the perspicacity of a hippo
clearing its bowels. There is a common
and perfectly adequate word for his
context: it is 'accept'.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt; 2. William Shakespeare was an actor in the company which performed the
&gt;&gt;&gt; plays of William Shakespeare.

&gt;&gt; We have already stipulated to this statement phrased correctly that is:
&gt;&gt; William Shakespeare was an actor in the company which performed the
&gt;&gt; plays of &quot;William Shakespeare&quot;.

"/>

Stritmatter could have said &quot;We accept
that . . . &quot;. But that would have been
too straightforward. He wants to impress;
he has never learnt how to think clearly,
nor how to express himself in simple
plain words . . . so we get the turgid,
confusing, nonsense that we have seen.
He should also, of course, as a matter of
honesty and courtesy make clear that
other Oxfordians (and maybe other anti-
Strats) hold a different point of view.
His &quot;we stipulate to . . &quot; muddies the
waters, so no one (including himself)
knows what he is talking about.

Paul.
