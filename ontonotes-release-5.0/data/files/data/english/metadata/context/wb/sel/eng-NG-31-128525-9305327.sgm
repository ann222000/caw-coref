hug, prayer, recipe, household

whatever the Lord and
His Holy Spirit leads ok!
Remember We Are Family,
Lets all Share A Hug, &amp; Prayer,
God Bless you and all
your loved ones! GrannyFaith
Great Big Heart hug's,
and lots of love,

Lets Pray
Dear Heavenly Father,
Thank You for blessing me
with a deep and lasting
peace that surpasses any
understanding. Your peace
provides me with comfort in
times of sorrow; with joy
and laughter in times of
unhappiness; strength in
times of weakness; freedom
in times of captivity;
mercy in times when
I fall short and sin; and love in
times when I feel unloved.
I pray that others seek
this confidence and security
that can only be found
through Jesus Christ, Your
only Son, in whose name, I
pray. Amen.

Thursday's
Inspiration
You have been invited to
become a member of God's
family. I know that
sounds strange: ordinary
humans entering into
a relationship with the
God that created them. Yet that's
exactly what God has offered us.
You'll hear this referred
to in different ways:
salvation, being born
again, coming to Jesus, becoming
a Christian. While many other terms
are appropriate, I can best
relate to the idea of coming into God's
family.You see, God is a God of
relationships. It was He
that came looking for
man, not vice versa. The Bible
tells us that it was love that motivated
God to reach out to man.
It was God who first made the gesture of
trying to fix our broken relationship.
But what happened to our
relationship with God?
Why did it need fixing?
If He created us, why can't
we all just be with Him? The way I
understand it, it all comes down
to God's nature. For example, God is
light, so darkness cannot be
where He is. God is truth, so all untruth
is away from Him. God is life,
so death is banished from His presence.
And God is holy, God is pure,
God is untouched by evil. Therefore
everyone who has sinned cannot
live with God. And because we all have
sinned, we are disqualified
from being in God's family.
Humans, imperfect as we
are, can come to be
included in God's family.
The stains that sin leaves
last a lifetime ... and beyond.
Only someone
who has never sinned can
possibly take them away.
That's why God sent
His son Jesus. Jesus came to
earth and lived a life without sin. His
unjust death opened the way
for us to receive the forgiveness of our
sins. We can let His death be
the payment for our sins. His innocent
blood is able to wash away the
stains of sin, allowing us to be holy
like God, allowing us to be
adopted into God's family.
This is the good
news that God has for mankind:
through Jesus Christ
and His death, God
has provided the way in
which we can have a
complete relationship with
Him. Humans, imperfect as we
are, can come to be included
in God's family.
The apostle John wrote about
Jesus: &quot;Yet to all who received him, to
those who believed in his name,
he gave the right to become children of
God-- children born not of
natural descent, nor of
decision or a
husband's will, but born of
God.&quot; (John 1:12-13)

This new life is a free gift of
God through faith in Jesus Christ. If
you want to know more about
this life that only Jesus can give you,
sign up for one of our Bible courses.
Wherever you are in life,
whatever you've done,
you can begin again.
You may also contact us
at i ... @hopeforlife.org
if you have questions
about becoming
a new creation.

Lets Pray To Jesus
Lord Walk With Me:
My Jesus My Friend,
walk with me today.
Hand In Hand,
guide me to learn and
to know what is good.
Arm in Arm, help me to grow
in my Faith and in Love 4 others.
Side By Side, stay by me
to protect me and show
me Your Ways. Heart To Heart,
help me to pray &amp; to be
all that You want me to be.
Thank You, Jesus for the
special love you
have for me. Amen

A Special Thank you

Thanks for giving me your ears
and listening when I need a friend.
Thanks for giving me your heart
and caring so much about me.
Thanks for giving me a shoulder
when I needed someone to lean on.
Thanks for giving me a hand
to help me through many
a troubled time.
Thanks for giving me you -
it's been the best gift
I've ever received!

God Bless U, Love,
GrannyFaith

_Word of God_ ( http://www.berthadudde.de/download/down_in.php?nummer=14 )

'I WILL COME LIKE  A THIEF IN THE NIGHT....'
People  carelessly pay no attention to the signs of the time, nothing seems
unusual to  them, and they accept every happening without realising its
significance. And  they do not believe the proclamations about the impending natural
disaster  either, for they think that the time which is mentioned in the
Scriptures has  not yet come.... They do not  accept any kind of explanation because
the thought that people of the present  time should be the victims is
inconvenient to them. Therefore the forthcoming  event cannot be made plausible to
them either and they will be taken by surprise  and be unprepared when the day
arrives. And these are the people to whom the  Lord says 'I will come like a
thief in the night....' They will be fast asleep  and will have made no
preparations, and their souls will suffer serious hardship  when they are recalled from
earth. They will not be able to call upon God  anymore because the magnitude
of the disaster will deprive them of every  thought.... God's love will not
let anything happen to humanity without  informing them first.... And He warns
them a long time in advance yet He will not  force people to believe these
warnings.
However,  anyone who pays attention to the signs will not find it difficult
to believe.  And anyone who is in contact with God will also feel God's
admonition in his  heart. He will become aware of the signs of the time himself and
he will try to  attain God's grace, that is, he will appeal for it and commend
himself to God's  mercy.... Only a short time separates you humans from this
event, and you should  use this time so that you can expect it with composure....
You should not  entertain the thought that you are perfect and have no need of
mercy, you should  humbly entrust yourselves to God's love and always believe
that your last hour  has come.... you should listen to the admonitions of those
who, as representatives  of God, bring you His Word; you should know that the
hour is not far away and  always be ready. And God's love and mercy will help
you during the hours of  adversity. He will remember you as you remember Him...
. He will spare your life if  it is helpful for you, or He will remove you
from the earth and grant you a  better life in the beyond if you are worthy of
it.... But woe to those who  approach this hour unprepared and lose their life....
Their fate in the  beyond will truly not be an easy one. And God wants to
protect people from this  by announcing the forthcoming events to them and
admonishing them to turn around  if their way of life does not correspond to His
will. And thereby He will  demonstrate the Words of the Holy Scriptures 'I will
come like a thief in the  night, therefore watch and pray....' Amen

Here is my Scripture:..
Hebrews 4:12-13
For the word of God is
quick, and powerful, and sharper
than any two edged sword,
piercing even to the dividing
asunder of soul and spirit,
and of the joints and marrow,
and [is] a discerner of the
thoughts and intents of the
heart. Neither is there any
creature that is not manifest in
his sight: but all things
[are] naked and opened unto the
eyes of him with whom we have to do.

God Bless U, Love,

_Word of  God_ ( http://www.berthadudde.de/download/down_in.php?nummer=14 )

ANNOUNCEMENT OF  THE CATASTROPHE....
I  convey a proclamation to you which is extremely important. You must
prepare  yourselves for the forthcoming turn of events, for soon I will visibly
appear.  The time given to you is coming to an end and My Word will fulfil itself,
to the  joy of a few and the horror of many people who have recognised and
shall again  recognise Me when I express Myself and demonstrate My will and My
power. You are  at the final stage in order to then take a path full of
deprivations and  tribulation, for this is needed for people who shall experience My
power in  order to reach out and grasp My helping hand. My last teaching
method seems to  be relentless and cruel to people and yet it is only based on My
love, for  countless souls will go astray without this final means and I still
want to gain  a few by using it. Recognise My love in the fact that I have
announced and  persistently continue to announce the forthcoming event to you in
order to make  you believe, if you don't want to believe it beforehand....
You  will all have to experience fearful hours and the survivors must endure
most  difficult conditions which seem insufferable to them. Yet I promise My
strength and help to all  who call upon Me in spirit and in truth. I will not
take notice of lip prayers  but only of the call that rises up to Me from the
bottom of your heart.... This  will be granted, and every adversity will be
lessened and thus become tolerable  for people who believe in Me.... News will reach
you about worldly plans and  measures yet they shall be shattered by My will,
you will hear about new danger  but should know that a different danger is
approaching and that you need not  fear the former and should only direct your
attention to Me and My kingdom and  that you must join Me ever more closely in
order to receive more strength for  the hours of greatest need.... I say this to
you because My love wants to  prepare you for that which is inevitable and
will happen according to My eternal  plan, because you still require much
strength and have to receive it through a  sincere will, heartfelt prayer and
activity of love. Only take care of your  souls and let go of all earthly worries,
come to Me in every adversity and  difficulty so that you will never distance
yourselves from Me, so that you will  constantly stay in contact with Me and
then also feel My presence when I speak  to you humans from above with a voice of
thunder.... so that you will not be  afraid of Me but appeal to Me as your
Father of eternity for His protection,  which He will surely grant you.... Amen

Saturday
Inspiration
Jesus said, &quot;Ask, and it will
be given you; search, and
you will find; knock, and the
door will be opened for you.&quot;
-Matthew 7:7 (NRSV)
MY friend Dawson died
recently. He was a true person
of prayer, one of the most
devout people I have ever known.

He told me once about how,
as a child, he prayed one
day to God for a sack of
marbles. Then, he said, he
held out his hands, expecting
the marbles to fall from heaven
into his grasp. He laughed as
we recalled it. In the intervening
decades Dawson had learned,
as we all do, that prayer is
rarely answered so dramatically.

Some people, when they lose
their childhood illusions
about prayer, give up praying
altogether. They reason, If
God is not going to give me
what I ask for, what's
the point of praying?

But Dawson did not forsake   prayer. In fact, just the   opposite was true: Throughout   his life he began each day by    greeting his Lord, and he   continued to breathe prayers    of thanksgiving and petition   throughout the day. He no   longer had the naive understanding    of prayer that he had as a   child, but he lived each    moment in the confidence   that God truly does answer   our prayers. And God answers    in ways that are greater and    more profound than we   could possibly imagine.
Lets Pray
Loving God, grant us patience
when we pray and the
assurance that you hear
and answer. Amen.

Give Of Your Best

Give of your best to the Master:
Give Him first place in Your heart;
Give Him first place in your service,
Consecrate every part.
Give and to you shall be given;
God His blessed Son gave;
Gratefully seeking to serve Him,
Give Him the best that you have.

Happy Birthday to all our
October Friends All
around the world, have a
blessed and Holy Spirit filled
day and year with Jesus,
Seek His Face and
His Presence
hold tight to HIS  HAND
each and e veryday!!
I love you, God Bless u!

_Word of God_ ( http://www.berthadudde.de/download/down_in.php?nummer=14 )

THE PRESENT TIME WILL LEAD TO THE  END....
And  time and again I say to you: You will experience the end.... It is an
urgent  wake-up call which I send to people who presently inhabit the earth, it
is a  call which I will still intensify because you need to let go of your
conviction  that you still have much time left, because you need to spend thought
on a  sudden end and try to come close to Me. You have only little time left
and very  soon will be startled out of your calm, fear will enter your hearts
which you  can only banish by calling upon Me, by faithful prayer, which will
provide you  with strength and composure. The time is fulfilled, and even if
you resist this  thought.... you must prepare yourselves for whatever the end
entails. It is you  who will experience the last battle, who ought to win it;
it is you who will  experience the last Judgment, who will either see My coming
in the clouds and  the homecoming of the righteous or the final act of
destruction take place,  depending on your attitude towards Me, depending on your
will and your love. It  is you who must make a decision since you will not be
able to enter the kingdom  of the beyond after your death if you side with the
adversary, but you will have  to repeat the process through the creation of the
new earth according to My  eternal counsel. Do not expect the end in the
future, get used to the idea that  the present time will lead to the end, that you
will be affected and that  everything will come upon you as seers and
prophets predicted according to My  will. I can only ever draw your attention to it
and as confirmation of My Word  speak to you from above, and I will implement
it shortly because there is not  much time until the end.
I will  inform you, whose will to serve Me made you My Own, once again of
this just  before the end, so that you will not experience the day unprepared,
for even  though you believe that My Word is truth you are still not taking My
prediction  seriously enough, you are still counting on a reprieve and not on
My speedy  arrival which, however, is about to happen to you. Yet you will
yearn for My  arrival when the time of the battle of faith comes and you enter the
last stage  of this earthly period. Then you will have learned to despise the
world, you  will have no further desire for earthly possessions, you will
only yearn for My  Word, and I will also always be with you in the Word and
comfort you until the  day when I will appear in the clouds, when your adversity
has reached huge  proportions and help can only come from Me. You must take it
for granted that  you will experience this time if I won't recall this or that
servant of Mine  prematurely, according to wise judgment. You will all be
surprised as to how  quickly events will unfold, which I predicted long in advance
through the voice  of the spirit. And once I appear the end will come upon
you with giant strides.  Anyone who is profoundly faithful will inwardly rejoice
despite hardship and  suffering, for he will know that he will be compensated
one day, that sooner or  later all adversity will have an end and that a new
era will start again with  the paradise, as I have promised.... Amen

needs Lord  heal the broken
hearted, set the captive free,

name,amen

Dearest Father God:
Thank You that when I received
Jesus as my Savior, I stepped
into a position with Him in the
heavenlies, not because
I earned it or deserved it,
but because it is Your gift
to me. Thank You, Father,
that this position is above
all the powers and dominions
of this world and the spiritual
world. Help me today to
stand in the authority of
this position with the powers
of darkness under my feet,
knowing that You have
disarmed them and that
I need not be bent under them!
Keep my heart focused on You.
Keep sharp my desire to
confess you &amp; the daily things
that put a block in my
relationship with You.
Thank You, Father, for the
victorious position You have
provided, for me as Your child.
Help me to live in this identity
today! In Jesus' strong
name I pray, amen
My prayers are with u always,

TOPIC: THE SPIRIT OF THE ANTICHRIST....

_Word of  God_ ( http://www.berthadudde.de/download/down_in.php?nummer=14 )

THE SPIRIT OF THE  ANTICHRIST....
The  spirit of the Antichrist reigns wherever I Am not recognised. That is
where he  has already caused his work of confusion, he has weakened people's
power of  realisation, he obscured everything, he has displaced the truth and
deluded  people with his deceptive light, having used his power as My adversary
and thus  worked against Me. His favourite weapon is to tear the image of the
divine  Redeemer Jesus Christ from people's hearts and thus he works against
Christ, and this to an ever increasing extent the closer it gets to the end. It
is his achievement that people distanced themselves from Me, that they no
longer  believe in Jesus Christ and therefore don't find the way to Me anymore;
and yet  his activity is only possible because people do not resist his
onslaughts and  the beginnings of his activity. For they can defend themselves if
they  want to.... They live on earth as completely independent beings and have
absolute free will. They are far away from Me but at the start of their
embodiment as a human being also so far away from My adversary that he cannot
force them to become subject to him. I gave people the means to absorb the
impressions surrounding them with heart and mind and to think them through in  their
heart and with their intellect, for I did not create automatons who must
carry out their activity according to the Master's law; I externalised you as
free beings, gave you intellect and reason and constantly influence you through
all events in a helpful sense....
However, he, too,  will not let his power go to waste. He will likewise try
to influence your will  but the final decision rests with you humans yourselves...
. Nevertheless, you only  need to use the means at your disposal.... you only
need to ensure that you  receive My spirit of love, My strength, which will
enable you to resist all your  enemy's onslaughts. You can always gain this
strength by merely practising love  yourselves, thus by acquiring My strength of
love, which you can use without  limits but which can only be gained through
activity of love. My adversary is an  enemy of love and you will always be able
to conquer him if you stand up to him  with the weapon of love. Then you will
take the path of Christ, you will take  the path of love which He travelled
too, then you will follow Him and He will be  your patron, your leader, He will
have become your Redeemer as a result of your  will which has joined Him
through love.... However, as long as humanity lacks love  it will not recognise Him,
and this is caused by My adversary who believes he  can increase his power by
reducing the power of Jesus. He conspicuously directs  his activity against
Him, and every person who turns away from Jesus Christ, who  renounces Him, who
rejects Him when He confronts Him in the Word is controlled  by the Antichrist;
he is an antichrist himself who willingly carries out what  Satan impels him
to do.... Beware of these antichrists, even if they pretend to  strive for the
same noble goals.... They are in his power and are therefore also  My adversaries
and will have to pay for their antagonism on the day of Judgment,  which is
very close.... Amen

All to Jesus I surrender.   Not my will but yours be   done in my life.       Dearest Abba Father God,    you have given us the power   to change, and I ask you,   Holy Spirit, to expose   any fear or doubts that try to    linger.

You are   effectually helping me work   out my salvation. In the name   of Jesus, I thank you for    loving me. Amen.

_Word of God_ ( http://www.berthadudde.de/download/down_in.php?nummer=14 )

DAY OF SALVATION  OR DAY OF JUDGMENT ? ....
The  day of Salvation is not far away anymore, but will it mean salvation for
all  human beings? Will it not be a day of Judgment when, instead of being
released,  they will be banished again in the solid form? And therefore the day
can be  yearned for but also be dreaded, yet those who would have to fear it
don't  believe in it and are therefore irretrievably lost because they don't
do  anything in order to avert this renewed banishment from themselves. This
day  will only be a true salvation for a few people, but they have suffered
prior to  it already, whereas the others don't know suffering and therefore do not
long  for a Redeemer either. And yet He will come and redeem those who
believe in  Him.... A very difficult time is approaching all believers, but then they
should  not forget the promise that 'I will come again to judge the living and
the  dead....' The time of hardship shall also be evidence of the truth of My
Word to  them and they shall believe even more firmly in My coming on the last
day, in  their deliverance from utmost adversity. It will truly be a day of
Salvation for My  Own who are tempted to doubt the truth of My Word in view of
the disbelievers'  good living standards.... Yet for the sake of the chosen few
the days shall be  shortened.... I will fortify My Own until the day has come,
and it will come  sooner than expected....
The  state of the world will seem so peaceful that no-one will believe in an
end; for  under the authority of the Antichrist the waves of unrest apparently
calm down  and an earthly progress can be recognised which makes people
become ever more  ungodly, ever more heartless, and only My Own recognise thereby
the hour on the  world clock. For only they will have to go hungry and suffer
while the rest of  humanity will indulge itself and try to find satisfaction in
the euphoria of the  world. No-one will suspect how close the end is when the
Antichrist starts his  world dominion. He will instigate the  end, he will
achieve spiritual chaos, he will cause the battle of faith to erupt  and will
more or less cause the separation of the spirits, for under his regime  the
confession will be demanded for Me and My name and thus the final decision  will
also be made, which still has to take place before the end.... However, as  soon
as this decision of faith is demanded of you, My faithful followers, you  can
also brace yourselves for My second coming, for with the ever increasing
adversity you will also experience the fulfilment of My predictions concerning
the end.... You can expect the end every day and yet, it will come suddenly and
unexpected.... But  then those for whom this day will bring redemption will be
blissfully happy,  and there shall be  weeping and gnashing of teeth by those
who will be devoured by the earth, who  will be engendered into solid matter
again.... You, who believe in Me, trust My  Words that you will be delivered from
hours of extreme tribulation, that I will  come and fetch you and that you
therefore should fear nothing on earth, for Mine  is the strength and the power
and the glory.... Amen
