&quot;Giftzwerg&quot; as a term is a German cultural icon from old children
stories, a kind of mix between Ebenezer Scrooge and a Leprechaun.

So the guy you met was probably a 10-year old German kid - and he
kicked your butt - kinda figures :)

Hey, lets be clear about this... My engineer won the day! This guys was just
buzzing around my like a mosquitto... Annoying but but rarely fatal.

But if I'm honest, being 37 and positively ancient in gaming terms, I do get
wasted by loads of spotty little gits who jump around faster than I can
focus! ETQW is not a thinking mans game.

I tend to *think* more (and better) than all the kiddies, but unfortunately,
ETQW doesnt really reward this.It's a fun game, but it's not very cerebral,
even for an FPS.

&quot;Talking all serious and trying to sound intellectual about wargames
by pretending [our] wargames are somehow superior because they use
real world units and not orcs&quot; is cheap entertainment.  Watching
idiots like you pull your entrails out through your asshole trying to

... *that* is funny!  From a game designer standpoint I totally agree
with you.  Even the &quot;loser&quot; part!  I'm just a Freeciv loser, not a
*.war-historical loser.  I spend waaaay too much time contemplating
square tiles to be confused with having a life.  3:51 AM and I'm
thinking, should I try again?

One of the reasons I argue &quot;off topic&quot; politics is because it's a real
wargame.  Real protesters sway real voters who elect real
Congresspeople who cause real policy changes on real battlefields
where people really die.  The reason I argue the &quot;off topic&quot; politics
*here* instead of the usual Usenet political conspiracy groups, is
because wargamers have higher average intelligence and knowledge on
the subject of warfare.  Thus I am spared the usual liberal blather of
all wars being Vietnam, and the usual conservative blather of all
enemies being Hitler.

And how much fun can trolling be when you're forced to troll without any
real recognition, due to continually having to change your nym - added
to the fact that your only interaction boils down to changing your nik,
getting a post past the killfiles, getting laughed at and called a
dimwit by all concerned, who promptly alt-K you again.
