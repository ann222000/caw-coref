The Case for Boycotting Israel
Boycott Now!

By VIRGINIA TILLEY

Johannesburg, South Africa.

It is finally time. After years of internal arguments, confusion, and
dithering, the time has come for a full-fledged international boycott
of Israel. Good cause for a boycott has, of course, been in place for
decades, as a raft of initiatives already attests. But Israel's war
crimes are now so shocking, its extremism so clear, the suffering so
great, the UN so helpless, and the international community's need to
contain Israel's behavior so urgent and compelling, that the time for
global action has matured. A coordinated movement of divestment,
sanctions, and boycotts against Israel must convene to contain not
only Israel's aggressive acts and crimes against humanitarian law but
also, as in South Africa, its founding racist logics that inspired and
still drive the entire Palestinian problem.

That second goal of the boycott campaign is indeed the primary one.
Calls for a boycott have long cited specific crimes: Israel's
continual attacks on Palestinian civilians; its casual disdain for the
Palestinian civilian lives &quot;accidentally&quot; destroyed in its
assassinations and bombings; its deliberate ruin of the Palestinians'
economic and social conditions; its continuing annexation and
dismemberment of Palestinian land; its torture of prisoners; its
contempt for UN resolutions and international law; and especially, its
refusal to allow Palestinian refugees to return to their homeland. But
the boycott cannot target these practices alone. It must target their
ideological source.

The true offence to the international community is the racist
motivation for these practices, which violates fundamental values and
norms of the post-World War II order. That racial ideology isn't
subtle or obscure. Mr. Olmert himself has repeatedly thumped the
public podium about the &quot;demographic threat&quot; facing Israel: the
&quot;threat&quot; that too many non-Jews will--the horror--someday become
citizens of Israel. It is the &quot;demographic threat&quot; that, in Israeli
doctrine, justifies sealing off the West Bank and Gaza Strip as
open-air prisons for millions of people whose only real crime is that
they are not Jewish. It is the &quot;demographic threat,&quot; not security (Mr.
Olmert has clarified), that requires the dreadful Wall to separate
Arab and Jewish communities, now juxtaposed in a fragmented landscape,
who might otherwise mingle.

&quot;Demographic threat&quot; is the most disgustingly racist phrase still
openly deployed in international parlance. It has been mysteriously
tolerated by a perplexed international community. But it can be
tolerated no longer. Zionist fear of the demographic threat launched
the expulsion of the indigenous Arab population in 1948 and 1967,
created and perpetuates Israel's occupation of the West Bank and Gaza
Strip, inspires its terrible human rights abuses against Palestinians,
spins into regional unrest like the 1982 attack on Lebanon (that gave
rise to Hezbollah), and continues to drive Israeli militarism and
aggression.

This open official racism and its attendant violence casts Israel into
the ranks of pariah states, of which South Africa was the former
banner emblem. In both countries, racist nationalist logic tormented
and humiliated the native people. It also regularly spilled over to
destabilize their surrounding regions (choc-a-block with &quot;demographic
threats&quot;), leading both regimes to cruel and reckless attacks. Driven
by a sense of perennial victimhood, they assumed the moral authority
to crush the native hordes that threatened to dilute the organic
Afrikaner/Jewish nations and the white/western civilization they
believed they so nobly represented.

A humiliated white society in South Africa finally gave that myth up.
Israel still clings to it. It has now brought Israel to pulverize
Lebanon, trying to eliminate Hezbollah and, perhaps, to clear the way
for an attack on Iran. Peace offers from the entire Arab world are
cast aside like so much garbage. Yet again, the Middle East is plunged
into chaos and turmoil, because a normal existence -- peace, full
democracy -- is anathema to a regime that must see and treat its
neighbors as an existential threat in order to justify the
rejectionism that preserves its ethnic/racial character and enables
its continuing annexations of land.

Why has this outrageously racist doctrine survived so long, rewarded
by billions of dollars in US aid every year? We know the reasons. For
too many Westerners, Israel's Jewish character conflates with the
Holocaust legacy to make intuitive sense of Israel's claim to be under
continual assault. Deep-seated Judeo-Christian bias against Islam
demonizes Israel's mostly Muslim victims. European racist prejudice
against Arabs (brown-skinned natives) casts their material
dispossession as less humanly significant. Naïve Christian visions of
the &quot;Holy Land&quot; naturalize Jewish governance in biblical landscapes.
Idiot Christian evangelistic notions of the Rapture and the End Times
posit Jewish governance as essential to the return of the Messiah and
the final Millennium (even though, in that repellent narrative, Jews
will roast afterwards).

All those notions and prejudices, long confounding international
action, must now be set aside. The raw logic of Israel's distorted
self-image and racist doctrines is expressed beyond confusion by the
now-stark reality: the moonscape rubble of once-lovely Lebanese
villages; a million desperate people trying to survive Israeli aerial
attacks as they carry children and wheel disabled grandparents down
cratered roads; the limp bodies of children pulled from the dusty
basements of crushed buildings. This is the reality of Israel's
national doctrine, the direct outcome of its racist worldview. It is
endangering everyone, and it must stop.

Designing the Campaign

Much debate has circulated about a boycott campaign, but hitherto it
has not moved beyond some ardent but isolated groups. Efforts have
stalled on the usual difficult questions: e.g., whether a boycott is
morally compulsory to reject Israel's rampant human rights violations
or would impede vital engagement with Israeli forums, or whether
principled defense of international law must be tempered by (bogus)
calls for &quot;balance&quot;. Especially, recent debate has foundered on calls
for an academic boycott. Concerns here are reasonable, if rather
narrow. Universities offer vital connections and arenas for
collaboration, debate, and new thinking. Without such forums and their
intellectual exchange, some argue, work toward a different future is
arguably impeded.

But this argument has exploded along with the southern Lebanese
villages, as Israeli university faculties roundly endorse the present
war. As Ilan Pappé has repeatedly argued, Israel's universities are
not forums for enlightened thought. They are crucibles of reproduction
for racist Zionist logics and practice, monitoring and filtering
admissible ideas. They produce the lawyers who defend the occupation
regime and run its kangaroo &quot;courts&quot;; the civil planners and engineers
who design and build the settlements on Palestinian land; the
economists and financiers who design and implement the grants that
subsidize those settlements; the geologists who facilitate seizure of
Palestinian aquifers; the doctors who treat the tortured so that they
can be tortured again; the historians and sociologists who make sense
of a national society while preserving official lies about its own
past; and the poets, playwrights, and novelists who compose the
nationalist opus that glorifies and makes (internally, at least)
moralistic sense of it all.

Those of us who have met with Jewish Israeli academics in Israeli
universities find the vast majority of them, including well-meaning
liberals, operating in a strange and unique bubble of enabling
fictions. Most of them know nothing about Palestinian life, culture,
or experience. They know strangely little about the occupation and its
realities, which are crushing people just over the next hill. They
have absorbed simplistic notions about rejectionist Arafat, terrorist
Hamas, and urbane Abbas. In this special insulated world of illusions,
they say nonsense things about unreal factors and fictionalized
events. Trying to make sense of their assumptions is no more
productive that conversing about the Middle East with the Bush
administration's neo-cons, who also live in a strange bubble of
ignorance and fantasy. Aside from a few brave and beleaguered souls,
this is the world of Israel's universities. It will not change until
it has to--when the conditions of its self-reproduction are impaired
and its self-deceptions too glaring.

The Real Goal: Changing Minds

The universities represent and reproduce the bubble world of the
Israeli Jewish population as a whole. And no people abandons its
bubble willingly. In South Africa, Afrikaners clung to their own
bubble--their self-exonerating myths about history, civilization, and
race -- until they were forced by external sanctions and the
collapsing national economy to rethink those myths. Their resistance
to doing so, while racist, was not purely vicious. Many kind and
well-meaning Afrikaners simply didn't believe they had to rethink
ideas that manifested to them as givens and that shaped their reality.
(One valued Afrikaner friend here recalls her life during apartheid
South Africa as being like The Truman Show, a film in which a man
unknowingly grows up in a television show, set in an artificial dome
world designed to look like a small town.) When their reality fell
apart, suddenly no one would admit to ever having believed or
supported it.

The Zionist worldview is an even more complete system. All historical
and geographic details are provided to create a total

White Supremacist Busted on Child-Porn Charge
Leading Intellectual of Racist Movement Was Arrested by Federal Agents

By MARCUS BARAM
Jan. 4, 2007
A leader of the white supremacist movement was arraigned today on
charges of possession of child pornography and witness tampering after
being arrested by FBI agents Thursday night at his home in
Charlottesville, Va.

Kevin Alfred Strom, founder of the National Vanguard white supremacist
group, was considered the leading intellectual of the movement since
the death of William Pierce, the author of the notorious &quot;Turner
Diaires.&quot;

Strom was arraigned in U.S. District Court in Charlottesville, charged
with the two counts, and is currently being held at a facility in the
city. According to the indictment, he allegedly possessed or attempted
to possess &quot;multiple images of child pornography&quot; on his computer's
hard drive.
Strom was also charged with witness tampering, which involved
physically assaulting and mentally intimidating a witness to his
criminal activity.

Israel has been our loyal ally since 1948. Remember that Irael fought

Soviet Armor,

&gt; The Case for Boycotting Israel
&gt; Boycott Now!

&gt; By VIRGINIA TILLEY

&gt; Johannesburg, South Africa.

&gt; It is finally time. After years of internal arguments, confusion, and
&gt; dithering, the time has come for a full-fledged international boycott
&gt; of Israel. Good cause for a boycott has, of course, been in place for
&gt; decades, as a raft of initiatives already attests. But Israel's war
&gt; crimes are now so shocking, its extremism so clear, the suffering so
&gt; great, the UN so helpless, and the international community's need to
&gt; contain Israel's behavior so urgent and compelling, that the time for
&gt; global action has matured. A coordinated movement of divestment,
&gt; sanctions, and boycotts against Israel must convene to contain not
&gt; only Israel's aggressive acts and crimes against humanitarian law but
&gt; also, as in South Africa, its founding racist logics that inspired and
&gt; still drive the entire Palestinian problem.

&gt; That second goal of the boycott campaign is indeed the primary one.
&gt; Calls for a boycott have long cited specific crimes: Israel's
&gt; continual attacks on Palestinian civilians; its casual disdain for the
&gt; Palestinian civilian lives &quot;accidentally&quot; destroyed in its
&gt; assassinations and bombings; its deliberate ruin of the Palestinians'
&gt; economic and social conditions; its continuing annexation and
&gt; dismemberment of Palestinian land; its torture of prisoners; its
&gt; contempt for UN resolutions and international law; and especially, its
&gt; refusal to allow Palestinian refugees to return to their homeland. But
&gt; the boycott cannot target these practices alone. It must target their
&gt; ideological source.

&gt; The true offence to the international community is the racist
&gt; motivation for these practices, which violates fundamental values and
&gt; norms of the post-World War II order. That racial ideology isn't

&gt; doctrine, justifies sealing off the West Bank and Gaza Strip as
&gt; open-air prisons for millions of people whose only real crime is that
&gt; they are not Jewish. It is the &quot;demographic threat,&quot; not security (Mr.

&gt; 4 planes and a couple of attacks against US installations hardly
&gt; constitutes the destruction of America.

&gt;&gt; Israel and Western Civilization. While 19 Muslim radicals, dedicated
&gt;&gt; to Allah,
&gt;&gt; set out from Saudi Arabia to inflict as much destruction on Americans
&gt;&gt; in the USA.

&gt; So why didn't your humane and honest politicians go after Saudi ,
&gt; instead of Afghanistan and Iraq?

&gt;&gt; They succeeded by murdering innocent airline passengers including
&gt;&gt; women, children
&gt;&gt; and babies. They destroyed the World Trade Center killing nearly 3000
&gt;&gt; people
&gt;&gt; of all races and religions at work and then went on to the Pentagon to
&gt;&gt; damage

&gt; Spare a thought for the half a million, yes that's right HALF A
&gt; MILLION Iraqi's killed (most of them children) by sanctions before the
&gt; war even started.

&gt;&gt; as much of it as it could killing Americans at work. Much of the
&gt;&gt; entire Muslim
&gt;&gt; world cheered the destruction of the WTC and photographs of Osama bin
&gt;&gt; Laden were

&gt; How do you know? Did you see those Israeli's cheering, dancing and
&gt; filming the collapse of the WTC?

&gt;&gt; eagerly bought up by Islamic supporters. Clearly and without
&gt;&gt; equivocation the
&gt;&gt; message and aim of Osama bin Laden is the destruction of the United
&gt;&gt; States,Jews,
&gt;&gt; Christians and the West to be replaced by Islam. And the Islamic
&gt;&gt; radicals from

&gt; Bin Laden wanted the US to keep it's nose out of Arab business, that's
&gt; all.

&gt;&gt; Afghanistan, Palestine, Iran, Saudi Arabia and many others are on
&gt;&gt; track with their
&gt;&gt; aims. What do you hear from these supporters? Attacks on Jews and
&gt;&gt; Israel and the

&gt; Israel kills 4 Palestinians to every Israeli, not rocket science, even
&gt; for you.

&gt;&gt; supporters of Israel as if Jews were to blame! It were Muslims who
&gt;&gt; killed 3000
&gt;&gt; Americans. It were Muslim radicals that later blew up London busses
&gt;&gt; and trains
&gt;&gt; killing people of all races and religions. Of course Americans support
&gt;&gt; Isreal.
&gt;&gt; Israel has been our loyal ally since 1948. Remember that Irael fought
&gt;&gt; a war
&gt;&gt; against five Arab amies intent on it's destruction, supported by
&gt;&gt; Soviet Armor,
&gt;&gt; Aircraft and technicians. The defeat of those 5 armies, destruction of
&gt;&gt; Soviet

&gt; I also remember Israel attacking for 2 hours a defenceless USS
&gt; Liberty, do you?

&gt;&gt; bombers on the ground and the capture of 1,000 Soviet tanks led to the
&gt;&gt; humiliation of the Soviets and their retreat from the region. Who
&gt;&gt; should
&gt;&gt; we support? Syria? Iran? Hezbollah that killed hundreds of American
&gt;&gt; Marines
&gt;&gt; in Lebanon?

&gt; Hizbullah gave Israel a bloody nose last year. Hopefully it will deter
&gt; Israel from bullying it's neighbours in future. The fact is that
&gt; without it's overwhelming air superiority, Israel would be totally
&gt; fucked because on the ground Hizbullah just picked them off.

Yeah. Israel needs to behave like decent human beings if they
want our support.

The Case for Boycotting Israel
Boycott Now!

By VIRGINIA TILLEY

Johannesburg, South Africa.

It is finally time. After years of internal arguments, confusion, and
dithering, the time has come for a full-fledged international boycott
of Israel. Good cause for a boycott has, of course, been in place for
decades, as a raft of initiatives already attests. But Israel's war
crimes are now so shocking, its extremism so clear, the suffering so
great, the UN so helpless, and the international community's need to
contain Israel's behavior so urgent and compelling, that the time for
global action has matured. A coordinated movement of divestment,
sanctions, and boycotts against Israel must convene to contain not
only Israel's aggressive acts and crimes against humanitarian law but
also, as in South Africa, its founding racist logics that inspired and
still drive the entire Palestinian problem.

That second goal of the boycott campaign is indeed the primary one.
Calls for a boycott have long cited specific crimes: Israel's
continual attacks on Palestinian civilians; its casual disdain for the
Palestinian civilian lives &quot;accidentally&quot; destroyed in its
assassinations and bombings; its deliberate ruin of the Palestinians'
economic and social conditions; its continuing annexation and
dismemberment of Palestinian land; its torture of prisoners; its
contempt for UN resolutions and international law; and especially, its
refusal to allow Palestinian refugees to return to their homeland. But
the boycott cannot target these practices alone. It must target their
ideological source.

The true offence to the international community is the racist
motivation for these practices, which violates fundamental values and
norms of the post-World War II order. That racial ideology isn't
subtle or obscure. Mr. Olmert himself has repeatedly thumped the
public podium about the &quot;demographic threat&quot; facing Israel: the
&quot;threat&quot; that too many non-Jews will--the horror--someday become
citizens of Israel. It is the &quot;demographic threat&quot; that, in Israeli
doctrine, justifies sealing off the West Bank and Gaza Strip as
open-air prisons for millions of people whose only real crime is that
they are not Jewish. It is the &quot;demographic threat,&quot; not security (Mr.
Olmert has clarified), that requires the dreadful Wall to separate
Arab and Jewish communities, now juxtaposed in a fragmented landscape,
who might otherwise mingle.

&quot;Demographic threat&quot; is the most disgustingly racist phrase still
openly deployed in international parlance. It has been mysteriously
tolerated by a perplexed international community. But it can be
tolerated no longer. Zionist fear of the demographic threat launched
the expulsion of the indigenous Arab population in 1948 and 1967,
created and perpetuates Israel's occupation of the West Bank and Gaza
Strip, inspires its terrible human rights abuses against Palestinians,
spins into regional unrest like the 1982 attack on Lebanon (that gave
rise to Hezbollah), and continues to drive Israeli militarism and
aggression.

This open official racism and its attendant violence casts Israel into
the ranks of pariah states, of which South Africa was the former
banner emblem. In both countries, racist nationalist logic tormented
and humiliated the native people. It also regularly spilled over to
destabilize their surrounding regions (choc-a-block with &quot;demographic
threats&quot;), leading both regimes to cruel and reckless attacks. Driven
by a sense of perennial victimhood, they assumed the moral authority
to crush the native hordes that threatened to dilute the organic
Afrikaner/Jewish nations and the white/western civilization they
believed they so nobly represented.

A humiliated white society in South Africa finally gave that myth up.
Israel still clings to it. It has now brought Israel to pulverize
Lebanon, trying to eliminate Hezbollah and, perhaps, to clear the way
for an attack on Iran. Peace offers from the entire Arab world are
cast aside like so much garbage. Yet again, the Middle East is plunged
into chaos and turmoil, because a normal existence -- peace, full
democracy -- is anathema to a regime that must see and treat its
neighbors as an existential threat in order to justify the
rejectionism that preserves its ethnic/racial character and enables
its continuing annexations of land.

Why has this outrageously racist doctrine survived so long, rewarded
by billions of dollars in US aid every year? We know the reasons. For
too many Westerners, Israel's Jewish character conflates with the
Holocaust legacy to make intuitive sense of Israel's claim to be under
continual assault. Deep-seated Judeo-Christian bias against Islam
demonizes Israel's mostly Muslim victims. European racist prejudice
against Arabs (brown-skinned natives) casts their material
dispossession as less humanly significant. Naïve Christian visions of
the &quot;Holy Land&quot; naturalize Jewish governance in biblical landscapes.
Idiot Christian evangelistic notions of the Rapture and the End Times
posit Jewish governance as essential to the return of the Messiah and
the final Millennium (even though, in that repellent narrative, Jews
will roast afterwards).

All those notions and prejudices, long confounding international
action, must now be set aside. The raw logic of Israel's distorted
self-image and racist doctrines is expressed beyond confusion by the
now-stark reality: the moonscape rubble of once-lovely Lebanese
villages; a million desperate people trying to survive Israeli aerial
attacks as they carry children and wheel disabled grandparents down
cratered roads; the limp bodies of children pulled from the dusty
basements of crushed buildings. This is the reality of Israel's
national doctrine, the direct outcome of its racist worldview. It is
endangering everyone, and it must stop.

Designing the Campaign

Much debate has circulated about a boycott campaign, but hitherto it
has not moved beyond some ardent but isolated groups. Efforts have
stalled on the usual difficult questions: e.g., whether a boycott is
morally compulsory to reject Israel's rampant human rights violations
or would impede vital engagement with Israeli forums, or whether
principled defense of international law must be tempered by (bogus)
calls for &quot;balance&quot;. Especially, recent debate has foundered on calls
for an academic boycott. Concerns here are reasonable, if

&gt; stalled on the usual difficult questions: e.g., whether a boycott is
&gt; morally compulsory to reject Israel's rampant human rights violations
&gt; or would impede vital engagement with Israeli forums, or whether
&gt; principled defense of international law must be tempered by (bogus)
&gt; calls for &quot;balance&quot;. Especially, recent debate has foundered on calls
&gt; for an academic boycott. Concerns here are reasonable, if rather
&gt; narrow. Universities offer vital connections and arenas for
&gt; collaboration, debate, and new thinking. Without such forums and their
&gt; intellectual exchange, some argue, work toward a different future is
&gt; arguably impeded.

&gt; But this argument has exploded along with the southern Lebanese
&gt; villages, as Israeli university faculties roundly endorse the present
&gt; war. As Ilan Pappé has repeatedly argued, Israel's universities are
&gt; not forums for enlightened thought. They are crucibles of reproduction
&gt; for racist Zionist logics and practice, monitoring and filtering
&gt; admissible ideas. They produce the lawyers who defend the occupation
&gt; regime and run its kangaroo &quot;courts&quot;; the civil planners and engineers
&gt; who design and build the settlements on Palestinian land; the
&gt; economists and financiers who design and implement the grants that
&gt; subsidize those settlements; the geologists who facilitate seizure of
&gt; Palestinian aquifers; the doctors who treat the tortured so that they
&gt; can be tortured again; the historians and sociologists who make sense
&gt; of a national society while preserving official lies about its own
&gt; past; and the poets, playwrights, and novelists who compose the
&gt; nationalist opus that glorifies and makes (internally, at least)
&gt; moralistic sense of it all.

&gt; Those of us who have met with Jewish Israeli academics in Israeli
&gt; universities find the vast majority of them, including well-meaning
&gt; liberals, operating in a strange and unique bubble of enabling
&gt; fictions. Most of them know nothing about Palestinian life, culture,
&gt; or experience. They know strangely little about the occupation and its
&gt; realities, which are crushing people just over the next hill. They
&gt; have absorbed simplistic notions about rejectionist Arafat, terrorist
&gt; Hamas, and urbane Abbas. In this special insulated world of illusions,
&gt; they say nonsense things about unreal factors and fictionalized
&gt; events. Trying to make sense of their assumptions is no more
&gt; productive that conversing about the Middle East with the Bush
&gt; administration's neo-cons, who also live in a strange bubble of
&gt; ignorance and fantasy. Aside from a few brave and beleaguered souls,
&gt; this is the world of Israel's universities. It will not change until
&gt; it has to--when the conditions of its self-reproduction are impaired
&gt; and its self-deceptions too glaring.

&gt; The Real Goal: Changing Minds

&gt; The universities represent and reproduce the bubble world of the
&gt; Israeli Jewish population as a whole. And no people abandons its
&gt; bubble willingly. In South Africa, Afrikaners clung to their own
&gt; bubble--their self-exonerating myths about history, civilization, and
&gt; race -- until they were forced by external sanctions and the
&gt; collapsing national economy to rethink those myths. Their resistance
&gt; to doing so, while racist, was not purely vicious. Many kind and
&gt; well-meaning Afrikaners simply didn't believe they had to rethink
&gt; ideas that manifested to them as givens and that shaped their reality.

&gt; South Africa as being like The Truman
