Hey,

I'm paraphrasing but here's a thought I just read on a beta forum
and it echoes a sentiment that I've heard quite often over the last
few years.  &quot;When I first saw HTTR/COTA, I thought it was going to
take the wargame industry by storm but it never seems to reach the
audience that it should.&quot;

So, my question is, why hasn't Panther's game engine gotten the
audience that many people (myself included) think it should? Here's my
post-mortem, in no particular order.

- 'It needs a woman's touch'; A quote from my girlfriend as she walked
by while I was playing some wargame, I think it was CotA. That doesn't
mean that it needs more eye candy. It refers to the fact that the
screen just looks drab. It's lacking a sense of style when you compare
it to something like BoA.

- It's missing a hook to draw people in. If I knew what that hook was,
I'd be a marketing genius out making millions instead of posting on
usenet but I know it when I see it.  It's that 'damn, this is cool'
moment that all good games have. CotA has that, but I didn't really
get that feeling until I'd been playing with the engine for a couple
of hours. That hook needs to be somewhere in the first hour of
gameplay.

- Where's the demo? I can't think of a game that needs a demo more
than CotA. It's not visually appealing so you aren't going to grab the
interest of people through screenshots. The theater of operations in
CotA is so esoteric that people aren't going ot plop down $50 based on
the subject matter. So all that's left is word of mouth, and that
obviously isn't working well enough. Maybe people are hesitant to
spend that kind of money on a recommendation?  It doesn't need a demo
to show off the game, it needs a more generic demo to show off the
game engine.

- It's missing a 'community'. That's  based on 2 things, I think. The
turnaround both in terms of new releases and patches is glacial by
anyone's standards. Combine that with the fact that the developers
don't encourage modding and there's nothing to keep the game engine
relevant and 'in the news'.

Rgds, Frank

These are two great games.  I really enjoyed both of them.  But let me
humbly submit my own hypotheses as to why CotA and HTTR haven't
dominated the marketplace:

-They are realtime and have no hexes.

It has been my experience that some wargamers are just so wedded to
the old wargaming paradigm that they REFUSE to play a game that does
not fall into their preconceived notions of what a wargame should look
and play like.  This, coupled with no demo, means there is a large
demographic of wargamers that are NEVER under ANY circumstances going
to even give it a shot.

Again, this is not a dig on Panther Games.  All our titles are
realtime, hex-less games, too.  I think this produces a better
simulation of reality.  But not all wargamers feel this way.

*I* almost gave HTTR a pass, and now I'm among the #1 fans of the
system.

If ever there was a game that wanted a demo, it's this one.

I think the map in COTA is superb. The bits I find that stop me from playing
too often are:

i. The reporting of enemy units in FoW. I don't know if it's just me, but
they seem to ping-pong a lot. I'd expect a few duff sightings, but on the
whole I'd expect the intel picture to firm up.

ii. The AI. Sounds strange, but the AI in this game is too bloody good! I
can give general orders to my commanders then retire to my command tent for
tea and medals whilst the commanders' sort out the details. I know it's
realistic, but in many Httr and Cota games I have felt that I'm spectator
rather than a participant

iii. Visceral combat! In common with many modern wargames, Cota and Httr
units select their own targets and fire away. One doesn't get the
satisfaction of picking a target and picking it apart with manual attacks. I
think this situation is exacerbated by the fact that you don't really see
detailed combat results unless you take a look at each individual unit. This
in itself seems to emphasize point ii. above where you are more of a
spectator watching events unfold.

Now, this post is making these games sound bad, but technically, these are
the most accurate and innovative operational games to come out in a long
time. I still have the odd battles with them and I have to say that when I'm
playing, I do feel like a commander rather than a games player. When the
Bulge comes out I will be buying it straight away as I want to support this
system. I'm secretly hoping that one day they will do Utah beach or that
whole peninsula. The engine would be perfect for para drops and the
inevitable link up with the seaborne infantry.

I'm a different saurian; I picked up HTTR in the store and went,
&quot;Shiiiiiiiiit, not Yet Another Market-Garden Game.&quot;  But then I heard
some good buzz from people I didn't think were idiots, so I bought it.
But I think Frank's right; a demo would have been just the ticket.  I DL
demos for every game that's even remotely of interest, and I would have
absolutely given HTTR a look with a demo ... but at a $45 boxed game
buy-point, I almost gave it a pass.

A word, too, about the quality of demos.  Not to beat up on CM:SF too
much, but the two scenarios they selected for their demo were so weak,
listless, and dumb that I wonder why they even bothered.  It's like
their goal was to ensure that nobody could possibly wring any enjoyment
out of the free demo ... because that would be like taking money out of
their pockets!  Call me a lunatic, but I would make sure to populate a
demo I was making with the two *best* scenarios I had ...

... then again, perhaps they did do this!

The Arnhem game had a demo, at least when Panther was still with
Battlefront.

While a demo might help, I have come to believe that the real problem
is the lack of immersion.  While playing--at least the first two games
of the series--I had the feeling that I was playing on a radar screen
miles from the action on the front.

Just FYI, a demo was tried for the first release in the Airborne
Assault series - it did not help sales at all from what I've heard.
Demos for wargames can be tricky things, but I think in a customer's
eyes a demo is always a &quot;win-win&quot; so they assume it must be a positive
thing for the game as well.

COTA has a video trailer and a 5 minute video guide, available here:
http://www.matrixgames.com/games/downloads.asp?gid=313

We have nothing against also releasing a demo for COTA, but it doesn't
exist yet and I'm not convinced it would have a significant effect.

It convinced me to buy the game. &lt;g&gt; ... and it wasn't a very good
demo from what I recall. It gave you a scenario but it didn't really
do anything to showcase the good points of the game engine.

Well yeah. The only downside that I can think of from your perspective
is that you might loose some sales from people who wouldn't  have
liked the game if they'd bought it.

If you're counting on sales to that group in order to make money, I'd
suggest that Matrix reevaluate their business plan. :p

What have you got to loose at this point? Put out a demo scenario, add
a PDF with  a tutorial and some background material for the scenario
to give it some context and see if it doesn't help sales.

From my perspective, it's a lot easier to recommend a game if I can
give a link to a demo instead of telling the person that they have to
risk $50 just to try it.

Maybe it's just me but the older I get the less inclined I am to blow
money on a game that I 'might' like. It's not a matter of disposable
income either, my house and cars are paid for so I have a lot more
money left over than ever before. I think I've just become jaded,
wasted too much money over the years on games that I played for a
couple of hours and never touched again.

I have exactly the same feeling, too little time, too many games in my
collection and 'risking' another buy of an unknown game just doesn't
feel right.
With boardgames that is a bit different, as they are nicely physical
boxes that fill one of my bookcases in the study. They also have some
collection value to me,
them not being digital and thus platform independent, I have the idea
I can still play them in 20 years or so and PC wargames don't give me
that feeling.

For me, I do like HTTR and COTA from a design point of view and am
amazed when playing them how easy it is to just play them! But for
some reason I don't seem to
get into them too. The nice thing about most hex 'n counter wargames
is that they give you instantaneous information after battle: &quot;12th
coy lost 14 men and two AT guns in defence of....&quot; while in COTA I
have to click on the unit and compare the blue strength lines with
what I remember from earlier on. It is a bit like watching an
animation on the news or in a history program on TV showing how a
certain battle went. Maybe I should try playing it with the command
delay off, less realistic but more involvement.

Same here, I have gone from 12+ purchases a year down to 3 this year.
I have piles of games waiting on my &quot;try after patch&quot; list, so why
would I want to try a new release that often?  Just download  an
update to a 1.x I bought in less cynical times and see what has been
fixed/added.  In fact if publishers stopped publishing now I have
enough games to do me a looooong time.

Indeed looking back over the years I see I have started to buy just to
support talent - Panther, AGEOD, the guys who did Advanced Tactics -
and I'll keep buying those.

I wonder is there a lifecycle of an archetypal computer wargamer -
apart from the birth/age/death thing, of course!

I mentioned this before on Matrix forums, there is a definite lack of
immersion, mainly due to the fact you are a more a spectator and less of a
participant. There are a lot of reasons why this is, but I still think the
number one reason is scale.

If you're going to make such a great simulation that handles almost all
tactical decisions for you and provides very limited feedback, then you have
to provide the player with an interactive role in the game somewhere. And
all that is left is strategic decision making. The fact their next game for
the Bulge doesn't include an all encompassing Bulge campaign scenario is
going to doom it to low sales again I think.

Players play games because they want to feel involved in what's going on and
this system takes away almost 90% of player involvement. Because it is so
good, there is no reason even to check up on things much, so you are
basically watching an AI vs. AI conflict. Give the big pictured to the
players and let them make decisions about strategic reserves, long term
goals, strategic redeployments, etc. and the system would shine.

I also think the system would probably do very well at the opposite end of
the scale. Make a squad level game to rival Close Combat and make its path
finding and graphics 100% better and I think you'd have a real winner on
your hands. That would of course require tremendous tweaking of the engine,
so using what you have now I'd say a strategic scale to the game would give
players more of a sense of involvement in what's going on. After all where's
the enjoyment in winning a game where the AI handled 90% of your victory?

exactly. $50 isn't to much for a good game but it's way too much for a
bad game and when you plonk down your money you never know which you

I guess that there are demos and then there are *DEMOS*.

Matrix just released the Harpoon Classic Commanders Edition without a
demo.  Every previous edition always had a demo that consisted of the
*Full* game engine with a few honest-to-God real scenarios to play
(not some piddling tutorial sessions like they did for the old
Harpoon3).  Anyone trying the old demos could see exactly what they
were getting -- no crippled engine or features.  What they played with
the sample scenarios is what they would get if they purchased the
game.  IMHO, it was one of the biggest selling features for the game.
The game literally sold itself.

Now, when folks ask about HCE, we can only point to demos that are
over 18 years old from previous versions that lack all the bells and
whistles of HCE.  However, even those antiquated demos are often
enough to seduce many new potential players.

I think that the developers only shot themselves in the foot by
failing to release a demo with HCE.

&gt;&gt;So, my question is, why hasn't Panther's game engine gotten the
&gt;&gt;audience that many people (myself included) think it should? Here's my
&gt;&gt;post-mortem, in no particular order.

&gt; These are two great games.  I really enjoyed both of them.  But let me
&gt; humbly submit my own hypotheses as to why CotA and HTTR haven't
&gt; dominated the marketplace:

&gt; -They are realtime and have no hexes.
">

Which if you believe what most wargamers say about realism would lead
one to believe that realtime is a big plus. But then they're only saying
that. they really don't want realism. Realism is hard and the more real
it gets the more boring it is except for the short bursts of action that
will occur.

Luckily the Panther series suffers that burst of action thing but only
to a lesser extent since they really aren't realtime but speeded up time.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; It has been my experience that some wargamers are just so wedded to
&gt; the old wargaming paradigm that they REFUSE to play a game that does
&gt; not fall into their preconceived notions of what a wargame should look
&gt; and play like.  This, coupled with no demo, means there is a large
&gt; demographic of wargamers that are NEVER under ANY circumstances going
&gt; to even give it a shot.

Agreed...

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Again, this is not a dig on Panther Games.  All our titles are
&gt; realtime, hex-less games, too.  I think this produces a better
&gt; simulation of reality.  But not all wargamers feel this way.

&gt; PAT PROCTOR
&gt; President, ProSIM Company

The pathes to realtime that both Panther and ProSim took do produce a
better simulation of realtime. Both do a reasonable job of putting the
player into the commanders seat if that is what the player wants (me)
while allowing micro-management if desired.

Unfortunately I've observed over the last 45 years of wargaming, that
though wargamers say they want to sit in the commanders seat, they
really don't. They can't handle it when a unit doesn't do what they want
or expect. Fog of war realisticly implemented is maddening to most; they
don't really understand friction, command and control, logistics etc and
all the myriad things that can go wrong and the consequences. Gamers
want everything in neat little packages and units to do exactly what
they're ordered to even if it's something stupid like fight to the last
man and are surprised when the unit flips the player the virtual finger
and hauls ass.

Wargamers talk a good game and that's what they really want - a game -
not a sim.

It worked for me.  Several weeks after the RDoA demo came out I &quot;finally got
round&quot; to checking it out.  Half an hour later, I was on-line ordering the
game and cursing the fact (in those pre-dd days) that it was going to take a
couple of weeks to get to me.

Demos work.  Correction (picking up on Gifty's point), good demos work.

The problem with Panther games is that I started playing HTTR around 9:30pm
last night and didn't stop until 8:30am this morning. No other wargame has
ever given me the can't stop playing syndrome like this game has. One
improvement that I expect COTA doesn't have but wish it did is that when you
see a message like COY A surrendered etc. you could click on the message and
it would take you to that location on the map.

That's really a great game, even if you are not into RTS. Maybe I'm biased,
because I just love the tabletop WH 40K, but it was the first game that
finally nailed the atmosphere (not the rules, of course). I even bought the
two expansions.

Regarding CM:SF, I'm still waiting for a review copy from Paradox.
Considering that they usually warn us of all the new releases, I find it

DoW isn't bad for an RTS, especially when you slow it down.  I found a
config file edit somewhere on their forums that let you slow down the game
to your liking and it was MUCH better.  There's a lot of detail in the
various units that gets lost when playing at the standard speed.  The
downside of course is that the AI is exposed as not being too smart when
playing at the slower speeds, as it doesn't use all of it's units'
capabilities.  It's got tons of atmosphere, though, and looks pretty good.
Stuff blows up real nice as well.  &lt;g&gt;

Look at it as a turn-based wargame with 1-minute turns and an auto-
continue. Units which have been given orders will remember them from
turn to turn. You can pauze the game at any moment and think about
your next turn(s) for as long as you like.

??? - there's no campaign in the game in the sense that you move from
one scenario to the next in a linked scenario framework. The games
consists of 30+ single scenarios all set in the WWII theatre and
timeframe. Some are taken from IRL others are what-ifs. But if
replayability and space for experimentation is your ticket than you
*really* need to take a closer look at it because that's what these
games are all about. The scenarios are not scripted and the AI will
come-up with a plan based on an evaluation of the current situation.
In other words : when you try something new the AI will *not* simply
perform it's standard scripted plan but will try to counter your
moves.

Hardcore wargamers often don't seem to want to explore the world
beyond turn-based hex games - which for me is the primary reason
Panther Games should release a demo for their upcoming Battles from
the Bulge game as it's the only way to get a foot in the door.

I think they went for real time as it makes for more realistic planning. IE
you would plan for a particular battalion to be Hill 471 by 0630hrs, rather
than planning for a particular battalion to be at Hill 471 by turn 11. This
plus the lack of hexes all adds to a very realistic feel. But alas I
personally find it hard to get into as my subordinates are really good and
seem to run the battles for me!

Rob,

This is not a dig on you, but this is the kind of comment that makes
developers want to hang themselves...

If you force the player to fight his units individually, he says the
AI sucks.  If you create a really cool AI that is super smart, the
player says the game is boring because he feels like a spectator.

Again, I am not take a swipe at you.  I have heard similar comments
many times.  But, FOR THE LOVE OF GOD!!!  Sometimes you just can't
win.

Lol,

Must be frustrating being a wargames developer with customers like me
around! :)

That said, I have bought all their games and this won't change when Bulge
comes out.

With COTA et al, I love the enemy AI, but just wish that one could turn
easily off or restrict the AI for my side, especially for the smaller
scenarios. My idea of a great operational level wargame would be:

i. COTA engine where AI can be disabled easily for particular formations and
the other formations can be taken completely out of the players control for
the larger scenarios. This could enable one to play the same large scenario
many times, but from the focus of different formation's point of view. Kind
of gives you the micro management without having to do it all.

ii. COTA engine with unit reports that aren't so damn inconsistent. I could
be in a battle stretching over many days and the AI will change its mind
about any enemy units type and position almost every minute! I think intel
should firm up over time, especially if the same unit has been engaged
continuously.

iii. Some kind of combat feedback or participation that is a little more
visceral. Even in games where I don't pick the targets like WitP and UV,
combat there is interesting because you see the detail and feel every bomb
hitting the enemy or your ships. I have thought long and hard as to how this
could be incorporated into the COTA engine, but so far the solution evades
me. If I hit on an idea I will be sure to post! :)

iv. COTA in Northern France behind the Utah beaches on June 6th 1944... :))

&gt;&gt;&gt; Hey,

&gt;&gt;&gt;   I'm paraphrasing but here's a thought I just read on a beta forum
&gt;&gt;&gt; and it echoes a sentiment that I've heard quite often over the last
&gt;&gt;&gt; few years.  &quot;When I first saw HTTR/COTA, I thought it was going to
&gt;&gt;&gt; take the wargame industry by storm but it never seems to reach the
&gt;&gt;&gt; audience that it should.&quot;

&gt;&gt; I for one not going even to touch it for several reason:
&gt;&gt; 1. I'm casual gamer and  this is a strange hybrid - operational level

&gt;&gt; 2. I don't see the point why it should be rts. It's not a Harpoon,
&gt;&gt; have no missiles and fighters so real time don't add to realism. There
&gt;&gt; is no redeeming quality for it to be an rts.

&gt; I think they went for real time as it makes for more realistic planning.
&gt; IE you would plan for a particular battalion to be Hill 471 by 0630hrs,
&gt; rather than planning for a particular battalion to be at Hill 471 by turn
&gt; 11. This plus the lack of hexes all adds to a very realistic feel. But
&gt; alas I personally find it hard to get into as my subordinates are really
&gt; good and seem to run the battles for me!

&gt; RobP

But there's the rub.  In HTTR/COTA the player gives an order to a unit that
goes something like: &quot;when you get around to it, go to Hill 471 by whatever
time you get around to arriving.&quot;  Orders are all 'start now + some delay',
when they should be 'this is when you'll finish this task + I expect delays
due to snafus'.

It's the wrong way around, and means all attacks are a matter of shoveling
all units forward then sitting back &amp; watching them arrive in column of
blob.  That's the disconnect for me: the role I should have is planner of
phase lines &amp; decider of rollbahns, but all I do is the equivalent of
herding orcs (or whatever it is the kids click on now).

&lt;shrug&gt;  It's still a good game, but that's a big problem IMHO.

Point taken Mike. One of the things we are working on for BFTB is
adding an interface where the user can set the timings. But this does
involve a fair bit of work to handle all the cases where things don't
go according to the timings specified.

Another option I want to add is the ability for the user to sequence a
series of tasks. When combined with the ability to specify timings,
then you will be better able to orchestrate your master op plan.

Eg. Select force #1 order it to Move to X, then to Y ( each with
different task settings ), then Attack Z with a HHour set for 1300.
Select force #2 order it to Move to A then Attack Z with a HHour set
for 1300. Select force #3 order it to Bombard Z with from 1245 to 1300
at Slow rate of fire and then order it to bombard the Z from 1301 to
1315 at rapid ROF.

I also want to add in Triggers - ie an event that can be used to
activate a task or some other event. The way I envisage it working is
that the user would be able to specify a Named Area of Interest
( NAI ) ( James Sterret - see I have been listening ;) ) just like he
places an order location. The sidebar would show the Trigger settings.
These would include a radius, a trigger type and a state - eg location
= Town X, radius = 2000m, type = enemy occupied, state  = true. Then
the user could order force #1 to Move to Y when the Trigger is
activated. Force #1 would then hold in its current or last location
until the trigger fires at which time it moves to Y.

This would enable the user to specify contingency responses and add
another dimension to the game. It would in fact go a fair way to
educating users on the need to be always thinking ahead, anticipating
developments and planning contingencies to meet them, rather than just
sitting back and watching as the operation unfolds. Good commanders
don't do that, they are always thinking ahead.

BTW I do appreciate the time people have taken here and the feedback
provided. Thank you.

I dunno.  Part of me wants to agree, but an even bigger part is
groaning, &quot;Aaaaaargh, like it's even remotely possible for a GPS /
encrypted satellite commo equipped US Army in *2007* to micromanage
fiddly little 'timings' like this.&quot;

In other words, *should* General Urquart be able to meticulously script
a series of neat &quot;phase lines&quot; and set up elaborately-crafted
&quot;rollbahns&quot; for units to click along with railroad-timetable precision?
Not.  The reality of his situation was ... yep, shoveling battalions *if
he could even talk with them* in the general direction of the objectives
and praying.  Is *every* situation like this?  Nope, but I'd bet not
many WW2 situations lend themselves to a micromanaged arpeggio of bits
calmly ticking into place as the stopwatch advances...

...and this is what we're flirting with.

I'm not saying there shouldn't be some sort of &quot;timings&quot; built into the
system, but the last thing I'd like to see is the system jiggered such
that players could routinely count on neat rows of units ponying up to a
phase line for an 0807 and 17 seconds assault time.

At least give me a slider under the &quot;orders delay&quot; dialog so I can set
the &quot;timings&quot; realism setting to &quot;In Your Dreams, Mr. Stopwatch.&quot;

Points 3 and 4 I can understand, point #2 I cannot. It HAS to be
RTS. If you can't understand why it should be an RTS, not even after
reading all the lengthy arguments on that topic, then this is probably
not the game for you.

You say real time &quot;does not add to realism&quot; but that's reverse
logic. You're raised on turn based cr4p so you think real time does
not &quot;add to realism&quot;. However it should be the other way round. Real
life is an RTS, real battles with real commanders were RTS. So NOW
that we have the computing power and developer prowess to make games
run in real time what additional realism we would get by crippling
them back to turn based mechanics?

That is the question you should be asking.

Yeah, I'll pay that one, but you've got the wrong end of the stick G: I'd
always assumed that the more complex the order the longer the delay.
Telling a formation to stop shouldn't have the same delay as giving it a
complicated attack plan.  I guess the minimum implementation of all this
would be to just add a start time to orders &amp; give an ETA for (I suppose)
each waypoint. If some units jump off late things just go realistically awry
from there.

Triggers sound excellent: real reserves.

Two remarks

1) Scale - a grand strategic game need not be realtime to be more
realistic than a turn-based one

2) There's one very good reason to go turn-based and it's called PBEM.
Given the demographic of wargamers and the reality of timezones this
is often the only option for guys wanting to play multi-player games.
Now, I have proposed a PBEM system for COTA in here before but the
reaction on it wasn't stellar.

Spoken like an old time micromanager, though.  When Rommel radioed a
regimental commander with an attack order, I'll bet he didn't send along
a complex, ready-made &quot;attack plan&quot; - I bet he just just barked,
&quot;DESTROY AUSTRALIAN POSITIONS AT WADI EL-ARJUNA.&quot;

Not much more difficult to conceptualize than &quot;STOP,&quot; is it?

The planning is supposed to take place at the level of the HQ that gets
the attack order.  That's where HTTR/COTA models the delay process -
even going so far as to depict shitty Col. Blimps as taking
significantly longer to get moving that nifty Col. Frosts.

Looking at thing from the other perspective, if you one battalion
&quot;stop&quot; and another &quot;assault at point x,&quot; the battalion with the stop
order will just stop when it gets the order.  The battalion with the
attack order will *begin* the process of attacking when it gets the
order ... but will carry out that attack perhaps hours in the future.
This seems entirely reasonable.

In other words, a system like HTTR is supposed to reward the player who
*doesn't* try to be seven regimental commanders and twenty battalion
commanders and 137 company, platoon, and section commanders all at once.
You're not supposed to send your battalion a &quot;complicated attack plan,&quot;
you're supposed to tell them what you want attacked and let *them* worry
about the fiddly details.

If that includes a specific time for the attack, then I'm with you ...
so long as a neat, by-the-number, coordinated assault only happens
*very* rarely.

I think this would be an excellent addition.  As things stand now,
coordination is a very iffy thing to *attempt*, but it would be more
realistic to make it very easy to order/attempt, but very difficult to
actually carry out.

&gt;&gt; &gt;Again, I am not take a swipe at you.  I have heard similar comments
&gt;&gt; &gt;many times.  But, FOR THE LOVE OF GOD!!!  Sometimes you just can't
&gt;&gt; &gt;win.

&gt;&gt; The fact that CotA doesn't 'grab' you and pull you in seems to be a
&gt;&gt; common element in this thread. It's a catch-22; the better your AI and
&gt;&gt; the more realistic your control delays, the more noticeable this
&gt;&gt; problem becomes.

&gt;&gt; If that's true, it follows that at some point you have to step back
&gt;&gt; and say 'my AI is good enough and I have plenty of features, now what
&gt;&gt; do I do for the playability and style of this game?'

&gt;To be fair to the system, though, while you *can* give orders to very
&gt;high echelon units and essentially let AI play AI, almost nobody every
&gt;does this.  It's like my chess program; I *can* set it to play itself
&gt;... but why do this?  And if I do choose to set it up this way, is it
&gt;valid to complain that my interaction is so limited?
">

Two things:
- It doesn't really matter whether it's a valid compaint or not. It's
a complaint that a lot of people have, and it's a safe bet that it
keeps more than just a few from buying more than one game in the
series.
- Overall, I think it has more to do with lack of immersion than lack
of control. There might be  ways of handling that other than giving
the player more control. A system that gives you more feedback for
example? More eye candy to show a player what's actually occuring?

...which brings us back to your original point and suggests a demo.  I
think it's mainly a perception - and a *wrong* perception - on the part
of people who've never played the game that keeps them away.  I think a
full-featured demo with a couple of decent scenarios might fix this.

Yeah.  I've always thought the messages were a little scanty and
generic.  Maybe do more with them, or let the player set status or
mission popups.
