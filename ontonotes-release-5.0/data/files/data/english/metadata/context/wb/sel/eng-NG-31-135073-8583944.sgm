&gt;&gt;&gt;  To clarify I'm trying to get a CRT 17&quot; apple studio display to work
&gt;&gt;  &gt; with my AGP graphics G4. Any Ideas?

&gt;&gt; For those that don't know, the monitor has a single connector,
&gt;&gt; which passes the Video signal, USB, and POWER to the monitor. The
&gt;&gt; ADC cable plugged into a special port on the back of an Apple
&gt;&gt; supplied Video Card.

&gt;&gt; While there are ADC to DVI adaptors, for plugging LCD based ADC
&gt;&gt; monitors into the port of a DVI graphics card, most only supply 17
&gt;&gt; watts of power.  The CRT monitor needs 22 watts of power.

&gt; I don't think that anyone has pointed this out yet, but the
&gt; Sawtooth AGP slot lacks the power connections to feed the ADC port,
&gt; so none of the ADC video cards will work with that machine.  DVI to
&gt; ADC adapter won't help you without power for the monitor.

&gt; ADC support came in with the Digital Audio, IIRC.
