Hello Jay, Steph, Figgertoes, and rest of group

Well just had my what I thought was my last 6month scans,
I finish scans and go to see my Onc,
He tells me my scans look good except there is a spot near my spine
and he wants to do an upper GI and stick a needle in the scope and
Biopsy the growth, he says he is 99% percent sure it is not Lymphoma
but he dos not say that it is not cancer.
After three years to have to go through this again is unbelievable, I
believe it is not lymphoma do to wear the growth is.
But this scares the life out of me.
Stage four NHL tumours both lungs, six sessions chemo CHOP+R
Remission three years this month.

I have been having serious arm pain have went through surgery for
auller nerve damage in Dec 06 and still no help.
What are the chances this could be yet another cancer.
If so what would the likely type be. It is wrapped around my nerve
channel.
I know there is no such thing as free from cancers grips, we are all
susceptible to cancer. I just needed to let someone know I am scared
everyone seems to think I need to be strong and face it head on and
not worry or realize if it is cancer again I need to fight it and have
a positive outlook, I keep telling them my outlook did not help me
last time chemo did and if it is cancer again it will be chemo  and
what ever treatment they think is best not my smiling freaking face.

Hang fire Frank until you get the results in and know what you are dealing
with.  Of course it's a scary time for you right now and having been on the
cancer rollercoaster before you are bound to have these feelings, but at the
moment it is the &quot;if&quot; factor.  Sadly it is probably one of the main fears
that will live with people that have been through their journey for the rest
of their lives.

Hugs Frank and fingers,toes and elbows crossed that all is okay.

Hello Frank,
You've done the right thing coming here to share that you're scared. Most
cancers have a predictable pattern of recurrence so that explains to me
why the oncologist says he doesn't think it's lymphoma.  I think what
you're having done is an EGD.
http://digestive.niddk.nih.gov/ddiseases/pubs/upperendoscopy/index.htm

I've had a few of those myself, once recently, to look for a source of a
severe bleed and once, many years before to look at an ulcer. I call it
the disappearing ulcer. &lt;g&gt; because sometimes they mention it after scans
and sometimes they don't.  Of course, I don't know if that's what they're
seeing on your scan, so we'll be here waiting with you for the pathology
report and hoping for something benign.  Please keep in touch. If the test
is a while away, keep talking with us, in the meantime.

There is one arm pain, that I know of, associated with lung cancer called
Pancoast syndrome, but I would think they'd be scoping your lung, then;
not the gastro.
The ulnar nerve comes from the medial cord of the brachial plexus.  It is
shown here http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulnar_nerve
Looks to me that it runs down the inferior side of the arm, past the funny
bone, into the last 2 fingers.
What you probably need is someone to do gentle massage and palpation to
see where the pain is triggered from and/or have you do different
tasks/movements to see what triggers the pain. Then the rehab type person
tells you what to avoid, (which might also involve not sleeping on that
side or using an elbow splint during sleep), which muscles to &quot;work&quot; and
which splint to use, if applicable and some do ultrasound or recommend ice
or heat therapy.  I have a bunch of sheets, each with exercises for each
area (hand, wrist, lower arm, upper arm, shoulder, neck) and the rehab guy
circled the ones I was supposed to do X (number of times per day).

Tendonitis?
Arm pain can also be coming from the heart.
If you tell me more about it, maybe we can figure out which expert to see.

When's the gastro test, Frank?  That comes first of course.

Hi Frank,

I started coming to alt.support.cancer around (?) March of this year. It is
a good place to let your fears out, and have people accept them who've been
where you are and I am, and not over-react to them, I think. Certainly has
been an invaluable source of support, information, and encouragement for me.

So welcome back from another person who was raised to never show weakness
(unsuccessful graft of southern macho male thing), and who tends to go for
anger whenever they feel vulnerable (that's me I'm talking about there, not
you).

I'm afraid of a recurrence of my tongue cancer, you bet. The fear is like
some kind of &quot;music&quot; that normally is playing far in the background, almost
inaudible, but once in a while comes to the foreground and really shakes my
soul. But I am more afraid of hidng my fears, as I have in the past, and
then living with the consequences of denial.

It is difficult when you have people around who depend on you to be strong
and in control :  fortunately for me the only one in that category right now
is my cat :)

Good to have you back. While I have no advice on how you might face the wait
for further news, I know that what helped me was staying constantly
intellectually busy, learning new things every day. Between friends, books,
guitar, computer, writing, and cat, I made do.

best, Uncle Sally

Hi, Frank, good to hear from you.  It's been awhile.

I hear you about the waiting.  Very hard &amp; stressful.  In my book, it
takes a strong person to admit to being scared.  I'm sure it's quite
normal to experience a wide spectrum of emotions whan going through
this. Normal &amp; honest.    I hope you stay here with us.

Well let me fill in all the rest.
On Dec 5th last year I had surgery for the  ulner nerve. Never got
better. Been to phys therapy, and am currently in Pain Management.
Currently I am on aVINZA 150MG, Cymbalta, Lyrica, celebrex, 25 mg
Morphine fast acting tabs 3 a dayoh and lets not forget Percocet
10mg/375. So I realize the whole nerve thing. Last scan Onc told my
Neurologist to do an MRI he thinks there may be a lesion on my spine,
this round he says significant change and wants to do a biopsy if it
is nothing then he will send to a neurologist associated with the
cancer center.
I worry because I know I get a CT every 6 months but CT's don't show
everything. I am trying to keep my kewl. I will deal with this just
like I did the last round. At least I am not going from Stage 4 Lung
Cancer to We don't have a clue to wait to you have Non Hodgkin's
Lymphoma. That is one roller coaster ride I do not want to be on.

Ah yes, Frank. I remember the diagnostics problem and second opinion.
Thanks for clearing things up for me that it's a biopsy of a lesion on the
spine.
That sure ain't tendonitis if you need all those pain meds.
Actually pain meds don't work very well for tendonitis.
We'll be on pins and needles until we hear the biopsy results from you.
So please keep in touch, Frank.
Best wishes for the all clear and something less worrisome.

I also have a lot of pain in my shoulders but I am told that
mine is the result of Radio therapy treatment ? I first went down with my
lung cancer in November 1999. and I understand your fears, I am unwell for
about two days before I need to go to see my oncologist, even when I know
things are going fairly well ? We wouldn't be human if it did not affect us
