Seems that Ray Kroc's widow left 200 million of your McMuffin dollars
to the hate-America NPR (National Proletariat Radio). Poor old soul
must've been in the throes of senile dementia.

You still don't get it?

That's the SOP of EVERY SINGLE liberal alive...

Complain about lack of jobs, buy your stuff from overseas...

Claim you're an environmentalist and demonstrate it by slapping bumper
stickers on you SUV, minivan or pre-emmisions restricted rice burner
that trails white smoke when you drive ...

Say you care about the poor but spend 25 times the income of a laborer
in South America on your pets' vet bills and designer pet food instead
of donating to charities...

Campaign for gun control but hire armed body guards and live behind a
walled and gated community when you can afford it or get an illegal
gun like Carl Rowen did when you can't...

Claim you support public education and diversity while you send you
kids to all white snooty private schools...

Make your money of the backs of minimum wage non union employees with
no health insurance then take some of your profits to politicians who
promise you tax breaks and programs to strip your employees of their
meager earning to get a the health care you won't provide...

It's the very definition of what it means to be a liberal: do as I
say, not as I do.

&gt;&gt;&gt; And anyway, are you trying to say that a burger
flipping
&gt;&gt; job is NOT a
&gt;&gt;&gt; minimum wage job? Jeeze... then what WOULD be a
minimum
&gt;&gt; wage job?
&gt;&gt;&gt; What are kids and people with few skills supposed to
do
&gt;&gt; for work if
&gt;&gt;&gt; there are no entry-level jobs?

&gt;&gt; They deserve a living wage and benefits. That is what
should
&gt;&gt; equate to minimum wage. This is what should equate to an
&gt;&gt; entry-level job. This is what kids and people with few
&gt;&gt; skills should do for work. Make a living or enough to
fund
&gt;&gt; their college educations. The taxpayers should not be
&gt;&gt; funding employers or franchise owners who make 200
million
&gt;&gt; to subsidize their payrolls through FASA, foodstamps,
rent
&gt;&gt; subsidies, etc.

&gt; So what you are saying is that the government should not
be funding (?)
&gt; employers
&gt; or franchise owners. But you're saying that they should
fund unskilled
&gt; workers.

"/> If the objective to employment is to &quot;get off the dole&quot; and
become self-sufficent, I am saying the government should not
need to fund working people if employers paid a living wage
with benefits. I am also saying that your anger towards
those currently collecting certain governmental benefits is
misplaced. We are subsidizing people who work; but, in the
truest sense, we are subsidizing employers who are not
paying enough for their employees to survive and yet line
their own pockets off the backs of these workers as well as
the taxpayer dollar that help these workers survive. Just
imagine how much money could be saved if every employer were
required to pay a living wage with benefits and knock the
majority of the working individuals whose employers don't
pay them a living wage with benefits off the dole. It makes
no sense whatsoever to not only give these corporations tax
breaks to create more low dollar jobs and, thus, line their
pockets more deeply at the same time subsidizing the
payrolls and benefits for the low dollar jobs being created.

&quot;The percentage of working adult [TANF] recipients was 32.6
percent in Fiscal Year (FY) 2001, down slightly from 33
percent in FY 2000. Eighty-three percent of recipients who
were working were in paid employment...&quot;
http://www.acf.dhhs.gov/programs/ofa/annualreport5/chap04.pdf

&quot;...the percentage of food stamp families with children that
are receiving welfare and are not working dropped from 56
percent to 37 percent between 1993 and 1999. Moreover, the
proportion of households participating in the Food Stamp
Program that receives cash assistance declined from 42
percent in 1990 to 25.8 percent in 2000.&quot;

http://www.financeprojectinfo.org/Publications/foodstamp_programreaut...

Of those families with children living in public and
assisted housing that list wages as their primary source of
income includes 31% in public housing, 36% receiving
certificates, 37% receiving vouchers, and 36% receiving
project assisted Section 8.

http://www.nhlp.org/html/hlb/196/196data.htm

&quot;...about 50 percent of individuals transitioning from cash
assistance to employment had access to employer coverage,
only about one-third opted to participate in the
employer-sponsored plan.15 The relatively low &quot;take-up&quot; rate
is due largely to the high costs of many employer health
plans. Transitioning workers, who commonly earn between $7
and $8 an hour, may simply be unable to afford their share
of the premium, since their annual earnings range from 73
percent to 111 percent of the federal poverty level&quot;... In
1999, &quot;[s]tates offered from 1 to 3 years of transitional
Medicaid assistance in 1999. In the several states that were
able to provide data on participation in transitional
Medicaid assistance, we found that participation rates among
newly working Medicaid beneficiaries ranged from 4 to 94
percent.&quot;

We already to. That's the pathetice part of it. We pay
millions and millions of WIA (Worforce Investment Act)
dollars to find low-income workers for these same
corporations who, once they hire these workers, still don't
pay them enough to provide them with the basic requirements
to survive.

Not only that, but we also put out millions and millions of
non-repayable college grant money to fund college students
while they are in school because the employers that pay them
&quot;low skill&quot; wages while they are in college do not pay them
enough to bump them out of the free college ride. So, in a
sense, we, as taxpayers, are also paying to train these
students for the benefit of employers down the road.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to the hate-America NPR (National Proletariat
Radio).
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Poor old soul
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; must've been in the throes of senile dementia.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; BroJack

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I'm not sure whether I'm happy or upset. I am pleased
&gt;&gt;that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;she left 200 million to National Public Radio. But...
I
&gt;&gt;am
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;upset that she gained the 200 million off the backs of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;minimum wage workers--seems like she could have done
with
&gt;&gt;a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;150 million less or so.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Perhaps you were unaware of this, but 70% of McDonald's
&gt;&gt;restaurants
&gt;&gt;&gt; are franchises. That means they are not owned by
&gt;&gt;McDonald's corporate
&gt;&gt;&gt; - and McDonald's corporate does not set the wages of
the
&gt;&gt;workers.
&gt;&gt;&gt; They are independent restaurants owned by local people
who
&gt;&gt;contract
&gt;&gt;&gt; with McDonald's for things like advertising, use of the
&gt;&gt;trademarks,
&gt;&gt;&gt; etc. But wages are determined locally.

&gt;&gt;The whole principle behind franchising is a scam in my
&gt;&gt;humble opinion.

&gt;&gt;&gt; And anyway, are you trying to say that a burger
flipping
&gt;&gt;job is NOT a
&gt;&gt;&gt; minimum wage job? Jeeze... then what WOULD be a
minimum
&gt;&gt;wage job?
&gt;&gt;&gt; What are kids and people with few skills supposed to do
&gt;&gt;for work if
&gt;&gt;&gt; there are no entry-level jobs?

&gt;&gt;They deserve a living wage and benefits.

&gt; Why? Are there no jobs at all that are simply not worth
whatever it
&gt; is YOU consider &quot;living wage and benefits&quot;? What are
these teenagers
&gt; supposed to do to earn money?

&gt;&gt; That is what should
&gt;&gt;equate to minimum wage.

&gt; Why? There are plenty of jobs that are simply not worth
whatever
&gt; arbitrary number YOU decide should be the &quot;minimum wage&quot;.
And in any
&gt; case, pretty much all McDonald's I have ever seen already
pay more
&gt; than minimum wage for all their jobs anyway.

&gt;&gt; This is what should equate to an
&gt;&gt;entry-level job. This is what kids and people with few
&gt;&gt;skills should do for work. Make a living or enough to
fund
&gt;&gt;their college educations.

&gt; Says who? Why don't we pay them all $40/hr?

&gt;&gt; The taxpayers should not be
&gt;&gt;funding employers or franchise owners who make 200
million
&gt;&gt;to subsidize their payrolls through FASA, foodstamps,
rent

McDonalds, being a business, exists to make a profit. And
if it didn't make a profit, there'd be far fewer jobs
(minimum-wage or otherwise) to go around. This cannot be
disputed.

Certain types of work are only worth so much money per hour.
And flipping burgers is inarguably unskilled labor. Ergo,
the people who perform that sort of labor aren't entitled to
anything more than minimum wage. Why would they be?

Look at it this way. The overwhelming majority of McDonalds
employees are teenagers. The work is drudgery, granted --
but experiencing this sort of work can't help but motivate
these young employees to stay in school and qualify themselves
for somethig better. And how could anything that motivates
people to achieve be bad? The message is clear: If you want
to score a better job than this, then work to *earn* it. It
won't be awarded to you as some sort of birthright.

&quot;...minimum wage workers are generally low income adults who
do not have the educational credentials to move up career
ladders. These workers have a strong attachment to work and
the workforce and working as hard as they can just to remain
in a low income status. The data indicate that the minimum
wage is a poverty-generating wage, not a step toward a
livable standard of living.&quot;

http://www.bls.gov/cps/minwage2002.htm

&quot;About half of workers earning $5.15 or less were under age
25, and slightly more than one-fourth were age 16-19.&quot; Of
course, this also means that about half the workers were
over age 25 with more than 3/4 of the workers being over age
19.

&gt; Look at it this way. The overwhelming majority of McDonalds
&gt; employees are teenagers. The work is drudgery, granted --
&gt; but experiencing this sort of work can't help but motivate
&gt; these young employees to stay in school and qualify themselves

"/> Haven't we been through this before?
&quot;Supporters intend a &quot;living wage&quot; to be higher than a
minimum wage. To do this, they define a living wage as an
hourly rate of pay to enable one full-time wage earner to
earn enough income to maintain a family of four above the
federal poverty level. Federal poverty level guidelines are
revised yearly by the Department of Health and Human
Services. Calculations of the living wage invariably result
in substantially higher rates of pay than either the federal
or state minimum wages.&quot;

&quot;A &quot;living wage,&quot; in jurisdictions that mandate them, is
pegged to federal poverty guidelines. Generally, it must be
enough to enable a family of four to remain above the
federal poverty level. The poverty level in Hawaii in 1998
was $18,920. Thus, in 1998, a hypothetical Hawaii living
wage would have been $9.10. In 1999, it would have been
$9.24. This is based on 40 hours of work per week for 52
weeks.&quot;

http://www.state.hi.us/lrb/rpts00/wagefs.html

amount:

Suggestions for setting the $ amount:

http://www.livingwagecampaign.org/wagelevel.php

Some of the benefits of setting a living wage:

&quot;Extensive economic research and studies of existing living
wage ordinances from around the country indicate that a
living wage law in Sacramento could provide: 1) significant
economic and social benefits for working poor families, 2)
significant cost savings, improved services and a stronger
local economy for the public, and 3) increased productivity,
cost savings, and consumer buying power for employers.
Furthermore, research and experience indicates that these
benefits can be achieved without causing significant job
loss or displacement, deleterious burdens on the city
budget, or damage to the business climate.&quot;

http://acorn.org/acorn10/livingwage/reports2003/Brunick.htm

Even for those using an analysis of the initial purpose of
minimum wage:

&quot;If the current federal minimum wage were adjusted for
inflation, it currently would be $8.50, a member of the
Living Wage Coalition projected.&quot;

workers are teenagers, haven't we? Maybe it was someone

This is incorrect. Teenagers cannot work the day shift and
they also cannot work past 10 p.m. while in school.
http://www.econop.org/mwnote.htm

What can be said about the minimum wage worker:
a.. 71% of affected workers are 20 years or older

b.. The average age of an affected worker is 30.4 years

c.. Over 65% of affected workers have no more than 12
years of schooling

d.. Fewer than 30% of affected workers live with their
parents

e.. Almost 40 percent (39.4%) of minimum wage workers are
the sole source of income for their households.

f.. The median family income for a minimum wage worker is
$27,203.

g.. 54.4% of minimum wage workers live in households with
incomes less than $30,000

h.. The average hours worked per week for a minimum wage
worker is 28.7

i.. 45.9 percent of minimum wage workers are fulltime
employees

j.. Average number of weeks worked per year is 45.9% (out
of a possible 52!)

&quot;About half of workers earning $5.15 or less were under age
25, and slightly more than one-fourth were age 16-19.&quot; Of
course, this also means that about half the workers were
over age 25 with more than 3/4 of the workers being over age
19.

http://www.foodbankrockies.org/hunger.cfm#US

However, if it is your goal to allow teenagers the
opportunity to better their &quot;skills sets&quot; as you suggest and
raise themselves out of a life time of poverty AND not pay
their way through college through the use of your tax
dollars, then ... the wage proposed would do exactly that...
take them out of the free college ride and provide them with
the money to pay for the education required to rise up out
of poverty and remain forever off the taxpayer dole.

"/> Well, now, this is certainly a new approach. heh heh....
apparently, you haven't read my other tirade. You are
welcome to have it:

Why is the State of Ohio discriminating against disabled
employees? Is it because they believe Supreme Court rulings
such as Garrett vs. Alabama make it acceptable for them to
discriminate?

Personal example:

I was formerly a person is on Social Security Disability and
receiving maybe $7,000 per year in cash benefits and another
$5,000 per year in Medicare benefits. I also received Food
Stamps and Medicaid at the tune of another $5,000 a year or
so. On top of that, I received BVR assistance to go back to
school, utility discounts, property tax discounts, HEAP,
commodities, etc. etc. to the tune of probably another
$5,000 per year or so.

Social Security provides incentives to get go back to work.
I wanted to go back to work. I went to college and obtained
an education that will allow me to work in a profession
capable of accommodating her disability.

I then get a job with the State of Ohio, Department of
Natural Resources. I work hard. I am an exemplary employee.
I get two promotions in less than 5 years. My income jumps
from $7,000 (on Social Security) to $50,000 with full
medical coverage.

Do you know what this means?

The government and, thus, its citizens come out ahead by a
minimum of $28,000 per year ($7,000 not being taken out of
Social Security in benefits + $5,000 not being taken out of
Medicare in benefits + $5,000 not being taken out for Food
Stamps and Medicaid + $5,000 not being taken out via
discounts and low-income programs + $6,000 upward going into
federal, state and local income tax.)

All of this sounds pretty darned good, doesn't it?

Well, forget it.

My health took a turn for the worse (although perhaps not a
permanent turn) and I asked for an accommodation that would
cost the State of Ohio nothing. (Yes, you heard it-not one
thin dime.) My employer responded by initiating policies
that disallowed the accommodation, stripped me of
supervisory duties, forced me to take a less satisfactory
and more costly set of accommodations that prevented me from
fully doing my job, and then set about on a campaign of
verbal and civil harassment against me which later led to
the point of falsely accused me of a variety of wrongdoings
after I filed both an informal and formal EEO complaint
within the state's own system.

All of this just because I wanted to get off Social Security
and earn a living with a disability. Thanks. Thanks a lot.

with
&gt;&gt; a maximum of two years monetary assistance. It isn't
exactly
&gt;&gt; the &quot;free ride&quot; some make it out to be.

&gt; %%%% It still is in many States.

"/> As of 2000,
&quot;Some 39 states require that single adult recipients
receiving TANF participate in work activities for a set
number of hours per week. Ten states determine hours of
participation on an individual basis and two states allow
localities to set the required hours of participation. In FY
2000, the majority of states with a fixed hourly
participation requirement set the number of hours at the
federal participation rate level of 30 hours per week (27 of
the 39 states), with three of these states (MO, ND, SD)
allowing adult recipients with children under age six to
work 20 hours per week. Some six states (AL, AZ, CA, HI, TN,
VT) set the hourly requirement higher, ranging from 32 to 40
hours per week, with Tennessee allowing adult recipients
with low basic skills to work 20 hours per week and Vermont
allowing adult recipients with children under age 13 to work
20 hours per week. Some five states (CT, ID, LA, NM, RI) set
the hourly requirement lower, ranging from 20 to 29 hours
per week.&quot;

&quot;Most states (44) exempt from work requirements adult
recipients who are caring for a young child, with about half
(23) exempting adult recipients with children up to age one.
Some 16 states set the age for this exemption at less than
one year and five set it higher than one year. A majority of
states (34) exempt disabled or temporarily incapacitated
adult recipients from work requirements and 28 states exempt
those who care for a disabled household member. About half
of the states (27) exempt adult recipients of advanced age
(typically set at 60 years). About half of the states (24)
exempt adult recipients who are domestic violence victims.
Some 19 states exempt those who lack child care, with 13 of
these states setting the age for this exemption at six or
younger. Pregnant recipients are exempt in 20 states. In
addition to these common exemption categories, a range of
other ones are used in 23 states. These other categories
include lack of transportation (10 states), adult recipients
who are not parents (six states), and living in a remote
area (five states).&quot;

http://www.spdp.org/tanf/work/worksumm.htm

If your state is not participating in the work requirement,
you should write to your state legislators, as it is my
understanding that they would need to return a portion of
their federal dollars if they are not complying with this
mandate.

&gt;&gt;&gt; McDonalds, being a business, exists to make a profit.

&gt;&gt; Ahhh... but I contend that McDonalds could continue to
make
&gt;&gt; a profit while paying a living wage with benefits to its
&gt;&gt; workers.

&gt; %%%% Define living wage. Please explain to me why someone
in heir right mind
&gt; would be trying to support a family doing a teenager's
entrance level job?
&gt; Would you like fries with that sir?

"/> I've already defined living wage and de-bunked the myth that
the majority of minimum wage workers are teenagers.

http://www.econop.org/mwnote.htm

What can be said about the minimum wage worker:
a.. 71% of affected workers are 20 years or older

b.. The average age of an affected worker is 30.4 years

c.. Over 65% of affected workers have no more than 12
years of schooling

d.. Fewer than 30% of affected workers live with their
parents

e.. Almost 40 percent (39.4%) of minimum wage workers are
the sole source of income for their households.

f.. The median family income for a minimum wage worker is
$27,203.

g.. 54.4% of minimum wage workers live in households with
incomes less than $30,000

h.. The average hours worked per week for a minimum wage
worker is 28.7

i.. 45.9 percent of minimum wage workers are fulltime
employees

j.. Average number of weeks worked per year is 45.9% (out
of a possible 52!)

But... even if these workers are teenagers, who's to say
they many aren't assisting in the support of their
low-income family or living on their own.

&gt;&gt; McDonalds, being a business, exists to make a profit.
And
&gt;&gt; if it didn't make a profit, there'd be far fewer jobs
&gt;&gt; (minimum-wage or otherwise) to go around. This cannot
be

&gt;&gt; Certain types of work are only worth so much money per
hour.
&gt;&gt; And flipping burgers is inarguably unskilled labor.
Ergo,
&gt;&gt; the people who perform that sort of labor aren't
entitled to
&gt;&gt; anything more than minimum wage. Why would they be?

&gt;&gt; Look at it this way. The overwhelming majority of
McDonalds
&gt;&gt; employees are teenagers. The work is drudgery,
granted --
&gt;&gt; but experiencing this sort of work can't help but
motivate
&gt;&gt; these young employees to stay in school and qualify
themselves
&gt;&gt; for somethig better. And how could anything that
motivates
&gt;&gt; people to achieve be bad? The message is clear: If you
want
&gt;&gt; to score a better job than this, then work to *earn* it.
It

One reason you love NPR is that they won't report this:

Black/White Street Crime Ratios:

Murder/neg. msltr.: 5.39/1
Forcible Rape: 2.89/1
Robbery: 6.55/1
Aggravated assault: 2.88/1
Burglary: 2.45/1

The white crime data include Hispanic crime. If Hispanic crime were
removed from white data, the black/white ratio would be even more
extreme.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Certain types of work are only worth so much money per

&gt; Ergo,
&gt;&gt;&gt; the people who perform that sort of labor aren't

&gt;&gt;&gt; Look at it this way. The overwhelming majority of

&gt;&gt;&gt; but experiencing this sort of work can't help but

&gt;&gt;&gt; I would suggest that they whack some from their profits
&gt;&gt;&gt; and/or CEO wages. CEO wages have gotten out of hand in
&gt; this
&gt;&gt;&gt; country. And, we can scarcely say there's a shortage of
&gt; CEOs
&gt;&gt;&gt; because colleges are cranking out people with MBAs
&gt; daily.

&gt;&gt;&gt; But... if they opt to raise the price of their product
&gt; to
&gt;&gt;&gt; offset the wage, then people will 1) continue to buy the
&gt;&gt;&gt; product if they truly want or need the product or 2) not
&gt; buy
&gt;&gt;&gt; the product. If consumers don't buy the product, the
&gt; company
&gt;&gt;&gt; will need to consider cutting costs elsewhere (hopefully
&gt;&gt;&gt; profits and/or CEO wages) to bring the price of the
&gt; product
&gt;&gt;&gt; back into line. If not, they will go out of business
&gt; and,
&gt;&gt;&gt; then, if there is a profit to be made and a demand for
&gt; the
&gt;&gt;&gt; product, someone else will step into their shoes and
&gt; make it
&gt;&gt;&gt; work.

&gt;&gt; Are you comparing the wages and profits of a CEO of a
&gt; major corp. to the
&gt;&gt; owner
&gt;&gt; of a hamburger franchise? And why should anyone give up
&gt; some of their profit
&gt;&gt; or wages
&gt;&gt; to raise the wages of others?

&gt; Because those &quot;others&quot; were the ones that helped make their
&gt; company and their profits. And... because taxpayers
&gt; shouldn't be paying the way for their business by
&gt; supplementing their payroll simply because they won't pay a
&gt; wage great enough to cover the basic costs of living.

&gt;&gt; They've worked hard and invested their money to get where
&gt; they are.

&gt; Some have. Some haven't. Same as workers.

&gt;&gt; That's the problem. No one deserves a handout.

&gt; Agreed, but this should also include employers. If you can't
&gt; run a business and pay enough to keep your workers off the
&gt; taxpayer dole, then you shouldn't be running a business. It
&gt; isn't our job as taxpayers to supplement your payroll costs.

"/> %%%% Excuse me but wouldn't the stoppage of this suppliment either cause the

&gt; They are and there are STILL people not getting enough to

&gt;&gt; You're unhappy with your job or circumstance, do something

&gt; Agreed. If you aren't happy being a business owner and
&gt; paying people at least a living wage, do something about it.

&gt;&gt; Stop looking for someone else to help you.

&gt; Agreed. Start supporting your business and paying your
&gt; workers a living wage and quit looking for the taxpayers to
&gt; not only give you a tax break, but supplement your payroll
&gt; as well!

&gt; I find it interesting that people are so willing the workers
&gt; for being bums riding on the taxpayer dole, but ignore the
&gt; fact that low-wage employers are, in essence, doing the same
&gt; thing.

"/> I'm not sure what you mean. I just seemed to me at the time
that there was a whole different group of people that roamed
the streets at night. But... when you got to know them, for
the most part, they were just like the day-time folks except
the lived and worked at night. Oh, they also seemed to
collect more at private homes than other establishments. I
suppose because few things were open other than the 24-hour
restaurants and gas stations.

If you're wanting to know about what people generally call
the more seedy night-folks, I wouldn't say I came in contact
with them as much during my 3rd shift working days. I would
say that I came in contact with those folks during my days
of living in what most call &quot;da hood.&quot; The folks that sold
crack and personal wares on the corners. I was kind of
strange, though. You generally think of these folks as wired
up gangsters or something. But, in truth, most of them were
just out there making a living or feeding a habit. It seemed
to me that most of the gangster types were kids playing some
type of deadly game with each other--gang warfare. I used to
let some of them come over to my house, but the agreement
was that the colors stayed outside and no trouble came
inside. For the most part, they respected my wishes on the
subject, although I did have to toss a couple out on their
fannies. As I got to know many of these kids, I realized
that most of them were just looking for some attention or
some type of respect that they felt they could gain by
placing fear into people. I've written a lot on stuff like
this, but, really, I'm not up to posting something quite
that long at the moment. :-)

"/> In my humble opinion, not paying living wage shouldn't even
be an option anymore than not paying minimum wage at the
moment. Stopping the supplement would only harm the worker
who is trying his or her utmost to earn a living.

As for potential job loss:

http://acorn.org/acorn10/livingwage/reports2003/Brunick.htm

&quot;... the vast weight of the evidence surrounding the impact
of living wage laws to this point suggests that living wage
ordinances do not cause job loss. The above-mentioned study
about the effect of the San Francisco living wage ordinance
at San Francisco International Airport reveals that:
· Low-wage workers have received significant wage gains
and
· No evidence of job loss or worker displacement
exists.[70]
Furthermore, an investigation into the effect of the
living wage ordinances in San Francisco, Oakland, San Jose,
Berkeley, and Hayward, CA by two newspaper reporters at the
San Francisco Chronicle revealed that the living wage
ordinances in those cities had provided wage increases to
low-wage workers without any significant jobs losses.[71]
Studies of living wage ordinances in Baltimore, Detroit,
Chicago, and a forthcoming study from the Brennan Center for
Justice examining the effects of living wage ordinances in
eight major U.S. cities all support the conclusion that
living wage laws have not caused significant job loss.[72]
The O'Keefe and Perez report fails to mention or discuss the
San Francisco study or any of these other studies.
Furthermore, the vast weight of recent and historical
research on minimum wage increases support the more recent
research on living wage ordinances. The O'Keefe and Perez
report cites to a recent study of minimum wage increases and
uses it to claim, &quot;some families escape poverty, but.others
fall into poverty when they lose their jobs.&quot;[73] The O'
Keefe and Perez report fails to mention or deal with the
numerous studies that show results to the contrary. Studies
of the recent federal minimum wage increases (and their
effect in a variety of places in the country including
Texas, Mississippi, and North Carolina) and state minimum
wage increases in a variety of states in the 1990s
(including here in California, in New Jersey and in Oregon)
show:
· significant wage gains for low-wage workers,
· little or no evidence of job loss and displacement and
· in some places, evidence of additional job creation.
[74]
Here in California, the state minimum wage increases in
the 1990s brought real wage gains to low-wage workers (the
majority of whom were adults and full-time workers) without
any evidence of negative employment effects.[75] The state
minimum wage increases in Oregon in January 1997 and 1998
did not produce unemployment. More importantly, they played
a key role in helping welfare mothers escape poverty.[76]
Furthermore, historically, there is an inverse correlation
between the level of the federal minimum wage and the
national unemployment rate. The higher the federal minimum
wage in real terms, the lower the national unemployment rate
and vice versa, which shows that, if anything, there is very
little relationship between the level of the minimum wage
and overall unemployment.[77]
The balance of economic research on the minimum
wage suggests that moderate minimum wage increases will have
negligible or small impacts on employment and may have
positive impacts on employment. As Nobel Laureate Robert
Solow stated on this topic, &quot;The main thing about this
research is that the evidence of job loss is weak. And the
fact that the evidence is weak suggests that the impact on
jobs is small.&quot;[78]&quot;

AND...
http://www.responsiblewealth.org/living_wage/qanda.html
&quot;Only a few studies to date have examined the unemployment
effect of living wage laws. The Economic Policy Institute
concluded in 1998 that after four years in force, the
Baltimore living wage increase did not result in any
discernible job loss. A study of the Los Angeles living wage
law, the nation's most far-reaching living wage law, found
that total employment on City service contracts declined by
about 3% over the first eighteen months of implementation
(Sander and Lokey). The authors of this study note that in
Los Angeles, unlike Baltimore, the city did not put
contracts up for competitive bids, choosing instead to
re-negotiate contracts with existing vendors. The study
concluded that implementing a competitive bidding process
would help &quot;hold down both costs to the city and the loss of
worker jobs.&quot;
There is a much broader body of evidence examining the
relationship between increases to the minimum wage and
unemployment. The vast majority of economic research
concludes that there is little or no loss of jobs associated
with small wage increases, where small is defined as
increases that adjust the minimum wage for the effects of
inflation...&quot;

As for the effects on businesses:
http://acorn.org/acorn10/livingwage/reports2003/Brunick.htm

&quot;Evidence from the around the country suggests that living
wage ordinances have not damaged the business climate.[84]
In fact, as noted earlier, many businesses have recognized
the benefits of such measures.[85] Passing a living wage
ordinance can improve the business climate for many of the
reasons cited above: it can decrease poverty and inequality;
it can add buying power and consumer demand to the local
economy, it can improve the quality of public services; and
it can encourage and/or force employers to follow a &quot;high
road&quot; path to profitability -- one that emphasizes
competition on the basis of high quality and high wages
instead of profitability through cutting costs.

Here in California, a living wage ordinance has already
served to proactively improve the business climate in one
city. By markedly improving airport security and other
airport services, in part through the passage of a living
wage ordinance, San Francisco has improved its image as a
city that can effectively meet the needs of people and
business.&quot;

If, as you suggest, the laws of supply and demand are in
force, a profit will be made if the demand is available for
the product. If not, then perhaps we really don't need the
product that much. If the business owner doesn't feel there
is enough profit in it for him/her and opts to close shop
while the demand for the product exists, you can bet someone
else will come along and gladly suck up the profit they
shirk.

I am
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; upset that she gained the 200 million off the backs
of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; minimum wage workers--seems like she could have done
with a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 150 million less or so.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Typically muddled, liberal, knee-jerk anticapitalist
thinking.

&gt;&gt;&gt; McDonalds, being a business, exists to make a profit.
And
&gt;&gt;&gt; if it didn't make a profit, there'd be far fewer jobs
&gt;&gt;&gt; (minimum-wage or otherwise) to go around. This cannot
be
&gt;&gt;&gt; disputed.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Certain types of work are only worth so much money per
hour.
&gt;&gt;&gt; And flipping burgers is inarguably unskilled labor.
Ergo,
&gt;&gt;&gt; the people who perform that sort of labor aren't
entitled to
&gt;&gt;&gt; anything more than minimum wage. Why would they be?

&gt;&gt;&gt; Look at it this way. The overwhelming majority of
McDonalds
&gt;&gt;&gt; employees are teenagers. The work is drudgery,
granted --
&gt;&gt;&gt; but experiencing this sort of work can't help but
motivate
&gt;&gt;&gt; these young employees to stay in school and qualify
themselves
&gt;&gt;&gt; for somethig better. And how could anything that
motivates
&gt;&gt;&gt; people to achieve be bad? The message is clear: If you
want
&gt;&gt;&gt; to score a better job than this, then work to *earn*
it. It
&gt;&gt;&gt; won't be awarded to you as some sort of birthright.

&gt;&gt;%%%% AMEN!! Now get ready to be flamesd by the bleeding
hearts.

&gt; Only for his ignorance. About 40% of McDonalds employees
are under
&gt; 21.

"/> 3/4 of the minimum wage workforce is 20 or older. Nearly 1/2
are 25 years or older with the average age being 30.4 years.

&gt; an
&gt;&gt;&gt; employer's payroll.

&gt;&gt; %%%% So am I as much as I am against subsidizing those
&gt; that are able to work
&gt;&gt; and don't.

&gt; With TANF being two years and off now, there is little
&gt; chance that we will subsidize those who are able to work and
&gt; don't. Plus... did you know that nearly every state has a
&gt; work requirement for receiving TANF dollars? In Ohio, you
&gt; must work 30 hours per week to an assigned job ~or~ be
&gt; registered in school full-time to receive TANF dollars with
&gt; a maximum of two years monetary assistance. It isn't exactly
&gt; the &quot;free ride&quot; some make it out to be.

"/> Very true, remember in Detroit a few years ago where a six year old boy
brought a gun to school and shot one of his classmates? Where was his
mother while this was happening? Why wasn't she there that morning to send
her son off to school and perhaps prevent this tragedy? She was being
bussed along with a busload of other poor workers to a town over an hour
away where she worked two jobs in a mall food court. She left every day
before dawn and got home every evening well after dark. This was a
condition of her receiving state assistance. She was being bussed away to
work two full time minimum wage jobs and still was not earning enough money
to support her and her son, and apparently had no time to raise her son
properly and safely.

Well, one would think that if the businesses paid a &quot;living

I am not against giving supplements to individuals, but,

&gt; upset that she gained the 200 million off the backs of

"/> I was one of those workers and I am thrilled about Mrs. Kroc's
generosity. In my opinion, Mrs. Kroc has never forced anyone to work at
any of her McDonalds' stores.

When I worked at a McDonalds when I was in college, the management
encouraged students like me to study hard at school. Hell, that was the
only job where I got fired and it was over a stupid misunderstanding,
but I still bode them no ill will.

Like many McDonalds' minimum wage employees, I worked hard in college. I
got a good job after school that paid fairly well. The money I earned at
McDonalds helped pay for my text books. By doing the scut work at
McDonalds, I had an opportunity to see what life would be like if I did
not get a good education and take charge of my destiny. There were some
minimum wage workers there who were in their 40s and 50s and I sure did
not want to go down that path in my life. McDonalds taught me an
important lesson at an early enough stage of my life where it made a
major difference for the better. One of my aunts happened to be a
long-time McDonalds employee. That's how I got my job there and I saw
her slaving away for 40 hours a week for minimum wage and it is her and
af few others like her who worked at McDonalds while I was there who
taught me the value of an education. I will always be greatful for that
lesson. My parents tried to teach me about the importance of education
too, but seeing the results of not getting an education first hand was
what really motivated me to eventually earn two college degrees.

It is not Mrs. Kroc's fault that some of her employees do not take
responsibility for their future career growth.

When I worked at McDonalds, my parents paid my living expenses,

I earned at McDonalds wasn't much, but it was enough for me to meet my
needs and have some fun and it was modest enough to spur me to continue
my education to obtain a better paying job.

Why should a McDonalds restaurant owner pay an adult with a home and
family three or four times as much money than a teenager to flip burgers
just because that person failed to get training to do more skilled work
and better paying work? Why should a business owner pay someone more
money for the same work flipping burgers, mopping floors, etc.? I am all
for making the minimum wage higher because the value of the dollar has
declined, but paying more than mimimum wage to do an unskilled entry
level job is not sound business and it is not sound government.

I can attest from personal experience that flipping burgers and mopping
floors is not skilled work. Those of us who knew when we were young that
we would need a better income later in life took responsibility for
ourselves, went to school full time and we worked part time and we left
McDonalds and other minimum wage paying jobs to work at a job that pays
more, but requires more skills and greater responsibility.

&gt; How so? The McDonalds where I worked was one of twelve
that was owned by
&gt; one franchiser. This guy lives in a mansion and has a
collection of
&gt; twelve classic automobiles, so its obvious he has done
well as a
&gt; McDonalds franchisee.

"/> Well, I think that may help to make my point. The intitial
(and I do mean initial) premises behind franchising was the
&quot;break&quot; minimum wage. Minimum wage was set so that only
those making above X dollars in profit had to pay it. If
corporations didn't run the stores, they didn't have to pay
the workers minimum wage because the store was then
considered a mom and pop business and didn't make X dollars
and, thus, didn't have fall into the minimum wage
requirement as well as other federal wage requirements. Now,
some of the franchisers have now advanced to the point that
they make X dollars and must follow federal labor laws.
BUT... still many more franchisers have not. I worked for
one of those franchisers in my younger days (only for a very
short time, I might add) and know many more people who work
for these types nowadays. I understand that the small
franchiser is not living in a mansion with twelve classic
automobiles while his/her employees don't even make enough
to pay for shelter, food, healthcare, etc. BUT... the point
is that the corporation is still banging home the bucks in
the meantime.

&gt;&gt; They deserve a living wage and benefits. That is what
should
&gt;&gt; equate to minimum wage. This is what should equate to an
&gt;&gt; entry-level job. This is what kids and people with few
&gt;&gt; skills should do for work. Make a living or enough to
fund
&gt;&gt; their college educations. The taxpayers should not be
&gt;&gt; funding employers or franchise owners who make 200
million
&gt;&gt; to subsidize their payrolls through FASA, foodstamps,
rent
&gt;&gt; subsidies, etc.

&gt; Everyone deserves a living wage if they have to suport
themselves. Most
&gt; kids who work at fast food and other low skilled jobs do
not have to
&gt; support themselves.

"/> You need to read more in this thread before you say that 3/4
of the minimum wage workers in the US are over 18. Over half
are over the age of 25 and the average minimum wage worker
is 30.4 years of age. I could agree that teenagers still in
school *might* need to make less than those supporting
themselves except for two things: 1) if we did that,
employers would have a massive surge in school age teenagers
to the detriment of those who *need* the jobs and 2) the
premises behind teenage work is so that they can earn money
to go to college or support a family in need. If we want
these teenagers to have enough money to go to college
without using taxpayer money to do it, we need to pay them
enough to accomplish the deed. If we want teenagers to step
up to the plate during periods of family crises, we need to
pay them enough to accomplish the task. So... why we would
even REMOTELY agree that a person living in a mansion with
12 classic automobiles cannot afford to pay his or her
workers a living wage and benefits is beyond me. Did you
know that it would only raise the price of BigMacs $.02 to
pay these workers a living wage?

&gt;&gt; I'm not sure whether I'm happy or upset. I am pleased
that
&gt;&gt; she left 200 million to National Public Radio. But... I
am
&gt;&gt; upset that she gained the 200 million off the backs of
&gt;&gt; minimum wage workers--seems like she could have done
with a
&gt;&gt; 150 million less or so.

&gt; I was one of those workers and I am thrilled about Mrs.
Kroc's
&gt; generosity. In my opinion, Mrs. Kroc has never forced
anyone to work at
&gt; any of her McDonalds' stores.

&gt; When I worked at a McDonalds when I was in college, the
management
&gt; encouraged students like me to study hard at school. Hell,
that was the
&gt; only job where I got fired and it was over a stupid
misunderstanding,
&gt; but I still bode them no ill will.

&gt; Like many McDonalds' minimum wage employees, I worked hard
in college. I
&gt; got a good job after school that paid fairly well. The
money I earned at
&gt; McDonalds helped pay for my text books. By doing the scut
work at
&gt; McDonalds, I had an opportunity to see what life would be
like if I did
&gt; not get a good education and take charge of my destiny.
There were some
&gt; minimum wage workers there who were in their 40s and 50s
and I sure did
&gt; not want to go down that path in my life. McDonalds taught
me an
&gt; important lesson at an early enough stage of my life where
it made a
&gt; major difference for the better. One of my aunts happened
to be a
&gt; long-time McDonalds employee. That's how I got my job
there and I saw
&gt; her slaving away for 40 hours a week for minimum wage and
it is her and
&gt; af few others like her who worked at McDonalds while I was
there who
&gt; taught me the value of an education. I will always be
greatful for that
&gt; lesson. My parents tried to teach me about the importance
of education
&gt; too, but seeing the results of not getting an education
first hand was
&gt; what really motivated me to eventually earn two college
degrees.

&gt; It is not Mrs. Kroc's fault that some of her employees do
not take
&gt; responsibility for their future career growth.

&gt; Quite a few companies have off shored their work because of high costs
&gt; for labor in the United States. A big component of the cost of labor for
&gt; many companies is paying for their health insurance.

"/> 'Government funded' does not equal 'free'. Pay for it up front, or pay for
it in taxes. TANSTAAFL, etc. Some people say that if we had national health
care, it would be cheaper due to economies of scale, but having seen how
government works up close and personal at my day job for the last 23 years,
I am more inclined to think it would be like IRS or DoD, where they only
waste one dollar out of three on a good day. Call a spade a spade, it's an

"/> McDonald's does pay more than minimum wage and they also offer a health
plan. Starting salaries in many metropolitan areas is better than
$8.50/hour. Why do you think that minimum wage is a salary? You seem to
believe that there is this vast need to raise minimum wage, but the facts
show otherwise. Minimum wage is a STARTING point, not an ending point. 95%
of the people that make minimum wage have moved beyond that within a year.
Fewer than 10% of all jobs in America even have a STARTING wage that is
considered minimum. Fewer than 4% of adults work jobs that pay minimum wage.
The minimum wage act was originally called the Womens and Childrens Wage Act
and it was designed to protect woment and children.
Each and every time the minimum wage has been raised it has hurt the very
people that are supposedly going to benefit, the poor and teens. Each and
every time minumum wage is raised, those positions that pay minimum wage are
elininated or growth slows. It does tend to raise some other workers wages
(those that were close to the bottom) but not nearly enough to offset the
reduction in jobs and job growth.

"/> So? If someone is still making minimum wage over the same time that CEO
salaries went up that much then that minimum wage worker probably isn't even
worth minimum wage. You are also projecting, the average CEO salary is
about $200K, you want to only examine the superstars but let's look at it.
CEO salaries are a fixed point with a given population - the vast majority
of people making minimum wage are not fixed so you've got to expad your
comparison a little, what if you compared the income growth of the average
minimum wage employee of 20 years ago the to the average CEO wage growth?
The average wage today is around $30K, so my guess is that over a 20 year
span the average minimum wage worker's pay has gone up around 500%. The
median worker's pay has gone up almost 1000%. My salary has gone up 2700%
since I was making minimum wage about 20 years ago and there are many people
that have done better than me. What was the CEO wage growth?

&gt; You need to read more in this thread before you say that 3/4

&gt; is 30.4 years of age. I could agree that teenagers still in
&gt; school *might* need to make less than those supporting
&gt; themselves except for two things: 1) if we did that,
&gt; employers would have a massive surge in school age teenagers
&gt; to the detriment of those who *need* the jobs and 2) the
&gt; premises behind teenage work is so that they can earn money
&gt; to go to college or support a family in need. If we want
&gt; these teenagers to have enough money to go to college
&gt; without using taxpayer money to do it, we need to pay them
&gt; enough to accomplish the deed. If we want teenagers to step
&gt; up to the plate during periods of family crises, we need to
&gt; pay them enough to accomplish the task. So... why we would
&gt; even REMOTELY agree that a person living in a mansion with
&gt; 12 classic automobiles cannot afford to pay his or her
&gt; workers a living wage and benefits is beyond me. Did you
&gt; know that it would only raise the price of BigMacs $.02 to
&gt; pay these workers a living wage?

"/> Please post your source. All of the data that I have ever found at the DOL
shows that 90% of all minimum wage jobs are held by teenagers and young
adults (under 25) and that 95% of the people making minimum wage are not
heads of households. That seems to contradict your 30 year average age.
Who cares if the owner of a McDonald's franchise lives in a mansion or in a
trailer? I am willing to bet that the individual does indeed pay his/her
employees a living wage based on their ages, needs, and education and
experience. People make what they make based on their education, experience,
and the needs of the organization. Minimum wage workers make minimum wage
becasue they are an easily replaceable commodity. It requires little to no
training and workers can be found readily in any location whether they are
teenagers or adults. Teenagers compete with adults for those jobs and their
needs are less so the job will naturally pay less thus the &quot;living wage&quot; for
those jobs will be less. If there ws greater demand for those positions and
skills the &quot;living wage&quot; would go up. If you are an unskilled worker there
are a number of possible ways for you to gain experience and education to
move beyond minimum wage work.

&gt; So? If someone is still making minimum wage over the same
time that CEO
&gt; salaries went up that much then that minimum wage worker
probably isn't even
&gt; worth minimum wage. You are also projecting, the average
CEO salary is
&gt; about $200K, you want to only examine the superstars but
let's look at it.
&gt; CEO salaries are a fixed point with a given population -
the vast majority

to expad your
&gt; comparison a little, what if you compared the income

"/> growth of the average

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; minimum wage employee of 20 years ago the to the average
CEO wage growth?
&gt; The average wage today is around $30K, so my guess is that
over a 20 year
&gt; span the average minimum wage worker's pay has gone up
around 500%. The
&gt; median worker's pay has gone up almost 1000%. My salary
has gone up 2700%
&gt; since I was making minimum wage about 20 years ago and

"/> there are many people

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; that have done better than me. What was the CEO wage
growth?

"/> 500% my arse!!!

I can tell you EXACTLY what minimum wage was in 1973 because
I worked for it. It was $1.80 per hours. Today it is $5.15
per hour. That is quite a bit less of an increase that 500
percent, bub. In fact, it's less than 300 percent.

&quot;In 1974 the minimum wage stood at $2.00 and equaled 45
percent of average wages in the economy. By 1993 the minimum
wage had increased to $4.25 but had fallen to 35 percent of
average wages.&quot;
http://www.epionline.org/study_detail.cfm?sid=59

In 1973, the average wage in the US was $8,951 and minimum
wage equated to $3,744 ($1.80 X 40 hours X 52 weeks) or 42%
of the average.

In 2001, the average wage in the US was $37,258 and minimum
wage equated to $10,712 ($5.15 X 40 X 52) or 29% of the
average.

http://cber.bus.utk.edu/bea/uavgwg01.pdf

I can also tell you EXACTLY how much CEO wages have gone up
as well! Superstars my butt...30K my butt...we're talking
CEO AVERAGES here--the same as we're talking AVERAGE wage:

In 1960, it took 41 average paid workers to equal one
average paid CEO. In 1999, it took 475 average paid workers
to equal one average paid CEO.

http://www.stw.org/research/CEO_Pay_charts.html

&quot;Average CEO pay went up 35 percent in 1997 to $7.8 million,
according to Business Week's recent executive pay survey.
Even without all the extras like subsidized luxury housing,
gourmet meals, country clubs, top-notch health care, and
investment advice, average CEO pay comes to $150,000 a week.
Average worker pay went up 3 percent last year-all the way
to $424 a week. Workers still earn less in wages, adjusting
for inflation, than they did in the 1970s.
The average CEO made 326 times the pay of factory workers
last year-up from 209 times factory workers' pay in 1996.
Back in 1980, when many more workers were unionized, the
CEO-worker wage gap was much smaller: CEOs made 42 times as
much as factory workers.&quot;
http://www.thirdworldtraveler.com/Society/CEO_Greed.html

&quot;In recent decades, the minimum wage floor has fallen,
dragging down average real wages as well. The real value of
the minimum wage peaked in 1968 at $7.92 per hour (in 2000
dollars). Since then, worker productivity went up, but wages
went down. Productivity grew 74.2 percent between 1968 and
2000, but hourly wages for average workers fell 3 percent,
adjusting for inflation. Real wages for minimum wage
workers--two-thirds of whom are adults--fell 35 percent.

If wages had kept pace with rising productivity since 1968,
the average hourly wage would have been $24.56 in 2000,
rather than $13.74. The minimum wage would be $13.80--not
$5.15.

Profits also went up, but wages went down. Domestic
corporate profits rose 64 percent since 1968, adjusting for
inflation. The retail trade industry employs more than half
the nation's hourly employees paid at or below minimum wage.
Retail profits jumped even higher than profits generally,
skyrocketing 158 percent since 1968. The minimum wage would
be $13.02 if had kept pace with domestic profits and $20.46
if it had risen with retail profits.

CEO pay went up, but workers' wages went down. In 1980, the
average CEO at a major corporation made as much as 97
minimum wage workers. In 2000, they made as much as 1,223
minimum wage workers.&quot;

http://www.commondreams.org/views01/0829-08.htm

&quot;In 1980, CEOs made 42 times the pay of average factory
workers. In 1990, they made 85 times as much. By 1999, CEOs
made 475 times as much as workers.

CEOs got a raise of 17 percent last year while blue-collar
workers got a raise of 3.5 percent and white-collar workers
got a raise of 3.4 percent, just a little ahead of
inflation.&quot;

http://www.inequality.org/sklar2.html

&quot;According to Forbes, average CEO pay was $4M in 1996 and
$7.5M in 2002 (it was 11% higher in 2001).&quot;

&gt; McDonald's does pay more than minimum wage and they also

wage, but the facts
&gt; show otherwise. Minimum wage is a STARTING point, not an
ending point. 95%
&gt; of the people that make minimum wage have moved beyond
that within a year.
&gt; Fewer than 10% of all jobs in America even have a STARTING
wage that is
&gt; considered minimum. Fewer than 4% of adults work jobs that
pay minimum wage.
&gt; The minimum wage act was originally called the Womens and
Childrens Wage Act
&gt; and it was designed to protect woment and children.
&gt; Each and every time the minimum wage has been raised it
has hurt the very
&gt; people that are supposedly going to benefit, the poor and

"/> You are correct when you say that fewer than 4% of the
people in the US work for minimum wage. However, you are NOT
correct in the balance and I have posted cite after cite
after cite proving such. IF you increase minimum wage to
even $8.50 per hour, more than those working at the current
minimum would be affected... everyone making less than $8.50
per hour would be affected. The exact number of those
effected would depend on what was decided to be the new
mimum wage.

&quot;The majority of minimum wage workers are adults, many of
whom contribute substantially to family income.
a.. According to a study from the Economic Policy
Institute, nearly seven of every 10 workers (68 percent) who
would benefit from a $1.50 increase in the minimum wage are
adults.
b.. Adult women made up the single largest group of
beneficiaries from the last minimum wage increase,
representing 43 percent of the beneficiaries.
c.. EPI found that nearly eight of 10 workers who would
benefit from a $1.50 increase in the minimum wage work
full-time (42 percent) or between 20 and 34 hours per week
(34 percent).
d.. EPI also found that minimum wage workers contributed
an average of 76 percent of a family's weekly earnings in
families with less than $25,000 in income.
e.. A minimum wage increase also benefits many
single-parent families. Twenty-five percent of the workers
affected by the three-step increase in Oregon's minimum wage
to $6.50 by 1999 were heads of single-parent families.
f.. Forty percent of minimum wage workers are the sole
breadwinners in their families&quot;

That doesn't seem very responsible. Education: most have MBEs, which
amounts to learning how to steal with both hands, and experience
amounts to being able to shaft others on the way up.

That leaves &quot;willingness to take a risk.&quot; As soon as I'm done

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; cost of living (like the increases our dear Congressmen

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; And if minimum wage were increasing at the same rate as corporate

&gt;&gt;&gt; It is doubtful that any of these CEOs worked their way
&gt; up
&gt;&gt;&gt; from burger flipping. If they did, you can bet the

&gt;&gt;&gt; paid for their college education through grants, public

&gt;&gt; %%%%% I guarentee that the government got their investment
&gt; back in the first
&gt;&gt; 5 years after they graduated from college nad has been
&gt; making a high return
&gt;&gt; since. This would be an investment any stock broker would
&gt; recommend. That is
&gt;&gt; why you are able to get student loans for a higher
&gt; education. I guess no one
&gt;&gt; explained this little peice of economic to you.

&gt;&gt; EDUCATION = HIGHER INCOME = HIGHER TAXES PAID

&gt; I've got news for you, bubba.... grant don't get repaid at
&gt; all and the student loans have a very high rate of
&gt; non-repayment..

"/> %%%% It is still a good investment. Do you invest in the stock market?

&gt;&gt;&gt; And if minimum wage were increasing at the same rate as
&gt; corporate CEO
&gt;&gt;&gt; salary, it would be about $22 an hour.

&gt;&gt; So? If someone is still making minimum wage over the same
&gt;&gt; time that CEO salaries went up that much then that minimum
&gt;&gt; wage worker probably isn't even worth minimum wage.
&gt;&gt; You are also projecting, the average CEO salary is
&gt;&gt; about $200K, you want to only examine the superstars but
&gt;&gt; let's look at it. CEO salaries are a fixed point with a given
&gt;&gt; population - the vast majority of people making minimum
&gt;&gt; wage are not fixed so you've got to expand your
&gt;&gt; comparison a little, what if you compared the income
&gt;&gt; growth of the average minimum wage employee of 20 years
&gt;&gt; ago the to the average CEO wage growth?
&gt;&gt; The average wage today is around $30K, so my guess is that
&gt;&gt; over a 20 year span the average minimum wage worker's pay
&gt;&gt; has gone up around 500%. The median worker's pay has
&gt;&gt; gone up almost 1000%. My salary has gone up 2700%
&gt;&gt; since I was making minimum wage about 20 years ago and
&gt;&gt; there are many people that have done better than me. What
&gt;&gt; was the CEO wage growth?

&gt; 500% my arse!!!

"/> Virtually 100% of the people (it's going to be 99.9999%) of everyone that
was making minimum wage in 1973 have gon on and done something with their
lives and are no longer making minimum wage. If you want to measure from
1973, you would be correct, it's not 500% it would be closer to 830%.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; I can tell you EXACTLY what minimum wage was in 1973 because
&gt; I worked for it. It was $1.80 per hours. Today it is $5.15
&gt; per hour. That is quite a bit less of an increase that 500
&gt; percent, bub. In fact, it's less than 300 percent.

"/> But you, as a minimum wage worker of 1973, are no longer working at minimum
wage. If you are still working as a minimum wage employee 30 years later it
means that over nearly 1/3rd of a century you have acquired no appreciable
skills, no education and probably no better work ethic, that would justify a
raise.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&quot;In 1974 the minimum wage stood at $2.00 and equaled 45
&gt; percent of average wages in the economy. By 1993 the minimum
&gt; wage had increased to $4.25 but had fallen to 35 percent of
&gt; average wages.&quot;
&gt; http://www.epionline.org/study_detail.cfm?sid=59

"/> So? Minimum wages are paid to teenagers and unskilled workers. Most move on
as they gain experience.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; I can also tell you EXACTLY how much CEO wages have gone up
&gt; as well! Superstars my butt...30K my butt...we're talking
&gt; CEO AVERAGES here--the same as we're talking AVERAGE wage:

&gt; In 1960, it took 41 average paid workers to equal one
&gt; average paid CEO. In 1999, it took 475 average paid workers
&gt; to equal one average paid CEO.

&gt; http://www.stw.org/research/CEO_Pay_charts.html

"/> No, you are talking averages on the S&amp;P 500, not CEO pay for all CEOs - read
the chart. Most studies concentrate on CEO pay at large public companies,
not all companies. Nice try, but you were wrong. Again, the point is, so
what? What does it matter what one person makes versus another one, they are
performing different jobs. Those jobs have different values attached to
them. We pay secretaries differently than shop foremen, we pay accountants
differently than engineers. The market has decided what the pay structure
is, in 1994 the Clinton administration changed the tax codes to make high
salaries unpalatable to public companies, so the companies elected to drop
most CEO salaries to $1 million and reward CEOs with options. For most of
history those options would have been worth a few million over the time
frame giving the CEOs about the same salaries that they would have had
without them. The market went through the roof, so as an unintended
consequence many of these CEOs made not simply millions over time, but
hundreds of millions. Big deal - the money didn't come out of the pockets of
employees.
But the simple fact is that those gains were not received by not paying
people, those monies were paid by the investors that put money into the
company. The rank and file employees received their raises were paid for
their labors, and competed for jobs, benefits, and raises completely
seperated from whatever anyone else was making.

&gt;&gt;&gt; They need to pay more AND have health care, sorry to
&gt;&gt;&gt; say. But... a living range seems to run between $8 and $11
&gt;&gt;&gt; -- depending on location. Even if minimum wage had
&gt;&gt;&gt; adjusted by cost of living (like the increases our dear
&gt;&gt;&gt; Congressmen think they are entitled), it would be around
&gt;&gt;&gt; $8.50 now.

&gt;&gt; McDonald's does pay more than minimum wage and they also
&gt;&gt; offer a health plan. Starting salaries in many metropolitan
&gt;&gt; areas is better than $8.50/hour. Why do you think that
&gt;&gt; minimum wage is a salary? You seem to believe that there
&gt;&gt; is this vast need to raise minimum wage, but the facts
&gt;&gt; show otherwise. Minimum wage is a STARTING point, not
&gt;&gt; an ending point. 95% of the people that make minimum wage
&gt;&gt; have moved beyond that within a year. Fewer than 10% of all
&gt;&gt; jobs in America even have a STARTING wage that is
&gt;&gt; considered minimum. Fewer than 4% of adults work jobs that
&gt;&gt; pay minimum wage.
&gt;&gt; The minimum wage act was originally called the Womens and
&gt;&gt; Childrens Wage Act and it was designed to protect woment
&gt;&gt; and children. Each and every time the minimum wage has
&gt;&gt; been raised it has hurt the very people that are supposedly
&gt;&gt; going to benefit, the poor and teens. Each and every time
&gt;&gt; minumum wage is raised, those positions that pay minimum
&gt;&gt; wage are eliminated or growth slows. It does tend to raise
&gt;&gt; some other workers wages (those that were close to the
&gt;&gt; bottom) but not nearly enough to offset the reduction in jobs
&gt;&gt; and job growth.

&gt; You are correct when you say that fewer than 4% of the
&gt; people in the US work for minimum wage. However, you are NOT
&gt; correct in the balance and I have posted cite after cite
&gt; after cite proving such. IF you increase minimum wage to
&gt; even $8.50 per hour, more than those working at the current
&gt; minimum would be affected... everyone making less than $8.50
&gt; per hour would be affected. The exact number of those
&gt; effected would depend on what was decided to be the new
&gt; mimum wage.

"/> Please post the information that proves your point on the balances.
Increasing minimum wage doesn't always increase the pay of those that were
making more than the new bottom point. You are correct that everyone making
less than the proposed increase would benefit, the problem is that there
will be less of them as businesses adjust their headcount to reflect the new
realities. Again it doesn't really hurt the people that are working that
have already moved up from a minimum wage position, it hurts those that
truly ARE untrained and unskilled because there are then fewer jobs to
choose from and those positions become more competitive.

&gt; Institute, nearly seven of every 10 workers (68 percent) who
&gt; would benefit from a $1.50 increase in the minimum wage are
&gt; adults.

"/> That depends on your definition of adult. Since 1980, many states and
businesses have restricted most open jobs to those 16 and over, those of us
in our 40s that began working at age 12 have discovered this as our own
children have sought work. This is probably a true statement but is one of
those statistical lies.... when most people think of adults they picture
someone that has moved out of mom and dad's house and are actually
supporting themselves. In this group are people that are 18-25 that are
still in school, still living at home, and still dependent on mom and dad
for most of their support.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; b.. Adult women made up the single largest group of
&gt; beneficiaries from the last minimum wage increase,
&gt; representing 43 percent of the beneficiaries.

"/> Again, we haven't said that these people are breadwinners or actually on
their own. So it's probably a true statement, just skewed to a certain point
of view.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; c.. EPI found that nearly eight of 10 workers who would
&gt; benefit from a $1.50 increase in the minimum wage work
&gt; full-time (42 percent) or between 20 and 34 hours per week
&gt; (34 percent).

"/> If you are dealing with the group that you are focused on, statistics make
for an incredibly strong statement. But I'm not sure that this is a relative
statistic.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; d.. EPI also found that minimum wage workers contributed
&gt; an average of 76 percent of a family's weekly earnings in
&gt; families with less than $25,000 in income.

"/> Here you may actually have something, but how many families are represented
here? There absolutely are some families in America where the breadwinner
makes minimum wage, my examination of thsi statement would be where does the
other 24% come from? Welfare, a part-time worker, disability? If I were to
examine families making less than $25,000 - my guess would be that the major
breadwinner would be right around minimum wage (roughly $11,000). You've
narrowed the target significantly to again prove a point that may or may not
be relevant.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; e.. A minimum wage increase also benefits many
&gt; single-parent families. Twenty-five percent of the workers
&gt; affected by the three-step increase in Oregon's minimum wage
&gt; to $6.50 by 1999 were heads of single-parent families.
&gt; f.. Forty percent of minimum wage workers are the sole
&gt; breadwinners in their families&quot;
&gt; http://www.aflcio.org/yourjobeconomy/minimumwage/myths/myths9.cfm

"/> Again, is this a valid point? How many of these families had other members -
were REAL families? How many of these people were affected by this increase
in year 2 or 3, how many of them would not have needed this increase based
on their own increase in skills or education? In 1979 I was a family of one,
living off of less than $2000 and was the sole breadwinner (statistically)
but I was still supported by my parents and using my college savings while
attending classes. Statistically I would have fit in those categories and
&quot;benefitted&quot;, but not the way that the AFL-CIO is reporting it.

If you do a little more research you will find that there are very few
individuals in this nation that actually do make minimum wage and those that
do generally move up very quickly. The DOL-BLS has a raft of information on
this topic that you can examine yourself:
http://www.bls.gov/ncs/ocs/sp/ncbl0539.pdf
You can check pay by a number of different occupations and see what jobs
actually pay, what the average is, etc. You can also do a little more
research on other topics that may interest you or find additional charts:
http://www.bls.gov/ncs/ocs/home.htm#tables
The IRS also has a number of tables that show real income distribution in
the US, these are tax returns and don't necessarily have a correlation for
household or family income but it makes for interesting study:
http://www.irs.gov/taxstats/article/0,,id=96586,00.html

To see how many families (real families) are living off of minimum wage take
a look at Census data:
http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/income.html

Statistics can be manipulated to show whatever it is that you are trying to
prove. The AFL-CIO needs to show people that they need unions, that unions
protect them from companies, government, themselves, whatever. The EPI
itself is funded by labor unions and was created to provide &quot;data&quot; for their
points, the data is generally good but the analysis is generally skewed to a
certain viewpoint based on how it is presented. Looking at the EPI data that
the AFL-CIO used, the ages that EPI uses for an adult is 20 - but doesn't
break them out by whether they are living on their own.....
As a thinking person, my guess would be that the majority of those making
minimum wage would be younger, looking back at my own past I would say that.
Young people tend to change jobs often, looking for the type of work that
they want, taking a cut in pay to move from McDonald's to The GAP, reasoning
that the comfort was worth the drop since the money doesn't really matter.
So it could EASILY be reasoned that 70-80% of the adults that are making
minimum wage are 20 or 21 but the data is incomplete - I could be right or I
could be way wrong, again statistically the data could be misleading because
of the points that were chosen.

&gt;&gt;&gt; So? If someone is still making minimum wage over the

minimum

&gt;&gt;&gt; You are also projecting, the average CEO salary is

&gt;&gt;&gt; let's look at it. CEO salaries are a fixed point with

minimum

&gt;&gt;&gt; comparison a little, what if you compared the income
&gt;&gt;&gt; growth of the average minimum wage employee of 20
years
&gt;&gt;&gt; ago the to the average CEO wage growth?
&gt;&gt;&gt; The average wage today is around $30K, so my guess is
that
&gt;&gt;&gt; over a 20 year span the average minimum wage worker's
pay
&gt;&gt;&gt; has gone up around 500%. The median worker's pay has
&gt;&gt;&gt; gone up almost 1000%. My salary has gone up 2700%

by not paying

money into the

to fraudulently collect options to which they aren't
entitled. Many corporations are currently under
investigation for this very issue. AND... yes, each time a
CEO makes 300+ the wage of an average worker.... that CEO
is, indeed, taking money out of the pockets of workers.
AND... if that worker is a minimum wage worker, you, as a
taxpayer, are subsidizing that company's payroll for every
single worker that is not making a living wage. You are
either subsidizing it through college funds or welfare,
foodstamps, rent subsidies or something. Why you would want
to blame a worker who is doing the best s/he can to make a
living rather than some greedy SOBs that are making more
than anyone needs to live--even in the lap of luxury--is
beyond me. I suppose you're one of them.

&gt; elected to drop
&gt;&gt; most CEO salaries to $1 million and reward CEOs with
&gt; options. For most of
&gt;&gt; history those options would have been worth a few million
&gt; over the time
&gt;&gt; frame giving the CEOs about the same salaries that they
&gt; would have had
&gt;&gt; without them. The market went through the roof, so as an
&gt; unintended
&gt;&gt; consequence many of these CEOs made not simply millions
&gt; over time, but
&gt;&gt; hundreds of millions. Big deal - the money didn't come out
&gt; of the pockets of
&gt;&gt; employees.
&gt;&gt; But the simple fact is that those gains were not received
&gt; by not paying
&gt;&gt; people, those monies were paid by the investors that put
&gt; money into the
&gt;&gt; company. The rank and file employees received their raises
&gt; were paid for
&gt;&gt; their labors, and competed for jobs, benefits, and raises
&gt; completely
&gt;&gt; seperated from whatever anyone else was making.

&gt; Look at the other references and cites given to you. It is
&gt; an AVERAGE. You pick one cite out of several to make your
&gt; obtuse point. AND... it is not only the top corporations
&gt; discussed. CEOs are also pumping up the corporation profits
&gt; to fraudulently collect options to which they aren't
&gt; entitled. Many corporations are currently under
&gt; investigation for this very issue. AND... yes, each time a
&gt; CEO makes 300+ the wage of an average worker.... that CEO
&gt; is, indeed, taking money out of the pockets of workers.
&gt; AND... if that worker is a minimum wage worker, you, as a
&gt; taxpayer, are subsidizing that company's payroll for every
&gt; single worker that is not making a living wage. You are
&gt; either subsidizing it through college funds or welfare,
&gt; foodstamps, rent subsidies or something. Why you would want
&gt; to blame a worker who is doing the best s/he can to make a
&gt; living rather than some greedy SOBs that are making more
&gt; than anyone needs to live--even in the lap of luxury--is
&gt; beyond me. I suppose you're one of them.

&gt; You need to read the balance of the posts before rehashing
&gt; what has already been discussed.

"/> There aren't many corporations under investigation, it is only a few. No, as
a taxpayer I don't subsisize wages - what taxpayers subsidize are poor
choices by those individuals. They CHOSE not to complete high school, they
CHOSE not to go to college, they CHOSE not to develop effective work habits,
they CHOSE to have a baby before they were financially ready, they CHOSE to
live beyond their means there are a number of reasons other than &quot;corporate
greed&quot; as to why those individuals must ask that the government take way
from those that actually did do the right thing.

around
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; $8.50 now.

&gt;&gt;&gt; McDonald's does pay more than minimum wage and they
also
&gt;&gt;&gt; offer a health plan. Starting salaries in many
metropolitan
&gt;&gt;&gt; areas is better than $8.50/hour. Why do you think that
&gt;&gt;&gt; minimum wage is a salary? You seem to believe that
there
&gt;&gt;&gt; is this vast need to raise minimum wage, but the facts
&gt;&gt;&gt; show otherwise. Minimum wage is a STARTING point, not
&gt;&gt;&gt; an ending point. 95% of the people that make minimum
wage
&gt;&gt;&gt; have moved beyond that within a year. Fewer than 10%
of all
&gt;&gt;&gt; jobs in America even have a STARTING wage that is
&gt;&gt;&gt; considered minimum. Fewer than 4% of adults work jobs
that
&gt;&gt;&gt; pay minimum wage.
&gt;&gt;&gt; The minimum wage act was originally called the Womens
and
&gt;&gt;&gt; Childrens Wage Act and it was designed to protect
woment
&gt;&gt;&gt; and children. Each and every time the minimum wage has
&gt;&gt;&gt; been raised it has hurt the very people that are
supposedly
&gt;&gt;&gt; going to benefit, the poor and teens. Each and every
time
&gt;&gt;&gt; minumum wage is raised, those positions that pay
minimum
&gt;&gt;&gt; wage are eliminated or growth slows. It does tend to
raise
&gt;&gt;&gt; some other workers wages (those that were close to the
&gt;&gt;&gt; bottom) but not nearly enough to offset the reduction
in jobs
&gt;&gt;&gt; and job growth.

&gt;&gt; You are correct when you say that fewer than 4% of the
&gt;&gt; people in the US work for minimum wage. However, you are
NOT
&gt;&gt; correct in the balance and I have posted cite after cite
&gt;&gt; after cite proving such. IF you increase minimum wage to
&gt;&gt; even $8.50 per hour, more than those working at the
current
&gt;&gt; minimum would be affected... everyone making less than
$8.50
&gt;&gt; per hour would be affected. The exact number of those
&gt;&gt; effected would depend on what was decided to be the new
&gt;&gt; mimum wage.

&gt; Please post the information that proves your point on the

"/> balances.

Well, it doesn't take a genius or tons of citations to
realize that if minimum wage went up to... say... $8.50 or
$10.00 (as others have suggested) or $12.00 (as even others
have suggested) that many more people would realize pay
raises than just those working for $5.15 per hour. It would
include every making less than the amount to which minimum
wage would raise.

additional:

http://www.clev.frb.org/Research/com99/0201.pdf

Earlier studies used time-series data to

study the effects of changes in the

national minimum wage. The consensus

of these first-generation studies,

which were completed in the 1970s and

early 1980s, was that a 10 percent

increase in the minimum wage would

reduce the employment of low-skilled

(young) workers between 1 and 2 percent.

In the literature, the percent

change in employment divided by

the percent change in the minimum

wage is referred to as the elasticity of

employment with respect to the minimum

wage. Thus, for low-skilled workers

the consensus view placed this

elasticity between -0.1 and -0.2.3

Recent studies have used panel data covering

many states over a period of years

to study the effects of minimum wage

changes at the state level.4 Evidence

from these second-generation studies

has produced a more diverse set of

results, spurring considerable controversy

as to whether minimum wages

actually reduce employment of lowskilled

workers. In a series of papers

and a recent book, David Card and

Alan Krueger-leading proponents of

the view that the predictions of the standard

model are wrong-argue that not

only do minimum wages not reduce

employment, they may even increase it.5

On the other hand, much of the recent

evidence using similar sorts of data supports

the textbook prediction that minimum

wages reduce employment of lowskilled

workers. Paralleling the earlier

time-series evidence, this research concludes

that the elasticity of employment

of low-skilled workers with respect to

the minimum wage falls between -0.1

and -0.2, with estimates for teenagers-

a frequent focus of minimum wage

research-closer to -0.1.6

to economists), indicated that the

median best estimate of the minimum

wage elasticity for teenagers was -0.1,

while the mean estimate was - 0.21.

Despite some outlying perspectives,

economists' views of the effects of the

minimum wage still appear centered in

the range of the earlier consensus.

&gt;&gt;&quot;The majority of minimum wage workers are adults, many

&gt;&gt; a.. According to a study from the Economic Policy

&gt;&gt;who
&gt;&gt; would benefit from a $1.50 increase in the minimum wage
&gt;&gt;are

&gt; That depends on your definition of adult. Since 1980, many

Few of us, if any, started working at 12 other than

the case for a large percentage of people in their 40s.

&gt; supporting themselves. In this group are people that are
&gt; 18-25 that are
&gt; still in school, still living at home, and still dependent
&gt; on mom and dad
&gt; for most of their support.

"/> Again... you are rehashing things that have already been
discussed in this thread.

I've already de-bunked the myth that
the majority of minimum wage workers are teenagers.

http://www.econop.org/mwnote.htm

What can be said about the minimum wage worker:
a.. 71% of affected workers are 20 years or older

b.. The average age of an affected worker is 30.4 years

c.. Over 65% of affected workers have no more than 12
years of schooling

d.. Fewer than 30% of affected workers live with their
parents

e.. Almost 40 percent (39.4%) of minimum wage workers are
the sole source of income for their households.

f.. The median family income for a minimum wage worker is
$27,203.

g.. 54.4% of minimum wage workers live in households with
incomes less than $30,000

h.. The average hours worked per week for a minimum wage
worker is 28.7

i.. 45.9 percent of minimum wage workers are fulltime
employees

j.. Average number of weeks worked per year is 45.9% (out
of a possible 52!)

But... even if these workers are teenagers, who's to say
they many aren't assisting in the support of their
low-income family or living on their own.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; b.. Adult women made up the single largest group of
&gt;&gt; beneficiaries from the last minimum wage increase,
&gt;&gt; representing 43 percent of the beneficiaries.

&gt; Again, we haven't said that these people are breadwinners
&gt; or actually on
&gt; their own. So it's probably a true statement, just skewed
&gt; to a certain point
&gt; of view.

"/> See above... &quot;Almost 40 percent (39.4%) of minimum wage
workers are
the sole source of income for their households.&quot;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; c.. EPI found that nearly eight of 10 workers who
&gt;&gt;would
&gt;&gt; benefit from a $1.50 increase in the minimum wage work
&gt;&gt; full-time (42 percent) or between 20 and 34 hours per
&gt;&gt; week
&gt;&gt; (34 percent).

&gt; If you are dealing with the group that you are focused on,
&gt; statistics make
&gt; for an incredibly strong statement. But I'm not sure that
&gt; this is a relative
&gt; statistic.

"/> How many people economists need to say this before it
becomes a &quot;relative statistic&quot;? I have included cites that
show 500 + economists who support the issue. Are they wrong

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; d.. EPI also found that minimum wage workers
&gt;&gt; contributed
&gt;&gt; an average of 76 percent of a family's weekly earnings

&gt;&gt; families with less than $25,000 in income.

&gt; Here you may actually have something, but how many
&gt;&gt;families are represented
&gt; here? There absolutely are some families in America where
&gt; the breadwinner
&gt; makes minimum wage, my examination of thsi statement would
&gt; be where does the

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 500% my arse!!!

&gt;&gt;&gt; Virtually 100% of the people (it's going to be
99.9999%)
&gt;&gt; of everyone that
&gt;&gt;&gt; was making minimum wage in 1973 have gon on and done
&gt;&gt; something with their
&gt;&gt;&gt; lives and are no longer making minimum wage. If you
want
&gt;&gt; to measure from
&gt;&gt;&gt; 1973, you would be correct, it's not 500% it would be
&gt;&gt; closer to 830%.

&gt;&gt; It does not excuse the number of years I lived in
poverty at
&gt;&gt; the hands of greedy corporations to gain my current
level --
&gt;&gt; which, I might add, is not with a corporation.

&gt; The fact is, that you grew from being a minimum wage,
unskilled worker to
&gt; someone that earns more because they are worth more. End
of argument. At the
&gt; time you were making minimum wage that's what your skills
were worth, it had
&gt; nothing to do with a greedy corporation. By the way, how
does a corporation
&gt; get greedy? The corporation is simply a collection of

"/> people that own a part

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; of the operation, the majority of them are teachers,
engineers, bankers,
&gt; etc. Most people would be hard-pressed to call any of

"/> those people greedy.

The people owning, controlling and running the corporation
get greedy. No, the fact that I &quot;grew&quot; from minimum wage is
not the &quot;end of argument&quot; as you might like. I am an
exception, not the norm, for a minimum wage worker. Well,
perhaps not, I spent many years on foodstamps, medical, SS
and funding my college education through non-repayable
grants. So... in a sense, I may be exactly the picture of a
minimum wage working that worked 60 hours a week... for...
let's see... 10 years of the sole breadwinner role... until
I could no longer work and went on SS for ... let's see...
about 6 years under the self-supporting role and still
couldn't survive without taxpayer subsidies. And, more
pathetic yet, I got all of my federal and state income tax
back. So, if you feel comforable funding all of these
minimum wage workers for 10 years each, well, then, I guess
I'm okay with that. Ante up. It's going to cost you a pretty
penny.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I can tell you EXACTLY what minimum wage was in 1973
&gt;&gt; because
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I worked for it. It was $1.80 per hours. Today it is
&gt;&gt; $5.15
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; per hour. That is quite a bit less of an increase
that
&gt;&gt; 500
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; percent, bub. In fact, it's less than 300 percent.

&gt;&gt;&gt; But you, as a minimum wage worker of 1973, are no
longer
&gt;&gt; working at minimum
&gt;&gt;&gt; wage. If you are still working as a minimum wage
employee
&gt;&gt; 30 years later it
&gt;&gt;&gt; means that over nearly 1/3rd of a century you have
&gt;&gt; acquired no appreciable
&gt;&gt;&gt; skills, no education and probably no better work
ethic,
&gt;&gt; that would justify a
&gt;&gt;&gt; raise.

&gt;&gt; There are plenty of this people in the world that don't
have
&gt;&gt; the luxury to go through college. The average age of a
&gt;&gt; minimum wage worker is 30.4 years of age. Are you
telling me
&gt;&gt; that this person at 30 is somehow less deserving of a
living
&gt;&gt; wage than.... say.... yourself? Do you realize how much
you,
&gt;&gt; as a taxpayer, are subsidizing this individual because
their
&gt;&gt; employer is not willing to pay them a living wage? A
living
&gt;&gt; wage is NOT a raise. It is a bare subsistence. Minimum
wage
&gt;&gt; workers are NOT lazy and lacking work ethic as you would
&gt;&gt; have people believe. They may be learning disabled. They
may
&gt;&gt; have families and find themselves in the work market
late in
&gt;&gt; life due to divorce. They may have be displaced workers
&gt;&gt; whose jobs folded after years invested in a company.

&gt; Please post proof that the average minimum wage worker is
30. There is no
&gt; data that I have EVER found that would support such a

"/> claim.

I did several times... and to you once again.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;In 1974 the minimum wage stood at $2.00 and equaled
45
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; percent of average wages in the economy. By 1993 the
&gt;&gt; minimum
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; wage had increased to $4.25 but had fallen to 35
percent
&gt;&gt; of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; average wages.&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; http://www.epionline.org/study_detail.cfm?sid=59

&gt;&gt;&gt; So? Minimum wages are paid to teenagers and unskilled
&gt;&gt; workers. Most move on
&gt;&gt;&gt; as they gain experience.

&gt;&gt; That is a lie. It is not mostly teenage workers. 3/4 of
the
&gt;&gt; minimum wage workers are over the age of 19. 1/2 of the
&gt;&gt; minimum wage workers are over the age of 25. The average
age
&gt;&gt; for a minimum wage workers is 30.4 years of age. I have
&gt;&gt; provided citations proving these points in other posts
in
&gt;&gt; this same thread. You should really read all of the
posts
&gt;&gt; before you make yourself look so foolish by stating
things
&gt;&gt; that have no validity.

&gt; I challenge you to produce proof that 1/2 of minimum wage
workers are over
&gt; 25. If 1/2 are under 25 how do you arrive at an average of
30? Are you

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; CEO AVERAGES here--the same as we're talking AVERAGE
&gt;&gt; wage:

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; In 1960, it took 41 average paid workers to equal
one
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; average paid CEO. In 1999, it took 475 average paid

&gt;&gt;&gt; No, you are talking averages on the S&amp;P 500, not CEO
pay
&gt;&gt; for all CEOs - read
&gt;&gt;&gt; the chart. Most studies concentrate on CEO pay at
large
&gt;&gt; public companies,
&gt;&gt;&gt; not all companies. Nice try, but you were wrong.
Again,
&gt;&gt; the point is, so
&gt;&gt;&gt; what? What does it matter what one person makes versus
&gt;&gt; another one, they are
&gt;&gt;&gt; performing different jobs. Those jobs have different
&gt;&gt; values attached to
&gt;&gt;&gt; them. We pay secretaries differently than shop
foremen, we
&gt;&gt; pay accountants
&gt;&gt;&gt; differently than engineers. The market has decided
what
&gt;&gt; the pay structure
&gt;&gt;&gt; is, in 1994 the Clinton administration changed the tax
&gt;&gt; codes to make high
&gt;&gt;&gt; salaries unpalatable to public companies, so the
companies
&gt;&gt; elected to drop
&gt;&gt;&gt; most CEO salaries to $1 million and reward CEOs with
&gt;&gt; options. For most of
&gt;&gt;&gt; history those options would have been worth a few
million
&gt;&gt; over the time
&gt;&gt;&gt; frame giving the CEOs about the same salaries that
they
&gt;&gt; would have had
&gt;&gt;&gt; without them. The market went through the roof, so as
an
&gt;&gt; unintended

millions
&gt;&gt; over time, but
&gt;&gt;&gt; hundreds of millions. Big deal - the money didn't come

&gt;&gt; AND... if that worker is a minimum wage worker, you, as

ratings, but I rarely, if ever, fluxed more than .25 above
minimum wage. I did not plan for my husband to become
disabled. It took him nearly 5 years of fighting with SS to
gain his disability benefits and, by then, we were divorced

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;need?

&gt;&gt;&gt; I'll settle for one accurate one. How much experience
&gt;&gt;&gt; as a CEO did Cheney have when he became one? As
&gt;&gt;&gt; for responsibility, until very recently, being CEO meant
&gt;&gt;&gt; you could steal billions and just skate. That doesn't
&gt;&gt;&gt; seem very responsible. Education: most have MBEs,
&gt;&gt;&gt; which amounts to learning how to steal with both hands,
&gt;&gt;&gt; and experience amounts to being able to shaft others on
&gt;&gt;&gt; the way up.

&gt;&gt; 30-40 years in business and government as a leader.
&gt;&gt; You will have to name some CEOs that have stolen billions
&gt;&gt; and walked away.
&gt;&gt; Please name them.

&gt; How about a few dozen of them rather than just some?

Nothing here shows billions, although it does show 3 CEOs that are currently
under investigation and a variety of other senior managers that are under
investigation of criminal activity. In fact, this doesn't even point out
that these individuals were able to net a lot of money for themselves, just
that they used questionable means to prop up their stock price. Even that
wouldn't be stealing from their own companies.

There is nothing alleging criminal activity in this one, nor does it really
have anything to do with your point. Executive compansation committees
should have some kind of capability to recall bonuses if the bonuses were
paid on fraudulent numbers. What about profit sharing employees? Should they
have been forced to pay back their bonuses? Again, it may be immoral but you
haven't demonstrated what you were trying to demonstrate.

"/> This article in fact shows that average CEO salaries are $339,000 and
average total compensation is $1.39 million - you will note that that is
close to what I've been telling you. It also doesn't detail any criminal
activity but tries to draw some comparisons between the CEOs of a couple of
large Wisconsin firms and a small soapmaker.

"/> Interesting article, unfortunately it, as well, doesn't futher your case.
It's more of a wage rant.

You posted 12 references to articles that supposedly detailed criminal
activity by CEOs against their own companies. 6 of the articles don't even
have references to criminal activity they are simply rehashes of the same
argument &quot;who can be worth X when Y is barely getting by&quot;. Some referred to
restated earnings, but that happens all of the time and doesn't always mean
that there was a cover up, in many cases the FASB requirements have changed
or were interpreted one way and it was discovered to be wrong (sometimes by
the company sometimes by their auditors and sometimes as the result of an
SEC investigation). There was 1 article that specifically addressed criminal
activity by CEOs - none of which indicated that the CEO in question used
his/her position to simply empty the company treasury. The only one that I
have heard that seems to have come close is the former CEO at Tyco
(Koslowski) and he's not mentioned in ANY of them. There are questions of
misconduct which seems to have covered up losses and kept the stock price
artificially high, but in the articles you submitted that appears to be at
most 4 CEOs. Whether any of them directly profited is a legitimate question.
There were 2 articles that dealt with some other criminal activities (Martha
Stewart) none of which support your claim. There were 2 other articles that
were additional references to previously covered cases (the 2nd article
covered them). There was also 1 article that had a reference to a securities
trader that was engaged in some illegal activity. I gave you one that would
have provided a foundation for your claim, you didn't even provide one let
alone the &quot;dozens&quot; that you announced.

The real problem (as I see it) is that somehow we have gotten away from the
idea that taxes are simply the means to pay for government. Some people use
them to &quot;limit greed&quot;, others to punish too much success, others to help
some and hurt others depending on who and what you are. I don't blame the
Enron executives for trying what they did, our tax laws punish some
companies and reward others and the tax laws have been crafted in such a way
that companies are looking for ways to reduce their tax bite. The tax code
is THOUSANDS of pages long and treats some entities differently than others.
The loopholes are there and companies pay thousands of lawyers and
accountants to find them. Did they go too far? Yes. But even Congress and
the IRS have spent months trying to figure out what they did and how it was
done. The way to stop it is to simplify it so that there is no question,
there is no wiggle room, there are no loopholes. Each company or business
entity in America would pay the same taxes as a percentage of profit and
companies would move to a more formal cash basis. You want to fix it?
Eliminate options for corporate executives, that way there is no question
that their manipulation of stock prices could reward them greatly. Allow
them to buy the stock, even as an ESOP program, but eliminate free gifts.
Eliminate the taxable cap on cash salaries/bonuses, let companies pay CEOs
what the market will bear. Let the compensation committees come up with ways
to protect the company from executive fraud (pay large bonuses out over
several years, defer some for 3 years after earning it, etc.). Don't limit
what someone can achieve, don't artificially limit how much someone can
make, and don't punish success.

I had an apartment with roomates to split the bill and didn't do too bad. I
was a head of household that was on minimum wage - the statistic is
misleading.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; this is a relative

&gt; How many people economists need to say this before it

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;&gt; d.. EPI also found that minimum wage workers
&gt;&gt;&gt; contributed
&gt;&gt;&gt; an average of 76 percent of a family's weekly earnings
&gt;&gt;&gt; in
&gt;&gt;&gt; families with less than $25,000 in income.

&gt;&gt; Here you may actually have something, but how many
&gt;&gt;&gt;families are represented
&gt;&gt; here? There absolutely are some families in America where
&gt;&gt; the breadwinner
&gt;&gt; makes minimum wage, my examination of thsi statement would
&gt;&gt; be where does the
&gt;&gt; other 24% come from? Welfare, a part-time worker,
&gt;&gt; disability?

&gt; Child support? And definitely welfare. The wage would bump
&gt; you off disability because, if you are able to work, you do
&gt; not collect disability beyond the one year trial period
&gt; allotted by SS.

&gt;&gt; If I were to
&gt;&gt; examine families making less than $25,000 - my guess would
&gt;&gt; be that the major
&gt;&gt; breadwinner would be right around minimum wage (roughly
&gt;&gt; $11,000). You've
&gt;&gt; narrowed the target significantly to again prove a point
&gt;&gt; that may or may not
&gt;&gt; be relevant.

&gt; As of 2000, 30.59% (or 2,262,782) of the total households
&gt; (7,397,294) in the US made $24,999 or less. So that would
&gt; mean that 40% of these households under $25,000 have a sole
&gt; source of minimum wage worker supplying their income, it
&gt; would equate to 905,112.8 households, which would then
&gt; equate to 12% of the total households. That's a LOT of
&gt; household that the taxpayers are supporting just because the
&gt; employer isn't willing to pay a living wage.
&gt; http://www.censusscope.org/us/s48/chart_income.html

"/> This data is for Texas, NOT the US. However, based on these numbers though
you would expect to find that better than 20% of the people would be in
poverty - recognizing that almost half aren't even making minimum wage over
the course of a year. If the taxpaters are supporting them it's because the
members of the households moved out from mom and dad's before they were
ready. It means that they didn't set their expectations based on their own
earning power.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; Statistics can be manipulated to show whatever it is that

&gt;&gt;&gt; other 24% come from? Welfare, a part-time worker,
&gt;&gt;&gt; disability?

&gt;&gt; Child support? And definitely welfare. The wage would
bump
&gt;&gt; you off disability because, if you are able to work, you
do
&gt;&gt; not collect disability beyond the one year trial period
&gt;&gt; allotted by SS.

&gt;&gt;&gt; If I were to
&gt;&gt;&gt; examine families making less than $25,000 - my guess
would
&gt;&gt;&gt; be that the major
&gt;&gt;&gt; breadwinner would be right around minimum wage
(roughly
&gt;&gt;&gt; $11,000). You've
&gt;&gt;&gt; narrowed the target significantly to again prove a
point
&gt;&gt;&gt; that may or may not
&gt;&gt;&gt; be relevant.

&gt;&gt; As of 2000, 30.59% (or 2,262,782) of the total
households
&gt;&gt; (7,397,294) in the US made $24,999 or less. So that
would
&gt;&gt; mean that 40% of these households under $25,000 have a
sole
&gt;&gt; source of minimum wage worker supplying their income, it
&gt;&gt; would equate to 905,112.8 households, which would then
&gt;&gt; equate to 12% of the total households. That's a LOT of
&gt;&gt; household that the taxpayers are supporting just because
the
&gt;&gt; employer isn't willing to pay a living wage.

it's because the

&gt;&gt; situation.

&gt; I did, it just depends on your interpetation.

&gt;&gt;&gt; but not the way that the AFL-CIO is
&gt;&gt;&gt; reporting it.

&gt;&gt; A breadwinner is defined as &quot;One whose earnings are the
&gt;&gt; primary source of support for one's dependents.&quot; And, of
&gt;&gt; course, sole, in this instance, means one or only. You
would
&gt;&gt; not have been considered the &quot;primary source of support&quot;
for
&gt;&gt; any dependents. In fact, one of your parents would have
been
&gt;&gt; the considered the breadwinner in your family. But, I'm
sure
&gt;&gt; you already knew this and are simply trying to eschew
the
&gt;&gt; facts.

&gt; I would have at the time because my salary was the only
one being reported
&gt; and that is how I would have answered any surveys.

&gt;&gt;&gt; If you do a little more research you will find that
there
&gt;&gt;&gt; are very few
&gt;&gt;&gt; individuals in this nation that actually do make
minimum
&gt;&gt;&gt; wage and those that
&gt;&gt;&gt; do generally move up very quickly. The DOL-BLS has a

&gt; They appear to be discussing the appendixes provided by
&gt; David Macpherson in a study entitled &quot;The Effects of the
&gt; Proposed 1999-2000 Washington Minimum Wage Increase&quot; for the
&gt; Employment Policies Institute.

&gt; It appears that this report has been pulled from most of its
&gt; former locations... probably because of the number of
&gt; inconsistencies he put forth, which were those being
&gt; reported by Economic Opportunity Institute and others:
&gt;&quot;While the summary and body of the study are useful for the
&gt; propaganda purposes of the opponents to the minimum wage
&gt; increase, the data in the appendices undermine their own
&gt; arguments regarding who the minimum wage will benefit.&quot;

&gt; Now, it appears to be buried in archives but here is the
&gt; link so that you may examine the appendixes yourself:

&gt; http://www.epionline.org/studies/macpherson_wa_05-1998.pdf

"/> This document definitely contradicts the econop points. I'm not surprised it
was pulled. It also tends to provide a more solid basis for my argument. But
I now see where you got your figures - you have been stating them as US
figures, but they are really a single state's figures. Your argument MAY
hold true for a single state, but it may or may not hold up as a national
average. Just as you did below you are mixing state and national numbers to
arrive at your conclusions.
If you read the table that it is discussed you will note that out of ALL
Washington workers 5.8% are aged 16-19 and only 29% of THEM would be
affected by a minimum wage increase. The 30.2 average age number is from a
small defined population, if there were only 2 workers one 19 and another 79
then the average is 49, taking 2 19 yyear olds and a 79 year old you get
39.... so even though seniors only account for 1.7% of all workers they make
up 2.7% of the affected workers and that would tend to skew the numbers even
though these seniors probably have Social Security and/or retirment income
and are only looking to stay busy or supplement their retirement and don't
want to do more than some minimum wage job. It's hard to say based on the
data provided.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;&gt; But... even if these workers are teenagers, who's to say
&gt;&gt;&gt; they many aren't assisting in the support of their
&gt;&gt;&gt; low-income family or living on their own.

&gt;&gt; The vast majority aren't, but you are correct who's to
&gt; say?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; b.. Adult women made up the single largest group
&gt; of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; beneficiaries from the last minimum wage increase,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; representing 43 percent of the beneficiaries.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Again, we haven't said that these people are
&gt; breadwinners
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; or actually on
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; their own. So it's probably a true statement, just
&gt; skewed
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to a certain point
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of view.

&gt;&gt;&gt; See above... &quot;Almost 40 percent (39.4%) of minimum wage
&gt;&gt;&gt; workers are the sole source of income for their
&gt; households.&quot;

&gt;&gt; When I was 20, I was the &quot;sole source&quot; of income for my
&gt; family (at minimum
&gt;&gt; wage) although I did have $20,000 that I had saved to pay
&gt; for college and
&gt;&gt; also had a scholarship to pay tuition. When I was working
&gt; for minimum wage,
&gt;&gt; I had an apartment with roomates to split the bill and
&gt; didn't do too bad. I
&gt;&gt; was a head of household that was on minimum wage - the
&gt; statistic is
&gt;&gt; misleading.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; c.. EPI found that nearly eight of 10 workers who
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;would
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; benefit from a $1.50 increase in the minimum wage
&gt; work
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; full-time (42 percent) or between 20 and 34 hours
&gt; per
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; week
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (34 percent).

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If you are dealing with the group that you are focused
&gt; on,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; statistics make
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; for an incredibly strong statement. But I'm not sure
&gt; that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; this is a relative
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; statistic.

&gt;&gt;&gt; How many people economists need to say this before it
&gt;&gt;&gt; becomes a &quot;relative statistic&quot;? I have included cites
&gt; that
&gt;&gt;&gt; show 500 + economists who support the issue. Are they
&gt; wrong
&gt;&gt;&gt; and you right?

&gt;&gt; There are hundreds of economists that disagree with your
&gt; statement, there
&gt;&gt; are facts that disagree with your statement, again it
&gt; depends on your
&gt;&gt; viewpoint and how narrowly or broadly you are looking at
&gt; the data.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; d.. EPI also found that minimum wage workers
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; contributed
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; an average of 76 percent of a family's weekly
&gt; earnings
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; families with less than $25,000 in income.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Here you may actually have something, but how many
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;families are represented
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; here? There absolutely are some families in America
&gt; where
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the breadwinner
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; makes minimum wage, my examination of thsi statement
&gt; would
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; be where does the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; other 24% come from? Welfare, a part-time worker,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; disability?

&gt;&gt;&gt; Child support? And definitely welfare. The wage would
&gt; bump
&gt;&gt;&gt; you off disability because, if you are able to work, you

"/> Maybe and maybe not, it gets down to interpretation of the data - like I
pointed out, statistics are some of the best lies around. It depends on how
the data is presented. Dr. MacPherson doesn't seem to have an agenda - he's
from out of state and doesn't appear to have a vested interest in what
happens. The Economic Opportunity Institute (as does the Employment Policies
Institute) DOES have a vested interest, it is funded by unions, and is
geared to create a movement to increase the minimum wage and the
establishment of &quot;living wage&quot; ordinances. The equivalent would be if you

&gt; I have discussed the total number of families under $25,000

overstated your case and used incorrect totals to arrive at many of your

less than $24,999) which you snipped from this response. The Census data
shows otherwise, both by family:

household:  http://ferret.bls.census.gov/macro/032002/hhinc/new01_001.htm .
ARE there people that are living as you have indicated? Yes, but their
numbers are smaller than you have stated and the problem isn't indicative of

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; If you read the table that it is discussed you will note
&gt;&gt; that out of ALL Washington workers 5.8% are aged
&gt;&gt; 16-19 and only 29% of THEM would be
&gt;&gt; affected by a minimum wage increase.

&gt; So... that leaves 71% of the 5.8% over the age of 19.
&gt; Weren't we discussing the demographics of the minimum wage
&gt; worker? So... if you take 5,894,121 times 5.8%, you have
&gt; 341,859 people working for minimum wage. If you take 71% of
&gt; that figure, you have 242,719 people that are over the age
&gt; of 19 and working for minimum wage, which amounts to 4% of
&gt; the total state populace. I would imagine that a vast
&gt; portion of these folks are on public assistance in some
&gt; form: college grants or subsidies, foodstamps, housing
&gt; assitance, utility assistance, TANF, etc.
&gt; http://www.enchantedlearning.com/usa/states/population.shtml

"/> Maybe and maybe not, you can't tell based on the information that you have
provided. However, Washington's poverty rate is about the same as the
national rate so my guess would be something close to 11% of the state
population is on assistance. Those are only the formal programs, there are
other programs that are designed for the working poor (medical coverage,
school lunches, etc.) and the disabled. If only 4% of the adult state
workers are making minimum wage then there must be other reasons for so many
more people to be on public assistance rather than their wages........
Your argument is similar to many teachers that campaign for new levys to
&quot;support the schools and our children&quot;, they want raises and more teachers
to be employed (to grow their union) but at the same time they haven't
delivered a quality education to the students. Study after study has
demonstrated that there is little correlation to higher teacher salaries and
smaller class sizes that leads to increased standardized test scores, but
they have convinced many people that that is the case. The argument SOUNDS
logical but the facts show otherwise.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; The 30.2 average age number is from a
&gt;&gt; small defined population, if there were only 2 workers one
&gt;&gt; 19 and another 79 then the average is 49, taking 2 19 year
&gt;&gt; olds and a 79 year old you get 39.... so even though seniors
&gt;&gt; only account for 1.7% of all workers they make
&gt;&gt; up 2.7% of the affected workers and that would tend to
&gt;&gt; skew the numbers even though these seniors probably have
&gt;&gt; Social Security and/or retirment income and are only looking
&gt;&gt; to stay busy or supplement their retirement and don't
&gt;&gt; want to do more than some minimum wage job. It's hard to
&gt;&gt; say based on the data provided.

&gt; Yes, I examined it as well and I am not stupid as I
&gt; understand that averaging two people is different than the
&gt; entire US average, but this particular article is about the
&gt; State of Washington. I wouldn't call a whole state a &quot;small
&gt; defined population,&quot; although this gentlemen has done some
&gt; on a couple of cities and those I would consider much more
&gt; of a &quot;small defined population.&quot; But as a middle-of-the-road
&gt; state (15th of 51 in population ranking), I would consider
&gt; the State of Washington to be fairly representative of the
&gt; balance of the US.
&gt; http://www.enchantedlearning.com/usa/states/population.shtml

"/> Again, I wouldn't. Washington State has seen a vast influx of technology
workers over the last 15 years - many of whom fled from California. The
population has grown dramatically over the last decade through artificial
means (immigration) so the ages and income of the population hasn't been all
that static. Over the whole US, immigration has been a much smaller
percentage of the population changes over the last decade.
Like I said, raising the minimum wage and enacting &quot;living wage&quot; ordinances
sounds like a good thing. But the facts are that both cost people jobs.
Recently the City of Cincinnati had to back off it's living wage ordinance
because a local car wash (they washed the police and fire cars) was going to
have to lay off people and drop the contract to service city vehicles. The
city wouldn't pay more for the service to cover the increased costs. Some
employees were already making more than the &quot;living wage&quot; (via tips - but
that was a variable component and doesn't count toward a &quot;living wage&quot;), the
company couldn't afford to pay the extra to all of its employees (small
business) so it was going to drop the city contract and lay off about 1/2 of
its workforce due to the decrease in business.
Your argument about these people having extra money is a good one, but
wouldn't that be the case no matter what economic strata you were at? Some
might consider me rich, but compared to many folks I am a pauper, should I
have to scrimp to buy a Mercedes (or God forbid - finance it) if I wanted
one. How can someone drive a Mercedes knowing that there are people in the
world driving Chevys?
You haven't really presented anything that challenges what I have said and
presented. There are few jobs in America that even pay minimum wage, the
vast majority of those jobs are held by teenagers and young adults that are
just starting out on their career path. Within a few years most have moved
beyond minimum wage as they mature and gain experience and an education.
There are some people that do not move beyond a minimum wage job but either
they aren't capable of accepting more responsibility or to do more valuable
work or for some reason they can't. The answer is not to guarantee a given
wage for ANY part of the population, does a drug addict/high school
dropout/spouse abuser/parolee DESERVE the same pay as a hardworking person
that simply doesn't have the brains to do anything beyond simple tasks? One
is limited by ability and the other by life choices. I certainly don't feel
right rewarding some goofball while feeling pity for someone else. Is it
fair to those people that followed the rules, invested in themselves, and
didn't hurt anyone to find out that some idiot deserves a certain wage
simply because they are alive? I also don't think it's fair to take away the
earnings of that hard working concientious employee to subsidize (through
welfare) someone elses poor choices - to me self-inflicted conditions should
automatically disqualify you from assistance programs. If you want to help
the kids, get them away from the destructive parents and sterilize the
parents so that additional children aren't harmed by their behavior.

&gt; It depends on how
&gt; the data is presented. Dr. MacPherson doesn't seem to have
an agenda - he's
&gt; from out of state and doesn't appear to have a vested
interest in what
&gt; happens.

"/> Actually, he has a very BIG agenda as he goes around selling
anti-analysis to many cities, states, etc. They hire him
because they already KNOW his analysis. If he didn't produce
the analysis they want, believe me, they would toss him out
on his ear. This is what has gained him a certain notoriety.

What about this:
http://www.laane.org/pressroom/stories/sm021009smmirror.html
&quot;This week, we joined nearly 120 economists in signing a
letter endorsing Measure JJ (see story, page 1). We and the
other co-signers feel confident in concluding that the
living wage law will provide significant benefit to workers
and their families, without imposing an undue burden on
affected businesses.

This conclusion is based on a careful review of the
city-commissioned living wage study conducted by Professor
Robert Pollin, director of the Political Economy Research
Institute at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, and
his colleague, Professor Mark Brenner. Pollin and Brenner's
study offers persuasive evidence that Measure JJ is sound
public policy, and will achieve its goal of helping workers
while minimizing negative impact on business.

Pollin and Brenner's analysis makes clear that the primary
beneficiaries of Measure JJ will be the working poor. Their
study also establishes that affected businesses can readily
absorb the wage increases, and that any resulting job loss
will likely be small.

In offering our endorsement, we note the peer review of
Pollin and Brenner's study by Professor Richard Freeman, who
holds chairs at both Harvard University and the London
School of Economics. Freeman, one of the world's leading
labor economists, affirmed all the major findings of Pollin
and Brenner's study and described it as 'a fine piece of
applied economic analysis,' and 'a well-done empirical
investigation.' &quot;

Or... what about this?

&quot;Opponents of the Living Wage Movement invariably make
essentially the same economic argument, regardless of its
lack of empirical support. In the absence of any supporting
evidence, they claim that higher minimum wages in general,
and specifically Living Wage laws, lead to job loss,
economic devastation, and mass business migration. But
highly respected economists from across the political
spectrum are finding that this long-held assumption is
untrue in practice. Empirical economic research suggests
that increases in the federal minimum wage - even those
adopted during recessions, as in 1990 and 1991 - have
resulted in no discernible job losses. With respect to
recent state or federal minimum wage increases, other
studies have yielded similar findings. Nobel laureate Robert
Solow at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology has
observed: 'The main thing about the research is that the
evidence of job loss is weak. And the fact that the evidence
is weak suggests that the impact on jobs is small.' Richard
Freeman of Harvard University, who is probably the country's
foremost labor economist, has said, 'the entire literature
on the minimum wage [now agrees] that employment losses are
modest.' The eminent Harvard economist, John Kenneth
Galbraith, has commented even more pointedly: 'That [a
socially adequate minimum wage] will diminish employment
opportunity, the argument most commonly made in opposition,
may be dismissed out of hand, for that is invariably the
special plea of those who do not wish to pay the wage, and
it is without empirical support.' It is becoming clear that
the assumption that higher minimum wages reduce jobs is
simply inaccurate. More recent research specifically on the
impact of Living Wage Ordinances adopted in various
jurisdictions around the country has strongly reinforced
these conclusions. The economic argument against the Living
Wage has neither empirical support nor merit. A prominent
Living Wage skeptic David Neumark, a professor of economics
at Michigan State University, has recently published
research showing that Living Wage laws have a positive
overall impact. 'I'm no longer ready to dismiss these
policies out of hand,' Professor Neumark is quoted as
stating. His research compared 12 cities with Living Wage
Ordinances to a control group of cities without them. The
study found minimal job losses, which were more than
compensated for by significant income gains among the lowest
paid workers. These results square with simple common sense.
Over 100 municipalities around the country have adopted
Living Wage Ordinances. We can see that the sky has not
fallen. Businesses have not fled from those municipalities.
Economic development has not been impaired. The studies have
shown a decrease in poverty and increases in worker
stability and productivity. The debate from now on should be
more intellectually honest. Opponents of Living Wage
Ordinances should simply state that they don't want workers
to be able to earn enough money to support families, without
regard to specious claims of adverse economic impacts for
which there is no credible evidence.&quot;

go the union route. I have no problem paying a teacher a lot of money (our
school board has done some interesting things to reward good teachers
individually) the top math teacher in the school system makes nearly $80K -
not bad for 10 months work. Our local teacher's union is going against the
state recommendations and some of the other local municipalities to change
things. Our students have the highest standardized test scores in the state
(whether state accreditation or college boards). The starting salary in our
school district is $28K - before teaching a single class. There aren't many

everyone has the mental agility to do it but there are other choices. Many
of this nation's wealthiest people never went to college. Many successful
small bunsiness owners never went to college. As you have pointed out, only
4% of the adult population even works for minimum wage, while we disagree as
to their makeup and whether it is a real issue, that's a fact that we agree
on. It is an incredibly small number of people and it means that 94% of all

little and for my scholarship (and military service) to pay for school. When
I 1st began working I after college I wasn't making much more than minimum
wage. We had kids very early and legally were in poverty for most of our 1st
5 years of marriage. I came from a background that insisted that you carry
your own weight so it never entered my mind to take something that I didn't
earn. We overcame those things and it made us stronger. We knew what it was
like to be poor and we also found out that you CAN overcome just about
anything if you put your mind and backs to it. We appreciate what we have

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;&gt; Your argument is similar to many teachers that
campaign
&gt;&gt;&gt; for new levys to &quot;support the schools and our
children&quot;,
&gt;&gt;&gt; they want raises and more teachers to be employed
&gt;&gt;&gt; (to grow their union) but at the same time they
haven't
&gt;&gt;&gt; delivered a quality education to the students. Study
after
&gt;&gt;&gt; study has demonstrated that there is little
correlation to
&gt;&gt;&gt; higher teacher salaries and smaller class sizes that
leads
&gt;&gt;&gt; to increased standardized test scores, but they have
&gt;&gt;&gt; convinced many people that that is the case. The
&gt;&gt;&gt; argument SOUNDS logical but the facts show
&gt;&gt;&gt; otherwise.

&gt;&gt; This is the the topic of discussion and I have not
&gt;&gt; researched it to know whether it is true or not true.
But, I
&gt;&gt; do know that I could give you a barrage about how
&gt;&gt; standardized test scores are the largest fallacies going
to
&gt;&gt; student ability measurement. Both sides of the argument,
as
&gt;&gt; with many arguments, SOUND logical. But... with
teachers,
&gt;&gt; the sheer fact that they are so grossly underpaid for
the
&gt;&gt; education level attained is, in my humble opinion, fact.
&gt;&gt; About the only others ones that are that underpaid for
the
&gt;&gt; education level required might be librarians with their
MLS,
&gt;&gt; although I'm sure others exist. That fact that we, as a
&gt;&gt; country, devalue teachers, librarians, etc. may explain
why
&gt;&gt; so few choose the field... and perhaps even why so many
&gt;&gt; qualified do not choose the field. For example, I was
asked
&gt;&gt; to go on to receive my PhD to teach English. It was
fully
&gt;&gt; funded through a TA, but... then, I asked myself why
bother
&gt;&gt; with 4 more years of schooling at 10K a year TA funds to
&gt;&gt; wind up making 20K a year LESS than I made by working
with
&gt;&gt; stats. That's the issue. You aren't going to get good
&gt;&gt; teachers with those type of figures.

&gt; Depends on where you are. I'm not convinced that they are
underpaid, I am
&gt; convinced that we don't do enough to reward good ones but
teachers chose to
&gt; go the union route.

"/> Not all. I taught for two years. I was not unionized. In
fact, more university professors are not unionized.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I have no problem paying a teacher a lot of money (our
&gt; school board has done some interesting things to reward
good teachers
&gt; individually) the top math teacher in the school system

&gt; not bad for 10 months work. Our local teacher's union is
going against the

scores in the state

"/> Are you in California or Ohio? In Ohio, that would be a
living... in California? I don't know. And, I hate the break
the news to you, but all teachers have to teach classes
during their teacher training, so, techically, they have all
taught between 1-3 years (depending on education level)
before they get a starting salary. And, most schools
nowadays, seem to prefer an MA versus a BA. That, or they
hire you as a substitute teacher until you obtain your MA.

&gt;&gt;&gt; One is limited by ability and the other by life

&gt;&gt; Limited, yes, but not always by choice. I, for example,
am

Fortunately, I
&gt;&gt; have a high intellectual capability. Others do not. This
was
&gt;&gt; not their choice.

You don't get it. I don't WANT your charity. I, like many
people with disabilities, WANT a right to earn a living.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;&gt; I certainly don't feel right rewarding some goofball
while
&gt;&gt;&gt; feeling pity for someone else. Is it fair to those
people
&gt;&gt;&gt; that followed the rules, invested in themselves, and
&gt;&gt;&gt; didn't hurt anyone to find out that some idiot
deserves a
&gt;&gt;&gt; certain wage simply because they are alive?

&gt;&gt; Okay, just because the person is an &quot;idiot&quot; as you
choose to
&gt;&gt; define a perons that does not have the intellectual
&gt;&gt; capability to go to college, you think they should live
in
&gt;&gt; poverty? Great. And you think that people working for
&gt;&gt; minimum wage are goofballs? Were you when you worked for
&gt;&gt; minimum wage? Whatever.

&gt; The idiot is the individual that has made a series of bad
choices to get
&gt; them in their present situation: dropped out of high
school, high school
&gt; pregnancy, drug addicts, slackers, etc. They believe that
they are entitled
&gt; to something without working for it. Not everyone can go
to college and not
&gt; everyone has the mental agility to do it but there are
other choices. Many
&gt; of this nation's wealthiest people never went to college.
Many successful
&gt; small bunsiness owners never went to college. As you have
pointed out, only
&gt; 4% of the adult population even works for minimum wage,

"/> while we disagree as

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; to their makeup and whether it is a real issue, that's a
fact that we agree

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; of the adults that are working have moved beyond minimum
wage, from the

year olds have
&gt; moved beyond minimum wage. What has happened is that

"/> somehow, those 71% have

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; outworked some adults to take those higher paying jobs.

"/> Sorry, but this is a rehash for the most part. I think we

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;&gt; I also don't think it's fair to take away the
&gt;&gt;&gt; earnings of that hard working concientious employee to
&gt;&gt;&gt; subsidize (through welfare) someone elses poor choices
&gt;&gt;&gt; - to me self-inflicted conditions should automatically
&gt;&gt;&gt; disqualify you from assistance programs. If you want
to
&gt;&gt;&gt; help the kids, get them away from the destructive
parents
&gt;&gt;&gt; and sterilize the parents so that additional children
aren't
&gt;&gt;&gt; harmed by their behavior.

&gt;&gt; Most of your argument is tired and worn and full of
anger
&gt;&gt; towards people in poverty.

&gt; No, because my grandparents were very poor. My parents
came from poverty,
&gt; there were times growing up when the electricity got

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; kept at it and overcame their limitations to move into the
middle class.
&gt; That allowed me to work and save for college and for my
parents to help a
&gt; little and for my scholarship (and military service) to

"/> pay for school. When

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I 1st began working I after college I wasn't making much
more than minimum
&gt; wage. We had kids very early and legally were in poverty
for most of our 1st

"/> insisted that you carry

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; your own weight so it never entered my mind to take

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; earn.

"/> I understand. But... some take it that what they and their
families have already paid in taxes more than adequately
pays for whatever assistance they may need. (just another
POV)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; We overcame those things and it made us stronger. We knew
what it was
&gt; like to be poor and we also found out that you CAN
overcome just about
&gt; anything if you put your mind and backs to it. We

"/> appreciate what we have

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; and understand what it has cost us to get what we do have.
Our kids
&gt; appreciate it as well. Being poor is a great motivator to
hard work if you
&gt; don't know where your next meal is coming from.

"/> Yes, sometimes. I believe adversity has made me stronger,
but I scarcely think that earning a living wage will
eliminate adversity or weaken people. After all, we aren't
talking BMWs here, we're talking enough to cover basic
needs. And, even if you make a living wage, that doesn't
mean you aren't responsible for getting out there and
working hard to earn it. It doesn't mean you can't get fired
for goofing off. You still have to work hard to assure your
next meal.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Well, it is your opinion. I, however, understand that
all
&gt;&gt; people, not even a large portion, living in poverty are
not
&gt;&gt; bums and people who make poor choices because I lived
&gt;&gt; in proverty sticken areas of cities for most of my life
among
&gt;&gt; these very people.

&gt; I volunteer among the poor and know what I am talking
about. My kids have
&gt; done church work in the inner cities so they know as well.
I remember

toys as their

gaudy jewelry, big

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; cost of living (like the increases our dear Congressmen

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; And if minimum wage were increasing at the same rate as corporate

&gt;&gt;&gt; The real problem (as I see it) is that somehow we have
&gt;&gt; gotten away from the
&gt;&gt;&gt; idea that taxes are simply the means to pay for
&gt;&gt; government. Some people use
&gt;&gt;&gt; them to &quot;limit greed&quot;, others to punish too much
success,
&gt;&gt; others to help
&gt;&gt;&gt; some and hurt others depending on who and what you
are. I
&gt;&gt; don't blame the
&gt;&gt;&gt; Enron executives for trying what they did,

&gt;&gt; Really....

&gt;&gt;&gt; our tax laws punish some
&gt;&gt;&gt; companies and reward others and the tax laws have been
&gt;&gt; crafted in such a way
&gt;&gt;&gt; that companies are looking for ways to reduce their
tax
&gt;&gt; bite. The tax code
&gt;&gt;&gt; is THOUSANDS of pages long and treats some entities
&gt;&gt; differently than others.
&gt;&gt;&gt; The loopholes are there and companies pay thousands of
&gt;&gt; lawyers and
&gt;&gt;&gt; accountants to find them. Did they go too far? Yes.
But
&gt;&gt; even Congress and
&gt;&gt;&gt; the IRS have spent months trying to figure out what
they

&gt;&gt;&gt; done. The way to stop it is to simplify it so that
there
&gt;&gt; is no question,
&gt;&gt;&gt; there is no wiggle room, there are no loopholes.

&gt;&gt; Agreed. I actually support a flat tax on gross profits.

&gt; I wouldn't tax profits, I would tax retained earnings. You
want companies to
&gt; spend virtually everything that they bring in, whether for
salaries,
&gt; equipment, property, R&amp;D, dividends, etc. Put the money
back into the
&gt; economy. Make the companies return their profits to the
owners as dividends
&gt; (tax THOSE as income) and if they keep anything as

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; that at 50%.

"/> That would be nice except for the fact that they seem to
stuff it with their buddy's and family's pockets by making

&gt;&gt;&gt; Each company or business

&gt;&gt;&gt; Eliminate the taxable cap on cash salaries/bonuses,
let

&gt;&gt; Most of this I don't have a gripe with.... except I'm

Billion in any year, yet he's worth $45 Billion and he's given away another
$25 Billion to charity. Is $45 Billion too much money for 1 person? I don't
know and I don't pretend to know, but virtually all of his money is
represented by his fractional ownership of one company. In his mind
Microsoft is as much him as a mom and pop drug store is to its owners on
Main Street USA. Would you make them give up part of their drugstore if it
got &quot;too big&quot; and who's to decide when it's too big? Gates is worth that
much because he had a dream and an idea and he acted on it. Over time he
convinced others to join him and today Microsoft employs 50,000 people and
not only is Gates worth Billions he's made at least that much for other
Microsoft employees.
While you want to characterize the poor as hardworking and underpaid, you
can find those examples, you can also find a lot of lazy ones. You can find
poor people that dropped out of school for a variety of reasons, you can
find them having done drugs, you can find them in bars, you can find them on
street corners, you can find people that actually settled for poverty. There
are simply people that made bad decisions on what to do with their lives. As
an example - my sister had an opportunity to go to college but she was
making a &quot;lot&quot; of money in high school as a Pizza Hut assistant manager. She
didn't want to study or go to school anymore, so she settled...... she
eventually left because her wages and bonuses were only going up marginally
over the 10 years that she worked there, she was greatly limited by the
choices that she made.

wages&quot;. The only income imbalance is in people's heads. It doesn't take one
dollar out of your paycheck if your CEO is making $100,000 or $100,000,000.
The American economy isn't a zero-sum game that has a fixed amount of money
to be divided among all of the players so that the players that get more are
taking money away from others. Each of you are being paid on a scale that
represents your experience, education, worth to the organization, and the
costs of replacing you should you leave. If you are making minimum wage it
means that you have reached an educational and skill level that means that
you could be replaced by virtually anyone in the country. To make more, you
have to do more, be more effective, more efficient, more productive than the
others competing for your job. As a CEO you have reached a level that
recognizes that your decisions can affect the lives of thousands of
stockholders, employees, suppliers, and customers. A CEO isn't afraid to
make a decision, that decision may cost someone their job and at the same
time save 5000 others, it may launch a new product that will save the
company or allow it to continue or it may doom it to fail. There are
significant implications to their actions.

willing to make that call for someone that is making that. SOMEONE (their
employer) believes that they are worth it and that's why they are being paid
that amount. If the individual feels differently, they are free to do
whatever they want with the &quot;excess&quot; money. That $2 Billion would be
reinvested into the economy, either as spending, investment, or savings -
allowing someone else to dream, to create, and to try to reach wherever they
are going to go. Thy might not need it to live, but the argument could be
made that a single person making $50,000 doesn't need that much to live.

When, in fact, billions of people have done nothing &quot;wrong&quot;
and are still poor. Some children pop out of the womb poor.

&gt; an example - my sister had an opportunity to go to college
but she was

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; didn't want to study or go to school anymore, so she
settled...... she
&gt; eventually left because her wages and bonuses were only
going up marginally
&gt; over the 10 years that she worked there, she was greatly
limited by the
&gt; choices that she made.

"/> Oh, shit, not this tired old argument again.... look, not
everyone had the opportunity to make a choice like your
sister. Perhaps your sister had parents willing to support
her throughout college, others don't. Perhaps your sister
had the ability for college, others don't. Perhaps your
sister simply didn't want to learn what college had to
offer.

So... did she work any less than you being a Pizza Hut
manager? I doubt it.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I would have a problem with someone doing that at
lower
&gt;&gt;&gt; income levels and as I have a problem with that I have
the
&gt;&gt;&gt; same problem for someone at the other end.

&gt;&gt; Not I. If we have a minimum wage, why not a maximum.
Just my
&gt;&gt; opinion, but... hey, there are others ways to resolve
the
&gt;&gt; income imbalance in this country that don't involve
setting
&gt;&gt; a maximum wage. I haven't excluded those possibilities
from
&gt;&gt; my thinking.

&gt; See, I'm not a fan of minimum wage, nor am I a fan of
so-called &quot;living
&gt; wages&quot;. The only income imbalance is in people's heads. It
doesn't take one
&gt; dollar out of your paycheck if your CEO is making $100,000

It doesn't? Boy... are you living in some kind of alternate
universe.
