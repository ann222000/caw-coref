Retailers Forced to Follow Wal-Mart
Unionized Stores Struggle to Keep Up, Cut Prices

By Greg Schneider and Dina ElBoghdady

Thursday, November 6, 2003; Page A01

MORGANTOWN, W.Va. -- As a young man, Roy Bukrim found a job that
seemed better than working in dangerous coal mines like his relatives:
He hired on at the Kroger supermarket, where 27 years later he's head
night stocker and supports a wife, two kids and a mortgage.

But Bukrim, 48, figures he wouldn't have that career option today.
Young people who hire on now get minimum wage and no health benefits,
then leave after a few months. Bukrim said the future that he saw in
grocery work no longer exists. &quot;We've been the generation where that's
all changed.&quot;

To Bukrim and other workers -- as well as Kroger Co. executives -- the
juggernaut driving that change is the store's most-feared competitor,
Wal-Mart Stores Inc.

&quot;All we've heard is Wal-Mart this and Wal-Mart that,&quot; said Kroger
cashier Victoria Marano. &quot;They want to be like Wal-Mart so they can
compete.&quot;

Wal-Mart, the world's biggest retailer and the nation's biggest
private employer, has become so powerful that its practices
reverberate throughout the U.S. economy. About as many people work for
Wal-Mart -- 1.3 million -- as serve active duty in the U.S. military.
Its most recent annual sales -- $245 billion -- are greater than the
gross domestic product of Switzerland. It's no wonder the company has
more than 3,000 stores in the United States; on Oct. 29 alone Wal-Mart
opened 39 stores, and it once opened 47 in a day.

Because it wields enormous buying power, Wal-Mart influences the
makers of virtually all household products, dictating everything from
pricing to packaging. What's more, Wal-Mart's mania for selling goods
at rock-bottom prices has trained consumers to expect deep discounts
everywhere they shop, forcing competing retailers to follow suit or
fall behind.

The Oct. 23 arrest of 250 illegal aliens working for outside cleaning
crews at 61 Wal-Mart stores nationwide underscores another aspect of
Wal-Mart's low-price formula: a fervent effort to hold down labor
costs. This week the retailer said it has received a &quot;target letter&quot;
from a federal grand jury in Pennsylvania, signifying that Wal-Mart
itself is under investigation for its role in using illegal workers.

Part of the reason the chain is able to offer a microwave oven for
under $30 or a 24-can package of Sam's Choice cola for $3.64 or a
gas-powered lawn mower for under $150, for instance, is because it
contracts with outside janitorial services -- some of which have
questionable hiring practices -- and relies heavily on lower-paid
part-time workers, say unions and competitors.

Wal-Mart's vast, non-unionized work force earns a typical wage of
about $7 to $8 an hour. Unionized workers at Kroger, by contrast, said
they were making between $11 and $13 an hour, with full health
benefits. About 62 percent of Wal-Mart workers are eligible for
benefits, but less than half of the workforce participates. Critics
say the low participation is because Wal-Mart requires steep employee
contributions.

As other retailers follow Wal-Mart's lead, workers without technical
training are feeling a tightening squeeze. Low-skilled manufacturing
jobs are vanishing at historic rates -- West Virginia's coalfield
employment, for instance, plummeted from 59,700 jobs in 1980 to 15,700
in 2000. Untrained people entering today's workforce the way Bukrim
did three decades ago have dwindling odds of reaching the middle
class.

&quot;These are jobs that have historically yielded a middle-class
lifestyle. But with a much more lean and mean approach to services,
many of those jobs are going by the wayside,&quot; said Jared Bernstein, an
economist with the Economic Policy Institute.

Nowhere is that shift more evident than at supermarkets, such as
Kroger, which have seen Wal-Mart rocket to the top of their industry
in only 10 years. Bukrim and 70,000 other unionized workers at the
Kroger, Safeway and Albertsons chains in several states -- including
West Virginia, California and Kentucky -- are now on strike or locked
out in a conflict over wage and benefits changes their employers say
are necessary to compete with Wal-Mart.

Some economists argue that the Wal-Martization of the American
workforce is simply the free-market system functioning as it should.
Gary Stibel, founder and principal of the New England Consulting
Group, said Wal-Mart has saved consumers more than $20 billion through
its discount pricing. Figuring in Wal-Mart's pressure on other
retailers to lower prices, savings top $100 billion, he said.

&quot;In this day and age, the United States needs more companies like
Wal-Mart to create jobs, even if not at the highest pay,&quot; Stibel said.
&quot;The company that makes its mark by taking the cost of manufacturing
products and services up will lose, and the country that promotes that
will lose.&quot;

Wal-Mart morphed from a single store in Rogers, Ark., in 1962 into a
retail powerhouse by mastering the art of low pricing in a way that
has transformed its competitors, its suppliers and the industries it
now dominates -- including groceries, toys and apparel.

Founder Sam Walton pioneered the &quot;supercenter&quot; retail phenomenon. His
use of technology such as bar code price scanners and his reinvention
of the supply chain, with stores reordering stock only as needed
instead of keeping mountains of goods in warehouses, changed the way
businesses interact with one another and their customers.

Walton's method of expanding his chain was unique, too. The company
emerged from what one analyst called &quot;one of the most backward areas
of America&quot; and spread through the rural South by hiring people who
were accustomed to farm work. Wal-Mart inspired fervent loyalty from
customers by putting its stores in regions other retailers had
ignored.

But it also drew condemnation for squashing smaller businesses in its
path. Small-town business districts tended to empty out when Wal-Mart
hit. Some areas responded by drafting anti-Wal-Mart zoning ordinances
that keep out retailers of a certain size.

Today, &quot;Wal-Mart creates its own weather,&quot; said John A. Challenger,
chief executive of Challenger, Gray &amp; Christmas Inc., a Chicago
outplacement firm that tracks retail jobs. &quot;It sets the standards in
many ways for retailers throughout the country, which benchmark
against them.&quot;

Kmart Corp., which dwarfed Wal-Mart only 15 years ago, filed for
bankruptcy protection in 2002 and eliminated 57,000 positions in part
because it tried to compete with Wal-Mart on prices and failed. FAO
Inc., the iconic toy seller, filed for protection from its creditors
in part because it did not try to compete with Wal-Mart on prices.
Both retailers have since emerged from bankruptcy proceedings. And
since Wal-Mart began aggressively expanding into groceries in the past
decade, some national supermarket chains have gone bankrupt.

Wal-Mart's pressure to hold down labor costs also helps fuel the
national market for undocumented workers, immigrant advocates say, as
employers take advantage of laborers who are too fearful of being
deported to object to substandard wages and conditions. Rather than
hire illegal immigrants themselves, big chains typically turn a task
such as janitorial services over to a low-bidding national contractor,
which in turn farms the work out to smaller subcontractors. The
subcontractors range from established firms that rigorously check
workers' immigration status to one-man, fly-by-night operations that
knowingly employ illegal workers, labor experts say.

Undocumented workers learn of the companies through word of mouth,
foreign-language newspaper advertisements and Web sites. It was a
Russian hostel owner in Brooklyn, for example, who directed
24-year-old Russian immigrant Misha Firer to a small company that
cleaned a Wal-Mart in Pennsylvania. For two months, the undocumented
worker lived in a trailer park and buffed the store's floors from
midnight to 8 a.m. for $6 an hour -- $1 of which was seized by his
boss, Firer said.

Even though Wal-Mart's roots are outside of food retailing, it's
within the food sector that the non-unionized retailer is most
affecting labor relations in this country, said Ira Kalish, a global
director at Deloitte Research.

&quot;The impact in terms of wage pressures is really in the supermarket
industry because that's the one part of retailing that's heavily
unionized,&quot; Kalish said. &quot;Most others are not. For [a fashion retailer
such as] the Gap, for instance, the issue is not so much labor costs
as supply-chain efficiency, sourcing and rent.&quot;

But for supermarkets, which operate on razor-thin profit margins,
labor is perhaps the highest cost of doing business, said Michael J.
Silverstein, a senior vice president at Boston Consulting Group.

&quot;The less you pay [for labor], the lower your prices can be,&quot;
Silverstein said. &quot;The grocery store is a war zone, and the weak are
going down fast -- and with them go a lot of jobs.&quot;

Wal-Mart's supercenters have labor costs roughly 20 to 30 percent
lower than those of unionized supermarkets, according to a study from
consulting firm Retail Forward. As a result, groceries at Wal-Mart
cost about 15 percent less than the competition, the study said.

Retail Forward concluded that for every Wal-Mart Supercenter that
opens in the next five years, two supermarkets will close their doors.
That means the supermarket industry could lose 2,000 more stores over
the next five years, or 400 a year.

&quot;It's unlikely that any other U.S. food retailer will catch up to
Wal-Mart, even through a mega-merger,&quot; the report said. By 2007, the
chain should capture 35 percent of supermarket industry sales and
double the number of its supercenters to 2,250.

Wal-Mart is applying the same heavy pressure on grocery suppliers that
it exerts on makers of other consumer goods, leaving them beholden to
the retailing giant for a ...

"/> I was discusssing this issue with my in-law on Tuesday and my mom last
nigh. And here's this article. Interesting.

My in-law lives in Corning, NY. Nearby is a FoodMart, one of those
markets that have been around for 20-30 years....small, convenien
location. There was PNC, a smaller store than Safeway but doing OK.
Wegmans is their high end large supermarket with lots of gourmet foods as
well your regular goods. And in came Walmart superstore. Corning was
booming a couple of years ago and PNC closed their store and moved to a
new center where lots of new houses were being built. Then Corning plants
started laying off folks and houses were foreclosed and the people didn't
move in where the PNC was. So it is now closed do to a bad business
decision. The FoodMart can't compete on Walmart prices....they always
were a bit higher than eveyone else. Now my in-law says their produce is
sometimes rotten because it doesn't sell since people now shop at Walmart
. She does considers Walmart is a bit sneaky in that when Wegmans runs a
special, let's say hotdogs for 99 cents, Walmart will offer them at 97
cents.

So Walmart is affecting all three types of stores. One is closed. I
doubt the FoodMart will be there in a year or two. The city will then
have 2 food stores to select from; Wegmans and Walmart. Having seen the
effect of Walmarts in other locations, its possible Walmart will close
Wegmans too.

When I mentioned this to my mom, she replied that she never, ever shops at
Walmat and refuses to do so and will continue to do so. She views them
as killers of business.

I refuse to shop at Walmart for a more esoteric reason....they only sell
foreign made, cheaply made goods. I'll pay more for American made goods
whenever possible. I guess you can say I'm too snobby for Walmart. I
like quality in products and quality of life in my town. I view Walmart
as a drain on quality and cheapens the quality of life in my town.

I can understand my in-laws plight. She has 3 kids to feed as well as
herself and husband and saving pennies here and there are necessary. But
I feel sorry for Corning as it looses its past for the bright lights of
the Walmarts presence. I can only hope that when they've lost their past
they all get to sit and complaiin in large checkout lines

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Retailers Forced to Follow Wal-Mart
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Unionized Stores Struggle to Keep Up, Cut Prices

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; By Greg Schneider and Dina ElBoghdady
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Washington Post Staff Writers
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Thursday, November 6, 2003; Page A01

&gt;&gt;&gt; [chop]

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Some economists argue that the Wal-Martization of the American
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; workforce is simply the free-market system functioning as it
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; should. Gary Stibel, founder and principal of the New England
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Consulting Group, said Wal-Mart has saved consumers more than $20
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; billion through its discount pricing. Figuring in Wal-Mart's
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; pressure on other retailers to lower prices, savings top $100
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; billion, he said.

&gt;&gt;&gt; So WalMart saved consumers $20 billion did it? Let's take a closer
&gt;&gt;&gt; look at that, shall we? A million of those consumers are WalMart
&gt;&gt;&gt; employees making $3000 to $10000 less per year for the last decade
&gt;&gt;&gt; than they would have made working for another retailer. That's
&gt;&gt;&gt; somewhere upwards of $30 billion. Sounds like there may be
&gt;&gt;&gt; bargains for some consumers, but in the aggregate, a net loss. I
&gt;&gt;&gt; wonder who pockets the difference.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;In this day and age, the United States needs more companies like
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Wal-Mart to create jobs, even if not at the highest pay,&quot; Stibel
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; said.

&gt;&gt;&gt; In this day and age, the United States needs more companies like
&gt;&gt;&gt; WalMart to get into the consulting business and drive the price of
&gt;&gt;&gt; consultants down to $7 - $9/hour. I wonder if Gary would change
&gt;&gt;&gt; his opinion at all.

&gt;&gt;&gt; [snip]

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Wal-Mart's supercenters have labor costs roughly 20 to 30 percent
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; lower than those of unionized supermarkets, according to a study
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; from consulting firm Retail Forward. As a result, groceries at
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Wal-Mart cost about 15 percent less than the competition, the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; study said.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Retail Forward concluded that for every Wal-Mart Supercenter that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; opens in the next five years, two supermarkets will close their
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; doors. That means the supermarket industry could lose 2,000 more
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; stores over the next five years, or 400 a year.

&gt;&gt;&gt; You see, contrary to Gary Stibel's implication, WalMart doesn't
&gt;&gt;&gt; really create jobs; at best it moves them around. Subtract the
&gt;&gt;&gt; number of jobs in the two closed supermarkets from the number of
&gt;&gt;&gt; jobs in the shiny new WalMart supercenter. You are going to see
&gt;&gt;&gt; very little change in the total number of jobs and you are
&gt;&gt;&gt; certainly not going to see an increase in total wages, irrespective
&gt;&gt;&gt; of the number of jobs. That's why the supercenter has 20 to 30
&gt;&gt;&gt; percent lower labor cost.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Dag

&gt;&gt; Doing socially responsible business for me means I am not, will not,
&gt;&gt; and have not been a customer of:

&gt;&gt; * Wal-Mart ---- Bush/GOP campaign contributer
&gt;&gt; * Dell Computer ---- Big-time Bush contributer
&gt;&gt; * Dominoes Pizza ---- Rabid contributer to groups opposed to
&gt;&gt; choice
&gt;&gt; for women

&gt; Thanks for the info. I already shop at walmart. They have great stuff
&gt; for cheap and don't suck ass to unions. I can't buy a dell...they just
&gt; suck. Domino's pizza is low quality dog food, so can't do that either.
&gt; damn

"/> Recent immigrant to U.S., are you?

They don't know much U.S. history, you know, and so naturally I figure you
for an immigrant.

But when you learn about the emergence of the middle class in America, and
the opportunity for ordinary Americans to go to a university and not just
the rich and privileged class, you will learn it was the sons and daughters
of the hardworking members of labor union working class that got to go to
the university, the first time people in the family line got to go.

I hope I don't know anyone who is the university-educated child of a
hardworking union member, and who is saying that no one should have to
&quot;suck ass&quot; to unions. I see ungrateful bastards like that, and I want to
give them a good smash to the face.

And it defies logic for someone to say he likes to shop at WalMart, New
Home of Cheap Plastic Shit, and disparage the quality of Dell and Dominoes.

"/> Watch the violence, union guy! I know it is in your blood to smash people,
but we no longer need your thugging ways. My dad was a union man. I good one
too. I got a chance to work at his place of employment for a while to earn
some extra cash. It sucked so bad. It was a printing place. The union people
were totally obnoxious because they knew it was impossible to fire them.
They were assholes to everyone, including other union people. I was new, so
my pay sucked and the old timers sucked up all of the good weekend time and
did the easy jobs. There was no incentive to work hard except that the plant
manager could &quot;break my time&quot; of consecutive days needed to join the union.
I pity my dad for having to put up with so many jerks that the company could
never fire. He really did work hard and I respect his career. As for me, I
did the shit jobs for a while but moved to the pressroom because they made
more money and needed literate people. They were a skilled bunch and worked
hard. Not a bad union place. I think unions work much better in a skilled
profession. Lower jobs just don't need unions and it hurts everyone. That is
what I am talking about too. Union jobs for grocery store baggers or shelf
stockers is just a joke. Factories that pay some hack $25 to push a broom?
That sounds like a good reason to move out of the state or country to me.
If I were a business owner, I would be ok if the union help was skilled and
really got the job done. If I had to pay big $$ and bennies for a broom
pusher, I would fight it hard.
Also, I was talking to a good friend that got out of the plant management
thing and sells binders now. He sees every kind of printing operation in the
world and says that the rural, non-union places pay workers well and
everyone likes it. It is a joy to work with good people. The non union
places can pick the best workers and let the bad ones go. Basically, I
believe that people with real motivation are hindered by unions.

Walmart carries lots of name brand stuff. Nobody goes there for nice clothes

PC. Dominos is terrible pizza. I prefer Papa Johns if I must buy delivery.
Even better, get a Panteras(St. Louis only, I think) or Imos.

Yes, you really have to watch what is an opinion piece and what is
news. Not unusual anymore for most sources of information.

&gt;You've noticed that, too? I have taken Forbes and BusinessWeek for over 20
&gt;years. Forbes keeps the editorials on the editorial page and by the columnists.
&gt;BWeek lets their editorial position influence their stories a lot more.

"/> Agreed. I got sick of BW leaking liberal bias into all of their
stories. I wondered why and the answer must be school books. McGraw
Hill sells a lot of schools books and they probably like to keep the
teachers unions happy.

Also there Standard &amp; Poors unit does bond ratings. The more money
pols spend (democrats), the more bonds they issue and the more bonds
need to be rated.

BW level of business writing is not up to Forbes. My only gripe with
Forbes is they went dot com mental during the dot bomb scam. Their
young Rich Kalgaard who is publisher is buddies with the SillyCon
Valley venture capital crowd. He sucks and a writer and is a terrible
stock picker. He admitted that he owned tons of tech before the
crash.

"/>  How about for the Federal government (although their bonds less need a
rating) in the past 2 decades was more in deficit under Republican
presidents and had surpluses only in fiscal years that started with a
Democrat in the White House?

I am a taxpayer who dreads interest payments on the national debt!
