I've just been rewatching all the HP movies. Here's an assessment of
the trio:

(i) Radcliffe: Began a little shakily with PS, but has grown in
stature and confidence since then. I like his sense of calm, and he
has a certain reserve in his acting. That suits his character well -
because Harry Potter is a natural leader, and a good leader has to
have a higher level of maturity than those he leads and the ability to
remain calm in the face of adversity. Radcliffe gives the character of
Harry that sense of poise.

(ii) Grint: I thought Grint was okay in PS, but then, his performance
took a nosedive in CoS - he just mugged his way all through the movie.
That was a one note performance that got old really quick for me. He
has improved since then, however, and he was okay in PoA and gave a
pretty good account of himself in GoF. I think the Ron of the books is
a little more tentative than the Ron of GoF and especially OoTP, but
this may well be due to screenplay and screen time limitations for the
character. The character of Ron is an especially challenging one - he
is not as heroic as Harry, but he is not a wimp either. He is in a
grey zone where he is meek and timid, and incapable of standing up to
Harry the way Hermione can, and also has a strong inferiority
complex,  while at the same time being fiercely loyal and capable of
putting his life on the line for his friends, as he does on several
occasions all through the series. It's not easy to play such a
character and show all his shades - and perhaps it would be harsh to
blame Grint for the slight disappointment I feel at the way Ron has
been portrayed and played so far in the series.

(iii) Watson: This is the one role that I have real issues with. I
think both Radcliffe and Grint were a little slow off the blocks, but
have grown into their roles as the series has progressed. Emma Watson,
on the other hand, has gone the other way. I thought she nailed the
character of Hermione in PS and CoS - she was perky, a little bossy
and had a certain know-it-all eagerness about her which was fun to
watch and which added a lot to all of her scenes with Radcliffe and
Grint. But something has happened to her since then. She has looked
too ... high strung in the subsequent movies. Whenever I saw her on
screen in the OoTP, for instance, I felt like injecting a dose of
sedative into her to get her to breathe and relax a little bit. Take
the post-Harry-kissing-Cho scene for example: Harry, Hermione and Ron
are sitting in the Gryffindor common room and discussing the event.
This is supposed to be a light scene, and we are supposed to feel warm
and happy for Harry. Grint and Radcliffe look relaxed and cheerful,
but Watson looks almost mortified - as if she is going to break into
tears or something any moment. Hermione has that lovely line in this
scene: &quot;just because you have the emotional range of a teaspoon ...&quot;
directed at Ron, and when Watson delivers that line, it comes out all
wrong. I think Watson has become a distinct liability in the series,
and I wouldn't mind too much if she got replaced in HBP. HBP is the
one book where the character of Hermione has to show some range -
jealousy at Ron, a little streak of meanness, a mature sisterliness
toward Ginny and Harry, and also embarrassment at the end when she
realizes that Harry was right all along about Malfoy being upto
something. I just don't think Emma Watson is going to be able to
portray all of that in the movie - she seems to have the &quot;emotional
range of a teaspoon&quot; as Hermione in the series.

Bad acting or not, million have developed a &quot;mental image&quot; of Harry,
Hermione and ron of the movies and it would upset too many people's
expectation to bring in a totally new face for such a central character
now.

I still remember the fuss that folks raised when Richard Harris expired
and had to be replaced. Many people purposely heaped flak on Gambon
just because their &quot;image&quot; of Dumbledore was disturbed, and this was
only two films into the series.

On the contrary I suspect that WB have done a lot of &quot;behind-the-scenes&quot;
persuasion with Watson to get her to agree to the last two films;
remember she wasn't too keen on doing them.

Look, all the actors portraying the Trio are so far below standards

insignificant and the best thing, I think, that WB can do for this
series is to take it through to the end without any major upsets and
goofups.

Hopefully a second series someone decides to do (and hopefully, this

I'll disagree (since that is what newsgroups are for).

I think the problem is the writing rather than the actors. And I think
that is the result of slavishly trying to put a six-hundred page novel
into two hours of film.  Now that the novels are finished I think it is
time to finish the films on their own instead of trying to put the
novels on film. I thought the last film was particularly weak, with a
couple of confusing cuts. Twice Harry goes to sleep writhing in
nightmare and we cut to another scene which I assumed was a dream. But
it wasn't. It was another day.

The last novel was particularly poor, so I think the filmmakers should
just go their own way - sticking to the plot of course, but changing
emphases. The third of the book with Harry, Ron and Hermione in a tent
should be cut to a few scenes, and the definitive war at the end should
be expanded a lot. We have spent seven novels getting to know dozens of
characters. We need to know what happens to each of them. They might
even revise who actually gets killed.

Perhaps you aren't aware that all the movies have been shot many
thousands of miles away from Hollywood.  This makes me doubt the
opinions you express.  Assessing the acting of children is rather
difficult, especially since the director is responsible for HOW a
character is portrayed as much as is the writer, or the actor.  Given
that, I don't see how reasonable people can expect children 11-15 to
have the range, and depth, or ability, and experience of an adult who
has been in the business for 30 years.  I think Emma Watson was badly
miscast, and that makes her job rather difficult.  Gambon, on the other
hand has none of these critical 'protections', except for the lack of
understanding of the character of directors of the last 3 movies.  It
really should be required that the director READ THE BOOKS.  Where the
Gambon portrayal of Dumbledore came from is a mystery to me, as it
certainly is NOT the Dumbledore in the books.

off), and &quot;Patriot Games&quot; in which characters were changed, and the
whole ending was totally rewritten, ending up with a vastly different
world-view for the main character, DID result in legal action, and
Clancy refusing to sell any more books to movie companies without
'creative control' of the film (which he should have insisted on in the
first place, as Rowling did).

I find this messing with the original story totally unacceptable.

Nope, I didn't compare Radcliffe, Watson or Grnt with any of the adult
actors. Even for the standards of child actors (and they are not

rather poor, particularly the two guys.

Miscast? I think she's quite suited to her role. If she was miscast for

It makes me cry the way Agatha Christie is always butchered in movies

&gt;&gt; OotP would have hardly changed if he had not been there at all.
&gt;&gt; Something changed in (PoA)...

&gt;&gt; &lt;snip about portraying &quot;ron&quot;&gt;

&gt;&gt; I disagree. ron, IMO, is the easiest of the Trio to portray. All you
&gt;&gt; have to do is bicker and be a jerk all the time, and that is when your
&gt;&gt; mouth is not stuffed full with food.

&gt;&gt;&gt; (iii) Watson: This is the one role that I have real issues with. I
&gt;&gt;&gt; think both Radcliffe and Grint were a little slow off the blocks,

&gt;&gt; Little slow? They are still crawling.

&gt;&gt;&gt; but
&gt;&gt;&gt; have grown into their roles as the series has progressed. Emma Watson,
&gt;&gt;&gt; on the other hand, has gone the other way.

&gt;&gt; Again I disagree. She has undoubtedly portrayed her character by far the
&gt;&gt; best, among the three.

&gt;&gt; &lt;snip about Watson's acting&gt;

&gt;&gt;&gt; I think Watson has become a distinct liability in the series,
&gt;&gt;&gt; and I wouldn't mind too much if she got replaced in HBP.

&gt;&gt; Besides the fact that if Watson is bad to be replaced then Radcliffe and
&gt;&gt; Grint would have to leave miles before her, it is too late now to
&gt;&gt; sensibly do anything of that sort, unless the actor herself declines.

&gt;&gt; Bad acting or not, million have developed a &quot;mental image&quot; of Harry,
&gt;&gt; Hermione and ron of the movies and it would upset too many people's
&gt;&gt; expectation to bring in a totally new face for such a central character
&gt;&gt; now.

&gt;&gt; I still remember the fuss that folks raised when Richard Harris expired
&gt;&gt; and had to be replaced. Many people purposely heaped flak on Gambon
&gt;&gt; just because their &quot;image&quot; of Dumbledore was disturbed, and this was
&gt;&gt; only two films into the series.

&gt;&gt; On the contrary I suspect that WB have done a lot of &quot;behind-the-scenes&quot;
&gt;&gt; persuasion with Watson to get her to agree to the last two films;
&gt;&gt; remember she wasn't too keen on doing them.

&gt;&gt;&gt; HBP is the
&gt;&gt;&gt; one book where the character of Hermione has to show some range -

&gt;&gt; Range? HBP is one book where Rowling strips Hermione of all emotional
&gt;&gt; range and maturity and has her act like a spoilt, small girl.

&gt;&gt;&gt; jealousy at Ron, a little streak of meanness, a mature sisterliness
&gt;&gt;&gt; toward Ginny and Harry, and also embarrassment at the end when she
&gt;&gt;&gt; realizes that Harry was right all along about Malfoy being upto
&gt;&gt;&gt; something. I just don't think Emma Watson is going to be able to
&gt;&gt;&gt; portray all of that in the movie - she seems to have the &quot;emotional
&gt;&gt;&gt; range of a teaspoon&quot; as Hermione in the series.

&gt;&gt; Look, all the actors portraying the Trio are so far below standards
&gt;&gt; (mine anyway) that their relative difference would be totally
&gt;&gt; insignificant and the best thing, I think, that WB can do for this
&gt;&gt; series is to take it through to the end without any major upsets and
&gt;&gt; goofups.

&gt;&gt; Hopefully a second series someone decides to do (and hopefully, this
&gt;&gt; time, it would be in Europe instead of Hollywood), should be watchable.

&gt;Perhaps you aren't aware that all the movies have been shot many
&gt;thousands of miles away from Hollywood.  This makes me doubt the
&gt;opinions you express.  Assessing the acting of children is rather
&gt;difficult, especially since the director is responsible for HOW a
&gt;character is portrayed as much as is the writer, or the actor.  Given
&gt;that, I don't see how reasonable people can expect children 11-15 to
&gt;have the range, and depth, or ability, and experience of an adult who
&gt;has been in the business for 30 years.  I think Emma Watson was badly
&gt;miscast, and that makes her job rather difficult.  Gambon, on the other
&gt;hand has none of these critical 'protections', except for the lack of
&gt;understanding of the character of directors of the last 3 movies.  It
&gt;really should be required that the director READ THE BOOKS.  Where the
&gt;Gambon portrayal of Dumbledore came from is a mystery to me, as it
&gt;certainly is NOT the Dumbledore in the books.
">

I agree about reading the books. That knot in his beard (although it was
probably not his decision) makes him look gay, which is certainly not
canon. He is, however, much more vital than Harris was which is
absolustely necessary for Movies 5 + 6.

Back to the subject, I also agree about direction. Still, I have always
found that Rupert is the only one who always has the most appropriate
facial expression for a scene. I call that acting. He is no Marcel
Marceau, but his use of mimical musculature is always spot on... and he
is the only one who doesn't react to the punch-line before it is given.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I'll disagree (since that is what newsgroups are for).

&gt;&gt;&gt; I think the problem is the writing rather than the actors. And I think
&gt;&gt;&gt; that is the result of slavishly trying to put a six-hundred page novel
&gt;&gt;&gt; into two hours of film.  Now that the novels are finished I think it is
&gt;&gt;&gt; time to finish the films on their own instead of trying to put the
&gt;&gt;&gt; novels on film. I thought the last film was particularly weak, with a
&gt;&gt;&gt; couple of confusing cuts. Twice Harry goes to sleep writhing in
&gt;&gt;&gt; nightmare and we cut to another scene which I assumed was a dream. But
&gt;&gt;&gt; it wasn't. It was another day.

&gt;&gt;&gt; The last novel was particularly poor, so I think the filmmakers should
&gt;&gt;&gt; just go their own way - sticking to the plot of course, but changing
&gt;&gt;&gt; emphases. The third of the book with Harry, Ron and Hermione in a tent
&gt;&gt;&gt; should be cut to a few scenes, and the definitive war at the end should
&gt;&gt;&gt; be expanded a lot. We have spent seven novels getting to know dozens of
&gt;&gt;&gt; characters. We need to know what happens to each of them. They might
&gt;&gt;&gt; even revise who actually gets killed.

&gt;&gt; I totally disagree with the idea of a movie departing from the plot of a
&gt;&gt; book,

&gt; I take it you mean substantially departing the plot  Some
&gt; modifications are unavoidable for a number of reasons, including keep
&gt; the movie under two and a half hours.

&gt;&gt; and to change who gets killed is an insult to the original writer,
&gt;&gt; and should be grounds of multi-million dollar lawsuits.  Things like the
&gt;&gt; mutilation of a good book in the case of the movie versions of Clancy's
&gt;&gt; &quot;Clear and Present Danger&quot; (wherein a continuing character was killed
&gt;&gt; off), and &quot;Patriot Games&quot; in which characters were changed, and the
&gt;&gt; whole ending was totally rewritten, ending up with a vastly different
&gt;&gt; world-view for the main character, DID result in legal action, and
&gt;&gt; Clancy refusing to sell any more books to movie companies without
&gt;&gt; 'creative control' of the film (which he should have insisted on in the
&gt;&gt; first place, as Rowling did).

&gt;&gt; I find this messing with the original story totally unacceptable.

&gt; Not to mention usually unnecessary and often downright
&gt; counterproductive.

&gt; It makes me cry the way Agatha Christie is always butchered in movies
&gt; and on TV when her books would practically write their own screenplay
&gt; if the screenwriters would just follow them.
">

Movie makers are so well known for butchering the story, characters, and
'essence' of books that many authors simply refuse to allow their books
to be so mutilated, whatever the outrageous amount of money they are
offered.
Authors like Isaac Azimov pretty much eschewed the movie medium after
some really ugly experiences, as did R. A. Heinlein, in spite of the
fact that many of his stories would have made excellent movies.  One
look at the Starship Troopers movie should tell you why.

&gt; Yes, but even conceeding that their script and settings were not the

&gt; Nope, I didn't compare Radcliffe, Watson or Grnt with any of the adult
&gt; actors. Even for the standards of child actors (and they are not
&gt; quite &quot;children&quot; any longer, at least not since GoF), they have been
&gt; rather poor, particularly the two guys.

None.  She is a rather pretty girl, with nice hair.  Not at ALL how
Hermione was described.
She has managed to play the 'annoying know-it-all' part fairly well, but
she is no better suited to the role than casting a beardless, young man
would have been suited to Dumbledore's role.
My vote for best casting of characters is Snape, and Minerva.  Ginny is
fair, for what role they have given her in the movies, which is mostly
'background'.

I would have LOVED to see Connery in the part.  Not only does he have
the charisma, but his acting ability would make him perfect in the role.
He is a very versatile actor, and I suspect the younger actors would
greatly benefit from working with him.

I adore Alan Rickman as Snape but Snape, Black and Lupin are only in

&gt; I've just been rewatching all the HP movies. Here's an assessment of
&gt; the trio:

&gt; (i) Radcliffe: Began a little shakily with PS, but has grown in
&gt; stature and confidence since then. I like his sense of calm, and he
&gt; has a certain reserve in his acting. That suits his character well -
&gt; because Harry Potter is a natural leader, and a good leader has to
&gt; have a higher level of maturity than those he leads and the ability to
&gt; remain calm in the face of adversity. Radcliffe gives the character of
&gt; Harry that sense of poise.

I felt he really came into his own in GOF, prior to that he was fairly
average.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; (ii) Grint: I thought Grint was okay in PS, but then, his performance
&gt; took a nosedive in CoS - he just mugged his way all through the movie.
&gt; That was a one note performance that got old really quick for me. He
&gt; has improved since then, however, and he was okay in PoA and gave a
&gt; pretty good account of himself in GoF. I think the Ron of the books is
&gt; a little more tentative than the Ron of GoF and especially OoTP, but
&gt; this may well be due to screenplay and screen time limitations for the
&gt; character. The character of Ron is an especially challenging one - he
&gt; is not as heroic as Harry, but he is not a wimp either. He is in a
&gt; grey zone where he is meek and timid, and incapable of standing up to
&gt; Harry the way Hermione can, and also has a strong inferiority
&gt; complex,  while at the same time being fiercely loyal and capable of
&gt; putting his life on the line for his friends, as he does on several
&gt; occasions all through the series. It's not easy to play such a
&gt; character and show all his shades - and perhaps it would be harsh to
&gt; blame Grint for the slight disappointment I feel at the way Ron has
&gt; been portrayed and played so far in the series.
">

I think he's the most capable actor of the three but had some really poor
material to work with, especially in COS and POA.  He started to come alive
as Ron in GOF and I'm really looking forward to his performances in the last
two movies.  A friend of mine on the COS board recently noted that in the
books his character's inferiority complex really didn't become apparent till
the big fight in GOF and this makes me wonder if the filmmakers will attempt
to show this in the last two films.

&gt; and had a certain know-it-all eagerness about her which was fun to
&gt; watch and which added a lot to all of her scenes with Radcliffe and
&gt; Grint. But something has happened to her since then. She has looked
&gt; too ... high strung in the subsequent movies. Whenever I saw her on
&gt; screen in the OoTP, for instance, I felt like injecting a dose of
&gt; sedative into her to get her to breathe and relax a little bit. Take
&gt; the post-Harry-kissing-Cho scene for example: Harry, Hermione and Ron
&gt; are sitting in the Gryffindor common room and discussing the event.
&gt; This is supposed to be a light scene, and we are supposed to feel warm
&gt; and happy for Harry. Grint and Radcliffe look relaxed and cheerful,
&gt; but Watson looks almost mortified - as if she is going to break into
&gt; tears or something any moment. Hermione has that lovely line in this
&gt; scene: &quot;just because you have the emotional range of a teaspoon ...&quot;
&gt; directed at Ron, and when Watson delivers that line, it comes out all

She did well enough with PS and COS but while the boys grew into their roles
Emma appeared to remain static in her performance.  She was given a central
role in POA, so much so that the film could have been called Hermione
Granger and the Prisoner of Azkaban, but she really didn't deliver and as
the films progressed her acting has become more and more forced.  It's a
pity really as she'd be very good in the role if she just acted as herself.
As it was I think she was woefully mis directed in POA and from that point
has struggled.  It may be that the attention has somewhat gone to her head
or it may simply be that she hasn't had the same level of mentoring as the
boys have.

Personally I feel the biggest issue with the younger cast members including
the trio was poor direction in the pivotal POA film.  This damaged ability
of the films to present a good translation of the books and they've been
having a hard time in GOF and OOTP resurrecting the franchise.  I guess
we'll see where they go to from here.

I think her problem is that she acts as HERSELF and not as HERMIONE. In
a PoA interview, she seemed very happy saying &quot;Hermione is finally
wearing Jeans!&quot;, as though she was hoping the character to be fit to her
own comfort. Nothing wrong with that, but perhaps is a slip that she
wished the character to be more like her rather than she acting the
character as it should be. Dan and Rupert had managed to act their
characters properly, IMO.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Well, I disagree. I don't see any such thing. He seems tentative and
&gt;&gt;&gt; stiff, but you are right. Ill suited to the role he may be, but he has
&gt;&gt;&gt; improved with each film. At this rate, his acting will become tolerable
&gt;&gt;&gt; by the last film.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (ii) Grint:
&gt;&gt;&gt; 'nuff said. My dislike for ron means that I will be _very_ likely to ill
&gt;&gt;&gt; judge the actor portraying him too.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I thought Grint was okay in PS, but then, his performance
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; took a nosedive in CoS - he just mugged his way all through the movie.

&gt;&gt;&gt; IMO, Grint was okay in films one and two, but has bombed out since then.
&gt;&gt;&gt; OotP would have hardly changed if he had not been there at all.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Something changed in (PoA)...

&gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;snip about portraying &quot;ron&quot;&gt;

&gt;&gt;&gt; I disagree. ron, IMO, is the easiest of the Trio to portray. All you
&gt;&gt;&gt; have to do is bicker and be a jerk all the time, and that is when your
&gt;&gt;&gt; mouth is not stuffed full with food.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (iii) Watson: This is the one role that I have real issues with. I
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; think both Radcliffe and Grint were a little slow off the blocks,
&gt;&gt;&gt; Little slow? They are still crawling.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; but
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; have grown into their roles as the series has progressed. Emma Watson,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; on the other hand, has gone the other way.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Again I disagree. She has undoubtedly portrayed her character by far the
&gt;&gt;&gt; best, among the three.

&gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;snip about Watson's acting&gt;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I think Watson has become a distinct liability in the series,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and I wouldn't mind too much if she got replaced in HBP.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Besides the fact that if Watson is bad to be replaced then Radcliffe and
&gt;&gt;&gt; Grint would have to leave miles before her, it is too late now to
&gt;&gt;&gt; sensibly do anything of that sort, unless the actor herself declines.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Bad acting or not, million have developed a &quot;mental image&quot; of Harry,
&gt;&gt;&gt; Hermione and ron of the movies and it would upset too many people's
&gt;&gt;&gt; expectation to bring in a totally new face for such a central character
&gt;&gt;&gt; now.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I still remember the fuss that folks raised when Richard Harris expired
&gt;&gt;&gt; and had to be replaced. Many people purposely heaped flak on Gambon
&gt;&gt;&gt; just because their &quot;image&quot; of Dumbledore was disturbed, and this was
&gt;&gt;&gt; only two films into the series.

&gt;&gt;&gt; On the contrary I suspect that WB have done a lot of &quot;behind-the-scenes&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt; persuasion with Watson to get her to agree to the last two films;
&gt;&gt;&gt; remember she wasn't too keen on doing them.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; HBP is the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; one book where the character of Hermione has to show some range -
&gt;&gt;&gt; Range? HBP is one book where Rowling strips Hermione of all emotional
&gt;&gt;&gt; range and maturity and has her act like a spoilt, small girl.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; jealousy at Ron, a little streak of meanness, a mature sisterliness
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; toward Ginny and Harry, and also embarrassment at the end when she
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; realizes that Harry was right all along about Malfoy being upto
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; something. I just don't think Emma Watson is going to be able to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; portray all of that in the movie - she seems to have the &quot;emotional
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; range of a teaspoon&quot; as Hermione in the series.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Look, all the actors portraying the Trio are so far below standards
&gt;&gt;&gt; (mine anyway) that their relative difference would be totally
&gt;&gt;&gt; insignificant and the best thing, I think, that WB can do for this
&gt;&gt;&gt; series is to take it through to the end without any major upsets and
&gt;&gt;&gt; goofups.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Hopefully a second series someone decides to do (and hopefully, this
&gt;&gt;&gt; time, it would be in Europe instead of Hollywood), should be watchable.

&gt;&gt; Perhaps you aren't aware that all the movies have been shot many
&gt;&gt; thousands of miles away from Hollywood.  This makes me doubt the
&gt;&gt; opinions you express.  Assessing the acting of children is rather
&gt;&gt; difficult, especially since the director is responsible for HOW a
&gt;&gt; character is portrayed as much as is the writer, or the actor.  Given
&gt;&gt; that, I don't see how reasonable people can expect children 11-15 to
&gt;&gt; have the range, and depth, or ability, and experience of an adult who
&gt;&gt; has been in the business for 30 years.  I think Emma Watson was badly
&gt;&gt; miscast, and that makes her job rather difficult.  Gambon, on the other
&gt;&gt; hand has none of these critical 'protections', except for the lack of
&gt;&gt; understanding of the character of directors of the last 3 movies.  It
&gt;&gt; really should be required that the director READ THE BOOKS.  Where the
&gt;&gt; Gambon portrayal of Dumbledore came from is a mystery to me, as it
&gt;&gt; certainly is NOT the Dumbledore in the books.

&gt; I agree about reading the books. That knot in his beard (although it was
&gt; probably not his decision) makes him look gay, which is certainly not
&gt; canon. He is, however, much more vital than Harris was which is
&gt; absolustely necessary for Movies 5 + 6.

I have known quite a few homosexuals, and I have NEVER seen one with a
knot in his beard.  Perhaps you can show me a picture of a homosexual
with a knot in his beard, and explain where this idea developed.

&gt;&gt; My vote for best casting of characters is Snape, and Minerva.  Ginny is

&gt; I adore Alan Rickman as Snape but Snape, Black and Lupin are only in
&gt; their early 30s in PS as far as I remember, and these actors are too
&gt; old.  I can see why they were cast, though.

Using older actors to play roles is quite common.  Look at the actress
who plays &quot;Moaning Myrtle&quot;.  She does a great job, and is MUCH older
than the character.  Of course Richard Harris was a bit 'young' for his
role as Dumbledore, but pulled it off quite well.  Age can be added, or
subtracted, from an actor in the makeup department.  No problem.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You mean, he is as stiff now (no pun intended), as he was then?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; That suits his character well - because Harry Potter is a natural
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; leader, and a good leader has to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; have a higher level of maturity than those he leads and the ability to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; remain calm in the face of adversity. Radcliffe gives the character of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Harry that sense of poise.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Well, I disagree. I don't see any such thing. He seems tentative and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; stiff, but you are right. Ill suited to the role he may be, but he has
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; improved with each film. At this rate, his acting will become tolerable
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; by the last film.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (ii) Grint:
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 'nuff said. My dislike for ron means that I will be _very_ likely to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ill
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; judge the actor portraying him too.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I thought Grint was okay in PS, but then, his performance took a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; nosedive in CoS - he just mugged his way all through the movie.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; That was a one note performance that got old really quick for me. He
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; has improved since then, however, and he was okay in PoA and gave a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; pretty good account of himself in GoF.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; IMO, Grint was okay in films one and two, but has bombed out since
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; then.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; OotP would have hardly changed if he had not been there at all.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Something changed in (PoA)...

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;snip about portraying &quot;ron&quot;&gt;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I disagree. ron, IMO, is the easiest of the Trio to portray. All you
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; have to do is bicker and be a jerk all the time, and that is when your
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; mouth is not stuffed full with food.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (iii) Watson: This is the one role that I have real issues with. I
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; think both Radcliffe and Grint were a little slow off the blocks,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Little slow? They are still crawling.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; but have grown into their roles as the series has progressed. Emma
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Watson,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; on the other hand, has gone the other way.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Again I disagree. She has undoubtedly portrayed her character by far
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; best, among the three.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;snip about Watson's acting&gt;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I think Watson has become a distinct liability in the series,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and I wouldn't mind too much if she got replaced in HBP.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Besides the fact that if Watson is bad to be replaced then Radcliffe
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Grint would have to leave miles before her, it is too late now to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; sensibly do anything of that sort, unless the actor herself declines.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Bad acting or not, million have developed a &quot;mental image&quot; of Harry,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Hermione and ron of the movies and it would upset too many people's
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; expectation to bring in a totally new face for such a central character
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; now.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I still remember the fuss that folks raised when Richard Harris expired
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and had to be replaced. Many people purposely heaped flak on Gambon
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; just because their &quot;image&quot; of Dumbledore was disturbed, and this was
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; only two films into the series.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; On the contrary I suspect that WB have done a lot of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;behind-the-scenes&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; persuasion with Watson to get her to agree to the last two films;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; remember she wasn't too keen on doing them.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; HBP is the one book where the character of Hermione has to show
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; some range -
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Range? HBP is one book where Rowling strips Hermione of all emotional
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; range and maturity and has her act like a spoilt, small girl.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; jealousy at Ron, a little streak of meanness, a mature sisterliness
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; toward Ginny and Harry, and also embarrassment at the end when she
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; realizes that Harry was right all along about Malfoy being upto
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; something. I just don't think Emma Watson is going to be able to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; portray all of that in the movie - she seems to have the &quot;emotional
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; range of a teaspoon&quot; as Hermione in the series.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Look, all the actors portraying the Trio are so far below standards
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (mine anyway) that their relative difference would be totally
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; insignificant and the best thing, I think, that WB can do for this
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; series is to take it through to the end without any major upsets and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; goofups.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Hopefully a second series someone decides to do (and hopefully, this
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; time, it would be in Europe instead of Hollywood), should be watchable.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Perhaps you aren't aware that all the movies have been shot many
&gt;&gt;&gt; thousands of miles away from Hollywood.  This makes me doubt the
&gt;&gt;&gt; opinions you express.  Assessing the acting of children is rather
&gt;&gt;&gt; difficult, especially since the director is responsible for HOW a
&gt;&gt;&gt; character is portrayed as much as is the writer, or the actor.  Given
&gt;&gt;&gt; that, I don't see how reasonable people can expect children 11-15 to
&gt;&gt;&gt; have the range, and depth, or ability, and experience of an adult who
&gt;&gt;&gt; has been in the business for 30 years.  I think Emma Watson was badly
&gt;&gt;&gt; miscast, and that makes her job rather difficult.  Gambon, on the

LOL, I was merely taking a swipe at Jo and have no intention of
fostering further discussion of the subject in this forum. I will merely
note that I have seen it in the Parisian gay scene. As a Texan, you have
probably only known homosex-you-all folks.

BTW, I agree with what you wrote about the lack of denouement in DH. I
suppose JKR is simply too used to leaving her readers with a
cliff-hanger and wants to keep the suspense going for her &quot;encyclopedia&quot;.

Emma Watson went from being the best child actor of the movies to being the

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Little slow? They are still crawling.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; but
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; have grown into their roles as the series has progressed. Emma Watson,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; on the other hand, has gone the other way.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Again I disagree. She has undoubtedly portrayed her character by far the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; best, among the three.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;snip about Watson's acting&gt;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I think Watson has become a distinct liability in the series,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and I wouldn't mind too much if she got replaced in HBP.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Besides the fact that if Watson is bad to be replaced then Radcliffe and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Grint would have to leave miles before her, it is too late now to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; sensibly do anything of that sort, unless the actor herself declines.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Bad acting or not, million have developed a &quot;mental image&quot; of Harry,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Hermione and ron of the movies and it would upset too many people's
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; expectation to bring in a totally new face for such a central character
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; now.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I still remember the fuss that folks raised when Richard Harris expired
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and had to be replaced. Many people purposely heaped flak on Gambon
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; just because their &quot;image&quot; of Dumbledore was disturbed, and this was
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; only two films into the series.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; On the contrary I suspect that WB have done a lot of &quot;behind-the-scenes&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; persuasion with Watson to get her to agree to the last two films;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; remember she wasn't too keen on doing them.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; HBP is the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; one book where the character of Hermione has to show some range -
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Range? HBP is one book where Rowling strips Hermione of all emotional
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; range and maturity and has her act like a spoilt, small girl.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; jealousy at Ron, a little streak of meanness, a mature sisterliness
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; toward Ginny and Harry, and also embarrassment at the end when she
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; realizes that Harry was right all along about Malfoy being upto
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; something. I just don't think Emma Watson is going to be able to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; portray all of that in the movie - she seems to have the &quot;emotional
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; range of a teaspoon&quot; as Hermione in the series.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Look, all the actors portraying the Trio are so far below standards
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (mine anyway) that their relative difference would be totally
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; insignificant and the best thing, I think, that WB can do for this
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; series is to take it through to the end without any major upsets and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; goofups.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Hopefully a second series someone decides to do (and hopefully, this
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; time, it would be in Europe instead of Hollywood), should be watchable.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Perhaps you aren't aware that all the movies have been shot many
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; thousands of miles away from Hollywood.  This makes me doubt the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; opinions you express.  Assessing the acting of children is rather
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; difficult, especially since the director is responsible for HOW a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; character is portrayed as much as is the writer, or the actor.  Given
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that, I don't see how reasonable people can expect children 11-15 to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; have the range, and depth, or ability, and experience of an adult who
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; has been in the business for 30 years.  I think Emma Watson was badly
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; miscast, and that makes her job rather difficult.  Gambon, on the other
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; hand has none of these critical 'protections', except for the lack of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; understanding of the character of directors of the last 3 movies.  It
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; really should be required that the director READ THE BOOKS.  Where the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Gambon portrayal of Dumbledore came from is a mystery to me, as it
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; certainly is NOT the Dumbledore in the books.
&gt;&gt;&gt; I agree about reading the books. That knot in his beard (although it was
&gt;&gt;&gt; probably not his decision) makes him look gay, which is certainly not
&gt;&gt;&gt; canon. He is, however, much more vital than Harris was which is
&gt;&gt;&gt; absolustely necessary for Movies 5 + 6.

&gt;&gt; I have known quite a few homosexuals, and I have NEVER seen one with a
&gt;&gt; knot in his beard.  Perhaps you can show me a picture of a homosexual
&gt;&gt; with a knot in his beard, and explain where this idea developed.

&gt; LOL, I was merely taking a swipe at Jo and have no intention of
&gt; fostering further discussion of the subject in this forum. I will merely
&gt; note that I have seen it in the Parisian gay scene. As a Texan, you have
&gt; probably only known homosex-you-all folks.

Excuse me?  If you will check, the DFW metromess has one of the largest
gay people percentages in the US.  LOTS of people to observe, and short
of the prevalence of little 'goatee' type beards, which are much too
short to tie knots in, I see no indication of such an activity here.
Maybe it is something ethnic, or local.

&gt; BTW, I agree with what you wrote about the lack of denouement in DH. I
&gt; suppose JKR is simply too used to leaving her readers with a
&gt; cliff-hanger and wants to keep the suspense going for her &quot;encyclopedia&quot;.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Back to the subject, I also agree about direction. Still, I have always
&gt;&gt;&gt; found that Rupert is the only one who always has the most appropriate
&gt;&gt;&gt; facial expression for a scene. I call that acting. He is no Marcel
&gt;&gt;&gt; Marceau, but his use of mimical musculature is always spot on... and he
&gt;&gt;&gt; is the only one who doesn't react to the punch-line before it is given.

&gt; LOL, I never thought he looked gay but hippie. My friend thought he looked

Yes, definitely a mature flower-power hippie rather than gay.

And I know quite a lot (!) of gay guys and not one has a knot in their
beards. Conversely I've been to a few meetings at work where there was a guy
(from Social Services - say no more!) who had an admittedly-smaller beard
than Dd but which had a little knot in it. He also was fairly hippie with
tie-die clothes etc.  - and married with several kids. And not gay, to the
best of my knowledge :)
