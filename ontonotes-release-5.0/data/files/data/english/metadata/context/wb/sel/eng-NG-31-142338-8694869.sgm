NEW YORK_A decade after a Haitian immigrant was tortured in a police station bathroom by police officers, the victim, along with a leading civil rights activist and others were to gather Thursday to reflect on the attack that sparked protests across the city.
The Aug. 9, 1997, attack on Abner Louima was one of the New York Police Department's darkest hours, spurring calls for police reforms and straining minority relations with the department and then-Mayor Rudy Giuliani, a current Republican presidential hopeful.
Louima was beaten and sodomized with a broomstick by white officers after he was arrested in a brawl outside a Brooklyn nightclub. He suffered a ruptured bladder and colon and spent two months in the hospital. Charges against him were dropped.
The attack led to prison terms for two officers and the largest settlement ever in a police brutality case in New York. The city and police union agreed to pay Louima $8.7 million, which came to about $5.8 million after legal fees
Civil rights activist the Rev. Al Sharpton on Thursday planned to discuss the ongoing issue of police brutality and appraise Giuliani's response to the Louima case during the gathering Thursday evening, his office said.
The NYPD had no immediate comment early Thursday. A spokeswoman for Giuliani did not immediately return a cell phone message early Thursday.
In the wake of the assault, officer Justin Volpe pleaded guilty to civil rights violations and is serving a 30-year prison sentence. Officer Charles Schwarz pleaded guilty to perjury for helping cover up the assault and served a five-year term.
&quot;We are men, humans, who gave in to our dark side - but in the end just men,&quot; Volpe told the Daily News by letter for a story published Monday.
The former officer, now an inmate in a federal prison in Minnesota, did not directly express remorse for the crime, according to the newspaper. But he wrote that he had found the &quot;maturity and the knowledge that regardless of the immediate environment and surrounding violence not to give into it.&quot;
He is scheduled to be released in 2025.
Schwarz was released from federal custody in May, still maintaining his innocence, according to his lawyer. Authorities initially accused Schwarz of holding Louima down during the attack, but he was never convicted of that. He has always denied participating in the assault.
&quot;He just wants to put this behind him,&quot; attorney Ronald Fischetti said in May.
Louima, who now lives in Florida, wrote in a guest column in the Daily News on Sunday that he hoped the attention to his case had deterred future police violence. But saying that more needed to be done, he called for state and national lawmakers to require independent prosecutors - rather than local district attorneys - to handle all police brutality cases.
&quot;Things may have improved a bit, but not enough,&quot; Louima wrote. He pointed to a more recent deadly clash involving police: the November 2006 death of Sean Bell, an unarmed black man who was killed in a hail of 50 police bullets as he left his bachelor party at a Queens strip club.
Three officers have been indicted in Bell's death, two on manslaughter charges. All have pleaded not guilty. Lawyers for the officers have said they believed Bell and his friends were going to get a gun from a car, although no weapon was found.
Two of the officers are black, and one is white.
Louima, a father of three, now works in real estate investment.
&quot;After what happened to me, I consider myself lucky to be alive,&quot; he wrote.
