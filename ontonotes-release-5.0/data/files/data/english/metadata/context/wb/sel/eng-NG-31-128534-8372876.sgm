Help, please.  I'm a newbie.  I have a website hosted by my ISP
(Verizon).  All I really want to do is get my new domain name to point
to that site.  How do I do it?

You need to change the DNS for your domain (this can be done usually
through your domain registrar) so that you set-up a CNAME for 'www' to
point to the hostname of your ISP's web server.  Verizon can advise
you on the hostname.
