I was looking for something else, and came across this. In a way it's
saying what Abraham and &quot;The Secret&quot; are now saying and spreading
around the Universe (Sonship) We are creating our own life (and death/
fear) with our thoughts. And always have a choice in this.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------

Everyone experiences fear, and no-one enjoys it. Yet it would [take]
very little right-thinking to realize why fear occurs. Very few people
appreciate the real power of the mind, and no-one remains fully aware
of [it all] the time. However, if anyone hopes to spare himself from
fear, there [are some] things he must realize, and realize fully. The
mind is a very powerful[ ___ ] and it never loses its creative force.
It never sleeps. Every instant [it is] creating, and ALWAYS as you
will. Many of your ordinary expressions reflect this. For example,
when you say, &quot;Don't give it a thought,&quot; you imply that [if] you do
not think about something, it will have no effect on you. And [this
is] true enough.

On the other hand, many other expressions clearly illustrate the
prevailing LACK of awareness of thought-power. For example, you say,
&quot;Just an idle thought,&quot; and mean that the thought has no effect. You
also speak of some actions as &quot;thoughtless,&quot; implying that if the
person had thought, he would not behave as he did. While expressions
like &quot;think big&quot; give some recognition to the power of thought, they
still come nowhere near the truth. You do not expect to grow when you
say it, because you do not really think that you will.

It is hard to recognize that thought and belief combine into a power
surge that can literally move mountains. It appears at first glance
that to believe such power about yourself is merely arrogant, but that
is not the real reason why you do not believe it. People PREFER to
believe that their thoughts cannot exert real control because they are
literally AFRAID of them. Many psychotherapists attempt to help people
who are afraid, say, of their death wishes by depreciating the power
of the wish. They even try to &quot;free&quot; the patient by persuading him
that he can think whatever he wants without any REAL effect at all.

There is a real dilemma here which only the truly right-minded can
escape. Death wishes do not kill in the physical sense, but they DO
kill spiritual awareness. ALL destructive thinking is dangerous. Given
a death wish, a man has no choice except to ACT upon the thought, or
behave CONTRARY to it. He thus chooses only between homicide and fear.
The other possibility is that he depreciates the power of his thought.
This is the usual psychoanalytic approach. It DOES allay guilt, but at
the cost of rendering thinking impotent. If you believe that what you
think is ineffectual you may cease to be overly afraid of it, but you
are hardly likely to respect it.

The world is full of examples of how man has depreciated himself
because he is afraid of his own thoughts. In some forms of insanity
thoughts are glorified, but this is only because the underlying
depreciation was too effective for tolerance. The truth is that there
ARE no &quot;idle&quot; thoughts. ALL thinking produces form at some level. The
reason people are afraid of ESP and so often react against it is
because they KNOW that thoughts can hurt them. Their own thoughts have
made them vulnerable.

You who constantly complain about fear still persist in creating it. I
told you before that you cannot ask ME to release you from fear
because I KNOW it does not exist, but YOU do not. If I merely
intervened between your thoughts and their results, I would be
tampering with a basic law of cause and effect, the most fundamental
law there is in this world. I would hardly help if I depreciated the
power of your own thinking. This would be in direct opposition to the
purpose of this course. It is much more helpful to remind you that you
do not guard your thoughts carefully except for a small part of the
day, and somewhat inconsistently even then. You may feel at this point
that it would take a miracle to enable you to do this, which is
perfectly true.

Men are not used to miraculous thinking, but they can be TRAINED to
think that way. All miracle workers need that kind of training. I
cannot let them leave their minds unguarded or they will not be able
to help me. Miracle working entails a full realization of the power of
thought, and real avoidance of miscreation. Otherwise a miracle will
be necessary to set the mind ITSELF straight, a circular process which
would hardly foster the time collapse for which the miracle was
intended. Nor would it induce the healthy respect for true cause and
effect which every miracle worker must have.

Both miracles AND fear come from thoughts, and if you were not free to
choose one, you would also not be free to choose the other. By
choosing the miracle you HAVE rejected fear. You have been afraid of
God, of me, of yourselves, and of practically everyone you know at one
time or another. This is because you have misperceived or miscreated
us, and believe in what you have made. You would never have done this
if you were not afraid of your own thoughts. The vulnerable are
essentially miscreators because they misperceive creation.

You persist in believing that, when you do not consciously watch your
mind, it is unmindful. It is time, however, to consider the whole
world of the unconscious or &quot;unwatched&quot; mind. This may well frighten
you because it is the SOURCE of fear. The unwatched mind is
responsible for the whole content of the unconscious which lies ABOVE
the miracle level. All psychoanalytic theorists have made some
contribution in this connection, but none of them has seen it in its
true entirety. They have all made one common error in that they
attempted to uncover unconscious CONTENT. You cannot understand
unconscious activity in these terms because &quot;content&quot; is applicable
ONLY to the more superficial unconscious levels, to which the
individual himself contributes. This is the level at which he can
readily introduce fear, and usually does.

In the sequel there is a very important statement, imo:

&quot;It is essential not to control the fearful, but to ELIMINATE it.&quot;

- And this of course is from
one's own (unconscious, &quot;unwatched&quot;) mind.

Yes. I don't like to repost too much, I figure most reading won't
bother reading it all.

The way to eliminate something is to put the mind on something else,
instead. Like replace thoughts of fear with love. I think it says something
about love and fear can't co-exist, so filling the mind with love there's no
room for fear.
