Historicizing Difference: Anti-Stratfordians
and the Academy. by David Chandler

&lt;&lt;J. Thomas Looney, the first Oxfordian, brushed aside
the &quot;labyrinths of Baconian cryptograms&quot; (Looney, 103)
and stressed that: &quot;it is not from intentional self-disclosure
that we should expect to discover the author, but from more
or less unconscious indications of himself in the writings...&quot;

Looney, in fact, seems to have been much more aware
than many subsequent Oxfordians that his &quot;factual&quot; case was very
much tied up with a &quot;theory&quot; about how to read literature - as well he
might be, for his method involved first of all the construction of a
portrait of the plays' author on the basis of internal evidence.

As Christopher Dams concedes,
Looney's conclusions cannot be proved true, and believing them
requires some degree of &quot;faith.&quot; Put more simply, Looney made an
argument, however much some might like to believe that he merely
announced a discovery. That argument needs to be updated,
if it is to stimulate serious academic interest&gt;&gt;
------------------------------------------------------------
It *CAN ONLY BE* from intentional self-disclosure
that we should expect to verify Looney's conclusion:
------------------------------------------------------------
So Who Wrote Shakespeare?
---------------------------------------------------------------
*1* It might very well be someone whose life history
was hidden in &quot;the facts&quot; of Shakspere's life:
--------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;&lt;I have heard that Mr. Shakspeare...supplied the stage with 2 plays
EVER year, and for itt had an allowance so large, that hee spent att
the rate of £1,000 a-year.&gt;&gt; - *REVEREND (john) WARD* , Diary 1661-63

Ah! I've often thought that about myself
and some of the others, too!

In your own case, of course I can't read it all,

to be very glad you're writing!

In the case of Dave, or others contemplating

say, over 30k, 40k, or whatever...then you still get

&gt; Historicizing Difference: Anti-Stratfordians
&gt; and the Academy. by David Chandler

&gt;&lt;&lt;J. Thomas Looney, the first Oxfordian, brushed aside
&gt; the &quot;labyrinths of Baconian cryptograms&quot; (Looney, 103)

"/>

Looney goes for the Stratfordian cheap shot.

Freud, of course, supported Oxford because Looney's theory is
fundamentally Freudian:

&gt; [Looney} stressed that: &quot;it is not from intentional self-disclosure
&gt; that we should expect to discover the author, but from more
&gt; or less unconscious indications of himself in the writings...&quot;

This is classic. Looney doesn't seem to be aware that he has
unconsciously assigned the plays to Oxford. And his
argument is a form of the petitio principii argument in which the
premises are used to prove the conclusion. A priori Oxford wrote
the plays therefore anything in the plays can be used a posteriori
to prove that Oxford wrote the plays.

No way to be wrong with that argument--it works every time.

&gt; Looney, in fact, seems to have been much more aware
&gt; than many subsequent Oxfordians that his &quot;factual&quot; case was very
&gt; much tied up with a &quot;theory&quot; about how to read literature -
&gt; as well he
&gt; might be, for his method involved first of all the construction of a
&gt; portrait of the plays' author on the basis of internal evidence.

I'll agree that Looney was more aware than subsequent Oxfordians.

And it works just as well for NEW style Baconians like Elizabeth.

Which is precisely why OLD style Baconians were right in the first place:

&lt;&lt;It is ONLY from intentional self-disclosure
that we can ever hope to verify who the author was.&gt;&gt;

So Who Wrote Shakespeare?

*1* It might very well be someone whose life history
was hidden in &quot;the facts&quot; of Shakspere's life:

*2* It would probably be someone whose life history
was hidden in the works of Shake-speare:

*3* In any event, it would certainly be someone whose name
was stategically hidden in the works of Shake-speare:

Edward de Vere, the 17th Earl of Oxford
is the ONLY one for which this is all true:

More true nonsense.

Looney simply did what Stratfordian scholars and biographers had done
before him, he read the works. Stratfordian biographers frequently
made correspondences prior to Looney between the man from Stratford
and the Author. Several years ago in the New York Observor there was a
long article showing the correspondence between the man from Stratford
and the works, based on the observation that the Author mentioned
gloves in his play, and Shakspere's father had been a maker of gloves.
In this respect, Looney was no different than previous Stratfordian
biographers.

For her own purposes, Elizabeth Weir has exactly reversed what Looney
did, that he had already drawn a conclusion. Perhaps he had, but his
od can be applied to any work of literature, and therefore was a
distinct innovation, removed from whatever conceptions Looney had
about who was author. He didn't state it that way because he was only
concerned with Shakespeare's authorship. But Looney's od is a
valid today, and universal as it was then. It should be pointed out
that however valid it is, in 99.9% of the literary cases it is not
necessary. It is not necessary to prove that Faulkner was from the
South, or that James Joyce lived in Dublin. The most recent case of
using Looney's od was with Colors, and did point to an insider who
wrote the work.

In other words, if you made an abstract list of the set of universal
characteristics of literature, it should be able to be applied to any
work of literature and point to the author. Here might be some
characteristics:

1. Main characters
2. Point of view
3. Specific language, similar to known person
4. Insider knowledge
5. Locations
6. Knowledge of geography
7. Knowledge of particular social class
8. Knowledge of a trade
9. Knowledge of particular works of literature.
10. References to places or people in the author's
11. Knowledge of works in a foreign language
etc.

Those first believing Francis Bacon to be the author, used this
reasoning to lead to Bacon. Who was far more plausible than the man
from Stratford.

Stratfordians after Looney (less so after Bacon) quickly abandoned
this approach to support the Strat man from because it was obvious
that either Bacon or Oxford were much better candidates, and that
Shakspere had few if any correspondences between his and the
qualities of the author's work.

The best that Stratfordians can do is posit a set of &quot;could have's.&quot;
Shakspere could have known about Italy, Shakspere could have known
about aristocratic , and when that argument fails any test of
probability, then fall back on the aristocratic, slander argument,
&quot;You are only doubting this because you say a commoner was inferior to
an aristocrat.&quot;

Literary fashion over the last few years has been to deride the
&quot;biographical&quot; argument. But this is not applied in the context of
knowing who the author is, (most are certain that Dickens wrote
Copperfield), but rather knowing the &quot;intention&quot; of the work.
Stratfordians misconstrue this for their own limited purposes as an
attack on the biographical or authorial od applied to finding out
who wrote the work. With the exception of the Shakespeare argument,
this is never, or at least very seldom, needed.
