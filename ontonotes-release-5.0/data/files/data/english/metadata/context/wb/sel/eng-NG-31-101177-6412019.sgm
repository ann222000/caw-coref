*********************** ARTICLE START ***********************
Are you tired of traveling to the office and driving home late at night after work? Are you a mom who’s already tied up with a handful of kids? Or are you simply tired of putting up with your boss’ irritating attitude? Then the best place for you would be to stay at home. And yes, you can still earn—here are a few ideas on home-based businesses that have worked for other people:

1.If you are fond of kids, a daycare service would be the best form of business for you. This is also best for stay home moms.

2.Make use of whatever talents you have. If you are a born-writer, then go ahead and scout for writing gigs online. There are plenty that would even pay you well. There are also online surveys that pay you decently. Just make sure to steer clear of those online scams. If you are the ‘baking mom’ type, then go ahead and bake some cakes or cookies and sell them at a good price. Do you dance? Then do the groove and teach other people how to do so. If you dream bigger and believe that you have the ‘artistic flair’, why not invest in a wedding consultation business?

3.Look for products that you can sell in eBay. Auctioning could rake in money for you.

4.If you like dogs or cats more than kids, then why don’t you set up a pet grooming service center? This business is best for those who have at least some knowledge on animal anatomy and their needs. Make sure that there is sufficient space for all your animal guests.

5.Medical transcription services are continuously booming. You can jump into the bandwagon and start earning at home.

6.If you are a teacher at heart, then go ahead and do some tutorial services. You can do online tutorials if you want.

7.A lot of people want scrapbooking but only a few are really gifted to actually do it. If you are artistic enough, go ahead and set up a scrapbooking service business.

8.Do you want to help other people land jobs? Then you can go on and write their resumes for them. They would even pay you for doing it for them.

9.There are some people who sell their artworks online (examples are wood carvings, paintings and other artworks). It wouldn’t hurt to try to sell your works, too.

10.You also have the option to make web designs for other people while at home.

11.Write eBooks, throw all caution to the wind, and submit it online.

12.You can also do the numbers for other people. Set up an accounting business right in your own home.

13.Be somebody’s secretary. Set up an answering service business. Instead of working on call centers, why don’t you try to have one at home?

14.Are you fond of yoga? Then why not share that passion to others and start earning in the process?

15.Desktop publishing still ranks well on the top home-based businesses. Other small businesses can profit from your service and are willing to pay you for it.

These are but some of the home-based business ideas that you can start thinking about. Just choose which one you feel great about, then go ahead and do the first step on your planned big leap.
