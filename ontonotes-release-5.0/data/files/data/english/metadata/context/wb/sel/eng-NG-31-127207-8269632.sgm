Fla. State Representative Accused Of Soliciting Sex In Men's Room
Police: Allen Offered To Perform Act For $20

POSTED: 5:08 pm EDT July 11, 2007
UPDATED: 6:55 am EDT July 12, 2007

TITUSVILLE, Fla. -- Florida state Rep. Robert &quot;Bob&quot; Allen, R-Merritt
Island, was arrested Wednesday and charged with soliciting an
undercover male officer for sex at a park in Central Florida,
according to police.

Investigators said Allen was acting suspicious and went in and out of
the men's restroom at Veteran's Memorial Park, located on East Broad
Street.

Minutes later, authorities said, Allen solicited the male officer
inside the restroom, offering to perform oral sex for $20.

Allen was then arrested.

Wednesday night, an attorney for Allen urged the public to remember
the lawmaker's years of public service.

&quot;The only comment we have to make is everyone is innocent until proven
guilty,&quot; the attorney, who did not identify himself, said as he and
Allen exited the Brevard County jail in Sharpes just before 10 p.m.
Wednesday. &quot;We would hope that everyone takes into consideration Mr.
Allen's history of public service (and) that everyone is innocent
until proven guilty.&quot;

Officers realized he was a public figure after the arrest, a news
release said.

Allen, who is from Merritt Island, was booked into the Brevard County
Jail Wednesday night.

He later posted $500 bond and was released from the jail.

Allen declined to make a comment in Sharpes but nodded slightly when
asked by the assembled media if the incident was a mistake.

Allen, is a former Little League volunteer who also donated time to
the Boys and Girls Club, serving on its board of directors.

The Merritt Island resident was born in 1958 and moved to Brevard
County in 1964. He attended the University of Central Florida and
Florida State University.

He has a wife and a child, according the official Web site of the
Florida House of Representatives.

all, IT IS THE LEADERS of the country who determine the policy and it
is always a simple matter to drag the people along, whether it is a
democracy, or a fascist dictatorship, or a parliament, or a communist
dictatorship. Voice or no voice, the people can always be brought to
the bidding of the leaders. That is easy. All you have to do is TELL

patriotism and exposing the country to danger. IT WORKS THE SAME IN ANY

Freedoms Lost Under G.W. Bush

by Chuck Baldwin

Anyone who dares to oppose or even question Bush must be regarded as
enemies of America or even as enemies of God.

February 1, 2005--Supporters and apologists for President G.W. Bush
will often assail my assertion that the Bush administration has done
more to dismantle constitutional protections of our liberties than any
president in modern memory. It seems that these people believe that
until federal Storm Troopers knock down the doors of their homes and
drag them off to the gulags, they have lost no freedoms. Nothing could
be further from the truth.
If history is any teacher, it instructs us in the incremental process
that elitists use to implement their totalitarian agenda. The first
step is to use an incessant, highly orchestrated propaganda. For all
practical purposes, the major media in the United States is providing
that propaganda. At the national level, there is hardly any
investigative journalism going on. Instead, the national press corps
has become little more than lazy lackeys for the White House.

The second step is to lay the foundation for totalitarianism by passing
legislation that may later be used against the citizenry. And that is
exactly what the Bush administration has very successfully
accomplished. It very adroitly succeeded where the Clinton
administration failed.

For example, most conservatives would be surprised to learn that the
Patriot Act and Department of Homeland Security was the brainchild of
one William Jefferson Clinton. However, a recalcitrant Republican
Congress denied Clinton the opportunity to implement these plans. Of
course, with the Republican, G.W. Bush, serving as President, that same
Republican Congress was all too eager to pass these bills into law.

Whether or not individual Americans have been personally subjected to
tyranny as a result of lost freedoms doesn't change the fact that they
have already lost these freedoms.

The third step is to demonize and marginalize anyone and everyone who
opposes the government's plans and ambitions. Such opponents are
characterized as &quot;unpatriotic,&quot; &quot;obstructionist,&quot; &quot;uncompassionate,&quot; or
even &quot;ungodly.&quot; Once again, the Bush minions have very skillfully done
just that. Anyone who dares to oppose or even question Bush must be
regarded as enemies of America or even as enemies of God.

Of course, the last step is to begin using the power and force of
government to physically silence or remove those who are determined to
require such treatment. And, as Germany's National Socialists proved,
by the time this happens, there is no one around who is capable of
coming to the assistance of such people.

For those who are willing to objectively analyze Bush's actions and
policies, the truth is clearly seen: this President has systematically
put in place laws, policies, and bureaucracies that can, are, and will
continue to strip the American citizenry of the constitutional
protections of their liberties.

Following are examples of freedoms which President Bush and his fellow
Republicans in Congress have already expunged (as reported by the
Associated Press):

FREEDOM OF ASSOCIATION: Government may monitor religious and political
institutions without suspecting criminal activity to assist terror
investigations.

FREEDOM OF INFORMATION: Government has closed once-public immigration
hearings, has secretly detained hundreds of people without charges, and
has encouraged bureaucrats to resist public records questions.

FREEDOM OF SPEECH: Government may prosecute librarians or keepers of
any other records if they tell anyone that the government subpoenaed
information related to a terror investigation.

RIGHT TO LEGAL REPRESENTATION: Government may monitor federal prison
jailhouse conversations between attorneys and clients, and deny lawyers
to Americans accused of crimes.

FREEDOM FROM UNREASONABLE SEARCHES: Government may search and seize
Americans' papers and effects without probable cause to assist terror
investigation.

RIGHT TO A SPEEDY AND PUBLIC TRIAL: Government may jail Americans
indefinitely without a trial.

RIGHT TO LIBERTY: Americans may be jailed without being charged or
being able to confront witnesses against them.

That good citizens are compliant and unconcerned regarding G.W. Bush's
propensity to trample constitutional freedoms bespeaks a great
ignorance or a great apathy, or both.

These rights have already been lost! Whether individual Americans have
been personally subjected to the resultant tyranny or not doesn't
change the fact that they have already lost these freedoms! This fact,
alone, should be enough for any studious lover-of-liberty to be
outraged.

Freedoms Lost Under G.W. Bush

by Chuck Baldwin

Anyone who dares to oppose or even question Bush must be regarded as
enemies of America or even as enemies of God.

February 1, 2005--Supporters and apologists for President G.W. Bush
will often assail my assertion that the Bush administration has done
more to dismantle constitutional protections of our liberties than any
president in modern memory. It seems that these people believe that
until federal Storm Troopers knock down the doors of their homes and
drag them off to the gulags, they have lost no freedoms. Nothing could
be further from the truth.
If history is any teacher, it instructs us in the incremental process
that elitists use to implement their totalitarian agenda. The first
step is to use an incessant, highly orchestrated propaganda. For all
practical purposes, the major media in the United States is providing
that propaganda. At the national level, there is hardly any
investigative journalism going on. Instead, the national press corps
has become little more than lazy lackeys for the White House.

The second step is to lay the foundation for totalitarianism by passing
legislation that may later be used against the citizenry. And that is
exactly what the Bush administration has very successfully
accomplished. It very adroitly succeeded where the Clinton
administration failed.

For example, most conservatives would be surprised to learn that the
Patriot Act and Department of Homeland Security was the brainchild of
one William Jefferson Clinton. However, a recalcitrant Republican
Congress denied Clinton the opportunity to implement these plans. Of
course, with the Republican, G.W. Bush, serving as President, that same
Republican Congress was all too eager to pass these bills into law.

Whether or not individual Americans have been personally subjected to
tyranny as a result of lost freedoms doesn't change the fact that they
have already lost these freedoms.

Of course. It's been that way since we declared our Independence. It
will always be that way. Everyone wants to stand at a safe distance

Indeed so.

WW2 was a great battle where most of the world united to defeat the
overt enemy, the fascist Nazi - Hitler.  But victory is &quot;fleeting&quot; as
general George Patton would remind us:
&quot;
For over a thousand years, Roman conquerors returning from the wars
enjoyed the honor of a triumph - a tumultuous parade.  In the
procession came trumpeters and musicians, and strange animals from the
conquered territories, together with treasure and captured armaments.
The conqueror rode in a triumphal chariot, the dazed prisoners walking
in chains before him.  Sometimes his children, robed in white, stood
with him in the chariot or rode the trace horses.  A slave stood
behind the conqueror, holding a golden crown, and whispering in his
ear a warning - that all victory is fleeting.
&quot;
Simply, throughout all time, another enemy springs up after the
victory.  And yes a new enemy has risen and seeks to subvert and
invade from within.  Muslim militants.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Oh, so before Bush, were people in 47 countries chanting &quot;Death to america&quot;?

&gt;&gt; Of course. It's been that way since we declared our Independence. It
&gt;&gt; will always be that way. Everyone wants to stand at a safe distance
&gt;&gt; and yell insults at the BIG MAN. By the way have you noticed that
&gt;&gt; those anti-American vids are always shot &quot;close up&quot; so that 15 people
&gt;&gt; look like the front of hundreds? You've got to learn how the game is
&gt;&gt; played, old man, or you just keep getting sucker punched.

&gt; Indeed so.

&gt; WW2 was a great battle where most of the world united to defeat the
&gt; overt enemy, the fascist Nazi - Hitler.  But victory is &quot;fleeting&quot; as
&gt; general George Patton would remind us:
&gt; &quot;
&gt; For over a thousand years, Roman conquerors returning from the wars
&gt; enjoyed the honor of a triumph - a tumultuous parade.  In the
&gt; procession came trumpeters and musicians, and strange animals from the
&gt; conquered territories, together with treasure and captured armaments.
&gt; The conqueror rode in a triumphal chariot, the dazed prisoners walking
&gt; in chains before him.  Sometimes his children, robed in white, stood
&gt; with him in the chariot or rode the trace horses.  A slave stood
&gt; behind the conqueror, holding a golden crown, and whispering in his
&gt; ear a warning - that all victory is fleeting.
&gt; &quot;
&gt; Simply, throughout all time, another enemy springs up after the
&gt; victory.  And yes a new enemy has risen and seeks to subvert and
&gt; invade from within.  Muslim militants.
">

Under real leadership, we defeated Japan AND Germany in less time
than Captain Clusterfuck's invasion of a country that we had under
blockade for more than a decade.

&gt; Freedoms Lost Under G.W. Bush

&gt; by Chuck Baldwin

&gt; Anyone who dares to oppose or even question Bush must be regarded as
&gt; enemies of America or even as enemies of God.

&gt; February 1, 2005--Supporters and apologists for President G.W. Bush will
&gt; often assail my assertion that the Bush administration has done more to
&gt; dismantle constitutional protections of our liberties than any president
&gt; in modern memory. It seems that these people believe that until federal
&gt; Storm Troopers knock down the doors of their homes and drag them off to
&gt; the gulags, they have lost no freedoms. Nothing could be further from
&gt; the truth.
">

ZZZZZzzzzzz.... you know shit about freedom. Every law and regulation
reduces your freedom. You are told how many gallons of water you can
have in your toilet, how fast you can drive, when you can water your
lawn, what you can cook your french fries in, whether or not people can
smoke in YOUR business - your freedoms are constantly eroding, and you
whinge and whine about the Patriot Act? Fact is most leftys who whine
about the Patriot Act are ALL TOO KEEN to tell everyone else what to do
and how to do it, they just couch it as being for the collective good,
and have no problems at all taking everyone's MONEY, but never see THAT
as taking away freedom, despite private property being the bedrock of a
free society. Oh no, that's just being &quot;fair&quot;.

The day you ACTUALLY see one of your rights disappear - not some
esoteric &quot;well if they thought I was a terorrist they COULD...&quot; you let
everyone know.

Oh... and I am curious... how is BUSH responsible for this? He SIGNS
legislation, asshat, he doesn't pass it. I seem to recall an
OVERWHELMING approval by BOTH parties of the Patriot Act. But the only
person signled out? Bush. Cause he's a dictator!

But then, that just shines the light on the true agenda - political
hackery in pursuit of political power. Talk about fearmongering...

Of course they do, most of the provisions this pantwetter talks about
still require a court order, or are powers already extended in RICO or
to grand juries. Most lefties have no problem confiscating guns, the
only REAL tool anyone has to resist the government, or money, but
fuckall if the FBI can find out what books someone checked out of the
library, like there is some ancient Librarian-Customer confidentiality
tradition from the Magna Carta on down. Oh yes, can't find out what you
checked out, but you got NO problem asking everyone to tell the
government where you live, who you live with, if you have kids, how much
money you make, who you work for, who you donate money to, every April
15th, have you ever actually LOOKED at what you are required to tell the
government? But Lord, if they find out I checked out Green Eggs and Ham,
that's the end of freedom as we know it. Assuming, of course, spying on
me becomes more interesting than chasing Muslim nuts who might blow shit up.

Obviously, you're too damned young and ignorant to remember the early 70s.

Not only was gasoline rationed, but energy consumption was regulated

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Wow, one of the few people still supporting georgiegirl

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Even after he continually lied to you

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Even after paying for gasoline three times what you paid when Clinton
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; was President

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; You're an idiot.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I tried and tried with you to get you to understand that oil companies
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; do not set the price of oil and that the President doesn't set the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; gasoline price....

&gt;&gt; &gt; You're the idiot here.  Go to your local gasoline retailer and ask,
&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;Who
&gt;&gt; &gt; sells you gasoline?&quot;  Then, follow that up with, &quot;Who raises the
&gt;&gt; &gt; price?&quot;
&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;Who raises their price?&quot;

&gt;&gt; &gt; The president can not only control that price if he so chooses (through
&gt;&gt; &gt; congress), but he can institute rationing as a means of capping, and
&gt;&gt; &gt; cap
&gt;&gt; &gt; retail prices on all utilities and fuel sources until the corporations
&gt;&gt; &gt; prove
&gt;&gt; &gt; they're selling beloew market.  That doesn't happen when record profits
&gt;&gt; &gt; (get that word, idiot... PROFIT) are being posted by all of the oil
&gt;&gt; &gt; companies.

&gt;&gt; Another assgasket straight out of Gosplan. How well did price controls
&gt;&gt; work last time? Just what we need, some asshat in Usenet setting gas
&gt;&gt; prices, that's SURE to work out great, cheap gas and plenty of it for
&gt;&gt; all! Rationing, price controls, you left out state control of
&gt;&gt; distribution and production, comrade...

&gt; Obviously, you're too damned young and ignorant to remember the early 70s.

&gt; Not only was gasoline rationed, but energy consumption was regulated
&gt; with great success in controlling the resultant pricing schedule.

&gt; I have no fucking idea what your ignorant ass is asserting regarding
&gt; &quot;some asshat on Usenet&quot; (that would be you) controlling gas prices.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; What are you going to do when a Democrap is elected and the price of
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; gasoline and everything else continues to go up?

&gt;&gt; &gt; What can we do, fool....?   The corporate Coup D'Etat of 2000 was fully

I remember that time;  I dropped out of college and leased a Gulf
filling station in my tiny home town.   Gas in a nearby larger town
was from 43-48.9 while I charged what the other two stations in town
charged for regular:  53.9, a profit margin for me of .16 cents/
gallon.  That was an unspoken price fix, I suppose, and even while my
distributor always bitched at me to lower prices (he told me eight
cents/gallon was plenty enough), I didn't because I knew I couldn't
compete with those other two guys who had been in business a lot
longer than me.  (and unleaded was introduced during that time, too)

Just a little personal BS and here's some more:  I am third generation
oil field trash and have worked in quite a few different areas of  the
exploration, production and refining of oil and gas.

It annoys me when people speak of price controls and then try to point
out a time in the past where it worked;   I can't think of any time
they ever worked...perhaps during WWII, but not the time you speak of.

In the early 70's,  Nixon placed price controls on the oil industry as
well as other sectors of the American economy in order to combat
inflation.  Eventually controls were lifted from everything else but
US-produced oil as so to protect consumers from the jump in world oil
prices caused by the Arab oil embargo of 73-74.   A windfall profits
tax was imposed in 1980 for the same reason due to the Iran/Iraq
war.   It was finally repealed in 1989 but not before it cost the oil
companies an estimated 79 billion dollars, money which could've been
used to invest in new domestic production and exploration leading to
1.6 billion fewer barrels of oil being produced in the U.S. from
1980-1988. The tax reduced domestic oil production as much as 6
percent, and increased oil imports as much as 16 percent.

You think their profits are too high?   They sure might seem
excessive, esp. when you start talking BILLIONS, some &quot;real&quot; money but
let's talk percentages of profit, not amounts.    At approx. 9%,  oil
company profits are below other industries such as computers,
chemicals, electrical equipment, beverage / tobacco and
pharmaceuticals and medicines (in that order, with the last having a
profit margin of over 20%.)

Kraft Foods profit margin went down a bit this last year,  but they
still managed to rake in 9.4 billion.   Why not put a windfall profits
tax on their 14% profit?

U.S. Energy Information Administration http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/finance/
(EIA)
indicates that when the average price of unleaded regular peaked at
about $3 a gallon in the middle of 2006, major companies were making a
profit of about 10 cents a gallon on their U.S. refining and marketing
operations.

So, that's too much for you and Hillary and Teddy?

I don't have the figures right off hand, but gasoline prices sure have
gone up quite a bit since the late 80's;  65% was the figure up until
this last price increase, I believe, but in that same time food has
gone up 80%, housing 90%, rent 110%, medical care 210% and tuition,
school fees and childcare have gone up a staggering 325%.

I think the cost of a good premium tequila has gone up 300% since Bush
was in office, but I don't hold him responsible for the Mexican agave
crop failure of his first year.    Blame him for some of the
following, but they all have affects upon the price of crude oil:
Let's not forget the 2005 hurricane season, which shut down most of
the U.S. Gulf of Mexico's oil and gas production for several months
and wrecked most of its refining infrastructure. Throw in the war in
Iraq, unrest in Nigeria, the Iran crisis, the increasing demand from
China, India and other developing nations and that leads to
uncertainty over the long-term stability of supply.   That's what is
driving up the price of oil, not the &quot;greedy oil companies&quot;.

U.S. oil refining capacity is now less than it was in 1980, and since
that time there's been a 25 percent increase in demand. Because of
costly environmental regulations, it's been 30 years since a new
refinery has been built. According to the American Petroleum
Institute, over the last 10 years, it has cost the oil industry $47
billion to comply with costly and sometimes useless environmental
controls. There are restrictions on exploiting the huge oil reserves
in Alaska, the Gulf and the Atlantic and Pacific coasts.

Over the past 25 years, oil companies directly paid or remitted more
than $2.2 trillion in taxes, after adjusting for inflation, to federal
and state governments-including excise taxes, royalty payments and
state and federal corporate income taxes. That amounts to more than
three times what they earned in profits during the same period,
according to the latest numbers from the Bureau of Economic Analysis
and U.S. Department of Energy.  These figures do not include local
property taxes, state sales and severance taxes and on-shore royalty
payments.

Teddy Kennedy said: &quot;......we ought to have a bipartisan effort to
recapture, recapture these excessive profits that are going to the oil
industry and return them to working families and middle-income
families.&quot;

The Federal Gas Tax is 18.4 cents per gallon;  where the hell is that
money goin', Ted ol' pal?   Let's not worry about that just
now...we'll drive off that bridge when we come to it.   Ooops, here we
are, hang on:

State and Federal Treasuries &quot;Profit&quot; More from Gasoline Sales than
U.S. Oil Industry
http://www.taxfoundation.org/publications/show/1139.html

Gasoline Tax Rates by State
http://www.gaspricewatch.com/usgastaxes.asp

New York State puts 31.9 cents on every gallon of gasoline. Let's look
at how that breaks down:

Includes 8 cents per gallon excise tax, Petroleum Business Tax of 15.2
cents per gallon for gasoline and 13.45 cents per gallon for diesel
(rate increased .6 cpg 1/1/05). Statewide volume weighted average
sales tax increased 6/1/04 to 8.3 for per gallon for gasoline and 7.1
cents per gallon for diesel. Also a spill tax of 0.3 cent per gallon
is collected on gasoline and diesel and a petroleum testing fee of
0.05 cent per gallon is levied on gasoline. Does not include an
estimated 7.9 cents per gallon for gasoline and 6.7 cents per gallon
for diesel from weighted county average sales taxes that range from
3.25% to 4.75%.

And the govts., state, feds. local, whoever puts taxes on it, always,
ALWAYS profits even MORE from price increases,  they take a
percentage, it's a built-in cost-of-bidness royal consumer screwin',
what the hell does that tell you?   And you want them to take
more....&lt;sigh&gt;

*You* friggin' Yankees have the nerve to blame Bush for high gas
prices?   Screw you.  Sweep around your own front door first, then we
can talk.

What I really don't understand is how we allow OPEC to operate as they
do, why we don't put THEIR cojones in the vise.   We have laws against
monopolies, our own oil companies know that from the govt. breaking
them up at the start of the last century.

It would help if we didn't contribute to the reason for the high oil
prices, namely buying crapola made with plastics made from oil stock
by and then made in China.   The more we buy, the more they'll make
and the more oil they'll buy to make the crap we buy, it begins and
ends with us, we're the ones who have the power to lower oil prices
simply by changing our own purchasing habits.    Buy American if you
can, but if not, buy from Taiwan or Canada or Australia or even Mexico
or hell...even France, but avoid Chinese goods.

Gullible is no way to go through life, sir. Nice story, but full of
holes and bull.

You think you're the only one smart enough to price fix gasoline?

Shell actually tried to close down a refinery and the government made
them sell it instead. See, the oil companies want to maximize profits
and not building new refineries limits supply. I'm sure you can
understand that restricting supply affects prices. And like the guy
that passes gas and blames someone else, it sure is easy to blame the
environmentalists and giggle.

As for all those taxes paid by big oil...

http://marketplace.publicradio.org/shows/2006/09/13/AM200609134.html

http://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/14/business/14oil.html?ei=5088&amp;en;=87dc...

You can like oil companies all you want, but most of us want to
decrease oil usage rather than act like junkies seeking more and more
of it. Worst of all you actually defend the dealers as victims rather
than as profiteers who are making every cent they can off the stuff,
even if they have to cut corners.

&gt; &gt;uncertainty over the long-term stability of supply.   That's what is
&gt; &gt;driving up the price of oil, not the &quot;greedy oil companies&quot;.

&gt; &gt;U.S. oil refining capacity is now less than it was in 1980, and since
&gt; &gt;that time there's been a 25 percent increase in demand. Because of
&gt; &gt;costly environmental regulations, it's been 30 years since a new
&gt; &gt;refinery has been built. According to the American Petroleum
&gt; &gt;Institute, over the last 10 years, it has cost the oil industry $47
&gt; &gt;billion to comply with costly and sometimes useless environmental
&gt; &gt;controls. There are restrictions on exploiting the huge oil reserves
&gt; &gt;in Alaska, the Gulf and the Atlantic and Pacific coasts.

&gt; &gt;Over the past 25 years, oil companies directly paid or remitted more
&gt; &gt;than $2.2 trillion in taxes, after adjusting for inflation, to federal
&gt; &gt;and state governments-including excise taxes, royalty payments and
&gt; &gt;state and federal corporate income taxes. That amounts to more than
&gt; &gt;three times what they earned in profits during the same period,
&gt; &gt;according to the latest numbers from the Bureau of Economic Analysis
&gt; &gt;and U.S. Department of Energy.  These figures do not include local
&gt; &gt;property taxes, state sales and severance taxes and on-shore royalty
&gt; &gt;payments.

&gt; Gullible is no way to go through life, sir. Nice story, but full of
&gt; holes and bull.

&gt; You think you're the only one smart enough to price fix gasoline?

&gt; Shell actually tried to close down a refinery and the government made
&gt; them sell it instead. See, the oil companies want to maximize profits
&gt; and not building new refineries limits supply. I'm sure you can
&gt; understand that restricting supply affects prices. And like the guy
&gt; that passes gas and blames someone else, it sure is easy to blame the
&gt; environmentalists and giggle.

&gt; As for all those taxes paid by big oil...

&gt; You can like oil companies all you want, but most of us want to
&gt; decrease oil usage rather than act like junkies seeking more and more
&gt; of it. Worst of all you actually defend the dealers as victims rather
&gt; than as profiteers who are making every cent they can off the stuff,
&gt; even if they have to cut corners.
">

Don't blame the oil companies, the system rewards shareholders at the
exclusion and exploitation of non-shareholders. Great that the stock
market is at all-time highs, but for the non-shareholder, that means
most likely a further misery, as most dollars available are hoarded by
the wealthy (the rest are sent to mexico.)

The system has to be rebuilt. Clinton/Chavez '08.

&lt;yawn&gt;

FROM THE CHRISTIAN BIBLE:
Genesis 7:23 He killed, intentionally, every man, woman, and child on
the planet save eight of them.
God commands Hagar go back into servanthood and bear children for her
master though she does not want to.  Genesis 16:7-9
Genesis 19:23-25 God burns down a whole city (women and children
included) simply because they were supposedly homosexual.
Er, Judah’s firstborn, was wicked in the sight of the Lord; and that
the Lord slew him.  How was Er wicked? The Bible doesn’t give us this
bit of information, only that Er was wicked in the sight of the Lord.
Genesis 38:7
Genesis 38:10 God murders Onan for refusing to commit incest with his
sister in law.
Exodus 12:29 God repeatedly tells Moses exactly what calamity he will
next visit upon the Egyptians if the Pharaoh does not allow the
Israelites to be set free from slavery.  Then he tells Moses (also
repeatedly) that he will harden Pharaoh’s heart, so that he will refuse
to allow the Israelites to go, thus bringing a calamity upon his own
people, as well as showing him the awesome power of the Israelites’
Lord.  This occurs over and over, bringing calamity upon calamity upon
the Egyptian people.  What is troubling about this verse is that when
god “hardens the pharaoh’s heart” he is interfering with the Pharaoh’s
free will and ultimately bringing punishment on the Egyptians for
something they are not responsible for.  As a final punishment god
decides to kill all the first born of Egypt.  The lord reduced himself
to murdering innocent kids when he could have simply freed the
Israelites himself with his “omnipotent” power.
God punishes children for the sins of their fathers, unto the third and
fourth generations.  Punishing a child for the sins of their ancestors
is not very just. Exodus 20:5&amp;34:7
God endorses slavery. He even set up laws as to how slavery was to be
carried out, and goes as far as Okaying beating them.  Exodus 21:2-6
God sanctioned the selling of ones daughter.  How can any being tell
another to literally sell their child into slavery?  Disgusting!
Exodus 21:7
Exodus 22:18  God orders the death of witches, sorceresses and anyone
who practices magic.  Sadly enough, this verse was justification for
the Inquisition.
Exodus 32:27 God ordered to be killed, 3,000 Israelites for no greater
crime than worshipping a golden calf.  I don’t know about you but death
is a pretty harsh fucking punishment.
Leviticus 20:9-10 God commands death for cursing out ones parents and
death for adultery.  Gee, with these types of laws the population
should be almost nil by now.
Once again god is a homophobe, or at the very least, a bigot.  Leviticus 20:13
Handicapped people must not approach the altar.  Leviticus 21:16-23
Leviticus 26:30 “And ye shall eat the flesh of your sons, and the flesh
of your daughters shill ye eat.”
Leviticus 27:28-29 God ordered and allowed human sacrifices.
Numbers 16:27 God buries alive Korah and his family.
Numbers 16:35 God killed 250 Levite princes who disagreed with Moses’
leadership. He was so bloodthirsty that he wanted to slay more until he
was talked out of it.  Later he put a plague upon 14,700 Jews who
thought there was something wrong in killing 250 princes.
Numbers 21:1-3 God utterly destroyed the Canaanites at Hormah as a
favor to the Jews.
Numbers 21:27-35 God abetted Moses in utterly destroying the Amorites
at Heshbon - “…the men, the women, and the little ones.”
Numbers 31:17-18 God commands Moses to kill all the Medianite people
including children and women.  To top it off he commands that the
virgins be saved for later raping by Moses’ soldiers.
Deuteronomy 3:3-7 God ordered Moses’ army to “utterly destroy” 60
cities, killing all the women and children within!
Deuteronomy 7:12 God ordered the Israelites to kill all the people of
seven nations.  He even adds, “show no mercy unto them”.
Deuteronomy 20:16 God orders that we kill everything that breathes in
the cities that he gives us for an inheritance
A bastard can’t attend church “even to his tenth generation.” As if
denying an innocent child rights to worship isn’t cruel. Deuteronomy
23:2
