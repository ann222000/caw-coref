Low Fat Foods DON'T WORK.
You cannot lose weight using Low Fat Diets.  Low fat foods have been
popular for more than 15 years, but yet our society is getting more
overweight as each year passes.  This fact alone should tell you that
eating a purely low fat menu is not the answer to losing weight.
Low Calorie Diets DON'T WORK.
You won't lose weight using a Low Calorie Dieting Plan either.   In
fact, eating low calories is the worst thing that you can do to your
body, since that will only slow down your body's fat burning engine and
ruin all chances of losing weight (low calorie diets may allow a few
pounds of weight loss for the first few days, but then after that all
weight loss comes to a halt --- known as a dieting plateau).   You can
never get slim by starving yourself.
Low Carb Plans DON'T WORK.
You'll probably find it extremely difficult to get slim using a Low
Carb Dieting Plan.  Low carb diets have recently become popular over
the last couple years, but the problem with low carb menus is that they
are too strict and TOO HARD TO FOLLOW for average people.   Low carb
menus tend to rob your body of too much energy (carbohydrates) and make
it nearly impossible to remain on the program for very long.  This is
why so many dieters find it difficult to follow a strict low
carbohydrate menu.
What about Weight Watchers and Jenny Craig Dieting Plans?
Weight loss programs such as Weight Watchers (and Jenny Craig) usually
involve slower dieting progress over a longer period of time, since
such programs generally promise only 2-3 pounds of weight loss per
week.  Also, programs such as Jenny Craig usually involve buying
special meals and/or dietary supplements during the initial phases of
the program.  While some people may like these types of dietary
programs, we prefer a dieting plan which focuses on faster weight loss.

But the best chance might be changing to less energy-dense foods, and
public transport (which involves walking to the train/bus stop), and
better bike facilities.    jack

ps  Yesterday, I got up a sparrow's (first light) to move several
tonnes of sand from point A to point B before they took my point Bs
away and was struck by all the slim young girls/women dressed up to
the nines and with earphones on, obviously walking to the nearby train
station on the way to work. I must get up early more often    :=0

Dr. Perricone recommends not eating bad fats like saturated fat and
trans-fat. He recommends eating good fats like monounsaturated fat,
which is in Avocados for one. He also recommends Omega 3. He recommends
not eating bad carbs like those in cake and sugar. He recommends eating
good carbs like those in beans. He recommends eating foods that cut
down your body's inflammation and foods that have things that assist
your body in burning fat and not storing fat. He tells you what are the
best foods for these purposes and what supplements reduce inflammation
and increase fat burning. It seems like the latest trend in losing
weight focuses on reducing inflammation in the body, because that's a
big cause of people storing fat and not being able to burn it off. But
to sum it all up in a nut shell: eat healthy stuff and don't eat
unhealthy stuff. If everyone did that, we wouldn't have the epidemics
of obesity &amp; diabetese. The processed food industry did this to us. All
they care about is making money. They have no morals. They're like drug
dealers.

So long as the avocado comes with it, of course.

The carbs are fine (all carbs are much the same) it's what comes with
it that is important. Use whole fruit or art sweetener to sweeten
things, and wholefood starches when these are desired.

You burn all the fat you eat every day, without fail, unless you are

There is no magic bullet that prevents overeating from storing fat.

That's bass ackwards. The latest fad is that fat storage causes
inflammation, not the other way around.

Right (provided you get all the nutrients you need, of course).

But then, *how* do you succeed in eating only what you burn?
I guess there is a different answer for each individual, and that's why
there are different "diets".

I agree, Enrico.

I am tending to an idea that if folk ate no processed or refined
foods, their body weight would remain fairly stable, without conscious
effort to raise or lower energy input. Also, eating the whole food
rather than an energy concentrated refined portion of it, would also
likely give us all the micronutrients we have evolved to need.
I don't go with the raw food faddists but agree that raw food is great
stuff, where possible. I gather some folk never have any raw food pass
their lips from one year to the next. I don't know anyone like that,
but it is probably the case. Anyway, the advantages of low energy
density and high nutrient content would seem to make a varied diet of
wholefoods an ideal that can usefully be aimed at, if indeed never
totally achieved. Like child rearing, it is always helpful to know
what you SHOULD do, even if you don't always achieve it. Nothing worse
than floundering about in the dark not knowing exactly what would be
the optimal path to follow.    jack

First, let me say I am not fond of refined foods either. Often you lose
something in the process or add something else which is not as good.
Still, you seem to use the word "refined" in a broader meaning.
Well,  nearly any food we eat has been "processed" someway. Sometimes a bit
of processing is useful: would you give up the scent of a cup of coffee and
only eat coffee beans? And, no more cheese? ;-)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

"Whole foods" are often rich in fiber and fill up your stomach. :-)
But, is there any difference for your body weight if you drink raw milk or
pasteurized milk?

But *I* wouldn't class coffeee as a food. Yes, a little cheese is OK,
but it is usually incredibly salty, and quite fatty (high calorie). I
choose fat free cheese for my salad.
But like chocolate, a small amount of Danish blue, or Camembert is a
fine treat.  My diet is surprisingly unprocessed. A lot of raw salad
vegetables, and raw whole fruits. My rolled oats are rolled and boiled
for a few minutes after soaking in hot water for half an hour. Yes, my
wheatgerm I add (a childhood fettish where I was not allowed more than
a sprinkle) has been separated from much of the starch in the wheat
grain.

I eat a lot of rice. Brown rice cooked in a steamer.

Meats, include chicken, occasional canned tuna/salmon/sardines, beef,
pork, lamb, etc. Excess fat cut off  (refined   :=)

Bread is a low GI multigrain/wholemeal. I use no fatty spreads.
I vitually eat nothing that is "manufactured in a stainless steel vat
with steam pressure and catalysts".

I only drink powdered skim milk. Have done exclusively for 30 years.
If I must drink full cream or half cream milk (in my coffee) it tastes
rather oily and unpleasant to me these days.

Exactly. There is no celestial purpose in foods that humans are
provided. Plants often want us to FOAD (to anthropomorphise the
situation) and will make any nasty crap to stop us eating them.
Actually, the correct way to look at this is that those plants which,
by random chance, make a toxic substance in their leaves, survive to
continue their species, and thus the survivors today have all sorts of
crap in them. So, we should choose a small amount of a large variety
of foods, thus getting all the micronutrients that we can benefit
from, but avoiding too much of the stuff that poisons us. Of course
there are some fruits that the plant benefits from being eaten. These
are fruits where the seeds can be dispersed with a dollop of manure to
aid growth of another plant.

I don't  go for raw eggs (another childhood fettish where my younger
brother would open his mouth with some runny egg in it and mouth the
word "snot" across the table. He once brought the house down by
exclaiming in a loud voice that he did not like lamb's fry (liver)
because it was full of testicles ( he meant blood vessels, I guess)

Some raw beans (Fabaceae) are fine, some are toxic, and some MUST be
cooked.
