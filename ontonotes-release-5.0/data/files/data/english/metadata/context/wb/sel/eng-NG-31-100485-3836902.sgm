oh and I forgot to thank all of you for the help on my last question..

ok how are the 350 and 305 different besides the power of course like
will the intake manifold off of a 305 fit on a 350 for example cause it
sure looks like it will.....

A 305 and a 350 are in the same basic engine family, as are all small
block chevys.

The differtances are heads, bore sizes, cranks, crank journials, mains,
ect. Internially they are different, and some items DO NOT interchange
(IE 350 Crank in 305, or 350 heads on 305).

A 350 is a member of the 4 inch bore side of the small block family.
This block can take numerios cranks to either rasie or lower the
displacement via stroke.

With a 305 you do not have any options to change displacement other
then bore enlargement. You are limited as in which heads you can run
(they are 305 specific).

When it comes to externials, such as water pumps, mechanical fuel
pumps, accessiories. All that stuff is interchangeable. You can even use
a water pump, pulleys, and accessiories off of a 4.3 V6.

Things that won't work on a 305: 400 Small Block ballencers or
flywheels, some starters, 4.3 V6 distributors (since it's for a 6
banger), and some other engine year/application specific stuff.

Actually there is a 335" stroker kit available for the 305, although
why anyone would stroke a 305 with that small bore and restrictive
head design is beyond me.

And IIRC, actually stroking it is one of the only options (other than
N2O, supercharger or turbo) you have.  My understanding is that the
casting doesn't allow for any significant increase in bore size without
hitting the water jacket.  Now, my understanding is that you could use
the same supercharger or turbo on the 305 that you would on the 350 so
you could put the forced induction on it and then later you could build
a 350 to put in it.  It would however have been interesting to see what
one of those Coates ball valve systems could have done to a 305.  It
would have solved the valve shrouding problem that makes it so hard to
get any real performance out of the poor little things.

A few months ago I was talking with another local shop owner, who does
work turbos. We were talking about my V-8 Typhone 'Clone' Idea.
He showed me some data from where they did a 305 Twin Turbo S-10 pick up
for a customer. I was pretty impressed with the numbers. That S-10 was
in the 10's in the quarter mile. Yet it had been lightened a bit body
wise, and uses a tube frame. Not a driver by any means, it's a trailer
queen show truck with more in audio equipiment then some of you ever
invested in tools.

The problem with cost effective turbo systems for SBC's is they don't
exsist. Gail Banks stopped making them years ago, so unless you want to
spend big bucks for one, your left tying to peice it from Honda Civic
kits, and buick GN parts.

My idea is a simple one. Find a clean 4x4 Chevy/GMC S-10/S-15
Blazer/Jimmy. Switch the parts needed to lower it to Typhoon ride
height, and handling. Convert it to AWD (a simple transfercase
replacement), use a 3/4 ton Full size front diff (to handle the
increased stresses). Use a 400 small block with Twin turbos (one per
cylinder bank) and TPI injection. Parts costs alone will probably run
over $19,000.

Any Turbo system with the impeller at that great a distance from the
engine is going to be a joke. First you have to take in to account the
decreased speed of the exhaust gasses the further from the engine they
get. Hot Gasses flow faster then gasses that have cooled. Not to mention
you will get 6 times the turbo lag with something like this. Then their
is the extra weight issues. I don't care what a chassis dyno says, you
will see the weight in the 1/4 mile times.

I read an article in CHP magazine about this subject.  It seems to be
on the level.  Link below.  Getting the turbo out from under the hood
looks to be a great idea.

One would think so.  And this has always been the assumption.  However
all the reviews I have seen on this say this is not the case however
take a look at this review
http://www.chevyhiperformance.com/techarticles/148_0502_turbo/ about it.
One of the things I seem to find on this thing is that it needs no
intercooler as the air pipe to the engine provides that.  It also seems
the turbo itself is designed for running where it is, and since the temp
is lower at that distance supposedly the turbo still works fine but will
last longer due to the lower temps.

With a 305, you'll want to to limit the intake valve size to 1.94 (which
is what most 350's came with from the factory anyway), unless you buy an
angled aftermarket set (expensive). A 2.02 intake valve will obviously
not clear the 305's limited bore though....

While the storke of 3.48  is the same, the Cranks are not.

Also I hope you enjoy a compression ratio of about 7:1 with your 350
heads. If you used the wrong head gaskets, enjoy the damaged bores as well.

He has a point since the 305 heads have 58cc

most likely 76cc, or at best 64cc before milling...

Oh my goodness, didn't mean to rain on you're parade Charles lol. Just
to 'elaborate' though, I swapped a set of L98 heads onto my LO3, and
tossed it's original swirl port design.

The heads were cut, compression is good, and the block's bores are just
fine.

As for different cranks (in reference to 305 vs 350, as opposed to
1987-up one piece &amp; 1986-down two piece, rear main seals), kindly
explain yourself...

Yeah, the L98 heads were milled. I wasn't seeking too high of a
compression ratio (which is why I avoided the LB9's) because I'm
supercharging it this summer....

First for 350 heads to clear on 305's you have to use the thicker type
head gaskets. This allows extra clearance. Yes .010 makes a huge
differance in such a case.

As for the Cranks, not only do they carry different part numbers for
the same years of 350 &amp; 305, they are different.

305 Cranks do not have as thick throws, nor or they as strong as a 350
Crank. Yes 350 cranks come in a few flavors too (large vs small
journial, forged vs cast).

When it comes to making high power with a SBC 4 inch bore blocks with
either type (factory or machine shop splayed) 4 bolt mains are perfered.
Cost wise it costs less to build up a 350 (from a 'core' long block)
then it does a 305.

I have had people buy both 305 heads and 350 heads for their ideas of
swaps. When things go wrong (not a problem with the parts I sold them,
which were tested used replacement parts), jad these people come back to
me. It's not my fault some 305 heads on some 350's will give you 15:1
compression ratio, or some 350 heads will give you as low as 6:1 on a
305. Nor is it my fault that 350 valves do not always clear the bores on
305.

So with me, 305 heads are 305 heads, 350 heads are 350 heads. If I want
a better then stock flow rate, I call Jegs or Summit and get a set of
iron heads (dart &amp; world products both make them). then send them to a
machine shop and have the seats cut for the valves I chose, as well as
have everything tested and assembled. Even new casting can fail a
pressure check (rare yet does happen).

Im sure if you wanted to spend the right amount of money, you could
have a 305 sleaved for sixty over slug (piston) or larger. You could
probably have the block and a 400 crank machined to work together, and
even get some 2.02 intake valves to clear. (334 CID give or take a few).
For that same amount of money Ill build a 383 with aftermaket heads, and
a large (almost obseanly over cammed) bumpstick.

thats just what I have been told I'll start from the beginng

I bought a 1987 firebird was supposed to have a 305 in it but when i went
to replace the motor cause of a rod knock I find out it is not a 305 but a
350 so i got a new 350 motor to put in (long block) well when i went to put
the oil pan on from other motor it didn't not fit cause it was not wide
enough so kragen told me it was a big block...I guess I should have known
from experience not to take there word for  ___ .. so it is not a big block?
why was pan bigger?  this motor supposely not one made in mexico .....

Whoa whoa whoa, let's take a second here.

4 bolts per valve cover = small block. (centerbolt or perimeter, regardless)

More than that, most likely big block Chevy motor.

If it's a big block then the small block stuff WILL NOT fit.

At that point you'll just have to buy big block parts outright. Aside
from distributors I can't think of anything that interchanges between
big and small block Chevy. There are a couple small pieces that do,
but nothing important.

See what you really have, then check back with us.

There are a couple of other things you need to find out
to identify this engine, and we'll need to know a little
about the old engine too.

One piece or two piece rear main seal? Dipstick on
driver's or passenger side? 153 or 168 tooth flywheel?

It sounds like at least the heads if not the whole engine
in both cases are 85-earlier models. If not, then you
have a parts interchange problem due to a couple of
running changes in small block Chevy over the years.
You might have an '87-up block in one case and a
pre-'80 block in the other, or some other mismatch
that just requires some extra thought to make work.

There are a couple different bolt patterns on flexplates
and a couple different pans. It shouldn't be this hard
to figure out, but parts stores aren't what they used to
be, so you end up with the added confusion of guys
talking out their @ss when they don't really know the
answer to your tech questions.

Let me know what you find and we'll go from there.

Good luck.

There is no way you can confuse a Big Block with a 350 Small Block.
Especially with the cylinder heads on the engine!

If you do indead have a BBC, the valve lay-out it's self will look
compleatly different from that of the SBC. SBC rocker arms are all in a
line, both intake and exhaust. BBC are splaid, intake at one angle,
exhaust at another, so the rocker arms sit staggared.

Not all Small Blocks take the same oil pan. One peice rear seal blocks
take a different pan then two peice rear seal block. Drivers side
VS Passenger side dipstick makes a huge differance as well.  Some
aftermaket SBC blocks have a expanded skirt area and take either BBC,
Olds, or Aftermarket ONLY oil pans.

Post the casting numbers off both engines. Ill see if I can identify
both for you.

&gt;350 so i got a new 350 motor to put in (long block) well when i went to put
&gt;the oil pan on from other motor it didn't not fit cause it was not wide
&gt;enough so kragen told me it was a big block...I guess I should have known
&gt;from experience not to take there word for  ___ .. so it is not a big block?
&gt;why was pan bigger?  this motor supposely not one made in mexico .....

As Charles said, find and post the casting numbers if you can find
them, from the heads and blocks.  Many here have decoding books that
at least can tell you what the parts were for at the beginning of
their life.

Plus, the xfer case and ft diff is, IMO, added weight for a vehicle that's
probably going to be trailer-only. You (in general) might get a little
better timing out of a rwd only S10/15/Blazer... :)

&gt; Any Turbo system with the impeller at that great a distance from the
&gt; engine is going to be a joke. First you have to take in to account the
&gt; decreased speed of the exhaust gasses the further from the engine they
&gt; get. Hot Gasses flow faster then gasses that have cooled. Not to mention
&gt; you will get 6 times the turbo lag with something like this. Then their
&gt; is the extra weight issues. I don't care what a chassis dyno says, you
&gt; will see the weight in the 1/4 mile times.

Why would I waste the cash to build a S-10 trailer queen?
Unless it's a *Race* only vehical (such as a sprint car) Ill drive the
sucker on the streets.

Just because some people are too pussy to drive a 9 second ride on the
street doesn't mean everyone is.

&gt;  Wow. Really wadded your undies, eh? :)

&gt;  The original poster, iirc, said he wanted to trailer it...

No I mentioned in a post about a Vehical a shop owner I know built. His
customer that owns it trailers it. Why? Because of ground clearance &amp;
appeariance items the truck is not legal, not safe to drive on the road.
Built as a show car, Something I will not have.

I beleave cars are ment to be driven, not trailer queens that only see
a few miles a year at outdoor car shows. I beleave if it's close enough
to street legal, and safe to drive, Do it.

Im not saying drive your 900 HP car in the rain, or everyday. But just
cause you run 12's in the quartmile is no reason to make a car a trailer
queen.

I have a Off Road truck that I trailer to and from the trails. Why?
because I aint scared to break it, roll it, or smash it. Yet when im not
going out trail driving with it, I drive it on the streets.

Crap, at least Charles had the sense to say it. Problems with remote mounted
turbos do not out weight the benefits of underhood mounting, remote mounting
may even mitigate some benefits of adding the turbo in the first place. Lag
would be retarded even with a blow off valve. And what about oiling, return
specifically. Pressure feed, gravity return?

Sounds like an ass idea to me. I've got a "tornado" carb spacer you can
stick on it too, says it's good for +50 hp....... so it must be....right?
