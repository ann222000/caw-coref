Both observational studies and clinical trials suggest that higher
consumption of vitamin E and selenium reduces prostate cancer risk.
Vitamin E is found in plant foods, including vegetables, vegetable oils
and nuts, as well as egg yolks. Vitamin E is also in a lot of breakfast
cereals because they fortify it. Selenium is a metallic trace element
that comes into plants from the soil, so it's in grains such as rice
and wheat. Selenium is also obtained from animal foods, because the
animals consume grain.

There is also quite a bit of observational evidence that tomato and
broccoli consumption reduces risk of prostate cancer. In the tomato
products, we're focusing on nutrients called carotenoids, particularly
lycopene. Lycopene is a major red carotenoid pigment in tomatoes. In
broccoli, there are a number of sulfur compounds that are thought to
detoxify carcinogens.

Selenium and vitamin E and carotenoids such as lycopene are all part of
the antioxidant protection system within the body. They are different
compounds, so they each protect different aspects of the body from
excess oxidation, which generates free radicals that can disrupt normal
chemical reactions in the body. If DNA is oxidized ,there is cell
replication that can make normal cells mutate into cancer cells. It is
thought that many cancers are the result of an imbalance between
oxidants and antioxidants, and therefore, if components of the food
that enhance the antioxidant capacity, there is less chance for DNA
oxidation and cancer development.
