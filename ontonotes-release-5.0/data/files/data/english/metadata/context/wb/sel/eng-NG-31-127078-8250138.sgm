So the verdict is in. The vaunted U.S. medical system is one of the
worst.

But there's less to these studies than meets the eye. They measure
something other than quality of medical care.

So saying that the U.S. finished behind those other countries is
misleading.

First let's acknowledge that the U.S. medical system has serious
problems. But the problems stem from departures from free-market
principles. The system is riddled with tax manipulation, costly
insurance mandates and bureaucratic interference. Most important, six
out of seven health-care dollars are spent by third parties, which
means that most consumers exercise no cost-consciousness. As Milton
Friedman always pointed out, no one spends other people's money as
carefully as he spends his own.

Even with all that, it strains credulity to hear that the U.S. ranks
far from the top. Sick people come to the United States for treatment.
When was the last time you heard of someone leaving this country to
get medical care? The last famous case I can remember is Rock Hudson,
who went to France in the 1980s to seek treatment for AIDS.

So what's wrong with the WHO and Commonwealth Fund studies? Let me
count the ways.

The WHO judged a country's quality of health on life expectancy. But
that's a lousy measure of a health-care system. Many things that cause
premature death have nothing do with medical care. We have far more
fatal transportation accidents than other countries. That's not a
health-care problem.

Similarly, our homicide rate is 10 times higher than in the U.K.,
eight times higher than in France, and five times greater than in
Canada.

When you adjust for these &quot;fatal injury&quot; rates, U.S. life expectancy
is actually higher than in nearly every other industrialized nation.

Diet and lack of exercise also bring down average life expectancy.

Another reason the U.S. didn't score high in the WHO rankings is that
we are less socialistic than other nations.

What has that got to do with the quality of health care? For the
authors of the study, it's crucial. The WHO judged countries not on
the absolute quality of health care, but on how &quot;fairly&quot; health care
of any quality is &quot;distributed.&quot;

The problem here is obvious. By that criterion, a country with high-
quality care overall but &quot;unequal distribution&quot; would rank below a
country with lower quality care but equal distribution.

It's when this so-called &quot;fairness,&quot; a highly subjective standard, is
factored in that the U.S. scores go south.

The U.S. ranking is influenced heavily by the number of people -- 45
million -- without medical insurance. As I reported in previous
columns, our government aggravates that problem by making insurance
artificially expensive with, for example, mandates for coverage that
many people would not choose and forbidding us to buy policies from
companies in another state.

Even with these interventions, the 45 million figure is misleading.
Thirty-seven percent of that group live in households making more than
$50,000 a year, says the U.S. Census Bureau. Nineteen percent are in
households making more than $75,000 a year; 20 percent are not
citizens, and 33 percent are eligible for existing government programs
but are not enrolled.

For all its problems, the U.S. ranks at the top for quality of care
and innovation, including development of life-saving drugs. It
&quot;falters&quot; only when the criterion is proximity to socialized
medicine.

Next week: the truth about the Commonwealth Fund study.

You make very goods points.

The WHO don't measure 'health care'  they emphasise * attitude*  to health

I find the old age argument disputable but not the argument against living
in fear of bankruptcy and/or penury if a serious accident or illness occurs
to oneself or a member of one's family.    One of the great things about
American tourists is their insistence on getting value for money spent.
(See the famous Basil Fawlty episode) This insistence has helped to improve
conditions for all tourists.   What I cannot makeout is that they seem to
docilely accept a health system that does not give value for money spent -
this is NOT the American way.

&quot;Your chances of surviving cancer in the UK remain below the European
average.

And only in former eastern bloc states are you more likely to die if

&quot;Almost half of hospital kitchens fail to meet basic standards of
hygiene, it has been revealed.

The catalogue of breaches of food safety rules includes infestations
of cockroaches and mice and used needles and syringes left on meal
trays.

Environmental health reports from around the country also describe
medicines being stored in kitchen fridges, milk being kept in freezers
used for drugs and drinks such as orange juice being stored next to
chemicals.

In all, almost half of the 377 hospitals surveyed failed to meet the
most basic standards of food hygiene.&quot;

&quot;Elderly people are suffering from abuse, neglect and malnutrition in
hospitals and care homes, according to a report by peers and MPs.

The report, published today by the Joint Committee on Human Rights,
calls for changes in the law to safeguard the care of older people,
and for a &quot;complete change of culture&quot; in health and care services.

More than a fifth of care homes have been found to be failing basic
standards for privacy and dignity, with the most vulnerable residents
struggling to eat without proper help, being subjected to verbal and
physical abuse or being left to lie in their urine or excrement.

Two thirds of NHS hospital beds are occupied by the over65s, while the
number of older people in the population is growing such that, by
2050, there will be twice as many Britons aged over 80 as there are
today. Although the committee was told that some patients received
excellent care, it said &quot;there are serious concerns about poor
treatment, neglect, abuse, discrimination and ill-considered
discharge&quot;.

http://www.direct-healthcare.com/mrsa.htm
&quot;Forty-one per cent of strains of Staphyloccus aureaus in UK hospitals
were found to be antibiotic resistant compared with one per cent in
Sweden and Finland and zero in the Netherlands. Israel and Greece were
only slightly better than the UK with recorded levels of 44.1 per cent
and 38.6 per cent respectively.&quot;

http://google.the-news.net/display.aspx?id=921-13
&quot;Despite improvements in recent years, the number of people awaiting
surgery is currently above 200,000 people on the books, 20 percent of
whom have been waiting for more than year, despite a maximum
five-month period being stipulated by the National Health Service.

NHS officials are looking to reduce this number to below the 200,000
mark by the end of 2008, though seem to have a considerable battle
ahead.&quot;

http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/08/070820194632.htm
The findings have implications for the UK government's proposals to
close local emergency care departments in favour of fewer more
specialised centres, in a bid to save lives, say the authors. Local
closures will inevitably spell longer ambulance journeys for
critically ill patients, they say.

In all, the risk of death rose by 1% for every 10 kilometres (6
miles).

To the appalling detriment of the right-wing-whinger-denialists here I
have several times over the last couple of years pointed out that the
USA spend about twice as much as a percentage of GDP compared with the
UK on health care. The appalling beaurocratic/billing/admin/salary
costs of the privatised system are most definitely NOT an example for
us to follow or learn anything from.

Additionally, I have also on many occasions here argued against
several aspects on USA lifestyles, particularly obesity, fast food and
smoking.....all of which contribute to health issues. I have argued
for us to do things differently in the UK.

In the face of truth and enlightenment, even when evidence has been
put into their hands, the right-wingers shy away with their tails

consumers get to decide whether or not to spring for the deluxe,
platinum-quality, emergency operation?  You know, the one where they
give you sterile conditions, your  own bed, and medicines, oxygen &amp;
blood transfusions as needed.  If consumers knew the different levels
of cost, I bet lots of people would roll the old dice and just go for
your basic, no-frills, 23%-chance-of-survival operation, where you
bring your own bandages, take aspirin for pain (if you can swallow),
while one of your relatives cooks your meals out in the parking lot.

It has some problems, but it's so much better than any alternative thus
far proposed that its adoption should be an automatic decision for any
Government in an advanced country. Except for the well-paid ideologues
in the White House, that is accepted truth around the world.

Let's face it Jerry, would you rather be a seriously ill person of
average resources in the US or Australia? If you answer &quot;the US&quot;, you've
shown yourself to be a fool, I'm afraid.

Of course, that is right.    The trouble has been since the !950s in Britain,
that all the pre -war assessments as to cost of such a system were based on
projected demographics from pre-war Britain.

When the National Health Service started up it was very efficient and capable
of dealing with the then standards of health care.   Wartime desperation gave
them added competence.   Antibiotics were just beginning to be used to save
lives that had once been doomed.   Doctors and nurses were highly motivated all
very middle class British and authoritarian towards patients...regimented to the
then military standards with crisp white starched uniforms.  Efficient.

It worked.   McIndoe had been treating downed burned pilots with skin grafting.
It was crude but was a start.   The Americans had developed the Penicillin that
saved so many lives on Omaha beach and thereafter.

A new world of technology was just beginning.    Then the shit hit the fan.
The demographics changed dramatically.   Jamaicans started flooding into
Britain.   They brought their families, uncles and their families.   The costs
over-runs started there first in the hospitals.

The National Health Service since then has  been unable to cope with the
increasing numbers of immigrants and the exponential increase in electronic
wizardry that is costly and requires lots more staff.     I suspect this
scenario happened in America too.

People naturally will take advantage of anything they see as 'free'.   I can
remember in 1958 meeting an American in Britain who had paid his ship fair to
Britain just to get free treatment for cancer.    Now Americans get overwhelmed
by Mexicans doing the same thing.

Yes the idea of being benevolent to all and sundry affects a nation with a
Christian concept of compassion and goodwill  but other factors not thought
about always curdle the milk.
and the bellyaching going on is about the inability of this generation to know
where things started from and what has caused the breakdown of civilised living.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; So the verdict is in. The vaunted U.S. medical system is one of

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; But there's less to these studies than meets the eye. They
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; measure something other than quality of medical care.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; So saying that the U.S. finished behind those other countries
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; is misleading.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; First let's acknowledge that the U.S. medical system has serious
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; problems. But the problems stem from departures from free-market
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; principles. The system is riddled with tax manipulation, costly
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; insurance mandates and bureaucratic interference. Most important,
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; six out of seven health-care dollars are spent by third parties,
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; which means that most consumers exercise no cost-consciousness.
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; As Milton Friedman always pointed out, no one spends other
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; people's money as carefully as he spends his own.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;     Well, sure looks like we aren't as smart as Milton Friedman. Even
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; more embarrassing for us, nearly everyone would have to admit that
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; we've never seen the prices and options list.  Maybe it's on the last
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; page of the contract somewhere.
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;     So, could you explain *very carefully*, how American health care
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; consumers get to decide whether or not to spring for the deluxe,
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; platinum-quality, emergency operation?  You know, the one where they
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; give you sterile conditions, your  own bed, and medicines, oxygen &amp;
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; blood transfusions as needed.  If consumers knew the different levels
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; of cost, I bet lots of people would roll the old dice and just go for
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; your basic, no-frills, 23%-chance-of-survival operation, where you
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; bring your own bandages, take aspirin for pain (if you can swallow),
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; while one of your relatives cooks your meals out in the parking lot.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Even with all that, it strains credulity to hear that the U.S. ranks
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; far from the top.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;   Ye t, interestingly, your beliefs are not the standard by which
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; international health statistics are assembled...

&gt; &gt; &gt; You're asking poor old deluded peejay to explain *very carefully*
&gt; &gt; etc etc.
&gt; &gt; &gt; You really are cruel, Elaine.   Peejay is completely unable to
&gt; &gt; explain
&gt; &gt; &gt; anything especially an article that he purloins from a favourite
&gt; &gt; right wing
&gt; &gt; &gt; pro private health insurance publication like 'Real Clear
&gt; &gt; Politics' (:-))
&gt; &gt;&gt; without mentioning that he has copy/pasted.   Here's the relevant
&gt; &gt;&gt; article:

&gt; &gt;&gt; http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2007/08/why_the_us_ranks_lo ...

&gt; &gt; &gt; It always worth a google search for any post by peejay that is
&gt; &gt; more
&gt; &gt; &gt; than seven or eight words long.

&gt; &gt;   ...oh dear... did not realize that about his fact-lacking posts.
&gt; &gt; So, I've been naive again; just part of being an actual little old
&gt; &gt; lady, I expect.

&gt; &gt;     One of the difficulties with being naive and elderly is that I
&gt; &gt; really can't imagine why - ok, outside of his being tossed a few coins
&gt; &gt; for his efforts - why peej would lower himself to to be part of so
&gt; &gt; despicable a project as trying to discredit universal medicine.  What
&gt; &gt; kind of ...person... wants to defame shared healing and shared medical
&gt; &gt; resources?  Taken together or separately, these national health
&gt; &gt; systems are the largest humanitarian, compassionate undertaking in
&gt; &gt; human history.  This is the work of the angels, or the good guys, or
&gt; &gt; very prudent pragmatists, depending on your beliefs.
&gt; &gt;      Is it something about the fact that pigs don't know or care that
&gt; &gt; the garden they're trampling could have been really fruitful, given a
&gt; &gt; more time...
">

&gt; If it &quot;was&quot; the largest &quot;humanitarian, compassionate undertaking in
human
&gt; history&quot;, there would be no debate.  It is because some believe
that this
&gt; &quot;humanitraian, compassionate undertaking, has some serious problems
in
&gt; trying to achieve what you think is a &quot;humanitaraian, compassionate
&gt; undertaking&quot;, that is the problem...

Oh for the love of...  Jerry, in the building of the &lt;expletive&gt;
pyramids, here and there mud bricks and pieces of stone were
accidentally broken.  As far as we know, nobody demanded that all work
must stop because of this.

The medical care of entire populations is conducted like all the
rest of mankind's endeavors.  Intelligent people will learn and modify
their behavior.  Clumsy or overworked intelligent people will learn
from their mistakes, and modify their behavior.  Stupid people will
continue to make extra work for everybody on their way to collecting
their Darwin award.
There will be improvements, accidents, new knowledge,
stupidities, the occasional stroke of genius, the earnest desire to
get through another week, and a continually enlarging, unpredictably
incorporated body of information and skill.
The truly serious problem of compassionate universal medicine in
the U.S. is the ruthless greed of medical profiteers.  American
medicine was robbed from those who actually practice medicine.  Our
medical system is simple: profit-takers/lobbyists/pols on one side,
and a hostage population on the other side - doctors, patients, and
all - still trying to make sense of how medical care morphed into a
hostile corporate takeover.
What we need is to get our government on our side, to help the
majority grab medicine back from the pigs. What we don't need to sit
and whine about the details of individual medical mistakes in other
countries.
While we're working that out, I enjoy the chance to post, to
talk to other folks who also represent Survival Triumphs of Modern
Medicine.  The thought of the admirable, wonderfully sensible people
who are still here cheers me up every time I think of it.
Or are we really going to let a lackwit like POD frame the
discussion, so that we sit and bleat about the nits in some hospital
linen closet 12,000 miles away?

&gt; It has some problems, but it's so much better than any alternative thus
&gt; far proposed that its adoption should be an automatic decision for any
&gt; Government in an advanced country. Except for the well-paid ideologues
&gt; in the White House, that is accepted truth around the world.

&gt; Let's face it Jerry, would you rather be a seriously ill person of
&gt; average resources in the US or Australia? If you answer &quot;the US&quot;, you've
&gt; shown yourself to be a fool, I'm afraid.

I was &quot;seriously ill&quot;.  I am still alive today, thanks to the healthcare we
have in America.

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; But there's less to these studies than meets the eye. They
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; measure something other than quality of medical care.

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; So saying that the U.S. finished behind those other countries
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; is misleading.

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; First let's acknowledge that the U.S. medical system has serious
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; problems. But the problems stem from departures from free-market
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; principles. The system is riddled with tax manipulation, costly
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; insurance mandates and bureaucratic interference. Most important,
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; six out of seven health-care dollars are spent by third parties,
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; which means that most consumers exercise no cost-consciousness.
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; As Milton Friedman always pointed out, no one spends other
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; people's money as carefully as he spends his own.

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;     Well, sure looks like we aren't as smart as Milton Friedman.
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Even
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; more embarrassing for us, nearly everyone would have to admit that
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; we've never seen the prices and options list.  Maybe it's on the
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; last
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; page of the contract somewhere.
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;     So, could you explain *very carefully*, how American health
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; care
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; consumers get to decide whether or not to spring for the deluxe,
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; platinum-quality, emergency operation?  You know, the one where
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; they
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; give you sterile conditions, your  own bed, and medicines, oxygen &amp;
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; blood transfusions as needed.  If consumers knew the different
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; levels
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; of cost, I bet lots of people would roll the old dice and just go
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; for
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; your basic, no-frills, 23%-chance-of-survival operation, where you
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; bring your own bandages, take aspirin for pain (if you can
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; swallow),
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; while one of your relatives cooks your meals out in the parking
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; lot.

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Even with all that, it strains credulity to hear that the U.S.
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; ranks
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; far from the top.

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;   Ye t, interestingly, your beliefs are not the standard by which
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; international health statistics are assembled...

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; You're asking poor old deluded peejay to explain *very carefully*
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; etc etc.
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; You really are cruel, Elaine.   Peejay is completely unable to
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; explain
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; anything especially an article that he purloins from a favourite
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; right wing
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; pro private health insurance publication like 'Real Clear
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Politics' (:-))
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; without mentioning that he has copy/pasted.   Here's the relevant
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; article:

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2007/08/why_the_us_ranks_lo ...

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; It always worth a google search for any post by peejay that is
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; more
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; than seven or eight words long.

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;   ...oh dear... did not realize that about his fact-lacking posts.
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; So, I've been naive again; just part of being an actual little old
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; lady, I expect.

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;     One of the difficulties with being naive and elderly is that I
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; really can't imagine why - ok, outside of his being tossed a few coins
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; for his efforts - why peej would lower himself to to be part of so
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; despicable a project as trying to discredit universal medicine.  What
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; kind of ...person... wants to defame shared healing and shared medical
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; resources?  Taken together or separately, these national health
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; systems are the largest humanitarian, compassionate undertaking in
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; human history.  This is the work of the angels, or the good guys, or
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; very prudent pragmatists, depending on your beliefs.
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;      Is it something about the fact that pigs don't know or care that
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; the garden they're trampling could have been really fruitful, given a
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; more time...

&gt;&gt; &gt; If it &quot;was&quot; the largest &quot;humanitarian, compassionate undertaking in
&gt;&gt; human
&gt;&gt; &gt; history&quot;, there would be no debate.  It is because some believe
&gt;&gt; that this
&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;humanitraian, compassionate undertaking, has some serious problems
&gt;&gt; in
&gt;&gt; &gt; trying to achieve what you think is a &quot;humanitaraian, compassionate
&gt;&gt; &gt; undertaking&quot;, that is the problem...

&gt;&gt;      Oh for the love of...  Jerry, in the building of the &lt;expletive&gt;
&gt;&gt; pyramids, here and there mud bricks and pieces of stone were
&gt;&gt; accidentally broken.  As far as we know, nobody demanded that all work
&gt;&gt; must stop because of this.

&gt;&gt;      The medical care of entire populations is conducted like all the
&gt;&gt; rest of mankind's endeavors.  Intelligent people will learn and modify
&gt;&gt; their behavior.  Clumsy or overworked intelligent people will learn
&gt;&gt; from their mistakes, and modify their behavior.  Stupid people will
&gt;&gt; continue to make extra work for everybody on their way to collecting
&gt;&gt; their Darwin award.
&gt;&gt;      There will be improvements, accidents, new knowledge,
&gt;&gt; stupidities, the occasional stroke of genius, the earnest desire to
&gt;&gt; get through another week, and a continually enlarging, unpredictably
&gt;&gt; incorporated body of information and skill.
&gt;&gt;      The truly serious problem of compassionate universal medicine in
&gt;&gt; the U.S. is the ruthless greed of medical profiteers.  American
&gt;&gt; medicine was robbed from those who actually practice medicine.  Our
&gt;&gt; medical system is simple: profit-takers/lobbyists/pols on one side,
&gt;&gt; and a hostage population on the other side - doctors, patients, and
&gt;&gt; all - still trying to make sense of how medical care morphed into a
&gt;&gt; hostile corporate takeover.
&gt;&gt;      What we need is to get our government on our side, to help the
&gt;&gt; majority grab medicine back from the pigs. What we don't need to sit
&gt;&gt; and whine about the details of individual medical mistakes in other
&gt;&gt; countries.
&gt;&gt;      While we're working that out, I enjoy the chance to post, to
&gt;&gt; talk to other folks who also represent Survival Triumphs of Modern
&gt;&gt; Medicine.  The thought of the admirable, wonderfully sensible people
&gt;&gt; who are still here cheers me up every time I think of it.
&gt;&gt;      Or are we really going to let a lackwit like POD frame the
&gt;&gt; discussion, so that we sit and bleat about the nits in some hospital
&gt;&gt; linen closet 12,000 miles away?

&gt; Long diatribe, which did not address what we were talking about.

As no one ever knows what you, not we, are 'talking' about, who cares?

&gt; &gt; in the White House, that is accepted truth around the world.

&gt; &gt; Let's face it Jerry, would you rather be a seriously ill person of
&gt; &gt; average resources in the US or Australia? If you answer &quot;the US&quot;, you've
&gt; &gt; shown yourself to be a fool, I'm afraid.

&gt; I was &quot;seriously ill&quot;.  I am still alive today, thanks to the healthcare we
&gt; have in America.

And are you a person of average resources? I don't think so, given your
own self-description. do you think you'd be alive today if you were less
well-off financially? if you lived in Australia, you would be.

Yes,  I do know the history of it.    The British did not give any funding to
develop it...fifty pounds actually!

It had to go to America to get developed.   They used beer vats to produce the
quantities they knew they were going to need.

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;     One of the difficulties with being naive and elderly is that I
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; really can't imagine why - ok, outside of his being tossed a few coins
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; for his efforts - why peej would lower himself to to be part of so
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; despicable a project as trying to discredit universal medicine.  What
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; kind of ...person... wants to defame shared healing and shared medical
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; resources?  Taken together or separately, these national health
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; systems are the largest humanitarian, compassionate undertaking in
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; human history.  This is the work of the angels, or the good guys, or
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; very prudent pragmatists, depending on your beliefs.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Of course, that is right.    The trouble has been since the !950s in
&gt;&gt;&gt; Britain,
&gt;&gt;&gt; that all the pre -war assessments as to cost of such a system were based
&gt;&gt;&gt; on
&gt;&gt;&gt; projected demographics from pre-war Britain.

&gt;&gt;&gt;  When the National Health Service started up it was very efficient and
&gt;&gt;&gt; capable
&gt;&gt;&gt; of dealing with the then standards of health care.   Wartime desperation
&gt;&gt;&gt; gave
&gt;&gt;&gt; them added competence.   Antibiotics were just beginning to be used to
&gt;&gt;&gt; save
&gt;&gt;&gt; lives that had once been doomed.   Doctors and nurses were highly
&gt;&gt;&gt; motivated all
&gt;&gt;&gt; very middle class British and authoritarian towards
&gt;&gt;&gt; patients...regimented to the
&gt;&gt;&gt; then military standards with crisp white starched uniforms.  Efficient.

&gt;&gt;&gt;  It worked.   McIndoe had been treating downed burned pilots with skin
&gt;&gt;&gt; grafting.
&gt;&gt;&gt; It was crude but was a start.   The Americans had developed the
&gt;&gt;&gt; Penicillin that
&gt;&gt;&gt; saved so many lives on Omaha beach and thereafter.

&gt;&gt; Actually, it was developed in Britain, following discovery by a Scotsman
&gt;&gt; and the development was lead by an Australian The US' role was in
&gt;&gt; providing industrialised production facilities away from the reach of
&gt;&gt; German bombs.

&gt; Yes,  I do know the history of it.    The British did not give any funding
&gt; to develop it...fifty pounds actually!

&gt; It had to go to America to get developed.   They used beer vats to produce
&gt; the quantities they knew they were going to need.
">

Stan like normal you are speaking out of your arse.

Try doing some research on the history of penicillin. The Americans could
produce the penicillin in bulk because they had the fermentation facilities.
The Poms at the time could only top fermentate while the Yanks could
fermentatie through the whole vessel iirc.

Anyhow penicillin was a UK thing fleming victor chang and Beechams ( the Co
I  worked for  and was involved in some penicillin derivatives for)

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; But there's less to these studies than meets the eye. They
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; measure something other than quality of medical care.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; So saying that the U.S. finished behind those other countries
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; is misleading.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; First let's acknowledge that the U.S. medical system has
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; serious
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; problems. But the problems stem from departures from
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; free-market
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; principles. The system is riddled with tax manipulation, costly
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; insurance mandates and bureaucratic interference. Most
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; important,
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; six out of seven health-care dollars are spent by third
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; parties,
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; which means that most consumers exercise no cost-consciousness.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; As Milton Friedman always pointed out, no one spends other
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; people's money as carefully as he spends his own.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;     Well, sure looks like we aren't as smart as Milton Friedman.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Even
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; more embarrassing for us, nearly everyone would have to admit
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; that
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; we've never seen the prices and options list.  Maybe it's on the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; last
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; page of the contract somewhere.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;     So, could you explain *very carefully*, how American health
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; care
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; consumers get to decide whether or not to spring for the deluxe,
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; platinum-quality, emergency operation?  You know, the one where

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; give you sterile conditions, your  own bed, and medicines, oxygen
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &amp;
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; blood transfusions as needed.  If consumers knew the different
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; levels
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; of cost, I bet lots of people would roll the old dice and just go
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; for
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; your basic, no-frills, 23%-chance-of-survival operation, where
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; you
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; bring your own bandages, take aspirin for pain (if you can

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; while one of your relatives cooks your meals out in the parking
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; lot.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Even with all that, it strains credulity to hear that the U.S.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; ranks
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; far from the top.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;      Is it something about the fact that pigs don't know or care
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; that
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; the garden they're trampling could have been really fruitful, given
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; a
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; more time...

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; If it &quot;was&quot; the largest &quot;humanitarian, compassionate undertaking in
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; human
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; history&quot;, there would be no debate.  It is because some believe that
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; this
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;humanitraian, compassionate undertaking, has some serious problems in
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; trying to achieve what you think is a &quot;humanitaraian, compassionate
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; undertaking&quot;, that is the problem...

&gt;&gt; &gt; It has some problems, but it's so much better than any alternative thus
&gt;&gt; &gt; far proposed that its adoption should be an automatic decision for any
&gt;&gt; &gt; Government in an advanced country. Except for the well-paid ideologues
&gt;&gt; &gt; in the White House, that is accepted truth around the world.

&gt;&gt; &gt; Let's face it Jerry, would you rather be a seriously ill person of
&gt;&gt; &gt; average resources in the US or Australia? If you answer &quot;the US&quot;,
&gt;&gt; &gt; you've
&gt;&gt; &gt; shown yourself to be a fool, I'm afraid.

&gt;&gt; I was &quot;seriously ill&quot;.  I am still alive today, thanks to the healthcare
&gt;&gt; we
&gt;&gt; have in America.

&gt; And are you a person of average resources? I don't think so, given your
&gt; own self-description. do you think you'd be alive today if you were less
&gt; well-off financially? if you lived in Australia, you would be.
">

Did not have to worry about it, but no I would consider myself &quot;above&quot; the
average in resources.  Having said that, medicare picked up the entire tab.
I cannot remember how much it cost out of pocket but it was around $1,000.
This for two or three days in intensive care, a quintuple bypass (or maybe
it was just a quadruple bypass), and a final operation where they implanted
a difibralator.  I hate to think what the real total cost of all of that
was.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; really can't imagine why - ok, outside of his being tossed a few coins

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; very prudent pragmatists, depending on your beliefs.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Of course, that is right.    The trouble has been since the !950s in Britain,
&gt; &gt;&gt; that all the pre -war assessments as to cost of such a system were based on
&gt; &gt;&gt; projected demographics from pre-war Britain.

&gt; &gt;&gt;  When the National Health Service started up it was very efficient and
&gt; &gt;&gt; capable
&gt; &gt;&gt; of dealing with the then standards of health care.   Wartime desperation gave
&gt; &gt;&gt; them added competence.   Antibiotics were just beginning to be used to save
&gt; &gt;&gt; lives that had once been doomed.   Doctors and nurses were highly motivated
&gt; &gt;&gt; all
&gt; &gt;&gt; very middle class British and authoritarian towards patients...regimented to
&gt; &gt;&gt; the
&gt; &gt;&gt; then military standards with crisp white starched uniforms.  Efficient.

&gt; &gt;&gt;  It worked.   McIndoe had been treating downed burned pilots with skin
&gt; &gt;&gt; grafting.
&gt; &gt;&gt; It was crude but was a start.   The Americans had developed the Penicillin
&gt; &gt;&gt; that
&gt; &gt;&gt; saved so many lives on Omaha beach and thereafter.

&gt; &gt; Actually, it was developed in Britain, following discovery by a Scotsman
&gt; &gt; and the development was lead by an Australian The US' role was in
&gt; &gt; providing industrialised production facilities away from the reach of
&gt; &gt; German bombs.

&gt; Yes,  I do know the history of it.    The British did not give any funding to
&gt; develop it...fifty pounds actually!
">

So what? They still developed it in Britain. Sometimes brains and
ingenuity are worth more than money, blasphemous as you may find that,
being from the US.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; It had to go to America to get developed.   They used beer vats to produce the
&gt; quantities they knew they were going to need.
">

As I said, the US provided the industrialised production facilities. It
was already &quot;developed&quot; by that time. The rest of the job was simple
refining of the process. Further development took place all over the
world once the war was over.

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; the worst.

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; But there's less to these studies than meets the eye. They

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; So saying that the U.S. finished behind those other countries
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; is misleading.

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; First let's acknowledge that the U.S. medical system has
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; serious
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; problems. But the problems stem from departures from
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; free-market
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; principles. The system is riddled with tax manipulation,
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; costly
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; insurance mandates and bureaucratic interference. Most
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; important,
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; six out of seven health-care dollars are spent by third
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; parties,
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; which means that most consumers exercise no
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; cost-consciousness.
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; As Milton Friedman always pointed out, no one spends other
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; people's money as carefully as he spends his own.

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;     Well, sure looks like we aren't as smart as Milton Friedman.
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Even
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; more embarrassing for us, nearly everyone would have to admit
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; that
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; we've never seen the prices and options list.  Maybe it's on the
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; last
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; page of the contract somewhere.
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;     So, could you explain *very carefully*, how American health
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; care
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; consumers get to decide whether or not to spring for the deluxe,
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; platinum-quality, emergency operation?  You know, the one where
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; they
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; give you sterile conditions, your  own bed, and medicines,
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; oxygen &amp;
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; blood transfusions as needed.  If consumers knew the different
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; levels
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; of cost, I bet lots of people would roll the old dice and just
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; go
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; for
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; your basic, no-frills, 23%-chance-of-survival operation, where
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; you
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; bring your own bandages, take aspirin for pain (if you can
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; swallow),
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; while one of your relatives cooks your meals out in the parking
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; lot.

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Even with all that, it strains credulity to hear that the U.S.
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; ranks
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; far from the top.

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;   Ye t, interestingly, your beliefs are not the standard by
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; which
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; international health statistics are assembled...

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; You're asking poor old deluded peejay to explain *very carefully*
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; etc etc.
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; You really are cruel, Elaine.   Peejay is completely unable to

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; It always worth a google search for any post by peejay that is

&gt;&gt; Watson was American.

&gt; He had the initial idea...which does have some importance

&gt; reallly did he?

&gt; Crick did the maths.

&gt; what maths?

The Nobel Prize was shared between three people, two English and one
American.   It should have been awarded to four scientists but the prize is
never awarded posthumously.   The dead person was an Englishwoman, Rosalind
Franklin without whose work the other three would not have got anywhere.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; six out of seven health-care dollars are spent by third parties,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; which means that most consumers exercise no cost-consciousness.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As Milton Friedman always pointed out, no one spends other
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; people's money as carefully as he spends his own.

&gt; &gt; &gt;     Well, sure looks like we aren't as smart as Milton Friedman. Even
&gt; &gt; &gt; more embarrassing for us, nearly everyone would have to admit that
&gt; &gt; &gt; we've never seen the prices and options list.  Maybe it's on the last
&gt; &gt; &gt; page of the contract somewhere.
&gt; &gt; &gt;     So, could you explain *very carefully*, how American health care
&gt; &gt; &gt; consumers get to decide whether or not to spring for the deluxe,
&gt; &gt; &gt; platinum-quality, emergency operation?  You know, the one where they
&gt; &gt; &gt; give you sterile conditions, your  own bed, and medicines, oxygen &amp;
&gt; &gt; &gt; blood transfusions as needed.  If consumers knew the different levels
&gt; &gt; &gt; of cost, I bet lots of people would roll the old dice and just go for
&gt; &gt; &gt; your basic, no-frills, 23%-chance-of-survival operation, where you
&gt; &gt; &gt; bring your own bandages, take aspirin for pain (if you can swallow),
&gt; &gt; &gt; while one of your relatives cooks your meals out in the parking lot.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Even with all that, it strains credulity to hear that the U.S. ranks
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; far from the top.

&gt; &gt; &gt;   Ye t, interestingly, your beliefs are not the standard by which
&gt; &gt; &gt; international health statistics are assembled...

&gt;  &gt; You're asking poor old deluded peejay to explain *very carefully*
&gt; etc etc.
&gt;  &gt; You really are cruel, Elaine.   Peejay is completely unable to
&gt; explain
&gt;  &gt; anything especially an article that he purloins from a favourite
&gt; right wing
&gt;  &gt; pro private health insurance publication like 'Real Clear
&gt; Politics' (:-))&gt; without mentioning that he has copy/pasted.   Here's the relevant article:

&gt; &gt; http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2007/08/why_the_us_ranks_lo ...

&gt;  &gt; It always worth a google search for any post by peejay that is
&gt; more
&gt;  &gt; than seven or eight words long.

&gt;    ...oh dear... did not realize that about his fact-lacking posts.
&gt; So, I've been naive again; just part of being an actual little old
&gt; lady, I expect.

&gt;      One of the difficulties with being naive and elderly is that I
&gt; really can't imagine why - ok, outside of his being tossed a few coins
&gt; for his efforts - why peej would lower himself to to be part of so
&gt; despicable a project as trying to discredit universal medicine.  What
&gt; kind of ...person... wants to defame shared healing and shared medical
&gt; resources?  Taken together or separately, these national health
&gt; systems are the largest humanitarian, compassionate undertaking in
&gt; human history.  This is the work of the angels, or the good guys, or
&gt; very prudent pragmatists, depending on your beliefs.
">

You say that you want to provide compassionate care.  I agree
completely, but you have not defined what is compassionate.  Is it
compassionate to provide free medical care to someone below the
poverty line? Yes.  Is it compassionate to provide free medical care
to Bill Gates? No.

Somewhere in between, is the line that defines compassionate.
Universal care wants to eliminate the line and provide UNIVERSAL care
to all, inlcuding Bill Gates.  However, will that inadvertently create
less compassion?

For example, you are an elderly woman who can get a knee replacement
rather quickly in the current system.  Would it be compassionate to
implement a system that would make you wait, in pain, for 67 weeks?
This is the Median wait time in Saskatchewan, one of the Canadian
provinces; a medical plan that many Universal payer proponents want to
emulate.

Right now, I can get an MRI for either myself or my DOG within days.
Would it be compassionate to implement the Canadian system that has a
median wait time of 10.8 weeks for a diagnostic MRI?

England has an intermix of universal and private insurance, another
plan many want to implement.  Would it compassionate to reduce your
husband's chances of survival in prostrate cancer?  Prostate cancer
survival rate: US  81.2% ,  England-44.3%.  I have no idea if this is
due to a difference in medical treatment or difference in early vs
late detection/treatment.  I will not make any presumptions.  However,
the difference is dramatic.

France has another system that many would like to implement. France
holds prices down with artificial price controls.  The price of an
office visit is limited to 21 euros.  If we have a Universal Single
Payer system combined with a Private Medical system, will the
government pay whatever each doctor charges, or will the government
establish and set the prices to be paid?  If we truly believe that
this is acceptable, then why don't we create a government agency that
sets the prices of ALL wages and ALL commodities???

I agree with you that we need to add compassion.  I just want a
different direction of doing it.  I want to add compassion to those
who need it.  I do not want to inadvertantly reduce the compassion to
a little old lady in Florida.

You've got something against Bill Gates?  To be serious we are not
discussing 'free' medical care, we are attempting to discuss universal
medical care; not the same thing.  The National Health Service in Britain is
paid for out of what you can consider taxes and what we call National
Insurance.  So every wage earner contributes towards health care.  The
equivalent British Bill Gates pays his whack along with everyone else.
I'm sure he would also pay into a private health scheme as well but he is
not allowed to opt out of his obligation to everybody's health.

I addressed that in the latter part of my post.  If we have National
Insurance (what Americans call Single Payer or Universal Coverage),
then who sets the rates?  The individual doctors or the government?
If individual doctors set the rates and the government pays, we have
the same problem as today; what incentive do you, the consumer, have
to seek out a more reasonably priced physician?

If the Government sets the rate, then why should American's find that
acceptable?  We don't have a government agency that sets every other
wage or commodity price.

BTW: you said &quot;what 'we' call National Insurance&quot;.   Who is the &quot;we&quot;;
where are you from?

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; problems. But the problems stem from departures from free-market
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; principles. The system is riddled with tax manipulation, costly
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; insurance mandates and bureaucratic interference. Most
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; important,
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; six out of seven health-care dollars are spent by third parties,
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; which means that most consumers exercise no cost-consciousness.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As Milton Friedman always pointed out, no one spends other
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; people's money as carefully as he spends his own.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;     Well, sure looks like we aren't as smart as Milton Friedman.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Even
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; more embarrassing for us, nearly everyone would have to admit that
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; we've never seen the prices and options list.  Maybe it's on the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; last
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; page of the contract somewhere.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;     So, could you explain *very carefully*, how American health
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; care
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; consumers get to decide whether or not to spring for the deluxe,
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; platinum-quality, emergency operation?  You know, the one where
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; they
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; give you sterile conditions, your  own bed, and medicines, oxygen
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &amp;
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; blood transfusions as needed.  If consumers knew the different
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; levels
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; of cost, I bet lots of people would roll the old dice and just go
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; for
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; your basic, no-frills, 23%-chance-of-survival operation, where you
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; bring your own bandages, take aspirin for pain (if you can
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; swallow),
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; while one of your relatives cooks your meals out in the parking
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; lot.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Even with all that, it strains credulity to hear that the U.S.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; ranks
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; far from the top.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;   Ye t, interestingly, your beliefs are not the standard by which
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; international health statistics are assembled...

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;  &gt; You're asking poor old deluded peejay to explain *very carefully*
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; etc etc.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;  &gt; You really are cruel, Elaine.   Peejay is completely unable to
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; explain
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;  &gt; anything especially an article that he purloins from a favourite
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; right wing
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;  &gt; pro private health insurance publication like 'Real Clear
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Politics' (:-))&gt; without mentioning that he has copy/pasted.   Here's
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; relevant article:

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2007/08/why_the_us_ranks_lo ...

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;  &gt; It always worth a google search for any post by peejay that is
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; more
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;  &gt; than seven or eight words long.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;    ...oh dear... did not realize that about his fact-lacking posts.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; So, I've been naive again; just part of being an actual little old
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; lady, I expect.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;      One of the difficulties with being naive and elderly is that I
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; really can't imagine why - ok, outside of his being tossed a few coins
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; for his efforts - why peej would lower himself to to be part of so
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; despicable a project as trying to discredit universal medicine.  What
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; kind of ...person... wants to defame shared healing and shared medical
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; resources?  Taken together or separately, these national health
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; systems are the largest humanitarian, compassionate undertaking in
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; human history.  This is the work of the angels, or the good guys, or
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; very prudent pragmatists, depending on your beliefs.

&gt;&gt; &gt; You say that you want to provide compassionate care.  I agree
&gt;&gt; &gt; completely, but you have not defined what is compassionate.  Is it
&gt;&gt; &gt; compassionate to provide free medical care to someone below the
&gt;&gt; &gt; poverty line? Yes.  Is it compassionate to provide free medical care
&gt;&gt; &gt; to Bill Gates? No.

&gt;&gt; You've got something against Bill Gates?  To be serious we are not
&gt;&gt; discussing 'free' medical care, we are attempting to discuss universal
&gt;&gt; medical care; not the same thing.  The National Health Service in Britain
&gt;&gt; is
&gt;&gt; paid for out of what you can consider taxes and what we call National
&gt;&gt; Insurance.  So every wage earner contributes towards health care.  The
&gt;&gt; equivalent British Bill Gates pays his whack along with everyone else.
&gt;&gt; I'm sure he would also pay into a private health scheme as well but he is
&gt;&gt; not allowed to opt out of his obligation to everybody's health.

&gt; I addressed that in the latter part of my post.  If we have National
&gt; Insurance (what Americans call Single Payer or Universal Coverage),
&gt; then who sets the rates?  The individual doctors or the government?
&gt; If individual doctors set the rates and the government pays, we have
&gt; the same problem as today; what incentive do you, the consumer, have
&gt; to seek out a more reasonably priced physician?

&gt; If the Government sets the rate, then why should American's find that
&gt; acceptable?  We don't have a government agency that sets every other
&gt; wage or commodity price.

&gt; BTW: you said &quot;what 'we' call National Insurance&quot;.   Who is the &quot;we&quot;;
&gt; where are you from?

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;      Is it something about the fact that pigs don't know or care
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; that
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; the garden they're trampling could have been really fruitful,
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; given
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; a
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; more time...

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; If it &quot;was&quot; the largest &quot;humanitarian, compassionate undertaking in
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; human
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; history&quot;, there would be no debate.  It is because some believe
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; that
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; this
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;humanitraian, compassionate undertaking, has some serious problems
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; in
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; trying to achieve what you think is a &quot;humanitaraian, compassionate
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; undertaking&quot;, that is the problem...

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; It has some problems, but it's so much better than any alternative
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; thus
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; far proposed that its adoption should be an automatic decision for
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; any
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Government in an advanced country. Except for the well-paid
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; ideologues
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; in the White House, that is accepted truth around the world.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Let's face it Jerry, would you rather be a seriously ill person of
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; average resources in the US or Australia? If you answer &quot;the US&quot;,
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; you've
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; shown yourself to be a fool, I'm afraid.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I was &quot;seriously ill&quot;.  I am still alive today, thanks to the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; healthcare
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; we
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; have in America.

&gt;&gt; &gt; And are you a person of average resources? I don't think so, given your
&gt;&gt; &gt; own self-description. do you think you'd be alive today if you were
&gt;&gt; &gt; less
&gt;&gt; &gt; well-off financially? if you lived in Australia, you would be.

&gt;&gt; Did not have to worry about it, but no I would consider myself &quot;above&quot;
&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt; average in resources.  Having said that, medicare picked up the entire
&gt;&gt; tab.
&gt;&gt; I cannot remember how much it cost out of pocket but it was around
&gt;&gt; $1,000.
&gt;&gt; This for two or three days in intensive care, a quintuple bypass (or
&gt;&gt; maybe
&gt;&gt; it was just a quadruple bypass), and a final operation where they
&gt;&gt; implanted
&gt;&gt; a difibralator.  I hate to think what the real total cost of all of that
&gt;&gt; was.

&gt; Oh, that's right, I forgot you're a pensioner. Well, if you'd been a
&gt; slightly younger man, Jerry. you'd have had to pick up that horrifying
&gt; tab.

Not really.  I worked for major companies most of my working career, and
except for the very first company I worked for, they provided free medical
insurance as one of the &quot;perks&quot; of working for them.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; is misleading.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; First let's acknowledge that the U.S. medical system has
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; serious
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; problems. But the problems stem from departures from
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; free-market
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; principles. The system is riddled with tax manipulation,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; costly
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; insurance mandates and bureaucratic interference. Most
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; important,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; six out of seven health-care dollars are spent by third
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; parties,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; which means that most consumers exercise no
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; cost-consciousness.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; As Milton Friedman always pointed out, no one spends other
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; people's money as carefully as he spends his own.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;     Well, sure looks like we aren't as smart as Milton
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Friedman.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Even
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; more embarrassing for us, nearly everyone would have to admit
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; we've never seen the prices and options list.  Maybe it's on
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; last
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; page of the contract somewhere.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;     So, could you explain *very carefully*, how American health
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; care
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; consumers get to decide whether or not to spring for the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; deluxe,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; platinum-quality, emergency operation?  You know, the one where
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; they
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; give you sterile conditions, your  own bed, and medicines,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; oxygen &amp;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; blood transfusions as needed.  If consumers knew the different
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; levels
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; of cost, I bet lots of people would roll the old dice and just
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; go
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; for
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; your basic, no-frills, 23%-chance-of-survival operation, where
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; you
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; bring your own bandages, take aspirin for pain (if you can
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; swallow),
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; while one of your relatives cooks your meals out in the parking
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; lot.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Even with all that, it strains credulity to hear that the U.S.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; ranks
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; far from the top.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;   Ye t, interestingly, your beliefs are not the standard by
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; which
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; international health statistics are assembled...

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; You're asking poor old deluded peejay to explain *very
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; carefully*
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; etc etc.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; You really are cruel, Elaine.   Peejay is completely unable to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; explain
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; anything especially an article that he purloins from a favourite
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; right wing
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; pro private health insurance publication like 'Real Clear
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Politics' (:-))
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; without mentioning that he has copy/pasted.   Here's the relevant
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; article:

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2007/08/why_the_us_ranks_lo ...

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; It always worth a google search for any post by peejay that is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; more
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; than seven or eight words long.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;   ...oh dear... did not realize that about his fact-lacking posts.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; So, I've been naive again; just part of being an actual little old
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; lady, I expect.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;     One of the difficulties with being naive and elderly is that I
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; really can't imagine why - ok, outside of his being tossed a few
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; coins
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; for his efforts - why peej would lower himself to to be part of so
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; despicable a project as trying to discredit universal medicine.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; What
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; kind of ...person... wants to defame shared healing and shared
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; medical
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; resources?  Taken together or separately, these national health
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; systems are the largest humanitarian, compassionate undertaking in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; human history.  This is the work of the angels, or the good guys,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; or
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; very prudent pragmatists, depending on your beliefs.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;      Is it something about the fact that pigs don't know or care
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; the garden they're trampling could have been really fruitful,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; given a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; more time...

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; If it &quot;was&quot; the largest &quot;humanitarian, compassionate undertaking in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; human
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; history&quot;, there would be no debate.  It is because some believe that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; this
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;humanitraian, compassionate undertaking, has some serious problems
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; trying to achieve what you think is a &quot;humanitaraian, compassionate
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; undertaking&quot;, that is the problem...

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; It has some problems, but it's so much better than any alternative
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; thus
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; far proposed that its adoption should be an automatic decision for
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; any
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Government in an advanced country. Except for the well-paid
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; ideologues
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; in the White House, that is accepted truth around the world.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Let's face it Jerry, would you rather be a seriously ill person of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; average resources in the US or Australia? If you answer &quot;the US&quot;,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; you've
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; shown yourself to be a fool, I'm afraid.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I was &quot;seriously ill&quot;.  I am still alive today, thanks to the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; healthcare we
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; have in America.

&gt;&gt;&gt; And are you a person of average resources? I don't think so, given your
&gt;&gt;&gt; own self-description. do you think you'd be alive today if you were less
&gt;&gt;&gt; well-off financially? if you lived in Australia, you would be.

&gt;&gt; Did not have to worry about it, but no I would consider myself &quot;above&quot;
&gt;&gt; the average in resources.  Having said that, medicare picked up the
&gt;&gt; entire tab.

&gt; So you had the benefit of a government scheme and not private health
&gt; insurance.   Why on earth are you so set on depriving the rest of the
&gt; community other than pensioners and the young from enjoying the same
&gt; privilege?

It is not the short term I am concerend about, it is the long term
consequences I am concerned about.

&gt; &gt; &gt; You say that you want to provide compassionate care.  I agree
&gt; &gt; &gt; completely, but you have not defined what is compassionate.  Is it
&gt; &gt; &gt; compassionate to provide free medical care to someone below the
&gt; &gt; &gt; poverty line? Yes.  Is it compassionate to provide free medical care
&gt; &gt; &gt; to Bill Gates? No.

&gt; &gt; You've got something against Bill Gates?  To be serious we are not
&gt; &gt; discussing 'free' medical care, we are attempting to discuss universal
&gt; &gt; medical care; not the same thing.  The National Health Service in Britain is
&gt; &gt; paid for out of what you can consider taxes and what we call National
&gt; &gt; Insurance.  So every wage earner contributes towards health care.  The
&gt; &gt; equivalent British Bill Gates pays his whack along with everyone else.
&gt; &gt; I'm sure he would also pay into a private health scheme as well but he is
&gt; &gt; not allowed to opt out of his obligation to everybody's health.

&gt; I addressed that in the latter part of my post.  If we have National
&gt; Insurance (what Americans call Single Payer or Universal Coverage),
&gt; then who sets the rates?  The individual doctors or the government?
&gt; If individual doctors set the rates and the government pays, we have
&gt; the same problem as today; what incentive do you, the consumer, have
&gt; to seek out a more reasonably priced physician?

&gt; If the Government sets the rate, then why should American's find that
&gt; acceptable?  We don't have a government agency that sets every other
&gt; wage or commodity price.

Do you regard your health in the same way you regard your car?

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Even
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; more embarrassing for us, nearly everyone would have to admit
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; that
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; we've never seen the prices and options list.  Maybe it's on
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; the
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; last
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; page of the contract somewhere.
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;     So, could you explain *very carefully*, how American
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; health
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; care
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; consumers get to decide whether or not to spring for the
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; deluxe,
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; platinum-quality, emergency operation?  You know, the one
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; where
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; they
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; give you sterile conditions, your  own bed, and medicines,
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; oxygen
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &amp;
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; blood transfusions as needed.  If consumers knew the different
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; levels
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; of cost, I bet lots of people would roll the old dice and just
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; go
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; for
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; your basic, no-frills, 23%-chance-of-survival operation, where
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; you
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; bring your own bandages, take aspirin for pain (if you can
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; swallow),
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; while one of your relatives cooks your meals out in the
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; parking
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; lot.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Even with all that, it strains credulity to hear that the
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; U.S.
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; ranks
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; far from the top.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;   Ye t, interestingly, your beliefs are not the standard by
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; which
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; international health statistics are assembled...

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; You're asking poor old deluded peejay to explain *very
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; carefully*
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; etc etc.
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; You really are cruel, Elaine.   Peejay is completely unable to
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; explain
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; anything especially an article that he purloins from a
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; favourite
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; right wing
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; pro private health insurance publication like 'Real Clear
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Politics' (:-))
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; without mentioning that he has copy/pasted.   Here's the
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; relevant
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; article:

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2007/08/why_the_us_ranks_lo ...

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; It always worth a google search for any post by peejay that is
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; more
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; than seven or eight words long.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;   ...oh dear... did not realize that about his fact-lacking
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; posts.
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; So, I've been naive again; just part of being an actual little
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; old
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; lady, I expect.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;     One of the difficulties with being naive and elderly is that
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; really can't imagine why - ok, outside of his being tossed a few
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; coins
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; for his efforts - why peej would lower himself to to be part of
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; so
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; despicable a project as trying to discredit universal medicine.
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; What
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; kind of ...person... wants to defame shared healing and shared
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; medical
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; resources?  Taken together or separately, these national health
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; systems are the largest humanitarian, compassionate undertaking
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; in
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; human history.  This is the work of the angels, or the good guys,
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; or
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; very prudent pragmatists, depending on your beliefs.
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;      Is it something about the fact that pigs don't know or care
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; that
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; the garden they're trampling could have been really fruitful,
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; given
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; a
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; more time...

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; If it &quot;was&quot; the largest &quot;humanitarian, compassionate undertaking in
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; human
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; history&quot;, there would be no debate.  It is because some believe
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; that
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; this
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;humanitraian, compassionate undertaking, has some serious problems
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; in
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; trying to achieve what you think is a &quot;humanitaraian, compassionate
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; undertaking&quot;, that is the problem...

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; It has some problems, but it's so much better than any alternative
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; thus
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; far proposed that its adoption should be an automatic decision for
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; any
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Government in an advanced country. Except for the well-paid
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; ideologues
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; in the White House, that is accepted truth around the world.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Let's face it Jerry, would you rather be a seriously ill person of
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; average resources in the US or Australia? If you answer &quot;the US&quot;,
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; you've
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; shown yourself to be a fool, I'm afraid.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I was &quot;seriously ill&quot;.  I am still alive today, thanks to the
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; healthcare
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; we
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; have in America.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; And are you a person of average resources? I don't think so, given your
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; own self-description. do you think you'd be alive today if you were
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; less
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; well-off financially? if you lived in Australia, you would be.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Did not have to worry about it, but no I would consider myself &quot;above&quot;
&gt; &gt;&gt; the
&gt; &gt;&gt; average in resources.  Having said that, medicare picked up the entire
&gt; &gt;&gt; tab.
&gt; &gt;&gt; I cannot remember how much it cost out of pocket but it was around
&gt; &gt;&gt; $1,000.
&gt; &gt;&gt; This for two or three days in intensive care, a quintuple bypass (or
&gt; &gt;&gt; maybe
&gt; &gt;&gt; it was just a quadruple bypass), and a final operation where they
&gt; &gt;&gt; implanted
&gt; &gt;&gt; a difibralator.  I hate to think what the real total cost of all of that
&gt; &gt;&gt; was.

&gt; &gt; Oh, that's right, I forgot you're a pensioner. Well, if you'd been a
&gt; &gt; slightly younger man, Jerry. you'd have had to pick up that horrifying
&gt; &gt; tab.

&gt; Not really.  I worked for major companies most of my working career, and
&gt; except for the very first company I worked for, they provided free medical
&gt; insurance as one of the &quot;perks&quot; of working for them.

So, IOW, you've been the beneficiary of free health care and yet you
want others to have to pay or go begging to a charity. You're not a very
nice person, are you Jerry?
