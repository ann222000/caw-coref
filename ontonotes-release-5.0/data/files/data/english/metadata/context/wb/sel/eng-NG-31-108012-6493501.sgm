I've been wondering this for a long time as I've lurked for a couple
of years in this newsgroup.  If I ate just a portion of the foods that
I talked about in here; I'd be an elephant.  How do you guys eat some
of these higher fat foods/carbs, etc. and not gain weight?

I just thought of this when I read the deep fried ravioli thread.  I
mean, I have to stay away from ravioli (I eat very few carbs except
for fruit and small amounts of pasta or rice)  So eating ravioli would
be a treat...but deep fried?  I'd really gain weight.

How do most of you maintain your weight while eating a lot of the
foods that you talk about in this group?

AHA!  Something I'm not good at.  When/if I make a recipe that I
really like, it's hard for me to not keep eating it so I"m better off
not making it.  I've always been good about my food choices but I'm
really bad at food amounts.  Back in my heavier days (before I lost 25
pounds on South Beach and 10 pounds from cancer) I would stand in the
kitchen with a fresh, warm loaf of crusty bread with kalamata olives
in it.  I'd dip it in olive oil and balsamic vinegar.  Would I just
eat a peice or two?  Hell no, I'd eat half the loaf.  I gained 30
pounds eating healthy foods and don't want that to happen again!
Maybe I just need some duct tape :-)

I for one don't eat like that every day.  Some days I eat very little at
all.  Christine Dabney and I met up last week and she'll be the first to
tell you just because we talk about it and post recipes doesn't mean we
consume it all the time every time we post about it.  For me it's mostly
about leftovers and freezing things so I don't have to cook during the week.

Exactly right.  If I'd make fried ravioli, I'd probably fry about 20 pieces,
but it would take me maybe 3 days to finish it.  If I make tacos, I only eat
one, sometimes just a half of one.  I'll eat the other half later.  I quit
eating the minute I feel food hit my belly.

Some people have already said "portion control" - but we take it a step
further by only having deep-fried food etc. as a "treat" now and again.
We always trim most of the fat off our meat (I think you don't eat meat.
tho') and try and eat a lot of veggies and salads. However, having said
that, I think it also depends on one's metabolism (if that's the right
word?). Some people can eat more than others without having weight
problems. For instance, I have a friend with thyroid problems - she has
had a hell of a time getting her medication right, and it is still not
ideal -  she only has to "look" at certain foods to put on weight. She
has been on Weight Watchers, and tried various other diets over the
years - doesn't help her much.... and she eats "like a bird". Life is
not always fair, IMHO.

Writing about food here is a way of having the food without eating it.
Generally the posts are in response to a query or remembrance.  Even those
who ask how to cook something may only be asking and filing away the answer.
Also, each of us represents a unique environment of food and food
experience.  We share that environment here and then some of us may make the

Easy, don't gourmandize every day.  Most of my meals are very low fat
and high fiber, I love salads of all types.  I rarely have rich
desserts... my desserts are typically fresh fruits... yeah, I will
usually eat an entire quart of ice cream in one fell swoop, but only
about once every 2-3 months, I don't really enjoy one or two scoops.
You can enjoy those rich foods but not every day... save them for the
occasional holiday meal, otherwise they are no longer special.  I
seriously doubt many folks eat fried wontons (or any fried foods)
every day.  The last time I had french fries was more than three years
ago, ordered at a local steak house instead of the baked potato, they
were awful, shoulda had the baked.  Yesterday's breakfast was two mugs
of strong black coffee, my usual, I typically don't eat breakfast...
for lunch I prepared a large salad, lots of greens, diced celery,
peppers, cukes, a grated carrot, a can of garbanzos, a can of green
beans, a small diced onion, a few grates of parmasean, and bottled
'talian red wine dressing, sparingly... I ate the whole thing (well,
not really, my cats love garbanzos so they had about 1/4 the can).
But then dinner time came and I really wasn't very hungry so ate two
small granny smith apples at the PC.  About 9 pm I got the munchies, a
half dozen sesame crackers with raspberry jam and a screwdriver did
the trick... by 11:30 I was asleep.  I'm sure there are those who do
eat lots of rich foods every meal, but they weigh 300 lbs, and wonder
why.  And with the way I eat I don't need to concern myself with
portion control, I eat all I want because the types of foods I eat
*first* are self limiting.

Exactly.  I got a craving for spring rolls after koko's post.  I went to the
Chinese place down the street and bought three of them.  I ate one of them;
I'll eat the other two in the next few days.  I didn't eat any of the fried
wontons.  Again, they will be consumed gradually over the next few days.

Now, of course, Sheldon has set off a craving for a big (not fatty!) corned
beef sandwich.  There's a local deli chain (obviously nothing like an
authentic NYC deli) that piles the corned beef so high you can barely get
your mouth around it (shut up, Sheldon!).  I can only consume 1/4 of that
sandwich at a time.  So the rest gets portioned out, wrapped up and saved
for gradual eating over the course of a few days.

">

While I'm still working on it, I find two methods help me control how
much
I consume.  First is portions.  During the week this is not hard:  I
bring my
lunches to work, and well as breakfast (food nauseates me first thing
in
the am).  I have containers that are the right size for a sandwich,
several
portions of fruits and veggies, mini-bags of treats so I don't feel
deprived
and gorge, lots of seltzer and juice for spritzers.  dinner and snacks
at
home same thing.  I'll break up my chocolate into 100 calorie or less
pieces,
and allow myself two in the evening.  Dinner is a big bowl of salad,
and
portioned pieces of protein and carbs.  Sauces and seasonings are
almost
all non-fat (tomato sauce, lemon and herbs, salsa, etc.) and if I open
a
box of cookies, my family will make sure I don't eat too many by
finishing
off the box for me&lt;g&gt;.

The other half is I have a list of portions and servings that I allow
myself
each day.  When I have my protein, or carb or fruit, I check off a
box.
When I've checked them all, I have to make do with a few grapes or
plain seltzer.

Last but not least.  Don't grab the box of crackers or whatever and
eat out of it.  Take some food from the container, put it on a plate,
put the container back where it belongs, sit at the table (no
snacking in front of the tube) eat, and then put your dish in the
sink and go do something else.
