I'm about to fully convert to 3.5 (finally!), but everyone (in my
gaming-groups) is very anxious about the damage reduction rules. I
would like to avoid a discussion of what is good and what is bad about
these rules (at least here).

What I want to know is:
1) Which weapons does your group use?
2) Do you end up with a holy cold iron +x and several vials of
Silversheen?
3) Would anyone craft a +3 (or higher) weapon made of normal steel?

Hmm.  My players tend toward things that the pluses, like holy etc.  a
+3 equivilent yes.

Mostly the fighter types just suck up the DR, and overcome it with
massive amounts of damage, if they aren't lucky enough have their
focused weapon already be able to overcome it.

Fortunately that's doable now, DR in 3.5 is in my oppinion infinitely
better than 3.0  in 3.0 it was more of an all or nothing, in 3.5 DR is
an all or extends the fight.

At the end of the day, the thing to consider about the Damage Reduction
rules is that, the reduction values are low enough to be overcome by the
appropriate application of Power Attack and high strength scores (and that
particularly sharp two handed sword).

In other words, the tank fighter with the +3 two handed sword, Power Attack,
and gauntlets of ogre power need not worry about such trivial things as the
werewolf's damage reduction, as he powers right through it.

The people that struggle are the rogues if they cannot sneak attack, and
anyone whose feat choices have led them away from single high damage attacks
(e.g. rangers).  They will struggle, so they may have to consider carrying
around multiple weapons &quot;just in case.&quot;

Transmuting (MIC 45) has been very popular with my group.

before that, they didn't worry about it much.  one or two of the
characters might have a silvered or whatever back-up weapon, but
its rarely worth it.

Didn't even notice that one.  That's interesting.  Although, it's pretty
broad ... I'm not sure I'd allow it to overcome *magic* DRs, only &quot;normal&quot;
DRs.  (Of course, the item already must have a +1 enchantment, so it still
will overcom DR */magic.)  That is, it wouldn't overcome good, evil, law,
chaos, or epic DRs.  And I don't think it can overcome &quot;-&quot; DRs (e.g., the
Barbarian's DR 1/-).  But it can overcome any combination of piercing,
bludgeoning, slashing, silver, adamantine, and anything else I can't
remember off the top of my head that wouldn't be removed by a simple
application of anti-magic.  Of course, the weapon would be useless in the
anti-magic zone, but, hey... :-)

But that's just me.  I like the DR flavour, and wouldn't want to get rid
of 'em all for a mere +2 on their weapon...

Silvered, no.  I don't recall anything with more than a 5 for silver, and
even then, they don't have that many HP.  Having a good (holy) weapon,
however ... when you need a dozen hits to kill something, bypassing 5 or 10
points per hit can reduce the number of rounds of combat by 1 or 2, which
lowers your exposure to being killed yourself.  Our ranger usually switches
from two-weapon fighting to 2h-sword fighting when facing something with a
DR...

Thanks a lot so far.

The DR-thing is quite as I feared, or anticipated. The Holy attribute
seems really attractive to overcome DR, more than the material
component (as cold iron or silver). Not that the material costs matter
compared to the overall costs, if you have accumulated the gold to pay
for the Holy attribute.

To Drow: I don't have the MIC. I can guess how the Transmuting effect
works (thanks to Darin McBride). Could you please tell me the costs of
this effect? Is it the equivalent of a +1, or +2?

In my analysis of the DR (in preparation for discussions whether to
accept the DR 3.5 rules) I made a list for myself, that may be useful
to others too.

The following attribute helps to overcome DR for the given number of
monsters in the MM I.
Adamantine: 4
Bludgeoning: 5
Chaotic: 3
Cold Iron: 16
Epic: 2
Evil: 10
Good: 23
Lawful: 3
Magic: 35
Piercing: 1
Silver: 18
Slashing: 2

I am still interested to read more answers to my original three
questions.

My primary &quot;tank&quot; is an Ascetic Monk 13 (with the Saint template, LA
2) turned Kensai 5.  As an Ascetic character (Vow of Poverty) he is
unable to own or borrow weapons with any special qualities (magic,
special materials, etc.).  As a Kensai, however, he is allowed to
imbue his Unarmed Strike with the properties of magical weapons.  (The
FAQ mentions that while this is technically allowed it should be used
with caution towards the overall flavor of what it means to be an
Ascetic as well as the overall strength of the campaign.  The DM
agreed that the shift to Kensai and imbueing his unarmed strike was
appropriate for this campaign).

The first attribute I put into his Kensai Signature Weapon (Unarmed
Strike) was Transmuting.  After hitting, for 10 rounds starting on the
next round the weapon overcomes all types of damage reduction that the
first target had.  (If you hit a target with a different set of DR
requirements it shifts again a round after hitting that creature.)

Mind you, it wasn't as if his unarmed attack didn't already have
several attributes.  At 4th level a Monk's Ki Strike is Magic.  (The
Ascetic Exalted Strike also does this).  At Monk 10th level it is also
Lawful.  From the Ascetic Exalted Strike as well as from the Sanctify
Ki Strike feat it was also Good, and from the Holy Ki Strike feat it
was also Holy (The Saint template also gives you Holy, but not as much
extra damage).  From a permanent Silver Claws spell it was also
considered Silver.  So he was already striking with a Magic Lawful
Good Holy Silver weapon, and still the first thing I imbued his Kensai
Signature Weapon with was the ability to overcome other types of
Damage Reduction.  Why?  Because we were going into the Abyss where
the toughest standard demons required Cold Iron as well as Good.
(There's a spell to give you Adamantine qualities, but no spell I know
of to give you Cold Iron properties.)  In addition we were hitting
Epic level Abyssal monsters which required Epic Enhancement levels to
overcome their DR.  Again, there's no spell I know of to give you
that.

I chose to go for doing significant extra damage against the toughest
monsters while doing no extra damage against weaker ones.  There were
a number of weapon qualities that would involve doing small amounts of
extra damage against all opponents.  The Collision property costs the
same as Transmuting (both are +2 equivalent). It does +5 damage to
every attack.  The Transmuting will do far less for me on the average.
Most of the time it gets me nothing, since the Magic Lawful Good Holy
Silver already gets through most of the DRs I'm facing.  But when it's
needed it's REALLY needed.  Unlike regular monsters that now top out
at around DR 15 (unlike D&amp;D 3.0 where they were higher), Epic monsters
tend to have DR at 30+ and they have a LOT more hit points that need
removing.  The last monster we faced had around 1000 hit points.  We
dealt it around 850 damage before it retreated for 6 rounds to use a
rod to give itself 6 Heal spells at 150 hit points each and we had to
start all over again (of course, we likewise were healing up to full
during those 6 rounds).  Against such a monster, getting an extra 5 hp
damage from Collision isn't the same as blowing through a DR of 30 (or
40 or whatever it was) via the Transmuting property.

Backup weapon: You don't imbue the entire Unarmed Strike, you can only
imbue identical parts.  So you could imbue the hands, or the feet, or
the elbows, but not all of them.  My character is also under a
permanent Enlarge Person (placed when he was a humanoid, not an
outsider as he is now from the Saint Template).  He carries a large
longspear in his hands (threat range 10' to 20') while his Unarmed
Strike threatens from 0' to 10'.  I imbued his feet with the special
properties of the Signature Weapon so he wouldn't have to drop the
longspear.  He can make Attacks Of Opportunity out to 20'.  The
longspear is totally mundane - but the Ascetic Exalted Strike feature
makes it Magic and Good while the Saint Template makes it Holy.

So his primary weapon is Magic Lawful Good Holy Silver for 1 round
changing to Anything Else Needed Gets Added for 10 rounds while his
reach weapon is Magic Good Holy.  He hasn't used his distance weapon
(a mundane sling) in forever, but it is also considered Magic Good
Holy.

Side note - the Transmuting quality on the feet also requires you to
do Lethal Damage only.  If he wants to do nonlethal damage with his
Unarmed Strike he can do so by attacking with his hands, elbows,
knees, etc.

==========================================================================

Meanwhile, for your consideration, some thoughts from Wizards about
the changes in DR from 3.0 to 3.5

BEHIND THE CURTAIN: DAMAGE REDUCTION

The damage reduction system changed significantly in the revised
core rulebooks. The obvious change is in the new variety of methods
to bypass a creature’s damage reduction: special materials,
magic or aligned weapons, and types of weapons (slashing or
bludgeoning) can all be the key to successfully getting past damage
reduction.

The less obvious change is that it’s generally easier to break
through a creature’s damage reduction even without the proper
key. Most monsters subtract 5, 10, or 15 points of damage from
most attacks, where prior to the revision this number might be as
high as 40. A number like 40 tells players, “don’t even try it if you
don’t have the right weapon.” A number like 15 sends the message,
“You can try, but it’s going to be a lot harder.”

This booklet includes revised damage reduction entries for
every monster in Deities and Demigods, Epic Level Handbook, Fiend
Folio, Manual of the Planes, and Monster Manual II. If you’re
converting other monsters that don’t appear in those books, follow
these general guidelines:

• Make the damage reduction amount (the number before the
slash) 5, 10, or 15. As a general rule, use 5 for weaker monsters, up
to CR 4 or 5. Use 15 for strong monsters, CR 13 or higher. Use 10
for everything in between.

• Special Materials: If a monster had damage reduction bypassed
by silver before, keep it silver unless a different material is more
appropriate. Also use silver for baatezu devils, guardinals, and a
selection of other creatures from the outer planes, particularly the
lawful plane of the Nine Hells of Baator. In a few cases, you might
combine this with good or evil (see Combinations, below). Use
adamantine to bypass damage reduction in cases where a creature’s
damage reduction is almost like hardness: for most constructs,
creatures whose bodies are made of inorganic material, and for
spell effects like iron body and stoneskin. Use cold iron for fey
(often, even when they did not have damage reduction before), for the
fey-like eladrins, for tanar’ri demons, and select other creatures
from the outer planes, particularly the chaotic planes. It’s not a
good idea to create new special materials except in unique
circumstances:  most adventurers have no reason to carry mithral
weapons, for example.

• Weapon Types: If a monster took half damage from certain
weapon types, replace this with damage reduction 5/other weapon
types. For example, skeletons took half damage from slashing and
piercing weapons; now they have damage reduction 5/bludgeoning.
Rarely use weapon types as a bypass for damage reduction.

• Alignment: Allow aligned weapons to bypass the damage reduction
of outsiders of the opposite alignment. Demons and devils
have damage reduction #/good, celestials have damage reduction
#/evil, slaadi have damage reduction #/lawful, and inevitables
(despite being constructs) have damage reduction #/chaotic. Generally,
fiends and celestials associate more strongly with evil and
good, respectively, than with law and chaos. The differences
between lawful and chaotic fiends and celestials showcase in their
racial vulnerabilities to special materials rather than aligned
weapons (see Combinations, below).

• Magic and Epic: If nothing else fits, allow magic weapons to
bypass a creature’s damage reduction. For monsters at very high
CRs (minimum 20), consider using epic weapons instead.

• Combinations: You can use combinations of factors to distinguish
monsters from each other based on CR and overall power.
Many outsiders have damage reduction that combines special
materials and alignments. For example, very weak tanar’ri demons
have easy-to-bypass damage reduction: a good weapon or a cold
iron weapon strikes unhindered. Moderately powerful tanar’ri benefit
from damage reduction that is somewhat more difficult to
bypass: you need a good weapon; a cold iron weapon won’t do. The
most powerful tanar’ri have damage reduction that is even more
difficult to bypass: you need a weapon that is both cold iron and
good. As a rule of thumb, use “or” combinations for monsters of CR
3 or lower, and use “and” combinations for monsters of CR 16 or
higher.

Also consider combinations of magic with either special materials
or weapon types. A lich’s skeletal body is vulnerable to bludgeoning
weapons, like a skeleton’s, but only if they are magic. A
night hag is vulnerable to cold iron weapons, but only magic ones.
In general, requiring two conditions (“and” combinations) makes a
monster’s damage reduction more difficult to bypass, and is most
appropriate for powerful monsters.

And you still shouldn't.  The Transmuting property has a caster level of
only 13, far below what is needed for epic-level damage reduction.  At
least in my opinion as a DM, it might do the rest, but DR /epic is *meant*
to be hard to bypass.

Now, I might allow a higher-level version of it - a Greater Transmuting -
to touch epic DR, but I sure wouldn't allow it for the standard version. So
I think your DM is letting you off easy.

Ascetic characters are specifically allowed to benefit from spells
cast upon them.  He normally is the beneficiary of several buff spells
when in combat, so I don't see why a permanent spell (which, as you
say, can be dispelled) is a particular problem.  Basically, spells
don't count as &quot;possessions&quot;.  Nor do body parts.  Nor, for that
matter, would a Familiar or an Animal Companion or a Paladin's Mount
or a Cohort or Followers.

Yes, Greater Dispel Magic is a threat. He's taken the best precautions
he can against that by making a later Imbued Signature Weapon ability
be Spellblade - Greater Dispel Magic.  This doesn't help him if they
use an area effect Greater Dispel Magic, but in that case he would
only lose one spell and he has some &quot;ablative armor&quot; of multiple Magic
Mouth spells (with trigger conditions that will never come about) cast
at higher spellcaster levels to absorb that.  If a targetted Greater
Dispel Magic is sent at him, the Spellblade effect absorbs it and then
lets him redirect it (or just discharge it) the next round.

For regular Dispel Magic effects he is protected by the SU Protective
Aura of a Saint, which acts as a Lesser Globe of Invulnerability.
Some similar Protective Auras specifically say they can be dispelled
(e.g. Angel, MM1 p.10) while others do not (Eladrin, Ghaele, MM1 p.
95).  The Saint's Aura does not say it is subject to Dispel Magic.
The default for SU abilites is that they are not affected by Dispel
Magic unless otherwise stated, so it protects him completely against
the effects of a regular Dispel Magic.

It's not a perfect defense but it's pretty good.

As a side note - In both cases he's not imbuing the weapon with
abilities to add more damage to his foes, he's looking to prevent his
foes from reducing the damage he's currently doing.  That's not a
requirement, that's just the way he decided to go.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

">

Another point for hairsplitting &lt;g&gt;.  Transmuting transforms the
weapon itself to being whatever is needed to get through that DR.  But
some of the effects that are there are not a property of the Signature
Weapon itself so much as being added externally.  The Exalted Strike
feature of an Ascetic adds the qualities of Magic and Good to any
weapon he uses, even a non-magic one.  Does Transmuting erase the
benefits of the other externally added characteristics?  And if it
does negate them - for how long?  If you model the Exalted Strike
feature as something that continually adds the Magic and Good
qualities to any weapon he uses (including Unarmed Strike) then even
if Transmuting knocked off one of those abilities (as not needed)
Exalted might immediately restore it.

The Holy Ki Strike feat does extra Holy damage as well as making the
weapon Holy with regard to DR.  If the Transmuting feature eliminates
the Holy-to-overcome-DR as &quot;not needed to get through DR&quot; will it also
eliminate the Holy damage?

It's going to be a headache for the DM.  Unless - do you know an
official place where this question is resolved?

YMMV.  I consider permanent spells as, functionally, the same thing as
carrying magical items that carry those effects.  It's not that it goes
against the letter of the rules, but, in my opinion, against the spirit of
them.  An ascetic is the someone who practices self-denial.  You're not
denying yourself a thing here.  *That* is my objection on the matter.

Benefiting from buff spells in combat is different.  It's not something you
ALWAYS have.

Here.  Look at it this way: what is the difference between have a permanent
Cat's Grace and wearing Gloves of Dexterity +4?  Nothing except for the
fact that you're not wearing magical gloves.  That's what's bothering me.

And, like I said, I wouldn't have allowed it.  You're very lucky that your
DM does.

&gt;Here.  Look at it this way: what is the difference between have a permanent
&gt;Cat's Grace and wearing Gloves of Dexterity +4?  Nothing except for the
&gt;fact that you're not wearing magical gloves.  That's what's bothering me.

&gt;And, like I said, I wouldn't have allowed it.  You're very lucky that your
&gt;DM does.

Philosophically, what do you see as the difference between the Ascetic
Exalted Strike (at his level it gives a +5 Enhancement bonus to his
attack rolls and damage and also treats any weapon or unarmed strike
as Magic and Good) and the imbued abilities from a Kensai Signature
Weapon?

Similarly, what do you see as the philosophical difference between the
Kensai Signature Weapon abilities and bonuses gotten through feats
like Holy Ki Strike?

How about all the other Monk Class Abilities or the other Kensai Class
Abilities or for that matter the Saint Template abilities?

He's all ALL SORTS of special abilities that help him and/or hurt his
enemies.  The common thread is that none are being done through an
external object - they are all improvements to what he can do through
his body (and the simplest of objects like his mundane longspear) with
his training.  Should we disallow the damage he does as a Monk just
because &quot;It's no different than wearing a Monk's Belt&quot;?  Should we
disallow his Monkish Evasion just because &quot;It's no different than
wearing a Ring Of Evasion&quot;?  If he multiclassed to be a Sorcerer would
you disallow his spells because &quot;It's no different than using
Scrolls?&quot;

If this actual ability was something that everyone could get through
the expenditure of some cash I could see your objection more clearly.
But this is an ability only obtained through training as a class
ability.  Anyone with the cash can buy a +5 weapon, but only an
Ascetic can make his body a +5 weapon.  Should we disallow Exalted
Strike just because other people can buy +5 weapons?  Anyone with cash
can buy a Transmuting Spellblade weapon.  Why disallow it when it was
gotten through training and discipline just like the Exalted Strike?

His Monk's Ki Strike became Magical at 4th level and Lawful at 10th
level.  He didn't have to spend 24 hours meditating and lose some XP
for it to happen, it just automatically happened as part of his
training in Monk abilities.  The advantage with Imbued Abilities is
that he gets to choose WHICH abilities to imbue - but then again, as a
Monk he got to choose WHICH bonus feats he would get, and at every 3rd
level he got to choose WHICH normal feats he would get, and likewise
all the Ascetic Bonus Feats were a matter of choice.

So really, what is it about this class ability obtained through
rigorous training that sets it so far apart from the others that you
would not allow it in your game in this combination?

Absolutely nothing.  And I have no problems with things that come from
race, class, and template abilities.

My problem is with permanent spells.  Heck, if you'd cast those spells
yourself and then cast Permanancy yourself, I wouldn't really have a
problem with them either, but your initial post seemed to indicate that you
were a Monk 13/Kensai 5, nothing to give any indication that you have the
nine levels that would be required to cast the latter spell.

My point is that, by having permanent spells cast on you, you, effectively,
are carrying magic items (since the only difference is that there is no
item).  You aren't denying yourself.  Like I said, it's not against the
rules, but I believe it's against the *spirit* of them.  Which I would
never allow with the Vow of Poverty rules.

Let's be clear.  I have no problem with innate abilities.  It's the ones
created by exterior sources that are the problem.

OK, I understand a bit better now.  Thanks.  Both Permanent and from
an exterior source.  Now let's split one more hair. &lt;g&gt;

Instead of &quot;Really Permanent&quot;, what if a spell effect was just
&quot;Effectively Permanent&quot;?  What if it was being made Persistent (24
hours duration) and renewed every day - thus being in continuous
operation for days, weeks (our current status) or even months at a
time (we may well get there).  Is this against the spirit because he
is never denying himself the spell?  Or is it OK because there is no
guarentee the spell will be cast the next day by the spellcaster(s) in
question?

As an example: The B2/C2/S3/W3 spell Elation (BoED) is a
non-instantaneous fixed radius spell and thus eligible to be made
Persistent.  In our group the Cleric typically casts this one on
herself (affecting the whole party) and the Wizard/Incantatrix makes
it Persistent using Cooperative Metamagic.  It gives a +2 Morale bonus
to STR and DEX (thus stacking with Enhancement bonuses) and increases
base speed by 5'.

MIC includes weapon crystals.  The &quot;greater&quot; ones require a +3 weapon to
apply.  I'm not sure they're entirely worth it, though.  Well, sometimes,
but not always.  If you have a useful greater crystal, and thus want your
weapon to be +3 anyway, then the other greater crystals have a lower cost
to their use, so you may as well get them.
