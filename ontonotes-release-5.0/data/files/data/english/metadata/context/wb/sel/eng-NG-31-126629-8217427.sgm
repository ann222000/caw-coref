Last night I went to turn off My tanks lights and found my 3 pencile
fish dead as well as one of my glass cats. I noticed the glass cat
about half way down its body has a what looks like his heart exploded.
I have not done anything to the tank yet as I have just gotten uot of
bed, no new dead fish. I'm going to do a big water change (30-50%) As
soon as the coffee is done and has worked.  Does anybody know what
could of caused the deaths or the large blood spot on the glass cat?

I just did a test on the water and is as follows
PH 7.8-8
Ammonia 0
NO3  0
NO2  0
KH and GH ? I dont have a test kit. but I do beleave it is hardish
water
Subtrait is made up of 100% earth(2.5-3&quot;) with gravel on top
Inhabitants: 4 CL, 3 Angels, 1 RTS, was 3 Glass cats, was 3 pencile
fish, 4 harliquin rasboras, 4 ottos and 1 common pleco.
Tank size 55 US Gal

Thanks for your help

Sorry for your loss, how long had all those fish been in there? I
wonder if the angels or RTS were in a bad mood...

Sorry to hear about your sucky experience, Justice. I don't have any
theories to add - Adam asked my first question - how long has the tank been
established, and I'll add the obvious next question, the water chemistry,
especially the pH in your case, has it been stabile - like around what it is
now all along? Temperature? Any recently introduced tankmates? I'm also
curious about the source of your earthen substrate, although I can't see
chemistry or substrate as picking on just your pencils and glass cat. I keep
a group of pencils in my 55 with various numbers of angels, 4 adults at the
moment, and the pencils have been quite healthy for the past year and a
half. They're not speed demons, but they are quick enough to get out of the
way of an irritable angel when necessary. Is there any signs of trauma on
the pencil fish?

No trama on the pencil's that I could see, Although the one lost an
eye about a week ago. and yes the ph has been at 8 since I set it up
with the earth, and temp is at 25c.  The reasion I used earth was I
was having problems growing plants, So Instead of spending lots of
money that I don't have I use a good natural thing Earth it's from
some dirt farm in Ontario Canada. It's been set up for about 5 months
like that With out a problem so far other than the high PH and cloging
filters for the firs bit.  The plants are growing quite well now.  The
angels are new as is the pleco. The first batch of angels I got 3 and
only one survived.  I brought the dead ones back and the person at the
LFS said that they lost almost all of that supply. That could be a
possibity but I don't know what was wrong with them, exept that the
stoped eating and would swim oddly the one could not do anything but
swim sideways and died in about an hour after noticing. the other
could only swim in circles and died a few hours later. The third one
has been energetic and good apitite from day one. I replaced the lost
angels from another smaller LFS and they are like the first remaing
one. lively responsive and a good appitite. The pleco looks fine to me
and my CL show no signs of stress. nice colours.  The glass cat I lost
I could see the trama through the fish as I stated earlyer the fish at
about halfway down it's body had a blood spot of apr. 1.5 cm Diamiter
with streeks come out of the circle and it was in a bent possition and
stiff. I don't know if the pencil's sufferd the same way as I cant see
through them and they are now a part of the sewer system.  But their
bodies were limp.

Justice.
It's hard to say what the cause exactly is without an obvious red
flag.
However, you have introduced a few new fish and there was not mention
of quarantining them.
This is a red flag to me, as you could have introduced any number of
&quot;nasties&quot;.
Hopefully, I'm wrong and you did quarantine.
Be careful purchasing Angelfish. Ask the shop if they're imports or
locally bred.
All too often the imports are bringing in disease with them. It's been
a longtime problem with Angelfish and Discus alike.
I don't think we're seeing the exact same virus in the Angel's that
nearly wiped them out in the late 1980's, but I do have my theories
that's it's either a morphed version of the virus, or a new one that
is similar.
As for the CL's color being good....that's a good sign!
*Note* Please don't flush dead fish. The trash is a better place.
If the fish died of old age, not a problem. However, diseased or
parasitic fish shouldn't ever be flushed.
It's been found that the sewer system is not as closed as some people
may think, and folks were warned not to flush dead fish due to
spreading nasties to local waters.

I really don't know what happened to your pencils, and I don't dare to
guess, but if it's any help, when freshwater angels attack another fish, or
each other, they usually do so by ramming their nose into the side of the
other fish, unless, of course, the other fish is small enough to swallow.
Fish that have been killed by angels in my own aquariums were intact, but
their sides were sunken, as if they had been bashed repeatedly, which, in
fact, I witnessed a couple of times. I can only imagine the internal
injuries they suffered. I'm not blaming your angels, but not ruling out the
possibility.

The pet shop angelfish situation is shameful. It's been going on for a long
time and pet shop owners and their distributors seem to accept it with a
simple shrug, as if it's normal and nothing can change it. &quot;Local Angels&quot; is
not necessarily a guarantee of quality either. All too often I am seeing
some pretty poor specimens that a home hobbyist managed to raise from their
pet store fish that happened to spawn. All too often, these fish should
never be put on the market, the gene pool has enough problems without them.
I'm not putting down all local hobbyists whose angels are sold in pet
stores; I'm only suggesting that the fish need to be examined closely and
the conditions under which they were raised needs to be scrutinized. Yes, it
is known that I have a vested interest in promoting professional breeders; I
think it is terrible that hobbyists have to pay the high prices they do in
order to get healthy, attractive angelfish.

Thanks all who posted. I too have come to the conclusion that it was
fish murder and not tank conditions. And yes it is a sad state with
some stores and some fish out there. I got the first set of angels
from a big chain store.  That I have also had problems with there
guppys. I wnt through 6 to get 2.  But thier prices are good, I guess
I know why now. The other store I goto Is a small local hobbyest (ma
and pa) shop. there prices ar a little higher but I have never had a
problem with there stock exept that I got a male guppy that was
soposed female guppy. The main thing I like about that store is all
tanks have there own filter, and you can't buy any of there new fish
till its been there for two weeks (quarinteen). So I usualy don't
quarinteen thew fish I get from there.

Thanks All

Have a good day

So excluding the caudal fin it sounds like they are around the size of a
quarter or slightly larger. I moved about 15 quarter sized angels for grow
out into a 29 tank that wasn't doing much; heavy plantings, a half dozen
young platies, and some grouchy old ancistrus types that keep to themselves.
When I added the new fish, I did a large, overdue water change, and the
following morning I pulled a dead platy out of the water. Fish deaths are
rare in my tanks. I wondered if my water change triggered an old tank
syndrome thing, but I doubted it. Within 48 hours, all of my platies were
dead, a few I could see had sunken bellies. (Don't let Mellie see this

angels.

Mr. G....
You have some testy Angels.  = O
I've seen mine gut a fish that it couldn't eat whole, but never just
ram them repeatedly.
Knowing fish do learn behaviors from other fish, I wonder if you had a
crazy one and the others went....aahh haa, we can kill them like that
too.
This has my curiosity peaked. I mean they ram each other all the time
showing dominance to lower ranking angels, but I haven't seen what you
are describing.
Sorry about your Platies. That is sad. I didn't want you to think I
didn't care for your loss.
I'm just very into animal behavior and would like to know more about
this.
Has any of our other Angel folks seen this ramming, but not gutting
behavior?
I have several Dwarf Platies in my 75g along with Angelfish. Before
them, Gups, and all were fine.
This batch of Angels were not fine with Neons. They gutted them right
away. They were too old to introduce Neons as a nonfood tank mate. My
mistake, 100% my fault on that one. However, these Dwarf Platies are
just as long, but have more body mass.
How long until your babies are ready to go?
These are the black angels right? Maybe that was a spawn ago.
I haven't seen good black angel stock since my breeder retired 15+ yrs
ago around here.

Ramming was the method of choice when my adult Little Miss Sunshine Koi
angel killed some adult angel tankmates. She's been peaceful since I moved
her to a community tank with no other angels.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt;Has any of our other Angel folks seen this ramming, but not gutting
&gt; &gt;behavior?
">

A couple of the platies were gutted, but I'm fairly certain that the gutting
happened after the kill, a not unusual occurrence among many fish. But the
actual attacking has been ramming, not biting. In nature, a really mean
angel will assume a completely horizontal posture when they ram - making
themselves sort of like throwing stars, (the weapons). My angels, meaning
all from the juveniles to great big Miss Sunshine, will tilt at an angle,
but I've never seen one of mine go completely horizontal. A partially lost
genetic memory, I suppose.

They've been going for a few months to local stores. My web store is
essentially complete, but this week I've run into some hassles installing
the shopping cart and checkout stuff. The prices for shipping, particularly
UPS are changing almost daily, so I'm having to re-think my price structure.
Spying on existing angel dealers, I see that a few have gone to &quot;send us
your address and we'll send you a shipping quote&quot;, and I'm trying to work
something like that into the paypal tools. USPS has not changed their price
for a long time, and they're not adding &quot;fuel surcharges&quot; like the others.
As of today, I checked this morning, UPS and Fedex are both more than twice
the cost of USPS, with the same overnight delivery guarantees. They are up
around $70 for a 12 inch square box. And USPS doesn't charge extra for
signature on delivery or $100 insurance, plus they deliver on weekends and
holidays in many areas. I'm considering offering second day service for UPS
- during good weather. I'm confident my Breathing Bags system will keep the
fish comfortable for days, if not weeks. I'm fine tuning my actual costs, I
don't want to profit on shipping and handling, but I can't give it away,
either.

My current stock contains a few hundred DD Blacks - some dime-nickel sized,
and some quarter plus a little size. My tye die parents are also giving me
some lovely gold blushers and finely finned golds. The DD Blacks are very
rugged looking, like bulldogs when compared to the more delicately finned
golds. I've focused on the blacks from day one; the Tie Dyes caught me
completely off guard as far as their popularity. I only have about a dozen
at the moment, a new spawn is expected this week. Maybe today.

I feel a little awkward talking about the business end of my angelfish
activities here on the non-commercial forum. If the moderators want to
delete messages like this, it's OK with me. I will add the URL to my web
store to my signature as soon as I officially open it.

Thanks Mr. G!   = )

If you could, please post pics of these Tye dye Angels.
I've not seen those.
My dominant male likes to push his status around a little too much.
He's constantly showing it to the &quot;de-throned&quot; king, my gorgeous gold
pearlscale.
He's always coming at him almost fully horizontal, and will ram him
inthe typical mannor...in between the gills and the ventrals.
There's no fighting between them, and my Gold doesn't act like he's
stressed, but I am thinking of moving him and the silver pearlscale
that spawned with him earlier this year.
The alpha male is such a pip squeek compared to my Gold, but size
doesn't always matter when it comes to dominance in the animal world.
Oh....You can email me directly all the pics you want of the strains
you have going.....hint hint.  = )~

I added three to the files area - with cryptic names.

I tried to rename the files after uploading, but Google told me I look like
a virus, (which I suppose is better than an elongated sperm), and told me to
copy 6 letters that I could only read with my glasses upside down. I got
them right, and Google graciously allowed me to re-enter. Sort by date and
check the three newest.
