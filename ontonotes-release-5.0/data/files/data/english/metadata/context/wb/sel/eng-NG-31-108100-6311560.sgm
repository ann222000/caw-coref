Warm weather has returned to Yuma and I think I know what caused the
recent cold spell.  I blame it all on Lon!

Lon talked Bob Hatch into going to Quartzsite again this year and I
remember two years ago Bob saying something about going back to "Q"
when hell freezes over.

Thanks Lon,

Jon

I too blame the weather on Lon. Here in Florence we had record cold spells,
caused by Global Warming and Lon's influence on the weather. Quartzsite?
Never again. I hated it the first time I was there, and it appears that I'm
a real slow learner, but the lesson is burned into my brain, in a manner
that I'll not be able to forget. That would be Mary's reminders about what
will happen to me if I suggest going back to Q again. :-)

I promise not to do it again. I hereby authorize anyone who sees me in
Arizona again during December, January, or February, to assume that I've
lost my mind, and have me taken away by the men in white coats.
Here we are in central Louisiana, and we've already seen more warm days,

I hate being cold.

You bunch o'whussies!  It's a damn sight warmer here than any recent day in
Everett...(:-o)!

And ever since we got rid of you and Bob...it's warmed right up and been
pretty wonderful.  Most of the last week has seen days over 70, and nights
hovering just below 50.

So stay the heck away!  The weather's gotten quite nice ever since you
whiners left...(:-{})!

L8r all--&amp; enjoy where you're at,

I spent a day around Quartzite and Yuma in the fall of 2005.  I
didn't see the attraction then, and I still don't.  It's just
gravel and alkali scrub country.

The only attraction is it's loneliness.  And right now you won't
even get that.

It got up to 74 in Del Rio, where I'm gonna be next week, and all the
way up to 82 in the Alamo where I am at now.
So having fun in the sun can, maybe start filtering north, like I'm
gonna do.
One thing I found out, down here the food is Texican, with the leaning
towards the Mexican part.
Haven't had a good Texan feed the whole time I been down here. Won't be
long though.
A day or two in Del Rio, then on to San Angelo for a few days and some
real Texas steaks. Only thing about San Angelo, is I can't remember
where the Rv parks are at.
Then over to Brownwood for a few days,  I know where to get a good
Texas meal there too. I'll be staying out on the lake at the COE
facility. That is unless I want wifi connection, then I'll have to shop
around.
If the good weather holds I'll venture up to the Vineyards RV park in
Grapevine TX. just north of Ft Worth.

Having fun in the sun.

Groan.  With any luck, in my rearview mirror.

A young man once visited Yuma
To develop a strange sense of huma.
But the sand made him sickly,
So he left pretty quickly,
Saying "This ain't a town, it's a tuma!"

Okay, okay.  "Tuma" ain't a fun word.

How about this:

Quartzite's an Rver's Mecca.
And you gotta admit it's a hecka
Va site for sore eyes
When the gravel-grit  flies,
And your home's being towed by a wrecka.

Very well, then.  It ain't a Homer, and neither am I.  Your turn
at bat, Seamus.

I'm gonna go sit on the pot, over there at the end of that
rainbow.

Thanks LZ, I knew about Goodfellow, but they do not have internet. You
forget easily when you carry your internet with you, I don't. There are
several RV parks over there, I just don't know what they mean when they
say internet friendly. :-(
I am looking for a guy that owned the boat repair and bait shop on 584
after you go over the bridge at the lake. I'll have to call him
tomorrow, hell when you can't remember someone's name from 40 years ago.
Then we partied so much there were times, 40 years ago we couldn't
remember our name.

December and January were what they were, and that was one hell of a lot

We stopped overnight there last Wed and it was perfect weather. It
sure looks different without the big tent.

Tonight we are in a campground off of I-10 exit 42 which overlooks El
Paso, TX, and whatever valley it's in. You can see miles and miles of
lights.

Swear all you want.  Just check the d*mn spelling, first.  &lt;grin&gt;

I cannot recall ever seeing it written in the strip _without_ the 'p' in it.
I also cannot remember ecountering his mama.  I'm a young whippersnapper,

Aside: one of my schoolteachers, in the late 60s, could actually pronounce
Joe's last name.  It was right up there with Victor Borge's spoken
punctuation.

They did have wifi at the famcamp.  The place to connect was at the office

I got nothing - it's Monday morning and I had a busy weekend. Notably
I attended a synagogue 'coffee house' fund raiser with a Jewish friend

Rabbi (jovially):  "I trust all this wonderful food is Kosher...?"

Me: "Nope. There's a couple of pork-chops at this table".

Incongruous moment - the Rabbi with his guitar singing "Oh, Danny
Boy" (the Londonderry air). Awkward moment - magician's mike didn't
work and he couldn't find his prop (a piece of rope). Transcendant
moment - youngster sounding remarkably like Josh Grobin sang

I've had to 'mentor' people and I always felt uncomfortable in that
role probably because I don't take life half as seriously as the young
whippersnappers who think they need mentoring in the first place. My
main advice is usually 'don't worry... be happy' which they could have
got with considerably less effort by simply listening to the song of
