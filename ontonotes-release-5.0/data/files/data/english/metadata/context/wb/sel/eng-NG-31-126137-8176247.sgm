I used to frequent alt.movies.silent a few years ago and would also
post on occasion.  At the time, the group was like a breath of fresh
air to me: a vibrant and intelligent community of online silent film
fans.  There were many far-reaching discussions with thought-provoking
and funny posts and it made me feel a little less alone as a young man
with obscure interests.  After I graduated college, worked for a
newspaper, grew more interested in later arthouse and cult films,
travelled in Europe, and then switched to law school, I lost track of
the group and stopped checking in.  But there were definitely times
when I missed it.

Now, I may be off-base here, but it seems as though things have gone
downhill at alt.movies.silent.  A lot of the people I remember from
the past (Federica, Precode, Vitaphone) are absent.  I don't see any
in-depth discussions like there used to be.  I find this very poignant
and I wonder when and why this happened.

A lot of public forums have gone the same direction and discussions moved to
privately owned PHP boards.

In my view the big problem is trolls can't be banned from the Usenet.

Many of the Usenet boards I used to post to 8 years ago have become ghost
towns due to infighting and other nasty stuff.

Well Eric Miller, first of all, it's summer time and postings are
naturally off.
Secondly, this group seldom gets into making lists and debating what
films are their favorite this or that, like so many other groups do to
fill the postings up with favorite actor/actress, etc., etc, which is
all quite pointless.
Things haven't really changed all that much here.  If you have a
serious comment or question about anything concerning silent film, this
is still the best place to get the most informed opinions.
It's also the place to find out what's playing &amp; where, thanks to
Bruce Calvert's timely posts.

So Eric, what's on your mind concerning silent film?

Right now... Primarily the use of silent stock footage in 30s/40s
exploitations films, and Frank Strayers' The Vampire Bat (33).  I
really want to know what films they were using, why they chose them,
and how they obtained them.

&quot;Vitaphone&quot; (Jeff) here, and still a regular reader at that --- but I too
have noticed sweeping changes since first posting here five or so years ago,
and not for the better.   As someone else noted, the group is frequently
plagued by &quot;trolls,&quot; but I was far more disheartened by the public battles,
attempts to defame and maul --- many of which succeeded apparently,  and an
overall bitter tone that still prevails.

I simply can't understand why a group who's members all share the same
interest and all work towards a common goal --- that of keeping these films
&quot;alive&quot; --- can often be so self-destructive
and hurtful.

Vintage film's worst enemy seems to be it's dearest friends. A puzzle, that.

I first found this place around 1999 or 2000, when it was a tight-knit
group of silent movie/early talkie enthusiasts, many of whom knew each
other. A LOT of quality regular posters. I was a particularly annoying
jackass for quite a while, but eventually learned to shut up and not
get in the way of the people who really knew their stuff. Many--most?--
of these people don't visit a.m.s. anymore, driven away by usenet
trolls and spam posts. There's also the weariness factor--how many
times can we argue Chaplin vs. Keaton vs. Lloyd? '42 Gold Rush vs. '25
Gold Rush?

I have to say, though, that battles over the usual crap--BOAN,
Riefenstahl, Harry Langdon--were just as contentious, and occasionally
hurtful, back in the good old days.

I do remember some condescending and unnecessarily harsh posts, but I
don't think it was ever that bad (circa 2003).  Actually, I look back
on the arguments about BOAN, blackface, Charlie Chan (the aborted Fox
Movie Channel festival), ect. very positively on the basis of the
sheer number of intelligent points that were made.

I also remember some particularly beautiful posts about W.C. Fields,
around the time when TCM ran a festival of all of his films.  And
Wheeler and Woolsey!  Is the author of the book about them still here?
I was probably a little more geered toward 30s comedy (that decade in
general, really) than silents at the time that I used to post.

I really liked the threads with people's memories of AMC at the time
when that channel took a sudden turn from the worst.  If and when this
happens to TCM (God forbid), I would hope to find a similar discussion
here.

But it is nice to see some of the regulars never left.  What happened
to Federica? Harlett O'Dowd?

The trolls are certainly one reason that some people have left.

Also, our audience has fractured.  Message boards like Silentcomedians.com
( http://www.silentcomedians.com/forum/index.php ), Louise Brooks
( http://lbs.proboards24.com/index.cgi?board=general ), Harold Lloyd
( http://pub39.ezboard.com/ftheharoldlloydcommunityfrm1 ), Golden Silents
( http://goldensilents.proboards46.com/index.cgi?board=general ) and the Yahoo
silent groups ( http://movies.groups.yahoo.com/group/silentfilms/messages is
one) have attracted people who didn't have time to read all of the a.m.s.
postings, or who were tired of listening to the trolls on alt.movies.silent.

Finally, it is summertime.  So people are not in front of their computers as
much.

Still, I'm surprised that nobody has posted any reviews of the San Francisco
Silent Film Festival yet.

Fred got tired of the flaming and is moderator of the yahoo silent
film group.

I think there is mostly a fatigue factor here. And these groups, in
sort of google-like fashion, would extinguish themselves, since FAQ's
tend to be reductive, and by searching the group you could find many
prior answers and opinions to the same questions.  I mean--how many
more times is someone going to ask about the same Nosferatu score?

That always leaves discussions of festivals, new scores...things like
that. But I liken this place to a coffee shop, where people ultimately
come and go...but after about 2000 or so, when groups like this were
discovered by new Internet users, not a lot of new blood since, and a
lot of favorite customers have moved on. In other words, we may have
hit the maximum saturation about that time, for silent film fan
Anglophones.

I'm still here, but I lurk more than post these days for many of the
reasons listed by others (missing old timers, fatigue of rehashing the
old subjects, etc.)

But so long as Bruce continues to take the time to post all the
webnews of screenings et al, I'll pop in occasionally and jump into
discussions when they seem worthwhile.

Different people have different levels of tolerance for such things.
Personally, I've found most of the trolls/flamewars here at ams to be
pretty tame compared to those I've encountered elsewhere on Usenet and
various web fora, but they've clearly been perceived as enough of a
problem by many former regulars to have been a significant factor in why
those former regulars no longer post here very often.

Another disruption occurred when AOL dropped their usenet newsgroup
service. Even if many found another way to usenet, it cut off a source
of new-found readers/contributors/enthusiasts.

I reduced my postings when I realized most of my messages were just
wisecracks.

I'm still here, but I don't post as much as I used to, mainly because
there isn't as much stuff worth responding to, even with jokes. And
yes, there is a fatigue factor due to how much you can debate the same
topics, and yes, the online community has expanded considerably, and
yes, sometimes we simply don't have the time, but not all of us have
completely thrown in the towel.

I did go to S.F., but no time to post a report, as I'm now off to my
first Slapsticon. If no one else has responded by next week, I'll do
one.
