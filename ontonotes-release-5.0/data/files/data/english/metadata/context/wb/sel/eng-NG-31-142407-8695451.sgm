US 'used forced labour to build Iraq embassy'

By Damien McElroy in Baghdad

Last Updated: 12:56am BST 10/06/2007

America is investigating whether forced labour was used to build its vast new embassy in
Baghdad's Green Zone.

US Embassy in Baghdad &lt; http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/graphics/2007/06/09/wirq109.jpg &gt;

The 21 high-rise towers on the bank of the Tigris will house 3,000 staff

(This is happening while 1 million Iraqis left Baghdad. May the almighty convert these
buildings to mass graves to the American occupants and their cheap followers of Iraqi
Shroog like AL Maliki / AL Hakeem / AL Ja'afari / Barazani the gangster S1000+)

Disaffected employees have alleged that workers from Asia and West Africa were deceived
in Kuwait into flying to Baghdad by being given boarding passes that said Dubai for
chartered flights to Iraq.

Once on the ground, an unspecified number of labourers had their passports seized,
effectively trapping the workers in Iraq for the duration of their contracts.

Although the labourers are relatively well paid, receiving $1,000 (£550) a month, they
endured harsh conditions on the site.

Federal prosecutors working for the US Department of Justice have taken up the
allegations, which were rejected in a State Department inquiry but partially supported
by Defence Department auditors.

John Owens, an American who worked on the project, said he was handed a boarding card
for Dubai along with dozens of workers from Third World countries who were unaware they
would be traveling to Iraq.

&quot;I felt bad for those folks every day that I was in Iraq, and the feelings just built
and built,&quot; Mr Owens told the Wall Street Journal. &quot;They were basically being treated
like slaves.&quot;

Howard Krongard, the State Department Inspector General, who visited the site in
September, said he could find no evidence to support Mr Owens's allegations.

Juvencio Lopez, a former foreman on the project, said workers were forced to the brink
of rioting during protests over unsanitary working conditions at the site.

Security guards with unholstered guns menaced workers engaged in sit-downs. There were
reports of labourers sleeping 20 to a room and being forced to drink water from the
polluted Tigris when supplies ran scarce.

It is one of the most dangerous building projects in the world.

The forest of 21 high-rise towers on the west bank of the Tigris in central Baghdad will
house 3,000 staff working in America's largest mission.

The inquiry threatens to take the shine off one of the few US projects in Iraq that is
being completed on time and within budget.

Until September, the American ambassador, his staff and a large contingent of US troops
are squeezed into Saddam Hussein's marble-clad Republican Palace. ( To Hell S1000+)

The presence of troops means the embassy bars are shuttered to ensure that guns and
alcohol do not mix. ( Is it ? S1000+)
