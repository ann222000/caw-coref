...with apologies to non-anglophones.

I came across this [in my opinion, at least] fascinating article on English
as published by Webster's. Enjoy:

The history of English is conventionally, if perhaps too neatly, divided
into three periods usually called Old English (or Anglo-Saxon), Middle
English, and Modern English. The earliest period begins with the migration
of certain Germanic tribes from the continent to Britain in the fifth
century A. D., though no records of their language survive from before the
seventh century, and it continues until the end of the eleventh century or a
bit later. By that time Latin, Old Norse (the language of the Viking
invaders), and especially the Anglo-Norman French of the dominant class
after the Norman Conquest in 1066 had begun to have a substantial impact on
the lexicon, and the well-developed inflectional system that typifies the
grammar of Old English had begun to break down. The following brief sample
of Old English prose illustrates several of the significant ways in which
change has so transformed English that we must look carefully to find points
of resemblance between the language of the tenth century and our own. It is
taken from Aelfric's &quot;Homily on St. Gregory the Great&quot; and concerns the
famous story of how that pope came to send missionaries to convert the
Anglo-Saxons to Christianity after seeing Anglo-Saxon boys for sale as
slaves in Rome:

Eft he axode, hu ðære ðeode nama wære þe hi of comon. Him wæs geandwyrd, þæt
hi Angle genemnode wæron. Þa cwæð he, &quot;Rihtlice hi sind Angle gehatene, for
ðan ðe hi engla wlite habbað, and swilcum gedafenað þæt hi on heofonum engla
geferan beon.&quot;

A few of these words will be recognized as identical in spelling with their
modern equivalents -- he, of, him, for, and, on -- and the resemblance of a
few others to familiar words may be guessed -- nama to name, comon to come,
wære to were, wæs to was -- but only those who have made a special study of
Old English will be able to read the passage with understanding. The sense
of it is as follows:

&quot;Again he [St. Gregory] asked what might be the name of the people from
which they came. It was answered to him that they were named Angles. Then he
said, 'Rightly are they called Angles because they have the beauty of
angels, and it is fitting that such as they should be angels' companions in
heaven.' &quot; Some of the words in the original have survived in altered form,
including axode (asked), hu (how), rihtlice (rightly), engla (angels),
habbað (have), swilcum (such), heofonum (heaven), and beon (be). Others,
however, have vanished from our lexicon, mostly without a trace, including
several that were quite common words in Old English: eft &quot;again,&quot; ðeode
&quot;people, nation,&quot; cwæð &quot;said, spoke,&quot; gehatene &quot;called, named,&quot; wlite
&quot;appearance, beauty,&quot; and geferan &quot;companions.&quot; Recognition of some words is
naturally hindered by the presence of two special characters, þ, called
&quot;thorn,&quot; and ð, called &quot;edh,&quot; which served in Old English to represent the
sounds now spelled with th.

Other points worth noting include the fact that the pronoun system did not
yet, in the late tenth century, include the third person plural forms
beginning with th-: hi appears where we would use they. Several aspects of
word order will also strike the reader as oddly unlike ours. Subject and
verb are inverted after an adverb -- þa cwæð he &quot;Then said he&quot; -- a
phenomenon not unknown in Modern English but now restricted to a few adverbs
such as never and requiring the presence of an auxiliary verb like do or
have. In subordinate clauses the main verb must be last, and so an object or
a preposition may precede it in a way no longer natural: þe hi of comon
&quot;which they from came,&quot; for ðan ðe hi engla wlite habbað &quot;because they
angels' beauty have.&quot;

Perhaps the most distinctive difference between Old and Modern English
reflected in Aelfric's sentences is the elaborate system of inflections, of
which we now have only remnants. Nouns, adjectives, and even the definite
article are inflected for gender, case, and number: ðære ðeode &quot;(of) the
people&quot; is feminine, genitive, and singular, Angle &quot;Angles&quot; is masculine,
accusative, and plural, and swilcum &quot;such&quot; is masculine, dative, and plural.
The system of inflections for verbs was also more elaborate than ours: for
example, habbað &quot;have&quot; ends with the -að suffix characteristic of plural
present indicative verbs. In addition, there were two imperative forms, four
subjunctive forms (two for the present tense and two for the preterit, or
past, tense), and several others which we no longer have. Even where Modern
English retains a particular category of inflection, the form has often
changed. Old English present participles ended in -ende not -ing, and past
participles bore a prefix ge- (as geandwyrd &quot;answered&quot; above).

The period of Middle English extends roughly from the twelfth century
through the fifteenth. The influence of French (and Latin, often by way of
French) upon the lexicon continued throughout this period, the loss of some
inflections and the reduction of others (often to a final unstressed vowel
spelled -e) accelerated, and many changes took place within the phonological
and grammatical systems of the language. A typical prose passage, especially
one from the later part of the period, will not have such a foreign look to
us as Aelfric's prose has; but it will not be mistaken for contemporary
writing either. The following brief passage is drawn from a work of the late
fourteenth century called Mandeville's Travels. It is fiction in the guise
of travel literature, and, though it purports to be from the pen of an
English knight, it was originally written in French and later translated
into Latin and English. In this extract Mandeville describes the land of
Bactria, apparently not an altogether inviting place, as it is inhabited by
&quot;full yuele [evil] folk and full cruell.&quot;

In þat lond ben trees þat beren wolle, as þogh it were of scheep; whereof
men maken clothes, and all þing þat may ben made of wolle. In þat contree
ben many ipotaynes, þat dwellen som tyme in the water, and somtyme on the
lond: and þei ben half man and half hors, as I haue seyd before; and þei
eten men, whan þei may take hem. And þere ben ryueres and watres þat ben
fulle byttere, þree sithes more þan is the water of the see. In þat contré
ben many griffounes, more plentee þan in ony other contree. Sum men seyn þat
þei han the body vpward as an egle, and benethe as a lyoun: and treuly þei
seyn soth þat þei ben of þat schapp. But o griffoun hath the body more gret,
and is more strong, þanne eight lyouns, of suche lyouns as ben o this half;
and more gret and strongere þan an hundred egles, suche as we han amonges
vs. For o griffoun þere wil bere fleynge to his nest a gret hors, 3if he may
fynde him at the poynt, or two oxen 3oked togidere, as þei gon at the
plowgh.

The spelling is often peculiar by modern standards and even inconsistent
within these few sentences (contré and contree, o [griffoun] and a [gret
hors], þanne and þan, for example). Moreover, in the original text, there is
in addition to thorn another old character 3, called &quot;yogh,&quot; to make
difficulty. It can represent several sounds but here may be thought of as
equivalent to y. Even the older spellings (including those where u stands
for v or vice versa) are recognizable, however, and there are only a few
words like ipotaynes &quot;hippopotamuses&quot; and sithes &quot;times&quot; that have dropped
out of the language altogether. We may notice a few words and phrases that
have meanings no longer common such as byttere &quot;salty,&quot; o this half &quot;on this
side of the world,&quot; and at the poynt &quot;to hand,&quot; and the effect of the
centuries-long dominance of French on the vocabulary is evident in many
familiar words which could not have occurred in Aelfric's writing even if
his subject had allowed them, words like contree, ryueres, plentee, egle,
and lyoun.

In general word order is now very close to that of our time, though we
notice constructions like hath the body more gret and three sithes more þan
is the water of the see. We also notice that present tense verbs still
receive a plural inflection as in beren, dwellen, han, and ben and that
while nominative þei has replaced Aelfric's hi in the third person plural,
the form for objects is still hem. All the same, the number of inflections
for nouns, adjectives, and verbs has been greatly reduced, and in most
respects Mandeville is closer to Modern than to Old English.

The period of Modern English extends from the sixteenth century to our own
day. The early part of this period saw the completion of a revolution in the
phonology of English that had begun in late Middle English and that
effectively redistributed the occurrence of the vowel phonemes to something
approximating their present pattern. (Mandeville's English would have
sounded even less familiar to us than it looks.) Other important early
developments include the stabilizing effect on spelling of the printing
press and the beginning of the direct influence of Latin and, to a lesser
extent, Greek on the lexicon. Later, as English came into contact with other
cultures around the world and distinctive dialects of English developed in
the many areas which Britain had colonized, numerous other languages made
small but interesting contributions to our word-stock.

The historical aspect of English really encompasses more than the three
stages of development just under consideration. English has what might be
called a prehistory as well. As we have seen, our language did not simply
spring into existence; it was brought from the Continent by Germanic tribes
who had no form of writing and hence left no records. Philologists know that
they must have spoken a dialect of a language that can be called West
Germanic and that other dialects of this unknown language must have included
the ancestors of such languages ...

"/> Nope. The &quot;ye&quot; in &quot;Ye olde Englisshe Antique Shop&quot; is still pronounced
&quot;the&quot; (sometimes &quot;thee&quot; depending on the letter following it.)

The reason why is that it's really not a &quot;y&quot; at all. It's a thorn, an
letter used in Old English, Middle English, and the first part of Early
Modern English. We used to render by typing a &quot;b&quot; over a &quot;p&quot; -- that is,
it has a slightly uptilted round part sticking out from an upright that
goes both high and low. (Dang, sometimes the rule against pictures in
newsgroups makes explanation very hard.)

When formerly handwritten alphabets were translated to type, at first the
type did its best to imitate handwriting, so you would have the short &quot;s&quot;
in the beginning of words and the long &quot;s&quot; that looks like an &quot;f&quot; in the
middle, the &quot;r&quot; that we use now in most places, but the &quot;r&quot; that looks
like a &quot;2&quot; before round letters. You know, all the variations. As time
passed, type was simplified to not imitate handwriting quite so much, but
some abbreviations were kept.

Even though the spelling reformers of the 18C managed to replace the
thorn with &quot;th&quot; in most places, it held on, especially at the beginning
of a sentence for quite a long time, because, let's face it, it is more
graceful.

And then, when people started getting romantic about the past (quite a
fad for Anglo-Saxon [= Old English] in the seventeenth century) people
would write &quot;ye&quot; for &quot;the&quot; because it looks more like the thorn-e (see
the history post that started all this for beautifully rendered thorns).
And then people started pronouncing it &quot;ye&quot; out of pure ignorance.

Which brings us up to the present.

So, properly &quot;ye olde Englisshe coffee-shoppe&quot; should be pronounced &quot;the
old English coffee-shop&quot; but if you are being silly or cutesy (which none
of us in rec.antiques ever is), you would say &quot;ye oldie Englishy
coffee-shoppy.&quot;

Has anyone else noticed the recent introduction of infection into English?
There is a raising of pitch towrds the end of sentence, as if the speaker
were asking a questioin, when the speaker is making a statement of which
he is uncertain. It is annoying and sounds very much like a puppy begging
not to be slapped down. As far as I can tell this has happened in the time
between the Valley Girl phenmenon and now. It is not as unusual as it was,
but I feverently hope that it does not spread further.

Another good read on the subject is 'Albion's seed: four british folkways in
America' by David Fisher. It traces american regional dialects along with
many other cultural differences in early american life with immigration
patterns from England. Every wonder who the heck thought up that southern
drawl or the boston accent? Their origins were quite early in american
history.

Hello,

A year or so ago I once was striving to win an argument with a Swedish
customer that I
was producing a web site for. He seemed to prefer British english to
American english and American english is obviously the most
internationally used english and many foreigners I have spoken with
through the years say that American english is easier to understand and
grasp then British english.

So I went and asked a few linguists and they said the
purest/oldest/untainted/uninfluenced forms of english geographically lie
in isolated parts of the USA and Canada.

The english spoken in the 17th century probably doesn't sound like the
British english
spoken today. Maybe they sounded similar to present day Americans from
New England?
Who knows we didn't have tape recorders then.

So on a daily basis our mutually dynamic language changes!

Kathleen

English is a widely evolving language. Many North American dialects have
&quot;adapted&quot; other influences and may appear almost unintelligible to most
Anglophones.

One of my favorites is Gullah, a creole form of English, indigenous to the
Sea Islands of South Carolina and Georgia. Like all creoles, Gullah began
as a pidgin language, transforming into a language in its own right with the
first generation born in America. A similar form of plantation creole may
have been widespread at one time in the southern United States, but Gullah
now differs from other African-American dialects of English (which do not
vary greatly from the standard syntax, pronunciation and vocabulary). Most
of Gullah vocabulary is of English origin, but the grammar and major
elements of pronunciation come from a number of West African language, such
as Ewe, Mandinka, Igbo, Twi and Yoruba. The name, &quot;Gullah&quot;, itself probably
derives from &quot;Angola&quot; (and possibly from the large number of slaves who
arrived from that part of Africa in the early 1800s). &quot;Geechee&quot; -- another
name for the language and culture of black Sea Islanders -- comes from a
tribal name in Liberia. Traditions, language and myth stayed longer with
the coastal Carolina Gullahs, who were allowed a greater latitude of
self-sufficiency and were relatively isolated on the Sea Islands. If you
ever find yourself in Charleston, head over to Beaufort and go out to the
islands. The food is fantastic! The language is hypnotic. The crafts are
remarkable in their honesty and form - quilts and sweetgrass baskets. One
of my favorite pieces in my collection is a c.1910 postcard of Gullah men
fashioning sweetgrass baskets at Penn School, founded in 1862 on St. Helena
Island as a school for freed slaves.

Some Gullah for y'all:

beat on ayun: &quot;mechanic&quot;; literally, &quot;beat-on-iron&quot;
troot ma-wt: &quot;a truthful person&quot;; literally, &quot;truth mouth&quot;
hush ma-wt: &quot;hush mouth&quot;; literally, &quot;hush mouth&quot;
sho ded: &quot;cemetery&quot;; literally, &quot;sure dead&quot;
tebl tappa: &quot;preacher&quot;; literally, &quot;table-tapper&quot;
ty oonuh ma-wt: &quot;Hush, stop talking&quot;; literally, &quot;Tie your mouth&quot;
krak teet: &quot;to speak&quot;; literally, &quot;crack teeth&quot;
i han shaht pay-shun: &quot;He steals&quot;; literally, &quot;His hand is short of
patience&quot;

Whatever its fate as a living vernacular, Gullah will live on with the
general public as the language of Uncle Remus in Joel Chandler Harris's
Bre'r Rabbit tales and the fiction of South Carolina's Ambrose E. Gonzales.

Purest? If you understood Rich's quotation at all, it should be clear
that English has hardly been pure most of the centuries it's been spoken.
If you mean that there are isolated areas of the US and Canada where you
can find English being spoken as it was when America was first settled,
then that's closer to being accurate. Back about 25-30 years ago, when
linguists studied extremely isolated communities in the Appalachians
speaking a peculiar dialect, they hypothesized that the residents' speech
had changed very little from the time the settlement was made. (I've
heard their English described as Elizabethan, but that would be a little
early, considering that the queen died in what, 1602? So I suppose
Jacobean would be closer...)

I hardly think that using this &quot;purer&quot; form of English would be a very
effective way of communicating with others who speak English only as a
second language -- it's not easy for *native* speakers to understand,
whether they're from London or Houston. English as we USians speak it has
evolved as far away from that Appalachian dialect as British English has.

Personally, I find that careful study of Black Adder, Monty Python, Are
You Being Served, and Fawlty Towers, along with judicious doses of East
Enders, will do a lot for USians' understanding of our common tongue as
it's spoken on the other side of the Pond...

I mentioned in an earlier post, the Appalachian region received a large number
of Scot-Irish immigrants, as well as people from the midlands (?) of England,
the border area between England and Scotland. Andrew Jackson was the first
U.S. president from this cultural group. It is thought that the log cabin was
derived from the housing these people were used to build before immigration.

Bollocks, literally, are the male testes. In the vernacular, it's a word
that means 'rubbish' or 'total nonsense'. Something referred to as ' a
load of old bollocks' is simply nonsense, not true, rubbish, gibberish,
mistaken, etc. etc. Common usage is: 'He's talking bollocks'. It's a
very emphatic word.

a gentleman should never do except intentionally.

Another fun thing: In Old English and the beginning of Middle,
it was &quot;thou,thee&quot; for singular and &quot;ye,you&quot; for plural. Except that one
used the plural to show respect for superiors. As time went on, people
were using the singular only for intimates and inferiors (much as happens
with Spanish &quot;tu&quot; vs. &quot;usted.&quot;) &quot;SIr Gawain and the Green Knight&quot; has a
marvelous passage in which a lady is trying to seduce the pure knight,
and he shows he is tempted by switching from the formal &quot;ye&quot; to the
intimate &quot;thou.&quot; But then the contrary mode appeared, of sarcastically
using the formal/superior plural to insult an uppity child or servant.

By Modern English proper everybody essentially said &quot;to hell with it&quot; and
used &quot;you&quot; for everything.

Frankly, I think we missed the boat. The Southern USian &quot;y'all&quot; is a
very valuable distinction.

section with good exhibits of the traditional Ulster cottage complete with

North and re-built at this park) and the &quot;New World&quot; exhibits, showing the
type of log cabins built by these immigrants when they arrived in America, the
log cabins are of course not original, but only re-constructions :)

&gt;&gt; in `Ring Around the Rosies', does `pocket full of posies' refer to
&gt;&gt; signet rings, or the flower?

&gt;This is a VERY old nursery rhyme, and dates waaaaay back to the Black

&gt;full it's:

&gt;Ring-a-ring o'roses,
&gt;A pocket full of posies
&gt;A-tishoo! A-tishoo!
&gt;We all fall down

&gt;The ring o' roses refers to the rash characteristic of Bubonic Plague.
&gt;It was believed that carrying flowers would ward off disease (posies),
&gt;sneezing was also a symptom of BP, and of course, falling down means
&gt;death.

"/> I'd always assumed that they were dancing around a pile of bodies
(ring around the rosies), and that they had pocketed the rings of the
dead (pocket full of posies), and had gotten just a little too close
(ashes, ashes, we all fall down)

Besides, I thought it was Pneumonic Plague that was the Black
Death...fleas just aren't that good of a vector for plagues

closely linked to the first, is that the speaker is desperate for
positive feedback -- and it makes me wonder why the speaker is so

But Louden, now that I think on it, you may be correct. It's a form of
shorthand for sloppy thinking and sloppy speaking, obviating the need
for a complete, comprehensible sentence.

"/> Hi Laurie-
Didn't think I'd have to question one of your posts, but the song's history is
much in dispute- In the &quot;Oxford Dictionary of Nursery Rhymes&quot; they question the
history and say it dates back only to 1881 when it first appeared in Kate
Greenaway's Mother Goose. Also challenged in the 1961 book &quot;The Plague and the
Fire&quot; by by James Leasor. Seems to have been part of a game called
&quot;Ring-A-Ring-A- Roses of that period. Same comments are in &quot;The Annotated
Mother Goose&quot; but if you have some other data it would be a lot better than
discussing 1930 fridges.

The following is an article sent to be by a pal, I've have no idea who the
original author was, and I apologize for the length of the post but *some*
folk in the ng may find it a bit of crack. :)

///////////////////////COPY///////////////////////

&quot;The Ulster accent has always been an effective cordon sanitaire around the
province,&quot; a British critic wrote with some hauteur under the heading ...
.
&quot;Wurr are they nah?&quot;

Some of the conversations I had in Belfast were by no means as simply heard as
they may read - although generally people made allowances for me and saved the
poetry for each other. But the accent alone could be no end of a mystery. It's
simply enough to come to terms with feg and geg for cigarette and joke, but
some of the pronunciation foxed me for months, and even then I couldn't get a
foothold on some accents. People speak differently, I was told, even in this
part of Belfast or that. Nothing to do with Protestants and Catholics, who
talk alike despite little opportunity to hear each other.

Film is fillum and flowers are flahrs without regard to tribe. But Catholics
from the Falls swore they could tell a Catholic from the Short Strand, a mile
away, by the accent. I couldn't distinguish, I was just banjaxed, as they say,
by the vowels, whoever was using them, especially &quot;ow&quot;. &quot;The Clyde has
lifted,&quot; someone said, then lost me for paragraphs as I tried to work out how.

Mound is mind and now is nigh and sound is signed and I'll never live it dine.
High nigh brine cie. For that matter, wise is ways and time is tame, and there
is thar so whar is up the stars? Sammy is Sommy and Barry is Borry and he's
hoppy as Lorry. Poor is pure. The unemployed, I was told, &quot;indulge in the
purest kind of sex.&quot; Purest? &quot;You know, in the ditch,&quot; was the answer.

Many Cockneys think that Northern Irish is the ugliest English to be heard,
but that may be to draw attention away from their own. I found Belfast English
lilting and lyrical, inventive and funny - and optimistic, because of the
upward inflexion, suggesting doubt or paradox, at the end of most sentences.

Threats or imprecations are less than convincing when the tune is so opposed
to the message, and it's even head to sound grossly pompous - despite the
hideous overwork given to the cliches &quot;grasping the nettle&quot;, &quot;taking the bull
by the horns&quot;, &quot;standing up to be counted&quot;, and &quot;nailing his colours to the
mast&quot;. (Of these, the first two often tended to be what Catholics said other
people ought to do, and the latter two what Protestants said they themselves
did.)

One of the commonest words is &quot;crack&quot;. There is no direct translation, which
is what makes it such a good word. &quot;What's the crack?&quot;&quot;You know the crack
yerself.&quot;&quot;He was sayin' til us about the Chinese, and all this here crack.&quot;
&quot;Then yer mon joined in the crack.&quot;&quot;This is deadly crack.&quot;&quot;The crack was
90!&quot; (best crack; no one knew why it scored 90). Or, as one of the incredibly
rude horoscopes that are printed in one Sunday paper had it: &quot;If an affair is
more complication than crack, then find some friends who are as shallow and
insincere as yourself.&quot; The crack in Belfast (the big smoke) is *magic*. (The
opposite of magic is *desperate*.)

People greet each other: &quot;What about ye?&quot; and sign off &quot;Alla best!&quot; or &quot;Safe
home!&quot;&quot;C'mere till I tell ye,&quot; starts the yarn. &quot;What do you reckon - the
carry-on in this dunderin' place we live in! Sometimes it sickens the heart
outta me&quot; (or makes me heart-feared, or heart-scared). All right, nothing too
complicated about that. But what's &quot;On the pig's back&quot;? &quot;Doing fine.&quot; Right.
&quot;Wee buns&quot;? &quot;No problem.&quot; Yes. &quot;Looking away&quot;? &quot;Doing a line.&quot; Eh? &quot;Having a
bit on the side.&quot; Got it. How about &quot;a looter&quot;? &quot;A dig.&quot; A dig? &quot;You know, a
swipe in the gub.&quot;

Oh. Some people lived in kitchen houses, but the kitchen was the living room
and the place where you cooked was the scullery or working kitchen which
contained the jawbox (sink). He hopped himself well up (dressed warmly) to go
out for the messages (shopping). Then one thing led to another and all this
caper and carry-on and whenever he stopped at the pub, he hoovered up five
pints and got poleaxed (jarred, puddled, punctured, paladic, plucked, blocked,
blitzed, snattered, stocious, steamboats, elephantsed, arsified, blootered,
lockjawed, or merely full).

&quot;You know what yer mon's like, like.&quot; - &quot;Och aye. Not a titter of wit.&quot;&quot;Did
you get the sausingers but?&quot; - &quot;I'm only after goin' til the shop so.&quot; (&quot;But&quot;,
&quot;so&quot;, and &quot;just&quot; perch on the ends of all kinds of sentences. &quot;To&quot; is nearly
always &quot;til&quot;, &quot;when&quot; is &quot;whenever&quot; and &quot;them&quot; is often &quot;them'uns&quot;.) &quot;Catch
yourself on! Go you back now.&quot;&quot;I'm busy at the minute but.&quot;&quot;Man dear, I seen
the day you hadn't a knicker on your arse and now you got some money you're
drinkin' it!&quot;&quot;I could see you far enough!&quot;

A child is a wain, which just has to come from &quot;wee one&quot;, yet you often hear
&quot;wee wain&quot;. &quot;He's a boul' wee divil, right enough. And he's always gurnin'&quot;
(wailing). &quot;Sure your hands are absolutely mingering, go you and wash!
Would you stop runnin' around like a clarty wee gyp or I'll give you a looter,
so I will.&quot;&quot;Lord fuckin' love 'im like, he's a dacent spud, he's dead sound,
dead on, he's beezer (brilliant).&quot;&quot;He's a Billy Whizz, a real gamester.&quot; On
the other hand he's sleekit, narky, culchie tulip, a gansh or a glipe or an
aleckadoo, in fact he's beezer (an eejit - idiot).

Wait a minute, someone on the other side of town said beezer meant
&quot;brilliant&quot;. &quot;See, we can't agree on anything.&quot; When you are on the broo
(unemployed) what is there to do but dander about? To be arrested is to be
lifted or nathered or knollered or pranged or scooped - &quot;and then the peelers
ditry-Joe'd him&quot; (the police promised him a deal, then reneged). &quot;You're
a-wantin'&quot; - someone's calling for you. &quot;I'm wearin' up til it&quot; - getting
ready.

There are more ways to question someone's sanity in Belfast than anywhere I
can think of. He's a loop, a balloon, he's as odd as a nine-pound note. He's
wired, a spacer, he's not the full shilling. He's as queer as a bottle of
chips. He's wired up but not plugged in. He's a header, a headbin, a
headbanger, a head-the-ball, his head's a marley. &quot;He took the head-staggers.&quot;
Och he's just not wise, so he's not.

With all the ways of being drunk, crazy, or arrested, you'd think there
would be more words for &quot;rain&quot;. Some mysteries just had to remain private.
What's &quot;griskins&quot;? &quot;It's horrible wee creatures which have never been
described,&quot; I was told, &quot;but when people use the term they know what they
mean.&quot;

Hi,

I once saw a documentary about the English language. In the documentary
they spoke of
an island off an east coast state or off the Canadian east coast, I am
not sure but on this island the inhabitants had a dialect similiar to
what was in Wales or a certain part of England.. Anyway they sounded
like they were English on this island and not like they were North
American.

Another time I met a person who had gone to exclusive private schools in
the USA and he
definatly had a distinct English accent but had been born in the US and
spent most his
life in the states. How can this happen unless perhaps he was faking the
English accent?

&gt; English is a widely evolving language. Many North American dialects have
&gt;&quot;adapted&quot; other influences and may appear almost unintelligible to most
&gt; Anglophones.

&gt; One of my favorites is Gullah, a creole form of English, indigenous to the
&gt; Sea Islands of South Carolina and Georgia. Like all creoles, Gullah began
&gt; as a pidgin language, transforming into a language in its own right with the
&gt; first generation born in America. A similar form of plantation creole may
&gt; have been widespread at one time in the southern United States, but Gullah
&gt; now differs from other African-American dialects of English (which do not
&gt; vary greatly from the standard syntax, pronunciation and vocabulary). Most
&gt; of Gullah vocabulary is of English origin, but the grammar and major
&gt; elements of pronunciation come from a number of West African language, such
&gt; as Ewe, Mandinka, Igbo, Twi and Yoruba. The name, &quot;Gullah&quot;, itself probably
&gt; derives from &quot;Angola&quot; (and possibly from the large number of slaves who
&gt; arrived from that part of Africa in the early 1800s). &quot;Geechee&quot; -- another
&gt; name for the language and culture of black Sea Islanders -- comes from a
&gt; tribal name in Liberia. Traditions, language and myth stayed longer with
&gt; the coastal Carolina Gullahs, who were allowed a greater latitude of
&gt; self-sufficiency and were relatively isolated on the Sea Islands. If you
&gt; ever find yourself in Charleston, head over to Beaufort and go out to the
&gt; islands. The food is fantastic! The language is hypnotic. The crafts are
&gt; remarkable in their honesty and form - quilts and sweetgrass baskets. One
&gt; of my favorite pieces in my collection is a c.1910 postcard of Gullah men
&gt; fashioning sweetgrass baskets at Penn School, founded in 1862 on St. Helena
&gt; Island as a school for freed slaves.

&gt; Some Gullah for y'all:

&gt; beat on ayun: &quot;mechanic&quot;; literally, &quot;beat-on-iron&quot;
&gt; troot ma-wt: &quot;a truthful person&quot;; literally, &quot;truth mouth&quot;
&gt; hush ma-wt: &quot;hush mouth&quot;; literally, &quot;hush mouth&quot;
&gt; sho ded: &quot;cemetery&quot;; literally, &quot;sure dead&quot;
&gt; tebl tappa: &quot;preacher&quot;; literally, &quot;table-tapper&quot;
&gt; ty oonuh ma-wt: &quot;Hush, stop talking&quot;; literally, &quot;Tie your mouth&quot;
&gt; krak teet: &quot;to speak&quot;; literally, &quot;crack teeth&quot;
&gt; i han shaht pay-shun: &quot;He steals&quot;; literally, &quot;His hand is short of
&gt; patience&quot;

&gt; Whatever its fate as a living vernacular, Gullah will live on with the
&gt; general public as the language of Uncle Remus in Joel Chandler Harris's
&gt; Bre'r Rabbit tales and the fiction of South Carolina's Ambrose E. Gonzales.

Sorry Steve &amp; Terry,

I meant it as:

&quot;English being spoken as it was when America was first settled&quot;

I have lived in Sweden for 3 years so I am forgetting how to describe my
points
correctly because I am thinking in Swenglish.

Apologies!

&gt; Purest? If you understood Rich's quotation at all, it should be clear
&gt; that English has hardly been pure most of the centuries it's been spoken.
&gt; If you mean that there are isolated areas of the US and Canada where you
&gt; can find English being spoken as it was when America was first settled,
&gt; then that's closer to being accurate. Back about 25-30 years ago, when
&gt; linguists studied extremely isolated communities in the Appalachians
&gt; speaking a peculiar dialect, they hypothesized that the residents' speech
&gt; had changed very little from the time the settlement was made. (I've
&gt; heard their English described as Elizabethan, but that would be a little
&gt; early, considering that the queen died in what, 1602? So I suppose
&gt; Jacobean would be closer...)

&gt; I hardly think that using this &quot;purer&quot; form of English would be a very
&gt; effective way of communicating with others who speak English only as a
&gt; second language -- it's not easy for *native* speakers to understand,
&gt; whether they're from London or Houston. English as we USians speak it has
&gt; evolved as far away from that Appalachian dialect as British English has.

&gt; Personally, I find that careful study of Black Adder, Monty Python, Are
&gt; You Being Served, and Fawlty Towers, along with judicious doses of East
&gt; Enders, will do a lot for USians' understanding of our common tongue as
&gt; it's spoken on the other side of the Pond...

Kris,

True, I have a midwestern accent but I am from the southwest/pacific
coast. Born in Hollywood and grew up in Arizona. Arizonians usually have
a bit of a drawl but I didn't
get to much of one because in the suburb I lived in as a child most of
the people who
lived there were new arrivals from the midwest. :))

And now I have an American/Stockholm accent with my Swedish :)))

Ronnie,

Well it was published in London,Glasgow, Edinburgh, and Dublin 1892 :))
Guess that makes it more of a British English Dictionary.
I think I paid 10 krona for this book in Sweden. I even found an Edgar
Allen Poe book
from the 1800's and a few more like Vanity Fair. The funniest one I
found was published in 1901 and the title of it is &quot;The English, from an
American point of view.&quot; It was hilarious and would make a good skit on
a Monty Python episode or even AB FAB.

"/> Hi, all...

Couldn't resist this one... I just got back from a trip to the south. (I'm
Illinoisan now living in exile in California).

While in Mississippi, I had the most wonderful thing said about me. It went:

&quot;That Tracy's a real card. Why, she can talk the horns off a billy goat!&quot;

On another occasion, at a party in Savannah, GA (now, THERE'S a place to
party!), a Virginian asked me &quot;Where are you from?&quot; I responded that I was
from Illinois. &quot;Guess that makes me a damnyankee..&quot;

Well, he promptly &quot;sushed&quot; me, saying, &quot;Not in this crowd! There are too many
northerners here. We prefer to think of you all as 'Reformed Yankees.'&quot;

Loses something without the pronunciation - this was spoken with that haughty,
slow and aristocratic drawl of the &quot;old money&quot; southern artistocrats -
&quot;refa-a-a-aw'm'd Ya-a-a-nkee.&quot;

Ooooh, what fun. I could easily become a Southerner. Yayesss, dee-ah.

&gt; Hi,

&gt; I once saw a documentary about the English language. In the documentary

&gt; not sure but on this island the inhabitants had a dialect similiar to
&gt; what was in Wales or a certain part of England.

"/> I believe that the islands in question are in Chesapeake Bay MD. The language was so
different from English on the show that they had to use subtitles. Chesapeake Bay seems to be
on a direct trade wind current from the southwest corner of Great Britain. Many people from
Wales emigrated to this area and south to Pennsylvania. Most of the town names in PA show a
strong Welsh influence.Rhiannon

So, given that I'm an English Public School boy (in the Hugh Grant
sense, not the Eastenders sense), I wonder how my accent would go down
over the water! Despite my best efforts to lose my accent as soon as I
left home and school, I can't really hide it, and I can ham up the

Now Ronnie's accent... :^)

Moonpie is a disgustingly sweet confection. Consists of two round graham
cracker cookies with a marshmallow center and then the whole thing is dipped in
chocolate or a vanilla type of icing. Really great if you pop in the
microwave. Kind of like a smores. Okay, what is a smores? That is what we
made outside. You take a wire coathanger and unbend it. Then build a fire,
stick two marshmallows on the end of the clotheshanger and hold over the fire.
As kids, we usually held it until it caught fire! Then blow out the fire. You
have ready a graham cracker on which you've placed a Hershey's chocolate bar.
Now is the tricky part. You have to slide the burned marshmallows carefully
off the coat hanger between the two graham crackers. Ooooooh Boy. That was
fine eatin' when you are 10 years old. It is called smores because you always
want &quot;some more&quot;. Ashley

chocolate &amp; replaced it with brown food dye with the main ingredient being wax.

&gt;The history of English is conventionally, if perhaps too neatly, divided
&gt;into three periods usually called Old English (or Anglo-Saxon), Middle
&gt;English, and Modern English. The earliest period begins with the migration
&gt;of certain Germanic tribes from the continent to Britain in the fifth
&gt;century A. D., though no records of their language survive from before the
&gt;seventh century, (CLIP)

Ronnie,

I'm of half irish decent on my mother side (She is 100 percent Irish
American)
and my father is of Spanish/french lineage. SO I guess that makes me
somewhat 75%
a Celt since the Celts were supposedly from a particular part of France.

to the 1st century BC spread over much of Europe. Their tribes and groups
eventually ranged from the British Isles and northern Spain to as far east as
Transylvania, the Black Sea coasts, and Galatia in Anatolia and were in part
absorbed into the Roman Empire as Britons, Gauls, Boii, Galatians, and
Celtiberians. ...... which one are you then? :) ..... Dia duit ar maidin
