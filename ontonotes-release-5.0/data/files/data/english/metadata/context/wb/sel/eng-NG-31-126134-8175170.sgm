&gt; &gt;  is the alternative way in-which to wash ones hands.

&gt; &gt; Part 3 This blessing is for forwarding?

&gt; &gt; *&quot; As a feather floats by, lonely lies silent &quot;*

&gt; &gt; Yet even while seen through the eyes of many...
&gt; &gt; Still lying lifeless on 45th an Broadway last night in
&gt; &gt; Time square
&gt; &gt; America's Big Apple...
&gt; &gt; As if like a flash back it accrued to me.
&gt; &gt; Who would know in the dark of night that through the Forest flew a
&gt; &gt; black bird
&gt; &gt; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P85LoHftEKs
&gt; &gt; that died that night ?
&gt; &gt; GOD would...
&gt; &gt; So as like any good Samaritan would do I picked up.
&gt; &gt; That life less little Bird left there lying amok in the middle of
&gt; &gt; the road ,and walked it to the curb.
&gt; &gt; While in the background all I heard was this peaceful musician
&gt; &gt; playing
&gt; &gt; songs from the heart of our home land.
&gt; &gt; Those flutes a flaring fluently through the air last night.
&gt; &gt; I walked upon a clear ROSE bag. And as i bent down to pick it up all
&gt; &gt; I saw were a flock birds swarming to find rest.
&gt; &gt; Right then and there on top of the Virgin music store sing there in
&gt; &gt; time square.
&gt; &gt; http://www.grahamowen.com/images-17/Times_Square_Night.jpg

&gt; &gt; * In seeing that it accrued to me

&gt; &gt; Just how many birds I saw daily flying by my tent every night while
&gt; &gt; my
&gt; &gt; stay in the Virgin Islands &quot; The Dark Mountain &quot;
&gt; &gt; The place I called Home for seven months this year.
&gt; &gt; Bet they saw what I was doing and wanted to perch there quickly , to
&gt; &gt; see just what I would do at that point in time.
&gt; &gt; locating a trash receptacle was easy for there was one right there
&gt; &gt; in front of my path as I crossed the street.
&gt; &gt; Gently as I laid the life less bird in to it's new place...
&gt; &gt; I saw all the birds take off at once , as that musician played on an
&gt; &gt; on an all right there. In to the late of night.
&gt; &gt; The wonder of aha and the joy it can bring...
&gt; &gt; To View the Mountain in the VIRGIN Islands were I saw so many birds:
