Effects of gaps in inductors and transformers

In a thread in SEB there was a discussion on transformer failure modes that
also mentioned gaps in the magnetic path. I never fully understood the
function of gaps in the core, but I observed that they are generally
present in iron core inductors, but not in most transformers.

I found some information at
http://www.micrometals.com/appnotes/appnotedownloads/id4hf.pdf , where it is
explained that the gap size can maximize energy storage in an inductor by
balancing the point of magnetic saturation (and core heating) with winding
losses. It seems that a wider (or longer) core gap extends the point of
magnetic saturation by allowing more current to flow through the windings,
so the effect is to lower the inductance. A smaller gap will have higher
inductance, but will saturate the core much more quickly, resulting in less
energy storage.

As an inductor is used more for energy storage, a gap (whether actually cut
in the magnetic material or distributed as with powdered iron), allows more
energy storage by allowing more current flow, and energy is proportional to
the square of the current. For a transformer, as I understand it, the
energy is transferred from the primary to secondary by mutual inductance,
so the absense of a gap results in higher inductance and a higher volts per
turn.

More information can be found at
http://ece-www.colorado.edu/~ecen4517/course_material/Exp6/Inductor.pdf ,
which describes filter inductor design.

I would like to get a better understanding of the characteristics of
transformers and inductors to know how best to design high current 50/60 Hz
transformers as well as switch mode boost converters using inductors.

The transformers I have made use toroidal primary cores with 120/240 VAC
windings, and secondaries consisting of several turns of bus bar or welding
cable to produce up to 10s of thousands of amps. They will usually produce
15 to 30 times their nominal output currents for short pulses.

The switch mode boost converter I have designed uses a 10 uH inductor at
100 kHz to boost 12 VDC to 25 or 45 VDC at about 800 mA. However, I
recently found that a small pot core inductor rated at 6.7 amps seemed to
work better than a larger toroidal inductor rated at 10.8 amps. I think
this might be because the smaller inductor starts to saturate sooner,
lowering its inductance but allowing more current to flow, resulting in
higher energy storage. The larger inductor is probably allowing much less
current and hence less energy, so it cannot produce the power for the
higher voltage load. I can probably drop the frequency to 75 kHz or 60 KHz
and maybe get the output I need.

Thanks for any thoughts and discussion.

This is not quite the right way to describe what is going on.

The maximum magnetic field you can build up in the magnetic path is
independent of the gap - it is limited by the saturation flux for the
core material. The number of ampere-turns of current through the
winding required to generate that flux depends on the magnetic path
length. The magnetic path length through the core itself is divided by
the relative permeability of the core (about 1000 times air for
ferrites, and 10,000 times air for iron) so even a small air-gap can
dramatically increase the magnetic path length.

A ten-fold increase in magnetic path length allows a ten fold increase
in current through the winding before you ht stuaration, and reduces
the inductance of the assembly by a factor of ten, thus allowing a
factor of ten increase in the energy stored in the inductance (LI^2)
before saturation sets in.

A gap in a transformer core increases the leakage inductance, which is
usually undesirable.

Moreoever, a transformer isn't usually used as an energy storage
device, so increasing the energy storage capacity is rarely a design
priority.

At 100kHz you probably need to worry more about inter-winding
capacitance. The detailed structure of the windings can get to be very
important at this sort of frequency. The pot core may well have a two
or four section former with the windings built up as two or four
successive sections, while the toriod is more likely to have its
windings built up as successive layers, one on top of another, which
gives a higher winding capacitance and a lower self-resonant
frequency.

At even higher frequencies, you have to restrict yourself to single-
layer windings to keep the interwinding capacitance within bounds, and
eventually you have to go over to transmission line transformers.

With the flyback converter being the counterexample for both. As more and

Sloppy word usage.
Flybacks don't use transformers. They use coupled inductors.

No, he's generally correct. Power and audio iron-lam transformers are
almost never gapped; ferrite power transformers are usually not; iron
core and ferrite inductors are usually gapped, either with a distinct
gap or just an open magnetic structure; it prevents dc saturation and
helps better define their inductance.

Ferroresonant power transformers were gapped, but they're pretty rare
these days.

OK. That is very helpful in understanding the principles involved. The gaps
I saw in some large C-core inductors I have are about 0.1", and the
laminated steel has a length of about 10". So if the magnetic path length
is increased to 1000, that is a 100 fold decrease in inductance, allowing
100 times the ampere turns, and thus 100 times the energy. This is a 100 mH
inductor rated about 10 amperes.

Thank you for that information. I had posted on SEB that some small
transformers may be made with a gap to make them impedance protected in
case of an output overload or short. There are probably other ways to
achieve this effect with looser coupling. As I had posted there, it comes
at the price of low efficiency and poor regulation, but that's what is
desired for self-protection.

windings.

&gt; core and ferrite inductors are usually gapped, either with a distinct
&gt; gap or just an open magnetic structure; it prevents dc saturation and
&gt; helps better define their inductance.

&gt; Ferroresonant power transformers were gapped, but they're pretty rare
&gt; these days.
">

I've worked for a battery charger manufacturer who wound his own ferros,
and none of them was gapped. They do, however, have "magnetic shunts"
that let some of the flux bypass the secondary; apparently this has to
do with having a regulated output.

I was testing one one time, with a BMF variac and AC volt and ammeters.
I cranked up the variac, and the primary current went way high - it
worried me, so I mentioned it to the client (who designs the things, and
he beamed: "It's regulating!"

The rest of ferro design, of course, is Black Magic. :-)

Small, impractical nit: Won't the flux continue to increase with
current, at a declining effective permeability, approaching u=1 at
full saturation of the iron? Admittedly, this is a pretty low slope,
but I don't think it goes to zero.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; The number of ampere-turns of current through the

Nope.  Saturation can occur in transformers that do not have any DC

Ever seen the switching frequency of the Class D amp chips
available?

Most are 200kHz to 300kHz.

This being used as the front end for a CAT scanner PS I made in
first proto was why we couldn't use them.  That made the ripple spec
fail.  That spec was 20mV @ 1500 VDC.

We ended up making an audio amp with a string of IGBTs, and it ran
at 17kHz flawlessly.  11mV ripple and 1Volt regulation at 250Watts at
1500Volts.  Beat the competition by a factor of two in both ripple and
voltage regulation.

Sure, but you don't usually want your transformer or inductor to go

extends outside the core material and so forth. Of course I once built
a starter for a xenon lamp where the step-up transformer spent most of
its time during start-up - probably a few microseconds - in
saturation. I still eventually got my 20kV across the secondary,
enough to get the electrodes to spark over, initiating the discharge -

This sounds like nonsense to me. For simple, centre-tapped windings a
high leakage inductance, corresponding to poor coupling between the
two sides of the centre-tapped winding, leads to a higher turn-off
dissipation, which can be a major source of lost efficiency, not to
mention over-heated switching transistors.

What you seem to be thinking off would seem to be shoot-through
losses, which are best dealt with by a break-before-make switch
driver.

Nothing to do with a magnetic amplifier, which is
the active controlling of AC or DC power via a DC
control winding.

A ferroresonant CVT is a passive device and is a
clever design of a core, with a non-saturating
primary limb, a magnetic shunt, and a saturating
secondary limb. The winding on that secondary limb
inherently produces a constant output voltage.
The output is square, (mainly third and fifth
harmonics), and the capacitor is there to resonate-
-out those harmonics.  There are even more clever
designs that use compensating windings to reduce the
secondary harmonics.

The CVT is adjusted by "shimming the shunt". I've seen
it done on some special CVT's we were buying, and that
is definitely a black art.

&gt; present in iron core inductors, but not in most transformers.

&gt; I found some information at
&gt; http://www.micrometals.com/appnotes/appnotedownloads/id4hf.pdf , where it is
&gt; explained that the gap size can maximize energy storage in an inductor by
&gt; balancing the point of magnetic saturation (and core heating) with winding
&gt; losses. It seems that a wider (or longer) core gap extends the point of
&gt; magnetic saturation by allowing more current to flow through the windings,
&gt; so the effect is to lower the inductance. A smaller gap will have higher
&gt; inductance, but will saturate the core much more quickly, resulting in less
&gt; energy storage.

&gt; As an inductor is used more for energy storage, a gap (whether actually cut
&gt; in the magnetic material or distributed as with powdered iron), allows more
&gt; energy storage by allowing more current flow, and energy is proportional to
&gt; the square of the current. For a transformer, as I understand it, the
&gt; energy is transferred from the primary to secondary by mutual inductance,
&gt; so the absense of a gap results in higher inductance and a higher volts per
&gt; turn.

&gt; More information can be found at
&gt; http://ece-www.colorado.edu/~ecen4517/course_material/Exp6/Inductor.pdf ,
&gt; which describes filter inductor design.

&gt; I would like to get a better understanding of the characteristics of
&gt; transformers and inductors to know how best to design high current 50/60 Hz
&gt; transformers as well as switch mode boost converters using inductors.

&gt; The transformers I have made use toroidal primary cores with 120/240 VAC
&gt; windings, and secondaries consisting of several turns of bus bar or welding
&gt; cable to produce up to 10s of thousands of amps. They will usually produce
&gt; 15 to 30 times their nominal output currents for short pulses.

&gt; The switch mode boost converter I have designed uses a 10 uH inductor at
&gt; 100 kHz to boost 12 VDC to 25 or 45 VDC at about 800 mA. However, I
&gt; recently found that a small pot core inductor rated at 6.7 amps seemed to
&gt; work better than a larger toroidal inductor rated at 10.8 amps. I think
&gt; this might be because the smaller inductor starts to saturate sooner,
&gt; lowering its inductance but allowing more current to flow, resulting in
&gt; higher energy storage. The larger inductor is probably allowing much less
&gt; current and hence less energy, so it cannot produce the power for the
&gt; higher voltage load. I can probably drop the frequency to 75 kHz or 60 KHz
&gt; and maybe get the output I need.

&gt; Thanks for any thoughts and discussion.

There are many different reasons as to why magnetic circuits are gapped.
For the switching power supply application, the main reason is to
prevent core saturation under a DC bias and the gap is usually sized by
volume so that the 1/2*mu*B^2 due to the DC is stored in the
non-saturating gap. In an ac-transformer application, the load current
has little to do with core flux density theoretically. The flux density
is only determined by the primary voltage as this sets the dB/dt
magnetization in the core, and the net flux due to the load current in
primary and secondary is zero.

&gt;&gt;&gt;energy storage.

&gt;&gt;This is not quite the right way to describe what is going on.

&gt;&gt;The maximum magnetic field you can build up in the magnetic path is
&gt;&gt;independent of the gap - it is limited by the saturation flux for the
&gt;&gt;core material. The number of ampere-turns of current through the
&gt;&gt;winding required to generate that flux depends on the magnetic path
&gt;&gt;length. The magnetic path length through the core itself is divided by
&gt;&gt;the relative permeability of the core (about 1000 times air for
&gt;&gt;ferrites, and 10,000 times air for iron) so even a small air-gap can
&gt;&gt;dramatically increase the magnetic path length.

&gt;&gt;A ten-fold increase in magnetic path length allows a ten fold increase
&gt;&gt;in current through the winding before you ht stuaration, and reduces
&gt;&gt;the inductance of the assembly by a factor of ten, thus allowing a
&gt;&gt;factor of ten increase in the energy stored in the inductance (LI^2)
&gt;&gt;before saturation sets in.

&gt; OK. That is very helpful in understanding the principles involved. The gaps
&gt; I saw in some large C-core inductors I have are about 0.1&quot;, and the
&gt; laminated steel has a length of about 10&quot;. So if the magnetic path length
&gt; is increased to 1000, that is a 100 fold decrease in inductance, allowing
&gt; 100 times the ampere turns, and thus 100 times the energy. This is a 100 mH
&gt; inductor rated about 10 amperes.

&gt;&gt;&gt;As an inductor is used more for energy storage, a gap (whether actually
&gt;&gt;&gt;cut
&gt;&gt;&gt;in the magnetic material or distributed as with powdered iron), allows
&gt;&gt;&gt;more
&gt;&gt;&gt;energy storage by allowing more current flow, and energy is proportional
&gt;&gt;&gt;to
&gt;&gt;&gt;the square of the current. For a transformer, as I understand it, the
&gt;&gt;&gt;energy is transferred from the primary to secondary by mutual
&gt;&gt;&gt;inductance,
&gt;&gt;&gt;so the absense of a gap results in higher inductance and a higher volts
&gt;&gt;&gt;per
&gt;&gt;&gt;turn.

&gt;&gt;A gap in a transformer core increases the leakage inductance, which is
&gt;&gt;usually undesirable.

&gt;&gt;Moreoever, a transformer isn't usually used as an energy storage
&gt;&gt;device, so increasing the energy storage capacity is rarely a design
&gt;&gt;priority.

&gt; Thank you for that information. I had posted on SEB that some small
&gt; transformers may be made with a gap to make them impedance protected in
&gt; case of an output overload or short. There are probably other ways to
&gt; achieve this effect with looser coupling. As I had posted there, it comes
&gt; at the price of low efficiency and poor regulation, but that's what is
&gt; desired for self-protection.

If you look at any hunky arc welder, even a small one is 200A rated
secondary, you will notice that the current adjust dial is mechanically
linked to a chunk of laminated iron that is moved in and out of a big
gap in the core, directly adjusting the reluctance of the magnetic
circuit and the magnitude of flux linked with the secondary.

&gt;&gt;At 100kHz you probably need to worry more about inter-winding
&gt;&gt;capacitance. The detailed structure of the windings can get to be very
&gt;&gt;important at this sort of frequency. The pot core may well have a two
&gt;&gt;or four section former with the windings built up as two or four
&gt;&gt;successive sections, while the toriod is more likely to have its
&gt;&gt;windings built up as successive layers, one on top of another, which
&gt;&gt;gives a higher winding capacitance and a lower self-resonant
&gt;&gt;frequency.

&gt;&gt;At even higher frequencies, you have to restrict yourself to single-
&gt;&gt;layer windings to keep the interwinding capacitance within bounds, and
&gt;&gt;eventually you have to go over to transmission line transformers.

&gt; The toroid has only about 10 turns of approx #16 wire on a core about 0.75&quot;
&gt; x 0.37&quot;. I don't know the internal construction of the pot core, but it is
&gt; only about 0.5&quot; square and 0.3&quot; high. It most likely has several layers of
&gt; windings.

In Eurpe we were a litte later, I think.
first 2 transistor, then 6.
The 2 transistor ones were cheap, and a clever design, used the transistors 2 times,
first as RF amp, and then again as LF amp...
The 6 were not push pull:
Perhaps 1 RF/Mixer, 1 osc, 2 IF, 1 audio drive, 1 audio out?
Then the number of transistors increased, and likely push pull:

An arc welder is ALWAYS a short circuit when there is a plasma arc

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;OK, say we have an ungapped iron-core transformer, with some fixed AC
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;voltage and frequency applied to a primary winding. Primary
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;ampere-turns are some value X. Now add an air gap. What happens to X?

&gt;&gt;  Whatever x becomes, it certainly becomes ALLOWED to have a higher
&gt;&gt;ceiling than without the gap.  You need to realize that.  The gap
&gt;&gt;allows the drive to be greater, despite the tiny loss incurred.
&gt;&gt;Without it, the ceiling for saturation is MUCH lower!  Pretty simple
&gt;&gt;shit.

&gt;&gt;  Gaineth thy selfeth a clue.

&gt;Answer the question.

X drops a LITTLE BIT, you fucking retard (inferred in my post)!  Now
observe what I said above about being able to drive it harder to make
up for, and even surpass your petty claim of severe losses.

You are too fucking thick, boy.
