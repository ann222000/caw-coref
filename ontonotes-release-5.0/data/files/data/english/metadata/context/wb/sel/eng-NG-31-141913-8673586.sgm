&lt; http://www.wethepeopleradionetwork.com/ &gt;WeThePeopleRadioNetwork.com
and to our guest in the first and second hour- Ellen Hodgson Brown on
&quot;Rethinking Money.&quot;

Ellen Hodgson Brown author of &lt; http://webofdebt.com/ &gt;The Web of Debt-
The Shocking Truth About Our Money System -- The Sleight of Hand That
Has Trapped Us in Debt And How We Can Break Free. Ellen will be
attending Monetary Reform Conferences in
&lt; http://www.monetary.org/2007conference.html &gt;Chicago September
26th-30th and in the
&lt; http://www.prosperityuk.com/prosperity/bromsgrove/brom2006.html &gt;UK
October 5th-7th.

Ellen Brown developed her research skills as an attorney practicing
civil litigation in Los Angeles. In Web of Debt, she turns her skills
towards an analysis of the Federal Reserve and &quot;the money trust.&quot; She
shows how this private cartel has usurped the power to create money
from the people themselves, and how we the people can get it back.
Brown developed an interest in the developing world and its problems
while living abroad for eleven years in Kenya, Honduras, Guatemala
and Nicaragua. She returned to practicing law when she was asked to
join the legal team of a popular Tijuana healer with an innovative
cancer therapy, who was targeted by the chemotherapy industry in the
1990s. That experience produced her book Forbidden Medicine, which
traces the suppression of natural health treatments to the same
corrupting influences that have captured the money system. Brown's
eleven books include the bestselling Nature's Pharmacy, co-authored
with Dr. Lynne Walker, which has sold 285,000 copies.

Her work on healing is a perfect complement to tackling the systemic
problems caused by the current financial system. The global economy
is terminally ill and the planet, after a long period of human abuse
in the pursuit of power and profit, is in dire need of healing.

In a review of Ellen's book, someone wrote:

&quot;I can unequivocally say that this is now the definitive work on the
world's financial and banking system, the history of money and power
in Western civilization, and the dire prognosis for our economy and
our personal freedoms, in general, as a result. It is vastly superior
to &quot;The Creature from Jekyll Island&quot;,... looking back four to five
years from now, this could be the most profound non-fiction work of
our times. Robert Hemphill, Credit Manager for the Federal Reserve
Bank in Atlanta, when speaking on the same topic as this book,
stated, &quot;It is the most important subject intelligent persons can
investigate and reflect upon.&quot;. .. The mechanics of money and finance
have a profound affect on every person's life and well being, and is
inextricably linked to the fabric of our society and our freedom. Yet
it is almost completely ignored and poorly understood by the common
man. As Henry Ford said, &quot;It is well that the people of this nation
do not understand our banking and monetary system, for if they did, I
believe there would be revolution before tomorrow morning.&quot; ...

&quot;Ellen Hodgson Brown does a remarkable job at making this subject
both easily understandable and richly entertaining... Unknown to
most, The Wizard of Oz was written as a parable for our monetary
system. Ms. Brown takes us down that yellow brick road and shows us
that the reason L. Frank Baum's timeless story resonates with us so
deeply is that our own world works much the same way as the Land of
Oz, with a parallel cast of characters. It lies within our power, and
in this book, to find our own ruby/silver slippers, thus avoiding the
crisis to find our way back home to the real utopia.&quot;

Carol Brouillet, the show's host, has also organized three
conferences with a focus on &quot;Money&quot; and promoted local currencies for
over a decade. She publishes the
&lt; http://www.communitycurrency.org/conception.html &gt;Conception
Dollarand the &lt; http://www.deceptiondollar.com &gt;Deception Dollars which
resembles money, but includes art and websites to raise consciousness
about solutions to the current military/political/ecological crises
that we face, and 9/11. The Deception Dollars have also helped to
nurture the 9/11 truth community, movement, and funded the first 9/11
Truth events that were held in San Francisco.
&quot;Money, next to brute military force is the most powerful tool of
Empire. The heart of the Global Economy is a war economy.
To change the world's monetary system, one must change the world's
belief system. Actually, it is easier to expose the &quot;war game&quot; than
the &quot;money game,&quot; but both are tied together. If we are to change the
system, so that the economy serves rather than destroys life, we need
to challenge the foundational myths about our history, war, money,
that enable the current system to continue. It is in crisis now, and
we have a rare opportunity to &quot;reinvent money&quot; as people lose
confidance in the US government, the dollar, the war on terror, and
to nurture new systems based on truth, cooperation, respect, shared
recognition of our interdependence, humanity's desire for genuine
peace and freedom.&quot;
