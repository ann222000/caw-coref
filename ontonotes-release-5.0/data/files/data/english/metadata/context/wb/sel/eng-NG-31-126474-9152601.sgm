Warm greetings of peace all,

I went into the Mt Zion infusion center with high hopes this morning -
they even managed to get the IV in on the first try, which almost
never happens! (Massive hydration the day before and following Tim's
advice to slap the sucker into a shape seemed to work! :)

They start off the IV at 50mg/per hour and then double it every 30
minutes until it is at 400 mg/per hour. However, I've never been able
to attain that rate. The first time especially I have allergic
reactions in the throat area so they have to slow it down
considerably, making it around a 10-hour infusion generally.

Anyway, when they reached 150 mg/hour I started getting the throat
tightening and tickles that I usually do and they stopped the IV and
administered more Benadryl. That usually calms everything down but
this time my chest tightened, I couldn't breathe and I thought I was
going to black out. There were about 6 nurses swarming around me
taking blood pressure, hooking me up to oxygen, shooting me up with
more Solumderol...it's all kind of a blur when I think about it and
very scary.

They stopped the infusion and paged my neuro 13 times over the next 2
hours. Unfortunately my neuro didn't respond to the pages, but another
doctor at the MS Clinic - who is not familiar with my case - did and
she told them to send me home without finishing the treatment and with
only 10% of the Rituxan used.

This is upsetting on so many levels...I am only approved for two
treatments by Blue Shield, of which this was one and which is now
incomplete with 90% of the drug wasted. Now I have to go back to my
neuro and see what he wants to do next. I assume he will want to
continue the infusions at slower rates but I don't know if insurance
will cover the extra treatment that will need to be scheduled in place
of this one. I think I am going to ask him to write some sort of
protocol so if he isn't available they can still follow his advice.

I'm also worried that I many be developing an increasing sensitivity
to Rituxan and afraid that over time I may not be able to take it any
more. But I'm trying not to even worry or think about that right now.

Has anyone else had treatment stopped or been taken off of Rituxan due
to allergic reactions? The doctor's advice seemed overly conservative
to me but I had no choice in the matter. In the past they've merely
waited for the reaction to subside and then started at a slower rate
again.

I'm exhausted and frustrated that this process has been lengthened and
really just want it to be over. Am praying for patience. Thanks for
all the best wishes on the other thread - I will let you know what my
neuro says next week.

Blessings, health and happiness to all!

Warmly,
Baraka

Oh, Baraka,

My heart goes out to you.  I'm so sorry you had to go thru this ordeal.
I can't imagine, as I haven't had anything like this happen.  And
you're so young and healthy aside from the Devics.

How are you feeling now?  Did the solumedrol help with the chest
tightening?

I'm so relieved you were in competent hands.  Those working in that
infusion are a good team and know exactly how to handle an emergency.
I could see being in the local hospital and them not administering
solumedrol immediately.

Please try to get some good rest this weekend.  Do not worry about this
until you can do something about it or pursue what you need to on
Monday.

I wish I could say or do more.  You are in my thoughts and prayers.
All my best to you!

xoxo, Kendall

Baraka,

So sorry to hear about your day, how scary.

I found this here:

http://www.rxlist.com/cgi/generic/ritux_ad.htm

Other frequent infusion reaction symptoms included nausea, pruritus,
angioedema, asthenia, hypotension, headache, bronchospasm, throat
irritation, rhinitis, urticaria, rash, vomiting, myalgia, dizziness,
and hypertension. These reactions generally occurred within 30 to 120
minutes of beginning the first infusion, and resolved with slowing or
interruption of the Rituxan infusion and with supportive care
(diphenhydramine, acetaminophen, IV saline, and vasopressors). The
incidence of infusion reactions was highest during the first infusion
(77%) and decreased with each subsequent infusion (30% with fourth
infusion and 14% with eighth infusion). Injection site pain was
reported in less than 5% of patients.

Take care,
Sandy

&gt; How disappointing for you, Baraka.  I'm so sorry.  Because this
&gt; circumstance was out of your control, I am thinking that it won't be too
&gt; difficult to get the insurance to cover an additional treatment.   My first
&gt; time out, my blood pressure went very high.  We simply stopped the infusion
&gt; until such time as it dropped, and restarted at a slower pace.  How
&gt; frustrated you must feel right now.   Keeping my fingers crossed for a much

your fears would have been laid to rest. I am sorry Baraka.

Baraka, I am so sorry to hear of your difficult experience. I can't begin to imagine how frustrating and scary that must have been. Many good wishes and prayers that the insurance company will work with you, and you'll have a much more successful go round next time

Thank you and bless you all for your kind caring!

I finally got through to Dr Cree on Monday afternoon and he wants me
to go ahead with the infusion on the 16th &amp; 30th but to be pre-treated
with a gram of Solumedrol the day before and the morning of the
treatment to lower the chances of an allergic reaction.

I'm not thrilled about getting two grams of Solumedrol - I used to
receive 3 grams to deal with exacerbations and the side effects are
very uncomfortable.

But, I'm just focusing on the fact that he thinks I can still take the
Rituximab and that in itself is very good news indeed.

No word on whether or not Blue Shield will pay for the third
treatment , but here's hoping.

Thanks so much for your support my dears!

Warmly,
Baraka

Wonderful news Baraka!!   I feel sure that if Dr. Cree communicates
with the insurance company that they will pay for the extra infusion.
After all, the situation was out of your control and certainly not
your fault. Also, good idea to pre treat with SoluMedrol.  Here's
hoping that everything goes smoothly this time.  (I have every
confidence that it will.  :-)

With All love,
