Does anyone here bend the rules when it comes to bikes on the metro
rails during rush hour?  Are they accommodating as long as the trains
aren't standing-room-only or do they stop bikes at the door starting
at 7am?

Thanks!

Do you remember the news story from a few years ago about the kid getting
arrested for eating a French fry on the Metro?

I have to second Ted's caution.  I once carried my bike down the escalator
at 11:45pm to run and catch the last train instead of taking the elevator
which takes a lifetime to go from street level, stop off at level one to
pick up the lazy bones who do not want to stand on the walking stairs, and
then down to the platform.  The station manager stopped me, gave me that
fatherly lecture despite my pleads that this was the last train, I did not
have my light, and I had too many beers to legally and safely ride my bike
the 12 miles home.

He did not really care because it was less about the rules and more about
the power of authority he was holding at that moment.  He wanted to treat me
like a bad dog.  He said I could get on the train with a $250 ticket or I
could ride home.  He demanded that I carry my bike up the escalator and take
the elevator home. When I inquired if he was going to give me another ticket
for the way up.  He did not like that and actually chased after me. Was he
going to beat me up, give me two tickets, I didn't know, but he sure enjoyed
his power trip.

The worst that will happen is you will receive a $250 fine and could have
your bike confiscated if it is not registered with the DC Police Dept. This
includes bikes that reside in VA or MD.

Good Luck.
