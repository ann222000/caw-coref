Well I got a sound outta mine a few minutes ago that is nothing short of
fantastic. Experimenting with tone controls on my Strat. I was playing
along with Eric Claptons &quot;Before you accuse me&quot;, I like the sound of
tone all the way down for some Clapton stuff. So I wondered how having
the bridge and middle with the middle pups tone all the way down. That
coupled with the Boss OS-2, all knobs at 75% (3 quarter distortion and 1
quarter overdrive). Amp at 50% volume. Holy freaking hell, I got Blues
tone I love. And sustain... Wo mama. the feedback was easy to control
and was only there when invited. I tried the amps natural distortion and
it didn't sound near as good. Anyway it was a lightbulb moment and
needed to share it with people that would get it;-) What a day.... I'm
back in Strat heaven. Grin. Scuse me while I touch the sky......

Hey Mark, that's really great.
Brilliant when you suddenly get some kind of sound you have tried for
and finally nail it.
I see you are using an Epiphone Valve Junior. I keep looking at the
idea of getting one of these and putting mods on it.
Have you seen the Thomann website in Germany - they have a range by
Harley Benton and a 5 watt valve combo amp which already has a tone
control. Apparently the circuit board is a direct copy of the Epiphone
one, it's nicely trimmed in cream vinyl and costs  a mssive £65.86

http://www.thomann.de/gb/harley_benton_ga5.htm

Might go for one of these. What mods have you done to your VJ and is
it a combo or an amp head? Are you in the UK like me by the way?

Regards,

Geoff

I'm in Aussie. No mods so far. But a bright switch is gonna happen one
day at least. I just use an old 70's Vorg 5 band eq pedal, for some
upper middle and top end boost. Tho in the case of the OS-2 I don't need
it, because I'm trying to thicken and muddy it up a little anyway. with
this arrangement I'm getting a huge array of possibilities. Just tried
the tube Screamer as well, sweeeet.

I have a stock VJ head with a homemade open back Lorantz greenback 1x12
cabinet (35w 16ohms. That link you posted looks pretty good.

Only bummer with winter here is the lack of daylight hours.
Read the weather for London, in summer they usually only manage 21C.
Here today it was 19C.
Only two frosts so far, no steam breath in the morning, lawns still need
mowing. I could grow tomatoes in this weather.
Four weeks max of temps around 15C, morning temps of 3C. Big deal, so you
wear shoes and not thongs (flip flops).
No snow, no blizzard unless you're silly enough to live above 1K metres.
Still shorts and t-shirt weather afaic. Worn a jumper (pullover /
sweatshirt) once this year.

I tell ya, it just sucks being an Aussie on the mid North Coast of NSW.

You'd better start with some good transformers. Those will cost you a couple
hundred bucks. Replace every cap because those in it are the cheapest money
can buy.
At least a 10&quot; speaker. New tubes. Are we at $400 yet?

Hey Mark, that's really great.
Brilliant when you suddenly get some kind of sound you have tried for
and finally nail it.
I see you are using an Epiphone Valve Junior. I keep looking at the
idea of getting one of these and putting mods on it.
Have you seen the Thomann website in Germany - they have a range by
Harley Benton and a 5 watt valve combo amp which already has a tone
control. Apparently the circuit board is a direct copy of the Epiphone
one, it's nicely trimmed in cream vinyl and costs  a mssive £65.86

http://www.thomann.de/gb/harley_benton_ga5.htm

Might go for one of these. What mods have you done to your VJ and is
it a combo or an amp head? Are you in the UK like me by the way?

&gt; and was only there when invited. I tried the amps natural distortion and
&gt; it didn't sound near as good. Anyway it was a lightbulb moment and
&gt; needed to share it with people that would get it;-) What a day.... I'm
&gt; back in Strat heaven. Grin. Scuse me while I touch the sky......

Way good.
I've done a couple of things which birghten mine up, but it's still
best with the compressor in front for
a little treble boost.
Last night I had some time with mine and tried the lp.. man.. it
sounded good. really good.

you have to try caps.. c1 through c4.. mallory or spraque..
and I'm going to use a 1M pot on the input for variable input signal..
I have a 1M resistor but sometimes I'd like to reduce the input a bit.

and yes, I'm still going to go with a bright switch. Because with the
input signal mod you get gobs of tone and volume out of it already..
no need for any boost at all.
(I typically set my rp7 to less than full output.. full output being
measured as 'as loud as I'd be without anything in front'.)

I was surprised at how well I liked it. It's the first time I really
appreciated the vj with humbucks run into it.
Sometimes with practice I have to take a day off from something I'm
learning.. and when I come back I find I've cleared my head somehow
and play it better.. I've noticed the same thing with modding these
vjs.. you get too close and somehow you don't hear it as well.

and no, keith is wrong again.. you don't have to spend four hundred
bucks, you don't have  to replace the output transformer.
I've got a few resistors a switch and a couple of caps in mine and
it's much better already.
cheap!

&gt; Hey Mark, that's really great.
&gt; Brilliant when you suddenly get some kind of sound you have tried for
&gt; and finally nail it.
&gt; I see you are using an Epiphone Valve Junior. I keep looking at the
&gt; idea of getting one of these and putting mods on it.
&gt; Have you seen the Thomann website in Germany - they have a range by
&gt; Harley Benton and a 5 watt valve combo amp which already has a tone
&gt; control. Apparently the circuit board is a direct copy of the Epiphone
&gt; one, it's nicely trimmed in cream vinyl and costs  a mssive £65.86

&gt; http://www.thomann.de/gb/harley_benton_ga5.htm

&gt; Might go for one of these. What mods have you done to your VJ and is
&gt; it a combo or an amp head? Are you in the UK like me by the way?

&gt; Regards,

&gt; Geoff

If it's a good price, it is pretty much the same amp so don't let the
nameplate bother you.
You will still, I think, want to do some mods. The tone control alone
wont do it, most likely.

But the mods needed are pretty cheap. Just don't kill yourself doing
them.

&gt; I'm in Aussie. No mods so far. But a bright switch is gonna happen one

&gt; upper middle and top end boost. Tho in the case of the OS-2 I don't need
&gt; it, because I'm trying to thicken and muddy it up a little anyway. with
&gt; this arrangement I'm getting a huge array of possibilities. Just tried

Sure it can. It's just a question of the value of the resistor and
that can vary a great deal.
In fact, I'm thinking of using a switch which takes me from a new
brighter position to an even brighter choice.
I'm not sure I will yet, depends on what sort of results I get trying
them out.
In fact I think I'll see if I have the parts onhand, I have some time
tonight.

I bought a used head, did a boat load of mods with dummy load, L-pad,
yada yada...  all at less than HALF of your uneducated guess on price.

&gt;&gt; Kiss the sky Mark. Kiss the sky.

&gt;&gt; Christmas coming in the summer,

&gt;A swim at the beach and basking in 41C. With a humidity of 10% the
&gt;European toursits flock to Bondi, volunteer for life saving duty and
&gt;send postcards back to the UK invoking envy.
&gt;Salads and a BBQ, cold ham and cold beer, no egg nog. Hunting flies off the
&gt;roast dinner, get to celebrate News Years first in the World and party on in
&gt;the sultry heat of the night, with wild anitpodean women wearing less than a
&gt;loin cloth.

&gt;&gt; Cold weather happens  in July.
&gt;Under a clear bright blue sky, wet suit surfing as the huge southern swell
&gt;makes the envious cry. Torquay and Bell's pumps this time of the year as too
&gt;the break off Ballina, from Seal Rocks to Caloundra the glorious winter
&gt;swell hears the locals rejoice without drop-ins and enraged quips of,
&gt;&quot;bloody toursit&quot;.

&gt;&gt; Mark wont you tell me please brother
&gt;&gt; Is it a bummer down under getting high

&gt;Only bummer with winter here is the lack of daylight hours.
&gt;Read the weather for London, in summer they usually only manage 21C.
&gt;Here today it was 19C.
&gt;Only two frosts so far, no steam breath in the morning, lawns still need
&gt;mowing. I could grow tomatoes in this weather.
&gt;Four weeks max of temps around 15C, morning temps of 3C. Big deal, so you
&gt;wear shoes and not thongs (flip flops).
&gt;No snow, no blizzard unless you're silly enough to live above 1K metres.
&gt;Still shorts and t-shirt weather afaic. Worn a jumper (pullover /
&gt;sweatshirt) once this year.

&gt;I tell ya, it just sucks being an Aussie on the mid North Coast of NSW.
&gt;&lt;psssht - the crisp clean sound of opened cold beer&gt;

...Yeah, but no Frickin Water!

&gt;Hey Mark, that's really great.
&gt;Brilliant when you suddenly get some kind of sound you have tried for
&gt;and finally nail it.
&gt;I see you are using an Epiphone Valve Junior. I keep looking at the
&gt;idea of getting one of these and putting mods on it.
&gt;Have you seen the Thomann website in Germany - they have a range by
&gt;Harley Benton and a 5 watt valve combo amp which already has a tone
&gt;control. Apparently the circuit board is a direct copy of the Epiphone
&gt;one, it's nicely trimmed in cream vinyl and costs  a mssive £65.86

&gt; http://www.thomann.de/gb/harley_benton_ga5.htm

&gt;Might go for one of these. What mods have you done to your VJ and is
&gt;it a combo or an amp head? Are you in the UK like me by the way?

... be prepared for a long wait. I ordered mine in early May... not
due 'til mid Aug...

Yes its made by Epiphone for them - Harley Benton is Thomann's house
brand. There is also another exact Epi copy for another company too -
just different badge logo. But they seem to think somehow they can ask
a premium in price over Epiphone!

You might want to verify that with Epiphone.
