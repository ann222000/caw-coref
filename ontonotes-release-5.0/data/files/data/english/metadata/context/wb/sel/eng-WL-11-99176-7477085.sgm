In the post just below this one, I hearkened back to a 2003 post in which I began the subject of comparing the world's problems, and in which I noted that hunger kills nine million people each year. Yesterday, if you read the paper carefully, and if it was in your paper (it wasn't in the one I read, so hat tip to Lenin's Tomb ), you might have seen this short article (not worthy of any serious reporting, and certainly not a subject for the cable news shows):

Hunger and malnutrition kill 18,000 children daily [6.6 million/year, children alone, not including adults] around the world and 850 million people go to bed every night with empty stomachs, according to the leader of the U.N. food agency.

The U.N. person in question added, ""This is a shameful fact -- a terrible indictment of the world in 2007, and it's an issue that needs to be solved." He's certainly right. But unfortunately, Cuban Foreign Minister Felipe Perez Roque had something to say about that back in 2004 when he addressed the U.N.:

"Every year at the United Nations we go through the same ritual. We attend the general debate knowing beforehand that the clamor for justice and peace by our underdeveloped countries will be ignored once again. However, we persist. We know that we are right."

In that speech, Perez Roque reminded the audience of something that Fidel Castro had said from the very same podium in 1979, 25 years earlier:

"The noise of weapons, of the menacing language, of the haughtiness on the international scene must cease. Enough of the illusion that the problems of the world can be solved by nuclear weapons. Bombs may kill the hungry, the sick and the ignorant, but bombs cannot kill hunger, disease and ignorance. Nor can bombs kill the righteous rebellion of the people..."

How true those words were then, and how sadly even more so they ring true today, even if the money that could be used to address hunger and the myriad other problems of the world's people is being spent less on nuclear weapons than on "conventional" ones and on murderous wars of aggression like the ones being conducted in Iraq, Afghanistan, Somalia, and recently in Lebanon as well. Trillions of dollars spent, millions of lives destroyed, and far from solving any of the world's problems, they have only exacerbated them.

Happy [U.S.} President's Day to you too! Decades of genocide and conquest, overt and covert warfare, going back to the beginning.

And a Happy President's Day to you, too, military men and women.

I'm not sure what you can do to influence people whose characters seem to be lacking the element of shame. I'm afraid there may be nothing to do.

It amazes how often I get into a 'discussion' with someone who wants to 'prove' to me that the strength of the military is what keeps peace. And who feel 'war' solves problems.

Another discussion recently made me realize how little the average person comprehends about what happens, what really happens in a war zone. The average American, I am afriad, feels that the good guys win and bad guys get hurt. They have no conception of the chaos, the violence, the unchecked horrible surealism of a war zone. My father was a US Marine and fought in Korea, he rarely discusses any of it but to remind me of how the violence in enveloping. That children and old people and the poor are even more likely to be victims. Bad, bad things happen and law and order are out the window. It is this chaos we are subjecting the nation of Iraq to, and we wonder why they don't love us.

that would be surreal too, although who knows if the pollies ever mean anything they say, Im quite sure most of them can convince themselves of just about anything for at least a short period.
