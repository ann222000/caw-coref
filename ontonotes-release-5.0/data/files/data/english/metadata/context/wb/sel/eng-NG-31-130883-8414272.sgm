If literature truly reflects society, then the end of the Harry Potter
series spells trouble for us all.

Because, after 10 years, 4,195 pages, and over 325 million copies,
J.K. Rowling's towering achievement lacks the cornerstone of almost
all great children's literature: the hero's moral journey. Without
that foundation, her story - for all its epic trappings of good versus
evil - is stuck in a moral no man's land.

To be clear: This isn't a critique of Ms. Rowling's values. It's a
recognition of a disturbing trend in commercial storytelling and
Western society.

For those who've yet to finish &quot;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows,&quot;
stop reading now: There are spoilers ahead. If you did, however,
embark on a Deathly Hallows marathon, you know that the shady Severus
Snape died, not in the name of evil, but in the name of good.

Oh, yeah. And Harry defeated Voldemort. Good prevailed. The problem
is, that's not the moral of the story. Good always prevails. It's the
hero's struggle - and costly redemption - that matters.

Classic tales such as J.R.R. Tolkien's &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; trilogy and
Madeleine L'Engle's &quot;A Wrinkle in Time&quot; set the standard for
children's fiction. With their unrelenting drive toward &quot;the moral of
the story,&quot; they form a golden thread in the West's cultural fabric.
And yet, like the society in which we live, storytelling itself has,
in recent decades, undergone a radical transformation - sliding toward
moral ambivalence with alarming speed.

I'm not advocating for the kind of didacticism that dominated Puritan
and Victorian children's fiction. Times change. Arguably, postwar,
post-Depression America needed the escape value of Disney's
adaptations of &quot;Snow White&quot; and &quot;Cinderella.&quot; It was a marriage of
storytelling and meaning-making quite apart from what the Brothers
Grimm envisaged a century before. But while Disney's focus was
entertainment, the moral still mattered. And that moral center has all
but vanished from much of today's pop culture.

Successful storytelling rests on a few basic principles. One of them
is this: A story is about someone who changes, who grows through a
moral struggle. What is Harry's struggle? Exactly.

Throughout the series, but especially in book seven, even Harry's
darkest moments - of self-doubt, of disillusionment, of skepticism
about his greatest mentor, Dumbledore - never ring true. Was there any
doubt that Harry would fulfill the task set out for him?

The truth of the matter is that Harry the character had nowhere to go.
And thus, the overarching moral dilemma of the series, the compelling
inner crisis that begged resolution, had nothing to do with our
beloved hero.

First principle of storytellingBack to that first principle of
storytelling: A story is about someone who changes. And, puberty
aside, Harry doesn't change much. As envisioned by Rowling, he walks
the path of good so unwaveringly that his final victory over Voldemort
feels, not just inevitable, but hollow.

But there is one character who does face a compelling inner crisis:
Snape. With all the debate - and with all of Rowling's clues - about
whether he was good or bad, it's fair to say that the sallow-faced
potions professor has entranced many readers. His character ached for
resolution.

And it is precisely this need for resolution - our desire to know the
real Snape and to understand his choices - that makes him the most
compelling character in the Potter epic. His decisions, not Harry's,
were the linchpin. And his moment with Dumbledore after the death of
Harry's parents, not Harry's last duel with Voldemort, is the
authentic climax of the series.

For Harry, there was no choice. The way forward was clear, the
conflict - and journey - external. We cared about Snape because this
was not the nature of his story. Every action was weighted with the
pain and subtext of his choices, or lack thereof. For Snape, there
weren't - there couldn't be - any easy answers. And yet, in the end,
his moral journey was overshadowed by this fact: It was merely one
more plot device to propel Harry toward his pre-destined victory.

Snape: the authentic protagonistRowling has publicly expressed
mystification over her readers' fascination with Snape, even
suggesting that his appeal is simply &quot;the bad boy syndrome.&quot; Instead,
her readers, whether consciously or not, have tapped into something
that Rowling herself may have failed to recognize.

That something was a need for a protagonist who genuinely struggled to
define - and do - the right thing. A passive main character with no
authentic moral dilemma is not only hard to relate to, he or she is
also no guide in circumstances in which right and wrong are anything
less than black and white.

In a society increasingly steeped in moral relativism, it's not the
Harrys of the world who will make a difference. It's the Snapes. It's
those who need redemption, then choose it. It's those willing to press
on and fail and then to press on again - especially when there are no
clear answers.

There is much to love about the Harry Potter series, from its
brilliantly realized magical world to its multilayered narrative.
Unfortunately, Rowling did her readers a great disservice by making
the story about Harry when it really should have been about Snape.

And yet, it's hard to imagine Snape's story emerging from a society
where entertainment is king - and where the moral of the story is that
there's seldom a moral at all.

I agree with this quite a bit.  I have never felt much for most of the
main characters for this reason.
