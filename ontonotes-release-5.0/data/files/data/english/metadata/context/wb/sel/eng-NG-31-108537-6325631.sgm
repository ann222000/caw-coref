Sometimes this layman ponders evolutionary mechanisms in the abstract.

Let me explain.

We are all too familiar with the wide-spread popular notion of "survival of
the fittest."
As this layman has submitted previously (and shall not beat the drum again
here), he
discerns that the expression "survival of the fittest" is at worst a begging
of a circular
logic, wherein that which is most fit survives, and the way we know --
therefore -- what
species or individual is most fit?  Because it's still here.

But, again, that is at its worst.  And this layman, liking to look at all
the various sides
of any idea, does not wish to bog down in any logically circular cul de sac,
but wishes
to see as much sense as can be seen.  And, as far as the term "fitness"
having a pragmatic
value in research, there is no question of it.  "Fitness" is the quality of
*having* survived.
That is not the question at issue.  The question at issue for this layman is
one of whether
the notion of "survival of the fittest" falls into the category of logical
fallacy known as
"hoc, ergo proctor hoc."

If two motor vehicles collide at an intersection, and the driver of the one
vehicle lives
to drive another day, while the other does not, just how much can we read
into that
about which driver was the most fit to survive.

You see, if all things were equal (which they NEVER are), and the
distribution of the
force and direction of sudden negative acceleration were *precisely* divided
up between
the two vehicles, at the same locations on the vehicles... and if both
vehicles involved
were of exactly the same kind, and exactly the same state of repair, and the
drivers were
seated in exactly the same positions, and each driver was in the same age
range in which
humans have reproductive capacity, and each were of the same sex, and both
were
hetero-erotic in their choices of conjugal mates... and at least a hundred
other variables
all were identical, equal, balanced and unvarying... and only one driver
died, while the
other went home and ended up parenting at least one more child... then and
ONLY then...
would we be justified in assigning to the surviving driver a survival
resulting from a
quality called "fitness."

But, then, the question arises of, "Okay, what if we look at a larger
sampling of motor
vehicle accidents, where one driver walks away and the other goes to a
funeral home.
Can we not assume that a sufficient number of trials has taken place for
many of the
variables to wash... average out... whatever?  Can we not assume safely that
the most
fit drivers, on average, tend to be the ones who survive?

Well, that depends.  Are healthy robust teenage drivers not more likely to
get into, and
die from, motor vehicle accidents and hence statistically more likely not to
reproduce
than... people who have been teenagers and now are young,
still-reproductively capable
adults?

Hey, here's another issue.  Aren't almost half of all motor vehicle
accidents alcohol
related?  Oh, okay.  Then we know that if it's almost, then MORE than half
of them
are sobriety related.  Right?  So, statistically we know that sober
drivers -- being in the
majority -- ought to be gotten off the streets.  Right?

No?   Well, why not?  We are looking at the numbers, and drawing conclusions
from
them, are we not?  If we remove from the traffic arteries all the people who
are in the
category involved in most of the accidents, non-fatal and fatal alike...
then we reduce
traffic deaths by more than if we remove the lesser category of drunk
drivers, do we
not?

Okay.  Enough frivolity.  The point can be summed up with this little saw:

****Logic constructs never lie
****Sometimes they just DON'T  APPLY

In the foregoing silliness, many fallacious positings are implied.  One
silly and
fallacious implication is that all drivers who die in motor vehicle
accidents can be
divided into two categories:  the fit and the dead.

Another silly fallacy is to assume that all traffic accident deaths and all
plant and
animal deaths arise out of the same set of causes acting upon the same set
of
qualities, because all the variables cancel out each variable against each
other
variable.

Am I saying that all motor vehicle deaths are totally random, and that we
cannot
draw any accurate or useful conclusions from them?  Heck no.  But neither am
I willing to concede that we can divide things into classes, just because
clear
boundaries can be found to divide a population into two categories, with no
residuals (everyone involved in a traffic accident has a blood titer of
X-amount
of an illegal substance, or he/she does not).

The categories into which we divide things, and the algorithms we pick to
plug them into, can be factual and empirical.  The categories we divide
things
into can be quite clear and precise, and leave no residuals or exceptions.
The
algorithms we pick to plug our facts and classifications into can be
pristine in
their logic.  And STILL we can come out with nonsense conclusions.

If this old layman comes up with some speculative ideas on the issue of
"evolutionary mechanisms," he will try to be positive, rather than negative.
This message has just tried to clear a little fog out of the popular air on
one notion that does not seem to this layman to hold water.  It remains to
be
seen, however, whether there are some mechanisms that are less foggy than
the one roasted here.

But please keep in mind that this layman did not say "fitness" is not a
useful
concept in laboratory and field.  It is VERY useful and good where it is
applied as a comparative measurement of how many of a population survives
in two or more trials, where variables are minimal, where categorizations
are
appropriate, where an algorithm is appropriate to producing data that makes
sense, and where what is conceived of as an evolutionary mechanism (if that
kind of designation is made) actually is one.

JE:-
The philosopher Herbert Spencer who coined the tautology "survival of the
fittest" which remains to this very day the most common identification of
what evolutionary theory is supposed to be (an amazing but entirely
unfortunate achievement) did NOT provide a defined subject for "survival" as
in: "the survival of exactly WHAT?".

Tautologies can be a predicated subject forming a non tautology or remain
just a non predicated circular argument. A subject and predicate cannot
exist within just a tautology simply because every logical connection
remains reversible. In the reasoning process only the predicate can
constitute a valid inductive inference (not the subject) requiring a non
reversible logical link in just the one way: FROM subject TO the predicate.
This is because the subject must be able to be deduced from the assumed
predicate and the predicate induced from the subject. A rational test of the
predicate is that, at the very least, the subject can be deduced from it. If
no predicate exists then no subject by deduction is all that is possible,
therefore no rationale.

Tautologies can be continuously expanded (e.g. mathematics). However they
only remain rational if they can be deduced from a NON tautology (become the
subject of an assumed predicate and not the reverse). I consider this is
what Gödel has proven. All of mathematics remains just a tautology which can
only remain rational if mathematics is entirely deductive from a predicate
outside of mathematics. I propose that this predicate is the supposition of
the universal set.

If we propose that Spencer's survival predicate remained subject to an
"organism" we end up with this non tautology: Those organisms (subject)
which survive longer (predicate) are considered fitter only because they
must eventually replace shorter living organisms over time. While this non
tautology does makes sense it is NOT necessarily correct. An organism that
only lives longer does not necessarily replace shorter living organisms over
time because it has to reproduce more to be able to do that. The correct
subject and predicate is not "organism and survival" it is "organism and
reproduction": Those organisms which reproduce more per population are
considered fitter than those which reproduce less simply because only those
which reproduce more can ever replace others over time, no matter how short
in life span the fitter organism happens to be. Not only did Spencer leave
his survival predicate without a defined subject, he also used entirely the
wrong predicate!

Today, "survival of the fittest" means "phylogenetic gene survival" where
"gene" replaces "organism" as the defined subject. However the "survival"
predicate only remains ambiguous. Here is a website which describes what
phylogeny is:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogeny

As just a NON predicated tautology: Those genes which survive
phylogenetically remain the fittest only because they phylogenetically
survive! If we now employ a gene subject instead of the organism subject
(which we used above) this becomes: Those genes which phylogenetically
survive longer are considered fitter only because they must eventually
replace shorter phylogenetically living genes. However, this non tautology
remains ambiguous because phylogenetic gene "survival" is exactly the same
thing as gene _replication_ which in turn is the same as organism
reproduction. Only gene _replicates_ as "gene survival" can allow one gene
type to "phylogenetically survive longer" where in nature these replications
are all via organism reproductions. Even an exact replicate of a thing is
never "the thing in itself" simply because it can occupy a different space
and time. Phylogenetic gene replication can only mean organism reproduction
because a phylogeny (or phylogenesis) "is the origin and evolution of a set
of organisms, usually a set of species" (quote from the above website).

Gene populations expanding _within_ organisms do not constitute a phylogeny
of genes within evolutionary theory. It is the organism induction which
includes organism reproduction which remains absolutely essential for any
testable evolutionary science. In fact, each organism must also be fertile
just to be able to replicate genes phylogenetically allowing better
"phylogenetic survival"! IOW the Darwinian selectee is exactly one fertile
organism and not just any organism.

Quite obviously, the gene centric argument is just a massive
simplification/oversimplification of the Darwinian fertile organism centric
argument. Yet the Neo Darwinistic gene centric argument was and remains to
this very day, chronically misused as a _replacement_ for the Darwinian
fertile organism centric argument (which just remains invisible because of
the extraordinary level of bias that misused heuristic gene centricity has
spawned).

Eloquent, John.  Thank you.  And I appreciate benefit of your much wider
reading.

I do seem to recall a description of selection, in nature, as being "red of
tooth and claw," in Darwin's own written words.  (Perhaps I should purchase
a copy, to check back on such memories to see if they are accurate.)
Assuming this is an accurate recollection on my part, it is a bit hazy to me
where that assertion of Darwin's leaves off and
the idea behind Spencer's phrase begins.

Would be very grateful for your excellent insight into that.

Thank you,

&gt;&gt; You see, if all things were equal (which they NEVER are), and the
&gt;&gt; distribution of the
&gt;&gt; force and direction of sudden negative acceleration were *precisely*
&gt;&gt; divided
&gt;&gt; up between
&gt;&gt; the two vehicles, at the same locations on the vehicles... and if both
&gt;&gt; vehicles involved
&gt;&gt; were of exactly the same kind, and exactly the same state of repair, and
&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt; drivers were
&gt;&gt; seated in exactly the same positions, and each driver was in the same age
&gt;&gt; range in which
&gt;&gt; humans have reproductive capacity, and each were of the same sex, and
&gt;&gt; both
&gt;&gt; were
&gt;&gt; hetero-erotic in their choices of conjugal mates... and at least a
&gt;&gt; hundred
&gt;&gt; other variables
&gt;&gt; all were identical, equal, balanced and unvarying... and only one driver
&gt;&gt; died, while the
&gt;&gt; other went home and ended up parenting at least one more child... then
&gt;&gt; and
&gt;&gt; ONLY then...
&gt;&gt; would we be justified in assigning to the surviving driver a survival
&gt;&gt; resulting from a
&gt;&gt; quality called &quot;fitness.&quot;

&gt;&gt; But, then, the question arises of, &quot;Okay, what if we look at a larger
&gt;&gt; sampling of motor
&gt;&gt; vehicle accidents, where one driver walks away and the other goes to a
&gt;&gt; funeral home.
&gt;&gt; Can we not assume that a sufficient number of trials has taken place for
&gt;&gt; many of the
&gt;&gt; variables to wash... average out... whatever?  Can we not assume safely
&gt;&gt; that
&gt;&gt; the most
&gt;&gt; fit drivers, on average, tend to be the ones who survive?

&gt;&gt; Well, that depends.  Are healthy robust teenage drivers not more likely
&gt;&gt; to
&gt;&gt; get into, and
&gt;&gt; die from, motor vehicle accidents and hence statistically more likely not
&gt;&gt; to
&gt;&gt; reproduce
&gt;&gt; than... people who have been teenagers and now are young,
&gt;&gt; still-reproductively capable
&gt;&gt; adults?

&gt;&gt; Hey, here's another issue.  Aren't almost half of all motor vehicle
&gt;&gt; accidents alcohol
&gt;&gt; related?  Oh, okay.  Then we know that if it's almost, then MORE than
&gt;&gt; half
&gt;&gt; of them
&gt;&gt; are sobriety related.  Right?  So, statistically we know that sober
&gt;&gt; drivers -- being in the
&gt;&gt; majority -- ought to be gotten off the streets.  Right?

&gt;&gt; No?   Well, why not?  We are looking at the numbers, and drawing
&gt;&gt; conclusions
&gt;&gt; from
&gt;&gt; them, are we not?  If we remove from the traffic arteries all the people
&gt;&gt; who
&gt;&gt; are in the
&gt;&gt; category involved in most of the accidents, non-fatal and fatal alike...
&gt;&gt; then we reduce
&gt;&gt; traffic deaths by more than if we remove the lesser category of drunk
&gt;&gt; drivers, do we
&gt;&gt; not?

&gt;&gt; Okay.  Enough frivolity.  The point can be summed up with this little
&gt;&gt; saw:

&gt;&gt; ****Logic constructs never lie
&gt;&gt; ****Sometimes they just DON'T  APPLY

&gt;&gt; In the foregoing silliness, many fallacious positings are implied.  One

My comments on John S. Wilkins' comment on the article at
link provided by Tim Tyler.  (See below.)

Perhaps you might rebut, or rewrite that article, John.  I,
for one, would be delighted to read what you would write.

MEANTIME, let me convey that I am surprised no one (yet)
has corrected me on my rather not-quite-right defining of
"fitness" as the *concept* is well-utilized by researchers.

(See in this paragraph.)  As you can see, this old layman is
about trying to understand things -- not take intractable
stances.  "Fitness," as the term is used in peer-reviewed
writings applies to more than just (as I too narrowly put
it) *having* just survived.  It is at least broad enough to
mean "survived and reproduced" and may might ought to
include "survived and reproduced offspring capable, also
of surviving and reproducing, and in sufficient numbers
to maintain their niche in a given ecology."

Does that accord with what some posters who are actually
in research, and actually have written papers for peer-review
would include, and not exclude, as covering your usage of it?

Aatu,

I, too, sense in John's assertions at times some commitments to
metaphors that rest upon postulational eclecticisms different from
my own; and I realize that -- to challenge John on his own
postulatational choices -- is difficult.  That is to say, GIVEN his
assumptions, he seems inclined to resort back to them.

But this does not make John so very different from most of the
brightest individuals I have met in all my humble little life.  Most
of them seem to me to be inclined to have been inculcated
(acculturated) to accept certain choices of postulates in their lives,
OR to have examined many alternative postulates about this
life, and accommodated their own intuitions about them to the
point of *internalizing* them.  That is to say, that they have
arrived at their own unique eclectic of stances and have -- in
their own minds -- substituted them for "givens."

In my own life and thoughts, I strive humbly, sincerely, diligently
to open my mind and to defer to the fact, at least, that other
postulational stances than those I have been "taught" to prefer,
or that I have selected for my own belief system, are not "givens"
but intellectual choices.

This allows me personal intellectual freedom to reach different
conclusions than others reach, and still appreciate their "logical"
conclusions which differ from my own.

At one time in my many decades of living, I was bound up in a
belief that only rigorous postulational thinking, whereby specifically
defined terms, crystal clear unambiguous postulates regarding them,
and precise manipulations of those by logical operations,
constituted the epitome of sound reasoning.

HOWEVER, I found myself unable to apply such definitions to the
real world, unable to be certain which postulates complied with
which material reality precisely, and unable to determine WHICH
formal logic operations apply to the analysis of which actual set of
phenomena in this "reality" where different operations apply to
different scenarios.  The sensory lens (as a generalized metaphor
to encompass all the human so-called direct sensory experiencing,
direct and indirect) does not allow me -- nor anyone -- to have
exhaustive "knowledge" of all the parameters of anything, to
discern all the mechanisms at work in the progress of things I
perceive only in part, nor to know in every case what algorithm
is "the" algorithm playing out in each natural set of phenomena.

We humans are forced to rely upon "informal logic" -- although this
might seem to be an oxymoron if we think of logic as fixed and
inflexible, or otherwise not logical.

As I experience John's views, in many instances, I find I do not
agree with him, but nonetheless can see, in a sense, his wheels
turning.  If I allow him in my mind his own postulational stance,
as a set of *GIVENS*, then he is usually "right."

The problem is that I do not concur with some of the postulational
stances John seems to have "internalized" at the very bottom-most
level of his hierarchy of informal logic.  That being the case, I
simply read his conclusions reached, and allow myself to be
stimulated to articulate in my own thoughts where some of the
things John seems to perceive to be "GIVENS" are eclectic
assumptions (postulations) to which I believe he is entitled but,
also, which are not "self-evident" nor empirically provable nor
disprovable.

But... I know a few bona fide geniuses who are more set in their
convictions and philosophical commitments even... than John is.

I certainly do see eye to eye with you on the assertion that the
idea of a "universal set," is *UNDEFINED* in any applied
sense.

Just as Pi is indeterminate, the so-called "universe" as that which
even the smartest and most creative of mankind's greatest physicists
only attempt vainly to circumscribe in their imaginations, my not
be all there is "out there."  For all we know, our universe may be
but one of many.  For all we know, space cannot be proved to be
terminate.  And, it would boggle the mind of ANY human genius,
I submit, to answer the question of whether matter in the entirety
of all space (which I perceive to be infinite) contains a finite
amount of mass.  After all, the only way we might prove it is
determinate would be to go to the outer edge of something that
may have no edge.  And if there is no end to space for matter to
occupy, then how could the amount of matter occupying it be
determinate?

We do not know.  Formal logic cannot answer such questions.

Therefore, how could we even IMAGINE "the universal set" as
a concept or a term to definable?

Just as you have asserted, there is a meaning which attaches to
a "universal set" as when we make an abstract set of an entirety
of things we have circumscribed as being all that we shall
postulate to be included in it.  But in nature, it is, and shall
forever be -- it seems to this old layman -- indefinable.

Mr Koskensilta,

I strongly suggest you replace your consistent rhetoric (previously I was
accused of "babbling" and now I am accused of "metaphorical rambling") with
NON EVASION. Your _continuous evasion_ of my detailed reply to you as to why
I argue Gödel proved that mathematics was and remains just a tautology does
not add any credibility to your position:

-------------------------2nd  repost --------------------------------

I am only referring to the logical connection between G and T and not to
what they represent because it remains irrelevant to this argument.

There are only THREE possible logical linkages:

1) G is irreversibly logically linked to T

Indicated by: G --&gt; T

2) T is irreversibly logically linked to G

Indicated by: T --&gt; G

Where: 1 contradicts 2 and of course 2 contradicts 1.

3) G and T remain reversibly logically linked

Indicated by: G &lt;--&gt; T or T &lt;--&gt; G

Please answer if you agree or disagree.

">

JE:-
I have read the article with exasperation. AT NO TIME does Torkel Franzén
even mention the concept of a TAUTOLOGY let alone include
how it necessarily contrasts to a NON tautology within any
RATIONAL system. The closest we seem to get to this seems to be:

"Gödel's proof makes essential use of what is called the diagonal lemma for
T. This is a general result about T stating that for every formula B(x) with
one free variable x - meaning that B(x) asserts something about the
unspecified number x - a formula A (known as a fixpoint for B(x)) can be
constructed such that

T |- A&lt;=&gt;B(#A)"

Perhaps you might to like explain why "&lt;=&gt;" does not mean "entirely
reversible" proving just a tautologous logical linkage?

Franzen clearly noted what he considers to be a CORRECT statement in WORDS
(i.e. as a non reversible rational proposition with a subject and a
predicate) as to what Gödel had discovered:

"The mathematician Godel proved that a system of axioms can never be based
on itself: statements from outside the system must be used in order to prove
its consistency."

But all the axioms of mathematics remain logically _reversible_
(tautologous). If you disagree then please provide one that isn't.As any
rationalist knows (but it appears not any logician or mathematician knows),
what Franzen wrote (above) is 100% diagnostic of a tautology. This is
because subject and predicate can only remain entirely reversible within a
tautology. For any tautology to become RATIONAL it has to constitute the
subject of a predicate (NOT the reverse) where the predicate can only exist
OUTSIDE of the tautology and not inside of it. IOW, a tautology must remain
entirely deductive from a NON tautology within a RATIONAL PROPOSITION.

&gt; Though there are certain marginal set theories with a universal set,

">

JE:-
As I previously mentioned Gödel contested Russell and Whitehead. Russell's
Paradox only provided an infinite regress "solution" to the question what is
the set of sets?". Paradoxes do not exist. All of them remain diagnostic of
the IRRATIONAL.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell's_paradox

from the above webpage:
"Russell and Alfred North Whitehead wrote the three volumes of Principia
Mathematica (PM) hoping to succeed where Frege had failed. They sought to
banish the paradoxes of naive set theory by employing a theory of types they
devised for this purpose. While they succeeded in grounding arithmetic in a
fashion, it is not at all evident that they did so by logic alone. In any
event, Kurt Gödel in 1930-31 proved that the logic of much of PM, now known
as first order logic, is complete, but that Peano arithmetic is necessarily
incomplete if it is consistent. There and then, the logicist program of
Frege-PM died."

Your argument that "though there are certain marginal set theories with a
universal set, such a set is not a part of ordinary mathematics or set
theory" was not correct. Venn diagrams which (only illustrate intersecting
sets and not nested sets) have to (and are) PREDFICATED on the rectangle of
the universal set simply because they have to exist within something (within
at least ONE NESTED SET). However, I entirely agree that as far as
mathematics is concerned, after the universal set predicate has been defined
it was just ignored within mathematics. However, it ceases to be able to
remain ignored whenever anybody questions what mathematics is predicated on
(for obvious reasons). Only rationalists ask such questions (NOT logicians
or mathematicians). Gödel remains unique because he was all of these. I
might add, so are all the best evolutionary theorists. The worst
evolutionary theorists are mathematicians who offer theories without any
frame of reference

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; In any
&gt; case, it is difficult to see how the &quot;supposition of the universal set&quot;
&gt; is &quot;outside of mathematics&quot;.
">

JE:-
It remains easy to see: the universal set is the defined PREDICATE, i.e. the
INDUCTIVE ASSUMPTION from which everything else exists as just a deduction
(including all tautologies nested within it).

I think you are thinking of the line from Tennyson, "nature red in tooth

And on the subject of tautology, one of the popular writers on evolution

yes "survival of the fittest" was in part tautological, but that this is
often true of powerful scientific explanations.

The phrase "red in tooth and claw" is not in itself a tautology but it is a
_gross_ misunderstanding of the rationale of nature. Humans see everything
about nature in their own perceived image where the worst possible image we
have of ourselves is human warfare. We actually think that nature is just
one almighty battleground something like our unique super tribal experiment
appears to be to us. Predators are not at war with their prey and most
battles between members of the same species remain heavily ritualized
minimizing and not maximizing, damage. Leigh Van Valen popularized a non
existent war within nature with what has become known within evolutionary
theory as the "Red Queen" in 1973:

http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/REDQUEEN.html

The "Red Queen" as Lewis Carroll's "Through the Looking Glass", runs harder
and harder just to stay in the same place. I refer to Prof. Felsenstein as
Carroll's "Mad Hatter" because of his recalcitrant misuse of tautologous
models (unlike Van Valen Felsenstein appears not to appreciate the more
humorous side of things). Nature is simply not as stupid as she is being
made out to be by Neo Darwinists. Unlike us, nature exploits fertile
organism fitness mutualism to the fullest extent possible and does not
bother with just tautologous notions of organism fitness "altruism" and
organism fitness "selfishness". Because they have no frame of reference
nobody can tell them apart, anyway.

The battles within nature are for just the one thing: to increase fitness
per fertile form per population (as a falsifiable maximand) on entirely a
MUTUALIZED basis. This can be put another way: since we all have to die
anyway because to the laws of physics and chance, the best time to die is
when your death can increase your our own fitness. Yes folks, we are all
searching for the best time to die because to pick the worst time is simply
a waste of a resource as far as nature is concerned. One of the jobs of the
predator is to help find it. If they do a good job then they will have more
and not less to eat next season. No fitness altruism is ever involved. The
clearest example I know of are salmon. The best time to die for them is
after they have spawned which provides the climax for one of the most
amazing journeys in natural history: from the Sargasso sea to the fresh
water stream where they were born. How they find where they born is amazing
in itself if that was all there was to it. This last journey requires just
humble creatures to leap waterfalls (not only fall over them) guarded by
hungry bears etc and after that, somehow negotiate a way around the many
barriers erected by man. Before mating the males physiologically change
shape in such a drastic way that their mouth becomes a dueling tool which
does not allow them to feed. They do not need to because they are all doomed
to self destruct. The mutualising point of this part of the battle is to
divide up the area where they were born into the best number of breeding
areas within which to fertilize and lay their eggs. If the salmon get this
right then their spawn will not over eat their prey only leaving a decimated
ecosystem for them to negotiate themselves back to. When this final battle
is complete tons of fish become deposited to feed the ecosystem which must
feed these dead parents fry after every adult salmon has died via its own
hand (via their over production of stress hormones).

&gt; This issue has been done to death already, IMO:

Lets have a quick look:-

The webpage starts:-
"The simple version of the so-called 'tautology argument' is this:
Natural selection is the survival of the fittest. The fittest are those that
survive. Therefore, evolution by natural selection is a tautology (a
circular definition).

JE:-
Correct. As Spencer stated it, "survival of the fittest" is indeed, just a
tautology. However the reason why this hits a raw nerve is because
mathematics is also just a tautology where Neo Darwinism remains entirely
based on tautologous mathematics, e.g. Hamilton's Rule. Refer also to
Felsenstein's (unsolved) Cost of Substitution paradox (see post). The proof
of a tautology is the absence of any frame of reference. This frame can only
be a constant term within mathematics where mathematics has no ability to
define one.

The webpage continues:-
"The real significance of this argument is not the argument itself, but that
it was taken seriously by any professional philosophers at all. 'Fitness' to
Darwin meant not those that survive, but those that could be expected to
survive because of their adaptations and functional efficiency, when
compared to others in the population. "This is not a tautology,....

JE:-
Incorrect, it remains a tautology.

The webpage continues:-
".....or, if it is, then so is the Newtonian equation F=ma [Sober 1984,
chapter 2], which is the basis for a lot of ordinary physical explanation."

JE:-
The equation F=ma is not a tautology only because m represents a constant
(NOT a variable) which denotes an independent event of Newtonian physics.
Every time m changes the event changes because the total mass of the
universe remains constant as the simple sum of each m per (independent)
event of physics.

Darwin did not employ the concept of fitness. This remains Herbert Spencer's
contribution. What Darwin stressed was the number of young raised to
adulthood within a population. This means they have to be able to be
"expected to survive because of their adaptations and functional efficiency"
to FERTILE ADULTHOOD SO THAT THEY COULD REPRODUCE. Survival only sets a
limit to reproduction but it cannot set a reproductive maximum. Maximizing a
life span does not necessarily mean you have maximized reproduction. It may
mean that you have minimized reproduction. Due to limited and not unlimited
resources, the best thing to do is free up as many resources as possible for
reproduction by minimizing resources consumed by survival. The logical
relationship between survival and reproduction remains NON reversible: you
have to survive just to be able to reproduce but you do not need to
reproduce in order to survive. Of course this does not apply if you are
talking about phylogenetic "survival" which was and remains an entirely
_ambiguous_ concept.

In my opinion Spencer's tautology "survival of the fittest" has not been
"done to death" it remains alive and kicking wrecking evolutionary theory to
this day. Talk origins needs to revise this paltry discussion of such an
important subject. Who wrote it?

iii)    Provide verifiable and refutable premises not just premises which

If I label terms differently (which I take great pains to avoid doing but I
may have to define new concepts with new labels because the concept has not

&gt; At one time in my many decades of living, I was bound up in a

JE:-
The scientific method is what you appear to be are searching for. It
solves the above problems in an evolutionary (NOT revolutionary) way.

The BIG problem today is that the scientific method has become invaded by
epistemologically illiterate mathematicians. Put more exactly: irrefutable
axioms of mathematics are NOT the basis of the reasoning process which is
applied by the sciences simply because all of these axioms remain
tautological.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; We humans are forced to rely upon &quot;informal logic&quot; -- although this

&gt; Perhaps you might rebut, or rewrite that article, John.  I,
&gt; for one, would be delighted to read what you would write.

&gt; MEANTIME, let me convey that I am surprised no one (yet)
&gt; has corrected me on my rather not-quite-right defining of
&gt; &quot;fitness&quot; as the *concept* is well-utilized by researchers.

&gt; (See in this paragraph.)  As you can see, this old layman is
&gt; about trying to understand things -- not take intractable
&gt; stances.  &quot;Fitness,&quot; as the term is used in peer-reviewed
&gt; writings applies to more than just (as I too narrowly put
&gt; it) *having* just survived.  It is at least broad enough to
&gt; mean &quot;survived and reproduced&quot; and may might ought to
&gt; include &quot;survived and reproduced offspring capable, also
&gt; of surviving and reproducing, and in sufficient numbers
&gt; to maintain their niche in a given ecology.&quot;
">

Fitness is IMO an abstract property of models of population genetics. It
basically means the "reproductive investment" (Fisher's preferred term)
in progeny over many generations. Any organism that has many surviving
descendants after at *least* three generations is fitter than one that
doesn't.

Fitness is also applied to variant traits, or alleles in genetics, and
the same thing applies - if the copy of the gene in one generation has
many descendant copies in a later generation, and a competing allele
doesn't, then it is fitter than that competitor.

Fitness has some philosophical accounts - one is the "propensity"
definition, in which the fitness of a gene/organism is its propensity to
survive and reproduce. Another is the frequency definition (basically
frequentist statistics of gene/organism variants).

The frequentist account leads to tautology - a fitter allele/organism
variant is just that which has more progeny after some number of
generations. It's true by definition, and hence doesn't explain why [but
remains true for all that]. But the propensity account is at best merely
a sketch, since the principle of natural selection fails to give any
account of the propensity.

In my view, NS is not an explanation of changes in the frequencies of
variants in a population; it's an explanation *sketch*. In short, it's
like a syllogistic form - you must plug in true values to get an actual
explanation. NS is not a mechanism, it's a form of dynamic adduced to
explain particular cases.

Sober noted that fitness was a "supervenient property" in his 1984 book
- the same fitness can be realised by many different physical systems -
a virus can have the same fitness as a flowering plant. But if any two
physical systems - say members of the same flower species - are
physically identical (in the relevant respects, and there's the rub)
they should have thye same fitness in the same environment.

But what are these "relevant respects"? The answer that satisfies me is
that they are those physical and biological properties of the organisms
that are identical with respect to a fitness account, that is, which
satisfy the criteria for inclusion in a population genetics model.
Hence, in my view, fitness is an abstraction, not a property of
realworld systems.

That's my stand this week, anyway.

Nontheless, the first five sentences correctly explain the issue
and its resolution:

``The simple version of the so-called 'tautology argument' is this:

JE:-
Tim has failed, the author has failed (just as Spencer failed) to identify
the correct PREDICATE for survival as in: survive for WHAT reason? Answer:
organism reproduction. For natural selection to become explicable, survival
as a predicate remains entirely _insufficient_.

The predicate of any sentence represents a critical induction while the
subject, just a deduction from it.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predicate_(grammar )

Survival predicated by reproduction means you must minimally survive to
fertile adulthood. The mind numbingly obvious proposition that genes locked
away within immature sterile bodies can only have a zero fitness simply
because, even though these genes may be able to replicate within that body
they have exactly a zero fitness until the body can reproduce itself.

As I previously pointed out "survive" remains hopelessly ambiguous unless it
becomes predicated by "reproduction" subject to "organism" because it can
become misconstrued to mean a gene centric form of phylogenetic survival.

I don't know if I can agree or not until you tell me (us) what you mean by

Do you mean it in the sense of "viable" - as in "having the potential to

If you do then my EPT recognition has always, and perfectly obviously
overlapped with yours.

IMHO, it is impossible to insist that organisms [of populations that evolve
by
way of the Principle of Natural (heritable variation) and Selection] who,
individually, were
*not even potentially* reproductive (hence, were never "candidates for
'ancestorhood' or 'forebearship'" :-)) were "selectees" [i.e., were selected
positively or negatively from by opportune and adverse types of
pressures/challenges in "individual life|space|time" - as part of the
Evolutionary Patterning Totality], and to be 'evolution-theoretically sane'
at the same time. ;-)

Here Torkel is just explaining a technical theorem pertaining certain
formal theories T. According to the diagonal lemma, as he explains, for
any formula B(x) we can find a formula A such that it is provable in T
that A is true just in case the Gödel number of A has the property
expressed by B(x). What this has to do with "entirely reversible" or
"tautologous logical linkage" cannot be determined unless you provide
some way of relating these notions to the standard logical notions of
formal provability, equivalence, Gödel numberings and so forth.

This is indeed a correct statement: a consistent system satisfying

As usually understood a universal set V is a set such that for every

John,

Much good will and much deserved respect.

But with all due good will and deserved respect, please allow me to assert
that my best efforts, so far, to believe that any human could define any
"natural" universal set would require that he know all things within that
set, lest he fail to have tweaked his definition sufficiently to encompass
the very last twit of it.

Also, I have not doubted for an instant that some human may have come
up with a pure logic definition that he has elected to name "the universal
set."
Indeed, it would surprise me if at least one human had not -- in view of the
fact that my experience leads me to believe that humans have come up with
innumerable definitions and provided them with some name for purposes of
reference.

What I do not personally ACCEPT, albeit I approve with much enthusiasm
YOUR right to accept it, if you wish -- is that there can be "the"
definition
of anything in nature derivable by any human mind, nor "the" definition of
anything in pure logic derived by any human mind.

Do I believe that man can, and should, TRY to arrive at "the" definition of
anything in nature?  Yes, so long as he does not delude himself that he has
capability of proving he has succeeded at it.  But rest assured that any
were to come along who know everything about everything, and that if you
and I likewise could, and that person were to provide us a definition of
"the"
universal set... I would certainly be willing to consider modifying my
choice
of "belief" on this point.  Let us not presume that human would be male,
although some would estimate the probability as approximately 50 %.

I personally elect, and feel justified in so electing, to be a bit skeptical
that
any definition of anything is "the" definition of it.  Can I prove it is
not?
No.  Nor do I believe you can prove that it is.  And this is, I think, a
perfect
example of the kind of thing I alluded to in saying elsewhere that I cannot
argue with anything that you say, John, if I grant you your choice of
I-believes (forsaking my own).

I am in total concurrence with Jack Nicholson's character in the movie
"A Few Good Men," who when asked to tell the "truth" about what was at
issue in a military court hearing, "You couldn't handle "the truth."

Nor, do I believe, could I.  We have not -- either you nor I -- access to
the
truth, but do each perceive we have at least a little exposure to some of
its consequences and its symptoms.  And... again all I offer is my
far-more-than-CASUALLY-thought-through and *tentatively held*
opinions on anything.  And, so far as I have been persuaded, neither has
any other human.

I know I've said it to death... but if even one reader doesn't know this,
I don't want to give the wrong impression.  But... Dr. Einstein once
asserted that he had tried (in coming up with some of his definitions,
or advanced-for-his-time perceptions, as I intuit them to have been)
to look at things as Gd (or gd) sees them.  Now let me be REMIND
that it DOES  NOT  MATTER whether he was referring to a deity or
to what an atheistic physicist would intend by it as the aggregate of
the aggregate sum of all existential algorithms playing out in the
aggregate sum of all nature.  It works either way.  Einstein sought to
put himself in that mode.  But then there came along for him to digest
some incompatibilities between micromechanical and quantum
mechanical "laws" which (so far as I know) NOBODY has reconciled.
And the thing about "rolling the dice" suggests to me that Dr. Einstein
withdrew from the Gd's mind arena, or gd's mind arena -- whichever
the case may be.

In any and every human contemplation (per the best of my humble
human capabilities to know or to understand anything) the
contemplation of anything and everything in nature tests human
capacity to be ingenious (no, not engenuous... but ingenious)...
a term I proffer here in tune with Bertrand Russell's definition of
genius...
a term which refers to what Nobel Laureate John Nash sought after...
and failed to attain... and a term which seems to me to coexist only
uncomfortably with Nash's stance that mathematics is a fiercely
competitive sport, or his stance that doing something with the mind
is far more sensible than attending classes on what others have done
with theirs.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;From the best of my experience and thoughts that I can come up
">

with, in contemplating your stance on any given thing, or the stance
of the greatest genius who ever may have lived, I perceive all the
highest and best any has to offer (so far) as tentative, as
not inclusive of all the information yet unknown to any, and as
likely to imply paradoxes we humans have no choice but to deny,
or accepting them..., to have to exercise genius to maintain the
ability to think rationally about them.

When I seek to comprehend what others have defined, I reserve the
right to do what I can with the elements they considered in my own
mind... if and to the extent I can... and if I  DISCERN MORE
elements to be worthy of consideration than any given human definer
has taken into account in his personal preferences among
unprovable assumptions, OR if I see that the blocks of reason can be
assembled (as in a Rubik's cube) in more than one order, then I am
skeptical that they have come up with anything aptly containing
the designation "the ".

I shall not be drawn into a discussion of truth/validity tables.  Neither
of us has any need of revisiting such well-worn drills.  Also, let me
share with you that I do not know of any mathematician who EVER
has defined all his terms and proved them all, beyond arbitrarily
closed models (consisting of definitions, operations eclectically
posited, and leading only to where that closed artifice leads, with
the snake of a closed validity model, propagating itself only by
hanging on tooth and claw to the tip of its own internally forced,
logical tail.

JE:-
Gil,
Any valid 100% self consistent induction of a universal set simply requires
a consistent definition of one (any one), i.e. one which includes a defined
"everything" _as well as itself_ as this set. Primitive tribes define the
universe as just their tribe. Primitive people on islands defined it as just
their island and the surrounding sea. We once defined it as just our earth
with the sun going and planets around it enclosed within crystalline
spheres. Non evolutionists define it to be some magic being. Science defines
it as all the laws of nature. Mathematicians define one only because they
HAVE TO and then forget about it as-quickly-as-possible:-) The list of could
be-universal-sets remains endless. All that concerns the rationalist is can
any of them be tested to refutation?

The universal set defined but unused within mathematics is an inductive
proposition of PHYSICS and *NOT* of mathematics. Russell's paradox attempted
to assume that the universal set must NOT contain itself so (predictably) he
only ended up with just an infinite regress (a tautology). This is the
empirical equivalent of Russell staring at himself in bewilderment between
two parallel mirrors :-)

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell's_paradox

The whole point of any self consistent proposition is not to enter
Epimenides paradox (absolutely contradict yourself), i.e. any proposition of
a universal set must also contain itself otherwise it does.

You appear to be doing a "David Hume": deleting induction (giving yourself a
cortical lobotomy) simply because you cannot explain it.

In the sciences (NOT MATHEMATICS) many CONTESTING definitions exist about
EVERYTHING (including what is a definition) only because they can be
separated by EMPIRICAL testing. Either we get off our arses and simply get
on with it or we just tautologically contemplate our own navels :-)

One problem I see with this is that the connection with
the supposed topic of discussion (biological evolution)
grows pretty tenuous.

Godel's theorem originally came up here recently because it
has been claimed (Lucas, Penrose) that it places limits on
machines which mean that they cannot perform the same
functions that the human mind can - and therefore are
unlikely to ever compete with our species for its ecological
niche - unless they can /also/ master some mystical/quantum
do-dah.

I have claimed that is baseless nonsense: Godel's theorems
are esoteric math about the completeness of axiomatic systems
that has diddley-squat to do with whether machines can match
and exceed the capabilities of modern humans.

Discussion of Godel's theorem which *doesn't* relate to this
whole issue will probably interest only a minority of subscribers.

People being attracted from abroad by debatable material
in John's posts is all very well - but my council to most
of them would be: please don't feed the Edser.

You claim to be a logician yet you seem not to have the faintest idea as to
what logic DOES: separates a sequitur from a non sequitur THAT IS ALL.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non_sequitur_%28logic%29

Any valid sequitur can have TWO forms: reversible and irreversible.

PLEASE indicate CLEARLY if you agree or disagree.

Language and computer programming can only allow a reversible sequitur as a
nested subset of an entirely irreversible sequitur. The sentence: "the cat
sat on the mat" does not have the same meaning as "the mat sat on the cat"
simply because subject and predicate cannot be reversed within any rational
language (or computer program). If you reverse them then you reverse their
critical set nesting. If I just define a cat to be mat, then a mat is also
just a cat where this entirely reversible sequitur (represented by just a
set intersection) is known as a TAUTOLOGY. Tautologies can be expanded
indefinitely becoming amazingly complex (as they are within mathematics).
However, they can have no rational meaning unless they become predicated to
something else in an entirely non reversible way: e.g. the matcat thing is
black but not all black things are matcat things. Only now can a matcat
claim to make rational sense. The predicate "black" constitutes a critical
induction from which the matcat thing must be able to be deduced. In the
sciences this allows inductions to be tested to refutation via ANY deduction
from them. All of reasoning remains based on just this one SIMPLE
proposition: IF the induction is true then ANY valid deduction from it MUST

I remain flabbergasted that you can see no connection between the above and
what Gödel discovered which Fanzen puts in (non reversible English) to
mean:-

"The mathematician Godel proved that a system of axioms can never be
based on itself: statements from outside the system must be used in order to
prove its consistency."

Please very carefully explain to all of us here why any rationalist cannot
just retort: Well, very OBVIOUSLY only because ALL of the axioms of
mathematics were and remain, TAUTOLOGIES. IF this is NOT true then please
provide just a single axiom which is not a tautology.

Your continued pretence that tautological sequiturs have no connection
what-so-ever to what Gödel discovered remains ludicrous. It appears to me
you are attempting to evade this issue simply because you do not wish
mathematics to be proven to be just a tautology (especially by Gödel). This
is why I said the thing I respect most about him was his complete honesty.
It takes real guts to prove that what the subject matter you have spent your
life on was not consistent. It takes even more guts to say WHY. It appears
you remain gutless.

&gt; &gt; The closest we seem to get to this seems to be:
&gt; &gt; &quot;Gödel's proof makes essential use of what is called the diagonal lemma

&gt; with
&gt; &gt; one free variable x - meaning that B(x) asserts something about the
&gt; &gt; unspecified number x - a formula A (known as a fixpoint for B(x)) can be

&gt; Here Torkel is just explaining a technical theorem pertaining certain
&gt; formal theories T. According to the diagonal lemma, as he explains, for
&gt; any formula B(x) we can find a formula A such that it is provable in T
&gt; that A is true just in case the Gödel number of A has the property
&gt; expressed by B(x). What this has to do with &quot;entirely reversible&quot; or

Every reference I have on the logic of mathematics defines a universal set

JE:-
I will firstly deal with any substance within Mr Tyler's post and
subsequently with this despicable act of denigration.

1. The substance:
Tyler's proposition that these theorems are just "esoteric math about the
completeness of axiomatic systems that has diddley-squat to do with whether
machines can match and exceed the capabilities of modern humans" remains NON
consistent with what Gödel actually discovered. IOW what Tyler wrote here
remains CONTRADITORY (which does NOT surprise me). Here is the proof: Torkel
Franzén (who I think most agree remains accurate) described in words (not in
just mathematics because this is not possible) what Gödel discovered:

"The mathematician Gödel proved that a system of axioms can never be based
on itself: statements from outside the system must be used in order to prove
its consistency."

Please note the following:

1) Propositions of mathematics and propositions OUTSIDE of mathematics are
required for Gödel's proofs to make any RATIONAL sense, i.e. not just
propositions within mathematics. This is because Gödel cannot rationally
claim to know what mathematics does not know within just the system of
mathematics and remain consistent to what he claims to have discovered.

2) Propositions within mathematics cannot express any propositions which are
outside of mathematics otherwise they must also be proposition of
mathematics.

3) No listing of the propositions outside of mathematics which Gödel proved
are required to make mathematics a consistent system are being offered by
Tyler (or to my knowledge by anybody else).

Mr Tyler,
Since your understating of what Gödel discovered remains superior to us mere
mortals why don't you enlighten us all and provide the missing list of
propositions outside of mathematics which Gödel proved were required to make
mathematics consistent?

2. Tyler's evasive act of denigration.
Tyler mind is mediocre. Mostly it remains closed to the long established
Darwinian tradition of exploring ANY relationship that exists between ANY
subject which can engage evolutionary theory. There are many like him. Their
knee jerk reaction is to protect the ideas that they like against empirical
testing to refutation where the best way to do this is to resort to just an
empty _rationale_, i.e. just a tautology of mathematics. Such people attempt
to employ rhetorical denigration against whosoever is insisting that they
make this test to refutation (such as myself) as just a pathetic attempt to
avoid providing enough _rigor_ to be able to make it.

Because I was and remain a positive Darwinian I strongly advise: feed the
Tyler even after it remains pointless to do so.

Why? If you're interested in pursuing the subject of the incompleteness
theorems of mathematical logic, may I suggest we do so in a more
approriate newsgroup, such as sci.logic. I doubt many people here are
interested in somewhat erudite technicalities of a somewhat marginal
branch of mathematics.

[moderator's note: I have to agree; interesting as all this Godel
stuff is, this thread has long since lost any relevance to evolutionary
biology. Perhaps it should go to email,  or as is suggested here, to
a more relevant newsgroup. - JAH]

As to some of the questions you asked in your earlier post, here are my
answers.

You write in part:

I remain flabbergasted that you can see no connection between the
above and
what Gödel discovered which Fanzen puts in (non reversible English)
to
mean:-

"The mathematician Godel proved that a system of axioms can never be
based on itself: statements from outside the system must be used in
order to
prove its consistency."

Please very carefully explain to all of us here why any rationalist
cannot
just retort: Well, very OBVIOUSLY only because ALL of the axioms of
mathematics were and remain, TAUTOLOGIES. IF this is NOT true then
please
provide just a single axiom which is not a tautology.

First of all, the quote you give is not from Torkel Franzén, but is
one of the numerous examples from news debates Torkel uses to
illustrate certain widespread and natural reactions to the
incompleteness theorems. And in fact, the claim that Gödel proved that
"a system of axioms can never be based on itself" is itself somewhat
obscure, and has no clear content per se; it makes sense only as a
loose expression of the correct claim following after the semicolon,
that a formal system can only be proved consistent - as long as it
meets certain technical criteria - using principles that are not
contained in the system.

As to the question of whether "ALL of the axioms of mathematics were
and remain, TAUTOLOGIES" and its connection to the incompleteness
theorem, I can offer very few comments. This is because you are here
using the term 'tautology' in some way not in accord with the usual
usage in mathematical logic.

You also press me to answer the following question:

"Perhaps you might to like explain why "&lt;=&gt;" does not mean "entirely
reversible" proving just a tautologous logical linkage?"

The reason the symbol "&lt;=&gt;" in Torkel's explanation does not mean
"entirely reversible" and "proving just a tautologous logical linkage"
is simply that "&lt;=&gt;" there is a standard logical symbol, used to denote
material implication in logical formulas. What the diagonal lemma
establishes is that, for every arithmetical formula B(x), we can
construct a formula A such that B(#A) &lt;=&gt; A is provable in the relevant
theory, where #A is the Gödel number of A. This equivalence is not
"tautologous" in any standard sense, in that it is not a logical truth,
in the ordinary technical sense of the word, that A is equivalent to
B(#A), but rather a mathematically established equivalence. Whatever
tautologies are taken to be - the exact definition differs in all sorts
of innessential ways from author to author - it is common to all
accounts that they are in any case logical truths.

You further write:

Please note: Franzen has acknowledged above that what Gödel
discovered does
have valid applications outside of mathematics (which has to be true
to
remain consistent to what he discovered).

Please list these valid applications for sbe reader's to view.

Gödel's theorems have all sorts of applications outside of mathematics
proper, mostly if not exclusively in the philosophy of mathematics.
Historically the most important of these is that a foundational
programme known as Hilbert's programme can't be carried out. This, of
course, is mainly of historical interest. Perhaps the most important
application of Gödel's theorems has to do with the formal
characterizability of the totality of mathematical statements that are
(potentially) recognizable as correct by us. For it follows from the
incompleteness theorem that for any formal theory T we recognize as
correct, there is at least one arithmetical truth that is (potentially)
acceptable to us, but not contained in T. This apparent
"inexhaustibility" of mathematics  demonstrates, for example, that all
of the implications we could potentially recognize as correct of
informal, and informally correct, principles such as

Whatever property P is, if 0 has P, and n+1 has P whenever n
has P, then all naturals have P

are not captured in any formal theory (potentially) recognizable by us
as correct. (Of course, it is not at all ruled out that all statements
(potentially) acceptable by us on basis of some informal principles
are, in fact, captured in some formal theory we happen *not* to
recognize as correct).

In the philosophy of mathematics proof theoretical research on this
phenomenon led to a formal characterization, by Solomon Feferman and
Kurt Schütte, of a foundational stance known as predicativism,
proponents of which have included Poincare and Weyl.

In closing, unless you wish to take this to sci.logic, I offer the
following reflections by the proof theorist Girard. Girard, on p. 75 of
his _Proof Theory and Logical Complexity_ - one of
my all time favourite books on proof theory - writes:

Gödel's theorems are very popular; this popularity comes from the
fact
that, undoubtedly, the theorems have deep philosophical meaning. The
natural temptation is to extrapolate, exactly to abstract the
theorems
from their mathematical context, in order to get less precise, but
more general statements. The usual experience of the proof-theorists
is that, in a first step one usually gets so struck that one tries
to reformulate one's personal view of the world to fit the contents
of the theorems. Later on, with a reasonable experience of these
results, this kind of "dramatic" consequences appear as ridiculous
extrapolations. The situation is quite different with outsiders
(philosophers, poets, musicians, journalists ...) who have usually
no opportunity to correct their first impressions concerning the
theorems through mathematical practice.

- - -

In fact, what happens with Gödel's theorems is that some people use
it as a scientific alibi for their fantasies; for instance, there is
the idea of /transgression/ (of the limits of a theory) in Gödel's
theorems; but the idea of transgression are most fashionable among
painters and musicians of the XX^th century, and these people can
refer to Gödel's theorems. But at the turn of the century, they
would
have referred to Malleré for instance, who expressed the ideas of
transgression, in very beautiful and cryptic poems; the difference
between Mallermé and Gödel, is that Mallermé's poems are perfectly
adapted to this situation, whereas it is dishonest to use Gödel's
result in a completely metaphorical (and usually incorrect) sense.

I'm not "feeding" JE, but I'd not be too fast here either. Mathematical
formalism is supposed to be the language of sciences (biology included).
Formalization of biology (such as ALIFE, and AI), therefore, would have
to be viewed under the very same light of Godel's Incompleteness, just as
any other mathematical theories. But unlike certain theories where a model
is the set of natural numbers, biology formalization might be syntactically
possible, without us knowing an infinite (biological) model. And this
formalization-without-model would indeed reveal the weakness of reasoning
in general, and Incompleteness in particular.

So the relationship between the two (biology processes and Gödel's theorems)
might not be in that much "don't have anything to do [with each other]", as
we initially suspect. But I suspect that it would be a long while before
an MD (Medical Doctor) would know what Incompleteness means, and a math Phd.
would care what RNA stands for, and we'd have a well-rounded curriculum,
where a branch of mathematics would be biology-formalism. So yes, it's best
not to talk too much about both in this forum.

JE:-
I would put the above in a different way: Russell's paradox (what is the set
of sets) was NOT _solved_ by Gödel. All that was proven was Russell's
paradox remains irrational. This is where this matter has been left to rot.
To solve it the missing propositions which are NOT of mathematics proven by
Gödel to be absolutely required to make mathematics consistent have to be:

*Listed only using NON mathematical propositions*

Anything else contradicts ENTIRELY what Gödel discovered. I request that
these missing propositions become so listed. So far nobody has offered to
list them (probably because they do not know what they are!)

Any rationalist will tell you that Russell's paradox, which represents an
infinite regress, remains symptomatic of an empty tautology. The "set of
sets" MUST include itself otherwise it falls into Epimenides Paradox (it
just _entirely_ contradicts itself). Russell and Whitehead attempted to make
the set of sets NOT include itself only allowing their infinite regress
"solution". Tautologies remain irrational only because they have no frame of
reference. It seems nobody has learnt this simple lesson from Galileo. We
are not just banding about esoteric ideas here. Everything, including
mathematics remains EMPIRICALLY based. Anybody and their cat can observe
themselves as an empty tautology by simply arranging two carefully aligned
parallel mirrors and standing between them. The mathematics continues to
work here but not the rationale. THAT remains based entirely on the frame of
reference which allows anybody to see that two mirrors are facing each
other. If you take away any constant frame of reference hen all you can see
now may drive you insane.

JE:-
They have _everything_ to do with each other. The universal set which
sparked Russell's Paradox (which Gödel proved remained irrational) is NOT a
proposition of mathematics it was and remains, ENTIRELY an inductive
proposition of physics (just a good guess). IOW mathematics remains
predicated by NON MATHEMATICS (this is what Gödel discovered put in rational
form). Reworked as simply as possible: mathematics always was and will
always remain, entirely deductive from non mathematics.

JE:-
I entirely agree but my criticism of what you wrote is that a formal proof
is ALWAYS required. Gödel provide the PROOF that:

1) Mathematics is not and never can be, empirically based.

2) Mathematics can only become empirically based as a deducible nested set
within empirically based propositions of _non mathematics_. The set of
propositions which are not of mathematics has become defined within
mathematics as the universal set. Gödel proved that this universal set can
never be a proposition of mathematics. That is all. The universal set
defined but _never used_ within remains _entirely_ a proposition of physics.
The use of mathematics is the same as its source: it is only ever rational
when PREDICATED by non mathematics.

ANY NON predicated tautology has the generalized looped logical form:

A &lt;--&gt; B

When it becomes predicated is has the following generalized logical form:

A &lt;--&gt; B ---&gt; C

Here C provides a critical frame of reference which also constitutes Gödel's
missing propositions which are not of mathematics. Note: the single headed
arrow indicates the direction of logical irreversibility while the double
headed arrow indicates any reversible loop of logic (any tautology).

I ask again:
What exactly are the propositions of non mathematics which Gödel proved are
absolutely required to allow mathematics to become consistent (non self
contradictory)?  Please note: expressing these in mathematical form ENTIRELY
refutes what Gödel discovered!

The only absolute proof of consistency for a mathematical system is a
finite model which satisfies the system. Beside that there are only
relative consistency proofs in which the assumed consisten system A is
used to prove system B is consistent. We know group theory is consistent
because there exist finite groups which satisfy the axioms of group
theory. For arithmetic we have no such blessing, nor for the theory of
real or complex variables.

Goedel also showed that if formal arithmetic is consistent then it
cannot be used to prove its own consistency.

By the way I don't understand your utterences about generalized logical
form (whatever that is). It does not follow any standard mathematical
definition I am familiar with. Try using standard definitions and
nomenclature  and not your own idiosyncratic nomenclature.

Don't go there. The balance will shift, and you'll be forced to migrate.
