How does one typeset a repeat with alternatives, when an alternative has a
slur or phrase mark that connects to the music outside it, but in a way
that the arc must be broken? Does one draw the arc hanging, as to to hint
it should be connected to music elsewhere, as in the case of ties?

Yes.

We know that the music from the first ending does not go to the second
ending, but back to the beginning/forward repeat.

But Hans, I wonder what you're doing?

If there are differences between the way measure X (the last one before an
&quot;ending&quot;) will lead to the first ending as opposed to the second ending,
then measure X needs to be included in the ending - i.e, if measure X is
slurred into the 1st ending, but tied into the second, you have to include
measure X-with-slur in the 1st ending, and measure X-with-tie in the 2nd
ending.

Don't know if that's what you're asking, but I hope it helps.

Thank you. Yes I know that if it is possible to connect it typographically
to the other music, one does that.

It is the same stuff as before:

A study of this music and playing style. Since the phrasing may be
difficult to understand if one is not well acquainted with the type of
music, I decided to put in phrase marks, and it looks good, I think. But
if you look at some repeat alternatives, the phrase marks are not drawn.

Or would it be slurs, here? They are not indicative of legato, but music
snippets that should be resolved. So I think they are phrases.

One can try to rewrite it, but repeat alternatives broken up over a
measure is harder to read. And it may not be possible in a score with
several music lines. So I am interested in the question from that general
point of view, too.

So let's look at m. 14:

The slur from the last A in m. 11 goes over 12, and into the F# tied note in
the first ending (m. 13) correctly.

m. 14 should have a slur that originates &quot;in air&quot; that leads to the second
of the tied F#s assuming this should be played similarly to the 1st ending.
You're fortunate here in that the other slurs at the end of m.13 are under,
so having this one over would be completely clear.

But...

m. 14 going into 15 is slurred from the E to the trilled B in m. 16.

If the last 4 16ths in m. 13 are to go back to m.6 and be included in that
slur similarly (to both the beginning and the continuation after the second
ending) then that slur (m. 13) should &quot;lead to air&quot;.

However Hans, I've got to say you're really making this hard on yourself.
Why not write everything out? In this day and age with copy and paste it's
so easy to do. That whole 4 different endings around m.18 is a mess. And if
you've got slurs going into and out of those measures it's going to get
lost. Just write out the passages in total. It's common enough - some
composers (editors) write out repeated sections simply because they want to.
There's no harm in not using repeat bars. If the music were very simple -
like at the beginning where there are 3 same endings and 1 that goes on,
that's OK - guitar tablature with notation does this for pop music (which is
very repetitive so the temptation to use repeat bars is incredible) but when
they have a bunch of different endings, they'll add in &quot;floating&quot; measures
at the end of the score and &quot;link&quot; to them (&quot;see p. 22 for alternate
endings&quot;, etc.). So unless you're dying for space, I'd spill it out onto
multiple pages and just write out the repeats.

By the way Hans -  repeat bars are not &quot;measure lines&quot; - they sometimes
coincide with measure lines but they don't have to. In music with pickup
notes, the repeat bar may be mid-measure, especially when the phrases
feature pickups in their phrases. This is quite common. This music features
either a 16th note pickup or group of 4 16th pickups to phrases.

Here's what you should have for example:
m. 29 should have a backward-facing mid-measure repeat after the F# that
repeats back to a forward-facing mid-measure repeat in m. 21.

You actually &quot;split&quot; m. 21 across the system in an attempt to do this, but
really that's a no-no (some modern avant garde music does this, but
traditionally you don't split a measure across a system except for extreme
reasons, though if you put a mid-measure repeat in, you can (uncommon)). A
mid-measure repeat would also fix your mid-measure key signature change.

Since this is a transcription, and the performer didn't play it the same way
each time, it's going to be as hard to do mid-measure repeats (the spot
above is the only one that works besides between 14 and 18) as it is do do
full measure repeats.

On solution is to break up the 7/16 into 3+4 or 4+3 or some other grouping
that allows for a &quot;full measure&quot; to have repeat bars. The other is simply to
write the majority of the repeats out.

Another note, you should really beam to the phrases - if there's a 4 note
pickup like in m. 13, then the C# should be beamed with the remaining 3 16th
notes (unless it really is a 3 note pickup, in which case your phrase mark
should show that). The performance may be obviously 4+3 but it really seems
like 3+4 in places.

Steve

Yes, that is another problem: the typesetting machine may put the arcs
below or above at will, so one might have to fix it by hand. It would be
great to have the typesetting program fixing such.

Well, the idea is to have more than one version, one of which should not
write out the ornaments. I might go in the other direction, and write one
more detailed. This version tries to extract a single version from the
performance. I will work more with it, and I do not know exactly where it
will lead.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; By the way Hans -  repeat bars are not &quot;measure lines&quot; - they sometimes

Sure, I use that when writing by hand. But the first version did not use
these phrase marks. And I think it is easier to read when the alternatives
do not introduce into the measure.

And for the phrase mark and slur question, it may not help, if there are
parallel melodies.

become different in the different repeats.

One can break it, anywhere, I think from the typesetting point of view,
though the meter is always 4+3=2+2+3. One can see that from the beaming:
even though 4 1/16th notes of some measure belong to the same phrase, they
are beamed as 1 + 3. One could do this differently, but I think this is
OK, because it is formally correct with respect to brining out the metric
accents in the beaming.

The performance is always in 2+2+3. There is in fact a problem with
LilyPond, where it is difficult to change this beaming. For example, in
3/8 time, it is hard to get the traditional beaming for both (2+1+1+2)/16
and (3+1+1+1)/16. If one beams the two in the middle together in the first
case, one does not get the three last in the second case beamed together.

LilyPond is in fact correct, if the metric structure should be brought out
in the beaming. We are discussing it now, for a fix. So if you have any
inputs, I am interested:

Why would one beam together the 1s in (3+1+1+1)/16 in meter 3/8 when it
breaks with the metric accents? You can see the situation here:
http://math.su.se/~haberg/BeamBugMatsBengtsson2.pdf
If metric accents should be brought out in beaming, the first row is
formally correct. But in measure 3, the variation in the row below
(measure 7) is preferred. What is the acting principle here?

Thank you for the input, Steve.

Usually you would have a dotted-8th-16th group followed by a 4-16th note
group.

You could make a dotted 8th flagged followed by a 16th note flagged, then
the group of 4 which is clearer. But you don't typically beam the last 16th
of beat 1 to the group of 4 making a group of 5 (so it looks like 3+5). Your
phrase mark would start over the last 16th of beat 1 though.

If it were the beginning of the music, usually you'd see a single flagged
16th followed by the group of 4 with a phrase mark over the whole batch (and
further).

An engraver _might_ beam all 5 together but, that's really not traditional
practice - in modern music where a 3+5 grouping was trying to be shown, or
if the 5 notes were part of an arpeggio or figure that was musically
important, they might also be grouped as 5, but it would typically be a
pretty darn good reason for breaking the (3+) 1+4 grouping.

oooh...

[ 3 + 1 ] + [ 4 ]

[ 3 + 1] beamed or flagged (flagged clearer)

or as a pickup:

[ (3 +) 1 ] + [ 4 ] with 1 flagged - RARELY beamed.

I think of the variation where the 5 1/16th notes are typeset so that the
4 last are double beamed together, and the first 1/16th note has a small
broken beam in the direction of the others. This would then show both the
logical grouping and the metric accentuation.

Would that do?

I am also think there is a difference between modern music/typesetting and
traditional. The modern stuff is more requiring. People will be required
to play less familiar styles. Therefore it must be more exact and detailed
in its typesetting.

I didn't understand before that you were showing DURATIONS with your
numbers rather than groupings.

So 3+1+1+1+1 means dotted 8th followed by four written 16th notes. If it is
GROUPED 4+3 (2+2+3) it should be dotted 8th beamed to 16th, followed by a
group of 3 16ths; if it is grouped 3+4 (3+2+2) it should be dotted 8th with
flag followed by a group of 4 16ths. In either case the group of 4 may be
broken up into 2 pairs of 16ths.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

">

3/8 with DURATIONS 3+1+1+1 would be done like: dotted 8th beamed to 16th,
then a pair of 16ths. Or, the dotted 8th 16th pair could be flagged.

if you beam that entire group together you're really showing a &quot;shortcut&quot;
notation for 6/16. 6/16 should be dotted 8th on beat 1, and remaining 3 16th
notes on beat 2. The beam is usually broken between the two beats.

3/16 is one of two things: It is triple meter with 3 16th note beats which
durations of 1+1+1 should be notated with flags. Or, it is &quot;uniple&quot; meter
('in One&quot;) with one beat per measure of which each 16th is 1/3 and durations
of 1+1+1 should be notated with a double beam across the group.

You mean beaming all 5 with a single beam, beaming the last 4 with a second
beam, and have a broken beam pointing towards the group of 4 be broken? It
would be a mess :-). It's an unusual grouping which will cause more people
to have to take a second look likely.

I emailed you a file with some solutions on it, did you get it?

That's certainly true to a degree. But for the most part, if the music
doesn't stray too far from the norm, traditional &quot;rules&quot; will work fine. In
the end, it's better that it be &quot;typical&quot; rather than &quot;atypical&quot; if you want
people to try and play it!

Thank you for the typesetting, which shows that it is not necessary to
bring out the metric accents in the beaming.

The example discussed was though, in meter 3/8, the dotted 1/8 followed by
3 1/16th notes. This is commonly beamed together, so that the three 1/6th
notes are connected with an unbroken double beam, like in m.7 (second line
m.3) of
http://math.su.se/~haberg/BeamBugMatsBengtsson2.pdf

This then breaks with the metric accents. If the metric accents are

Right, but what is the acting principle in case you want to automate it in
a computer typesetting program (or write out a rule in a typesetting

What is the beaming if you input the time reversed pattern, three 1/16ths
followed by a dotted 1/8?

Right, this is how one often normally typesets it. But what is the acting
principle?

This is in fact a good sample score. One idea I have is that there are
different styles, one in which metric accents are not beamed out. Then the
time reversed pattern (three 1/16 notes followed by a dotted 1/8), in this
style, should be typeset mirrored. That its, all notes are beamed
together, with no break in the 1/6th note group. Can you find a sample
score with that pattern in the same style?

That's not an exception, it's wrong. 3+1+1+1 is the opposite of 1+1+1+3. If
it's 3/8, you already see it should be beamed as (1+1)+(1+3). It's no
different if it's 3+1+1+1 - it should be (3+1)+(1+1).

Now that's 3/8. I'm not sure what you mean by &quot;as 3/16&quot;. 3/16 beamed as
1+1+1 makes it COMPOUND meter - 3/6 in One as opposed to simple meter. IF
you want to show 3/16 as triple simple meter, you should flag the 16ths. If
you want to show it as uniple compound meter, you beam the 3 16ths and write
&quot;in One&quot; to avoid confusion.

Oh, OK. Yes, let's say you have 3/8 and you have 6/16ths in the measure -
you could do three pairs of double-beamed 16ths, or you could connect them
all with a single beam and double-beam only the pairs.

You shouldn't double-beam the entire group though.

If it were just 3 8th notes, you should &quot;break the beam of the value&quot; -
meaning in this case you'd have flags.

Connecting the entire 6 16ths with double, or 3 8ths with single is bad
practice because - even though it's a somewhat familiar shortcut, it doesn't
show the difference between simple and compound meter, which, in the case of
3/X is important because it goes both ways.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; No, this is the exception. The three 1/16ths seem always beamed together.
">

You mean in 3/16 meter right?

Again, it's either 3/16 &quot;in One&quot;, or, the engraver used a shortcut (and one
must admit that beaming is cleaner on the page than flags). So the engraver
might have used an &quot;exception&quot;, but they did so for exceptional reasons
(ignorance, actual reason, etc.). If you want 3/16 to obviously be triple,
the 16ths should be flagged.

And this is one of the exact reasons meters with smaller denominators have
fallen out of use - too messy!

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; No. This is done also for 3/8. This is the strange thing. It was so in the
&gt; Finale example you sent me, too.
">

Again, they're not correct. That doesn't mean you won't see them. There are
plenty of variations amongst engravers - remember - these guys had to etch
everything into plates in reverse - anything they could do to save time they
would do - this is why you see pieces with triplet backgrounds without any
triplit indications many times - it's not &quot;correct&quot; to leave them of, but it
was a whole hell of a lot quicker for them to leave them off!

The basic gist is Hans, 3/8 and 3/16 may be treated as triple meter or
&quot;uniple&quot; meter. Beaming the entire measure fails to show the distinction.
This is not a problem with 3/4 versus 6/8 because they are usually treated
as triple and duple respectively.

But when you treat 3/8 as uniple compound meter, basically you're treating
it as the first half of 6/8 meter and it should follow the beaming
conventions for the first half of 6/8. If you treat 3/8 as triple simple
meter, it should be beamed like 3/4.

I don't disagree, but you always need to remember that you're dealing with a
steadfast tradition and anything you do &quot;out of the ordinary&quot; runs a risk of
being misinterpreted. If there's already an established way to do it, then
you should do that unless - like those engraves in the past - you have a
good reason not to - and &quot;just because you can do it now on a computer&quot;
isn't really a good reason IMHO.

You're reading from the wrong book :-)

Take a look here at the Presto in G minor

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

You've misinterpreted. It is 3/8. It is either 3 beats divided into 2 16ths,
or 1 beat, divided into 3 8ths, subdivided into 2 16ths per 8th. This is the
difference in 3/8 being treated as triple simple meter (the former) or
&quot;uniple&quot; compound meter (the latter). The indication &quot;in One&quot; is not common
until later but that indication indicates 3/X meters should be uniple
compound.

This is Presto - fast. Usually, fast is taken in one because it's too hard
to count 1-2-3-1-2-3-1-2-3 - instead, 1--1--1-- is counted. In other words,
the only &quot;beat&quot; felt is on the downbeat (and only beat) of each measure.
This is beamed correctly for that.

That doesn't mean you have to hear it that way, or perform it that way.

And, if it is &quot;in three&quot;, then, this beaming is &quot;incorrect&quot; however, it is a
commonly accepted shortcut to make it less work for the engraver who had to
do this by hand to connect all the beams. I've seen 8 8th notes connected in
4/4. That doesn't make it right!

Danny, without looking at the beginning of the Siciliano, scroll up from the
Presto and look at the last line of the Siciliano. What do you see? Is 12/8
all that apparent? Those groups of 4 16th notes are troublesome - largely
because we're so used to seeing them in other meters. They should be beamed
to the 8th note that goes with them. Now it may have been impractical to do
so because of the distance to that note - or the engraver/publisher could
have felt there was an important reason for separating them. Nonetheless, it
would be clearer to beam them properly if possible.

Best,
Steve

Be cautious gentlemen. Look at the key signature. Are we going to say that
because these examples have the F# &quot;in the wrong place&quot; that we are going to
engrave that way too?

The acting principle Hans is whether the meter is simple or compound. In the
case of 3/4 it is usually treated as triple. 3/8 is traditionally treated
not as triple meter, but as compound meter, meaning the beaming will behave
as it it's the first half of a 6/8 meter. This again, in 3/8 at Allegro, is
likely to be taken &quot;in One&quot;, which makes it compound.

Again, this is the problem with 3/8 and 3/16 especially. If one wishes to
slow 3/8 down and treat it as a triple simple meter, one *should* beam it as
they would 3/4 (one beam down so to speak). That doesn't mean people will,
nor does it mean any historical examples of 3/8 or 3/16 will be triple.

You could treat 5/8 and 5/4 the same way. 5/4 is usually taken as Quintuple
meter, and  5/8 is typically taken as an Asymmetrical Duple meter, of which
one half is simple and the other is compound. But there's no reason a fast
5/4 couldn't be treated that way, and there's no reason that a slow 5/8
couldn't be counted &quot;in 5&quot;.

That is two methods to bring out the metric accentuation. Then one

away of that, these are the only ways to do it.

In say 7 = 3+4, it can have a very clear subaccent structure (2+1)+(2+2)

So it seems. In CPP, one knows the metric accents, so it does not matter.

&gt; slow 3/8 down and treat it as a triple simple meter, one *should* beam it as
&gt; they would 3/4 (one beam down so to speak). That doesn't mean people will,
&gt; nor does it mean any historical examples of 3/8 or 3/16 will be triple.

I think this is done for the two reason: In CPP, the metric accents are
known, and it simplifies drawing by hand.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; You could treat 5/8 and 5/4 the same way. 5/4 is usually taken as Quintuple
&gt; meter, and  5/8 is typically taken as an Asymmetrical Duple meter, of which
&gt; one half is simple and the other is compound. But there's no reason a fast
&gt; 5/4 couldn't be treated that way, and there's no reason that a slow 5/8
&gt; couldn't be counted &quot;in 5&quot;.
">

For these complex meters, I usually choose the denominator so that the 1/4
becomes reasonable on the metronome (say (1/4 = 80 - 159). This gives good
beaming: subaccenting at 1/32 note resolution is not worth: it moves too
fast. But on 1/16 note resolution, all kinds of variations can take place.

So 1/4 timing, in meters 5/4, 5/8 and 5/16 become quite distinct in
musical nature, and it is important to indicate how it should be. The 5/4
could be like 4/4 with an extra 1/4, but one can have subaccents on level
between the primary and the other beats as well. The Lord of the Rings has
an interesting variation: the two races of Orcs march to music in 5 time,
but with different subaccenting, 2+3 and 3+2.

Maybe reasonable, but that's not how it's done.

If you have 7/8, and you want 2+1+2+2

you can beam 2 8ths,  1 8th(flag) 2 8ths and 2 8ths.

But, you typically don't do, if it was 7/16:

3 notes with a single beam, with the first two with a second beam and the
last 1 with a broken &quot;half&quot; beam and the rest as 4 single beam and two pair
double-beamed groups. You will see groups of 4 or other even-numbered groups
with secondary beams broken to make the double-beamed groups pairs of 2 or
sets of 3.

Well, it does. People have started (a long time ago) beaming across barlines
to show musical groupings. But musical groupings don't necessarily coincide
with metric accents.

But here it's a little more difficult because it's so similar to an existing
set of standards. It would be like writing 5/4 and grouping it 3+3+2+2 and
calling it an asymmetrical quadruple meter. It could be, but putting 4/4 in
the meter signature would certainly be dangerous, and 5/4 doesn't help too
much. If you want it to be performed and felt as if it is in fact (wow, 5 2
letter words in a row!) 4 unequal beats, then the best solution is to write
3+3+2+2 over 4 meter, and beam/group the music accordingly.

Ahh, Ok, now I see what you mean. Right - it's assumed.

But I think you're asking suppose it's non-CPP - how does the program know.
Good question - I would think you'd have to consider that a large amount of
users are going to be transcribing traditional music or composing in a
traditional style, so you'd probably default to 3/8 &quot;in One&quot; and have a
setting for it as triple.

But Finale has done this for years. I can go in and select 6/4 as sextuple
meter, or as duple compound meter.

The example I sent you I said this was Finale's Default - the Default is 3/8
in one - so e ssss is beamed together. If I set it to 3/8 triple meter, it
prints e flag, s s beam, s s beam.

If I put in the  3+1+1+1 figure in the 3/8 set as triple, it beams it just
like I said - dotted 8th to 16th beam, pair of 16ths beamed.

Finale has been able to do this as long as I can remember. So to &quot;tell&quot; the
typesetting program what to do, you simply pick one version or the other in
Finale.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Eaxactly - that's really my point - while there are a lot of shortcut
traditions, there's no reason to use them necessarily. I don't typically
beam 4 8th notes together in 4.4 on the first and second half of the
measure - I do 4 groups of 2 rather than 2 groups of 4 (though I must admit,
since Finale's default is to make two groups of 4, I usually don't go in and
change it unless I'm really feel the need to :-).

&gt; &gt; The idea I have in my mind, is that one should be able to do both. Music
&gt; &gt; that can typeset according to CPP traditions may be done that way, as it
&gt; &gt; will look familiar.

&gt; &gt; But the bringing out the metric accents in the beaming would be better for
&gt; &gt; modern music. To this, beaming should reflect the logical structure.
&gt;
&gt; Well, it does. People have started (a long time ago) beaming across barlines
&gt; to show musical groupings.

Good point. I must look at that.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; But musical groupings don't necessarily coincide

No. Sometimes it is used for this, sometimes that. Sometimes metric
accents are not brought out at all. If it is unclear, one might write a
better meter signature.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; But here it's a little more difficult because it's so similar to an existing
&gt; set of standards. It would be like writing 5/4 and grouping it 3+3+2+2 and

Actually, I just found example of 3+3+2+2: &quot;Two for five&quot; by Clark - Menlo
Brass Quintet.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; It could be, but putting 4/4 in
&gt; the meter signature would certainly be dangerous, and 5/4 doesn't help too
&gt; much. If you want it to be performed and felt as if it is in fact (wow, 5 2
&gt; letter words in a row!) 4 unequal beats, then the best solution is to write
&gt; 3+3+2+2 over 4 meter, and beam/group the music accordingly.
">

The metric decomposition tells how the metric accents and subaccents
should be structured. Over that, the musical line might have its own local
accents. In fact, that latter often overrides the former in music
performances. So one can write it out with syncopes, instead of putting it
into the metric. It depends on what is the logical structure one wants to
bring communicate to the reader of the score.

So if you think it is easier to read, the 3+3+2+2 could be written as 4/4
time with quintuplets. I distinguish though between 3+3+4 and, because in
Balkan music, for example 9=2+2+3 and 4+2+3 are different. One could go
further with subaccenting, and write it as (2+2)+(2+3). But perhaps this
is Westernization, because playing styles may not emphasize metric accents
much.

&gt;

I am fascinated with the rich variation it gives. This happens also even

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; For

Yeah, one can also write a meter sign 5/4 = 3/4 + 2/4. Some wants to have
that as an indication of meter changes, with barlines or dotted barlines
between the 2s and 3s, sometimes dropping the &quot;+&quot; in the meter signature.

But it just didn't happen that I did that, because the meters I deal with
are well-known, and the beaming tells pretty much what it is. See for
example:
http://math.su.se/~haberg/SediDonka.pdf
This well known tune in 25-time, in a version from a musicological book.
The metric structure as 25=7+7+11, where 7=3+2+2 and 11=2+2+3+2+2=4+3+4 I
think is clear from the beaming. So I decided to not write out
a more detailed meter sign.

I probably missed you point here. But the question arises in the case of
metric time bends. The tune &quot;Eleno Mome&quot; might be written in 7/8, where 7
= 2+2+1+2. But due ti time bends, there exists also version in 13 =
4+4+2+3, and 3+4+2+3. These then have say two equal length notes on
the last beat shorthand to 2+1 time lengths in the 13 meter. Actually, on
a recording at Smithsonian. it seems the performance is about 4+4+2+3.5,
which would be a typically sized time bend.

But it more complicated, because the Petrunino horo exist written as 12 =
3+4+2+3, with that many 1/16 notes on each. So it has then been
formalized. So this is a formalized reinterpretation of the time bend.
Petrunino is otherwise often played in a 7/8 , 7 = 2+2+1+2 without
large significant time bends. So there is a flux of the matter: different
interpretations of the same metric rhythm.

Therefore, I think of some notation that can notate such a metric like 7=
2+2+1+2, and indicate a typical time bend. I think the tim bend should be
less than 1/2 of a beat, or else one can rewrite it. This would put Eleno
Mome with a meter 7/8.

But the situation is quite complicated, because there
are several different ways to do the time bend: It can be chopped or
extended at the end, it can stretched or shortened, or the beat can be
moved say earlier in time (like perhaps the Viennese Waltz).

I am curious about this Finale typesetting, because it is not consistent,
it seems.

I will use the following notation: numbers are 1/16 notes (1 = 1/16, 2 =
1/8, 3 = dotted 1/8), &quot;|&quot; are bars, and brackets &quot;[&quot;,  &quot;]&quot; to denote
beaming. So |3 1 1 1| is a dotted 1/8 followed by three 1/16. Then the
first example (in meter 3/8) you sent me (&quot;in One&quot;) is:
| [2 2 [1 1]] | [2 [1 1] 2] | [3 [1 1 1]] | [2 [1] 2 [1]] |
And your second example is:
| [2] [2] [1 1] | [2] [1 1] [2] | [3 1] [1 1] | [2] [[1] 2 [1]] |
The funny thing here is that the second row does not fully bring out the
metric accents, as in m. 3 (resp. m.4) there is a beam across beat 2
(resp. 3).

Compare with the 6/16 example you gave (where ~ denotes tie):
| [2 1] ~ [1 1 1]] | [2 1] [1 2] | [3] [1 1 1] | [2 1] [2 1] |
Here, the second 1/8 note is broken up and tied over the beat.

So if the metric accent should be strictly brought out, then in 3/8, it
should be typeset as:
| [2] [2] [1 1] | [2] [1 1] [2] | [2]~[1 1] [1 1] | [2] [1 1]~[1 1]] |

So what do you think the reason is here? In 6/16, one breaks up the notes
across the beats and tie them, but in 3/8 one does not.

Ok. What I'm trying to point out is yes, it is treated that way because

That's why the system is so elegant. It's flaw is in not being able to

The metric accents are different. The 2/4 (resp. 6/8) has one primary
accent on beat 1 and a subordinate on beat 2 (resp. 4). 6/8 has no metric
accents one beats 2, 3, 5, 6. In fact, in CPP, 6/8 is a rewrite of 2/4
with triplets.

By contrast, 3/8 is like 3/4 with subordinate accents on beats 2, 3.

I am thinking about it. Basically the idea is to have say a filled number
to be the normal division with subaccents, and an outline number to be the
&quot;in One&quot; style without it, like U+1D7D8-1D7E1 in:
http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U1D400.pdf
Then one can use sums as in 11/16=((2+2)+(2+1)+(2+2))/16.

Write &quot;in One&quot; with an accent, as in 3'. Then one has 6/8 = (3'+3')/8,
which is different from 3/4. And so on.

Yes, this is what I also think: it is as a rewritten 3/4. Steve suggested
it should only have one beat, if I understood him right.

But it seems that CPP music only has three metric beat structures: 2, 3,
and 4. Primary metric accent on beat 1, and subordinate beats on the
subsequent beats.

The other meters arises by rewriting triplet and sextuplets on the beats.
But that does not introduce new metric accents, I think. The second note
would then be shortened as to approach a 1/32 note, but will be unclear
exactly how much, as one sort of terminates the note in a (short and fast)
diminuendo.

You can check out the durations in a program like Transcribe!
&lt; http://www.seventhstring.com/ &gt;, if you have the track. You can then slow
down the track, without changing the pitch. This is also possible in
QuickTime &lt; http://www.apple.com/quicktime/ &gt;.

groups of three.

I this case I think it happens, because it is the full measure. Then one
can always do it. There also seems to be variation with notes that are
duration going over a metric accent: sometimes they are broken up,
sometimes they are not.

&gt;&gt; The example I sent you I said this was Finale's Default - the Default is

&gt;&gt; like I said - dotted 8th to 16th beam, pair of 16ths beamed.

&gt; I am curious about this Finale typesetting, because it is not consistent,
&gt; it seems.

&gt; I will use the following notation: numbers are 1/16 notes (1 = 1/16, 2 =
&gt; 1/8, 3 = dotted 1/8), &quot;|&quot; are bars, and brackets &quot;[&quot;, &quot;]&quot; to denote
&gt; beaming. So |3 1 1 1| is a dotted 1/8 followed by three 1/16. Then the
&gt; first example (in meter 3/8) you sent me (&quot;in One&quot;) is:
&gt; | [2 2 [1 1]] | [2 [1 1] 2] | [3 [1 1 1]] | [2 [1] 2 [1]] |
&gt; And your second example is:
&gt; | [2] [2] [1 1] | [2] [1 1] [2] | [3 1] [1 1] | [2] [[1] 2 [1]] |
&gt; The funny thing here is that the second row does not fully bring out the
&gt; metric accents, as in m. 3 (resp. m.4) there is a beam across beat 2
&gt; (resp. 3).
">

True, but remember, I said they could be flagged instead. The reason it's
allowed is because you're beaming from the strong part of beat one across
beat two and into the weak part of beat two. Actually, the clearest thing
there would be to tie the 8th to the 16th rather than using the dotted note
at all!

Of course I was trying to stick closer to the example you gave to make the
distinction.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Compare with the 6/16 example you gave (where ~ denotes tie):
&gt; | [2 1] ~ [1 1 1]] | [2 1] [1 2] | [3] [1 1 1] | [2 1] [2 1] |
&gt; Here, the second 1/8 note is broken up and tied over the beat.

That's right.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; So if the metric accent should be strictly brought out, then in 3/8, it
&gt; should be typeset as:
&gt; | [2] [2] [1 1] | [2] [1 1] [2] | [2]~[1 1] [1 1] | [2] [1 1]~[1 1]] |
">

Yes - there you go - I should have read down further before answering above
:-). Yes, the tie would be ultimately clearest, but, there's no &quot;rule
against&quot; beaming as before - other than just being unusual. Again, if we
were talking about the default in a program, it should be the tie.

Obviously it depends on whether it's in one or in three, and, it depends on

yes, I get the multiple &quot;shifting&quot;. The solo section (when the audience
cheers about 4:00 in) is really cool.

This happens in some of the instruments in MI too. Notationally speaking, we
don't have to bring out syncopations, but engravers often have. The same
&quot;should&quot; be true of asymmetrical meters - if the basic grouping is 3+2, then
2+3 or 1+3+1 could be beamed/tied/grouped to show syncopations, but in my
experience, they're often written &quot;standard&quot;. It's not on like how you can
write duplets in 6/8 to have two evenly-spaced notes across beat 1, but you
could also put in two dotted 16ths to achieve the same timing. To me, an 8th
tied to a 16th, then a 16th tied to an 8th looks like syncopation, two
dotted 16ths looks like &quot;syncopation notation&quot;, and the duplets just look
like duplets. In the end though, the duplets look to me the most close
notationally to what the music actually sounds like!

Obviously, but I have never though of it in one. If it is in one, then
2/8, 3/8, and 4/8 are musically equivalent, because they can be rewritten
with n-tuples.

I looked into Hindemith, &quot;Elementary training&quot;, and he starts speak about
subordinate metric accents only in the context of compound meter, like 6,
9, 12 with three notes on each beat. For simple meters 2, 3, and 4, he
does not mention it (subordinate metric accents on betas higher than 1).
It seems like a mistake, to me.

So I wonder if 3/8 can be &quot;in one&quot;. Clearly, if it is fast enough, perhaps
bette notated as a 3/16, there will not be time enough to bring out the
metric accents.

I am not sure how you arrived at it. One way is to count fast
9+7=(2+2+2+3)+(2+2+3) says using the fingers, and then pass to the

A complicated way to arrive at this beat structure! :-) Then compare it
with 3+3+3

I think so, too. And the 2 measure percussion solo could be sampled for

&gt; Notationally speaking, we
&gt; don't have to bring out syncopations, but engravers often have.
">

A syncopation is musically different, that rewriting it into another meter
so that it disappears, because an orchestral instrument may bering
out bother the syncope and the metric accents in the same note, if it is
long enough. And there may be more than one instrument performing, of
which some bring out the syncope, and others the metric accent. And even
if the metric accenting is not performed at all, the metric structure may
be logically present.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; The same
&gt; &quot;should&quot; be true of asymmetrical meters - if the basic grouping is 3+2, then
&gt; 2+3 or 1+3+1 could be beamed/tied/grouped to show syncopation's, but in my
&gt; experience, they're often written &quot;standard&quot;.
">

I suspect that would be typical &quot;Western engraving&quot; - such meters are not
common, so they get strange treatment. I am not sure what you mean
&quot;standard here&quot; - is that in one?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; It's not on like how you can
&gt; write duplets in 6/8 to have two evenly-spaced notes across beat 1, but you
&gt; could also put in two dotted 16ths to achieve the same timing. To me, an 8th
&gt; tied to a 16th, then a 16th tied to an 8th looks like syncopation, two
&gt; dotted 16ths looks like &quot;syncopation notation&quot;, and the duplets just look
&gt; like duplets. In the end though, the duplets look to me the most close
&gt; notationally to what the music actually sounds like!
">

As for the standard CPP 6/8, I think of it as musically equivalent (speed
adjusted) to a 2/4 with triplets on the two beats.

But I have a score where the Bernstein's &quot;America&quot; song is written in
6/8, with alternating 3+3 and 2+2+2 groupings. If I look in the Wiki, it
seems hat it is traditionally notated as alternating 6/8 and 3/4. This is
the correct way in CPP, which does not know the 2+2+2 grouping.

But in modern music, which should include complex meters, I do not see
any problems with the 2+2+2 grouping. Then that should somehow
be brought out: either in beaming, or writing out (for the &quot;America&quot;
song), the time signature 3+3|2+2+2.

Do you have an example where there are no metric accents at all on betas 2

In the guitar engraver thread, it was said that the guy who wrote the

That is the problem with closed source.

Also note the difference between open and free: UNIX was in the early days
commercial, thus not free, but open. The openness makes it possible for a
lot of talented programmers to experiment with it.

So open source and closed source is like the story about the toroise and hare:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tortoise_and_the_Hare
The rabbit runs fast at times, but take many breaks. It is possible for
humans to hunt gazelle, and other fast running animals, but having food
and water supply for a few days, and them stalk a particular animal until
it gets too tired to run away.

They are originally different designs by different people and companies,
Apple favoring &quot;Times&quot; and Microsoft &quot;Times New&quot;, but eventually, the
latter asked &quot;Times New&quot; to be redesigned so that its spacing is exactly
the same as in Times. So now, they only difference in the direction of the

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; No, but they should be present so they can be used for &quot;backwards

&gt; &gt;&gt; Agreed. In Finale though, you can easily go in a break beams or turn
&gt; &gt;&gt; flags
&gt; &gt;&gt; into beams, so you can do it &quot;wrong&quot; on purpose if you want!

&gt; &gt; I have written to the LilyPond bugs list about it.

Hopefully. :-) It is hard to fix, in the lack of clear programming

&gt; &gt; I am curious about this Finale typesetting, because it is not consistent,
&gt; &gt; it seems.

&gt; &gt; I will use the following notation: numbers are 1/16 notes (1 = 1/16, 2 =
&gt; &gt; 1/8, 3 = dotted 1/8), &quot;|&quot; are bars, and brackets &quot;[&quot;, &quot;]&quot; to denote
&gt; &gt; beaming. So |3 1 1 1| is a dotted 1/8 followed by three 1/16. Then the
&gt; &gt; first example (in meter 3/8) you sent me (&quot;in One&quot;) is:
&gt; &gt; | [2 2 [1 1]] | [2 [1 1] 2] | [3 [1 1 1]] | [2 [1] 2 [1]] |
&gt; &gt; And your second example is:
&gt; &gt; | [2] [2] [1 1] | [2] [1 1] [2] | [3 1] [1 1] | [2] [[1] 2 [1]] |
&gt; &gt; The funny thing here is that the second row does not fully bring out the
&gt; &gt; metric accents, as in m. 3 (resp. m.4) there is a beam across beat 2
&gt; &gt; (resp. 3).

&gt; True, but remember, I said they could be flagged instead. The reason it's
&gt; allowed is because you're beaming from the strong part of beat one across
&gt; beat two and into the weak part of beat two. Actually, the clearest thing
&gt; there would be to tie the 8th to the 16th rather than using the dotted note
&gt; at all!
">

This last one, I think is easiest to tell a computer. Perhaps to could be
called &quot;strong metric accents beaming&quot;. The other form ignores the metric
accents to some extent, but not fully. So it might be called &quot;weak metric
accents beaming&quot;.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Of course I was trying to stick closer to the example you gave to make the
&gt; distinction.
">

I wonder only about how to make a formulation that covers all
cases, formulated so it can be automated in a computer program.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; Compare with the 6/16 example you gave (where ~ denotes tie):
&gt; &gt; | [2 1] ~ [1 1 1]] | [2 1] [1 2] | [3] [1 1 1] | [2 1] [2 1] |
&gt; &gt; Here, the second 1/8 note is broken up and tied over the beat.
&gt;
&gt; That's right.
&gt; &gt; So if the metric accent should be strictly brought out, then in 3/8, it
&gt; &gt; should be typeset as:
&gt; &gt; | [2] [2] [1 1] | [2] [1 1] [2] | [2]~[1 1] [1 1] | [2] [1 1]~[1 1]] |
&gt;
&gt; Yes - there you go - I should have read down further before answering above
&gt; :-). Yes, the tie would be ultimately clearest, but, there's no &quot;rule
&gt; against&quot; beaming as before - other than just being unusual. Again, if we
&gt; were talking about the default in a program, it should be the tie.
">

Again, the form you think is clearest and preferable is the one that is
easiest to tell a computer program, I think.

So your comments help. Thank you, Steve.
