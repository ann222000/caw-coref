The Oxford Shakespeare: Poems. 1914.

Sonnet CXLI.

IN faith, I do not love thee with mine eyes
For they in thee a thousand errors note;
But 'tis my heart that loves what they despise,
Who, in despite of view, is pleas'd to dote.
Nor are mine ears with thy tongue's tune delighted; 5
Nor tender feeling, to base touches prone,
Nor taste, nor smell desire to be invited
To any sensual feast with thee alone:
But my five wits nor my five senses can
Dissuade one foolish heart from serving thee, 10
Who leaves unsway'd the likeness of a man,
Thy proud heart's slave and vassal wretch to be:
Only my plague thus far I count my gain,
That she that makes me sin awards me pain.

1609 Quarto, old-fashioned spelling.

I4I
IN faith I doe not loue thee with mine eyes,
For they in thee a thousand errors note,
But 'tis my heart that loues what they dispise,
Who in dispight of view is pleasd to dote.
Nor are mine eares with thy toungs tune delighted,
Nor tender feeling to base touches prone,
Nor taste, nor smell, desire to be inuited
To any sensuall feast with thee alone:
But my fiue wits,nor my fiue sences can
Diswade one foolish heart from seruing thee,
Who leaues vnswai'd the likenesse of a man,
Thy proud hearts slaue and vassall wretch to be:
Onely my plague thus farre I count my gaine,
That she that makes me sinne,awards me paine.

The only advantage I can attribute to this

is that the woman who causes my sin also awards
the penance which leads to absolution. /

By quatrains:
(1) My heart, not my sight, makes me love you, (2) and not the other
senses either. (3) Sense and intellect count for nothing against the
heart. (c) At least, the sin comes wrapped up with the penance.

The speaker makes a subjective statement about his state of mind. This
is not a speech to the addressee, in public or in private. Only his
own point of view is taken into account and we, as readers, must enter
into that point of view. This is the poet whose plays are full of
soliloquies: I suggest there is an analogy. (Not particularly with
&quot;Now is the winter of our discontent&quot;, which despite the disclaimer at
the end is too much like a prologue to the audience, but with later
soliloquies.)

Line 2: is he saying she is ugly? No, just human. No human can stand
up to careful, detailed analysis. But he moves on to his real point,
which is that love does not work that way. No analysis can produce
love, or even the conclusion that this person 'ought' to be loved.

Lines 5-8. If line 2 meant she was ugly, then these lines would have
to mean she was also cacophonous, nasty to touch, unpleasant tasting
and smelly. Not so, of course: this just completes the list of the
five senses, making the point that love does not depend on them.

Line 6, 'base touches'. This is sexual feeling-up. Katherine
Duncan-Jones refers to Measure for Measure 3.2.23:
DUKE: Fie, sirrah! A bawd, a wicked bawd!
... say to thyself
From their abominable and beastly touches
I drink, I eat, array myself, and live.

Line 9, 'five wits'. At one time this was synonymous with 'five
senses', and perhaps Shakespeare means to confuse us by putting both
in this line. I suppose it was a movement in the meaning of 'wit' that
caused the expression 'five senses' to be created, and then someone to
make a (rather feeble) list of the wits as opposed to the senses:
common sense, imagination, fantasy, true estimation, memory.

Katherine Duncan-Jones argues that Shakespeare consistently
distinguishes the two fives, and gives reasonable examples:
Romeo and Juliet 1.4.47 (which Blakemore Evans uses as an example of
the opposite, I would say wrongly) and 3.4.78 (which I cannot find),
Much Ado 1.1.66, Lear 3.4.58 and 3.6.57 (both 'Bless thy five wits'
from Poor Tom, who has lost his intellects, not his senses.)

Line 10: why 'one'? The speaker has only one heart, of course, but is
that worth saying? Yes, because of the contrast with the two fives in
the previous line. Love laughs at odds of ten to one. (Helen Vendler I
think takes this line.)

Line 11. Senses and intellect together still make only the likeness of
a man. The heart remains and it is the business of this sonnet to show
it. Obtusely perhaps, I do not remember seeing the matter so
completely stripped down in any previous sonnet.

Line 14, 'awards'. This is a judicial word, justifying my 'penance'
and (I hope) my reference to the absolution that would follow penance.
Love, as a painful business, brings its own penance with it, and so
its own hope of absolution. This need not be religious: we could say,
it pays its own debt to society. But the word 'sin' gives it a
religious tinge.
