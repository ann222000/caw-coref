This post works out the acceleration that could be derived from the
&quot;emissionless drive&quot; I described in a previous post.

Essentially, the drive works by having two (or more) large masses separated
by a long distance. If the gravitational field varies over time (as it does
in an elliptical orbit) and the gravitational field is non linear (which it
always is) then the force experienced by each mass will be different at
different times. By reducing the distance when the gravitational gradient is
high (through using a motor to bring the masses together) and increasing it
when it the gravitational gradient is low - at the top of the orbit - the
energy expended by the motor over a complete cycle is manifest as either
higher kinetic energy of the masses or a higher orbit, depending upon the
geometry.

So, how practical is it?

The first thing to note is that as long as the mass of the motor and rod is
insignificant compared to the two large masses, the net acceleration is
independent of the size of the masses, and depends only upon their
separation. To see this is true, you can imagine that two identical
spaceships orbiting side by side would experience the same acceleration as a
single spaceship with the double the mass at each end.

This very convenient, because as the mass falls out of the equation we need
only consider the differences in acceleration due to gravity.

Lets make the distance between the masses vary from zero to 100 kms.

Lets make the lowest point (perigee) of the orbit 7,000 kms from the centre
of the earth (ie 600 kms above the surface). Lets make the most distant
point (apogee) 20,000 kms. Lets make g = 10 m/s^2 at 7000 kms.

Using the inverse square law, the difference in acceleration between the two
masses at 7,000 kms is:

10 m/s^2 * (7,100,000/7,000,000 - 1)^2
= 0.28 m/s^2

At 20,000 kms, the difference in acceleration at the two ends is:

10 m/s^2 * (20,100,000/20,000,000 - 1)^2
= 0.1 m/s^2

This means we have an acceleration differential of 0.28 m/s^2 at perigee but
only 0.1 m/s^2 at apogee. This is manifest as the force the motor must use
to bring the masses together or separate them, its M x 0.28 m/s^2 at perigee
but only M x 0.1 ms/^2 at apogee.

So you pull the masses together at perigee and separate them at apogee. This
give you a net difference of acceleration of 0.28m/s^2 - 0.1m/s^2, or
0.18m/s^2. Because you have two masses which must share this acceleration,
the net acceleration is 0.9 m/s^2.

This a pretty reasonable rate. You could obviously build up to escape
velocity eventually.

There are a few problems. The first is keeping the masses pointing towards
the earth, which may require gyroscopes. Alternatively, there is no reason
why the spaceship needs to have only two masses on one axis; there could be
six masses on three axis. This would mean you wouldn't care if it tumbled,
as at least one axis would always be available. More to the point, having
multiple axis may allow the spacecraft to be steered, and the problem
avoided.

This almost seems to me to be a practical &quot;gravity drive&quot;. Even if not used
to achieve escape velocity, it would seem to suffice for orbital adjustments
(unfortunately not for circular orbits though). A spaceship designed in this
manner could operate forever with no refueling, as long as it had access to
energy (eg solar energy).

Should I patent the &quot;gravity drive&quot; ? Or has somebody already done this!

It is possible with only a single mass and no drive motor.  We
use it frequently to boost the speed of satellites / probes.  But
we do not start from a circular orbit, and depending on which
side of the planetary body we approach on, controls whether we
boost or brake.

If you think you can keep from imparting spin, or that it is even
desirable to do so, yes it is impossible.  As someone pointed
out, the Moon is getting a boost simply because the center of
mass of the tides and the Earth-proper are not co-aligned.

The &quot;inner&quot; weight will be orbitting slightly faster.  Reducing
the weight-to-weight spacing will merely speed up the spin
rotation (conservation of angular momentum).

I posted some maths indicating the size of the effect above. I made some
simplifications which make it an &quot;order of magnitude&quot; calculation only, but
do not affect whether it is theoretically possible.

You correctly point out that the increased energy may be evident in the body
spinning. This is an equally paradoxical result. If you consider two
successive orbits, at the apogee (furthest point) the masses are the same
distance apart, but the spaceship has increased angular momentum. You can
use this effect to spin up a satellite to any speed without ejecting
reaction mass - a seemingly paradoxical result. If you don't want spin, this
can be controlled with gyroscopes.

I believe that where this effect is most practical would be in using it in
reverse, as a method of dropping a sattelite into a lower orbit. This
actually generates usable energy in the process. It would effectively allow
atmospheric breaking for bodies with no atmosphere.

The moon gains angular momentum at the expense of the Earth
losing angular momentum.  This is due to the torque applied to
the Earth by the tides.

Your drive doesn't work because of conservation of angular
momentum.  Your drive doesn't apply any torque on the Earth.
As such, you can only increase or decrease the orbit by the
insignificant amount you can counterbalance with the angular
momentum of the rotating spacecraft.

&gt; The moon gains angular momentum at the expense of the Earth

&gt;&gt; Do you understand how my drive works? If you don't, what is unclear? If
&gt;&gt; you
&gt;&gt; do, can you see any theoretical reason it won't work?

&gt; Your drive doesn't work because of conservation of angular

My drive is not intended to rotate at all. If the spaceship does rotate, its
an unintended consequence.

If you mean that the angular momentum of the spaceship as a whole has
increased because its moving faster, this is not neccesarily true. It would
also depend upon the eccentricity of the orbit. If it does increase, this
doesn't really worry me; its robbing the earth of angular momentum, just as
the moon is.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Your drive doesn't apply any torque on the Earth.
&gt; As such, you can only increase or decrease the orbit by the
&gt; insignificant amount you can counterbalance with the angular
&gt; momentum of the rotating spacecraft.

Its not intended to transfer angular momentum as such.

Let me ask you a question.

If you have two masses separated by a 100kms at apogee, pointing towards the
earth, and when you reach perigee (the bottom of the orbit) you pull them
together, then significant work is done. When the two masses are at apogee
again, you allow them to separate so they are 100 kms apart again apart.
This provides less energy than was used to pull them together at apogee, as
the gravitational gradient is less. Where has the excess energy that you
used to pull the masses together gone?

Why do you think my drive won't work? It doesn't seem to contravene the laws
of conservation of momentum, angular momentum and energy. Where is the flaw
in my (theoretical) design?

: &gt;&gt; Do you have a mental picture of how my drive works,

: &gt;&gt; impossible?
: &gt;
: &gt; It is possible with only a single mass and no drive motor.  We use it
: &gt; frequently to boost the speed of satellites / probes.  But we do not
start
: &gt; from a circular orbit, and depending on which side of the planetary body
: &gt; we approach on, controls whether we boost or brake.
: &gt;
: &gt;&gt; I agree that it sounds impossible, but I  don't believe
: &gt;&gt; it is impossible (in theory at least).
: &gt;
: &gt; If you think you can keep from imparting spin, or that it is even
: &gt; desirable to do so, yes it is impossible.  As someone pointed out, the
: &gt; Moon is getting a boost simply because the center of mass of the tides
and
: &gt; the Earth-proper are not co-aligned.
: &gt;
: &gt; The &quot;inner&quot; weight will be orbitting slightly faster.  Reducing the
: &gt; weight-to-weight spacing will merely speed up the spin rotation
: &gt; (conservation of angular momentum).
: &gt;
: &gt; You mention &quot;theory&quot;.  I have not seen your math yet.  If you are going

I know that. I also know that my gravity drive doesn't involve any real
paradox, however paradoxical it may seem at first.

You will of course note that my gravity drive does not use the slingshot
effect; it uses a different mechanism.

I may also point out another slight error in my maths; the acceleration of

Do you mean &quot;initial acceleration&quot; of the golfball? This would depend upon
how long the head of the golfclub is in contact with the ball; the shorter
the period the higher the acceleration required.

Returning to my question, can you see any reason that my gravity drive

&gt;&gt; &gt; Your drive doesn't work because of conservation of angular

&gt;&gt; My drive is not intended to rotate at all. If the spaceship does rotate,
&gt;&gt; its
&gt;&gt; an unintended consequence.

&gt; As far as I can tell, the only thing your drive achieves is this
&gt; unintended consequence.  You're simply wishing that the

&gt; goes into rotation of the spacecraft.

You seem to be arguing two completely opposite points of view.

On one hand, you say that all that will happen is that the masses will start
rotating or tumbling. This obviously involves a transfer of angular momentum
from the earth to the spaceship.

However, then you say that the spaceship can't rob the earth of angular
momentum.

Obviously, only one of these can be true.

I believe the whole subject of the spaceship tumbling/rotating to be a
complete red herring. Firstly, this is potentially controllable through
gyroscopes, and as I am only discussing &quot;in principle&quot; I can easily put them
into my spaceship. Secondly, the arrangement will still generate lift (in
theory) even if the masses are also revolving around their centre of
gravity. Thirdly, if you tweak the geometry to deliberately cause the
spaceship to start revolving, you have a similar paradoxical result except
it applies to angular momentum instead (linear) momentum - the gravity drive
has transferred momentum from a spherically symmetric earth to the
spaceship.

No, it doesn't.  It involves trading angular momentum of the orbit
with
the angular momentum of the ship's rotation.  However, the change
in the orbit is insignificant because the moment arm is so much

One aside--I'm generally sympathetic to novel space drive concepts
based on known physics, and I greatly empathize with your frustration
at having to repeatedly explain the concept to people who simply
&quot;don't get it&quot;.  I've had that experience many times, both with my own
concepts and with explaining other concepts.  My current pet peeve
is constantly having to re-explain Dr. Young Bae's &quot;Photonic Laser
Thruster&quot; concept.

Your drive concept is something which is based on normal physics
principles and isn't &quot;kooky&quot;...and I remain convinced that something
involving shifting masses should work in conjunction with three
body orbital mechanics (i.e. Earth+Moon+spacecraft).  I just think
the drive concept you're presenting in a two body situation doesn't
work.

My spaceship doesn't need to apply any torque to the earth, because it
doesn't necessarily have to rotate. There is no need for transfer of angular
momentum.

Here is a slightly different form of my gravity drive, used for the purposes
of braking and not achieving orbital velocity, which may make the central
physical mechanism clearer.

Imagine a hyperbolic orbit, such that your spaceship comes close enough to a
black hole for your outgoing path to be deflected say 10 degrees from your
incoming path as it passes by the black hole. From a distance, you are
coming almost directly at the black hole. I put it to you that a slight
variation on my drive can slow down the spaceship so that it is captured
into an elliptical orbit around the black hole.

This is how I do it. When I am well away from the black hole, I split my
spaceship in two halves, connected by a very, very long rope. One half
continues on its original orbit, which has its trajectory changed by only 10
degrees as a result of passing the black hole. The other half gets a slight
sidewise nudge, so that it falls slightly deeper into the gravity well and
is whipped around almost 180 degrees.

Both halves pass the black hole and move away from the black hole, but one
half ends up with its course deflected by 10 degrees and the other by almost
180 degrees. They have identical speeds, but the two halves are moving in
almost opposite directions. Considering the two halves as a single system,
the total momentum with respect to the black hole is almost zero, as the two
halves have the same speed but in almost opposite directions.

They are connected by a rope. You use a motor to pull the rope in. By the
conservation of momentum, the two halves will end up almost stationary with
respect to the black hole.

Do you agree that such a mechanism could be used to slow down or stop a
spaceship, with a long enough rope and a deep enough gravity well? Even
though the orbit of the spaceship (and indeed each half after it separates)
is hyperbolic?

Yes, you do.  There is a massive amount of angular momentum in the
orbit itself.  If you want to raise or lower the orbit, you need to
add or
remove angular momentum to the orbit.  There's just no way around it.

Oh god, you do NOT want to know how much energy this is going to
take.  Conservation of angular momentum is nasty here.  Note that
not only will the inner mass get deflected by 180 degrees but it will
also be shifted sideways so there's a large moment arm.

When pulling on the rope, angular momentum must be conserved.
This means that however fast your approach velocity was, multiply
that velocity by the ratio with which you're reducing the rope
length.  If you reduce the rope length to 1/100 of the original
length, then you increase the velocity of the weights by 100.
This requires energy input equal to 9999 times the original
kinetic energy.

This depends on your definition of &quot;slow down&quot;.  What will
happen is that as you pull on the rope, the two masses will
continue &quot;orbiting&quot; around the black hole but will do so with
increasing speed.  The action of the rope is essentially
massively increasing the inward pull.  Assuming the rope
isn't perfectly centered and the masses aren't perfectly
moving in perfect sync, then the motion will actually be
rather chaotic.  But assuming the masses neither collide
with each other or the black hole in the chaos, there's
no avoiding the severe increase in velocity to conserve
angular momentum.

Of course, I'm assuming physics thought experiment
equipment--the infinitely strong rope is required.

No physical rope is that strong.  And the physics
limitations of rope strength are what limits your drive
concept.  You can trade angular momentum between
the rotation of the ship and the orbit's angular momentum,
but this only works until the rotation of the ship breaks
the strength limits of the rope.

I think this is wrong on a couple of counts.

Firstly, I don't actually care about the energy that is required. My
spaceship has effectively unlimitted energy available. I am eliminating the
need for reaction mass, not energy.

Secondly, its energy neutral anyway. If the spaceship is moving at speed v
at distance d from the black hole, then after the two masses separate and
are each again at distance d from the black hole they will each still be
moving at speed v, albeit moving in different directions. When the rope
becomes taut, you use regenerative breaking to recover the kinetic energy
and store it in a battery. Or you just let the rope &quot;snap&quot; taut, and
disipate the kinetic energy as heat. Either way, the momentum equation is
the same - both halves are moving at speed v but in almost opposite
directions. Whether you recover that energy or not, the momentum of the two
halves of the spaceship is almost equal in size and opposite in direction,
so the net momentum is small.

You will note that my gravity drive must dissipate energy somehow - either
by charging a battery through regenerative breaking, or by throwing it away
as friction, or some other mechanism. The whole point of this drive is to
reduce speed; the energy has to go somewhere.

Again, I don't care about the energy equation, I care about the momentum

Indeed. But my argument is that the spaceship can potentially be captured by
the black hole, despite it approaching in a hyperbolic orbit. It does this
without reaction mass.

Lets look at this in the inertial frame of the black hole. On approach, at
distance d the two halves are together and each half has kinetic energy
0.5*m*v^2 and momentum mv. After the close approach, one half continues in
more or less the same direction and has kinetic energy at distance d of
0.5mv^2, and momentum mv. The other half is whipped around the black hole
and is deflected by almost 180 degrees. At distance d it also has energy
0.5*mv^2, but momentum -mv. When the rope snaps taut (or the relative speed
difference is reduced to zero by regenerative breaking), the net momentum of
the spaceship as a whole relative to the black hole is zero. With a perfect,
inelastic rope the relative speed of the two halves will become the same,
and be almost at rest with respect to the black hole.

A remark you made earlier provides a key insight as to why this works.
Essentially, if this is a two body problem (the spaceship and the black
hole), there is nothing you can do to reduce the speed or the magnitude of
the momentum vector. By splitting the spaceship into two, connected by a
rope, this is changed into a three body problem, with the two halves coupled
by a rope rather than by mutual gravitational attraction. This allows a huge
range of orbital solutions other than continuing in a hyperbolic orbit.

More generally, this is how my gravity drives works. Because the two masses
can move independently (up to the limit of the length of the rope or the
length of the connecting rod), its really a three body problem disguised as
a two body problem. This allows additional solutions to the equations of
motion. Specifically each half exchanges a different amount of momentum with
the black hole depending upon its exact orbit. If you are recovering energy
by using the extending rope to power a motor when they are separating, then
you will recover all the kinetic energy, but the total momentum of the
system is now almost zero (0.5*m*v plus 0.5*m*(-v)).

I know why you want to recast this as a problem in angular momentum. You
want to use conservation of angular momentum to &quot;prove&quot; its impossible. You
don't have to use angular momentum to demonstrate this seemingly paradoxical
result - the same argument applies to &quot;normal&quot; momentum. On approach, when
the masses are together, the momentum of the spaceship is 0.5mv + 0.5mv.
After the two halves have passed the black hole, one mass continuues in an
almost unchanged trajectory (momentum 0.5mv) and the other has the same
speed but almost opposite direction of travel (momentum -0.5mv). The rope
snaps taut, or the kinetic energy is recovered using regenerative braking,
and the total momentum relative to the black hole is zero. The spaceship
comes to rest (or close to it) relative to the black hole. A hyperbolic
orbit has been changed to an elliptic orbit, albeit possibly with the
spaceship also rotating around its centre of gravity.

If we recast this in terms of angular momentum, this is what happens. The
spherical symmetry of the black hole means there is no obvious mechanism to
exchange angular momentum between the spaceship (or its two halves) and the
black hole, as you identified earlier. In fact, there is no exchange of
angular momentum with the black hole. The angular momentum of the spaceships
trajectory past the black hole is converted into angular momentum of the two
halves rotating around

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Bottom line--you need to explain how your proposed drive
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; applies a torque on the Earth.
&gt; &gt;&gt; My spaceship doesn't need to apply any torque to the earth, because it
&gt; &gt;&gt; doesn't necessarily have to rotate. There is no need for transfer of
&gt; &gt;&gt; angular
&gt; &gt;&gt; momentum.
&gt; &gt; Yes, you do.  There is a massive amount of angular momentum in the
&gt; &gt; orbit itself.  If you want to raise or lower the orbit, you need to
&gt; &gt; add or
&gt; &gt; remove angular momentum to the orbit.  There's just no way around it.

I notice you didn't respond to this.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt;&gt; Here is a slightly different form of my gravity drive, used for the
&gt; &gt;&gt; purposes
&gt; &gt;&gt; of braking and not achieving orbital velocity, which may make the central
&gt; &gt;&gt; physical mechanism clearer.
&gt; &gt;&gt; Imagine a hyperbolic orbit, such that your spaceship comes close enough
&gt; &gt;&gt; to a
&gt; &gt;&gt; black hole for your outgoing path to be deflected say 10 degrees from
&gt; &gt;&gt; your
&gt; &gt;&gt; incoming path as it passes by the black hole. From a distance, you are
&gt; &gt;&gt; coming almost directly at the black hole. I put it to you that a slight
&gt; &gt;&gt; variation on my drive can slow down the spaceship so that it is captured
&gt; &gt;&gt; into an elliptical orbit around the black hole.
&gt; &gt;&gt; This is how I do it. When I am well away from the black hole, I split my
&gt; &gt;&gt; spaceship in two halves, connected by a very, very long rope. One half
&gt; &gt;&gt; continues on its original orbit, which has its trajectory changed by only
&gt; &gt;&gt; 10
&gt; &gt;&gt; degrees as a result of passing the black hole. The other half gets a
&gt; &gt;&gt; slight
&gt; &gt;&gt; sidewise nudge, so that it falls slightly deeper into the gravity well
&gt; &gt;&gt; and
&gt; &gt;&gt; is whipped around almost 180 degrees.
&gt; &gt;&gt; Both halves pass the black hole and move away from the black hole, but
&gt; &gt;&gt; one
&gt; &gt;&gt; half ends up with its course deflected by 10 degrees and the other by
&gt; &gt;&gt; almost
&gt; &gt;&gt; 180 degrees. They have identical speeds, but the two halves are moving in
&gt; &gt;&gt; almost opposite directions. Considering the two halves as a single
&gt; &gt;&gt; system,
&gt; &gt;&gt; the total momentum with respect to the black hole is almost zero, as the
&gt; &gt;&gt; two
&gt; &gt;&gt; halves have the same speed but in almost opposite directions.
&gt; &gt;&gt; They are connected by a rope. You use a motor to pull the rope in. By the
&gt; &gt;&gt; conservation of momentum, the two halves will end up almost stationary
&gt; &gt;&gt; with
&gt; &gt;&gt; respect to the black hole.
&gt; &gt; Oh god, you do NOT want to know how much energy this is going to
&gt; &gt; take.  Conservation of angular momentum is nasty here.  Note that
&gt; &gt; not only will the inner mass get deflected by 180 degrees but it will
&gt; &gt; also be shifted sideways so there's a large moment arm.
&gt; I think this is wrong on a couple of counts.
&gt; Firstly, I don't actually care about the energy that is required. My
&gt; spaceship has effectively unlimitted energy available. I am eliminating the
&gt; need for reaction mass, not energy.
">

This doesn't make what I said the slightest bit wrong.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Secondly, its energy neutral anyway.
">

No, it isn't.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; If the spaceship is moving at speed v
&gt; at distance d from the black hole, then after the two masses separate and
&gt; are each again at distance d from the black hole they will each still be
&gt; moving at speed v, albeit moving in different directions. When the rope
&gt; becomes taut, you use regenerative breaking to recover the kinetic energy
&gt; and store it in a battery. Or you just let the rope &quot;snap&quot; taut, and
&gt; disipate the kinetic energy as heat. Either way, the momentum equation is
&gt; the same - both halves are moving at speed v but in almost opposite
&gt; directions. Whether you recover that energy or not, the momentum of the two
&gt; halves of the spaceship is almost equal in size and opposite in direction,
&gt; so the net momentum is small.
">

You seem to think that you can just look at conservation of momentum
and this somehow makes conservation of angular momentum
irrelevant.

But it isn't.  Both conservation of momentum and conservation of
angular momentum must always be satisfied.

If you define moving slowly as the center of gravity is moving slowly,
then congratulations--your spaceship is moving slowly.  But at the
same time, both of the individual masses are moving very quickly.
Either that, or the individual masses are extremely far apart from
each other (assuming an unlimited length rope).

It's all about conservation of angular momentum.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; You will note that my gravity drive must dissipate energy somehow - either
&gt; by charging a battery through regenerative breaking, or by throwing it away
&gt; as friction, or some other mechanism. The whole point of this drive is to

The problem isn't dissipating energy.  The problem was always and
remains conservation of angular momentum.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Do you agree that such a mechanism could be used to slow down or stop a
&gt; &gt;&gt; spaceship, with a long enough rope and a deep enough gravity well? Even
&gt; &gt;&gt; though the orbit of the spaceship (and indeed each half after it
&gt; &gt;&gt; separates)
&gt; &gt;&gt; is hyperbolic?
&gt; &gt; This depends on your definition of &quot;slow down&quot;.  What will
&gt; &gt; happen is that as you pull on the rope, the two masses will
&gt; &gt; continue &quot;orbiting&quot; around the black hole but will do so with
&gt; &gt; increasing speed.  The action of the rope is essentially
&gt; &gt; massively increasing the inward pull.  Assuming the rope
&gt; &gt; isn't perfectly centered and the masses aren't perfectly
&gt; &gt; moving in perfect sync, then the motion will actually be
&gt; &gt; rather chaotic.  But assuming the masses neither collide
&gt; &gt; with each other or the black hole in the chaos, there's
&gt; &gt; no avoiding the severe increase in velocity to conserve
&gt; &gt; angular momentum.
&gt; Indeed. But my argument is that the spaceship can potentially be captured by
&gt; the black hole, despite it approaching in a hyperbolic orbit. It does this
&gt; without reaction mass.
">

I'm not sure what amazing thing you think you've discovered
here.  It's the equivalent of two bodies approaching a planet
in parallel and purposefully colliding on the far side.  You can,
in principle, use some sort of magical rope or spring to
cushion this controlled collision.

Note that in this simpler example, the angular momentum
starts and ends as zero.  The two bodies have the equal
and opposite angular momentums because the moment
arms are opposite vectors.  At the end of the controlled
collision, the two bodies are sitting at zero velocity.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Lets look at this in the inertial frame of the black hole. On approach, at
&gt; distance d the two halves are together and each half has kinetic energy
&gt; 0.5*m*v^2 and momentum mv. After the close approach, one half continues in
&gt; more or less the same direction and has kinetic energy at distance d of
&gt; 0.5mv^2, and momentum mv. The other half is whipped around the black hole
&gt; and is deflected by almost 180 degrees. At distance d it also has energy
&gt; 0.5*mv^2, but momentum -mv. When the rope snaps taut (or the relative speed
&gt; difference is reduced to zero by regenerative breaking), the net momentum of
&gt; the spaceship as a whole relative to the black hole is zero. With a perfect,
&gt; inelastic rope the relative speed of the two halves will become the same,
&gt; and be almost at rest with respect to the black hole.
">

You're ignoring conservation of angular momentum again.
In your example, the bodies start off with angular momentum.
That can't change.  If you let a stupendously long rope snap taut,
then the relative velocities of the masses will NOT be zero.
Instead, the masses will be revolving around each other.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; A remark you made earlier provides a key insight as to why this works.
&gt; Essentially, if this is a two body problem (the spaceship and the black
&gt; hole), there is nothing you can do to reduce the speed or the magnitude of
&gt; the momentum vector. By splitting the spaceship into two, connected by a
&gt; rope, this is changed into a three body problem, with the two halves coupled
&gt; by a rope rather than by mutual gravitational attraction. This allows a huge
&gt; range of orbital solutions other than continuing in a hyperbolic orbit.
">

It only allows a huge range of solutions because of the magic
rope.  With a real rope, the range becomes very extremely small.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; No physical rope is that strong.  And the physics
&gt; &gt; limitations of rope strength are what limits your drive
&gt; &gt; concept.
&gt; So, with a strong enough and long enough rope it will work?
">

This depends on your definition of &quot;work&quot;.  If you mean it's
possible to produce a possibly measurable change in your
orbit (limited by the strength of the rope), then it works.
But if you mean you can keep on changing the orbit gradually
indefinitely, then it doesn't work.  It will only work up until
the point where the masses revolve around each other
so quickly that the rope snaps.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt;  You can trade angular momentum between
&gt; &gt; the rotation of the ship and the orbit's angular momentum,

&gt; I know why you want to recast this as a problem in angular momentum. You
&gt; want to use conservation of angular momentum to &quot;prove&quot; its impossible.

I don't &quot;want&quot; to.  I already did it.

I have to admit that I don't completely understand your proposal,
but the problem seems to lie right here: when you pull the two
masses together, yes, you are doing work.  What happens when you
stop them again, either by them colliding with each other or via
some other mechanism?  You are doing work again.  The momentum of
the two operations cancels each other out.  Bear in mind that
momentum is proportional to mass, not weight, and so any changes
to the strength of gravity are irrelevant to the conservation of
momemtum.  It's here that I believe your logic is lacking.

Things get slightly more interesting if we allow one mass to to
pass through the other (e.g. one of the masses is hoop-shaped), so
that we can seperate them again without needing to do any more
work.  However, to repeat the process we them have to apply two
lots of momemtum to each body.  One lot to bring them back to rest
with respect to each other, and a second lot to send them back in
the opposite direction.  After applying the first lot we are
basically back to square one, albeit with the masses at opposite
sides of the system.  Repeat the process again and everything is as
it was in the first instance.

He has two masses, both at apogee, separated by 100 km seconds
(although I suspect he means kilometres) and therefore not both at
the same apogee. Then he anticipates both will arrive at perigee and he'll
&quot;pull them together&quot;, but since they have different orbital periods
they are not going to arrive at perigee AT THE SAME TIME and still
be &quot;pointing towards the earth&quot;, by which we presume he means
the Earth and the two masses all lie on a straight line. It would be a
simple matter to program Webb's craziness to show him it won't
work but that would involve the programmer in doing his stupidity
for him. It is up to Webb to prove his &quot;gravity drive&quot;, not others
to do the work for him. It very much seems he's trying to pick
himself up by his own bootstraps, imagining that pulling on them
uses energy. He doesn't seem to realise that jumping up in the air
results in falling back down again unless he can jump fast enough
to achieve escape velocity in one leap.

">

No, or at least this is irrelevant.

I gave in another post a different description of a very similar mechanism
used for braking (which is of course also a form of acceleration).

My drive works by transfering momentum from the earth to the spaceship.
Here's how it does it.

If you have a single mass in an elliptical orbit around the earth, it
constantly exchanges momentum with the earth. For example, it moves quickly
at perigee and slowly at apogee. The laws of physics (and in particular the
conservation of energy) says that if the satellite is at distance d from the
earth, it will always have the same speed v, irrespective of the path
(orbit) that it takes to get to that distance d. Because the speed is a
function only of the distance d from the earth, so is the magnitude of the
momentum vector. While the size of the momentum vector at distance d is
independent of the path, the direction the vector points certainly does
depend upon the path taken.

If you have two masses 100 kms apart, they will try and take two slightly
different orbits around the earth. This will be limitted to 100 kms
different, but it will still be different. By the time the two masses are
again at apogee, the momentum vectors for each of the two masses will have
the same magnitude, but slightly different directions. When you add these -
by considering the two masses as a single connected object - the magnitude
of the sum of the momentum vectors is slightly less than the sum of the
magnitudes, as the vectors point in slightly different directions. This is
exactly what happens when you use your motor to slowly bring the masses
together. Your spaceship has lost momentum, and hence speed. This is a
second order effect. If the distance between the masses is very small
compared to the distance from the centre of the earth, then its a very small
effect indeed.

For a 100 kms separation (&quot;kms&quot; = &quot;kilometres&quot; where I come from), and an
eccentric orbit with a perigee of 7,000 kms from the centre of the earth, I
calculate you get a sustained acceleration of about 0.09 m/s. This is about
1% of the acceleration due to gravity at this altitude.

This is small, but is achieved without using any reaction mass, which makes
it a &quot;gravity drive&quot;.

You can use this mechanism to lose momentum, and hence provide braking,
again without expending any reaction mass. You can also run this in reverse
to increase momentum/speed/energy, by using a motor to force the masses
apart when the natural orbit is trying to pull them together.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Bear in mind that
&gt; momentum is proportional to mass, not weight, and so any changes
&gt; to the strength of gravity are irrelevant to the conservation of
&gt; momemtum.  It's here that I believe your logic is lacking.
">

No. When you are in orbit around the earth, you are constantly exchanging
momentum with the earth, because there is a force between the satellite and
the earth (gravity). If you have two connected masses orbiting the earth,
then the force of gravity (and hence the amount of momentum exchanged) will
typically be different for the two bodies. By changing the distance between
the masses, you can change the magnitude of the effect at different points
in the orbit and use it to adjust the momentum of the spaceship as a whole.

All of the stuff you/we learned at school about two bodies interacting under
gravity - for example the only possible orbits being conic sections
(circular, elliptical, parabolic or hyperbolic) really only apply to point
or spherical masses. This has never before been a practical problem. All of
the large, rigid bodies in the universe are spheres. However, we can now
contemplate building a space station consisting of two large masses,
separated by a 100 kms tether and revolving around their common centre of
gravity - a dumbell shape. That would not have an elliptical orbit; not even
the mid point of the rope would have an elliptical orbit. It does not orbit
as a single body concentrated at its &quot;centre of gravity&quot;; because the force
of gravity falls off as the inverse square (and not linearly) its a far more
chaotic motion.

This is another way of looking at my &quot;gravity drive&quot;. You allow the masses
to be together and hence have an elliptical orbit when it suits you, and you
seperate them and hence use the equations of motion of a large dumbell when
this suits you better.

If you are trying to achieve an increase in altitude/momentum, the strategy
I used for my calculation (and I believe the optimal strategy) is to
separate the masses by the maximim possible distance on the way &quot;down&quot;, and
pull them together on the way up. You will achieve higher and higher apogees
on each orbit, until you reach escape velocity. You haven't violated
conservation of energy, because you are expending more energy pulling the
masses together than you could have gained even in theory from letting them
separate. You are continually pumping energy into the system.

You are, however, continually increasing your speed without apparently
&quot;pushing against&quot; something - a reaction mass. In reality, the push comes
from the fact that the two masses have different gravitational attraction
with the earth, and the equal and opposite reaction is against the earth
itself. Hence my term  &quot;gravity drive&quot;, because it works in a sense by using
gravity to &quot;push&quot; against the earth.

The unbelievably great thing is of course that it requires no reaction mass,
only energy which you can get from solar panels. Its slow, but it will run
for ever. Its like a sail boat compared to a power boat. You could use this
effect to boost your altitude enough to get into a gravtitational slingshot
around Venus or Mars, and from their you can coast to Jupiter. Then you have
a much deeper gravity well to play with, and you can potentially scoot
around the outer solar system quite quickly.

I not only believe this is possible in theory, I believe it could even be
very practical. We cannot deploy a sattelite consisting two large masses
joined by a 100kms retractable tether at the moment, but I can certainly
believe that one day we will be able to. At that point, we have built a
gravity drive.

You are having to do work moving the large weights around against the
force of gravity.

Your proposal is no more interesting than a little girl pumping energy
into a playground swing by moving her body weight up and down at the
right time. Parametric excitation of a periodic oscillator isn't even
remotely new.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parametric_oscillator

Your proposed method as stated would suffer from various problems not
least that the two massive bodies will spin round each other rather
violently when you bring them together. Essentially just like when the
ballerina or ice skater brings her arms in.

It's not really a &quot;pure gravity&quot; drive, but rather a tether drive.
You're
confusing yourself by working with an overly complex example.

Consider a much simpler starting point--there are two masses
starting at zero velocity above Earth.  If nothing is done, these
masses will simply fall straight down to Earth.  However, instead
there's a spring between them which shoves them apart.  Rather
than hitting Earth, the two masses go into elliptical orbits that
miss the Earth.  After traveling 180 degrees, the two masses
spring against each other.  By pumping extra energy into the
spring force, it's possible to bounce the masses off each other
at a faster speed.  Instead of retracing the same elliptical orbit,
these masses bounce off each other onto a higher orbit.

And after traveling another 180 degrees, the masses bounce
off each other again--providing another opportunity to pump in
more energy.  In this fashion, it's possible to repeatedly
boost the orbit upward, until ultimately the masses escape
the planet (into parabolic or hyperbolic paths).

Now, instead of bouncing the masses off each other, you can
just let them pass by each other--barely missing.  You can
pump in extra spring energy the same way as &quot;perpetual
motion&quot; toys (a well timed extra tug with electromagnets).

This propulsion scheme doesn't require any nonphysical
magic ropes or anything.  It doesn't suffer ugly conservation
of angular momentum limitations because the angular
momentum is zero.

Does it make sense to call this a &quot;gravity&quot; drive?  Not really;
it was the electromagnets which did the work.  If you replace
the electromagnets with a tether, then I'd argue the drive is
really a sort of tether drive.

Have you ever heard of this being used to create a spaceship drive? I
wondered in my original post whether the concept of using this effect for
this purpose was new. I couldn't find any relevant Google hits. Whilst I

qualify as a theoretically possible means of accelerating a spaceship

The fact that you don't separate the two masses limits the

You simply do things in reverse.  You start off with the two
masses entering in parabolic orbit.  Then instead of giving
a &quot;push&quot; each time, you give a &quot;pull&quot; each time.  The first
&quot;pull&quot; takes them down to an elliptical orbit.  Subsequent
&quot;pulls&quot; lower the elliptical orbit each time.

Sigh.  How many times do I have to repeat--your drive can
make a change in its orbit, but this change is negligible.
You can't just repeat giving small nudges each time and
have them accumulate.  The problem is conservation of
angular momentum.  For every nudge you make, angular
momentum must be conserved--so whatever small angular
momentum you add to your orbit must come with an
opposite angular momentum change to your spacecraft's
spin.

The result is that before you can accumulate a significant
change in the orbit, your run up against the strength limits
of the rope.  If you consider the massive amount of
angular momentum in the orbit, the maximum angular
momentum your spacecraft's spin can have is dwarfed
in comparison.

In order for your drive to work, you'd need a rope so
strong that it's literally possible to fling things into
escape velocity with it.

You really need to come to grips with the fundamental
problem, here.  It's conservation of angular momentum.

Too bad your calculation was wrong, because you failed to consider
most of the energy actually goes into rotating the spacecraft.

This should actually be really obvious, when you consider the rotation
of a tidally locked satellite.  The reason why being tidally locked is
a stable configuration is precisely because it minimizes energy.
To change from tidally locked rotation to any other rotation rate
takes
energy.  This is true whether you rotate one direction (which
slightly raises the orbit) or your rotate in the other direction
(which
slightly lowers the orbit).  In other words, the kinetic energy of
the rotation overwhelms the change in the energy of the orbit
change.

There is nothing mysterious about conservation of angular momentum
implying that a change in the rotation rate is coupled with a change
in the orbital path.  There's also nothing mysterious about the fact
that the change in the orbital path is utterly miniscule, so even if
you changed the rotation rate so much that the satellite was
literally pulling itself apart, the orbital change wouldn't be
significant.

So you think that my drive is theoretically possible, but that with present

I really was just trying to present a theoretical model of how a gravity
drive could work. I was not attempting to produce a design spec on how
strong and light the structural members (eg the tether rope) would have to
be. Its more of an &quot;in principle&quot; model of a gravity drive rather than a

The acceleration is pretty irrelevant--the total amount of change you
can make to the orbit isn't significant.  Whether you creep toward
&quot;the wall&quot; slowly and gradually or run straight for it quickly, you
can't get past &quot;the wall&quot;.  The wall you run up against is the point
at which the rotation of the masses pulling on the rod reach the
material strength limits.

It's like trying to stand on your tiptoes in order to fly.  Your total
altitude is limited, no matter how slowly you lift yourself upward.

To the exact same extent, you can &quot;in principle&quot; fly upward by

Its hardly a fair analogy, and its not to the &quot;same extent&quot;. Its a
completely different problem. That you can't fly from standing on your
tiptoes does not derive from any physical limitation of the strength of your
toes. As I understand it, you agree that my drive would provide orbital
changes, but the limitations of the strengths of current materials means
that it isn't vaguely practical.

You cannot fly &quot;in theory&quot; by standing on your tiptoes; you cannot build a
gravity drive &quot;in practice&quot; because you can't build a rope strong enough to
get a decent effect. I would note that in the early days of rocketry many
people believed that you couldn't use a rocket to get into orbit, because
(amongst other reasons) there were no propellants strong enough. Solving
this materials problem took new materials (lox and hydrogen), more
sophisticated designs (multi-stage rockets), etc.

I think you agree that a propulsion effect occurs, but that the practical
limitations of the strength of the ropes means you can't get enough
propulsion to do anything useful. A bit like trying to build a space rocket
using the same materials and design that are used for a fireworks cracker,
just scaled up. If you only have access to materials and technology
available in the 19th Century, you couldn't build a rocket to get into
orbit. If you only have access to materials and technology available in the
early 21st Century, you can't build a practical gravity drive. Your
objections to my drive are similar to the objections raised against rockets
as a means of getting into orbit - physicists believed such a thing was
possible in theory (even though many people believed it couldn't be, because
there was nothing in space to &quot;push against), but the limitations of 19th
Century technology and materials meant that it couldn't be done &quot;in
practice&quot;.

I am very disappointed in the response to this idea. I had always believed
that to accelerate a spaceship, you needed some form of reaction mass. As
far as I am aware, nobody has ever described a spaceship drive that needed
only a gravity well, and did not require reaction mass. I have produced a
model for a gravity drive - a completely new concept for a spaceship drive,
as far as I am aware - and you are objecting that its not currently feasible
because we can't build ropes strong enough to get a large enough effect to
be useful. I believe a pure gravity drive that works in theory (subject to
having materials strong enough) is an interesting concept, even if materials
strength does not allow a useful spaceship to be built in practice.

Have you ever seen a design for an anti-gravity drive that worked even in
theory before? And if you haven't, is the best you can come up with is that
it wouldn't work in practice because we haven't got ropes strong enough?
Doesn't the fact that an anti-gravity drive is possible in theory if not in
practice have some interest to this newsgroup, given that as far as I am
aware nobody has previously been able to describe a mechanism by which an
antigravity drive could be built even in theory?
