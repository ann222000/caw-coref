Tonight, Bill O'Reilly was talking about Gary Sinise and the
Disabled Veterans Life Memorial Foundation. They need just a
few million bucks more to build it. That's "chump change" to
a billionaire, and should be easy to raise among millionaire
elitists. Even the tiniest contributions will be appreciated:

I know that many Hollywood Liberals might have a buck to two
to spare for this important memorial fund. So even if you've
hated the U.S. Military, your freedom to express your hatred
could be fleeting if you don't support our brave men &amp; women
who serve in harm's way--and in this case, who have suffered
debilitating injuries in the process of protecting *you* and
your earthly freedom. So cough it up. And don't miss CSI: NY!

Sincerely,

As a disablid vet I tell YOU DJM to drop dead.

There are those who believe that life here, began out there, far across the
universe, with tribes of humans, who may have been the forefathers of the
Egyptians, or the Toltecs, or the Mayans. Some believe that they may yet be
brothers of man, who even now fight to survive, somewhere beyond the
heavens.

&gt;I think the GOVERNMENT should FIRST take responsibility for it's actions,
&gt;and the care of it's &quot;own&quot;. What Americans contribute should be spent above
&gt;and beyond that. Until the Federal Government stops ignoring the Vet's and
&gt;treating it's retires like old baggage, the world would be a better place.
&gt;Let's even include the DOD and how about the Corporations making Millions,
&gt;Billions of Profit from the actions of these Hero's. They could make each
&gt;returning soldier a Millioniare, and provide the best possible living
&gt;conditions and healthcare on what these Corporations spend on Car Service
&gt;alone each year. One Wall St firm pays out 20 Mil. a yr (that's just local
&gt;limo service) just for it's employees to get a ride home.
&gt;You know a while back someone sent a picture of this spanking new missile

&gt;of Billions of Dollars to build it (including the millions paid out in
&gt;Congressional and Senatorial graft (ie Duke Cunningham)... Gee maybe they
&gt;could have used that steel and those dollars for let's sat artifical limbs?,
&gt;better Hummer Armor? Six or seven new Hospitals?

It's an amazing concept: "Ask not what your country can do for you".  :-)
