My neighbor has a '96 Silhouette.  The dash shows that the power door is always
open and now the motor will not work.  We thought it was because the switch
thought the door was open.  We took the switch apart and cleaned it.  Now the
dash sometimes shows the door as open when it is open or closed.  Sometimes it
shows the door as closed when it is open or closed.

On the door contacts, looks like the top two contacts go to the power door locks
and the bottom three do something different.  The middle contact has 12 volts
power when the ignition switch is on.

My Clymers does not have wiring diagrams of the power door.

Is this controlled by it's own control module or the engine module?  Controlled
by relays?

When I push the door open or close switch, nothing happens.  We've checked the
fuses.

Thanks for any help.

Don't have a schematic for a '96.  Here's a description for a '98.  Does it
help any?

Power Sliding Door (PSD) Circuit Description

The Power Sliding Door (PSD) is designed in order to open and close the
right sliding door by the following components:

One of two buttons located in the vehicle
The keyless entry transmitter
The PSD has a power assist that activates when the sliding is operated
manually.

A PSD on/off switch enables or disables the PSD. The PSD on/off switch is
located in the overhead console. Two PSD open/close switches activate the
PSD operation:

The overhead console switch
The right B-pillar switch
The keyless entry transmitter also has a PSD open/close button.

Power Assist

Important
The Power Sliding Door (PSD) only operates with the sliding door unlocked.
When the child security lock is engaged, the following conditions exist:
The PSD will operate.
The sliding door will not open when pulling the inside door handle.

When pulling either door handle with the sliding door fully closed, the
Power Sliding Door (PSD) activates a power assist. The power assist assumes
control of the sliding door operation.

The power assist feature assumes control and fully opens or fully closes the
door under the following conditions:

The sliding door is open.
The sliding door is manually moved move than 7.5 cm (3 in) in either
direction.
Power Sliding Door (PSD) Components
Rear Side Door Actuator Control Module

Important
Perform the PSD re-initialization procedure when any of the following
conditions exist:

The PSD is inoperative.
The vehicle battery is reconnected after being disconnected.
The vehicle battery is recharged due to a low or discharged battery
condition.
The RADIO fuse (located in the underhood accessory wiring junction block) is
reinstalled or replaced.
You exit any of the Diagnostic Modes. Refer to Diagnostic Modes in Power
Sliding Door (PSD) Diagnostic Information for more information.

The rear side door actuator control module is located on the rear portion of
the PSD assembly, behind the right quarter panel.

The rear side door actuator control module monitors the following inputs for
sliding door activation:

The overhead console PSD on/off switch
The PSD open/close switches (overhead console and B-pillar)
The PSD open/close signal from the keyless entry system's Remote Control
Door Lock Receiver (RCDLR)
The PARK position of the automatic transaxle shifter
The rear side door actuator control module uses the following inputs in
order to determine the exact sliding door location necessary for proper PSD
operation:

The door lock latch switch The door lock latch switch sends a ground signal
to the rear side door actuator control module when one of the following
conditions exist:
The sliding door is open.
The sliding door is ajar (first latch catch).
The sliding door is latched (fully closed).
The optical sensor The optical sensor sends signal pulses to the rear side
door actuator control module in order to determine the exact position of the
sliding door within the door's travel.
Door Lock Latch Switch
The door lock latch switch is part of the sliding door latch assembly. The
door latch switch sends ground signals to the rear side door actuator
control module through CKT 1892. This action indicates when the following
conditions exist:

The sliding door is open.
The sliding door is ajar.
The sliding door is latched (fully closed).
The door lock latch switch receives ground through CKT 750. The following
circuits pass through the switch plate plungers and striker located on the
B-pillar:

CKT 750
CKT 1892
The rear side door actuator control module reduces the power to the cable
motor when the following actions occur:

The PSD is closing.
The sliding door is approximately 30 cm (12 in) from the closed position.
This action slows down the movement of the sliding door. When the switch
plate plungers and striker contact, the following conditions will be
present:

The following circuits are completed:
CKT 750
CKT 1892
The rear side door actuator control module is able to monitor the door lock
latch switch input.
When the sliding door latch moves from the open position to the ajar
position, the door lock latch switch stops sending a ground signal to the
rear side door actuator control module. This action opens CKT 1892. This
condition signals the rear side door actuator control module that the
sliding door has passed from the secondary (open door) position to the
unlatched (ajar) position. When the rear side door actuator control module
detects the door ajar position, the rear side door actuator control module
sends the full power to the cable motor.

As the sliding door continues to close, the sliding door latch moves from
the ajar position to the latched position. When the sliding door is between
the ajar position and the latched position, the door lock latch switch sends
another ground signal to the rear side door actuator control module. This
action signals the rear side door actuator control module that the sliding
door has passed from the unlatched (ajar) position to the latched (closed)
position. The following actions then occur:

The rear side door actuator control module disengages the clutch.
The rear side door actuator control module de-energizes the cable motor.
Optical Sensor

Important
Prevent bright light from reaching the optical sensor when performing
diagnostics with the rear quarter trim panel removed. Bright light may cause
the rear side door actuator control module to be unable to monitor the
sliding door position.

When the sliding door is moving, the optical sensor sends pulses to the rear
side door actuator control module. The rear side door actuator control
monitors these optical sensor pulses at all times, including under the
following conditions:

When the sliding door is manually opened with the PSD on/off switch enabled
When the sliding door is manually closed with the PSD on/off switch enabled
The optical sensor pulses allow the rear side door actuator control module
to calculate the exact position of the sliding door. The optical sensor
allows the rear side door actuator control module to resume the PSD
operation after operating the sliding door manually. The optical sensor is
located at the rear bottom of the PSD assembly.

Door Unlatch Actuator
The Power Sliding Door (PSD) uses a door unlatch actuator in order to
unlatch (open) the sliding door. The rear side door actuator control module
operates the door unlatch actuator.

When the PSD opens the sliding door, the rear side door actuator control
module energizes the door unlatch actuator by sending B+ through CKT 2910.
The door unlatch actuator receives ground through CKT 750. The sliding door
unlatches when the door unlatch actuator is energized. The following
circuits pass through the switch plate plungers and striker located on the
B-pillar:

CKT 750
CKT 2910
The rear side door actuator control module is only able to energize the door
lock unlatch actuator when the switch plate plungers and striker are in
contact. The door unlatch actuator is located inside the upper center of the
sliding door.

Transaxle Range Switch
The rear side door actuator control module monitors the PARK position of the
transaxle range switch. When the transaxle is in the PARK position, the
transaxle range switch sends a B+ signal to the rear side door actuator
control module through CKT 275. When the transaxle is shifted out of the
PARK position, the transaxle range switch does not send a B+ signal to the
rear side door actuator control module.

The rear side door actuator control module uses this signal in order to
inhibit a PSD open operation when the transaxle is shifted out of the PARK
position. The rear side door actuator control module will still allow a PSD
close operation. The rear side door actuator control module will sound the
alarm in order to alert the driver of the following conditions:

The sliding door is not fully closed.
The sliding door may not latch properly due to vehicle motion.
Power Sliding Door (PSD)
Drive Unit (Cable Motor and Clutch)
The drive unit contains the cable motor and the clutch. The cable motor is
used in order to drive the sliding door open or closed. The cable motor and
the clutch are both energized during a PSD open or close operation.

During the last 30 cm (12 in) of sliding door closing travel, the rear side
door actuator control module reduces the power to the cable motor through
Pulse Width Modulation (PWM). This action causes a tone that is emitted from
the PSD assembly. The PSD alarm does not generate this tone.

The rear side door actuator control module sends full power to the cable
motor when receiving the first signal from the door lock latch switch. This
action indicates that the sliding door is in the unlatched (ajar) position.
Refer to Door Lock Latch Switch Description for more information.

The rear side door actuator control module does not energize the cable motor
when the overhead console PSD on/off switch is enabled (pressed). The rear
side door actuator control module disengages the clutch in order to
disconnect the cable motor. This action allows the manual operation of the
sliding door without back driving the cable motor.

PSD Alarm
The PSD alarm sounds when all of the following conditions are present:

The PSD on/off switch is off.
The PSD is closing the sliding door.
The transaxle is shifted out of the PARK position.
The rear side door actuator control module sounds the PSD alarm by sending
B+ to the alarm coil through CKT 902. The rear side door actuator control
module provides ground to the alarm at all times through CKT 902.

Perform one of the following actions in order to stop the PSD alarm:

Shift the transaxle into the PARK position.
Manually pull the
