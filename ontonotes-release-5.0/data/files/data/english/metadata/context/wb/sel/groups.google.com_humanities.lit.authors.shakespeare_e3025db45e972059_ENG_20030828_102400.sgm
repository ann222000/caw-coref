The real issue is the lack of any irrefutable (beyond on any doubt)
document linking the Stratford man to the literary works in question..or for
that matter to acting or as a theater investor because his own personal records
show no evidence of a theatrical career or a literary career. And the name on
the title page is not nearly enough...though Nelson and others sometimes try to
insist that it is by itself....which is hardly the case. They have to prove
the linkage to the name on the title page, they cannot assume the linkage that
they are being asked to prove.

The Strats only have a circumstantial case, when given the magnitude of
the literary figure in question, there should be a rock solid case in his favor
if he was the Bard. The earliest linkage between someone with this name
famous for something and the *specific* Stratford town in Warwickshire is in
the Book of Jeasts (Jests) a national joke book published in 1630. This is
quite assuming but not for Stratfordians who need to do a lot better.

The linkages in the First Folio are NOT smoking gun evidence...other
William Shakespeares living at the time, too many Avons, too many Stratfords
and the &quot;i&quot; in moniments...later in 1632 with the Second Folio changed to &quot;u&quot;s
as in &quot;monument&quot;. Jonson in 1623 is definitely in his poem referring to a body
of literary works as close examination of his words easily shows. The
traditional Strat take on the First Folio is only circumstantial evidence...and
the grave site in Stratford is much worse given the ludicrous contradictory
physical lay out which leaves the question of his actual burial site...the
anonymous floor grave or inside the church wall near the bust...unresolved.
Far too many problems...more than enough for legitimate suspicions and
skepticism.

The Stratfordian absence of a smoking gun document leads directly to the
skepticism especially since there are so many other gaps about his life in
crucial areas which we would not expect of a person of his magnitude, the
popularity of his works and name. The Strats have a pair of deuces...which is
something...but far from a royal flush.

Setting aside alternative candidates, even Nelson over dinner with Ron
Hess and me in Janaury 2000 remarked that the Stratford man is &quot;a tough sell&quot;.
Nothing has changed that situation, not even this Roscius business. Nelson and
others are still free to tear away at the case for alternative Bards but that
enterprise is far from proving/showing irrefutable evidence in favor of the
Stratford man. The new bottom line following Altrocchi's spotlight on Camden,
is that the pattern of deliberate exclusion/omission by Camden, Drayton and
Peacham ...and others (including Dr. John Hall)...especially taken
together...categorically wipe out the Stratford man.

The truth is that the linkages which the Stratfordians have made between the
Stratford man are presumptions...perhaps reasonable presumptions...but they are
not incontrovertible facts. A smoking gun document would be a letter in his
hand-writing to an assistant in London indicating that he is mailing from
Stratford on Avon a draft of Othello to be given to Ben Jonson for his
editorial review. Something like that. That would be a smoking gun document.

The Strats do not have anything remotely like that. They have six crude
signatures...with perhaps half or more of them being questioned by the expert
(Jane Cox?) at the Public Record Office for various good reasons. The Strats
have a circumstantial case...not a strong one but with the weight of
tradition...but tradition is not necessarily fact or truth.

Such disgrace as Peter Dickson may have brought on the name 'Homo

it by any number of world leaders of the century just past. If the name

I would not characterize the Stratfordian case as dependent on
&quot;circumstantial evidence.&quot; Their evidence is real and solid and, if
this were a general case, should be sufficient. Their problems are
twofold, IMO: 1/ the lack of corroborating personal attestations (as
Price and Dooley point out), and 2/ a biography that is so foreign to
the works as to contradict the assertion that the Stratford man wrote
them. Thus in the second case, Stratford affirmers must become, in
effect, Shakespeare-deniers: they must deny that the real Shakespeare
needed or shows much education or extensive knowledge or experience in
court life; that his family was literate enough; etc -- all in seeming
contradiction to the works. Because they are wedded to their
evidence, they bend the biography to accommodate their candidate
regardless of his spots -- regardless of the attributes and history
the real author must have.

Re a &quot;smoking gun&quot;: the existence of a &quot;smoking gun&quot; alone would be
insufficient to prove a case. People can be fooled, then as now;
evidence can be altered. What matters is finding a man and artist
that is of a piece -- not one we create because we want one, but one
that truly exists.

extreme case, which fairly comes under it. Suppose I find two

children, and then walk away, leaving the other to drown. Clearly
I have 'done good', in saving a child's life? But--Again, supposing

I understand that, but unfortunately the argument from incredulity is

I agree; but the phrase &quot;God created man as an 'animal rationale'&quot;

(How many William Shakespeares, how many Stratfords, you can't base

I assume you accept than that there is evidence linking the author
Shakespeare to a Stratford.

The problem with your argument is that it implies that there is
another Stratford where a &quot;W Shakespeare&quot; was buried around 1616. If
this was the case we would expect at least one of the locals over the

I assume you're familiar with the Shakespearan scholar and chess
player Howard Staunton. He was regarded as the best chess player of
his generation and played internationally. He also wrote for the
Illustrated London Times and started the worlds first Chess magazine.
His publications on Shakespeare were sold around the world.

What do we know about his early life: zilch, virtually nothing. We
don't know who his parents were, we don't know if or where he went to
school. Apparently he was an Shakespearean actor in his younger life
however we have no evidence of this except a single statement.

Basically we know nothing prior to his appearance on the London chess
scene.

Story sound familiar ?

Yet no-one doubts the identity of Staunton. The lack of evidence
cannot in itself be evidence, unless you can show by comparing it to
the evidence of others of the same period that particular pieces of
evidence are missing.

However there is a test which you could use to provide evidence for
your theory. In a parish church yard in Fredericksburg, Virginia
there is an early 17th century gravestone marked,

&quot;a pall-bearer at the funeral of William Shakespeare&quot;

Now given that this was deemed to be the most important event in the
mans life, it would be a fairly good bet that it was _the_ William
Shakespeare that was referred to. If you accept this, all you have to
do is to find out who that person was and where he was in 1616

lecolin: &gt; I would not characterize the Stratfordian case as
dependent on &quot;circumstantial evidence.&quot; Their evidence is real and
solid and, if this were a general case, should be sufficient. Their
problems are twofold, IMO: 1/ the lack of corroborating personal
attestations (as Price and Dooley point out),

Nathan: What is your point here? Are you denying that the works were
attributed to William Shakespeare in his lifetime? The works were
certainly attributed to an author named William Shakespeare in the
lifetime of the man from Stratford. We know for certain that there
was a man named William Shakespeare who was a member of the King's Men
at this time. William Shakespeare is named as a member in the royal
charter. Now, if the plays are attributed to an author named William
Shakespear, and there is a member of the company named William
Shakespeare, absent any evidence to the contrary, wouldn't you agree
the plays are being attributed to the member of the company with the
same name? We also have evidence that the William Shakespeare of
Stratford was the member of the King's Men. We know that Shakespeare
of Stratford left money in his will to other members of the Company,
that one of hte members of the company was a co-signer in the
acquistion of the Gatehouse property, and that there was a complaint
about Shakespeare the player getting the coat of arms that was given
to Shakespeare of Stratford, and we know that the first folio refers
to Stratford and Avon in connection with Shakespeare.

Nathan: So, unless you want to deny, ABSENT ANY EVIDENCE TO THE
CONTRARY, that Shakespeare of Stratford was not the actor who was a
mamber of the King's Men, you have to admit the works were attributed
to Shakespeare of Stratford.

Nathan: You can claim, as Price does, that these claims don't count
because they were not made during Shakespeare's lifetime, that these
attributions don't count. But how logical is that? You have to
believe that all the theater-goers with a basic interest in theater
thought Shakespeare of Stratford was the author, but EVERYONE who
really knew Shakespeare knew he wasn't the author, but never dared to
reveal it bacause of some all-powerful conspiracy, which left no
evidence of its existence. How much sense does that make?

lecolin: and 2/ a biography that is so foreign to the works as to
contradict the assertion that the Stratford man wrote them.

Nathan: Nonsense. What about the biography is so foreign to the
works? Do you believe that Mark Twain wrote &quot;The Prince and the
Pauper.&quot; I'm no expert on the Tudor era, but to my ear, &quot;The Prince
and the Pauper&quot; sounds as real as any of Shakespeare's plays. In
fact, it sounds more real because the characters in &quot;The Prince and
the Pauper&quot; don't go around talking in iambic pentameter? (Or are you
like Paul Streitz, who believes members of Elizabeth's court actually
did try to speak in blank verse?) If you believe that &quot;The Prince
and the Pauper&quot; was written by Mark Twain (or Samuel Clemmens, if you
prefer), why can't you believe Shakespeare of Stratford wrote the
plays attributed to him?

lecolin: &gt;Thus in the second case, Stratford affirmers must become,
in
effect, Shakespeare-deniers: they must deny that the real Shakespeare
needed or shows much education or extensive knowledge

Nathan: Nonsense. You seem to believe the only way to learn anything
is with a university education. You don't believe it is possible for
someone to become self-educated. That's narrow-minded, elitist and
ignorant.

lecolin: &gt;or experience in court life; that his family was literate
enough; etc -- all in seeming contradiction to the works.

Nathan: I don't believe Shakespeare had to be a member of the court
to write his works any more than I believe Mark Twain had to be a
member of Tudor royalty to write &quot;The Prince and the Pauper.&quot;
However, although he wasn't a member of the royal court, it's clear
Shakespeare observed members of the court. Or don't you understand
what &quot;KING'S MEN&quot; means?

lecolin: &gt;Because they are wedded to their evidence, they bend the
biography to accommodate their candidate regardless of his spots --
regardless of the attributes and history the real author must have.

Nathan: I have no trouble reconciling William Shakespeare of
Stratford, member of the King's Men, with the works of William
Shakespeare. What I can't do - what no one can do, is reconsile the
fantasy figure of the illiterate bumpkin William Shakespeare, made up
whole cloth by anti-Strats, with the works.

lecolin: &gt; Re a &quot;smoking gun&quot;: the existence of a &quot;smoking gun&quot;
alone would be
insufficient to prove a case.

Nathan: Apparently, you are ignorant of the meaning of the term
&quot;smoking gun.&quot;

lecolin: &gt;People can be fooled, then as now; evidence can be
altered.

Nathan: But it is illogical to assume evidence has been altered in
the absence of any evidence that it has been altered.

lecolin: &gt;What matters is finding a man and artist that is of a piece
-- not one we create because we want one, but one that truly exists.

Nathan: It is the anti-Strats who have created a completely
fictitious version of a bumpkin named William Shakespeare because they
want to do so. The bumpkin never existed.

Ophelia is a fictional inhabitant of a fictional world that shows

It's possible that the world was created by God with an eye towards our

Shakespeare's plays. In both cases, though, all the evidence discovered

Imran writes, speaking of Staunton:

&quot;Basically we know nothing prior to his appearance on the London chess
scene. '

The difficulty with this is that we know nothing about Shakespeare's
appearance on the London literary scene at all. People knew Staunton,
played chess with him, and he was in the company of the clubs, etc.
There's nothing at all of this for Shakespeare, he is a man without a
literary context.

&gt; an argument on intuition, you need statistical evidence)

&gt; I assume you accept than that there is evidence linking the author
&gt; Shakespeare to a Stratford.

&gt; The problem with your argument is that it implies that there is
&gt; another Stratford where a &quot;W Shakespeare&quot; was buried around 1616. If
&gt; this was the case we would expect at least one of the locals over the
&gt; last 400 years to have bought it to the attention of the wider
&gt; community.

&gt;&gt;and the &quot;i&quot; in moniments...later in 1632 with the Second Folio changed to &quot;u&quot;s
&gt;&gt;as in &quot;monument&quot;. Jonson in 1623 is definitely in his poem referring to a body
&gt;&gt;of literary works as close examination of his words easily shows.

&gt; However L Digges use of the word can clearly be read otherwise,

&gt;&quot;Thy Tombe, thy name must when that stone is rent,
&gt; And Time dissolues thy Stratford Moniment,
&gt; Here we aliue shall view thee still. This Booke,
&gt; When Brasse and Marble fade, shall make thee looke
&gt; Fresh to all Age&quot;

&gt;&gt; The Stratfordian absence of a smoking gun document leads directly to the
&gt;&gt;skepticism especially since there are so many other gaps about his life in
&gt;&gt;crucial areas which we would not expect of a person of his magnitude, the
&gt;&gt;popularity of his works and name.

&gt; I assume you're familiar with the Shakespearan scholar and chess
&gt; player Howard Staunton. He was regarded as the best chess player of
&gt; his generation and played internationally. He also wrote for the
&gt; Illustrated London Times and started the worlds first Chess magazine.
&gt; His publications on Shakespeare were sold around the world.

&gt; What do we know about his early life: zilch, virtually nothing. We
&gt; don't know who his parents were, we don't know if or where he went to
&gt; school. Apparently he was an Shakespearean actor in his younger life
&gt; however we have no evidence of this except a single statement.

&gt; Basically we know nothing prior to his appearance on the London chess
&gt; scene.

&gt; Story sound familiar ?

&gt; Yet no-one doubts the identity of Staunton. The lack of evidence
&gt; cannot in itself be evidence, unless you can show by comparing it to
&gt; the evidence of others of the same period that particular pieces of
&gt; evidence are missing.

&gt; However there is a test which you could use to provide evidence for
&gt; your theory. In a parish church yard in Fredericksburg, Virginia
&gt; there is an early 17th century gravestone marked,

&gt;&quot;a pall-bearer at the funeral of William Shakespeare&quot;

&gt; Now given that this was deemed to be the most important event in the
&gt; mans life, it would be a fairly good bet that it was _the_ William
&gt; Shakespeare that was referred to. If you accept this, all you have to
&gt; do is to find out who that person was and where he was in 1616

That's what the arrangement was all about! Shakspere, whose name was
peculiarized with a different spelling in publication (much as Jonson,
Hawthorne and Faulkner did with their names), acted as a front and
buffer for Oxford, Derby, and their gentlemen secretaries. In the
beginning, the arrangement was all Oxford's. He was struck by the name
of Shakspere being hollered in the streets outside the theaters by the
young crew of horse-minders. It resonated with him because of how
Harvey had once characterized him in the presence of the Queen: he had
the will to shake spears, indeed. Oxford wished to go further with his
poetry and plays, but wanted to test the waters first. Maybe he sent
Lyly or some other friend to this huckster on the make to see how
amenable he would be. This 20-something Warwickshireman was keen to
make a name for himself (as it were). And, he even knew an old
acquaintance from back home who might go in for publishing those long
poems. But didn't Good Will want more from the theater life in London?
Didn't he want a piece of the action in the companies? It would be a
good place to put those hard-earned pence and pounds he had made on
the scene. So, why not? He buys in and he starts to supply the company
with some older plays that had been revised and patched up. They can
see it's good work: who cares for now how he comes by them?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; We also have evidence that the William Shakespeare of

Hasn't anyone ever taught Toby Petzold that there is a difference
between reality and fantasy? He seems completely unaware of the fact
that just because he can make up a story that pleases him, that does
not make his fantasy fact.

In the past, he has often said that Shakespeare of Stratford can't be
the author of the works because the story of Shakespeare the author
isn't aesthetically pleasing to Toby.

He has also criticized Stratfordians, because when many Stratfordians
have a theory for what may have happened, but don't have evidence that
it acutally happened, the Stratfordians acknowledge their theory is
only a theory. To Petzold, that smacks of cowardice.

In Petzold's lunatic world, if you like a theory, you must lable it
fact.

Petzold is, apparently, antoher example of the fact that many
anti-Strats are mentally ill.

See his post below for more examples of his mental illness:

&gt;&gt; lecolin: &gt; I would not characterize the Stratfordian case as
&gt;&gt; dependent on &quot;circumstantial evidence.&quot; Their evidence is real and
&gt;&gt; solid and, if this were a general case, should be sufficient. Their
&gt;&gt; problems are twofold, IMO: 1/ the lack of corroborating personal
&gt;&gt; attestations (as Price and Dooley point out),

&gt;&gt; Nathan: What is your point here? Are you denying that the works were
&gt;&gt; attributed to William Shakespeare in his lifetime?

"/>

Of course not. But the lack of personal evidence is surprising. Yes,
the attribution to S. was made. But consider: if you read a book by
John Doe and were quite impressed, you might write about how
impressive this writer John Doe is, etc. It does not mean that there
was a writer John Doe (though someone penned the works), and while the
attribution alone is usually reliable, it may be misleading to later
people if they take it as evidence that John Doe the writer really did
exist or that the writer and John Doe were necessarily the same
person. Someone finding your letter in the distant future could not
with assurance conclude that John Doe did indeed write the book.

What we're missing in the Stratford case is personal evidence: that
shows knowledge of the MAN to the works, not simply the name -- or
simply awareness of this intellectually powerful man, never mind the
works. With all the evidence about him that exists, it's as if the
MAN -- the man who was artist, writer, philosopher -- never existed.
But some great works were attached to a name.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; You're right. They were. Doesn't make them his, though.

&gt;&gt; The works were
&gt;&gt; certainly attributed to an author named William Shakespeare in the
&gt;&gt; lifetime of the man from Stratford.

&gt; That's right.

&gt;&gt; We know for certain that there
&gt;&gt; was a man named William Shakespeare who was a member of the King's Men
&gt;&gt; at this time.

&gt; You're batting a 1.000, Richard!

&gt;&gt; William Shakespeare is named as a member in the royal

&gt; Sure.

&gt;&gt; Now, if the plays are attributed to an author named William
&gt;&gt; Shakespear, and there is a member of the company named William
&gt;&gt; Shakespeare, absent any evidence to the contrary, wouldn't you agree
&gt;&gt; the plays are being attributed to the member of the company with the
&gt;&gt; same name?

&gt; That's what the arrangement was all about! Shakspere, whose name was

&gt; Harvey had once characterized him in the presence of the Queen: he had

True. While Price has shown that there were close to ten pieces of
certainly personal evidence for all the other playwrights of
Shakespeare's time combined, there are only five or six pieces of
certainly personal evidence for Shakespeare. (His dedications,
Jonson's testimony, Heminges and Condell's testimony.)

A very nice job,Toby and Le.I append very early contemporary
evidence that the bumpkin who was ,sometimes, put forth and who
,sometimes, put himself forth as the author and/or reviser of works
emanating from aristocratic milieu really existed.The only question is
,do we identify him(or them) with William Shakspere of Stratford. Two
such works which purported to issue respectively from a bumpkin
(according to Robert Greene) and &quot;some felon&quot; (according to Sir George

to William Shakespeare(as he certainly was by then) of Stratford.

&gt;&gt; that just because he can make up a story that pleases him, that does
&gt;&gt; not make his fantasy fact.

&gt; Dude, you're such a fucking drag. I give you pretty pictures and what
&gt; do I get in return? Charges of mental illness? Don't blame me just
&gt; because your imagination has failed you so utterly.

&gt;&gt; In the past, he has often said that Shakespeare of Stratford can't be
&gt;&gt; the author of the works because the story of Shakespeare the author
&gt;&gt; isn't aesthetically pleasing to Toby.

&gt; Preposterous. Shakspere of Stratford is History's most Dehydrated Man.
&gt; You and all your waterboys, with your leaky pails, make me laugh.

&gt;&gt; He has also criticized Stratfordians,

&gt; B'gosh, b'gorrah!

&gt;&gt; because when many Stratfordians
&gt;&gt; have a theory for what may have happened, but don't have evidence that
&gt;&gt; it acutally happened, the Stratfordians acknowledge their theory is
&gt;&gt; only a theory.

&gt; They do, do they? So, a few muttered and mumbled caveats are all the
&gt; license one needs to slather His Biography with [context] and
&gt; [contemporaneous practice]? You know: the kind that &quot;we have no reason
&gt; not to believe&quot; say something about him? Even though, clearly, he was
&gt; not like other men who wrote for the stage?

&gt;&gt; To Petzold, that smacks of cowardice.

&gt; Sure. Intellectual cowardice.

&gt;&gt; In Petzold's lunatic world, if you like a theory, you must lable it
&gt;&gt; fact.

&gt;&quot;Lunatic world!&quot; What a self-important craphound!

&gt;&gt; Petzold is, apparently, antoher example of the fact that many
&gt;&gt; anti-Strats are mentally ill.

&gt; Your envy is nauseating. Your candidate has no motivation or
&gt; qualifications to do what he is charged with. Too bad for you.

&gt;&gt; See his post below for more examples of his mental illness:

I was just looking over Rowse's biography (Shakespeare the Man) and he
gets right to it. He doesn't even pretend that what he asserts is

Petzold claims I misstated his opinion, but then he goes on to show I
was correct.

There's no point to arguing with someone who thinks it is virtuous to
lie and cowardly to tell the truth.

Let's just say that your interpretation of things is unique. Clearly,
most of my criticisms of Stratfordianism are in response to its
dependence on assumptions, presumptions, and leaps of logic and/or
faith (both circular and terminal). [Shakespeare's] honest biographers
will admit it when they are theorizing, but there is so much of that
to do that it kills the narrative and makes Shakspere even less
interesting than he otherwise might be. So, with some of the
biographers, they just go ahead and dispense with the difficulties and
do their duty to God, Queen, and Country. Give the people what they
want. But, I made it clear that these approaches, too, are crap, and
my mitigating remarks were just as clearly meant to be ironic.

You will call it an abomination to History, but the Anti-Stratfordian
view will come to co-exist with that of the orthodox for the simple
reason that it is the more credible and sympathetic life. A guy like
Prospero, for example, is a hell of a lot more interesting as an
autobiographical glimpse at a disgraced lord of the realm (Oxford)
than he is as the purely fictitious creation of that motiveless,
colorless, and grasping landlord from Stratford. I can SEE Oxford in
Prospero, but Shakspere? Forget about it.

BS.

Here is why Shakespeare is the author of the works attributed to him:

His name on over forty title pages; his monument in Stratford,
which quite clearly states that he is a writer, and compares
his art to Virgil:

IVDICIO PYLIVM, GENIO SOCRATEM, ARTE MARONEM,
TERRA TEGIT, POPVLVS MAERET, OLYMPVS HABET.
(&quot;In judgement a Nestor, in wit a Socrates, in
art a Virgil; the earth buries him, the people
mourn him, Olympus possesses him&quot;)

STAY PASSENGER, WHY GOEST THOV BY SO FAST,
READ IF THOV GANST, WHOM ENVIOVS DEATH HATH PLAST
WITH IN THIS MONVMENT SHAKSPEARE: WITH WHOME,
QVICK NATVRE DIDE WHOSE NAME, DOTH DECK YS TOMBE,
FAR MORE, THEN COST: SIEH ALL, YT HE HATH WRITT,
LEAVES LIVING ART, BVT PAGE, TO SERVE HIS WITT.

(&quot;SIEH&quot; is a typo for &quot;Sith&quot;)

Robert Greene's attack on Shakespeare in Greene's Groatsworth
of Wit (1592), where he paraphrases a play by Shakespeare while
referring to &quot;Shake-scene&quot;, a clear pun on his name; the
Parnassus plays (1598-1601), where Shakespeare is mentioned by name
and Venus and Adonis and Romeo &amp; Juliet are parodied, and
where Shakespeare is said to have &quot;put them [university playwrights]
all down, aye, and Ben Jonson too&quot;; Gabriel Harvey (nlt 1603), who said
&quot;The younger sort takes much delight in Shakespeares Venus, &amp;
Adonis: but his Lucrece, &amp; his tragedie of Hamlet, Prince of
Denmarke, have it in them, to please the wiser sort,&quot; and who
called Shakespeare &quot;one of our florishing metricians;&quot; and
Francis Meres (1598), who said &quot;...so the English tongue is mightily
enriched, and gorgeously invested in rare ornaments and
resplendent abiliments by sir Philip Sidney, Spencer, Daniel,
Drayton, Warner, Shakespeare, Marlow and Chapman....&quot;
[notice that he distinguishes between Marlowe and Shakespeare
and mentions Oxenforde separately in another section as well]
and who also said that Shakespeare was one of England's
&quot;best Lyrick Poets&quot; and &quot;our best for tragedie&quot; and among the
&quot;best Poets for Comedy&quot; and &quot;the most passionate among us
to bewaile and bemoane the perplexities of Love;&quot; and
Francis Beaumont (1608), who said &quot;...here I would let slippe/
(If I had any in mee) schollershippe,/ And from all Learning keepe
these lines as cleere/ as Shakespeare's best are, which our
heires shall heare/ Preachers apte to their auditors to showe/
how farre sometimes a mortall man may goe/ by the dimme
light of Nature...;&quot;

In 1604 appeared Antony Scolloker's &quot;Diaphantus; or, the
Passions of Love.&quot; In his preface, telling us what an epistle
to the reader should be, Scolloker writes: &quot;It should be like
the Never-too-well read Arcadia, where the Prose and verce
(Matters and Words) are like his Mistresses eyes, one still
excelling another and without Co-rivall: or to come home to
the vulgars Element, like Friendly Shakespeare's Tragedies,
where the Commedian rides, when the Tragedian stands on
tip-toe: Faith it should please all, like Prince Hamlet.
It's difficult to see how Scolloker could refer to Shakespeare as
&quot;friendly&quot; unless he knew him personally.

&quot;a letter survives in the hand of Leonard Digges, who in 1613
compared the sonnets of Lope de Vega to those of &quot;our Will Shakespeare&quot;
- notice the use of the familiar &quot;Will&quot; by a close neighbor of Shakespeare's
in both Aldermarston and in London....Leonard Digges was the step-son
(from 1603) of Thomas Russell, a man who was not only a neighbor of
Shakespeare's both in London and in Stratford, but whom Shakespeare
remembered in his will, and indeed appointed one of the two overseers of
his will.&quot;

In addition:

That Jonson was acquainted with Shakespeare
personally is indisputable: Shakespeare's name
appears on the list of players who acted in
&quot;Every Man in His Humour&quot;, and Jonson's
extended comments upon Shakespeare in his
&quot;Timber&quot; (see below) are proof of that: he
says that Shakespeare was &quot;(indeed) honest,
and of an open, and free nature:&quot; and that
he &quot;loved the man&quot;. Jonson, moreover, was
familiar with many of the nobility and gentleman
of his time due to his close associations with
the court of King James, and would certainly
have heard any rumours involving the Earl
of Oxenforde if there had been any related
to playwrighting.
Jonson's comments on his contemporaries were
typically a mix of praise and censure. Here
are some examples from &quot;Conversations with
William Drummond&quot;:

&quot;Samuel Daniel was a good honest man, had no
children: but no poet.&quot;

&quot;That Michael Drayton's Poly-Olbion (if he had
performed what he promised to write, the deeds
of all the worthies) had been excellent: his
long verses pleased him not.&quot;

&quot;He esteemeth John Donne the first poet in the
world, in some things: his verses of the lost
chain he hath by heart; and that passage of
'The Calm', that dust and feathers do not stir,
all was so quiet. Affirmeth Donne to have written
all his best pieces ere he was twenty-five
years old.&quot;

And many more. His comment on Shakespeare in
these conversations is quite typical:

&quot;Shakespeare, in a play, brought in a number of men
saying they had suffered shipwreck in Bohemia, where there
is no sea near by some 100 miles.&quot;

In &quot;Timber: or Discoveries&quot;, Jonson again mixes
criticism with praise:

&quot;De Shakespeare Nostrat

I remember, the players have often
mentioned it as an honour to Shakespeare, that
in his writing (whatsoever he penned) he never
blotted out line. My answer hath been, would
he had blotted a thousand. Which they thought
a malevolent speech. I had not told posterity
this, but for their ignorance, who choose that
circumstance to commend their friend by,
wherein he most faulted. And to justify mine
own candour (for I loved the man, and do honour
his memory - on this side idolatry - as
much as any). He was (indeed) honest, and of
an open, and free nature: had an excellent
fancy; brave notions, and gentle expressions:
wherein he flowed with that facility, that
sometime it was necessary he should be
stopped: sufflaminandus erat; as Augustus said
of Haterius. His wit was in his own power;
would the rule of it had been so too. Many
times he fell into those things, could not escape
laughter: as when he said in the person of
Caesar, one speaking to him; &quot;Caesar, thou
dost me wrong'. He replied: 'Caesar did never
wrong, but with just cause': and such like;
which were ridiculous. But he redeemed his
vices, with his virtues. There was ever more in
him to be praised, than to be pardoned.&quot;

Jonson clearly doesn't feel that the portrait
in the Folio does Shakespeare any justice
as far as portraying his wit, as his little poem
shows:

&quot;This Figure, that thou here seest put,
It was for gentle Shakespeare cut,
Wherein the Graver had a strife
with Nature, to out-doo the life :
O, could he but have drawne his wit
As well in brasse, as he hath hit
His face ; the Print would then surpasse
All, that was ever writ in brasse.
But, since he cannot, Reader, looke
Not on his Picture, but his Booke.&quot;

And finally, Jonson's masterful eulogy
for Shakespeare, where he seems to be
quite convinced that the man who acted in
his plays was a better playwright than
Marlowe, and worthy of Euripides and
Sophocles. Notice that he calls Shakespeare
the &quot;sweet swan of Avon&quot;, not the &quot;tempestuous
tin-miner of tuxbury&quot; or some such:

&quot;TO THE MEMORY OF MY BELOVED THE AUTHOR,
MR. WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE, AND WHAT HE
HATH LEFT US.

To draw no envy, Shakespeare, on thy name,
Am I thus ample to thy book and fame;
While I confess thy writings to be such
As neither man nor muse can praise too much;
'Tis true, and all men's suffrage. But these ways
Were not the paths I meant unto thy praise;
For seeliest ignorance on these may light,
Which, when it sounds at best, but echoes right;
Or blind affection, which doth ne'er advance
The truth, but gropes, and urgeth all by chance;
Or crafty malice might pretend this praise,
And think to ruin, where it seem'd to raise.
These are, as some infamous bawd or whore
Should praise a matron; what could hurt her more?
But thou art proof against them, and indeed,
Above th' ill fortune of them, or the need.
I therefore will begin. Soul of the age!
The applause, delight, the wonder of our stage!
My Shakespeare, rise! I will not lodge thee by
Chaucer, or Spenser, or bid Beaumont lie
A little further, to make thee a room:
Thou art a monument without a tomb,
And art alive still while thy book doth live
And we have wits to read and praise to give.
That I not mix thee so, my brain excuses,
I mean with great, but disproportion'd Muses,
For if I thought my judgment were of years,
I should commit thee surely with thy peers,
And tell how far thou didst our Lyly outshine,
Or sporting Kyd, or Marlowe's mighty line.
And though thou hadst small Latin and less Greek,
From thence to honour thee, I would not seek
For names; but call forth thund'ring Aeschylus,
Euripides and Sophocles to us;
Pacuvius, Accius, him of Cordova dead,
To life again, to hear thy buskin tread,
And shake a stage; or, when thy socks were on,
Leave thee alone for the comparison
Of all that insolent Greece or haughty Rome
Sent forth, or since did from their ashes come.
Triumph, my Britain, thou hast one to show
To whom all scenes of Europe homage owe.
He was not of an age but for all time!
And all the Muses still were in their prime,
When, like Apollo, he came forth to warm ...

This hatred of the artist is typical of Shakespeare-deniers. The
assumption that Shakespeare, if from Stratford, would not have had
every great artist's motive to create works of depth and beauty, is
preposterous--or that he DID have that motive, but that it doesn't
count as a serious motive besides the motives the Crowleys of the
world want to force on him, such as inventing democracy. And what is
colorless about Will Shakespeare--deer-stealer, early marrier,
probable adulterer, actor, playhouse-dismantler,
countryboy-making-good and . . . poet?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I can SEE Oxford in Prospero, but Shakspere? Forget about it.

Well, some of us prefer the dull truth, such as the fact that
America's greatest lyric poet, Wallace Stevens, was an insurance
executive, to glitzy fantasies. But if you prefer yow to sanity, why
not accept my theory that Chaucer was the true author? Certainly the
idea of a two-hundred-year-old man coming out of retirement to dazzle
the multitudes with his poetry while concealing his Great Secret for
fear of being taken as a witch is more exciting than the Oxfordian
fantasy. And, just as you wacks can enhance your tale by making
Oxford Marlowe and Brooke, I can make Chaucer Roger Bacon--or an alien
from another galaxy. Why do it halfway?

&gt; to the reader should be, Scolloker writes: &quot;It should be like
&gt; the Never-too-well read Arcadia, where the Prose and verce
&gt; (Matters and Words) are like his Mistresses eyes, one still
&gt; excelling another and without Co-rivall: or to come home to
&gt; the vulgars Element, like Friendly Shakespeare's Tragedies,
&gt; where the Commedian rides, when the Tragedian stands on
&gt; tip-toe: Faith it should please all, like Prince Hamlet.
&gt; It's difficult to see how Scolloker could refer to Shakespeare as
&gt;&quot;friendly&quot; unless he knew him personally.

&gt; http://socrates.berkeley.edu/~ahnelson/price.html:
&gt;&quot;a letter survives in the hand of Leonard Digges, who in 1613
&gt; compared the sonnets of Lope de Vega to those of &quot;our Will Shakespeare&quot;
&gt; - notice the use of the familiar &quot;Will&quot; by a close neighbor of Shakespeare's
&gt; in both Aldermarston and in London....Leonard Digges was the step-son
&gt; (from 1603) of Thomas Russell, a man who was not only a neighbor of
&gt; Shakespeare's both in London and in Stratford, but whom Shakespeare
&gt; remembered in his will, and indeed appointed one of the two overseers of
&gt; his will.&quot;

&gt; In addition:

&gt; That Jonson was acquainted with Shakespeare
&gt; personally is indisputable: Shakespeare's name
&gt; appears on the list of players who acted in
&gt;&quot;Every Man in His Humour&quot;, and Jonson's
&gt; extended comments upon Shakespeare in his
&gt;&quot;Timber&quot; (see below) are proof of that: he
&gt; says that Shakespeare was &quot;(indeed) honest,
&gt; and of an open, and free nature:&quot; and that
&gt; he &quot;loved the man&quot;. Jonson, moreover, was
&gt; familiar with many of the nobility and gentleman
&gt; of his time due to his close associations with
&gt; the court of King James, and would certainly
&gt; have heard any rumours involving the Earl
&gt; of Oxenforde if there had been any related
&gt; to playwrighting.
&gt; Jonson's comments on his contemporaries were
&gt; typically a mix of praise and censure. Here
&gt; are some examples from &quot;Conversations with
&gt; William Drummond&quot;:

&gt;&quot;Samuel Daniel was a good honest man, had no
&gt; children: but no poet.&quot;

&gt;&quot;That Michael Drayton's Poly-Olbion (if he had
&gt; performed what he promised to write, the deeds
&gt; of all the worthies) had been excellent: his
&gt; long verses pleased him not.&quot;

&gt;&quot;He esteemeth John Donne the first poet in the
&gt; world, in some things: his verses of the lost
&gt; chain he hath by heart; and that passage of
&gt; 'The Calm', that dust and feathers do not stir,
&gt; all was so quiet. Affirmeth Donne to have written
&gt; all his best pieces ere he was twenty-five
&gt; years old.&quot;

&gt; And many more. His comment on Shakespeare in
&gt; these conversations is quite typical:

&gt;&quot;Shakespeare, in a play, brought in a number of men
&gt; saying they had suffered shipwreck in Bohemia, where there
&gt; is no sea near by some 100 miles.&quot;

&gt; In &quot;Timber: or Discoveries&quot;, Jonson again mixes
&gt; criticism with praise:

&gt;&quot;De Shakespeare Nostrat

&gt; I remember, the players have often
&gt; mentioned it as an honour to Shakespeare, that
&gt; in his writing (whatsoever he penned) he never
&gt; blotted out line. My answer hath been, would
&gt; he had blotted a thousand. Which they thought
&gt; a malevolent speech. I had not told posterity
&gt; this, but for their ignorance, who choose that
&gt; circumstance to commend their friend by,
&gt; wherein he most faulted. And to justify mine
&gt; own candour (for I loved the man, and do honour
&gt; his memory - on this side idolatry - as
&gt; much as any). He was (indeed) honest, and of
&gt; an open, and free nature: had an excellent
&gt; fancy; brave notions, and gentle expressions:
&gt; wherein he flowed with that facility, that
&gt; sometime it was necessary he should be
&gt; stopped: sufflaminandus erat; as Augustus said
&gt; of Haterius. His wit was in his own power;
&gt; would the rule of it had been so too. Many
&gt; times he fell into those things, could not escape
&gt; laughter: as when he said in the person of
&gt; Caesar, one speaking to him; &quot;Caesar, thou
&gt; dost me wrong'. He replied: 'Caesar did never
&gt; wrong, but with just cause': and such like;
&gt; which were ridiculous. But he redeemed his
&gt; vices, with his virtues. There was ever more in
&gt; him to be praised, than to be pardoned.&quot;

&gt; Jonson clearly doesn't feel that the portrait
&gt; in the Folio does Shakespeare any justice
&gt; as far as portraying his wit, as his little poem
&gt; shows:

&gt;&quot;This Figure, that thou here seest put,
&gt; It was for gentle Shakespeare cut,
&gt; Wherein the Graver had a strife
&gt; with Nature, to out-doo the life :
&gt; O, could he but have drawne his wit
&gt; As well in brasse, as he hath hit
&gt; His face ; the Print would then surpasse
&gt; All, that was ever writ in brasse.
&gt; But, since he cannot, Reader, looke
&gt; Not on his Picture, but his Booke.&quot;

&gt; And finally, Jonson's masterful eulogy
&gt; for Shakespeare, where he seems to be
&gt; quite convinced that the man who acted in
&gt; his plays was a better playwright than
&gt; Marlowe, and worthy of Euripides and
&gt; Sophocles. Notice that he calls Shakespeare
&gt; the &quot;sweet swan of Avon&quot;, not the &quot;tempestuous
&gt; tin-miner of tuxbury&quot; or some such:

&gt;&quot;TO THE MEMORY OF MY BELOVED THE AUTHOR,
&gt; MR. WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE, AND WHAT HE
&gt; HATH LEFT US.

&gt; To draw no envy, Shakespeare, on thy name,
&gt; Am I thus ample to thy book and fame;
&gt; While I confess thy writings to be such
&gt; As neither man nor muse can praise too much;
&gt; 'Tis true, and all men's suffrage. But these ways
&gt; Were not the paths I meant unto thy praise;
&gt; For seeliest ignorance on these may light,
&gt; Which, when it sounds at best, but echoes right;
&gt; Or blind affection, which doth ne'er advance
&gt; The truth, but gropes, and urgeth all by chance;
&gt; Or crafty malice might pretend this praise,
&gt; And think to ruin, where it seem'd to raise.
&gt; These are, as some infamous bawd or whore
&gt; Should praise a matron; what could hurt her more?
&gt; But thou art proof against them, and indeed,
&gt; Above th' ill fortune of them, or the need.
&gt; I therefore will begin. Soul of the age!
&gt; The applause, delight, the wonder of our stage!
&gt; My Shakespeare, rise! I will not lodge thee by
&gt; Chaucer, or Spenser, or bid Beaumont lie
&gt; A little further, to make thee a room:
&gt; Thou art a monument without a tomb,
&gt; And art alive still while thy book doth live
&gt; And we have wits to read and praise to give.

Richard Kennedy (with typical Richard Kennedy lack of logic) calims no

Richard Kennedy's response is a lie, claiming KQKnave's response needs
repair if it is to be a true report.

It's completely accurate, so Kennedy must imply something is wrong
with it. He can't actually find anything wrong with it.

&gt;&gt; BS.

&gt;&gt; Here is why Shakespeare is the author of the works attributed to him:

&gt;&gt; His name on over forty title pages; his monument in Stratford,
&gt;&gt; which quite clearly states that he is a writer, and compares
&gt;&gt; his art to Virgil:

&gt;&gt; IVDICIO PYLIVM, GENIO SOCRATEM, ARTE MARONEM,
&gt;&gt; TERRA TEGIT, POPVLVS MAERET, OLYMPVS HABET.

&gt;&gt; LEAVES LIVING ART, BVT PAGE, TO SERVE HIS WITT.

&gt;&gt; (&quot;SIEH&quot; is a typo for &quot;Sith&quot;)

&gt;&gt; Robert Greene's attack on Shakespeare in Greene's Groatsworth
&gt;&gt; of Wit (1592), where he paraphrases a play by Shakespeare while
&gt;&gt; referring to &quot;Shake-scene&quot;, a clear pun on his name; the
&gt;&gt; Parnassus plays (1598-1601), where Shakespeare is mentioned by name
&gt;&gt; and Venus and Adonis and Romeo &amp; Juliet are parodied, and
&gt;&gt; where Shakespeare is said to have &quot;put them [university playwrights]
&gt;&gt; all down, aye, and Ben Jonson too&quot;; Gabriel Harvey (nlt 1603), who said
&gt;&gt;&quot;The younger sort takes much delight in Shakespeares Venus, &amp;
&gt;&gt; Adonis: but his Lucrece, &amp; his tragedie of Hamlet, Prince of
&gt;&gt; Denmarke, have it in them, to please the wiser sort,&quot; and who
&gt;&gt; called Shakespeare &quot;one of our florishing metricians;&quot; and
&gt;&gt; Francis Meres (1598), who said &quot;...so the English tongue is mightily
&gt;&gt; enriched, and gorgeously invested in rare ornaments and
&gt;&gt; resplendent abiliments by sir Philip Sidney, Spencer, Daniel,
&gt;&gt; Drayton, Warner, Shakespeare, Marlow and Chapman....&quot;
&gt;&gt; [notice that he distinguishes between Marlowe and Shakespeare
&gt;&gt; and mentions Oxenforde separately in another section as well]
&gt;&gt; and who also said that Shakespeare was one of England's
&gt;&gt;&quot;best Lyrick Poets&quot; and &quot;our best for tragedie&quot; and among the
&gt;&gt;&quot;best Poets for Comedy&quot; and &quot;the most passionate among us
&gt;&gt; to bewaile and bemoane the perplexities of Love;&quot; and
&gt;&gt; Francis Beaumont (1608), who said &quot;...here I would let slippe/
&gt;&gt; (If I had any in mee) schollershippe,/ And from all Learning keepe
&gt;&gt; these lines as cleere/ as Shakespeare's best are, which our
&gt;&gt; heires shall heare/ Preachers apte to their auditors to showe/

Ah, but how would you answer this argument Petzold has repeatedly
made:

1. It would be aesthetically pleasing to know more about the author
of these plays.

2. We don't know much about Shakespeare of Stratford, and what we do
know doesn't give Toby a warm, fuzzy feeling inside.

3. We know more about the Earl of Oxford, who gives Petzold a very

It's been pointed out more than a few times that Shakspere's
documentary record is actually quite full for a man born in small-town
England nearly four and a half centuries ago. None of my English
ancestors from about his time have left nearly so much of themselves
in the record. The problem for you, of course, is that that record is
indicative of a merchant and money-lender who ensconced himself in the
entertainment industry. (Think one part David Sarnoff, two parts Sam
Goldwyn, and three parts Jack Warner ---and don't forget the goddamned

Actually, there are a lot of basic things about Oxford that we don't

will, no exact date of death (or, has that one been solved?), few
surviving letters from his later years, etc. I look forward to
Nelson's book (I'll have to put together the financing on it soon) to
find out more about the guy. But he is definitely one of the
Shakespeare Group, as far as I'm concerned.

Your characterization is completely inaccurate. Carroll includes
everything from John Shakspere's financial records to the absolutely
unsubstantiated assumption that Shakspere had something to do with the
Sir Thomas More manuscript. Moreover, he cannot discern between
personal and impersonal testimony, a point on which I am certain Price
and Dooley took him to school. It is clear that Carroll is not in any
way amenable to correction or retraction. (Witness the death-grip he's
got on Don Foster's attribution of the FE to Shakespeare; it's nothing
short of creepy.)

&gt;&gt; indicative of a merchant and money-lender who ensconced himself in
&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt; entertainment industry. (Think one part David Sarnoff, two parts Sam
&gt;&gt; Goldwyn, and three parts Jack Warner ---and don't forget the
&gt;&gt; goddamned
&gt;&gt; newsreel cameras!)

&gt;&gt; Nathan: You're leaving out all the evidence that William Shakespeare
&gt;&gt; was an actor and a successful playwright. What you're really saying
&gt;&gt; is that if you leave out all of the evidence that Shakespeare was an
&gt;&gt; actor/playwright, then you have no evidence he was an
&gt;&gt; actor/playwright.

&gt; What does being a bit player have to do with writing plays? Do you
&gt; think that's evidence that Shakspere was a playwright?

"/>

How does what you just said relate to Richard's charge? (In point of
fact, acting has something to do with plays, so being an actor is
circumstantial evidence of the authorship of plays. Since he was an
actor in the troupe that put on the plays he's supposed to have
authored, it is pretty good circumstantial evidence of his authorship
of them. His name on them, and the absence of counter-evidence,
clinches it, but only for the sane.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Nathan:&gt;&gt; 3. We know more about the Earl of Oxford, who gives
&gt;&gt; Petzold a very
&gt;&gt; warm fuzzy feeling.

&gt;&gt; Petzold: &gt; Actually, there are a lot of basic things about Oxford that
&gt;&gt; we don't
&gt;&gt; know but MIGHT REASONABLY EXPECT TO on account of his station. No
&gt;&gt; will, no exact date of death (or, has that one been solved?), few
&gt;&gt; surviving letters from his later years, etc. I look forward to
&gt;&gt; Nelson's book (I'll have to put together the financing on it soon) to
&gt;&gt; find out more about the guy. But he is definitely one of the
&gt;&gt; Shakespeare Group, as far as I'm concerned.

&gt;&gt; Nathan: Based on what, other than your warm, fuzzy feelings?

&gt; It is a belief based on a rational search for a plausible explanation.
&gt; There are too many reasons to doubt Shakspere as an author to make his
&gt; candidacy plausible for me.
&gt;&gt; Nathan:&gt;&gt; 4. This is solid evidence Oxford wrote the plays.

&gt;&gt; Nathan (meaning Petzold apparently thinks the warm fuzzy feelings he
&gt;&gt; gets about Oxford, and the lack of warm fuzzy feelings he gets about
&gt;&gt; Shakespeare, is &quot;evidence&quot; as far as Petzold is concerned).

&gt;&gt; Petzold: &gt; There are a lot of extremely interesting pieces of
&gt;&gt; circumstantial
&gt;&gt; evidence suggesting he DID write those plays, as well as the Sonnets.

&gt;&gt; Nathan: Bullshit. There is no evidence whatsoever for Oxford. NONE.

&gt; I disagree.

"/>

So do I. But it depends on one's definition of &quot;evidence.&quot; I think
that Oxford's having been a named writer of at least one play puts him
among the one hundred people of his time and place most likely to have
written Shakespeare's works and so is circumstantial evidence that he
did so. Other candidates have circumstantial evidence on their side
that is better. Shakespeare has hard evidence, though--as well as far
more, and far better, circumstantial evidence on his side.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt; But your pseudo-syllogism is a lot of non sequitur crapola.

There are certainly differences -- but not that
many. It should be possible to find many
roughly comparable societies, where the
literacy rates were similar to Stratford's around
1570 and where the rate of change was also
about the same. In every one of them all
teachers would have vastly preferred their
pupils to come from literate homes as against
illiterate ones. The teacher's prospects of
success would have been far greater with the
former. The pupils from literary homes would
often have gone on to greater things (thereby
boosting the teacher's reputation); those from

I'm sure that, in fact, you've read an enormous
amount about authors' fathers. Glance at any
directory, such as the DNB. In nearly every case,
they will give you an account of the author's

(Remember that 'authors' are not just literary but
includes all those who have written books, etc.,
and covers people like Julius Caesar, Winston
Churchill, Charles De Gaulle, Ulysses S. Grant, etc.).

Most of us around here must have seen thousands
of such accounts. In EVERY case the author at
the TOP of our list -- Shakespeare -- has a father
who is RIGHT AT THE BOTTOM of all those
thousands of fathers.

Doesn't something somewhere in your head start
to ring alarm bells?

Let's say we could create a composite list from all
around here. We might get something like 100,000
authors. Yet still, RIGHT AT THE BOTTOM will

The idea that an author would have illiterate
children is simply quite beyond belief. Only an
utterly rigidnikal Strat could hold on to such

Let's say the odds against that are 1,000,000 to

So work it out -- on_this_issue_alone
the odds against your candidate are

100,000 x 100,000 x 1,000,000

Even a rigidnik like you must have a problem

&gt; know him personally?

"/>

I have no evidence of any personal relationship. Both writers write
about Shakespeare, but not in such a way that would indicate a direct
and personal knowledge. This, of course, will sound needlessly
restrictive to you, but it is a perfectly reasonable objection. If I
review a book written by some author today, it may be possible for me
to write as though I have some insight into his personal life or
psychology, but I may never have met him. And, unless I've seen him
speak on TV or the radio about his book, I may not even know that he
exists or that he didn't have a ghostwriter do the work for him.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; If they MAY have known him personally, why
&gt; discount their testimony entirely?

"/>

Because it's easier than constructing a sliding scale of veracity?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; (If they DID know him personally,
&gt; why COUNT it? After all, they may have been lying or mistaken,
&gt; anyway.)

"/>

But I just said I have no evidence that they DID know Shakespeare
personally.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; If they did not know him personally, why should that make
&gt; their evidence of no value instead of less value?

When you work out the algorithm for this, let me know.

&gt;&gt; Or, to put it another way, how many
&gt;&gt; of Orwell's books would you have to read before you learned his real
&gt;&gt; name? See how magnificently you may understand him and NOT know the
&gt;&gt; truth of his identity?

&gt; I see. Because s small percentage of names on title pages are NOT the
&gt; names of of the books' authors, NO (supposedly) IMPERSONAL EVIDENCE
&gt; COUNTS.

"/>

If you say so.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; (Amusingly enough, it is very probable that Orwell's name on
&gt; his books was personal evidence, since the publishers who put it there
&gt; probably knew Orwell personally.)

"/>

What about a guy who's just reading a book ---or several--- by &quot;George
Orwell&quot;? When that guy goes on to discuss or write about Orwell and
his books, he will be referring to Orwell in terms that may very well
mimic the language of personal acquaintance. It would be difficult to
know for a reader of that guy's review or overview of Orwell whether
there was a personal connection.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt; Also explain what Shakespeare's dedications to his two narrative poems
&gt;&gt;&gt; are if not personal evidence that he wrote those poems.

&gt;&gt; I personally believe that they are inside jokes between an old queen
&gt;&gt; and his boy-toy. Or, do you detect in their language some plausible
&gt;&gt; reference to an intimate relationship between a lord of the realm and
&gt;&gt; a bit actor

&gt; You don't know this.

"/>

I don't know of any other connection between &quot;Shakespeare&quot; and
Southampton ---and certainly none between the earl and Shakspere. In
fact, the latter pairing, with all we know of Elizabethan class
formalities, sounds unlikely, doesn't it?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; with a thing for poetry?

&gt; You haven't told me what they are if not personal evidence. It's not
&gt; relevant, but what I &quot;detect&quot; in their clear language are, in the
&gt; first, a friendly attempt to win the esteem and, probably, patronage
&gt; of a lord by a writer, and, in the second, a strong suggestion that
&gt; the two have now met, and the near-certainty that the lord has very
&gt; much liked the first poem and in some manner rewarded its author for
&gt; it.

"/>

These dedications would make a lot more sense to me if I could say,
from some other source, that Southampton and the poet DID have a
relationship, but there's no evidence of that ---if you accept
Shakspere in that role.

&gt; So do I. But it depends on one's definition of &quot;evidence.&quot; I think
&gt; that Oxford's having been a named writer of at least one play puts him
&gt; among the one hundred people of his time and place most likely to have
&gt; written Shakespeare's works and so is circumstantial evidence that he

See responses below.

Nathan: &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Ah, but how would you answer this argument Petzold
has repeatedly made:

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 1. It would be aesthetically pleasing to know more about the author of these plays.

"/>

Petzold: &gt; I'm not sure I understand what you mean by &quot;aesthetically
pleasing.&quot; Do you mean that it would be phenomenalistically more
consistent (i.e., paint a tidier picture) if we knew more about the
Author? Well, duh.

Nathan: No, half-wit. &quot;Aesthetics&quot; is obviously not the same as
&quot;phenomenalism.&quot; To put it in terms even you should be able to
understand, I meant that you seem to believe that because it would (in
your view) paint a PRETTIER picture, or tell a more PLEASING story, if
Oxford were the author, this to you is evidence that Oxford must be
the author. You seem to believe that there is a God who runs the
entire universe, and all of history, just to please you. Otherwise,
you wouldn't make the arugment that because it would be more
satisfactory to you for Oxford to be the author, this is evidence
Oxford was the author.

Petzold: &gt;I guess the only person to whom that wouldn't matter would
be you since you don't seem to put any stock in the importance of
knowing the artist's biography, which I say is an impoverished view of
things, to say the least.

Nathan: I'm amazed you still don't get it. The fact that it would be
nicer to know more about the author doesn't mean the author must be
someone whom we know more about. Really, only someone who is a fool
or mentally unbalanced or both would make such an argument.

Nathan:&gt;&gt; Your belief that it would be nice if something were true is
evidence that is true is solid evidence your mind is unbalanced.

Petzold: &gt; Sorry. I have a three-read limit on non-sentences before I
move on.

Nathan: Okay, I left out the word it, and some punctuation. How's
this: Your belief that: it would be nice if something were true is
evidence that it is true - is solid evidence your mind is unbalanced.

Nathan: &gt;&gt; It would be nice if the tree in front of my house grew
dollar bills - but that is not evidence the tree does in fact grow
dollar bills.

Petzold: &gt; You must be right.

Nathan: And yet, you obviously believe that because it would be nice
to know more about the author of &quot;Hamlet,&quot; - this means the author of
&quot;Hamlet&quot; must be someone about whom we know a decent amount of
biographical facts. THE FACT THAT SOMETHING MIGHT BE NICE DOES NOT
MAKE IT TRUE!!! Most ten year olds are aware of this fact.

Nathan: &gt;&gt; Your phrase &quot;phenomenalistically more consistent&quot; is
gibberish. Don't use big words if you don't know what they mean.

Petzold: &gt; Are you kidding me? What exactly did you mean by
&quot;aesthetically&quot; in
your original remark? I was trying to figure that one out, but, as
with anything you write, it's like shellacking a turd. Not worth the
effort.

Nathan: Sorry, Toby, but I seriously doubt that &quot;aesthetically&quot; is a
difficult word for most people on this newsgroup.

Nathan: &gt;&gt; 2. We don't know much about Shakespeare of Stratford,
and what we do know doesn't give Toby a warm, fuzzy feeling inside.

Petzold: &gt; It's been pointed out more than a few times that
Shakspere's documentary record is actually quite full for a man born
in small-town England nearly four and a half centuries ago. None of my
English ancestors from about his time have left nearly so much of
themselves in the record. The problem for you, of course, is that that
record is indicative of a merchant and money-lender who ensconced
himself in the entertainment industry. (Think one part David Sarnoff,
two parts Sam Goldwyn, and three parts Jack Warner ---and don't forget
the goddamned newsreel cameras!)

Nathan: &gt;&gt; You're leaving out all the evidence that William
Shakespeare was an actor and a successful playwright. What you're
really saying is that if you leave out all of the evidence that
Shakespeare was an actor/playwright, then you have no evidence he was
an actor/playwright.

Petzold: &gt; What does being a bit player have to do with writing
plays? Do you
think that's evidence that Shakspere was a playwright?

Nathan: First of all, I said &quot;actor/playwright.&quot; Second of all, what
makes you think he was a &quot;bit&quot; player. He seems to have been a
primary member of the King's Men. There are a number of doucment
where only a few members are mentioned, and Shakespeare is one of the
few. I suppose it MIGHT be because he's their hugely successful
playwright - but it certainly isn't evidence he's a BIT player. Plus
there's the fact that his name keeps being mentioned in connection
with all those Shakespearean plays. A sane person can't claim, as you
do, that the record is that of a merchant and moneylender. THE RECORD
IS THAT OF A SUCCESSFUL PLAYWRIGHT! But you leave you that part,
simply because it doesn't please you.

Nathan:&gt;&gt; 3. We know more about the Earl of Oxford, who gives
Petzold a very warm fuzzy feeling.

Petzold: &gt; Actually, there are a lot of basic things about Oxford that
we don't know but MIGHT REASONABLY EXPECT TO on account of his
station. No will, no exact date of death (or, has that one been
solved?), few surviving letters from his later years, etc. I look
forward to Nelson's book (I'll have to put together the financing on
it soon) to find out more about the guy. But he is definitely one of
the Shakespeare Group, as far as I'm concerned.

Nathan: &gt; Based on what, other than your warm, fuzzy feelings?

Petzold: &gt; It is a belief based on a rational search for a plausible
explanation.

Nathan: You obviously don't have the slightest understanding of what
the word &quot;rational&quot; means.

Petzold: &gt;There are too many reasons to doubt Shakspere as an author
to make his candidacy plausible for me.

Nathan: What reasons, besides the fact that he doesn't give you a
warm fuzzy feeling?

As usual, Toby, you find yourself in error again. Our Ever-Posting

thus does not qualify as a philosopher. Our Ever-Posting Poet may be
egocentric - perhaps that's a prerequisite for an artist - but I doubt
many would consider him &quot;ignorant&quot;.

A sane person knows that Shakespeare and I are both lyrical poets
because we both have written lyrical poems, and that I am but he was
not (so far as we know) an essayist because I have but has not not
written essays. We know he was a professional actor, and that I am
not, for similar reasons. We know that I who have written serious
philosophical essays (uncompelled) am a philosopher, Shakespeare, who
never did that, not a philosopher. We know, finally, that you have no
idea what the distinction between an artist and a philosopher is.

I attempted to make a philosophical point, which by itself certainly
does not make me a philosopher--but it's more than Shakespeare, &quot;the

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Nathan: &gt;&gt; 2. We don't know much about Shakespeare of Stratford,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and what we do know doesn't give Toby a warm, fuzzy feeling inside.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Petzold: &gt; It's been pointed out more than a few times that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Shakspere's
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; documentary record is actually quite full for a man born in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; small-town
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; England nearly four and a half centuries ago. None of my English
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ancestors from about his time have left nearly so much of themselves
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in the record. The problem for you, of course, is that that record is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; indicative of a merchant and money-lender who ensconced himself in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; entertainment industry. (Think one part David Sarnoff, two parts Sam
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Goldwyn, and three parts Jack Warner ---and don't forget the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; goddamned
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; newsreel cameras!)

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Nathan: You're leaving out all the evidence that William Shakespeare
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; was an actor and a successful playwright. What you're really saying
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; is that if you leave out all of the evidence that Shakespeare was an
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; actor/playwright, then you have no evidence he was an
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; actor/playwright.

&gt;&gt;&gt; What does being a bit player have to do with writing plays? Do you
&gt;&gt;&gt; think that's evidence that Shakspere was a playwright?

&gt;&gt; How does what you just said relate to Richard's charge? (In point of
&gt;&gt; fact, acting has something to do with plays, so being an actor is
&gt;&gt; circumstantial evidence of the authorship of plays.

&gt; Let's be clear: you're saying that if a person is an actor, it may
&gt; also make him a playwright.

"/>

I'm saying that a person with a background in the theatre, such as
experience acting, is more likely to be a playwright than a person
with no background in the theatre. A person who works in a gas
station is more likely to be a builder of cars than someone who does
not work in a gas station. A person who plays the piano for a living
is more likely to be a composer than a person who plays no musical
instrument. Think about it for a while, Toby. You might understand
the concept eventually.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Since he was an
&gt;&gt; actor in the troupe that put on the plays he's supposed to have
&gt;&gt; authored, it is pretty good circumstantial evidence of his authorship
&gt;&gt; of them. His name on them, and the absence of counter-evidence,
&gt;&gt; clinches it, but only for the sane.

&gt; My theory is much more interesting.

"/>

But my theory that Chaucer wrote the works of Shakespeare is MUCH more
interesting than yours.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; And, besides, Shakspere isn't qualified to have been a poet and playwright.

&gt; See responses below.

&gt; Nathan: &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Ah, but how would you answer this argument Petzold
&gt; has repeatedly made:

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 1. It would be aesthetically pleasing to know more about the author of these plays.

&gt; Petzold: &gt; I'm not sure I understand what you mean by &quot;aesthetically
&gt; pleasing.&quot; Do you mean that it would be phenomenalistically more
&gt; consistent (i.e., paint a tidier picture) if we knew more about the
&gt; Author? Well, duh.

&gt; Nathan: No, half-wit. &quot;Aesthetics&quot; is obviously not the same as
&gt;&quot;phenomenalism.&quot;

"/>

Oh, obviously! Why don't you ratchet it down a bit and use words more
appropriately suited to what must pass for your arguments?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; To put it in terms even you should be able to
&gt; understand, I meant that you seem to believe that because it would (in
&gt; your view) paint a PRETTIER picture, or tell a more PLEASING story, if
&gt; Oxford were the author, this to you is evidence that Oxford must be
&gt; the author.

"/>

Since this is what your understanding of my remarks has devolved to, I
may as well have my fun.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; You seem to believe that there is a God who runs the

No, I'm an atheist. Why would you cook up such a load of nonsense?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Otherwise,
&gt; you wouldn't make the arugment that because it would be more
&gt; satisfactory to you for Oxford to be the author, this is evidence
&gt; Oxford was the author.

"/>

Well, that would certainly be a more popular notion than believing in
a far less qualified and motiveless stand-in as you do. One is almost
tempted to believe that Shakspere is the more aesthetically pleasing
candidate for you on account of his &quot;authentic&quot; want of literary
qualifications. It adds to his mystery, right? The more vacuous he is
as an historical personage, the more artistic weight he can be made to
bear.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Petzold: &gt;I guess the only person to whom that wouldn't matter would
&gt; be you since you don't seem to put any stock in the importance of
&gt; knowing the artist's biography, which I say is an impoverished view of
&gt; things, to say the least.

&gt; Nathan: I'm amazed you still don't get it. The fact that it would be
&gt; nicer to know more about the author doesn't mean the author must be
&gt; someone whom we know more about. Really, only someone who is a fool
&gt; or mentally unbalanced or both would make such an argument.

"/>

Well, the bigger fool is the one who insists on his own &quot;special&quot; kind
of understanding of his opponent for the sake of perpetuating an
argument, as evidenced here in your non-responsive response. I am
clearly pointing out your long-standing denial that an artist's
biography is an important element in appreciating his art. Who would
deny that? It would obviously be desirable to be able to place a work
of art in its proper historical or personal context.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Nathan:&gt;&gt; Your belief that it would be nice if something were true is
&gt; evidence that is true is solid evidence your mind is unbalanced.

&gt; Petzold: &gt; Sorry. I have a three-read limit on non-sentences before I
&gt; move on.

&gt; Nathan: Okay, I left out the word it, and some punctuation. How's

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; Nathan: And yet, you obviously believe that because it would be nice
&gt; to know more about the author of &quot;Hamlet,&quot; - this means the author of
&gt;&quot;Hamlet&quot; must be someone about whom we know a decent amount of
&gt; biographical facts. THE FACT THAT SOMETHING MIGHT BE NICE DOES NOT
&gt; MAKE IT TRUE!!! Most ten year olds are aware of this fact.

my assertion that Shakespeare was a philosopher and that you are an

in this, I will invoke an earlier argument that you made which depends
upon the collective wisdom of the MAJORITY of people. Remember that
pearl? The judgement of the majority approves the position of
Stratfordianism over Anti-Stratfordianism and if more people think
that Bob Grumman's opinions are superior to Toby Petzold's then that
makes Bob's opinions the approved and clear winner. So, enjoy it, Bob.
If any of our mutual friends here would like to vote on this, I'd be
happy to keep the tabs. Come on, folks! Say yea or nay to the
proposition! Was Shakespeare a philosopher or not? And, just like a
Californian goober-natorial election, you get a second say: Is Bob
Grumman an old poser? Cast your ballots on the thread I'll start after
this. Call it &quot;Philosopher or Poser? Cast Your Ballot Here.&quot;

I'm not sure what you're saying here, but it may be that you are
alluding to the very origins of Anti-Stratfordianism itself. All those
traditions and anecdotes? They are vague and blurry because the man
about which they were formed was nothing LIKE the prodigy or poet or
any sort of genius that Shakespeare MUST have been. He was a
dime-a-dozen entrepreneur who wanted out of the straits of a family
life that had come down on him too soon. What's there to say about
him? He took off with a young family behind him to make some money in
the big city. Maybe he was a bit of a jerk and had been running with
the wrong element when he was younger. Here's these fellows Aubrey and
Rowe and Ward and what's there to say about him? DECADES have passed.
Who knows? They get visitors in from time to time who are here to see
Shakspere's tomb. Let 'em at it. (&quot;Didn't he own some theaters down in
London for a while? Must have known some important men.&quot;) Oh, and
didn't he have a problem with the Luces in his younger days? Sure. He
wrote a scandalous ballad about Sir Thomas. No ex post facto reasoning
here! Not a chance! He once killed a calf in his father's shop in high
style? Well, maybe, but weren't the Shaksperes glovers? Who knows?

It's a lot more than that. I'm saying, and have said, that a
