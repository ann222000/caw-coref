Hi all,
For the last week or so, we've been treated to a gentle
tapping on the cedar siding outside our bedroom, usually
around 7:00 AM. When I hear the tapping, I'll rap on the wall
and the bird is gone. I've inspected the siding on the house
and can't find any damage. Woodpecker? Chickadee? I don't know,
but I wish whatever it is would let me sleep a couple more hours.

Chickadee or tufted titmouse cracking open those sunflower seeds.  And they
store them in any cracks in the wood.

You mean at 7AM you're too lazy to get your butt outta bed to check it out
for yourself?  Is THAT what I have to look forward to 389 days from now?

He's probably out shoveling snow, and reaching for some more firewood at

Hey 3Putt,
I don't shovel snow no mo! I do, however, get some firewood out of the pile
on special occasions. I have a snow plow guy who does the driveway, and
my kids check the house in Feb and Mar when we're down at Hilton Head!
We'all are coming back to SC in 2008.

Watch out or you may get what you wished for.  I retired a couple of years
ago, and at times wish I had a 40 hour a week job to go to so I could work
less hours.  It's all fun &quot;work&quot;, but nonetheless, it is WORK.  But, I guess
it's all worth it, because in the end, I get to keep all that I have
created, and not just pass it off to some corporate entity.

As former lead engineer turned full time Mom, getting paid and less work
sounds GREAT. Now to find a job that lets me have the hours I need to be
free to ferry to rinks and such.

It is really great.  I think that I am seeing more birds too, they may
have been around but, I was not here to see them.
