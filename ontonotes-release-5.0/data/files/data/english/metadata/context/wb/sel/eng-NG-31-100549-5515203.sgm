Another winter tire question...frost heaves
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

A couple weeks back, I had posted a question in regards to my 2004 9-3
Aero's tires...in that they were obviously not meant for winter driving.  I
received many good recommendations for winter tires/rims.  Thanks!

However, one other less obvious requirement for winter driving exists....one
that I hadn't really thought of until this weekend.  ...Ability to handle
"frost heaves".  "Frost heaves" are those nasty bumps in the pavement due to
freezing/refreezing.  I ran into many on my trip to northern Maine this
weekend.  My guests and I nearly became nauseated while driving in the
car...feeling every little bump on my 17" rims/low profile P Zeros.

If I were to get 16" rims with higher profile/winter tires would this help
the car to better absorb those frost heaves?  Or better yet, would moving
all the way down to 15" with all-season tires, absorb those bumps even
better (and still maintain good snow/ice driving ability)?

I realize the Aero's springs are a bit tighter as well...I admit, I have few
clues about the mechanics, is there a way to loosen up the springs (ok, this
admittedly defeats the purpose of owning an Aero)?  I'm not sure if this is
something that is even adjustable.  Is this going too far to resolve the
problem?

Please see my reply on your previous thread.

Yes - putting the highest profile tire on you can fit will help greatly
with the frost heaves and pot-holes (which are legend up here - north of
Northern Maine). However, you should be aware that one of the important
things about owning a sports sedan - is that you can and should do what
you can to steer around the obstacles while remaining in your lane - and
slow it on down. Because the very worst ones will be completely invisible
until the last moment.

That's why people from Vermont congenitally drive at 5mph under the speed
limit at all times and their cars last well in excess of the
manufacturer's 10 year agreed best before date.

Going to a tire with more sidewall and more give, will provide a more
comfortable ride on rough roads.  I don't know if you can go down to 15"
rims on you Aero.  You could do what I did to handle winter driving
issues and rough roads.  I  bought a NG900 to drive in the winter. I let
it take the salt and the abuse.  These are inexpensive because no one
wants them as a driving car and if it last 2 years, I got my money's
worth out of it. A good Classic 900 is getting hard to find.  The price
of an older Classic 900 is actually higher than the new NG900.

That's funny, I thought it was because they were all ex-hippy, society
drop-outs, green peace, eco-activists from the 60's and 70's...

Ah - so it's hand tied flies and three legged hip-waders at dawn is it?

Let me know and I'll fire up the boilers on the motor-coach to catch the
carnage.

Hard to find a c900?  Got to

I wouldn't say they are a dime a dozen.  But there are many of them out
there on the market.

The statement was "a C900 is GOOD condition" . . .  The emphasis is on
GOOD. I don't want to spend thousands reconditioning a car.

Getting a c900 in good condition is increasingly more difficult by the
year.  The car is engineered in the 70's.  After my 89 c900 burned to
the ground, by which time I already have a 9k, a 94 cs, I no longer
looked back.  Having driven both the c900 and 9k side by side, I
realize the difference is by one generation.  the c900 is clukier
whilist the 9k is more refined.  I now have three 9k's, all turbo and 5
speed.  Two 94 and one 95.  The one 94 cde I acquired with an automatic
transmission I converted to 5 speed.

Is it only a matter of time I gravitate to 9-5?  I think so.

You can't go below 16" because of the Aero's disc brakes.
My 9-3SS got the sport suspension, and 16" rims with winter tires work
just fine here in wintery Norway.

So they help to absorb/cushion all the winter bump in the road (frost heaves
and pot holes)?
