Consider a universe in which Z bosons were much lighter than in our
universe, thus extending the range of the weak neutral current interaction.
I presume that that would require lowering the energies of lots of other
things as well, like W bosons- can we know right now what the necessary
effects on other particle properties would be?

Ignoring other particle property changes for now...

Any electromagnetic interactions would have a weak-force correction added-
that would change electron orbitals, as well as fusion energy barriers (it
doesn't seem quite right to keep calling them 'Coulomb barriers' when it's
no longer completely a Coulomb force). It would also make neutrinos far more
interactive- intense neutrino radiation would tend to ionize atoms.

If the Z boson were light enough to extend beyond the range of atoms, it
would add an extra macroscopic force overlaying gravity and
electromagnetism, but with exponential dropoff and intermediate strength.
What's that going to do to stellar structure / planetary formation? I would
expect some effects on molecular bonds, as well, but I don't know quite what
that would be.

Taking this to the extreme, if the W bosons have a mass less than that
of the electron, the W- becomes the lightest charged particle, and
electrons spontaneously decay into W- particles.  You get &quot;atoms&quot;
consisting of a nucleus with W- replacing the electrons.  Since W- are

Would the W and Z boson masses be expected to scale linearly?

On that assumption, I decided to work out what the effects would be if the Z
and W boson masses were scaled down by the same amount so that the W boson
was just *barely* heavier than an electron. The W boson is a little more
than 150,000 times the mass of the electron, so scale down the Z boson mass
by 150,000 and you get a mass of ~608 KeV/c^2. Which means the range is
h/(4*pi*(608 KeV/c)) ~= .00162 angstroms. Much less than the radius of a
hydrogen atom.
So, no macroscopic effects yet. Still, neutrinos get a much larger
interaction cross-section, which, I suppose would mean that stars would
radiate less energy directly from the core, and so would expand, fuse
slower, and radiate more electromagnetic energy per unit mass fused.

The increased range of the W bosons mean that electron capture and beta
decay happen much more rapidly, which will greatly reduce the half-lives of
lots of radioactive isotopes. Which means that the CNO cycle proceeds much
faster than in our universe, so stars much bigger than the Sun expand and
burn faster. With that drastic of a change, I wouldn't be too surprised if
there weren't any CNO-cycle stars, and they all blew themselves up.

Hm. Could neutrinos take the place of electrons in chemistry? Without the
ability to emit photons, they would make for a rather wierd version of
chemistry. Allowed energy transitions would be constrained by the need to
change energy by at least the mass of a Z boson- though that might not be
much of a constraint, seeing as how the mass would have to be reduced by a
Very Large Amount to give the weak neutral current sufficient range to hold
neutrinos in orbitals.
Neutrino atoms (convenient shorthand: natoms) would have a mostly-normal
nucleus surrounded by a cloud of W- bosons. Beta decay would be extremely
rapid and, if binding energies are still the same so that electrons are
still the immediate product, would produce a W boson, an electron
antineutrino, and an electron neutrino (and some gamma rays). W capture
would occur in place of electron capture and produce no neutrinos. So, decay
processes no longer ensure that parity is preserved between the nuclear
charge and the number of shell objects.

The limited range of the weak force and the lack of charge shielding by
shell objects means that all natoms would be of about the same size, but
larger nuclei would lead to a larger magnitude of the weak force within the
natomic radius, producing smaller orbitals and allowing more neutrinos to
fit in one natom. If there's no surplus of neutrinos floating about, the
actual number of neutrinos in an outer shell would be pretty much random,
and chemistry would be boring. If there is a surplus, however, it ought to
be possible for a natom to always capture enough neutrinos to fill it out,
and there would be a predictable number of neutrinos in natomic outer
shells, varying with nuclear mass. So chemistry similar to what goes on in
our universe ought to be possible.

Hm. Neutrinos in the ultimate outer limits before you get out of range of
the weak force would probably be weakly bound and move around a lot. Sort of
like conduction bands in metals. That could provide the surplus for filling
in the penultimate shells to participate in chemistry.

Does that sound right?

Here's another option- if W bosons necessarily get lighter along with Z
bosons, reduce lepton masses at the same time. Lighter electrons result in
larger orbitals, but the stronger weak force makes them smaller again. But
with slightly different ratios. Pair production gets easier. If masses
scaled down sufficiently, electron orbital transitions might result in the
release of an electron/positron pair instead of a single photon. There would
be some emission of Z bosons instead of photons as well- how much?

Note that the rate-limiting step of proton-proton fusion is also a
weak process, so all solar fusion would be greatly increased.

Hm. Is this another luminous nebula / brown dwarf universe? Or just one in

You still have a significant coulomb barrier to overcome, so you need
high temperatures and pressures to get fusion.  Thus, you need stars.
Fusion is initiated earlier in the collapse of the star, however, when
it has a larger volume.  Because the star is more spread out, it
requires less pressure to overcome its self-gravitation, and thus
requires less energy, so the rate of fusion is actually lower for a
given mass star than in our universe.  A star of a given mass with
thus be larger in radius, less luminous, and have a lower temperature.
