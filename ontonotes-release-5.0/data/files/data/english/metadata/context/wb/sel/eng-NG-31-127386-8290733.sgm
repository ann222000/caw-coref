First, we'll be generous in favor of the OCT and neoArabian
fabular account of Osma bin Laden and the Nineteen Sheep and assume that
all the mass was *not* ejected off-center as WTC1 collapsed, thus
enabling maximum load vector to proceed downwards in a progressive
series of inelastic collisions (between dynamic upperblocks and
stationary lowerblocks).  Any ejection would *increase* the collapse
time by lowering the ratio of upperblock mass (Mu) to lowerblock mass
(Ml).  We will also assume that the structure is *evenly* weighted
between the individual floors (although we know that thicker and
heavier beams were used as we move towards lower floors, so in reality
the lowerblock will be disproportionately heavier ... another assumption
in favor of the OCT).  Without further ado, let Pu= upperblock momentum;
Pl= lowerblock momentum; and Pcomb= combined mass momentum.

We have the conservation of linear momentum law:
Pu + Pl  =  Pcomb
MuVu + MlVl  = (Mu + Ml) x (Vcomb)
but Ml is stationary, so Vl=0
MuVu = (Mu + Ml) x Vcomb
Vcomb = [Mu/(Mu+Ml)] x Vu

&quot; http://www.advancedphysics.org/forum/showthread.php?t=8328 &quot;

From the above URl we can see that the highest stable floor is
floor 93.  We will now use the OCT minions own arguments against them.
Since they argue that fire weakened the structure at the impact zone and
initated a progressive collapse, we will use floor 93 as the height of
the lowerblock.  In effect, we'll study as our first inelastic
collision, the impact of dynamic upperblock mass [94th floor and above]
upon the stationary lowerblock mass [93rd floor and below].  After this
first inelastic collision, we will have the dynamic mass increased to
Mu+1, which will then fall exactly one floor before impacting the
stationary mass which has been reduced to Ml-1.  The next inelastic
collision event will have dynamic Mu+1 increased to Mu+2, which will
then fall exactly one floor before impacting stationary mass which has
been reduced to Ml-2.  Etc.

Initially, then, we have Mu = (floor 110) - (floor 93) = 17 stories
and Ml = 93 stories

We then get Vcomb = [17/(17+93)] x Vu = (2/11)Vu = (0.15)Vu

-------------------------------------------------------------
**************** take a coffee break ************************
-------------------------------------------------------------

We can see that at the first studied impact point, the instantaneous
velocity of Mu is Vuo; and coming out of this first impact point, the
combined mass, Mcomb=Mu+1, has instantaneous velocity Vcomb=(0.15)Vuo.

Now, WTC1 is some 417 meters high (not counting antenna)
&quot; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Trade_Center &quot;

417meters/110 floors ~ 3.8 meters/floor

So, let's study the two objects that are falling from the height
of floor 93 to the height of floor 92 (exactly one floor).  The first
object is a putative free fall object through air resistance, ObjectA.
The second is the actual collapse object through a series of inelastic
collisions (some 80-90 such collisions, all told), ObjectB.

ObjectA: (free fall upperblock: Mu)
First, we find the incident velocity of ObjectA as it falls from
floor 94 to floor 93 (the first impact point):
Vinc^2  = Vrest^2 + 2gh
=  (0)^2 + 2g(3.8)
= 74.5
Vinc = 8.63 = Vao
Now, we calculate Va', the instantaneous velocity of ObjectA as
it reaches floor 92:
Va'^2 = Vao^2 + 2gh
= 74.5 + 74.5
Va' = 12.2 m/s

ObjectB: (combined mass: Mu+1)
Vb'^2 = Vbo^2 + 2gh
but Vbo = (0.15)(Vao) = (0.15)(8.63) = 1.3
Vb'^2 = (1.3)^2 + 74.5
= 76.2
Vb' = 8.7 m/s

--------------------------------------------------------
******************* tea  break *************************
--------------------------------------------------------

Va' = Vao + gTa
Vb' = Vbo + gTb
Vb' - Va' = Vbo - Vao + g(Tb-Ta)
Tb - Ta = [Vao - ((0.15)Vao) + Vb' - Va']/  g

Tb - Ta = [(0.85)Vao + Vb' - Va']/ 9.8
= [0.85(8.63) + 8.7 - 12.2]/ 9.8
= 0.39 seconds

Therefore, after collapsing through just one floor (93 to 92), ObjectB,
the inelastic collision collapse object, already lags behind ObjectA,
the free fall object, by about 0.4 seconds!

Finally, let's see what happens after one more inelastic collision.

ObjectA: (free fall upperblock: Mu+1)
First, we find the incident velocity of ObjectA as it falls from
floor 93 to floor 92 (the second impact point):
Vinc^2  = Vprev^2 + 2gh
=  (12.2)^2 + 2g(3.8)
= 223
Vinc = 14.9 = Vao
Now, we calculate Va', the instantaneous velocity of ObjectA as
it reaches floor 91:
Va'^2 = Vao^2 + 2gh
= 223 + 74.5
Va' = 17.3 m/s

ObjectB: (combined mass: Mu+2)
First we note that the mass ratio shifts slightly such that
we now have Mu=17+1= 18 stories; Ml=93-1= 92 stories and the
ratio becomes 18/(18+92)= 0.16; Vcomb = (0.16)Vu
Ergo, Vbo = (0.16)Vao

Vb'^2 = Vbo^2 + 2gh
= (0.16Vao)^2 + 74.5
= (0.0256)(14.9)^2  + 74.5
= 80.2
Vb' = 9.0 m/s

Tb -Ta = [Vao - (0.16Vao) + 9.0 - 17.3]/ 9.8
= [0.84(14.9) + 9.0 - 17.3]/ 9.8
= 0.43 seconds

Therefore, the time gap betweemn objects A and B *further* increases by
0.43 seconds!!

----------------------------------------------------------------
*************************** lemonade break *********************
----------------------------------------------------------------

So, after two inelastic collision events (with assumptions
favoring the OCT by keeping the load vector at a maximum) ... we have a
time gap between the fall times of ObjectA and ObjectB of 0.39 + 0.43
or 0.82 seconds.  Of course, the next inelastic collision will increase
this time gap further still, but let's make one final favorable
assumption for the OCT and say that each collision only carries a gap of
0.40 seconds.  And let's take the lower end of the number of the
estimated inelastic collisions (about 80 -90).  So, doing some quick
math, we get 80 (0.40) = 32 seconds.

IOW, we should expect a gap between &quot;free fall; air resistance&quot;
putative ObjectA ... and &quot;fire-initiated fall; lowerblock resistance&quot;
putative ObjectB (with all kinds of favorable assumptions) ... to be a
minimum of 32 seconds.

Pure gravitational fall of an object dropped at a height of 93
floors or (93/110) 417m = 353m is as follows:

h = 0.5gt^2;
t = (2h/ g)^0.5 = (706/9.8)^0.5 ~ 8.5 seconds

Ergo, expected time for collapse of WTC1 (given all favorable conditions
for OCT) as mandated by the LAW OF CONSERVATION OF LINEAR MOMENTUM is
(32 + 8.5) = 40.5 seconds!!

&quot; http://wtc.nist.gov/pubs/factsheets/faqs_8_2006.htm &quot;

-----------------------------beginExcerpt-------------------------
&quot;NIST estimated the elapsed times for the first exterior panels to
strike the ground after the collapse initiated in each of the towers to
be approximately 11 seconds for WTC 1 and approximately 9 seconds for
WTC 2. These elapsed times were based on: (1) precise timing of the
initiation of collapse from video evidence, and (2) ground motion
(seismic) signals recorded at Palisades, N.Y., that also were precisely
time-calibrated for wave transmission times from lower Manhattan (see
NCSTAR 1-5A). &quot;
--------------------------end------------------------------------

NIST's own report has WTC1 collapsing at 11 seconds!  Well, we
can certainly corroborate NIST's determination of the collapse time with
videos of WTC1 collapse and a stopwatch.   The interesting conclusion,
of course, is that &quot;LawOfConservationLinearMomentum&quot; unequivocally
establishes the fire-initiated collapse theory as a load of rubbish.

Something other than fire-initated collapse was at play on 9/11.
The resistance of the stationary lowerblock(s) was removed from the path
of fall so that it could not combine with the falling upperblock(s) and
experience a reduction in the combined velocity(ies).  And the only
known way tp remove the resistance is through high explosives and
cutting charges, i.e. controlled demolition (nonstandard).

No ifs, ands, or buts.  The jig is up.

FWIW, free energy and overunity machines in general go well beyond
Stanley Meyer.  Energy obtained by water-splitting is quite mundane
compared to the larger plums in the pursuit of electrostatic
discharge energy.  And those go back to Edwin Gray's machine and
further back to Tesla, one of the greatest minds in the field of
electromagnetics, pun intended.

&gt; 417meters/110 floors ~ 3.8 meters/floor

&gt; So, let's study the two objects that are falling from the height
&gt; of floor 93 to the height of floor 92 (exactly one floor).  The first
&gt; object is a putative free fall object through air resistance, ObjectA.
&gt; The second is the actual collapse object through a series of inelastic
&gt; collisions (some 80-90 such collisions, all told), ObjectB.

&gt; ObjectA: (free fall upperblock: Mu)
&gt;        First, we find the incident velocity of ObjectA as it falls from
&gt;        floor 94 to floor 93 (the first impact point):
&gt;                Vinc^2  = Vrest^2 + 2gh
&gt;                        =  (0)^2 + 2g(3.8)
&gt;                        = 74.5
&gt;                Vinc = 8.63 = Vao
&gt;        Now, we calculate Va', the instantaneous velocity of ObjectA as
&gt;        it reaches floor 92:
&gt;                Va'^2 = Vao^2 + 2gh
&gt;                      = 74.5 + 74.5
&gt;                Va' = 12.2 m/s

&gt; ObjectB: (combined mass: Mu+1)
&gt;                Vb'^2 = Vbo^2 + 2gh
&gt;                        but Vbo = (0.15)(Vao) = (0.15)(8.63) = 1.3
&gt;                Vb'^2 = (1.3)^2 + 74.5
&gt;                      = 76.2
&gt;                Vb' = 8.7 m/s

&gt; --------------------------------------------------------
&gt; ******************* tea  break *************************
&gt; --------------------------------------------------------

&gt; Va' = Vao + gTa
&gt; Vb' = Vbo + gTb
&gt; Vb' - Va' = Vbo - Vao + g(Tb-Ta)
&gt; Tb - Ta = [Vao - ((0.15)Vao) + Vb' - Va']/  g

&gt; Tb - Ta = [(0.85)Vao + Vb' - Va']/ 9.8
&gt;        = [0.85(8.63) + 8.7 - 12.2]/ 9.8
&gt;        = 0.39 seconds

&gt; Therefore, after collapsing through just one floor (93 to 92), ObjectB,
&gt; the inelastic collision collapse object, already lags behind ObjectA,
&gt; the free fall object, by about 0.4 seconds!

&gt; Finally, let's see what happens after one more inelastic collision.

&gt; ObjectA: (free fall upperblock: Mu+1)
&gt;        First, we find the incident velocity of ObjectA as it falls from
&gt;        floor 93 to floor 92 (the second impact point):
&gt;                Vinc^2  = Vprev^2 + 2gh
&gt;                        =  (12.2)^2 + 2g(3.8)
&gt;                        = 223
&gt;                Vinc = 14.9 = Vao
&gt;        Now, we calculate Va', the instantaneous velocity of ObjectA as
&gt;        it reaches floor 91:
&gt;                Va'^2 = Vao^2 + 2gh
&gt;                      = 223 + 74.5
&gt;                Va' = 17.3 m/s

&gt; ObjectB: (combined mass: Mu+2)
&gt;        First we note that the mass ratio shifts slightly such that
&gt;        we now have Mu=17+1= 18 stories; Ml=93-1= 92 stories and the
&gt;        ratio becomes 18/(18+92)= 0.16; Vcomb = (0.16)Vu
&gt;        Ergo, Vbo = (0.16)Vao

&gt;                Vb'^2 = Vbo^2 + 2gh
&gt;                      = (0.16Vao)^2 + 74.5
&gt;                      = (0.0256)(14.9)^2  + 74.5
&gt;                      = 80.2
&gt;                Vb' = 9.0 m/s

&gt; Tb -Ta = [Vao - (0.16Vao) + 9.0 - 17.3]/ 9.8
&gt;        = [0.84(14.9) + 9.0 - 17.3]/ 9.8
&gt;        = 0.43 seconds

&gt; Therefore, the time gap betweemn objects A and B *further* increases by
&gt; 0.43 seconds!!

&gt; ----------------------------------------------------------------
&gt; *************************** lemonade break *********************
&gt; ----------------------------------------------------------------

&gt;        So, after two inelastic collision events (with assumptions
&gt; favoring the OCT by keeping the load vector at a maximum) ... we have a
&gt; time gap between the fall times of ObjectA and ObjectB of 0.39 + 0.43
&gt; or 0.82 seconds.  Of course, the next inelastic collision will increase
&gt; this time gap further still, but let's make one final favorable
&gt; assumption for the OCT and say that each collision only carries a gap of
&gt; 0.40 seconds.  And let's take the lower end of the number of the
&gt; estimated inelastic collisions (about 80 -90).  So, doing some quick
&gt; math, we get 80 (0.40) = 32 seconds.

&gt;        IOW, we should expect a gap between &quot;free fall; air resistance&quot;
&gt; putative ObjectA ... and &quot;fire-initiated fall; lowerblock resistance&quot;
&gt; putative ObjectB (with all kinds of favorable assumptions) ... to be a
&gt; minimum of 32 seconds.

&gt;        Pure gravitational fall of an object dropped at a height of 93
&gt; floors or (93/110) 417m = 353m is as follows:

&gt;        h = 0.5gt^2;
&gt;        t = (2h/ g)^0.5 = (706/9.8)^0.5 ~ 8.5 seconds

&gt; Ergo, expected time for collapse of WTC1 (given all favorable conditions
&gt; for OCT) as mandated by the LAW OF CONSERVATION OF LINEAR MOMENTUM is
&gt; (32 + 8.5) = 40.5 seconds!!

&gt; &quot; http://wtc.nist.gov/pubs/factsheets/faqs_8_2006.htm &quot;

&gt; -----------------------------beginExcerpt-------------------------
&gt; &quot;NIST estimated the elapsed times for the first exterior panels to
&gt; strike the ground after the collapse initiated in each of the towers to
&gt; be approximately 11 seconds for WTC 1 and approximately 9 seconds for
&gt; WTC 2. These elapsed times were based on: (1) precise timing of the
&gt; initiation of collapse from video evidence, and (2) ground motion
&gt; (seismic) signals recorded at Palisades, N.Y., that also were precisely
&gt; time-calibrated for wave transmission times from lower Manhattan (see
&gt; NCSTAR 1-5A). &quot;
&gt; --------------------------end------------------------------------

&gt;        NIST's own report has WTC1 collapsing at 11 seconds!  Well, we
&gt; can certainly corroborate NIST's determination of the collapse time with
&gt; videos of WTC1 collapse and a stopwatch.   The interesting conclusion,
&gt; of course, is that &quot;LawOfConservationLinearMomentum&quot; unequivocally
&gt; establishes the fire-initiated collapse theory as a load of rubbish.

&gt;        Something other than fire-initated collapse was at play on 9/11.
&gt; The resistance of the stationary lowerblock(s) was removed from the path
&gt; of fall so that it could not combine with the falling upperblock(s) and
&gt; experience a reduction in the combined velocity(ies).  And the only
&gt; known way tp remove the resistance is through high explosives and
&gt; cutting charges, i.e. controlled demolition (nonstandard).

&gt;        No ifs, ands, or buts.  The jig is up.

&gt; &gt; We have the conservation of linear momentum law:

&gt; &gt;        but Ml is stationary, so Vl=0
&gt; &gt; MuVu = (Mu + Ml) x Vcomb
&gt; &gt; Vcomb = [Mu/(Mu+Ml)] x Vu

&gt; &gt; &quot; http://www.advancedphysics.org/forum/showthread.php?t=8328 &quot;

&gt; &gt;        From the above URl we can see that the highest stable floor is
&gt; &gt; floor 93.  We will now use the OCT minions own arguments against them.
&gt; &gt; Since they argue that fire weakened the structure at the impact zone and
&gt; &gt; initated a progressive collapse, we will use floor 93 as the height of
&gt; &gt; the lowerblock.  In effect, we'll study as our first inelastic
&gt; &gt; collision, the impact of dynamic upperblock mass [94th floor and above]
&gt; &gt; upon the stationary lowerblock mass [93rd floor and below].  After this
&gt; &gt; first inelastic collision, we will have the dynamic mass increased to
&gt; &gt; Mu+1, which will then fall exactly one floor before impacting the
&gt; &gt; stationary mass which has been reduced to Ml-1.  The next inelastic
&gt; &gt; collision event will have dynamic Mu+1 increased to Mu+2, which will
&gt; &gt; then fall exactly one floor before impacting stationary mass which has
&gt; &gt; been reduced to Ml-2.  Etc.

&gt; &gt; Initially, then, we have Mu = (floor 110) - (floor 93) = 17 stories
&gt; &gt; and Ml = 93 stories

&gt; &gt; We then get Vcomb = [17/(17+93)] x Vu = (2/11)Vu = (0.15)Vu

&gt; &gt; -------------------------------------------------------------
&gt; &gt; **************** take a coffee break ************************
&gt; &gt; -------------------------------------------------------------

&gt; &gt; We can see that at the first studied impact point, the instantaneous
&gt; &gt; velocity of Mu is Vuo; and coming out of this first impact point, the
&gt; &gt; combined mass, Mcomb=Mu+1, has instantaneous velocity Vcomb=(0.15)Vuo.

&gt; &gt; Now, WTC1 is some 417 meters high (not counting antenna)
&gt; &gt; &quot; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Trade_Center &quot;

&gt; &gt; 417meters/110 floors ~ 3.8 meters/floor

&gt; &gt; So, let's study the two objects that are falling from the height
&gt; &gt; of floor 93 to the height of floor 92 (exactly one floor).  The first
&gt; &gt; object is a putative free fall object through air resistance, ObjectA.
&gt; &gt; The second is the actual collapse object through a series of inelastic
&gt; &gt; collisions (some 80-90 such collisions, all told), ObjectB.

&gt; &gt; ObjectA: (free fall upperblock: Mu)
&gt; &gt;        First, we find the incident velocity of ObjectA as it falls from
&gt; &gt;        floor 94 to floor 93 (the first impact point):
&gt; &gt;                Vinc^2  = Vrest^2 + 2gh
&gt; &gt;                        =  (0)^2 + 2g(3.8)
&gt; &gt;                        = 74.5
&gt; &gt;                Vinc = 8.63 = Vao
&gt; &gt;        Now, we calculate Va', the instantaneous velocity of ObjectA as
&gt; &gt;        it reaches floor 92:
&gt; &gt;                Va'^2 = Vao^2 + 2gh
&gt; &gt;                      = 74.5 + 74.5
&gt; &gt;                Va' = 12.2 m/s

&gt; &gt; ObjectB: (combined mass: Mu+1)
&gt; &gt;                Vb'^2 = Vbo^2 + 2gh
&gt; &gt;                        but Vbo = (0.15)(Vao) = (0.15)(8.63) = 1.3
&gt; &gt;                Vb'^2 = (1.3)^2 + 74.5
&gt; &gt;                      = 76.2
&gt; &gt;                Vb' = 8.7 m/s

&gt; &gt; --------------------------------------------------------
&gt; &gt; ******************* tea  break *************************
&gt; &gt; --------------------------------------------------------

&gt; &gt; Va' = Vao + gTa
&gt; &gt; Vb' = Vbo + gTb
&gt; &gt; Vb' - Va' = Vbo - Vao + g(Tb-Ta)
&gt; &gt; Tb - Ta = [Vao - ((0.15)Vao) + Vb' - Va']/  g

&gt; &gt; Tb - Ta = [(0.85)Vao + Vb' - Va']/ 9.8
&gt; &gt;        = [0.85(8.63) + 8.7 - 12.2]/ 9.8
&gt; &gt;        = 0.39 seconds

&gt; &gt; Therefore, after collapsing through just one floor (93 to 92), ObjectB,
&gt; &gt; the inelastic collision collapse object, already lags behind ObjectA,
&gt; &gt; the free fall object, by about 0.4 seconds!

&gt; &gt; Finally, let's see what happens after one more inelastic collision.

&gt; &gt; ObjectA: (free fall upperblock: Mu+1)
&gt; &gt;        First, we find the incident velocity of ObjectA as it falls from
&gt; &gt;        floor 93 to floor 92 (the second impact point):
&gt; &gt;                Vinc^2  = Vprev^2 + 2gh
&gt; &gt;                        =  (12.2)^2 + 2g(3.8)
&gt; &gt;                        = 223
&gt; &gt;                Vinc = 14.9 = Vao
&gt; &gt;        Now, we calculate Va', the instantaneous velocity of ObjectA as
&gt; &gt;        it reaches floor 91:
&gt; &gt;                Va'^2 = Vao^2 + 2gh
&gt; &gt;                      = 223 + 74.5
&gt; &gt;                Va' = 17.3 m/s

&gt; &gt; ObjectB: (combined mass: Mu+2)
&gt; &gt;        First we note that the mass ratio shifts slightly such that
&gt; &gt;        we now have Mu=17+1= 18 stories; Ml=93-1= 92 stories and the
&gt; &gt;        ratio becomes 18/(18+92)= 0.16; Vcomb = (0.16)Vu
&gt; &gt;        Ergo, Vbo = (0.16)Vao

&gt; &gt;                Vb'^2 = Vbo^2 + 2gh
&gt; &gt;                      = (0.16Vao)^2 + 74.5
&gt; &gt;                      = (0.0256)(14.9)^2  + 74.5
&gt; &gt;                      = 80.2
&gt; &gt;                Vb' = 9.0 m/s

&gt; &gt; Tb -Ta = [Vao - (0.16Vao) + 9.0 - 17.3]/ 9.8
&gt; &gt;        = [0.84(14.9) + 9.0 - 17.3]/ 9.8
&gt; &gt;        = 0.43 seconds

&gt; &gt; Therefore, the time gap betweemn objects A and B *further* increases by
&gt; &gt; 0.43 seconds!!

&gt; &gt; ----------------------------------------------------------------
&gt; &gt; *************************** lemonade break *********************
&gt; &gt; ----------------------------------------------------------------

&gt; &gt;        So, after two inelastic collision events (with assumptions
&gt; &gt; favoring the OCT by keeping the load vector at a maximum) ... we have a
&gt; &gt; time gap between the fall times of ObjectA and ObjectB of 0.39 + 0.43
&gt; &gt; or 0.82 seconds.  Of course, the next inelastic collision will increase
&gt; &gt; this time gap further still, but let's make one final favorable
&gt; &gt; assumption for the OCT and say that each collision only carries a gap of
&gt; &gt; 0.40 seconds.  And let's take the lower end of the number of the
&gt; &gt; estimated inelastic collisions (about 80 -90).  So, doing some quick
&gt; &gt; math, we get 80 (0.40) = 32 seconds.

&gt; &gt;        IOW, we should expect a gap between &quot;free fall; air resistance&quot;
&gt; &gt; putative ObjectA ... and &quot;fire-initiated fall; lowerblock resistance&quot;
&gt; &gt; putative ObjectB (with all kinds of favorable assumptions) ... to be a
&gt; &gt; minimum of 32 seconds.

&gt; &gt;        Pure gravitational fall of an object dropped at a height of 93
&gt; &gt; floors or (93/110) 417m = 353m is as follows:

&gt; &gt;        h = 0.5gt^2;
&gt; &gt;        t = (2h/ g)^0.5 = (706/9.8)^0.5 ~ 8.5 seconds

&gt; &gt; Ergo, expected time for collapse of WTC1 (given all favorable conditions
&gt; &gt; for OCT) as mandated by the LAW OF CONSERVATION OF LINEAR MOMENTUM is
&gt; &gt; (32 + 8.5) = 40.5 seconds!!

&gt; &gt; &quot; http://wtc.nist.gov/pubs/factsheets/faqs_8_2006.htm &quot;

&gt; &gt; -----------------------------beginExcerpt-------------------------
&gt; &gt; &quot;NIST estimated the elapsed times for the first exterior panels to
&gt; &gt; strike the ground after the collapse initiated in each of the towers to
&gt; &gt; be approximately 11 seconds for WTC 1 and approximately 9 seconds for
&gt; &gt; WTC 2. These elapsed times were based on: (1) precise timing of the
&gt; &gt; initiation of collapse from video evidence, and (2) ground motion
&gt; &gt; (seismic) signals recorded at Palisades, N.Y., that also were precisely
&gt; &gt; time-calibrated for wave transmission times from lower Manhattan (see
&gt; &gt; NCSTAR 1-5A). &quot;
&gt; &gt; --------------------------end------------------------------------

&gt; &gt;        NIST's own report has WTC1 collapsing at 11 seconds!  Well, we
&gt; &gt; can certainly corroborate NIST's determination of the collapse time with
&gt; &gt; videos of WTC1 collapse and a stopwatch.   The interesting conclusion,
&gt; &gt; of course, is that &quot;LawOfConservationLinearMomentum&quot; unequivocally
&gt; &gt; establishes the fire-initiated collapse theory as a load of rubbish.

&gt; &gt;        Something other than fire-initated collapse was at play on 9/11.
&gt; &gt; The resistance of the stationary lowerblock(s) was removed from the path
&gt; &gt; of fall so that it could not combine with the falling upperblock(s) and
&gt; &gt; experience a reduction in the combined velocity(ies).  And the only
&gt; &gt; known way tp remove the resistance is through high explosives and
&gt; &gt; cutting charges, i.e. controlled demolition (nonstandard).

&gt; &gt;        No ifs, ands, or buts.  The jig is up.

He's a liar/shill who needs to be exposed ... or an incompetent
who needs to be *decertified* by his profession for not understanding
one of the basic laws of physics.   I think he's competent enough, after
all, each of the towers' was a robust construction that ansorbed and
*withstood* the impact of a high-speed jetliner (even tho' each was
designed with a low-speed jetliner in mind); therefore, Robertson is a
liar/shill who needs to be tried in a court of law for obstruction of
justice.  But here, read about the fraudmeister, Robertson at the URL
below:

Robertson's own words at the above URL:
--------------------beginExcerpt------------------------------
“Leslie Robertson, one of the two original structural engineers for the
World Trade Center, is asked at a conference in Frankfurt, Germany what
he had done to protect the twin towers from terrorist attacks. He
replies, ‘I designed it for a 707 to smash into it,’ though does not
elaborate further.”[6]

[Leslie Robertson:] “The twin towers were in fact the first structures
outside the military and nuclear industries designed to resist the
impact of a jet airplane.”[7]
-------------------end-----------------------------------------

But it really doesn't matter in the larger scheme of things, for
even if the structures had failed *immediately* upon collision (which
they didn't after being respectively impacted by high-speed Boeing
jetliners: again, evidence of robust construction); the fact remains,
they both collapsed at speeds that are prohibited by the law of
conservation of linear momentum.   End of discussion.

Btw, I don't care who was part of the team that designed the
towers (a team, not individuals, keep that in mind).  What impresses
here is not the ability to build such a robust structure - that is
impressive in its own right - but the ability to understand the physics
of the collapse.   I do.  He does.  You don't.  I don't lie about it.
He has chosen to lie about it.  You being the duckwit, are propagating
his lie.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; By the way, where'd you get -your- education?
&gt; -c
">

At at two two universities.   Where'd you get yours ... in K-9?

FWIW, I'm qualified to speak up to 4th-year level in four
different subject areas: math, chemistry, physics, and biochemistry ...
and I would probably not have too much trouble keeping up with the big
boys in biology.   I suppose I could have tried for a Masters or PhD in
any of those four areas ... but my brain craves broad knowledge in many
areas as opposed to intense knowledge in a single area, so I never
bothered.   My natural gifts are in the sciences; my passions are in the
arts.

I'm now happy as a writer and a cartoonist - a simple man living
a simple life with an appreciation for the simpler things in life; and a
fire-breathing dragon when it comes to protecting the hallowed caves of
Truth, Fairness, Liberty, Simplicity, Justice, Decency, Honor ... .

So ... what particular problem do you have with my explanation
of the law of conservation of linear momentum as it applies to the
collapses?   I guess the question I'm asking is this ... do you have the
brains to counter my explanation?   Or the webbed feet to waddle off on?

BSC?  Oregon State university?   You studied physics in 1993 or
took Physics 101 as an elective?  If the former, then I find it
astounding that you still haven't grasped the import of the Law of
Conservation of Linear Momentum.   What were you doing in class,
studying your meal card while the lectures were going on?

Me?  Education??

Dalhousie University (1981-86 ... four disciplines as mentioned
before).

Guelph University (1989).

Prince Andrew High School (1978-1980).  One of ten students in
the province of Nova Scotia (from a pool of about 8000) to be invited to
the Canadian Math Olympiad after having finished 8th in a province wide
math contest.  1 in a 1000?  Well, I prefer to think of myself as one in
a million, but hey ... it's all the same after 1 in a 100.  You'll just
have to take my word for it).  Turned down math scholarship from
University of Alberta because there was a girl that I was crazy about
who was heading for Dalhousie ... well, you know how those things turn
out.

But how is all this relevant?  I posted an explanation *proving*
that the OCT is impossible.  Refute it or waddle off into inconsequence.
Sure, use your Oregon State meal card if you want to ... anything but
the sorry excuse of a rebuttal that you've put up so far.

me.  I preferred knowledge rather than the pursuit of a profession.
Which is why after math/chemistry, I shifted to biochemistry, and then
to physics ... later to computer science at Guelph ... then to the arts.
I'm an independent thinker, not a follower.

And that means I know *more* about the Law of Conservation of
Linear Momentum than any shill/idiot/liar who claims that the OCT is
possible in spite of it.

and a fourth

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; We have the conservation of linear momentum law:

&gt; Since they argue that fire weakened the structure at the impact zone and

&gt; upon the stationary lowerblock mass [93rd floor and below].

And a fifth

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

and another and another.

Free hint to the clueless zook the kook.

The bulding structure below the 93 floor would not act as a singular
mass WRT the falling upper floors.  THe falling mass would have easily
been off center of the columns previously supporting that load, and
still not be &quot;ejected&quot; as you suggest.  The falling structure would only
need to be a mer 18 inches off center for its full force to impact the
floor slab ONLY of the top remaining floor.  Only the mass of that floor
slab would be resisting the falling mass of the tower above.

Your mathematical gymnastics are a lame futile attempt to breathe life
into your failed myth.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Initially, then, we have Mu = (floor 110) - (floor 93) = 17 stories
&gt; and Ml = 93 stories

&gt; We then get Vcomb = [17/(17+93)] x Vu = (2/11)Vu = (0.15)Vu

&gt;&gt;&gt;       Go get yourself a decent physics education, duckwit, and then
&gt;&gt;&gt;maybe you'll bring something to the debate.
&gt;&gt;&gt;       Who's up next?

&gt;&gt;LOL!  Like I said:  &quot;The friggin' architect of the WTC takes responsibility
&gt;&gt;for the  construction and explains how it fails, and the tin-hat brigade
&gt;&gt;still can't  accept it.

&gt;         He's a liar/shill who needs to be exposed ... or an incompetent
&gt; who needs to be *decertified* by his profession for not understanding
&gt; one of the basic laws of physics.   I think he's competent enough, after
&gt; all, each of the towers' was a robust construction that ansorbed and
&gt; *withstood* the impact of a high-speed jetliner (even tho' each was
&gt; designed with a low-speed jetliner in mind); therefore, Robertson is a
&gt; liar/shill who needs to be tried in a court of law for obstruction of
&gt; justice.  But here, read about the fraudmeister, Robertson at the URL
&gt; below:

&gt; &quot; http://www.jonesreport.com/articles/210207_wtc_designers.html &quot;

&gt;&gt;Apparently you think he didn't have a physics education.  The difference
&gt;&gt;between him and you is, he designed the WTC and commented authoritatively
&gt;&gt;and in detail on the cause of their failure.  You're a usenet kook who
&gt;&gt;thinks he understand physics.

&gt;         Robertson's own words at the above URL:
&gt; --------------------beginExcerpt------------------------------
&gt; �Leslie Robertson, one of the two original structural engineers for the
&gt; World Trade Center, is asked at a conference in Frankfurt, Germany what
&gt; he had done to protect the twin towers from terrorist attacks. He
&gt; replies, �I designed it for a 707 to smash into it,� though does not
&gt; elaborate further.�[6]

&gt; [Leslie Robertson:] �The twin towers were in fact the first structures
&gt; outside the military and nuclear industries designed to resist the
&gt; impact of a jet airplane.�[7]
&gt; -------------------end-----------------------------------------

&gt;         But it really doesn't matter in the larger scheme of things, for
&gt; even if the structures had failed *immediately* upon collision (which
&gt; they didn't after being respectively impacted by high-speed Boeing
&gt; jetliners: again, evidence of robust construction); the fact remains,
&gt; they both collapsed at speeds that are prohibited by the law of
&gt; conservation of linear momentum.   End of discussion.

&gt;         Btw, I don't care who was part of the team that designed the
&gt; towers (a team, not individuals, keep that in mind).  What impresses
&gt; here is not the ability to build such a robust structure - that is
&gt; impressive in its own right - but the ability to understand the physics
&gt; of the collapse.   I do.  He does.  You don't.  I don't lie about it.
&gt; He has chosen to lie about it.  You being the duckwit, are propagating
&gt; his lie.

&gt;&gt;By the way, where'd you get -your- education?
&gt;&gt;-c

You cannot even take use the mass on the entire floor level.  Since each
floor plate was essentially a table., i.e sturdy legs, thin top. The
ability of the table to stop the mass has everything to do with where
and how the mass impacts the table.  If it hits squarely, with the force
being distributed across the entire surface, it may resist.  If the mass
hits as point loads within the frame work, the table top with fail

Yes, &quot;failing&quot; is probably a common term in the world that you
come from.   To judge people and be judged based on some artificial
scoring system that has no bearing on the pursuit of real knowledge ...
that ... is your prerogative.  In any event, unlike your ilk, I'm not in
fear of the facts (which, for all intents and purposes, has served me
well in appreciating 9/11 Inside Job truths).

So, some facts about me.  Over the five and half years at
Dalhousie, my transcript accumulated an octet or so of &quot;F&quot;s ... all due
to my truancy in the respective classes and deliberate absence from the
respective final exam halls. Of course, my transcript is also noteworthy
for about a dozen or so &quot;A&quot;s and &quot;A+&quot;s, including some in what many
consider to be the hardest math and chemistry courses at the
undergraduate level.  But that's just me, doing things my way whilst
floating through the various trials and tribulations and arrogances of
youthful life ... yes, of course, with some regret for wasting my
parent's money.

I guess part of the problem was that I could never find a
professor who gave me the feeling that I could learn more from them,
especially significant things, than I could if I'd just went my own way.
I spent a lot of time going through the five floors of the Killam
library reading quite a broad cross-section of books, when perhaps I
could have better spent that time preparing for the morrow's exam or lab
report or what not.  But hey, empty pursuits and paper chases are no
match for great literature by Chekhov, Dickens, Poe, Tolstoy,
Dostoyevsky; or reading about the life and times of the great composers,
the great rulers, the grandmasters of chess, books on astronomy and
cosmology, theoretical physics, the double helix, the pursuit of a grand
unified field theory or TOE as it is perhaps known today ... you know,
stuff that interested me.  This, in marked contrast to my Pavlovian
friends and peers who got caught up in the carrots and the cookies and
the conditioning.   Mind you, no pox on their houses (or mansions or
Mercedes) ... my friends and peers made their own decisions in life and
I'm sure they are blissfully happy.

Anyways, to take a shortcut to Tiperary, while doing my honors
thesis in biochemistry, I did the unthinkable one day and just stopped
going to the lab.  I guess I was fumbling with the decision to end all
pretensions and to find harmony and unity with simple and decent
pursuits; you know, to find the meaning of life where it is rooted - in
the roseplant - as opposed to plucking it for my lapel - a rose bloom
meant to impress others with.  I didn't know it then but it was perhaps
the most healthy decision I have ever made.

I went back to university three years later, at Guelph, but it
was a healthy association this time around, at least while it lasted.
In the only semester I attended there, I made the Dean's list with
straight &quot;A&quot;s.  Then I went back to Dalhousie (to try and exorcise the
ghosts of my past, including memories of the girl I was crazy about).
It didn't work.  Then Switzerland and WWW-technology came along and
rescued me from the abyss.  I'm now happy as a writer and cartoonist,
and a tireless pursuer of truth and justice wherever they exist.

Actually, I made a couple of major assumptions in favor of the
OCT (maximum load vector; progressive thickness of beams), and omitted
several more that would complete shred it (like deformational energies
that would have to be accounted for in the putative momentum transfer
during an inelastic collision, which would effectively *suck* the speed
right out of the system).  You're thinking of classical momentum
transfer only.  If you include the deformational shifts in the various
stories in the lowerblock, that would indicate many stories below the
impact zone that would have *vertically* dispaced (ergo, velocitized)
columns.  These displacements are not visible to the naked eye, but they
must be calculated into the momentum transfer.   I just got back from
reading Gordon Ross's excellent analysis; he estimates that the vertical
deflection effect only extends to about 24 floors below the impact point
.. but here, have a read ... let the expert convince you.

&quot; http://gordonssite.tripod.com/id1.html &quot;

-------------beginExcerpt-----------------------------------------
To estimate and illustrate the further momentum changes we can assume

Keep grasping as straws
Poor old gordon has been debunked.  It is easy to spot his errors.
************************************************************************
Upon impact with the lower section the falling mass would deliver a
force which would grow from zero, up to the failure load of the impacted
storey columns, over a finite period of time and distance.

This force would also be felt by the columns below the storey which was
first impacted.

&quot;The falling upper section with a velocity of no more than 8.5 metres
per second at impact would meet resistance from the impacted columns and
have as its first task the necessity to load these columns through their
elastic range and thereafter through the plastic shortening phase. We
shall firstly examine this incremental time period. &quot;
***********************************************************************
His assumption that the columns were impacted, loaded to failure point
and then collapsed is in error.  That is the process in a true pancake
collapse, not a progressive collapse.  By shifting the falling structure
as little as 18&quot;, the falling mass of the upper block would have only
ipacted the floor plates, the columns of the lower portion would have
only impacted the upper floor plates. The mass to mass resistance is
reduced to almost nothing.

Deformational displacement.  Objects, when they deform, move
from point A to point B in a wee interval of time ... that establishes
the fact of their velocities.  The &quot;24 floors below&quot; objects (e.g. the
vertical columns on the 69 floor, say) would observe less deformation
than objects just one floor below ... the distant objects would have
smaller velocities.  Is there a linear spread of these velocities?
I defer to Gordon's expertise.

Of course, another interesting thing here is, as the collapse
wave proceeds to the bottom (where the thicker beams are), all the lower
floors eventually get conscripted into &quot;deformational&quot; resistance
against the dynamic load, in addition to static resistance.

Btw, the dynamic block simultaneously increases in mass (due to
inelastic combining with the floor immediately beneath) and loses mass
(much of it ejected off-center).  The thicker columns in the lower half
of the structure would pose as additional resistance against the free
fall increases in velocity.

How many people with relevant expertise has Ross been able to agree to
any aspect of his paper? Zero?

....
Mr. Ross, your conclusions and sums and methods have been proven
wrong. In my previous letter I offered you the chance to fix and
update your calculations out of professional courtesy. Out of
respect for your abilities, I said it would be easy for you to do. I
had hoped that you would take a harder look at that issue, and take
another look at the rest of your paper, but you have chosen not to
do so. Your response was nothing more than, .fake but
accurate.. This is a disgusting manner for any engineer to
respond. Sir, retract your paper or fix your calculations.

Ross's response;

http://www.journalof911studies.com/letters/RossResponsetoAnonymous.pdf

And Greening says;

I intend to show that Mr. Ross. article is incorrect in at least
four important ways:

(i) An error in the calculation of the kinetic energy of the `
falling section after the first impact.
(ii) An over-estimation of the energy required to pulverize the
WTC 1 concrete.
(iii) The argument that the initial elastic deflection would
propagate 24 storeys below the impact floor.
(iv) The use of a safety factor of 4 in the calculation of the
elastic strain energy.

&gt;         First, we'll be generous in favor of the OCT and neoArabian
&gt; fabular account of Osma bin Laden and the Nineteen Sheep and assume that
&gt; all the mass was *not* ejected off-center as WTC1 collapsed, thus
&gt; enabling maximum load vector to proceed downwards in a progressive
&gt; series of inelastic collisions (between dynamic upperblocks and
&gt; stationary lowerblocks).  Any ejection would *increase* the collapse
&gt; time by lowering the ratio of upperblock mass (Mu) to lowerblock mass
&gt; (Ml).  We will also assume that the structure is *evenly* weighted
&gt; between the individual floors (although we know that thicker and
&gt; heavier beams were used as we move towards lower floors, so in reality
&gt; the lowerblock will be disproportionately heavier ... another assumption
&gt; in favor of the OCT).  Without further ado, let Pu= upperblock momentum;
&gt; Pl= lowerblock momentum; and Pcomb= combined mass momentum.

&gt; We have the conservation of linear momentum law:
&gt; Pu + Pl  =  Pcomb
&gt; MuVu + MlVl  = (Mu + Ml) x (Vcomb)
&gt;         but Ml is stationary, so Vl=0
&gt; MuVu = (Mu + Ml) x Vcomb
&gt; Vcomb = [Mu/(Mu+Ml)] x Vu

&gt; &quot; http://www.advancedphysics.org/forum/showthread.php?t=8328 &quot;

&gt;         From the above URl we can see that the highest stable floor is
&gt; floor 93.  We will now use the OCT minions own arguments against them.
&gt; Since they argue that fire weakened the structure at the impact zone and
&gt; initated a progressive collapse, we will use floor 93 as the height of
&gt; the lowerblock.  In effect, we'll study as our first inelastic
&gt; collision, the impact of dynamic upperblock mass [94th floor and above]
&gt; upon the stationary lowerblock mass [93rd floor and below].  After this
&gt; first inelastic collision, we will have the dynamic mass increased to
&gt; Mu+1, which will then fall exactly one floor before impacting the
&gt; stationary mass which has been reduced to Ml-1.  The next inelastic
&gt; collision event will have dynamic Mu+1 increased to Mu+2, which will
&gt; then fall exactly one floor before impacting stationary mass which has
&gt; been reduced to Ml-2.  Etc.

&gt; Initially, then, we have Mu = (floor 110) - (floor 93) = 17 stories
&gt; and Ml = 93 stories

&gt; We then get Vcomb = [17/(17+93)] x Vu = (2/11)Vu = (0.15)Vu

&gt; -------------------------------------------------------------
&gt; **************** take a coffee break ************************
&gt; -------------------------------------------------------------

&gt; We can see that at the first studied impact point, the instantaneous
&gt; velocity of Mu is Vuo; and coming out of this first impact point, the
&gt; combined mass, Mcomb=Mu+1, has instantaneous velocity Vcomb=(0.15)Vuo.

&gt; Now, WTC1 is some 417 meters high (not counting antenna)
&gt; &quot; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Trade_Center &quot;

&gt; 417meters/110 floors ~ 3.8 meters/floor

&gt; So, let's study the two objects that are falling from the height
&gt; of floor 93 to the height of floor 92 (exactly one floor).  The first
&gt; object is a putative free fall object through air resistance, ObjectA.
&gt; The second is the actual collapse object through a series of inelastic
&gt; collisions (some 80-90 such collisions, all told), ObjectB.

&gt; ObjectA: (free fall upperblock: Mu)
&gt;         First, we find the incident velocity of ObjectA as it falls from
&gt;         floor 94 to floor 93 (the first impact point):
&gt;                 Vinc^2  = Vrest^2 + 2gh
&gt;                         =  (0)^2 + 2g(3.8)
&gt;                         = 74.5
&gt;                 Vinc = 8.63 = Vao
&gt;         Now, we calculate Va', the instantaneous velocity of ObjectA as
&gt;         it reaches floor 92:
&gt;                 Va'^2 = Vao^2 + 2gh
&gt;                       = 74.5 + 74.5
&gt;                 Va' = 12.2 m/s

&gt; ObjectB: (combined mass: Mu+1)
&gt;                 Vb'^2 = Vbo^2 + 2gh
&gt;                         but Vbo = (0.15)(Vao) = (0.15)(8.63) = 1.3
&gt;                 Vb'^2 = (1.3)^2 + 74.5
&gt;                       = 76.2
&gt;                 Vb' = 8.7 m/s

&gt; --------------------------------------------------------
&gt; ******************* tea  break *************************
&gt; --------------------------------------------------------

&gt; Va' = Vao + gTa
&gt; Vb' = Vbo + gTb
&gt; Vb' - Va' = Vbo - Vao + g(Tb-Ta)
&gt; Tb - Ta = [Vao - ((0.15)Vao) + Vb' - Va']/  g

&gt; Tb - Ta = [(0.85)Vao + Vb' - Va']/ 9.8
&gt;         = [0.85(8.63) + 8.7 - 12.2]/ 9.8
&gt;         = 0.39 seconds

&gt; Therefore, after collapsing through just one floor (93 to 92), ObjectB,
&gt; the inelastic collision collapse object, already lags behind ObjectA,
&gt; the free fall object, by about 0.4 seconds!

&gt; Finally, let's see what happens after one more inelastic collision.

&gt; ObjectA: (free fall upperblock: Mu+1)
&gt;         First, we find the incident velocity of ObjectA as it falls from
&gt;         floor 93 to floor 92 (the second impact point):
&gt;                 Vinc^2  = Vprev^2 + 2gh
&gt;                         =  (12.2)^2 + 2g(3.8)
&gt;                         = 223
&gt;                 Vinc = 14.9 = Vao
&gt;         Now, we calculate Va', the instantaneous velocity of ObjectA as
&gt;         it reaches floor 91:
&gt;                 Va'^2 = Vao^2 + 2gh
&gt;                       = 223 + 74.5
&gt;                 Va' = 17.3 m/s

&gt; ObjectB: (combined mass: Mu+2)
&gt;         First we note that the mass ratio shifts slightly such that
&gt;         we now have Mu=17+1= 18 stories; Ml=93-1= 92 stories and the
&gt;         ratio becomes 18/(18+92)= 0.16; Vcomb = (0.16)Vu
&gt;         Ergo, Vbo = (0.16)Vao

&gt;                 Vb'^2 = Vbo^2 + 2gh
&gt;                       = (0.16Vao)^2 + 74.5
&gt;                       = (0.0256)(14.9)^2  + 74.5
&gt;                       = 80.2
&gt;                 Vb' = 9.0 m/s

&gt; Tb -Ta = [Vao - (0.16Vao) + 9.0 - 17.3]/ 9.8
&gt;         = [0.84(14.9) + 9.0 - 17.3]/ 9.8
&gt;         = 0.43 seconds

&gt; Therefore, the time gap betweemn objects A and B *further* increases by
&gt; 0.43 seconds!!

&gt; ----------------------------------------------------------------
&gt; *************************** lemonade break *********************
&gt; ----------------------------------------------------------------

&gt;         So, after two inelastic collision events (with assumptions
&gt; favoring the OCT by keeping the load vector at a maximum) ... we have a
&gt; time gap between the fall times of ObjectA and ObjectB of 0.39 + 0.43
&gt; or 0.82 seconds.  Of course, the next inelastic collision will increase
&gt; this time gap further still, but let's make one final favorable
&gt; assumption for the OCT and say that each collision only carries a gap of
&gt; 0.40 seconds.  And let's take the lower end of the number of the
&gt; estimated inelastic collisions (about 80 -90).  So, doing some quick
&gt; math, we get 80 (0.40) = 32 seconds.

&gt;         IOW, we should expect a gap between &quot;free fall; air resistance&quot;
&gt; putative ObjectA ... and &quot;fire-initiated fall; lowerblock resistance&quot;
&gt; putative ObjectB (with all kinds of favorable assumptions) ... to be a
&gt; minimum of 32 seconds.

&gt;         Pure gravitational fall of an object dropped at a height of 93
&gt; floors or (93/110) 417m = 353m is as follows:

&gt;         h = 0.5gt^2;
&gt;         t = (2h/ g)^0.5 = (706/9.8)^0.5 ~ 8.5 seconds

&gt; Ergo, expected time for collapse of WTC1 (given all favorable conditions
&gt; for OCT) as mandated by the LAW OF CONSERVATION OF LINEAR MOMENTUM is
&gt; (32 + 8.5) = 40.5 seconds!!

&gt; &quot; http://wtc.nist.gov/pubs/factsheets/faqs_8_2006.htm &quot;

&gt; -----------------------------beginExcerpt-------------------------
&gt; &quot;NIST estimated the elapsed times for the first exterior panels to
&gt; strike the ground after the collapse initiated in each of the towers to
&gt; be approximately 11 seconds for WTC 1 and approximately 9 seconds for
&gt; WTC 2.
....
&gt; --------------------------end------------------------------------
">

NIST is counting the time between collapse initiation and the time
the &quot;first exterior panels&quot; hit the ground. I don't think that your
calculation is addressing the &quot;first exterior panels.&quot;
You are also treating the lower floors as though each floor is
independent of the others below it. In actuality, the floors below the
fire are still intact at least for a split second. In your
calculation, the upper floors are falling as a unit. For a few seconds
is probably correct. Compressive waves ain the girders re transmitting
linear momentum throughout the lower floors.
However, compressive waves in the girders are transmitting
momentum throughout some of the lower floors. The floors right below
the point of impact (not all of them, due to the stress, but several)
are moving as a unit. The individual delay is larger, but several
floors get an impulse force at the same time. This would shorten the
falling time. Almost impulse, the compressive wave travels at speeds
faster than the speed of sound in air.
If you look at the photos, both upper and lower floors (relative
to the burning floors) take a few seconds to shatter.

I doubt that with just 15 or so credits, that a minimum of 12 of
your credits returned A's (in keeping with proportion).

You can always judge someone's character not so much by how much
