Heya everyone,

I have a 93 Saturn SL2 that consistently stalls at the first stoplight
I come to after a cold start in cold weather (20-40 degrees).  After
braking, if you just let it sit, it will continue to idle fine.  If you
give it a little gas, the RPMs drop a little.  If you give it a normal
amount of gas, it stalls.

If you do the same thing with it in neutral, it revs fine, and if you
keep it at ~3000rpm for a little while before putting it in gear, it
won't stall.

Less consistently, in hot weather (70-90 degrees), the idle speed will
randomly rise to 2000-2500 RPM and randomly return to normal some time
later.

What are the test procedures for the IAC and ECTS?  Those were my first
suspicions.  Maybe the fuel pump?

Where should I start?

Thanks guys :)
