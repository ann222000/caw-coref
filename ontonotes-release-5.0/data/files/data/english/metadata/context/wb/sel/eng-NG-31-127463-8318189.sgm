Just finished re-watching all 20 &quot;classic&quot; Bond films via the Ultimate
Edition DVD collection, plus NSNA and CR 2006, all in a span of about
three months.  Seems like an appropriate time to re-do my rankings of
the films, from best to worst.  Or perhaps &quot;from most personal
favorite to least personal favorite&quot; is better terminology.
Regardless, I've found that my preferences for the films has changed
significantly in some ways from my rankings of the past.

So, without further adieu...

1.  Goldfinger
2.  From Russia With Love
3.  On Her Majesty's Secret Service
4.  Casino Royale (2006)
5.  The Man With The Golden Gun
6.  Moonraker
7.  The Spy Who Loved Me
8.  Thunderball
9.  Tomorrow Never Dies
10.  Octopussy
11.  Diamonds Are Forever
12.  Dr. No
13.  Goldeneye
14.  You Only Live Twice
15.  Die Another Day
16.  Never Say Never Again
17.  The World Is Not Enough
18.  The Living Daylights
19.  Live and Let Die
20.  For Your Eyes Only
21.  License To Kill
22.  A View To A Kill

Some specific thoughts:

TND moved up the most in my list.  I had it previously in the bottom
five, now its at number 9...and my favorite of the Brosnan era.

The Brosnan era, as a whole, moved up in my list with none of his
films appearing in the bottom five.

TWINE moved up as well -- for the very first time ever, I found the
film enjoyable.  Not among the truly greats of the series by any
measure, but definitely &quot;watchable&quot; -- which is a considerable
improvement from my previous rating of it.

OP also moved up significantly on my list.  It had also previously
been a bottom five, now its at number 10.  Not as silly overall as I
had previously thought, and it manages to sustain a good deal of
suspense in its latter half.

YOLT suffered the biggest drop.  A previous top 7, it fell to 14.
Wonderful sets, and a mesmerizing score.  But the dialog was lacking,
and Bond had less to do than usual.

MR and TSWLM remain high in my list, and I continue to be puzzled by
those who separate these two films by a lot in their rankings.  No two
Bond films feel closer in tone and style to me.

FYEO has such sloppy plotting and weak writing that it continues to
bewilder me how it can be so highly regarded.   I have to assume that
the mere fact that Bond stays on earth and Jaws doesn't return is
enough for some people to overlook the writing/plotting and give it
high praise.

DAD truly is a schizophrenic film.  Many talk about its two halves,
but for me its divisible into three acts.  The first act, including
Cuba and the sword fight, is top-notch Bond.  Had the film sustained
this level of excellence, it would have finished in the Top 10
easily.  The second act, which includes the Iceland segment, reminds
me fondly of the Moore era style and tone.  Not quite on par with the
first act, but the second act still is immensely entertaining for me.
It is the third act which sinks the film, for me.  This is the post-
Iceland stuff, namely the final confrontations aboard the giant and
slowly disintegrating airplane.  It just doesn't work -- it runs out
of steam and seems very redundant &amp; predictable.  The entire third act
should have been re-written, IMO.

NSNA is a difficult film to fit in to the rankings.  Its enormously
fun to see Sean back.  He has a charisma and charm that is totally
unique to him.  Too bad the score is atrocious and the plot was forced
to be a re-hash of TB.  If they had been allowed to deviate a bit
more, it might have worked better.  And Basinger probably gets my vote
as the weakest leading lady of them all.  Still, Sean's charisma is
enough to carry the film up to 16 out of 22 -- not too shabby
considering the overall quality of the EON body of work that his film
is competing against.

--- And this list is different from the last one which was when?  And
what could possibly have changed in your life and outlook to view the
films differently this time around compared to the last time?  It
seems that for me my list remains pretty constant with the only time
films dropping or rising in rank being when a new Bond comes out, but
a sudden dramatic leap or fall for an old Bond film just doesn't
happen in my list as it does in yours in the case of TND .  I've
rewatched most of the Bonds erratically and my views on each one
really haven't changed much.  The only film that has improved over
time in my estimation is Goldfinger, but only in the sense that its
No. 2 ranking is now closer behind FRWL's No. 1 spot so as to be No.
1.5.

Dr No is very low... to me it's leagues above Octopussy, Diamonds Are
Forever, Thunderball ...

All subjective I guess.

Only number 6? I was expecting it to be number 1. Oh yeah, I
forgot...Number 6 *is* Number 1.
