Microchip question

I have a rescued dog who apparently has a microchip.
None of the local facility's &quot;universal readers&quot; can decipher it; they only
detect that &quot;something is there&quot;.
[the only theories are that it's either defective, &quot;blank&quot; or is an
&quot;ISO&quot;/foreign chip]

Will it hurt the dog to have a second *functional* microchip implanted?
If not, which chip brand do you recommend?

Thanks for any help offered.

No, but if the bad chip is found first by a scanner, they aren't
likely to look for a second one.  Can your vet remove the bad chip
before inserting a new one?

Which chip is best for your dog is going to depend on where you live.
If it were me, I'd contact the local animal shelters and ask what
brands of chips they can read.

If it's because it's a &quot;foreign&quot; chip [ISO standard, for example] our local
scanners *should* pick up a &quot;US&quot; one, I'd *think*. [and hope]

He said he could try but the surgery would lengthy and dangerous.
The scanner only gives the approximate location and X-rays would have to be
used *during* surgery and it would be a &quot;digging around until he found it&quot;
proposition.
I don't want to put my dog through that and neither does he.

While searching the internet, I found a story where they tried to remove the
chip from a euthanized racehorse and it took -3 hours- of hacking and
hunting until they found it.
Yikes!

I just called the vet.
He uses &quot;AVID&quot;.
Are they good?

I'm certainly no RFID expert but a lot depends on which
radio frequencies they're using, aside from question of data
format.  My inclination would be to try to embed a new chip
as closely as possible to the site of the old chip but there
may be interference issues there.

I don't know what &quot;good&quot; means in this context.  They're
very widely used, and I have Avid chips in all of my dogs.

My dogs have Avid chips.  Every time I bring the dogs in for whatever I
have the vet scan them to make sure the chips are in place and functional.

And even without a scanner Avid can help bring your dog home.  The
weekend before last my daughter found a stray dog running down our
street.  She caught her and snapped a leash on, which was when she found
the Avid tag on the dog's collar.  She used her cell phone to dial the
1-800 and read off the number.  The operator gave her the owner's phone #.

10 minutes later the extremely relieved owner (who lived about 5 miles
away) met my daughter at the corner and retrieved her dog.

So yeah, I like Avid.

I added another &quot;t&quot; and got there.
Very helpful!
Thanks!....:)

Thanks also to everyone who offered great information and insights.
I'm not nearly as nervous now as I was before.
[the whole microchip thing kinda gives me the willies.....but I worry too
much over *everything* concerning my &quot;babies&quot;, anyway, so that's not
abnormal....for me].....:))

AVID seems to be highly regarded by all of you [and by &quot;good&quot;, I meant
reliable, safe, widely recognized, etc]
Michelle said she uses them in all her dogs, so they must be pretty good.

I was also concerned about the &quot;migration issue&quot; as I've heard horror
stories about that but some research done in the interim seems to indicate
that they've pretty much fixed that problem.
Matt kindly reassured me of the unlikelyhood of that happening....:)

As a person who literally grew up on and with horses, I've seen some pretty
freaky things &quot;migrate&quot; from who-knows-where and usually wind up popping
unexpectedly *out* of the coronal band of a horse's hoof.
The thought of something similar happening to my beloved dog was really
stressful, to say the least.

Kathleen's tale of the ID tag getting a dog home was wonderful.
My poor dog has so many tags now [license, rabies, huge actual &quot;dog tag&quot;
with &quot;Reward if found/ID/etc etc etc info&quot;] on that she's going to sound
like a sack of cowbells walking around.....:))

If all of this makes you think I'm a chronic worrywort, you'd should been
here the day she was spayed.
One of the vet's office ladies came out to the parking lot and told me that,
no, I could *not* sit in the truck, staring nervously at the reception room
windows the whole time she was in surgery.
[I thought it was a fairly reasonable compromise, considering they wouldn't
let me stay *in* the operating room and hold her paw].......LOL!

Again, thank you all so much for allaying my worries.
Great and very helpful people, all of you......:)

I don't know, but I do understand that there have been
design changes to the chip to minimize migration.
