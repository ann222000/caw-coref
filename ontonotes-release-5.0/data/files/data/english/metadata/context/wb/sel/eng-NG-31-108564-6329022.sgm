..can I be aggressively offensive today?  ( I think I'll get stuck
into the government, because that kind of 'offical sanctity' is a bit
like some roughneck scientists we all know.)

Today they're crowing and gloating about the unemployment figures
(this is in Australia), down to 4% or so, ..the best since the 70's
they're saying (I remember the seventies - a time when there was
choice).  But they're also saying that the participation rate is down
too, ..and informed comment is telling us, ..as an aside, .. (and get
this little gem) (let's see if they keep this bit of a serve up for
the evening news)... ..that 30 % of employable males are "exempting
themselves" from the workforce (I think that was the phrase they
used).   It seems that if you throw enough money and idiots around,
things somehow get done anyhow.  What is it they're saying about half
the population working too hard and too long hours? ....whilst the
other half don't have a job?

Or maybe they're sitting at home whilst the wife or other designated
'interest' chooses 'liberation' and goes out to work - to stand around
and entertain the other 70% of the species (I see fuck-me shoes) are
back in fashion (time the Doc Martins gave wey, eh? ... and got traded
in for something a bit more interesting) (that's good, ..we need more
breeders)  whilst things somehow 'get done' - whilst they (the 30%)
watch telly, or DVD's and drink grog, ...at peace in the knowledge
that Aidan somewhere is riding out the weather and counting sandgrains
(..and God only knows what the Woof is doing..) ...but it probably
doesn't involve breeeders, and it certainly ain't talking to
strugglers like me, ..bent on taking on the world.   An' Jeez, .. the
price of Petrol is down from $1.40 to $1.07, and I'll bet after the
gov. giving $3000 to people wanting to convert to gas it will dip to
under a dollar as those Shiites and Sunns take time out from
eyeballing each other to  wait a minute, whilst yet another
spectacular gas find comes on stream here in WA.   An'
China, ..building harbours all over the world, to sequester the
mineral deposits for the future.   The Olympic games?  (Pprrphhh!)
(What???????  Who?????????   What??????  Whe??????? )

?????????????????????????????????????????????????????   ??????????????
???????????????????????????

(Who cares, ..Be Happy....!)   With all these takeovers and private
equity funds buying up everything these days we're just looking at the
upping the ante in the money stakes, ..how much of it is needed  to
run the country.   What is money anyway?  I could never work it out,
but I think there's something more to it than those funny bits of
metal and paper you pick up in the streets from time to time, or what
people give you for annoying them most of the day.  ...

No worries.
I read somewhere that Australia will decline to a group of small islands
eventually.
Most of it will be underwater anyway.

Now there you be, thinking like a plate tectonics  guru instead of an earth
expansionist. An EE would look at his wallet and see it expanding, money
manifesting from the aether and filling the void. A PT on the other hand,
will look at his wallet and see a grand convection zone, mostly though, a
rapid disappearance of money into a very deep subduction trench. Later, Will

Well Don, should I be pleased that they kicked me out of the country
then ?
May be in fact !

Further I am learning all the time that never have been so many people
living out of garbage bins in the streets of Perth, Sydney etc ,  and
as well Industrial Laws made so vicious that people can be sacked on
day to be re-employed the next by same firm on a 20% or more
downgraded wages. This is why may be are so many people so fed up with
the Convicts Rabble Run system that they  have decided to quit &amp; go on
the dole. .

Money you asked ? what is money ? At the present time US &amp; Australian
banks are allowed to lend 10 times the amount of capital announced and
pretentiously consolidated !!! Which is not since some of the assets
are in fact fluctuating in &amp; out money from patrons. In fact it is a
game where the more witty and callous financiers indeed double their
capital at least once every single year... Money  or Economics are the
big fraud (as well as Geology is incdentally ) , and it makes sense
indeed since this is the same carrion fed, blood sucking, cow milk
drinking,  hormones boosted, endocrinal deviants, genital intern
destroyed through circumcision ( or Interstitial atrophied) &amp; immoral
hence mutants supported by all those Mass Merdias in the US &amp;
Australia proning games &amp; more games of any kind to turn the head of
the poor Goys &amp; excite their greed &amp;  lowest bestial instints for
alleged success &amp; recognition.

In such Economics as taught incidentally at the Sydney Universities by
former WA Premier Manure Geoffrey Gallop, careful teaching is made,
so as not to point out finger to the parasites of society : Pollies
preying on society &amp; foraging in their pocket 1 000 times more cash
that they are worth, clueless Economists concerned with only their own
job, other vermines living like the pests of the fields out of the
deviance of Universilities Brainwashed alleged Sci000ntific Elite
conducting to the results we have under our own eyes in Australia by
ex : THE LAND TURNED INTO A DUSTBOWL  AND OVER 250 AUSTRALIAN FARMERS
MURDERED IN COLD BLOOD SINCE  JAN 2006 !

You, as a True Geologist, seeing clearly indeed the incoherence of all
accepted theories,  and considering further that knowledge is not
limited to a narrow field of specialisation but encompass indeed the
whole spectrum of our Earth inhabitat, I fully understand your
desperation in the face of a worthless, endless flow of no noisy
diarrhoea of words saying everything &amp; its contrary and  meaning
nothing !!!

Hi JP.

"Noisy diarrhoea of words - saying everything and meaning
nothing" ...What about this one:-
--------------------------------------
"The strength of plate tectonic theory lies in its ability to explain
everything about the processes we see both in the geologic record and
in the present. Our understanding of the subtleties continues to
evolve as we learn more about our planet, but plate tectonics is truly
the foundation upon which the science of geology is
built." http://www.visionlearning.com/library/
module_viewer.php?mid=66
--------------------------------------

This is real Harry Potter stuff, for when you turn it upside down in
front of a mirror and read it off you see it for what it is - true
enough, ...for it's ability to explain anything about the processes we
see in the geological record are zilch, and so correspondingly is its
strength. ...   "Subtleties"?  Read, "everything that Plate Tectonics
cannot explain".  And the bit where it says "...but Plate Tectonics is
truly the foundation upon which the science of geology is built" ...
Well, ..it says it all, doesn't it?  - geology is in a parlous state.

Plate tectonics is false was shown to be by Carey with the Pacific
Paradox.  It is just dishonesty and a need to believe in something,
regardless of how wrong, which keeps it going.
