This SNAFU is one of my favorite Canadian stories:

I think they should put the plane on display in the Murphy
Engineering Hall of (in)Fame.

It's ok.. Us yanks pulled a similar math error in the recent past with a
mars lander in which they did the math in meters instead of feet and
forgot to convert. The probe cratered into the surface instead of a soft
landing.

At least the canucks got back on the ground in one piece.

You want to read about the Transat (another Canadian airline) Flight 236
which ran out of fuel over the Atlantic, and managed to glide to the
only bit of rock poking out of the water - the Azores. Where, as luck
would also have it, they had a FOAD runway originally intended for B52s.

Lajes Field in the Azores is a major USAF refueling base.  I've been there
several times.   Beautiful place, quaint little village nearby.

You're confusing two different Mars missions -both failed- and what actually
happened as well.

#1. The Mars Climate Orbiter mission failed because two different teams
working on the mission did not coordinate with each other, one of them
submitting it's figures in English measurements instead of Metric figures,
as they were required to do. It wasn't that anyone forgot to convert feet to
meters, it was that they didn't know the one team had mistakenly submitted
it's figures in English measurements *at all*, and accepted them as being
metric values.

As a result, the Climate Orbiter -not lander- hit the planet's atmosphere at
orbital speeds and almost certainly disintegrated into plasma, as it's
closest approach would have been only 35 miles above the surface and the
probe was never designed for re-entry anyway.
Even with Mar's very thin atmosphere that's not survivable, and it no doubt
created a very expensive fireworks show for any passing UFOs...

#2. The Mars Polar Lander that followed the above mission was also
unsuccessful, but not because of mis-measurements: As best NASA can tell,
when it's landing legs deployed at around 50' of altitude, they sent a
spurious shut-down command to the descent motor, and the lander dropped the
last fifty feet or so to the Martian surface, creating a very expensive
&quot;Thud!&quot;.

No crater in either case, though.
