Currently, I'm taking a multivitamin/mineral (without iron), 4 grams of
fish oil, and 1000 IU of vitamin D3 daily.  The multi is for general
health insurance and the fish oil vitamin D3 because I'm a heart patient.

What do you take and why?

Omega-3 fish oil (2400 mg EPA, 1200 mg DHA)
900 mg Pantethine
1500mg Niacin

Multi-vitamin (all the standard reasons), 800 mcg folic acid (may or may
not be heart protective, as it lowers homocysteine levels, though it's
not clear if that actually protects the heart, but it won't hurt),
calcium with D if I can choke it down (it makes me *very* queasy), 1000

A multi-vitamin (because it includes the correct dose of C, which goes with
the ALA/EPO)

Evening Primrose Oil &amp; Alpha Lipoic Acid (for the neuropathy. I'll probably
quit these when I've used up the ALA. My feet feel much better)

Fish Oil, 100mg x 2, for the Omega 3

Inositol Hexaniacinate - Niacin, 500mg x 4, doctor prescribed for
cholesterol (I will *NOT* go back on Statins)

Pantethine, 300mg x 3, my choice to add, helps HDL/LDL

Bromelain w/ Quercetin for muscle ache as needed. Not an analgesic but it
sure helps.

1/2 standard aspirin before bed as a blood thinner. This way it's much
cheaper than the &quot;low dose&quot; aspirin sold. With my total mass I figure it's
more appropriate also.

Multi-vitamin for reasons already cited by others
Fish oil 1 gram (I eat lots of fish too) due to its many positive
effects on heart health and inflammation in general
Calcium 600 mg with D 2X per day to ward off osteoporosis
Magnesium 250mg--helps with calcium absorption, and I found it helps
keep the number of headaches I have down
Garlic oil--heart and digestive health. (Also eat lots of garlic.)
Vitamin C 1000 mg 2X daily--has antihistamine effects that help with
allergies
Vitamin E 400 mg (gamma)--potent anti-oxidant

Over the years, Quentin generally supported foods containing quercetin.
Some things have a &quot;j&quot; or &quot;u&quot; shaped curve when it comes to dose
response. Up to a point they are good for health, but too much of a good
thing can sometimes have negative effects. Diabetics generally have a
lot of oxidative stress and antioxidants can hel. The problem is that
too much results in pro-oxidation. Peroxide was mentioned in the
abstract the included the following:
&quot;Published data on quercetin pharmacokinetics in humans suggest that a
dietary supplement of 1-2 g of quercetin may result in plasma
concentrations between 10 and 50 micromol/L. Our data suggest that
cytoprotective concentrations of some flavonoids are lower by a factor
of 5-10 than their DNA-damaging and proapoptotic concentrations.&quot;
PMID: 15735088

I take fishoil capsules (4x1000 mg/day) and it has good results for
triglycerides.

Many of the supplements I take are AGE inhibitors (advanced glycation
endproduct inhibitors). Even metformin is such an inhibitor.

Glucosamine/chondoritin mix, because I seize up otherwise.
Omega 3 fish oil, not enough fish in my diet.
Just started some benfotiamine (B1)
Baby aspirin, out of habit...

I figure I get enough vits and minerals from my diet. The B1 is in
case that murine model of 15x faster clearance applies to people too.
I've lost a couple of kilos this week, which might be due to the B1 -

Fish oil, 1200mg x2, all the regular reasons plus the Doc believes it
might slow, or prevent the kidney disease from affecting the new
kidney.

Calcium +D, 500mg x2, to battle the effects of the prednisone. (First
day today with the arm brace removed, yippee!)

Cinnamon, 500mg x2, glucose metabolisation.

Vitamin E, 400 iu,  Doc says it will help with the feet cramps at
night, hasn't really, but figure it can't hurt.  Hmmm... just reading
the back of the bottle and it says check with physician if diabetic,
anyone know why?

Potassium, 500mg, for the foot/leg cramps.

The cramps are attributed to the transplant meds/effects.

in place of the Vit C, try Zinc next time. it has much better &quot;healing&quot;

The supplement I take (one-a-day) comes from India:

Methylcobalamine .......... 1500  mcg
Alpha Lipoic Acid ...........   100  mg
Chromium Polynicotinate .. 200  mcg
Inositol ............................ 150  mg

When Dxed in 06/05 I was also at pain with PN.
Over all life style change, along with tight control over BG (A1C
5.4-5.8) has given me almost total relief from PN. But I am also
positive the above combo has made significant contribution.

The bad news is I can not get the same package deal here in US and
have to import it from India. Here are the packaging details:
http://tinyurl.com/33yxsb , http://tinyurl.com/2qxv9a , http://tinyurl.com/3c4uzb ,

Its made from aquatic organisms. No I have no connection with them
just found the product plenty helpful.

I tried similar combo from separate supplements and was not too
happy.

I take the following:

Calcium, because I cut back severely on my dairy intake
post-diagnosis.

B complex, because I started on B12 when I started on
metformin and we bought the wrong bottle last time and
didn't want to waste it:-)

Glucosamine 1500mg, because it has done wonders for the
arthritis in my wrists.

I also eat psyllium husk, for additional fibre, as part of
my menu, and get thiamine, niacin and several other vitamins
in my daily portions of Aussie Vegemite.

It's likely that I no longer need the calcium because I now
eat yoghurt and cheese and I probably have plenty of B1, B6
and B12 in my present menu so I may discontinue both the
calcium and B complex.

When I took lipitor, I also took CoQ10.

I probably don't need the B or the calcium because I

Probably from worrying about remembering to take all
those:-)

Have you ever run them through the drugs interaction
checker, together with your prescribed meds? You may have to
do several runs because it is limited to comparing only 20.

For BP, I note you take Resveratrol, my alternative is

In looking through that list again, not being critical just
some observations. This is my own way of attempting to meet
the same needs.

Cinnamon Extract
I use cinnamon quill to flavour my morning coffee. For
taste, not BG's.

Garlic
I would use an average of a clove a day in my meals. I also
include, every day in some form, portions of onion,
capsicum(peppers), green leafy veges and meat.

Aspirin
Wine replaces aspirin for my BP and also includes
resveratrol.

Omega-3 Fish oil
Of my 21 &quot;main&quot; meals of breakfast, lunch, dinner each week,
at least 7 include fish, and at least half of those are
&quot;oily&quot; fish such as salmon, tuna or sardines.

Cocoa Extract
I eat an average of one square of high-cocoa (75%+)
chocolate daily.

Niacin
In my daily vegemite.

Calcium
Yoghurt, cheese and in various veges daily.

Potassium
I now use Potassium Chloride, sparsely, as my salt.

Vit D
I live on the 28th parallel:-)

I don't pretend that I'm getting the same quantities of
those vitamins and minerals that people get in vitamin
tablets, but I tend to the belief that there are synergistic
benefits when I get my vitamin and nutrition needs by food
rather than pill. However, as I mentioned in my separate
post, I do take some pills myself although I'm dubious as to
their value.

As I said, not implying criticism, just my different
approach.

Consider yourself lucky ;)  I used to be like that.  I avoided pills
in every way that I could and always looked to 'fix' things through
diet.  But, since the transplant I no longer have that choice.  So
when you are taking 20+ pills a day, adding a few supplements becomes
easier.  I also figure if I still regulate my diet, the supplements
are icing on the cake.
I still wish I could take care of my health with less pills, but
it's not an option anymore.  :/

I hate taking pills myself.

I'm considering adding a number of things, but have to balance the
benefits of each pill vs. blowing it off.  Each pill I add increases the
risk I'll get annoyed at the whole regimen and skip it.

You notice supplements are BIG pills?  1g fish oil pills are HUMUNGOUS.
My multi, vitamin D... big pills.

But the meds, the Lisinopril, Metoprolol and Zetia are teeny tiny
pills.  I could swallow a whole month's worth of Zetia in one swallow.
Meds are a lot easier to swallow than supplements.

Supplements are a pain, and I prefer to get much more from food as Alan
suggested.  But... as much of a pain as swallowing pills is, I'd swallow
a whole heck of a lot of them to avoid any more surgeries - and I'll
never eat enough fish oil, for example, as I just don't care for most fish.

But some stuff I know I can add to my diet.  Like... I don't need to
take a CLA supplement, I just need to quit being so cheap and ALWAYS buy
pasture-raised meat and raw dairy from pastured cows.  Cause that stuff
is a lot easier to swallow than pills!

The Effect of Glucosamine on Serum High Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol
and Apolipoprotein AI Levels in People with Diabetes Mellitus.
Albert SG, Fishman Oiknine R, Parseghian S, Mooradian AD, Haas MJ,
McPherson T.
Internal Medicine, Division of Endocrinology Saint Louis University
School of Medicine, St. Louis MO.
Objective: Dietary and nutritional supplements are modulators of HDL
cholesterol (HDLc) levels and production of apolipoprotein AI (apo AI).
Previously, in vitro treatment of hepatocyte cell lines with glucosamine
increased apo AI production by stabilization of apo AI mRNA. The
hypothesis is that the neutraceutical, glucosamine, when given in
conventional doses (1500g per day) may increase apolipoprotein AI and
HDLc levels in subjects with diabetes and low HDLc. Research Design and
Methods: Twelve subjects (3 men/9 women) with type 1(n=2) and type 2
diabetes (n=10), age 55 +/- 12 years (mean +/- SD) who had low HDL
cholesterol 1.03 +/- 0.20 mmol/L were randomized to a double-blind
placebo-controlled cross-over trial of glucosamine 500 mg or placebo
orally three times daily for 2 weeks, followed by a 4-week wash-out, and
2-week cross-over to the alternate therapy. Results: Fasting serum
glucose, fructosamine and total cholesterol remained stable during the
drug and placebo phases. Glucosamine had no significant effect post
therapy on serum levels of HDLc (from baseline of 1.02 +/- 0.15 mmol/L
to 1.05 +/- 0.16 mmol/L compared with placebo from 1.04 +/- 0.21 mmol/L
to 1.06 +/- 0.16 mmol/L), nor in changes in apolipoprotein AI levels
(from baseline of 147 +/-15 mg/dL to 140+/- 126 mg/dL with glucosamine
and 146 +/- 25 mg/dL to 142 +/-17 mg/dL with placebo). Conclusion: These
observations suggest that glucosamine at commonly consumed doses does
not have significant effects on glycemic control, lipid profile or
levels of apolipoprotein AI in diabetic subjects after 2 weeks of
supplementation.

For me, glucosamine is the difference between exercising or not, and
therefore essential for diabetes control. I have osteoarthritis, and
have tried various combos of glucosamine/chondoritin/MSM; the brand I
have now is not cheap, but worth its weight in gold to me. I get
vastly increased pain and stiffness levels if I skip the dose for just
a couple of days.

But do you find the Alpha Lipoic Acid and Evening Primrose Oil

&gt; I was going to take the dinner meds out of the compartment and put them in

&gt; Also took my dose of Amaryl too close to the previous dose.  Got rather

Valid for me. Can't speak for others.

My dose is 1500mg. During my last trip I found I was in
increasing pain from my wrist while driving the manual car
through Europe. Initially I put it down to the different
arrangement of the controls and gearshift in the
left-hand-drive car but it gradually dawned on me that I had
arthritis.

It got bad enough that I had difficulty carrying bags in
airports and had to be very careful when pulling or pushing
on doors. If my wrist was at the wrong angle or I made
sudden movements the pain was quite sharp and high.

My wife was already taking Glucosamine and a poster here
(JDA or Eskimo Joe) was enthusiastic about the stuff so I
started on it myself when we got home. After three months of
1500mg daily the pain became a memory and now I only get an
occasional twinge.

I'm unsure about the value of my other supplements - but not
about glucosamine.

For some reason onion have high bioavailability.

Vitamin C is said to enhance the effectiveness of quercetin.&quot;

&quot;... While quercitin is a powerful antioxidant with an antioxidant value
of 4.7 compared to Vit C and Vit E of 1.0 that might not be directly its
most useful feature as far as we are concerned.  It could be that its
inhibition of the aldose reductase enzyme that converts unused glucose
into sorbitol is far more important.  Some organs like eyes do not
regulate glucose uptake with insulin.&quot;

Flavonoid intake and risk of chronic diseases -
http://www.ajcn.org/cgi/content/full/76/3/560

Knekt P, Kumpulainen J, Jarvinen R, Rissanen H, Heliovaara M, Reunanen
A, Hakulinen T, Aromaa A.

National Public Health Institute, Helsinki, Finland. paul.kn ... @ktl.fi

BACKGROUND: Flavonoids are effective antioxidants and may protect
against several chronic diseases.

OBJECTIVE: The association between flavonoid intake and risk of
several chronic diseases was studied.

DESIGN: The total dietary intakes of 10 054 men and women during the
year preceding the baseline examination were determined with a dietary
history method. Flavonoid intakes were estimated, mainly on the basis
of the flavonoid concentrations in Finnish foods. The incident cases
of the diseases considered were identified from different national
public health registers.

RESULTS:

Persons with higher quercetin intakes had lower mortality from
ischemic heart disease. The relative risk (RR) between the highest and
lowest quartiles was 0.79 (95% CI: 0.63, 0.99: P for trend = 0.02).

The incidence of cerebrovascular disease was lower at higher
kaempferol (0.70; 0.56, 0.86; P = 0.003), naringenin (0.79; 0.64,
0.98; P = 0.06), and hesperetin (0.80; 0.64, 0.99; P = 0.008) intakes.

Men with higher quercetin intakes had a lower lung cancer incidence
(0.42; 0.25, 0.72; P = 0.001),

Men with higher myricetin intakes had a lower prostate cancer risk
(0.43; 0.22, 0.86; P = 0.002).

Asthma incidence was lower at higher quercetin (0.76; 0.56, 1.01; P =
0.005), naringenin (0.69; 0.50, 0.94; P = 0.06), and hesperetin (0.64;
0.46, 0.88; P = 0.03) intakes.

A trend toward a reduction in risk of type 2 diabetes was associated
with higher quercetin (0.81; 0.64, 1.02; P = 0.07) and myricetin
(0.79; 0.62, 1.00; P = 0.07) intakes.

CONCLUSION: The risk of some chronic diseases may be lower at higher
dietary flavonoid intakes.

&lt;&lt;snip some good stuff&gt;&gt;

Another facet Quentin turned me on to is the synergy of Quercetin with
Bromelain. Bromelain is an enzyme found in pineapple that helps with muscle
ache. I find when I get achy, two caps, two or three times in 24 hours will
quiet things down for a number of days with no noticeable side effects for
me.

Funny, I never had back pain till Lovastatin, even at max weight over 500
lbs. Now I have almost constant low grade pain even though I've lost a third
of my body mass to date.

No, I was aware of that possibility. I've had the x-rays and
other tests since then; definitely arthritis. It was a dull
throbbing continuing pain which got sharper with sudden or
increased movement. Nor do I have any of the other symptoms
described by others here of carpal tunnel - no finger
movement difficulties, only the wrists. The wrists are still
fully mobile, not like the FS I had a while back.

Also, I don't recall anyone suggesting that glucosamine may
help carpal tunnel. Maybe it does, but I'm not aware of it.

Piling on...

I take a multi-vitamin (Centrum somethingorother), Omega-3 fish pills
(from Nordic Naturals), and 2grams C (though we ran out so I've not
taken any the past week).

In the winter, I sometimes take Whole Foods' &quot;Wellness Formula&quot; when I
am either beginning to show signs of coming down with something or if I
have been around someone who has something as a temporary boost to the
immune system (I know that taking something like that daily is nearly
useless as your body gets used to it).

I also have been, on and off, doing a cocktail of flax seeds stirred
into 1tbl cranberry juice (pure, not sweetened) in a glass of water. I
forget where I found this one but I've been doing it awhile.
