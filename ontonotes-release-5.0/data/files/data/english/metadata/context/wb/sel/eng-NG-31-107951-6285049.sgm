Also, send along this blurb written by Selig S. Harrison for the
Newsweek International Edition, as a reminder of how well his policies
are working:

Oct. 16, 2006 issue - On Sept. 19, 2005, North Korea signed a widely
heralded denuclearization agreement with the United States, China,
Russia, Japan and South Korea. Pyongyang pledged to "abandon all nuclear
weapons and existing nuclear programs." In return, Washington agreed
that the United States and North Korea would "respect each other's
sovereignty, exist peacefully together and take steps to normalize their
relations."

Four days later, the U.S. Treasury Department imposed sweeping
financial sanctions against North Korea designed to cut off the
country's access to the international banking system, branding it a
"criminal state" guilty of counterfeiting, money laundering and
trafficking in weapons of mass destruction.

The Bush administration says that this sequence of events was a
coincidence. Whatever the truth, I found on a recent trip to Pyongyang
that North Korean leaders view the financial sanctions as the cutting
edge of a calculated effort by dominant elements in the administration
to undercut the Sept. 19 accord, squeeze the Kim Jong Il regime and
eventually force its collapse. My conversations made clear that North
Korea's missile tests in July and its threat last week to conduct a
nuclear test explosion at an unspecified date "in the future" were
directly provoked by the U.S. sanctions. In North Korean eyes, pressure
must be met with pressure to maintain national honor and, hopefully, to
jump-start new bilateral negotiations with Washington that could ease
the financial squeeze. When I warned against a nuclear test, saying that
it would only strengthen opponents of negotiations in Washington,
several top officials replied that "soft" tactics had not worked and
they had nothing to lose.

Cheers,

KP

Yep and Clinton paid them big time tribute to continue their nuclear

nukes.

While it's true that Clinton had an agreement with the North Koreans that they
likely didn't intend to follow to the letter, it's worth noting that we really
*didn't* spend millions on it, as Newt Gingrinch's Congress never funded any of it.
The light water reactors that were part of the deal never materialized. But there is
absolutely no doubt that GWB's plan of "I'm taking my ball and going home" gave the
North Koreans four and a half years to work on perfecting their nuclear capabilities.

Quite simply, everything the Bush administration has done regarding North Korea
and Iran has guaranteed that they actually *do* what we (and the rest of the world)
*don't* want, and, furthermore, made it plain that GWB sees war as the first option.

The North Koreans surely noticed that the US attacked Iraq (when the evidence
that they had nukes was (at best) highly dubious) and has heated up the rhetoric
against Iran (who are quite likely working towards acquiring them but don't have
them yet), but has really done nothing aggressive toward themselves (and it is well
known that they have gotten quite some ways towards getting, if not actually having,
nuclear weapons.

The best, most thorough article on the history of the situation in North Korea is
two and a half years old:

http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/2004/0405.kaplan.html
___________________

Thanks to an agreement brokered by the Clinton administration, the rods were locked
in a storage facility under the monitoring of international weapons-inspectors.
Common sense dictated that--whatever it did about the centrifuges--the Bush
administration should do everything possible to keep the fuel rods locked up.

Unfortunately, common sense was in short supply. After a few shrill diplomatic
exchanges over the uranium, Pyongyang upped the ante. The North Koreans expelled the
international inspectors, broke the locks on the fuel rods, loaded them onto a
truck, and drove them to a nearby reprocessing facility, to be converted into
bomb-grade plutonium. The White House stood by and did nothing. Why did George W.
Bush--his foreign policy avowedly devoted to stopping "rogue regimes" from acquiring
weapons of mass destruction--allow one of the world's most dangerous regimes to
acquire the makings of the deadliest WMDs? Given the current mayhem and bloodshed in
Iraq, it's hard to imagine a decision more ill-conceived than invading that country
unilaterally without a plan for the "post-war" era. But the Bush administration's
inept diplomacy toward North Korea might well have graver consequences. President
Bush made the case for war in Iraq on the premise that Saddam Hussein might soon
have nuclear weapons--which turned out not to be true. Kim Jong-il may have nuclear
weapons now; he certainly has enough plutonium to build some, and the reactors to
breed more.

There are some inaccuracies in this scenario (mostly, what
Clinton's plan was for would not have helped them get
plutonium, and they probably made these bombs out of
the plutonium they already had before 1996 or so, which
was kept locked up while the Clinton plan was still in effect).
But these pale before the fact that Clinton is not actually
president and has not been for nearly six years.  It's time
for the current President and the party of personal responsibility
to step up and take some responsibility for what happens
while they're minding the store.

For a little thinking outside the box.
There's no way in hell that N Korea didn't continue it's research
using other materials during the Clinton agreement. We don't evene know
where all the "re-education" camps are let alone nuke facilities.
I don't really fault Clinton for making the agreement. Diplomacy had
to be tried, but I do resnt the idea that more appeasement after it
failed miserably once is a good thing.
I don't see N Korea as anywhere near the threat that Iran is. N Korea
wants to be a successful country, able to feed it's people, and to
unite them once again.
Since there is massive support fron S Korea for getting the US out
this is exactly what I think we should do.
Get out of Korea altogether, dump it back into the UN's lap where it
belongs, and if N Korea takes the south because the UN wouldn't defend
it, So what?
Absolutely no skin off the US's nose and we get to consolidate
resources where they actually matter for the US.
Time for us to stop being in the middle of everyones messes.
