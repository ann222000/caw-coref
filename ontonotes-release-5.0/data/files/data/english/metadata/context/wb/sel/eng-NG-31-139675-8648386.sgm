*Really?* How come I've never seen it in nethack? Especially since my

Because it takes just 1 turn to open a blessed turn, so it's rather
rare to be interrupted in mid-open.  But people have reported the same
in vanilla on rgrn a couple of times, e.g:

It's pretty easy to duplicate, too; start in discover mode, wish up
=conflict and some tins.  The 2nd tin I ate I got:

There are 2 tins of newt meat here; eat one? [ynq] (n)
The tin opens like magic!  The kitten bites!
You stop opening the tin.  The kitten bites!
[Look at floor using &quot;:&quot; command--the uneaten tin is not destroyed, at
least]
There is a staircase up here.  You see here 2 tins of newt meat.

There's *got* to be a better way to reference usenet postings than
google searches. Maybe something to add to the faq once a less unwieldy
way is posted. I've used article numbers from allnews.readfreenews.net
in the past, a open long retention read only server.

How is this a bug? You start eating something, are interrupted by a
monster, stop eating it, kill the monster and then eat the tin right?
This isn't a matter of having it go into a infinite loop with no
&quot;interruptions&quot; if the first open fails. That's the only way I could see
this as a bug. Surely no one expects the dev team to start keeping track
of fractions of moves.

I don't much like the fact that the *only* thing left out was the
monster attacking either BTW. Very misleading.

It's not being referenced by a google search, but by a pointer to
google's indexed archive of the original message.  If google's mission
is &quot;to organize the world's information and make it universally

I'm not complaining.

No monster attack.

The monster moved into line of sight then wandered away again because of
inviso.

There are a lot of ways to get interrupted, not all have messages--
it's entirely possible the OP's post wasn't omitting anything.  It's
just a lot easier to arrange to have something attack you for testing
interruptions than to arrange exactly when a monster's going to walk
into line of sight or whatever.

My point was that we routinely get http lines over 40 characters whereas
an article number would be google:20934 or something like that. *Very*
big difference.

No, the monster doesn't attack *you*, *you* kill the monster so you

*maybe*, but a) I've never seen it *that* I'm sure of and I've been
playing nethack for a *long* time. b) fixing it would be a b*tch as then
your dealing with another special case of the order of things being done
in a turn which if memory serves me is very kludgy as it is. Fixing the
message just for the sake of the message would be overkill.

Yes, and the interruption wasn't mentioned either. That at least *was*

(You know, there's a reason chuck lives in my killfile...)

It is, of course, obviously a bug; a tin can only be opened once.  Once
the &quot;tin opens like magic&quot; message has been displayed, it should never
be shown again for the same tin; the tin should either be open, or a
message like &quot;You [finish/continue] opening the tin&quot; should be displayed
if more time is required to open the tin.

Given the nature of blessed tins, it should probably just be open, but
fortunately I don't need to fix this one since it doesn't affect
gameplay (though the proposed fix might).

&gt; It is, of course, obviously a bug; a tin can only be opened once.
&gt; Once the &quot;tin opens like magic&quot; message has been displayed, it should
&gt; never be shown again for the same tin; the tin should either be open,
&gt; or a message like &quot;You [finish/continue] opening the tin&quot; should be
&gt; displayed if more time is required to open the tin.

No, it would be a *bug* if: a) the game crashed b) some *lasting* effect
of the game was altered in some undesired way or c) if a side-effect
(the programming term: i.e. one routine affecting another without
explicitly telling it to. To say that this fits into any of these would
be an out and out lie. To fix the order of a thing being done simply
because of an effect which occurs in *less* than a turn would be
counter-productive by definition.

&gt; Given the nature of blessed tins, it should probably just be open, but

Right - make it *not* work properly, which is always a risk.

Right. In any decent interface, the article URL can be clicked and
opens immediately in a browser window, while a message ID
must be used to search for that message. The reason Google
Groups links have become &quot;the standard&quot; is that they are
extremely easy to use: one click and you're there, and you can
go &quot;there&quot; for the deepest archive available.

Now if we could only convince the people using them to spell
out the URLs completely, since some interfaces don't
recognize them as clickable if the &quot;http://&quot; part is omitted.

How do *you* plan on eating that tin you got your heart set on,
remembering that if a monster shows up nethack will stop you from
a)unlocking a door b) eating a food ration c) reading a spellbook d)
digging with an axe/mattock and I'm sure there's others I can't recall
at the moment. You're fighting the game, and that's *never* a good idea
with nethack or it's incarnations.

Well, yes, but the posting interface of what you are
reading is broken if it folds URLs in the process of
posting them. Until W3C faces the need for a URI
folding indicator reserved character, URIs need to
be on a single line, full stop.

You don't even have to do that. if you're building a
link for others to use, open the Google Groups
&quot;Individual Article&quot; display, and capture _its_ URL
for publication; it's plenty short enough.

You're perhaps thinking of the Google Search URLs,
which are indeed a mess worth triming carefully
of all null content sub-specifiers before passing
those URLs along to others.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I rather like Message-IDs, though, since I can use

&gt; much as three clicks if it doesn't.

Well, a couple of comments on that. First, message
IDs aren't necessarily &quot;short&quot;. That I have seen,
there's no particular standard limiting their
length, and so some of them encode a fairly huge
amount of information encrypted in a way only the
ISP can invert [perhaps suitable for tracing an
article to its author], and end up even longer than
usual Google Groups article URLs.

Others are just of the form

[historical site article sequence number]
[at]
[site.tag]

and those are fairly short.

Second, I've seen message IDs fail as a way to find
an article, in the Google Groups advanced search
[but I have no way to know if that is just typical
Google Groups search software brain damage [Google
Groups archive search is hideously broken as of
about ten weeks ago], or if the message ID is
sometimes really getting lost in the process of
archiving the message].

They are in any case a pretty _expensive_ way to
find an article, since they pretty much require that
either a full news-spool search be done, or a hash
of message IDs be made and maintained by the news
spool, which may well be exactly what is done.

I've also used message IDs for years and had them
work just fine, but that doesn't seem to be as true
today as it was in the past.
