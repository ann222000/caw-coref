Serious ouch.

While cutting onions last night, my thumb slipped, got a bit ahead of the
backs of the fingers that I use to guilde the knife blade, and I sliced off
a chunk at the tip of my thumb as neat as you please.

Eeeeyouch!

Well, actually, it didn't hurt too bad (at least at first) as I keep my
knives very sharp.  It took a few seconds before it really started bleeding
and that was enough for me to get a fresh paper towel (don't have any
medical gauze) folded into a pad and over it.  My next task was to get
Athena (my 2 1/2 year old daughter) into the Explorer and buckled into her
seat--one handed.  I managed.  Also got the piece I'd sliced off packed into
a plastic bag with some ice.  I figured it's better to have it in case the
doctors wanted to try to sew it back on. (Turned out not.)  By this time, of
course, my thumb was really starting to hurt and the direct pressure to try
to get the bleeding stopped was not helping in that regard.  Probably the
fact that I had been cutting onions contributed as well.

In any case, it was not long after my arrival and checking in at the ER that
Athena told me she needed to be change.  That was another awkward bit--back
in the restroom trying to change her one-handed--but I managed.

Took about 20 minutes before I got called back to be registered and taken to
a treatment room and another 10-15 minutes before a doctor got back to see
me.  Not too bad, I think, since my biggest problem was pain rather than
anything life threatening.

End results:
- No, they were not going to try to sew the chunk back on.
- It had been about 7 years since my last tetanus shot, so to be safe they
gave me one.
- A prescription for vicodin (sp?) which I will be picking up on the way
into work this morning.

Typing must suck and I bet it's gonna impact your gripwork in Judo for
some time.

Sucks dude.  When I was working as a professional cook at a BPOE Lodge I
knew a guy who did exactly the same thing.  They sewed it back on for him
though.

Peace favor your sword (IH),

Yeah... did this with a bandsaw many years ago. On my index finger. My
miserable selfish partner in woodworking distracted me and off came a
nice hunk of tissue.

No... they don't reattack hunks of tissue, then, or now.  It grew back,
with a small scar, and it's a tiny bit the tender area ever since. Just
to let me remember a moments forgetfulness.

You shouldn't need the vicodin though, although  I'd keep pressure off
it, whilst it's healing- a foam gel sleeve from the drug store will help
to avoid banging it. When it heals, get some 'medea' brand topical
medication. It's to try to minimize the scarring which keeping the
pressure off of the thumb end, should also help prevent.

Yup I have cut my thumb before and had it stitched up. OUCH. Always cut away
from you. That was fast in the emergency room. One of my GPs stitiched me
up.
