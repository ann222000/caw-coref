That crash still haunts my dreams. Not even the actual thump to the
ground so much (though the footage of the rear wheel locking up, the
tubie unspooling from the rim, and the eventual smack is plenty awful)
as the shots of an anguished, pained Beloki screaming and crying as he
lay there.

Broken hip, chasing victory in the Tour, it was a miserable moment.

Miserable moment indeed, but he's not exactly a psychological fortress
there, allowing that crash to end his career.

Perhaps, but Erdos did a lot of drugs.

From:
http://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/archives/2003/06/29/drugs_and_math.html

Like all of Erdos's friends, Graham was concerned about his
drug-taking. In 1979, Graham bet Erdos $500 that he couldn't stop
taking amphetamines for a month. Erdos accepted the challenge, and went
cold turkey for thirty days. After Graham paid up--and wrote the $500
off as a business expense--Erdos said, "You've showed me I'm not an
addict. But I didn't get any work done. I'd get up in the morning and
stare at a blank piece of paper. I'd have no ideas, just like an
ordinary person. You've set mathematics back a month." He promptly
resumed taking pills, and mathematics was the better for it.

Oh, I know all about that. I got the quote from this Slate article:

Which quotes the same anecdote.

I think mathematics is an absolute good, and increasing the amount or
quality of knowledge in the field is a laudable goal. Faster racing does
not have similar benefits. I doubt it's even more entertaining.

I have virtually no ambiguity about drug use in sport: I think it's a
bad idea, and I support the principle that it should be eliminated.

I have never taken any drug in the amphetamine family. I've never
inhaled. The strongest thing I've ever taken is Rum. Sweeet rum...my
last drink was a week or so ago. It's all a blur to me, now.

I half agree here.  Even Erik Dekker never seemed to quite get back
to the same level after breaking his leg; although Dekker was older.
Beloki did seem less mentally tough though.

Dumbass,

I wish it was that simple, but it isn't.  Erdos was a great
mathematician,
but if he had quit speed and math (first of all, he probably could have
kept doing math if he broke the addiction) someone else would
eventually have come along and solved the same problems.  So it's
not like the speed is necessary to bring math into the world.  It just
made it happen a few years sooner.

Suppose there was a drug that made you more efficient at work,
so you could take off an hour earlier and ride your bike or go home
and torment your cat.  And it didn't really have any side effects.
Would you take it?  (It's called coffee, but let's pretend it's a black
market pill instead.)  Suppose the guy in the next office was taking
it and instead of knocking off at 4 pm, he worked a little longer and
got more done, and you worried that you'd look bad and lose your
job if you couldn't keep up.  (Let's pretend the job was worth
keeping.)
Would you take it then?

Suppose you were a mathematician and you knew that some person
(not Erdos, who didn't take permanent jobs) was working an extra
hour or two a day and was more productive, so he'd beat you in
any job hunt.  Would you work a little harder?  Lots of people do that.
What if you knew he was working the same amount but getting more
done because he was getting speed from Paul Erdos on the side?
Would you feel compelled to ask Erdos for some spare greenies
so you didn't have to leave the field?

The Erdos story is about  a person whose drug use enables him
to achieve worldly success (within the very limited unworldly world
of math) in a competitive field.  If it had been anyone other than
Erdos,
who didn't seek a normal job, it would inevitably mean that his
success came at someone else's expense.

The same incentives that spur doping are the ones that explain
why Americans work too many hours and have the shortest
vacations in the developed world.  [gwhite-bait] It's all Mises and
Schumpeter's fault.  I'm not arguing in favor of doping.  I'd like a
longer vacation, too.  Or even to take the one I supposedly have.

If illegal drug use cannot be eliminated in a culture at large, how can
it be eliminated in sport?

Consider that, in the culture at large, there are much stiffer
penalties (jail time) than in sport (bans from competition).

I think increasing the sum of human knowledge is an absolute good. If
this an axiomatic (or nearly so) statement about the value of knowledge,
then so be it, but I think the causative value of knowledge in helping
us live longer, more prosperous lives with many more distracting Usenet
newsgroups than our forefathers had access to is incontrovertible, and
greatly overwhelms the ill effects brought on by technology.

To jump to a nice reductive comparison, smallpox vaccinations have
lengthened many more lives than a-bombs have cut short.

I am of course much more vexed by specific applications of technology.
For example, it's clear that box-cutter knives and ammonia fertilizer
are far too dangerous to be left in the hands of just anyone. And those
sharpie marker pens, too: kids use them for graffiti tagging.

&gt; &gt; I think mathematics is an absolute good, and increasing the amount or

&gt; Dumbass,

&gt; I wish it was that simple, but it isn't.  Erdos was a great
&gt; mathematician,
&gt; but if he had quit speed and math (first of all, he probably could have
&gt; kept doing math if he broke the addiction) someone else would
&gt; eventually have come along and solved the same problems.  So it's
&gt; not like the speed is necessary to bring math into the world.  It just
&gt; made it happen a few years sooner.
">

There's a fair argument to be made that the list of top-tier
mathematicians of the 20th century goes like this:

1) Erdos
2) Ramanujan

Erdos was the Merckx of math, but also the Cal Ripken. Ramanujan died
young. Erdos was productive for years beyond what is normal in the field.

My cat is dead, and thank you for bringing up that painful memory.

I torment my dog now. :)

Let's look at the societal benefit. Assuming I'm not some useless
parasite in a useless parasitic organization (spammer, mafia accountant,
gangbanger, sociologist, etc.) then my contribution and productivity are
a net benefit to society. Society will be a little bit happier and
healthier if my department or organization or sector is a little more
productive.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Suppose you were a mathematician and you knew that some person
&gt; (not Erdos, who didn't take permanent jobs) was working an extra
&gt; hour or two a day and was more productive, so he'd beat you in
&gt; any job hunt.  Would you work a little harder?  Lots of people do that.
&gt; What if you knew he was working the same amount but getting more
&gt; done because he was getting speed from Paul Erdos on the side?
&gt; Would you feel compelled to ask Erdos for some spare greenies
&gt; so you didn't have to leave the field?
">

Isn't a better question whether I am good enough to stay a
mathematician? Comparative advantage is real.

The fact is, every one of us (or virtually every one of us) is locked
out of lucrative jobs by virtue of our inability to do them as well as
the top performers.

If there were just a few million people in the world who were all just a
few notches dumber or lazier, I would have a top-level IT admin job. Or
be a programmer. Or whatever.

Is it fair that some people drink coffee?

A certain class of thinkers spend a lot of time worrying about those
"left behind" (not "Left Behind") in the economic sense, and chat
knowingly about capitalism moving towards greater meritocracy but also a
more "winner take all" system (this happens for several reasons).

Coffee (and maybe Adderall) can alter who actually makes it to the inner
circle, but note that if you assume only the best X people will be able
to get a particular job, and some Joe vaults into that job pool by
virtue of magic-pill use, then the net effect is that the job pool
becomes, in total, more productive than if it was entirely drug-free.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; The Erdos story is about  a person whose drug use enables him
&gt; to achieve worldly success (within the very limited unworldly world
&gt; of math) in a competitive field.  If it had been anyone other than
&gt; Erdos,
&gt; who didn't seek a normal job, it would inevitably mean that his
&gt; success came at someone else's expense.
">

Even so, I have to believe that while Erdos very much managed to create
his own version of a career and a life outside of the tenure track, he
seemingly did so in a way that allowed him to maximally focus his
attention on mathematics.

It also points out that Erdos probably advanced the field of mathematics
quite considerably. One might point out that while Erdos may or may not
have taken someone's job, he also greatly advanced the field of
mathematics, which is presumably the absolute goal of math.

Moreover, he was the network effect ne plus ultra. He collaborated so
much that he probably made other mathematicians more productive than
they would have been without Erdos.

Furthermore, he probably was the site-effect-free little black pill: if
you were a top mathematician who was not collaborating with Erdos, you
were almost certainly at a competitive disadvantage to the ones who
were. I imagine there was some non-trivial competition for the attention
of Erdos.

I don't know if this inversion makes any sense, but what the hell, it's
Usenet: I drink coffee, doesn't that deprive the marginal worker of the
opportunity to drink that same coffee, and thus reap the rewards of
enhanced productivity?

I wouldn't know about that. I get paid enough to support my modest
drinking and cycling problems, plus I get five weeks of vacation a year.

Obserious: coffee is the difference between me staying awake or sleeping

&gt; &gt; Dumbass -

&gt; &gt; If illegal drug use cannot be eliminated in a culture at large, how can
&gt; &gt; it be eliminated in sport?Sport is smaller than culture.

&gt; &gt; Consider that, in the culture at large, there are much stiffer
&gt; &gt; penalties (jail time) than in sport (bans from competition).The average caught pot smoker faces less sanction than the average
&gt; caught Sudafed-using athlete. Or whatever your favourite example of an
&gt; OTC medication that can cause a positive.
">

Dumbass -

That's true of marijuana, but not of other recreational drugs.

For example, here in California, the possession of even a tiny bit of
cocaine is a felony. That's WAY stiffer than getting banned from the
UCI. Felonies show up on credit reports, background checks for
employment, etc. UCI bans? You can't race. Big fucking deal.

I see your argument clearly, and any evaluations are subjective, but
I agree with Ryan on this one because with no progress there no chance
at all for new good things to occur. My feeling is that eliminating
the possibility for good to occur through stagnation is bad. The "Dark
Ages", which actually did have some new knowledge develop, are a good
example of how stopping progress is a bad thing.
I guess I see the possible uses, for good, outweighing the fear of
negative usage as bsing a positive.
Depending on how you look at it, the worst things that can happen
are, wiping out the planet which we could do pretty well already, and
IMO controlling and enslaving the vast mass of humanity. We have
limited means to accomplish the latter, and progress could contribute
to that, but it could also massively improve the quality of life for
massive amounts of people and has.

Taking your specific example, we should probably remember three things:

1) predicting car trends years into the future is hard
2) GM in particular has benefit liabilities for current and retired
workers, which, while entirely its own fault, mean it has a very hard
row to hoe in competing
3) Toyota is extremely good at what they do, and it must suck to have to
sell beside them.

After all, it's not that this year's GM cars are worse than last year's
GM cars. It's more that this year's GM cars are not quite as good as
this year's Toyota cars.

Regarding the Euro auto makers, I think they are doing okay, aside from
DaimlerChrysler, which seems to be suffering from lingering effects of
the merger. And having to compete with Toyota.

Indeed, one could read the entire auto industry as a continuing
progression of meritocratic "winner takes more" economics.

On the other hand, there's a big transition to EV that is likely to be
driven by Li-Ion (or even better next-gen energy storage systems) in the
next decade. I predict that one or more current major autobuilders will
fumble the ball and do badly through the transition, and that several
small car or EV component companies will profit handsomely, if only by
the inevitable buyout.

More importantly, unless your boss is retarded (it happens; send out
resumes) stroking is virtually irrelevant. I don't know what it's like
in your offices, but even in my public-sector IT backwater, what makes
the boss look good and feel happy is competent employees who do good
work on time. This year's supervisors were last year's best technicians.
And I say this as the tech who didn't get promoted.

To hire and promote badly is for an organization to put itself at a
competitive disadvantage. It's as simple as that. It happens, and then
market shrinkage or bankruptcy ensue.

Have you considered a better company?

Okay, fairly played. But Dirac and Lorentz were physicists. They each
won Nobels, for heaven's sake, and there's no Nobel for mathematicians!

I mean, if you're going to claim Dirac and Lorentz, then next the
mathematicians will claim every theoretical physicist, thus kidnapping
Einstein, Fermi, and what the heck, probably Feynmann too.

And that would be stupid.

Similar, though lesser arguments could be thrust at Poincare, who at
least had the decency to not win a Nobel (hey, how did that Matteucci
Medal get in here?). But his major mathematical contribution was pure
conjecture.

In conclusion, you should have just admitted you were studying physics.
Applied mathematics, indeed!

Fair enough. I think there's a lot of competition for most top jobs,
inasmuch as lots of people who make manager in one way or another (or by
forming their own company) plan to be a holder of a top job.

There's also people who are happy with what they have: a small business
owner who is prosperous enough, or whatever.

But the competition for top jobs surely consists of a group of
successful job-holders who generally beat out a lot of unsuccessful
aspirants. And I would dare to claim that even if they never submit a
resume, most VPs at most major companies have to be considered to be
auditioning for the top job.

But I'll go check my original assertion:

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; The fact is, every one of us (or virtually every one of us) is locked
&gt; out of lucrative jobs by virtue of our inability to do them as well as

I think that stands up. There are virtually no lucrative jobs which are
not the subject of substantial competition. And in general, I think that
while the job market is imperfect, it's considerably better than chance.
Almost all of the people who don't have a lucrative job are worse at
that job than the person who has it.

What, "Deal or no Deal"? It's a pretty good illustration of valuations
of risk, and what the case models lack in nudity, they make up for in
volume.

No, I'm kidding. DoND drives me nuts, mainly because it is a veneer of
tedious, slow-paced melodrama over a rather straightforward set of
decisions.

I don't think I'd make a very good contestant, not least for my
willingness to pick case 1 as mine, then unlock cases 2-6 on the first
turn.

Also, there's not much math,

More knowledge absolutely can enable people who do

important for people who create knowledge to consider

You are completely wrong about this. Romans would
crucify people by the hundreds and by the thousands.
Armies would leave mountains of skulls. The Bolshevik
counter-revolution killed entire populations by walking
and starving them to death. Pol Pot did not really need
hand guns. Band came to a village; join our band of
killers or die. Stalin killed 20 million. Sure he used
railroads to transport, but walking them to the camps
would work just as well.
