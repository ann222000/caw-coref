With All Our Heart
When we throw a banana peel into the garbage, if we are mindful, we know
that the peel will become compost and be reborn as a tomato or a lettuce
salad in just a few months. But when we throw a plastic bag into the
garbage, thanks to our awareness, we know that a plastic bag will not become
a tomato or a salad very quickly. Some kinds of garbage need four or five
hundred years to decompose. Nuclear waste needs a quarter of a million years
before it stops being harmful and returns to the soil. Living in the present
moment in an awakened way, looking after the present moment with all our
heart, we will not do things which destroy the future. That is the most
concrete way to do what is constructive for the future.

Reading this quote and having read Thich Nhat Hanh before, I am
convinced that while he emphasizes mindfulness in his teachings, the
real starting point in terms of practice has to be Right View.  The
Buddha did not teach first and foremost &quot;meditation&quot; or &quot;mindfulness&quot;
but ethics and the law of causality.  He also as far as saying &quot;He who
sees dependent origination sees the Dharma.&quot;  Right View it seems is
not just something we can be too sure we have learned like in an intro
class to Buddhism. One could say that actually mindfulness is the
starting point.  But why be mindful in the first place?  Such terms as
socially engaged Buddhism go back to the beginning parts of the early
teachings.  With metta, Steve

I'm not quite sure what you're getting at, Steve. Are you saying mindfulness
is the starting point or right view is the starting point? Maybe both. We
have to keep in mind that although the 8-fold Noble Path always puts Right
View first, none of the steps can take place without all the rest being
there in some way, too. Thây (Thich Nhat Hanh) always emphasizes that Right
View means &quot;not holding views of right or wrong.&quot; Now that's a very good
place to start practicing mindfulness!!

I'm saying Right View comes first. In practical terms, this means
establishing oneself in the precepts as best as possible with an
awareness of cause and effect, what is harmful and what is
beneficial.  This is not to say you have to be &quot;perfect&quot; before
starting to meditate or that the Noble Eightfold Path is sequential or
a schedule.  In daily life, mindfulness is also connected to Right
Effort, knowing what is wholesome or not wholesome.  As far as &quot;not
holding views of right and wrong,&quot; why be mindful then about anything
distinct about dumping plastic bags?  &quot;Right&quot; and &quot;wrong&quot; are charged
words.  Harmful/beneficial works for me, skillful/unskillful,
wholesome/unwholesome. One starts to meditate for example with the
Right View of potential benefits, cause and effect.  There is the
deeper sense of Right View that the path/practice ultimately leads to
the end of suffering, liberation.  In a sense, Chan/Zen emphasizes
that one's whole life becomes the path/practice, that &quot;there is no
attainment.&quot;  With metta, Steve

One good thing about Chan (thanks to its Taoist influence) is that words are
seen as traps, snares, and nets for us to get caught in. Once in, how do we
get out? As Shifu says, we are so keen to get into this [human] world [of
language] and then we don't know how to get out.

If &quot;right&quot; and &quot;wrong&quot; are charged words for you, consider that the Buddha
never taught thinking dualistically or superficially. He chose the
fundamental term &quot;Right View&quot; to actually cut through dualism. Consider that
&quot;right&quot; is not meant dualistically here. Consider what else it might mean...

The Sanskrit root 'dhr' informs many English words such as right, direction,
straight, regal, etc. It is also the root of the words dharma and dharani.

Referring to the Dharma itself:

&quot;Buddhists themselves refer to the teaching by the Pali term Dhamma (or in
some schools of Buddhism by its Sanskrit equivalent dharma). One of the root
meanings of this word is &quot;to uphold&quot; (dhr in sanskrit), and in this sense is
used to denote that which upholds the Universe. It has sometimes been
translated as the Norm or the Law.&quot; http://www.buddhanet.net/bsq14.htm

&quot;Originally dharma is derived from the Sanskrit root dhr, with the meaning
of that which preserves or maintains, especially that which maintains human
activity.&quot; http://www.hm.tyg.jp/~acmuller/dicts/ddb/cache/b6cd5-754c.html

&quot;The term dharma, which is now employed in English also, is sometimes
translated as truth, sometimes translated as &quot;that which is&quot; or sometimes it
is translated as &quot;the way.&quot; But just to look at the etymology, &quot;dharma&quot;
comes from the Sanskrit &quot;dhr.&quot; This verb dhr means &quot;to hold&quot; or &quot;to
sustain,&quot; and the noun form becomes dharma, which means, &quot;that which
sustains everything as it is&quot; or &quot;that which makes everything in this
universe what it is.&quot; So we can translate this word dharma as &quot;the truth of
things,&quot; or &quot;that which makes everything just what it is.&quot; So we look at
each and every one of us here today and we can see that we are the body of
that dharma: the dharma is all of us. We are all part of this whole
interconnected set of phenomena which we call the universe. That is what a
dharma talk is all about: things, just as they are. We try to enrich
people's lives to let everyone see that we are all intertwined, and we are
trying to open our eyes to the dharma in us, or the dharma as us.&quot;

From an Etymological Dictionary:
right (adj.1)
&quot;morally correct,&quot; Old English riht &quot;just, good, fair, proper, fitting,
straight,&quot; from P.Gmc. *rekhtaz (cf. O.H.G. reht, Ger. recht, O.N. rettr,
Goth. raihts), from PIE base *reg- &quot;move in a straight line,&quot; also &quot;to rule,
to lead straight, to put right&quot; (see regal; cf. Gk. orektos &quot;stretched out,
upright;&quot; L. rectus &quot;straight, right;&quot;
O.Pers. rasta- &quot;straight, right,&quot; ar ta- &quot;rectitude;&quot;
O.Ir. recht &quot;law;&quot; Welsh rhaith,
Breton reiz &quot;just, righteous, wise&quot;).
Lith. teisus &quot;right, true,&quot; lit. &quot;straight.&quot;
Gk. dikaios &quot;just&quot; (in the moral and legal sense) is from dike &quot;custom.&quot;

right, -er, -est, noun, adverb, verb

-adjective 1. in accordance with what is good, proper, or just: right
conduct.
2. in conformity with fact, reason, truth, or some standard or principle;
correct: the right solution; the right answer.
3. correct in judgment, opinion, or action.
4. fitting or appropriate; suitable: to say the right thing at the right
time.
5. most convenient, desirable, or favorable: Omaha is the right location for
a meatpacking firm.
6. of, pertaining to, or located on or near the side of a person or thing
that is turned toward the east when the subject is facing north (opposed to
left).
7. in a satisfactory state; in good order: to put things right.
8. sound, sane, or normal: to be in one's right mind; She wasn't right in
her head when she made the will.
9. in good health or spirits: I don't feel quite right today.
10. principal, front, or upper: the right side of cloth.

Zen/Chan Masters are characteristically not concerned with traps/words but
rather with prajna, that ocean of unconditional love-wisdom in which we
actually live and move and have our being, that prajna which upholds the
universe.

No other school of Chinese Buddhism has more written pages about
itself than Chan. Even now at any bookstore, books on Zen outnumber
the Suttas/Sutras.  As for estimating the influence of Taoism, consult
Master Sheng Yen's writings and opinions. He has a very balanced view
and I admire him greatly. By &quot;charged words&quot; I am referring to Thich
Nhat Hanh's interpretation of Right View, not the term &quot;Right&quot; in
front of view. Using words like &quot;right&quot; or &quot;wrong&quot; have emotional
impact on people in general. Tell them they are &quot;wrong&quot; see what
happens.  Gradually lead them to a sense of the beneficial... another
outcome. The Buddha in the Nikayas/Agamas sees &quot;clinging to views&quot; as
the traps of ascetics (and people like ourselves?  just a little
humor...)  The assumption that Buddha taught things nondualistically
is erroneous as would be the asumption that he taught things
dualistically.  The Buddha made clear distinctions between wholesome
and unwholesome, if you read the Nikayas/Agamas.  His approach was
pragmatic.  This can be seen in the Nikayas/Agamas.  In Sutras like
the Diamond Sutra, one begins with this sense of things, the mundane,
in a sense, the early teachings.  If pragmatically there's no
distinction between samsara and nirvana why liberate beings as a
bodhisattva?  Do they just have to &quot;realize&quot; they are not really
suffering?  Even Thich Nhat Hanh asserts that one has to side woth
phenomena in practice.  One doesn't just start with emptiness. In this
regard, he is closely connected to the Nikayas/Agamas in all of his
books. This alo explains why a lot of Chan practice includes chopping
wood?

I also think it's OK to agree to disagree.  It's good to know that if
Nagarjuna, the foremost teacher on &quot;emptiness&quot; can refer to and even
depend on the Agamas/Nikayas in his development of the prajna paramita
teachings, we don't have to throw away the early teachings or consider
them simply Buddhism for those of &quot;blunt faculties.&quot;

I hope you see this post in a spirit of harmony and especially deep
respect for Master Sheng Yen.  Steve

Dear Steve,

I do indeed take your postings in the spirit of harmony and respect. When I
wrote, it was from my point of view at the time, in a spirit of discussion.
Actually I often find that the more I think about something the more
everything just cancels itself out. All your points are well made, and
thanks for taking the time to express them. Before I go on, I want to say
that I'm not pushing anything here, just giving my personal take and putting
things out for discussion.

Can we say that Right View is wisdom, the starting point and the goal of the
Path? It underlies all mental activity. Thây considers the word 'wisdom' a
hindrance and offputting, just as you say the word 'right' can be. So he
uses 'deep understanding' instead. My feeling is that people just don't have
the time to ‘look deeply’ into the meaning of words, and using whatever
comes bobbing by on the surface that looks pretty.  Words have deep
beginnings and meanings and it behooves us to investigate their histories.
(Are those scary words? Then, words are deeply beautiful and our lives will
be harmonious and beautiful if we look deeply into them with understanding
and learn how to use them skillfully.) Thây, in his gentle compassion and
understanding, finds ways to meet people half-way, even creating neologisms
like interbeing. He also uses ‘looking deeply’ in place of investigation.
Personally I have no problem with wisdom, right, or investigation. I think
words have real value in themselves and are worth contemplating deeply.
Neologisms and synonyms are fine if they feed the mind in a wholesome way,
but they don’t come out of nowhere.

Some time back, Rob posted How Do We know We Are Happy? I spent weeks
contemplating 'how do we know anything at all?' and the word 'happy.' (At
the time I was reading a book, Stumbling on Happiness by Daniel Gilbert.
He’s a psychologist, not a Buddhist at all.  He has a very interesting take
on human behavior, worth observing and thinking about.) I began to realize I
was fuzzy on the meaning of 'happy.' I mean, we have a general idea of what
it feels like, but what does the word actually mean, how is it defined, and
how should we be using it? Where did it come from and how has it developed
over time? As you can see, I can get very attached to words! What are they?
And what are they doing? I'm only sorry I don't use them more gently and
skillfully. What I found out about 'happy' is that it comes from an Old
Norse word, 'hap.' Hap, the noun and the verb, entered English in 1205, and
'happy' in 1340, quite a bit later. We don't use 'hap' any more, although
Thomas Hardy published a poem, Hap, in 1898 - who knows why?  but we do use
'mishap.'  Hap the noun means 1) luck and 2) the quality shared by random,
unintended, or unpredictable events or this quality regarded as the cause of
such events. Hap the verb means 1) to take place by chance; 2) to come to
pass.  So how about ‘happy?’  - it meant lucky. It still does in its first
sense. Today’s definitions include

1) Characterized by good luck; fortunate.

2) Enjoying, showing, or marked by pleasure, satisfaction, or joy.

3) Being especially well-adapted; felicitous:  a happy turn of phrase.
(skillful?)

4) Cheerful; willing: happy to help.

Other familiar words in the hap family are perhaps, mishap, happen,
happenstance, hapless, haphazard, happenchance, happening - all clearly
related to random chance. Understanding ‘happy’ in this way helps me connect
with the Buddhist teaching of causes and conditions, and I can think of
'happy' as the feeling of luck or joy at whatever random, unpredictable
events come to pass. What do you think?

It occurs to me that we can use the Five Contemplations before Meals for
words just as we do with food, because words are food.  We can learn to use
words as medicine for the mind, considering how much mental effort is behind
them and how they have come down to us. Then maybe we won’t just grab
fastfood words mindlessly as we rush through life.

1. I contemplate how much positive potential I have accumulated in order to
receive these words given by others.
2. I contemplate my practice of speech, constantly trying to improve it.
3. I contemplate my mind, cautiously guarding it from wrongdoing, greed, and
other defilements.
4. I contemplate these words/this word, treating them/it as wondrous
medicine to nourish my mind.
5. I contemplate the aim of Buddhahood, accepting and consuming these words
in order to accomplish it.

Here’s Thomas Hardy’s poem, Hap.  I wonder, is he indifferent to,
equanimous, or happy despite the obstructions and slicings of nature by
casualty and time?

Hap

If but some vengeful god would call to me

From up the sky, and laugh: &quot;Thou suffering thing,

Know that thy sorrow is my ecstasy,

That thy love's loss is my hate's profiting!&quot;

Then would I bear it, clench myself, and die,

Steeled by the sense of ire unmerited;

Half-eased in that a Powerfuller than I

Had willed and meted me the tears I shed.

But not so. How arrives it joy lies slain,

And why unblooms the best hope ever sown?

Crass Casualty obstructs the sun and rain,

And dicing Time for gladness casts a moan. . . .

These purblind Doomsters had as readily strown

Blisses about my pilgrimage as pain.

Wishing you happiness along the path, and thanks again for writing,

Sheila

No other school of Chinese Buddhism has more written pages about

itself than Chan. Even now at any bookstore, books on Zen outnumber

the Suttas/Sutras.  As for estimating the influence of Taoism, consult

Master Sheng Yen's writings and opinions. He has a very balanced view

and I admire him greatly. By &quot;charged words&quot; I am referring to Thich

Nhat Hanh's interpretation of Right View, not the term &quot;Right&quot; in

front of view. Using words like &quot;right&quot; or &quot;wrong&quot; have emotional

impact on people in general. Tell them they are &quot;wrong&quot; see what

happens.  Gradually lead them to a sense of the beneficial... another

outcome. The Buddha in the Nikayas/Agamas sees &quot;clinging to views&quot; as

the traps of ascetics (and people like ourselves?  just a little

humor...)  The assumption that Buddha taught things nondualistically

is erroneous as would be the asumption that he taught things

dualistically.  The Buddha made clear distinctions between wholesome

and unwholesome, if you read the Nikayas/Agamas.  His approach was

pragmatic.  This can be seen in the Nikayas/Agamas.  In Sutras like

the Diamond Sutra, one begins with this sense of things, the mundane,

in a sense, the early teachings.  If pragmatically there's no

distinction between samsara and nirvana why liberate beings as a

bodhisattva?  Do they just have to &quot;realize&quot; they are not really

suffering?  Even Thich Nhat Hanh asserts that one has to side woth

phenomena in practice.  One doesn't just start with emptiness. In this

regard, he is closely connected to the Nikayas/Agamas in all of his

books. This alo explains why a lot of Chan practice includes chopping

wood?

I also think it's OK to agree to disagree.  It's good to know that if

Nagarjuna, the foremost teacher on &quot;emptiness&quot; can refer to and even

depend on the Agamas/Nikayas in his development of the prajna paramita

teachings, we don't have to throw away the early teachings or consider

them simply Buddhism for those of &quot;blunt faculties.&quot;

I hope you see this post in a spirit of harmony and especially deep

respect for Master Sheng Yen.  Steve

Thanks Sheila and Steve.  Both of your thoughts came across as very sincere
and insightful.  It's quite heartening to read different perspectives in
friendly-spirited discussions even (especially) where we most disagree.  It's
incredible how much a difference it makes if we consciously suffuse metta
into our practice as we read and write in this forum.  Let's connect with
the compassion that arises from the true nature that we all share.

With Metta,
Victor
