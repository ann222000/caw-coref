The other day, my nine-year-old son wanted to know why we were at war.

My husband looked at our son and then looked at me. My husband and I
were in the Army during the Gulf War and we would be honored to serve
and defend our Country again today. I knew that my husband would give
him a good explanation.

My husband thought for a few minutes and then told my son to go stand
in our front living room window. He said, &quot;Son, stand there and tell
me what you see?&quot;

&quot;I see trees and cars and our neighbors' houses,&quot; he replied.

&quot;OK, now I want you to pretend that our house and our yard is the
United States of America and you are President Bush.&quot;

Our son giggled and said, &quot;OK.&quot;

&quot;Now son, I want you to look out the window and pretend that every
house and yard on this block is a different country,&quot; my husband said.

&quot;OK Dad, I'm pretending.&quot;

&quot;Now I want you to stand there and look out the window and pretend you
see Saddam come out of his house with his wife, he has her by the hair
and is hitting her. You see her bleeding and crying. He hits her in the
face, he throws her on the ground, then he starts to kick her to death.

Their children run out and are afraid to stop him, they are screaming
and crying, they are watching this but do nothing because they are kids
and they are afraid of their father. You see all of this son....what do
you do?&quot;

&quot;Dad?&quot;

&quot;What would you do son?&quot;

&quot;I'd call the police, Dad.&quot;

&quot;OK. Pretend that the police are the United Nations and they take your
call, listen to what you know and saw, but they refuse to help. What do
you do then son?&quot;

&quot;Dad...but the police are supposed to help!&quot; My son starts to whine.

&quot;They don't want to son, because they say that it is not their place or
your place to get involved and that we should all stay out of it,&quot; my
husband says.

&quot;But Dad...he killed her!&quot; my son exclaims.

&quot;I know he did...but the police tell you to stay out of it. Now I want
you to look out that window and pretend you see our neighbor who you're
pretending is Saddam turn around and do the same thing to his own
children.&quot;

&quot;Daddy...he kills them?&quot;

&quot;Yes son, he does. What do you do?&quot;

&quot;Well, if the police don't want to help, I will go and ask my next door
neighbor to help me stop him,&quot; our son says.

&quot;Son, your next door neighbor sees what is happening, but he refuses to
get involved as well. He'll not help you,&quot; my husband says.

&quot;But Dad, I NEED help! I can't stop him by myself!&quot;

&quot;WHAT DO YOU DO SON?&quot; Our son starts to cry.

&quot;OK, no one wants to help you, the man across the street saw you ask
for help and saw that no one would help you stop him. He stands taller
and puffs out his chest. Guess what he does next son?&quot;

&quot;What Daddy?&quot;

&quot;Watching you in the window, he walks over to the old lady's house,
breaks down her door and drags her out. He sets her house on fire and
then he...he kills her. He does this while he laughs at you and her.
WHAT DO YOU DO?&quot;

&quot;Daddy...&quot;

&quot;WHAT DO YOU DO?&quot;

Our son is crying and he looks down and he whispers, &quot;I'd close the
blinds, Daddy.&quot;

My husband looks at our son with tears in his eyes and asks
him...&quot;Why?&quot;

&quot;Because Daddy.....the police are supposed to help people who needs
them...and they won't help.... You always say that neighbors are
supposed to HELP neighbors, but they won't help either...they won't
help me stop him...I'm afraid....I can't do it by myself Daddy.....I
can't look out my window and just watch him do all these terrible
things and... and..... do nothing...so....I'm just going to close the
blinds.... so I can't see what he's doing........and I'm going to
pretend that it is not happening.&quot;

I start to cry. My husband looks at our nine year old son standing in
the window, looking pitiful and ashamed at his answers to my husband's
questions and he says...&quot;Son.&quot;

&quot;Yes, Daddy.&quot;

&quot;Open the blinds, son, because that evil man.... now he's at our front
door...&quot;WHAT WILL YOU DO NOW?&quot;

My son looks at his father, anger and defiance in his eyes. He balls up
his tiny fists and looks his father square in the eyes, without
hesitation he says: &quot;I'LL DEFEND MY FAMILY DAD! I'M NOT GONNA LET HIM
HURT MOMMY OR MY SISTER, DAD! I'M GONNA FIGHT HIM, DAD, I'M GONNA
FIGHT HIM!&quot;

I see a tear roll down my husband's cheek and he grabs our son to his
chest and hugs him tight, and says... &quot;It's too late to fight him, he's
too strong and he's already at YOUR front door son.....you should have
stopped him BEFORE he killed his wife, and his children and the old
lady across the way. You have to do what's right, even if you have to
do it alone, before it's too late,&quot; my husband whispers.

THAT scenario I just gave you is WHY we are at war with Iraq and other
terrorists. When good men stand by and let evil happen son, THAT is the
greatest EVIL of all. Our President is doing what is right. We, as a
free nation, must understand that this war is a war of humanity. WE
must remove evil men from power so that we can continue to live in a
free world where we are not afraid to look out our window so that my
nine year old son won't grow up in a world where he feels that if he
just &quot;closes&quot; that blinds the atrocities in the world won't affect him.

&quot;YOU MUST NEVER BE AFRAID TO DO WHAT IS RIGHT! EVEN IF YOU HAVE TO DO
IT ALONE!&quot; BE PROUD TO BE AN AMERICAN! BE PROUD OF OUR TROOPS!

SUPPORT THEM! SUPPORT OUR PRESIDENT IN THE MIDST OF THIS WAR, SO THAT
IN THE FUTURE OUR CHILDREN WILL NEVER HAVE TO CLOSE THEIR BLINDS....&quot;

BOGUS AMMO DUMP STORY YESTERDAY TIMED TO DISCREDIT THE MILITARY AND
PRESIDENT BUSH... A bogus ammo dump story headlining the news Monday
was strategically timed to shift the vote to Senator John Forbes Kerry
as individuals are filling out and mailing in absentee ballots or
voting early. Sadly, voters may have been swayed in their presidential
choice by untruths trumpeted by John Kerry himself in speeches and
interviews this week. (Sound like the Clinton days all over again?)
The fact is, the huge ammo dump was emptied and moved BEFORE Coalition
troops arrived in Baghdad (just as weapons of mass destruction could
have been moved). This was happening as President Bush was making final
diplomatic attempts encouraging the international community to join the
Coalition to oust the Iraqi dictator and murderous regime.
