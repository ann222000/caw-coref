Well I don't see that happening, by the hands of the legal systemm but
if you wish to taste the possiblity, I already told you to find a
place where it is legal.  I can arrange to have weapons shipped any
where in the world.   It also a pity that you don't get infected with
AIDS, but who knows, there is always a chance.

so much for your claim not to be a gay basher oh blackmailer cyber

and pity Dave isn;t about but then he is enough of a hypocrite that he
would only denouce Woger as insane for wishing HIV on someone

never the less the odd of my contracting an HIV infection are
vanishingly small

but then you do so hope for the death of someone that has did no harm

crossed him and realy set him t a fury that has lasted for 9years now

blackmail and then when he flamed me for bringin up my sexaulity I
exposed his blackmail by posting some of his email to me  provoking

How is wishing that you get AIDS, gay bashing,  blackmail, cyber

Keep thinking that, I saw a report the other day the current strains

I like being sub human, it appeals to my aggresivness, and ablility to
deal with death as easy as purchasing a loaf of bread, but then again
YOUR the one that implied and continues to implies death,  I'm just
posting my thoughts on the internet and repelling attacks from you who
wants to bring this out off of the net.

I never implied that, but you act if though you have a right to go and

under many circumstances, war, self defense, but Murder requires a
certain set of circumstances as does self defense,  nevertheless since
you have made it known that your intent would be to kill me if I stood

I don't foresee that happening.

Because this person has no reason to hide it from me, although I am

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;his wife is bi, but he isn't so why do you believe that it is logical
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;that both would have to be bi sexual.

&gt;&gt;&gt; do wish you would realy show some reading skill Dloyd, any skil at
&gt;&gt;&gt; all or is it just a pathology that you have to lie about what folks
&gt;&gt;&gt; say? Never said &quot;have to be&quot; but &quot;might be&quot;

&gt;&gt;No probably tired when I read the groups, and really I don't try to
&gt;&gt;disect every word someone says and hold thier feet to the fire if they
&gt;&gt;have a mispronuctuation or mis-quote, so much hostility. Its like when
&gt;&gt;someone mispells one word, the everyone harps on that one word.
&gt;&gt;Nevertheless, your writing style leaves some terms to be subjective in
&gt;&gt;the context the you write.

&gt;&gt;&gt; you realy have trouble confusing meaning of words like your
&gt;&gt;&gt; insistantce that all killing amoug humans is automatacaly murder

&gt;&gt;I never implied that,.......

&gt; never implied it you stated it as if it were fact

&gt;&gt;......... but you act if though you have a right to go and
&gt;&gt;kill people because you don't like them.

&gt; only becuase you read very badly

&gt; I dislike many people without wanting to kill and I have never except
&gt; in your tromented mind ever sugested that merely disliking someone was
&gt; a legal reason to kill them

&gt; one may kill a criminal in the course of his comiting his crime almost
&gt; always, the full limits of that have never been tested for ongoing
&gt; cyber crimes as is the case right now between us

&gt;&gt;Humans are killed by humans
&gt;&gt;under many circumstances, war, self defense, but Murder requires a
&gt;&gt;certain set of circumstances as does self defense,  nevertheless since
&gt;&gt;you have made it known that your intent would be to kill me if I stood
&gt;&gt;before you,

&gt; indeed I can since you have threatened me and sought and seek to deny
&gt; me my rightfully acces to places I have the lawfull right to be

&gt;&gt;. But
&gt;&gt;I don't foresee that happening.

&gt; inded it is very unlikely for many reason not the least of is you are
&gt; a snivleing coward and blackmailer lacking even the honor to allow
&gt; your vitctum to know the name and motive of his attacker

&gt; deullo was much cleaner but you would be very quiet in world under the
&gt; code deullo

&gt;&gt;&gt; blackmail and then when he flamed me for bringin up my sexaulity I
&gt;&gt;&gt; exposed his blackmail by posting some of his email to me 0rovoking
&gt;&gt;&gt; further outrage andetc

&gt;&gt;Because this person has no reason to hide it from me, although I am
&gt;&gt;repusled by the concept,

&gt; can you see the lie you just typed?

&gt; your repulsion is a reason

&gt; futher he has plenty of other reason the fact you might let it become
&gt; known that he was bi which could certainly present him with problems
&gt; depends on his circumstances

&gt; you realy need to learn something about the real world
">

Now Mork, slow down, take a deep breath, enema a beer or two, and find one
of your male lovers to console you. Then, when you return to reality try
posting again. Right now you are making no sense.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;you have made it known that your intent would be to kill me if I stood
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;before you,

&gt; &gt;&gt; indeed I can since you have threatened me and sought and seek to deny
&gt; &gt;&gt; me my rightfully acces to places I have the lawfull right to be

&gt; &gt;I have never threatend you or sought to deny you anything within your
&gt; &gt;rights,

&gt; you have on your blog threatened that you will further more extreme
&gt; cyvber action than you already have

&gt; you have sought to prevent me from excerising my free right to post on
&gt; USENET

&gt; &gt; I have only attmpted to protect myself from your on going
&gt; &gt;attacks on my posts.........

&gt; your post on RRAP are not yourself you have no right to protect by
&gt; comiting blackmail

&gt; &gt;......... and character.

&gt; you have no right to defend your charcter by enaging in blackmail and
&gt; cyber stalking of my wife

&gt; &gt;  In the supposed death threat that
&gt; &gt;you believe I posted, I only provided a hypothetical situation and you
&gt; &gt;being a poor reader inflated the meaning of the post.  You should go
&gt; &gt;back and study the thread, I have and so has legal Counsel, and it is
&gt; &gt;the opinion of many that you misconstrued the thread.

&gt; that is ireavant Sir entirely irelevant I may coment on a thread as I
&gt; contrue it

&gt; were this not the case I could force you and everyone that my post as
&gt; I Intend not as they wish to contrue it

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;. But
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;I don't foresee that happening.

&gt; &gt;&gt; inded it is very unlikely for many reason not the least of is you are
&gt; &gt;&gt; a snivleing coward and blackmailer lacking even the honor to allow
&gt; &gt;&gt; your vitctum to know the name and motive of his attacker

&gt; &gt;I don't snivleing,

&gt; yes you are

&gt; &gt; I am not a coward,

&gt; yes you are

&gt; &gt; I am protecting myself and
&gt; &gt;apparently with good cause,  and I haven't blackmailed you.

&gt; yes you have blackmialed repeatedly

&gt; &gt; Have I
&gt; &gt;stopped you from doing anything or gained anything from you?.

&gt; yes you have

&gt; &gt;No.

&gt; &gt;My motives have always been simple, stop hijacking my threads and
&gt; &gt;directing posts to me that are abusive.

&gt; there you confess to blackmail you have just admited you took action
&gt; against in orider to stop me from excerising my lawfull rights

&gt; if I choose there is nothing unlawfull in hijacking a thread  yours or
&gt; anyone elses

&gt; there is no law that says I can not respond to your post abusively if
&gt; I choose

&gt; you are seeeking to deny me my lawfull right by means of a threat,
&gt; that is the difination of blackmail Si
&gt; r

&gt; &gt; I have had whole intentions
&gt; &gt;several times to leave you alone because you really appear to be a
&gt; &gt;tortured soul, but I post then you attack, its that simple.

&gt; yes confessed on your blog that you considered action such as those
&gt; you have now taken to be unlawful

&gt; but even if your statement is correct there is no law that says I may
&gt; not attack your posts just becuase you do not wish me too

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; blackmail and then when he flamed me for bringin up my sexaulity I
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; exposed his blackmail by posting some of his email to me 0rovoking
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; further outrage andetc&gt;

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Because this person has no reason to hide it from me, although I am
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;repusled by the concept,

&gt; &gt;&gt; can you see the lie you just typed?

&gt; &gt;&gt; your repulsion is a reason

&gt; &gt;No, it is not a reason, and I have never expressed my opinion
&gt; &gt;otherwise because I know his wife is, just because I am repulsed does
&gt; &gt;not mean that I judge him or her soley on that.

&gt; you seem to judge me solely on that basis

&gt; yu assume he has no way knowing your opinion but from you

&gt; you assume lots of things Dloyd

&gt; &gt; I am repulsed by
&gt; &gt;smoking also but I am not going to not be friends with someone just
&gt; &gt;because they smoke.

&gt; &gt;&gt; futher he has plenty of other reason the fact you might let it become
&gt; &gt;&gt; known that he was bi which could certainly present him with problems
&gt; &gt;&gt; depends on his circumstances

&gt; &gt;No I am not a back stabbing SOB,

&gt; you know agin I never said you were, till nthis very moment but you
&gt; are obviously a SoB

&gt; but even without such concerns accident happen

&gt; &gt; maybe you would do something like
&gt; &gt;that, I am not the one harpping on your sexuality

&gt; cut the crap Dloyd

&gt; MarkMorgan Sucks as a blog title mocking my bisexaulity in your blog

&gt; you are full to over flowing with it

&gt; indeed your biphobia is so pronouced I am sure your friend knows of it
&gt; or at least suspects

&gt; &gt;&gt; you realy need to learn something about the real world

&gt; &gt;I know all I need to know about the real world.

&gt; in many case you are not even in DX range

&gt; &gt; Why do you have some
&gt; &gt;insightful information that I need to know?

&gt; plenty but you will likely never know
