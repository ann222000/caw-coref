Best and Worst Movies of 2005
Copyright © 2005 Susan Bell

Looking back at the films of 2005, I can’t really see anything
that stood apart from anything that I had previously seen. In
short, 2005 really wasn’t the greatest year for motion pictures
except for a few nice surprises here and there. Mostly, the big
hyped films like Steven Spielberg’s War of the Worlds or Batman
Begins were big disappointments. War of the Worlds, although with
a great performance by the usually non-performance Tom Cruise,
had an absolutely ludicrous ending that didn’t make any sense.
When the film builds you up so much to the point of thinking that
Tom Cruise would single-handedly combat and win over the Aliens,
instead it ties all the strings together by coming up with the
explanation that bacteria killed the aliens. The main flaw about
this is that these extra-terrestrials who are supposed to be
light years ahead of us and smarter than we could imagine. These
visitors who have thought of everything else did not consider the
make up of the planet and they did build an immunity before
coming to Earth?

Batman Begins was yet another film that took itself way too
seriously. In the original Batman, Tim Burton paints a macabre
picture of the superhero and the comic sensibilities of the
character fit perfectly within the comic book surrealistic feel
of the movie. In this case, Christopher Nolan who is better know
for his experimental Memento introduces Batman as a human being
with man flaws. I have no problems with that, in fact, I think
that is the strength of the film. What I do have problems with,
however, is that Bruce Wayne is so real that he forgets himself
and in some of the scenes appears to be high on drugs. Christian
Bales turn as Batman has tendencies to go overboard into surfer
territory.

Two of the best films of 2005 were interestingly enough very
similar in style and context. Crash was the low-budget feature
debut by Million Dollar Baby screenwriter Paul Haggis. In the
film he intertwines the lines of seven characters as they go
through their daily routines in a racism-invested Los Angeles.
The other film that deserves recognition is
&lt;A HREF=&quot;&quot;&gt;Machiavelli Hangman&lt;/A&gt;.
This was also a feature debut by new comer
&lt;A HREF=&quot;&quot;&gt;Shervin Youssefian&lt;/A&gt;
who had previously worked as a commercial director. Machiavelli
Hangman&lt;/A&gt; doesn’t follow its characters as vigorously as Crash
but it revisits them every time it jumps back and forth in
different time frames.

Both these films are my two picks of the year because they have a
strong message that jumps off the screen and grabs at the throat
and they manage to be extremely entertaining. And that’s what a
movie is supposed to be isn’t it? Educative, entertaining and
plain simple fun!
