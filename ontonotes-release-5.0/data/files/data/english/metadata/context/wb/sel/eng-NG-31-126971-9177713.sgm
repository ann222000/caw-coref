Some friend of a friend calls me and asks me to go look at his xplappy...so I go and hes lost some .dll file that obviously was deleted when he left the computer on all night connected by a cable modem.
He bought this thing a year ago and it DIDNT come with the rescue-reinstall cds. Mheh...so hes screwd...I tells him go buy the full xp version or get a mac...since hes not linux material.
Then I get home and check moms new vista lappy...wheres the disks to reinstall vista? Ohhhhhhhh...little note in the documents says you gotta make yer own. So I tried and it tells me &quot;they already were made&quot;.
Fucking craptastic...HP sucks, M$ sucks...now we gotta shell out for a set of restore cds at some point.
M$ &amp; the companies who bow to redmonds will must hate their customers.

Call HP, tell them that you never made them and the laptop refuses to. &quot;Ship
the replacement disks&quot; or &quot;RMA&quot; the laptop. They will choose to send the
disks.

Dell charges about $20 US for XP install DVDs (as of Sept. 2006). When you
buy a laptop order the install disks by phone or online. Maybe your friend
can do a repair install using the hidden partition that HP installs on the
system disk without ordering the reinstall CDs. Look for &quot;HP pc system
recovery&quot; in the program menu.

I'm curious as to why you don't consider these folks to be &quot;Linux
material&quot;. I've found the few Linux distros that I've tried to be
just as easy to use, from an end user prospective, as any version
of win that I've experienced. Of course it's probable that they are
unwilling to try Linux, in which case just ignore this post, but
you might try showing them a computer running Kde or Gnome, see what
they think, they might just need someone to do the install/setup for
them. I know that you probably have already tried that, but I thought
it worth mentioning.

Also, if your moms vista lappy came with a windows anytime upgrade disk
(many do), I believe you can also get them at your local computer store?
you can use it to do a fresh install(so I hear). you'll just need your
product key(usually stuck to the bottom of the computer), and you may
have to call M$ to get the activation to work. Personally, I'd hesitate
to install vista on my worst enemies pc(more so my moms) since it's so
resource demanding there are hardly any computers capable of running it
acceptably. I've recently purchased two computers that came pre-
installed with vista and ended up removing it from both because they
simply weren't able to handle it(and vista wouldn't run most of my
software). I installed old copies of win2000 to play my games on, and
opensuse 10.2 for all of my real tasks. It was amazingly easy to find
win2000 drivers for my computers. must be a lot of people doing the same
thing.

I purchased Vista over the weekend.  Though I'm not overly impressed
with it, the problem you have is with HP not MS for the restore disks.
As for the missing DLL, most likely the PEBKAC.

Vista's not good enough to be considered &quot;beta&quot;!

All the hype and spin was pure nonsense - it was thrown together in just
under 10 months - Ballmer was screaming that they &quot;must get /something/
out&quot;.  They /didn't/ &quot;rewrite the kernel&quot; - it uses the same old XP one
with a few additions.

The only /real/ additions over XP are &quot;aero&quot;, which doesn't work on 90% of
machines (you need 4 Gb of RAM for it to /nearly/ work), lots of bogus
&quot;security&quot; nag dialogues and DRM.  The DRM cripples network use
when /playing/ (not ripping) CDs or DVDs in an effort to prevent file
sharing, and deliberately reduces video and audio quality when playing
&quot;premium&quot; material.

Vista is /deliberately/ broken by its DRM, and has so many security flaws,
driver issues and general instability that it's even /more/ unusable than
its predecessor!

The &quot;security features&quot; began actually as a step in the right direction.
The implementation is a mess however. The only reason people (read
end-users) bitch and moan about it is they are all used to running their
accounts with administrative (formerly the default) rights (read monkey
playing &quot;god of the machine&quot;) ...... ALWAYS leads to problems. The
&quot;indexing feature&quot; slows things way down immensely, and the DRM
implementation is, to put it mildly, draconian at best and seriously
hinders performance. This laptop came with Vista Premium installed and 2GB
DDR. I actually gave it 2 weeks of use and tweaking until wiping it and
installing an XP base (for work, and drivers were a real bitch to find)
along with a stable Gentoo x86-64 and a Gentoo ~amd64 set. The main
&quot;feature&quot; of Vista is Aero, a bloated and resource hogging bunch of
eye-candy (still pretty though) which would have been far better served up
on an OSS plate of Beryl and the like. Of course in doing so, M$ would
have relinquished the proprietary display (rather than trying to copy it
poorly just as they did &quot;back in the day&quot; in the old garage).

No, you *BUY* a licensed copy of the 'doze version and use the
instructions on this page to get a fully functional Doom III on Linux:

http://preview.tinyurl.com/4fcr2

Specifically see ...

http://preview.tinyurl.com/2tcn7l

... for the instructions. (URLs are for zerowing.idsoftware.com)

I merely point this out to say it can be done. Personally, I will not buy
any 'doze games that do not have a native Linux version included in the
box. Buying 'doze crap that has no native Linux version will not help the
bean counters see &quot;market numbers&quot; for funding development for Linux. Of
course these commercial games also have to compete with some excellent
&quot;free&quot; games. But as long as the commercial stuff &quot;seems&quot; more polished
to some then it will have a market. The games I have purchased and/or
played in the past 5 years are all available natively on Linux.

FWIW, I have some M$ apologist folks that pretend to be valid Linux users
in my killfile that will likely respond to this. I could not care less
what they have to say. :)

The situation at MS is actually funny:  there are pieces of code within the
Windows NT kernel that were stolen from early BSD - MS /still/ credit the
&quot;Regented of Berkeley University&quot; (in /very/ small print) after they were
found out.

Funny thing is, much of the code they stole was quite badly broken in many
ways (they incompetently stole the wrong versions!).  The people who
&quot;wrote&quot; the kernel back in the early 90s left MS long ago.  The spaghetti
code that they assembled wasn't maintainable even back then, and ever since
they've tacked more rubbish on, so it's now an irredeemable mess.  Most
crucially, /nobody/ /at/ /Microsoft/ /has/ /any/ /idea/ /how/ /it/ /works,/
and they're left with huge chunks of code that they &quot;can't touch&quot; because
it'll &quot;break&quot;.

The current bunch of slack-jawed, point-and-click &quot;programmers&quot; at MS
believe that Visual Basic is a programming language!  There is nobody there
with the slightest kernel-building ability, so they're stuck with the same
old crap they've had for years.  Shame.

The sooner that bunch of overpaid, over-hyped incompetent fools go out of
business, the better for the whole world!

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; All the hype and spin was pure nonsense - it was thrown together in just

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; with a few additions.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The only /real/ additions over XP are &quot;aero&quot;, which doesn't work on 90% of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; machines (you need 4 Gb of RAM for it to /nearly/ work), lots of bogus
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;security&quot; nag dialogues and DRM.  The DRM cripples network use
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; when /playing/ (not ripping) CDs or DVDs in an effort to prevent file
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; sharing, and deliberately reduces video and audio quality when playing
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;premium&quot; material.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Vista is /deliberately/ broken by its DRM, and has so many security flaws,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; driver issues and general instability that it's even /more/ unusable than
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; its predecessor!

Gates picked up 'cheap and dirty OS&quot; from Seattle Computing.
Seattle had been selling their OS for a fraction of DR's price
for CP/M..  It was a knock-off that had gone through a couple

From http://inventors.about.com/library/weekly/aa033099.htm

&quot;IBM tried to contact Kildall for a meeting, executives met with Mrs.
Kildall who refused to sign a non-disclosure agreement. IBM soon returned
to Bill Gates and gave Microsoft the contract to write the new operating
system, one that would eventually wipe Kildall's CP/M out of common use.

The &quot;Microsoft Disk Operating System&quot; or MS-DOS was based on QDOS, the
&quot;Quick and Dirty Operating System&quot; written by Tim Paterson of Seattle
Computer Products, for their prototype Intel 8086 based computer.

QDOS was based on Gary Kildall's CP/M, Paterson had bought a CP/M manual
and used it as the basis to write his operating system in six weeks, QDOS
was different enough from CP/M to be considered legal.

Microsoft bought the rights to QDOS for $50,000, keeping the IBM deal a
secret from Seattle Computer Products.

Gates then talked IBM into letting Microsoft retain the rights, to market
MS DOS separate from the IBM PC project, Gates proceeded to make a fortune
from the licensing of MS-DOS. &quot;

I'd be very interested in seeing the proof, on this one.  Of course, the
oldest version of DOS that I still have is 6.22; I lost my copies of
2.11, 3.30, and 5.0 a long time ago.

Similarly, when it came to adding networking to Windows, the code was stolen
(in typical Microsoft fashion).  The funny thing is that the TCP/IP stack
stolen from BSD was a badly /broken/ version.  This same code is /still/
inside the &quot;MS&quot; kernel, though there are some copyright messages about the
&quot;Regents of Berkeley University&quot; in /very/ small print these days.

There are no /real/ programmers left at MS these days - all the competent
ones left when &quot;Marketing&quot; started running the show a few years ago - so
there's nobody able to fix &quot;their&quot; TCP/IP stack or anything else
fundamental in the kernel.

The guts of the NT strain of Windows hasn't really changed much since the
mid-nineties because of their lack of programming talents, and all they've
done is /added/ bits to it.  With every iteration it just becomes more
convoluted &quot;spaghetti code&quot;.  It was /just/ /about/ maintainable back in
2000, but now it has grown to be a tangled mess.

Windows is now so badly broken, so expensive to install then maintain, and
so riddled with DRM and spyware that some of the biggest computer
manufacturers are trying /not/ to sell it!

Even though I did add GEOS to my C=64 around...
'87 I guess it was... the reason I bought the brand
of 386 I did was because it came with PCGeos installed
(by then referred to as GeoWorks rather than GEOS).
That's actually what I was referring to in the
comparison with Win3.1 and Win95.

It has since gone through renaming to NewDeal, and
then to its current name, Breadbox Ensemble.
http://www.breadbox.com/

The original GEOS for the C=64 was basically a
windowing system based on Motif, with not much in the
way of extras.  Database, spreadsheet, desktop pub,
etc. were available, but at extra charge.

By the time it got to the x86 platform, it was known
as GeoWorks Ensemble, and included all the good stuff
that we need to actually do stuff: desktop publishing,
spreadsheet, database, vector drawing program (which
btw, when coupled with a Canon BJ-10, was able to
output drawings accurate to within .01&quot;), solitaire,
and several other games, and desktop utilities like
calculator, etc.

To clarify, it was this PCGeos interface (minus
Ensemble), not the C=64 GEOS that was the basis of the
early '90s AOL interface.  As an aside, I cancelled my
AOL account in '95 /because/ AOL switched to Windows
as its foundation.

An option that's aimed at making Windows users feel
at home I guess.

When I tried the NewDeal beta (~97), it also had
