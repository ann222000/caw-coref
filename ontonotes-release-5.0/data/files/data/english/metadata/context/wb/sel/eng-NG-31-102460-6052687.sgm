The circumstance may soon arrive in which anti-war or human rights
protesters suddenly feel a burning sensation akin to touching a hot skillet
over their entire body. Simultaneously they may hear terrifying nauseating
screaming, which while not produced externally, fills their brains with
overwhelming disruption. Not only are both phenomena currently possible, but
designs for more powerful EMF technologies receive continuous funding from
the US Government.
This research explores the current capabilities of the US military to use
electromagnetic (EMF) devices to harass, intimidate, and kill individuals
and the continuing possibilities of violations of human rights by the
testing and deployment of these weapons. To establish historical precedent
in the US for such acts, we document long-term human rights and freedom of
thought violations by US military/intelligence organizations. Additionally,
we explore contemporary evidence of on-going government research in EMF
weapons technologies and examine the potentialities of continuing human
rights abuses.

In the 1950s and 60s the CIA began work to find means for influencing human
cognition, emotion and behavior. Through the use of the psychological
understanding of the human being as a social animal and the ability to
manipulate a subject's environment through isolation, drugs and hypnosis, US
funded scientists have long searched for better means of controlling human
behavior. This research has included the use of wireless directed
electromagnetic energy under the heading of "Information Warfare" and "Non
Lethal Weapons." New technological capabilities have been

developed in black budget projects1 over the last few decadesâ€” including the
ability to influence human emotion, disrupt thought, and present
excruciating pain through the manipulation of magnetic fields. The US
military and intelligence agencies have at their disposal frightful new
weapons, weapons that have likely already been covertly used and/or tested
on humans, both here and abroad, and which could be directed against the
public in the event of mass protests or civil disturbance.

Nations go to war to win, not to lose. They develop the know-how to
win, like we did when we developed the a - bomb to defeat Japan, which
we did, saving 1 million yank lives. Billions were spent to develop the
bomb and create a nuclear arsenal to protect ourselves and the free
world. It worked. Those kamikaze-minded suiciders quit after two nukes
showed them who's who. Now islam is going after us the same way,
killing, to date more than 2600 yanks as they perpetrate suicide
bombings.

We possess nuclear arms; our enemies do not, at least not yet. Yet they
behead us,  kill us, mutilate our dead bodies ,drag them thru the
streets of their cities,  threaten us if we bomb their so called "holy
cities", and subject us to humiliation for "abusing" the terrorists
we have captured as if we were supposed to coddle them instead. As this
goes on we huddle in fear of what terrorists will do next.

So what do we do? The unelected U.S. Supreme Court gives them
"terrorists rights"
to sue in our courts while "back home" they behead us. And we
prosecute our own soldiers for not coddling them.'
REAL SMART, isn't it? But this isn't the start of this insanity -

We could have won in Korea with nukes, but the liberals, panicking the
administration, claimed Russia and China would nuke us if we nuked
korea. the result: nukes sat idle, the war was a stalemate, 33,000
yanks died and now korea has come back with its own nukes, threatening
us which wouldn't have happened had we nuked them back then. Real
smart.

We could have won in Vietnam, but the liberals claimed nukes weren't
nice because too many of our enemy should die. the result: we lost the
war, and 59,000 yanks died, instead.
Real  smart.

We went to war in Iraq in 1990, but pulled out when it was half over,
leaving the regime in power. The result: another war had to be begun
all over, which we thought we won. but yanks die daily while nukes sit
idle. Some victory we "won". Real  smart

Now we are led blindly down the path to believe moslem nations  such as
Pakistan will assist us in rooting out alqueda. Al queda is paying
everyone off to be on their side. Even if they weren't, moslems
wouldn't act for us. Pakistan has nukes, supplied with red mercury
and technology by the Russian mafia. And do you think al queda has no
access to their nukes? Allied with Pakistan? Real smart.

Hw long will this "pearl harbor - 9/11 mentality" of sitting
back, doing nothing decisive and procrastinating, persist? Must we wait
until they blow us up, kill our children, brothers, sisters and parents
one by one before we finally realize that  we are justified in totally
annihilating them and ending their threat for once and for all?

In the meantime bandit and terrorist nations are clamoring to build
nukes. Who do you think they will use them against, Monaco? Do you
think these kamikaze minded maniacs will consider fallout  or any
similar considerations when they can and will nuke us, to make them
hesitate to nuke?   The liberals show photos of burnt Jap children to
move us not to nuke. But what will our children look like if they nuke
us? Do we have to await a third Pearl Harbor-9/11 before our sense of
self-preservation and the preservation of our posterity is awakened and
we excise the malignancy of islam from the face and body of mankind for
once and for all?

Must we apologize to them and coddle these terrorists and excuse
ourselves for conducting war? And must they get rights to sue in our
courts while they behead us?

Did we spend those billions  for marching  down Main St. on the fourth
of July, while yanks die daily and the arsenal sits idle or was there a
more appropriate purpose to build the nuclear arsenal and protect
ourselves? How long must we keep on huddling in fear and worry of what
they will do to us next, when nukes sit idle? MUST WE WAIT UNTIL THEY
NUKE US BEFORE WE WAKE UP?

What kind of fools are we?

What do we have here, another pathetic Zionist-nazi idiot?

Does this fool not understand that 80% of "muslim" beheadings are
Mossad-Masonic psy ops meant to stir up World War 3?

Does this fool not understand that the Vatican Church, ENCOURAGES the Black
Brotherhood Masonic Muslims to exterminate Jews so he can have the Zionists
actively start nuclear war?

Just another day in the lives of the ignorant, deranged, and hopeless.

Ignorance is no longer any exscuse....Period.

what do you suppose the world would be like if the hyper-hysterical US
didn't get a case of the vapors like a New Orleans trollop everytime someone
said NO! to the moguls that run it?

I'm not sure why the world 'cares' what the US 'thinks' - except it could
'nuke someone' ...

I still don't see what the yanks get out of that experience - except hated
by what's left forever and a whole bunch o' barren lands ... 300 000 000
people are about 1/3rd of China who has at LEAST as many nukes as the US
does... the US helped them get it...

why are you bitchin'?

if you don't want to play ball - stop letting the greedheads at the top
'share' the False Profits...

I know because they used the weapon on me this year. The Satellite systems
all around Washington D.C., Atlanta and San Fransisco use this technology
all the time. I learned this not just from the headaches it creates but by
meeting key people from NASA and the CIA who verified these are very true.
the worse part is that key Democrats know this and want it to continue no
matter what.

People  are dying everyday due to this and that is why my name is still not
being said on TV yet.  Once that happens all these black op projects go

*Sources close to U.S. intelligence pointed to a $29.6 million check
supposedly issued on October 22, 2004, *by Laurentian Bank in Montreal,
Canada, that was rumored by intelligence circles to have been used to pay
for the technicians who developed the software to rig the election. The
computer voting machine technicians and maintenance personnel involved with
the rigging were reported to have included Russians, Mexicans, and
Brazilians.

___________________________________________________________________________ _____

*Hard copy ***

Mailed to Omaha full text copy of an email from Paul S. Otellini of
Intel. (Paperwork from Sean S. Lennon, seanlen ... @cyberbless.com
&lt;http://20-248-c.onlinestoragesolution.com/ym/Compose?To=seanlen ... @cyberbless.com&gt;taken
while he went to the bathroom) This is dated from mid 2004 relating to
funding for specific development costs of a specialized BIOS in the chip set
for randomly placed voting machines to ensure the final vote tally on the
North Carolina U.S. Senate Race.

*Mailed to a plastic surgeon in Manhattan a 1999 full text email from Henry
D.G. Wallace to Joseph Klock verifying payment will continue on schedule for
recruiting and training costs.

*See ****

*Mailed to an investigator in London, two1998 full text emails. (Located
nearby to the Tube's Southern Route.) These emails verified payment to
Joseph Klock from Alan J. Weber-CitiBank.

*Mr. Weber's expertise was in technology transactions through the Pacific
Rim *

*Footnote added here: This is one piece of the evidence given to President
James Eartl Carter's attached Secret Service on January 13th 2004 at Cody's
bookstore *

*in San Fransisco.  President Carter somehow contacted President Gerald Ford
for I had several phone conversations with President Gerald Ford also. *

**

*Gerald  told me to not never stop **from revealing the truth and that it
was my job to make it so. He said and I quote "Tell the truth about what the
Zionist are doing in the Middle East and how they managed to fund Baypoint
School under the direct control from Mel Sembler and the Catholic Church,
specifically Pope John Paul II and the present day pope as well." Gerald
said no one else can do this without fear of dying. *

**

*He said President Carter is Christ like but that I am the true fifth
horseman. *

**

*I have done things that no man could ever do all by himself.*

**

*Please in the name of God the Father, God the Son, God the Holy Spirit,
Moses, *

*Allah, Jesus Christ, The Great Spirit and all that truly believe in Good
over Evil. *

**

*My name is Jeff Fisher and I am also Christ. The Christ that is talked
about in Revelations. Big Deal if I swear. Its a form of communications to
get a message across. Its like Rap music. Its like Jazz, Soul, Opera,
Country Music,Folk,Rock and Roll and any other kind of music to exist. To
emphasize a message regarding truth, nothing harmful or hateful in stating
the truth. *

***See ****

***This information is where Bev Harris has to investigate further. I don't
have the resources to undergo the connection between Diebold and Global
Election Systems but this where at least some of the financing for the 2000
general election originated from. VoteRemote was mentioned and absentee vote
tally. *

Sent original copy to London for safekeeping.

*(I have tried on several occasions to reach the person who has this
information) *

The person goes by the name of James Lawrence and he lives in Liverpool.
That is whom I sent that information on July 30, 2004.

This document was a banking record from the Cayman Islands. It had
handwritten notes on it linking a team of airplane mechanics who would be
used to sabotage Senator Paul Wellstone airplane to insure that he didn't
survive. The initials on the letter were JA –AJ

I was shocked to see this and realized that the letters possibly stood for
John Ashcroft, Attorney General. The note was dated January 2, 2002.

*Further names listed found on Dr. Piotr Blass computer in his home. *

*Discovered in August of 2004 while Dr. Blass was teaching at Key College in
Dania Beach, Florida over a period of days. *

One email mentioning psychological studies on election tactics that could be
used in 2000. This was dated on Dr. Blass's computer May 1, 2000. It was
sent from to Dr Cole
baypoin ... @aol.com&lt;http://20-248-c.onlinestoragesolution.com/ym/Compose?To=baypoin ... @aol.com&gt;

*One email sent to Charles Figley cfig ... @garnet.acns.fsu.edu
&lt;http://20-248-c.onlinestoragesolution.com/ym/Compose?To=cfig ... @garnet.acns.fsu.edu&gt;letting
him know that Jeff Fisher has obtained information from Sean to relay to
Kerry. Dated: July 27, 2004 *

*One email sent to Mike Razar
m ... @aol.com&lt;http://20-248-c.onlinestoragesolution.com/ym/Compose?To=m ... @aol.com&gt;letting
him know that Jeff Fisher has obtained information from Sean to
relay to Kerry. Dated: July 28, 2004*

*(What I don't understand is that Mike Razar was giving advice to Piotr on
having his son released from Growing Together. I remember overhearing Piotr
mentioning to his son, Oscar that Mike had a plan that would involve
physical force like Entebbe to free David.) *

*One email sent to Adam Michnik adam.mich ... @agora.pl
&lt;http://20-248-c.onlinestoragesolution.com/ym/Compose?To=adam.mich ... @agora.pl&gt;letting
him know that Jeff Fisher has obtained information from Sean and that David
would be release soon thanks to negotiations between Joe Klock and Mel
Sembler. *

*Dated: July 29, 2004*

*(I questioned Piotr about Joe Klock and his relationship with Mel Sembler
and having David released from Growing Together. Dr. Blass told me he needed
ten thousand dollars to get David released and he was contemplating
contacting Joe for the needed funds.) *

*(Why would a friend of Piotr's in Poland be concerned about the election
information that I obtained from Sean?) *

I understood the reason about seeking help for his son and why he might
consider soliciting financial help from friends and colleagues.
