It's that time of year again!  The little humming birds are out, and
thick......this (Houston) is one of their last stops before taking
their long journey across the Gulf of Mexico.  I was sitting out back
the other morning having my early morning cup-a-joe and a humming bird
whizzed right past my head.  I quickly dashed into the house and dug
out a feeder.  Filled it up with extra sweet nectar and hung it out
back near the patio.  In no time at all, there were about 6 birds
buzzing around it.  Everyone is hungry, but it seems that only one is
actually allowed to eat.  He's a gorgeous green bodied bird with a
white collar and a red throat, but he's such a little bossy pants.  He
runs everyone else off.  We finally got another feeder and hung it out
front.  Much to our amazement, bossy pants is now guarding both
feeders by flying back and forth over our roof top.

I'm not sure what else I can do.  Any advice would be more than
welcome.

Maybe a third feeder, so he can't possibly be in three places at once and
the other birds will get a chance to feed when he's guarding one of the
other two?

Male Ruby Throated Hummingbirds are territorial, but I wouldn't expect
much territorial activity during migration.  I suspect he is a local
resident, though maybe a temporary one.  If you want him to leave one
feeder alone, you will have to put it somewhere outside his territory.  I
have no idea other than trial and error for finding out what its limits
are.

I have only one active feeder - just outside a kitchen window that has an
inside shelf for the cats, and while I see territorial activity, it's
never as strong as you describe.

Thanks for replying Bobble.  Looks like at least one more feeder is
the only answer.

Bossy Pants' territory seems to be pretty big.  I guess I'll go talk
to a few of our neighbors and encourage them to all hang feeders also.

They will usually go for anything red.  They used to love and guard our
garage door pull handle.  Maybe hang a few red rubber balls around as decoys
for him.

He will eventually get tired.

Love ours and we get to enjoy them year round.  But we will get more as it
cools off up north.

Bonbon, we're just down the road near Austin and the hummers are gathering
here, too.  We've had lots all year (we're near some undeveloped land) and I
just added another feeder this month.  We have a bossy male but since I have
4 feeders now, he can't guard more than two at a time.  Hopefully what
follows will help you get more feeders up, economically. After experience
with lots of other kinds of feeders, I've switched to two kinds now, because
so many are so difficult to clean. The two found in these links are VERY
easy to clean--other than a sponge, all you need is a tiny brush, like an
inter dental brush, to quickly scrub out the feeding holes.  The first
feeder is from Wild Birds Unlimited and is more expensive but really great
if you can afford it.   They keep brushes at the cash register that they
sell for a buck. Neither of the feeders have a bunch of nooks or crannies to
harbor mold that inevitably grows in them after a couple of days in the
heat.

This one is super easy to clean, plastic will withstand dishwasher and use
of bleach.  Less expensive plastics will release toxins if you use bleach.
Built in water cup for &quot;ant moat/trap&quot;.
http://www.wbu.com/prod/guide/hummingbirds.htm

This one is small, cheaper, still very easy to clean.  Instead of putting in
hanging baskets we hang from the eaves. I found it for $5.95 at Garden
Ridge. http://www.perky-pet.com/feeders/index.asp Not as posh as the WBU one
but very cheap!

I've done a LOT of research to find a way to have the most feeders with the
least amount of work (we have four up now, two of each kind) and I wrote an
article for our neighborhood newsletter to share my experience with others.
The large feeders are kind of a moot point in the heat because they have to
be cleaned and changed daily because of mold growth.  With four feeders, the
hummers never empty the small ones in a couple of days so it's a waste of
nectar if you use really big ones.  If you want more info, including easy
recipes for making nectar and time tables for cleaning / refilling, etc.,
try:

We have &quot;Cat TV&quot; now with five channels, four are hummingbird feeders--one
front, two back and two side windows, and the fifth channel is a finch
feeder and bath outside another side window.  Great fun for the whole
family!

During most of the summer, my 48 ounce Perky Pet would be emptied in
about 24 hours.  The 12 ounce PP, just around the corner, would go for
about a week.  The climate here is cool enough so the nectar keeps for a
week or more.  I don't seem to have any bullies.  Activity has slowed
down a lot so I guess migration has depleted my birds.

So jealous!  Yes, a friend of ours says his large Perky gets covered with
hummers feeding at the same time--all sitting on the perches around it
together! He, too, lives in cooler climes...

We have Ruby Throats and Black Chins, here...what do you have in NH?

Only Ruby Throats here.  I enjoyed your slide show.  Was that a
HummZinger feeder?  I notice that they weren't using the perch.  With
mine I added a closer perch on two sides which they seem to prefer.  The
HZ doesn't get as much use as the big Perky Pet.

Duck!!  It's amazing how much aggression Nature seems to pack into the

Would it be feasible to hang up some more feeders?  He can only eat from one

Thanks for the kind words... have a new male in the area--If I can get him
at the right angle it will be a nice photo up!  The feeder is from Wild
Birds Unlimited.  Somebody makes them for them, can't remember who...

Trying to scrub the mold out of the nooks and crannies in the big PP drove
me batty. I'll never go back to those...I've given them away. Sometimes they
perch, sometimes they don't.  I've switched to those and the really small,
really cheap Perky Pet feeders that are intended for hanging baskets (about
$6) as both are quick and easy to clean, and, like I said, around here they
don't empty them fast enough to go with a big feeder.  The ones from WBU are
also dishwasher safe and since we have fire ants down here, the built in ant
trap rocks! WBU also has some larger ones, same style, I just stick with the
small ones.

Got this link from one of my sisters this morning.  If you like
humming birds (who doesn't?) you'll love this one.

This is truly amazing. Be sure to click on NEXT PAGE at the bottom of
each page; there are 5 pages in all. A lady found a hummingbird nest
and got pictures all the way from the egg to leaving the nest. It took
24 days from birth to flight. Because you'll probably never in your
lifetime see this again, enjoy; and please share.  The photography is
wonderful!!

People who say you can't get too many hummbirds are wrong.  I don't have
trees around my rented house and can only hang the feeders from my porch.
Yesterday, my son counted fifty nine birds trying to feed.  I buy sugar by
the 50 poung bag  as is.  I love these birds, the cats don't,  I am just
going to get a couple of more feeders to finish the summer.  Wish someone
would design a truely big feeder that is posted in the ground.

I used to love having them around  the cats went nuts when I did.  What I
did was took an old coat rack  with the extended arms and legs.  I got it
from a thrift story for about $10.00.   I buried the legs so it would not
topple over.  The arms stuck out a good  foot  more than enough room for a
feeder to hang  I had 6 feeders hanging from it.  Since 2004 hurricanes I
never put it back up when it was blow over and some arms were broken.  I
miss having those little sugar burners around.

&gt;&gt; Got this link from one of my sisters this morning.  If you like
&gt;&gt; humming birds (who doesn't?) you'll love this one.

&gt;&gt; This is truly amazing. Be sure to click on NEXT PAGE at the bottom of
&gt;&gt; each page; there are 5 pages in all. A lady found a hummingbird nest
&gt;&gt; and got pictures all the way from the egg to leaving the nest. It took
&gt;&gt; 24 days from birth to flight. Because you'll probably never in your
&gt;&gt; lifetime see this again, enjoy; and please share.  The photography is
&gt;&gt; wonderful!!

I would be lost without them.  There is a small factory across from me and I
admit to showing off a bit.  I take a small feeder, fill it, stand very
still and let the birds land on my hand to eat.  As  I don't see well, I am
always going out the door and running into one of them!  I don't know who
gets startled the most!

&gt;I used to love having them around  the cats went nuts when I did.  What I
&gt;did was took an old coat rack  with the extended arms and legs.  I got it
&gt;from a thrift story for about $10.00.   I buried the legs so it would not
&gt;topple over.  The arms stuck out a good  foot  more than enough room for a
&gt;feeder to hang  I had 6 feeders hanging from it.  Since 2004 hurricanes I
&gt;never put it back up when it was blow over and some arms were broken.  I
&gt;miss having those little sugar burners around.

&gt;&gt; People who say you can't get too many hummbirds are wrong.  I don't have
&gt;&gt; trees around my rented house and can only hang the feeders from my porch.
&gt;&gt; Yesterday, my son counted fifty nine birds trying to feed.  I buy sugar
&gt;&gt; by the 50 poung bag  as is.  I love these birds, the cats don't,  I am
&gt;&gt; just going to get a couple of more feeders to finish the summer.  Wish
&gt;&gt; someone would design a truely big feeder that is posted in the ground.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Thanks for the kind words... have a new male in the area--If I can get

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;at the right angle it will be a nice photo up!  The feeder is from Wild
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Birds Unlimited.  Somebody makes them for them, can't remember who...

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Trying to scrub the mold out of the nooks and crannies in the big PP
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;drove
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;me batty. I'll never go back to those...I've given them away. Sometimes
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;they
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;perch, sometimes they don't.  I've switched to those and the really
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;small,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;really cheap Perky Pet feeders that are intended for hanging baskets
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;(about
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;$6) as both are quick and easy to clean, and, like I said, around here
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;they
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;don't empty them fast enough to go with a big feeder.  The ones from WBU
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;are
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;also dishwasher safe and since we have fire ants down here, the built in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;ant
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;trap rocks! WBU also has some larger ones, same style, I just stick with
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;small ones.

I'm guessing you.  If you have been that active in feeding them, they can
get very demanding.  We have had more than a few over the years that will
attack.  Especially if the feeders need service.

Anyone that equated tiny with timid hasn't been around the little monsters.

I call them monsters, but I'm the one they buys and &quot;cooks&quot; the sugar water
and rigs the lines for the hangers to we don't have to climb to change them.
I use eye hooks and cleats to fix it so I can raise and lower the feeders to
people level.  Charlie is the one with the patience to clean and sterilize
the feeders so they don't get moldy too soon.

We use PP feeders.  I've got to remember to pick up some more yellow plastic
flowers.

Yepper, they can reck those little flowers pretty fst sometime.  I have the
kind where you just unscrew the bottle from the top with the handing piece
and fill.  Yes, they get demanding, hitting the screen dor if I don't get
there fast enough.  Will get Lee to tell you about the hummingbird and the
cat.
