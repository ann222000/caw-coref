Lets say I've got this mapped out

map.resources :owners do |owners|
owners.resources :possessions

This gives me routes looking like this:

.../owners/:id/
.../owners/:owner_id/possessions/:id/

I'm very frustrated that the routes do not look like this:

.../owners/:owner_id/
.../owners/:owner_id/possessions/:possession_id/

This causes problems when I want to share code between these
controllers that uses either.

params[:id] &lt;-- meaning the id of the owner
params[:owner_id]

Lord this gets my goat and jives my Johnson the wrong way.

Have you taken a look at makes_resourceful?  Even if you don't use the
plugin itself, you can nick its code for things like the
current_object method.
