Alrighty, here's a picture so something I picked up awhile back. It is
brass and stands 21 inches high and is 16 inches wide at the fattest point. On
the second photo you can see the rather primitive hand scratched decoration on
the punched metal.
Some questions for you to ponder (and I will not make fun of ANY
answer...you saw my answer on the carved horn thingie, right?)
1. What is it?
2. How old is it?
3. Where might one be found?
4. Where was it made?

I have some answers but I don't have them all (rephrase that....I don't have
all the answers).

"/> I say, Fobby! That thingy is certainly delightfully ugly. That's a
compliment, really.

Anyway, it must be middle-eastish? It's certainly not European, and it
doesn't look Chinese or Japanese either. I haven't been to the Colonies for
a while, but the last time I visited Fl. I didn't come across anything quite
like that.

1. A pierced metal vase (usually copper or copper alloy, sometimes
silvered)
2. Impossible to say without really studying it, same patterns made
today
3. Anywhere a tourist brought it home to!!
4. &quot;The Middle East&quot;
5. (Not asked) $15/10ukp tops in my book

As you guessed these are not great water carriers!!! but are decorative
and can look better with a candle in or dried flowers.

My speciality is European metalware and I avoid this stuff like the
plague so could well be completely wrong!!

Cheers

Jon

The move is a couple thousand miles, and will take 2-3 days to pack,

two cats, two dogs, and two teenage boys. No appraisals neccessary on

measurements...it is quite large) and form are pleasing. It is open on the
top and open on the bottom. Like a lamp hurricane, the bottom should fit down
into something. Putting dried flowers in it would be fine if you plan to
throw a match in for a little bonfire....you really cannot see into it. It is
for some light source, I doubt incense. I think it might look cool around
the new pool (wish I had eight of them) with a honkin' big candle in it.

"/> Yes, Insurance purposes. The appraisal took awhile but since I was paying
by the hour I asked her not to do item by item on the smalls (the glassware
would have taken maybe a year). I am not worried about things being
stolen....I have been relocated cross country a couple of times before and the
companies do a very nice job. I am mostly worried about things being broken.
So I had her skip the linens (another year saved) and anything that I
considered no big deal (my sons beanie babies, etc....heh, heh).

in having an item proffessionally appraised, doesn't this include
identifying the item in question before placing a value? IOW who made
it, what is it, where was it made, why is it worth the appraised value,
and when was it made?

I'm really curious how one would collect on a damaged item simply
because a proffessional appraiser said $900 on the whatsis.

"/> A come-on. Good gad are people really that thin skinned they can't take a bit

they can't take a bit of stick or a few fun-poking jags from time to time. I
think some folk in this NG have a tendency to take this and themselves all far
too seriously.

Jon can speak for himself. But if you found his comments off putting then a
few weeks spent amongst the dealers and collectors over here wouldn't go a
miss ... you may even be gob smacked by some of the comments.

So what do ya want ... &quot;old yes darling that is just wonderful, yer so lucky
to have such a pretty little piece, I'm all green.&quot;

You described the pierced work on your brazier (??) as &quot;primitive&quot; - well I
personally wouldn't have use the word &quot;primitive&quot; to describe that pierced
work, more like, just rather poor workmanship. Primitive to me conjures up a
whole different ball game. And IMHO I would never in a million years place it
turn of the century, that pierced work just looks rather modern and touristy,
but that opinion of course is based upon looking at a picture on a 15 inch
computer screen and pulling on a few passed experiences. Now I ain't
fun-poking, just inputting with a bit of constructed criticism. Does it put
you off?

There's a shop here in Sheffield UK that specialises in modern, old looking,
distressed furniture which has something very similar to yours! So I would
say it's just for decoration and serves no real function, is quite modern
and was made in Indonesia.

"/> Ronnie,
Guide books had absolutely no baring on my questions. If as you say
however, an item can be appraised on it's subjective &quot;decorative
appeal&quot;, would a PEPA (proffessional Elvis Presley Appraiser) be able
to place a $900 value on a black velvet air brushed painting of 'The
King?' if he really thought it was beautiful? and if so, would an
insurance company pay out $900 based on such a claim?

I believe, (perhaps incorrectly) a proffessional appraiser must have at
least SOME factual background on an item to place a value, other than,
&quot;_I_ think it's pretty.&quot;

Perhaps a beautiful, unsigned, 6 foot bronze statue of a mermaid with no
provenance, might come under such an exclusion as you suggest, but
surely this situation would be extremely rare imho.

If subjective decorative value was all anyone needed for insurance
purposes, well, everything displayed in this ng would be priceless to
SOMEBODY!

"/> Ok, THIS is embarrassing. aaaa9, rather than aaaa1 and all that sort of
thing. Sorry, Ronnie old chap. I am so used to you picking on me, I have
activated autodefence here. I stand corrected and in shame, and politely
request people use some sort of signature.

Correct wording of previous msg should thus be:

&quot;Are you bored J, old chappesse? No friends? Nothing to do than to keep
trying to provoke arguments?&quot;

Or something like that.

Again, Ronnie; I have wronged you, I'm a fool and an idiot etc, etc.

Cheers,
C.

&gt;insurance company pay out $900 based on such a claim?

"/> I really don't see the problem with the insurance company, have you had an
unpleasant experience or some problems with insurance companies?

If a value is presented to an insurance company and the object specifically
specificated as an addition to an existing policy, (or a new policy taken out)
based upon the valuation and the opinion of an approved and acceptable
appraiser and the insurance company *accepts* that risk, for which the client
pays the appropriate additional premium, what is the big deal?

What hell difference does it make, for insurance purposes, if the object is
over-valued? The risk has been accepted and the premiums have been applied.

The premium for the risk will be based upon the submitted value. I think it's
immaterial as to the real worth of the object. Heaven's above ALL insurance
valuations are over-estimates, or at least way over the REAL worth of the
objects.

Of course this is in relationship to object that are subjective, as in the
case of antiques and collectibles. I'm not implying the likes of your Sony
Discmaster or your 42 inch wide-screen are subjective objects. Nor am I
suggesting that one should over-value merely to make the insured object
suddenly and mysteriously disappear so as to make a fraudulent claim. I am
saying that an object can be valued based upon its subjective decorative
appeal alone. And in many, many cases that is precisely what an appraiser may
have to do, and IMO, in the case of Fayette's object that is exactly what her
appraiser did.

Now catch a grip of gad sake, Mari. How in the name of hell would an appraiser
ever manage in a month of Sundays to ascertain all the info you cited in the
case of Fayette's brazier ... &quot;oh yes Sir, sixth backstreet on the left, third
door on the right, the peasant boy with the dark hair, he's open every Friday
afternoon, a fine maker of unsigned braziers and mystery objects.&quot;

End of story.

The insurance rider moving from one town to another was a fair estimate on
my part and accepted by my insurance agent. Too bad if I under estimated

needed. You can over insure yourself if the mood strikes you. The moving

C,
No one is giving appraisals here. This is NOT rec. appraisals. This is a
discussion group...plain and simple. Don't attach more importance than is
necessary. We do have members that are extremely knowledgeable in what they
sell or collect. I respect what they have commented on. There are members
that make wrong opinions, but so what? This again is an antiques discussion
group. If anyone is coming here and expecting free, hold up in court,
appraisals then they wandered into the wrong pub.
Chill, put your feet up and hang out if you want, or discuss like the rest
of us.We don't know you enough to like or dislike you yet.

&gt;I believe, (perhaps incorrectly) a proffessional appraiser must have at
&gt;least SOME factual background on an item to place a value, other than,
&gt;&quot;_I_ think it's pretty.&quot;

"/> Alrighty, I fished up the papers. It is listed as: &quot;Victorian pierced
brass (large) shade in form of a hurricane&quot; oh...and I misquoted. It's only
valued at $800.

backtracking on Mari's post:

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Guide books had absolutely no baring on my questions. If as you say
&gt;however, an item can be appraised on it's subjective &quot;decorative
&gt;appeal&quot;, would a PEPA (proffessional Elvis Presley

&gt;to place a $900 value on a black velvet air brushed painting of 'The
&gt;King?' if he really thought it was beautiful? and if so, would an
&gt;insurance company pay out $900 based on such a claim?

"/> I did not hire a proffessional pierced brass person. I hired a general
appraiser. I do not doubt that her expertise is somewhat limited on any number
of items. It was an insurance appraissal.....I do not expect to have to claim
*any* losses at all, and if I did have to claim any loss I doubt I would bother
to break my neck trying to find another one of these.
My appraiser has been in business for a few decades. She handles
estates all the time. Because of the volume of stuff she handles she does, in
fact, have some idea if the item will be difficult to replace. I bet she
rarely sees items that can be assigned &quot;provenance&quot;, and even signed artwork
can only be subjectively valued in relation to other known works by same
artist. Etc., etc., etc. What is the degree of error? Well.....probably
alot.
If you go to an auction that has catalogs with values listed you will
realize that these are merely one person's idea (and this an educated Antique
person...as opposed to a person educated about antiques, heh) of what an item
should bring. Many, many times the item will fall below that estimate, and
many many times it will rise well above the range that is listed. Does that
mean the auctioneer/appraiser is out to lunch? Not at all....it means it's
an inexact science and many factors may influence the perceived value.
I've also had my house appraised by several people (who specialize in
home appraisals, of course) and there has been as much as 85K difference in
their opinions. Does that mean one is right and one is wrong? Not
really....but you can be sure that &quot;subjective decorative value&quot; did indeed
play a part.
So there ya have it. Don't run, don't duck, all's fair in
Rec.antiques....at least all that you've offered.
See ya,

Anyhow, NO! the above in your link is not the kind of thing I was thinking

still not terribly like your example, but maybe a bit closer than the pot and
pans. At least it details the brazier a little better.

http://www.primenet.com/~zvwhite/

Now those lecherous Romans whilst laying about eating grapes and drinking
plonk .. er .. maybe that was the Greeks, anyway 'em as well, would have use
the brazier to heat the place. And not only that, but would have also placed
some incense, even Frankincense, onto the burning charcoal, which would have
wafted sweetly around the room.

Of course the brazier wasn't confined to clay or earthenware, but made in
iron, brass and bronze. I suppose even that fire basket once used by the old
night-watchman could loosely have been described as a brazier.

&quot; You gave me a silken cushion,
A Persian perfume-brazier;
You gave me your laugh and your joy,
Your young flesh and your coursing blood.

You gave me your vacations,
Tears as you bade me farewell,
Knowing letters of love
And compromising portraits.

You gave me bouquets of roses,
Your tall white body on my crumpled bed.
I am perplexed by all these things,
Overwhelmed by all your gifts.

O dear, extravagant child,
You have given me all, well I know,
Except the tiny little word
That would have reaped me such reward!&quot;

Hi,

I thought I'd better have a look at this long thread even if I didn't have time for
anything else ( I got curious;~)) If your appraiser belongs to any of the
recognized groups they could not appraiser that charcoal starter without filling
out a statement of limiting conditions otherwise they leave themselves open to
lawsuits under due diligence.

&gt;&gt;any
&gt;&gt;sort of an appraisal or even suggesting a valuation.

&gt; :-p (that's me sticking my tongue out at you.)

&gt;&gt;Anyhow, NO! the above in your link is not the kind of thing I was thinking
&gt;&gt;about. Here's a link more along the lines of my train of thought, although,
&gt;&gt;still not terribly like your example, but maybe a bit closer than the pot and
&gt;&gt;pans. At least it details the brazier a

&gt;&gt;little better.

&gt;&gt;http://www.primenet.com/~zvwhite/

&gt; I still like my (found) site. Looks like a bunch of omolette pans with legs.
&gt; Who knew? And while your (found) site is interesting...you're right...still
&gt; looks way different from what I have. I think Jim pretty much agreed with you
&gt; on the charcoal and heat idea, though. And, in fact, you can buy those
&gt; earthenware ones for your patio in the Southwest. Same shape as what I've got,
&gt; even, but usually on legs.
&gt; Thank you for finding the site for me.

Sorry, LF, but that is a ridiculous valuation. Even if this was a finely
crafted 18th C piece, it couldn't get near that sort of price (in the UK
at least)

It is too thin, and too pierced, to be a brazier: it would overheat and
dangerous ashes would be everywhere. (I buy English shepherd's braziers
which are made of thick metal and have few holes).

Middle Eastern metalware is very unpopular mainly because there is so
much of it, it is mostly poor quality and is hard to date.

This piece looks like it could be from 1900-1920 and if it had handles
or hooks, would be a candle lantern. I think it is simply a decorative
item.

I also think it is really unfair of your 'appraiser' to get your hopes
up like that. I have seen hundreds of similar items for sale and the
best price I can recall one selling for at auction, of this age and
quality, was about 45 ukp/$60.

**Please** take this to a museum or famous auction house. If they
maintain the high value then I'm starting to fill the container today...

"/> Ronnie, THANKS! Honestly, I knew nothing at all about &quot;braziers&quot; or any of
this stuff before I started this thread.
As to Jon's comment about my appraiser getting my hopes up: Jon, I hope
for world peace. I hope the realtors will call before they use the lockbox and
find out I'm still in my pajamas. I hope my sons have enough sense to stay
away from naughty girls. I really have not placed much hope in this strange
metal item. I don't expect it to fund my retirement or even pay for a big &quot;see
ya&quot; party. I am not convinced it is worth any more than you say it is. But I
am fairly determined to find another one so I can define it correctly.
I purchased this item from a bohemian style (gosh, I should be an
auctioneer with a description like that) friend. He, in vagabond fashion,
often brings things to me. He gave me quite a story on this one and I
didn't want to buy it. I *really* didn't want to buy it. It looked like Pier
1 imports to me. But I suspected that his sustenance came from my pockets, so
I did. I figured it was money down the drain, under the bridge, and into
the pond. I figured it was my charitable contribution for the week (trust me,
I didn't pay $25 for it). I've kept it at home for quite some time now
because I won't sell something if I don't know what it is. Imagine my
surprise when someone else placed a value of $800 on it! Well, I'm still
not convinced. But I am intrigued. I'd already been trying to figure out how
to make it into a table base (hey, where do you think these wacky ideas come
from?)
So that's the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. Btw,
Jon, I've found a group of antique dealers that trip over to Newark once or
twice a year and I'm thinking of joining up with them for the April jaunt. Is
it worth it?
See ya,
LF

Last time I moved my baby grand suffered a scratch along the side. Turns
out the &quot;proffessional movers&quot; had a nail sticking out of their piano
board...the board that the piano rests upon while they move it in and out.
Quelle suprise! How did that get there (exclamations all around)! So then I
had to come up with a number in my head for reimbursement from the insurance
company. Well.....me being a fair soul, and knowing the piano had a
*scratch*, it wasn't destroyed or unusueable or anything like that....I came up
with a fairly random number (which was probably low and would never have paid
for true restoration) and no one questioned it.
For me to make a claim on this metal item they will have to back the truck
over it or something. It's really academic, in my opinion.

"/> =====

Ronnie,
I have on many occasions thanked you personally for your responses to
my posts. When a number of people take part in a thread, I thank all who
have taken the time to respond. This seems to be a way of saving
bandwidth over personally thanking each and every opinion I receive.
I find it ironic that when I thanked you for the information on the
'clockwork' thread, that I was attacked by another regular with the
same &quot;T was right about you!&quot;
You totally ignored my direct question to you in that thread, choosing
instead to do exactly what you're accusing me of, posting via third
party to ridicule, defame and in general, just be downright mean.

In this particular thread, I think you got caught on the fence. Rather
than let anyone think you and I could possibly be thinking alike, here
comes the attack. Of course Jon and Richard are allowed to voice
similar thoughts as mine, without having the &quot;reverent T's revenge&quot;
coming back to haunt them.

I directed my questions to LF and you chose to repond. I've got no
problem with that, but again you chose to speak 'down' to me for daring
to ask the questions in the first place. Any newcomers here who are not
familiar with my &quot;disgraceful past&quot; will probably be more amused at the
thought of YOU &quot;composing a courteous reply&quot;. Let it be known, you
have! Let it also be known, I let you know I appreciated it in my
&quot;novice&quot; (I&quot;M snide??) little antique way.

One of the main reasons I, (and I'm sure many others,) come back to this
board is, Ronnie, because of you. I've learned tons from you, and
laughed out loud at your sense of humor. You're an arrogant arsehole,
but the backbone of rec antiques none-the-less. I think you like me a
little bit too....no matter how many times you plonked me in your
killfile, I still
seem to be worth responding to.

Hi Ronnie,

The Appraisal associations over here follow the USPAP format (Uniform Standards of
Professional Appraisal Practise) which lays out in detail how an appraisal is carried
out, if you have any dealings with tax , insurance or probate work it's becoming a
must to follow the format. Under the USPAP an appraiser is required to list any
limiting factors or conditions under which the appraisal is completed, in this case
the appraiser should have either contacted a another appraiser qualified to appraise
this item or state in the report how they came to their valuation and the methods
used. The insurance issue to me is a secondary consideration, as is &quot; joining the
club&quot; it's more a matter of doing the job right in the first place. If anyone is
interested I'll dig up the url for the personal property appraisals guidelines.

Imagine my

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; surprise when someone else placed a value of $800 on it! Well, I'm
still
&gt; not convinced. But I am intrigued. I'd already been trying to figure out
how
&gt; to make it into a table base (hey, where do you think these wacky ideas
come
&gt; from?)

is the exception to the rule that you shouldn't sell to your appraiser. ;-)

&quot;Perhaps you would accept this $800 brazier as part of your fee, Mr.
Appraiser.&quot;

a pop, they'll be great around the pool with candles in them. Eh wot? Jon
hasn't found any yet? Me either, go figure.
Btw, I'm positive it's not a brazier.
