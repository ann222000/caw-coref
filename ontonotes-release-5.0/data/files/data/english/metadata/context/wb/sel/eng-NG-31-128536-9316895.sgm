I've been using ZiddlyWiki with the 2.0.11 core and am wondering about my
upgrade options.  I haven't tracked this mailing list for months now, and
I've lost track of the landscape.  My last memory is of some developments
for demand-driven tiddler downloading (ajax-based, I suppose).  I was
excited about that direction, as my TW is getting big.  Could someone
summarize or point me to a summary of the status of server-based TW,
including incremental/demand-driven downloading (and uploading)?

Thanks!   - Conal

Here's what I know.

There is a ZW 2.2:

http://groups.google.com/group/TiddlyWiki/browse_thread/thread/3e33d0...

It doesn't seem to be fully functional, e.g. the import doesn't work:

http://groups.google.com/group/TiddlyWiki/browse_thread/thread/fcfe39...

ZW 2.2 does not have load on demand.

MTS ( www.minytiddlyserver.com ) doesn't have load on demand either, but
it DOES save only those tiddlers that have changed since the last
save, making saving really fast.  As far as I can tell, after using
MTS for a few weeks, it's quite stable.  And MTS allows mulitple
users.  No revisions function, because it doesn't have a database, but
if one thinks of a multi-user TW as a structured dialogue, rather than
a collaborative writing project, the lack of revisions may not a
serious problem.  (Of course, a bulletin board has a structure too,
but with TW it's easy for users to add links, tag, etc.)

For really big documents, load on demand will probably still be
necessary, because of initial load time.  Zipping things does improve
load speed, but then the zipping conflicts with MTS or UploadPlugin -
so you'd be back to local edit then upload.

On zipping TWs:

http://groups.google.com/group/TiddlyWiki/browse_thread/thread/9943bc...

There was discussion of load-on-demand for TW itself, a while back
(though I'm not really sure what that meant), but my impression is
that it is on the backburner.  If you weren't around for this
discussion, it's at:

http://groups.google.com/group/TiddlyWiki/browse_thread/thread/64dbf9...

ZiddlyWiki seems to have been more-or-less abandoned, at least for the
time being.  I think Bob's been plain old too busy.  Even CoolCold
from ccTiddly has been very quiet lately.  So there's not much
happened on server-hosted TWs from the &quot;old school&quot; server sides.

There is some sweet support in tw2.2 for server stuff, though, and I
think (the awesome) BidiX has done something with WebDAV.

Not sure if that's what you're asking for..

Hi Andrew.  Thanks very much for the summary, which helped me a lot in
getting oriented.  I've now switched over to the latest TW, and I'll give
MiniTiddlyServer a try.  I'm fine with lack of revision history, as I have
my own backup system and usually compose in emacs in a textual twee file
anyway.

I'd love to hear from anyone working on or intending to work on
load-on-demand.

Cheers,  - Conal

Glad to know.  Thanks, Daniel.

I'm curious about BidiX's WebDAV-based saving.  From a quick look at
http://tiddlylab.bidix.info/#WebDAVSaving , I'm guessing that it sends an
entire TW, rather than just changes.  I can't imagine how to do anything
incremental without a server-side component.

You are right Conal, WebDAVSavingPlugin permits to a TiddlyWiki accessed
over HTTP to use the WebDAV protocol. It works exactly in the same way that
saveChanges does, but on a website provided that it is WebDAV enabled.

This &quot;save to webDAV&quot; doesn't require any kind of ServerSide component and
uses the standard TiddlyWiki Options :
* chkSaveBackups
*chkAutoSave
*chkGenerateAnRssFeed
*chkSaveEmptyTemplate
*txtBackupFolder&gt;&gt;

The main functionalities are :
*save backup
*save RSS
*save an empty.html
*save main file

The plugin also checks for WebDAV capability of the webserver and creates
remote folders if needed by the backup folder option (specified as a
relative path).

You will find it at http://tiddlywiki.bidix.info/#WebDAVSavingPlugin and
also in the svn repository at
http://trac.tiddlywiki.org/browser/Trunk/contributors/BidiX/plugins/W...

For now, this plugin is in Version 0.2.1 and needs some enhancements to make
it more easy to use and  more reliable.
