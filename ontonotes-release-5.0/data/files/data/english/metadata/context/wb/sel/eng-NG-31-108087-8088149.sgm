They are a disgrace to there parents and grandparents because I can believe

Hi, Bill. What's a nice senior citizen like you doing in a dump like
this?

It's full of computerized barflies who will just waste your time with
arguments just for the sake of arguing with you, like some drunk who's
had too many but keeps on raving at you.

They will ask questions that sound like they want information when
they really just want to start an argument, or they will challenge
everything you say just to &quot;win&quot; a pointless debate.

Here's a list of people to avoid responding to:

Have you checked out rec.motorcycles.harley? This group has nothing on
that bunch. I finally gave up on them about 2 years ago after
realizing after 3 years of daily reading/posting there that getting a
straight answer to a serious question was almost impossible, or rather
that any sort of inquiry might generate dozens of responses, only one
or 2 or which would be serious and the rest would be a bunch of
smart-asses.
They will also countenance any amount of OT posting about subjects
that interest THEM, but bring up something they don't want to talk
about and get flooded with &quot;Why are you talking about that HERE?&quot;
flames.
And it's like the Marines: the new people coming in are nice and OK to
try to talk with, but by the time they have been there a while and
have picked up on the tenor of the group they can't wait to be among
the first to jump on some newbie with all the silly &quot;rules&quot;, so almost
everybody in there ends up being a jerk regardless of how they started
out.
When I realized I had killfiled about half the regulars and just
hadn't gotten around to the other half I quit wasting my time and
unsubscribed to that group.

Bill, it's really no different from passing people when you're walking down
the street.

About one in every ten of them are either psychotic, habitual criminals,
utterly bigoted  -or all of the above rolled up in one-  but under normal
conditions you never have a chance to find out which ones are nuts and which
ones aren't.

Under Usenet conditions, where they can hide in semi-anonymity behind a
computer screen, the nuts open up and spew the things that they'd never
*dare* say to anyone in a face-to-face confrontation, and actually this is a
*GOOD* thing.

It pretty much lets you know right up in front who's a fruitcake and who
isn't, and this lets you avoid that awful moment that occasionally occurs in
real life when you discover that your best friend's mother  -who you've
known for *years*-  actually believes with all her heart that Armageddon is
going to occur next week and that only the members of her tiny cult are
going to be saved by the flying saucer men.

Better to know who the nuts are right from the beginning. *MUCH* better!

Oh really? So is that a pitch fork behind your back or are you just happy to see
me? As for the rest of you lot...back off with the cooking utensils, put the
good china BACK in the cabinet and calm down. I ain't dead yet.

&gt; Hi, Bill. What's a nice senior citizen like you doing in a dump like
&gt; this?

&gt; It's full of computerized barflies who will just waste your time with
&gt; arguments just for the sake of arguing with you, like some drunk who's
&gt; had too many but keeps on raving at you.

&gt; They will ask questions that sound like they want information when
&gt; they really just want to start an argument, or they will challenge
&gt; everything you say just to &quot;win&quot; a pointless debate.

Right, Bill. You'll notice that that is my real name, Tim Morrow, and
that I've lived at the same Herndon, Virginia, address for 25 years
and posted to rec.motorcycles under the same handle
(tomor ... @erols.com; my old e-mail address, that finally had to be
dumped because of all the spammers) for eleven years, and that many of
reeky's long-time denizens have met with me and ridden with me in real
life, all over the entire country, and even in Canada and Hawaii.

You can ask &quot;Two Wheels Good, Four Wheels Bad&quot; what his real name is,
who has met him, who can vouch for him, what kind of motorcycle he
rides, where he lives, and can you meet him for a beer and to talk
life, politics, and motorcycles in real life, and guess what?  You
won't get a straight answer out of the asshole.

Drop by any time you're in the Washington, D.C. area; you're welcome,
and I'll buy the first round.

LOL, too true.....the problem is getting it home/dried/sorted without
being snapped. &quot;Personal use, your honor, for painkilling
properties&quot;.....$500 fine and only just kept my gun licence. Funny how
growing pot doesn't really annoy the police until you inform them
there's a shooter in the boot. After all, I was out hunting, the plants
were a sideline. But it put things in perspective about which hobbies I
enjoy the most, and I'd put shooting above motorcycling (by about
1mm....which equates to about half of fuck all in the imperial measurement).

I agree, except I am sorely tempted to add my list. Problem is my loony bin is

Several years ago I used to have a motor-paper route. Just to make ends meet
while the wife went to nightschool. anyway, we had a female Mal/Siberian mix
and a Lab/Shepard mix. At 3 in the morning as I folded my 400 papers I would
let the dogs out to run the neighborhood. Everybody in the area knew my dogs
and tolerated them 'cause they were, for the most part, well behaved. They
would go from house to house and see if they could get any handouts or a
good scratchin' from the neighbors. At 3 am however, they did a Dr. Jeckyll
and Mr. Hide transformation and became seek and destroy, cat killing 'bots.
The way I found out was twofold. First, I had noticed a few of those little
signs on the communal mailbox about missing cats, and, second, one night
while folding I heard some unholy screech up the street and looked out the
garage just in time to see some poor kitty get pulled apart as each dog had
an end and wouldn't let go. Pretty gross.

I kept the dogs in from then on.
