No, science is just unable to accurately assess a lot of stuff.

Like the age of a rock formed in a volcano in Hawaii in 1959 (science
said it was 150,000,000 years old!)

Or if john p actually exists

John, you might just be a figment of my imagiation, nothing more!

Right you are.  You could be having a very bad dream.  But in this
dream we can still measure and think about the apparent reality.  In
this reality is there a provable correlation between prayer and
external reality.  Prayer may have some value even if there is no
science backing it.  Prayer has seemed to work for me, but it may be
caused by something else.

I wonder if there has been some kind of study to show statistically if
prayers affect the world.  This is helpful to know because if a prayer
works it would be nice to know why.  Was it a coincidence, or was it
because the prayer helped the mind to create the reality change.
Prayer may work because we believe it does and it has nothing to do
with a higher power.  Or maybe prayer does nothing--I don't believe
that.

I don't think you could do a valid statistical study of the results of
prayer for the following reason. . .

You would have to find some way to quantify the differences between
praying for things that would be pleasing to God in your particular
life and prayers that might be for things that would not please God in
the long run.  God knows of your future circumstances, but you do not,
and you would find it impossible to include those future circumstances
in knowing how many of the prayers should (and would) be answered by
God.  Quantifying stuff like that would be impossible.

&quot;Science,&quot; or individual scientists?  There's a difference, you know.
Science is an institution consisting of the conglomerate work of many

I notice that Mormons like to toss out a lot of creationist propaganda

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

The old chestnut that nothing can be proven, so we're free to believe
whatever we want is one of the oldest and least supportable anti-
intellectual arguments advocated by LDS apologists.

Of *course* nothing is 100% certain.  But that's not even the issue.
The real issue is what things are most likely, and what things are
least likely.

Folks have no difficulty understanding this in normal life, but they
seem particularly susceptible to this sort of illogical thinking when
it comes to religion.

Try an experiment.  Is there a monster under your bed?  What would you
do to test that hypothesis?  You'd probably look.  Suppose you saw
nothing, does that mean there's no monster there?  Not with 100%
certainty, because the monster could be invisible.  So you might toss
some powder under the bed, on the assumption that it would coat the
monster so you could see it.  Suppose you do that -- you toss powder
under the bed -- and you still don't see the monster.  Does that mean
there's no monster there?  Not with 100% certainty, because this could
be a special monster who doesn't react with normal matter.

Yadda, Yadda, Yadda.  It can go on and on and on.  The true believer
will *always* find a way to maintain their faith, and they have an
infinite supply of excuses to draw upon.

But when you ditch the &quot;100% certain&quot; philosophy and ask what is
&quot;likely&quot; things become clearer.  That's why most people can sleep well
at night, without worrying about existential monsters under the bed.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; John, you might just be a figment of my imagiation, nothing more!
">

And pigs might fly.  It's all &quot;possible,&quot; but it's not all &quot;likely.&quot;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Think about that. . .if I were an existentialist you couldn't prove
&gt; anything by &quot;science,&quot; now could you?
">

Science involves being able to verify objective data, and scientists
understand that, although nothing is provable with 100% probability,
there's a huge difference between likely and unlikely things.  Most
people understand this in their everyday lives -- they only seem to
get hung up with the &quot;prove&quot; fallacy when trying to sustain their
belief in superstitious and religious things.

I, for example, cannot &quot;prove&quot; there's no monster under your bed, and
neither can you.  But I'll bet you don't lose sleep worrying that
you'll be devoured tonight, and I fully expect to see you posting in
the future.

So, back to the issue of prayer.  Many prayers are about the real
world.  There are prayers to heal sick people, save jobs, turn away
hurricanes, chase away terrorists, etc.  If these prayers really work
there should be clear and obvious evidence available in double-blind
scientific tests.

And the effect should be very noticeable.  We can measure the effect
of aspirin on headaches; we should be able to measure the effects of
prayer, too.  If there's really an effect there.  The problem is, the
most careful studies show no statistically significant effect from
prayer.

http://www.beliefnet.com/story/188/story_18848_1.html

I've asked the same question about the holy ghost.  Mormons claim to
be the only people on earth with the gift of the holy ghost -- the
constant companionship of the holy ghost.  They claim they get this
gift upon confirmation after they are baptized into the Church of
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

One would expect that people with the constant companionship of the
holy ghost should be remarkably resistant to fraud, though.  Yet fraud
is as prevalent in Utah as just about any place else, and the prophet
of the church was actually involved in purchasing fraudulent
historical documents:

http://www.utlm.org/onlinebooks/trackingconfessions6.htm

Yes, Mormons have all their ready-made excuses for why nobody can
&quot;prove&quot; that Gordon B. Hinckley wasn't really a prophet with the
constant companionship of the holy ghost, even though he was
bamboozled by a con man.  But nothing can be proven with 100%
certainty.  And, of course, it doesn't *have* to be proven he's not a
prophet to ask how *likely* is it that he's not a prophet.

Even when there is nothing &quot;LDS&quot; in the topic, and there are no

cannot avoid taking defamatory shots at them.

Duwayne has real issues. He can't do statistical analysis, and can't
have a discussion of any kind, without diss'n those damnable
mormons....

Mormons don't need anyone else to justify their choices, but duwayne
cannot live with his own choice, unless he can prove it correct,
through the personal denigration of others.....

When one makes stupid comments like this, one is revealed as being
ignorant of the topic. Too bad its just one more thing you forgot to
learn when you were a latter day saint.

The Holy Ghost does not drag folks around by the nose, and tell them
right or wrong. He is a power that will assist those who seek Him, and
wish to utilize the gift. Those who do not use it, don't get any
benefit from it. Its not like the Holy Ghost is a deodorant that is
there, masking your stink, no matter if you want it to, or not....

Being offered the gift, does not guarantee acceptance, and certainly
does not mean that the receiver will never  make any mistakes, or bad
choices.....Just more mormon hating rhetoric, from the head mormon
hater...

Anti mormons have their own kind of religion, where they bastardize
the LDS faith, and then decide for themselves what it means to be a
mormon, build a little straw man, and then abuse it, when it fits
their agenda. Sadly, there is little commonality between what duwayne
and his ilk think mormons teach and believe, and what mormons actually
do teach and believe

I am telling you, right to your face, that the holy ghost will -not-
inject Himself into -anyone's- decisions. You got that?  Quit
bastardizing what I say. I never came close to implying that Mormons
don't claim to have the holy ghost.

You however, are going about declaring that people who have received
the Gift of the  Holy Ghost, are perfect, and never make any mistakes,
because He always keeps them from making bad choices. You have to
twist the facts, and make up such lies, in  order to even survive in
an LDS discussion, and that is really a shame.

When you were  baptised into the church, and the Priesthood holder
offered you the gift of the Holy Ghost, did he say &quot;Holy Ghost, go
into duwayne and tell him what to do, all the time?&quot; or did he say
&quot;duwayne, receive the Holy Ghost? (you may say, &quot;I forget&quot; so I will

You have read enough here and other places, to know quite well, that
the testimony of Jesus Christ, is gained only through the witness of
the Holy Ghost.

Those who ask, can receive confirmation, but the the Holy Ghost does
not go around pushing Himself into people's minds and hearts, to cause

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; checker

&gt;&gt; &gt;Right you are.  You could be having a very bad dream.  But in this
&gt;&gt; &gt;dream we can still measure and think about the apparent reality.  In
&gt;&gt; &gt;this reality is there a provable correlation between prayer and
&gt;&gt; &gt;external reality.  Prayer may have some value even if there is no
&gt;&gt; &gt;science backing it.  Prayer has seemed to work for me, but it may be
&gt;&gt; &gt;caused by something else.

&gt;&gt; &gt;I wonder if there has been some kind of study to show statistically if
&gt;&gt; &gt;prayers affect the world.  This is helpful to know because if a prayer
&gt;&gt; &gt;works it would be nice to know why.  Was it a coincidence, or was it
&gt;&gt; &gt;because the prayer helped the mind to create the reality change.

&gt;&gt; I don't think you could do a valid statistical study of the results of
&gt;&gt; prayer for the following reason. . .

&gt;&gt; You would have to find some way to quantify the differences between
&gt;&gt; praying for things that would be pleasing to God in your particular
&gt;&gt; life and prayers that might be for things that would not please God in
&gt;&gt; the long run.  God knows of your future circumstances, but you do not,
&gt;&gt; and you would find it impossible to include those future circumstances
&gt;&gt; in knowing how many of the prayers should (and would) be answered by
&gt;&gt; God.  Quantifying stuff like that would be impossible.

&gt;&gt; &gt;Prayer may work because we believe it does and it has nothing to do
&gt;&gt; &gt;with a higher power.  Or maybe prayer does nothing--I don't believe
&gt;&gt; &gt;that.

&gt;&gt; I think I have valid reasons to not believe that either.

&gt;&gt; in the Name of Jesus,
&gt;&gt; Checker

&gt;Have one group of christians pray for a group of sick people and
&gt;measure that against the placebo group.
">

And ASSUME that this particular group of people are not being called
home to the Lord now?  OR ASSUME that He means for everyone to be
healed?

The Apostle Paul prayed 3 times to have the &quot;thorn in his side&quot;
removed, but concluded that God would rather use him in his weakness.
And God did indeed do that, as you can plainly see.

So then you would have to be able to remove those whom God did NOT
want to get well from those He DID want to get well before you could
be accurate.  You can't do that.

Nice try though. . .

And it's possible pigs might fly.  But it's not likely.

But let's be realistic.  The LDS Church teaches things like this:

Thomas S. Monson: In this world of chaos, of trial, of uncertainty,
never has our need for such divine guidance been more desperate.
Ensign &gt; May 1998

If that's really true, we should see statistical evidence that Mormons
actually have some sort of &quot;divine guidance.&quot;  Yet they seem just as
likely to be the victims of fraud, including the prophet of the Church
who was easily takin in by a common con man.

http://www.exmormon.org/mormon/mormon322.htm

So, perhaps god wants his prophet to look silly.  Or, perhaps not.
Perhaps Hinckley is the con man.

ONLY if you know ALL of the intentions of God, ALL of the

Okay.  It was the truth that Gordon B. Hinckley was hoodwinked by a

There was truth there, but Gordon B. Hinckley didn't know it.  Was it
because the holy ghost was holding back?  Was it because Mr. Hinckley

Well, how about you and the rest of Utah's Mormons?  Utah Mormons
don't seem any less likely to be hoodwinked by con men than anyone
else.  That seems true as well for the prophet of the Church of Jesus
Christ of Latter-day Saints.

Aren't the Mormons asking for truth?  Or, could it be they really
don't have the holy ghost at all?

Here's a thought.  I've posted this challenge on ARM before (no
answers, though).  What verifiable, objective and original truth ever
came to a Mormon prophet by revelation through the holy ghost?

You guys make outlandish claims about having this ghost.  If your
claims are true there should be at least *one* example of an
objective, verifiable, and original truth that came to the church
through revelation to the prophet.

Sure.  In fact, I'll let *you* demonstrate it for us.

Go to your Bible and read Numbers chapter 31.  There you will find an
account of Moses commanding his people to kill women and children who
were prisoners of war.  Except they didn't kill all of them.  They
kept the young women (who hadn't known men) as &quot;wives.&quot;

So there you have an example of one of the most horrific war crimes in
history.  And guess what?  My good &quot;Christian&quot; Baptist friends justify
it.

How about you?  I'd really like an answer from you on this.  I'll take
your silence as evidence that you do justify what Moses &amp; company did
(as described in Numbers 31) and you're just too embarrassed about
your justification to reply.

Notice that I didn't say *I* would ever justify that sort of stuff.
But there *are* people who *do* justify it.  And they're typically
good &quot;Christian&quot; people who go to church every Sunday.

Duwayne asked that *question.*

You ignored it, by the way, and went on a rant.

Here's the point I'm making.  I'll number them to make it easier to
follow:

1)  Mormons claim they are the only people who have the &quot;gift of the
holy ghost&quot; in which they have the right to have the holy ghost with
them all the time.

2)  They claim they get this &quot;gift of the holy ghost&quot; when they are
&quot;confirmed&quot; after they are baptized into the Church of Jesus Christ of
Latter-day Saints.

So, on a statistical basis, with all these Mormons running about Utah
with the &quot;gift of the holy ghost&quot; there is a reasonable expectation
that Utah would show more &quot;discernment&quot; than the average state.  I'd
expect less fraud in Utah, and less susceptibility to fraud.

The problem is, Utah has as much trouble with fraud (and perhaps more)
than any other state.  There's nothing I know of to indicate that the
Mormons in Utah -- on average -- show any more discernment than the
people in any other state.

Indeed, the Gordon B. Hinckley, prophet of the Church of Jesus Christ
of Latter-day Saints (LDS or Mormon) was the victim of fraud himself
when he was bamboozled by a con man selling fake historical documents.

Okay.  I think I've laid out my case in a pretty simple manner.  Let's
see if you can actually deal coherently with the issues here.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Those are fabrications of yours -- strawman arguments used by you to

Nothing can be &quot;proven&quot; with 100%, and reasonable people don't judge
factors that way.

The question is, is it likely, given Utah's penchant for
succeptability to fraud, that there are really over a million people
in the state running around with the holy ghost as their &quot;constant
companion.&quot;

There is a gaping hole in your theory....

Let's take a look at your inability to actually use statistics to make
a point....

Utah is only about 60% LDS, and its a fair bet that probably half of
those are not exactly overly active in their faith. Right off, there
is a problem with your assumption, as you are referring &quot;Utahns,&quot; as
if they were all active, temple attending mormons, when in fact, with
regards to this topic, its a safe bet, that 70% of those Utahns, are
either NOT LDS, or are basically not going to be worthy of the Holy
Ghost based on their activity in the church. That means that you are
applying your  entire state &quot;fraud rate&quot; to only 30% of the people.

Of those 30%, how many are children, who would not have anything to
do, with all this fraud you are claiming occurs in Utah?

You need to take that number, and then extrapolate the actual
percentage of adult aged, active mormons, versus the rest of the
state's adults, before you go running around, saying &quot;statistics show
mormons are just as guilty of fraud as everyone else, because so far,
you have not even come close, to a defensible argument of that point.

I am not impressed with your ability to use statistics, to make a
case. If you wanted to do it right, and back up your holy ghost
claims, you have to  apply the number of frauds and &quot;mistakes&quot; more
fairly, to active adult mormons, vs all other adults, including the
inactive ones.

Figures don't lie, but liars can sure figure.....

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; The problem is, Utah has as much trouble with fraud (and perhaps more)
&gt; than any other state.  There's nothing I know of to indicate that the
&gt; Mormons in Utah -- on average -- show any more discernment than the
&gt; people in any other state.
">

That is your problem, not mine. You haven't shown any numbers that
relate fraud to active mormons, versus inactive and non members.... In
fact, you are essentially, making  them up, and tossing them out here.
Hardly a valid way to present your case

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Indeed, the Gordon B. Hinckley, prophet of the Church of Jesus Christ

That seems to be your opinion of how things were played out, but I see
nothing written anywhere, that says that the man is incapable of
making a mistake. It is regrettable that you were led to believe that
in all things, prophets are perfect, for neither the LDS faith, nor
any christian belief in the Bible, even comes close to professing such
a thing. In a way, you have built your own straw man, by assuming
perfection, when none is claimed.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Those are fabrications of yours -- strawman arguments used by you to

I am not the guy who started it all out, by declaring that  prophet is
a perfect man. That is your strawman, and once it is burned down, you
have no case against hinckley, or any other prophet. Consider it
rejected, unless you can prove otherwise.

As for the  notion that mormons don't use the Holy Ghost, and commit
fraud, I think that has been rejected as well, but mostly because, you
just claimed it, but didn't put up any verifiable facts, or statistics
to back it up. Somehow, you have gotten the impression, that most of
Utah, is brimming with active, temple attending, perfect latter day
saints. You are so very wrong about that assumption.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Even if Mormons are worthy of the companionship of the holy ghost 50%

to back up your claim in the first place. If this is an example of

Yours is the winner tho, because in order for your story to hold any
water, it has to be assumed that the prophet is perfect, and that most
of Utah is populated with perfect latter day saints, and you have not
proven that anyone ever declared any of those things to be so.

Apparently you don't read the Ensign.  Or, as any good apologist for

Actually, it's you who doesn't understand the power of statistics.  By
your own admission 30% of Utahans are active LDS who should have
accepted the holy ghost into their homes.  That being the case, Utah
should be 30% less susceptible to fraud than the average state.

In fact, even if just 10% of Utah was guided by the gift of the holy
ghost there's a reasonable expectation that it'd show up as a
statistically significant reduction in state-wide incidence of fraud.
[And that's not counting the biggest con game in town - the LDS Church
itself.]

But Utah is actually a haven of sorts for fraud.  In many metrics
their incidence of fraud is higher than the national average.  That's
the opposite trend that we'd expect if Mormonism was really dishing
out the gift of the holy ghost.

http://www.consumer.gov/sentinel/pubs/Top10Fraud_2002.pdf

If the Mormon Church is really handing out the &quot;gift of the holy
ghost&quot; the state should be less susceptible to fraud, but they are
*more* susceptible to fraud.

And don't try blaming it on the non-Mormons.

Gordon B. Hinckley, prophet of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-
day Saints (LDS or Mormon) was a victim of a con man.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

This doesn't necessarily mean prayer is bad.  I am sure prayer has its
place.  For instance, I believe prayer helps some people feel good,
and prayer is cheaper than drugs.  Therefore prayer is good because it
is a cheep form of entertainment.

I pray all the time--lately to Zeus, sometimes to Athena, but it
changes.  It is good to rotate which gods you pray to, because it
isn't good to get hooked on any one god.  Dependency often leads to an
addiction.  Also you don't want the gods to get jealous, so it is good
the give them all a chance to help you out.  This also has the added
blessing of being a free market religious system.  The competition
encourages the gods work harder for your prayer.

Of course there is no science to back it up, Its kind of a strawman in
itself, because prayer, communications with God, people  who pray,
have never claimed it to be  anything more than a spiritual
experience.

Its the &quot;outsider&quot; who attaches the demand for scientific proof.

Its kind of like those who use the book of mormon as a history book,

It never seems to take long, in a discussion, for apologists for the
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS or Mormon) to get so
frustrated they start swearing and calling names.

But is this what we'd expect if the church is really true?  If it's
really true, shouldn't the apologists be able to reason logically and
rationally?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; You built a strawman that
&gt; says a prophet cannot make a mistake.

No, John.  That's your strawman.  I never said the prophet has to be
perfect and never make a mistake.

What does perfection have to do with minimal standards of
performance?  A person doesn't have to be perfect to not be taken in
by a con man - they just need to have enough sense to have
professional historians authenticate the documents.

I have more common sense than Gordon B. Hinckley demonstrated.

And Mr. Hinckley's mistake was no ordinary one, either.  He's the head
of a very rich church that claims to have the gift of the holy ghost.
Why couldn't the holy ghost reveal the truth to him, before he used
church resources in dealing with a con man?

Remember how you made your assertions about the LDS Church and the
holy ghost?  Did you see the references that I posted for you?  the
ones you snipped in your reply?

Those are heady claims that the LDS Church makes with respect to the
holy ghost.  Why, then, is there no indication of the inspiration of
the holy ghost in Mr. Hinckley's dealings with Mark Hoffman?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Until you admit that, we be done.

Where/when have I ever said the prophet should not be expected to make
any mistakes?

Stop lying, John.  These are serious questions, and you need to deal
straight up with them instead of swearing, name calling, and snipping
the references that I posted for you.

Here is exactly what the Book of Mormon claims to be:
----
The Book of Mormon is a volume of holy scripture comparable to the
Bible. It is a record of God's dealings with the ancient inhabitants
of the Americas and contains, as does the Bible, the fulness of the
everlasting gospel.

The book was written by many ancient prophets by the spirit of
prophecy and revelation. Their words, written on gold plates, were
quoted and abridged by a prophet-historian named Mormon. The record
gives an account of two great civilizations. One came from Jerusalem
in 600 B.C., and afterward separated into two nations, known as the
Nephites and the Lamanites. The other came much earlier when the Lord
confounded the tongues at the Tower of Babel. This group is known as
the Jaredites. After thousands of years, all were destroyed except the
Lamanites, and they are the principal ancestors of the American
Indians.

The crowning event recorded in the Book of Mormon is the personal
ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ among the Nephites soon after his
resurrection. It puts forth the doctrines of the gospel, outlines the
plan of salvation, and tells men what they must do to gain peace in
this life and eternal salvation in the life to come.

After Mormon completed his writings, he delivered the account to his
son Moroni, who added a few words of his own and hid up the plates in
the hill Cumorah. On September 21, 1823, the same Moroni, then a
glorified, resurrected being, appeared to the Prophet Joseph Smith and
instructed him relative to the ancient record and its destined
translation into the English language.

In due course the plates were delivered to Joseph Smith, who
translated them by the gift and power of God. The record is now
published in many languages as a new and additional witness that Jesus
Christ is the Son of the living God and that all who will come unto
him and obey the laws and ordinances of his gospel may be saved.

Concerning this record the Prophet Joseph Smith said: &quot;I told the
brethren that the Book of Mormon was the most correct of any book on
earth, and the keystone of our religion, and a man would get nearer to
God by abiding by its precepts, than by any other book.&quot;

In addition to Joseph Smith, the Lord provided for eleven others to
see the gold plates for themselves and to be special witnesses of the
truth and divinity of the Book of Mormon. Their written testimonies
are included herewith as &quot;The Testimony of Three Witnesses&quot; and &quot;The
Testimony of Eight Witnesses.&quot;

We invite all men everywhere to read the Book of Mormon, to ponder in
their hearts the message it contains, and then to ask God, the Eternal
Father, in the name of Christ if the book is true. Those who pursue
this course and ask in faith will gain a testimony of its truth and
divinity by the power of the Holy Ghost. (See Moroni 10: 3-5.)

Those who gain this divine witness from the Holy Spirit will also come
to know by the same power that Jesus Christ is the Savior of the
world, that Joseph Smith is his revelator and prophet in these last
days, and that The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is the
Lord's kingdom once again established on the earth, preparatory to the
second coming of the Messiah.

&quot;Introduction to the Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus
Christ&quot;
----
The primary purpose of the Book of Mormon is to provide another
witness of the divinity of Jesus Christ and to outline the means by
which we may gain exaltation in the Kingdom of God.

It is more that we believe that it is the power of the priesthood,

Maybe these verses from the Book of Mormon will interest you:

----
Jacob 1: 2-3
2 And he gave me, Jacob, a commandment that I should write upon
these plates a few of the things which I considered to be most
precious; that I should not touch, save it were lightly, concerning
the history of this people which are called the people of Nephi.
3 For he said that the history of his people should be engraven upon
his other plates, and that I should preserve these plates and hand
them down unto my seed, from generation to generation.

1 Ne. 9: 2
2 And now, as I have spoken concerning these plates, behold they are
not the plates upon which I make a full account of the history of my
people; for the plates upon which I make a full account of my people I
have given the name of Nephi; wherefore, they are called the plates of
Nephi, after mine own name; and these plates also are called the
plates of Nephi.

2 Ne. 4: 14
14 For I, Nephi, was constrained to speak unto them, according to
his word; for I had spoken many things unto them, and also my father,
before his death; many of which sayings are written upon mine other
plates; for a more history part are written upon mine other plates.

2 Ne. 5: 33
33 And if my people desire to know the more particular part of the
history of my people they must search mine other plates.
----

You should note that in each verse it is said that the history was
written on other plates that were not included as those that Joseph
Smith claimed to have translated.  The Book of Mormon was composed not
to be a historical document, though some historic elements are indeed
contained within, but as a spiritual document.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;From the Book of Mormon we have these verses as the reason for its
">

composition:

----
1 Ne. 6: 3
3 And it mattereth not to me that I am particular to give a full
account of all the things of my father, for they cannot be written
upon these plates, for I desire the room that I may write of the
things of God.

2 Ne. 4: 15
15 And upon these I write the things of my soul, and many of the
scriptures which are engraven upon the plates of brass. For my soul
delighteth in the scriptures, and my heart pondereth them, and writeth
them for the learning and the profit of my children.

2 Ne. 33: 11
11 And if they are not the words of Christ, judge ye-for Christ will
show unto you, with power and great glory, that they are his words, at
the last day; and you and I shall stand face to face before his bar;
and ye shall know that I have been commanded of him to write these
things, notwithstanding my weakness.
----

Many more verses could be cited, but these should suffice.

&gt; In addition to Joseph Smith, the Lord provided for eleven others to
&gt; see the gold plates for themselves and to be special witnesses of the
&gt; truth and divinity of the Book of Mormon. Their written testimonies
&gt; are included herewith as &quot;The Testimony of Three Witnesses&quot; and &quot;The
&gt; Testimony of Eight Witnesses.&quot;

&gt; We invite all men everywhere to read the Book of Mormon, to ponder in
&gt; their hearts the message it contains, and then to ask God, the Eternal
&gt; Father, in the name of Christ if the book is true. Those who pursue
&gt; this course and ask in faith will gain a testimony of its truth and
&gt; divinity by the power of the Holy Ghost. (See Moroni 10: 3-5.)

&gt; Those who gain this divine witness from the Holy Spirit will also come
&gt; to know by the same power that Jesus Christ is the Savior of the
&gt; world, that Joseph Smith is his revelator and prophet in these last
&gt; days, and that The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is the
&gt; Lord's kingdom once again established on the earth, preparatory to the
&gt; second coming of the Messiah.

&gt; &quot;Introduction to the Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus
&gt; Christ&quot;
&gt; ----
&gt; The primary purpose of the Book of Mormon is to provide another
&gt; witness of the divinity of Jesus Christ and to outline the means by
&gt; which we may gain exaltation in the Kingdom of God.- Hide quoted text -

It's that, and more.  Here's what the Book of Mormon pretends to say
about the lives of the ancient Americans:

1)  It describes the ancient Americans as people who came to the
Americas by boat
2)  It describes the food they cultivated as being brought from the
Old World
3)  It describes the tools they used, including steel swords, metal
breastplates, knives, etc.
4)  It describes their system of money
5)  It describes a vast system of metallurgy
6)  It describes the languages they used
7)  It describes their record keeping
8)  It has a long and detailed account of wars fought
9)  It has a long and detailed account of the judges, kings, and
generals who led the people, including their names, what they did, and
details about their military strategy.
10) It describes the animals they domesticated and used -- including
horses and elephants
11) It describes the geology of the land, including a river, prominent
&quot;narrow neck&quot; of land, planes, dry regions, etc.
12) It describes dozens and dozens of cities and their relative
locations
13) There are over two-dozen specific instances where the Book of
Mormon goes out of its way to state plainly that it is an &quot;account&quot; of
the ancient Americans.  Here's an example:

Alma 28: 9 &quot;And this is the account of the wars and contentions among
the Nephites, and also the wars between the Nephites and the
Lamanites; *and the fifteenth year of the reign of the judges is
ended.&quot;

By any reasonable definition the Book of Mormon is a &quot;history.&quot;  So
when Mormon apologists like John say the Book of Mormon is *not* a
history they are simply lying about the book.

But why would they do that?  If a book is true it should be easiest
and best to tell the truth about it, not to lie about what it says.
Isn't the fact that apologists for the Church of Jesus Christ of
Latter-day Saints (LDS or Mormon) lie about the Book of Mormon a good
indication that the book is a fraud?

Not true.  If something is testable then science can investigate it.
If there is a real, repeatable phenomenon in place then it falls
within their purview of science.

If you tell me that you can pour some funky oil on a guy's head and
heal his appendicitis then the whole process can be monitored, tested,

Post the reference where I said &quot;never make a mistake.&quot;  This is the

What does perfection have to do with minimal standards of

professional historians authenticate the documents.

I have more common sense than Gordon B. Hinckley demonstrated.

And Mr. Hinckley's mistake was no ordinary one, either.  He's the
head
of a very rich church that claims to have the gift of the holy ghost.
Why couldn't the holy ghost reveal the truth to him, before he used
church resources in dealing with a con man?

Remember how you made your assertions about the LDS Church and the

&gt; &gt; John, that's simply not true.  Post the BOM scripture that says it's
&gt; &gt; not a history book.

&gt; Maybe these verses from the Book of Mormon will interest you:

&gt; ----
&gt; Jacob 1: 2-3
&gt;   2 And he gave me, Jacob, a commandment that I should write upon
&gt; these plates a few of the things which I considered to be most
&gt; precious; that I should not touch, save it were lightly, concerning
&gt; the history of this people which are called the people of Nephi.
&gt;   3 For he said that the history of his people should be engraven upon
&gt; his other plates, and that I should preserve these plates and hand
&gt; them down unto my seed, from generation to generation.

&gt; 1 Ne. 9: 2
&gt;   2 And now, as I have spoken concerning these plates, behold they are
&gt; not the plates upon which I make a full account of the history of my
&gt; people; for the plates upon which I make a full account of my people I
&gt; have given the name of Nephi; wherefore, they are called the plates of
&gt; Nephi, after mine own name; and these plates also are called the
&gt; plates of Nephi.

&gt; 2 Ne. 4: 14
&gt;   14 For I, Nephi, was constrained to speak unto them, according to
&gt; his word; for I had spoken many things unto them, and also my father,
&gt; before his death; many of which sayings are written upon mine other
&gt; plates; for a more history part are written upon mine other plates.

&gt; 2 Ne. 5: 33
&gt;   33 And if my people desire to know the more particular part of the
&gt; history of my people they must search mine other plates.
&gt; ----

&gt; You should note that in each verse it is said that the history was
&gt; written on other plates that were not included as those that Joseph
&gt; Smith claimed to have translated.  The Book of Mormon was composed not
&gt; to be a historical document, though some historic elements are indeed
&gt; contained within, but as a spiritual document.

&gt; &gt;From the Book of Mormon we have these verses as the reason for its

&gt; composition:

&gt; ----
&gt; 1 Ne. 6: 3
&gt;   3 And it mattereth not to me that I am particular to give a full
&gt; account of all the things of my father, for they cannot be written
&gt; upon these plates, for I desire the room that I may write of the
&gt; things of God.

&gt; 2 Ne. 4: 15
&gt;   15 And upon these I write the things of my soul, and many of the
&gt; scriptures which are engraven upon the plates of brass. For my soul
&gt; delighteth in the scriptures, and my heart pondereth them, and writeth
&gt; them for the learning and the profit of my children.

&gt; 2 Ne. 33: 11
&gt;   11 And if they are not the words of Christ, judge ye-for Christ will
&gt; show unto you, with power and great glory, that they are his words, at
&gt; the last day; and you and I shall stand face to face before his bar;
&gt; and ye shall know that I have been commanded of him to write these
&gt; things, notwithstanding my weakness.
&gt; ----

&gt; Many more verses could be cited, but these should suffice.
">

Actually, let's look at some additional verses from the BOM, and
consider them in light of the apologetic claim that the BOM is not a
history.  As folks read these verses, ask yourself this question:

If the Book of Mormon is really true, would apologists for the Church
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints feel compelled to lie about it?

1 Nephi 10
[1] And now I, Nephi, proceed to give an account upon these plates of
my proceedings, and my reign and ministry; wherefore, to proceed with
mine account, I must speak somewhat of the things of my father, and
also of my brethren.

Omni 1
[21] And they gave an account of one Coriantumr, and the slain of his
people. And Coriantumr was discovered by the people of Zarahemla; and
he dwelt with them for the space of nine moons.

THE BOOK OF ALMA THE SON OF ALMA
The account of Alma, who was the son of Alma the first, and chief
judge over the people of Nephi, and also the high priest over the
Church. An account of the reign of the judges, and the wars and
contentions among the people. And also an account of a war between the
Nephites and the Lamanites, according to the record of Alma, the first
and chief judge.

Alma 28
[8] And this is the account of Ammon and his brethren, their
journeyings in the land of Nephi, their sufferings in the land, their
sorrows, and their afflictions, and their incomprehensible joy, and
the reception and safety of the brethren in the land of Jershon. And
now may the Lord, the Redeemer of all men, bless their souls forever.
[9] And this is the account of the wars and contentions among the
Nephites, and also the wars between the Nephites and the Lamanites;
and the fifteenth year of the reign of the judges is ended.

Alma 35
[13] And the people of Ammon departed out of the land of Jershon, and
came over into the land of Melek, and gave place in the land of
Jershon for the armies of the Nephites, that they might contend with
the armies of the Lamanites and the armies of the Zoramites; and thus
commenced a war betwixt the Lamanites and the Nephites, in the
eighteenth year of the reign of the judges; and an account shall be
given of their wars hereafter.
[16] Therefore, he caused that his sons should be gathered together,
that he might give unto them every one his charge, separately,
concerning the things pertaining unto righteousness. And we have an
account of his commandments, which he gave unto them according to his
own record.

Alma 43
[3] And now I return to an account of the wars between the Nephites
and the Lamanites, in the eighteenth year of the reign of the judges.

THE BOOK OF HELAMAN
An account of the Nephites. Their wars and contentions, and their
dissensions. And also the prophecies of many holy prophets, before the
coming of Christ, according to the records of Helaman, who was the son
of Helaman, and also according to the records of his sons, even down
to the coming of Christ. And also many of the Lamanites are converted.
An account of their conversion. An account of the righteousness of the
Lamanites, and the wickedness and abominations of the Nephites,
according to the record of Helaman and his sons, even down to the
coming of Christ, which is called the book of Helaman.

Ether 1
[1] And now I, Moroni, proceed to give an account of those ancient
inhabitants who were destroyed by the hand of the Lord upon the face
of this north country.
[2] And I take mine account from the twenty and four plates which were
found by the people of Limhi, which is called the Book of Ether.
[3] And as I suppose that the first part of this record, which speaks
concerning the creation of the world, and also of Adam, and an account
from that time even to the great tower, and whatsoever things
transpired among the children of men until that time, is had among the
Jews --
[4] Therefore I do not write those things which transpired from the
days of Adam until that time; but they are had upon the plates; and
whoso findeth them, the same will have power that he may get the full
account.
[5] But behold, I give not the full account, but a part of the account
I give, from the tower down until they were destroyed.
[6] And on this wise do I give the account. He that wrote this record
was Ether, and he was a descendant of Coriantor.

It seems incredible that Mormons would be so worried about the Book of
Mormon's authenticity that they would lie about it with such abadon.
It seems that Mormons understand as well as the critics that the Book
of Mormon is a clumsy fraud.
