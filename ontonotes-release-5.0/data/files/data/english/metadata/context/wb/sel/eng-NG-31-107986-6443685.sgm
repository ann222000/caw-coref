Hi

I brewed a 1.070 gravity, 200 IBU IPA about 3 weeks ago, I'm expecting
to have to leave this to mellow for a good 6 months at least.

I have a couple of questions:

It's had one week primary, and two weeks in a corny for secondary.
Seeing as I'm going to be storing this for a long time (never made a
beer for keeping before), should I rack this over to another keg for
long term storage?  I'm worrying about yeast autolysis, but I'm sure
I'd need some yeast for the aging process.

Also, I have a chest freezer, sitting at about 2C (~36F), should I
leave the IPA in there the whole time or just leave it at ambient (UK
temps, so can be anywhere from freezing to 75-80F in the summer)?

Cheers,
Mark

200 IBUs is impossible.  Only 100 IBUs is allowed into a solution.
This is were ProMash usually misses the mark.  Pliny with almost 4
pounds of hops per barrel has been calculated at 60 IBUs.  Email me
and I'll send you a reputable link.  This will also help to explain
this I bring up later in this post....

IPA, like pale and most beers that are hop driven (exp. barleywine,
etc.) are better fresh, clear or not.  I have heard it said that a
IPA, drank days after racked and carbonated, hazy is almost 2.5 to 3x
more hoppy than the same beer after 2-4 months after all the hop
compounds are settled.  But what data do I have, nada....

Think of it this way... If the soldiers in India, the situation were
IPA got its name, could drink it ASAP, would they have?  Or would they
have waited 6 months?  I think hop monster are better fresh.  Think of
Pliny the Elder.  SO much better closer to bottling than 6-8 months
later....

I would drink this beer in 2-3 weeks MAX.  The gravity tells you to
wait but the hop schedule needs to be drunk FRESH!

My experience with a 10 gallon batch of Arrogant Bastard Ale
clone (1.070 and ~90 IBU) is that fresher is better.

To repeat myself, aging is not an optimal strategy.  If the
ale is kept at 2C, aging should be minimal.

You should siphon from the corny to avoid moving the lees.
My suggestion is to keep the corny at 2C for 3-4 days so the
yeast in suspension will fall out.

I have difficulty imaging the bitterness of 200 IBUs.  How
did you allocate the IBUs amongst bittering, flavorin, and
aroma hops?  The BJCP IBU specs for American Barleywine calls
for 60-120+ - so you have certainly engaged in overkill!

This sounds like a brew where you can pour a half liter and
call it lunch.  Unless you're planning to ship samples to
the States, I won't be available for sampling.

I not long ago made a IIPA with 326 IBU...yes 326. How? 1.25 lbs hops, all
with AAs above 8% with most being 10% and above. Amarillo and Simcoe for FWH
and all the rest 30 minutes or less including 4 oz. in dry hop. It came out
1.084 OG and 1.018 FG. It's definately off balanced for most but I got what
I wanted...a beer you can almost smell through the bottle. The tase is
remeniscent of Bell's Hopslam and the taste pretty close to the same. I
always drink my IIPAs young as they tend to get too malty for me over 8
weeks in bottle. Then again people, even hopheads can only drink so much of
it. Me, I can't get too much hops but I will admit 1-22oz. bottle at a
sitting is enought to quench my taste for hops. And yes at 391 calories per
pint, it's a hearty meal to say the least. Some people like to mellow their
IPAs by letting them sit but IMHO it's defeating the whole idea of making an
IPA. Your choice...it's all about what you like :)

Ok guys, yes I know it's not scientifically possible to get 200 IBU in
to solution, but this is the result of the calculation from promash
for the amount of hops added in the brew (I could dig out the hop
quantiy, but IBU's is easy).

This was a brew based on the Durden Park beer circles book "Old
British Beers And How To Make Them" - these guys know what they are
talking about.  The recipe in question is the "Whitbread 1864 India
Export Ale", taken from the brewing journals of Whitbread for their
IPA of 1864 nonetheless.  The minimum recommended aging time for this
beer is 1 year.  This beer is so bitter it's undrinkable at the
moment.  I've had a few commercial beers that have been put out way
too early and all I can taste is bitterness - absolutely foul.

Given enough time supposedly this changes in to awesome flavours.  I'm
sure most of you know this, but this is what a true IPA is - they had
to be massively hopped (as well as very highly attenuated and high in
alcohol) to fight infection in a hot, damp environment - namely the
hold of a ship which crossed the equator twice and some of the most
treacherous seas on the planet on it's 3-6 month journey to the Indian
sub-continent from London.  By the time it'b been off-loaded, sold and
distributed, it could well have been 9-12 months before it was being
tapped.

With the massive amount of hops, high alcohol, and high attenuation
necessary for it to survive the shipping conditions, long aging would be
necessary for the hops and alcohol to mellow out.  Fortunately the long
sea voyage took care of that part.  Since we no longer have to stick our
IPA's in the hot hold of a ship for many months, we can cut the hops
back and age for a shorter period of time to get the same results.

That said, there is still something to be said for massive hopping.
This past fall I brewed a Pliny the Elder clone.  Promash said it was
280 IBU.  You really can't hop past a taste threshold of around 100 IBU
for bitterness.  However, for this beer at least, the extra hops
contributed to an intense complexity and richness to the hop flavor.
This beer uses some 18 ounces of 5 or 6 varieties of hops.  You wouldn't
get this type of flavor out of a single variety of hops.

I know everyone else in this thread disagrees with me, but I like my
IPAs aged for 2 months. Mine is nowhere near your bitterness level (I
make a standard British 1.060, 55-60 IBU brew) and I prefer it aged.

If you're a hophead you may like it fresh. I'm not, at all, so I like
it after the flavors have had a chance to mellow and mingle. The malt
comes through much better with aging, IMO.

Wayne... Good to hear from ya, TBN bud!  I agree with Wayne...

In addition, if you really wanted to be true to history, where's the
oak?  They won't include oak in a 19th century recipe cause that was
just the norm, as you know.  Think about toasting some oak or buying
some chips or cubs.  (I;m pretty sure your in the UK but check out
Northern Brewer, they have a oak stick that I've used for a IPA that
ROCKED!) If you're gonna age it anyway, put some oak in it.  my
experience along with everyone i have talked to, is that oak in a IPA
or pale is near "undrinkable " after the first month of "oaking".
Although the tannins and oakiness mellows after about 2-3 months.
consider oak if you are trying to recreate history and forget all the
things i, and the rest of the posters have said.  We are suggesting
how to brew and drink with the amenities and brewing techniques that
are available to us and you.

That's not necessarily the case.  Kegs were sealed on the inside with
brewers pitch, so the oak wouldn't be a factor.

I'd rack it to your final serving keg before the 6 month storage.  There
will still be plenty of yeast left in suspension to take care of aging, but
you'll get it off of the majority of the trub/slurry.  I'd also recommend
carbonating it before aging as well since corny kegs are designed to seal
under pressure.  Storing beer long term in an unpressurized corny is probably
asking for some trouble, the lid is most likely not going to be air tight.

Regarding temps, ideally you'd want a cellar temp.  The freezer is OK, but
aging will occur more slowly at lower temps, especially near 36F.  Do you
really get temp swings between freezing and 80F in your house, or by ambient
did you mean you were thinking of storing it outdoors?

Personally, I store my kegs in the basement at ambient temps (which is usually
somewhere in the high 60s F).

Oak barrels were also usually lined with brewer's pitch, which meant that
the beer didn't really pick up much flavor from the wood.  Putting oak in
your IPA is kind of like putting peated/smoked malt in your Scottish ale.
Often done in a misguided attempt to be authentic, but not really traditional.

A reply to a few of the responses (I am the OP btw);

There is more extracted from hops added at 60-90 minutes than *just*
bitterness.  IPA is all about the hop flavour from a large addition
changing into wonderful hop *flavours* after a significant period of
aging.

Reducing the hopping rate will mean that a shorter time to mature is
possible, but I guarantee you won't have the same beer.

Now regarding ambient temps etc.

I do indeed live in the UK. Ambient is probably somewhere around
15-16C on average in the UK (60F).  My brewery is in a brick built
'outhouse' - formerly an outside toilet and coal shed that I've
knocked through in to one building (yes, I removed the toilet!  I put
drains in to the floor too).  The ambient temperature of this building
seems to be a couple of degrees lower than outside, especially if I
keep the floor wet - which is normally the case, so probably not far
off traditional cellar temps.

My other choice is to put the kegs in to my lagering chest freezer,
but that sounds like it's not a good idea, at least at this early
stage.

I'm thinking that I'll rack the beer off its yeast/trub this weekend
(it's been in secondary for 3 weeks now) and add a few psi to seal the
keg, and just leave the cornies sitting around the 'brewery'.

Cheers,
Mark

True, different bittering hops will give different "qualities" of bitterness,
so there are other things being added.  I'm not sure I would say that a
60 - 90 minute additions gives the same types of flavors as a FWH or
traditional flavor addition.  Personally, I do both in my IPAs.

I definitely agree with you that "over" hopping (for lack of a better
description) an IPA and letting it age in order to mellow to the right
level will be a different beer than one you design from the beginning to
be ready early.

That's what I'd do as well.  Sounds like the ambient temps in the 'brewery'
should be fine.  However, I'd fully carbonate the beer first rather than
just add a few PSI.  Only hitting it with a quick initial burst of CO2
will pressurize the headspace enough to seat the lid, but over time that
little bit of CO2 will absorb into the beer and the pressure in the
headspace will drop back down to almost 0.  If it were me, I'd go through
a normal carbonation routine so that the keg is at equilibrium at your
intended pressure.  That way the lid will stay sealed during storage.

It won't hurt anything to age the beer while it is carbonated.  As far
as I know it doesn't have any impact on the aging/maturation process.
