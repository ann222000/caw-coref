Has anyone else noticed that the LdS youth tend to be more faithful than
their BOC(c) counter parts?  I speak only for Texas, but in general, the
BOC(c) kids tend to not follow their professed faith.

Opinions are not established facts. Many Muslim and Catholic youth
appear to be more faithful than those of other faiths. Same problem.

I'm basing it on my own observation, which I admit could be flawed.
Growing up in the Promised Land (Texas for those not in the know), the
baptist run things.  The example that youth sets is awful.  This might
also be caused by the fact that there are fewer of us.  When I was in a
high school I was one of three that went to my school and there were
only eight total my age in my ward.  It just seemed that we all lived a
higher standard than the others.

I think we were also held to a higher standard.  If a baptist is caught
doing something inappropriate, it hardly gets mentioned, if it's a
Mormon, especially in any type of leadership role, then it is all over
the news.

Your base of experience being limited to Baptist youth in Texas compared
to less than a dozen LDS youth makes your original blanket observation
pathetically lacking in validity.

Islam? None.  Catholics?  Quite a few.  You are correct.  Now that I
think about it, Catholics were a bit more on the pious side (as opposed

One could say the same thing about your third party observations about a
Church you are not a member of.  Yes I am aware of your 35 years in
Utah, but you were never a member and I presume carried this grudge
against the LdS for most of your time there.

It's not surprising that a Mormon apologist would attempt to discredit a
critic by insulting them by accusing them of &quot;carrying a grudge&quot; - and
dismissing off hand that what the critic might have to say could have
solid validity.

You aren't doing very well, Joker. Maybe you should study the following
more thoroughly and get more practice:

OR I could take a page out of your book and parrot everything D does.
You know, when I left here, you and I got on pretty well.  I did not,
and still don't, agree with your assessment of the Church, but I thought
you had some good points about the world in general.  I have asked D if
he would like to open up a dialog, see the person on the other side of
the screen a little better like you and I did.  I still like you John,
your passionate about squashing that &quot;conservative&quot; crap that seems to
flow out of our current administration.  I can ever respect someone who
disagrees with the church.  But piggy backing on someone else is beneath
you.

I've been around the block enough times with LDS apologists to recognize
a phony, and you're it. You likely don't even recognize it because you
can't see yourself from outside of your box of beliefs. And that box
blocks your view of the legitimacy of anything other than that box.

Your bottom line is your religion, and within that religious

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Texas, but in general, the BOC(c) kids tend to not follow their
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; professed faith.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Opinions are not established facts. Many Muslim and Catholic
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; youth appear to be more faithful than those of other faiths. Same
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; problem.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I'm basing it on my own observation, which I admit could be flawed.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; *Could* be flawed ??? How many youth from Catholicism or Islam have
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; you ever observed?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Islam? None.  Catholics?  Quite a few.  You are correct.  Now that I
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; think about it, Catholics were a bit more on the pious side (as
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; opposed to the self-righteous evangelicals).

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Growing up in the Promised Land (Texas for those not in the know),
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the baptist run things.  The example that youth sets is awful.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This might also be caused by the fact that there are fewer of us.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; When I was in a high school I was one of three that went to my
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; school and there were only eight total my age in my ward.  It just
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; seemed that we all lived a higher standard than the others.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I think we were also held to a higher standard.  If a baptist is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; caught doing something inappropriate, it hardly gets mentioned, if
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; it's a Mormon, especially in any type of leadership role, then it
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; is all over the news.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Your base of experience being limited to Baptist youth in Texas
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; compared to less than a dozen LDS youth makes your original blanket
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; observation pathetically lacking in validity.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; One could say the same thing about your third party observations
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; about a Church you are not a member of.  Yes I am aware of your 35
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; years in Utah, but you were never a member and I presume carried
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; this grudge against the LdS for most of your time there.

&gt;&gt;&gt; It's not surprising that a Mormon apologist would attempt to
&gt;&gt;&gt; discredit a critic by insulting them by accusing them of &quot;carrying a
&gt;&gt;&gt; grudge&quot; - and dismissing off hand that what the critic might have to
&gt;&gt;&gt; say could have solid validity.

&gt;&gt;&gt; You aren't doing very well, Joker. Maybe you should study the
&gt;&gt;&gt; following more thoroughly and get more practice:

&gt;&gt;&gt; Mormon Apologist List of Methods
&gt;&gt;&gt; http://www.mormoninformation.com/pro_lds.htm

&gt;&gt; OR I could take a page out of your book and parrot everything D does.

&gt; Now you're being dishonest and insulting.

&gt;&gt; You know, when I left here, you and I got on pretty well.  I did not,
&gt;&gt; and still don't, agree with your assessment of the Church, but I
&gt;&gt; thought you had some good points about the world in general.

&gt; I've been around the block enough times with LDS apologists to recognize
&gt; a phony, and you're it. You likely don't even recognize it because you
&gt; can't see yourself from outside of your box of beliefs. And that box
&gt; blocks your view of the legitimacy of anything other than that box.

&gt; Your bottom line is your religion, and within that religious
&gt; indoctrination members consider themselves and their views above others'
&gt; no matter feigned attempts to 'open up' to those others' views.

As a so-called 'righteous' Mormon, your hypocrisy lies in your dishonest
[phony] approach of feigned friendship to both me and Duwayne. Duwayne
addresses it thusly:

&quot;And when the standard approaches (i.e., misrepresenting teachings,
feigning friendship, etc.) don't work, the typical response is a sort
of washing of the feet, followed with some type of nefarious insult...&quot;

...Which is exactly what you did when you falsely and insultingly asserted:

&quot;OR I could take a page out of your book and parrot everything D does.&quot;

Your phony act has been exposed, Joker - and because you're a dishonest
person, I can only expect you to continue to pretend that it hasn't.

I asked in another thread:

I did a quick search and found a snippit about your book here:

http://www.lds-mormon.com/farewell.shtml

I have not read your book, but from this it appears to be a comparison
of Mormon belief as compared to science.  Is that a fare statement?  If
so, do you compare other religions and their views to science or is it
limited to the Mormon church?

But you snipped it.  Should this be made its own thread?

None of this, however, can be honestly misconstrued as saying I would
