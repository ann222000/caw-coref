ABOUT CHHATTISGARH
Origin of 'Chhattisgarh'

The name Chhattisgarh is not ancient and has come into popular usage in the
last few centuries. In ancient times the region was called Dakshin Kosala.
All inscription, literary works and the accounts of foreign travelers, call
this region Kosala of Dakshin Kosala. According to Hari Thakur, the contest
between Jabalpur and Chhattisgarh for the name Mahakosala is settled beyond
doubt in favour of Chhattisgarh in the light of available evidence. Even
during the reign of the Mughals, it was called Ratanpur territory and not
Chhattisgarh. The word Chhattisgarh was popularized during the Maratha
period and was first used in an official document in 1795.

A British Chronicler, J.B. Beglar provides and interesting story explaining
the origins of the name Chhattisgarh. It becomes very relevant in the
context of contemporary caste consciousness and the caste configuration of
the region. According to Beglar "the real name is Chhattisghar and not
Chhattisgarh. There is a tradition saying that ages ago about the time of
Jarasandha, thirty six families of dalits (leather workers) emigrated
southwards from Jarasandha's kingdom and established themselves in country,
which after them is called Chhattisgarh". Another common explanation
regarding the origins of the name Chhattisgarh is that it denotes the number
of forts in the region, which are supposed to be thirty six in number.
However, experts do not agree with this explanation, as thirty-six forts
cannot be identified in the region. An explanation popular with the experts
and historians in that Chhattisgarh is the corrupted form of 'Chedisgarh' or
the political seat of the Chedis.

History of Chhattisgarh

According to a mythological legend, Ram, during his Vanvas stayed in Dakshin
Kosala. Which is modern day Chhattisgarh. The unbroken history of
Chhattisgarh or of South Kosala can be traced back to fourth century AD and
its mythological history goes back as far back as the Mahabarata and the
Ramayana. About the history of the region the famous historian C.W.Wills
writes, 'in the 10th century AD a powerful Rajput family ruled at Tripuri
near Jabalpur, Issuing from this kingdom of Chedi (also known as Kalchuri
dynasty) a scion of the royal house by the name Kalingraja, settled about
the year 1000AD, at Tuman, a site at present marked only by a few ruins in
the north east of the erstwhile Laphazamidari of The Bilaspur district. His
grandson Ratanraja founded Ratanpur Which continued as the capital of a
large part of the country now known as Chhattisgarh. This Rajput family
called themselves the Haihaya dyanasty. This dynasty continued ruling
Chhattisgarh for six centuries about the 14th century it split into parts,
the elder branch continued at Ratanpur, while the younger settled in
semi-independent state at Raipur. At the end of 16th century it acknowledged
the suzerainty of the Mughals, In Bastar, in the middle ages, Chalukya
dynasty established its rule. The first Chalukya ruler was Annmdev, who
established the dynasty in Bastar in 1320 .
The Marathas attacked Chhattisgarh in 1741 and destroyed the Haihaya power.
In 1745 AD after conquering the region, they deposed Raghunathsinghji, the
last surviving member of the Ratanpur house. In 1758, the Maraths finally
annexed Chhattisgarh, it came directly under Maratha rule and Bimbaji
Bhonsle, was appointed the rule. After death of Bimbaji Bhonsle, the
Marathas adopted the Suba system. The Maratha rule was a period of unrest
and misrule. There was large-scale loot and plunder by the Maratha army. The
Maratha officials were openly surrendering the interests of the region to
the British. As a result of this, the region became extremely poor and the
people began resenting the Maratha rule. Only the Gonds continued to resist
and challenge the advances of the Marathas and this led to several conflicts
and much animosity between the Gonds and the Marathas (Captain Blunt, 1975).
The Pindaris also attacked and plundered the region in the beginning of the
Nineteenth Century.

In 1818 Chhattisgarh came under some sort of British control for the first
time. In 1854, when the province of Nagpur lapsed to the British government,
Chhattisgarh was formed into a deputy commissionership with its headquarters
at Raipur. Historian C.W. Wills, writing about Chhattisgarh says,
Chhattisgarh presents the remarkable picture of a Hindu government
continuing till modern times outside the sphere of direct Mohammedancontrol.
The British made certain changes in the administrative and revenue systems
of Chhattisgarh, which adversely affected the people of Chhattisgarh. The
intrusion of the British was resisted strongly in Bastar by the tribals and
the Halba rebellion which lasted nearly five year (1774-1779) was the first
documented rebellion against the British and Marathas in Bastar.

The First war of independence in 1857 was spearheaded in Chhattisgarh by Vir
Narain Singh who was a benevolent jamindar of Sonakhan. The British arrested
him in 1856 for looting a trader's grain stocks and distributing it amongst
the poor in a severe famine year. In 1857 with the help of the solders of
the British Army at Raipur, Vir Narain Singh escaped form prison. He reached
Sonakhan and formed an army of 500 men. Under the leadership of Smith, a
powerful British army was dispatched to crush the Sonakhan army. The British
succeeded after a prolonged battle and Vir Narain Singh was arrested and
later hanged on the 10th December, 1857. He became the first martyr from
Chhattisgarh in the War of Independence. Vir Narain Singh's martyrdom has
been resurrected in the 1980's and he has become a potent symbol of
Chhattisgarhi pride.

Social Structure and Configuration

Women in Chhattisgarh have traditionally enjoyed a kind of freedom denied to
women elsewhere in the country. This position of women continues to be very
much the same even in modern times. This comes out strongly from available
data and from the general Development index in the Human Development Report
(1998) of the Government of Madhya Pradesh. The districts of Chhattisgarh
fare much better and rank higher in the Gender Development Index than most
other districts of Madhya Pradesh. The relative freedom to women is evident
in the local traditions and customs. The Pardah system, present in one form
or the other in many parts of India is not present in Chhattisgarh except in
a few Brahmin and Bania Communities. According to another local custom,
women, other than those of these caste can choose to terminate a marriage
relationship and through a custom called Chudi pahanana, it she so desires.
However, a mention of these progressive local customs, in no way suggests
that the ideology of female subservience does not exist in Chhattisgarh. On
the contrary, in spite of this male authority and dominance is seen quite
clearly in the social and cultural life of Chhattisgarh11.

The population of Chhattisgarh is notable for the high proportion of
Scheduled Tribes and for specific Sects primarily constituted of Schedule
Castes. Of the total population of Chhattisgarh, tribals constitute at least
32.5%, which is a significantly high percentage. In the last few decades,
the demographic profile of tribal dominated areas has undergone a change.
This is a cause for concern as it represents large-scale intrusion of non
tribals in tribal areas. This changing demographic profile is strongly
evident in Bastar, where the proportion of tribals has decreased in the last
few decades. The tribal areas of Chhattisgarh have witnessed several
rebellions starting from 1774 onwards against the intrusion by outsiders,
primarily the British, in the domain of traditional rights and the tribal
way of life. Interestingly, since the 17th century, the social history of
the non-tribal areas of Chhattisgarh has been marked by reform movements
such as the Satnam sect. Kabir Panthis and the Movements of share croppers
and agricultural labour. Despite presence of a high tribal population and
religious reform movements, the region is also the domain of classic Hindu
culture (although in some rituals the impact of tribal rituals can be
identified), in which the cult of Ram assumes an essential and central role.
Impact of this domination in evident and has its manifestations in the
growth of sectarian formations is contemporary politics.

In India, the combined population of the Scheduled Castes and Tribes is
23.6% of the total population and for Madhya Pradesh; this figure rises to
37.1%. The combined population of Scheduled Castes and Tribes in
Chhattisgarh is significantly higher at 44.7% and this is largely due to a
high proportion of tribal population, Although the Scheduled Castes do not
constitute a very high proportion of the total population they are critical
for understanding the social history of Chhattisgarh, which has been deeply
influenced and effected by the religious reform movements.

The Movement for Prathak Chhattisgarh

The demand for a separate Chhattisgarh state was first raised in the early
twenties. Similar demands kept cropping up at regular intervals; however, a
well-organised movement was never launched. Several efforts were made by
individuals and organisations towards highlighting the Chhattisgarh identity
and expressing the sense of perceived marginalisation. There were certain
protests with mass support but these were limited and sporadic. There were
several all-party platforms formed and they usually resolved around
petitions, public meetings, seminars, rallies and bandhs.

A demand for separate Chhattisgarh was raised in 1924 by the Raipur Congress
unit, and later on also discussed in the Annual Session of the Indian
Congress at Tripuri. A discussion also took place of forming a Regional
Congress organisation for Chhattisgarh. Sporadic attempts to give a call for
a separate state for Chhattisgarh continued in the years immediately
following Independence. In 1955, a demand for a separate state was raised in
the Nagpur assembly of the then state of Madhya Bharat.

When the State Reorganisation Commission was set up in 1954, the demand for
a separate Chhattisgarh was put forward to it, through this was not
accepted. It was reported that the State Reorganisation Commission rejected
the demand for Chhattisgarh on the grounds that the prosperity of
Chhattisgarh would compensate for the poverty of other regions of Madhya
Pradesh.

The eighties were a comparatively quiet phase in the demand for
Chhattisgarh. The 1990's saw more activity for a demand for the new state,
such as formation of a state wide political forum, especially the
Chhattisgarh Rajya Nirman Manch. The Late Chadulal Chadrakar led this forum,
several successful region-wide Bandhs and rallies were organised under the
banner of the forum all of which were supported by major political parties
including the Congress and the BJP. The rallies of the all party forum were
attended by leaders from most political parties.

Creation of Chhattisgarh

The Congress Government of Madhya Pradesh took the first institutional and
legislative initiative for the creation of Chhattisgarh. On the 18 of March
1994, a resolution demanding a separate Chhattisgarh was tabled and
unanimously approved by the Madhya Pradesh Vidhan Sabha. Both the Congress
and the Bhartiya Janta Party supported the resolution. The election
manifestos of the Congress and the BJP for both the 1998 and the 1999
parliamentary elections as well as the Madhya Pradesh assembly election of
1998 included the demand for creation of separate Chhattisgarh. In 1998, the
BJP led Union Government drafted a bill for the creation of a separate state
of Chhattisgarh from sixteen districts of Madhya Pradesh. This draft bill
was sent to the Madhya Pradesh assembly for approval. It was unanimously
approved in 1998, although with certain modifications. The union government
did not survive and fresh elections were declared. The new National
Democratic Alliance (NDA) government sent the redrafted Separate
Chhattisgarh Bill for the approval of the Madhya Pradesh Assembly, where it
was once again unanimously approved and then it was tabled in the Lok Sabha.
This bill for a separate Chhattisgarh was passed in the Lok Sabha and the
Rajya Sabha, paving the way for the creation of a separate state of
Chhattisgarh. The President of India gave his consent to The Madhya Pradesh
Reorganisation Act 2000 on the 25 of August 2000. The Government of India
subsequently set the First day of November 2000 as the day on which the
state of Madhya Pradesh would be bifurcated into Chhattisgarh and Madhya
Pradesh. Many political observers have commented on the relatively peaceful
manner in which the Chhattisgarh state has been created.

There is no single factor responsible for the creation of Chhattisgarh. It
is in fact a complex interplay of a combination of factors that paved the
path for a separate state. The long standing demand and the movement for
Uttarakhand and Jharkhand which led to the acceptance of separate states for
these two regions, created a sensitive environment for the Prithak
Chhattisgarh demand. Therefore, the creation of Chhattisgarh coincided with
the creation of these two states and became a concurrent process. Another
important factor leading to the creation of Chhattisgarh was that there was
clear acceptance, within Chhattisgarh and outside that Chhattisgarh had a
distinct socio-cultural regional identity that had evolved over centuries. A
consensus had evolved and emerged on the distinctiveness of Chhattisgarh.
The people of Chhattisgarh accepted this and saw Prithak Chhattisgarh as
giving expression to this identity. A sense of relative deprivation had also
developed in the region and people felt that a separate state was imperative
for development to take place in the region. In a democratic polity, the
people's demand has a high degree of legitimacy and weight. Therefore the
people's demand voiced through democratic channels was heard and contributed
immensely to the creation of Chhattisgarh.

The consensus regarding the distinctiveness of Chhattisgarh did not remain
limited to its socio-cultural identity. All over Madhya Pradesh, the
consensus on a need for separate Chhattisgarh was also carefully developed.
This consensus cuts across geographical regions castes, classes and
political parties. A strong reflection of this consensus was evident in the
unanimous passing of the Chhattisgarh bill in the Madhya Pradesh Vidhan
Sabha. This consensus is a pointer to the high degree of maturity of Madhya
Pradesh polity and the smooth passage of the Prithak Chhattisgarh bill
resulting in the peaceful and unanimous creation of a new state a tribute to
this maturity.

Seed of Protest and Change

Guru Ghasidas and the Satnam Panth

Chhattisgarh primarily due to its large tribal population has historically
not been a part of the mainstream and has therefore remained underdeveloped.
Critical indicators for education and health have remained low. However, as
stated above, the region was influenced by mainstream traditional Hindu
culture as the overaching organising principle despite the presence of a
large percentage of Scheduled Castes and Tribes. This oppressive,
hierarchical social and religious order was not accepted, and from the 17th
century onwards, the social history of Chhattisgarh is marked by the process
of questioning and protests in the form of a number of socio-religious
reform movements. These movements established a tradition of protest and
have played a critical role in creation of the identity of Chhattisgarh,
Initiated by sects like the Satnam Panth, the kabirpanthis and the Raedasis
spread over all over Chhattisgarh, they carried the message of equality.
Often the spread of these movement was within the boundaries of Chhattisgarh
and therefore these movements contributed indirectly towards creating a
regional consciousness.

An illustrative case would be the Satnam Panth, which emerged as sectarian
formation, primarily reconstituting a small number of dalit groups by
incorporating them as Satnamis, The Satnam Panths was an attempt to
negotiate and cope with the cultural and economic processes in Chhattisgarh
in the nineteenth century. It was a new sect, formed primarily amongst the
poors of Chhattisgarh in the second decade of the nineteenth century and was
led by Ghasidas, a humble farm worker. This community constituted a
significant proportion, a little less then one sixth, of the total
population of Chhattisgarh. They either owned land or were sharecroppers and
farm workers. The new sect was given the name of Satnam and its followers
were expected to believe only in the formless - Satnam or the true name.
Gradually, the followers of this sect were given the name satnamis. Satnamis
abstain from meat, liquor, tobacco, certain vegetables and red pulses.
Satnam Panth rejected the deities and idols of the Hindu pantheon. The panth
preaches a casteless order. Guru Ghasidas initiated a Guru parampara in the
sect, which became hereditary. The main religious centres of the sect in
Chhattisgarh are Bhandar and Girod.

In the nineteenth century a new system of property rights and revenue
collection known as the malgujari settlement was intorduced in Chhattisgarh.
The new system was implemented with the sole purpose of expropriation and
exploitation of marginal farmers, sharcropers and farm servants by the upper
caste Malgujars. Satnam Panth and its followers responded to this
exploitative system through various strategies. In several cases the
Satnamis deserted villages or continued with the process of Lakhabatta or
the periodic redistribution of land, despite the implementation of the new
system. Their united challenge to the upper caste Malgujars over the issues
of rent and loss of land in the last decade of the nineteenth century was a
reflection of the solidarity of Satnamis . This form of protest and response
to the new system or property rights and malgujari settlements was
widespread among the Satnamis of Chhattisgarh.

The primary concern of the Anglo Maratha politics in the Nineteenth century
was of expropriation and consolidation of power. Guru Ghasidas the founder
of the Satmani sect realised this. He believed that the politics of the
Anglo-Marathas was deprived of morality. He worked towards uniting all
downtrodden persons to morally oppose the immoral politics of the British
The people of Chhattisgarh realised the potential threat of the British and
were terror struck by the exploitative nature of their policies. Despite
this, they were unable to unite under one flag to oppose the British. It was
at this juncture that Ghasidas made efforts to unite the people of
Chhattisgarh through the ideology of equality and non-violence.
Other sects emerged in response to the hierarchical social order and linked
Chhattisgarh to other social reform movements in the country. However the
regional specificities of these sects remained unaltered.

Kabir Panthis for example, are largely recruited from dalits and have a
substantial presence in Chhattisgarh. The followers of this sect adhere to
the teachings and principles of Kabir, the revolutionary social reformer
saint poet of the sixteenth century. The centres of Kabir Panth activities
are monasteries which are placed in the charge of Mahants. In Chhattisgarh,
Kabir Panthi monasteries are in Kudurmal, Kharsia, Champa, Hardi, Bangoli,
Banni, Dhamdha, Panda, Tarai and Ratanpur. The Kabir Panth does not believe
in caste hierarchies. However in contemporary times the Panth has been
divided along caste lines. The only time that they do not adhere to caste
hierarchies is in the presence of the Chief Guru on the birth anniversary of
Kabir. All who desire to become members of the Panth are required to
renounce polytheism and to acknowledge their belief in only one god. The
Kabir Panth of Chhattisgarh are descendents of Dharmadasa, one of the
disciples of Kabir who established the Panth in Chhattisgarh. There fore the
branch of the Kabir Panth in Chhattisgarh is also known as Dharmadasa or
Bhai branch.

The Ramnami Panth is small sect in Chhattisgarh with a membership primarily
from the dalit community. This sect propagates the cult of Rama among the
dalits and does not believe in Brahmins as a medium for worshipping god.
Ramnamis are found chiefly on the southern side of the Mahanadi in
Chhattisgarh. This sect is easily distinguishable as they carry a flute and
put peacock feathers around their caps. Ramnamis as the name suggests chant
the name of Ram. They of ten get their bodies tattooed with the name of Ram.

The social religious reformer Ramananda had a committed dalit follower from
Chhattisgarh. His name was Ravi Das or Rae Das. Gradually, the followers of
Rae Das formed a separate sect and started calling themselves Rae Das
Panthis or simply Raedasis. A striking similarity between all these sects is
that the followers are drawn mostly from the Dalit communities. Secondly all
these sects spread the message of equality.

The most widespread and important rebellion was the Bhumkal rebellion of
1910 that spread to 46 of the 84 parganas of Bastar. The term Bhumkal is
significant as it refers to the social solidarity of the members of a clan
that binds them to each other and to their specific Bhumor land. The basic
reasons listed for the Bhumkal rebellion by historians clearly reaffirms the
findings from earlier rebellions. It continued the tradition of tribal
struggle for preserving and defending their traditions and their way of life
and for reasserting their traditional rights on forests, land and natural
resources. One of the main reasons for the rebellion is given by Standan
dispossession of traditional forests and land resources had been the most
important cause of the Bhumkal rebellion. In 1908, the forests were first
made reserved forests and the contractors given rights to take timber and
wood for railway sleepers. This deprived the tribals of one of their main
sources of their livelihood. Leasing out of liquor monopolies also
aggravated the situation, as the locally made country liquor was declared
illegal. The introduction of education and schools was seen by the tribals
as an attempt by the State to subvert their culture and therefore became a
precipitating factor. Finally, the brutality and exploitation by the police,
which included begar by the officials culminated in the Bhumkal rebellion.

Tribal Protests and Rebellions

Bhumkal in Bastar (1910)

Chhattisgarh is generally perceived as a tribal dominated state. Although
this is factually incorrect it does reflect the significantly high
proportion of tribals in the region. It also underscores a fundamentally
important point that the tribals in Chhattisgarh have been able to retain
their culture and traditional way of life despite the all pervasive
influence of forces of modernity. While tribal people constitute 7.8 % and
23 % of the total population of India and Madhya Pradesh respectively they
constitute 32.5 % of the population of Chhattisgarh. According to the 1991
census the tribal population in the then districts of Chhattisgarh was Durg
-12.6 %, Raipur -18.6%, Rajnandgaon -25.3 %, Bilaspur -23.4 % Surguja -54.8
%, Raigarh - 45.5%, Bastar -67.7 %. The various tribes in the Chhattisgarh
region are Gonds, Muria, Bhumja, Baiga, Kanars, Kawars, Halbas etc. A few of
these tribes particularly the Gonds have influenced by the Hindu tradition
and have in turn influenced local practices in the Hindu tradition as well.
Other tribes like the Kamars and the
Baigas have largely been untouched by the mainstream and have retained more
of their traditional culture and way of life.

Chhattisgarh has withnessed several tribal rebellions starting from the late
18 century through the 19 century to the first few decades of the 20
century. Some of these tribal revolts were localised while others were more
widespread. Geographically too, the rebellions were not centered in one
region, in some of them precipitating factors were immediate and local in
nature and in some the revolt took its time to brew. However the central
narrative of these rebellions remained largely common and unchanged. All
these rebellions were focussed and asserted the traditionally inalienable
right of the tribals on the local resources land and forests. Often the
mobilisation was around the issues of tradition culture and the tribal way
of life. These rebellions were also protest against an alien system of
governance and an alien political, economic and social order that had been
forced upon them by the British. These tribal rebellions, although they
predominantly took place in Bastar were spread across the various tribal
areas of Chhattisgarh as well. The assimilation of this tradition of protest
and rebellion by the tribals will be critical in any attempt to forge a
Chhattisgarh identify and for evolving a vibrant and inclusive Chhattisgarh
ethos. An understanding of these rebellions and integrating them in the new
Chhattisgarh ethos will contribute to the future and the success of the new
state. In this section we shall briefly discuss the tribal rebellions of
Chhattisgarh. The key tribal rebellions are listed:

1. Halba rebellion (1774-79)
2. Bhopalpatnam Struggle (1795)
3. Paralkot rebellion (1825)
4. Tarapur rebellion (1842-54)
5. Maria rebellion (1842-63)
6. First Freedom Struggle (1856-57)
7. Koi revolt (1859)
8. Muria rebellion (1876)
9. Rani rebellion (1878-82)
10. Bhumkal (1910)

The Halba rebellion is a very important event in the history of Bastar as it
was responsible for the decline of the Chalukya dynasty, which in turn
created circumstances that first brought the Marathas and then the British
to the region. The rebellion was initiated in 1774 by the governor of
Dongar, Ajmer Singhwith the intention of establishing an independent kingdom
at Dongar. The Halba tribe and Halba soldiers supported him. However, the
fundamental reasons for the rebellion were economic in nature. There had
been a prolonged famine, which had severely affected the people who had very
little cultivable land. The presence of Maratha forces and the terror caused
by the East India Company in these adverse circumstances precipitated the
rebellioin. The stronger armies of Bastar supported by the British and the
Marathas crushed the rebellion. A massacre of Halba tribesmen followed the
defeat of the Halba army. However, the revolt created conditions for the
decline of the Chalukya dynasty which in turn significantly altered the
history of Bastar.

The Paralkot rebellion was representative of the resentment felt by the
Abujhmarias against the invasion of outsiders, primarily the Marathas and
the British. This rebellion was supported by the Abujhmarias and was led by
Gend Singh a fellow Abhujmaria. One of the objectives of the rebellion was
to establish a world free of loot, plunder and exploitation. The presence of
the Marathas and the British threatened the identity of the Abujmarias and
they resisted this through organising the rebellion of Paralkot in 1825. The
rebels were opposing the taxes levied by the Maratha rulers. In essence this
rebellion was directed against the foreign interference and control of
Bastar and wanted to re-establish the freedom of Bastar.

The rebellion of Tarapur (1842-54) was once again the assertion of the
tribals against the invasion of their local culture and the tampering with
their traditional principles of social, economic and political organization.
It started with an opposition to taxes levied under the pressure of
Anglo-Maratha rule. For the tribals, these experiences of coercive taxation
were alien and new, and therefore they opposed them. The local Diwan became
a symbol of oppression and bore the brunt of tribal anger.

The Maria rebellion, which lasted nearly 20 years from 1842 to 1863, was
seemingly in favour of an inhuman practice of human sacrifice. In reality
the revolt was against the insensitive and intrusive handling of tribal
faith. The Anglo Maratha combine did not hesitate to enter and pollute the
temple of Danteswari. The facts clearly indicate that this rebellion was
more defensive in nature and was waged by the tribals to protect their land
and tradition. Furer Hamendorf (Aboriginal Rebellions in the Deccan, Man in
India, No.4,1945, PP 2089) writes all these rebellions were defensive
movements, they were the last resort of tribesmen driven to despair by the
encroachments of outsiders on their land and economic resources What is
surprising is not the occurrence of uprisings, but the infrequency of
violent reaction on the part of the aboriginals to the loss of their
ancestral lands and to their economic enslavement. Hutton extends the
analysis and writes (as quoted in H.L. Shukla, Baster Ka Mukti Sangram, p
118) early days of British administration did great detriment to the
economic position of tribes through ignorance and neglect of their right and
customs.

Bastar was also actively involved in the First War of Iindependence of 1857
with Southern Bastar as the centre of the revolt. Under the leadership of
Dhruvarao a batle was waged against the British. He belonged to one of the
Maria tribes called Dorlaon and was supported by his tribesmen.
Later in 1858, the Gonds challenged the British in several battles. In 1859
a very important rebellion began to take shape in Southern Bastar with the
tribals refusing to let contractors undertake cutting of Sal trees. The
people of these Jamindaris were called Kois. This rebellion was against the
decision of the British to give contracts for cutting forests to contractors
from Hyderabad. These contractors were also responsible for the exploitation
of the tribals. The local tribals in 1859 decided that they would not allow
the felling of a single tree. The British took this as a challenge to the
might of the empire and used coercive methods to continue the felling of
trees. This rebellion was loud and clear assertion by the tribals of their
inalienable rights of the tribals on their forests and natural resources.

In 1867, Gopinath Kapardas was appointed the Diwan of Bastar State and was
responsible for large scale exploitation of the tribal population. Tribals
from different parganas jointly requested the King to remove the Diwan but
the King did not concede to these demands. This led to the Muria Revolt of
1876 The rebelling tribals surrounded Jagdalpur on 2 March 1876; the King
with great difficulty was able to inform the British forces. Finally a
strong British army sent by the Resident of Orissa, crushed the rebellion.

Emerging Identity and Socio-Cultural Spaces

New Chhattisgarh in New India

The socio-religious reform movements and the tribal rebellions, contributed,
although indirectly to emerging consciousness in the region. Guru Ghasidas
clearly articulated the need to consolidate and create regional
consciousness and solidarity to fight against exploitation. Similarly, other
sects with their message of equality and solidarity also influenced the
unfolding regional narrative. The tribal rebellions deeply affected the
political, social and economic discourse of Chhattisgarh. The issue of
people's rights over local resources was brought centre stage.It also raised
the fundamental question of identity and preserving traditional culture and
way of life. The evolution and formation of a formal Chhattisgarh identity
coincided with the national movement and it was in this period that the
process of crystallisation of a Chhattisgarh identity was initiated and a
distinct identity started emerging and taking definite shape in the social
and cultural sphere.

Pandit Sunderlal Sharma, Thakur Pyarelal Singh and Khub Chand Baghel were
members of the Indian National Congress and some of the prominent leaders of
the national movement in Chhattisgarh. These leader did not confine
themselves merely to political activity; they were involved in initiating as
well as actively participating in socio-cultural reform movements. These
leaders also reiterated the fact that Chhattisgarh had a distinct
socio-cultural identity and used this as a base for reform encourage the
formation of a Chhattisgarhi consciousness amongst the masses through
literacy drives cultural activities and social reform programmes.

The literature of the period also reflected the search for and an attempt to
establish a distinctive identity. As early as 1901, M R Sapre from Pendra
Road published a magazine called ' Chhattisgarh Mitra' which focussed on the
region. Khub Chand Baghel who was waging a struggle against untouchability
wrote plays called 'Jarnail Singh ' and 'Unch Neech' . During this period,
leaders were also writing plays that focussed on social issues in the
context of Chhattisgarhi identity. Pt. Sundarlal Sharma wrote ' Daan Lila '
and R.C. Deshmukh wrote ' Naacha ' and ' Gumbad'. Vaman Rao Deshmukh , an
important cooperative leader of the times was specifically writing about the
identity of Chhattisgarh.

Pandit Sundar Lala Sharma who was one of the most prominent leaders of
Central India , fought against the caste system and worked continuously for
an improvement in the condition of dalits. In 1917, he broke the forest laws
in Sihawa with the support of the tribals. Three years later, in 1920, Pt.
Sharma initiated the Nahar Satyagrah in Kandal village, Durg district,
against the tax on water. In 1925, he entered a temple with a group of
dalits. Thakur Pyarelal Singh, also known as the father of the cooperative
movement in Chhattisgarh, was a Gandhian with a reformatory zeal. He
organised the first labour movement of Chhattisgarh in Rajnandgaon in 1920.
This movement was started to demand a fixed number of working hours. Later
in the same region, the second and the third labour movement of 1924 and
1925 were also organised under the leadership of Pyare Lal Singh.
By the time India gained Independence in 1947, the discourse on regional
identity had changed its focus from social reform movements to the issue of
exploitation of Chhattisgarh. Multiple channels of expression of this demand
were used. A journal called ' Chhattisgarh Chhatisgarhion Ka or Chhattisgarh
belongs to the people of Chhattisgarh was started by Khub Chand Baghel.
Another journal called ' Chhattisgarh Atma Ki Pukar' or The voice of the
Soul of Chhattisgarh which also dealt with the same issues was also
published and is especially looked into the significance of possessing a
cultural identity and initiated a movement for establishing pride in
Chhattisgarhi culture. In 1956, Chedi Lal Barrister with the support of Khub
Chand Baghel organised the Chhattisgarh Mahasabha at Rajnandgaon. This
meeting was attended by members of all parties and was supported by various
caste groups and associations of Chhattisgarh. It is reported that the
Mahasabha was attended by more than 50,000 people. The Mahasabha passed a
resolution stating that the 'Art and Culture of Chhattisgarh should get fair
opportunity to grow'. A decision to launch the journal ' Chhattisgarh' was
taken. The Mahasabha unanimously resolved to work towards solving the
problems of the region as well as to struggle for the rights of
Chhattisgarh.

The movement for consolidating the Chhattisgarh identity has continued
through the decades. It would become dormant for some years and then against
erupt in some other district. It is therefore, impossible to create a linear
pattern of the creation of Chhattisgarh identity. However, it is important
to underscore that the multilayered and multilateral process of formulating
and expressing Chhattisgarhi identity took place over a long period of time.
Various other political and non-political formations have, within the
framework of their ideological positions and worldview, been working towards
the formation of an identity for Chhattisgarh.

Chhattisgarh Samaj an organisation formed under the umbrella of the Proutist
Sarva Samaj Samiti has working for the development of a political, social
and cultural consciousness of Chhattisgarh. Since the late sixties the Samaj
has been publishing a weekly news paper in Chhattisgarhi through which they
have been working for the growth of the Chhattisgarhi language. Through the
different wings of the Samja, an attempt is being made to spread regional
consciousness which they believe will then translate into the development of
Chhattisgarh. A diametrically opposite non-party political formation
struggling for the identity of Chhattisgarh is Chhattisgarh Mukti Morcha or
the CMM.

This mass based peoples movement started as a trade union movement and then
moved on to link the exploitation of the region to the fact that its
cultural identity had been suppressed. Gradually the movement started
focussing on the struggle of Chhattisgarh against the exploitative
oppressive and hegemonic mainstream.

On 19 December, 1979, in an attempt to link the tradition of struggle to the
ethos of Chhattisgarh, the CMM then the CMSS, initiated the tradition of
observing Shahid Vir Narain Singh's date of execution by the British as
martyr's day.

The identity of Chhattisgarh has been created and evolved through a complex
process that has largely charted its own course. A combination of cultural
historical social economic and political factors have contributed to this
process. The wide pluralities of cultures, traditions, histories and customs
existing in the region have combined to form a unique mixture that has fed
into the development of the Chhattisgarh ethos and identity. However, the
key point is that the identity of Chhattisgarh cannot be viewed as separate
form the people of Chhattisgarh. It is important to note that the
Chhattisgarh identity has been asserted in different forms and has become
more pronounced in adverse circumstances manifesting itself especially as
protest against exploitation. Dr H L Shukla distinguishes between self image
and other image for a more holistic understanding of Chhattisgarh identity
and ethos. It is imperative to synthesize and blend the two images to
understand the priorities and challenges facing new Chhattisgarh. The
identity of Chhattisgarh is an inclusive identity, in spite of the movement
for Prathak Chhattisgarh. There exists in the Chhattisgarh identity while
being sensitive towards as well as protecting and preserving the plurality
of customs, traditions and cultures.
