Lock for a Bent Trike?

I'm a little alarmed to read the guideline that the value of a bike's
lock should be 10% of the value of the bike. That would put the lock on
the recumbent trike I am hoping to receive tomorrow at - 400 Euros?

There has to be a point at which this ratio fails! I'm cleaned out and
don't have that kind of money, even if a lock existed in that price
range. For the moment I was just going to borrow Behemoth's heavy
D-lock, a value of less than 50 Euros.

So what do you bent-riders use to lock up the precious one?

I use two D-locks. One at the rear, through the rear triangle &amp; one at the
front through a wheel. If space, I'll also thread a cable lock around &amp;
through bits too. The bottom line is nothing will stop a really determined
thief, but the idea is to make your steed less attractive to an opportunist
thief than the steed next to it... Also - check your insurance policy to see
what is required by way of locking, so that if the worst happens and your
steed is stolen, at least you can claim a replacement on your insurance
policy.

Haven't got the insurance yet, but I already know what it entails. First
the trike must have a Fubicy tatoo and be registered in the police
database, which can't happen immediately, alas, since there are only a
few places that do tatooing in the Paris area and my Darth isn't one of
them. Then it needs to be attached by a D-lock (and there are several
models that are &quot;insurance approved&quot;) to a _fixed_ point. This latter is
problematic because in the covered parking at my workspace there is no
fixed point for attachment of bikes. Provision was reluctantly made for
Flyzipper by putting a heavy chain around a concrete pillaster. So I
lock Fly by chaining him to the chain. I don't bother with a D or the
insurance since it would be obviated anyway, although Fly is tattooed.

But the Trike will need to be insured and at that point the lack of a
fixed point for chaining is going to be an issue. Unfortunatly I can't
see my employer making any provision for proper bike parking because
they always like to throw it back to me that I'm &quot;the only one&quot; who
would use it. (There is in fact one other regular cyclist, but he has a
Brommie which he brings inside with him. Overall, the mood in French
workplaces is actively to _discourage_ cycling, since it causes
complications with respect to accident coverage and &quot;accidents du
travail&quot;. Dunno if Sarko, who's trying to bill himself as the new Mr.
Environment, will do anything to change this.)

I think that would take too long and I'm not for carting it up and down
two flights of stairs to my office. Although it does nominally fold,
people with similar tell me in practise that it isn't the sort of thing
you would do on a regular basis. Only for the odd Eurostar trip or to
get into someone's boot if for some reason I can't ride home. Flyzipper
also folds and despite being only half the size of the trike I wouldn't
want to do this with him either. Last time I put him in a bag it took
about 15 minutes either end and he hated it.

One of those &quot;guidlines&quot; created to fit some of the people, some of the

Pretty standard long-shank Kryptonite D-lock through back wheel and
frame and preferably some immovable object.  Ideally a subsequent cable
for the front, but 20&quot; wheels aren't in big demand and it doesn't have a
QR, so don't usually bother despite the SON in it.
On your trike the front wheels aren't going to go AWOL to sell as
there's no real avenue to sell them on and it's not obvious how to get
them off, so it remains the usual back wheel and frame.
The trike is helped by the awkwardness of picking it up and running away
with it, being both fairly heavy and fairly awkward.  It will
intrinsically be a lot safer than a high end road bike or MTB because it
sticks out like a sore thumb and someone stealing it to sell it on would
have to be pretty dense to try, or be /very/ well connected with buyers
in distant places, and someone willing to go to that sort of trouble for
a recumbent trike could probably just buy one anyway.

You do need to do some securing against joyriders though, but a lot of
theft-proofness is it's hard to sell on and folk aren't sure quite how
it works just by looking at it.  In other words, do as you would do on
your other bikes, and Don't Panic!

Personally, I'd like to hear a single report of a recumbent theft.  They
may indeed be more valuable than many uprights, but the market is so
vanishingly small that I can't imagine they're much of a target.  A
standard cable lock that reaches around wheel and frame should be
sufficient.

In one of the above cases the reason was probably joyriding, and
something that looks like a 'bent might invite that sort of attention.

It seems kind of quaint to tatoo an ID number on an orange recumbent

I often don't bother to lock my ratty £20 eBay fixie, even in central
Edinburgh. The resale value would be near nil and with a 25&quot; frame it
can only be ridden by a small percentage of the Scottish population!

It reinforces the &quot;all bikes weigh the same&quot; argument, that the
lighter the bike, the heavier the lock needed and hence the overall
weight stays roughly constant.

They do get taken.  Some are just recovered as the thief decides they don't
know what to do with it. Others are found when attempted to be sold on (ring
the maker if buying s/hand to check the seller's credentials, sales are so
small that most makers could keep a record of every one sold, and certainly
every one reported stolen).

I would agree in all but the most thief-friendly locations; a hidden carpark
with time to work on the lock requires some more thought.

Back at the OP's comment about no secure posts to lock to at place of work,
how about asking employer about parking an old van permenantly in a space,
and then putting trike inside the van ? (The van could be as old as
possible, preferably with flat tyres, or a wheel missing, to make it hard to
tow away).    Might concentrate employer's mind about installing a
ground-anchor ring (the type of thing used to secure a motorcycle to the
ground with a chain).   Once there is a decent quality ring, then a heavy
quality chain with decent lock can be left there permenantly, and the trike
locked when arriving at work.

I don't think that ten-percent guideline is too far off the mark
considering most bikes cost less than $1000.

A decent U-lock is ~$35, a good padlock and chain ~$100.
A ten dollar lock is probably even insufficient for a $100 bike you
want to keep

If I had a Trek Madone to lock up at work, I'd want that weight of
locks on it. I wouldn't carry them back and forwards on the bike though.
(And I'd want a more secure thing to lock it to than the racks there at

Aldi have done £1.99 cable locks. For a bike you can replace for £20,

That's terribly simplistic thinking. Buy the lock that's strong enough
for your local level of threat. Here in my city of a million--I see
thousand dollar bikes locked with cables that seem to keep not getting
stolen. I prefer a small shackle OnGuard and a cable for my front
wheel for the conventional bikes. That's way over-locked for these
parts and gives me peace. In NYC it would be a case of under-locking.

The whole deal is to slow them down. A couple moderately priced

&gt; Personally, I'd like to hear a single report of a recumbent theft.  They
&gt; may indeed be more valuable than many uprights, but the market is so
&gt; vanishingly small that I can't imagine they're much of a target.  A
&gt; standard cable lock that reaches around wheel and frame should be
&gt; sufficient.

I know of an Optima Baron that was stolen in Chicagoland. I imagine the
components were stripped, and the seat, handlebars and frame tossed in
the dumpster. :(

&gt;&gt;value. That's a savings of 200 Euros. (Shipping and handling extra)

&gt; I don't think that ten-percent guideline is too far off the mark

Depends where.

Two of my bikes would cost more than £2,000 to replace, and I've never in
my life owned a bike lock costing more than £10. There are parts of the
world where dishonesty is common, and others where it isn't.

Mind you when at work my bike is inside the (secure) building, which maybe
counts as a million-pound lock!

I have a Windcheetah and after negotiating a good insurance rate because
trikes are somewhat obvious to steel then as long as the bike is locked if
in a public place then its covered.

I must admit that after touring round many parts of UK and Erope I have
never had a problem.

Best regards

Hi
I have a recumbent trike for10 years  and have cycled and locked it
hundreds of times in several European countries.
I always try to lock it where it is overlooked.
For day locking I use a multi strand 1 metre strop 3/8 diameter
plastic covered- locked with a circular standard lock costing £10
Overnight I cover it with a grubby builders polythene purpose made
cover- seams are held together with duct tape.
I add a Kryptonite u lock to lock the back wheel.
I use &quot;unattractive&quot; components-eg hub brakes-Shimano mid range rings
gears-20&quot;wheels Sachs 7x3 hub.
I do not take it to locations where there are expert bike thieves-eg
Amsterdam and sadly- France-because my rusty upright-which had no
value-was cut from the back of my car in Arras of all places.
Its just a question of common sense-and-luck- where I lock my bike in
Berlin my friend has had two bikes stolen in 4 years-but-she leaves
them locked in the same place all summer.
One year I lost my lock key and cut through the 3/8 strop in 5 minutes
using a junior hack saw-it was broad daylight in a busy street-the
only people interested were the Berlin bin men-who offered lots of
practical-and unprintable advice.

Hey, I replaced the stock wheel on one of my bicycles with a 20-inch
(ISO 406-mm) wheel with a SRAM/Sachs 3x7 hub. Are you calling me
unattractive? ;)

Thats a wise move for touring.

You can get spokes-rim-tyres for a 20&quot; wheel anywhere.
My SRAM3X7 hub has gone through two drive trains in 15000 miles-cassete
chain front and back mechs-its bullet proof and you can change gear while
stationery-very important in hilly-city terrain.
In my experience European bike thieves are attracted to high tech stuff disc
brakes fancy suspensions high end mechs-hub gear bikes are not so attractive
to them.
My source of info are the bike stolen posters in the street and in bike
shops.
In the basement of my Berlin flat a high tech mountain bike was locked to a
3 inch gas pipe with a very expensive lock-it was stolen within  8 weeks
bike cost 3500 euros.
I wonder if a canvas cover would have postponed the theft.

I did manage to break the indicator chain on my SRAM Spectro 3x7,
leaving the hub stuck in high range. Now I alway carry a spare indicator
chain, since the part is very small and light.

Yup did that to- I used a bit of scrap inner cable in my tool bag-which I
always carry- to connect the broken link.
It is now my get home spare.
Must admit I m a bit paranoid about the hub gearchange bit when I pack the
trike for air travel usually I end up gaffer taping it to the rear
suspension.
I use a Sturmey Archer cheapo trigger lever to change the hub it works but
its pretty crude.
