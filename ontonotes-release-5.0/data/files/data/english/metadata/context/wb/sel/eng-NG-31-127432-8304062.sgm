AREOPOLIS, Greece -- When someone poses that perennial question, &quot;What
did you do on your vacation?&quot; our family has a zinger of a response:
&quot;We went to Hades and back!&quot;

To be sure, Mani Peninsula is not the Greece you know. It is a
mysterious mountain province, an untamed land of stone towers and a
destination fabled in ancient writing. Here, honor is paramount -- so
much so, that vendettas of an intensity that would surprise a Hatfield
or McCoy dominated several centuries.

The capital, Areopolis, is named for Ares (Mars), the god of war. But
here, also, is raw beauty. From the sheer palisades to the signature
towers erected as protection during those centuries of honor feuding,
the rock displays its gorgeous face. The Maniat men, rock-solid
themselves, tell you of their Spartan ancestors.

Mani (or as some say, the Mani) sits on the central of three
south-pointing fingers in the Peloponnese. Mount Taygetus cascades
down the length of the peninsula, rising to 8,000 feet and separating
the Aegean and Ionian seas. And at Cape Tenaron on the southern tip
the ancients did, indeed, place the entrance to Hades. So hauntingly
lovely is this moonscape, though, that it could just as well be the
gateway to heaven.

Intriguing Mani had long topped my travel wish list. My late father, a
Boston physician for five decades, was born just south of Areopolis.
On a family videotape, he describes Mani's Hellenic roots.
&quot;Historically, Mani goes back to the Trojan War,&quot; he says. &quot;In Homer's
'Iliad' you can read how the Maniat town of Oetylon contributed four
of the 1,000 ships launched by fair Helen's face in 1200 B C.&quot;

I was hooked. My husband and I set out for Greece in July with our two
grown children. Wary of Peloponnesian roads, we hired a
driver/translator in Athens (next time we'll rent a car). I would be
meeting two male first cousins for the first time in Areopolis.

Four hours later, we entered Mani's eastern port, Gythion , which
bustled with a clutter of fishing boats in the harbor, dozens of
taverna tables at dockside, and outdoor ouzo bars displaying hanging
octopi . We nestled overnight at the Cavo Grosso Bungalows by the
beach. The air pulsated with cicadas. Lemon-laden trees and hot-pink
bougainvillea vines splashed the hillside with color.

In the morning, this rainbow world faded to monochrome as we drove
west through the 16-mile mountain pass to Areopolis. Rock and stone
abounded. The gray-on-gray palette was punctuated by occasional
flashes of green.

Then, fused into the mountainside, there loomed the first stone tower
-- a square sentinel with narrow windows and crenellated walls. Soon
others appeared in clusters, like a town of LEGO block castles left
behind by playing giants. They were intriguing, mesmerizing, many
sitting broodingly on the edge of the sea. Once sanctuaries from
Mani's blood feuds (&quot;The goal had been to erect a tower taller than
the offender's, the better to rain down boulders and bullets on his
roof, &quot; my cousin would later tell us), now they are being scooped up
and redone as inns and summer homes.

Many a tale of glory clings to the towers and to the people. The
revolution that freed Greece in 1821 from 400 years of Ottoman
occupation was sparked by a native Maniat son, the revered Petros
Mavromichalis. He hoisted the Greek flag of independence in Areopolis,
named in his honor, after Ares.

Sure enough, as the road opened into Areopolis' s town square, a
bronze Mavromichalis with ballooned breeches, bandana, and a curved
scimitar greeted us. He reigned over a store, inn, church, and two
tavernas. Immediately, a wiry man with a cigarette dangling from his
fingertips arose from an outdoor cafe table, planting kisses --
Greek-style -- on both my cheeks.

&quot;Artemis, at last,&quot; my cousin Yannis greeted me, using ancient Greek
for my name. His brother, Giorgos, a plumper version of himself, was
one of the two local taxi drivers. They ordered up yogurt, bread with
olive oil or honey (both Maniat signatures), and muddy Greek coffee.
We noticed folks with cameras across the way.

&quot;It's Revolutionary Square,&quot; explained Giorgos. The historic site was
blanketed from its narrow streets to its rooftops with cobblestones. A
hole in the road was still intact where Mavromichalis had raised the
Greek flag. To a generation raised on &quot;Les Miserables,&quot; it induced
shivers.

And then, a surprise: &quot;Tonight you're staying in your own tower!&quot;
Yannis proclaimed. He had booked us at Limeni Village, Areopolis' s
unique tower resort that mimics the originals. The complex hangs on a
mountainside over the aqua waters of the Ionian Sea. Little in one's
experience could equal swimming in the pool at cliff's edge, sharing
the stunning panorama with continental vacationers, and then retiring
in fairy-tale fashion to a two-story stone-tower castle. Spartanly
furnished, it protected us admirably -- at least from the afternoon
heat.

With siestas done, the touring continued, our sleek urban taxi
trailing Giorgos's dilapidated cab. A short distance south was Mani's
chief sightseeing draw: the Diros Caves .

&quot;Diros ranks with any world-class tourist attraction,&quot; declared
Giorgos. A swarm of sightseers seemed to agree. The system honeycombs
its way beneath the mountains, running perhaps 43 miles north to
Sparta. We climbed into a wooden punt painted blue on white, like the
Greek flag, and descended through nine fantastical underground
grottos. The boatman navigated with a long pole, gliding beneath
shadowy stalactites and archways, evoking a River Styx crossing. It
came as no surprise that just a ways south at Cape Tenaron was the
cave entrance to Hades.

&quot;Tenaron was where ancients like Persephone, Hercules, and Charon
entered the underworld,&quot; Yannis told us. After our descent through
Diros, we could empathize.

Against dramatic drops to the Aegean, we were soon rounding Tenaron,
where Odysseus had traced the fabled Hades sea cave and summoned the
prophet Tiresias' s shade from below. I was prepared for desolation or
decay -- or even hokey signs telling us to &quot;Go to Hell, here.&quot; But
instead, there was unblemished beauty. Fittingly, an orange glow
suffused the dusk as the dying sun set the ancient sea afire.

Like the wandering Odysseus, we soon took rest in a hidden cove (Porto
Kayio ) with a seaside taverna. The owner, Nikos, had just arrived in
his skiff. He was a Greek bearing one gift we gladly accepted:
&quot;barbouni,&quot; a deep-sea red mullet . Within 30 minutes of Nikos pulling
it from the sea, we were savoring it, char-grilled, with bread,
retsina , and a salad.

Mani is a secret starting to spill. Growing tourism may eventually
tame this wild and glorious region into a commercialized &quot;Greek
Riviera.&quot; But the savvy traveler will consider visiting now, while the
land still belongs to Ares. It could be one hell of a trip.
