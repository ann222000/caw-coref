Apparently, teachers in the Strat school were:

Walter Roche (1569 – 71),
Simon Hunt (1571-75) and
Thomas Jerkins (1575-79)

All three had completed studies at the University of Oxford.
In Stratford they received 20 pounds annual pay, and free
lodgings, which was twice as high as same position in Warwick.

Are there similar lists of the STUDENTS in Stratford at that time?
I recall reading that those documents were destroyed in a fire or
something.

So, if there ARE existing lists of students, and Will is nowhere
on them, it is equally possible he did - or did not - go to school
in Stratford - because unless the lists are absolutely complete,
the absence of his name means nothing.

If there are NO surviving lists, it is likewise possible that he
did - or did not - go to school in Stratford.

For the bright, curious and creative person, a lack of long years
of formal school education followed by a degree does not necessarily
mean they are not able to write good - and/or popular - literature:

Francoise Sagan and Lawrence Durrell both failed their Uni entrance
exams, but went on to succeed as authors.
Lawrence's brother Gerald had no formal school education at all,
but became a pioneer animal conservationist and very popular author.
Truman Capote said of himself:
&quot;I learned to read at a pre-school age. My education has been rather
do-it-yourself. To this day I cannot recite the alphabet or the
multiplication tables. I had already started writing short stories
when I was 14, and some of them were published.
I left school when I was 15.&quot;

Just to mention a few.

Well, we don't know exactly what happened to such
documents. No lists of students in the Stratford
school exist before the 18th century. That's fairly
common for grammar schools outside of London.

Yes, that's what some of us have been saying for years
and years. There are no records of any specific
students in that school, so we can't definitively
prove or disprove whether William Shakespeare attended.
But given his father's position in the town, he would
have been entitled to attend the school for free,
and it's quite reasonable to assume that he did.

It is lore. No one can say.

That we all have instructors and we all poach doesn't mean

20 pounds was good pay, to judge also from what I have about the
school at Ashby-de-la-Zouch. From 1594 (the earliest surviving
accounts) to 1605 the schoolmaster was paid 14 pounds a year, with
part of the school house to live in, out of which he had to pay for
all repairs to both parts of the school house. John Brinsley joined on
those terms, and he was a famous man, author of Ludus Literarius or
The Grammar School (1612) and a number of textbooks and translations.
Among his pupils (1599-1618) were William Lilly the astrologer and
Joseph Hall, bishop of Exeter, then Norwich, and satirist.

Brinsley seems to have thought he was underpaid. In 1606 the trustees
resolved to increase his pay to fifteen pounds a year and to pay up to
one pound towards any repairs he had to do to the his side of the
house, while the trustees themselves undertook the repair of the
school side. That is still well below what Stratford paid under the
town charter of 1560.

(Mind, the Stratford master probably had to pay for repairs out of the
twenty pounds, and very likely for an usher if he needed one -
Chambers does not say either was mentioned in the charter. At Ashby
the first usher was appointed in mid-1600 at two pounds a year
'towards his maintenance'. Perhaps the rest of his income was paid by
the master? Indeed, if so, there might have been an usher previously
and this new payment of two pounds may be another case of Brinsley's
kicking against the pricks.)

Chambers says just &quot;It is unfortunate that no early lists of pupils
are preserved there.&quot; That is not unusual: there are none at Ashby
before (I think) the nineteenth century.

If there were lists, they would probably be complete, because the
master would need to demonstrate that he was doing a good job. That
would be the main reason for having lists - to justify the expense.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;If there are NO surviving lists, it is likewise possible that he

Yes. But if it was a good school (as it should have been at the price)
there would be no motive for going elsewhere.

No, wack. Sahkespeare is said to have gone to the Stratford grammar school

There's no real problem of giving the Stratford man
an elementary education. Let him go to the equilavent
of High School as well, even a university education.

Very likely he had some acquaintance with reading,
maybe he could write, but we haven't proof of either,
but it doesn't much matter. The evidence against the
Stratford man otherwise is more powerful.

But years ago I considered going after the teachers
at the Stratford school. One went to Rome, and
I forget all what else, but it seemed way beyond my
resources to find out if they ever had anything to
say about the STAR of Stratford. Such a quest would
come to nothing anyway. Even if young William had
been in the school, those teachers would have no
reason to remember him unless they were still alive
in 1623, before which there was no notice that the
great poet came from Stratford.

It's a dead end, the debate about Shakespeare's
education, and if he had a bit of it good for him and
all the more shame that, being able to afford the cost,
he never got his daughter's any schooling, so far as
can be determined, and the solid suggestion that they
had none. I know that's not the opinion of the Strats
at this place, but it's the opinion of the great poet's
biographers, all evidence examined.

Absolutely!

Scott McCrea's obsession with Shakespeare's education in his _Skeptic_
article is secondary to McCrea's revelation about all the remarks about
Shakespeare made by Jonson &amp; his ilk that *cannot* be accepted as literally
true.

There are indeed &quot;Two Shakespeares&quot;:

1) the noble one who actually wrote the works and
2) the fictitious one from Stratford discussed by Jonson &amp; friends.

I think you're wrong. It's more reasonable to posit that the son of a
local businessman attended his town's grammar school than that he did
not. I back this up with the following, taken from
, a site giving the
history of a school dating from the same era as Stratford's. It's at
Nantwich in Cheshire, and its most famous alumnus was Lord Chief
Justice Sir Ranulph Crewe:

'The exact date of its foundation is unknown and is traditionally
accepted as 1560. ...Sir Ranulphe Crewe (or Crew), born in Nantwich in
1558, is said by Miss E. A. Johnson in Johnson's Nantwich and Crewe
Magazine, 1868, to have attended a school in the town. Sir Ranulphe
became the Speaker of the House of Commons 1614-20, was the Attorney
General 1623-24 and was made the Lord Chief Justice in
1624...*Confirmation of his attendance at a school in Nantwich is
difficult to find, although as his father was a tanner in the town it
is doubtful if the boy would be sent away to school.*' (My emphasis)

To me the above account suggests three things:
- Nantwich Grammar School's earliest records have also been lost.
- nevertheless, historians make reasonable inferences from those
documents which have survived.
- with no evidence to the contrary, a local businessman's son is
naturally assumed to have attended the local grammar.

Exactly the same process applies to the school at Stratford. If early
records are lacking, so what? It's hardly surprising. In their
absence though it's for AntiStrats to make some credible case arguing
that the son of a local businessman would *not* have attended his
town's free grammar - because the probability is that he would.

PS: Re Sir Ranulph Crewe. I can see AntiStrats may have trouble
accepting that a man whose early education left no record, and who was
merely the son of a smalltown leatherworker, ended up a significant
historical figure. So if it makes you uneasy just tell yourself there
must have been a secret blueblooded Lord Chief Justice and 'Sir
Ranulph Crewe' was his frontman.

This little poem says that Shakespeare's lines are clear of all
(university or such, I presume) learning, and are proof of how
far a man can go with only the gifts nature gave him -
his natural born talent.

To me, this means his more educated contemporaries realized full
well how little formal education Shakespeare had, but still admired
his talent.

How can anti-Strats use this to prove their case - when it proves
the Strat one?

2000 years before Shake-speare Greek political satires were
written that ridiculed Pericles' *non-aristocratic* successor:
the war-mongering demagogue Cleon.

thE W a S P S [Sphekes] (422 BC) Philonides
thE K n i g H t s (424 BC) Aristophanes
thE A c h A R n i a n s (425 BC) Callistratus

To be honest, Philonides &amp; Callistratus were pseudonym/front men
used by Aristophanes. Unfortunately, he wasn't able to hide behind
a pseudonym in _The Knights_ because Aristophanes, himself,
was forced to play the Cleon character (a scheming Paphlagonian
LEATHER-MONGER) after everyone else refused. (We know
for certain that this character was intended to be Cleon because
Cleon's father Cleaenetus was, in fact, a TANNER.)

_Is Shakespeare Dead_ (1908) by Mark Twain
CHAPTER III

&lt;&lt;For the instruction of the ignorant I will make a list, now, of
those details of Shakespeare's history which are FACTS -
- verified facts, established facts, undisputed facts.

FACTS

He was born on the 23d of April, 1564.

Of good farmer-class parents who could not read, could not write,
could not sign their names.

At Stratford, a small back settlement which in that day was shabby
and unclean, and densely illiterate. Of the nineteen important men
charged with the government of the town, thirteen had to
&quot;make their mark&quot; in attesting important documents,
because they could not write their names.

Of the first eighteen years of his life NOTHING is known.
They are a blank.

On the 27th of November (1582) William Shakespeare
took out a license to marry Anne Whateley.

Next day William Shakespeare took out a license
to marry Anne Hathaway. She was eight years his senior.

William Shakespeare married Anne Hathaway. In a hurry.
By grace of a reluctantly-granted dispensation there was
but one publication of the banns.

Within six months the first child was born.

About two (blank) years followed, during which period NOTHING
AT ALL HAPPENED TO SHAKESPEARE, so far as anybody knows.

Then came twins -- 1585. February.

Two blank years follow.

Then -- 1587 -- he makes a ten-year visit to London,
leaving the family behind.

Five blank years follow. During this period
NOTHING HAPPENED TO HIM, as far as anybody actually knows.

Then -- 1592 -- there is mention of him as an actor.

Next year -- 1593 -- his name appears in the official list of players.

Next year -- 1594 -- he played before the queen. A detail of no
consequence: other obscurities did it every year of the forty-five
of her reign. And remained obscure.

Three pretty full years follow. Full of play-acting. Then

In 1597 he bought New Place, Stratford.

Thirteen or fourteen busy years follow; years in which he
accumulated money, and also reputation as actor and manager.

Meantime his name, liberally and variously spelt, had become
associated with a number of great plays and poems, as (ostensibly)
author of the same. Some of these, in these years and later, were
pirated, but he made no protest.

Then -- 1610-11 -- he returned to Stratford and settled
down for good and all, and busied himself in lending money, trading
in tithes, trading in land and houses; shirking a debt of forty-one
shillings, borrowed by his wife during his long desertion of his
family; suing debtors for shillings and coppers; being sued himself
for shillings and coppers; and acting as confederate to a neighbor
who tried to rob the town of its rights in a certain common, and
did not succeed.

He lived five or six years -- till 1616 -- in the joy
of these elevated pursuits. Then he made a will,
and signed each of its three pages with his name.

A thoroughgoing business man's will. It named in minute detail
every item of property he owned in the world -- houses, lands, sword,
silver-gilt bowl, and so on -- all the way down to his &quot;second-best
bed&quot; and its furniture.

It carefully and calculatingly distributed his riches among the
members of his family, overlooking no individual of it. Not even
his wife: the wife he had been enabled to marry in a hurry by
urgent grace of a special dispensation before he was nineteen; the
wife whom he had left husbandless so many years; the wife who had
had to borrow forty-one shillings in her need, and which the lender
was never able to collect of the prosperous husband,
but died at last with the money still lacking.

No, even this wife was remembered in Shakespeare's will.

He left her that &quot;second-best bed.&quot;

And NOT ANOTHER THING;
not even a penny to bless her lucky widowhood with.

It was eminently and conspicuously a business man's will,
not a poet's.

It mentioned NOT A SINGLE BOOK.

Books were much more precious than swords and silver-gilt bowls and
second-best beds in those days, and when a departing person owned
one he gave it a high place in his will.

The will mentioned NOT A PLAY, NOT A POEM, NOT AN UNFINISHED
LITERARY WORK, NOT A SCRAP OF MANUSCRIPT OF ANY KIND.

Many poets have died poor, but this is the only one in history that
has died THIS poor; the others all left literary remains behind.
Also a book. Maybe two.

If Shakespeare had owned a dog -- but we need not go into that: we
know he would have mentioned it in his will. If a good dog,
Susanna would have got it; if an inferior one his wife would have
got a dower interest in it. I wish he had had a dog, just so we
could see how painstakingly he would have divided that dog among
the family, in his careful business way.

He signed the will in three places.
In earlier years he signed two other official documents.
These five signatures still exist.
There are NO OTHER SPECIMENS OF HIS PENMANSHIP IN EXISTENCE.
Not a line.
Was he prejudiced against the art? His granddaughter, whom he
loved, was eight years old when he died, yet she had had no
teaching, he left no provision for her education although he was
rich, and in her mature womanhood she couldn't write and couldn't
tell her husband's manuscript from anybody else's -
- she thought it was Shakespeare's.

When Shakespeare died in Stratford IT WAS NOT AN EVENT. It made no
more stir in England than the death of any other forgotten theatre-
actor would have made. Nobody came down from London; there were no
lamenting poems, no eulogies, no national tears -- there was merely
silence, and nothing more. A striking contrast with what happened
when Ben Jonson, and Francis Bacon, and Spenser, and Raleigh and
the other distinguished literary folk of Shakespeare's time passed
from life! No praiseful voice was lifted for the lost Bard of
Avon; even Ben Jonson waited seven years before he lifted his.

SO FAR AS ANYBODY ACTUALLY KNOWS AND CAN PROVE, Shakespeare
of Stratford-on-Avon never wrote a play in his life.

SO FAR AS ANYBODY KNOWS AND CAN PROVE,
he never wrote a letter to anybody in his life.

SO FAR AS ANY ONE KNOWS,
HE RECEIVED ONLY ONE LETTER DURING HIS LIFE.

So far as any one KNOWS AND CAN PROVE, Shakespeare of Stratford
wrote only one poem during his life. This one is authentic. He
did write that one -- a fact which stands undisputed; he wrote
the whole of it; he wrote the whole of it out of his own head.
He commanded that this work of art be engraved upon his tomb,
and he was obeyed. There it abides to this day. This is it:

Good friend for Iesus sake forbeare
To digg the dust encloased heare:
Blest be ye man yt spares thes stones
And curst be he yt moves my bones.

In the list as above set down, will be found EVERY POSITIVELY KNOWN
fact of Shakespeare's life, lean and meagre as the invoice is.

Beyond these details we know NOT A THING about him. All the rest
of his vast history, as furnished by the biographers, is built up,
course upon course, of guesses, inferences, theories, conjectures --
an Eiffel Tower of artificialities rising sky-high from a very flat
and very thin foundation of inconsequential facts.

This is not a fact either. It seems probable that Shakespeare's
father could not write, but as Dave Kathman and others have pointed out
many times, in the Elizabethan period people who could read could not
necessarily write. Why are most anti-Stratfordians so incorrigibly

There is not the slightest reason to believe that Shakespeare
composed the tombstone doggerel, and VERy good reason to believe that,
on the contrary, it was a relatively formulaic commonplace. All this
has been explained here many times before. Why are most

'an illiterate butcher's son' - not sure if you mean the son of an
illiterate butcher, or the illiterate son of a butcher? But as far as
I know, no-one claims the man who signed the Shakespeare will was
illiterate so I'll take your meaning as the former.

OK - you're still wrong. Like Sir Ranulph Crewe, Shakespeare belonged
to the generation that benefited from the foundation of grammar
schools. Free schooling probably wasn't available to his father, who
anyway came from a smaller place and migrated to Stratford. (I only
say 'probably' because I don't know whether the church had previously
provided any schooling in the Snitterfield area.)

I'm an example of a similar process. My family were poor Irish
immigrants and I was the first to attend university. This wasn't
because my parents and grandparents were more stupid than I am. Their
failure to equal my educational attainment is no reflection either on
their intelligence or ambitions (they had both). What it demonstrates
is major changes in the availability of university places, and
funding, from mid-19th c, which made university possible for me and
many others of my generation.

Similarly, when free grammar schooling became available to Stratford
boys it's practically a dead cert that the son of a Town Bailiff would
benefit: whereas his daughters would usually be ineligible on gender
grounds.

No, it's for AntiStrats to suggest some likely reason why young
William would not have attended. Lack of intelligence or ability I
think can be ruled out because in later life he significantly
increased the family's standing and wealth.

But they DO say. After the obligatory acknowledgement that no record

That's an interesting point on several levels. If Shakspere was such a

Considering the ubiquity and redundancy of document-generation in our

Roundtable, on Shakspere's [schooling]:

&lt;snip&gt;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt; So, if there ARE existing lists of students, and Will is nowhere
&gt;&gt;&gt; on them, it is equally possible he did - or did not - go to school
&gt;&gt;&gt; in Stratford - because unless the lists are absolutely complete,
&gt;&gt;&gt; the absence of his name means nothing.

"/>

Petzold:

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; I can assure you that if such a list or lists were known to exist and

&gt;&gt; generous.

&gt;&gt;&gt; If there are NO surviving lists, it is likewise possible that he
&gt;&gt;&gt; did - or did not - go to school in Stratford.

&gt;&gt; There are no such lists; therefore, Shakspere's attendance cannot be
&gt;&gt; affirmatively maintained; therefore, his formal education in Stratford
&gt;&gt; cannot reasonably be posited.
&gt;&lt;snip&gt;

"/>

Rita:

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I think you're wrong. It's more reasonable to posit that the son of a
&gt; local businessman attended his town's grammar school than that he did
&gt; not.

"/>

Actually, I think you're right. It's not unreasonable to posit it;
rather, it is impermissible. Since we cannot know (as the records are
gone) whether other boys of Shakspere's time and circumstances were
kept out of school or allowed to go only so often or were there all
the time, it is not possible (although it may seem reasonable) to
compare his situation to anyone else's. Was school attendance
mandatory? Did fathers rely on first-born sons to carry on with their
own trades, disdaining the importance of school in favor of learning
that trade at home where the extra help could mean extra income?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I back this up with the following, taken from
&gt; http://www.malbank.schoolzone.co.uk/history.htm , a site giving the
&gt; history of a school dating from the same era as Stratford's. It's at
&gt; Nantwich in Cheshire, and its most famous alumnus was Lord Chief
&gt; Justice Sir Ranulph Crewe:

&gt; 'The exact date of its foundation is unknown and is traditionally
&gt; accepted as 1560. ...Sir Ranulphe Crewe (or Crew), born in Nantwich in
&gt; 1558, is said by Miss E. A. Johnson in Johnson's Nantwich and Crewe
&gt; Magazine, 1868, to have attended a school in the town.

"/>

This is non-CPLE, right?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Sir Ranulphe
&gt; became the Speaker of the House of Commons 1614-20, was the Attorney
&gt; General 1623-24 and was made the Lord Chief Justice in
&gt; 1624...

"/>

I confess I am utterly ignorant of Sir Ranulphe's life or career.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; *Confirmation of his attendance at a school in Nantwich is
&gt; difficult to find, although as his father was a tanner in the town it
&gt; is doubtful if the boy would be sent away to school.*' (My emphasis)

"/>

&quot;Difficult to find&quot;? Okay, so there's no record of Sir Ranulphe's
early school days.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; To me the above account suggests three things:
&gt; - Nantwich Grammar School's earliest records have also been lost.

"/>

Yes.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; - nevertheless, historians make reasonable inferences from those
&gt; documents which have survived.

"/>

If we were to investigate Sir Ranulphe's early life, we would still
require some evidence that he actually attended the school at
Nantwich. This is no better (and, in some obvious ways, highly
reminscient of) the belief that Shakspere attended the King's School
in Stratford. Did our famous jurist or any of his friends, family, or
neighbors ever reflect in writing on his attendance at that school? If
so, I would be inclined to believe in it completely, even if the
rosters are missing. But, who put pen to paper in Shakspere's behalf?
Did any of his putative schoolmasters or classmates sing his praises?
He was, after all, a servant to the Queen and King for 20 years! Why
did that news never make its way back home?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; - with no evidence to the contrary, a local businessman's son is
&gt; naturally assumed to have attended the local grammar.

"/>

So, the default setting is that Sir Ranulphe and Shakspere attended
their respective schools, even though it's entirely possible that they
could have stayed home and learned their fathers' trades. There's
probably not the same degree of doubt about Sir Ranulphe's
intellectual development as there is of Shakspere's, but that's
probably because Sir Ranulphe's evolution bears the telltale marks of
a great jurist, whereas Shakspere's is a demonstration of
counterintuition.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Exactly the same process applies to the school at Stratford.

"/>

And that's a mitigation?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; If early
&gt; records are lacking, so what? It's hardly surprising.

"/>

Sure. It's only history.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; In their
&gt; absence though it's for AntiStrats to make some credible case arguing
&gt; that the son of a local businessman would *not* have attended his
&gt; town's free grammar - because the probability is that he would.

"/>

We cannot know individual circumstances so completely that we should
assert the fact of these boys' attendance without some hesitation and
qualification.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Rita

&gt; PS: Re Sir Ranulph Crewe. I can see AntiStrats may have trouble
&gt; accepting that a man whose early education left no record, and who was
&gt; merely the son of a smalltown leatherworker, ended up a significant
&gt; historical figure. So if it makes you uneasy just tell yourself there
&gt; must have been a secret blueblooded Lord Chief Justice and 'Sir
&gt; Ranulph Crewe' was his frontman.

"/>

Nice. We'll have to learn more about this Sir Ranulphe.

Toby, your problem with respect to Shakespeare's formal education is this:
you must demonstrate beyond reasonable doubt that he had none. Otherwise,
because of the hard evidence that he was literate and wrote plays, you
have NOTHING to put against our assigning the Shakespearean plays to him. We
do not have to show that he did have a formal education, only that there is no
reason to believe he did not.

If we find a murdered man, then a second man with a gun that can be shown to
have killed the victim, the latter's lawyer can not get him off with the claim
that there is no proof the victim was ever instructed in how to fire a gun--so
long as the prosecution can show that there is no reason to believe he could not
have learned to do this. The defense lawyer must establish that he definitely
could NOT have learned how to fire a gun.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Note: &quot;Stratfordians&quot; do not claim instructors for Shakespeare in order to

"/>

The accusation stands.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt; All three had completed studies at the University of Oxford.
&gt;&gt;&gt; In Stratford they received 20 pounds annual pay, and free
&gt;&gt;&gt; lodgings, which was twice as high as same position in Warwick.

&gt;&gt;I'm not sure if the amount was the same for all, but they had to pay
&gt;&gt;for a bouncer out of their own cut, plus other essential incidentals
&gt;&gt;(how times haven't changed that one!)

&gt;&gt;&gt; Are there similar lists of the STUDENTS in Stratford at that time?

&gt;&gt;No.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I recall reading that those documents were destroyed in a fire or
&gt;&gt;&gt; something.

&gt;&gt;I've never heard of the reason why they don't exist. Maybe Willmot
&gt;&gt;burned them when he saw that Shakspere's name was missing.

&gt; Sure, wack. And then he went to the majority of other towns outside London and
&gt; destroyed their lists, too, so the absence of the Stratford list would not seem
&gt; odd.

"/>

PLEASE get a sense of humor.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; Actually, &quot;Stratfordianism&quot; would not have been hobbled. The belief that

Ha, ha. Priceless.

&gt;&gt;cannot reasonably be posited. Now, Stratfordianism has erected a giant
&gt;&gt;edifice of rationalization (easily found in any standard biography)
&gt;&gt;that piles conjecture on conjecture with the bricks of a priori
&gt;&gt;assumptions and the mortar of scholarly authority, but that's all done
&gt;&gt;just to move you on to the next anecdote or guess. &quot;Of course the
&gt;&gt;young lad went to the King's School! He's SHAKESPEARE! Where else
&gt;&gt;would he have learned to read?&quot;

&gt; No, wack. Sahkespeare is said to have gone to the Stratford grammar school
&gt; because it makes sense that he would have.

Right.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; He need not have gone there or to
&gt; any school to have learned to read.

Okay. He was home-schooled.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; All that counts is that he indeed did learn
&gt; to read--as the hard evidence establishes beyond reasonable doubt.

At least you didn't claim that that's where he learned to write.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt; For the bright, curious and creative person, a lack of long years
&gt;&gt;&gt; of formal school education followed by a degree does not necessarily

&gt;&gt;&gt; Francoise Sagan and Lawrence Durrell both failed their Uni entrance
&gt;&gt;&gt; exams, but went on to succeed as authors.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Lawrence's brother Gerald had no formal school education at all,
&gt;&gt;&gt; but became a pioneer animal conservationist and very popular author.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Truman Capote said of himself:
&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;I learned to read at a pre-school age. My education has been rather
&gt;&gt;&gt; do-it-yourself. To this day I cannot recite the alphabet or the
&gt;&gt;&gt; multiplication tables. I had already started writing short stories
&gt;&gt;&gt; when I was 14, and some of them were published.
&gt;&gt;&gt; I left school when I was 15.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt; Just to mention a few.

&gt;&gt;Truman Capote? As a comparitor to Shakspere's presumed autodidactism?
&gt;&gt;Well, it just makes so much sniffling of my doubts.

&gt;&gt;Toby Petzold

&gt; The conclusion is inescapable to all but those like you, Toby, who are incapable
&gt; of learning on their own: it is quite possible for a bright fellow
&gt; with an innate facility with words to learn to read and write on his own and

It's been fairly well conceded that Judith was illiterate to the bone,
and Susanna &quot;likely&quot; the same, although she could sign her name, much
labored in the doing of it, such as her father. It was said that
Susanna was &quot;witty&quot; but that's hardly the same as saying that someone
could write, I'm sure that's understood. No doubt there were witty
people before the alphabet existed.

You who are fathers will be perplexed about this, for if you were
Shakespeare and had great monies and influence, would it not be a
generous thing to get a tutor for your daughters?

But something else of the literacy of Stratford. Alexander Aspinal was
the Man of the School in Stratford up until 1622, some 30 years on the
job. But did he ever say anything about Shakespeare? Certainly when
Shakespeare retired to Stratford maybe around 1610 or so, he would
have been in conversation with the leading scholar of the town, this
Aspinal.

But did Aspinal ever say anything about the man, or note his death in
any way whatsoever, such as a great poet died here. Or whatever you
choose, but there is nothing said by Dr. Hall or the leading (I
suppose) scholar in Stratford. If not, why not? Once again we come up
against that Gibralter of a block in the way of making the man from
Stratford the poet. No one at the time seems to have known about it.

Take a good look at those 'signatures'. Are they

The balance of the evidence IMO is on the side
of illiteracy.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; OK - you're still wrong. Like Sir Ranulph Crewe, Shakespeare belonged
&gt; to the generation that benefited from the foundation of grammar
&gt; schools.

"/>

Your logic based on Sir Ranulph Crewe is
poor. Clearly someone who makes a great
success of a professional career almost
certainly attended, and did well at, school.
The nature of the Stratman's 'career' is the
issue.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Free schooling probably wasn't available to his father, who
&gt; anyway came from a smaller place and migrated to Stratford. (I only
&gt; say 'probably' because I don't know whether the church had previously
&gt; provided any schooling in the Snitterfield area.)

"/>

It didn't -- as far as anyone knows, and it
would be most unlikely in such small,
remote place.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Similarly, when free grammar schooling became available to Stratford
&gt; boys it's practically a dead cert that the son of a Town Bailiff would
&gt; benefit:

"/>

Far from it. He'd long since ceased to be
town bailiff, which was no big deal in any
case. Do you know who is on your local
parish council? Allowing for a fairly large
agricultural population in the area, there
was probably about one place in the school
for every ten boys who could reasonably get
there. Only those who were ambitious for
their sons would send them there. That
would probably cover all those who had any
kind of tradition of literacy in their family -- the
father, mother, uncles, etc. There is nothing
like that for the Stratman, as far as we know.

Then the eldest son might be expected to
inherit the business, which did not need
literacy. It would have been a skill for
second and subsequent sons, who would
be likely to have to forge a life in London.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; No, it's for AntiStrats to suggest some likely reason why young
&gt; William would not have attended. Lack of intelligence or ability I
&gt; think can be ruled out because in later life he significantly
&gt; increased the family's standing and wealth.

"/>

Ability at making money in business has
_very_ little to do with literacy. If anything,
it's probably contra-indicative.

(It's certainly highly contra-indicative of the
least interest in literature.)

&gt; that trade at home where the extra help could mean extra income?

"/>

Did the property-owning citizens of Stratford provide an expensive
schoolteacher and premises to run a school in :
- so that it could stand empty?
- so that rich gentlemen's sons could benefit?
- so that the sons of the labouring poor could benefit?
- so that their own sons could benefit?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; I back this up with the following, taken from
&gt;&gt; http://www.malbank.schoolzone.co.uk/history.htm , a site giving the
&gt;&gt; history of a school dating from the same era as Stratford's. It's at
&gt;&gt; Nantwich in Cheshire, and its most famous alumnus was Lord Chief
&gt;&gt; Justice Sir Ranulph Crewe:

&gt;&gt; 'The exact date of its foundation is unknown and is traditionally
&gt;&gt; accepted as 1560. ...Sir Ranulphe Crewe (or Crew), born in Nantwich in
&gt;&gt; 1558, is said by Miss E. A. Johnson in Johnson's Nantwich and Crewe
&gt;&gt; Magazine, 1868, to have attended a school in the town.

&gt; This is non-CPLE, right?

"/>

This is showing how, in the absence of documentary evidence,
historians naturally conclude that in an Elizabethan town where a
grammar school was available, the sons of local businessmen attended.
Nevermind Shakespeare and Stratford, even if it's just Ranulph Crewe
and Nantwich, historians do this. 'Town grammar school + literate boy
= boy most probably educated at town grammar school' It's a
reasonable supposition. The alternative is to propose that throughout
Elizabethan England people were founding town grammar schools so that
nobody would go.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; Sir Ranulphe
&gt;&gt; became the Speaker of the House of Commons 1614-20, was the Attorney
&gt;&gt; General 1623-24 and was made the Lord Chief Justice in
&gt;&gt; 1624...

&gt; I confess I am utterly ignorant of Sir Ranulphe's life or career.

"/>

Shame on you. His stand on the matter of ship money is still spoken
of today.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; *Confirmation of his attendance at a school in Nantwich is
&gt;&gt; difficult to find, although as his father was a tanner in the town it
&gt;&gt; is doubtful if the boy would be sent away to school.*' (My emphasis)

&gt;&quot;Difficult to find&quot;? Okay, so there's no record of Sir Ranulphe's
&gt; early school days.

"/>

Toby, there's *no record of the early schooldays of any of the boys
who attended Nantwich Grammar in its first few years* - any more than
there is a record of the early attenders at Stratford. There's
nothing fishy about that. Records get lost over the centuries. Fire,
flood, mice, sloppy admin. And the Luftwaffe. They saw off a lot of
Exeter wills, to my certain knowledge.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; To me the above account suggests three things:
&gt;&gt; - Nantwich Grammar School's earliest records have also been lost.

&gt; Yes.

&gt;&gt; - nevertheless, historians make reasonable inferences from those
&gt;&gt; documents which have survived.

&gt; If we were to investigate Sir Ranulphe's early life, we would still
&gt; require some evidence that he actually attended the school at
&gt; Nantwich.

"/>

You can require till you're blue in the face, Toby - all evidence of
his early education has gone. In its absence, what is the reasonable
assumption to make? Assume that, though Ranulph Crewe grew up in a
town with a grammar school, and became educated, he probably had no
connection with the one place we know education was available to him?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; This is no better (and, in some obvious ways, highly
&gt; reminscient of) the belief that Shakspere attended the King's School
&gt; in Stratford.

"/>

True. Oh, true. In the absence of surviving historical records, we
can only make a reasonable assumption.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Did our famous jurist or any of his friends, family, or
&gt; neighbors ever reflect in writing on his attendance at that school? If
&gt; so, I would be inclined to believe in it completely, even if the
&gt; rosters are missing.

"/>

You mean unless there are allusions to Ranulph's education in some
surviving record, you think it fair to assume he never had any? No
that would be absurd, because later evidence of literacy exists,
indicating that at some time he must have learned to read and write.
Okay, Toby: you know there was a school available for him to attend in
the town where he was born, and you know that he was literate. Do you
think it an entirely reckless guess that he learned to read and write
at that school? If so, would you like to furnish us with a more
probable explanation of how he came to be literate - since you know he
was? Did his father the tanner hire a private tutor? Did the angels
teach him?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; But, who put pen to paper in Shakspere's behalf?

"/>

Who put pen to paper on Sir Ranulph's? No-one. You have to face the
fact that this all happened four hundred years ago and a lot of the
documentary evidence from the period has been lost - if it was ever
set down in the first place. There are no accurate daily weather
records surviving from the time, either. Would you like us to believe
than in the absence of surviving records, no weather happened?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Did any of his putative schoolmasters or classmates sing his praises?
&gt; He was, after all, a servant to the Queen and King for 20 years! Why
&gt; did that news never make its way back home?

"/>

I think there was mention of his later successful literary career on
his monument. Why do no letters survive from fellow citizens
expressing gobsmacked astonishment that an illiterate grain dealer has
been honoured with a bizarre epitaph praising him for feats he never
achieved? You have such faith in the completeness of the historical
record. I leave it to you to explain that one.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; - with no evidence to the contrary, a local businessman's son is
&gt;&gt; naturally assumed to have attended the local grammar.

&gt; So, the default setting is that Sir Ranulphe and Shakspere attended
&gt; their respective schools, even though it's entirely possible that they
&gt; could have stayed home and learned their fathers' trades.

"/>

God yes I forgot, it said that in the DNB - 'Sir Ranulph Crewe, Lord
Chief Justice, Speaker of the House of Commons and Purveyor of
Cowhides to the Gentry'.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; There's
&gt; probably not the same degree of doubt about Sir Ranulphe's
&gt; intellectual development as there is of Shakspere's, but that's
&gt; probably because Sir Ranulphe's evolution bears the telltale marks of
&gt; a great jurist, whereas Shakspere's is a demonstration of
&gt; counterintuition.

"/>

Of course there is no doubt that Sir Ranulph Crewe was literate,
because his subsequent career is adequate proof. As for William
Shakespeare of Stratford - even if you refuse to connect him with the
published poet of the same name, you have to explain how he became
wealthy enough to buy New Place, carry through his father's
application for arms and leave his daughters very comfortably off,
outdoing his neighbour Quiney (whom we know was literate) and lastly
sign his own will - all this, according to you, while labouring under
the handicap of zero schooling. Having spurned the education
available to him, free, in his youth.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Exactly the same process applies to the school at Stratford.

&gt; And that's a mitigation?

&gt;&gt; If early
&gt;&gt; records are lacking, so what? It's hardly surprising.

&gt; Sure. It's only history.

"/>

And history is completely documented, as we all know, since records
were always fully kept and never neglected, damaged or lost. That's
why every parish church in England has a complete record of baptisms,
marriage and burials right down from Elizabethan times till now. And
that's why the early history of Nantwich Grammar is known in minutest
detail, right down to the report card of Sir Ranulph Crewe.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; In their
&gt;&gt; absence though it's for AntiStrats to make some credible case arguing
&gt;&gt; that the son of a local businessman would *not* have attended his
&gt;&gt; town's free grammar - because the probability is that he would.

&gt; We cannot know individual circumstances so completely that we should
&gt; assert the fact of these boys' attendance without some hesitation and
&gt; qualification.

No, but we're talking probabilities. If I said that in 2001 I

There _was_ an almost perfect mechanical _correctness_--and there was

too well for _that;_ but there was just enough irregularity of _time_ to
betray that the player had no real “ear” for music--just enough
inarticulateness in the more elaborate passages to show that she did not
think her audience worth taking real pains for--just enough mechanical
monotony of accent to take all _soul_ out of the heavenly modulations
she was profaning--in short, it was simply irritating; and, when she had
rattled off the finale and had struck the final chord as if, the
instrument being now done with, it didn’t matter how many wires she
broke, I could not even _affect_ to join in the stereotyped “Oh, _thank_
you!” which was chorused around me.

They aren't 'signatures', Paul, they're just signatures. Putting the

AntiStrats insist John Shakespeare was illiterate because on the few
surviving records he made his mark rather than signed his name. But
when his son disobligingly signs his will three times, you try to
suggest that his signatures are somehow not 'the work of a literate
person', and your reason is - because you 'don't think so'. Well, I

we any further forward?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; OK - you're still wrong. Like Sir Ranulph Crewe, Shakespeare belonged
&gt;&gt; to the generation that benefited from the foundation of grammar
&gt;&gt; schools.

&gt; Your logic based on Sir Ranulph Crewe is
&gt; poor. Clearly someone who makes a great
&gt; success of a professional career almost
&gt; certainly attended, and did well at, school.

"/>

Actually, Sir Ran's later success wasn't the point at issue. This all
kicked off with Toby objecting that, in the absence of actual
attendance records, it was pure wishful thinking,or else Stratfordian
bias, to assume Shakespeare would have gone to his local free Grammar.
But Shakespeare was the son of a local tradesman and, as the Nantwich
website makes clear, without evidence to the contrary historians
normally suppose that the sons of Elizabethan tradesmen attended their
local free grammar. Stratfordian bias doesn't enter into it.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; The nature of the Stratman's 'career' is the
&gt; issue.

"/>

No, the issue is: was there a free school at Stratford? Yes. Then
what's the historical probability the son of a prosperous tradesman
and local councillor would have attended such a school? Very high.

&lt;snip&gt;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; Similarly, when free grammar schooling became available to Stratford
&gt;&gt; boys it's practically a dead cert that the son of a Town Bailiff would
&gt;&gt; benefit:

&gt; Far from it. He'd long since ceased to be
&gt; town bailiff, which was no big deal in any
&gt; case.

"/>

Whaat?? What higher office than town bailiff and Justice of the Peace
could an ordinary Stratford citizen hope to attain? It was the most
prominent position in the community achievable by merit rather than
accident of birth. And since one would expect William to have started
Grammar school c.1571, his father's career on the council still had
six more glorious years to run.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Do you know who is on your local
&gt; parish council?

"/>

Local parish council!!! Paul, you gamble on our ignorance by
suggesting an Elizabethan town bailiff was somehow no more important
than a parish councillor in the early 21st century. But it's a
grotesque comparison. A modern parish councillor has few real powers
and very little impact on the lives of the local citizens. The
Borough Councillors of Stratford were a real force in their community
and their status was correspondingly high. John Shakespeare was
elected to the Common Council in 1557, Constable in 1558, Afeeror in
1559 and Chamberlain by 1562. And he was Chamberlain for four years,
keeping the Borough accounts and doling out relief in times of need.
(I've been on a town council myself, Paul, and IMO the person to keep
in with isn't the Mayor but the Chairman of the Finance Committee.)
When he was ultimately made bailiff in 1568 it was the crowning
success of a man who had obviously favourably impressed the community
he served. It was no negligible achievement. Shakespeare would have
been four. I bet he thought his daddy was God.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Allowing for a fairly large
&gt; agricultural population in the area, there
&gt; was probably about one place in the school
&gt; for every ten boys who could reasonably get

Grammar schools were there to teach boys Latin, not to teach them
their letters. They'd be expected to be basically literate by the
time they arrived. If their fathers hadn't paid for petty schooling,
I can't see the boys getting in. (It's a nice thought, mind, this
idea of Stratford Free Grammar besieged by hordes of hopeful
ploughboys...)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Only those who were ambitious for
&gt; their sons would send them there.

Good point! Now, would you suppose a man who left a village for a
town, worked his way up to commercial success and property-ownership,
gained public office and at last became Town Bailiff, was 'ambitious'?
The man who began life as the son of a tenant farmer and by the 1570s
was applying for a grant of arms - was he 'ambitious'? I'd call him
ambitious. I'd even call him strikingly ambitious. And would you think
an ambitious Elizabethan would invest any hopes in his eldest son?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; That
&gt; would probably cover all those who had any
&gt; kind of tradition of literacy in their family -- the
&gt; father, mother, uncles, etc.

I and my family are living proof this whole argument is flapdoodle.
Within three generations we passed from illiteracy to university
degree. Illiteracy isn't in the genes, Paul. You, me and Seamus
Heaney - we all descend from a very long line of illiterates.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; There is nothing
&gt; like that for the Stratman, as far as we know.

"/>

See above. Your argument is silly. It's based on illiteracy being
passed down like eye-colour. John Shakespeare was an ambitious man -
demonstrably so - and so one would naturally expect him to promote the
best chances of his son and heir. By this period that would inevitably
mean ensuring the boy was literate.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Then the eldest son might be expected to
&gt; inherit the business, which did not need
&gt; literacy.

"/>

John Shakespeare's friend Adrian Quiney was only a mercer, but he
ensured his son Richard was literate - as we know, since his letter to
Shakespeare survived. Any ambitious Elizabethan who wanted his
business to thrive would surely want a literate heir. In fact I'd say
that concern to get the best possible education for a future heir was
common to all levels of society. (It's fine by me if you disagree -
just give me examples of all those men who deliberately chose to
deprive their heirs of literacy.)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; It would have been a skill for
&gt; second and subsequent sons, who would
&gt; be likely to have to forge a life in London.

"/>

I would say, at all social levels, it was the eldest son who got first
bite at any available cherry. See Hall's satire on the countryman
Lolio, who 'drudges all he can / To make his eldest sonne a
Gentleman'. It's only when Number One Son successfully makes it to
the Inns of Court that Lolio allows his second boy Hodge his chance:

'Nay then his Hodge shall leaue the plough &amp; waine,
And buy a booke, and go to schoole againe:
Why mought not he, as well as others done,
Rise from his Festue to his Littleton?'

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; No, it's for AntiStrats to suggest some likely reason why young
&gt;&gt; William would not have attended. Lack of intelligence or ability I
&gt;&gt; think can be ruled out because in later life he significantly
&gt;&gt; increased the family's standing and wealth.

&gt; Ability at making money in business has
&gt; _very_ little to do with literacy. If anything,
&gt; it's probably contra-indicative.

You mean most successful business men are illiterate? No, that's
obviously untrue. You must mean something like 'businessmen have no
Soul'.

No one doubts that SOME sons of Elizabethan
tradesmen attended their local free grammar.
It's highly likely, for example, that Richard Field
attended the school, or he would hardly have
managed to become a printer in London. The
question is _what_proportion_ of them did so.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; The nature of the Stratman's 'career' is the
&gt;&gt; issue.

&gt; No, the issue is: was there a free school at Stratford? Yes. Then
&gt; what's the historical probability the son of a prosperous tradesman
&gt; and local councillor would have attended such a school? Very high.

"/>

But he was FAR from prosperous. He was being
chased for money from _at_least_ 1574, the time
when his son would have been about half-way
through his years at school (from 7 to 13).

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Whaat?? What higher office than town bailiff and Justice of the Peace
&gt; could an ordinary Stratford citizen hope to attain? It was the most
&gt; prominent position in the community achievable by merit rather than
&gt; accident of birth. And since one would expect William to have started
&gt; Grammar school c.1571, his father's career on the council still had
&gt; six more glorious years to run.

"/>

Glorious? In a town of 2200 souls? Reduce
that to the numbers of adult males; take out
those who were old or sick, or (surprising as
it may seem) not interested, and how many
do you have left?

John got the office in 1568. He was not re-
appointed to it again, whereas that would have
been normal for successful officers. He had
apparently virtually stopped attending council
meetings from 1576.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Do you know who is on your local
&gt;&gt; parish council?

&gt; Local parish council!!! Paul, you gamble on our ignorance by
&gt; suggesting an Elizabethan town bailiff was somehow no more important
&gt; than a parish councillor in the early 21st century. But it's a
&gt; grotesque comparison. A modern parish councillor has few real powers
&gt; and very little impact on the lives of the local citizens. The
&gt; Borough Councillors of Stratford were a real force in their community
&gt; and their status was correspondingly high. John Shakespeare was
&gt; elected to the Common Council in 1557, Constable in 1558, Afeeror in
&gt; 1559 and Chamberlain by 1562. And he was Chamberlain for four years,
&gt; keeping the Borough accounts and doling out relief in times of need.
&gt; (I've been on a town council myself, Paul, and IMO the person to keep
&gt; in with isn't the Mayor but the Chairman of the Finance Committee.)
&gt; When he was ultimately made bailiff in 1568 it was the crowning
&gt; success of a man who had obviously favourably impressed the community
&gt; he served. It was no negligible achievement. Shakespeare would have
&gt; been four. I bet he thought his daddy was God.

"/>

If he started writing the canon when he was
4, fair enough (in Stratfordia, anything is
possible -- there is no need whatever to
connect to reality). But that was Daddy's high
point. From there on it was a decline . . . and
a rapid one.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Allowing for a fairly large
&gt;&gt; agricultural population in the area, there
&gt;&gt; was probably about one place in the school
&gt;&gt; for every ten boys who could reasonably get
&gt;&gt; there.

&gt; Grammar schools were there to teach boys Latin, not to teach them
&gt; their letters.

"/>

Err . . there's the 'mission statement . . ' and
what actually happens -- not always exactly the
same. Remember that NONE of the boys walking
to the school &quot;with the Stratman&quot; would have had
dads (let alone mums) who had attended any kind
of school before. It was a new, strange, and not-
well-understood institution, that taught village
boys mysterious things -- of a quite uncertain
value in the real world.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; They'd be expected to be basically literate by the

This is wishful thinking, based on zero evidence.
Do you think that they teacher could pick and
choose from the local 'talent'? He'd have had
to bully many of the parents (with whatever
means he had) to try to get a class. We are in
the illiterate boondocks remember? No one
sees much point in any of this. There's nothing
for them to read, even if they manage to learn.
Book-purchasing is something that only rich
nobility and top gentry do, or can afford to do.
Reading the Bible (or the 'wrong' kinds of texts)
can get you into serious trouble, as all who were,
say, aged 10 in 1558 will know (i.e. everyone 16
years older than the Stratman). No one knows
what will be regarded as 'wrong' next month or
next year.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

I'm not denying it. But do you recall your

and uni-degree rates changed drastically

became compulsory. Whereas literacy
rates improved _after_ schools were set
up in most U.K. towns from 1550 onwards,

We have two avenues open to us to decide your question.

I don't imagine the target population included the whole of local
society. Mostly it would be sons of families above a basic economic
level that would benefit from free grammar, because the bulk of the
labouring poor couldn't afford to pass up on the earnings of their
children. But substantial townsmen of the class to which Field,
Quiney and John Shakespeare belonged are clearly not the labouring
poor. The advantages of having literate heirs obviously struck Field
and Quiney. Why do you persist in believing John Shakespeare would be
odd man out? And I must say your reluctance to accept that the
numerous grammar schools founded in English provincial towns during
the mid-16th century actually taught anyone at all, is curious.

Why would he need to bully anyone for a class? He wasn't paid by the
head - his annual pay was fixed. And how can I remember what
obviously isn't true? Stratford was no more the 'illiterate

Justice. My god, even fishy little Lowestoft had its own school
(Annot's Free Grammar), and the inventory of a local shop shows it
carried a stock of Latin books - schoolboys for the use of. Lowestoft
was of course smaller than Stratford (c. 1500 people in the 1590s).

There's no record John hit real problems prior to 1577, when he

grown up thinking highly of the old man. And the decline was
certainly sharp, since John mortgaged land in 1579. But it never
became catastrophic. That goodly house in Henley Street survived to
be passed on to his heir...who didn't really need it by then, having
done very nicely for himself.

You are shamelessly misrepresenting facts. Mary the 'local heiress'?
Well yes, her father was a well-connected wealthy farmer, but
unfortunately she was his eighth daughter. She got sixty acres at
Asbies and six pounds. The significant part of her inheritance was
the land. John - according to you a bibulous spendthrift - didn't
touch it till over twenty years after they married; and then he didn't
sell, but only mortgaged. They lost it eventually, but not without a
real fight. This is simply not spendthrift behaviour.

her second husband.&quot; Charing Cross stood just north of the royal
city of Westminster and a mile west of the walled city of London.
The village of Charing did not have a substantial &quot;middle&quot; class
of artisans and merchants: this part of the urban population lived,
by and large, within the city walls. It was rather a residential area
containing both the town houses of the courtiers who attended the
Queen at Westminster and a sizeable contingent of the urban poor,
who dwelt in the alleyways behind the mansions that fronted on the
Strand. The occupants of Hartshorn Lane, which ran from the Strand
down to the Thames, included a bricklayer named Robert Brett among
their number and if, as seems likely, he was Jonson's stepfather, the
boy escaped the plight of the very poor. Brett was a reasonably
prosperous artisan who helped pay for renovations at the parish
church at St. Martin in the Fields in the mid-1590's, and was Master
of the Tilers' and Bricklayers' Company at the time of his death in
1609. The sewage ditch that ran along the premises of Brett's
cottage seems to have been the distinctive feature of the neighborhood
where he and his family resided. During Jonson's lifetime, Hartshorn
Lane would become one of the major sewage canals in the greater
London area. Nevertheless, Jonson's stepfather managed to transform
this liability into an asset: a lease granted in 1586 mentions &quot;the
little garden lately made over the sewer by Roberte Brette.&quot;
Jonson was surrounded, then, by extremes of poverty and wealth
from the earliest years of his life. The walk from Hartshorn Lane to
the parish school at which he began his education ran through the
lower part of St. Martin's Lane, where he traversed the &quot;Bermudas,&quot;
a maze of alleyways that had been turned into the urban equivalent
of the Bermuda straits by the pimps, whores, gamesters, and
&quot;roaring boys&quot; who accosted unwary passers-by; past the Royal
Mews, which had served as the monarchy stables and tilting yard
since the time of Henry VIII; and on into the fashionable church
of St. Martin in the Fields.&quot; (Riggs, p9-11)

So Jonson's background was remarkably similar to Shakespeare's.
He attended a grammar school in his neighborhood, and
he even had the dung heap that so fascinates Richard Kennedy
whenever he mentions Shakespeare's home in Stratford.
John Shakespeare may or may not have been illiterate. I suspect
that he could read, since he was an official of the town of Stratford.
Likewise like Jonson's stepfather, he was respectably prosperous,
his possessions amounting to the considerable sum of 500 pounds
in the late 1590's.

Of course, none of this will have the slightest impact on Crowley.

This is nonsense. Charing Cross is on the Thames.
The great walled city is a mile east. The Abbey and
the school are half a mile south -- with the great royal
palace of Whitehall occupying most of that space.
The banks of the Thames up to the City are fully
occupied by the palaces of bishops and the houses
of nobles. The river is constantly full of traffic. The
major roads (like the Strand) are likewise always
busy. Jonson sees nearly every one who matters in
the political life of the nation -- probably several times

(I spammed this reply to a thread called The Wheel, for those
interested in smash-ups. You'll see also that I quoted Knave as
Kathman at that place, but I don't think anyone is going to object to
the conflation.)

Ben Jonson is a good example of a clever young man working his way to
an education and making his mark in the world. We have proof that he
did just that. There are examples in history of others who did as
well with such a poor beginning, no doubt about that, either, and it
is POSSIBLE that Shakespeare had the beginning of an education at the
Stratford school, and it's POSSIBLE that he had access to some very
fine libraries and taught himself some languages, even that he
POSSIBLY could read books not yet translated into the English
language, and it is POSSIBLE that he had access to the Elizabethan
court and became a bosom friend of the high Lord, Henry Wriothesley,
3rd Earl of Southampton.

The problem the Stratfordians have is that there is NO PROOF that any
of these POSSIBILITIES ever came about. This is a problem that's not
going to go away, and these POSSIBILITIES never advance even to be
PROBABILITIES.

The Strats around this place have fastened themselves to a great hoax,
and let us recall the words of Lear's Fool:

&quot;Let go thy hold when a great wheel runs down a hill, let it break thy
neck with following. But the great one that goes upward, let him draw
thee after.&quot;

Those Stratfordians who are as wise (and we were all Stratfordians
previously), will let go of the Stratford wheel, for it's running
downhill as certainly as gravity is a law, and there is nothing to
call it back.

(The prompt for this note is a post by Kathman today:)

&quot;So Jonson's background was remarkably similar to Shakespeare's. He
attended a grammar school in his neighborhood, and he even had the
DUNG HEAP that so fascinates Richard Kennedy whenever he mentions
Shakespeare's home in Stratford.&quot;

Slightly aside the intent of this post, I will add that the HLAS
archives will show that in several hundred posts to HLAS I have never
said a word about any DUNG HEAP collected in front of anyone's house,
that's Knave's glazed donut invention, he's more to be pitied than
dunked.

&quot;Creepy&quot; Crowley evidently believes that Charing Cross and London are a
mile east of each other.

The gloomy look returned to Arthur's face: and I
could see it was only to distract his thoughts that
he took his place at the side of the metaphysical
young lady, and resumed their interrupted discussion.

&quot;Talking of Herbert Spencer,&quot; he began, &quot;do you
really find no _logical_ difficulty in regarding
Nature as a process of involution, passing from
definite coherent homogeneity to indefinite
incoherent heterogeneity?&quot;

Amused as I was at the ingenious jumble he had
made of Spencer's words, I kept as grave a face as
I could.

&quot;No _physical_ difficulty,&quot; she confidently
replied: &quot;but I haven't studied _Logic_ much.
Would you state the difficulty?&quot;

&quot;Well,&quot; said Arthur, &quot;do you accept it as
self-evident? Is it as obvious, for instance, as
that 'things that are greater than the same are
greater than one another'?&quot;

&quot;To my mind,&quot; she modestly replied, &quot;it seems
_quite_ as obvious. I grasp both truths by
intuition. But other minds may need some logical--
I forget the technical terms.&quot;

&quot;For a _complete_ logical argument,&quot; Arthur began
with admirable solemnity, &quot;we need two prim Misses--&quot;

&quot;Of course!&quot; she interrupted. &quot;I remember that
word now. And they produce--?&quot;

&quot;A Delusion,&quot; said Arthur.

&quot;Ye--es?&quot; she said dubiously. &quot;I don't seem to
remember that so well. But what is the _whole_
argument called?&quot;

&quot;A Sillygism?

&quot;Ah, yes! I remember now. But I don't need a
Sillygism, you know, to prove that mathematical
axiom you mentioned.&quot;

&quot;Nor to prove that 'all angles are equal', I
suppose?&quot;

&quot;Why, of course not! One takes such a simple truth
as that for granted!&quot;

Here I ventured to interpose, and to offer her a
plate of strawberries and cream. I felt really uneasy
at the thought that she _might_ detect the trick: and
I contrived, unperceived by her, to shake my head
reprovingly at the pseudo-philosopher. Equally
unperceived by her, Arthur slightly raised his
shoulders, and spread his hands abroad, as who should
say &quot;What else can I say to her?&quot; and moved away,
leaving her to discuss her strawberries by
'involution,' or any other way she preferred.

Actually, Fred, we are fairly sure Paul Crowley's father did let him go to
grammar school for three years, but then he yanked him from it. Paul has since
blamed his failure in all he has tried to his lack of education. Hence, his

Or he might have thought that a learned son would

Another poor son was Christopher Marlowe, the son
of a shoemaker who was not even made a gentleman

sign his signature, yet his will is signed with a mark,
demonstrating that the use of a mark doesn't prove
illiteracy.

Christopher was educated at the King's School.

to be &quot;fifty poor boys, both destitute of the help of
friends, and endowed with minds apt for learning, who

&gt;&gt;&gt; No one doubts that SOME sons of Elizabethan
&gt;&gt;&gt; tradesmen attended their local free grammar.
&gt;&gt;&gt; It's highly likely, for example, that Richard Field
&gt;&gt;&gt; attended the school, or he would hardly have
&gt;&gt;&gt; managed to become a printer in London. The
&gt;&gt;&gt; question is _what_proportion_ of them did so.

&gt;&gt; We have two avenues open to us to decide your question.
&gt;&gt; 1) Do some actual research
&gt;&gt; 2) Surmise what proportion of a target population would normally pass
&gt;&gt; up on a substantial benefit if it was offered to them free. 50%, do
&gt;&gt; you think? 25%? None?

&lt;snip&gt;

&gt; IF the father could read, then he would, almost
&gt; certainly have sent all his sons to the school.
&gt; Quiney (and probably Field) came into that
&gt; category.

"/>

You don't know Field was literate, do you? Neither do I, mind. But
you simply throw in that he 'probably' was because it suits your
argument to say so. You can't just make it all up as you go along,
Paul.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; But John Shakespeare was illiterate
&gt; and since he had got by ok, why should he feel
&gt; the need for his son to be different? The sheer
&gt; conservatism of the English has to be
&gt; recognised. They do NOT like anything new.

"/>

They never did, Paul. Hence they rejected the Reformation, and when
the rest of the world industrialized they stuck to the handloom.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Nearly all Europe has switched to the Euro (or
&gt; wants to) -- making hardly any fuss. But not the
&gt; UK. Oh no. The issue has destroyed the
&gt; Conservative party, and may well split the
&gt; Labour party.

"/>

Sidelining. Let's examine your argument. It goes 'The English at this
moment will not accept a change in currency: they object to it purely
on the grounds that it's new: they have always resisted all change
throughout their history : therefore any illiterate Englishman would
veto the idea of his son acquiring a better education than himself.'
If true this would lead to literacy rates today being exactly the same
as they were in the sixteenth century; only, of course, they aren't.
It's a sign of desperation to reach for racial stereotypes. The
history of England at this period is stacked solid with men providing
their sons with a better education than they had themselves. Do you
know how many grammar schools were founded between 1501 and 1601 by
these people who allegedly 'do NOT like anything new'? 186. Are you
seriously trying to claim that 186 schools were established, and the
literacy rate didn't rise? And the literacy rate cannot rise unless
illiterate men are encouraging their sons to become literate.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; But substantial townsmen of the class to which Field,
&gt;&gt; Quiney and John Shakespeare belonged are clearly not the labouring
&gt;&gt; poor. The advantages of having literate heirs obviously struck Field
&gt;&gt; and Quiney.

&gt; The advantage for a second son was clear enough
&gt; (to us at least; I doubt if it was that clear to many
&gt; of Stratford's residents at the time).

"/>

- So why do you think they went to all the trouble and expense of
founding a school?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; But why should
&gt; a first son -- due to follow on in the family business
&gt; -- need Latin and Metempsychosis?

"/>

Why did a tanner in Nantwich (pop. 1,800) think it worthwhile sending
his eldest son to grammar school? So the boy could progress a little
further in life and perhaps not be a tanner at all?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; Why do you persist in believing John Shakespeare would be
&gt;&gt; odd man out?

&gt; On the contrary, he followed the standard pattern --
&gt; and that of all his forefathers. They never needed
&gt; to read. Why should his son?

"/>

The 'standard pattern' we are talking about is not some mythical
adherence to illiteracy in the teeth of all contemporary social trends
- a pattern nobody but you seems aware of - but the normal behaviour
of men of John Shakespeare's wealth and social standing. The norm was
for them to educate their sons.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; And I must say your reluctance to accept that the
&gt;&gt; numerous grammar schools founded in English provincial towns during
&gt;&gt; the mid-16th century actually taught anyone at all, is curious.

&gt; I certainly don't question it. It is well known -- but
&gt; it only affected a small proportion of the population.

And that proportion most definitely included boys of the class to

&gt;&gt; standards had slipped so much in thirty years?

&gt; That was one grammar school (probably somewhere
&gt; prestigious -- and certainly not Stratford). And what
&gt; they said does not tell us what they did.

Okay, let me take an example from somewhere not very prestigious,
namely our own local grammar, founded in 1557. The founder said:

Of course if you're determined to believe that obscure little English

It wasn't neccessary for him to read books not yet translated into
English. You insist on that because translations of a couple of
Shakespeare's sources have not survived the years.

There is no evidence that Shakespeare was a bosom friend
of Wriothesley. The only evidence we have indicates that
Wriothesley was at one time Shakespeare's patron.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;The problem the Stratfordians have is that there is NO PROOF that any

The possibilities you mention don't exist in the first place.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;This is a problem that's not
&gt;going to go away, and these POSSIBILITIES never advance even to be

&gt;The Strats around this place have fastened themselves to a great hoax,
&gt;and let us recall the words of Lear's Fool:

&gt;&quot;Let go thy hold when a great wheel runs down a hill, let it break thy
&gt;neck with following. But the great one that goes upward, let him draw
&gt;thee after.&quot;

&gt;Those Stratfordians who are as wise (and we were all Stratfordians
&gt;previously), will let go of the Stratford wheel, for it's running
&gt;downhill as certainly as gravity is a law, and there is nothing to
&gt;call it back.

&gt;(The prompt for this note is a post by Kathman today:)

&gt;&quot;So Jonson's background was remarkably similar to Shakespeare's. He
&gt;attended a grammar school in his neighborhood, and he even had the
&gt;DUNG HEAP that so fascinates Richard Kennedy whenever he mentions
&gt;Shakespeare's home in Stratford.&quot;

&gt;Slightly aside the intent of this post, I will add that the HLAS
&gt;archives will show that in several hundred posts to HLAS I have never
&gt;said a word about any DUNG HEAP collected in front of anyone's house,
&gt;that's Kathman's glazed donut invention, he's more to be pitied than
&gt;dunked.

Your long poem on Shakespeare mentions the sewage in the streets
and feces:

So while you may have never mentioned the specific phrase, &quot;dung heap&quot;,
it's close enough.

&gt;&gt;&gt; condition of entering boys into a grammar in 1537. Do you think
&gt;&gt;&gt; standards had slipped so much in thirty years?

&gt;&gt; That was one grammar school (probably somewhere
&gt;&gt; prestigious -- and certainly not Stratford). And what
&gt;&gt; they said does not tell us what they did.

&gt; Okay, let me take an example from somewhere not very prestigious,
&gt; namely our own local grammar, founded in 1557. The founder said:
&gt; 'As touching In this scoole what shalbe taught of the maister and
&gt; lerned of the scollers...I will they were taught allwaies the good

"/>

Oddly enough (because few schools were founded in the reign of Philip and
Mary I) the school of which I know the hisory best was also founded in
1556/7. That's Hampton School in Middlesex. I'd be interested to know which
are the two schools you have recently mentioned for 1537 and 1557.

Hampton was, unusually for an endowed foundation, at first merely a petty
school for boys who might later proceed to Kingston Grammar School (and
perhaps for some girls, who would probably not have gone further); it became
a grammar school only after a further benefaction in the late 17th century.
The Founder required the vicar and churchwardens to build &quot;in the Church
yerd ... a howse with seates in yt for Children to be towght in.&quot; As to
curriculum, he specified only that &quot;the children that there shalbe brought
vpp shall praye for my soul and all Cristen soulles&quot;. Comparison with petty
schools elsewhere suggests that the children would also have been taught to
read English, to write legibly and to do very simple arithmetic. The
absolute basics - alphabet and beginners' reading - seem to have been taught
at home or by a &quot;dame&quot; in the village. As the schoolmaster was to be the
Roman Catholic vicar, one assumes that the children must also have learned
some Latin by rote. When the school was re-founded, an Oxford graduate
layman was appointed as &quot;an able Schoole Master to teach and instruct
Children in the English and Latin Tongue&quot;. This by definition established
Hampton as a grammar school, though the term was not at that time used.

Shakespeare's grammar school would undoubtedly, given its rather
distinguished line of Masters, have taught Latin and Greek to a high
standard. The mention, in your 1557 school document, of &quot;cleane and chaste
laten eyter in verse or in prose&quot; is evidence that boys were brought up to
appreciate style as well as subject matter. And if there, why not in
Stratford?

I was just making the point that Stratford society came
in two broad categories (as is the case in every culture
with written language): the literate and the illiterate.
Quiney was a member of the literate part, and ALL his
sons (and daughters) would have been literate.
Since Richard Field was literate, his father was _highly_
_probably_ literate. (That's the way it works, Rita, and
you can't deny it.) So Field (pere) probably sent ALL
his sons to the free school.

John Shakespeare came from the illiterate part of that
society, so probably sent NONE of his sons to the
school. That's the way it works, Rita. You could present
evidence to show that he broke this rule (as a very small
number do in every generation), but I have yet to see it.

&gt; The 'standard pattern' we are talking about is not some mythical
&gt; adherence to illiteracy in the teeth of all contemporary social trends
&gt; - a pattern nobody but you seems aware of - but the normal behaviour
&gt; of men of John Shakespeare's wealth and social standing. The norm was

&gt;&gt; it only affected a small proportion of the population.

Most unlikely. If John Shakespeare didn't need
to be literate, how come HIS status required
that his sons be literate? If there was such an
enormous shift in the late 1560s or early 1570s
you should have documentary evidence for it.
Of course, you have none.

The 'professional classes' needed to be literate.
In 1643 Dr Cooke clearly expected the 58-year-
old widow of the local doctor to be literate. But
he would not have made such an automatic
assumption for the bulk of the shop-keepers of
the town. They don't seem to have been much
more literate when Garrick went there around
1760

Had there been a religious college in the town,
recently preceding it? That is, did the town have a
good tradition of literacy? There had been such a
school at Evesham (down the river from Stratford)
attached to the Abbey shut down by Henry VIII.
But Stratford itself had nothing like that. It was
just another hick town.

Jonson was never, it seems, intended to take
over an inherited business. (Whereas that
should be our assumption for the Stratman.)
But neither was there an urgent need for him
to make a living. On the other hand he was clever;
so he got a good education and, in due course,
found his way into a literary career. He went to
one of the top London schools, acquiring
William Camden as a both a teacher and a
kind of patron.

Nuts. No one was going to travel to Stratford
to buy gloves (or wool, or grain, butcher's
meat or whatever it was); they were stuck
with the locals, who only cared about value

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Or he
&gt; might have just wanted him to aspire to the clergy
&gt; or higher education. Many less wealthy and downright
&gt; poor students were sponsored by wealthier patrons,

&gt; scholarships like that.

Sure. And we'd all agree that the author
(whoever he was) was immensely
intelligent. So why DIDN'T the Stratman
get a scholarship to Oxford? The answer
is as plain as a pikestaff.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Another poor son was Christopher Marlowe, the son

Canterbury was much more sophisticated
and cosmopolitan than Stratford. And, it

You said the local backgrounds of the young
Jonson and the young Shagsper were similar.
One lived in the great city, and walked to
school every day through the palace of
Whitehall. One would have heard every item
of news (about, say, the sea battles of 1588)
as it came in. The other would have got a
brief summary a week later. One would have
known (at least by sight) everyone important
at court. The other would only have heard the

Since I was clearly not disagreeing with Riggs on

&gt;&gt;&gt; IF the father could read, then he would, almost

&gt;&gt;&gt; Quiney (and probably Field) came into that

&gt;&gt; You don't know Field was literate, do you? Neither do I, mind. But
&gt;&gt; you simply throw in that he 'probably' was because it suits your
&gt;&gt; argument to say so. You can't just make it all up as you go along,
&gt;&gt; Paul.

&gt; I was just making the point that Stratford society came
&gt; in two broad categories (as is the case in every culture
&gt; with written language): the literate and the illiterate.
&gt; Quiney was a member of the literate part, and ALL his
&gt; sons (and daughters) would have been literate.
&gt; Since Richard Field was literate, his father was _highly_
&gt; _probably_ literate. (That's the way it works, Rita, and
&gt; you can't deny it.) So Field (pere) probably sent ALL
&gt; his sons to the free school.

"/>

Absolutely not. It's pure nonsense to postulate 'literate/illiterate'
categories as if they were mutually exclusive social groups at a time
when literacy rates were on the rise, when the advantages of literacy
were absolutely obvious to all intelligent people and when schools
were being founded left, right and centre to offer new educational
opportunities to a widening range of pupils.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; John Shakespeare came from the illiterate part of that

&gt; number do in every generation), but I have yet to see it.
&gt; [..]

"/>

This 'rule' is a product of your own wishful thinking. You are
entirely wrong. All first-generation literates are, ipso facto, the
sons of illiterate men. Therefore at some point an illiterate father
has made it possible for his son to become literate. The factors
influencing the illiterate father to ensure education for his sons are
material - can he afford it? - and psychological - is he ambitious to
better his family? There is clear evidence that John Shakespeare, a
substantial citizen of exactly the same social class as Quiney and
Field, could afford to send his sons to school. There is clear
evidence that John Shakespeare, who began as a tenant farmer at
Snitterfield and became a substantial property-owning businessman in
Stratford, who held the highest office available to him in his town
and who applied for a grant of arms, was an ambitious man - socially
ambitious, as the grant of arms application shows. He would obviously
want to have educated sons. It is sheer nonsense to suggest he was
mysteriously keen to act like some dog-in-a-manger and deprive his
sons of the considerable financial and social advantage of literacy
because 'that's the way it works'. It doesn't work that way at all.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Why did a tanner in Nantwich (pop. 1,800) think it worthwhile sending

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;&gt; On the contrary, he followed the standard pattern --
&gt;&gt;&gt; and that of all his forefathers. They never needed

&gt;&gt; The 'standard pattern' we are talking about is not some mythical
&gt;&gt; adherence to illiteracy in the teeth of all contemporary social trends
&gt;&gt; - a pattern nobody but you seems aware of - but the normal behaviour
&gt;&gt; of men of John Shakespeare's wealth and social standing. The norm was
&gt;&gt; for them to educate their sons.

&gt; That's an argument you'd have to prove. It
&gt; would, almost certainly, turn out to be
&gt; exceedingly complex -- or, to put it simply --
&gt; false.

"/>

I think you're hoping the loss of documentation for the early years of
grammar schools will mean the facts are hard to prove. But the rise
in foundations of grammars between 1501-1651 can easily be shown, and
I will happily dig around to see what can be said about the social
profile of their pupils.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; And I must say your reluctance to accept that the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; numerous grammar schools founded in English provincial towns during
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the mid-16th century actually taught anyone at all, is curious.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I certainly don't question it. It is well known -- but
&gt;&gt;&gt; it only affected a small proportion of the population.

&gt;&gt; And that proportion most definitely included boys of the class to
&gt;&gt; which William Shakespeare belonged.

&gt; Most unlikely. If John Shakespeare didn't need
&gt; to be literate, how come HIS status required
&gt; that his sons be literate?

"/>

Because literacy was the norm in the social group into which he had
elevated himself. Did he not apply for a grant of arms to entitle
himself and his sons to the rank of gentleman? Who says that most
English gentlemen of the period weren't literate? He was clearly
ambitious to provide a better life for his family than he could have
known himself. Thanks to him his sons would have eaten better,
dressed better and had a better education than had been available to
him as a tenant farmer's son in Snitterfield.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; If there was such an
&gt; enormous shift in the late 1560s or early 1570s

Gentlemen needed to be literate, or other gentlemen looked down on

&gt;&gt; Okay, let me take an example from somewhere not very prestigious,
&gt;&gt; namely our own local grammar, founded in 1557.

&gt; Had there been a religious college in the town,
&gt; recently preceding it?
No.
&gt; That is, did the town have a
&gt; good tradition of literacy?

"/>

Definitely not. Actually, calling it a town at this point was doing
it a favour. It was smaller than Nantwich, which had a population of
around 1,800

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; There had been such a
&gt; school at Evesham (down the river from Stratford)
&gt; attached to the Abbey shut down by Henry VIII.
&gt; But Stratford itself had nothing like that. It was
&gt; just another hick town.

"/>

It was a damn sight bigger and less hick than this neck of the woods.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; The founder said:
&gt;&gt; 'As touching In this scoole what shalbe taught of the maister and

&gt; These are _aspirations_ in a 'mission
&gt; statement'. What else was the guy going
&gt; to say?

"/>

He was putting the money up, Paul, so presumably he thought he could
get what he was paying for. Actually he did get what he paid for,
since a boy educated at his school not only went on to be master at
another grammar school but also published a book of Latin verse in the
1590s.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Of course if you're determined to believe that obscure little English

&gt;&gt; documentary evidence to the contrary is going to have much impact, is
&gt;&gt; it?

&gt; I'm just asking you to get real. The boys

&gt; Many of them would have had NO help at

Sure. They have always been mutually exclusive --

classes read, think, use long words, know foreign
languages and talk about abstract things; lower

The literate don't usually marry the illiterate -- for

A literate man wants literate children, so he wants a

No I don't, actually. The meagre evidence of my own family's history

it does today the world over. This is not evidence that girls

Paul you can no more prove the illiteracy of his daughters than you

argue nothing from the fact that their names don't show up in a
grammar school or university register. As 17th century provincial
gentlewomen they're unlikely to have written books. And if none of
their letters survive - so what? They lived a long time ago. On that

are mainly illiterate because they're lazy or stupid. Many factors
prevent people from achieving the education they want - even when all
they want is basic literacy.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Most unlikely. If John Shakespeare didn't need
&gt;&gt;&gt; to be literate, how come HIS status required
&gt;&gt;&gt; that his sons be literate?

&gt;&gt; Because literacy was the norm in the social group into which he had
&gt;&gt; elevated himself.

&gt; He did not 'elevate' himself.

He did. He started off the son of a tenant farmer in Snitterfield and
ended up a gentleman.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; He married relatively
&gt; well -- into a family of illiterates, gaining an illiterate
&gt; wife.

His wife's sixty acres didn't entitle him to become town bailiff. Her
links to the Ardens didn't persuade the council to send him to London
to represent their interests to parliament. They didn't think 'That
man's married well - we must make him J.P.'. He was an important man
in Stratford, running a business and holding various public offices
for twenty years. The historical record can't be suppressed or
misinterpreted to fit your desired image of the Shakespeares.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; Did he not apply for a grant of arms to entitle
&gt;&gt; himself and his sons to the rank of gentleman?

&gt; No. This was a legal fiction. Sons could only apply in
&gt; the names of their fathers.

"/>

John made the earliest application. The first surviving draft of arms
(1596), in his name, has the memorandum 'This John showeth a pattern
thereof under Clarenceux Cooke's hand in paper twenty years past'. I
suppose you can argue if you like that 'twenty years past' should be
interpreted precisely. That gives a date of 1576, and not the 1568/9
which authorities traditionally choose because that was the year
Clarenceux Cooke made his visitation commission into Warwickshire, and
also the year John Shakespeare was town bailiff and justice of the
peace. But even if you go for 1576 it would mean that when the
application was first made, William was a boy of 12. Perhaps you
think he was a very unusual boy of 12 - independently wealthy, keen on
social advancement able to ...

Irrelevant. The question is how long would it take a teacher to teach a normal
boy how to read and write. Most modern kids learn to read and write English in
three years in my country.

I think the Stratman had a good brain, Paul. I think he probably learned
to read and write in much less than three years. I think that he was exposed
somewhere to a book, and was enthralled (as I was in nursery school--before I
could speak intelligibly). Someone was around--yes, even in Stratford that was
possible, Paul--to point to written words and pronounce them. Once he knew
enough of them, his superior intelligence would have done the rest. Not being a
rigidnik, he would not have needed three hundred adults pounding letters, words
and penmanship into him. He would have sought out books and guessed and
absorbed everything he needed. Not that he wouldn't have had a few adults
helping--the parish priest, for instance, might have enjoyed helping so willing
a pupil. But he would not have been necessary. Learning is natural, Paul.
Human beings are born to do it. Being taught is only necessary for rigidniks.

&gt;&gt; Of course if you're determined to believe that obscure little English
&gt;&gt; country towns in the mid-16th century just didn't, simply *couldn't*,

Perhaps Paul should learn more about schooling in England in Shakespeare's
time. Reading and writing English wasn't the main concern of a grammar
school; the basics had already been attended to in the petty school. Rita
has cited evidence that competence in reading and writing English (and even
some Latin) was a necessary preparation for entering at least one
pre-Elizabethan grammar school. (The Latin may have meant only perhaps the
Paternoster and Ave Maria, since her example is from 1537 when Latin was
still the language of the English church.)

Even in much more recent times (say 30 years ago), boys started Latin in
preparatory schools at 7 or 8, and when they came to sit Common Entrance at
12 they were pretty good at it; I know, because I was a CE examiner and saw
the scripts. I can well believe that a bright Elizabethan boy of 13 would
have been formidably competent in reading, writing and even speaking Latin.
Unlike that of a modern boy, his schooling consisted of little else, in the
sense that, for example, history was taught from Roman authors and English
rhetoric as an adaptation of Latin models.

We've certainly had more than you're capable of admitting--though they expressed
themselves in different ways from Shakespeare. But you are again
misassuming what I'm saying. I am not saying that anyone can become a
Shakespeare because learning is natural. I am saying anyone can learn, and will
learn. What I didn't say this time around explicitly is that how much one
learns depends hugely on the mental equipment (nervous, circulatory and
endocrinological systems) one is born with. This you apparently do not believe.
Perhaps because you believe everyone is born mentally equal, and what one
becomes depends only on how much guidance he is given by adults?
