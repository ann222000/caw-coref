if I am canning peach jam for instance, my last batch calls for 3 cups of
peaches, if I only have 2.5 cups, what can I use for filler. would water
work to extend the recipe to three cups.

thanks

Not quite. I think a quarter cup would be the farthest I would eke out a
recipe with water. That would slightly upset the sugar/water/acid/pectin
ratio and may result in a soft set. I would do without the water and make it
short. Or use unsweetened (orange, apple, berry, grape?) juice. Best. keep
some whole frozen strawberries in the freezer, and add them to whatever is
short. Can't possibly hurt. And useful for so many other things!

No.  You need some kind of chopped fruit.  Canned peaches?  Mango?
Orange pulp?  Raspberries?

Are you using pectin or just cooking sugar and peaches together?  If the
latter, simply reduce the amount of sugar proportionately.    If the
former, I like Gloria's recommendation of more pulp -- all her
suggestions would be good.  Or apricot, too.  Consider a half cup of
diced dried aps, soaked for a few minutes, then drained before adding to
the peaches.   You could do worse.

I wouldn't soak them. They'll rehydrate in the pot, no?  Which helps in
&quot;using up&quot; the excess water.

well just put that part off, bought some more peaches to make the full
recipe, takes all that guess work out of the equation.
