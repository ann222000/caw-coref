'To fill with WORM-holes stately monuments,
To feed OBLIVION with decay of things,
To BLOT old books and alter their contents,'
-----------------------------------------------------------
AN INTRODUCTION TO THE SURVEY AND
NATURAL HISTORY OF THE NORTH DIVISION
OF THE COUNTY OP WILTSHIRE.

BY J. AUBREY, ESQ.

&lt;&lt;In former days the churches and great houses hereabouts did so abound
with monuments and things remarkable, that it would have deterred an
antiquary from undertaking it. But as Pythagoras did guess at the
vastness of Hercules' stature by the length of his foot, so among
these ruins are remains enough left for a man to give a guess what
noble buildings, &amp;c. were made by the piety, charity, and
magnanimity of our forefathers.

And as in prospects, we are there pleased most where something keeps
the eye from being lost, and leaves us room to guess; so here the eye
and mind is no less affected with these stately ruins, than they would
have been when standing and entire. They breed in generous minds a
kind of pity, and sets the thoughts a-work to make out their magnifice
as they were taken in perfection. These remains are &quot;tanquam Tabulata
Naufragii&quot;, that after the revolution of so many years and
governments, have escaped the teeth of Time, and (which is more
dangerous) the hands of mistaken Zeal. So that the retrieving of these
forgotten things from OBLIVION, in some sort resembles that of a
conjurer, who make those walk and appear that have lain in their
graves many hundreds of years, and to represent, as it were to the
eye, the places, customs, and fashions that were of old time.&gt;&gt;

&quot;Wherefore considering the small harm I do to you, the great good I do to
others, I prefer mine own intention to discover your volume before YOUR
REQUEST TO SECRET THE SAME; wherein I may seem to you to play the part
of the cunning and expert mediciner or physician, who, although his
patient in the extremity of his burning fever is desirous of cold liquor
or drink to qualify his SORE thirst, or rather kill his languishing
body, yet for the danger he doth evidently know by his science to ensue,
denieth him the same. So you being sick of too much doubt in your own
proceedings, through which infirmity you are desirous to bury and
insevill your works IN THE GRAVE OF OBLIVION, yet I, knowing the
discommodities that shall redound to yourself thereby (and which is
more, unto your countrymen) as one that is willing to salve so great
an inconvenience, am nothing dainty to deny your request.&quot;&gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt;The attorney's clerk had taken a great fancy to the sagacity of Partridge.
Whether this proceeded from the great discernment which the former had into
men, as well as things, or whether it arose from the sympathy between their
minds; for they were both truly Jacobites in principle; they now shook hands
heartily, and drank bumpers of strong beer to healths which we think proper
to bury in OBLIVION.&gt;&gt;

Those scraps are good deeds past; which are devour'd
As fast as they are made, forgot as soon
As done: perseverance, dear my lord,
Keeps honour bright: to have done is to hang
Quite out of fashion, like a rusty mail
In monumental mockery.

THE LOVE OF BOOKS
THE PHILOBIBLON OF RICHARD DE BURY
TRANSLATED INTO ENGLISH BY E. C. THOMAS

&quot;TAKE THOU A BOOK INTO THINE HANDS AS SIMON THE JUST TOOK THE CHILD JESUS
INTO HIS ARMS TO CARRY HIM AND KISS HIM. AND WHEN THOU HAST FINISHED
READING, CLOSE THE BOOK AND GIVE THANKS FOR EVERY WORD OUT OF THE MOUTH OF
GOD; BECAUSE IN THE LORD'S FIELD THOU HAST FOUND A HIDDEN TREASURE.&quot;
-- THOMAS A KEMPIS: Doctrinale Juvenum

PREFACE | CONTENTS

The Author of the Book. Richard de Bury (1281-1345), so called from being
born near Bury St. Edmunds, was the son of Sir Richard Aungerville. He
studied at Oxford; and was subsequently chosen to be tutor to Prince Edward
of Windsor, afterwards Edward III. His loyalty to the cause of Queen
Isabella and the Prince involved him in danger. On the accession of his
pupil he was made successively Cofferer, Treasurer of the Wardrobe,
Archdeacon of Northampton, Prebendary of Lincoln, Sarum, and Lichfield,
Keeper of the Privy Purse, Ambassador on two occasions to Pope John XXII,
who appointed him a chaplain of the papal chapel, Dean of Wells, and
ultimately, at the end of the year 1333, Bishop of Durham; the King and
Queen, the King of Scots, and all the magnates north of the Trent, together
with a multitude of nobles and many others, were present at his
enthronization. It is noteworthy that during his stay at Avignon, probably
in 1330, he made the acquaintance of Petrarch, who has left us a brief
account of their intercourse. In 1332 Richard visited Cambridge, as one of
the King's commissioners, to inquire into the state of the King's Scholars
there, and perhaps then became a member of the Gild of St. Mary--one of the
two gilds which founded Corpus Christi College.

In 1334 he became High Chancellor of England, and Treasurer in 1336,
resigning the former office in 1335, so that he might help the King in
dealing with affairs abroad and in Scotland, and took a most distinguished
part in diplomatic negociations between England and France. In 1339 he was
again in his bishopric. Thereafter his name occurs often among those
appointed to treat of peace with Philip of France, and with Bruce of
Scotland. It appears that he was not in Parliament in 1344. Wasted by long
sickness--longa infirmitate decoctus--on the 14th of April, 1345, Richard de
Bury died at Auckland, and was buried in Durham Cathedral.

CHAPTER I

THAT THE TREASURE OF WISDOM IS CHIEFLY CONTAINED IN BOOKS

The desirable treasure of wisdom and science, which all men desire by an
instinct of nature, infinitely surpasses all the riches of the world; in
respect of which precious stones are worthless; in comparison with which
silver is as clay and pure gold is as a little sand; at whose splendour the
sun and moon are dark to look upon; compared with whose marvellous sweetness
honey and manna are bitter to the taste. O value of wisdom that fadeth not
away with time, virtue ever flourishing, that cleanseth its possessor from
all venom! O heavenly gift of the divine bounty, descending from the Father
of lights, that thou mayest exalt the rational soul to the very heavens!
Thou art the celestial nourishment of the intellect, which those who eat
shall still hunger and those who drink shall still thirst, and the
gladdening harmony of the languishing soul which he that hears shall never
be confounded. Thou art the moderator and rule of morals, which he who
follows shall not sin. By thee kings reign and princes decree justice. By
thee, rid of their native rudeness, their minds and tongues being polished,
the thorns of vice being torn up by the roots, those men attain high places
of honour, and become fathers of their country, and companions of princes,
who without thee would have melted their spears into pruning-hooks and
ploughshares, or would perhaps be feeding swine with the prodigal.

Where dost thou chiefly lie hidden, O most elect treasure! and where shall
thirsting souls discover thee?

Certes, thou hast placed thy tabernacle in books, where the Most High, the
Light of lights, the Book of Life, has established thee. There everyone who
asks receiveth thee, and everyone who seeks finds thee, and to everyone that
knocketh boldly it is speedily opened. Therein the cherubim spread out their
wings, that the intellect of the students may ascend and look from pole to
pole, from the east and west, from the north and from the south. Therein the
mighty and incomprehensible God Himself is apprehensibly contained and
worshipped; therein is revealed the nature of things celestial, terrestrial,
and infernal; therein are discerned the laws by which every state is
administered, the offices of the celestial hierarchy are distinguished, and
the tyrannies of demons described, such as neither the ideas of Plato
transcend, nor the chair of Crato contained.

In books I find the dead as if they were alive; in books I foresee things to
come; in books warlike affairs are set forth; from books come forth the laws
of peace. All things are corrupted and decay in time; Saturn ceases not to
devour the children that he generates; all the glory of the world would be
buried in oblivion, unless God had provided mortals with the remedy of
books.

CHAPTER VII. OF RECOMPENSES OF HONOUR
Translated by Charles Cotton, Edited by Hazlitt, 1877

&lt;&lt;Now, to expect that in obliterating and abolishing this, suddenly to
create and bring into credit a like institution, is not a proper attempt for
so licentious and so sick a time as this wherein we now are; and it will
fall out that the last will from its birth incur the same inconveniences
that have ruined the other. -[Montaigne refers to the Order of the
Saint-Esprit, instituted by Henry III. in 1578.]- The rules for dispensing
this new order had need to be extremely clipt and bound under great
restrictions, to give it authority; and this tumultuous season is incapable
of such a curb: besides that, before this can be brought into repute, 'tis
necessary that the memory of the first, and of the contempt into which it is
fallen, be BURIED IN OBLIVION.&gt;&gt;

ESSAY ON THE LIFE AND WRITINGS OF SHAKSPEARE.

by , Charles Henry Wheeler 1833

&lt;&lt;With these imperfect particulars,

derived from the united labours of various admirers and commentators,
our brief sketch of the life of Shakspeare must necessarily conclude.
On all the topics which usually constitute the personal history
of an individual, his contemporaries and immediate successors
have been equally silent. The meagre facts which were first imbodied
in a memoir by Mr. Rowe, and have been moulded into so many forms
by the caprice or taste of successive writers, remain to the present day,
unaided by any accession of novelty, and unimpeached by the utmost acuteness
of criticism. His early studies-the progress of his pen-his moral and
social qualities

-his, friendships AND HIS ERRORS, are completely BURIED IN OBLIVION,

as if the homage which is paid to his splendid poetical genius,
should be unmingled with any recollection of his faults and failings as
a man. Nor, after an interval of two centuries, is it probable that any
undiscovered clue is in existence, by which the memorial of his actions
can be redeemed from its present obscurity.&gt;&gt;

The Author's Preface To The Reader (Shelton translation)

'For how can I choose,' quoth I, 'but be much
confounded at that which the old legislator (the vulgar) will say, when
it sees that, after the end of so many years as are spent since I first
slept in the bosom of OBLIVION, I come out loaden with my GREY hairs,
and bring with me a book as dry as a kex, void of invention, barren of
good phrase, poor of conceits, and altogether empty both of learning and
eloquence; without quotations on the margents, or annotations in the end
of the book, wherewith I see other books are still adorned, be they
never so idle, fabulous, and profane; so full of sentences of Aristotle
and Plato, and the other crew of the philosophers, as admires
the readers, and makes them believe that these authors
are very learned and eloquent?

As You Like It Act 2, Scene 7

JAQUES All the world's a stage,
And all the men and women merely players:
They have their exits and their entrances;
And one man in his time plays many parts,
His acts being SEVEN ages. At first the infant,
Mewling and puking in the nurse's arms.
And then the whining school-boy, with his satchel
And shining morning face, creeping like snail
Unwillingly to school. And then the lover,
Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad
Made to his mistress' eyebrow. Then a soldier,
Full of STRANGE oaths and bearded like the pard,
Jealous in honour, sudden and quick in quarrel,
Seeking the BUBBLE reputation
Even in the cannon's mouth. And then the justice,
In fair round belly with good capon lined,
With eyes seVERE and beard of formal cut,
Full of wise saws and modern instances;
And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts
Into the lean and slipper'd pantaloon,
With spectacles on nose and pouch on side,
His youthful hose, well saved, a world too wide
For his shrunk shank; and his big manly voice,
Turning again toward childish treble, pipes
And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all,
That ends this STRANGE eventful history,
Is second childishness and mere OBLIVION,
Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sanS EVERything.

_The Ern Malley Poetry Hoax_ - by David Lehman

&lt;&lt;The greatest literary hoax of the twentieth century was concocted
by a couple of Australian soldiers at their desks in the offices of the
Victoria Barracks in Melbourne, land headquarters of the Australian
army, on a quiet Saturday in October 1943.

In a single rollicking afternoon McAuley and Stewart cooked up the
collected works of Ernest Lalor Malley. Imitating modern poets they
most despised ('not Max Harris in particular, but the whole literary
fashion as we knew it from the works of Dylan Thomas, Henry Treece,
and others'), they rapidly wrote the sixteen poems that constitute Ern
Malley's 'tragic lifework.' They lifted lines at random from the books
and papers on their desks (Shakespeare, a dictionary of quotations, an
American report on the breeding grounds of mosquitoes, etc.). They mixed
in false allusions and misquotations, dropped 'confused &amp; inconsistent
hints at a meaning' in place of a coherent theme, and deliberately
produced what they thought was bad verse.

They called their creation Malley because mal in French means bad.

Later, the hoaxers added a high-sounding 'preface and statement,'
outfitted Malley with a tearjerking biography, and created his suburban
sister Ethel. The invention of Ethel was a masterstroke. It was she who
sent Malley's posthumous opus, 'The Darkening Ecliptic', to Max Harris
along with a cover letter tinged with her disapproval of her brother's
bohemian ways and proclaiming her own ignorance of poetry.

Ern (she wrote) had been born in England in 1918, was taken to Australia
after his father's death two years later, and was left in Ethel's care
after their mother died when he was fifteen. Having dropped out of
school, the young man worked as a garage mechanic in Sydney and later
as an insurance salesman and part-time watch repairman in Melbourne.
In 1943 he returned to Sydney, where he died of 'Grave's Disease.'

Artless Ethel, the bourgeois philistine, had the effect of
authenticating Ern's poignant existence. The simplicity of her account
inspired Harris to construct the poignant life-story of a poet who
burned Keats-like in a flame snuffed out before its time. 'The weeks
before he died were terrible,' Ethel wrote. 'Sometimes he would be all
right and he would talk to me. From things he said I gathered he had
been fond of a girl in Melbourne, but had some sort of difference with
her. I didn't want to ask him too much because he was nervy and
irritable. The crisis came suddenly, and he passed away on Friday
the 23rd of July. As he wished, he was cremated at Rookwood.'

McAuley and Stewart saw to it that Malley had, like Keats, died
at the age of twenty-five. 'Now in your honour Keats, I spin / The
loaded Zodiac with my left hand / As the man at the fair revolves
/ His coloured deceitful board,' Malley writes in 'Colloquy with
John Keats.' And, Like you I sought at first for Beauty

And then, in disgust, returned
As did you to the locus of sensation
And not till then did my voice build crenellated towers
Of an enteric substance in the air.

Amid the red herrings scattered in the poems, McAuley and Stewart did
sprinkle a few genuine clues to the mystery of Ern Malley. From
'Sybilline,' for example, these splendid lines hint at
Malley's ghostly nature:

It is necessary to understand
That a poet may not exist, that his writings
Are the incomplete circle and straight drop
Of a question mark
And yet I know I shall be raised up
On the vertical banners of praise.

It was, however, possible to take these lines metaphorically as the
dying man's vision of impending OBLIVION and posthumous applause.&gt;&gt;

------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;&lt;SIR HENRY WYATT (1460-1537), the father of the poet, resisted
the pretensions of Richard III to the throne, and was in consequence
arrested and imprisoned in the Tower for two years. According to his
son's statement he was racked in Richard's presence and vinegar and
MUSTARD were forced down his throat. There is an old tradition in the
family that while in the Tower a cat brought him a pigeon every day from
a neighbouring dovecot and thus saved him from starvation. The Earl of
Romney, who is directly descended in the female line from the Wyatts,
possesses a curious half-length portrait of Sir Henry seated in a prison
cell with a cat drawing towards him a pigeon through the grating of a
window. Lord Romney also possesses a second picture of 'The cat that
fed Sir Henry Wyatt,' besides a small bust portrait of Sir Henry. The
pictures, illustrating the tradition of the cat (now at Lord Romney's
house, 4 upper Belgrave Street;, London), represent Sir Henry Wyatt in
advanced years, and were obviously painted on hearsay evidence
very long after the date of the alleged events they claim to depict.&gt;&gt;

Wyat, Sir Thomas (1503-1542), English poet and diplomatist, belonged
to a family long settled with some distinction in the West Riding of
Yorkshire. In the time of Henry VII the family moved to Kent and in 1493
the poet's father, Henry, bought the castle and estate of Allington near
Maidstone, where ten years later his elder son Thomas was born to his
wife, Anne, daughter of John Skinner of Reigate, Surrey. Henry Wyat
maintained his family's standing; after being imprisoned and according
to his son tortured by Richard III, he became a privy councilor to Henry
VII, a knight of the Bath at the coronation of Henry VIII, knight
banneret in 1513, and treasurer of the King's Chamber in 1523. Till his
death in 1536 he showed a practical, affectionate, and trusting interest
in his son's welfare, revealed in letters of 1536 to Thomas Cromwell;
his character is movingly commemorated by the poet in letters to his
son, Thomas the younger.
