Why is &quot;another war&quot; always presented as the only logical solution to
almost every international crisis?  Do we have any idea what we're
doing, or do we just naturally think that &quot;sending in the marine and
the cruise missiles&quot; will &quot;fix it&quot;?  Could we send Dick Cheney first
this time?

Pakistan: America’s Dubious Ally in Terror War By Michael Hirsh And Ron Moreau Newsweek
Aug.
20-27, 2007 issue - Pervez Musharraf has always been a dubious ally in
George W. Bush's War on Terror—the kind of guy you avert your eyes from
while patting him on the back. It's not that Bush doubts the Pakistani
leader's sincerity—&quot;He shares the same concern about radicals and
extremists as I do and as the American people do,&quot; the president said
at an Aug. 9 news conference—it's just that Musharraf is never going to
make it into Bush's democracy club. And Musharraf's ability to stop his
nation's Islamist radicalism from spilling over into terrorism has
always been limited. A genial autocrat who seized power in a 1999 coup
and has refused to relinquish his general's uniform, Musharraf has
succeeded in keeping Washington on his side by regularly handing over
second-tier Qaeda suspects and by keeping tenuous control over his
increasingly Islamicized country. But now Musharraf may be losing his
grip on power amid rising concerns by senior U.S. officials that a new
safe haven for Al Qaeda has emerged in Pakistan's rocky, ungoverned
tribal regions, especially Waziristan.
As a
result, an increasing number of voices in
Washington—from Democratic
presidential candidate Barack Obama to hard-line officials in the Bush
administration—are calling for unilateral military action inside
Pakistan. NEWSWEEK has learned that for weeks Pentagon officials
have
been debating the current policy of not violating Pakistani
sovereignty, coming down in favor of restraint. But some officers in
Joint Special Operations Command are &quot;pawing the ground to go into
Waziristan,&quot; says one Pentagon consultant who is privy to the debate
but would speak about classified discussions only anonymously.
Congress, meanwhile, has passed legislation that threatens to cut off
aid to Pakistan if President Bush can't certify that Musharraf is doing
all he can. &quot;It's very humiliating for Musharraf,&quot; says retired
Pakistani Lt. Gen. Talat Masood. &quot;It could even destabilize him.&quot;
That's one reason Bush continues to stand by him. Administration
officials fear that if Musharraf falls and Pakistan descends into
political chaos, then a nuclear-armed state could fail and Pakistan's
nuclear know-how might end up in the wrong hands.
Even
short of that doomsday scenario, senior U.S. officials, both active and
retired, say that without more decisive action Al Qaeda will grow, if
not flourish, in the tribal areas. And someday the U.S. homeland will
likely be attacked from there, they say, just as Al Qaeda once used
Afghanistan as a base from which to plot the 9/11 attacks. In late July
a National Intelligence Estimate—a periodic assessment that is
considered the most authoritative issued by the U.S.
government—concluded Al Qaeda has &quot;regenerated key elements&quot; of its
ability to attack the United States from the tribal regions of North
Waziristan and Bajaur. Hank Crumpton, a near-legendary CIA clandestine
service officer who retired last year as the State Department's
counterterrorism coordinator, says Washington needs to do more than
rely on the Pakistani military and intelligence services. &quot;I'd go in
there [tribal areas] with a hard-core counterinsurgency effort,&quot;
Crumpton told NEWSWEEK. He would seek Pakistan's consent—&quot;but I
wouldn't pretend that this is sovereign territory. It is not.&quot;
Another
recently retired senior CIA official, Bruce Riedel, says that Pakistan
remains fatally conflicted about cracking down on Islamic extremists.
That's even though Qaeda No. 2 Ayman al-Zawahiri (who along with Osama
bin Laden is believed to be hiding in the Pakistani tribal areas) has
tried to assassinate Musharraf at least twice. As eager as Musharraf
may be to get bin Laden and Zawahiri, his enthusiasm is not necessarily
shared by Pakistani intelligence. Riedel says: &quot;It has no desire to
either take on its Frankenstein or to see its Frankenstein removed.&quot;
Pakistani
officials angrily dispute that assessment, and they say they are doing
all that can be done. They note that some 350 Pakistani soldiers were
killed in tribal actions in 2004 and 2005, leading Musharraf to try to
reach a peace agreement with tribal elders that has since frayed.
&quot;There are no safe havens,&quot; Mahmud Ali Durrani, Pakistan's ambassador
to the United States, told NEWSWEEK, saying the NIE is &quot;absolutely
incorrect.&quot; &quot;This is preposterous. We will agree there may be odd
people in hideouts. But ... whenever we get information we take them
out. Even after we signed the agreement, we went into Waziristan and
Bajaur five or six times this year. We went after the training camps.&quot;
Still, Durrani confirmed that the government is very concerned about
the extremists &quot;creeping outside the tribal areas&quot; and said Musharraf
had launched &quot;a new push&quot; that includes adding 20,000 more
paramilitaries to the 100,000 troops already bordering those areas.
That, and additional training, &quot;will take about six months,&quot; Durrani
says.
Whether Musharraf has that much time
is another question. Since he faced down an Islamist rebellion at a
mosque in the heart of his capital city, Islamabad, he has appeared to
lose control of his country's security. Al Qaeda-affiliated armed
militants have retaliated strongly, killing nearly 200 people, chiefly
police and soldiers, in a spate of IED attacks and suicide bombings in
the lawless tribal region along the Afghan frontier, as well as two
suicide attacks in Islamabad.
In response,
the Pakistani leader has flirted with the idea of declaring a state of
emergency that would extend his rule for at least one year, postponing
both the presidential election, scheduled for late next month, and the
general election, due early next year. The state of emergency would
give him sweeping powers and allow him to curb civil liberties sharply.
After an early-morning call from Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice on
Aug. 9, however, Musharraf agreed to back down &quot;for the time being,&quot; a
U.S. official said, speaking as usual on condition of anonymity about
high-level discussions.
Yet
another measure of Musharraf's waning power is the eagerness with which
he has politically courted a woman he once publicly called a &quot;thief&quot;
for alleged corruption during her two terms as prime minister—Benazir
Bhutto. In early August Musharraf flew secretly to Abu Dhabi to meet
Bhutto, whose secular Pakistani People's Party remains the most popular
in the country. Musharraf had been reaching out to Bhutto halfheartedly
for a year, but after he summarily ousted the nation's Supreme Court
justice in March, provoking widespread demonstrations, his popularity
plummeted. Now he seems desperate to bring her into a coalition
government that will blunt the calls for his resignation. &quot;Musharraf is
in a tough place,&quot; says Riedel. &quot;She knows she has the upper hand now.&quot;
In an Aug. 10 interview, Bhutto said the &quot;ground reality&quot; has changed
in Pakistan. She confirmed that she and Musharraf are discussing the
creation of a &quot;caretaker government,&quot; but said she would not join it
&quot;while he is wearing his uniform.&quot;
For
the United States, the No. 1 concern is figuring out a way to crush the
resurgence of Al Qaeda and the Taliban in Waziristan and Bajaur,
without doing fatal damage to Musharraf. Some U.S. officials say the
Pakistani military is simply not up to the job—but no one else may be,
either. &quot;This is a part of the country that has not been effectively
governed since Alexander the Great was there,&quot; says Deputy Assistant
Secretary of State John Gastright. Pakistani officials point to the
successes they've had inside their cities in arresting Qaeda bigwigs
like Khalid Shaikh Mohammed.
Ambassador
Durrani says the real fault lies with Washington. After KSM was
captured in Rawalpindi in March 2003—just as Bush was invading Iraq—&quot;I
think Al Qaeda was almost destroyed in an operational sense. But then
Al Qaeda got a vacuum in Afghanistan. And they got a motivational area
in Iraq. Al Qaeda rejuvenated. And what Pakistan is getting now is the
blowback from that, rather than the other way around.&quot; The
worry now is
that blowback will some day cross the Atlantic—and no one is
effectively stopping it.
