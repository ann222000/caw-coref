The Mets are the best . . . period.  They had some bad luck in
Philidelphia.  Strange calls by some umps; bloops that fell in; balls
that were well hit but which were 3 feet short of a homer.

They swept Atlanta at Turner Field. This is the first time they've
done that this year.

Still, you never know what you're gonna get with this team. When
they're on their game, they're awesome. When they're not....?

So true.  They are a bit unpredictable . . . like a woman with PMS.
But I have faith!!
