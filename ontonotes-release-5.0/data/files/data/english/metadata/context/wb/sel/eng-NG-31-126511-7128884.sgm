*Embryonic Stem Cell Legislation Stokes Hearty Debate*
By: Chris Frates
April 10, 2007 08:33 AM EST

Factions on both sides of the embryonic stem cell debate have been importing
doctors, patients and activists to the Capitol since January to present
their arguments to lawmakers and whoever else will listen. That work
culminates Tuesday when the Senate begins to debate the Democratic-backed
effort to lift the federal funding prohibitions on embryonic stem cell
research.

At stake is billions of dollars in research grants for proponents and, for
opponents, the preservation of a more morally acceptable approach to stem
cell study.

Sean Tipton, president of the Coalition for the Advancement of Medical
Research, has schooled 900 patients who support lifting the restrictions on
how to talk to Hill types about the issue. In addition to training these
foot soldiers for the group of about 100 biotech companies, universities and
patient-advocacy groups, he has met with members of the Senate's freshman
class and their staff to present CAMR's point of view.

To combat the bill, Jennifer Lahl, founder of the campaign Hands Off Our
Ovaries, traveled to the Hill in March to brief congressional staffers on
the dangers women face as egg donors, a practice she and others worry would
explode if funding restrictions are lifted. She's scheduled to speak at a
press conference in town Tuesday.

"I'm not a lobbyist. I don't stand up and tell people how to vote. I'm an
activist," she said. "I want people to have all the information so they can
vote their conscience."

The debate centers on whether the federal government should fund research on
stem cells derived from embryos donated by fertility clinics. The embryos,
castoffs from the clinics, would otherwise be destroyed. The cells are
prized because scientists are learning to program them to become any cell in
the body, a practice that offers the promise of regenerative medicine. And,
supporters say, because embryonic stem cells are blank, they are more
malleable than their more developed brethren.

Because much of the research destroys embryos, anti-abortion groups argue
that taxpayer money should not fund it. They and other critics worry that
the resulting demand for embryos would lead to cloning. Commercialized
cloning, they say, would lead to unprecedented egg harvesting and the
exploitation of women.

The issue first surfaced in 2001, when President Bush limited federal
research funding to the 70 embryonic stem cell lines that had already been
created. Both sides have spent the time since educating lawmakers about the
complex and often emotionally charged issue.

If the bill succeeds, biotech companies and universities could land huge
research grants. The potentially massive cash infusion, supporters say, may
spur innovations that could find cures for diseases such as Parkinson's and
Alzheimer's.

Dorinda Bordlee, executive director of the Bioethics Defense Fund, called
the legislation "a very clever and stealth measure for going to the end game
of human cloning."

Proponents dismiss such talk as scare tactics. Neither the Senate measure
nor its counterpart in the House allows federal money to pay for cloning
research. In fact, they say, federal law already prohibits funding embryo
research.

The scientists, doctors and patients whom both sides have trotted out to
lobby on the Hill are key parts of the push. Michael Werner, a lobbyist for
the biotech trade association BIO, said the strategy is to personalize the
debate. He said he's selling the positive impact the research could have on
patients, not the boon it could provide to the industry.

"What's become clear is that stem cell research -- embryonic stem cell
research particularly -- holds enormous promise for the developments of
medicine," he said.

BIO was one of the founders of CAMR. Tipton, CAMR's president, said his
members aren't looking for a specific amount of federal funding; they want a
chance to compete for a share of the $23 billion in funding the National
Institutes of Health awarded this year.

"The NIH is built on a system where scientific merit drives funding
decisions," he explained. "We're confident that if scientific merit drives
funding decisions, then embryonic stem cell research will have all the money
it needs."

Between 2003 and 2006, the NIH spent $2.3 billion on stem cell research,
$122 million of which went toward work on human embryonic stem cells.
Critics contend that big biotech is working to win taxpayer money for its
embryonic stem cell research to cover a flimsy bet.

"They're coming after government money because embryonic stem cell
(research) is not working," said Charmaine Yoest, vice president for
communications for the Family Research Council.

Officials at the council say that less-destructive research on amniotic
fluid and adult stem cells holds more promise than embryonic stem cells do.

"The American people would be stunned to know how little promise embryonic
stem cell research shows," said Cathy Ruse, a senior fellow at the council.

However, in testimony that created buzz on Capitol Hill last month, NIH
Director Elias Zerhouni disagreed.

"The presentations about adult stem cells having as much or more potential
than embryonic stem cells, in my view, do not hold scientific water," he
told the Senate health appropriations subcommittee. "They are overstated. I
think we do not know at this point where the breakthroughs will come from. I
think scientists who work in adult stem cells themselves will tell you that
we need to pursue as vigorously embryonic stem cells."

It's difficult to track how much lobbyists are spending to peddle their
points, but one barometer is last year's ballot measure in Missouri to
protect embryonic stem cell research. Proponents outspent opponents by about
8 to 1, with total spending hitting the $35 million mark. The measure
squeaked by with 51 percent of the vote.

In Washington, it's beginning to look a lot like Groundhog Day; both sides
say they expect a repeat of last year, when Congress passed the stem cell
bill only to have it earn the president's first and only veto.

Some Democrats said the upside of a veto now is the boost it would give the
issue in the 2008 campaign. Supporters point to lawmakers who voted against
expanded funding of embryonic stem cell research and lost last year's
elections as case studies for why the issue helps Democrats.

Critics don't blame the losses on the stem cell debate. The issue, they
said, doesn't hurt Republicans as much as Democrats think. In fact, Bush's
opposition could fire up the conservative base.

"These are the people who helped elect him to two terms and will help elect
the next Republican president," said a GOP official close to the
administration who requested anonymity because he is not authorized to
discuss political strategy.

In an attempt to compromise, Sen. Norm Coleman (R-Minn.) introduced
legislation that would allow federal funding for embryonic stem cell
research that does not harm embryos. In other words, researchers could use
naturally dead embryos or material from female eggs, said spokesman LeRoy
Coleman (no relation).

No Democrats have co-sponsored the bill. A spokeswoman for Sen. Tom Harkin
(D-Iowa), who is pushing to lift the funding restrictions, said, "(Coleman's
bill) bill doesn't accomplish anything."

If Bush repeats last year's veto, Democrats may attempt to tack the
legislation onto a must-pass appropriations bill, said Rep. Diana DeGette
(D-Colo.), the House bill's sponsor.

"His term will end," DeGette said of Bush. "In January 2009, we will have a
pro-stem-cell president and reverse this decision."

But by then, the FRC says, it hopes to have successfully countered the
left's "disinformation" campaign.

Clearly, both sides have settled in for what could be a long, bruising
battle.

SUPPORTERS

Coalition for the Advancement of Medical Research, Campaign to Defend the
Constitution, Biotechnology Industry Organization

*WHO DOES THE COALITION REPRESENT?*
About 100 member groups, including patient advocacy groups, scientific
organizations and research universities

*LOBBYING MUSCLE*
The coalition said its budget is between $200,000 and $250,000 annually.
Exact figures are difficult to track because of the number of groups and
imprecise reporting requirements. However, last year supporters spent about
$31 million to support a ballot measure that protected embryonic stem cell
research in Missouri.

*ALLIES ON CAPITOL HILL*
Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa)
Sen. Arlen Specter (R-Pa.)
Rep. Diana DeGette (D-Colo.)

*PITCH*
Lifting the funding restrictions on embryonic stem cell research may lead to
cures for diseases such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's. The legislation
would not lift the ban on using taxpayers' money to pay for embryonic
research.

*TACTICS*
•Always speaking as a unified voice of scientists, doctors and patients
•Having scientists and patients brief legislators and staff
•Holding press conferences

OPPONENTS

Family Research Council, Focus on the Family, Hands Off Our Ovaries,
Bioethics Defense Fund

*WHO DO THE GROUPS REPRESENT?*
Mostly conservative, anti-abortion and women's advocacy groups

*LOBBYING MUSCLE*
None of the groups questioned disclosed the amount spent on lobbying. Exact
figures are difficult to track because of the number of groups and imprecise
reporting requirements. However, last year opponents spent about $4 million
to defeat a ballot measure that protected embryonic stem cell research in
Missouri.

*ALLIES ON CAPITOL HILL*
Sen. Norm Coleman (R-Minn.)
Sen. Sam Brownback (R-Kan.)

*PITCH*
Much of embryonic stem cell research destroys live embryos and should not be
funded with taxpayers' money. Gathering embryonic stem cells can require
living embryos, and such a demand means human embryonic cloning is not far
off. Commercialized cloning, critics say, would lead to unprecedented egg
harvesting and the exploitation of women.

*TACTICS*
•Holding briefings, press conferences and personal meetings on the Hill
•Lobbying by patients who have been treated successfully with adult stem
cells
