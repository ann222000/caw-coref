&lt;&lt;Mr./Ms. Singh had posted about a 500 Anniversary Moravian Collectors
&lt;&lt;Plate.
&lt;&lt;If I recall correctly, s/he dated it to 1972.

I am still trying to figure out how these things elicit such heated
exchanges. My sympathies are with Dan and it was clear from the initial
post what had happened. Mr./Mrs. Singh doesn't like being told his/her
things -- while collectible and of interest to him/her -- are not antique
and therefore not suitable fodder for discussion by this group.

It is happening all too often. I wish it would stop and all involved
proceed to their respective corners. It is proving detrimental to the
group... IMHO.

John
