5 -- ROBERT ROODE &amp; MS. BROOKS vs. ERIC YOUNG &amp; GAIL KIM

The action broke down early on, then Young kissed Brooks on the lips. The
heels recovered on the floor, then Young hit a suicide dive on Roode. Gail
followed with a rough plancha on Brooks's face on the floor. Back in the
ring, Gail slammed Brooks into the turnbuckles. Gail then squared off with
Roode, who took a tag. Gail landed a forearm blow, then tagged in Young, who
worked on Roode until Brooks tripped Young from behind. She then rammed
Young crotch-first into the ringpost. The heels took control and exchanged
tags working on Young. Brooks missed a corner clothesline, then Young made
the hot tag to Gail, who cleaned house. She then went up top for a
huracanrana on Roode, but Roode sat down on a Boston Crab. Young made the
save, though, with a DDT. The women brawled in the ring and Gail hit a top
rope missile dropkick. Gail then used Roode against Brooks before teaming up
with Young for a double dropkick on Roode. Gail made the cover on Brooks for
the win.

Afterward, Roode snapped and threw a chair around ringside. He chased the
faces from ringside. Roode then screamed at Brooks for screwing everything
up. She left the ring after being slapped a few times, then Young became
quite concerned. He ran back into the ring from behind and pansted Roode,
revealing a thong. Young then ran back out of the ring to avoid Roode's
wrath. The fans laughed at Roode while Brooks backed away from ringside.

WINNERS: Young &amp; Gail in 9:00. Another Roode vs. Young match and another
Young victory. Time to move on. Good action with the crowd into the story.
(*3/4)

Backstage, Borash interviewed Christian Cage with Styles and Tomko. He
talked about his match against Chris Harris. Christian said he's been on top
since the day he walked through the door. He said he has everything a
wrestler needs to be a top star in the business. Christian said there's room
for only one leading man in TNA. Styles was concerned while Tomko was
annoyed. Christian said Styles has potential. Tomko grabbed Styles by the
shirt and told them they have a match tonight. Angle interrupted and said he
needs to talk to Christian. He said his partner, Joe, is out to get him and
he needs help. Christian said they have their own problems to deal with, so
no can do. Christian led his boys away.

Sonjay Dutt interrupted all smiles with a tambourine. He asked for a
donation to a virus in Africa. Angle told him not to smile at him. Dutt kept
smiling, then Angle screamed at him that if he wasn't in TNA, there would be
TNA, which means Dutt wouldn't have a job. Dutt said the old Sonjay would
have thought of that as a threat of violence, but not anymore. He pitched
for a donation, then Angle took off his sunglasses and grabbed the
tambourine. He teased giving a donation before slamming it over Dutt's head.
He then chucked him into a locker and landed right hand blows while saying
here...is...your...donation...you...stupid...bastard. Hilarious and great
all at the same time. Angle then left after leaving Dutt KO'ed on the floor.

They aired a video package on Chris Harris.
