How to replace old coax wire to my antenna?

I what to replace my old rg-59 coax wire with a RG-6 wire.   I now
have a high deff tv and hoping to get more than just 6 channels
hdtv.   From what I am told I should be able to get about 13 channels
from Buffalo to where I live in st catharines (CANADA).    I have been
told that a high deff antenna might not be any better then my tower
antenna (mounted to our house).    The wiring could be original
35years old (not sure).   So I want to first try new wiring, before I
go and buy a Channel master antenna.   I will need new wiring anyways,
if I get a new antenna.

So I climbed up to the peak of our tower antenna to see what the
connection looks like.   It's an odd looking connection, with two
wires sticking out.    I would easily get new wire, but that sure what
this kind of connections is called or where to buy one, or how to
connect it to the end of my coax.    Here is a picture of the end of
my coax wire.    Thank.

p.s. I have a second coax wire going to my antenna that controls the
antenna rotator.   Is there any need to change the wiring to it
(rg-6)?   It rotates just fine for now.

The two wires you are looking at are from a coaxial transformer.
It changes 300 ohm wire to 75 ohm coaxial. You should replace it
and the coaxial with rg6. The other cable that controls the rotor
shouldn't be coaxial, but I suppose it should work. Normally it
is three or four wire cable.

If your antenna is held together with rusty rivets you are probably not
getting all the possible signal into the coax. Rust and oxidized
elements are not the best conductors. The plastic mounts holding
everything together are probably brittle and prone to failure.

If you really want to do it right replace the antenna and coax before
the first snow.

Any grounding on that antenna and mast ?

The antenna looks worse than the coax, which appears to be RG6 (never seen
white RG59).
What you don't see is a 75:300 Ohm balun that is taped over. It has pigtails
on the antenna side that connect to screw terminals on the antenna, and an F
connector on the coax side. Replace that, making sure it is meant for
outdoor use.

According to the latest FCC info, all 7 Buffalo DT stations will be on UHF.
Don't know about other towns in the area.

Others have told you about the antenna connection so I'll just comment on
the stations you can get. Antenna direction has a lot to do with the
signal you receive. Especially with the yagi style antenna you have.
There appears to be 6 local stations in your city, so the direction to
get them would not matter a lot within 10 miles. But to get the ones from
Buffalo and Toronto it will matter. You aren't that far from either of
them so I'd try one CM4221 first since it's cheap (about $20). and if
that doesn't get all or enough of them I'd add a second, pointing one to
Buffalo's towers and the other towards Toronto's towers. Mount them over
and under and it shouldn't be a problem. Just reverse a splitter to tie
them together.

I guess I never bought RG59 in a junk store. It also looks too thick. Real
RG59 is .242 OD.

NO, Don't do that. Use your rotator. You can only combine2 antennas if one
is UHF and the other VHF.

RG-6 is better for longer runs and problems with interference (i.e. motor
noise) getting into the cable (better shielding). It is also a higher
bandwidth cable with significantly lower cable loss at the higher
frequencies of cable TV and satellite feeds.

That said RG-59 that is in good shape (not cracked etc) should be fully
satisfactory for feeding from an antenna (VHF and UHF).

Most Digital TV's have the ability to display signal strength. If the
strength on ALL the digital channels that you can find is low or medium then
you might consider a 'in line' amplifier, they are cheap and easy to
install. It consists of two parts one part downstream is a power supply and
what is called a DC block. It is installed and attached to the antenna cable
before any splitters or any other amplifiers or filters. This unit has a DC
power supply and an adapter between the antenna cable and the rest of your
distribution system. This keeps the DC voltage out of your TV's etc. Up at
the antenna end there is a small unit that either replaces the round 75 ohm
to 300 ohm adapter shown in your picture (wrapped in black plastic) or is
between the cable and the adapter. You would want one for 'antennas' not for
cable TV or satellite TV. Antenna ones are built for the smaller bandwidth
of over the air TV and have a larger dynamic range (works with weak and
strong signals better).
If you have some chanels that are very strong, then the in-line amplifier
may be a bad idea as that channel could overload creating all sorts of
problems on that channel and others.

If your antenna is in good shape (no broken/bent elements) I would simply
check the connections for corrosion and inspect the balun (the coax to two
wire thing) for cracking etc. (BTW balun is short for  coax
BAlenced/UNbalenced two wire). The terms HDTV and digital as applied to
antennas is marketing hype. Almost all the digital channels are at UHF
frequencies and the antenna/cable cannot tell the difference between a UHF
with digital on it from one with analogue on it.

I suppose that an antenna rotor could be controlled by a coax cable but I
doubt it. Usually a multiconductor cable is required (5 wires seems common),
can be round of course.

I don't want to get technical, but signals have a wave length.  Think of a
sine wave with peaks and dips.  If you join two signals from the same
station together and they are out of phase, they will cancel signal rather
than add together. At any one split second if one is at a peak and the other
is negative and they are joined, they subtract, you get the drift? You need
to join the two antennas with, and I forget in my old age, either a 1/4 0r
1/2 wave length connection and take the signal from the middle of the
connection. That way the two signals when joined are in phase with each
other. I haven't worked on Antennas for 40 years but I'm sure there must be
some experts in this thread who know the best way to connect two antennas
together.  I know just randomly connecting two together with a splicer has a
high chance of decreasing the signal, not improving it.

In the old days people would put different lengths of foil on flat lead to
phase them.  Sometimes they were successful.  Or they could snip off 1/2
inch at a time on one lead until they were in phase.  On coax that could
drive a guy to drink.

Stacking two identical antennas that are pointed in the same direction is a
different thing. If the two antennas are pointed in different directions,
the one that is pointed off the station that you are watching will pick up
extra noise, reflections, and possibly co channel interference.

the risk of cancellation due to 180 degree out of phase signals is minimal.
the more real problem in the good old days was multipath, giving ghosting
and other issues on analog signals.  This is not an issue with digital
signals (okay, theoretically it could be, but realistically it's not)

Are you saying digital signals are not (realistically) subject to multipath?

Only gives Canadian stations I think. If you want the us stations in

Radio shack, or about any electronics place I'd imagine. On-line you can
get everything you need from here, but I don't know where in Canada. Most
CM antennas come with the balun (transformer).

&gt; I don't want to get technical, but signals have a wave length.  Think of
&gt; a sine wave with peaks and dips.  If you join two signals from the same
&gt; station together and they are out of phase, they will cancel signal
&gt; rather than add together. At any one split second if one is at a peak
&gt; and the other is negative and they are joined, they subtract, you get
&gt; the drift? You need to join the two antennas with, and I forget in my
&gt; old age, either a 1/4 0r 1/2 wave length connection and take the signal
&gt; from the middle of the connection. That way the two signals when joined
&gt; are in phase with each other. I haven't worked on Antennas for 40 years
&gt; but I'm sure there must be some experts in this thread who know the best
&gt; way to connect two antennas together.  I know just randomly connecting
&gt; two together with a splicer has a high chance of decreasing the signal,
&gt; not improving it.
">

I thought it would be obvious, but when connecting antennas, they should
all go to the main connector using the same length of cable for each
antenna. IOW's to connect 2 antennas together use 2 cables of the same
length going to the combiner (reversed splitter).

A technique that's working well for me:

Out local stations are located on two different mountaintops, about
110 degrees apart in azimuth.  There is minimal terrain to cause
multi-path signals.

I bought two UHF antennas (each multiple bow-ties) and aimed one to each
of the two mountains.  Then, connected the two antennas together using a
couple of feet (didn't bother to calculate an optimal length) of twisted
300 ohm twinlead.  Connected the balun to the lower antenna to &quot;match&quot;
the antennas to the RG-6.  (Yeah, I know it's an ugly mismatch.)

I was surprised that it worked quite well.  Scrapped the rotator.  ATSC
is remarkable and cleans up crap that would make for a poor picture in
NTSC.

If you've got a serious multi-path issue YMMV.

You can get lucky and have it work, but it won't in the general case. I know
of only one antenna like that which was ever sold, and the secondary antenna
was meant for reflection cancellation. You pointed it at the reflection, and
turned a knob to minimize it.. The 8 bay does not count, because all 8
antennas are pointed in the same direction.

My rg-59 wire is not cracked and in great condition.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; RG-6 is better for longer runs and problems with interference (i.e. motor
&gt; noise) getting into the cable (better shielding). It is also a higher
&gt; bandwidth cable with significantly lower cable loss at the higher
&gt; frequencies of cable TV and satellite feeds.

&gt; That said RG-59 that is in good shape (not cracked etc) should be fully
&gt; satisfactory for feeding from an antenna (VHF and UHF).
&gt; Most Digital TV's have the ability to display signal strength. If the
&gt; strength on ALL the digital channels that you can find is low or medium then
&gt; you might consider a 'in line' amplifier, they are cheap and easy to
&gt; install. It consists of two parts one part downstream is a power supply and
&gt; what is called a DC block. It is installed and attached to the antenna cable
&gt; before any splitters or any other amplifiers or filters. This unit has a DC
&gt; power supply and an adapter between the antenna cable and the rest of your
&gt; distribution system. This keeps the DC voltage out of your TV's etc. Up at
&gt; the antenna end there is a small unit that either replaces the round 75 ohm
&gt; to 300 ohm adapter shown in your picture (wrapped in black plastic) or is
&gt; between the cable and the adapter. You would want one for 'antennas' not for
&gt; cable TV or satellite TV. Antenna ones are built for the smaller bandwidth
&gt; of over the air TV and have a larger dynamic range (works with weak and
&gt; strong signals better).
&gt; If you have some chanels that are very strong, then the in-line amplifier
&gt; may be a bad idea as that channel could overload creating all sorts of
&gt; problems on that channel and others.

&gt; If your antenna is in good shape (no broken/bent elements) I would simply
&gt; check the connections for corrosion and inspect the balun (the coax to two
&gt; wire thing) for cracking etc. (BTW balun is short for  coax
&gt; BAlenced/UNbalenced two wire). The terms HDTV and digital as applied to
&gt; antennas is marketing hype. Almost all the digital channels are at UHF
&gt; frequencies and the antenna/cable cannot tell the difference between a UHF
&gt; with digital on it from one with analogue on it.

&gt; I suppose that an antenna rotor could be controlled by a coax cable but I
&gt; doubt it. Usually a multiconductor cable is required (5 wires seems common),
&gt; can be round of course.

The best RG-59 is Belden 1505 which might outperform poorer grade
RG-6. The best RG6 is Belden 1694. Both of these use gas injected foam
center insulator. Older coax may have solid poly center insulation.
While the poly is harder to deform (squash), the losses are
considerably higher. If the signal is solid with the old coax and it
isn't brittle or cracking, it can stay even if it's solid poly. Loss
is by cable length so a short length of mediocre cable will be better
than a long run of the best cable.

Depending on the preamp manufacturer, the preamp power might be going
up the coax as DC or 60 Hz AC, neither of which will bother the RF
with the internal filters.

In LA the air is salty near the ocean and antennas (Winegards for
sure)  last about 15 years. The corrosion can be a big factor. I
bought a mid range Winegard HD7082 UHF/VHF last month for $115. Others
swear by Channel Master but I'm a Winegard guy. At our house I have a
SquareShooter which doesn't look like an antenna and is allowed under
any home owners associations and works very well for UHF at 35 miles
out.

The line match transformer is called a Balun for BALanced/UNbalanced.
Prices range from less than a buck upward. $3-$5 is about right.

Antennas come in flavours of VHF and UHF andwith differing gains.  There
is no such thing as a specifidally &quot;hi-def&quot; antenna.  Replacing that old
RG59 with new satellite-grade RG6 will likely improve things a bunch,
though.  If the run is long, a good mast'head preamp might be in order.

Not sure what I'm seeing here.  Most older TV antennas have a balanced
300-ohm feed.  To feed one of these properly. you need a 4:1 balun
transformer to step this down to an unbalanced 75-ohm coax.  These
usually sport a two-wire feedon the 300 ohm side and a standard F
connector on the other. They are a small barrel-shaped device and
qualities vary from outright fake to decent air-wound high-efficiency.
Some of your better mast-head preamps have a 300 ohm balanced input and
coax output with an isolator at the TV end to allow the pre-amp to get
its DC power over the same coaxas the feed.

If the screws where the leads for the balum are rusted plus where they screw

The Radio shack is OK, I have used it myself. The 10 DB is not much and it
is really designed for cable.

Channel master makes a couple of lines, The spartan 3 and the Channel Max
lines. These are more expensive but higher capability. For instance if your
have strong local FM stations then the FM traps included in the Channel
master units are very advantageous. These lines have 300 (the two wire)
inputs and outputs of 75 Ohm (the Coax) so the balun is not necessary, one
less thing to corrode.

They all need AC power at the bottom of the cable run.

They all have 75 ohm output so can use  either rg-59 or rg-6, they cannot
tell the difference. I think most everyone would suggest new installations
of rg-6, however pulling out good rg-59 to replace it with rg-6 would not
get as universal recommendations.

The end connection thingy is called a 75 ohm 300 ohm balun .

Cleaning up the antenna connections would certainly be a first fix.

Rust and corrosion may also pose an 'interference' issue in a 'fringe'
location.

Cheap aluminum contains some magnesium that speeds corrosion of the
elements, particularly where the elements are riveted to insulators and
the antenna frame.  Ferrous rivets rust and also form bi-metalic
corrosion where they contact aluminum parts.  (Same situation may exist
where copper wires connect to antenna elements made of aluminum.)

Many of these corrosion points (particularly the bi-metals) are
semiconductors (think diodes) that can cause strong local signals to mix
or intermodulate with the distant TV signals.  Punchline -- over time,
an antenna becomes an interference producer.

I'm a mile from the ocean (corrosion issue) and have several radio
amateurs in my neighborhood (strong signals).  I have to replace our
outdoor antenna every three or four years--.  Good news is that ATSC
signals seem far less affected by this type of interference than did NTSC.

&gt; The end connection thingy is called a 75 ohm 300 ohm balun .

&gt;&gt; I saw this one at radioshack website http://shortlink.co.uk/p4n It
&gt;&gt; supposedly only works with rg-6 wire.
&gt;&gt; is this the kind you would recommend?

&gt;&gt; And yes my rivets on the antenna are rusted, could that be the cause

&gt;&gt; My rg-59 wire is not cracked and in great condition.

&gt;&gt; And where can I buy one of those ohms transformer end connections?
&gt;&gt; What is the proper term, so I can do a search on googles or ebay.

&gt;&gt; thanks.

&gt;&gt;&gt; RG-6 is better for longer runs and problems with interference (i.e.
&gt;&gt;&gt; motor
&gt;&gt;&gt; noise) getting into the cable (better shielding). It is also a higher
&gt;&gt;&gt; bandwidth cable with significantly lower cable loss at the higher
&gt;&gt;&gt; frequencies of cable TV and satellite feeds.

&gt;&gt;&gt; That said RG-59 that is in good shape (not cracked etc) should be fully
&gt;&gt;&gt; satisfactory for feeding from an antenna (VHF and UHF).

&gt;&gt;&gt; Most Digital TV's have the ability to display signal strength. If the
&gt;&gt;&gt; strength on ALL the digital channels that you can find is low or
&gt;&gt;&gt; medium then
&gt;&gt;&gt; you might consider a 'in line' amplifier, they are cheap and easy to
&gt;&gt;&gt; install. It consists of two parts one part downstream is a power
&gt;&gt;&gt; supply and
&gt;&gt;&gt; what is called a DC block. It is installed and attached to the

You need to replace that antenna,,,looks like you live somewhere that
has some weather.!!!!

also replace the matching transformer,and the connector on the coax.

Replacing the RG 59 with RG 6 will not make much difference, as the
OTA frequencies are well within the RG 59 capabilities. If the cable
is worn, then by all means replace it with RG 6, doesn't cost much
extra.

The rotor issue doesn't effect the signal to your TV - if it works
leave it.

No

A lighting rods function is not to &quot;attract lighting&quot; - no conductor
made by man could survive a direct lighting strike.

A lighting rod is suppose to make the top of your house, or barn,
appear to the clouds as if it was not the &quot;least resistant&quot; path to
ground, aka directing the strike to the next least resistant path.

Yours is a common miss conception about how the Franklin lighting rods
work. They do not &quot;attract&quot; the lighting, they make the top of the
building, or antenna in this case, look to the potential difference
between the cloud and the ground, like it was right at the ground -
vastly reducing the possiblity that the bolt will discharge to your
house.

Just prior to a lightning hit, an ionized charged path is created in

lightning.
If you can suck off that charge into the earth via a good grounding

Well, not true.  Many people put up towers that are struck frequently by
lightning, and they survive just fine.

The wimpy grounds that people put on their TV receive antennas generally
are not adequate for the task.

Not quite.  It may bleed off charge for the area, but if the stepped

Making a high point have the same potential as the ground will increase
the chance that the arc occurs there.  Not by much, given the small distance
involved, but it will increase it.

There is a good reason why the advice for a person caught out in the open
with lightning striking in the area is NOT to stand tall with their hands
in the air.

My antenna got hit twice in one year when it was grounded, litterally
blowing up one TV's crt while I was watching it. I decided to never ground
another antenna. Care to guess how many times I've been hit since then?
Zero. I removed the ground in 1969. All the theories in the world won't
convince me that grounding an antenna won't attract lightning.

electrical potential will seek the least resistant path to ground.
Grounding the antenna will make it no more likely to be struck than

What it may do however is help bleed off static charges that *might*
reach sufficiently high voltage to damage sensitive tuner components.

That said, I've never bothered grounding any antenna.  I live in a

&gt;&gt;No

&gt;&gt;A lighting rods function is not to &quot;attract lighting&quot; - no conductor
&gt;&gt;made by man could survive a direct lighting strike.

&gt;  Well, not true.  Many people put up towers that are struck frequently by
&gt;lightning, and they survive just fine.

&gt;  The wimpy grounds that people put on their TV receive antennas generally
&gt;are not adequate for the task.

&gt;&gt;A lighting rod is suppose to make the top of your house, or barn,
&gt;&gt;appear to the clouds as if it was not the &quot;least resistant&quot; path to
&gt;&gt;ground, aka directing the strike to the next least resistant path.

&gt;  Not quite.  It may bleed off charge for the area, but if the stepped
&gt;leader hits the corona above it, you have a strike.

&gt;&gt;Yours is a common miss conception about how the Franklin lighting rods
&gt;&gt;work. They do not &quot;attract&quot; the lighting, they make the top of the
&gt;&gt;building, or antenna in this case, look to the potential difference
&gt;&gt;between the cloud and the ground, like it was right at the ground -
&gt;&gt;vastly reducing the possiblity that the bolt will discharge to your
&gt;&gt;house.

&gt;  Making a high point have the same potential as the ground will increase
&gt;the chance that the arc occurs there.  Not by much, given the small distance
&gt;involved, but it will increase it.

&gt;  There is a good reason why the advice for a person caught out in the open
&gt;with lightning striking in the area is NOT to stand tall with their hands
&gt;in the air.

No

making the high point the same potential difference as the ground will
lower the chance of a direct strike. It is indeed still possible you
could get hit, but your chance wqould be no greater than the ground
around you.

Antenna towers can be designed to survive a lighting strike, but they
are not designed to attract lighting,,,quite the opposite.  It is
almost impossible to ground a 200 ft plus structure well enough to
completely eliminate the chance of a direct strike, the resistance of
the tower metal itself floats it slightly above ground potential.

Unfortunately Wes I have lost track of the number of physical science
facts that you will not believe.

You just need to Google to learn,,,

Grounding your antenna had nothing to do with your being struck by
lightning - in fact since you are still alive and posting, most likely
you were zapped by a seondary local static discharge, and the ground
connection saved your life.

If you had been hit by lighting, you would have been melted along with
your TV.

All outside antennas need to be earth grounded, all the Sat providers
do it, and its recklessly foolish to be telling people to not to do it
- your going to cost somebody thier life.

You are full of crap. I didn't give any logic in my response. I only gave
my experiences. But if you want logic, let's look at it. lightning, being
nothing but electricity follows some physical rules. One of these rules is
that it will take the path of less resistance to an oppositely charged
conductor. A grounded antenna offers a solid 0 ohm resistance to earth
ground since you've driven a copper rod 6 feet or more into the ground and
connected it to your antenna. An ungrounded antenna doesn't stand up there
and yell here I am, big solid ground just for you big boy. Come get it,
I'll dissipate every electron you have. No, an ungrounded antenna sits up
there hiding it's ground potential from the lightning, and a cloud going
over with an opposite charge is less likely to see your ungrounded
antenna. So it may dissipate itself into a light pole, grounded power
transformer, tree, something else, or even another oppositely charged
cloud with less resistance. The only reason to ground an antenna is to
give the lightning a direct path to ground to dissipate itself. It's
thought that this makes people and equipment safer when the antenna takes
a hit, diverting the main charge to the ground through the ground wire.
That certainly makes sense. But in fact, it's really not much help at all.
A lightning strike is so powerful that when it hits the antenna it will
disperse on every wire connected to it and even jump to other conductors
and continue on down until it's hit enough to absorb its full potential.

That's not even a close analogy. But what it does prove is that if you
don't stop at stop signs you are less likely to be rear ended. And if you
don't ground your antenna, it's less likely to be struck by lightning.
Which was the whole point. Thanks for agreeing.:-)

Yep. Great if you own a multi million dollar station.:-)

A grounded antenna is nothing more than a lightning rod by another name.
Electricity 101. That's probably not totally true as most grounded home
antennas don't have the capacity to dissipate a lightning strike, thus
making them worse than no ground at all.

As he noted, Wes provides no logic for his conclusions. His own post
completely contradicts science applied to a Nebraska radio station.
Posted by others are facts based in 100 years of knowledge.  If not
properly grounded, then lightning will still strike anyway - and take
more destructive paths to earth.  Its seeking that earth with or
without proper earthing.  Wes' recommendation means lighting damage.

Lightning travels three miles to get there - to obtain that earth
ground.  Either it will use the most conductive path via the earth
ground (proper earthing), or it will take more destructive and less
conductive paths to the same earth location.  But that current must
flow through something.  Wes says if the antenna is not grounded, then
that lightning will not occur.  Lightning wants earth beneath that
building and antenna.  Lightning will strike something no matter how
much Wes speculates.

Removing ground rods does not reduce the number of strikes.
Lightning will strike whether properly grounded or not.  Without
proper grounding, then less lightning energy is dissipated in earth
AND more energy is dissipated destructively in household appliances,
building materials, etc.  With proper earthing, it is routine to have
direct lightning strikes and no damage.

No numbers?  Four letter words?  Both demonstrate Wes Newell failed
to first learn the science - but automatically knows.

Wes even perverts science into some 'black and white' distortion:

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; ... of course every homeowner can afford to spend

">

6 AWG wire is more than sufficient.  10 foot earth ground rods
provide a massive improvement for lightning protection.  Same wire and
ground rod as required by code.  Wes posts in direct contradiction
even to what Ben Franklin demonstrated in 1752. - because speculation
becomes fact.  Wes did not (could not) provide a single engineering
number.  But in a black and white world, numbers and science only get
in the way.

Wes Newell's logic also proves running stop signs are safer.

Eliminate both damage and threats to human life by earthing the
antenna.  That is obvious even from science 100 years ago.
Speculation is not fact where people do this for a living.  Oh.  Did
Wes forget to mention that earthing is also required by code?  What's
a few more facts when the word 'crap' proves everything?

&gt;&gt; One of these rules is that it will take the path of less resistance to
&gt;&gt; an oppositely charged conductor. ... an ungrounded antenna sits up

No it doesn't. There is little to no similarity to a TV antenna on a house
and a 500' transmission tower. Even the links you provided clearly showed
using a separate lightning rod above the transmission antenna. And
grounding of the tower itself. Nothing to do with with a simple TV antenna
on a house.

Not reading the rest of your crap. Wasted too much time on your BS already.

Translation:  Wes Newell has no technical knowledge.  He cannot
dispute the industry professional's Nebraska radio station example.
So he posts insults - and no numbers.

Posts from Wes Newell should be evaluated with care. Too many just
know without first learning the technology.  No numbers is a first
indication of no technical grasp.  Insults only confirm it.

And I didn't you idiot. It just has no meaning for the discussion of home
antennas.

So insults confirm that a person has no technical abilities. That makes
perfect sense, coming from an idiot like you.:-)

And it appears I'm not alone. A quick google search for w_tom finds things
like this;

yep w_tom is still full of CRAP !!!!       Group:  aus.electronics

Have a nice day.

If your TV was struck by lightning twice, it was not because your
antenna was grounded.  It was because your antenna was grounded
INCORRECTLY.

First, the &quot;antenna&quot; should not be grounded.  The MAST should be
grounded.

Second, a lightning suppressor is required in the antenna feed close to
the point where the coax enters your house.

The idea is to make the *mast* more attractive to lightning than the
&quot;antenna&quot; by providing a better mast-to-ground path than an
antenna-through-tuner-to-ground path.

The antenna mounts to the mast. If the mast is grounded, the antenna is
grounded. The idea of the ground is to provide a better path to ground
through the ground wire. The point is, it doesn't matter. If lightning
hits your antenna (or mast) it will disperse everywhere there is a ground,
and that includes the lead to your equipment. The direct ground provides a
low resistance attraction for lightning. IOW's, making it more likely to
attract lightning than an ungrounded antenna. Yes, the purpose of the
ground is to try and keep the lightning from coming down the antenna lead
but it won't do it in normal antenna installations. If you want that to
happen, you'll need to do more than just ground the antenna.
