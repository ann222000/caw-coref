Beware of Mullahs Bearing Gifts

by Amil Imani

30 Mar, 2007

Iran's mullahs have repeatedly indicated their willingness and ability to
help restore order in Iraq, on the condition that the United States packs up
and leaves the region. The mullahs have also pledged on their Boy Scout's
honor, although they have never been Boy Scouts, that their nuclear program
is strictly for peaceful purposes. As a further gesture of goodwill, these
self-appointed custodians of Allah's earth are volunteering to serve as
unpaid policemen of the entire Gulf region, protecting vital U.S. interests,
just like the Shah did before them. Sounds like a great gift package from
the kind-hearted do-gooders of Allah.

Beware of mullahs bearing gifts! The mullahs are diehard adherents of the
Islamists' eleventh commandment "Thou shall not lie or dissimilate
(tagyyeh), deceive or cheat (ketman) unless they serve a higher purpose."
And to these devoted faithful, there is no higher purpose in the world than
serving Allah's biding, as they like it and as they interpret it.

Keep in mind that the very name "Islam" means "submission," unquestioning
submission to the will of Allah.

Qur'an 33:36, "It is not fitting for a Muslim man or woman to have any
choice in their affairs when a matter has been decided for them by Allah and
His Messenger. They have no option."

And in the Quran itself, Allah gives these fellows their mandate: Cleanse
the earth from all kuffar (infidels), and help usher in the golden rule of
Islam over a corrupt world. This high-purpose strategic goal of Islamization
legitimizes any and all tactics.

Qur'an 8:39 "Fight them until all opposition ends and all submit to Allah."

Allah, in his kindness, leaves a bit of wiggle room for the unbelievers.
Those who refuse to convert or whose life is spared may live under the rule
of Islam by paying poll taxes.

Qur'an 9:29, "Fight those who do not believe until they all surrender,
paying the protective tax in submission."

These men of Allah are urged to use every "stratagem of war," to kill and
take the disbelievers as captives. The ones they do not kill, mostly women
and children, they take as booties of war and slaves. These devotees of
Allah have been and continue to be among the most persistent practitioners
of slavery.

Qur'an 9:5, "Fight and kill the disbelievers wherever you find them, take
them captive, harass them, lie in wait and ambush them using every stratagem
of war."

"Every stratagem," means every stratagem. No heinous act is out of bounds
for these savages. They place children, for instance, in the backseat of a
car bomb so that it could be waved through checkpoints without inspection.
Then, the adults park the car in the midst of a shopping crowd, run out of
the car and detonate it with the children inside. Horrific? Shocking?
Absolutely barbaric? These are the same people who used thousands of Iranian
children as minesweepers during the Iran-Iraq war to clear a path for their
more valued armored vehicles.

And as for Iran's mullahs' unyielding drive to acquire the ultimate weapon,
it is in obedience to the command of the Quran. And "terrorism," abhorrent
to the civilized world, is explicitly enjoined on the faithful.

Qur'an 8:59 "The infidels should not think that they can get away from us.
Prepare against them whatever arms and weaponry you can muster so that you
may terrorize them. They are your enemy and Allah's enemy."

And for those who advocate retreating to the safety of "fortress America,"
the following warning should dispel their vain hope. Europe is already
partly invaded, and America and other infidel lands are next.

Qur'an 13:41 "Do they not see us advancing from all sides into the land (of
the disbelievers), reducing its borders (by giving it to believers in war
victories).

It is worse than appeasement to negotiate a "deal" with the Iranian
theocrats because any deal struck with these mullahs is only another ruse
for them to further their plans. The UN resolutions are nothing more than
pieces of paper good for fire, they can pass them all they want, president
Ahmadinejad proclaims belligerently. These Islamists go by their
1400-year-old charter of Allah, the Qur'an the same charter that they hold
in one hand while slashing the throat of an innocent infidel and yelling
joyously "Allah is the greatest" the whole time.

To the misguided "Supreme Guide," mullah Ali Khamenei of Iran, a few words
are in order. The civilized Iranians, descendants of Cyrus the Great, find
you, mulla Ali, and your cabal of Islamists guilty of heinous crimes. A
partial list of charges is given below.

Domestically

* You do not represent the Iranian people. You are a usurper of power. You
are guilty of transforming a noble nation into a world pariah.

* You are denying and violating a long-suffering people all its human
rights.

* You are guilty of beating, imprisoning and torturing a few dozen women who
braved participating in a peaceful demonstration pleading for equal family
rights, on the recent International Day of Women.

* You systematically beat, imprison, and torture all manners of citizens,
from school teachers to students to union workers, for daring to raise their
voices against the plight to which you have subjected them.

* You savagely beat and haul to your dungeons of torture and death over a
thousand of the tens of thousands of teachers who had recently gathered in
front of the parliament requesting nothing more than their back pay and
living wages.

* You direct systematic genocidal measures against all non-Shia religious
minorities, with Baha'is as prime target.

* You arrest some Christians, even your Quran calls "People of the Book,"
for observing Christmas.

* You implement barbaric practices of stoning, hanging and amputations for
those who are convicted of crimes in your kangaroo courts without due
process. You even imprison those few lawyers who rise in the defense of the
innocent.

* You plunder, mismanage and dole out Iran's national wealth with the result
that the great majority of the people are living in poverty. Iranian women
are forced into prostitution to survive or simply sold as sex slaves in
Persian Gulf states.

* Your fascist misrule of nearly three decades has driven millions of Iran's
best children to four corners of the world. Hundreds of thousands of
educated Iranians are compelled to continue the exodus, depriving Iran of
the sorely-needed talents at home.

* You spend a fortune on the nuclear program that you claim is only aimed
for peaceful purposes, while turning Iran into little more than a gas
station nation, with its precious oil wealth squandered and its facilities
on the verge of collapse through neglect.

* You have created a suffocating social atmosphere that has driven masses of
the people to the use of hard drugs as a way of numbing their pain.

Internationally

* You look far and wide to support any and all terrorists. Your delusional
theology mandates the creation of horrific conditions in the world so that
your Hidden Imam is compelled to appear and establish his rule.

* You spare no efforts at sabotaging any settlement between the Palestinians
and Israelis. You arm and train all Palestinian factions such as Hamas,
Islamic Jihad, and any and all that come.

* You direct similar criminal schemes on your eastern flank, in Afghanistan.
You consider any democratic system as the enemy of Islamofascism, and
rightfully so.

* You work ceaselessly, expand Iran's stolen funds, and do all you can in
support of your Shia co-fascists Hezbollah in Lebanon.

* Your hands are dripping with the blood of thousands of Iraqis, victims of
your bloodthirsty kin mercenaries aiming to kill a budding democracy in Iraq
next door.

* You supply your mercenaries with armor-piercing projectiles for killing
and maiming the coalition forces in Iraq. Your cowardly killing by proxy,
using these roadside planted bombs, has taken the lives of nearly 200
Americans.

* You interpret the highly subdued reactions of the coalition to your savage
actions as indications of weakness. So, you find it in yourself to venture
into direct confrontation by capturing lightly-armed British sailors and
marines in Iraqi waters.

Misguided advocates of negotiation with the mullahs, beware. The mullahs are
on an Allah-mandated mission. They are intoxicated with Petrodollars and aim
to settle for nothing less than complete domination of the world under the
Islamic ummeh. It is precisely for this reason that they consider America
and the West as "Ofooli," setting-dying system, while they believe their
Islamism as "Tolooi," rising-living order. They are in no mood of
negotiating for anything less than the total surrender of democracy, the
very anathema to Islamism.

And to you, the misguided mullah Ali Khamenei, don't be fooled by the
sycophants who misinform you. Don't threaten the West by either
as-yet-to-come online nuclear weapons or your fantasized sleeper cells. You
will be terribly disappointed when Iranian expatriates everywhere will be
among the very first to help the authorities find your sleeper cells, if any
actually exist, and put them into permanent sleep.

Freedom may suffer retreats periodically and tyranny may advance
occasionally. Yet, free people everywhere will meet any challenge and pay
any price to safeguard the precious treasure of freedom for themselves and
the finest bequeath they can leave for the next generation.
