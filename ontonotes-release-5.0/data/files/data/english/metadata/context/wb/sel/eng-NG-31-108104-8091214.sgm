Persia is getting older (8-10, don't really know).  I'm trying to get her to
play more.  She's become very sedentary but she needs the exercise *and* the
mental stimulation.  She still occasionally plays with the BIG crinkly mylar
balls (all the small ones have vanished into the ether), empty toilet paper
rolls, soft furry mousies.  (The &quot;mouse&quot; both Victor and I have, with the
velcro closure that you fill with catnip, she just licks to death LOL)  She
loses interest in the laser pointer after just a few minutes these days.

Anyway, I want to find some sort of toys that will stimulate her to play
more.  I've heard a lot about &quot;cat dancers&quot; and the like.  I DO NOT want
anything that requires batteries.  I'm pretty sure those round things with
the balls they bat around inside would bore her to tears and be a waste of
money.  Also, I have had rattle mousies with feather tails but she just rips
the feathers off and then loses all interest.

Any recommendations for some inexpensive cat toys that might stimulate her?
I got a little 'pin money' for my birthday and would like to spend some of
it on my precious Persia :)

How about one of those long wands with various attachment options, kinda
like this:

Have you tried a Play-n-Squeak mouse (also available in other
configurations, such an adorable hedgehog)?  There are no batteries, but the
mouse &quot;squeaks&quot; like a little mouse when it hits the floor, whether thrown
or batted around.  I have a couple of them plus one that is on a wand that I
can bounce along the floor.

Duffy loves the Turbo Scratcher, but that may be the toy that you said would
bore Persia.  Duffy will jump back and forth over it, batting the ball first
in one direction and then the other.  He even sleeps on the round scratcher
in the center!

Uh...oh.  I was wrong...the play-n-squeak toy *does* have a battery (and I
should have realized it).  However, I have had the three I described for a
couple of years and they still squeak--no change of batteries.

Get her a feather-on-a-stick... I thought that it would be beneath my
girls' notice so I never got them one - but when we did it was
immediately their most favourite toy on the planet. And it REALLY gets
them all moving trying to catch it (even though they're usually
extremely sedentary...) They like their cat-dancer too, and their
pompom toy, but the feather-on-a-stick is by far their favourite. (and
it's not very expensive because the toys are interchangeable so when
the feather gets wrecked you can just clip a new one on and start over
without having to replace the whole wand.)

This is the feather wand we got them...

Its always hard to second guess what they will like.  All of our have loved
the round thing with the ball inside.  Until Jake figured out how to get the
ball out.  But we got years out of those.

Our best bet is still a small piece of paper or card board tied to the end
of a string being pulled by a nine year old kid.  They fall for that every
time.

That and bed mice.  Jake is determined to destroy the cotton blanket I have
on the bed right now.

No ideas other than that.

Play &amp; Squeak is an excellent recommendation. They make a play-n-
squeak-on-a-stick,
and it even gets Yoda going, and he's near 15 years old. It sounds
remarkably like
a mouse in distress. A real mouse-in-distress would be, of course, his
alltime favorite toy,
but I do draw the line somewhere.
Turbo Scratcher is the *one* toy that's never been given to the
shelter because the
cats lost interest in it. I must have bought dozens of refills for
that thing and someone
is always playing with it. Bootie is the Turbo-Scratcher champ. She
can manipulate
that ball better than anyone.
It's funny that you mentioned the two favorite toys of *my* cats.
Third favorite is a feather-on-a-wand. The proper way to play the game
is to lay a sheet
of newspaper down, then drag the feather under the paper.

truthfully the real toy of choice here is still after over ten cats in ten
years testing it, is the turboscratcher... even Tiger the old, grumpy, never
learned to play because he was abused, will when he thinks nobody is looking
go over and bat it to see what the fuss is about, Lee...*we have 4 of them
in the house*

FWIW my boys, however old they've grown, never ever tired of interacting
with me in a game of &quot;chase, hunt &amp; kill the ultralong mousie tail&quot; -
otherwise known as &quot;string&quot;.

A five-foot length trailed around behind you, whizzed from side the side,
whirled around, and so on will probably never fail to amuse &amp; stimulate. The
interaction's quite fun for both parties too :)

The only thing that all four of my cats will go for is a piece of
timothy grass that is in seed.  I pick one each day during the dog
walk.  Another thing I've started doing recently that they all like is
cutting off the bottom end of a plastic bag and tying it in the middle
(looks kind of like a double maple seed, spins and makes great crinkly
sounds.)  I flip it to them and it spins, which gets their attention.
Several of these are flying around the house.  Free and no batteries.

Mine love that but only because there's two of them to play &quot;Kitten tennis&quot;.
Basically they sit either side of it facing each other and then one of them
will bap the ball to get it moving. The aim seems to be to get it past the
cat on the other side presumably that gets you a point but if the other cat
stops the ball then they get the point

I think everyone here has seen pictures of the (literally) hundreds of cat
toys I have in my house.  The absolute favorite - never get tired of it - is
the plastic ring you take off of milk cartons!!!  ;&gt;  All of them,
especially the kittens now, play with those things for hours - throwing them
up in the air, playing shuffleboard with them across the floor, they seem a

On the home-made toy front:

twist-tie &quot;spiders&quot; (twist 3-5 together)

I haven't tried this, but I've seen commercial versions: take a shoe
box or other box with a lid and cut a few paw-sized holes around it,
put in a toy or two, and seal the box.

loose grapes, Q-Tips or drinking straws to bat around

Have fun!

That's a *great* idea to move the feather around under the paper.  Cats love

&gt;&gt;&gt; Persia is getting older (8-10, don't really know).  I'm trying to
&gt;&gt;&gt; get her to
&gt;&gt;&gt; play more.  She's become very sedentary but she needs the exercise
&gt;&gt;&gt; *and* the
&gt;&gt;&gt; mental stimulation.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Any recommendations for some inexpensive cat toys that might
&gt;&gt;&gt; stimulate her?
&gt;&gt;&gt; I got a little 'pin money' for my birthday and would like to spend
&gt;&gt;&gt; some of it on my precious Persia :)

&gt;&gt; I think everyone here has seen pictures of the (literally) hundreds
&gt;&gt; of cat toys I have in my house.  The absolute favorite - never get
&gt;&gt; tired of it - is the plastic ring you take off of milk cartons!!!  ;&gt;
&gt;&gt; All of them, especially the kittens now, play with those things for
&gt;&gt; hours - throwing them up in the air, playing shuffleboard with them
&gt;&gt; across the floor, they seem a never ending source of fun!

&gt; I've thought of that.  But my kitchen is tiny and the milk rings don't
&gt; scoot
&gt; very well on carpet.

I don't know, I see mine all over the house - even on the carpet!

Hugs,

Not grapes, please!  They may be toxic to cats.  Most of the research has
been done on dogs (where a very small amount can show signs of toxicity),
but the ASPCA recommends against giving *any* amount of grapes or raisins to
cats and dogs.  It's not worth taking the risk that your cat might ingest
one while playing in the way you described.

Do they make toys for cats like the kong toys they make for dogs.  You put a
treat inside and they have to work to get it out.  Something of that sort
would get Persia moving, even if the treat was just a piece of kibble from
her normal ration.

The twist tie thing bothers me, too.  Persia is a &quot;chewer&quot;.  I'd be
terrified of her enthusiastically chewing away and accidentally injesting
something containing metal.  The sharp end of a twist tie could perforating
her intestine.

&gt;&gt; Third favorite is a feather-on-a-wand. The proper way to play the game
&gt;&gt; is to lay a sheet
&gt;&gt; of newspaper down, then drag the feather under the paper.

&gt; That's a *great* idea to move the feather around under the paper.  Cats love
&gt; that crinkly sound.

I've never met a cat that can resist going after something moving
around underneath paper, cloth, a rug, etc.

I have a bunch of long plastic rods, left over from vinyl blinds I've
bought over the years to replace previous ones. Those make excellent
kitty toys. I run one underneath a small rug, so that one end of the
stick can poke in and out from under the rug. Licky and Roxy take turns
pouncing on it. Smudge used to love this game, but she has bigger fish
to fry now. Works great to get a scaredy-cat that I'm pet-sitting to
feel a little safer with me, too.

The absolute favourite toy with all our cats, from kittenhood to
very, very old, was free (thrown out in the rubbish).  It's a few
feet of the cord that controls a certain kind of window blind - a
densely braided synthetic fibre cord with plastic beads moulded
onto it every half-inch or so (the beads act like the links on a
bicycle chain).

It needs a human on the other end.  You swing it around the cat
and it can't resist chasing it.  The beads are easy to grab but
the cord is too dense for their claws to catch in it, so they
quickly let it go and you try again.  (Except for my little Mingus,
who never quite got the idea of letting go of anything - he gripped
it like grim death between his teeth, you could gently play him
like a fish).  Our Chloe likes the challenge if you grip it by the
middle and swing both ends round her head at the same time to give
her two targets to aim at.  Others prefer to chase it along the
floor like a snake.  For such a simple object it's hours of fun,
and the first one we got lasted 15 years before we gave it away
with two of Marblecake's kittens when we rehomed them.

The other real hit, with Muriel and Zeke, was a plastic tarantula
with a jumping mechanism driven by a bulb and a few feet of air
tube.  But they destroyed it in a few weeks.

What both of these have in common is that the real toy is the human.
No passive toy is ever going be as interesting as something worked
by an owner who cares and tries to understand how the cat thinks.

Both Marblecake's litters of kittens had a great time with a thing
I got from a charity shop for 1 pound.  It's a kitten-sized tent or
Wendy house made of stiff carpeting, with no floor but a hole in the
side a few inches across.  They're all over it, inside and out, for
hours every day.  But really it's just a structure that helps them
play with each other.

Okay, everyone... STOP suggesting I get another cat.  Ain't gonna happen.
She HATES other cats.  Like Lori's Tayla, she is an *only cat*.  A one cat

Rhia loves balls of scrunched-up aluminium foil. The absolute best is
that sort of foil on a plastic substrate often used for sweet wrappers
(Polo mint wrappers for those in the UK), because they're really light.
Again these bounce erratically. Also she carries them upstairs in her
mouth, pushes them off the top step then charges down the stairs trying
to catch them before they reach the bottom. And they cost nothing! Amy
will occasionally play with balls of foil, but prefers toys she can
throw, the 'Marty Mouse' is her favourite.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Persia is getting older (8-10, don't really know).  I'm trying to get
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; her to play more.  She's become very sedentary but she needs the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; exercise *and* the mental stimulation. snip.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Mine loves ping pong balls because when they hit something they go off
&gt;&gt;&gt; into
&gt;&gt;&gt; an unpredictable direction.  6 for $1 at the dollar store.

&gt;&gt; Have you ever put on in a (dry) bathtub for them to play with?  Mine love
&gt;&gt; that!

&gt; My friend with the two Bengals put them in the tub with a few inches of
&gt; water for her cats.

LOL!  I would love to see that.  I'm afraid it wouldn't go over well with my
crew, though!

Hugs,

Every cat is different, and you never know what will catch their fancy,
but my cats have their own favourite toys. Caliban lives mylar balls. He
can play with them for literally hours. Since we came home from the
island, I can't find any of them, or they have been squished flat so
they don't roll (clumsy Meowmie stepped on them), so I took a piece of
aluminium foil and scrunched it up into a ball. Caliban loves that, too.
He is playing with it now, and has been for a good long while. It has
the same propensity as mylar balls of almost moving just by looking at
it, and it's also easy to pick up and carry to a location better suited
for batting it around.

Miranda loves string. A sturdy shoe lace is the best kind of string. She
doesn't even need a human to drag it around, she does that herself. I
especially remember one time, I was working at home and Mir brought me a
string and wanted me to pull it around. When I wouldn't play with her,
she picked up the end of the string and started walking around the flat
with it, all the while looking back at the other end dragging behind
her. She walked by my chair and walked in a few circles, as if to
demonstrate how I was supposed to handle the string. She was so
incredibly cute that I didn't get any work done, since I had to watch
her playing with her string. ;)

Pecans, still in the shell, are a big hit with two of ours.  They roll
unpredictably because they aren't perfectly round.
