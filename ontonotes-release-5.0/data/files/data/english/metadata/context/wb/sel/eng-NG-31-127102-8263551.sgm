Seeking advice on fluoride water filters

I would appreciate knowing if anyone has had any experience with
filters to remove fluoride from tap water.

I have consistently low temperature which mostly falls in the range of
between 96.5 and 97.2.

At the moment, constipation is my major concern. It seems like all I
think about is eating more fiber. I'm up to 1 1/2 cups of  wheat bran;
plus 1/4 c flax seed, ground; plus 2 tbsp psyllium husks.

I want to al least try to avoid fluoride for a month before seeking
medical attention. If I'm lucky, maybe that's all that's wrong with
me. Any idea if a month is long enough to clear the effects of
fluoride, if that is the source of my problem?

I stopped using toothpaste about six months ago.

Any advice will be greatly appreciated.
Sincerely,  BlackHawk

get bottled water ... if your tap water has fluoride in it (99% of the
flouroide that your tax payer dollars goes down the drain and in your
garden/lawn/vehicle washing)

downside is losing your teeth faster through teeth pimple formation.

also up your fruits (5 a day) to smooth out the digestion .. and 2 double OO
capsules of medical marijuana makes the morning as smooth as a breeze for me
(synthyroid has some problems with spasticity of the muscles, especially the
gastric muscles as tummy is the route of medical ingestion).

with your low temp - look into the freeze response of SNS dominance coming
up .. it is a function of PTSD issues.

good luck ...

the 'regulars' in this ng.

Asking Alan for advice isn't recommended. While he might occasionally
come up with a gem, it is usually nonsense, gibberish, and his own issues.
He has, at least lately, added a post script to his posts that you may want
to block him, letting you know ahead of time that his advise may not be what
you want.

Yes, a filter would be a better option for you, and can vary in price,
depending on design and manufacture. Remember, though, toothpastes, and some
mouthwashes, have fluoride in them too.

best way to take minerals out of water ... is by steam.

boil the water, the H2O goes up and condenses to fall down clean, then
running it through thousands of acres of moss and grass to put organic
chains in the water so that it helps pull out minerals and toxic metals from
the body .. is the way to go.

the water in the tap, while in most cases is good (stay away from the Marine
Corp I would have to say), pulls through metals, and there is really no way
to really filter it out ... perhaps with reverse osmosis ceramic filters
would be the way to go I guess.

But it will have no organics in it like Cobb Mountain Water that shut down
for a lack of the right kind of Jesus in it.

You want to get better, there are certain things you have to do to get
better.

You do not do these things, you will not get better.

You are your best doctor, you know what you are doing, you will work it out.

Penny wise and dollar foolish is sometimes the case with medicine, sometimes
not.

Sometimes the medicine is only there with Organic spices and herbs, and
nothing else will work.

In some cases you must buy organic or obtain organic.

The more you put in you, the better, is my IMO.

Prescott Bush and Big Money were not right with God so he put into
protections after Black Monday in 1929, that Gingrich and the GOPerps who
game deregulation with Enrons ... well those FDR protections, they were

that which you call a cavity ... a dental carrie.

it is an infection, and proper oral hygene to kill bacteria or virus and
clean the mouth with hydrogen peroxide, baking soda, perodent (rx only),
liquid calcium, and highly diluted clorox

one drop of 100 to 1 household sodium hydrocloride dilution on your tooth
brush with a mouth full of peroxide will do a real proper cleaning of things
and penetrate the dental field to root out infections rather quickly, but
you have to keep the teeth building up from such 'heat' being used to clean
things.  deeper infections would need a cotton packing of peroxide, cloride,
and floride topically to penetrate and clean out.

i use floride, just only on the teeth, and do all I can not to drink or
ingest it.  it is a carcinogen, and on the United Nations list of prohibited
ocean dumping .. however the USA dumps thousands of tons of this shit
through our bodies and then kill the oceans.

this with Agent Orange, Paraquat, Mercury, and rocket fuel ... is killing us
and killing the oceans.

Praise the Chruch of Incest Best.

People stuck in their tempertantrum going to their Jonestown.

tis that silly nature of the Beast 666 and how it goes to its Armageddon.

a tempertantrum times a billion.

The Mark of Cain is the tempertantrum, the Beast just the Mark Cain on
steroids.

apples, wet plums, nectaries, yogurt, whip them up in a blender, add your
oat bran flakes ... and drink it down.

you need water as well as roughage ... dried is dried ... it sticks things
up.

also check your astrology (Aruyvedic Medicine) like if you are a water sign
like a Pisces, Scorpio, Cancer ... then eating foods from the earth, under
the earth, sugars, thicken up your water.

so the foods up in the sun, in the air, would work better for you.

earth just slugs you up in this case.

some fire signs ... would burn out with out earth helping them out so they
would be real beef eaters, potato eaters and the like in getting foods from
that place for them.

there is a learning curve to discovering what your medical profile is, and
what works best for you.

keep at it, the curve picks up after awhile.

the medical marijuana ... it works on the endocrine system, the soup you
live in, it doesn't effect the CNS (central nervous system) ... so your
thinking process is just fine.

not like on alcohol or brain drugs.

as a gastric motility agent, it would just smooth out the stool, much like
psyllium husks, and medicate the bowel to not work so hard, and work better
as a consequence.  a lazy, stoney, bowel action.

not that your rectum would have a buzz on mind you.

as for the PTSD issues, that is best taken care of though the release of the
bitter salty tears, and using applied psychophyiology interventions that
work for you.

traditonal chinese accupuncuture (5 element), biofeedback, integrative body
psychotherapy, hot yoga, streatching at range of motion, are good helps to
this ... usually brings the tears out and emotional history ... that is from
the tempertantrum not being handle right in their childhood.

the PTSD issues is a person living in fear, where the tempertantrum is all
in fear.

the love has to burn though the tempertantrum for a person to grow up.

and mommy and daddy has to do this to raise healthy children is my IMO and
in most of the world this is not done.

so we have emotionally immature people running the country like Bush who is
just stuck in his tempertantrum and some people are calling deranged now.

You might get activated charcoal to remove the fluoride.  If you let the
water sit for a while it may also tend to evaporate off.  My guess is that
the fluoride isn't causing your problems.  Fluoride tends to stay in bones
and teeth, and doesn't do much if anything for the digestive tract.  It
would act a bit like chloride, except it bonds a bit tighter.

As far as avoiding fluoride for a month, it won't do you any harm, possibly
no good, but at least no harm.  You may try to use deionized water  (do not
use distilled water for drinking).

With that level of bran and fiber you should have a little problem with
loose stools.

You wouldn't by any chance have dry skin also, would you?  How about
noticing that your walking speed is a litte slower than the people around
you?

The only type of filter that will remove fluoride is a reverse osmosis
system. I know because I work for as a water treatment operator
(certified by my state). I am looking into a system called Zero Water,
but don't think it removes fluoride. I sent them a message a while
back and still haven't heard anything. Home Depot had a RO system for
under $200 a while back that had a daily capacity of 5 gals which
would be perfect for most families drinking and cooking needs.

You may even want to check out the book by Christopher Bryson called
'the fluoride deception.' You will be totally surprised by what he was
able to find out about fluoride and the health effects it causes.

Fluoride has a high affinity for bones, that is correct but the higher
concentration of fluoride in your teeth and bones will make them
brittle not stronger.

Hope you find what you need.

I was talking to the other person stuck in their tempertantrum cause there
mommie and daddy were not fit to be parents.  I was not talking to your
tempertantrum, perhaps you missed this.

Remember I do not want anything from you ... where as you want something
from me.

I do not want you even to be honest to me, nor do I want my wife and
children to be honest to me ... that is something that they have to want to
do on their own.  Cause they love it.  Not fear it like you do.

You know how the tempertantrum is:  &quot;Don't Talk to me&quot; ... &quot;You are mean&quot;
... You are out to get me&quot; ... Don't see me&quot; ... &quot;Pay off the baby sitter&quot;
... &quot;Do it my way cause I am the biggest fuck in this house&quot;.

They whine about 'bad words' ... 'evil words' ... and then they run away and
hide cause you wont stop talking the bad way.

You want to talk to me Michael ... then tell me who you are.

Introduce yourself to me ... or did your mommie and daddy not teach you
about having consideration for people, being honest, coming out in the light
of day, not hiding behind you nick.

Tell me who the fuck you are and stop fucking with me if you want to have a
BIG PEOPLE conversation that uses all the dictionary ... not the baby talk
dictionary that is tempertantrum based you are in to.

Oh BTW ... Bush fears being honest so he lies to US and he lies to his
mommie and daddy, not to worry they are liars as well ... such is why we
have a President No Know stuck in his tempertantrum as he hates Barbara and
he hates Georgie ... kissing cousins you know.

Keeping it in the family, incest is best sort of thing.

Bush family is a bunch of family fuckers.

Georgie is a product of incest, the genetic dice falling a bit to close to
home there and we have a Deliverance baby with dueling banjos.

During an earthquake where Bush is up in the airplane waving down to us
people dying of starvation and thirst asking for help ... we can get water
anywere ... creek, ocean, duck pond, cow puddle ... and filter it out with
reverse osmosis ... 5 gallons a day of drinking water in our own home

Gotta get one ... as FEMA is no help at all with the dick heads Bush brought

I missed nothing. You talked about me, I responed, and you freaked a bit.
Perhaps you didn't think I knew?

Now, how is it that you don't know me?  I've been around on this newsgroup
for years.  Not just around, but quite active.  Sometimes I'm right,
sometimes I'm wrong, but I try to maintain my demeanor online as helpful and
reasonably related to thyroid problems.

One of the largest problems here is to separate the good advice from bad
advice, the wheat from the chaff so to speak.  I've seen some of your
advice, and have noticed that it is often very confusing for people who do
not know you.   In many cases, you have suggested that obvious thyroid
problems were the result of some mental issue.  Usually a more knowledgeable
member makes a correction, but this is doing damage to the group and to the
participants.  Given your occasional signature of &lt;&lt;sumbuddie who cares&gt;&gt;
this is quite perturbing.  I recognize that you aren't the person you used
to be before your problems started, but this isn't a mental health group.
It is a thyroid group.

In that case, what &quot;would&quot;  you guess is causing my problems?
If the fluoride in the water I'm drinking IS mimicking TSH in my

&gt;As far as avoiding fluoride for a month, it won't do you any harm, possibly
&gt;no good, but at least no harm.  You may try to use deionized water  (do not
&gt;use distilled water for drinking).

&gt;With that level of bran and fiber you should have a little problem with
&gt;loose stools.
">

Thats what I thought too, but it hasn't worked out that way. What I've
just recently discovered, in the last few days, to be the KEY to my
constipation is a profound MAGNESIUM deficiency, corrected by 1/2
tsp/day of epsom salts dissolved in half a glass of hot water.
According to my calculations, there is 266mg of Mg in the 1/2 tsp of
epsom salts. That doesn't sound like a lot, considering there is
supposed to be 279mg of Mg in a cup of wheat bran. As I recall, the
MgSO4-7H20, when added to the water, is ionized and is easily absorbed
(to the extent that the body need the Mg )in the gut.. I don't know
what the actual mechanism is that causes an Mg deficiency to produce
constipation, but my guess is that with a deficiency, the colon is
instructed to &quot;wring out&quot; every drop of water from the stool in the
hope that it will contain even a trace of Mg (which would be the case
in a high Mg food such as wheat bran). Perhaps that explains why wheat
bran does not always act as a laxative, as one would expect!

The reason for my apparent deficiency is, I guess, mainly a result of
all the homemade beer I consume, as alcohol is reported to lower Mg
levels in the body. I suspect fluoride has something to do with it as
well, as I use tap water for my beer.

I read in the &quot;Nutrition Almanac&quot; on page 78 that: &quot;Evidence suggests
that magnesium is associated with the regulation of body temperature.&quot;
Today my temp is breaking the high end of my recent (two week) range
at 97.4 and 97.9. I was considering skipping the Mg today as my
constipation has disappeared, but with those higher temp readings, I
think I'll keep at it to see what happens with my temp.

&gt;&gt;&gt;I would appreciate knowing if anyone has had any experience with
&gt;&gt;&gt; filters to remove fluoride from tap water.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I have consistently low temperature which mostly falls in the range of
&gt;&gt;&gt; between 96.5 and 97.2.

&gt;&gt;&gt; At the moment, constipation is my major concern. It seems like all I
&gt;&gt;&gt; think about is eating more fiber. I'm up to 1 1/2 cups of  wheat bran;
&gt;&gt;&gt; plus 1/4 c flax seed, ground; plus 2 tbsp psyllium husks.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I want to al least try to avoid fluoride for a month before seeking
&gt;&gt;&gt; medical attention. If I'm lucky, maybe that's all that's wrong with
&gt;&gt;&gt; me. Any idea if a month is long enough to clear the effects of
&gt;&gt;&gt; fluoride, if that is the source of my problem?

&gt;&gt;&gt; I stopped using toothpaste about six months ago.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Any advice will be greatly appreciated.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Sincerely,  BlackHawk

&gt; Michael, thanks for your civil reply.

&gt;&gt;You might get activated charcoal to remove the fluoride.  If you let the
&gt;&gt;water sit for a while it may also tend to evaporate off.  My guess is that
&gt;&gt;the fluoride isn't causing your problems.

&gt; In that case, what &quot;would&quot;  you guess is causing my problems?
&gt; If the fluoride in the water I'm drinking IS mimicking TSH in my
&gt; blood, and causing me to be hypothyroid, then fluoride's effect may be
&gt; very &quot;problematic&quot;.

&gt;&gt;Fluoride tends to stay in bones
&gt;&gt;and teeth, and doesn't do much if anything for the digestive tract.

&gt; Hypothyroidism would affect the bowel muscles mitochondria too,
&gt; wouldn't it, causing &quot;sluggish bowel&quot;?

&gt;&gt; It would act a bit like chloride, except it bonds a bit tighter.

&gt;&gt;As far as avoiding fluoride for a month, it won't do you any harm,
&gt;&gt;possibly
&gt;&gt;no good, but at least no harm.  You may try to use deionized water  (do
&gt;&gt;not
&gt;&gt;use distilled water for drinking).

&gt;&gt;With that level of bran and fiber you should have a little problem with
&gt;&gt;loose stools.

&gt; Thats what I thought too, but it hasn't worked out that way. What I've
&gt; just recently discovered, in the last few days, to be the KEY to my
&gt; constipation is a profound MAGNESIUM deficiency, corrected by 1/2
&gt; tsp/day of epsom salts dissolved in half a glass of hot water.
&gt; According to my calculations, there is 266mg of Mg in the 1/2 tsp of
&gt; epsom salts. That doesn't sound like a lot, considering there is
&gt; supposed to be 279mg of Mg in a cup of wheat bran. As I recall, the
&gt; MgSO4-7H20, when added to the water, is ionized and is easily absorbed
&gt; (to the extent that the body need the Mg )in the gut.. I don't know
&gt; what the actual mechanism is that causes an Mg deficiency to produce
&gt; constipation, but my guess is that with a deficiency, the colon is
&gt; instructed to &quot;wring out&quot; every drop of water from the stool in the
&gt; hope that it will contain even a trace of Mg (which would be the case
&gt; in a high Mg food such as wheat bran). Perhaps that explains why wheat
&gt; bran does not always act as a laxative, as one would expect!

&gt; The reason for my apparent deficiency is, I guess, mainly a result of
&gt; all the homemade beer I consume, as alcohol is reported to lower Mg
&gt; levels in the body. I suspect fluoride has something to do with it as
&gt; well, as I use tap water for my beer.

&gt; I read in the &quot;Nutrition Almanac&quot; on page 78 that: &quot;Evidence suggests
&gt; that magnesium is associated with the regulation of body temperature.&quot;
&gt; Today my temp is breaking the high end of my recent (two week) range
&gt; at 97.4 and 97.9. I was considering skipping the Mg today as my
&gt; constipation has disappeared, but with those higher temp readings, I
&gt; think I'll keep at it to see what happens with my temp.

&gt;&gt;You wouldn't by any chance have dry skin also, would you?

&gt; All the oil in the flax  (35%) keeps my skin very oily.
&gt;&gt;How about
&gt;&gt;noticing that your walking speed is a litte slower than the people around
&gt;&gt;you?
&gt; Actually, I walk faster, and I do not suffer from fatigue, in my
&gt; opinion.
&gt; BlackHawk

&gt;&gt;Michael

The dry skin and walking slower are both pretty decent signs of a hypo
metabolic disorder.  If you are walking faster than your friends, you aren't
hypo, but might actually be a little hyper or just healthier than the rest
of them.

Yes, magnesium is another one of those element that are needed, and you
probably have it right about the bowels trying to get every last bit of it.

It looks like you have your problem on its way to resolution.  In this case
it wasn't thyroid, and probably not fluoride.

Incidentally, the story of how fluoride got into the water is a rather
interesting one.  A dentist noticed that people who grew up in his area had
no cavities, but those who didn't grow up there did.  He also noticed that
their teeth were discolored.  After a great deal of work, he found that
there was natural fluoride in the water.  Comparing notes with other
dentists, they worked out that areas with high fluoride had very few
cavities.  Based on that, and some other evidence, municipalities started
fluoridating water (in the ppm level).  Recently, one old dentist explained
to me that the poor kids in the town who had to drink water had no cavities.
This was a far cry from before the fluoridation, when many of them had a
mouth full of fillings.

Too much fluoride will indeed embrittle bones.  It doesn't help adults
nearly as much as it helps children.  There is currently some concern that
with fluoride toothpastes, fluoridated water, fluoride treatments, etc, that
there is too much fluoride in our lives now.  Just like about anything else,
if a little bit is good for you, it doesn't mean that a lot of it is better.
Chocolate is the obvious exception  to that rule :)

Ha, you miss everything ... especially that which has to do with your
'Emotional Intelligence'.

Now, how is that I do not know you ... you have never made an introduction
and still you do not do that dispite by twice made request for you to do
that; since you are not inclined honesty is something that you fear.

Tempertantrums are of such things ... since your mommie and daddie never
handled your tempertantrum correctly this makes for your emotional
immaturity, your living in fear, not being able to do the painfull work of
living in love.

You say that emotional problems and one's psychology has nothing to do with
thyroid issues ... so please put me in your killfile thingy.

Oh BTW .. I was not talking to you (you missed that part) ... I was only
making reference to you as I would that Idiot in the White House to show, to
give an example of, what 'sick' looks like.

The learning curve is pretty flat at first but it picks up after awhile.

All hail the Church of Incest and our God the Father who makes babies with
His daughters and it is a fucking miracle for it is a Jonestown we go.

&gt; I missed nothing. You talked about me, I responed, and you freaked a bit.
&gt; Perhaps you didn't think I knew?

&gt; Now, how is it that you don't know me?  I've been around on this newsgroup
&gt; for years.  Not just around, but quite active.  Sometimes I'm right,
&gt; sometimes I'm wrong, but I try to maintain my demeanor online as helpful and
&gt; reasonably related to thyroid problems.

&gt; One of the largest problems here is to separate the good advice from bad
&gt; advice, the wheat from the chaff so to speak.  I've seen some of your
&gt; advice, and have noticed that it is often very confusing for people who do
&gt; not know you.   In many cases, you have suggested that obvious thyroid
&gt; problems were the result of some mental issue.  Usually a more knowledgeable
&gt; member makes a correction, but this is doing damage to the group and to the
&gt; participants.  Given your occasional signature of &lt;&lt;sumbuddie who cares&gt;&gt;
&gt; this is quite perturbing.  I recognize that you aren't the person you used
&gt; to be before your problems started, but this isn't a mental health group.
&gt; It is a thyroid group.

&gt; &gt;The only type of filter that will remove fluoride is a reverse osmosis
&gt; &gt;system. I know because I work for as a water treatment operator
&gt; &gt;(certified by my state). I am looking into a system called Zero Water,
&gt; &gt;but don't think it removes fluoride. I sent them a message a while
&gt; &gt;back and still haven't heard anything. Home Depot had a RO system for
&gt; &gt;under $200 a while back that had a daily capacity of 5 gals which
&gt; &gt;would be perfect for most families drinking and cooking needs.

&gt; Linda, it sure sounds like you know what you're talking about. Thanks
&gt; for the info. I'll have a look at those RO systems. Do they remove the
&gt; minerals as well as the fluoride?

&gt; &gt;You may even want to check out the book by Christopher Bryson called
&gt; &gt;'the fluoride deception.' You will be totally surprised by what he was
&gt; &gt;able to find out about fluoride and the health effects it causes.

&gt; I'll see if I can get that at my library. Thanks.

&gt; &gt;Fluoride has a high affinity for bones, that is correct but the higher
&gt; &gt;concentration of fluoride in your teeth and bones will make them
&gt; &gt;brittle not stronger.

&gt; I've heard that magnesium is much better for strong bones and teeth
&gt; than calcium. Is hypothyroidism mentioned in  &quot;The Fluoride

RO systems remove everything that is in ionic form, so yes it would
remove the minerals. Most of the minerals in water aren't in the form
that the body can use them and most of the time isn't in a large
enough quantity so it is best to get your minerals from supplements or
the food you consume.

RO systems give you pure water, there is nothing but good old H2O
after you've run it through an RO system.

Good luck.
