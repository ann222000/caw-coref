Does anyone still believe that the September 11, 2001 attack on the
U.S. was not a surprise? The author of this extensive site says: &quot;The
9/11/01 attack was a complex psychological operation carefully
designed to conceal the truth, in spite of numerous obvious red flags
in the fraudulent official story.&quot;

9/11 was a coverup. A coverup of the way Bush stole into office.
Bush needed 9/11 more than Osama needed it. Osama
has only seen to profit by 9/11 because (and not despite) of
Bush's duplicitious policies. Policies that harmed the ability to
fight terror, international backward, his warmongering, his
attacks on liberty that immediately put every moderate on
notice that calling in a terrorist to the CIA might not be their
best moved until the US winds had settled. Bush went fascist
and the terrorists breed like wildfire.

Thousands of eyewitnesses to the events of 9/11 saw things that were
consistant with PM and the &quot;Standard Story&quot; and contrary to Twoofer
claims.

There are no eyewitnesses to &quot;molten metal&quot; on the pile at WTC.  All
the stories turn out to be second-hand when researched.

There are no eyewitnesses that say they saw evidence of man-made
explosives at WTC. &quot;explosion&quot; is just a good word for &quot;loud noise&quot;.
Nobody heard explosions as loud as the 1993 bombing consistent with
the video of the collapse.  Thermite takes minutes to operate and
produces voluminous white light, white smoke and slag.  Nobody saw
light and smoke prior to the collapse. Nobody found the slag,
afterwords.

Every quote of a NY fireman provided by the &quot;Truth Movement&quot; is a lie,
edited and out of context and without citation. The &quot;Truth Movement&quot;
censors information that contradicts Truthy claims.

Nobody heard explsions of size and timing consistant with any of the
collapses of any of the buildings at WTC.  The explosions would have
been larger and louder than the 1993 bomb (about half a ton of TNT,
equiv) which everyone hear and didn't come close to bringing a tower
down.

At the Pentagon, There are hundreds of eyewitnesses that saw the plane
approach the building low and fast. Nobody saw that jet fly over it
and leave.  Many of them saw it crash.

In PA, 95% of the aircraft debris of Flight 93 has been recovered and
identified as have DNA samples of all the passengers.

That has nothing to do with the engineering analysis of the collapse
of three WTC towers and the aviation crash scene analysis at the
Pentagon and Shanksville.

To believe that something other than 4 hijacked airplanes caused all
the destruction on 9/11 is to look stupid and IMO, this is the real
purpose of the &quot;Truth Movement&quot;, to make critics of the administration
look like idiots

Thousands of eyewitnesses saw some aspect of the events of 9/11 and
they saw things that were consistant with PM and the &quot;Standard Story&quot;
and contrary to Twoofer claims.

Nobody with any relevant expertise in aviation or civil engineering is
using that expertise to explain how something is wrong in the
&quot;standard story&quot; in any way that makes sense to others with relevant
expertise.

Nobody in the &quot;Truth Movement&quot; is speaking within their area of
expertise unless it's a theologian speaking about &quot;belief&quot;.  Most of
the people listed by the &quot;Truth Movement' as having technical
expertise turn out to have exaggerated their resumes when checked.

There are no eyewitnesses to &quot;molten metal&quot; on the pile at WTC.  All
the stories turn out to be second-hand when researched.

There are no eyewitnesses that say they saw evidence of man-made
explosives at WTC. &quot;explosion&quot; is just a good word for &quot;loud noise&quot;.
Nobody heard explosions as loud as the 1993 bombing consistent with
the video of the collapse.  Thermite takes minutes to operate and

In PA, 95% of the aircraft debris of Flight 93 has been recovered and
all the passengers have identified by DNA.

So much for &quot;truth&quot;.

Everyone should get the bittorent for the HBO show about the Truth
Movement for a good laugh.

PENTAGON
Until the wall collapsed, the hole in the Pentagon was a 17 ft circle (approximately)
which penetrated 6 steel-reinforced concrete walls... directly into the newly beefed-up
(structurally remodeled) area which was temporarily housing the NIS, who were then
investigating the $2.3 TRILLION dollars in MISSING Pentagon funds.  An issue, that
like Enron, was immediately dropped from the news and swept under the carpet.
Any public evidence of bodies or aircraft wreckage from the Pentagon is virtually
non-existant.

Are you a pieceologist? How small is too small for your theory? 95% of
the plane was recovered in the hole. What difference does it make how
large or small the pieces are?

Have you ever seen a plane crash from full throttle and high altitude?
I have, in 1960:
http://www.astorialic.org/starjournal/1960s/1960december_p.php

The big parts, landing gear and the engine shaft and turbine disks
(not the entire engine, intact) survive, as they did in Shankville.
Everything else is small bits.

Here's a short video of a Phanton jet hitting a wall. A supersonic
combat plane is MUCH stronger than a commercial jet.

95% of the aircraft [3] that was Flight 93 was recovered in the
hole. [2] This included both black boxes which have been analyzed [4]
and all the people that boarded Flight 93 have been identified by DNA,
jewlery, luggage, and dental records. [1].

At Shanksville over 1,100 people from 74 agencies and organizations
worked at the scene. [6]

The data in the black boxes is consistant with all other evidence. [4].

See [5] for a short video of what happens to a Phantom jet when it

FBI finished with Pennsylvania crash site probe

SHANKSVILLE, Pennsylvania (CNN) --The FBI announced Monday that its
investigation of the site where a hijacked jet slammed into a field
here is complete and that 95 percent of the plane was recovered.

The federal investigation into the September 11 terrorist attacks
continues.

Evidence-gathering was halted Saturday afternoon and the pieces of
United Airlines Flight 93 that had been recovered were turned over
Sunday to the airline, with the exception of the flight data recorder
and the voice recorder, which are being held and analyzed by the FBI,
according to FBI agent Bill Crowley.

Crowley said the biggest piece of the plane that was recovered was a
6-by-7-foot piece of the fuselage skin, including about four
windows. The heaviest piece, Crowley said, was part of an engine fan,
weighing about 1,000 pounds.

Flight 93 was one of four jets hijacked Sept. 11. Authorities believe
the flight, which originated in Newark, New Jersey, and had been
destined for San Francisco, was headed for the nation's capital, where
the hijackers may have intended to slam it into the White House or the
Capitol.

Attorney General John Ashcroft and FBI Director Robert Mueller have
praised the passengers of that flight, saying it appears their actions
in trying to regain control of the aircraft averted a greater tragedy.

People who spoke by phone with passengers after the plane was hijacked
say that after the passengers found out about the earlier World Trade
Center attack, they decided to try to overpower the hijackers.

And officials familiar with the flight's cockpit voice recorder say it
shows there was a &quot;definite struggle,&quot; which they described as
desperate and wild, between hijackers and some of the passengers.

All 44 people on board the flight were killed when it slammed into the
ground.

All of which I endorse but that has nothing to do with the engineering
analysis of the collapse of three WTC towers and the aviation crash
scene analysis at the Pentagon and Shanksville.

To believe that something other than 4 hijacked airplanes caused all
the destruction on 9/11 is to look stupid and IMO, this is the real
purpose of the &quot;Truth Movement&quot;, to make critics of the administration
look like idiots

&gt; Are you a pieceologist? How small is too small for your theory? 95% of
&gt; the plane was recovered in the hole. What difference does it make how
&gt; large or small the pieces are?

&gt; Have you ever seen a plane crash from full throttle and high altitude?
&gt; I have, in 1960:

&gt; The big parts, landing gear and the engine shaft and turbine disks
&gt; (not the entire engine, intact) survive, as they did in Shankville.
&gt; Everything else is small bits.

&gt; Here's a short video of a Phanton jet hitting a wall. A supersonic
&gt; combat plane is MUCH stronger than a commercial jet.

&gt; 95% of the aircraft [3] that was Flight 93 was recovered in the
&gt; hole. [2] This included both black boxes which have been analyzed [4]
&gt; and all the people that boarded Flight 93 have been identified by DNA,
&gt; jewlery, luggage, and dental records. [1].

&gt; At Shanksville over 1,100 people from 74 agencies and organizations
&gt; worked at the scene. [6]

&gt; The data in the black boxes is consistant with all other evidence. [4].

&gt;    FBI finished with Pennsylvania crash site probe

&gt;    SHANKSVILLE, Pennsylvania (CNN) --The FBI announced Monday that its
&gt;    investigation of the site where a hijacked jet slammed into a field
&gt;    here is complete and that 95 percent of the plane was recovered.

&gt;    The federal investigation into the September 11 terrorist attacks
&gt;    continues.

&gt;    Evidence-gathering was halted Saturday afternoon and the pieces of
&gt;    United Airlines Flight 93 that had been recovered were turned over
&gt;    Sunday to the airline, with the exception of the flight data recorder
&gt;    and the voice recorder, which are being held and analyzed by the FBI,
&gt;    according to FBI agent Bill Crowley.

&gt;    Crowley said the biggest piece of the plane that was recovered was a
&gt;    6-by-7-foot piece of the fuselage skin, including about four
&gt;    windows. The heaviest piece, Crowley said, was part of an engine fan,
&gt;    weighing about 1,000 pounds.

&gt;    Flight 93 was one of four jets hijacked Sept. 11. Authorities believe
&gt;    the flight, which originated in Newark, New Jersey, and had been
&gt;    destined for San Francisco, was headed for the nation's capital, where
&gt;    the hijackers may have intended to slam it into the White House or the
&gt;    Capitol.

&gt;    Attorney General John Ashcroft and FBI Director Robert Mueller have
&gt;    praised the passengers of that flight, saying it appears their actions
&gt;    in trying to regain control of the aircraft averted a greater tragedy.

&gt;    People who spoke by phone with passengers after the plane was hijacked
&gt;    say that after the passengers found out about the earlier World Trade
&gt;    Center attack, they decided to try to overpower the hijackers.

&gt;    And officials familiar with the flight's cockpit voice recorder say it
&gt;    shows there was a &quot;definite struggle,&quot; which they described as
&gt;    desperate and wild, between hijackers and some of the passengers.

&gt;    All 44 people on board the flight were killed when it slammed into the
&gt;    ground.

The &quot;coroner&quot; quote is out of context which is the only way that
Twoofers can make it sound like they have a case. More than a thousand
emergency workers were in Shanksville. They would all have to be part
of the coverup.

expected to be so minute that radiology and DNA testing may be the
only means of positively identifying the victims.&quot; - Associated

beginning to come,&quot; said Somerset County coroner Wallace
Miller. &quot;It will be quite some time until we can identify whoever
a person might be.&quot; - Associated Press (September 13, 2001)

&quot;Dennis Dirkmaat, a forensic pathologist from Mercyhurst College
in Erie, Pa., said the remains had suffered &quot;extreme
fragmentation&quot; and most would have to be identified through DNA
analysis. He said experts also would use dental records, X-rays,
and fingerprints and footprints.&quot; - Washington Post (September 14,
2001)

&quot;It would be nearly an hour before Miller came upon his first
trace of a body part.some fragment of each of the dead had been

fingerprints.&quot; - Washington Post (May 12, 2002)

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; So what? 95% of the plane was recovered.

&gt; &gt;Hahahahahahahahahahaaaaaaaa

&gt; &gt;About 1/10th of 1% you ignorant screwball.

&gt; [3]  Here's the in the news on 9/24/2001, CNN reports 95% or the aircraft
&gt; was recovered form that hole including both black boxes.

&gt;    FBI finished with Pennsylvania crash site probe

&gt;    SHANKSVILLE, Pennsylvania (CNN) --The FBI announced Monday that its
&gt;    investigation of the site where a hijacked jet slammed into a field
&gt;    here is complete and that 95 percent of the plane was recovered.

&gt;    The federal investigation into the September 11 terrorist attacks
&gt;    continues.

&gt;    Evidence-gathering was halted Saturday afternoon and the pieces of
&gt;    United Airlines Flight 93 that had been recovered were turned over
&gt;    Sunday to the airline, with the exception of the flight data recorder
&gt;    and the voice recorder, which are being held and analyzed by the FBI,
&gt;    according to FBI agent Bill Crowley.

&gt;    Crowley said the biggest piece of the plane that was recovered was a
&gt;    6-by-7-foot piece of the fuselage skin, including about four
&gt;    windows. The heaviest piece, Crowley said, was part of an engine fan,
&gt;    weighing about 1,000 pounds.

&gt;    Flight 93 was one of four jets hijacked Sept. 11. Authorities believe
&gt;    the flight, which originated in Newark, New Jersey, and had been
&gt;    destined for San Francisco, was headed for the nation's capital, where
&gt;    the hijackers may have intended to slam it into the White House or the
&gt;    Capitol.

&gt;    Attorney General John Ashcroft and FBI Director Robert Mueller have
&gt;    praised the passengers of that flight, saying it appears their actions
&gt;    in trying to regain control of the aircraft averted a greater tragedy.

&gt;    People who spoke by phone with passengers after the plane was hijacked
&gt;    say that after the passengers found out about the earlier World Trade
&gt;    Center attack, they decided to try to overpower the hijackers.

&gt;    And officials familiar with the flight's cockpit voice recorder say it
&gt;    shows there was a &quot;definite struggle,&quot; which they described as
&gt;    desperate and wild, between hijackers and some of the passengers.

&gt;    All 44 people on board the flight were killed when it slammed into the
&gt;    ground.

&gt; [4]  Black boxes recovered and analyzed

&gt; The data in the black boxes is consistant with all other evidence. [4].

&gt; See [5] for a short video of what happens to a Phantom jet when it
&gt; hits a wall.  A supersonic combat jet is built MUCH toughter than a
&gt; commercial passeneger hjet.

There is never anything worth while in any thread that contains 9/11

There is no &quot;game&quot; except that which the criminals are playing
on your gullibility.  There are certain parts on all commercial
aircraft which are essentially indestructable... certainly by way
of any &quot;crash&quot;.  These parts are identified by number as belonging
to specific aircraft.  Those parts, in all 911 cases, are missing...
even though paper passports remained.

ENVIRONMENT -- BUSH SCIENCE ADVISER ADMITS
GLOBAL WARMING IS MAN-MADE:

John Marburger, President Bush's science adviser, has told the
BBC that &quot;climate change is now a fact&quot; and that mankind is
&quot;more than 90% likely to blame,&quot; the &quot;starkest warning from the
White House so far about the dangers ahead.&quot;
http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/6994760.stm

Marburger's statements come as Hurricane Humberto hit Texas
this week, accelerating from tropical depression to full-scale
hurricane in record time.
http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/front/5128029.html

&quot;To put this development in perspective, no tropical cyclone in
the historical record has ever reached this intensity at a faster
rate near landfall. It would be nice to know, someday, why this
happened,'' said hurricane specialist James Franklin. As the
Center for American Progress has noted, &quot;Scientists have
determined that warmer water can boost hurricanes' ferocity,
and may even increase their frequency.&quot; If industrial pollution
and global warming are left unchecked, the &quot;forecast is for
severe storm warnings ahead.&quot;

George W. Bush, who is aware of this, has set himself up to declare
martial law and impose a dictatorship if there is ANY natural disaster
in America.

The recently enacted National Security Presidential Directive 51 allows
George Bush to establish an immediate dictatorship, including taking control
of all functions of federal government, state government, municipalities and
private sectors, including at the 'tribal' level,  if there is ANY catastrophic
natural event or terror attack on US soil.

Here's the WH press release.  It's looks official, but it's just a lot of
legal hocus-pocus and double-speak.... the truth comes in the last
paragraph, when we're told that the actual contents of the documents

&quot;A society whose citizens refuse to see and investigate the
facts, who refuse to believe that their government and their
media will routinely lie to them and fabricate a reality
contrary to verifiable facts, is a society that chooses and
deserves the Police State Dictatorship it's going to get.&quot;
