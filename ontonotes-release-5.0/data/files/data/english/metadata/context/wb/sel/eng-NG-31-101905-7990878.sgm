I have made an initial visit to Zions Bank to inquire about a loan to
complete the runway.  The manager over here let me know that they
would be interested in helping us out.  He also stated that there
could be government grant money available to help. I will look into
that this week.  If the club is intrerested we could have him come to
one of the meetings and give us some options to get the runway done.
Just food for thought.

Thanks for digging in....I think we are always interested in listening.
Maybe he could attend our next meeting??? Also, what did he say was the
source of the potential  grant  (i.e., branch of government?)  Thanks again,
Scott

Here is an analysis of loan now vs payoff all next year.

July 9, 2007

Bridgerland RC group.

The question has been raised at prior club meetings to loan the money and finish the runway this year. It was raised again this last meeting on July 5, 2007 by Michael Bullen.

I have run an analysis on loan this year vs. assessment and pay in full next year. I hope this will help those interested in being a part of this decision.

I researched my numbers from the:
Utah Department of Transportation
April 9, 2007 Construction Cost Index Report

The 2003 -2007 is actual asphalt prices from the UDOT report. See the top middle graph titled Const. Cost Index Asphalt Pavement (per ton). See full page in separte attached pdf file. Zoom in for better resolution.

See attached file.

Next I imported data into MS Excel and did a Forecast function for years 2008 through 2010. I also did a standard error function for the same years. I then added and subtracted the error from the forecast to show a range of possible future values. Here is the graph of the UDOT actual and the forecast values for years 2003 through 2010.

See attached file.

The price units are in dollars per ton of asphalt. I mapped these prices and there percent change from year to year onto Scott's rough numbers to finish the runway this year verses a project dollar amount for next year. They matched close to the dollar per ton price and the forecasted price. The following are the numbers.

Year

2005
2006
2007
2008
2009
2010
Yearly % increase

32.4%
28.9%
15.6%
11.7%
11.1%
Runway cost

$  27,000.00
$  38,000.00
$  45,000.00
$  50,269.38
$  55,851.39
$/ton

$     42.37
$          56.11
$          62.09
$          71.75
$          80.15
$          89.05
Increase over prior year

$  11,000.00
$    7,000.00
$    5,269.38
$    5,582.00

Finally I ran two five year loan calculations. One loan at 8% interest and one at 5% interest. Here are the numbers.

Loan amount
$          38,000.00

Loan amount
$          38,000.00
Annual interest rate
8%

Annual interest rate
5%
Loan period in years
5

Loan period in years
5
Start date of loan
September 1, 2007

Start date of loan
September 1, 2007

Monthly payment
$              770.50

Monthly payment
$              717.11
Number of payments
60

Number of payments
60
Total interest
$            8,230.18

Total interest
$            5,026.41
Total cost of loan
$          46,230.18

Total cost of loan
$          43,026.41

The 8% loan would be a wash for total dollars each club person could have to pay. The 5% could save each club member $5026.41 / 40 =  $125.66 each member. This is based on an estimate of approx $1250.00 split amount 40 members.

Some of my thoughts are:

Wait and pay full amount next year:
Pros: no debt risk to the club. It is paid and done with no worries for the next five years.
Cons: heavy one year burden on club members. Inflation could change the numbers by next year.

Loan for 5 years:
Pros: spread the cost per club members over five years instead of one. Removes future inflation risk. Future   club members will help with the purchase of the runway.
Cons: Introduces club loan risk. If obligation is not met land could be lost.

If you have other thoughts please post.

Once again I hope this helps.

Keith,
Thank you for a very easy to understand pro's/con's explanation of the
future runway project.  I think we can have a very productive conversation
on this topic at our August meeting.  I'd ask all club members to study the
options closely and come prepared to discuss your thoughts and concerns.
Thanks again Keith, Scott

Top notch work!  This looks like what we need to make some good decisions.

Thanks,

Keith this was excellent.  How would the calculations change if we had 10 thousand down.  Brad had offered 3k, dad 3k, I would pay my 1250. If we could get a few members to come up with the rest of the 10k how would this change the interest?

Thanks again.

Here is an analysis of loan now vs payoff all next year.

July 9, 2007

Bridgerland RC group.

The question has been raised at prior club meetings to loan the money and finish the runway this year. It was raised again this last meeting on July 5, 2007 by Michael Bullen.

I have run an analysis on loan this year vs. assessment and pay in full next year. I hope this will help those interested in being a part of this decision.

I researched my numbers from the:
Utah Department of Transportation
April 9, 2007 Construction Cost Index Report

The 2003 -2007 is actual asphalt prices from the UDOT report. See the top middle graph titled Const. Cost Index Asphalt Pavement (per ton). See full page in separte attached pdf file. Zoom in for better resolution.

See attached file.

Next I imported data into MS Excel and did a Forecast function for years 2008 through 2010. I also did a standard error function for the same years. I then added and subtracted the error from the forecast to show a range of possible future values. Here is the graph of the UDOT actual and the forecast values for years 2003 through 2010.

See attached file.

The price units are in dollars per ton of asphalt. I mapped these prices and there percent change from year to year onto Scott's rough numbers to finish the runway this year verses a project dollar amount for next year. They matched close to the dollar per ton price and the forecasted price. The following are the numbers.

Year 200520062007200820092010
Yearly % increase 32.4%28.9%15.6%11.7%11.1%
Runway cost  $  27,000.00  $  38,000.00  $  45,000.00  $  50,269.38  $  55,851.39
$/ton  $     42.37  $          56.11  $          62.09  $          71.75  $          80.15  $          89.05
Increase over prior year  $  11,000.00  $    7,000.00  $    5,269.38  $    5,582.00

Finally I ran two five year loan calculations. One loan at 8% interest and one at 5% interest. Here are the numbers.

Loan amount $          38,000.00  Loan amount $          38,000.00
Annual interest rate             8% Annual interest rate             5%
Loan period in years           5 Loan period in years           5
Start date of loanSeptember 1, 2007 Start date of loanSeptember 1, 2007

Monthly payment $              770.50  Monthly payment $              717.11
Number of payments               60 Number of payments              60
Total interest $            8,230.18  Total interest $            5,026.41
Total cost of loan $          46,230.18  Total cost of loan $          43,026.41

The 8% loan would be a wash for total dollars each club person could have to pay. The 5% could save each club member $5026.41 / 40 =  $125.66 each member. This is based on an estimate of approx $1250.00 split amount 40 members.

Some of my thoughts are:

Wait and pay full amount next year:
Pros: no debt risk to the club. It is paid and done with no worries for the next five years.
Cons: heavy one year burden on club members. Inflation could change the numbers by next year.

Loan for 5 years:
Pros: spread the cost per club members over five years instead of one. Removes future inflation risk. Future   club members will help with the purchase of the runway.
Cons: Introduces club loan risk. If obligation is not met land could be lost.

If you have other thoughts please post.

Once again I hope this helps.

I have made an initial visit to Zions Bank to inquire about a loan to
complete the runway. The manager over here let me know that they
would be interested in helping us out. He also stated that there
could be government grant money available to help. I will look into
that this week. If the club is intrerested we could have him come to
one of the meetings and give us some options to get the runway done.
Just food for thought.

Kieth,

There are few things I think you should consider,while you are doing your calculations. The club will most likley loose 15 members over the $125.00 asesment pit area, that will leave 25 so that will make the runway asesment $2000.00 per member  in sted of $1250.00, I would probably pay the $1250.00 but not $2000.00. I bet the $2000.00 asesment would drive away another 10 or so. I think the answer to this runway project is for 10 of you rich guys to each throw in $5000.00 write it off on your taxes and the rest of us club members will love you long time.  Rick

Mike,

I have attached a pdf file. It has 4 different loan tables of multiple loan scenarios starting at $38,000 and decrementing my $2,000 dollar increments. If there is club interest to go this route and some club members are willing to do what they can to reduce the loan amount this table can be a quick look-up reference. I am working with my &quot;financial advisor&quot; (we all now what this means) to see if I can help this year and/or certainly next year.

Rick,

Great input! Please encourage all to come to the August club meeting to vote. Scott and our club leaders are doing a great job and I know that they would appreciate all members to come express their ideas and concerns. Their vote is needed at the meetings. I am impressed with all who attend the meetings and vote. The same concerns you have, are discussed, and more input would be very valuable! More votes would also be very valuable!

I helped a friend who is a club member get signed up to Google groups. He is now involved with the group inputting ideas and casting his vote. If there are any of those that would leave the club due to assessments, please help them sign up for Google groups and become involved.

I believe the club needs all its current members and new members. It would be a loss to the club if people quit because of high assessments. It would be an equal loss if people quit because the promise of a paved runway never happens.

Is there a tax accountant in the club that could put a quick paper or PDF file together to help the members understand the tax deduction on club donations?

Thank you for your input.

Keith Merrill

Next I imported data into MS Excel and did a Forecast function for years 2008 through 2010. I also did a standard error function for the same years. I then added and subtracted the error from the forecast to show a range of possible future values. Here is the graph of the UDOT actual and the forecast values for years 2003 through 2010.

See attached file.

The price units are in dollars per ton of asphalt. I mapped these prices and there percent change from year to year onto Scott's rough numbers to finish the runway this year verses a project dollar amount for next year. They matched close to the dollar per ton price and the forecasted price. The following are the numbers.

Year

2005
2006
2007
2008
2009
2010
Yearly % increase

32.4%
28.9%
15.6%
11.7%
11.1%
Runway cost

$  27,000.00
$  38,000.00
$  45,000.00
$  50,269.38
$  55,851.39
$/ton

$     42.37
$          56.11
$          62.09
$          71.75
$          80.15
$          89.05
Increase over prior year

$  11,000.00
$    7,000.00
$    5,269.38
$    5,582.00

Finally I ran two five year loan calculations. One loan at 8% interest and one at 5% interest. Here are the numbers.

Loan amount
$          38,000.00

Loan amount
$          38,000.00
Annual interest rate
8%

Annual interest rate
5%
Loan period in years
5

Loan period in years
5
Start date of loan
September 1, 2007

Start date of loan
September 1, 2007

Monthly payment
$              770.50

Monthly payment
$              717.11
Number of payments
60

Number of payments
60
Total interest
$            8,230.18

Total interest
$            5,026.41
Total cost of loan
$          46,230.18

Total cost of loan
$          43,026.41

The 8% loan would be a wash for total dollars each club person could have to pay. The 5% could save each club member $5026.41 / 40 =  $125.66 each member. This is based on an estimate of approx $1250.00 split amount 40 members.

Some of my thoughts are:

Wait and pay full amount next year:
Pros: no debt risk to the club. It is paid and done with no worries for the next five years.
Cons: heavy one year burden on club members. Inflation could change the numbers by next year.

Loan for 5 years:
Pros: spread the cost per club members over five years instead of one. Removes future inflation risk. Future   club members will help with the purchase of the runway.
Cons: Introduces club loan risk. If obligation is not met land could be lost.

If you have other thoughts please post.

Once again I hope this helps.

I have made an initial visit to Zions Bank to inquire about a loan to
complete the runway. The manager over here let me know that they
would be interested in helping us out. He also stated that there
could be government grant money available to help. I will look into
that this week. If the club is intrerested we could have him come to
one of the meetings and give us some options to get the runway done.
Just food for thought.

There is no such thing as a free lunch.  But you could take out a personal loan for 1500 to pay for two to three years for a very small amount.  By the way crude oil just went up another 1.43 per barrell. The runway no matter how we piss and moan is not going to get any cheaper.

Kieth,

There are few things I think you should consider,while you are doing your calculations. The club will most likley loose 15 members over the $125.00 asesment pit area, that will leave 25 so that will make the runway asesment $2000.00 per member  in sted of $1250.00, I would probably pay the $1250.00 but not $2000.00. I bet the $2000.00 asesment would drive away another 10 or so. I think the answer to this runway project is for 10 of you rich guys to each throw in $5000.00 write it off on your taxes and the rest of us club members will love you long time.  Rick

Mike,

I have attached a pdf file. It has 4 different loan tables of multiple loan scenarios starting at $38,000 and decrementing my $2,000 dollar increments. If there is club interest to go this route and some club members are willing to do what they can to reduce the loan amount this table can be a quick look-up reference. I am working with my &quot;financial advisor&quot; (we all now what this means) to see if I can help this year and/or certainly next year.

Keith this was excellent.  How would the calculations change if we had 10 thousand down.  Brad had offered 3k, dad 3k, I would pay my 1250. If we could get a few members to come up with the rest of the 10k how would this change the interest?

Thanks again.

Keith,
Thank you for a very easy to understand pro's/con's explanation of the future runway project.  I think we can have a very productive conversation on this topic at our August meeting.  I'd ask all club members to study the options closely and come prepared to discuss your thoughts and concerns.  Thanks again Keith, Scott

Here is an analysis of loan now vs payoff all next year.

July 9, 2007

Bridgerland RC group.

The question has been raised at prior club meetings to loan the money and finish the runway this year. It was raised again this last meeting on July 5, 2007 by Michael Bullen.

I have run an analysis on loan this year vs. assessment and pay in full next year. I hope this will help those interested in being a part of this decision.

I researched my numbers from the:
Utah Department of Transportation
