I wish to thank everyone who so kindly responded to my query regarding
alpaca lines. I've visited and participated on some of the Yahoo
Groups dedicated to alpacas and have been reading up.

So...on Saturday I pick up the first two or four, depending on whether
all four will fit in the back of the minivan (with the third seat
removed). Suris. All males. The first pair are two years old and have
just been gelded. The second pair are about seven months old and will
be gelded. And we're committed to purchasing a third pair of weanlings
around Christmastime.

So begins a new adventure in animal husbandry.

Glad to hear you got some fuzz butts.
But geldings and animal husbandry are not words that are used
together very often.

Let's just say we're getting a crash course in hot weather alpaca
care. &lt;g&gt;

Actually, the breeder kindly spent about two hours with us, giving us
pointers, showing us how to trim hooves, discussing deworming, etc. We
loaded up two yearling alpacas into the back of the minivan and they
milled about for 20 minutes or so and then--for the most part--settled
down for the ride. Talkative little critters.

We unloaded them without fuss and we led the pony into her stall. She
was fascinated by the new critters. The big horses sniffed and whuffed
from the barn gate. The alpacas moved from one horse to the other
horse to the pony and generally everyone indulged in a long round of
sniffing. My mare decided that the alpacas weren't good for eating and
promptly lost interest. The gelding thinks that maybe these could be
play-toys.

Over the past days the alpacas have gotten friendly with the pony,
which is good because the plan is to put them in the 1/2 acre field
with her. When something disturbs them, they gather by her. They pull
hay out of her mouth. She nuzzles them. They nuzzle her. I'd describe
her attitude toward the alpacas as affectionate tolerance.

So, they've settled in nicely. Now if only this brutal, sweltering
heat wave would end...

Not sure where you're at but it's brutal hot down here in southern
missouri
this week.  When it gets this hot we have fans and misters going for
the
llamas.  And plenty of shade and fresh water.

Mr BoJangles discovered his fairly new pond a month or so ago and now
spends a great deal of time wading around in it.  Sometimes the ducks
even join him.

Our heat index is supposed to around 110 all week.

Sometimes horses have odd reactions to llamas and alpacas.  Frightens
the horses.   Glad to hear yours are accepting them especially the
pony

Southern Ohio. Mid 90s with matching humidity. Ugly. We soak the
concrete tiles (barn floor) and have high velocity fans blowing across
them. The alpacas rest in front of the fans. There's a fan in the
pony's stall blowing down at her, too.

Yup, we're relieved it seems to be working out. The Ohio Department of
Natural Resources, I'm told, recently granted camelid owners the right
to hike on bridle trails (in state parks) with their camelids
accompanying them. This could be the beginning of a wonderful,
cooperative trail use relationship or it could be frought with some
very nasty accidents. Let's hope for courtesy and cooperation among
all trail users.

Do what I did.... contact some of the local horse groups and
offer to help desensitize their animals. I even boarded two llamas
at one stable that had rentals. The llamas were in a small pen
near the horses feeding area (but always separate from the
horses). If the horses wanted to eat they had to go near the
llamas. After a few days all were buddies.

Ask about the local &quot;trail trials&quot; group. In several events a
llama and I were an obstacle in their course. I was invited to
the state finals where they gave me a deluxe campsite and fed me,
and the llama, too well. The llama was quite a hit and I think I
convinced a few tough horsemen that these animals are not trail
poodles.

I've owned horses for 25 years and am a member of a local horseman's
club. I've already discussed with the club president an &quot;intro to
camelids&quot; presentation at our September meeting. I wrote and submitted
an article to the Horseman's Corral, a statewide equestrian newspaper
published by the Ohio Horseman's Council (OHC). (No guarantees of
publication, though.) I contacted the president of the OHC with a
notice, too. However, he hasn't responded.

The idea of putting out a couple llamas in a pipe corral near horses
at stables is intriguing. I'll have to think about that one before
approaching the stable owners. There are no livery stables in my area;
all are private breeding, training, and/or boarding stables.

I just sent an invitation this morning to the leader of the local 4-H
camelid club. I think she'll take me up on it. I also offered to visit
the local camelid club (4-H or otherwise) to give an &quot;intro to horses&quot;
presentation. One of the things the camelid people could do to
facilitate acceptance (instead of resentment) is to pitch in and help
with trail/campground building and maintenance. Equestrian trails in
Ohio state parks, for the most part, are built and maintained by
equestrian *volunteers*. Extra hands to help in that work will be
really appreciated. Basically, if camelid owners are going to use the
bridle trails, then they can help maintain them. That will build a
solid, working partnership.

I want to make the trail sharing as cooperative and collaborative as
possible.
