Ima`m Zayn al-'Abidin, peace be on him
The world brightened when Ima`m Zayn al-'Abidin, peace be on him, was born, for he would split the fountain of knowledge and wisdom in the earth. He would also show, through his behavior, wonderful examples of self-negation, renouncing the world, and cleaving to Allah. The Prophet's family was very happy to receive this blessed baby, of whom the Prophet, may Allah bless him and his family, gave good news. All the companions who had good relations with the members of the house (ahl al-Bayt) were happy to hear of the birth of Ima`m Zayn al-'Abidin. Some historians said that the Ima`m was born weak and thin. Sayyid 'Abid al-'Aziz Sayyid al-Ahal said: &quot;He (Zayn al-'Abidin) was born weak and thin. Gleams as faint as dim worry appeared in his eyes. These broken gleams indicated coming grief.1&quot; Misfortunes and pain accompanied him from his childhood. Among them was that his pure mother died while he was still a baby in the cradle.
The Rites of his Birth
Ima`m 'Ali, the Commander of the faithful, peace be on him or his son Ima`m Husayn, peace be on him hurried to perform the religious rites of birth for the blessed baby; he said the aza`n in his right ear and the iqama in his left year. With this he established in his heart a temple beating with the feelings of piety and righteousness. They were active tunes directing him to kindness and good deeds.The first thing with which Ima`m Zayn al-'Abidin was received was the words Allahu Akbar (Allah is Great)! These words were____________1. Al-Imam Zayn 'al-Abidin, p. 18.
printed in his heart and senses, so they became some of his qualities. On the seventh day of his birth, his father sacrificed a ram for him (in the ceremony of a’qiqa), cut his hair and gave silver or gold as equal to its weight as alms to the poor and needy according to the holy Islamic Sunna.
The Place of his Birth
The historians differed over the place where Ima`m Zayn al-'Abidin was born. The following are what they have mentioned:(A) He was born in Ku`fa.1(B) He was born in Medina.2I (the author) think that he was born in Ku`fa. This is because the narrators and the historians mentioned that he was born two years before the death of his grandfather, the Commander of the faithful, peace be on him.3 It is certain that Ima`m al-Husayn and his family were in Ku`fa along with Ima`m 'Ali, the Commander of the faithful, peace be on him. None of them lived in Medina throughout his succession (to authority).
The Time of his Birth
The historians differed over the time when Ima`m Zayn al-'Abidin was born. The following are what they have mentioned:(A) He was born on the fifth day of Sha'ba`n in the year 38 A.H.4 That was on Thursday.5(B) He was born on Friday on the ninth of Sha'ba`n in the year 38 A. H.6(C) He was born in the half of Jama`di al-'Ula` in the year 38 A. H.7____________1. Shadharat al-Dhahab, vol. 1, p. 104.2. Ibn al-Sabbagh, al-Fusul al-Muhimma, p. 187.3. Akhbar al-Diwal, p. 109.4. Ibn al-Sabbagh, al-Fusul al-Muhimma, p. 212.5. Nur al-abbsar, p. 136.6. Roudat al-Wa'izin, vol. 1, p. 222.7. Bahr al-Ansab, p. 52.(D) He was born on Friday the 26th of Jama`di al-Akhira in the year 38 A.H.1(E) He was born in the months of the year 33 A. H.2 This idea is irregular and opposes the narrators and the historians who mentioned that the Ima`m was born in the year 38 A. H.The Ima`mi Shi'ites have adopted the first idea, and they hold their public festivals on the fifth of Sha'ba`n to celebrate Ima`m Zayn al-'Abidin's birth.
His Name
The historians and the narrators unanimously agreed that the greatest Prophet, may Allah bless him and his family, named his grandson 'Ali b. al-Husayn and gave him the surname of Zayn al-'Abidin. That was ten years before he was created, and that was among the wonderful signs of his prophecy. The accounts have been frequently reported on his authority. The following are some of them:1.The great Companion Ja`bir b. 'Abd Allah al-Ansa`ri reported: &quot;While I was sitting with Allah's Apostle, may Allah bless him and his family, he put al-Husayn on his lap and played with him, and then he, may Allah bless him and his family, said: 'Ja`bir, a son will be born for him, and the son will be called 'Ali. A caller will call out on the Day of Judgment: 'Let Sayyid al-'Abidin (the Lord of worshippers) stand up.' So his son will stand up. Then a son will be born for him, and the son will be named Mohammed. When you meet him, recite my greetings to him.3'&quot; Ja`bir proclaimed this tradition, and he also met Ima`m Mohammed al-Ba`qir, peace be on him, and recited these greetings to him, and the latter was delighted with them.2. Al-Ha`fiz b. 'Asa`kir reported on the authority of Sufya`n b. 'Ayyina, on the authority of b. al-Zubayr, who said: &quot;While we were____________1. Al-Imama fi al-Islam, p. 116.2. Al-Nafha al-'Anbariya.3. Wasilat al-Mal fi 'ADD Manaqib al-Al, p. 7.
(sitting) with Ja`bir, 'Ali b. al-Husayn came. Ja`bir said to him: 'When I was (sitting) with Allah's Apostle, may Allah bless him and his family, al-Husayn came to him. He (the Prophet) embraced him (al-Husayn), kissed him, sat him beside him, and said: 'A son will be born for this (i.e., al-Husayn), and a caller will call out on the Day of Judgment: 'Let Sayyid al-'Abidin (the Lord of worshippers) stand up, and he will stand up.1&quot;3. Sa'id b. al-Musayyab reported on the authority of b. 'Abba`s, on the authority of Allah's Apostle, may Allah bless him and his family, who said: &quot;A caller will call out on the Day of Judgment: 'Where is 'Ali b. al-Husayn?' I will see my grandson 'Ali b. al-Husayn appear from among the ranks.2&quot;These are some of the traditions which were narrated on the authority of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and his family. They show that the Prophet named his grandson 'Ali and gave him the nick name of Zayn al-'Abid in (the adornment of the worshippers), and they also show that the Ima`m has an important position with Allah, the Glorified.
Ibn Taymiya
Ibn Taymiya denied that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and his family, gave this name to his grandson 'Ali, and he said: &quot;This thing has no source, and the knowledgeable people have not narrated it.3&quot; However, Ibn Taymiya did not want to mention what the main narrators and historians reported, for he deviated from the truth and showed enmity towards the members of the House (ahl al-Bayt) , peace be on them, whose love Allah has made obligatory, and whom the Prophet, may Allah bless him and his family, made life boats and security for mankind. Besides he denied all their outstanding merits and deeds which the historians have narrated.____________1. Tarikh Dimashq, vol. 36, p. 142.2. Ilal al-Sharaiya', p. 87. Bihar al-Anwar, vol. 46, p. 3.3. Minhajj al-Sunna, vol. 2, p. 123.
His Kunya
Ima`m Zayn al-'Abidin, peace be on him, was given the Kunya of:1. Abu` al-Husayn.2. Abu` al-Hasan.3. Abu` Mohammed.14. Abu` 'Abd Allah.2
His Nick Names
As for his nick names, they show his good inclinations, his excellent qualities, his noble morals, his obedience and worship to Allah. The following are some of them:
1. Zayn al-'Abidin
His grandfather Allah's Apostle, may Allah bless him and his family, gave him this nick name, namely Zayn al-'Abidin or the Ornament of the worshippers, as we have already mentioned. The Ima`m was given this nick name because of he worshipped Allah abundantly.3 He his known and famous for this nick name, which has become his name. No one before or after him has been given this nick name. Indeed he is the ornament of the worshippers and pride of those who obey Allah, the Glorified.
2. Sayyid al-'Abidin
Among his prominent nick names is Sayyid al-'Abidin or the Lord of the worshippers, for he yield to Allah and obeyed Him, and no one worshipped Allah as he did except his grandfather, the Commander of the faithful, peace be on him.____________1. Nur al-Abbsar, p. 137.2. Tarikh al-Islam, vol. 2, p. 66.3. Tahdhib al-Tahdhib, vol. 7, p. 306. Shadharat al-Dhahab, vol. 1, p. 104.
3. Dhu` al-Thafana`t
He was given the nick name of Dhu` al-Thafana`t or the one with calluses because something like the calluses of the camel appeared on the parts on which he prostrated.1 Ima`m Abu` Ja'far al-Ba`qir, peace be on him, said: &quot;My father had prominent marks on the places on which he prostrated, and he cut them twice a year: (He) cut five calluses every time, so he was called Dhu` al-Thafana`t (the one with calluses)2.&quot; In another narration it is said that he collected his calluses in a bag and asked his children to bury them with him.
4. Al-Sajja`d
Among his holy nick names for which he is famous is Al-Sajja`d. or the one who constantly prostrated himself in prayer. He prostrated himself in prayer to Allah and obeyed him more than the people did. Ima`m Abu` Ja'far al-Ba`qir, peace be on him, talked about the constant prostration of his father, saying: &quot;When 'Ali b. al-Husayn mentioned Allah's favors toward him, he prostrated himself in prayer. (When he) read a verse with prostration of the Book of Allah, the Great and Almighty, he prostrated himself in prayer. When Allah drove away from him a misfortune which he was afraid of, he prostrated himself in prayer. (When he) finished his obligatory prayers, he prostrated himself in prayer. The marks of prostration were prominent on the parts on which he prostrated, so he was called al-Sajja`d.3&quot; Ibn Hamma`d composed a poem about the constant prostration and worship of the Ima`m. The following are some lines of the poem:The monk of ahl al-Bayt w as and is still given the nickname of al-Sajja`d because of his worship.He spent his days fasting, to turn to Allah____________1. Subha al-A-Shi'a, vol. 1, p. 452. Bahr al-Ansab, p. 25. Tuhaf al-Raghib, p. 13.2. 'Illal al-Sharaiya', p. 88 4. Wasa'il al-Shi'a, vol. vol. 4, p. 977. 'Illal al-Sharaiya' p. 88.
in repentance, and he passed his night with night prayer.Therefore, who is strong enough to perform his knowledgeand his faithfulness, and who is strong enough to performhis piety and worship?.1
5. Al-Zaki
He was given the nick name of al-Zaki or the pure one because Allah purified him, as He took away uncleanness from his grandfathers and purified them completely.
6. Al-Amin
Among his holy nick names for which he is famous is al-Amin or the trusted one.2 He was ideal for this noble quality, so he, peace be on him, said: &quot;If the killer of my father deposited with me the sword with which he killed him, I would give it to him.&quot;
7. Ibn al-Khiyaratayn
Another of his holy nick names for which he is famous is Ibn al-Khiyaratayn or the son of the best two. He was proud of this nick name and said: &quot;I am the son of the best two.&quot; He referred to the words of his grandfather, Allah's Apostle, may Allah bless him and his family, who said: &quot;Allah, the Glorified, has the best two from among His servants, so His best one from among the Arabs is Ha`shim and from among non-Arabs is the Persians.3&quot; Al-Shabbra`wi ascribed to him these lines in which he has shown his pride of this nick name:The choice of Allah among men is my father after mygrandfather, and I am the son of the best two.Silver was formed from gold, therefore I am the silver,____________1. Al-Manaqib.2. Ibn al-Sabbagh, Al-Fusul al-Muhimma, p. 187. Bahr al-Ansab, p. 52. Nur al-Abbsar, 137.3. Al-Mubarrad, al-Kamil, vol. 1, p. 222. Ibn Khullakan, Wafayat al-A'yan, vol. 2, p. 429.the son of the two golden ones.Who has a grandfather like my grandfather or (father) likemy father from mankind? I am the son of the two moons.Fa`tima the chaste is my mother, and my father is the onewho destroyed the unbelievers at Badr and Hunayn, andwho took part at the battle of Uhud, which quenched thethirst of one of the two armies.1I (the author) firmly believe that these lines do not belong to Ima`m Zayn al-'Abidin, rather they belong to his father, for they are clear in showing this.These are some of his nick names, other nick names have been mentioned for him.2 They show his excellent qualities and his great inclinations.
His Physical Qualities
The historians have mentioned the Ima`m's physical features and qualities as follows: &quot;'Ali b. al-Husayn was brown, short, thin, and gentle.2&quot; When he became old, he became thin and weak. This is because he worshipped Allah constantly. Moreover, the tragedy of Karbala`' drowned him in sorrow and pain, for its terrors accompanied him till he met the Highest Comrade (i.e. Allah).
His Solemnity
The Ima`m's face shined with the light of the prophets. Hence the faces and foreheads yielded to his solemnity. Al-Farazdaq, the greatest Arab poet, described his solemnity in his wonderful ode, saying:When he comes to touch the corner of the wall of theKaaba, it almost grasps the palm of his hand.____________1. Imam Zayn 'al-'Abidin, p. 19.2. Nur al-Abbsar, p. 36. Akhbar al-Diwal, p. 109. Al-Sirat al-Sawi fi Manaqib al-Nabi, p. 192.He takes care to be modest and he is protected from histerror.He only speaks when he smiles.Al-Shaykha`ni al-Qa`diri said: &quot;The beholders were fixed in gaze at the handsomeness of his face.1&quot; His solemnity was similar to that of his grandfather, the greatest Prophet, may Allah bless him and his family. Muslim b. 'Aqaba( who was criminal, blood-thirsty, violated all Islamic values and manners( admired his solemnity. When he saw the I ma`m, he shook with fear. Hence he received him warmly, treated him kindly, honored him, and said to those around him: &quot;Indeed 'Ali Zayn al-'Abidin has the qualities of the prophets.&quot;
The Inscription of his Ring
As for the inscription of his ring, it showed that the Ima`m depended on Allah in all his affairs. The inscription of his ring read: &quot;My success is not but by Allah.2 It was said that the inscription of his ring was: &quot;You have known, therefore do.3&quot;____________1. Al-Sirat al-Sawi fi Manaqib Al al-Nabi, p. 192.2. Ibn al-Sabbagh, al-Fusul al-Muhimma, p. 187. Akhbar al-Diwal, p. k109. Al-Sirat al-Sawi fi Manaqib Al al-Nibi, p. 192.3. Ibn Qutayba, Uyyun Akhbar, vol. 1, 302.
His Behavior in his House
Ima`m Zayn al-'Abidin, peace be on him, was the most merciful of all the people and the kindest of them to the members of his house. He did not distinguish himself from them, rather he was one of them. It was reported on his authority that he said: &quot;To buy meat from the market with the dirhams which are on me for my family when they long for meat is more lovable for me than freeing a slave.2&quot; He went out early in the morning to seek the daily bread of his family. He was asked: &quot;Where do you go?&quot; He replied: &quot;I go to seek alms for my____________1. Al-Bihar, vol. 46, p. 66. Qutb al-Rawandi, al-Da'wat.2. Al-Bihar, vol. 46, p. 67.family by seeking lawful daily bread because it is (the daily bread) is alms from Allah, the Great and Almighty, for them.1&quot; He helped his family in meeting their needs. He did not order anyone of them to carry out his personal affairs; he performed them himself, especially if it concerned the affairs of his worship; he did not ask anyone of them to perform them.The Ima`m's behavior toward his household was unique; he behaved exceptionally with his family. His behavior was full of mercy, cooperation, kindness, and self-negation.
His Kindness to his Nursemaid
When Ima`m Zayn al-'Abidin, peace be on him, grew up, he found out that his mother died, that his nursemaid treated him kindly in order to seek nearness to Allah. As a result he treated her with great kindness to the extent that he prevented from eating with her. The people blamed him for that and asked him frequently: &quot;You are the kindest of all the people and the best of them in taking care of your blood relatives, so why do you not eat with your mother?&quot; He replied to them with great politeness: &quot;I fear that I stretch out my hand for what she stretches out her hand for.2, then I am disobedient to her.3&quot;Which humanity is similar to this humanity? Which angelic soul is this soul? It is sufficient for this Ima`m that he is the son of al-Husayn, who filled the world with his honor and perfection.

His Behavior toward his Shi'ites
Ima`m Zayn al-'Abidin, peace be on him, wanted his Shi'ites to be an excellent example for mankind in their piety, devotion, and cleaving to religion, so he did his best to educate them with high Islamic manners. He preached to them, gave them commandments, and urged them to cling to piety and good deeds, so he, peace be on him, said to one of his Shi'ites: &quot;Inform our Shi'ites that nothing will avail them before Allah, and that no one will obtain our intercession but through piety.2&quot;Indeed, refraining from what Allah has prohibited is among the most important ways that man is saved from the chastisement and punishment of Allah, and it is also among the most successful ways that leads man to obtain the intercession of the members of the House (ahl al-Bayt) , peace be on them, which is one of Allah's forts.A group of people came to Ima`m Zayn al-'Abidin, peace be on him, and told him that they belonged to his Shi'ites, so the Ima`m considered their faces carefully but did not see on them the marks of righteousness, so he said to them: &quot;Where are the marks of the faces? Where are the marks of worship? Where are the marks of prostration (in prayer)? Indeed our Shi'ites are known by their worship and their shaggy hair. Worship injures the inner corners of their eyes, their foreheads, and their limbs of prostration. Their 'Abdomens are hollow, and their lips are withered. They glorify Allah when the people keep silent, and they perform the prayers when the people____________1. Bahjat al-Abrar.2. Al-Durr al-Nazim, p. 173.sleep. They are sad when the people are happy. They are known by asceticism. And Paradise distract them (from this world).1&quot;These qualities which the Ima`m, peace be on him, concern the special Shi'ites and the followers of the Ima`ms, peace be on them, such as 'Amma`r b. Ya`sir, Abu` Dharr, Salma`n al-Fa`risi, Maytham al-Tamma`r, and the like, whose souls were full of piety and righteousness, and who understood the message of Islam. As for the overwhelming majority of the Shi'ites, they are the lovers and followers of the members of the House (ahl al-Bayt) , peace be on them. It is worth mentioning that following the Ima`ms, peace be on them, brings about forgiveness. This can be indicated through the following tradition which has been reported on his authority. When he became ill, a group of the Companions of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and his family, came to visit him and asked him: &quot;Son of the Apostle of Allah, may our souls be ransom for you, how are you?&quot; &quot;I am very well,&quot; replied the Ima`m, &quot;I am grateful to Allah for that, and how are you?&quot; &quot;We are very well,&quot; they answered, &quot;Son of the Apostle of Allah, we love you and follow you.&quot; So the Ima`m gave them good news of Heaven because they loved and followed the members of the House (ahl al-Bayt) , peace be on the m, saying: &quot;Whoever loves us for Allah, Allah will make him dwell in a very shady place on the Day of Resurrection, the day when there will be no shade except His shade. Whoever loves to reward us, Allah will give him Heaven as a reward. Whoever loves us for this world, Allah will give him his livelihood from where he does not expect.2&quot;
