Cheney Slams Iraq Plan Advocated by Dems

Feb 21, 9:13 PM (ET)

By TERENCE HUNT

WASHINGTON (AP) - Vice President Dick Cheney on Wednesday harshly
criticized Democrats' attempts to thwart President Bush's troop buildup in
Iraq, saying their approach would "validate the al-Qaida strategy." House
Speaker Nancy Pelosi fired back that Cheney was questioning critics'
patriotism.

Nonsense!  Vice President Cheney is questioning her JUDGMENT.  -- DSH

"I hope the president will repudiate and distance himself from the
vice president's remarks," Pelosi said. She said she tried to complain about
Cheney to President Bush but could not reach him.

Hilarious!  -- DSH

"You cannot say as the president of the United States, 'I welcome
disagreement in a time of war,' and then have the vice president of the
United States go out of the country and mischaracterize a position of the
speaker of the House and in a manner that says that person in that position
of authority is acting against the national security of our country," the
speaker said.

Baloney!  Dick Cheney has done it and it is quite true.  Nancy Pelosi has
poor judgment in these matters.  -- DSH

The quarrel began in Tokyo, where Cheney used an interview to
criticize Pelosi and Rep. John Murtha, D-Pa., over their plan to place
restrictions on Bush's request for an additional $93 billion for the Iraq
war to make it difficult or impossible to send 21,500 extra troops to Iraq.

"I think if we were to do what Speaker Pelosi and Congressman Murtha
are suggesting, all we will do is validate the al-Qaida strategy," the vice
president told ABC News. "The al-Qaida strategy is to break the will of the
American people ... try to persuade us to throw in the towel and come home,
and then they win because we quit."

Right!  Just as the Democrats forced us to do in Vietnam, indeed in Laos and
Cambodia as well. --  DSH

In the interview, Cheney also said Britain's plans to withdraw about
1,600 troops from Iraq - while the United States adds more troops - was a
positive step. "I look at it and see it is actually an affirmation that
there are parts of Iraq where things are going pretty well," the vice
president said.

Pelosi, at a news conference in San Francisco, said Cheney's criticism
of Democrats was "beneath the dignity of the debate we're engaged in and a
disservice to our men and women in uniform, whom we all support."

Nonsense.  You can't support the men and women in uniform unless you support
their MISSION. -- DSH

"And you know what I'm going to do? I'm going to call the president
and tell him I disapprove of what the vice president said," Pelosi said. "It
has no place in our debate." Bush had previously urged her to call him when
a member of his administration stepped over the line by questioning
Democrats' patriotism, she said.

Later, Pelosi said she had tried to reach the president but was only
able to get through to White House chief of staff Josh Bolten.

Hilarious! -- DSH

Bolten said he was certain no one was questioning her patriotism or
commitment to national security, she told reporters.

"I said to him perhaps when he saw what the vice president said he
might have another comment," Pelosi said. White House deputy press secretary
Dana Perino said Cheney "was not questioning anyone's patriotism." But she
said Bush and Cheney believe that Pelosi and Murtha's "position to
immediately pull out our troops would be harmful to our national security
and that it is the wrong strategy to pursue."

As for Cheney's assertion that the partial British pullout is a sign
that things are going well in Iraq, Pelosi said: "If it's going so well,
we'd like to withdraw our troops as well."

That's quite stupid.  She obviously doesn't understand the salient
differences in security in the Shi'a South and the Sunni Center of  Iraq.
Some Basic Lessons in Iraqi factions are urgently needed by Speaker Nancy
Pelosi. -- DSH

Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., chairman of the Senate Armed Service
Committee, said Britain's withdrawal, coupled with Denmark's announcement
to pull out its 460 troops by August, "accelerates the breakup of the
coalition in Iraq."

Twaddle! -- DSH

He said the United States should reduce its forces "as a way of
pressuring the Iraqis to take responsibility for their own future and to
reach the political settlements that are essential to end the sectarian
violence and defeat the insurgency."

Playing right into Al Q'aeda's hands. -- DSH

Administration leaders, however, said Britain's decision was good
news.

"The British have done what is really the plan for the country as a
whole, which is to transfer security responsibility to the Iraqis as the
situation permits," Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said at a news
conference in Berlin, where she was in meetings on the Mideast peace
process.

Precisely! -- DSH

National security adviser Stephen Hadley, at NATO headquarters in
Brussels, said the decision "reflects the progress that has been made on the
ground in Basra and in the south," where British troops were stationed.

Indeed.  There was always a lesser threat in that area -- and the British
have done a fine job of the task they undertook.  -- DSH

"So this is basically a good news story, an indication that progress
is being made, and that events on the ground permit this kind of adjustment
in forces," Hadley said. Still, he acknowledged the violence in Baghdad and
said, "I'm not saying this is an unalloyed picture of progress."

He's just down the road here in Sydney (that's in Australia, Merkans)
tonight - there's a HUGE welcoming party out.
The police are trying to keep them back saying they were 'surprised at the
numbers' and ' the protests were not authorised'.
I think that makes it spontaneous.
The police think that makes it a riot.
I doubt such dreadfully anti-war...er... I mean...anti-American scenes will
be permitted on US TV.

I heard 20,000 but then we don't have the same kind of democracy.
It's probably all just more anti-American propaganda which is still at least
tolerated here.
The *real* protest will come at the election. Howard's support for the
neocon's phony 'war' and expansionism is about as popular here is it is in
the UK and, like Blair, Howard has destroyed his party's prospects. The
polls have seen him drop another 8% since he sided with the war criminal in
chief only last week.
For the first time a big majority of Aussies see Rudd (the opposition
leader) as more suited to being Prime Minister.
For my part, I've seen *****ing Wallabies that are more suited to being
Prime Minister.
Yeah!
Vote Skippy for leader!
At least he's got some charisma and a decent vocabulary.

Ap and Reuters are reporting the police figures.
I don't know how many there were - roughly the same number that cheered on
the felling of that statue of Saddam I reckon.
How many was that do you think?
It's difficult to protest here in Oz - the guys and girls that did so are a
brave hard-core. There is no right to protest as such - you have to get
'permission' or the police will just beat the crap out of you. Which they
did of course. They are much more violent here than even in the UK - just
uniformed thugs really. Also it's carrying on again today in various places.
There have been more protests and more 'arrests'.
Cheney is held in such regard that he had to travel in a bullet-proof car
with a 30 car escort!
Unheard of here.
This is to protect him from any one of the hundreds of millions of
'terrorists' worldwide who for some reason think he is a war-criminal and
believe the world would be a far, far better place if someone put a half
dozens lumps of lead in his fat guts.
The whole centre of the city was brought to a standstill as they cleared a
safe passage for him and switched all the traffic lights to red for everyone
else. I know this is normal practice to protect your beloved 'leaders' in
the US but even Howard (not a popular man) can still travel more or less
freely here. Not so Cheney.
But then Howard is a charisma-free, snivelling little yes-man and is nowhere
near as culpable for the neocons murderous phoney 'war on terror' and all
the as yet undreamt of consequences of their disgusting power lust and
greed.
Cheney is probably the second most hated man in Australia right now - and
rightly so.

&gt; red for everyone else. I know this is normal practice to protect your
&gt; beloved 'leaders' in the US but even Howard (not a popular man) can
&gt; still travel more or less freely here. Not so Cheney.
&gt; But then Howard is a charisma-free, snivelling little yes-man and is
&gt; nowhere near as culpable for the neocons murderous phoney 'war on
&gt; terror' and all the as yet undreamt of consequences of their
&gt; disgusting power lust and greed.
&gt; Cheney is probably the second most hated man in Australia right now -
&gt; and rightly so.

Are the television stations showing footage of the protests?

&gt;&gt; I think that makes it spontaneous.

&gt; And just think, Adam, if something happened to Bush, he's the guy that

&gt; scan some photos for SCS after you get back from the parade?

&gt;&gt; I doubt such dreadfully anti-war...er... I mean...anti-American scenes
&gt;&gt; will be permitted on US TV.

&gt; Of course it will be on TV, Adam. We live in a free and democratic

Cheney got very wealthy when he was given the top job at
Halliburton company. He knew nothing about the business and one of the
first things he did was push through a merger with a firm that
unbeknownst to him had large liabilities looming from some class
action lawsuits.
Anybody could have done some "due diligence" and learned of the
situation and avoided the damage it did to Halliburton. Does that ring
a familiar chord?
