THIS is the guy who wrote "Hamlet" (suppposedly)?

[=10] Cecil Papers 9/1 (bifolium, 300mm x 205mm), Oxford to Burghley;
27 April [1576] (W121;F248-9).

Mi lord, all thought [=although] I have forborne, in sume respect,
whiche I hould priuat to my self ether to write ore come vnto yowre
Lordshipe, yet had I determined, as oportunitie should haue serued me,
to haue acomplished the same in compas of a feue dayes.

But now vrged therunto by yowre letters, to satisfie yow the soner, I
must let yowre Lordship vnderstand thus muche.

That is vntill I can better satisfie or aduertise miself of sume
mislekes, I am not determined as touchinge my wife to accompanie here
[=her]. What they are because sume are not to be spoken of or written
vpon as imperfections I will not deale withall, sume that otherwayes
discontent me I will not blas [=blaze] ore publishe vntill it pleas
me. and last of all I mean not to werie my life any more withe suche
trobles and molestationes as I haue endured nor will I to please yowre
Lordship only, discontent my self. Wherfore as yowre Lordship veri
well writethe vnto me that yow mean if it standethe withe my lekinge
[that] to receiue her in to yowre howse, thes are lekwise to let yowre
Lordship vnderstand that it dothe veri well content me, for there as
yowre doughter or her mothers more then my wife yow may take comfort
of her and I rid of the comber therby, shall remaine well eased of
many griefes. I doo not dought but she hathe sufficient proportion for
her beinge to liue vpon and to maintaine herself. This myght haue bene
done throwght [=through] priuat conference before and had not neded to
haue bene the fable of the world yf yow wowld haue had the patience to
haue vnderstood me, but I doo not know by what ore whose aduise it
was, to rune that course so contrarie to my will or meaninge, whiche
made her disgraced, [too?] the world reised suspitions openly, that
withe priuate conference myght haue bene more silently handled, and
hathe giuen me more greater cause to misleke. Wherfore I desire yowre
Lordship in thes causes now yow shall vnderstand me not to vrge me any
farther. and so I write vnto yowre Lordship as yow haue done vnto me.
this friday the 27h of Aprill.

Yowre Lordships to be vsed in all thinges resonable.

This is a good example of evidence that Oxford, who never
claimed to be Shakespeare and who was only the perfect English
feudal earl for four hundred years until he underwent criminal
disneyfication by Looney, did not write the Shakespeare works.

Here's a link to a post I wrote that shows that Looney went a
step further to redact and rewrite Oxford's primary documents to
make them look Shakespearean.

That would have gotten Looney booted out of academia had he been
an academic but the Oxfordians seem to think this kind of
misrepresentation
of Oxford is perfectly ok.

PROFESSOR 'IGGINS: Looney Redacts 361 Words From Oxford's Letter.

&lt; http://groups.google.com/group/humanities.lit.authors.shakespeare/msg/
ae831f5fbc6c0a6a?hl=en&amp;&gt;

I would add that the Oxfordians have never done any criticism,
deconstruction, close reading, textual criticism, analytical
criticism
or 'nothin of Oxford's primary documents.

For that reason their claims to 'scholarship' need not be taken
seriously.

The thread linked above may have a different header since
Neuendorffer  jumped right in and changed the name of the thread to
'WITH MUCH ADOO.'

Oxford had more character than the Oxfordians.

I am not Elizabeth, and I don't like the thing. I like to SEE where
a link is going...

besides, it's more...authentic. More like the old net.
Not just the frequently stupid web.

Only reason I can see to change addresses,
is for  giving the address to people not used to the older ones.

I like to too but long URLS that must be pasted together
to click on are a royal pain and *in those cases*
it is a courtesy to the reader for the writer to go
to the added effort to create a tiny URL.
