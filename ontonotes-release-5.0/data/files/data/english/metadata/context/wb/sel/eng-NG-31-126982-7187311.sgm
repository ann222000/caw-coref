There isn't anything more magical than producing the 4 aces out of
someone elses deck of cards, and there is really only one trick to
doing it.  You just get everyone playing with the same deck of cards.
Hopefully blue bicycle decks, but you should be prepared to play with
red bicycle decks too.  Those are the ones everyone seems to like the
best.

So all you need to do is walk around with the 4 aces on you at all
times.  In your pockets, stuck up your sleeves, or sewed to the
underside of your shirt that you wear loose without a belt.  So the
next time you meet a few people playing a game of cards, you just take
their deck with your right hand, and under the cover of whatever table
you are playing at, you quickly sneak the 4 aces on top of the deck as
fast as you can.  And imediately begin to do false shuffling.

If all of your attention is on your right hand, and you do a bit of a
flourish with the cards, then no one sees your left hand coming.  So
you have to practice and practice the move until your left hand gets
natural, because you are probably right handed.  As soon as you start
the false shuffle, you do an overhand shuffle and using your right
hand, you start dealing the 4 aces you snuck on top back into your
left hand.  This is an added subtlety, because it makes your left hand
automatically look empty, because they can see you dealing cards into
it with an overhand shuffle.

When you finish the overhand shuffle the four aces will be on the
bottom.  So now you will want to do a quick overhand card cut.  You
just deal off a third of the deck into your left hand, and as you go
to complete the cut, you pick the cards you just dropped up behind the
remaining stack you are dropping off.  You drop off another third, and
now you have two seperate piles in your right hand.  To keep the 4
aces on the bottom, you drop off the front pile ontop of the cards in
your left hand, and drop off the back pile behind the cards in your
right hand.

Now you do a false riffle shuffle, just like you normally would,
making sure to leave the four aces on the very bottom.  After you do
this, do a full overhand shuffle to keep the cards on the top, then do
another false overhand cut.  This time when you do the false overhand
cut, you can drop the packets off in a different order.

You drop off the first packet, pick it back up, and drop off the
middle packet.  Now you drop off the end packet on top of the middle
packet, and finally you leave the top packet back on top.

So now we are going to do an injog shuffle which looks really
natural.  You just do a little overhand cut, leaving the four aces on
the top of the stack, and begin to cover up the four aces.  But as you
do this, guard the end of the card with your pinky, and drop the first
card on top, over your pinky.  Then just deal the remaining cards on
top in large packets, and finally make a cut, by pulling up with your
thumb where the injog is.  It helps if the packet on the bottom that
contains the four aces is rather small, so it looks like your cutt is
natural.

After you do this, make another riffle shuffle, leaving the top cards
on top.  And you can continue doing these moves in whatever order you
like until you are sure the deck is shuffled as good as it is going to
get.  You need to practice and practice these false shuffles until the
routine is perfectly natural.

The next trick is figuring out how you want to present the production
of the four aces.  With a borrowed deck of cards, the natural thing to
do is to just flip over the top of the deck.  But you could do it so
many other ways.

The way I am learning is to do a little mathematical trick that
appears to be shuffling.  You brake the deck up into four piles, with
the last pile having all of the aces.

Then you just deal 3 cards off the top of each pile and put them on
the bottom of that stack.  And deal 3 cards off the top of each stack
and deal one on top of the other stacks.  Done correct this little
math game will move all 4 aces one on to the top of each stack.  So
when you turn them over it seems like a miracle.

The only thing to do next is to steal away the four aces, and give the
deck back to your friends to see if they can figure out how you did
it.  That's the hardest part, but if you have another trick to do
next, you can take the time to work them out of the deck if you can
misdirect them, and think it through.
