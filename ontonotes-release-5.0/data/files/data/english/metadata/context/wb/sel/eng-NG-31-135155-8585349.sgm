I just got an eMac that was barely used.  They bought it for a
business and couldn't figure out how to make Quickbooks run on it.  It
sat for most of its five years.  Their daughter put some mp3's on it
and played them and that is about it.  This is a 700/40/640meg/combo
drive configuration with the eStand, standard Pro keyboard and Pro
mouse.  I got this with all the original disks, 10.2 updgrade disks
and a new still in the package Office 2004 Standard Edition.  I got it
bumped to 10.4 with a copy I had.  Given this info, was 200 bucks a
fair price for all this?  I love this thing and it does everything I
need it to.  I was just wondering if I got a good deal.  I tried to
play hard ball and act like I didn't care if I bought it or not.  It
might have helped if I wasn't drooling and looking at it all googly
eyed.  LOL

Hi, I love eMacs and wish Apple would come out with something like
them again!

You said: &quot;I got it bumped to 10.4 with a copy I had&quot;.
I  hope you meant that you had a Legal, full retail version of Tiger
10.4 with the black label, family pack!
Installing a gray label versioon for a different Mac is not the best
idea:
From Apple; Not All OS Discs will work on all Macs:
http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=25784 and
http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=25497

And from another forum:

Apple used something called an &quot;enabler&quot; (system enabler) that keyed the
OS to a specific computer model.

But the enabler was also used to add support for a hardware computer
model that was in development when the OS version was released and
the enabler made a specific version compatible with a newer model Mac.

Keyed OS versions is also a way to reduce some of the problems seen
when folks try to install a very new OS version on a computer that is
too old to support many of the features. Things like adequate RAM,
video card requirements, connectivity technologies like the change
from ADB to USB and FireWire, and more.

Apple uses a different system and update model than Microsoft. As
seen with the recent Vista release that took 5 years to produce and
comes in ten versions, the Mac OS has always been a single and more
universal version that is much more frequently updated by Apple. The
updates are used to not only fix problems and bugs but to add ability
to deal with new technologies that come out.

Updates for Tiger are grouped into two different categories: intel &amp;
PPC.

This may be helpful, too:

You lucky dog!  Why can't I ever stumble upon a bargain like that?  I really
need to upgrade from this 2001 Snow iMac G3...

Actually, what I have is a bit more esoteric than that.  The copy
isn't illegal.  I bought a G3/400 from a guy who had bought 10.4.  He
burned a backup copy of the dvd for safe keeping.  Needless to say,
the original disk had some severe issues.  His dog mistook it for a
chew toy.  He offered me the shredded remains as evidence of what
happened.  Not sure why he saved them, but I told him to keep it for a
memoir.  Heh.  The dvd won't read in my iMac or the factory drive in
the G3.  I had to put in an aftermarket dvd drive in the G3 to wipe
the drive and reinstall Tiger. The eMac read the disk with no problem.
I wanted to start it out fresh.  I think you can get another copy from
Apple but you have to have a receipt, or some proof that you owned it.
There wasn't enough left of the disk or the package to even tell what
it used to be.  I saw black paper and shiny bits of cd...that's it.  I
think somebody at Apple would get a good belly laugh if I sent them
the shredded bits cemented with dog drool and asked for a new one.
May I have another, sir?
I am the working poor.  I have to get by with what I have and save my
pennies to get up the next notch.   I shop at WalMart not by choice
but need.  If it wasn't for Wally World, I would starve and go without
clothes....lol    So, if the guy fed me a line and that was really his
AC/DC Back in Black cd that Muttley shredded, then I would have no way
of really knowing.  He said the copy was legal, and I saw evidence of
sorts to support that claim, so I am taking his word for it. :)

&gt;Well sounds like a -pretty fair deal to me.  I've just bought two
">

eMacs; a 700 and an 800 and paid �150 for each of them! which
transaltes to about 300 of your Yankee dollars. I bid on one that I
really wanted on eBay, didn't get it and bought the second one and
three days later was offered the first one as the buyer had reneged!  I
quickly talked myself into buying it on the principle that I could
always sell on the first one!! (Which probably ain't gonna happen LOL -
easier to keep it as a spare machine!)
I got hooked on iMacs when I played with a friend's, and so I went on
eBayand  bought a $100 400 DV grape.   I loved that machine from the
start: the look of it and the Apple design aesthetic, the whole OSX
experience that's just so much better than any Windoze machine I've
used, the ease of installing software, the fact that they use PC100
memory ....I went for an eMac for the  larger screen and faster
processor.  I don't like the fan noise from the eMac but it's still
quieter than my PC which is still in use for my collection of games.
It's also a little less luggable than the iMac and doesn't have the
carry handle. Is this your first Mac? Enjoy!
Autolycus Dan (so I don't get confused with the Dan who is already a
seasoned LEM poster!)
It's probably worth maxing your memory though, as you're
runningTtiger

That's what I needed to know.  I did get a good deal on it.  :)  200
isn't a lot for some people, but for me it is a month's worth of
groceries.  Or maybe a month and a half.  When you plunk down a
substantial wad of cash, you like to know what you are getting.  I
usually only pay 50 or 75 bucks for a working system.  I got a
Graphite DV  500 iMac with some sort of a printer tfor 40 or 50 bucks.
If I can get it up to 10.4, I'll take it down for my elderly parents
to use when I get ready to make the 15 hour trek this Christmas.  I
have a P3 1gig that I got with 17 inch monitor, keyboard and mouse for
75 a while back.  I need to find some homes for some older stuff I
either got for free or next to free.  I'm trying to track down through
the church the names of some folks even poorer than me that need some
kind of a computer for their kids in school.  Poor elderly folks that
want to get emails from the grandkids but can't afford to do so are on
my search path too.  :)  I guess for me the threshold is 100 dollars.
Anything over that is serious cash.  :P
