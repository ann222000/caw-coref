How many hundred tons of prep could NASA have saved if it had used such a
system on shuttle-station missions?

September 13, 2007 // Satellite to test special deliveries from space -
Student-led experiment would use tether system to drop 'Fotino' to Earth

http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/20759120/

By James Oberg, NBC News space analyst // Special to MSNBC

Russia's Foton science satellite will include an innovative space
transportation experiment that is testing a theoretically cheaper method of
returning small cargo from the international space station - and it's been
designed and developed by a team of students organized by the European Space
Agency.

The approach is to use a space tether as a transportation mechanism, a
concept so risky and revolutionary that existing space agencies have for
years been afraid of even trying it out for fear of an embarrassing failure.

The Young Engineers Satellite 2, or YES2 for short, is piggybacking into
orbit aboard a Russian science satellite named Foton-M3, due for launch at 7
a.m. ET Friday. The Foton satellite had two major advantages - some extra
space for a hitchhiker, and a low orbit around Earth (about 155 miles, or
250 kilometers). As a result, the ticket was pretty cheap.

The low orbit is critical because the YES2 objective is to demonstrate
the ability to fling a small landing capsule down into the atmosphere
without the use of rockets at all. Instead, the tiny 12-pound (5.5-kilogram)
heat-shielded sphere, nicknamed &quot;Fotino,&quot; will be lowered from the Foton-M3
to the end of a 19-mile-long (30-kilometer-long) fishline-thin tether (the
reel is called &quot;Floyd&quot;), and then released.

James Oberg, space analyst for NBC News, spent 22 years at NASA's Johnson
Space Center as a Mission Control operator and an orbital designer. His
tasks for NASA included the development of shuttle crew procedures for
tether deployment and retrieval.

In a universe where a proven tether system exists, that's a useful

As a first-order approximation, zero.

A tethered deorbit would require commit to deorbit before closing the
payload bay doors. There is no way in hell that will pass muster with
safety. At most you could use a tethered deboost as a perigee adjust to
reduce the size of the deorbit burn. Even then, it will not save you
prop because flight rules require redundant deorbit methods; therefore
prop must be held in reserve to protect against a premature tether break.

Flying long tethers in space at high velocities is pretty much the

But, a successful tether deboost as a perigee adjust does result in an

A steel cable on a crane is many times more massive per unit length than
a space tether.

The load on a steel cable on a crane is many orders of magnitude higher
than the load on a space tether.

You are extrapolating from everyday experience and your intuition has

is no way a space tether can cut ISS in half.

There is also a big difference in behaviour between something that has

Especially since the tethers are a lot more expensive to test than the
filaments on Edison's light bulb. haha..

Sir Humphrey Davy invented the electric arc in 1800 - which glowed
red,but when he tried to increase the current, and the heat, the
carbon filament oxidized and burned out.

In 1866 Sir Joseph Swan was determined to make a practical light bulb
that would compete with candles and gas lamps - he had the idea of
using an evacuated glass bulb to halt the oxidation of the carbon
paper filament.

In 1877 Charles Brush created the carbon arc lamp.  These were not
competitive with gas lamps or candles in terms of cost, they were a
premium item that required replacment and adjustment of the arcs, as
well as an electrical source.  But the quality of light was judged
superior to that of flame based lights.  (this prompted the
development of mantle based lights to improve their light quality)

It wasn't until 1879 that Thomas Edison experimented with thousands of
different filaments in a Swan evacuated bulb - to find just the right
material that was simultaneously inexpensive easy to make long-lasting
- and trouble free.  While much was made of the vast array of
materials tested by Edison (and there were those who thought him mad
to attempt to repeat the experiments of Swan which did not produce a
practical light bulb - no matter how many materials that were tested)
- unappreciated at the time, and kept under wraps as a 'trade secret'
- was the development of what Edison called ultra-high vacuum.  That
is, despite Swans attempts to evacuate his bulbs, they still had some
small measure of gas in them - enough to cause problems.  New vacuum
pumps that had just become available (and were reported in Scientific
journals of that era) were acquired to create a 'harder' vacuum than
was possible before - this more than the choice of filament material
we responsible for the commercial success of Edison.   Edison made a
bulb that would glow for 1,500 hours - which is 100x longer than the
best bulb prior to that time.

Lewis Latimer - a worker for Edison improved the carbon filament in
1881 and improved the ways of making it in 1882

Willis Whitney, working for Edison, invented a treatment for the
filament so that the bulb wouldn't darken as it aged.

William Coolidge invented the modern tunsten filament in 1910 - which
lasted many times longer than the old filaments.  Coolidge died in
1975 at the age of 102.

It takes courage, hard-work, talent, and opportunity to make anything
in this world.  Tethers are a demonstrably useful technology in space
faring. We should have spent less on ISS and more on things like these
experiments.

I have a wish for a TV show that gives $20 million to three teams of
graduate students from three of the top aerospace schools on the
planet that spend 10 weeks each summer over 3 summers - at White
Sands, building a spaceship of some sort.  Maybe a rocket to land a
rover one way at the site of the Apollo 11 landing (putting to rest
for the today's generation whether or not we landed there)

The first prize, is $100 million for the school, second prize, $50
million, third prize $20 million..

The three teams are filmed doing their work - and its edited into a 3
hour show every week (one for each team), with sideline commentary by
expert engineers and scientists - and of course, there are the various
school logos on a wide variety of promotional items..  coffee cups t-
shirts, sweatshirts, etc.

Each week the expert team awards 3 silver sliderules (why not?) to the
best whatever and soforth..

I think it would put shows like Monster Garage and Rides and American
Chopper to shame.

In 2004 there was talk of making a space reality TV show - but the
budget I'm imagining would be unprecedented - for reality shows.

But not for other shows..  Reality TV shows run around $800,000 per
episode.  The Apprentice tops the cost list for these kind of shows at
$2 million per episode.

But shows like Scrubs, the Closer and Desperate Houswives can cost
over $10 million per episode.

I always thought Teri Hatcher was super man!  lol.  Maybe she could
host the show.

I'm thinking 3 shows a week, one hour each.  10 weeks per season 3
season minimum.  Thats 90 shows - at $5 million per show, that's $450
million - of that, $60 million is paid up front to the schools (over 3
years), and $40 million is paid out (over 3 years) for filming - and
$170 million is held in escrow until the end.  That's a total of $270
million - paid out over 3 years - sign a deal with NBC for $450
million - they spend another $50 million hyping it - you're golden.

Get on the stick Oberg - and get Capus and Zucker in a head lock and
tell them to put Universal on to this.  Heck, they could build a theme
park in Vegas and break even just on that!  Think of it as cashing in
on America's return to patriotism!

People need to think about this a bit.  If the cable is not
deliberately elastic and is not loaded anywhere near its failure
point, there is actually very little energy.  Get on skates, pick up a
5 lb weight, hold it out at arm's length with one arm and start
spinning.  When you let go of the weight, do you think your fist flies
back uncontrollably, hits you in the mouth, and knocks you out?

Of course not.  And so it is with the cable...

I'll have the orbit at 300 km and the ball at the end of the cable at
290 km.

Acceleration from gravity =GM / r^2
Acceleration from centrifugal force = w^2 * r

r being 290 and w being the same angular velocity as the object in the
300 km orbit.

Centrifugal force acceleration = 8.92 meters/sec^2
Gravity acceleration = 8.96 meters/sec^2

Net acceleration = .04 meters/sec^2

A one ton object at the end of the string will give an eight pound pull
on the string.

Since you would presumably be going nowhere near the breaking strength

&gt; &gt; &gt; That was three years ago - prior to the current glut of reality shows.
&gt; &gt; &gt; I.E. putting Monster Garage or American Chopper in the shade is a
&gt; &gt; &gt; pretty low bar.

&gt; &gt; Yes, but it will be passed on the way to 20 million viewers a week..
&gt; &gt; haha..

&gt; &gt; &gt; On top of which, their cultural impact has been
&gt; &gt; &gt; essentially zero due to their (relatively speaking) low viewership.

&gt; &gt; I like them, but yes you are right.  You need to gain veiwers.  How
&gt; &gt; many people watched the moon landing?   Nearly a billion people.  How
&gt; &gt; many people were interested in the Mars rovers?  Over a billion and a
&gt; &gt; half.   How many people were interestedin spaceship one?  How many
&gt; &gt; watched the science channels 3 hour special on the making of spaceship
&gt; &gt; one?   Over 20 millions (including reruns)

&gt; &gt; There is some power here - if its done right - and like I said,
&gt; &gt; appeals to national pride.

&gt; &gt; &gt; And low impact from low viewers means low ad revenue...

&gt; &gt; True

&gt; &gt; &gt; Which means
&gt; &gt; &gt; that a high budget sci-tech show is not likely to be viable.

&gt; &gt; Depends on the numbers..  If you've ever built something complicated,
&gt; &gt; you know there's lots of drama.  There's also danger - and even
&gt; &gt; romance - with young team members of both sexes on the project.

&gt; &gt; &gt; To get the ad revenue you need, you are talking viewer numbers on the
&gt; &gt; &gt; order of American Idol.  Which an updated version of [Junkyard
&gt; &gt; &gt; Wars|Scrapheap Challenge] simply isn't going to get.

&gt; &gt; Why?   Give me the numbers.  I agree that Junkyard wars is an
&gt; &gt; interesting show,

&gt; &gt; It doesn't have the sex appeal of American Chopper and Monster
&gt; &gt; Garage.

&gt; &gt; If Ugly Betty got her show, to try to tap into what are they post-gen-
&gt; &gt; Xers?  its time that super nerds get their own show, and a shot.  Get
&gt; &gt; a makeover - do a deal with GQ - create an ad - smart is in ... Why
&gt; &gt; should muscle bound buys who raise pit bulls get all the sex appeal?
&gt; &gt; Brains are sexy - they just don't get multi-million dollar contracts
&gt; &gt; every year.  Well, this show changes that paradigm.

&gt; &gt; its what made America great!   People used to idolize Einstein and
&gt; &gt; Edison and Ford and Fireston..  haha..  Why not the next Einstein?

&gt; &gt; Besides, you can get key advertisers to plunk down major dollars to
&gt; &gt; anchor the show.  The US Army reaching out to young nerds will
&gt; &gt; advertise for sure...  Boeing and Lockheed who would be getting a lot
&gt; &gt; of the money spent by the show could provide expensive services to cut
&gt; &gt; your out of pocket expenses, but more importantly, probably be a big
&gt; &gt; advertiser too due to the demographics of the most avid viewers.
&gt; &gt; Others can be drawn in to interest the likes of Taco Bell or
&gt; &gt; Heineken..  -

&gt; &gt; I remember as a teen watching Walter Conkrite announce every Mercury,
&gt; &gt; Gemini flight and in College every Apollo flight.  I was an avid fan.
&gt; &gt; I sensed among younger engineers the Mars rovers were that for them.
&gt; &gt; THIS SHOW CAN BE THAT FOR THIS GENERATION - and older folks can be
&gt; &gt; drawn in too - by reflecting on past difficulties and issues...  it
&gt; &gt; would be great if done right - and you could easily get 20 million
&gt; &gt; viewers and sell boxed DVD sets the following season - and all sorts
&gt; &gt; of stuff.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;In 2004 there was talk of making a space reality TV show - but the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;budget I'm imagining would be unprecedented - for reality shows.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;But not for other shows..  Reality TV shows run around $800,000 per
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;episode.  The Apprentice tops the cost list for these kind of shows at
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;$2 million per episode.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;But shows like Scrubs, the Closer and Desperate Houswives can cost
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;over $10 million per episode.

&gt; &gt; &gt; They can get those budgets for two reasons, neither of which applies
&gt; &gt; &gt; to your proposed show.

&gt; &gt; Why not?

&gt; &gt; &gt; First, the time value of syndication and
&gt; &gt; &gt; secondly the high viewership.

&gt; &gt; These are at present gratuitous statements.  The history of space

&gt; &gt; that can be said less gratuitously.

&gt; &gt; haha..  That's always good.

&gt; Did I say Ugly Betty?   I was thinking Napoleon Dynamite.  Great
&gt; character.  Maybe Jon Heder could host it - but he'd have to stay in
&gt; character and be coached by the experts to stump the grad students in
&gt; set pieces that would become legend!  lol.

&gt; Instead of you're fired - you'd have Grandma called and said you had

&gt; Freakin calculus of variations - what do you think!

&gt; lol

&gt; DANG!  Ever take it off any sweet jumps?

&gt; Are you guys having a killer time?

&gt; and this could easily morph into talking about the social and romantic
&gt; potentialities of the squads as well as the highly technical stuff.

&gt; Then, you'd have the brainy-sexy grad students (male and female)
&gt; worked over before they got to the site and got to work.  That is,
&gt; you'd pick them for sex appeal and sociability as well as brains...
&gt; just like sponsers pick race car drivers...they'd be the new Mercury
&gt; Seven..  haha..  and be stage managed every bit as much for their
&gt; public image.

&gt; I could see the tabloids chasing them around and folks getting into
&gt; trouble and getting kicked off the squad and so forth..  It would be a
&gt; hoot and there would be every hook imaginable to bring in every type
&gt; of viewer.

I'm not sure exactly how you made your computations, I think
you made two errors that mostly cancel out.

The value of r up there should be about 6670 km, Earth's radius
plus orbital altitude. Here are my computations:

R1 = 6670 km
R2 = 6660 km

GM is about 4x10^14 m^3/s^2

Acceleration from gravity at R1 = GM/R1^2
Acceleration from gravity at R2 = GM/R2^2

The difference between the two is GM(1/R1^2 -1/R2^2) = 0,0027 m/s^2

Of course I could do it by computing the centrifugal force
but if the whole thing is in a circular orbit then, for some point
between on the cable the centrifugal force will be equal to the
gravitational force. The tension in the cable at that point can be
separated into the tension from above and the tension from below
=(Gravity above - centrifugal force) + (Gravity below - centrifugal force).
= Gravity above - gravity below.

Someone could read that statement and get the wrong idea. If you stretch a rubber band twice as much as you stretch a
steel cable you won't get twice as much recoil from the rubber band. For a given material, it is true that the more you
stretch it, within its elastic limit, the more it will snap back. But that does not apply for different materials.

The &quot;within its elastic limit&quot; part in the previous paragraph is important. Some materials will lose their elasticity
before snapping.

Another important point to consider is how the cable breaks. For example, a rope cable will break one fiber at a time so
the stress isn't necessarily all relieved at once. A steel cable will more likely break in one big snap.

Again, there is a big difference between a cable at its breaking point
and one that isn't close.  As for the Navy, look into knit lines. They
don't snap like that.

&gt; out of reach of my computer until thursday. I will check the
&gt; computations between now and then and repost my results. Anyway, the
&gt; acceleration is clearly much less than 1 m/s^2.
">

Hop's result looks right to me, though the derivation may not be quite
kosher. The rough rule-of-thumb for LEO is that the tether tension is
~3.6 newtons per km of tether per 1000 kg of tip mass (including, in
this case, the mass of the tether). For the 10 km tether in Hop's
example, that's around 36 newtons, which is close enough to 8 pounds.

(In the general case that rule-of-thumb is length of tether from the
c.g. of the system and includes the mass of the tether *on that side* of
the c.g.. But in this case, where the mass of ISS dominates the system,
the c.g. of the system is still very close to the ISS c.g. so the entire
length and mass of the tether can be used. In a system where the tip
masses were equal, you'd use half the tether length and mass to compute
the tension.)

There's not a lot of tension - about 3.6 N per km tether per ton mass.
And even after the tether snaps, there is still a gravity gradient force
trying to keep it taut.

Due to the low tension in the tether and the gravity gradient forces
trying to keep it taut, the tether will recoil very slowly. The proper
reaction to a tether cut at the ISS end is to do nothing - it will
recoil away from ISS. The proper reaction to a tether cut at the other
end is to cut the tether at the ISS end - gravity gradient will pull it
away before it can entangle ISS. In either case a small burn may be
necessary to prevent recontact.

&gt; &gt; &gt; haha..  That's always good.

&gt; &gt; Did I say Ugly Betty?   I was thinking Napoleon Dynamite.  Great
&gt; &gt; character.  Maybe Jon Heder could host it - but he'd have to stay in
&gt; &gt; character and be coached by the experts to stump the grad students in
&gt; &gt; set pieces that would become legend!  lol.

&gt; &gt; Instead of you're fired - you'd have Grandma called and said you had
&gt; &gt; to go home because you're ruining everyone's lives!  haha..

&gt; &gt; Freakin calculus of variations - what do you think!

&gt; &gt; lol

&gt; &gt; DANG!  Ever take it off any sweet jumps?

&gt; &gt; Are you guys having a killer time?

&gt; &gt; and this could easily morph into talking about the social and romantic
&gt; &gt; potentialities of the squads as well as the highly technical stuff.

&gt; &gt; Then, you'd have the brainy-sexy grad students (male and female)
&gt; &gt; worked over before they got to the site and got to work.  That is,
&gt; &gt; you'd pick them for sex appeal and sociability as well as brains...
&gt; &gt; just like sponsers pick race car drivers...they'd be the new Mercury
&gt; &gt; Seven..  haha..  and be stage managed every bit as much for their
&gt; &gt; public image.

&gt; &gt; I could see the tabloids chasing them around and folks getting into
&gt; &gt; trouble and getting kicked off the squad and so forth..  It would be a
&gt; &gt; hoot and there would be every hook imaginable to bring in every type
&gt; &gt; of viewer.

&gt; Okay, what did you imbibe between this post and the previous one? Fess

&gt; The rough rule-of-thumb for LEO is that the tether tension is ~3.6 newtons
&gt; per km of tether per 1000 kg of tip mass (including, in this case, the
&gt; mass of the tether). For the 10 km tether in Hop's example, that's around
&gt; 36 newtons, which is close enough to 8 pounds.

&gt; (In the general case that rule-of-thumb is length of tether from the c.g.
&gt; of the system and includes the mass of the tether *on that side* of the
&gt; c.g.. But in this case, where the mass of ISS dominates the system, the
&gt; c.g. of the system is still very close to the ISS c.g. so the entire
&gt; length and mass of the tether can be used. In a system where the tip
&gt; masses were equal, you'd use half the tether length and mass to compute
&gt; the tension.)

So, if you have a 9,000 kg Progress (I'm guessing at the mass when it
undocks from ISS) on a 20 km tether, you've got about 648 newtons of force
on the tether.  You seem to be the expert on this topic, so what kind
delta-V/altitude boost does that give ISS given its current mass?

&gt;&gt;&gt; Acceleration from centrifugal force = w^2 * r

&gt;&gt;&gt; r being 290 and w being the same angular velocity as the object in
&gt;&gt;&gt; the 300 km orbit.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Centrifugal force acceleration = 8.92 meters/sec^2
&gt;&gt;&gt; Gravity acceleration = 8.96 meters/sec^2

&gt;&gt;&gt; Net acceleration = .04 meters/sec^2

&gt;&gt;&gt; A one ton object at the end of the string will give an eight pound
&gt;&gt;&gt; pull on the string.

&gt;&gt; I'm not sure exactly how you made your computations, I think
&gt;&gt; you made two errors that mostly cancel out.

&gt;&gt; The value of r up there should be about 6670 km, Earth's radius
&gt;&gt; plus orbital altitude. Here are my computations:

&gt;&gt; R1 = 6670 km
&gt;&gt; R2 = 6660 km

&gt;&gt; GM is about 4x10^14 m^3/s^2

&gt;&gt; Acceleration from gravity at R1 = GM/R1^2
&gt;&gt; Acceleration from gravity at R2 = GM/R2^2

&gt;&gt; The difference between the two is GM(1/R1^2 -1/R2^2) = 0,0027 m/s^2

&gt;&gt; Of course I could do it by computing the centrifugal force
&gt;&gt; but if the whole thing is in a circular orbit then, for some point
&gt;&gt; between on the cable the centrifugal force will be equal to the
&gt;&gt; gravitational force. The tension in the cable at that point can be
&gt;&gt; separated into the tension from above and the tension from below
&gt;&gt; =(Gravity above - centrifugal force) + (Gravity below - centrifugal
&gt;&gt; force).
&gt;&gt; = Gravity above - gravity below.

&gt; Oups! Okay, I got that wrong, yes you have to compute the difference
&gt; between centrifugal force and gravity. But R must still be about 6670
&gt; km, not 300 km. So I'm not sure if Hop's .04 m/s^2 is good.

By a 300 km orbit I meant 300 km above earth's surface.

An earlier scenario described a tether descending from a space station.
So I assumed the massive space station at the top dominates the orbit. I
didn't bother to look up the altitude of the I.S.S. and lazily tossed
out a 300 km altitude.

For a 300 km altitude I got a period of 5432.2057 seconds or 90.5368
minutes.

2 pi radians / 5432.2057 seconds = 0.0011567 radians/second

(0.0011567 radians/second)^2 * (6378 + 300) kilmeters =
8.9344 meters/sec^2

The GM I used was 398451.84 km^3/s^2

(398451.84 km^3/s^2) / (6378 + 300 km)^2 = 0.008935 km/sec^2 which is
8.935 meters/sec^2.

Centrifugal force scales with radius. The centrifugal force at the top
and bottom don't cancel out but add to the tension. I believe this
accounts for the discrepancy between our answers.

&gt; out of reach of my computer until thursday. I will check the

This is the point Oberg was making when he urged Derek to do the math.
I'm puzzled Derek didn't take his advice.

Well, I'm no expert, but like JimO, I paid a little attention to what my
co-workers were doing during TSS-1 and TSS-1R...

Very approximately, assuming ISS is 210,000 kg without the Progress and
starts out in a 340 km orbit (before unspooling the tether), after the
tether is unspooled and released, the ISS orbit will be about 341x346 km
and the Progress orbit will be about 321x206 km. The parameter most
affected by the rules-of-thumb I used is the Progress perigee; it will
be a bit higher than what I came up with. If you were looking to deorbit
the Progress, I'm afraid you'll need a longer tether...

True, but ISS did get a bit of a boost from this little thought experiment.
The next question would be, how much fuel did you save and is it more or
less than the mass of the tether, which I'm going to assume would be
expendable, since it seems safer to get rid of the tether after the
maneuver.  If the tether weighs more than the equivalent amount of fuel,
it's obviously not worth the trouble.

This is starting to sound like it could be an AIAA paper.  ;-)

But considering how this sort of tether reboost of ISS would mess up the
microgravity environment, it may be more practical to develop an
electrodynamic tether reboost system, which could be used to offset the drag
on ISS and hopefully improve the microgravity environment.
