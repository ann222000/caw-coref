Greek neo-Nazis burn controversial history textbook

ATHENS -- Â About 30 Greek neo-Nazis burned copies of a new history
textbook criticized as biased towards Turks in a protest before the
parliament building Saturday.

Members of the Chryssi Avghi (Golden Dawn) group threw copies of the
burnt books onto the road at the end of a traditional parade in the
capital marking the country's independence day. The official
independence day is Sunday.

Militants yelled anti-Turk slogans and distributed pamphlets urging
resistance to closer ties between Greece and Turkey. Riot police
eventually dispersed them.

Critics of the textbook to be used in middle schools say it
embellishes the Ottoman Empire and underestimates the role of the
Orthodox Church in the Greek battle for independence.

One of the book's editors, Maria Repoussi, said that it avoids
labeling the 400 years of Ottoman domination of Greece as "slavery."
It also breaks with certain interpretations of the Orthodox Church's
role in Greek independence.

Education minister Marietta Yannakou has ruled out withdrawing the
book. She has asked for an evaluation from the national education
institute that could eventually lead to modifications.
