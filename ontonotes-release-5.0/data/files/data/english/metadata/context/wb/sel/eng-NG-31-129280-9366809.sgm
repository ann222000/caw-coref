The theme of  the third Academy of Global Song on October 25-27 will be
&quot;Birthed in Water, Shaped in Song.&quot;

Since the beginnings of the Christian church, music has been a powerful
instrument for expression, proclamation, and transformation of the faith.
Throughout the ages, the Church has been both shaped and characterized by
what it sings: from hymns and refrains found in the Bible, to plainchant,
the sacred polyphony of the Middle Ages and Renaissance, the Lutheran
Chorale, the Genevan Psalter, Victorian and gospel hymns, and contemporary
Christian music.

Global Song emerged in the last decades of the twentieth century.  A new
understanding of missiology and the reforms of the Second Vatican Council
nurtured the growth of inculturated Christian song in many regions of the
world. These songs brought together the prayers of the Church with the heart
and soul of indigenous cultures. In time, the ecumenical movement used and
published these songs, thus creating a rich cross-fertilization that found
concrete expression, among other places, in Protestant denominational
hymnals.

The Global Praise Program of the General Board of Global Ministries, The
United Methodist Church, in conjunction with Institute for Applied Theology
Center for Worship, Preaching, and the Arts at United Theological Seminary
in Dayton, Ohio are sponsoring the event. Two complementary tracks will
focus on the role of Global Song in shaping the Church's identity. The first
track, held at United Seminary in Dayton, Ohio, will elicit reflection and
dialogue on the topic through plenaries and panels. The second, held at
nearby Concord United Methodist Church, will consist of targeted workshops
that provide the necessary tools for a theologically grounded, responsible
engagement of global song in local congregations. The Academy will also
feature a Festival of Global Song, open to the public at Concord United
Methodist Church.

A distinguished faculty of Global Song leaders from around the world will be
in attendance to share their experience and reflection to the participants.
Among them are:

-

Michael Hawn, (USA) Perkins School of Theology
-

Per Harling, (Sweden) Swedish Lutheran Church
-

Swee Hong Lim, (Singapore), Trinity Theological College
-

Simei Monteiro, (Brazil) World Council of Churches
