The Celts

Common Ground of European Celts &amp; Indian Vedic Hindus

Hinduism Today
May 1994
http://www.hinduismtoday.com

Towering oak trees silohuetted a full moon scudding through
charcoal clouds over the midnight forests of northern
Europe. A broad lake rippled the moon's image. Two
crackling fires fed on sacred oakwood and offerings jetted
skyward from square and round pits set in a spacious
rectangle clearing-defined by a water-filled moat.
Surrounding the fires in a designated order were lean men
called druids, sitting erect, eyes closed or mystically
fixed, their long hair-white, blonde, auburn, brunette-
stirred by stiff breezes. They wore white and dark blue
cowled robes. A hundred yards away-mixed with owl hoots and
forest murmurs-their chanting could be heard, a flowing
acoustic river: sonorous, metered, slightly musical with
alliterated phrases. Out on the lake were boats stacked
with huge, gleaming heaps of cauldrons, swords, vases,
mirrors, trumpets, lyres, furniture, jewelry-all wrought of
gold, silver and copper. At the auspicious apogee
astronomically calculated by a druid, the treasure was
pushed overboard, sinking like metallic fish to the bottom.
It was a forever gift to Lugus, the Celt God of Light,
perhaps to use as a conduit of supernatural energy for
blessings.

This was a Celt high ceremony, and such treasure offerings-
sometimes representing 25% of a Celt tribe's economy-have
been found by archeologists in lakes, ravines and votive
wells all over Europe. It is one of dozens of mysteries of
a people that are now ghosts of European history, but who
were kindred spirits of the Vedic Hindus in India 3,000 to
1,500 years ago. Like giant mirrors set in the Alps and
Himalayas, the two societies reflected images ranging from
cosmology to civic law.

The Celts were a complex, spiritual, vivacious, artistic,
business-smart people speaking an Indo-European language
much like Sanskrit , German or Greek, grouped into socially
sophisticated tribes that fanned across Europe 3-4
millennia ago and leapt to Britain and Ireland-from eire, a
Celtic Goddess overlighting land. Eventually, they even
made Turkey their home, and came very close to turning Rome
into a Celtic eire. The Celts were a handsome people, tall
and muscular-no fat allowed by law. The men sported burly
mustaches and elaborate gold torcs banded their necks. The
women wore colorful chequered skirts, blouses and cloaks.
The druids were a mystical order, trained for 20 years in
memory, oration, law, metaphysics, ritual, magic,
meditation, science, medicine. They roamed like free
spiritual stallions among all the Celt tribes, and annually
a grand council of all the druids was held on a broad hill
or deep glen.

The Celts weren't the only Indo-Europeans settling the
European idyll. Balts, Slavs, Germans and Nordics nestled
in-all the way north to the frozen scrags of Iceland. They
each radiated a language, spiritual mindset and culture
that tracks that of the early Vedic. At dawn, Germans daily
slipped into cold, sacred rivers for ablution, chanting and
wearing loose-flowing robes and a topknot in their long
hair &quot;so emblematic of the brahmins.&quot; So recorded Tacitus,
the adventurer Greek historian. The Slavs took seven steps
around a holy fire in marriage. The Icelander saga-the
Edda-contains creation passages that are Upanishadic in
tone.

Imagine a wide swath from Iceland, Ireland, the European
west coast across southern Russia, the Caucus mountains,
through Afghanistan and into India; that is the common
ground for this unnamed mutual spiritual/cultural system.
But there is more. The early Persians, the Hittites in
ancient Turkey, and Greeks and Romans also spoke Indo-
European language branches, and practiced parallel
religions. The European, Asia Minor and Indian geography
was blanketed by peoples speaking shared languages and
following a single, multi-faceted mosaic of religions. Only
Hinduism survived in India, though it mutated, and was
nearly eclipsed by Buddhism. The Celtic religion survived
most apparently in the ancient Irish faith and culture.
Like the Vedas, the extant Old Irish literatures-memorized
and transmitted through a 12-year training by an Irish
bard/priest class who were the inheritors of the druids-are
a window into Celtic thought and lifestyle. Again, like the
early Vedas, the Old Irish sagas and hymns are at times
locked in metaphor that we don't hold the keys to. There
are also vast gulfs of knowledge missing from the Old Irish
literature, for the only existing material is that put into
writing-for the first time-by Irish Christian monks in the
7th century ce. By that time, 700 years of Roman warfare
and punitive politics (all the way to Britain) followed by
Holy Roman Church hegemony (including Ireland) virtually
extinguished the flames of the European pagan religions.
What remained was a Europe brightly misted in folk wisdom
and sagas and inlaid with thousands of temple sites, holy
groves and springs, stoneworks, fortresses, towns,
cremation and burial grounds, sacred rivers, mountain
eeries, seaside grottoes and treasure lakes all bearing
names, artifacts and wisdom of the Celtic Gods, druids and
culture, and other Indo-European pantheons. Most of what is
considered Christian Europe is actually pagan Europe.
Christmas day (December 25th) was usurped and inaccurately
fixed by Christians from the Roman festival of Mithra. It
came in turn from the Celt festival of the winter solstice,
an astronomical event the druids observed to set the exact
beginning of the new solar year-the same calculation
brahmins made in India.

The connections between Celtism and Vedism are dazzlingly
profuse, but they aren't entirely dead branchings. They
arch right into a hotel in County Kerry, Ireland, where
historian Bryan McMahon plays a telling game with every
Indian guest he meets. He hums some Irish folk music and
asks them to complete the tune however they like. He says
almost every time they will sing it like they already knew
the song. &quot;For me that is an indication that Indians and
Irishmen have a common past.&quot; A Celt/ druid renaissance is
brewing in Europe and the US.

Part II next month.

Parallels

Like two rivers cascading from the same mist-shrouded
mountain, Celtic and early Vedic culture share astonishing
similarities. Assembled here, for the first time, is a
side-by-side comparison between the two kindred societies
that were congruent in time and 3,000 miles apart in space.
Our knowledge of the Celt society is rather sparse, and
these listed parallels are probably a small percentage of
the full extent of common ground.

Celtic/Vedic

1) Celtic cosmology cognizes four interrelating worlds of
existence: netherworld, earth realm; heavenly realm of dead
and demi-gods; white realm of supreme Deities and energy
source of stars.

Vedic cosmology perceives three interrelating worlds-
physical; astral world of dead and demi-gods; causal
universe of Deities, Supreme Being and primal energy; plus
a fourth netherworld.

2) These worlds further divided into lands and cities
occupied by spirits and disincarnate people of similar
character. Time is slower in these realms.

The three worlds divide into loka habitats of existence,
occupied by spirits and like-minded disincarnate people.
Time is dilated in the lokas.

3) Celtic earth realm is called bitus. Celtic Gods are
called deuos, meaning &quot;shining one.&quot;

Vedic earth world is called bhu. Gods of Vedas are invoked
as deva, meaning &quot;shining one.&quot;

4) Departed souls dwelled in refined or hellish lands until
their next reincarnation as a human or animal.

At death, souls continue existence in subtle or hellish
realms until entry into the next human or animal body.

5) Celtic priests taught that human souls were
indestructible, but the universe ends and rebuilds through
fire and water in a repeating cycle.

The universe existence span-called kalpa-ends in a
repeating creation/destruction cycle through fire and
water, symbolic of primal light and sound.

6) Celtic deities included Gods who actualized nature
forces, promulgated ethics, justice, knowledge, speech,
arts, crafts, medicine, harvests, gave war courage and
battled forces of darkness, and Goddesses of land, rivers
and motherhood. Gods often did multiple functions.

The early Vedic pantheon included deities of fire, solar,
atmospheric and nature forces, ritual stimulants, speech,
crafts, arts, harvests, medicine, justice,
ethical/ecological order, war, battlers of malevolent
beings, river Goddesses. Gods often had overlapping
functions.

7) Celtic God of thunder was Taranus who carried
thunderbolts. God of fire is Aedh (pronounced uh-ee),
meaning fire. The sun Deity is Sulios. The Celtic word for
invocation is gutuater.

Vedic God of rain and thunder was Indra who carried
thunderbolts. Vedic God of fire is Agni, meaning fire. The
solar Being is Surya. The Sanskrit term for invocation is
hotar.

8) Celtic cosmology conceived of cosmic creation as a
primal Person sacrifice. The Celt term for breath is anal.
For soul, the Celt word is anam.

Vedic cosmology describes cosmic creation as the sacrifice
of Primal Being. The Vedic word for breath is prana. The
soul in the Vedas is atman.

9) The central Celtic ritual was the fire sacrifice,
conducted in geometric pits with offerings of herbs, mead
and flour cakes, conducted by chanting druids, the Celtic
priests.

The central Vedic ritual was the fire sacrifice, performed
in geometric pits with offerings of ghee, spices, rice-
conducted by hymn-and-mantra-chanting brahmins

10) Celtic priests were called druids, meaning &quot;knowers of
the tree, or truth.&quot; They memorized the entire knowledge of
the Celts and passed it on orally, forbidding written
transmission. They were divided into several classes:
seers, judges, royal advisors, hymn chanters, poet bards,
sacrificers. They were also astronomers, healers and
magicians.

The Vedic priesthood-the brahmins-memorized the

It was called &quot;Dies Natalis Solis Invicti&quot; but there were several gods
identified with Sol Invictus and Mithras was the 2nd most recent one
of those to ever have been worshipped by Romans, so Mithras
worshippers too were usurpers. (Deo Soli Elagabal was probably the
most recent Roman god to become Sol Invictus).

i am planning to show this scholarly article to all the santa clauses come
this xmas if it is ok with you, dr. jai maharaj ji. missionaries have been
stealing pagans' properties since day 1 a.d. including mithra. all modern
day xtians wouldn't be xtians if their forebears were not forcibly converted
in the service of a mideastern guy. modern day xtians owe it to the memory
of hteir unfortunate forebeears to return xtianity back to jerusalem. pagans
believe in honoring their forebears with a ceremony called &quot;shraadha&quot;. it is
time for modern floks mislead into xtianity by their unthinking parents to
do shraadha.

Sol Invictus is the late Roman sun god.  He is not the same as
Mithras.  The *title* Sol Invictus was used for several things in the
preceding period, including Mithras, Apollo, and El-Gabal.  Claiming
that these were 'associated' with Sol Invictus on the basis of using
the title is mistaken.

The dies natalis solis invicti does not refer to Mithras, but to the
state sun god, Sol Invictus.  It is documented only once, in 354 AD.

You may believe in forcible conversion.  Christians do not.  And for
those who have state power to accuse a peaceful minority of violence
is itself an act of oppression.

Aurelian, 80 years earlier, combined celebrations for various gods
into the festival on the day he called &quot;Dies Natalis Solis Invicti&quot;.
Sol Invictus was presumably intended to be viewed by his various
subjects as a proxy for their own gods.

&gt; You may believe in forcible conversion.  Christians do not.  And for

Yet, what does Roger call people (such as Marcionites, Gnostics,
Arians and Ebonites) who were forcibly converted? He calls them
heretics. And the religion of those who forcibly converted them using
state power? He calls that Christianity.

Sorry, my mistake; I don't usually look at the distribution list when
I reply to Pearse; I didn't realize sci.lang was on there.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Christmas day (December 25th) was usurped and inaccurately

&gt; &gt; &gt; Mithras.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There was no Roman festival of 'Mithra' (sic).

&gt; &gt; &gt; It was called &quot;Dies Natalis Solis Invicti&quot; but there were several gods
&gt; &gt; &gt; identified with Sol Invictus and Mithras was the 2nd most recent one
&gt; &gt; &gt; of those to ever have been worshipped by Romans, so Mithras
&gt; &gt; &gt; worshippers too were usurpers. (Deo Soli Elagabal was probably the
&gt; &gt; &gt; most recent Roman god to become Sol Invictus).

&gt; &gt; Sol Invictus is the late Roman sun god.  He is not the same as
&gt; &gt; Mithras.  The *title* Sol Invictus was used for several things in the
&gt; &gt; preceding period, including Mithras, Apollo, and El-Gabal.  Claiming
&gt; &gt; that these were 'associated' with Sol Invictus on the basis of using
&gt; &gt; the title is mistaken.

&gt; Where did the later Sol Invictus come from other than from the use of
&gt; the title in addressing earlier gods including Mithras?
">

By all means produce evidence for such a transfer.

It's just two words in Latin, you know!  Anyone can use them.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; The dies natalis solis invicti does not refer to Mithras, but to the
&gt; &gt; state sun god, Sol Invictus.  It is documented only once, in 354 AD.

&gt; Aurelian, 80 years earlier, combined celebrations for various gods
&gt; into the festival on the day he called &quot;Dies Natalis Solis Invicti&quot;.
">

Document any such connection from ancient sources.  There is none.
Document that the dies celebrated various gods.  There is no such
evidence.

Is there a reason why you keep making these assertions, when you
plainly don't know what you're talking about?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Sol Invictus was presumably intended to be viewed by his various
&gt; subjects as a proxy for their own gods.

In your opinion?
