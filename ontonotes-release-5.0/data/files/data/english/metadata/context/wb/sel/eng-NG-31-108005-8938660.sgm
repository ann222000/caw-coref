Last weekend we went on a little road trip to see 'The Airing of the Quilts'
in Northampton, about 500km north of Perth. The town decks out the main
street with quilts and people come from all over the place to see them and
join in the activities for the day. There were some nice quilts and it was a
fun day, even though it was over 30C out there. Also, they forgot to mention
in the brochures that flies are such fans of quilts - well, they must be
because they were there in their thousands!

It was a bit of a rushed trip. We left home at 5pm on the Friday after DH
had finished work, and got to Geraldton at 9.45. The next morning we did the
last 50kms to Northampton and spent a few hours checking out the show. That
was followed by a little sightseeing and dropping in to a winery before
going back to Geraldton. There DH bumped into an astronomy friend of his who
lives in Sweden! He was there for just three weeks on holiday. How's that
for freaky? Then we dropped in on some friends who'd moved up there, before
setting off home again at 5pm because DH had to be at work at 7am on Sunday.
We travelled over 1000km in 29 hours and packed a whole lot into that time,
but it was somehow actually quite leisurely and very relaxing. Yes, we
Aussies are strange creatures. :-)

I've set up a Webshots album with some pictures if you'd like to see this
quilt show with a difference. There are also some other albums showing my
rather small collection of quilting accomplishments over the last few years
for anyone who may be interested. I hope this link works!

Thankyou for posting the pictures!

That's such a fun way to display and enjoy quilts. Cute little town,
too. Do folks live there or is it one of those places that is mostly
open during the day for tourists?

I enjoyed looking at your work. I agree with keepign that first quilt
(I have one of those too). From time to time it's gratifying to pull
out the first attempt and then look at how  far you've come.

If you have Google Earth have a look there.

Thank you Leigh for the quilt tour. That is one way for
me to see a bit of Oz on the cheap! &lt;G&gt;

I especially liked a quilt displayed in the trees ...
the pink and green star that seemed to be a variation
of Lone Star or Bethlehem Star. The chicken quilt was
fun and cheerful. I also liked that red Chevy ... now
that's a car!

taken the day the desks were finished. It's sure looked a lot messier at
times since then. :-)

It's a real live town, Sunny. The vintage cars and other touristy things
were just part of the attractions on the day. There was stuff going on all
day to keep all sorts of people interested, but we didn't end up staying for
it all.

My first quilt is now proudly displayed on an old wooden chair with a
beautiful bear sitting on it. That way it's out for show, but also has those
non-matching points covered up. Perfect! :-)

The quilts in front of the butcher shop have legs.   Just legs.
Butcher shop... partial bodies...  .

Hey, Donna in Idaho, did you see the Frog Band quilt?

Bikers &amp; quilts--reminds me of that Yahoo ad w/ the guy in chains &amp; tats,
quilting on the porch w/ the southern belles.  ;-&gt;

Nice show, Leigh; thanks!

Thank you!
