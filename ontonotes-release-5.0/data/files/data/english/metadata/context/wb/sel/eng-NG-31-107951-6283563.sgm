Today in Ticino was another sensational win for Italian-Russian squad
Tinkoff Credit Systems; Pavel Brutt nabbed Davide Rebellin
(Gerolsteiner) and Luca Mazzanti (Ceramica Panaria-Navigare) on the
line in the downtown Chiasso town after 172.9 kilometres of racing. It
was a great confirmation for the 25 year-old Russian, ahead of a
top-flight Italian, Tin-Tin Rebellin, and to his team for having faith
in his abilities.

\"Yes, it was a beautiful victory and I have three good reasons to say
thanks,\" said Brutt to tuttobiciweb.com. \"The first is to the team,
to my teammates, who have really been great. The second is to Oleg
Tinkov, who has believed in me, who has given me space in this
important team. The last is thanks to Orlando Maini, Claudio Cozzi and
Dmitri Konyshev, the Director Sportifs of Tinkoff, who have given me
great guidance. Well, we are really a great team!\"

The win came out of an eight-man escape, which also included his
teammate Evgeni Petrov, finishing fifth. But the team did have a bit of
bad luck with Sergey Klimov. The 27 year-old was tangled up in a crash,
then taken to the hospital in Mendrisio where doctors determined that
he had a broken left collarbone. '
