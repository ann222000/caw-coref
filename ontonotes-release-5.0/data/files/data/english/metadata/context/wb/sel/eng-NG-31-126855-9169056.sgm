1)  Iraq: Civilian, US military deaths plunge
Los Angeles Times

&quot;Iraq's civilian body count in October was less than half that at its height
in January, [allegedly] reflecting both the tactical successes of this
year's U.S. troop buildup and the lasting impact of waves of sectarian death
squad killings, car bombings and neighborhood purges. October also marked
the lowest monthly death toll for American troops, 36 fatalities, since
March 2006, when 31 were killed, according to icasualties.org. American
commanders credit the buildup, which reached full strength in June, with
slowing sectarian bloodshed.&quot; (11/01/07)

2)  Afghanistan: Japan withdraws occupation support ships
Agence France-Press

&quot;Japan on Thursday ordered home ships engaged on a refuelling mission in the
Indian Ocean, halting the close US ally's main role in the 'war on terror'
due to domestic opposition. Japan, which has been officially pacifist since
the end of World War II, has supplied fuel to US and other forces operating
in Afghanistan under legislation first passed after the September 11, 2001
attacks on the United States. But the government failed to extend the
mission as the main opposition party, which controls one house of
parliament, has vowed that Japan should not take part in 'American wars.'&quot;

3)  &quot;Mastermind&quot; cleared, 21 convicted in Madrid blasts
Independent [UK]

&quot;A Spanish court found 21 men guilty yesterday of carrying out the worst
terror attack in Europe, the multiple train bombings in Madrid that killed
191 and injured more than 1,800 on 11 March, 2004. But judges acquitted the
man accused of being the organiser of the carnage. As emotional scenes
played out among the families of the victims, the court found three men
guilty of mass murder and attempted murder, and sentenced them to individual
jail terms of between 34,000 and 43,000 years. Four other prime suspects
received lesser sentences. But there were gasps of surprise when the man
accused of masterminding the attacks, Rabei Osman Sayed Ahmed, known as
'Mohamed the Egyptian,' was acquitted.&quot; (11/01/07)

4)  Court takes second look at &quot;enemy combatant&quot; case
New York Times

&quot;[Ali al-Marri] is the only person on the American mainland being held as an
enemy combatant, at the Navy brig in Charleston, S.C. A citizen of Qatar
legally in the United States, he was arrested in December 2001 in Peoria,
Ill., where he was living with his family and studying computer science at
Bradley University. The government contends that he is a sleeper agent for
Al Qaeda. The central question before the nine judges hearing the case on
Wednesday was whether the executive branch may capture people in the United
States and subject them to indefinite military detention without charges.&quot;

Paris prosecutor's office as Rumsfeld arrived in France for a visit,

Touches running the latest version of Apple's iPhone firmware to run

&quot;Eight people were killed and 56 injured in Russia yesterday when a bomb
exploded on a bus during rush hour. There were no immediate claims of
responsibility but prosecutors opened a terrorism investigation into the
blast, which took place shortly after 8am in the city of Tolyatti, 500 miles
east of Moscow in the Samara region. The victims were thought to be mostly
students. Three children were among the injured.&quot; (11/01/07)

8)  Spanish parliament condemns Franco
Associated Press

&quot;Parliament condemned Gen. Francisco Franco's nearly 40-year dictatorship
Wednesday in historic legislation addressing a dark chapter of Spanish
history that had been largely off-limits. The bill sponsored by the
Socialist government and passed by the lower house of parliament also makes
symbolic amends to victims of the 1936-1939 Spanish Civil War. It formally
denounces Franco's regime, mandates that local governments fund efforts to
unearth mass graves from the Civil War and declares as 'illegitimate' the
summary military trials that led to the execution or imprisonment of
thousands of the general's enemies. ... Conservative critics complained
angrily that the bill digs unnecessarily at old wounds and does away with a
spirit of reconciliation that accompanied the transition to democracy after
Franco died in 1975.&quot; (11/01/07)

9)  Fed trims US rates
Bangkok Post [Thailand]

&quot;The Federal Reserve cut the benchmark US interest rate Wednesday for the
second time in six weeks, seeking to keep a persistent housing slump from
further slowing the economy. But as Fed policymakers trimmed the federal
funds rate to 4.50 per cent from 4.75 per cent after a half-point cut in
September, they signalled that inflation risks made them cautious about
further cuts. Recent increases in oil and commodity prices 'may put renewed
upward pressure on inflation,' the US central bank warned after a meeting of
its policy-making Federal Open Market Committee.&quot; (11/01/07)

15) Billionaire Buffett: &quot;My taxes are too low&quot;

&quot;Multi-billionaire Warren Buffett has been complaining for years that his
taxes are too low. Last June, he said at a fundraiser for Hillary Clinton
that he was taxed at only 17.7% last year on his $46 million in income,
while his secretary paid 30% of her $60,000. NBC's Tom Brokaw recently
interviewed Buffett, 'whose approach doesn't make him very popular with his
fellow billionaires. ... 'The taxation system has tilted toward the rich and
away from the middle class in the last 10 years,' Buffett, the nation's
third richest man, told Brokaw. Buffett said he did an informal survey of
federal taxes paid by his own office staff, and the average was 32.9%,
compared to his 17.7%. 'There wasn't anybody in the office, from the
receptionists on, that paid as low a tax rate,' Buffett stated, noting that
'I have no tax planning, I don't have an accountant, I don't have tax
shelters.'&quot; (10/31/07)

unions and domestic partnerships, although he'd leave those issues up to
states to decide. Thompson, during his first public visit to the Bay Area,
also spoke on the volatile issue of whether the use of waterboarding to gain
information from terrorists amounted to torture. The former Tennessee
senator didn't support the practice outright, instead, he said he would 'do
what I think is in the best interest of my country' regarding approving
waterboarding as commander in chief. Thompson made the statements at a half
hour news conference sandwiched between three California fundraisers
Wednesday in Los Gatos, Carmichael and San Francisco.&quot; (10/31/07)

17) TN: DA defends &quot;sweet deal&quot; for former employee who embezzled
Tennessean

'&quot;Williamson County District Attorney General Ron Davis held a press
conference today to say he had nothing to do with what a judge called a
'sweet deal' for a former employee. Stuart B. Lowery, 26, worked for Davis
as an administrative assistant until an office manager discovered he'd been
forging travel claims to embezzle money from the county. Lowry stole more
than $3,600 between Feb. 15 and July 5, according to a warrant written by
TBI agent Wayne Wesson. Lowery was originally charged with two felonies --
tampering with or fabrication of evidence and theft over $1,000 -- and could
have served up to six years in prison if convicted. Because he worked for
the DA's office, a special prosecutor was called in to handle the case. That
prosecutor, Glen Funk, arranged a deal that allowed Lowery to enter a plea
of guilty to two misdemeanor charges and serve only a year of probation.
Lowery has paid the county back the full amount he stole.&quot; [editor's note:

Fox News

&quot;The father of a fallen Marine was awarded nearly $11 million Wednesday in
damages by a jury that found leaders of a fundamentalist church had invaded
the family's privacy and inflicted emotional distress when they picketed the
Marine's funeral. The jury first awarded $2.9 million in compensatory
damages. It returned later in the afternoon with its decision to award $6
million in punitive damages for invasion of privacy and $2 million for
causing emotional distress to the Marine's father, Albert Snyder of York,
Pa. Snyder sued the Kansas-based Westboro Baptist Church for unspecified
monetary damages after members staged a demonstration at the March 2006
funeral of his son, Lance Cpl. Matthew Snyder, who was killed in Iraq. ...
Church members believe that U.S. deaths in the war in Iraq are punishment
for the nation's tolerance of homosexuality.&quot; (10/31/07)

supervisors. And there probably will not be one any time soon, according to
the chief. The numbers are no better in Lynn and Quincy. In Worcester,
police have just three minority supervisors on a department with 462

supervisors are significantly underrepresented, according to a Globe

26) Pigs in blankets of red tape
Disloyal Opposition
by JD Tuccille

&quot;People have been raising livestock in my neck of the woods for as long as
there's been settlement here. This is the kind of place where you can drive
down the road and see goats munching on weeds in yards, cattle grazing in
fields, pigs wallowing in pens, chickens in coops ... You get the idea.
There's exotic stuff too. Some people around here raise such animals as
llamas. I'll be damned if I know what they're doing with llamas, but to each
his own. But we're getting an influx of new people, some of whom want the
rural way of life without, you know, those icky rural parts. They don't like
to see trucks parked in yards or to hear chainsaws tearing into firewood or
to see people loading up guns for hunting season. Basically, they just want
the view, and they want to move out the folks already here and share the
setting with people like themselves. And they really don't like to smell
animals.&quot; (10/30/07)

27) Justice not just miscarried but aborted
Jews for the Preservation of Firearms Ownership
by L. Neil Smith

&quot;The word 'infringe' also carries a connotation of sneaking up, of gradually
violating, or taking something away just a little bit at a time -- sort of
like what's happened to the right to keep and bear arms. I mention all of
this so that you will understand, right from the beginning of this essay,
why I insist that the entire structure of federal, state, and local weapons
law is itself illegal, making those who have passed it and those who enforce
it criminals. Never forget that. On second thought, don't worry -- I won't
let you. What we're actually here to consider is the case of a fellow named
David Bacon who, according to his attorney, James Leuenberger, was a law
abiding young man and an honorably discharged sailor who, like so many of us
reading this -- and writing it, too -- was interested in guns.&quot; (10/31/07)

29) GI Joe was just a toy, wasn't he?
Las Vegas Review-Journal
by Vin Suprynowicz

&quot;According to reports in Variety and the aforementioned IGN, the producers
explain international marketing would simply prove too difficult for a
summer, 2009 film about a heroic U.S. soldier. Thus the need to 'eliminate
Joe's connection to the U.S. military.' Well, who cares. G.I. Joe is just a
toy, right? He was never real. Right? On Nov. 15, 2003, an 85-year-old
retired Marine Corps colonel died of congestive heart failure at his home in
La Quinta, Calif., southeast of Palm Springs. He was a combat veteran of
World War II. His name was Mitchell Paige. ... When the Hasbro Toy Co.
called some years back, asking permission to put the retired colonel's face
on some kid's doll, Mitchell Paige thought they must be joking. But they
weren't. That's his mug, on the little Marine they call 'G.I. Joe.' At
least, it has been up till now. Mitchell Paige's only condition? That G.I.
Joe must always remain a United States Marine.&quot; (10/28/07)

30) Does this seem sleazy to you?
Classically Liberal
by CLS

&quot;Dwayne Dail was sent to prison 18 years ago, convicted of raping a
12-year-old girl he had never met. At the time he was in a relationship with
Lori Michaels, who would give birth to his son, Chris, shortly after he was
sent to prison. Recently DNA evidence exonerated Dail. He was innocent after
all. Having been cheated out of his son's childhood I suspect Mr. Dail was
quite happy when Chris, now 18, moved to Florida to be with his father.
Under state law he can receive compensation of $20,000 for each year he
spent in prison while innocent or around $360,000 in total. Now Lori
Michaels reenters the picture filing a law suit against Dail for back child

&quot;The victory of the liberal Civic Platform in Poland's early elections over

better policing and steeper sentences, the fight against corruption must
include the reduction of the size and scope of the state.&quot; (11/01/07)

32) Dealing with failure
LewRockwell.Com
by Jeffrey A. Tucker

&quot;Dealing with personal failure is one of the great struggles of growing up.
When we are young, the possibilities seem without limit, but as the years
pass, we face every manner of barrier that causes us to be all too aware
that we face a world with many constraints, many of them due to the limits
of the temporal world but also, we must admit, many of them due to our own
inadequacies. I'm thinking in particular of my great failure to become a
heavy drinker -- I mean a serious, quaff-it-down-every-night,
devil-may-care, kind of drinker. I think back to when I was a young man, and
how I split the world between two types of people: those who seriously
drink, managing their lives well and enjoying every minute; and the other
type who have a 'glass of wine at dinner' but nothing else. How I heaped
disdain on the latter type ...&quot; (11/01/07)

weapons systems. Lockheed Martin, the nation's top weapons manufacturer,

&quot;Last month, near the end of the Democratic presidential debate in New

interviewer' and perhaps the most influential journalist in America -- had
one last chance to pin the candidates down with his legendary common sense,
persistence, and no-bull style. This is what he asked, first to Barack
Obama: 'There's been a lot of discussion about the Democrats and the issue
of faith and values. I want to ask you a simple question. Senator Obama,
what is your favorite Bible verse?' When Obama finished his answer, Russert
said to the other candidates, 'I want to give everyone a chance in this. You
just take 10 seconds.' Predictable banality ensued.&quot; (10/31/07)

36) Democratic leaders are obstructing a compromise on SCHIP
Tennessean
by US Rep. Marsha Blackburn [R-TN]

&quot;One of the biggest issues before Congress this fall has been the debate
over the future of the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP).
Originally crafted by a Republican Congress in 1997 and signed into law,
SCHIP was designed to provide health insurance for children whose parents
made too much money to qualify for Medicaid but couldn't afford private
health insurance. The program was set to expire this year. The Democratic
leadership in the House put forward two bills that -- rather than simply
reauthorizing and modestly expanding a successful program -- change its
essential nature.&quot; [editor's note: At the risk of being labeled &quot;GOP
apologist&quot; we must agree with this analysis; the Dems have never been
willing to renew this program at present levels ... &quot;for the children&quot; -

37) Farmers deserve better
Christian Science Monitor

&quot;Every five years, Congress rethinks its role in farming. Next week, the
Senate debates a bill from its agriculture panel that perpetuates subsidies
for a few crops and many well-off farmers. This time, however, it has a
fresh choice. Farming in the US is no longer simply a declining industry
that needs a big federal prop-up in the name of 'the family farm.' Many
other worthwhile nonfarming interests have gained a stake over the years in
how government influences the use of millions of farm acres and billions of
taxpayer dollars. Even born-in-the-cornsilk legislators who favor the
current bill before the Senate (and a similar one passed by the House in
July) have openly questioned the wisdom of traditional subsidies -- $16
billion a year -- but then they've vote for them anyway under pressure from
well-funded farm lobbies.&quot; (11/01/07)

Rumsfeld was in France and French law requires that the accused be in the
country when charged. Hey, what's Rumsfeld doing in France? I thought he
didn't like 'Old Europe.' This isn't the first time either. He's also been
charged in five other countries including Germany. Since World War II,
Germany's had a zero tolerance policy on war crimes -- so they get a jump on
things, they don't require that the accused be present. But the French
charges could get real interesting. Some of the former prisoners of
Guantanamo and Abu Ghraib now live in France and they can testify.&quot;

&quot;Both Left and Right are critical of individualism. Both suspect it of

questions concerning which system best suits human community life, it is
vital to consider whether socialism should be replaced with its watered-down
version, the welfare state, or with an individual rights-based political
order. At this point the war of ideas is fought over which alternative to
collectivism is best, and individualism is under widespread attack.&quot;

That is what life in Cuba is like for most Cubans today. Sending a child

Rebirth of Reason

&quot;One of the oldest topics in human thought is whether emotions drive us or

only engage it, while David Hume, one of the most influential modern
philosophers, believed that reason is the slave of the passions. In today's
neuroscientific climate the Humean doctrine is more prominent, mainly
because the idea that emotions cause actions is easy to adjust to the notion
that everything must have a cause outside or within itself to behave as it
does. Emotions seem to fit the bill -- they are deemed to be such powerful
aspects of our psychological make-up.&quot; (10/31/07)

&quot;To Quickley and to millions of others, the new genre's appeal was visceral.
It was a true counterculture, skirting legality and authority with a smirk.
It broke down social barriers. DJs mixed Led Zeppelin and Aerosmith with
James Brown and the Meters. By the mid-'80s hip-hop looked like the most
significant youth movement since the '60s. It expanded beyond the original
'four elements' -- rap, DJing, graffiti writing, and b-boying (also known,
incorrectly, as break dancing) -- into virtually every art form and became
the lingua franca for an increasingly connected, polycultural world. Back
then, 'media assassin; and Public Enemy collaborator Harry Allen coined the
phrase 'hip-hop activism' to describe the movement's potential to spur
social change. But as industry execs began to capitalize on hip-hop's
popularity, its renegade spirit was largely suppressed by displays of
conspicuous consumption and gratuitous machismo. But now, with the industry
on the ropes and the political sphere energized, the transformative power of
hip-hop may finally be reemerging.&quot; (10/31/07)

Neurological Institute in Phoenix on his own two legs. ... [T]he
Massachusetts Department of Public Social Services, acting on doctors'
solemn assurances that [Haleigh Poutre] was 'virtually brain dead,'
requested permission to remove her respirator and feeding tube. This request
was approved by the Massachusetts Supreme Court. But the doctors, social
workers, and judges were wrong about Haleigh's prospects. Just before her
life support was withdrawn, she began to exhibit signs of awareness ....
Looming over all this good news like the proverbial elephant in the living
room is the Terri Schiavo debacle. Almost every story reporting these
hopeful events emphasizes that the Schiavo case was 'different.' Maybe the
writers are experiencing subliminal guilt over the part their biased and
misleading reporting played in the wrong that was done to Schiavo. Indeed,
in the wake of polls showing the public supported her 2005 dehydration, the
media have portrayed the effort by Republicans in Congress to pass a law to
save her life as an attempt to impose their religious views on a private

&quot;When does oil cost $13,000 a barrel? When you spill it in Prince William
Sound. That's how much Exxon paid after one of its tankers ran aground on
Bligh Reef near the southern coast of Alaska in 1989, spilling 258,000
barrels of oil. The company spent more than $3.4 billion on clean-up costs,
fines, and compensation payments. Yet in 1994 a federal jury in Anchorage
said Exxon should cough up another $5 billion in punitive damages, a number
that an appeals court eventually cut in half. Now the U.S. Supreme Court has
agreed to decide whether that punitive damage award, by far the largest ever
upheld by an appeals court, is consistent with maritime law. In addition to
raising that question, the gargantuan judgment casts doubt on the very

by a clean new Democratic broom, etc.?

Has anything changed? If so, what is it and has it been for better or worse?

72) 10/22/07 -- Liberalism: A title worth reclaiming?

Sheldon Richman has an interesting new piece up at the Foundation for
Economic Education on &quot;what nearly killed liberalism.&quot;

Over the years, &quot;liberalism&quot; and political libertarianism have been
similarly defined or used interchangeably in some places, and many
libertarians still style themselves &quot;classical liberals.&quot;

History and etymology aside, is the label &quot;liberal&quot; worth reclaiming from
the statist left, or does it make more sense for libertarians to cast that
label aside and forge ahead under the newer name (which seems to have been,
in turn, burgled from its previous users, communist anarchists, who took it
from religious non-predestinationists)?
