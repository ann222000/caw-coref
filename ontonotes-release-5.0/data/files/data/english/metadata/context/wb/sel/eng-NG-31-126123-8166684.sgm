Anyone know whether touch up paint for Fender Strat, specifically Oly White
or similar, is available ?

If not , maybe some model-car laquer will match up.

How big's the damage?   Don't forget the old touchup standby, which comes
with a vast array of shade, tone, colour, and metallic options - nail
polish.

Never know who you'll, ah,  meet when you're in need of a specific shade.

I dont think that you'll have too much trouble in finding a color that comes
close to the original. Where the wicket becomes sticky is that when a chip
of paint gets knocked off of a guitar it leaves a prominent square edge
around the area that it came out of. The thing to do would be to feather in
that edge with sanding but then you've got a much bigger area to repaint and
a much higher possibility of it sticking out like a sore thumb. From what
I've read on the subject it takes years of practice to do a good job and
even then you're still going to be able to see the repair. Laquer finishes
can be melted to get rid of the square edge I mentioned with a solvent
before applying the repair finish. Most paint chips especially if out of a
flat part of the body are better off being left alone. If you feel like
you've got to give it a try then the best method is to drop fill the chip.
It may take several drops with time for each previous drop to dry and harden
.  A dent that still has paint in it can be built up by drop filling with
super glue. Good luck with it

I'd leave it alone.  I'd rather have a couple of battle scars than a
noticeable touchup.

Some people will pay big bucks for guitars that have been chipped and
scratched by a professional. ;)

They go as far as to pay big bucks for limited edition copies of guitars
that were chipped and scratched by a professional!

DuPont Lucite 2818-L.  Started out life on the 1958 Cadillac.

Go to a paint store and see if they can mix it.  Most paint stores
should be able to.

FYI, all original Fender colors started out as automotive paint.

Heck, up until the 1980's, you probably could have gotten a tube of
&quot;touch-up paint&quot; in this color at a GM dealer.
