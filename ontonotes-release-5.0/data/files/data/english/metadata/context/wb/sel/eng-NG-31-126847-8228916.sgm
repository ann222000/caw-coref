....&quot;There are such things as facts. There is such a thing as reality.
And refusing to see those facts and report that reality -- undiluted
by an &quot;on the other hand&quot; mixer -- isn't a sign of objectivity, it's a
sign of intellectual laziness and journalistic muddled thinking.

The NIE report represents the consensus view of all 16 U.S.
intelligence agencies and is a stark and unambiguous repudiation of
the Bush administration's counterterrorism strategy and its contention
that the war in Iraq has made us safer.

Indeed, the report suggests that it's just the opposite -- that the
war in Iraq has fueled a growing hatred of America, spread Islamic
extremism, and spawned an expanding crop of newly inspired jihadists
around the globe. And it eviscerates the Bushies' bedrock notion that
we are fighting them over there so we don't have to fight them over
here. It turns out that the odds of us having to fight them over here
have greatly increased precisely because we are fighting them over
there.

The report also highlights the &quot;regenerated&quot; strength of al-Qaeda. So
not only have we failed to capture bin Laden and destroy those that
attacked us on 9/11 -- we have, thanks to Bush's tragic actions,
actually helped keep al-Qaeda strong and deadly.

If this NIE assessment was a Keeping Us Safe report card, Bush would
get an F.

There are times when there aren't two sides to an issue -- when there
is no &quot;other hand.&quot; This is one of those times.

The president vowed to keep us safer and, according to 16 intelligence
agencies, he has failed. Period. End of story.&quot;
