Frank, I couldn't resist responding to this. Are you saying that you
never designed anything outside of work? This makes no sense if you're
an engineer! Still waiting to see a design from you. Something tells me

Wrong again, Brian. Most of my work was done at work on the company
computers, so I don't have access to most of it even if I -could- post
it. But you're in luck; I was just doing my annual file-cabinet clean
out and ran across a schematic for part of a preliminary Class D audio
amp I designed about ten years ago. The technology was moving fast at
the time and the design was only used for a year or two, but I still
blurred out the name:

www.icehouse.net/wirenut/2934d3.jpg

Here's a couple scans of pcb art I found in a pile of other papers.
The first is an EM monitor I whipped up for a friend's project for her
Master's thesis relating to computer monitors (needed to eliminate a
suggested confound). The second is one of many variations of a 8255
I/O card; I don't remember what application this one was for:

www.icehouse.net/wirenut/elf-4.jpg
www.icehouse.net/wirenut/8255v8.jpg

As for my personal projects, there is gobs of stuff. Let's start with
something simple like a capacitance amplifier:

www.icehouse.net/wirenut/c-amp.gif

And don't forget the Twisty-Buster:

www.icehouse.net/wirenut/tb_rdf2.gif
www.icehouse.net/wirenut/tb_rdf_o.gif

Here's an audio compressor I started a few years ago and has been on
the shelf awaiting refinement:

www.icehouse.net/wirenut/tub_comp.gif

You know, I could post a shitload of stuff..... can you be more
specific about what you are looking for? Oh, and there is a price for
knowledge, Brian. If you want more you need to post the schematic for
your amp. It's only fair, don't ya think?

Frank, have you noticed that he's also very careful about the photos of his
amp? Only various photos of select parts, with none that can be
viewed/linked as a whole. I've never seen a real amplifier manufacturer do
such things. Have you?

Even better luck: I found the whole folder complete with my notes.
Here's the full schematic that was sent to prototype:

The other schematic was for a variation that didn't work very well;
there was a reactive loading problem with the IRF740LC.

Now..... any more stupid questions, Brian?

Most of that stuff is not RF related... and is older than dirt (tube

Most don't have any indication that you were the originator.
Yet you're so vociferous in your attack of my RF amplifier design.
Why is that Frank?... when you obviously have very little RF
experience.

No more than your "compressor". But then you didn't specify.

You are way out of touch with reality on this one, Brian. Tube audio,
ESPECIALLY the compressors, are some of the most desireable audiophile
circuits on the market. The reason is because the sound that can't be
duplicated by silicon. For at least ten years now many major audio
equipment manufacturers have included some sort of tube audio in the
line, and a few make tube preamps and processors almost exclusively.
"Older than dirt"? Right. Sure. And your fourth-generation hacks are
state-of-the-art.

Except that I posted them to my website, claiming them as my own, and
you can't find them anywhere else, not on the net nor in any book. In
fact, I posted much of the stuff previously on my website (back when I
maintained a website). I'm kind of suprised that you didn't recognize
it.

Anyway, you asked and I provided. Now where's the schematic for your
amp? Do you need more time to modify it so your "design" can't be
recognized as a hack?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

You know why, Brain. You're just trying to save face..... and making
yourself look like a moron in the process. Honestly, I don't think
you're a moron at all. Not everyone can grasp even the scant little
bit of electronics you have learned. But you are trying to take the
lazy man's path to engineering. It doesn't work that way, Brian.
That's why you don't see hacker companies last longer than a few
years, with most ending in bankruptcy (and sometimes in criminal
proceedings). If that's your goal then hey, by all means, go for it!

Just remember.... 34 watts of distortion from an unmodulated carrier.
You know what that means, Brian? It means that if, by some bizzare and
unnatural circumstance, the sales of your amps actually takes off, you
are going to have to deal with some mighty pissed-off customers. Can
you say, "Notice of Apparent Liability"?

***********

Outside my engineering job, designing circuits was as far as anything
that I wanted to do. When your hobby and work comingle, it makes for a
very dull life.

Also indefense of Frank, most major electronics firms make you sign a
non disclosure agreement(NDA). That means that you can not divulge
anything of your job, projects that you worked on or that the company
is doing or is in plan. Usually these last for at least one year after
employement ceases. Also any patents that you file outside work during
employment or within a one year period after employment ceases is
subject to challenge as it might contain intellectual property from
your former employer.

NDAs can be very restrictive. Also they are very binding legally.

I agree some of the best high end audio is still produced using tubes.
There are some distortion characteristics that bipolar silicon just
can't get away from. FETs are better than bipolar, but are still
lacking in some aspects.

Don't mess with clip-on mantles -- they're worthless. Use the tie-on
type. Use a double-overhand knot, tie it loose -before- you slip on
the mantle, then even out the wrinkles and pull it tight. That way you
won't have a loose mantle that will fall apart when you bump the
lantern. But even doing that I still get about 1 in 3 mantles that end
up with a hole after burn-in. The quality just isn't there anymore.

Yeah like you said tie the knot and don't trip over the lamp, especially
while it is lighted..like a moth to a flame that seems to be my weakness,
Frank.

Heh, now-days we are upgrading the generator instead of the mantle..arrrggh

I can still primitive camp a bit, butt toilet paper is high on the must
have list right next to extra mantles, fishing line, firewood, newspaper,
and such. No oak leaf wiping, please. My wife would freak.

Now we attempt to camp. :)

Easy enough. You can even rebuild the generator if you want. Use a
plastic scrub pad to clean the parts, but be careful because they bend
really easy. Then polish both the inside of the brass tube and the
outside of the cardboard tube with mega-fine sandpaper until the
cardboard tube slides freely inside the brass tube. Put it all back
together and fire it up. There will be a little muck left over so
you'll have to turn the cleaning handle a few times, but after that it
will work for almost as long as a brand new generator.

Oh yeah.... I hate to sound like a commercial, but don't use anything
but Coleman fuel. There are other brands of fuel available but they
are refined like pump gas; the shelf life is short, and if the fuel
has been sitting for a few months it will muck things up just like
pump gas does in your lawnmower over the winter. But I've never had a
bad can of Coleman fuel.

NO! Not unless it was made for alcohol. The main reason is that
alcohol (ethanol) will always have some water. It absorbs water right
from the air, whether in storage or from the air that you pump into
the fount. The ethanol/water solution is corrosive to the parts and
you get all kinds of nasty white/green deposits inside the fount. For
the same reason you should never use oxygenated gasoline in dual-fuel
lanterns and stoves. When they were designed it was never expected
that gasoline would ever contain ethanol. Coleman made a short run of
lanterns and stoves that could run on oxygenated gasoline but no
longer (and they are now prized collector items).

You -can-, however, run the lantern on kerosene! You have to pre-heat
the generator to get it started, and it will clog up more often, but
it will run just fine. I wouldn't use it indoors or in a tent because
kerosene will run rich in a gas lantern and you could die from carbon
monoxide poisoning. But outside it should be fine. You can even run a
gas/kerosene mix for easier starting. I haven't tried diesel or
heating oil yet but I suspect they would work like kerosene.

Speaking of kerosene I have a lantern you would love. It a railroad lantern
with mirror for signaling. It was my grandfathers when he used to work for
the RR. He ran a depot for the GA&amp;FL. or G&amp;F as it was called then.. ITs
brass with two big concave mirrors one red and the other not tinted..Only
used one mirror at a time, actually Im not sure if you were suppose to swap
the mirrors but grandpa did. When I was a teenager we actually used it for
camping. Soon it will be in a RR museum in South GA. The mirror is really
the interesting part to me as I have never seen one like it before. IT looks
like it was made by blowing a sphere then silvering the inside and
flattening it. Only half of the sphere was silvered, the part next to the
blowing stem the rest is clear and form the front of the mirror.When the
depot was shut down there were several old mirros around that the stem had
broken on, as you can imagine the silver probably didnt last long after
this. Are you familar with this type of lantern.

Hey, maybe you know how to fix this problem: The edge of my lawn that
hits the sidewalk always drys up about mid summer. I thought it was
getting burned by the heat from the concrete but it doesn't come back
no matter how much I water it, shade it, fertilize it, areate it....
and no, it's not from people walking their dogs. Is this some weird
type of grass that only grows next to concrete? Should I just reseed?

Is it mostly sunny in that spot? It may be a strain poa annua which is an
annual grass that dies every summer. I'd have to see it to know. Yeah if
it's sunny there you might consider sowing some turf type tall fescue or
some sort of a perennial blend rye/blue/fescue. If it's shade go more with
the fine fescue/rye blend.

Nice and sunny. It comes back every spring all nice and green, then
croaks. Pisses me off. But it doesn't get a chance to go to seed so it
has to be a perennial strain of something.

&gt; Nice and sunny. It comes back every spring all nice and green, then

&gt; has to be a perennial strain of something.

The shit grass is what goes to seed generally, the annuals. Most desirable
turfgrass is perennial and never goes to seed because you cut it every
week. It never gets tall enough to produce seed... like corn.

If you see grass that's only 2 or 3 inches tall going to seed it's more
than likely an annual grass. It's considered a weed in most parts and
people will pay to try and prevent it. Golf courses hate it.

I let my fescue get tall enough to go to seed a couple of times a year. I
have a neighbor who really hated this and she let me know in her catty way.
Funny thing the rest of my neighbors found out what I was doing now they are
too.

I told her it was a good thing we didnt live a little further south. Then
she would have to put up with me burning off my St Augustine every couple of
years.

Burn it off in the winter while it is dormant is the easiest way of getting
rid of the thatch. If you dont do it it will eventually choke itsself to
death. When this happens you get a big bald spot in your yard then the grass
fills in again. In other words if you dont dethatch it it will dethatch
itself in very ugly ways.

Not to uncommon for a design that WILL work of of line voltage to not show a
transformer even though it should have one. This may be in the verbal
description of the AMP. Also any High Power amp may have a couple of hundred
volts DC on the speaker terminals if there is componet failure. There should
be circuitry to prevent this.whether it is line isolated or not. Typically
the protection circuit CROWBARS the power supply blowing the fuse(s). Again
it is not uncommon for something like this to not be included in the draft

You're right, and I think I remember saying that it was a prototype.
The production version was a 2-channel unit that included a better
front-end with clipping indicator, a triac power switch (easier on the
power lines), a DC offset protection circuit (no crowbar), and thermal
breakers on the sinks. It was conservatively rated at 1000 watts RMS
continuous into 2 ohms in bridge mode. It could do 2000 watts but the
filters would get too hot because of the low carrier frequency, which
was the primary limitation of MOSFET technology at the time. Nowdays
they make MOSFETs with rise times in the sub nS range which made this
amp obsolete very quickly.

People expect that being in a particular line of work would mean that you
have the best kept equipment in town, but it is usually the opposite.
Even if you could find the time, once you get home, the last thing you want
to do is more of the same work.  Anyhow, nobody is paying you for the
work  :~)

Peter.

&gt; The employer owns the design. I have no right or control over any

&gt; because it was pointed out to me that a lot of people don't know this.

It is the same here in the UK.  Work done while in the employment or
under contract of another becomes their intellectual property - unless
it is agreed otherwise.  This can be true regardless or where or what
time of day or night you carried out the work.

If a company has you under contract to do a specific type of work for
them, all work you do of that type may be their property.  If when you
get home you do, by some chance, still feel like designing, you may find
that they own the rights to the work.

When you get around to it, huh?
Once you put something to one side, "awaiting refinement", it may be
simpler just to bin it.  You get too stuck into the next job to finish the
old ones which you have lost interest in.
