Hi,

Does anyone have a strategy for creating a piston effect (elevator in
shaft, or train in tunnel) that is more effective than creating and
deleting obstructions.

Thanks

Dave

Even that won't work, as the creation and removal of obstructions does
not involve air filling the void. There's no mechanism that I can
think of to do what you want. At best, we could concoct some way to
make a bunch of particles form a battering ram, but I'm not sure how
to make the drag coefficient just so to mimic a solid block moving
through a tunnel.

I think I have done something like the battering ram. I have a
blockage representing a train being repositioned through the tunnel at
10 m/s. I put a vent blowing air and particles at 15 m/s on the front
of the block. (This brings back fond memories of those special
relativity problems in first year physics.) The particles accumulate
and give the appearance of being subject to a piston effect.

See the file piston_effect2.data (please excuse the fds4 format, but I
couldn't find a fast way in fds5 to write the lines to create and
remove the blocks.)

Hi,

interesting approach! Actually there is no other way to do what you
want...

If you write this lines like in the file, you should use Excel or
OpenOffice Calc. There you can &quot;calculate&quot; coordinates and time. If
you have written the basic lines, it is just copy and paste... Then
paste the code to your fds-file, that's all... This is a very
effective way, I use Calc very often for &quot;complicated&quot; structures,
like wooden palettes... Very good and fast!

It should be noted that adding and removing blockages with a vent does
not give you a piston.  A piston raises pressure by compressing the
volume.  A vent is raising pressure by adding mass.  While both may
give you a net flow out of a shaft, they are not physically the same
thing.  If all you desire is to mimic the airflow from an opening
resulting from a movining elevator or train, why not put a vent on the
opening to give the desired flow?  Keep in mind that the use of CFD
for life safety work sees resistance by people who fear that the
animations and pretty pictures mask dishonest physics.

Jason F is right about adding mass. But suppose you push out the front
of your train, and suck the same volume into the back. Then you at
least conserve volume, and given that the air is at ambient temp (I
suppose) you conserve mass. Essentially, you now have a moving jet
fan, and its equivalence (or not) to a moving car is left to you to
ponder. Be sure to adjust the time step of your car movement to
account for relativistic effects ;)

should we use general or special relativity?

You might consider using a software package like Fluent if your piston
effect is very important.  While you'll have more trouble getting your
fire to work right, they have features (moveable meshes) specifically
designed to model things like trains in tunnels.  Of course...the
price tag is a little higher too!
