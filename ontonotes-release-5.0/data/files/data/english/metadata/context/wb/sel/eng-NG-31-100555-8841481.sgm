`02 Camry-4 auto 2002, 113,500 k

I took the car into a dealer for a code read to see whta the problem
was .

Appaently it is the vacuum switch which sits on top of the charcoal
canister.

The switch CANNOT be serviced and the unit must be purchased as a
whole (switch and canister ) for the princely sum of $624.00 Canadian.

Vacuum switch cannot be purchased seperately as Toyota says it may NOT
work ?
+ $121.00 labour + 15% tax.which comes to roughly $627+ for a charcoal
canister and vacuum switch.installed..

Since I have already committed over $850.00 this year to the air
conditioner this would take my maintenance allowance over the top to
close to $1500.00 when my allowance for maintenance is $1000.00 per
annum.

The shop said they pressurized the switch to see if it worked, and
they cleared the fault on the computer but said the check engine light
would come back on after a  while .

I`m hoping it was some bit of crud holding the vacuum switch from
working and the pressurization cleared the obstruction ?.

So far, so good ,no light.

I only need the canister -vacuum switch for emissions control anyway
and just having purchased my licence for the year ,I am going to wait
`till next year until getting the work done , just before I need to
get an emissions check again for my licence.

However if anything else of great expense goes wrong in that next year
I will dump this car for a Honda Accord or Hyundai. ,possibly.

Has anyone else got a more economical solution for this problem?

Incidentally , the car runs just like it did before the light came on/

If need be, BUY a code device and simply totally clear memory right before
the next emissions check.  When that amount of money is at stake, involving
a NON-essential item, it's we against them, as far as I am concerned.

The poster mentions perhaps dumping the Camry for a Honda or Hyundai.
Unless the cars mentioned are brand new, or very low mileage, I'm afraid he
runs a risk of trading a headache for an upset stomach.   I've been reading
the &quot;alt.autos.hyundai&quot; newsgroup from time to time, and there are horror
stories contained therein that would turn a Camry owner's hair white.    No
car is perfectly trouble free, unfortunately.

For once, I had to agree with you. Up here in Canada, most gang members
drive Hondas. Ricers.

I own a 2007 Toyota Camry and a 2006 Hyundai Elantra.  Frankly, I've
had more problems with the Camry, than I've had with the Elantra.  I
had a couple of benign problems with a Check Engine light with the
Elantra that was more of a problem with the dealer's Service
Department than the car.  The DTC (Diagnostic Trouble Code) issued by
the ECM specified exactly what the should be replaced, but in each
case the tech only cleaned the part instead of replacing it (a Purge
Control Solenoid Valve for the evaporative emission control system).
Since I'm an certified tech myself on another brand of car, I
specifically told them to replace the valve the second time the Check
Engine light came on - now, no problems.  The Elantra has been
absolutely trouble-free other than that glitch since purchase in
December 2005.  Unfortunately, our new Camry has not been as reliable,
nor (surprising to me) the build-quality and fit-and-finish appears to
be a notch below the Hyundai.  Our Camry was built in the Georgetown,
KY plant, and we're now on our 2nd automatic transmission in less than
5K of driving.  NOTE:  We achieved over 162K miles on a much maligned
Doge Grand Caravan 4-speed automatic transmission, so it's not our
driving style.

Horror stories can apply to any make or model of car.  Check-out the
forums on Edmunds.com - you'll read a fair share of 2007 Camry horror
stories as well.

How true.   And the make of car makes little if any difference.   Some time
ago I became slightly interested in the Cadillac Catera, which was made for
five years or so in the late 90s and early 00s.  Then I read some of the
comments on the net and found that it must have been a real can of
worms...things like replaced engines at 35,000 miles etc.  Whew!    And
evidently the new Camrys are not that red hot in the reliability department,
with bad transmissions, hesitant acceleration etc.
