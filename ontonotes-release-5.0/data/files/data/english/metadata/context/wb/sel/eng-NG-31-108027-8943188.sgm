Numbers League is a terrific game that combines math and superheroes
in a light fashion, and works well with kids and adults alike.  The
game has two levels of play, but even the higher level is still fairly
easy.  I don't mind the levels of the game, but I hungered for a bit
more math in the game, just to up the levels of strategy.

Numbers League Infinity Level Expansion (Bent Castle Workshops, 2007
- Ben Crenshaw) takes the game to the next level, adding both decimal
points and larger numbers.  Coming in a small box that is easily
discarded, since all the cards fit into the original box; this is a
small expansion that is not necessary for the basic game but allows
some more variety and math.

The biggest change is the addition of the decimal point.  Keeping it
simple, there are &quot;.5&quot; body parts and several new villains that need
&quot;7.5&quot; or a similar number to capture.  Younger children will likely
not be able to comprehend how to add the half numbers, although this
may be a great way to teach them the concept.

There are also quite a few new villains who have higher numbers, all
the way up to 56.5!  This is countered by several new high-powered
weapons that add up to &quot;25&quot;, and some high multiplier items also.
Even so, mixed into the deck, these cards allow greater options, and
it's a cool thing to take down a &quot;big boss&quot; monster.

The new heroes are more cartoonist stereotypes from the different
comic book worlds, from a feline hero to an ice hero to a samurai
warrior.  Everything fits flawlessly into the basic game, although it
does add to the time a game takes - maybe ten more minutes.  The new
cards are marked with a gray circle, so that they can be removed if
necessary.

If you like Numbers League and want more variety and/or a bit more
math in the game, this is a small, inexpensive expansion to throw in
with the basic game.  I'll always use it except in the case of younger
elementary; but for those who are older, this simply increases the
strategy and options.
