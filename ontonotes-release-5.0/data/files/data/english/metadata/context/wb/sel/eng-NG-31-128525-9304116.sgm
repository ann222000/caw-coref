&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; So...is it not a compliment for God to say through
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Amos, &quot;You only have I
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; known of all the families of the earth...&quot; Well, it is.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; And yet God goes
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; on to say, &quot;therefore I will punish you for all your
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; iniquities. (Amos 3)
&gt;&gt;&gt; [Shmuel]  Do you consider this &quot;compliment&quot; in Amos to
&gt;&gt;&gt; be crass sarcasm?
&gt; [randy]
&gt;&gt; No, but the same thought comes across, that the Jewish
&gt;&gt; leadership was elevated, only to be taken down a &quot;few
&gt;&gt; pegs.&quot;
&gt; [Shmuel]  If it is &quot;the same thought&quot;, why is one
&gt; considered
&gt; to be &quot;crass sarcasm&quot; and the other is not?
">

Because one statement is a statement of fact, whereas the
other has a note of sarcasm. Israel *was* God's only family
on the earth, and that is a statement of fact. But to say
that the judges of Israel were &quot;gods,&quot; that sounds like the
prophet is deliberately stretching things a bit.

Just my opinion--I could be wrong. Trying to read into a
statement the sentiment of the writer is sometimes a matter
of judgment. It requires informed judgment, but I could
certainly lack the proper information. Until I know better I
can only tell you what it sounds like to me. If someone
called me a &quot;god&quot; and then said I was unable to judge
properly, I would take it as sarcasm. When Jesus' critics
called him a &quot;physician&quot; and then claimed he couldn't &quot;heal
himself,&quot; they were being sarcastic. This sounds like the
same thing.

I'm not sure of how you get the connection to Zeus.  Zeus was called Theos /

I have read both Jung and Freud, but neither are contemporary, and
neither are mainstream.  Even modern Jungians do not preach the

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Ike

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Ah - what an interesting discussion about the idea of a virgin
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; birth.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; A christian discussing how he is condemning another - and thus
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; topic
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; is
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; changed.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Typical.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Moron: Before one can get to the problem with the details, one has
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; to
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; get
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; to
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the problem with the speaker, and the problem with the speaker is
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; that
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; he
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; is
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; a Laodicean who must, of necessity, reduce Jesus' stature, and take
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Jesus
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; down off the Throne of His Godly Kingdom, so that the beast can
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; advance
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; his
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; private agenda at the expense of Christ's divinity.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; So you can't even have a discussion of the transitional meaning of
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; word
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; for &quot;virgin&quot; until you get past Mark's bullshit agenda.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Oh, and the term 'almah means &quot;virgin,&quot; whoever, the prophecy
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; didn't
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; say
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; that the &quot;virgin&quot; had to conceive miraculously.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; This is the difference between the defective iteration in Isaiah's
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; day,
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; and
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the perfect iteration in Jesus' day.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; In Isaiah's day, two children where born whose days marked the time
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; until
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;Israel was forsaken of both her kings,&quot; Emmanuel (to represent
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Judah)
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; and
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Maher-Shalal-Heshbaz (to represent Israel).

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; That the &quot;virgin&quot; had to these two children by normal sex in the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; first
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; iteration (which was necessarily defective, as it was temporal) has
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; nothing
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; to do with the fact that, in the second iteration, the perfect
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; virgin,
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Mary,
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; was a virgin until AFTER Jesus was born, when Joseph &quot;knew&quot; her.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Ike

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Now the question I asked - is this a sign?

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; It is when there is no man involved, moron.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Ike

&gt;&gt; &gt; Good - it is a sign.
&gt;&gt; &gt; To whom is it a sign?

&gt;&gt; To those who &quot;see,&quot; and &quot;hear,&quot; and &quot;keep&quot; the Word, oh clueless one.

&gt;&gt; Ike

&gt; And what is the outcome of this sign?

Salvation.

Nope.

1. Body, i.e. the physical existence.
2. Soul, i.e. intellectual consciousness.
3. Spirit, i.e. one's interactive nature with the universe.

The body and soul leave an indelible trace in the universe as one pursues
one's desires, creating an eternal witness to the Spirit of any given
person, written into the fabric of time.

THIS is the definition of whole person.

But of course, the fools can't &quot;see&quot; Spirit, so they discount it, or confuse
it with consciousness (as you just did above).

Oddly, they WOULD &quot;see&quot; Spirit if they counted man's effect on the world,
and God's effect on man, in their calculations, and perceived what occurs in
collectives, both for and against God.

But that would require they acknowledge the One True God and Way of the
Universe, Jesus Christ, now, wouldn't it?

God forbid.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Ah - what an interesting discussion about the idea of a virgin
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; birth.
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; A christian discussing how he is condemning another - and thus
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; the
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; topic
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; is
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; changed.
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Typical.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Moron: Before one can get to the problem with the details, one has
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; to
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; get
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; to
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the problem with the speaker, and the problem with the speaker is
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; that
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; he
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; is
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; a Laodicean who must, of necessity, reduce Jesus' stature, and take
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Jesus
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; down off the Throne of His Godly Kingdom, so that the beast can
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; advance
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; his
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; private agenda at the expense of Christ's divinity.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; So you can't even have a discussion of the transitional meaning of
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; word
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; for &quot;virgin&quot; until you get past Mark's bullshit agenda.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Oh, and the term 'almah means &quot;virgin,&quot; whoever, the prophecy
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; didn't
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; say
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; that the &quot;virgin&quot; had to conceive miraculously.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; This is the difference between the defective iteration in Isaiah's
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; day,
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; and
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the perfect iteration in Jesus' day.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; In Isaiah's day, two children where born whose days marked the time
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; until
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;Israel was forsaken of both her kings,&quot; Emmanuel (to represent
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Judah)
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; and
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Maher-Shalal-Heshbaz (to represent Israel).

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; That the &quot;virgin&quot; had to these two children by normal sex in the
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; first
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; iteration (which was necessarily defective, as it was temporal) has
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; nothing
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; to do with the fact that, in the second iteration, the perfect
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; virgin,
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Mary,
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; was a virgin until AFTER Jesus was born, when Joseph &quot;knew&quot; her.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Ike

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Now the question I asked - is this a sign?

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; It is when there is no man involved, moron.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Ike

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Good - it is a sign.
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; To whom is it a sign?

&gt; &gt;&gt; To those who &quot;see,&quot; and &quot;hear,&quot; and &quot;keep&quot; the Word, oh clueless one.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Ike

&gt; &gt; And what is the outcome of this sign?

&gt; Salvation.

&gt; Ike
">

Oh good ... let me help you.

Good people of israel, I want to bring you salvation. A sign was given to you -
trust in this sign and you have salvation.
about 2000 years ago, a virgin conceived and brought forth a son. Isn't this
great?
And for forty years - this was kept secret ... and only then it was revealed ...
that this man was born of a virgin.

Here is your sign that this occurred - a verse saying that a sign was given in
Isiah.
Thus we have proved this sign - it occurred in your sight.

As this sign was given to you by the most high - it will succeed in what it was
sent to do and convince you that JC was born of a virgin and thus you have
salvation - provided you see and hear and keep the word.

If you do not listen to this sign spoken of well after the event with no
witnesses at all,  then you obviously do not see or hear or keep the word.

witness, the beginning of God's creation....
21  He who conquers, I will grant him to sit with me on my
throne, as I myself conquered and sat down with my Father on
his throne.

That would be Jesus, the &quot;begining of God's creation.&quot; In
John 1 Jesus is identified as the Word of God made flesh.
That would also make him the &quot;Alpha and the Omega,&quot; the
beginning of God's word and the end of God's word, the

&gt; not G-d hears
">

Do you remember the story of Samuel when he was little?
He heard God. I am sure that his name has to do with what
the little Samuel did when he was young. You know, that
God had named him that because he knew ahead of time
that Samuel would hear him speaking to him in the night.
Little Samuel heard a voice saying &quot;Samuel.&quot; And he went
to Eli, the priest, thinking that he had called him But the
man told the little boy that he had not called him and to
go back to bed. This continued, and finally the priest
realized that it must have been God that little Samuel heard,
so he told this to Samuel, and he said for him to tell the
Lord, &quot;Speak, Lord, for thy servant listeneth.&quot; Thus, I think
this must be the meaning of &quot;Samuel,&quot; &quot;One who listens to
God,&quot; or &quot;One who hears God.&quot; And God comes at the end
of that phrase. Does this sound right, Samuel?

Samuel, the thing is, that the meaning of the name Emmanuel
was contributed not by people that translated the Bible into
English, but by Matthew, the writer of the first gospel that
bears his name.
Matthew 1:23:
&quot;Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son,
and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted
is God with us.&quot;
This is the correct English for what Matthew said in Greek. It
is awkward in the word for word translation, but what he said
is
&quot;Lo, the virgin shall conceive, and she shall bring forth a son,
and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which is, being interpreted
'With us (he is) God.' &quot; In the English word order, that would be
written &quot;(he is) God with us.&quot; The word &quot;virgin,&quot; comes by way
of the Jews translation of Isaiah 7:14 when they translated it
into Greek when they formed the Greek Septuagint. They used a
word that means &quot;virgin.&quot; The prophecy that was quoted in
Matthew refers to Isaiah 7:14, you probably know, of course.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Samuel, when the children of Israel were in the wilderness
during the Exodus, the Lord planned intricately to show them
&quot;God with us,&quot; in the plan he had for the camps surrounding
the tabernacle at night. All the people were divided and
combined into 4 camps. Each camp had a banner, also known
as standard. On each one was a symbol. Each of the symbols
represented a lion, an eagle, a man, and an ox/calf. In the
Revelation and in Ezekiel, the cherubim that surround the
throne of the Almighty, have four faces, and each of the faces
are as the symbols on the standards. The tabernacle was set
up in the middle of the 4 camps, and in it was the ark of
the covenant, upon which is the mercy seat. At night, the
shekinah glory of God was present in a column of fire
which was above the tabernacle all night. They would
not have been afraid in the night with such a sight as
this. This produced in them the feeling of &quot;God with us,&quot;
because truly God was with them.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

">

The four gospels referring to Jesus Christ are of course,
Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, and each shows a certain
aspect of who Jesus is.
Matthew shows him as a king, King of kings, and a lion
is a symbol for a king.
Mark shows him as being a servant, and an Ox/Calf
is a beast of burden, a servant.
Luke shows Jesus as being a man, and he is Son of
Man;
John shows Jesus as being God, and he is the Son of
God and also the preexisting Word of God, and the
Eagle (Scorpio) is representative of our eagle, which
is the Almighty.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Luke shows Jesus
as being a man, and John shows Jesus as being God.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

This is just as  the standards of each of the tribes
of the children of Israel when they were in the wilderness,
except no one tried to copy that, it just happened that
way. The four aspects of who Jesus is, reflected in the
four gospels, are
1. The Lion of Judah
2.  The King of kings
3.  A Servant
4.  The Word of God, the Son of God, and
God in the flesh, Emmanuel

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

">

So this shows again this pattern of &quot;God with us.&quot;
Matthew shows Jesus as being a king, and a lion is
the king among the animals.
Mark shows Jesus as being a Servant, and the Ox
or Calf are beasts of burden that serve mankind
Luke shows Jesus in his humanity, and focuses on
his being the Son of Man.
John shows Jesus in his diety, showing him as being
the Son of God, the Word of God, and as God in the
flesh, Emmanuel. Here again is this presentation of
&quot;God with us.&quot;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

">

Besides the standards, the faces of the cherubim, each
having 4 faces, the four gospels, and there is one  more,
the Mazzaroth, the Lord's name for the Zodiac (Job 38:32),
has four points on this ring of constellations that have
been prominent in the ancient wisdom imparted to the
Lord's people that helped the wise men to find the Christ
Child are the constellations of Leo, Taurus, Aquarius,
and the Eagle, which is the ancient name for Scorpio.
This ancient wisdom is by no means the astrology of
today, it is not of the occult, it is of the Lord, and more
properly would be such as astronomy, rather than
astrology. But in them here again are these same four
faces that the cherubim each have, the lion, the ox/calf,
the man, and the eagle. So it's for sure that Jesus
represents God with us, and this is the testimony of the
New Testament that Jesus/Yeshua is God in the flesh,
God with us, which is Emmanuel.

In the contexty of what you are speaking it is MIND ..........

7.. (n.) The intelligent, immaterial and immortal part of man; the soul,
in distinction from the body in which it resides; the agent or subject of
vital and spiritual functions, whether spiritual or material.

Spirit has more to do with thought than emotion.

There are not THREE poarts to a person (spirit / soul / body) but rather
TWO - the seen (body) the unseen (mind / spirit).  (Sometimes in the bible
soul is used interchangeably with spirit / mind or as the conjunction of
body with spirit / mind)

Philosophers throughout the ages (both Christian and nonChristian) have
equated spirit and soul to equal mind. This is extremely evident in the work
of Descartes who began Western philosophy.

Nope!

Mathew and Luke are dependent upon Mark's gospel from which they pinch most
of their material.  John also depends largely upon Mark's gospel along wioth
his own ideas.

These are NOT four independent historical accounts but ONE GOSPEL (i.e.
PROPAGANDA written to demonstrate Jesus as the messiah) added to by each
successive gospel writer.

Balham Hill Post Office (14/Nov/2002)

Certainty level: 80%

By mid-November 2002 the persecution had again dwindled, as happens sometimes, when along came this item.
I spent most of my time at home, going occasionally to the shops in Clapham South, or into town to meet people. On this particular
Thursday I only left the house once, for less than fifteen minutes to post a letter (special delivery, because my ordinary and
recorded delivery letters had been disappearing en route for some time - not that anyone would accuse MI5 of such petty harassment).
At the post office counter there was an Asian guy talking into his mobile phone and grinning away. There is a probability that
his comments were directed at me, as I will explain further. The second segment of audio closely follows the first segment.

&quot;you'll do it today? let's meet about 3 o'clock and have some lunch. I got stuff to do and I'll go to the bank,
get this sh.. fucking moving yeah. Even just a little bit do something. He doesn't understand, you know what it is,
I don't want to tell him again cause then he might, he thinks we're having a go at him, I'm not having a go at him,
I'm explain to him&quot;

Explanation: The guy is talking about some bloke who is unnamed, however it might be interpreted as being in code about me.
&quot;I'll go to the bank&quot;... variously interpretable, either literally, or as sounds-like &quot;wank&quot; which has been a consistent
theme in MI5's abuse. &quot;get this shit fucking moving&quot;... abuse... could be interpreted as MI5's criticism of my inertness.
The state spends hundreds of thousands of pounds a year - they want to see some result, not just neutrality and ordinariness.
&quot;he doesn't understand&quot;... MI5 claim I'm stupid... but the numbers and bits of paper prove otherwise, so perhaps what that
is really about is their agents' subconscious perception of themselves.

&quot;having a go at him&quot;... sounds like they're having a go at me, doesn't it? You might take the audio at face value and assume
it's about some other guy, but it's normal MI5 procedure to pretend to be talking about someone else, and make the content of
the message very relevant to me, or their perception of me.

&quot;for some reason it doesn't get into his head, I don't know why... he's lost it completely, hasn't he&quot;

What reason is there for it not getting into his (my) head? Stupidity is implied. Also implied is that it does get into his head;
we're intentionally causing him damage. He's lost it completely... for some time I have suffered from OCD... lost it completely
is the persecutors' observation of my illness, which they see through the surveillance on my home, which they caused.

Eclipse pub in Balham (20/Dec/2002)

Certainty level: 70%

On Friday 20/December/2002 I went to Balham to do some shopping and eating. When I went into the Eclipse pub for a meal
there were two girls already at the bar being server, I ordered and sat down near the window. They sat down at the opposite
window seat, out of sight. After a few minutes they started screaming repetitively &quot;section, section&quot;. They were reading
something and were trying to pretend that they were just repeating from what they were reading, but in reality it was quite
obvious they were talking about me, specifically to confinement under mental health.

As you can guess the behaviour of these unwise young things shows them to be from the underprivileged category which due to
the natural laws of society is seldom seen in the better classes of restaurant - the McDonald's next door is their more
usual habitat. My guess is that these two females were deliberately placed in the Eclipse with orders to be offensive to
me personally. The alternative would be that no-one had ordered them and they were just being rude on their own account,
but that is improbable, for two reasons; first, I was out of sight of them and one does not usually &quot;pick on&quot; a person
one cannot see; secondly, there had that afternoon in Balham been other, less distinct incidents immediately preceding this,
and it is inferable that MI5 were making quite a serious effort to create a physical incident, as they have done on
numerous occasions previously. I give my interpretation a two in three chance of validity.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; When Paul (and Jesus, and John) said they are not all Israel that are

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Yes, that the people whom Jesus, Paul, and John said were not Jews were

&gt;&gt;&gt; Satan, you're a liar. It tells us the ones who are not of the promise
&gt;&gt;&gt; are
&gt;&gt;&gt; not Jews. Ishmael was not of the promise and the Ishmaelites are not

&gt;&gt; And yet they were calling themselves &quot;Israel,&quot; which is what Paul was
&gt;&gt; discussing in the first place: &quot;They are not all Israel that are of
&gt;&gt; Israel.&quot; Then he specifically defined who he was talking about, as did

&gt;&gt;&gt; were carried off.

&gt;&gt; Bullshit.

&gt; Matthew 10:5-6
&gt;    These twelve Jesus sent forth, and commanded them, saying, Go not into
&gt; the way of the Gentiles, and into any city of the Samaritans enter ye not:
&gt; [6] But go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.

Right. Jesus said to stay OUT of there, He didn't say they were IN there, or
that they had &quot;returned.&quot;

What an idiot.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; They were scattered among the nations, just like Jeremiah said.

&gt;&gt;&gt;  Remember Jesus was searching them out of Samaria: &quot;

&gt;&gt; Jesus wasn't &quot;searching them out.&quot; He was telling them the day would come
&gt;&gt; when no one would worship in their place (Mt. Hermon), nor in Jerusalem,
&gt;&gt; but those who worshipped would worship in Truth and in Spirit.

&gt; Matthew 10:5-6
&gt;    These twelve Jesus sent forth, and commanded them, saying, Go not into
&gt; the way of the Gentiles, and into any city of the Samaritans enter ye not:
&gt; [6] But go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.
">

[correction: I said &quot;Hermon&quot; when it was &quot;Gerizim.&quot;]

That there were some Samaritans in Israel is irrelevant.

&quot;Most of them&quot; did NOT return to Israel, as Tiglath Pileser III took half
and scattered them among the nations, and seeded the nations into Israel.

And this was PART of the fulfillment of what Jeremiah spoke, saying God
would scatter the seed of the house of Israel, and the house of Judah in the
NATIONS.

Thus, there ARE NO &quot;Israelites&quot; or &quot;Jews&quot; that are not related to the
Gentiles.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; It's the idiots who go to the temple that will be in trouble.

&gt; The Ikes don't go to the temple.

You've got that right--Jesus said NOT TO: HIS followers will worship in
Spirit and in Truth--they have no interest in the backwards workings of
idiots.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Tiglath-Pileser III &quot;sowed&quot; them among the Gentiles, and the Gentiles
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; among them, dispersing them.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Satan, you're an idiot.

&gt;&gt; No, you are about to prove you are.

&gt;&gt;&gt;  They've been returning. You haven't heard the news?

&gt;&gt; There is no one in Israel from the ten tribes.

&gt; Satan, you're a total idiot.
">

See, you just prove me right again by not addressing the prophecy...

Jer 31:27 Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will sow the house
of Israel and the house of Judah with the seed of man, and with the seed of
beast.

There is no longer any such thing as an &quot;Israelite&quot; or &quot;Jew&quot; according to
the Old Testament definitions of the words--they passed away thousands of
years ago.

It was already known in Jesus' day that the former tribesmen were not called
&quot;Israel,&quot; but &quot;Samaritans,&quot; because they were already mingled with the
Gentiles.

So, too, few people calling themselves &quot;Jews&quot; in Jesus' day were actually
Jews either, as Jesus testifies of Nathanael &quot;Behold an Israelite INDEED in
whom is no GUILE!&quot; (&quot;Guile&quot; from the Greek word &quot;dolos,&quot; meaning &quot;decoy,&quot;
i.e. Nathanael wasn't a &quot;decoy&quot; Israelite, but a REAL one!)

THAT'S how few real Israelites were left among the Jews in Jesus' day.

But fools are hell bent on raising hell, and that's exactly what they'll
accomplish by ignoring Jesus' teachings on the matter.

And you're just another one of them.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;snip&gt;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Play your games with the word of the Lord while you can, Satan.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It's you playing games, as Jesus has already come, and the gate is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; shut, and won't be opened again, as Jesus is now the temple of God,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and the keystone of the assembly of believers.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Satan, you're a liar.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Oh, Jesus ISN'T the temple of God, and He is NOT the keystone of the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; assembly of believers?

&gt;&gt;&gt; Satan, you'te a liar. Jesus and we in Him are the temple of the Holy
&gt;&gt;&gt; Spiirit, and there is the temple in which the circumcision elect will
&gt;&gt;&gt; fulfill their debt to the law in His millennial kingdom.

&gt;&gt; Which is a lie from the depths of hell.

&gt; Lyin' Ike!
">

The lies are all yours: When you say &quot;the circumcision elect will fulfill
their debt to the law,&quot; you are saying that Jesus' redemptive work on the
cross isn't sufficient, which is a flat-out lie.

Jesus fulfilled the law or NO ONE is saved.

But this isn't the only lie in your statement, as there is no &quot;circumcision
elect.&quot;

There is the elect of the Old Covenant, Israel, and the elect of the New
Covenant, the Gentile believers, and the doubly-elect yet to come who will
be from both the previous elects, i.e. those who will &quot;the sing of the song
of Moses AND the song of the Lamb,&quot; etc., etc.

That's why Jesus declared an end to temple in Jerusalem, and in every other
place, now and in the age to come.

But there is no accounting for stupidity--idiots WILL rebuild the temple, to
everyone's hurt.

Good job, Satan.
