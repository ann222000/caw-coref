Although there is circumstantial evidence in favor of the Stratford man,
it is not incontestable and there is subtantial evidence for strong
suspicion...which is the main reason for the debate lasting as it has since the
1850s. The Stratfordians do not have a smoking gun document. And do not be
fooled by Stratfordians who try to ridicule alternative candidates by
remarkring that there are so many, some 30 claimants.

The bottom line is since World War I only two have any reasonable chance
of being the true author...Oxford and Derby, and the latter married the
former's oldest daughter.. so they are intertwined after 1594...and there is
rock solid evidence in hand, my hand, that both employed the Shakespeare pen
name...and that after Oxford's death in 1604 Derby was the senior Grand
Possessor...the literary executor for the 17 dramas (half the canon) kept from
publication for decades until the First Folio.

All the pre-Folio bibliographical evidence goes against the Stratford
man who also was a secret Roman Catholic Catholic which categorically wipes him
out at the true Bard for many reasons..to say nothing more of the totally
messed up situation inside Holy Trinity Church with regard to the final and
totally uncertain resting place of this Stratford man. As Jonson in the First
Folio said of the Bard:
&quot;thou arte a moniment...(yes moniment, a collected body of works) without a
tomb&quot; There is no reason for Jonson to say &quot;without a tomb&quot; unless there some
hanky panky with the First Folio project and the Church in question.

Concerning the deep schism within the Stratfordian camp on the
ultrasensitive Catholic Question read my essay &quot;Bardgate: Was Shakespeare a
Secret Catholic?&quot; in volume six (2003) issue of the journal The Oxfordian.

Finally, Marlowe and Bacon are not credble candidates, the latter's
claim being overshadowed by Oxford's claim since the 1920s. Bacon wrote two
extremely obsequious letters to Southampton and Henry de Vere (Oxford's heir,
the 18th Earl) in January 1624 when the First Folio was being shipped to
booksellers in London...beggig these two heroes who triumphed over King James
in the pivotal Spanish Marriage crisis in late 1623.

If Bacon was the Bard certainly he had overwhelming incentive to remind
Southampton (No Less) that he was after all the Bard...but he did not do
that...he remained silent... and besides Southampton destroyed Bacon in 1621 by
leading the impeachment inparliament against him. How ironic! Shakespeare's
only known patron destroys the great Bard in the Spring of 1621...then
Bacon-Bard wants or seeks restoration but in his begging private letters to
Oxford and Southampton he refuses to undercore that he is the grear Bard and
that his First Folio is now on sale. And both Earls totally ignored the pleas
of the great Bacon Bard, despite the huge footprint of the First Folio on the
minds of Englishmen at that moment.

This pattern of historical evidence is totally out of the question if
Bacon was the Bard...meaning that as rock solid evidence it wipes him out as a
candidate.
Bacon's claim to be Shakespeare is total rubbish..like that for Rutland (born
in 1576?!!!!) and everyone else other than the Derby-Oxford duo. The
Shakespeare debate is highly polarized, has come down to the incumbent and this
duo. All the rest is total rubbish.

The fact that the &quot;debate&quot; arose in the 1850s says a lot more,
but, hey, Buckeye, let's figure it out one more time. I use
quotation marks around the word debate because I fully
doubt Oxfordians/oh-let's-include-Derby-so-someone-was-alive-ians
have any argument equal to my own, and I am a lowly amateur
and they have the websites and the organizations and the constant
skulking off from discussion. Some debate.

Oxford University does not claim Oxford wrote Shakespeare so
if it isn't feathering its nest with its illustrious alumni's literary
accomplishments, I truly feel the rest of you need to sit down
and pay more attention.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; The Stratfordians do not have a smoking gun document.

"/>

That would be just more for you to ignore--such as the eyewitness accounts
you pretend are fraudulent! Who wants to put any more real evidence
into your obfuscatorial process of negating it to support a fantasy?
No wonder Oxfordians skulk off when asked for substance--they reject
the historical record and adhere to the unexplained.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; And do not be
&gt; fooled by Stratfordians who try to ridicule alternative candidates by
&gt; remarkring that there are so many, some 30 claimants.

"/>

No, some 64, according to Caius Marcius, who printed the
list at HLAS.

&quot;Claimant&quot; is entirely the wrong word. These people had nothing to do
with your 20th and 21st century &quot;theories.&quot; You people are the claimants,
and you are falsely accrediting your &quot;supposed surrogates.&quot;

There is no evidence Oxford ever attended or even heard of a Shakespeare
play. There is no way to know what he felt about the plays. He may have
thought they were a disgusting waste of time. He may be thoroughly
insulted if he knew that there was a society formed to credit him with
writing the plays. The society accrediting him has no evidence for their belief
and if Oxford were alive and knew of their activities, he might bring a lawsuit
to make them cease and desist. That is how valid and worthy their teachings
are--they present baseless speculation and run away from discussion. But they
cannot connect their, let's say it... &quot;supposed surrogate&quot; ... to the works of
Shakespeare.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; The bottom line is since World War I only two have any reasonable chance
&gt; of being the true author...

"/>

The 64 could stage a round-robin elimination tournament.
They each present their evidence or get lost.
Whoops, only Shakespeare has evidence.
Get the idea of where the &quot;debate&quot; is heading?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Oxford and Derby, and the latter married the
&gt; former's oldest daughter..

"/>

Whew!

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; so they are intertwined after 1594...

"/>

Careful who you intertwine with, right, Orazio?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; and there is
&gt; rock solid evidence in hand, my hand, that both employed the Shakespeare pen
&gt; name...

"/>

Rocks are solid, but paper beats rocks.

Pen names don't have entire families of four+ generations
using the name. Pen names can't be valid using the existing
name of a man in the industry, a man far more available
and accountable.

As for the solid evidence in your hand, that's called self-gratification.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; and that after Oxford's death in 1604 Derby was the senior Grand
&gt; Possessor...

"/>

Of what? Venereal disease?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; the literary executor for the 17 dramas (half the canon) kept from
&gt; publication for decades until the First Folio.

"/>

Right, and he wrote the seven that didn't exist yet? Usual malarkey.
If Derby was &quot;grand possessor&quot; (make up more hokey crap to fit
in with the hokey imagined conspiracy that was not documented
but that latter day Oxfordians agree to anyway), then he was
not author.

Oxfordians' problem is entirely with history, not with so-called
&quot;Stratfordianism.&quot;

That is why the ridiculously named &quot;Shakespeare Fellowship&quot;
has taken it upon themselves to revise literary history, according to
their mission statement. History shows that they are foolish
misinterpreters, so instead of abiding by history, they decided that
all they have to do is revise literary history and then they will be
intelligent. They do not see their folly--they skulk off.

It is Oxford they are offending, not me.

They are not revising history, they are adding another chapter and it
has nothing to do with Shakespeare.

This is the messed up situation...
In rattling around looking for things to
1. doubt, and
2. misinterpret,
you are implicating the church which has nothing to do with authorship
and the folio which has nothing to do with the church and leaving it that
there is some perplexing problem which you can't define and we are
supposed to confuse all your elements and agree there is no good answer
(because you pose no question!).

Not as ironic as a 42 year old de Vere seeking patronage from a
twenty-something because he came up with his first poem (although
he had a couple dozen already published despite the stigma and
instead of theatre was hell-bent on licensing tin, wool, oil, and fruit).

Irony is the lifeblood of Oxfordianism. It is laced with ridiculous
impossibility. The most amazing aspect is that Oxfordians post here
with their bare-ass implausibility and ask for respect. Oxford himself
would be cringing for their dear respectability. At least de Vere knew
when to fold 'em.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; then
&gt; Bacon-Bard wants or seeks restoration but in his begging private letters to
&gt; Oxford and Southampton he refuses to undercore that he is the grear Bard and

Yes, Southampton does make a more formidable supposed surrogate
than does Bacon, because he was the flamboyant type and had enough
cash to afford the conspiracy. As Shakespeare's first known patron, he
could control it all from the start.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Circumstantial evidence is indirect in that it involves an inference or a
presumption...usually a reasonable or logical inference but something that it
still not incontestable because someone might offer an alternative
explanation(s) that cannot be ruled out categorically. As we all know, many men
have been put in prison or death row and even executed based on only on
circumstantial evidence and then later exonerated following a DNA test.

If Kathman has some definition of circumstantial evidence that he has the
courage to share with us or a &quot;smoking gun&quot; document in favor of the
crypto-Catholic merchant from Midlands...evidence that is irrefutable,
incontestable evidence...then he should by all means do so.

Crazy people are also known to believe in things which make no sense...in
fact requires one to believe in miracles. The idea of the Strat man...a person
mired in provincial town with a wife and three baby children into his 22th year
and having no incentive...after his willingness in 1585 to ask two hard core
Catholic to be the Godparents of his twins...to break with his family's
ultraCatholicism prior to the defeat of the Spanish Armada in late 1588...when
he was then into his 25th year....that with all this, he could have become a
sophisticated cosmopolitan-minded Bard only 3-4 years later strains credulity.

Crazy people can believe in miracles...and the Stratfordian myth is one
of them. The bottom line is tha the Strat man was a cradle-to-grave secret
Roman Catholic with whom the Stratfordians are now stuck and whose real grave's
location they cannot tell us with any certainty. Bad show. A Very Bad Show.

There's no connection between the authorship of the
Shakespeare works and Bacon's plea to return to the

Bacon's rhetoric is the usual lower-to-higher flattery typical

Peter. I moved to England when I was 20, in 1969. I lived in London,

Bacon and Sausages...robins opening my milk bottles...my
spina-rince...cheshire cheese...dry ginger-ale...public
transportation...betting 10 bob on Red Rum on my wedding day.

I do not miss the loo being in the back garden, ironing collars,

I especially miss the Woolpack in Ipswich and the Crispin in Harwell.

1969 to 1975

In between husbands I had a RAF boyfriend,
The RAF issued two shirts and 10 collars.
According to RAF regulations,
He had to change the collar every day,
but the shirt only once a week.
He's married to a friend of mine, now,
and they live in Wantage.

My mother-in-law had a &quot;bathroom&quot; in her council house,
but the loo was still in the back-garden,
and the entire house (three up-three down)
was heated by two coal fires.
We lived in a caravan,
and went to her house each Saturday for a bath.

You're just over-privileged.

When we were doing conversion, there were lots of houses and flats
that still had gas lighting and shilling geysers
We had both in our flat in Ipswich, along with that marble slab.

I do miss having a plate-rack on top of the cooker, though.
Do you still have those?

When I came back to the states, I learned that the old penny
was exactly the same size and weight as a US 50 cent piece.
Kept us in Cokes for quite a while. ;-)

I'm writing a book about the public houses listed in the mystery
novels of Martha Grimes, which is how I got sucked into the
Shakespeare Authorship question. One of her novels is titled &quot;The
Dirty Duck,&quot; and is set in Stratford. The characters' names are all
derived from the Authorship question.

Among others:

Harvey Schoenberg, who thought W.S. murdered Marlowe, out of jealousy.
George Cholmondely, who was a diamond smuggler.
James Cecil Farraday, tycoon, who had a ward named Penelope.
Gwendolyn Bracegirdle, who lived in a pink stucco house in Sarasota.

I wrote Roberta Ballantine, to ask if she had ever communicated with
the author Grimes, and she said no, but was intrigued,
and we figured out Gwen was an amalgum of Rose {pink} Hoffman,
and either the actress Bracegirdle or
the vicar who recorded Shakespeare's birth.
The manager of the Hoffman estate confirmed that their house was
stucco.

Before I went to work at British Gas, I worked about two weeks running
a cigar wrapping machine at a factory in Ipswich. One of the company
honchos was a regular at the Woolpack, and he always treated me with
dignity, and even stopped by to see me once on the factory floor.

Don't know why my parents named me Susan.
There's no other person in the family by either name,
and my dad had twelve siblings.
Nobody ever called me &quot;Susan.&quot;
I didn't know that was part of my name till I entered kindergarten,
and didn't answer roll call.
Don't have any particular &quot;dislike,&quot;
I just don't associate &quot;Susan&quot; with &quot;Me.&quot;

Speaking of Mad Cow, there's a book called &quot;Deadly Feasts,&quot; by Richard

We had a loo in our bathroom, which was the size of a ballroom (we
rented the lodge at Foremark Hall). The bathroom was painted yellow
and it was like being (or peeing) inside a big cheese. It was also so

Never bathed in the kitchen (sounds rather Dickensian), but we did all
move into the living room in winter to sleep because there was a coal
fire in there and it was so cold in the house. Didn't have a gas meter
although had had one as a student at Sheffield U some years earlier.
Never boiled nappies, but line dried them. Once a cow came by and
started to eat a couple (of nappies, that is).

Forgive the intrusion, but not a lot of people know this!

Before the war, birds didn't know what there was inside milk bottles
and never attacked them. But during the war, the foil tops were
replaced by cardboard ones: a disc with a round incised mark in the
middle so that you could push in a finger-tip to lift the disc out.
The disc fitted inside the neck of the bottle, pressed down onto a
ledge provided on the inside of the neck.

That did not give as good a seal as the old foil top. Especially, if
the bottle was too full when the cardboard disc was pressed in, some
of the cream was left on top of the disc. Given that clue, the birds
caught on pretty quickly. This must have been one of the earliest
reports of birds learning a new trick and passing it on to others.

**********

Dear Lady:

I am a new visitor here, and had no idea that Hermione was a real
pseudonym, but thought it was a pun that another poster aimed at me,
because when I first started posting, others widely accused me of
using my real name, Christine Cooper, as the pseudonym of a variety of
other posters, including John Baker. The post you referenced followed
immediately in time, but not on the same thread, after a post accused
me of being you. Dave More pointed out that Hermione was your
pseudonym, and I posted elsewhere here attempts to clarify that I'm
not you or John Baker or anyone but myself and have not used ANY
pseudonym, not wishing to further fuel the confusion. You'll note
that I didn't use a pseudononymous e-mail address, and please also
note that you hadn't posted here for some time, and as a new visitor,
I had no way of knowing that it was your pseudonym until Dave More
pointed it out to me, as you're not one of the posters who is
identified at the gallery. I stand in the position of &quot;interested but
uninformed layperson,&quot; with respect to the entire controversy. I
meant no disrespect.

Sincerely,

Christine
