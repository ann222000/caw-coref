Okay, the guys can read too, but it's about female type stuff,
so...read at
your own risk.

Apparently I'm in &quot;perimenopause&quot;, meaning that I'm getting some of
the fun
symptoms (wild mood swings, sort-of-hot-flashes, night sweats) and
other
symptoms that may or may not be related (periods every 15 days instead
of
every 28 days, and possibly the mood swings aren't related, it's just
me having my every-5-7-years major depression episode.)

It's that last one that's got me worried. The last time I went thru
the
excessive bleeding thing was right before I left Eddie, and it was
just one
more sign that my body was really, *really* unhappy in the marriage.
(The
other sign was having seizures, although I suspect that was more my
mind
telling me &quot;Get the fuck out now&quot; rather than my body.)  Once I left,
the
bleeding settled down.

So now we're trying to figure out if my adventures are being caused
by
stress (could be, Bart has been making me batshit crazy for the past 3
weeks
and I've started dating other people) or perimenopause (could be, I'm
46 and
supposedly women in my family go thru menopause early, but that's
misleading
since women in my family usually have hysterectomies by the time
they're 36
and that tends to push them into menopause), or if I've got
endometrial
cancer (could be, considering the women in my family who've had the
aforementioned hysterectomies usually did so because of either
endometrial
or cervical cancer).

So I'm going to have a biopsy done...but here's the kicker...they
can't get
me in until August 20th.  That's a fucking month away.  &quot;So what do I
do in
the mean time?&quot;  &quot;Well, you probably want to take a multi-vitamin and
possibly iron pills, since you're bleeding excessively.&quot;  &quot;Uh huh.
My
gasterenterologist would prefer that I not take iron pills, since a
year ago
my liver was fucked up.  But I'll take the vitamins, thanks.  And for
the
pain?&quot;  &quot;Well, ibuprofen...you know, it's just cramps.&quot;  &quot;Uh huh.  Did
you
hear me talk about my liver?  Just because my liver function is normal
now
doesn't mean I want to make it abnormal again, and we're pretty sure
that I
fucked it up last time by taking too much Aleeve or Tylenol or
Ibuprofen...and I already know that taking massive amounts of aspirin
will
just make the bleeding worse.&quot;  &quot;Hmm...wow...well, I just don't
know...we
recommend ibuprofen...and we're not used to women who say 'fuck' down
here.&quot;
(Yeah, well, I'm from the North and women say &quot;fuck&quot; all the time.  I
should
have sent her to Kim's blog - she'd probably never recover.)

And the next time I have a so-called medical professional tell me
their just
cramps...well, I haven't fully formulated the method of torture yet.

So...let's assume a best case scenario here, it's just perimenopause
(which
I guess means when I hit the real menopause stage it gets even more
fun).
Anyone else go through this?  If so, how long did it last?  Would this
be a
really good time to buy stock in whoever manufactures Always (with
wings!)?
Will I get to look forward to *years* of this?  Shit, at the rate I'm
going,
I'll never be able to have sex again - or at least not without lots
of
towels handy and never on the good sheets again.

As for the whole thing with Bart...well, here's some irony for
you...I've
been dating someone who can apparently turn even more reclusive than I
do.
The wild mood swings are partly from that and partly from hormonal
surges, I
guess.  All I know is that I'm back on an anti-depressant because
Daddy says
he suffered thru menopause with Mom and it's unfair to have to go
through
that with me too...so either chemically stablize the mood or find
another
place to live.

Whee.

Apparently I missed some major transition chapter where Bart got
shoved to the background.  The last time I was following this soap,
Lisa Ann was turning into a cheerful baseball mom, though resisting
the title itself.

My wife had sever periods that her GP and a specialist tried various
things on for what seemed like a year before actually doing the
biopsy.  In her case it was cancerous.  A hysterectomy followed by
some pretty aggressive treatments seemed to fix it but it came back
six or seven years later.

In her case, it was a very slow-growing tumor, but I still get very
twitchy at waiting a month for the biopsy.

There is a family component.  Wendy's mother had a hysterectomy at 28
for endometrial cancer and has been OK for thirty years or so
afterwards.  Wendy had a hysterectomy at the same age for the same
problem and wasn't OK.  The doctors don't look for endometrial cancer
in 27 year olds because it's supposedly a disease of menopausal women.

Heh.  You should'a.  A doctor who's trying to kill your liver then
complains about your language sounds like she's trying to keep a woman

southerners here, but only partly succeeding.

Wendy's radiation treatment after the hysterectomy pushed her into
menopause in her twenties.  She went through spasms of depression, but
it was hard to tell if it was situationally based or chemical.  She
tried a few SSRIs that didn't seem to do much for her mood.
Eventually we just lived through it for three years until she
relaunched her career path growth and felt good about herself
situationally.

Here's this woman's two-cents-worth:

I might be menopausal; since I'm 48 (49 in October) I'm almost certainly
perimenopausal.  I've had no symptoms.  No alteration in my cycle.
Nuthin'.  I was diagnosed as moderately depressed about 18 months back,
but considering that my mother has Alzheimer's, my dad has cancer and is
a shut-in, at the time my dog was dying, and my career has become
somewhat problematic, I don't think that had to do with approaching
menopause.

I assume -- perhaps wrongly, but still, it's what I assume -- that my
lack of perimenopausal symptoms is because I've been taking DHEA and
pregnenelone -- prohormones -- for a good decade or more.  I take modest
doses, 25 mgs of each.  I'm just looking to keep my levels at what they
would have been in my twenties.

Don't know whether these would be safe for your liver; you'd have to do
that research yourself.

Cheap and widely available at health food stores.

Hmm.  They stopped my endless bleeding by putting me back on the pill.
It took an entire month of pills to kick in though.  But then the ob-gyn
had originally told me that I could take, like, a week's worth all at
once and that would probably have stopped it faster.  I just opted to be
more conservative because my situation wasn't dire.  I suppose you could
ask about that.

I said, &quot;so do I have to stay on the pill til I'm 85?&quot; and the ob-gyn
said, &quot;well, maybe 55.&quot;

No, you haven't missed anything, I haven't posted it.  I honestly don't know
what the fuck is going on with Bart, beyond what he's telling me.  What he's
telling me is that he's swamped with work and has no time for anything else
at the moment.  Okay, I can deal with that, I've been there.  (There's also
the possibility that the entire company could go down the tubes or get sued
or something, but since he's not giving me all the details, I'm pretty fuzzy
about that.)  What I can't deal with is him not being able to carve five
fucking minutes out of his day a couple days a week to call/email/IM or
something.  It's been like this for about 3 weeks.  I finally caught him
on-line a week ago Weds and asked if he'd broken up with me and neglected to
tell me.  That led into a spirited exchange where, to be honest, I'm kind of
surprised he didn't tell me to eat shit and die, because a lot of men
dislike being called &quot;asshole&quot;, &quot;chickenshit&quot; and &quot;motherfucker&quot;.  (He
probably shouldn't have told me I have control issues.)  The IM exchange was
followed by him calling me, once he realized I'd stepped away from the
computer and was no longer responding to him.  As of last Weds, he said he
hadn't broken up with me, he still loved me, he was just swamped with work.
We were supposed to get together Sunday, but Bryson and the twins decided to
spend the night.  Okay, fine.  We were supposed to get together Tuesday, I
went over there after work, and he's back to being swamped with work.  Even
that was okay.  What wasn't fucking okay was finding out that, despite being
swamped with work, he's still going to Jacksonville for the Regional
games...and he's apparently forgotten that he'd originally asked me to go
with them, because now he and Bryson are rooming with Andy and Ike. And he
said he'd call me when he got done with work Tuesday, and didn't.

But I'm supposed to believe that he still loves me.

So that's the story of Bart.

He has no clue that I'm going thru all of this because I haven't had a
chance to tell him.  (Hell, when the bleeding first started my first thought
was, &quot;Shit, I got pregnant and I'm having a miscarriage!&quot;)

This I don't know about.  I was extremely lucky with this - I had a
hysterectomy three years ago, and in the intervening time have
evidently gone through menopause and come out the other side without
actually noticing.  No hot flashes or night sweats or mood swings.
I'm still sort of marveling at this since in other areas I've been

Oh christ, Lisa Ann, I have NO idea since women in my family don't
officially acknowledge things like hormones, menstruation, or
menopause (or cramps, let me tell you about the time in 7th grade I
called my mom to pick me up because I was hurting so bad and when she
arrived and found out it was cramps, you'd have thought she found out
I was cutting up kittens with pinking shears in spare time from her
expression) BUT let's just keep this &quot;reasonable&quot; wait time in mind
next time some stupid person tells us the US system of non-health-care
is superior to the Canadian system because Americans don't have to
wait to be seen.

But anyway, my sympathies with the bleeding. Ginger-lemon tea and a
cat on the stomach sometimes helps.

You have had a tumultuous year, Lisa Ann. Any and all of it could be
contributing to your psychological well-being right now. You've also
had some serious illnesses and that, too can be disconcerting. If you
have a medication that helps keep you on an even keel right now, you
have part of the battle won.

Some women breeze through menopause and others don't.  The most
important thing right now is to keep you comfortable and get that
biopsy. I assume your doctor knows about the family history....even
knowing that she cannot get you in any earlier? I do know that it can
be a royal PITA sometimes, just trying to get in and see someone and
then get tests done. IIRC, Dover had waits like that last year, didn't
she?

If your GYN will not suggest  pain medication that is compatible with
your liver problems, call your GP, or gastro and see if there is
something they can recommend. The very idea that your GYN is incapable
of prescribing something, did not offer to confer with your gastro,
and on top of it belittled your pain and suffering would encourage me
to come down there to visit with some very large knitting needles to
insert into her eyes. Sideways, perhaps. Would you like me to do that
for you?

Very likely the mood swings, heavy bleeding and cramping is
perimenopause, but going in and taking a look is really best, given
the family history. I wish you had a bit of latitude, though and could
tell that GYN to go to hell and find yourself another one.

Best to you.

Wait times are not universal. There are many factors that come into
&quot;wait times&quot;.

My wife, before I met her, went to the same dentist for many years.
She even considered him a &quot;friend&quot; socializing with him outside of the
office. She was always happy with the way his office was run.

Then one day, his wife comes in, fires the office manager and takes
over herself. Many months later, my wife loses a filling. She calls up
for an appointment and is told that they can &quot;squeeze her in&quot; in about
2 weeks. She's pissed. I'm pissed.

I told her to call my dentist, tell them she was referred by me, and
they will probably take you within 24 hours. She called, got the
problem taken care of the next day, and switched to them premanently.

The problem is not that the system is overloaded as it is in other
countries, but greedy doctors that need to make sure every time slot
is full leaving no room for those people with last minute emergencies.

While universal health care is nice, once somebody does not have to
pay for a service, that service has no value and people will overuse
it, thereby overloading the system. Most of us would not pay the fee
to see the doctor for a common cold, bit if it were &quot;free&quot;, people
will take advantage of it.

The office manager runs the office the way the doc wants it to be run.

No, the problem is that the system is overloaded in many specialties
and that insurance companies reimbursement fees are such that  many
practitioners have 2 or more offices to maintain a larger patient
base.

Oh, listen, I don't know doctors who are starving, but let's use my GP
as an example....I have a $20 co-pay for my visits to her. That is ALL
she gets - my co-pay. I have seen the Aetna forms. This woman will
spend 45 minutes talking to me in the office. She calls me on the
phone if I leave a message, she tells me to call her on the weekends
if I need anything.

My rheumatologist and all my other specialists, get a $40 co-pay AND
they get more from Aetna, too. It is almost impossible to get in to
see them without a 3-4 week delay.

In fact, my nutritionist, who gets a $40 co-pay, makes out even better
than the specialists do, according to the Aetna web pages.

Now it's true that it's getting harder and harder to find a
dermatologist or ENT or ophthalmologist who takes insurance these days
as so many can earn a much better living currying favor with a
clientele who likes plastic work and elective surgeries.

And there are fewer and fewer OB/GYNs these days for maybe half a
dozen reasons.

Doctors are entitled to earn a living just like MBAs, stock brokers,
venture capitalists and plumbers are. MDs are not required to take
vows of poverty, nor should they be.

Neal, you're drinking the Flavor-Aide. I made the mistake of getting
my retinal tear lasered, and now I'm uninsurable. Apparently &quot;the
system&quot; would rather allow me to go blind, or wait for my retina to
tear off and have me go on disability because even if repairable I
wouldn't be able to work for six to eight weeks after surgery instead
of a fairly minor office procedure. When I had insurance, I had a $10
co-pay. And like Dover, I still wasn't using up all the healthcare I
was &quot;entitled&quot; to, just because it was cheap.

I mean, I honestly don't understand this argument. Are there so many
hypochondriacs among us? Why doesn't it make more sense to treat
people early instead of waiting for the problem to get large enough to
&quot;deserve&quot; treatment? Why not see the dermatologist and be reassured
that the mole isn't cancerous, instead of waiting until it obviously
IS-- when treatment options will be much more expensive and possibly
even useless?

I went through five GPs in four years; I changed over once when the GP
told me tubal ligation caused menopause, and the rest apparently went
through the rotating door of being an HMO GP.  It is the area;
apparently the reimbursements in Santa Cruz are much lower than over
the hill, and the reimbursements in the Bay Area are lower in relation
to cost of living than other places. We don't have the problem Nevada
has (so far) with lack of ob-gyns because of malpractice insurance
costs, but I keep hearing that in general, this is an issue even if
not dire enough here to force established doctors out.

I just realized I've lived the no-co-pay experience.  Back in the day,
UCSC had a student clinic where you had no co-pay.  If you got sick you
went to the clinic and they treated you and it was entirely covered by
your student fees.  If you needed a prescription it was cheapo and
heavily subsidized.  I don't recall anyone going to the clinic if they
weren't sick.  I only went for sore throats that I thought might be

This idea that free or inexpensive care encourages people to seek
medical care unnecessarily has been the basis of medical savings
accounts, too. I have never seen any proof that there is anything but
a financial motive behind it.

Does she have a co-pay for visits to a doctor? Or is the emergency
room the only alternative to not getting treated at all? I'm sure
you're aware that a subset of emergency rooms MUST treat people
regardless of ability to pay, whereas preventative care through a
regular doctor and office hours is often out of reach. You've brought
up yet another failure of the US health insurance system, rather than
an example of why universal care wouldn't work.

Bzzzt, foul Neal!  We're responding with *our* personal anecdotes to argue
with you.  You just brought in a third party, and one who we already know is
a thief...undoubtedly why Kim named her the
Formerly-Pregnant-and-Pregnant-again-thief, so it's not a reach to believe
that she would also show the same disregard for medical resources that she
shows towards retailers.

But seriously, if medical care were absolutely free, what would *you* do?
(I'm curious at this point, not trying to be snarky.  For one thing, your
head on the wall would clash with the  deer, moose, bear and wolf.)  Would
you trot yourself off to the doctor (whether it be a clinic, the ER or
whatever?) for ever hang-nail and runny nose?  Or would you be an absolute
stoic and never go until the broken bones have finally caused you gangrene?
Or would you be somewhere in the middle and react the same way you do now?

My sister is the queen of the hypochondriacs in my opinion.  At age 38 her
entire identity is tied up with how many medications she's on and how many
specialists she needs to see.  Although they have good insurance, she still
has to pay a healthy co-pay and meet a family deductible.  Add into it that
her son is possibly autistic and was born cleft-affected, her husband is
seriously overweight and being treated for high blood pressure, and their
daughter was recently diagnosed ADHD...guess where a huge chunk of their
income goes?  (Dear God I'm so glad she doesn't read this group!)  If
medical care had no cost to her, she would still be that way, with the same
family she has now.  If she had no insurance but didn't qualify for
Medicaid, I have no doubt she would be the same way she is now.  That's
*who* - or what - she's decided she is.  High cost or no cost, my sister
would be the same way.

I think that's true of most people, to be honest.  Not all, obviously; but
sometimes I think this debate (would people abuse the medical system if
healthcare were free or no cost?) is framed wrong.  Some might, sure.  But I
think the majority of people would just breathe a sigh of relief that they
no longer have to worry about losing everything they've worked for if they
get sick...and follow their old patterns.  The person who has insurance and
ignores heart attack symptoms even though they have good insurance is still
going to ignore their symptoms if they have no insurance is still going to
ignore their symptoms if they have low/no-cost healthcare.  And so on.

You know, this all made sense in my head...

Just what I get in a standard multi-vitamin.  The bleeding started tapering

Oh, and I also eat a lot of cheese and drink a lot of milk.  I'm seriously

emails and talking for a few days.  He reads, owns his own company, has one
of the few profiles I've seen on Match.com where everything is spelled
correctly and the sentences are coherent (even funny). (I'm not sure if the
fact that this is important to me means I'm raising my standards, or
lowering them to the point of &quot;Hey, you're a good speller?  Yeah, I'm
there.&quot;)   I told him about AFCA, and he peeked in through Google, wrote
back and said we were apparently a group of self-satisfied nerds - but that
was okay because he comes from a long line of them.  (It came out a lot
funnier in the email.)  At this point my main worry is that he won't be as
intelligent and funny in person, and we'll have to abandon lunch and go to
the library where we can each log on to a computer and just email each
other.

He also recommended an author I hadn't heard of before, Tim Dorsey.  I'm
reading &quot;The Big Bamboo&quot; right now, and have to agree that Jonathan's
description of Dorsey's writing is pretty accurate.  &quot;Imagine if Carl
Hiaasen, Hunter Thompson and Gregory MacDonald all dropped acid together and
then decided, 'Man we need to write a book together.'&quot;  This evening I have
nearly peed my pants from laughing, shot milk through my nose, and been
banished from the dock for disturbing the fish, then banished from the deck
for disturbing Mom.

Oh, and today's &quot;Mom story&quot;...she's on summer hours now so she gets Friday's
off.  Since Daddy and I work, she gets the house to herself (which she's
really missed having since I moved here.)  She spent the day working on
gourds.  I'm so proud of her; she did this beautiful, intricate carving on a
gourd; autumn leaves.  When I came home and realized she was using her
Dremel, I had to go inspect her.  She was, as you can imagine, rather
indignant.  &quot;I'm fine!&quot; she insisted..  &quot;I don't know why no one believes
me!&quot;  Well, she looked fine, so I just sat out there and told her about
Jonathan.  Her reaction was &quot;He sings, plays several instruments and has
power tools?  What's not to like?&quot;  She wasn't nearly as thrilled about the
spelling as I was, just the power tools.

She said that Angel, who works with Daddy, came over and asked if Mom  was
making her something pretty...&quot;I told her I was trying to...but I kept
getting interrupted,&quot; Mom complained.  &quot;Then she asked me if I'd been
drinking!  Lisa, you know me!  I *never* drink and Dremel!&quot;

Which is true, we don't let her play with her power tools when she's been
drinking.  The glue is now off-limits too.  She can't even have coffee when
she's gluing, just water.  And possibly acetone if it's been a bad day.

Later, however, I noticed she had a chunk missing out of her finger, and
asked her about it.  &quot;I didn't do it with the Dremel!&quot; she said angrily.

&quot;Then how'd you do it?&quot;

&quot;Oh, I had to open a box at work...so I used a pair of scissors...and I
accidently cut a chunk out of my finger.&quot;

&quot;Mom, this is why we don't let you have scissors.  You don't use them
properly.&quot;

&quot;Other people use scissors to open boxes!  I've seen them!&quot;

&quot;Are other people missing chunks of fingers?&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; she said mutinously.

She says I treat her like a child.  I can't imagine why.

Will *NOT* be enough. Minerals are bulky.   If you take just

You need a quart per day or its equivalent in cheese to get your

Hey, I'm no nerd.  I'm a geek.

Anyway, go spend a few bucks on &quot;chelated calcium/magnesium.&quot;
(&quot;Chelated&quot; means it's protein-bound, improving absorption.)  Should
have something like a 2/1 ratio of calcium to magnesium.  Start getting
1000 to 1500 mgs per day of calcium, and 500 to 750 mgs of magnesium.
Take 'em with a meal that includes fat.  And if you're a sun-screen
fanantic, take 1000 IUs of D with it, or you won't absorb the calcium.

Give it a month or two, and see how you feel.  We're not talking a big
outlay of cash, here.

There was no downside.  Not only was he as funny and smart in person as he
is in email, he was even cuter than his pictures.  (Yeah, well, sometimes I
have to pander to my shallow side, you know?)

Lunch lasted 3 hours...partly because we sat and talked for an hour before
even starting to eat (it was a buffet, so we weren't sitting there letting
the food get cold.)  He'd told me before hand he was going to spend the
night in Charlotte (he lives in Durham), so after lunch he went &amp; checked in
at his hotel, then we walked around downtown Charlotte for awhile, found a
bar, and sat and talked for a few more hours.  Went back to the hotel for a
bit, then found a sushi place for dinner.  I'm still pretty timid about
sushi, but he did convince me to try little baby octopus.  I had to close my
eyes to actually get it in my mouth, but once I started chewing, it was
pretty tasty.  The other stuff - yellow tuna, red tuna, squid and halibut -
was pretty good too, and easier to eat because it wasn't looking at me.  In
between feedings of raw fish, we talked some more.  Back to the hotel, where
(for once) I'll be discreet; there's a chance he might start reading this
group.  But there was a lot of talking there, too.

Breakfast this morning, more talking, then we went our separate ways.  I
don't know if we'll get together next here in Lyman (upside, the lake,
familiar territory for me, Doc &amp; Brenda.  Downside; my folks and the
implication of meeting my folks, even though it's just because I live with
them.) or up in Durham (upside; he doesn't live with his folks, so there's
no awkwardness there.  Downside; what if he's a serial killer with a really
good cover and his killing ground is Durham, not Charlotte, and that's the
only reason I survived?).  All I know is that I've also steered him to Kim's
blog, he's referred me to a funny blog, we both know that we're sick and
twisted people...and we apparently like that about each other.

When Doc and Brenda were encouraging me to tell Bart to take a flying fuck
and start seeing other people, one of the things Doc kept repeating was,
&quot;You know, Bart's not stupid...but Lis, you're really smart.  You could do a
lot better.&quot;  One of the several things Jonathan and I have in common is
being tired of being &quot;The Smart One&quot; in a relationship.  If we become a
couple, it appears we'd be able to take turns.  Sort of like a designated
driver, but I guess one of us could be the designated dummy.  &quot;Oh, hon, you
know, I've had such a crappy day, I just wanna be stupid for awhile.  Would
you mind providing all the intelligence and wit tonight when we go out with
friends?&quot;

Worse comes to worse, I can look forward to some really entertaining emails
in the future. &lt;g&gt;

Serial killers can't spell. It's a known fact.

'K, next time you're in Durham, go to the Magnolia Grill.

http://www.uncpress.unc.edu/magnoliagrillcookbook/mg.html

Then drive down to Chapel Hill and go to Breadman's and have the
blueberry coffee cake.  Then go to Dip's and have anything.  One of you
get the cornbread and one of you get the biscuits, then share.

Doc and Brenda aren't exactly Bart's best friends, are they?

Weren't Doc and Brenda people you met through Bart?  This is

Isn't being the smart one sort of just what happens, though, rather than

silent for a while?

Yeah, it is interesting, isn't it?  Christine and Michael are still friends
with me, too...and I suspect that if I wanted to keep in touch with Shelly,
that would be okay.  (Which would really be weird...&quot;Well, no things didn't
work out with Bart, but hey, his ex-wife is my new BFF!&quot;)

As Doc explained it to me, yeah, they're friends with Bart, but just because
things haven't worked out with me and Bart shouldn't mean that I can't still
be friends with them.  Definitely a good thing.  Although I suspect, like
child custody, weekend outings will have to be alternated...

With Jonathan?  Nothing.  If he had something to say, I suspect he'd say it.
If he didn't have something to say, he'd probably just pick up his own book,
or grab the guitar or mandolin, or whatever.  He's also that that
&quot;extroverted introvert&quot; thing going, like I do.

There was a reason for all the talking, we had a lot of similar experiences
and opinions to discuss.  And I think we were competing on who could make
the other snort food/drink through their nose.  There's no winner yet, but I
suspect we'll continue trying.

That would be really important for me. I dislike being the better
(or worse) of any attribute in any relationship, M or F. I like
being on an equal stance. Well, except for height, I probably
couldn't relate too well wiht a 6'2&quot; woman.
