Human Microchip Implants , Electronic Torture, &amp; Mind Control

- A Personal Account

[Editor's Note: People have discovered ways to disable microchip implants and we will make more information available here soon. I will relay more information to the author of this article on techniques that may prove useful to neutralize implants. What I've discovered from the books of Brice Taylor and Cisco Wheeler is that most individuals involved in placing implants in unsuspecting victims are usually themselves victims of mind control programming and they don't know -     on a conscious level at least- that they are implanting people. Of course, some programmers, handlers, or implanters do know what they are doing and willfully participate, but most do not, as hard as that is to believe. Mind control is a very insidious and dark game which uses everybody involved,  except those at the very top who act as the manipulators and puppeteers. See the Mind Control page for more information and ideas on countermeasures ( http://educate-yourself.org/mc/ )...Ken Adachi]

Dear Mr. Adachi:

I am reading very carefully your internet material concerning electronic torture and mind control, for I, too, am a victim of an involuntary microchip implant. An historian by profession, I have recorded the effects of the microchip implant and my thoughts about them in a journal that now numbers almost 300 pages. A summary of my situation follows this note.

Sincerely, MHW

---------------------------------

Get ready. A new science is developing that victimizes countless individuals and promotes bigotry and inhumane practices on an inconceivable scale. That science involves the use of involuntarily implanted microchips in humans. A new form of torture and mind control from traditional methods, the science is little understood and little accepted in the scientific community. Psychiatrists and other doctors treating victims of microchip implants normally mis-diagnose their symptoms as Alzheimer’s disease or dementia.

Even writing about such a topic almost automatically labels one schizophrenic, paranoid, or, in the least, a crackpot.

First, let me say a word about microchip devices. Microchips are tiny instruments that drive various functions of computers and other electronic equipment. They are about the size of a large B-B pellet; however, they are getting increasingly smaller.

Veterinarians started implanting them in dogs, cattle, and horses fifteen to twenty years ago to allow the owners to track their animals and prove ownership. Today’s microchips are almost microscopic and represent state-of-the-art technology.

Manufactured from silicone, they are virtually impossible to detect once they are implanted

A little over a year ago, while living in Mexico, many bizarre and menacing events began occurring in my life, things that completely bewildered me. I knew that I was not schizophrenic or paranoid. Although in my late sixties, I enjoy extremely good mental and physical health. As those actions became increasingly threatening, I ever-so-gradually learned that I had become the victim of an involuntary microchip implant. One of three dentists that I used in Mexico probably injected the tiny chip into my gum tissue or embedded it in a crown. Also a hair transplant specialist in the United States had the opportunity to implant the microchip in my head. All of those suspects belong to the medical community and swore to uphold the Hippocrates oath. But, of course, we know that doctors are no more moral and ethical than other non-medical individuals.

Knowing the value of documentation, I began keeping a journal of those unusual happenings. I not only studied my notes for clues about who was involved and how they conducted their handiwork but I also performed research on microchip implants and their use in electronic torture and mind control over the internet. The result of that research revealed that other people who claimed that they hosted microchip implants had suffered similar experiences.

Many of their symptoms paralleled mine. In addition to those firsthand accounts, I found other data on the internet using the keywords “microchips, microchip implants, electronic torture, and mind control.” Although most of the articles took a particular slant on the topics, e.g., the Illuminati, the CIA, government control, etc., they all contained useful information.

Knowledge about my harassers and their modus operandi evolved slowly. More than six months went by before I knew the extent of their capability. Finally, however, I found out from experience that through the microchip implant and the computer program that operated with it, my torturers were able to perform the following actions:

(1) Monitor my movements.

(2) Hear and record my conversations along with those with whom I talked. The harassers occasionally played back to me through the inner ear excerpts of some of those conversations.

(3) See my body during those movements and also when I was immobile (especially when I slept) in 3-D. They can zoom in on any part of the body and see that part much like a cat scan views the body. I do not yet know whether they view my body in true color or black and white. Nor do I know whether the device allows them to see my front and back simultaneously.

(4) Apply a variety of torture techniques to my body. Those include:

(a) sending pain and a sensation of pin pricks in my shoulders, face, elbows, and other areas,

(b) bombarding my body with electrical jolts and tremors,

(c) zapping my brain with laser-like rays that make a clicking/crackling sound, attempting to destroy brain cells

(d) causing severe cramping, mainly in my legs, and numbness in my limbs from the base of the spinal column to my toes,

(e) making me cough through pinpricking the inside of my throat and causing a partial erection by touching the inside of the urethra, and

(f) causing headaches, stomach aches, and dizziness.

(5) Transmit voices either into my brain or into my inner ear and also project voices and other sounds through objects near me, i.e., the TV, a PC, and other electrical devices and even into the open air near me.

Sounds may take the form of knocking on your door (when there is nobody there), dogs barking

(when there are no dogs around),

and birds cooing or singing (when there are no birds).

(6) READ MY THOUGHTS. Several manufacturers have developed microchip programs with that capability. At first, the program picked up only a few one and two syllable words. Now, however, those thoughts appear on their computer monitor in their entirety, probably somewhat like automated, computerized captions for the hearing impaired on TV. I know this because I often heard the terrorists repeating my thoughts, almost as fast as I developed them. They often used to repeat my silent prayers, with the reader’s voice only a word or so behind my words.

My journal and observations concerning the tormentors and the effects of the microchip implant total well over 200 pages. Therefore, I shall summarize what I found out about my harassers, who form a conspiracy of several factions:

(1) The principal perpetrators and the ones who manipulate the PC microchip program are a Mexican Evangelical family with close ties to Evangelicals in the United States. They also probably lived for many years in the U. S., probably in the mid-West or the upper South. Their two, possibly three children were probably born in the United States. They probably receive both technical assistance and funding from fellow Evangelicals from the United States.

I often wondered what caused those crazies to target me, so I started doing research on the Evangelical movement. I found that many people in the Evangelical camp were social misfits and deviants of one description or another. After conducting that research, I slowly began to fathom their evil mentality. Although I lived a monastic life in a proverbial glass house, their sick minds doubtlessly perceived that I was gay! After all, I lived alone, which is very uncommon in Mexico and the Third World. Lest you think it incredible that people would attempt to torment others for that reason, read about the members of the Westboro Baptist Church in Topeka, Kansas. Those nut cases demonstrate at funerals of soldiers slain in Iraq because they believe it is God’s punishment for homosexuality in the United States! But sexual preference, whether heterosexual, homosexual, or bi-sexual, has nothing to do with hate-motivated acts.

People can convince themselves of anything to justify their playing out the evil that lurks in their twisted minds.

(2) The wacko Evangelicals found accomplices in a few dissident students at a private university where I taught. To keep discipline, I sometimes asked students to leave the classroom. Some of those students took affront and set out to get even with me.

They later collaborated with the Evangelicals in disseminating gossip by sending emails, along with secretly taken photos of me, to students in the thirty-two other campuses of that university system.

(3) Other collaborators came from disgruntled townspeople, parents of young people whom I had run away from my house when they came to park in cars across the street and talk in loud, vulgar terms about me, drink, and smoke marijuna.

(4) Additional accomplices include people in the town government, especially the police. About two years after I moved to my retirement site in Mexico and built my house, I wrote a long letter concerning illegal immigration by Mexicans into the United States, pointing out the negative effects in both the United States and Mexico. I mailed that letter to Congresspersons, government officials, and friends in the United States. In the article, I spoke in very unflattering terms about the Mexican police and army, who often abet drug smugglers and human traffickers.

Thus, a coalition, each element with its own grievance, gathered around and supported the perverted Evangelical family.

I first realized the existence of that conspiracy and the effects of the electronic torture and mind control that accompanied it when I made a trip back to the States in December of 2005 to visit my son and his family. On that trip, my vehicle broke down on the Mexican interstate, and I had to spend three days in a nearby small town while it was being repaired. In that town I suffered all types of verbal harassment and physical torture. The torture consisted of electrical shocks and violent electrical-like tremors in my body while in or near my hotel room. When I crossed the border into the United States, the harassment continued. Not long after leaving the border, I heard voices in the vehicle that at first seemed to come from the driver door panel. The radio was off. I gradually discovered that instead they came from my brain, transmitted there through the microchip implant driven by the terrorists’ computer program. As the terror increased in intensity, I learned more
about it.

Naturally I sought information about how to neutralize the microchip. Several private investigative firms on the internet stated that they were able to locate the device. However, I found only one company, located in Niagra Falls, Canada, that claimed that it could also disarm the microchip. The firm quoted a non-negotiable price of U.S. $15,800 for the work, with no written guarantees.

After more than three years in Mexico, I moved back to the United States. Although the continual harassment was not the cause of my return, it was indeed a factor. The electronic torture and attempted mind control did not stop at the border. After my return to the U. S., the terrorism continued. Based on advice that I found in various sources, I experimented with several methods of nullifying the effects of the electronic torture and attempted mind control. I encased my head with aluminum foil while I slept. I installed chicken wire on all sides, top, and bottom of my bed. I exposed myself during lightening and thunder storms. None of those measures proved effective in countering the torture and mind control activities. But eventually I shall find that way, and when I do, I will share it with the world.

People who place involuntary microchip implants in humans and people who use those chips for electronic torture and mind control represent are perverts in every sense of the word, regardless of the reasons for their actions. Only cruel, sick minds can contrive those actions and toy with the minds and bodies of victims as if they were playing a video game. The psychos rob their victims of a shred of privacy: They can see you at all times, day and night, hear your conversations, read your email correspondence

(including your business account numbers and passwords),

and even monitor your thoughts. They follow a “textbook,” which is essentially a users manual for the PC program that operates the microchip along with instructions about applying electronic torture and exercising mind control to victims. All of their actions are undertaken in utter secrecy. I am confident, however, that the growing misuse of microchips will eventually force governments, science, and industry to develop ways to locate those individuals and groups to punish them. No punishment is too severe for perpetrators of electronic torture and mind control carried out through microchips.

The warped minds of the tormentors focus on all types of victims, regardless of race, gender, social and economic status, religion, or age. From my research, I learned that the tormentors usually choose victims who live alone, as they have no witnesses to the effects of the torture. I suspect that in years to come we will discover that some mass murderers and parents who kill their children are victims of implanted microchips. Two such murderers have made news in the last few years: Andrea Yates, who drowned all five of her children, and Leanna Laney, who killed two of her young sons and left a third one incapacitated for life. Both women were believed to be good and devoted mothers. Both women heard inner voices commanding them to commit infanticide. One of the women said the voice was that of the devil;

the other one, that it was the voice of God. I suggest that perverts, perhaps sick Evangelicals, using microchip implants may have supplied those “voices.”

What are the objectives of the perverted cowards who use microchips instead of facing their opponents? Each group of the perverts has its own agenda, but in general here is what they seek to do:
(1) Make others think that you are losing or have lost your mind. They do this by projecting you with voices whose origins you do not know, causing you to lash out at the voices and react in other seemingly strange ways. People who witness you apparently talking to yourself and making gestures assume that you have gone crazy. You lose any semblance of credibility. To the public and the medical community, you are either schizophrenic or paranoid.

(2) Isolate you from society. By spreading rumors, sending anonymous messages to people who know you, causing irritability in you that makes you querulous and unpleasant to others, people begin to avoid you.

(3) Cause you actually to lose your mind. By projecting the voices and other sounds, applying electronic torture, letting you know that they are watching you every second of the day and night, etc. they hope to drive you slowly into either thinking that you might be imagining those actions or actually drive you crazy out of frustration at being able to do nothing and failure to convince others of the existence of the microchip.

(4) Reduce you to zombie status. By constantly hurling laser rays into your brain, destroying brain cells, they hope to turn you gradually into a mindless individual who from outward appearances suffers from Alzheimer’s disease or dementia.

(5) Make life physically and mentally miserable for you. The electronic torture and mind control techniques cause you physical pain, mental anguish, and deprive you of sleep, rendering you ineffective in your work and daily life.

(6) Often harassers seek to cause bodily harm and even death by causing vehicular and other accidents due to sleep deprivation. Through the use of the computer program that operates off the microchip, they can also cause heart attacks, gastric problems, and other ailments that might hospitalize you or kill you.

I wish to plant several ideas. A need urgently exists
(1) To create an awareness among the American public that what I have described above is real and that it could happen to anyone.

(2) To impose upon manufacturers of microchips the responsibility to control closely the sale and distribution of microchips.

(3) To start a repository of data on microchip implants and their use in electronic torture and mind control, including the personal experiences of victims and methods that might neutralize those devices.

(4) To establish a support group for victims of microchip implants.

(5) To pass national and international laws governing the use of microchip implants in humans and imposing heavy penalties, including capital punishment, for their misuse.

(6) To persuade psychiatrists and other medical personnel to accept that some patients exhibiting symptoms of schizophrenia, paranoia, Alzheimer’s, or dementia may instead be victims of involuntary microchip implants.

Besides being sneaks and cowards, tormentorss who carry out electronic torture and mind control using microchip implants are also criminals, guilty of

(1) stalking, (2) harassing with malicious intent,

(3) coercion (in attempting to make the victim do things that he/she does not want to do with their mind control methods),

(4) psychological and virtual rape,

(5) breaking and entering (which they often do to intimidate the victims by unlocking locked doors, turning back clocks, moving items in rooms, hiding other items, etc.),

(6) burglary and theft (which they commit when they enter a victim’s home and take items to confuse and disorient the victim),

(7) recording a victim’s conversations without his/her consent,

(8) peeping tom-ism (through their ability to view the victim),

(9) assault and battery (by using electric shock, etc. against the victims),

(10) slander (by circulating false rumors and stories that lack proof about the victim),

(11) libel (when those rumors and stories are put into print in the from of emails, etc),

(12) computer hacking and phone tapping, (13) first degree murder (when a victim suffers a fatal car crash because of sleep deprivation), and

(14) attempted murder (when their plans do not succeed), and, of course,

(13) terrorism.

I am not easily intimidated. I fight back. I intend to overcome and beat the electronic torture and mind control attempts. My aims are simple and direct:

(1) To continue to live a normal life. The perverted terrorists deprive their victims of sleep to cause them to have vehicular and other accidents, make them irritable to other people, and render them ineffective in their work. They want victims to react to their torture and mind control actions so that victims appear schizophrenic or paranoid. In short, they seek to make life miserable for the victims.

(2) To learn increasingly more about microchip implants and the computer programs that allow users to victimize the microchip carriers. I already know some large international manufacturers of microchips. I intend to study those companies and attempt to establish dialogues with technicians in those companies to find out more about the computer programs that govern microchips.

There must be some conscientious employees in those companies who will put victims above terrorists.

(3) To expose the perpetrators of the electronic torture and mind control. There have to be ways to trace the harassment back to its origin. I shall find those ways. I want to neutralize the perverted demons who are trying to destroy my life and those of many other victims.

(4) To continue to inform the public about the possibility and danger of microchip implants in humans.

I hope that other victims of involuntary microchip implants will see this article and will join the battle against the cowardly perverts who seek to ruin our lives. If in summarizing my saga of electronic torture and mind control through implanted microchips I have left out salient information, feel free to ask me to clarify points. I invite you to share with me your experiences and thoughts on the topic.
