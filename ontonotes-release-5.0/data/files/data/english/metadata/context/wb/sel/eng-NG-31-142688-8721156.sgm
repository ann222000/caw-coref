The Ugly Side of the G.O.P.

By BOB HERBERT

I applaud the thousands of people, many of them poor, who traveled
from around the country to protest in Jena, La., last week.

But what I’d really like to see is a million angry protesters marching
on the headquarters of the National Republican Party in Washington.

Enough is enough.

Last week the Republicans showed once again just how anti-black their
party really is.

The G.O.P. has spent the last 40 years insulting, disenfranchising and
otherwise stomping on the interests of black Americans.

Last week, the residents of Washington, D.C., with its majority black
population, came remarkably close to realizing a goal they have sought
for decades — a voting member of Congress to represent them.

A majority in Congress favored the move, and the House had already
approved it.

But the Republican minority in the Senate — with the enthusiastic
support of President Bush — rose up on Tuesday and said:

“No way, baby.”

At least 57 senators favored the bill, a solid majority. But the
Republicans prevented a key motion on the measure from receiving the
60 votes necessary to move it forward in the Senate.

The bill died.

At the same time that the Republicans were killing Congressional
representation for D.C. residents, the major G.O.P. candidates for
president were offering a collective slap in the face to black voters
nationally by refusing to participate in a long-scheduled, nationally
televised debate focusing on issues important to minorities.

The radio and television personality Tavis Smiley worked for a year to
have a pair of these debates televised on PBS, one for the Democratic
candidates and the other for the Republicans.

The Democratic debate was held in June, and all the major candidates
participated.

The Republican debate is scheduled for Thursday.

But Rudy Giuliani, John McCain, Mitt Romney and Fred Thompson have all
told Mr. Smiley: “No way, baby.”

They won’t be there.

They can’t be bothered debating issues that might be of interest to
black Americans.

After all, they’re Republicans.

This is the party of the Southern strategy — the party that ran, like
panting dogs, after the votes of segregationist whites who were
repelled by the very idea of giving equal treatment to blacks.

Ronald Reagan, George H.W. (Willie Horton) Bush, George W.
(Compassionate Conservative) Bush — they all ran with that lousy pack.

Dr. Carolyn Goodman, a woman I was privileged to call a friend, died
last month at the age of 91.

She was the mother of Andrew Goodman, one of the three young civil
rights activists shot to death by rabid racists near Philadelphia,
Miss., in 1964.

Dr. Goodman, one of the most decent people I have ever known, carried
the ache of that loss with her every day of her life.

In one of the vilest moves in modern presidential politics, Ronald
Reagan, the ultimate hero of this latter-day Republican Party, went
out of his way to kick off his general election campaign in 1980 in
that very same Philadelphia, Miss.

He was not there to send the message that he stood solidly for the
values of Andrew Goodman.

He was there to assure the bigots that he was with them.

“I believe in states’ rights,” said Mr. Reagan.

The crowd roared.

In 1981, during the first year of Mr. Reagan’s presidency, the late
Lee Atwater gave an interview to a political science professor at Case
Western Reserve University, explaining the evolution of the Southern
strategy:

“You start out in 1954 by saying, ‘Nigger, nigger, nigger,’ ” said
Atwater.

“By 1968, you can’t say ‘nigger’ — that hurts you. Backfires. So you
say stuff like forced busing, states’ rights, and all that stuff.
You’re getting so abstract now [that] you’re talking about cutting
taxes, and all these things you’re talking about are totally economic
things, and a byproduct of them is [that] blacks get hurt worse than
whites.”

In 1991, the first President Bush poked a finger in the eye of black
America by selecting the egregious Clarence Thomas for the seat on the
Supreme Court that had been held by the revered Thurgood Marshall.

The fact that there is a rigid quota on the court, permitting one
black and one black only to serve at a time, is itself racist.

Mr. Bush seemed to be saying, “All right, you want your black on the
court? Boy, have I got one for you.”

Republicans improperly threw black voters off the rolls in Florida in
the contested presidential election of 2000, and sent Florida state
troopers into the homes of black voters to intimidate them in 2004.

Blacks have been remarkably quiet about this sustained mistreatment by
the Republican Party, which says a great deal about the quality of
black leadership in the U.S. It’s time for that passive, masochistic
posture to end.

voters with criminal records are not allowed to vote -- in 2000, many
showed up
to vote and was told they had criminal records, many went home w/o
complaining, few did and found out that they ** will be convicted **
in 2009
or for some unknown charges in the past. there are no paper trails,
since they
are dumped soon after elections to make verification impossible.

Ohio precincts with large population of Dem in 2004 were under-
equipped with
voting machines, the line were very long, took hours to be in. someone
walked
around waiting line and announced election  would  be extended for
another
day because of long line.

GOP played to win, steal when possible regardless of methods. Bush
was not elected president, not even one.

these are not reported by mass media, CNN, Time, why?

I see frequently slogans in school .... &quot;work hard,&quot; &quot;be kind,&quot;
&quot;integrity&quot; and if
these are more than a talk, things that parents and board of education
want the
children to be for the future of US, most or many of politicians
should go back to kindergartens.

Let's see.

The Republicans fought the Southern Democrats in the Civil War when
Republican Lincoln freed the slaves.

The 14th Amendment, the Equal Protection Clause, was passed by Republicans,
with Democrats voting against it.

President Eisenhower, a Republican, proposed to Congress the Civil Rights
Acts of 1957 and 1960 and signed those acts into law

The 1964 Civil Rights Act, based on an earlier Republican law that did not
pass, and after being blocked by Democrats, was finally passed with more
Republicans voting for it than Democrats.

Who sent troops to Little Rock, Arkansas, to enforce school desegregation?
President Eisenhower, Republican.

First black Secretary of State:  Colin Powell, Republican
First black National Security Adviser:  Condy Rice, Republican

Only surviving Ku Klux Klan member still in Congress?  Robert Byrd,
Democrat.

You decide.

&gt;&gt; Dr. Carolyn Goodman, a woman I was privileged to call a friend, died

&gt;&gt; She was the mother of Andrew Goodman, one of the three young civil

&gt;&gt; Miss., in 1964.

&gt;&gt; Dr. Goodman, one of the most decent people I have ever known, carried

&gt;&gt; In one of the vilest moves in modern presidential politics, Ronald

&gt;&gt; say stuff like forced busing, states' rights, and all that stuff.
&gt;&gt; You're getting so abstract now [that] you're talking about cutting
&gt;&gt; taxes, and all these things you're talking about are totally economic
&gt;&gt; things, and a byproduct of them is [that] blacks get hurt worse than
&gt;&gt; whites.&quot;

&gt;&gt; Republicans improperly threw black voters off the rolls in Florida in

&gt; &gt; The Ugly Side of the G.O.P.

&gt; &gt; By BOB HERBERT

&gt; &gt; I applaud the thousands of people, many of them poor, who traveled
&gt; &gt; from around the country to protest in Jena, La., last week.

&gt; &gt; But what I'd really like to see is a million angry protesters marching
&gt; &gt; on the headquarters of the National Republican Party in Washington.

&gt; &gt; Enough is enough.

&gt; &gt; Last week the Republicans showed once again just how anti-black their
&gt; &gt; party really is.

&gt; &gt; The G.O.P. has spent the last 40 years insulting, disenfranchising and
&gt; &gt; otherwise stomping on the interests of black Americans.

&gt; &gt; Last week, the residents of Washington, D.C., with its majority black
&gt; &gt; population, came remarkably close to realizing a goal they have sought
&gt; &gt; for decades - a voting member of Congress to represent them.

&gt; &gt; A majority in Congress favored the move, and the House had already
&gt; &gt; approved it.

&gt; &gt; But the Republican minority in the Senate - with the enthusiastic
&gt; &gt; support of President Bush - rose up on Tuesday and said:

&gt; &gt; &quot;No way, baby.&quot;

&gt; &gt; At least 57 senators favored the bill, a solid majority. But the
&gt; &gt; Republicans prevented a key motion on the measure from receiving the
&gt; &gt; 60 votes necessary to move it forward in the Senate.

&gt; &gt; The bill died.

&gt; &gt; At the same time that the Republicans were killing Congressional
&gt; &gt; representation for D.C. residents, the major G.O.P. candidates for
&gt; &gt; president were offering a collective slap in the face to black voters
&gt; &gt; nationally by refusing to participate in a long-scheduled, nationally
&gt; &gt; televised debate focusing on issues important to minorities.

&gt; &gt; The radio and television personality Tavis Smiley worked for a year to
&gt; &gt; have a pair of these debates televised on PBS, one for the Democratic
&gt; &gt; candidates and the other for the Republicans.

&gt; &gt; The Democratic debate was held in June, and all the major candidates
&gt; &gt; participated.

&gt; &gt; The Republican debate is scheduled for Thursday.

&gt; &gt; But Rudy Giuliani, John McCain, Mitt Romney and Fred Thompson have all
&gt; &gt; told Mr. Smiley: &quot;No way, baby.&quot;

&gt; &gt; They won't be there.

&gt; &gt; They can't be bothered debating issues that might be of interest to
&gt; &gt; black Americans.

&gt; &gt; After all, they're Republicans.

&gt; &gt; This is the party of the Southern strategy - the party that ran, like
&gt; &gt; panting dogs, after the votes of segregationist whites who were
&gt; &gt; repelled by the very idea of giving equal treatment to blacks.

&gt; &gt; Ronald Reagan, George H.W. (Willie Horton) Bush, George W.
&gt; &gt; (Compassionate Conservative) Bush - they all ran with that lousy pack.

Have, I know about the Southern Strategy too.  Yep, when we dems
kicked all the segregationists out along with the Mississippi
Democratic Party Nixon was ready and waiting.  He got the ball rolling
by using his sense of amorality, then along came Reagan, the Good
Conservative who kept the welcome mat firmly in place.  The two
Bushies never touched that mat, if anything King George had it touched
up.

Why do you guys lie all the time?

&gt; &gt; This is the party of the Southern strategy - the party that ran, like

&gt; &gt; repelled by the very idea of giving equal treatment to blacks.

&gt; &gt; Ronald Reagan, George H.W. (Willie Horton) Bush, George W.
&gt; &gt; (Compassionate Conservative) Bush - they all ran with that lousy pack.

&gt; &gt; Dr. Carolyn Goodman, a woman I was privileged to call a friend, died
&gt; &gt; last month at the age of 91.

&gt; &gt; She was the mother of Andrew Goodman, one of the three young civil
&gt; &gt; rights activists shot to death by rabid racists near Philadelphia,
&gt; &gt; Miss., in 1964.

&gt; &gt; Dr. Goodman, one of the most decent people I have ever known, carried
&gt; &gt; the ache of that loss with her every day of her life.

&gt; &gt; In one of the vilest moves in modern presidential politics, Ronald
&gt; &gt; Reagan, the ultimate hero of this latter-day Republican Party, went
&gt; &gt; out of his way to kick off his general election campaign in 1980 in
&gt; &gt; that very same Philadelphia, Miss.

&gt; &gt; He was not there to send the message that he stood solidly for the
&gt; &gt; values of Andrew Goodman.

&gt; &gt; He was there to assure the bigots that he was with them.

&gt; &gt; &quot;I believe in states' rights,&quot; said Mr. Reagan.

&gt; &gt; The crowd roared.

&gt; &gt; &quot;By 1968, you can't say 'nigger' - that hurts you. Backfires. So you
&gt; &gt; say stuff like forced busing, states' rights, and all that stuff.
&gt; &gt; You're getting so abstract now [that] you're talking about cutting
&gt; &gt; taxes, and all these things you're talking about are totally economic
&gt; &gt; things, and a byproduct of them is [that] blacks get hurt worse than
&gt; &gt; whites.&quot;

&gt; &gt; In 1991, the first President Bush poked a finger in the eye of black
&gt; &gt; America by selecting the egregious Clarence Thomas for the seat on the
&gt; &gt; Supreme Court that had been held by the revered Thurgood Marshall.

&gt; &gt; The fact that there is a rigid quota on the court, permitting one
&gt; &gt; black and one black only to serve at a time, is itself racist.

&gt; &gt; Mr. Bush seemed to be saying, &quot;All right, you want your black on the
&gt; &gt; court? Boy, have I got one for you.&quot;

&gt; &gt; Republicans improperly threw black voters off the rolls in Florida in
