I went to the Taste of Chicago and saw Robert Randolph and John
Mayer.  Wasnt too bad, actually.  Mayer pretended to &quot;jam&quot; bc,
according to him, Chicago makes you want to jam.  But it seemed to me
to be a totally orchestrated little segment, but it was still, for
what it is, ok.  And he brought out buddy guy for the Gravity encore,
so that was great.  Other than that, I am a big, Irish burnt tomato.
Ouchy.  What did you guys do? Anything cool?

Jazz fest was in Iowa City for free last weekend,   saw stanton moore,
then don byron doing
the music of Junior walker on Saturday and on Sunday,
local favorites public property and later,  the derek trucks band

so for the third, I went out on a boat and sat under the fireworks,
highly recommended for anyone who really likes fireworks.

the 4th, rode a bicycle most of the day,  stopped at a few bars,
downtown had food vendors,  falafel and chocolate covered strawberries.
went home to downtown apartment and pulled the couch up to the 5th floor
window and watched the fireworks comfortably with friends.
