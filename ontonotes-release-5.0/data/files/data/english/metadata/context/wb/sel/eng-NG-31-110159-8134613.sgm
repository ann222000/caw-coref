Here's a type of cider I've never seen before - A Canadian ice cider.

Canadians make a lot of  eiswein(and lots of other really good wines
that I've never seen over here, but that's another, and sadly OT
story). They make them at both ends of the country, and over there
they're justifiably rather proud of them.

Yesterday I was flying home from Montreal and in the duty free I saw a
product described as an ice cider. In a tall thin bottle similar to
the ice wines, it's made in Quebec and it cost about 25 dollars
Canadian for a bottle. Sadly I didn't buy any, I'd carefuly used up
nearly all my Canadian cash to avoid bringing too much home with me.
My first reaction was a cynical one born of the cider market in the
UK, that it might be something rather synthetic designed for a
marketing push into the ice wine space. &quot;Lambrini&quot; sprang to mind. But
reading the blurb it seems it's what it says - a proper cider, or more
accurately a 12% abv apple wine, made from apples that have caught the
Quebec winter. I was forgetting, cider is a specialist minority drink
over there, not mainstream at all.
As a product it interests me, from where I'm sitting if an apple
gets frosted it goes off and wouldn't be of much use for cider, but I
guess the key is &quot;Frozen and thawed&quot; in an English late autumnal light
frost, rather than &quot;frozen for good&quot; as it would be over there at an
earlier onset of winter.
I'll try to secure a bottle, either next time I'm in Canada or
through one of my in-laws, but meanwhile I'm curious, have any of you
come across anything like this?
There are plenty of other Canadian ciders. I have sampled some
enjoyable ones on my visits to BC, though they're a bit different in
style to those we're used to. Sadly I've seen Strongbow presented as
an authentic British cider experience in pubs over there. (Which I
guess it is if you're strictly accurate, but you know what I mean.)

This was one of the new products I reported in October last year,
having come across it at the Slow Food Festival in Turin.
Both Sue and I liked it. I have a sweeter tooth then Sue - I loved it.

It's magnificent. One of the many (many) benefits of living on this
side of the pond. :)

On a semi related note, Canadian Affair has just announced 200 pound
flights (return) from Gatwick to Fredericton.

Damn, I vaguely remember your report but had forgotten this cider. I
wish I'd managed to get a bottle now.

I was mostly curious about the process. If it's like an ice wine I'm
guessing the idea is that some of the water freezes leaving a
concentrated juice with more sugar in it. Press the frozen fruit and
the ice stays in the pulp.

My experience of pressing both is that grapes are a lot easier to
press than apples because they don't have all that tough pulp. I'm
guessing that to make pressable pulp from frozen apples they have to
pulverise them more than the &quot;little cubes&quot; we press at room
temperature. But then how do they stop it melting from the pressure
applied to it in the press and diluting their hard won high sugar
juice? I suppose the rather low temperatures of the Quebec winter are
on their side there.

And once they've got the juice, how do they control the fermentation
to preserve the sweetness? Keeving? Or does the freezing process lock
up some of the nutrients in the ice resulting in a &quot;ready keeved&quot;
juice?

Just my enquiring mind. I guess the only way to find out is to make my
way to southern Quebec and take their tour. Shame it's such a big
country, they're probably closer to me here in the UK than where I'm
likely to be next time I'm in Canada.

The process is somewhat similar to that used to make ice wine. It
starts with a late-season apple, picked after the first frost. The
apples are pressed into juice and the apple liquor is separated and
allowed to ferment for eight months. It takes about 80 apples to make
one 375-ml bottle of  Ice Cider.

Hi

I was on a cider course run by Peter Mitchel in the spring and there were
two people on the course from Canada who kindly brought along some ice cider
for us to try. It was certainly different, a sipping drink almost like a
sherry. There was also an article about it in the Saturday Financial Times
in March,  the link is here though the pictures in the paper do not seem to
appear

&gt; Here's a type of cider I've never seen before - A Canadian ice cider.

&gt; Canadians make a lot of  eiswein(and lots of other really good wines
&gt; that I've never seen over here, but that's another, and sadly OT
&gt; story). They make them at both ends of the country, and over there
&gt; they're justifiably rather proud of them.

&gt; Yesterday I was flying home from Montreal and in the duty free I saw a
&gt; product described as an ice cider. In a tall thin bottle similar to
&gt; the ice wines, it's made in Quebec and it cost about 25 dollars
&gt; Canadian for a bottle. Sadly I didn't buy any, I'd carefuly used up
&gt; nearly all my Canadian cash to avoid bringing too much home with me.
&gt;    My first reaction was a cynical one born of the cider market in the
&gt; UK, that it might be something rather synthetic designed for a
&gt; marketing push into the ice wine space. &quot;Lambrini&quot; sprang to mind. But
&gt; reading the blurb it seems it's what it says - a proper cider, or more
&gt; accurately a 12% abv apple wine, made from apples that have caught the
&gt; Quebec winter. I was forgetting, cider is a specialist minority drink
&gt; over there, not mainstream at all.
&gt;    As a product it interests me, from where I'm sitting if an apple
&gt; gets frosted it goes off and wouldn't be of much use for cider, but I
&gt; guess the key is &quot;Frozen and thawed&quot; in an English late autumnal light
&gt; frost, rather than &quot;frozen for good&quot; as it would be over there at an
&gt; earlier onset of winter.
&gt;    I'll try to secure a bottle, either next time I'm in Canada or
&gt; through one of my in-laws, but meanwhile I'm curious, have any of you
&gt; come across anything like this?
&gt;     There are plenty of other Canadian ciders. I have sampled some
&gt; enjoyable ones on my visits to BC, though they're a bit different in
&gt; style to those we're used to. Sadly I've seen Strongbow presented as
&gt; an authentic British cider experience in pubs over there. (Which I
&gt; guess it is if you're strictly accurate, but you know what I mean.)
