National Monument, which protects, preserves and interprets one of the
largest concentrations of petroglyphs in the world, the University of
New Mexico and the Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia

SAFE HARBOR PETROGLYPHS:
Friends of the Safe Harbor Petroglyphs was formed to work to preserve,
protect, and raise awareness of the Safe Harbor Petroglyphs. The group
is directed by the Susquehanna Kalpulli, a local group interested in
the Native American culture, and the Conejohela Chapter of the Society
for Pennsylvania Archaeology. The Conejohela Chapter has established a
fund to help accomplish the group's goals. Currently we are looking
for 'Caretakers' to help monitor visitor activity at the petroglyph
sites. If you have a small motor boat, kayak, or canoe and would be
interested in visiting the rocks one or more times during the summer
months to check for vandalism and/or assist visitors. We are also
looking for help to map the river bottom in the area around the rocks.
For this we need the help of someone having a boat equipped with a
depth finder, bottom reading fish finder or similar equipment. Other
current projects include installing small identifying plaques on the
rocks, continuing research, and developing interpretive materials.

If you can help with any of these projects call Paul Nevin at
717.252.4177 or Michael V. Nixon, J.D. at 412.221.6261 or e-mail
michaelvni ... @yahoo.com .

IMAGES OF THE ICE AGE TOUR
Northern Spain and Southern France
June 19 - July 1, 2008

Africa Antiqua wishes to announce an adventure of a lifetime.  You
will be transported back into a time when most of Europe was covered
in ice and our ancestors hunted now extinct animals, such as woolly
rhinoceros, mammoth, wolves, enormous cave bears and giant bison. Not
only were these large mammals hunted but images representing their
early religious and ritual significance have painstakingly been
produced by un-named master artists in a series of deep caves and
caverns. This expedition will give you the opportunity to explore
these globally significant rock art sites, some of which date back a
staggering 35 000 years, together with world-renowned Ice Age rock art
expert and author, Dr Paul Bahn, who will be our expedition leader. On
this tour just about every site, every visit, is a high-point, but for
avid rock-art enthusiasts you will be thrilled by our visits to world-
renowned Palaeolithic caves such as that at Altamira, Cognac, and
Lascaux II, and a visit to the early pre-Neanderthal site of the
Sierra de los Huesos, where archaic man lived, hunted and died,
leaving behind their remains to tell us a little something about life
in Spain some 800 000 years ago.
