AGH!  I am so fustrated!  I had an independant jaguar shop replace and
rebuild my differential on my 91 XJ40.  5000 miles and $2400 later it goes
bad.  Had him look at it says all he could do was knock off 3 hours of
labor.., a whopping $240!  Then had the audacity to request $20 for the
Castrol Oil he put back in my differential which i didnt ask to be drained
in the first place after he already diagnosed it was a bad bearing!  I
refused to pay for the $20 worth of oil, i've spent well over $6000 at his
shop and he cant give me a measily 1.5-2 quarts of fluid!?  Then the decent
english man that he is, mummbled "Mr. Fancy Pants" under his breath.  You
have got to be kidding me!!

I thought this was one shop i could trust.

Does anyone know of any good places to pickup a rebuilt differential so i
dont have to go through this ridiculous mess again?

Thanks!

BTW, the shop was Mr. Jags run by Steve in Redmond, WA.  So here's to help
you make an informed decision.

As previously posted, the rear differential wines.  "Mr. Jags" rebuilt the
original one and after 5000 miles a bearing has come apart.  This cost me
1200 in labor for the rebuild and 800 in parts.

Before you come to conclusions and start making accusations against me, read
and understand the posts first.  I did read your post and actually i did
mention there was a bearing failure in my original message, which is why i
didnt respond to your question.

Listen,

You have to understand how many people post false defaming things about
others on the internet. Let me clarify that I am not jumping to any
conclusion as I am only investigating. I am not here to lambaste you,
but in fact help you. Again.. I look at your original post and there is
no mention of a bearing failure.

That said...can we begin again?

What you paid is way too much and sadly, this is what us poor Jaguar
owners often pay..too much. What I can say to you is if the shop dies
not honor its work and it has been under 90 days, paid with a VISA,
then call VISA and contest the bill. Many banks offer double warranties
and protect against potential vermin. Otherwise its off to court.

I know of several complete used rear ends if you still need one.

Unfortunatly its been almost 3 years since it was done.  It started going
out about 5000 miles.  Ive put on almost another 5000 miles.  Yep i know,
time works against me here.  So much has been going on that this hadnt been
a priority.  I would love to take him to court, his policy is 30-days parts
90-days labor.  So just by that alone do i even have a defense?

His only offer was to take two hours off labor.  He is making a healthy
profit on parts as well and yes i am still looking for a differential,
either new or rebuilt.  I dont think i would trust a used one, they dont
last that long and there was problems with early XJ40 differentials.

Thanks!

No time has passed by the opportunity by now, so forgive and forget.

The XJ40 did have some problems early on, but that was due to a
combination of poor assembly and bearing vendors. There are many early
examples with 200k+ miles using the original differential, albeit
Changing out the output bearings. And it is these output bearings that
are the cause of so many misdiagnosed rear end failures; many mechanics
new of this and raped poor Jag owners dry.

So what I am saying here is - if you are hearing rear end noise and the
pitch of the noise does not change when you take your foot of the
throttle then you most likely have an output bearing growling. It can
be changed without removing the diff. sub-assembly from the car. Pottsy
was going to do this task...I wonder how it turned out for him? Anyway
these output bearings are common and can be found at a bearing
supplier.

I am not afraid of used parts especially if you automatically replace
the lube and output bearings before setting it into your car. I do have
a source in teaxas that sells rebuilt units too.

If I recall you are in the Seattle area; I am in the Portland area.

Cheers,
Blake

Often times, I disagree with Blake, but this time he is correct.
I have an XJ40 and at 154,000 miles (3 years ago) I had to replace the rear
differential bearings. Total cost $160 and 3 hours labor.  This included
bearings, crush collars, oil seals and O-Rings.  I now have 210,000 miles on
the car and it is still going strong.
The design of the output bearings on these differentials was appalling.
They went from a double bearing using taper bearings in the XJ6 Series to a
HUGE single bearing using ball bearings in the XJ40.  It was not their best
design since the cage holding the ball bearings usually could not withstand
the side to side movement.
It is rare that a pinion gear or other major component in the
differential will go out as compared to the output bearings. Output bearings
will usually start to show major wear after 50,000 miles.

Like Blake, I would not be afraid of a used differential.  In fact, in
your particular case, I would probably welcome a swap.  There is NO way of
knowing what other damage was done to your differential by the mechanic.

I say it over and over and over again that a Jaguar owner's best defense and
best tool when it comes to these cars is to be educated about them.  A $15
Haynes manual will same you thousands of dollars in the long run because you
know what is going on with the car -- even if you do not do the work
yourself.  Getting on this mail server is a step in the right direction.
Join other lists like jag-lovers.org and read the manual of repairs written
buy XJ40 owners like yourself who have been through the same experiences.

Continually I am being told that my 1988 XJ40 was the worst Jaguar ever
built. Yet I have 210,000 miles on the original engine and drive train and I
have no warning lights on the dash.  The car gets 27 MPG on the highway and
still performs like a champ and rides like the luxury car it is.  As long as
I have watched the little niggles that are common to this car it has never
let me down.  That is more than I can say for my 1997 Dodge truck which has
cost a small fortune in repairs and doesn't even have 100,000 miles on the
clock yet!!!

Stick with the car, educate yourself and you will have years of great
performance going forward  from your XJ40.

Don't mean to hijack this thread, but I'd like to know the secrets to
your success... I've been chasing 2 problems for years on my 89 XJ40
that are driving me nuts, and haven't found answers by posting here or
elsewhere.

1. Bulb failure message: comes on sometimes with stop lights and
frequently if turn signal is also on (accompanied by double-speed turn
signal noise, and sometimes the left turn signal bulbs cease blinking
when this happens, sometimes they continue blinking normally); it can
occur spontaneoulsly (but seldom) like when just cruising on the freeway
with no lights turned on. Have replaced all rear bulbs, cleaned sockets,
swapped rear bulb failure modules, resoldered all joints in both rear
bulb failure modules, and replaced one module. Nothing helped.

2. Door locks: I never had a remote so we are talking manual by key or
the plunger. They used to work fine. Now unlocking either front door
unlocks the rear doors. Locking either front door locks the rear doors.
Neither front door lock affects the other front door lock. The dash lock
button does nothing except elicit a faint clicking noise. All doors lock
when the ignition is turned on and unlock when the ignition key is
turned off (almost always... but the passenger door doesn't always
unlock). Result is I have to walk around the car to lock the passenger
door nearly every time I park (or stretch way across and push the
plunger), or to let a passenger into the car. Most components are
expensive and difficult to replace, and I have no idea how to determine
which are the bad part(s). I've had both front doors apart several
times, to no avail (nothing obvious found amiss). I've replaced both
front door handles (for mechanical failure reasons, and replacement did
not affect this problem). The fact that the dash button doesn't unlock
any of the doors is probably a big clue (ie, does it control one door's
locking motor which in turn affects the others? is it a problem in the
central door lock control box under the dash?) but I can't follow Jag's
electrical diagrams well enough to figure it out and don't want to tear
both front doors apart and replace 2 motors at $160 or so each just to
see if they are the problem..

Wow, you have done nearly every thing on the BFM unit.  Here is what I
suggest.  Take the Left BFM out again and pull the top circuit board off the
lower board.  Steal one of your wife's nail file emery boards and sand all
the prong contacts  as well as the plug sockets so they all have decent
electrical contact.  This is a LIGHT procedure -- do not over do it.  Also
GENTLY spread the prongs out a bit to make sure there is contact.  With the
intermittent problem you describe, I believe it is a contact problem for the
circuit obviously works -- just not all the time.
As for the door locks.  This is an obvious electrical problem as well.
Fortunately, one I have not had to deal with.  You problem is not with the
actuator for if you turn the correct key -- it locks or unlocks.  So all the
actuators are working.  It seems there is an electrical disconnect between
the front door locks and the button.  Does the button close the sun roof.
If you get out of the car and hold the key in the lock position in the
driver's door do all the doors lock, the windows go up and the sun roof
close?  Doing that should determine where the problem lies.

It is odd that your doors all lock and unlock with the ignition -- mine
don't.

BTW, didn't you move to Ca from Va and sell your XJS or is that a different
WayneC??

&gt; 2. Door locks: I never had a remote so we are talking manual by key or
&gt; the plunger. They used to work fine. Now unlocking either front door
&gt; unlocks the rear doors. Locking either front door locks the rear doors.
&gt; Neither front door lock affects the other front door lock. The dash lock
&gt; button does nothing except elicit a faint clicking noise. All doors lock
&gt; when the ignition is turned on and unlock when the ignition key is
&gt; turned off (almost always... but the passenger door doesn't always
&gt; unlock). Result is I have to walk around the car to lock the passenger
&gt; door nearly every time I park (or stretch way across and push the
&gt; plunger), or to let a passenger into the car. Most components are
&gt; expensive and difficult to replace, and I have no idea how to determine
&gt; which are the bad part(s). I've had both front doors apart several
&gt; times, to no avail (nothing obvious found amiss). I've replaced both
&gt; front door handles (for mechanical failure reasons, and replacement did
&gt; not affect this problem). The fact that the dash button doesn't unlock
&gt; any of the doors is probably a big clue (ie, does it control one door's
&gt; locking motor which in turn affects the others? is it a problem in the
&gt; central door lock control box under the dash?) but I can't follow Jag's
&gt; electrical diagrams well enough to figure it out and don't want to tear
&gt; both front doors apart and replace 2 motors at $160 or so each just to
&gt; see if they are the problem..

I've done the sockets.

I'm not sure which "prongs" you are referring to... in the BFM?
I have a low confidence level since I've already swapped AND replaced
that BFM (with another used one). And in fact I bought a second used BFM
that I haven't tried yet.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Yeah, but no one knows how to troubleshoot the system.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Yep, I knew that (assuming you mean the mechanical plunger or the switch

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; for if you turn the correct key -- it locks or unlocks.  So all the

">

Depends on what you mean by an actuator.. if you mean the switch, yes.

But, neither front door ever locks without using the key or the manual
plunger on that same door... turning the key does in fact mechanically
move the lock plunger on that door. It does not electrically actuate the
other front door lock. That goes for both front doors, and for unlocking.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; It seems there is an electrical disconnect between
&gt; the front door locks and the button.  Does the button close the sun roof.
">

I'll have to try that... I believe it used to, though I rarely used that
button; I do recall that it used to lock the doors. The sunroof is
another (newer) issue, as I need a new headliner... if I open the
sunroof it hits the hanging material, thus I stopped opening it. I'll
fix the roofliner as soon as I decide if I'm going to keep this car
(I've owned it 5 or 6 years, always had the BF messages and mostly
ignored it, the lock problems are maybe a year old now; my patience is
wearing thin with those problems)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; If you get out of the car and hold the key in the lock position in the

All BUT the passenger front door lock. In fact, after the last time I
fooled around with the driver door handle, it works TOO good, making it
just about impossible to leave my windows cracked about half an inch,
which I like to do (gets hot around here). By the time I can turn the
key quickly, the mindows are shut.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; It is odd that your doors all lock and unlock with the ignition -- mine
&gt; don't.
">

I'll have to doublecheck that, I thought they did, perhaps not. I know
the passenger door often seems to get unlocked (when I haven't any
passengers) because I keep having to walk around or reach over to lock
it (the unlocking may happen when the driver door is opened). I think
the trunk lid gets locked, too, when the ignition is turned on, but I
won't swear to that.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

">

I know all the locks are tied together electrically, I just don't know
the routing... I suspect the dash rocker switch button causes the
central lock controller under the dash to pass current to ONE of the
lock motors, either passenger or driver door, and the movement of that
lock then causes the other 3 to lock. The routing to the other 3 may be
through the central lock controller, or may not. So I'm thinking I might
have a problem in the central controller or in one or both of the front
door lock motors (on the locking side of the circuit), or a bad wire
contact somewhere. The question is which component is bad (since all are
expensive to replace), or where is the fault in the wiring.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; BTW, didn't you move to Ca from Va and sell your XJS or is that a different

Must be a different WayneC, I still have an XJS and I never lived in VA.
Bought both the XJ40 and XJS after moving here. The XJS is in slightly
better shape with about 85k miles vs 135k, but it, too, is starting to

Since your rear end is driving you into bankruptcy, try some creative
thinking and use the lock problem to your advantage- leave it unlocked and
hope someone steals the thing and your insurance company pays you enough to
buy another car.

&gt; 1. Bulb failure message: comes on sometimes with stop lights and

Hmmm... I'm also having frustrating BFM problems.  I have a continuous BF message
flashing in my XJ40 1988 display.  It seems that only the *front* modules have the
add on board that plugs into the other.  The rear ones are much simpler.  I too
have tried to clear this BF "fault" without success but I haven't yet tried the
nailfile trick, I must say.  I also have a *new* problem which has started since
fitting a replacement secondhand (right front) module to try and fix the BF
message (which it didn't)  Now if I blink right (or switch on hazards) the
blinking *sound* is more rapid intermittently but the actual blink is OK.  I'm
concerned that this and the BF message may mask a *real* problem when I'm on the
road, so would like to cure this.  I also have a dummy "low windscreen washer"
message I'd dearly like to clear, so that finally my fault display will be clear
until I get a *real* fault.  Of course, I'd like to do this all yesterday so I'm
ready for safe Cristmas trip (sigh).

The outer bearings you say?  When the fluid was released, there were metal
particles attached to the magnetic plug.  I assumed this would be caused
only by the inner bearings, but i dont know the schematics of the
differential.  Can this be caused by outter bearings as well?

It really gripes me that "Mr Jags" rebuilt the thing, not only are the
bearings being chewed up but the seal is bad as well.  This is causing the
differential to squirt fluid onto the mufflers producing a not so pleasant
smell.

Mr. Jags isnt a new mechanic.., hes an older english man that says hes been
working on jaguars since his early teens.

The pitch of the noise is constant.  I remember the first time it went bad
the pitches would differ depending on the speed of the vehicle.  But this
time it seems pretty constant

&gt; No time has passed by the opportunity by now, so forgive and forget.

&gt; The XJ40 did have some problems early on, but that was due to a
&gt; combination of poor assembly and bearing vendors. There are many early

&gt; Changing out the output bearings. And it is these output bearings that
&gt; are the cause of so many misdiagnosed rear end failures; many mechanics
&gt; new of this and raped poor Jag owners dry.

&gt; So what I am saying here is - if you are hearing rear end noise and the

&gt; these output bearings are common and can be found at a bearing

Wait a minute!  Something wrong here.  The earlier poster was asking about
change in noise whether the throttle was pressed or not - ie (presumably)
whether the drive train was under load or not.  This would give some indication
if it was the gears in the diff.  But what *you* are saying is the noise is
independent of the *speed*, which is an entirely different thing, surely.  If
I'm not mistaken no change in noise whatever the speed rules out the gears.  Do
the rest of you agree?

Ouch. Metal filings - everybody's fear when they take out any drain plug.
Years ago, when I took out the gearbox drain to my lovely wife's Triumph
Herald, out trickled (audibly)... needle bearings!  Memories, memories.  My
first car (Austin 7 Ruby had an engine about as small as the air compressor on
the Jag. And the oil pressure was 5 psi max).

So much confusion.  Mr. Jags diagnosed that the noise was the differential.
When the fluid drained particles came out.  So this means the inner bearings
are being chewed.  Unless there is something i am missing, then this is the
problem  And from what i understand the only way to fix this is to one,
rebuild it or two get a new one.  Either way it is going to be costly and/or
time consuming.

Hopefully this clears everything up.  My original post was a gripe about my
newly rebuilt diff going out after 5000 miles and asking if anyone knows
where i can find some good replacements.
