Tim disagrees that America did not influence The Beatles or their
actions, but...

Fact: America AKA The USA is responsible for 70% of the usage of illegal
drugs, in the entire world!

Beatles visit, and look decent. Some years pass and the look like bums!!!

Lennon was shot. Why? Outside buying a newspaper? No, something way more
expensive!!!

Harrison is dead! Gee, you don't think it had to do with anything he
swallow, smoked or shot, do you!?

Starr, I think he went to drug rehab!

Like I said, their late music and appearance was a result of drugs!!!

Uni a fashion expert????  Let's examine that closer...   Well, he tried
being a music expert and failed.  Then he tried being a CD expert and
failed (he was caught posting snippets of songs he had downloaded as
mp3s). Then he pretended a radio station made him an offer to play his
music collection (when he couldn't buy a radio station).  Then he
pretended he was going to get the rights to release Billy Harner's
collection (Billy Harner's laughing as he reads this)... Then Uni
pretended. . . Well, you get my drift. In other words, he's the
not-so-great Pretender, who planned to buy an FM station with money he
doesn't have (FM stations typically sell for million+ dollars) begging
someone, anyone (even White people) to host his web page. Yeah right.

Actually, the song title was &quot;If Not For You&quot;, of Bob's &quot;New Morning&quot;
which was then used as a communique from the Weathermen (who of course
took their title from a Bob Dylan lyric).

Of course, few have that album, and likely thing it's an Olivia Newton
John song.

EVERYBODY bought that album.

And George Harrison recorded that song on All Things Must Pass before

Discussing The Beatles with you, Uni, is like discussing God with an
atheist.

You are such a fucked up idiotic good for nothing son of a bitch.

George and John are dead?  Hey, people die and there is evil in the
world.

Go look in a mirror.

Stop complaining about drugs, or we'll ask your doctor not to
administer antibiotics the next time you have a major bacterial
infection.

Please stop being so stupid.

In the film &quot;The U.S. vs. John Lennon,&quot; there's a scene of his 1969
shouting match with a self-righteous New York Times reporter who misses
the lovable, mop-topped Beatles of five years before. Lennon tells her,
&quot;I've grown up; too bad you haven't.&quot;

Actually, he and Yoko were walking home from the recording studio, where

Certainly, illicit chemicals were a factor in the Beatles' later works,
but hardly the sole one. For example, Lennon cited the inspiration for
RUBBER SOUL as being Bob Dylan. And Harrison's fascination with Indian
mysticism was an obvious influence on the Beatles' late-period music,
given its frequent usage of the sitar.

Besides, what does it matter who or what inspired the group's later
sounds? As long as I enjoy that stuff, I'll keep listening to it, its
muse be damned.

Maybe, but that does not apply to Uni.  Who simply likes to stir shit, if
not with bogus reviews of cheap cd's then the lack of critical thinking and
musical taste (or lack thereof) in Uni's little brainpan.

Dean,

Short version:

They all took drugs! They admit to it. Their written songs were about
dugs - especially, &quot;Got To Get You Into My Life&quot; and &quot;Hey Jude&quot;! Their
Sergeant Pepper album was full of drug music!

Thank you!

Yeah. There's a great story about the time Epstien's briefaces was stolen in
the US in the early 60s. Police nabbed a suspect, and asked Epstein to
indentify the contents of the brieface. After shuffling through the papers
inside, he told them, 'Yes, it's mine, but I have no idea what that stuff in
the plastic bag is...'

&quot;THE BEATLES AND DRUGS. Testifying before the House Select Committee on
Crime, popular family entertainer Art Linkletter, who lost a child to
drug abuse, referred to the Beatles as the “leading missionaries of the
acid society” (Crime in America—Illicit and Dangerous Drugs, October
1969). Media researcher Brian Key observed: “The Beatles became the
super drug culture prophets … of all time” (Key, Media Sexploitation,
1976, p. 136). The student newspaper for the University of Wisconsin
noted that the Beatles have “proselytized the use of drugs so subtly
that words and conceptions once only common to drug users are found in
sentences of teeny-boppers and statesmen alike” (Daily Cardinal, Dec. 3,
1968, p. 5, cited by David Noebel, The Legacy of John Lennon, p. 63).

The Beatles began taking drugs during their earliest band days before
they became popular. They started by taking slimming pills to stay awake
during long performances. They were high on “prellies,” a form of speed
called Phenmetrazine and marketed as Preludin. John Lennon was so out of
control one night, that “when a customer over-enthusiastically
approached the stage, he kicked him in the head twice, then grabbed a
steak knife from a table and threw it at the man” (Waiting for the Man,
p. 107).&quot;

And you wonder why Lennon is dead! Drugs were a major factor in The
Beatles lives!

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The Beatles were doing controlled substances prior to

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;coming to the US.  It's been documented.  They weren't as clean cut as
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;you think.  That was just a Brian Epstein ploy to get them in the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;door.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Yeah. There's a great story about the time Epstien's briefaces was
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;stolen in the US in the early 60s. Police nabbed a suspect, and asked
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Epstein to indentify the contents of the brieface. After shuffling
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;through the papers inside, he told them, 'Yes, it's mine, but I have no
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;idea what that stuff in the plastic bag is...'

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Like I said, their late music and appearance was a result of drugs!!!

&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;THE BEATLES AND DRUGS. Testifying before the House Select Committee on
&gt;&gt;&gt;Crime, popular family entertainer Art Linkletter, who lost a child to
&gt;&gt;&gt;drug abuse, referred to the Beatles as the “leading missionaries of the
&gt;&gt;&gt;acid society” (Crime in America—Illicit and Dangerous Drugs, October
&gt;&gt;&gt;1969). Media researcher Brian Key observed: “The Beatles became the super
&gt;&gt;&gt;drug culture prophets … of all time” (Key, Media Sexploitation, 1976, p.
&gt;&gt;&gt;136). The student newspaper for the University of Wisconsin noted that
&gt;&gt;&gt;the Beatles have “proselytized the use of drugs so subtly that words and
&gt;&gt;&gt;conceptions once only common to drug users are found in sentences of
&gt;&gt;&gt;teeny-boppers and statesmen alike” (Daily Cardinal, Dec. 3, 1968, p. 5,
&gt;&gt;&gt;cited by David Noebel, The Legacy of John Lennon, p. 63).

&gt;&gt;&gt;The Beatles began taking drugs during their earliest band days before
&gt;&gt;&gt;they became popular. They started by taking slimming pills to stay awake
&gt;&gt;&gt;during long performances. They were high on “prellies,” a form of speed
&gt;&gt;&gt;called Phenmetrazine and marketed as Preludin. John Lennon was so out of
&gt;&gt;&gt;control one night, that “when a customer over-enthusiastically approached
&gt;&gt;&gt;the stage, he kicked him in the head twice, then grabbed a steak knife
&gt;&gt;&gt;from a table and threw it at the man” (Waiting for the Man, p. 107).&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;And you wonder why Lennon is dead!

&gt;&gt; Actually, I never had any doubts at all about why Lennon is dead. You do
&gt;&gt; know about the shooting?

&gt; No, I was sniffing glue that day! LOL! :-)

Right, Art was an expert on drug use.  And of course, Aldous Huxley,
Ken Kesey, TImothy Leary, Al Hubbard, the British government, the CIA
and the U. S. Army got the idea from the Beatles, no doubt.

The Nazi troopers liked that stuff too. Years before the Beatles
amphetamines were commonly used and abused by people as a weight-loss
aid. They were also used by anyone who had to work long hours in order
to stay awake and alert.  Very popular with truck drivers and
musicians who work all night in clubs.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Beatles visit, and look decent. Some years pass and the look like
&gt;&gt;&gt; bums!!!

&gt;&gt; In the film &quot;The U.S. vs. John Lennon,&quot; there's a scene of his 1969
&gt;&gt; shouting match with a self-righteous New York Times reporter who
&gt;&gt; misses the lovable, mop-topped Beatles of five years before. Lennon
&gt;&gt; tells her, &quot;I've grown up; too bad you haven't.&quot;

&gt;&gt; He could've been talking to Uni, too.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Lennon was shot. Why? Outside buying a newspaper? No, something way
&gt;&gt;&gt; more expensive!!!

&gt;&gt; Actually, he and Yoko were walking home from the recording studio,
&gt;&gt; where they had been working on the latter's upcoming single, &quot;Walking
&gt;&gt; On Thin Ice.&quot; That could be your theme song, Uni, regarding your
&gt;&gt; claims of musical expertise!

&gt;&gt;&gt; Harrison is dead! Gee, you don't think it had to do with anything he
&gt;&gt;&gt; swallow, smoked or shot, do you!?

&gt;&gt; I believe he died of cancer, probably brought on by decades of
&gt;&gt; cigarette smoking. But I'm guessing Harrison started smoking during
&gt;&gt; his formative years in Liverpool. You know, in England?

&gt;&gt;&gt; Starr, I think he went to drug rehab!

&gt;&gt; Never heard about that myself, but even if it's true, so what? Lots of
&gt;&gt; artists have been in alcohol and drug rehab. What, exactly, are you
&gt;&gt; implying?

&gt;&gt;&gt; Like I said, their late music and appearance was a result of drugs!!!

&gt;&gt; Certainly, illicit chemicals were a factor in the Beatles' later
&gt;&gt; works, but hardly the sole one.

&gt; Dean,

&gt; Short version:

&gt; They all took drugs! They admit to it. Their written songs were about
&gt; dugs - especially, &quot;Got To Get You Into My Life&quot; and &quot;Hey Jude&quot;! Their
&gt; Sergeant Pepper album was full of drug music!

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Beatles visit, and look decent. Some years pass and the look like

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Lennon was shot. Why? Outside buying a newspaper? No, something way
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;more
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;expensive!!!

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Harrison is dead! Gee, you don't think it had to do with anything he
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;swallow, smoked or shot, do you!?

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Starr, I think he went to drug rehab!

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Like I said, their late music and appearance was a result of drugs!!!

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Uni

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;You're all wet.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Marry the words &quot;drugs&quot; and &quot;Beatles&quot; in any internet search engine and
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;you'll be overwhelmed with &quot;hits&quot;!!!! And, no, before and AFTER their
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;trips&quot; to the US!! Paul finally kicked the habit in the '80's!!!!!

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;you sure?

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Yes, I have a link somewhere, but it's late.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I doubt I'll get anyone to agree with me, because they, too, like The
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Beatles, support(ed) drug use to survive!

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;so....

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;You're reasonably certain (seems so) that The Beatles are the only musicians
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;who ever did drugs??????

&gt; &gt;&gt;Heck no, Bill! Since The Beatles gained popularity from it, many US
&gt; &gt;&gt;groups and individuals followed in their footsteps! But, Bill, they were
&gt; &gt;&gt;young teens and young adults - nothing approaching maturity!

&gt; &gt; So I take it that all those blues and jazz musicians were high on the
&gt; &gt; real thing -- powerful gasoline, a clean windshield, and a shoeshine.

&gt; Are you in danger, Pastor?

I made my point about The Beatles. I have yet to see a single piece of
evidence in favor of them NOT using drugs and writing/performing drug
tainted songs!
