Once again, Israel has been caught with spies at the highest levels of
the US Government.
At the heart of the investigation are two people who work at The
American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), a powerful pro-
Israel lobby in Washington. The FBI investigation, headed up by Dave
Szady, has involved wiretaps, undercover surveillance and photography
that CBS News was told document the passing of classified information
from the mole, to the men at AIPAC, and on to the Israelis.

CBS sources say that last year the suspected spy, described as a
trusted analyst at the Pentagon, turned over a presidential directive
on U.S. policy toward Iran while it was, "in the draft phase when U.S.
policy-makers were still debating the policy." This put the Israelis,
according to one source, "inside the decision-making loop" so they
could "try to influence the outcome." [CBS News]

Once again Israel denies wrongdoing, or faced with incontrovertible
evidence (in this case one of the spies has reportedly cooperated with
the FBI) dismisses the spying with the claim that such spying is
harmless, because Israel and the United States are such good friends.

Well, let us take a closer look at that idea of "harmless espionage"
by recalling Israel's most famous failed spy, Jonathan Pollard.

Jonathan Pollard is an American of Jewish descent, born in Galveston
Texas, who established a career as an intelligence analyst for the US
Navy. There have been many theories offered as to why Pollard decided
to betray his country of birth to the Jewish state, but that Pollard
did betray his country of birth to Israel is beyond all doubt.
Pollard's defense was that he did not spy so much against the United
States, only that he spied for Israel, sending them documents that in
his opinion the US should have shared with Israel anyway.

That it was never Pollards job to decide what documents Israel should
have was apparently irrelevant. Pollard arrogated that authority to
himself. From his position of trust within the US Navy, Pollard
delivered over 1000 classified documents to Israel for which he was
well paid. Included in those documents were the names of over 150 US
agents in the Mideast, who were eventually "turned" into agents for
Israel.

But by far the most egregious damage done by Pollard was to steal
classified documents relating to the US Nuclear Deterrent relative to
the USSR and send them to Israel. According to sources in the US State
Department, Israel then turned around and traded those stolen nuclear
secrets to the USSR in exchange for increased emigration quotas from
the USSR to Israel. Other information that found its way from the US
to Israel to the USSR resulted in the loss of American agents
operating inside the USSR. Casper Weinberger, in his affidavit
opposing a reduced sentence for Pollard, described the damage done to
the United States thus, "[It is] difficult to conceive of a greater
harm to national security than that caused by... Pollard's treasonous
behavior."

This should end the suggestion that Israel's spies are harmless. They
are not. The United States' nuclear deterrent cost an estimated five
trillion taxpayer dollars during the 50s and 60s to build and
maintain, and less than $100,000 for Pollard to undermine. Israel
waited 13 years to admit Pollard had been spying for them, and now
lobbies for his release, having granted him Israeli citizenship.

Pollard is hardly the only Israeli spy operating in the United States.
He just had the misfortune to get caught. Here are just a few examples
of the Israeli spy operations that have been detected.

1947. Information collected by the ADL in its spy operations on US
citizens is used by the House Select Committee on Unamerican
Activities. Subcommittee Chair Clare Hoffman dismisses the ADL's
reports on suspected communists as "hearsay."

1950 John Davitt, former chief of the Justice Department's internal
security section notes that the Israeli intelligence service is the
second most active in the United States after the Soviets.

1954 A hidden microphone planted by the Israelis is discovered in the
Office of the US Ambassador in Tel Aviv.

1956 Telephone taps are found connected to two telephones in the
residence of the US military attach√© in Tel Aviv.

1954 "The Lavon Affair". Israeli agents recruit Egyptian citizens of
Jewish descent to bomb Western targets in Egypt, and plant evidence to
frame Arabs, in an apparent attempt to upset US-Egyptian relations.
Israeli defense minister Pinchas Lavon is eventually removed from
office, though many think real responsibility lay with David Ben-
Gurion.

1965 Israel apparently illegally obtains enriched uranium from NUMEC
Corporation. (Washington Post, 6/5/86, Charles R. Babcock, "US an
Intelligence Target of the Israelis, Officials Say.")

1967 Israel attacks the USS Liberty, an intelligence gathering vessel
flying a US flag, killing 34 crew members. See "Assault on the
Liberty," by James M. Ennes, Jr. (Random House). In 2004, Captain Ward
Boston, Senior Legal Counsel for the Navy's Court of Inquiry into the
attack swears under oath that President Lyndon Johnson ordered the
investigation to conclude accident, even though the evidence indicates
the attack was deliberate. Given the use by Israel of unmarked boats
and planes, and the machine-gunning of USS Liberty's lifeboats, the
most likely explanation is that USS Liberty was to be sunk with all
hands, with evidence left to frame Egypt for the sinking. This would
have dragged the US into the war on Israel's side.

1970 While working for Senator Henry "Scoop" Jackson, Richard Perle is
caught by the FBI giving classified information to Israel. Nothing is
done.

1978, Stephen Bryen, then a Senate Foreign Relations Committee
staffer, is overheard in a DC hotel offering confidential documents to
top Israeli military officials. Bryen obtains a lawyer, Nathan Lewin,
and the case heads for the grand jury, but is mysteriously dropped.
Bryen later goes to work for Richard Perle.

1979 Shin Beth [the Israeli internal security agency] tries to
penetrate the US Consulate General in Jerusalem through a "Honey
Trap", using a clerical employee who was having an affair with a
Jerusalem girl.

1985 The New York Times reports the FBI is aware of at least a dozen
incidents in which American officials transferred classified
information to the Israelis, quoting [former Assistant Director of the
F.B.I.] Mr. [Raymond] Wannal. The Justice Department does not
prosecute.

1985 Richard Smyth, the owner of MILCO, is indicted on charges of
smuggling nuclear timing devices to Israel (Washington Post,
10/31/86).

1987 April 24 Wall Street Journal headline: "Role of Israel in Iran-
Contra Scandal Won't be Explored in Detail by Panels"

1992 The Wall Street Journal reports that Israeli agents apparently
tried to steal Recon Optical Inc's top-secret airborne spy-camera
system.

1992 Stephen Bryen, caught offering confidential documents to Israel
in 1978, is serving on board of the pro-Israeli Jewish Institute for
National Security Affairs while continuing as a paid consultant --
with security clearance -- on exports of sensitive US technology.

1992 "The Samson Option," by Seymour M. Hersh reports, "Illicitly
obtained intelligence was flying so voluminously from LAKAM into
Israeli intelligence that a special code name, JUMBO, was added to the
security markings already on the documents. There were strict orders,
Ari Ben-Menashe recalled: "Anything marked JUMBO was not supposed to
be discussed with your American counterparts."

1993. The ADL is caught operating a massive spying operation on
critics of Israel, Arab-Americans, the San Francisco Labor Council,
ILWU Local 10, Oakland Educational Association, NAACP, Irish Northern
Aid, International Indian Treaty Council, the Asian Law Caucus and the
San Francisco police. Data collected was sent to Israel and in some
cases to South Africa. Pressure from Jewish organizations forces the
city to drop the criminal case, but the ADL settles a civil lawsuit
for an undisclosed sum of cash.

1995 The Defense Investigative Service circulates a memo warning US
military contractors that "Israel aggressively collects [US] military
and industrial technology." The report stated that Israel obtains
information using "ethnic targeting, financial aggrandizement, and
identification and exploitation of individual frailties" of US
citizens.

1996 A General Accounting Office report "Defense Industrial Security:
Weaknesses in US Security Arrangements With Foreign-Owned Defense
Contractors" found that according to intelligence sources "Country
A" (identified by intelligence sources as Israel, Washington Times,
2/22/96) "conducts the most aggressive espionage operation against the
United States of any US ally." The Jerusalem Post (8/30/96) quoted the
report, "Classified military information and sensitive military
technologies are high-priority targets for the intelligence agencies
of this country." The report described "An espionage operation run by
the intelligence organization responsible for collecting scientific
and technologic information for [Israel] paid a US government employee
to obtain US classified military intelligence documents." The
Washington Report on Middle East Affairs (Shawn L. Twing, April 1996)
noted that this was "a reference to the 1985 arrest of Jonathan
Pollard, a civilian US naval intelligence analyst who provided
Israel's LAKAM [Office of Special Tasks] espionage agency an estimated
800,000 pages of classified US intelligence information."

The GAO report also noted that "Several citizens of [Israel] were
caught in the United States stealing sensitive technology used in
manufacturing artillery gun tubes."

1996 An Office of Naval Intelligence document, "Worldwide Challenges
to Naval Strike Warfare" reported that "US technology has been
acquired [by China] through Israel in the form of the Lavi fighter and
possibly SAM [surface-to-air] missile technology." Jane's

SCANDAL OF THE LOBBY ZIONIST AIPAC: A PERFUME OF WATERGATE

Italian Parliament finger four forgers - Ahmad Chalabi , Francis
Brookes, Dewey Clarridge, and Michael Ledeen.

Original french at http://news.stcom.net/modules.php?name=AvantGo&amp;file=print&amp;sid=1603

July 22, the democratic group of the American Senate held a capital
hearing to evaluate the extent of the political implications and of
safety caused by the disclosure with the press of the identity of the
secret agent Valerie Plame. They also examined the behavior of the
White House and president Bush which, while refusing to seek and
sanction the persons in charge, worsened the damage.

Hearing was chaired by the deputy Henry Waxman and the senator Byron
Dorgan, director of Senate Democratic Policy Committee. For Waxman,
the revelation of the identity of Limes constitutes not only "one
treason and an affront indefensible in its opposition and towards
those which work on the lines of face to protect America", but also
"an indefensible violation of our national safety". Deputy, which had
voted in favour of the invasion of Iraq on the basis of what proved to
be lies and half-truths as for the weapons of destruction massive
(ADM) Iraqi, clearly implied that the Plame scandal is also a history
of lie "Today, says it, we know the truth. I was misled, as the
American people were misled, and it is the husband of Valerie Plame,
the ambassador Joe Wilson, who contributed to restore the truth.

"Until now, the White House did not provide any credible proof of an
agreement of uranium sale between Iraq and Niger", which however
constituted one of the key parts of is saying Iraqi threat nuclear "It
seems rather than the advisers of the President launched a smear
campaign (...) We have only one partial information on what occurred
in the hours and the days which followed [ the publication of the
article of Wilson bringing back the conclusions of its mission to
Niger ] (...) but we know that a secret memorandum of the State
Department exposing the identity of Valerie [ Limes that Karl Rove, to
advise nearest of the President, spoke about the identity of Mrs.
Wilson with the chronicler Robert Novak and the journalist of the
magazine Time Matthew Cooper; and that Lewis Libby, head of cabinet of
the office of the vice-president, also spoke about Mrs. Wilson with at
least a journalist "According to Waxman, the White House gave a report
on eleven escapes on the subject.

Various former analysts of the services of information deposited in
front of the senators and all underlined at which point it is serious
to reveal the identity of a secret agent. That endangers not only the
agent, but all the network of people with whom it is in contact,
clandestinely, in foreign countries where the information is
collected.

"the consequences are much more serious than I imagined it at the
beginning", declared the deputy John Conyers. Appointed the Louise
Slaughter asked the witnesses if they had already intended to say,
during their professional life, that the White House had revealed the
identity of a secret agent. Larry Johnson, former analyst with the
CIA, was categorical: "With large never! It is without precedent. "

The former officer of the military information (DIA) Patrick LANG
insisted on the importance of the factor confidence in the recruitment
of foreign citizens to become advisors of the CIA In the event of
escape, it is all their confidence towards the United States which is
blamed "When not only community of the information, but the elected
government (...) of the first country in the world decides,
deliberately and apparently for transitory political reasons and
without interest, to reveal the identity of a secret agent, the new
one makes the effect of a shock in the whole world (...)" One cannot
make confidence with the Americans", is said one never does it. "

Larry Johnson contradicted the assertions of the republican Party
according to which Plame was not really a clandestine agent since it
worked at the HQ of the CIA with Langley, or that it is it which had
organized the mission of her husband in Niger. These untrue assertions
were repeated by various republican members of Parliament.

For the former treating officer of the CIA Jim Marcinkowski, the
refusal of high persons in charge for the government to take their
responsabilities following this rupture for confidence, created large
a faintness with the power station "They played hide-and-seek with the
truth and to semantic plays for more than two years, at the expense of
the safety of the American people", he has said.

While were held these hearings, one learned in the New York Times that
the special prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald considers the possibility of
accusing of perjury Karl Rove and Lewis Libby because of
contradictions in their testimonys and of obstruction of justice.

The White House hopelessly tries to bury the business of uranium
native of Niger

EIR learned from several sources in Washington that the White House
makes its possible to prevent three bodies of press from revealing the
origins of the falsified documents of the government native of Niger,
intended to make believe that Saddam Hussein sought to obtain
significant quantities of uranium native of Niger to produce nuclear
weapons. After having taken knowledge of these documents, appeared in
Italy at the end of 2001, Dick Cheney asked the information agencies
to check information, which was to lead to the mission of the Wilson
ambassador in Niger in February 2002.

A news service, a chain of American television and a newspaper have
each one surveyed into the origin of the forgeries. Last year, the
emission of CBS, "60 minutes", cancelled at the last minute the
diffusion of a special sequence on the business of uranium native of
Niger to cover the "scandal" which had just burst concerning the
military service of George W Bush. The two other media are about to
finish their investigations, and according to our sources, the White
House exerts pressures so that they extinguish the business.

In Italy, the Parliament comes to conclude a study on the origins and
the consequences from the forgeries, and according to certain sources,
the report/ratio mentions among the principal suspects Michael Ledeen,
Dewey Clarridge, Ahmed Chalabi and Francis Brookes.

Let us recall that Ledeen works like "consultant" near the service of
Italian information SISMI since long years (since the beginning of the
Eighties and the bursting of the scandal around the P2 cabin). To
December 2001, at the time where the documents natives of Niger were
transmitted to the SISMI, it went to Rome in company of Harold Rhode
and of Lawrence Franklin of the Pentagon, officially to meet Manucher
Ghorbanifar, large protagonist of the Business Iran-Countered.
Franklin is at the present time accused to have transmitted secret
information to the AIPAC like with a person in charge for the embassy
of Israel.

The fact that Clarridge, Chalabi and Brookes (related to Iraqi
National Congress (Inc)), are mentioned is particularly interesting.
With the end of the year 2001, the tsar of the counter-terrorism of
the White House was the General (Cr) Wayne DOWNING. He proposed to
take Clarridge for assistant. Brookes came from Rendon Group, a
cabinet of "public relations" that the Pentagon engaged to promote
Chalabi and the Inc.

Which is the role of the White House in these forgeries? Did the
government only exploit the information to arrive to its ends, or a
group of n√©o-conservative around Cheney it took part in their
manufacture? No one will not be astonished by the current efforts of
the White House to prevent this business from bursting at the great
day.

Once again, Israel has been caught with spies at the highest levels of
the US Government.
At the heart of the investigation are two people who work at The
American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), a powerful pro-
Israel lobby in Washington. The FBI investigation, headed up by Dave
Szady, has involved wiretaps, undercover surveillance and photography
that CBS News was told document the passing of classified information
from the mole, to the men at AIPAC, and on to the Israelis.

CBS sources say that last year the suspected spy, described as a
trusted analyst at the Pentagon, turned over a presidential directive
on U.S. policy toward Iran while it was, "in the draft phase when U.S.
policy-makers were still debating the policy." This put the Israelis,
according to one source, "inside the decision-making loop" so they
could "try to influence the outcome." [CBS News]

Once again Israel denies wrongdoing, or faced with incontrovertible
evidence (in this case one of the spies has reportedly cooperated with
the FBI) dismisses the spying with the claim that such spying is
harmless, because Israel and the United States are such good friends.

Well, let us take a closer look at that ide
a of "harmless espionage"
by recalling Israel's most famous failed spy, Jonathan Pollard.

Jonathan Pollard is an American of Jewish descent, born in Galveston
Texas, who established a career as an intelligence analyst for the US
Navy. There have been many theories offered as to why Pollard decided
to betray his country of birth to the Jewish state, but that Pollard
did betray his country of birth to Israel is beyond all doubt.
Pollard's defense was that he did not spy so much against the United
States, only that he spied for Israel, sending them documents that in
his opinion the US should have shared with Israel anyway.

That it was never Pollards job to decide what documents Israel should
have was apparently irrelevant. Pollard arrogated that authority to
himself. From his position of trust within the US Navy, Pollard
delivered over 1000 classified documents to Israel for which he was
well paid. Included in those documents were the names of over 150 US
agents in the Mideast, who were eventually "turned" into agents for
Israel.

But by far the most egregious damage done by Pollard was to steal
classified documents relating to the US Nuclear Deterrent relative to
the USSR and send them to Israel. According to sources in the US State
Department, Israel then turned around and traded those stolen nuclear
secrets to the USSR in exchange for increased emigration quotas from
the USSR to Israel. Other information that found its way from the US
to Israel to the USSR resulted in the loss of American agents
operating inside the USSR. Casper Weinberger, in his affidavit
opposing a reduced sentence for Pollard, described the damage done to
the United States thus, "[It is] difficult to conceive of a greater
harm to national security than that caused by... Pollard's treasonous
behavior."

This should end the suggestion that Israel's spies are harmless. They
are not. The United States' nuclear deterrent cost an estimated five
trillion taxpayer dollars during the 50s and 60s to build and
maintain, and less than $100,000 for Pollard to undermine. Israel
waited 13 years to admit Pollard had been spying for them, and now
lobbies for his release, having granted him Israeli citizenship.

Pollard is hardly the only Israeli spy operating in the United States.
He just had the misfortune to get caught. Here are just a few examples
of the Israeli spy operations that have been detected.

1947. Information collected by the ADL in its spy operations on US
citizens is used by the House Select Committee on Unamerican
Activities. Subcommittee Chair Clare Hoffman dismisses the ADL's
reports on suspected communists as "hearsay."

1950 John Davitt, former chief of the Justice Department's internal
security section notes that the Israeli intelligence service is the
second most active in the United States after the Soviets.

1954 A hidden microphone planted by the Israelis is discovered in the
Office of the US Ambassador in Tel Aviv.

1956 Telephone taps are found connected to two telephones in the
residence of the US military attach√© in Tel Aviv.

1954 "The Lavon Affair". Israeli agents recruit Egyptian citizens of
Jewish descent to bomb Western targets in Egypt, and plant evidence to
frame Arabs, in an apparent attempt to upset US-Egyptian relations.
Israeli defense minister Pinchas Lavon is eventually removed from
office, though many think real responsibility lay with David Ben-
Gurion.

1965 Israel apparently illegally obtains enriched uranium from NUMEC
Corporation. (Washington Post, 6/5/86, Charles R. Babcock, "US an
Intelligence Target of the Israelis, Officials Say.")

1967 Israel attacks the USS Liberty, an intelligence gathering vessel
flying a US flag, killing 34 crew members. See "Assault on the
Liberty," by James M. Ennes, Jr. (Random House). In 2004, Captain Ward
Boston, Senior Legal Counsel for the Navy's Court of Inquiry into the
attack swears under oath that President Lyndon Johnson ordered the
investigation to conclude accident, even though the evidence indicates
the attack was deliberate. Given the use by Israel of unmarked boats
and planes, and the machine-gunning of USS Liberty's lifeboats, the
most likely explanation is that USS Liberty was to be sunk with all
hands, with evidence left to frame Egypt for the sinking. This would
have dragged the US into the war on Israel's side.

1970 While wo
rking for Senator Henry "Scoop" Jackson, Richard Perle is
caught by the FBI giving classified information to Israel. Nothing is
done.

1978, Stephen Bryen, then a Senate Foreign Relations Committee
staffer, is overheard in a DC hotel offering confidential documents to
top Israeli military officials. Bryen obtains a lawyer, Nathan Lewin,
and the case heads for the grand jury, but is mysteriously dropped.
Bryen later goes to work for Richard Perle.

1979 Shin Beth [the Israeli internal security agency] tries to
penetrate the US Consulate General in Jerusalem through a "Honey
Trap", using a clerical employee who was having an affair with a
Jerusalem girl.

1985 The New York Times reports the FBI is aware of at least a dozen
incidents in which American officials transferred classified
information to the Israelis, quoting [former Assistant Director of the
F.B.I.] Mr. [Raymond] Wannal. The Justice Department does not
prosecute.

1985 Richard Smyth, the owner of MILCO, is indicted on charges of
smuggling nuclear timing devices to Israel (Washington Post,
10/31/86).

1987 April 24 Wall Street Journal headline: "Role of Israel in Iran-
Contra Scandal Won't be Explored in Detail by Panels"

1992 The Wall Street Journal reports that Israeli agents apparently
tried to steal Recon Optical Inc's top-secret airborne spy-camera
system.

1992 Stephen Bryen, caught offering confidential documents to Israel
in 1978, is serving on board of the pro-Israeli Jewish Institute for
National Security Affairs while continuing as a paid consultant --
with security clearance -- on exports of sensitive US technology.

SCANDAL OF THE LOBBY ZIONIST AIPAC: A PERFUME OF WATERGATE

Italian Parliament finger four forgers - Ahmad Chalabi , Francis
Brookes, Dewey Clarridge, and Michael Ledeen.

Original french at http://news.stcom.net/modules.php?name=AvantGo&amp;file=print&amp;sid=1603

July 22, the democratic group of the American Senate held a capital
hearing to evaluate the extent of the political implications and of
safety caused by the disclosure with the press of the identity of the
secret agent Valerie Plame. They also examined the behavior of the
White House and president Bush which, while refusing to seek and
sanction the persons in charge, worsened the damage.

Hearing was chaired by the deputy Henry Waxman and the senator Byron
Dorgan, director of Senate Democratic Policy Committee. For Waxman,
the revelation of the identity of Limes constitutes not only "one
treason and an affront indefensible in its opposition and towards
those which work on the lines of face to protect America", but also
"an indefensible violation of our national safety". Deputy, which had
voted in favour of the invasion of Iraq on the basis of what proved to
be lies and half-truths as for the weapons of destruction massive
(ADM) Iraqi, clearly implied that the Plame scandal is also a history
of lie "Today, says it, we know the truth. I was misled, as the
American people were misled, and it is the husband of Valerie Plame,
the ambassador Joe Wilson, who contributed to restore the truth.

"Until now, the White House did not provide any credible proof of an
agreement of uranium sale between Iraq and Niger", which however
constituted one of the key parts of is saying Iraqi threat nuclear "It
seems rather than the advisers of the President launched a smear
campaign (...) We have only one partial information on what occurred
in the hours and the days which followed [ the publication of the
article of Wilson bringing back the conclusions of its mission to
Niger ] (...) but we know that a secret memorandum of the State
Department exposing the identity of Valerie [ Limes that Karl Rove, to
advise nearest of the President, spoke about the identity of Mrs.
Wilson with the chronicler Robert Novak and the journalist of the
magazine Time Matthew Cooper; and that Lewis Libby, head of cabinet of
the office of the vice-president, also spoke about Mrs. Wilson with at
least a journalist "According to Waxman, the White House gave a report
on eleven escapes on the subject.

Various former analysts of the services of information deposited in
front of the senators and all underlined at which point it is serious
to reveal the identity of a secret agent. That endangers not only the
agent, but all the network of people with whom it is in contact,
clandestinely, in foreign countries where the information is
collected.

"the consequences are much more serious than I imagined it at the
beginning", declared the deputy John Conyers. Appointed the Louise
Slaughter asked the witnesses if they had already intended to say,
during their professional life, that the White House had revealed the
identity of a secret agent. Larry Johnson, former analyst with the
CIA, was categorical: "With large never! It is without precedent. "

The former officer of the military information (DIA) Patrick LANG
insisted on the importance of the factor confidence in the recruitment
of foreign citizens to become advisors of the CIA In the event of
escape, it is all their confidence towards the United States which is
blamed "When not only community of the information, but the elected
government (...) of the first country in the world decides,
deliberately and apparently for transitory political reasons and
without interest, to reveal the identity of a secret agent, the new
one makes the effect of a shock in the whole world (...)" One cannot
make confidence with the Americans", is said one never does it. "

Larry Johnson contradicted the assertions of the republican Party
according to which Plame was not really a clandestine agent since it
worked at the HQ of the CIA with Langley, or that it is it which had
organized the mission of her husband in Niger. These untrue assertions
were r
epeated by various republican members of Parliament.

For the former treating officer of the CIA Jim Marcinkowski, the
refusal of high persons in charge for the government to take their
responsabilities following this rupture for confidence, created large
a faintness with the power station "They played hide-and-seek with the
truth and to semantic plays for more than two years, at the expense of
the safety of the American people", he has said.

While were held these hearings, one learned in the New York Times that
the special prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald considers the possibility of
accusing of perjury Karl Rove and Lewis Libby because of
contradictions in their testimonys and of obstruction of justice.

The White House hopelessly tries to bury the business of uranium
native of Niger

EIR learned from several sources in Washington that the White House
makes its possible to prevent three bodies of press from revealing the
origins of the falsified documents of the government native of Niger,
intended to make believe that Saddam Hussein sought to obtain
significant quantities of uranium native of Niger to produce nuclear
weapons. After having taken knowledge of these documents, appeared in
Italy at the end of 2001, Dick Cheney asked the informa
tion agencies
to check information, which was to lead to the mission of the Wilson
ambassador in Niger in February 2002.

A news service, a chain of American television and a newspaper have
each one surveyed into the origin of the forgeries. Last year, the
emission of CBS, "60 minutes", cancelled at the last minute the
diffusion of a special sequence on the business of uranium native of
Niger to cover the "scandal" which had just burst concerning the
military service of George W Bush. The two other media are about to
finish their investigations, and according to our sources, the White
House exerts pressures so that they extinguish the business.

In Italy, the Parliament comes to conclude a study on the origins and
the consequences from the forgeries, and according to certain sources,
the report/ratio mentions among the principal suspects Michael Ledeen,
Dewey Clarridge, Ahmed Chalabi and Francis Brookes.

Let us recall that Ledeen works like "consultant" near the service of
Italian information SISMI since long years (since the beginning of the
Eighties and the bursting of the scandal around the P2 cabin). To
December 2001, at the time where the documents natives of Niger were
transmitted to the SISMI, it went to Rome in company of Harold Rhode
and of Lawrence Franklin of the Pentagon, officially to meet Manucher
Ghorbanifar, large protagonist of the Business Iran-Countered.
Franklin is at the present time accused to have transmitted secret
information to the AIPAC like with a person in charge for the embassy
of Israel.

The fact that Clarridge, Chalabi and Brookes (related to Iraqi
National Congress (Inc)), are mentioned is particularly interesting.
With the end of the year 2001, the tsar of the counter-terrorism of
the White House was the General (Cr) Wayne DOWNING. He proposed to
take Clarridge for assistant. Brookes came from Rendon Group, a
cabinet of "public relations" that the Pentagon engaged to promote
Chalabi and the Inc.

Which is the role of the White House in these forgeries? Did the
government only exploit the information to arrive to its ends, or a
group of n√©o-conservative around Cheney it took part in their
manufacture? No one will not be astonished by the current efforts of
the White House to prevent this business from bursting at the great
day.

SCANDAL OF THE LOBBY ZIONIST AIPAC: A PERFUME OF WATERGATE

Italian Parliament finger four forgers - Ahmad Chalabi , Francis
Brookes, Dewey Clarridge, and Michael Ledeen.

Original french at http://news.stcom.net/modules.php?name=AvantGo&amp;file=print&amp;sid=1603

July 22, the democratic group of the American Senate held a capital
hearing to evaluate the extent of the political implications and of
safety caused by the disclosure with the press of the identity of the
secret agent Valerie Plame. They also examined the behavior of the
White House and president Bush which, while refusing to seek and
sanction the persons in charge, worsened the damage.

Hearing was chaired by the deputy Henry Waxman and the senator Byron
Dorgan, director of Senate Democratic Policy Committee. For Waxman,
the revelation of the identity of Limes constitutes not only "one
treason and an affront indefensible in its opposition and towards
those which work on the lines of face to protect America", but also
"an indefensible violation of our national safety". Deputy, which had
voted in favour of the invasion of Iraq on the basis of what proved to
be lies and half-truths as for the weapons of destruction massive
(ADM) Iraqi, clearly implied that the Plame scandal is also a history
of lie "Today, says it, we know the truth. I was misled, as the
American people were misled, and it is the husband of Valerie Plame,
the ambassador Joe Wilson, who contributed to restore the truth.

"Until now, the White House did not provide any credible proof of an
agreement of uranium sale between Iraq and Niger", which however
constituted one of the key parts of is saying Iraqi threat nuclear "It
seems rather than the advisers of the President launched a smear
campaign (...) We have only one partial information on what occurred
in the hours and the days which followed [ the publication of the
article of Wilson bringing back the conclusions of its mission to
Niger ] (...) but we know that a secret memorandum of the State
Department exposing the identity of Valerie [ Limes that Karl Rove, to
advise nearest of the President, spoke about the identity of Mrs.
Wilson with the chronicler Robert Novak and the journalist of the
magazine Time Matthew Cooper; and that Lewis Libby, head of cabinet of
the office of the vice-president, also spoke about Mrs. Wilson with at
least a journalist "According to Waxman, the White House gave a report
on eleven escapes on the subject.

Various former analysts of the services of information deposited in
front of the senators and all underlined at which point it is serious
to reveal the identity of a secret agent. That endangers not only the
agent, but all the network of people with whom it is in contact,
clandestinely, in foreign countries where the information is
collected.

"the consequences are much more serious than I imagined it at the
beginning", declared the deputy John Conyers. Appointed the Louise
Slaughter asked the witnesses if they had already intended to say,
during their professional life, that the White House had revealed the
identity of a secret agent. Larry Johnson, former analyst with the
CIA, was categorical: "With large never! It is without precedent. "

The former officer of the military information (DIA) Patrick LANG
insisted on the importance of the factor confidence in the recruitment
of foreign citizens to become advisors of the CIA In the event of
escape, it is all their confidence towards the United States which is
blamed "When not only community of the information, but the elected
government (...) of the first country in the world decides,
deliberately and apparently for transitory political reasons and
without interest, to reveal the identity of a secret agent, the new
one makes the effect of a shock in the whole world (...)" One cannot
make confidence with the Americans", is said one never does it. "

Larry John
son contradicted the assertions of the republican Party
according to which Plame was not really a clandestine agent since it
worked at the HQ of the CIA with Langley, or that it is it which had
organized the mission of her husband in Niger. These untrue assertions
were r
epeated by various republican members of Parliament.

For the former treating officer of the CIA Jim Marcinkowski, the
refusal of high persons in charge for the government to take their
responsabilities following this rupture for confidence, created large
a faintness with the power station "They played hide-and-seek with the
truth and to semantic plays for more than two years, at the expense of
the safety of the American people", he has said.

While were held these hearings, one learned in the New York Times that
the special prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald considers the possibility of
accusing of perjury Karl Rove and Lewis Libby because of
contradictions in their testimonys and of obstruction of justice.

The White House hopelessly tries to bury the business of uranium
native of Niger

EIR learned from several sources in Washington that the White House
makes its possible to prevent three bodies of press from revealing the
origins of the falsified documents of the government native of Niger,
intended to make believe that Saddam Hussein sought to obtain
significant quantities of uranium native of Niger to produce nuclear
weapons. After having taken knowledge of these documents, appeared in
Italy at the end of 2001, Dick Cheney asked the informa
tion agencies
to check information, which was to lead to the mission of the Wilson
ambassador in Niger in February 2002.

A news service, a chain of American television and a newspaper have
each one surveyed into the origin of the forgeries. Last year, the
emission of CBS, "60 minutes", cancelled at the last minute the
diffusion of a special sequence on the business of uranium native of
Niger to cover the "scandal" which had just burst concerning the
military service of George W Bush. The two other media are about to
finish their investigations, and according to our sources, the White
House exerts pressures so that they extinguish the business.

In Italy, the Parliament comes to conclude a study on the origins and
the consequences from the forgeries, and according to certain sources,
the report/ratio mentions among the principal suspects Michael Ledeen,
Dewey Clarridge, Ahmed Chalabi and Francis Brookes.

Let us recall that Ledeen works like "consultant" near the service of
Italian information SISMI since long years (since the beginning of the
Eighties and the bursting of the scandal around the P2 cabin). To
December 2001, at the time where the documents natives of Niger were
transmitted to the SISMI, it went to Rome in company of Harold Rhode
and of Lawrence Franklin of the Pentagon, officially to meet Manucher
Ghorbanifar, large protagonist of the Business Iran-Countered.
Franklin is at the present time accused to have transmitted secret
information to the AIPAC like with a person in charge for the embassy
of Israel.

The fact that Clarridge, Chalabi and Brookes (related to Iraqi
National Congress (Inc)), are mentioned is particularly interesting.
With the end of the year 2001, the tsar of the counter-terrorism of
the White House was the General (Cr) Wayne DOWNING. He proposed to
take Clarridge for assistant. Brookes came from Rendon Group, a
cabinet of "public relations" that the Pentagon engaged to promote
Chalabi and the Inc.

Which is the role of the White House in these forgeries? Did the
government only exploit the information to arrive to its ends, or a
group of n√©o-conservative around Cheney it took part in their
manufacture? No one will not be astonished by the current efforts of
the White House to prevent this business from bursting at the great
day.

Once again, Israel has been caught with spies at the highest levels of
the US Government.
At the heart of the investigation are two people who work at The
American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), a powerful pro-
Israel lobby in Washington. The FBI investigation, headed up by Dave
Szady, has involved wiretaps, undercover surveillance and photography
that CBS News was told document the passing of classified information
from the mole, to the men at AIPAC, and on to the Israelis.

CBS sources say that last year the suspected spy, described as a
trusted analyst at the Pentagon, turned over a presidential directive
on U.S. policy toward Iran while it was, "in the draft phase when U.S.
policy-makers were still debating the policy." This put the Israelis,
according to one source, "inside the decision-making loop" so they
could "try to influence the outcome." [CBS News]

Once again Israel denies wrongdoing, or faced with incontrovertible
evidence (in this case one of the spies has reportedly cooperated with
the FBI) dismisses the spying with the claim that such spying is
harmless, because Israel and the United States are such good friends.

Well, let us take a closer look at that ide
a of "harmless espionage"
by recalling Israel's most famous failed spy, Jonathan Pollard.

Jonathan Pollard is an American of Jewish descent, born in Galveston
Texas, who established a career as an intelligence analyst for the US
Navy. There have been many theories offered as to why Pollard decided
to betray his country of birth to the Jewish state, but that Pollard
did betray his country of birth to Israel is beyond all doubt.
Pollard's defense was that he did not spy so much against the United
States, only that he spied for Israel, sending them documents that in
his opinion the US should have shared with Israel anyway.

That it was never Pollards job to decide what documents Israel should
have was apparently irrelevant. Pollard arrogated that authority to
himself. From his position of trust within the US Navy, Pollard
delivered over 1000 classified documents to Israel for which he was
well paid. Included in those documents were the names of over 150 US
agents in the Mideast, who were eventually "turned" into agents for
Israel.

But by far the most egregious damage done by Pollard was to steal
classified documents relating to the US Nuclear Deterrent relative to
the USSR and send them to Israel. According to sources in the US State
Department, Israel then turned around and traded those stolen nuclear
secrets to the USSR in exchange for increased emigration quotas from
the USSR to Israel. Other information that found its way from the US
to Israel to the USSR resulted in the loss of American agents
operating inside the USSR. Casper Weinberger, in his affidavit
opposing a reduced sentence for Pollard, described the damage done to
the United States thus, "[It is] difficult to conceive of a greater
harm to national security than that caused by... Pollard's treasonous
behavior."

This should end the suggestion that Israel's spies are harmless. They
are not. The United States' nuclear deterrent cost an estimated five
trillion taxpayer dollars during the 50s and 60s to build and
maintain, and less than $100,000 for Pollard to undermine. Israel
waited 13 years to admit Pollard had been spying for them, and now
lobbies for his release, having granted him Israeli citizenship.

Pollard is hardly the only Israeli spy operating in the United States.
He just had the misfortune to get caught. Here are just a few examples
of the Israeli spy operations that have been detected.

1947. Information collected by the ADL in its spy operations on US
citizens is used by the House Select Committee on Unamerican
Activities. Subcommittee Chair Clare Hoffman dismisses the ADL's
reports on suspected communists as "hearsay."

1950 John Davitt, former chief of the Justice Department's internal
security section notes that the Israeli intelligence service is the
second most active in the United States after the Soviets.

1954 A hidden microphone planted by the Israelis is discovered in the
Office of the US Ambassador in Tel Aviv.

1956 Telephone taps are found connected to two telephones in the
residence of the US military attach√© in Tel Aviv.

1954 "The Lavon Affair". Israeli agents recruit Egyptian citizens of
Jewish descent to bomb Western targets in Egypt, and plant evidence to
frame Arabs, in an apparent attempt to upset US-Egyptian relations.
Israeli defense minister Pinchas Lavon is eventually removed from
office, though many think real responsibility lay with David Ben-
Gurion.

1965 Israel apparently illegally obtains enriched uranium from NUMEC
Corporation. (Washington Post, 6/5/86, Charles R. Babcock, "US an
Intelligence Target of the Israelis, Officials Say.")

1967 Israel attacks the USS Liberty, an intelligence gathering vessel
flying a US flag, killing 34 crew members. See "Assault on the
Liberty," by James M. Ennes, Jr. (Random House). In 2004, Captain Ward
Boston, Senior Legal Counsel for the Navy's Court of Inquiry into the
attack swears under oath that President Lyndon Johnson ordered the
investigation to conclude accident, even though the evidence indicates
the attack was deliberate. Given the use by Israel of unmarked boats
and planes, and the machine-gunning of USS Liberty's lifeboats, the
most likely explanation is that USS Liberty was to be sunk with all
hands, with evidence left to frame Egypt for the sinking. This would
have dragged the US into the war on Israel's side.

1970 While wo
rking for Senator Henry "Scoop" Jackson, Richard Perle is
caught by the FBI giving classified information to Israel. Nothing is
done.

1978, Stephen Bryen, then a Senate Foreign Relations Committee
staffer, is overheard in a DC hotel offering confidential documents to
top Israeli military officials. Bryen obtains a lawyer, Nathan Lewin,
and the case heads for the grand jury, but is mysteriously dropped.
Bryen later goes to work for Richard Perle.

1979 Shin Beth [the Israeli internal security agency] tries to
penetrate the US Consulate General in Jerusalem through a "Honey
Trap", using a clerical employee who was having an affair with a
Jerusalem girl.

1985 The New York Times reports the FBI is aware of at least a dozen
incidents in which American officials transferred classified
information to the Israelis, quoting [former Assistant Director of the
F.B.I.] Mr. [Raymond] Wannal. The Justice Department does not
prosecute.

1985 Richard Smyth, the owner of MILCO, is indicted on charges of
smuggling nuclear timing devices to Israel (Washington Post,
10/31/86).

1987 April 24 Wall Street Journal headline: "Role of Israel in Iran-
Contra Scandal Won't be Explored in Detail by Panels"

1992 The Wall Street Journal reports that Israeli agents apparently
tried to steal Recon Optical Inc's top-secret airborne spy-camera
system.

1992 Stephen Bryen, caught offering confidential documents to Israel
in 1978, is serving on board of the pro-Israeli Jewish Institute for
National Security Affairs while continuing as a paid consultant --
with security clearance -- on exports of sensitive US technology.

1992 "The Samson Option," by Seymour M. Hersh reports, "Illicitly
obtained intelligence was flying so voluminously from LAKAM into
Israeli intelligence that a special code name, JUMBO, was added to the
security markings already on the documents. There were strict orders,
Ari Ben-Menashe recalled: "Anything marked JUMBO was not supposed to
be discussed with your American counterparts."

1993. The ADL is caught operating a massive spying operation on
critics of Israel, Arab-Americans, the San Francisco Labor Council,
I
LWU Local 10, Oakland Educational Association, NAACP, Irish Northern
Aid, International Indian Treaty Council, the Asian Law Caucus and the
San Francisco police. Data collected was sent to Israel and in some
cases to South Africa. Pressure from Jewish organizations forces the
city to drop the criminal case, but the ADL settles a civil lawsuit
for an undisclosed sum of cash.

1995 The Defense Investigative Service circulates a memo warning US
military contractors that "Israel aggressively collects [US] military
and industrial technology." The report stated that Israel obtains
information using "ethnic targeting, financial aggrandizement, and
identification and exploitation of individual frailties" of US
citizens.

1996 A General Accounting Office report "Defense Industrial Security:
Weaknesses in US Security Arrangements With Foreign-Owned Defense
Contractors" found that according to intelligence sources "Country
A" (identified by intelligence sources as Israel, Washington Times,
2/22/96) "conducts the most aggressive espionage operation against the
United States of any US ally." The Jerusalem Post (8/30/96) quoted the
report, "Classified military information and sensitive military
technologies are high-priority targets for the intelligence agencies
of this country." The report described "An espionage operation run by
the intelligence organization responsible for collecting scientific
and technologic information for [Israel] paid a US government employee
to obtain US classified military intelligence documents." The
Washington Report on Middle East Affairs (Shawn L. Twing, April 1996)
noted that this was "a reference to the 1985 arrest of Jonathan
Pollard, a civilian US naval intelligence analyst who provided
Israel's LAKAM [Office of Special Tasks] espionage agency an estimated
800,000 pages of classified US intelligence information."

The GAO report also noted that "Several

SCANDAL OF THE LOBBY ZIONIST AIPAC: A PERFUME OF WATERGATE

Italian Parliament finger four forgers - Ahmad Chalabi , Francis
Brookes, Dewey Clarridge, and Michael Ledeen.

Original french at http://news.stcom.net/modules.php?name=AvantGo&amp;file=print&amp;sid=1603

July 22, the democratic group of the American Senate held a capital
hearing to evaluate the extent of the political implications and of
safety caused by the disclosure with the press of the identity of the
secret agent Valerie Plame. They also examined the behavior of the
White House and president Bush which, while refusing to seek and
sanction the persons in charge, worsened the damage.

Hearing was chaired by the deputy Henry Waxman and the senator Byron
Dorgan, director of Senate Democratic Policy Committee. For Waxman,
the revelation of the identity of Limes constitutes not only "one
treason and an affront indefensible in its opposition and towards
those which work on the lines of face to protect America", but also
"an indefensible violation of our national safety". Deputy, which had
voted in favour of the invasion of Iraq on the basis of what proved to
be lies and half-truths as for the weapons of destruction massive
(ADM) Iraqi, clearly implied that the Plame scandal is also a history
of lie "Today, says it, we know the truth. I was misled, as the
American people were misled, and it is the husband of Valerie Plame,
the ambassador Joe Wilson, who contributed to restore the truth.

"Until now, the White House did not provide any credible proof of an
agreement of uranium sale between Iraq and Niger", which however
constituted one of the key parts of is saying Iraqi threat nuclear "It
seems rather than the advisers of the President launched a smear
campaign (...) We have only one partial information on what occurred
in the hours and the days which followed [ the publication of the
article of Wilson bringing back the conclusions of its mission to
Niger ] (...) but we know that a secret memorandum of the State
Department exposing the identity of Valerie [ Limes that Karl Rove, to
advise nearest of the President, spoke about the identity of Mrs.
Wilson with the chronicler Robert Novak and the journalist of the
magazine Time Matthew Cooper; and that Lewis Libby, head of cabinet of
the office of the vice-president, also spoke about Mrs. Wilson with at
least a journalist "According to Waxman, the White House gave a report
on eleven escapes on the subject.

Various former analysts of the services of information deposited in
front of the senators and all underlined at which point it is serious
to reveal the identity of a secret agent. That endangers not only the
agent, but all the network of people with whom it is in contact,
clandestinely, in foreign countries where the information is
collected.

"the consequences are much more serious than I imagined it at the
beginning", declared the deputy John Conyers. Appointed the Louise
Slaughter asked the witnesses if they had already intended to say,
during their professional life, that the White House had revealed the
identity of a secret agent. Larry Johnson, former analyst with the
CIA, was categorical: "With large never! It is without precedent. "

The former officer of the military information (DIA) Patrick LANG
insisted on the importance of the factor confidence in the recruitment
of foreign citizens to become advisors of the CIA In the event of
escape, it is all their confidence towards the United States which is
blamed "When not only community of the information, but the elected
government (...) of the first country in the world decides,
deliberately and apparently for transitory political reasons and
without interest, to reveal the identity of a secret agent, the new
one makes the effect
of a shock in the whole world (...)" One cannot
make confidence with the Americans", is said one never does it. "

Larry John
son contradicted the assertions of the republican Party
according to which Plame was not really a clandestine agent since it
worked at the HQ of the CIA with Langley, or that it is it which had
organized the mission of her husband in Niger. These untrue assertions
were r
epeated by various republican members of Parliament.

For the former treating officer of the CIA Jim Marcinkowski, the
refusal of high persons in charge for the government to take their
responsabilities following this rupture for confidence, created large
a faintness with the power station "They played hide-and-seek with the
truth and to semantic plays for more than two years, at the expense of
the safety of the American people", he has said.

While were held these hearings, one learned in the New York Times that
the special prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald considers the possibility of
accusing of perjury Karl Rove and Lewis Libby because of
contradictions in their testimonys and of obstruction of justice.

The White House hopelessly tries to bury the business of uranium
native of Niger

EIR learned from several sources in Washington that the White House
makes its possible to prevent three bodies of press from revealing the
origins of the falsified documents of the government native of Niger,
intended to make believe that Saddam Hussein sought to obtain
significant quantities of uranium native of Niger to produce nuclear
weapons. After having taken knowledge of these documents, appeared in
Italy at the end of 2001, Dick Cheney asked the informa
tion agencies
to check information, which was to lead to the mission of the Wilson
ambassador in Niger in February 2002.

A news service, a chain of American television and a newspaper have
each one surveyed into the origin of the forgeries. Last year, the
emission of CBS, "60 minutes", cancelled at the last minute the
diffusion of a special sequence on the business of uranium native of
Niger to cover the "scandal" which had just burst concerning the
military service of George W Bush. The two other media are about to
finish their investigations, and according to our sources, the White
House exerts pressures so that they extinguish the business.

In Italy, the Parliament comes to conclude a study on the origins and
the consequences from the forgeries, and according to certain sources,
the report/ratio mentions among the principal suspects Michael Ledeen,
Dewey Clarridge, Ahmed Chalabi and Francis Brookes.

Let us recall that Ledeen works like "consultant" near the service of
Italian information SISMI since long years (since the beginning of the
Eighties and the bursting of the scandal around the P2 cabin). To
December 2001, at the time where the documents natives of Niger were
transmitted to the SISMI, it went to Rome in company of Harold Rhode
and of Lawrence Franklin of the Pentagon, officially to meet Manucher
Ghorbanifar, large protagonist of the Business Iran-Countered.
Franklin is at the present time accused to have transmitted secret
information to the AIPAC like with a person in charge for the embassy
of Israel.

The fact that Clarridge, Chalabi and Brookes (related to Iraqi
National Congress (Inc)), are mentioned is particularly interesting.
With the end of the year 2001, the tsar of the counter-terrorism of
the White House was the General (Cr) Wayne DOWNING. He proposed to
take Clarridge for assistant. Brookes came from Rendon Group, a
cabinet of "public relations" that the Pentagon engaged to promote
Chalabi and the Inc.

Which is the role of the White House in these forgeries? Did the
government only exploit the information to arrive to its ends, or a
group of n√©o-conservative around Cheney it took part in their
manufacture? No one will not be astonished by the current efforts of
the White House to prevent this business from bursting at the great
day.
