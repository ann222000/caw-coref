Anyone know if they have plans to collect all these incredibly short
episodes and sell them all together as HL3 some day?

No, because they are continuations from HL2. They may do some other
package, but calling it HL3 would make no sense.

I bet. And it sure will have HL2 in the package again because retailers
wouldn't want it any different and otherwise it wouldn't be complete.

They are bound to be bundled at some point.  I don't think Ep3 is the
end of episodic though - didn't I read somewhere that Ep4 was planned
but not by Valve? (which I guess is what JL is basing his 'Valve is
getting out of game-making' posts on).

Do you have a link for that? Quick googleing turned up nothing solid but I
do remember that Newell somewhere said that after EP3 they will look back
at episodic gaming and analyse it which to me implies that they hopefully
accept that it was a failure and either move on or do a full HL3 or HL4.

Great reviews (even here!), apparently selling well.

Think of how long and costly it would be t produce a game with the

Sure, as the development/design tools get better it might be possible,
but one has to be realistic.

Back when the episodes were first announced and around the time when ep1
was being hyped, I think I remember Valve saying that they already planned
on bundling all three episodes and selling together once they were all
released and were 'fading' into history.

But this was also back when they were saying they were going to release the
episodes just mere 6 months are so apart.

Just found this on Action Trip from an interview with Newell in 2007:

ActionTrip: In the long run, how do you see the episodic content working
out for you guys?

Gabe Newell: Well, our goal was to do two new episodes of the trilogy and
then, sit down with our customers and say, &quot;So what do you think? You've
had a chance to see this different a couple of times. Do you want us to
continue, or do you want us to shorten? Do you want smaller episodes more
often, or do you want us to go back to the larger scale-model?&quot; So, you
know, we're giving it a shot and then we'll find out.

If everything would have been great about episodic content why wait for
feedback? I guess Valve itself noticed that episodes coming out years
apart don't make much sense and the short length isn't helping either.
They didn't add Portal and TF2 to EP2 for nothing and made the fans buy
HL2 and EP1 all over again, instead of lowering the episodic price :(.

Other companies manage it and Valve did it two times as well. BTW, in the
interview from which I got the above info, I noticed the following:

ActionTrip: Do you think you can transition to next-gen with Source?

Gabe Newell: You know, theoretically, there might be a time where it's a
problem.

I guess he noticed the lighting/shadow issue in which Source is not up to
date. But so seems Unreal 3 and I'd take a creative game like Ep2 over a
correctly lit game like FEAR any day, but having both together would be
just too cool! Maybe if Valve licenses id Tech 5 for its new games :)!

What other companies have produced games with as much detail and
ambience? Bioshock is cool I admit. But ep2 sets standards higher again.

As for &quot;two times&quot; as well, do you have any recollection at all how late
both HL and HL2 were? I do. And they took a LONG time to produce. And
there is a shed load more &quot;interaction&quot; and &quot;clever&quot; moments in Ep2 than

I'd half agree with that.
I'm on my 8th run through and it's still fun (because of mods) but I
have run into quite a few bugs at times.

Yesterday's bug was in the wild territory;
I'd been through there before and rescued the doc and escorted him to
Yantar, but never got the swoopy camera and long radio spiel because I'd
taken a different route than the developers planned on me taking.

This led to me hitting that trigger point last night, days after
escorting the doc and approaching it from the other side, but there it
went, a minute+ long time of the camera swooping about with no text or
voice accompanying it since neither the doc, his buddies or the mercs
attacking them were there any more, but the moron devs didn't bother
checking for any of that before taking control of the view.

That kind of shortsightedness is all over the game and it's a good game
_in_spite_ of their development choices.

I like the game, I like the modability and such but I can only imagine
how buggy it was at launch if it's still like this after 4 patches.

Those bugs also drop the kind of score it deserves - I'd give it an 80,
maybe an 85 at best.

Something weird here.  If this game was buggy for me I'd pick another
game to wind up Werner with but I just don't see many of the bugs that
folk talk about in Stalker or for that matter in any of the other games
that get discussed (HL2, Bioshock, etc).

Have I accidentally made the most stable PC in the World or just dropped
lucky with the game software having a really nice relationship with
something on my hard-drive?

There were a few minor bugs in Stalker for me (I've finished a few
quests and then got them again on my list with no way of completing
them) but even from the first install (without patches) I played through
Stalker without any other problems.  Certainly nothing that would spoil
the game.

BTW - finished Portal and must be near the end of Ep2 so can you
recommend some good mods for Stalker?  Links would be good but I can
Google the mods myself if you don't have them handy

&gt;&gt; That kind of shortsightedness is all over the game and it's a good game
&gt;&gt; _in_spite_ of their development choices.

&gt;&gt; I like the game, I like the modability and such but I can only imagine
&gt;&gt; how buggy it was at launch if it's still like this after 4 patches.

&gt;&gt; Those bugs also drop the kind of score it deserves - I'd give it an 80,
&gt;&gt; maybe an 85 at best.

&gt;Something weird here.  If this game was buggy for me I'd pick another
&gt;game to wind up Werner with but I just don't see many of the bugs that
&gt;folk talk about in Stalker or for that matter in any of the other games
&gt;that get discussed (HL2, Bioshock, etc).
">

The bugs seem to be almost random and it really depends on what you've
done, where you walk, etc.
IE if you walk way over to the left or right when first going to
agropom, you can avoid seeing the cutscene that activates when you head
straight there.

One of the worst bugs I encounter quite a bit is empty stashes, and the
flip side of it (sort of) when you search bodies of enemies slain some
time ago (by you or others) that you have searched before then left the
zone and returned and suddenly getting new stash locations from them -
this should be impossible, but it's not.

">

Well, start here and grab anything that takes your fancy.
http://stalker.filefront.com/files/Stalker/Mods;3785

The specific ones I've downloaded are

40_sanex_alife_mo.rar - not used this one yet (supposed to give freedom
of movement to all the other &quot;living&quot; things in the game instead of
having them tied to one location, so for instance the military guys at
the south end of cordon could attack the bandits at the gate to garbage,
instead of just patrolling betwen their camp and part way to the newbie
camp)

7.62_vintorez_weapon_mod.rar - nor this one (adds a purhaseble vintorez
chambered in 7.62 instead of 9mil, magazine reduced to 5 rouneds)

advanced_world_weapons_v2.0.zip - this one is a reskin pack making the
weapons darker - looks nice

ammo_mod_v1.0.rar - not used this one yet - makes all stores carry all
ammo types as I recall

armour_decay_mod_v0.01.zip - stop armor from being damaged
colts_version_of_horror_mod_0.3.zip - not tried this

demoche_weapons_armorv1.zip - not tried it

endurancemod_v1.1.rar - changes the weight limits from 50/60 to 80/100

extended_loot_mod_0.3.zip - causes all stashes and critters to drop more
loot - specifically unique items and artifacts

Float32_4247_036a_RELEASE.zip - forget exactly what this was for

freestate_v1.3.zip - a total conversion that replaces artifacts with
various skill you could get - I could never get it to work - might be a
version mismatch

horrormod_alpha_0.4.rar - this one I mentioned before - changes the
trees, adds a lot more fog and rain - and of course melee zombies in the
cordon area.

nodegradeuniqueweapons.rar - kinda obvious what this does

no_head_bobbing.zip - ditto

no_time_limit_on_quests_v0.01.zip - ditto

reality_s.t.a.l.k.e.r._v_1.3.zip - makes things substantially harder by
making weapons more lethal and enemies more likely to headshot you -
also changes weapon names to their real life names

s.t.a.l.k.e.r._data_upacker.zip - obvious but never used
show_reward_v1.02.zip - shows the rewards you'll get for jobs when the
job is offered/assigned so you can avoid side jobs that aren't worth it

spidermod_v1.rar - silly mod that makes you able to jump vast distances
- I only snagged it to see where the modifications went to I could alter
jump height slightly to compensate for the lack of climbing (ie into the
backs of trucks - got sick of making 20+ tried to get in)

stalker_actor_modifier_2.1.0.zip - character editor - never used

stalker_modpack_by_heer0_v100.zip - a collection of mods (longer quest
times, increased carry, repair weapons/armor, show reward, real weapon
names,  and some other stuff)

stalker_mod_axerepair_100_forv10001_eng.rar - allows repair of
weapons/armor at stores (sid/bar/yantar)

stalker_uimod.zip - never used it, forget what it is

vog25_npmwpnades.zip - adds napalm and white phosphorus grenades -
seemed quite buggy - might be a version mismatch

VSSx4RF.zip - a calibrated sniper scope graphic with lines below the
center for longer ranges - I used it for a bit then took it out again
since I can estimate the drop myself without it and didn't like the
lines obscuring the sight picture

weather_overhaul_v101.zip -never used it

yojimbosexosuit.rar - a reskin of the exo-suit

I'm not sure if it's due to the horror mod or something else (or just
plain stalker) but I ran into a nasty bug 20 minutes ago.

Just done the wild territory lab, gone south then north to the
bartender.
Talk to the bartender and get the next mission and cash in a defend the
garage camp mission.
If I stopped there, no problem, but If I got another &quot;find the item&quot; job
for something I've already got and cash it in, 2/3rds of the bar goes
hostile instantly and opens fire - this is especially bad considering
the game disables your access to your weapons upon entering AND more
enemies charge into the bar from outside.

Now that's a major bug by anyone's standards.

It got even worse - when I had the documents from yantar I went in to
talk to the barkeep, at which point the all went hostile - every single
stalker in the game is hostile now - including the Guide (although you
still get the info you need after killing him.)

Getting to be a real pain turning the other cheek until Duty gives me
the Sniper VLA.

What a horrible bit of programming - any &quot;murderer&quot; gets in Duty
territory and they tell everyone to attack him, except that the player
gets flagged a murderer for killing anyone in Duty territory, even after
Duty tells everyone to attack.

So every time I hit town I have anywhere between 5 and 15+ stalkers
firing at me while Duty basically do nothing.

Even when multiple stalkers chase me into the Duty base the Duty guys
never manage to kill even one of them.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I'm not sure if it's due to the horror mod or something else (or just

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Just done the wild territory lab, gone south then north to the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; bartender.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Talk to the bartender and get the next mission and cash in a defend the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; garage camp mission.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If I stopped there, no problem, but If I got another &quot;find the item&quot; job
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; for something I've already got and cash it in, 2/3rds of the bar goes
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; hostile instantly and opens fire - this is especially bad considering
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the game disables your access to your weapons upon entering AND more
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; enemies charge into the bar from outside.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Now that's a major bug by anyone's standards.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Xocyll
&gt;&gt;&gt; Yep that's sounds pretty bad but I'm with Shawk on this in generally as
&gt;&gt;&gt; I can't say I really noticed what I called many bugs and none that
&gt;&gt;&gt; actually annoyed me or 'broke' the game. It seems that what people class
&gt;&gt;&gt; as real bugs varies a great deal. For me unless it pretty much stops me
&gt;&gt;&gt; playing the game I'm generally ok with it.

&gt;&gt; It got even worse - when I had the documents from yantar I went in to
&gt;&gt; talk to the barkeep, at which point the all went hostile - every single
&gt;&gt; stalker in the game is hostile now - including the Guide (although you
&gt;&gt; still get the info you need after killing him.)

&gt;&gt; Getting to be a real pain turning the other cheek until Duty gives me
&gt;&gt; the Sniper VLA.

&gt;&gt; What a horrible bit of programming - any &quot;murderer&quot; gets in Duty
&gt;&gt; territory and they tell everyone to attack him, except that the player
&gt;&gt; gets flagged a murderer for killing anyone in Duty territory, even after
&gt;&gt; Duty tells everyone to attack.

&gt;&gt; So every time I hit town I have anywhere between 5 and 15+ stalkers
&gt;&gt; firing at me while Duty basically do nothing.

&gt;&gt; Even when multiple stalkers chase me into the Duty base the Duty guys
&gt;&gt; never manage to kill even one of them.

&gt;Have you just been unlucky or is this a common thing?
">

The whole murderer thing is always like that - kill anyone in the Bar
zone and you get flagged - even when Duty tells everyone to hunt down
and kill a murderer and even when you're firing back in self defense
after having been attacked.

The whole Bar going hostile after you cash in a mission at the Barkeep -
that's happened for the first time in this game

Wouldn't be quite so bad if the devs hadn't put in that retarded &quot;no
weapons in the bar&quot; routine that only disables the player's weapons, not
the NPC weapons - talk about a glaring immersion breaker.

Ahh well, got my sniper VLA last night and then killed off all those
aggressive stalkers in the Bar zone - now I'm flagged murderer, but I
really don't care at this point.

&gt;&gt;&gt; SNIP

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Something weird here.  If this game was buggy for me I'd pick another
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; game to wind up Werner with but I just don't see many of the bugs that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; folk talk about in Stalker or for that matter in any of the other games
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that get discussed (HL2, Bioshock, etc).
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The bugs seem to be almost random and it really depends on what you've
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; done, where you walk, etc.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; IE if you walk way over to the left or right when first going to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; agropom, you can avoid seeing the cutscene that activates when you head
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; straight there.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I'll have a look but this one and the one below don't go down as very
&gt;&gt;&gt; serious bugs to me.  They're annoyances - not game breaking.  Perhaps
&gt;&gt;&gt; this is just a matter of perception then

&gt;&gt; Avoiding a cutscene isn't a bug, it's a bonus, having a cutscene
&gt;&gt; activate when the whole reason for it is gone is a major bug.

&gt;Avoiding it was the one you spoke about and I'd also see that as a
&gt;bonus.  I'd be peed about a cutscene with no reason but haven't seen
&gt;either yet
">

You can avoid the Agropom and WT cutscenes by going around, but the WT
one is still lurking there at it's trigger point to activate when you
pass through, long after what the cutscene is about is gone.

And of course the retarded Devs made them unskippable - like I NEED to
see the various cutscenes when I replay the game.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; One of the worst bugs I encounter quite a bit is empty stashes, and the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; flip side of it (sort of) when you search bodies of enemies slain some
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; time ago (by you or others) that you have searched before then left the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; zone and returned and suddenly getting new stash locations from them -
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; this should be impossible, but it's not.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Oh I do get those too.  Learned to only look for stashes that are on the
&gt;&gt;&gt; map to prevent disappointment

&gt;&gt; I'm an ammo scavenger so I search all bodies (and unload enemy weapons.)
&gt;&gt; What can I say, I consider less than 500 rounds as being low on ammo.

&gt;Lol, I do tend to pick up everyone's dropped weapons and unload them
&gt;before throwing them away again.  I like to keep mine around the 150
&gt;mark but with 3 guns that does give me around 450 rounds overall.
">

I gave up on the multiple guns thing after the second run through the
game, since carrying a pistol, shotgun and rifle really limits the
ammo/artifacts/meds you can also carry.
A good rifle to snipe with is all I really need.

The one exception to this rule is the endgame north of the scorcher
where I'll take additional weapons to fire off the accumulated grenades
and drop when the grenades are used up.

My first run through Pripyat I did snag a railgun, but since there's SFA
ammo for it I gave up in subsequent plays.

If the G37 could take a silencer I'd probably use it.

Even with an endurance mod that boost carry considerably, I'm still
always nudging the point of no-move - I just end up carrying even more
ammo - like 2-3k rounds.  I really hate running out of ammo.

Xocyll &lt;Xoc ... @kingston.net&gt; looked up from reading the entrails of the
porn spammer to utter  &quot;The Augury is good, the signs say:

And yet another (related) bug.

Since the bar episode when all stalkers went into hate mode it hasn't
been particularly annoying.
But now, going into pripyat, it turns out the &quot;veteran group of
stalkers&quot; you're supposed to join for the stroll through sniper alley
are also hostile.

No problem, kill them all and proceed.

Only their dialogs, calling out sniper positions and cheering when you
take down a sniper, are still playing, even though they're all dead long
before reaching the first sniper position.

I have little doubt that soon I'll get the radio message from the leader
of them telling me to trust my instincts once I get far enough away from
his corpse.

Yet another missed reality check by the devs.

This kind of mistake is why STALKER can't possibly get into the 90's on
a review and doesn't deserve to.  An 80 at best, even if it is GOTY.

Honestly, not checking to see if an npc is dead before sending a message
from him is 1st year programming level of stupidity.

Well I'm laughing here at this bug but yes, you are right.  Went through
Pripryat again myself last night and so I know exactly the dialogue
you're talking about.  Must have been really jarring.  I might try and
force the 'hostile bar' bug myself... just to see if I can.  Closest I
came to a bug in Pripryat was all the friendly NPC's standing with their
guns pointing in one direction but doing nothing else.  I'd gone on
ahead.  I came back and searched every window in the direction of their
rifle barrels until I found a sniper that wasn't sniping anyone.  One
headshot later and they're all eager to move on again.

I tried them all, but found them to be not terribly useful.

&gt;But seriously I do like one over my shoulder for that close-up work such

My main use was for dogpack attacks, but half the time they dodge

&gt;I don't really know why I carry so many other rifles other than I guess
&gt;I felt I had a better chance of finding ammo for at least one of them

&gt;Next time I'll look at the weight of additional ammo next to the weight
&gt;of a rifle and perhaps swap one for another.

I carried a lot early on then learned that it just wasn't too useful.
Once you hit the bartender you can but ammo for the unique fast firing
AK you get from strelok's stash and both the bartender and  freedom sell
5.56 and duty and yantar base sell 9x39.

I'm not above &quot;exploiting&quot; the fact that the stores are randomly loaded
when a game is loaded so quicksave + quickload = more ammo instantly
available.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;I've picked up grenade launchers and launcher extensions to guns I'm
&gt;carrying but tend to sell these and the grenades.  I use grenades a lot
&gt;but only the one's I throw myself.  This is because I too am usually
&gt;pushing the limit on weight (no mods - just endurance artifacts and
&gt;armour with weight gains).

I generally save rifle grenades for the endgame.
Just ran through there last night and took the bullpup along - made the
stroll through the reactor external area much easier;  bad guy pops up,
bad guy gets grenade in the face.  Plus you can shoot down the
helicopters if you get lucky (damn hard to hit.)
Once the grenades are gone I just drop the launch and move on (previous
times I used a Tunder, which I could still use after since I tend to go
with the 9x39 ammo and weapons (sniper VLA ftw!)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;I've only run out of ammo once, on return from a pretty hard couple of
&gt;hours collecting loot and completing tasks I needed to get through a
&gt;hostile checkpoint and went against 4 soldiers with only a handgun to
&gt;start with.  Lured the first one out from his friends and behind a burnt
&gt;out truck so that I could drop him with a headshot and be protected by
&gt;the truck while I stole his rifle and the few rounds he had and then
&gt;took the others out with headshots too.  Hell of a sense of
&gt;accomplishment with something like that!  I tend to fin I'm in more
&gt;danger from packs of dogs with low ammo than the human opponents
">

Sounds like the railway checkpoint in the beginning area.
I tended to do something similar - getting up on the railway itself and
sniping down at them with a silenced pistol - tends to use a lot of
ammo, but it eventually kills them (the ones that climb up get nailed
with the double-barrel shottie.)

Starting my 8th, 9th? run through now using heeros mod again - this time
I'm going to try and join Duty and see if that will let me do their
missions sooner (instead of post Yantar) and this get the Sniper VLA
sooner.

I hear you about the dogs - I had what seemed to be a double pack hit me
once - at least 20 dogs - I was dead before I could hit the medkit
hotkey.
Exosuits are great for them since they have a high base rupture
resistance (70 I think) and with the right artifacts (goldfish,
kolosomething, you can get it up to 90 easy - even the jumper guys and
bloodsucker don't hurt much at those levels.
