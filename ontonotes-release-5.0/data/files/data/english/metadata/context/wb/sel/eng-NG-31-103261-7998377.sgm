while it may not be very apparent as of yet, most of what has been
written about regarding panoptic observation directly relates to
issues surrounding 'art'. it is proposed that dynamics such as skew
and Â thresholds are aspects which are mediated when this 'greater
truth' is shared between peoples, via the 'shared truth' of an
artwork, which may vary given proportions of skew versus neutral
accounting. or so it is proposed.

and of this initial overview of how these relations begin to be
established via 'art', it is proposed that it involves the most basic
relations of this self-with-self condition of being and existence...

the above diagram is meant to be a crude sketch which will be further
explored in the next posts, yet it is this fundamental condition of
the individual self and its looping circuitry, and also how this
could be related to a boundary condition (threshold), that is
proposed that 'art' mediates, in some way.

whether this is a self-with-self dialogue or issues of consciousness
and how this is shared beyond the self, or whatnot. that this is part
of the domain in which the 'truth' of artwork is grounded in the
given observer ('artist') who then mediates or shares this truth (T)
with others, via the artwork.

so this could also involve issues of internal/external boundaries,
and the short-circuiting or imbalance of this circuitry of self, as
it is mediated or revealed or explored within artworks, etc.

likewise, through 'art' it is proposed that the most basic situation
of this 'shared truth' of art implies an 'other' which co-exists in
this realm of the initial observer ('artist') who _relates to this
artwork/artist, in some way, through the artwork. this would
seemingly indicate that 'art' would be able to exist beyond just the
individual 'self' (artist) in terms of an _internal threshold, and
move beyond this into _external relations, which is somewhat
ambiguous if considering this could be a range of shared experience
-- which when panoptically accounted for could tend towards &quot;shared
skew&quot; with more minor or majority 'truth', given how this situation
is mediated in terms of protected subsets of 'universal' ~perspective.

in any case this is to then assume that grounded art can move beyond
this individual (self-with-self) and enter into another's ('other')
context of self-with-self relations, via this medium of the artwork.
in other words, the artwork begins to function as an intermediary
between this self-with-other relation, and this will be further
explored in that this relation between the observer (painter) and
artwork (say, painting) could then be considered in similar terms of
self-with-self and self-with-other relations, in which this artwork
takes on a life or identity of its own, via this relativistic and
empirical framework.

it is too complex a point to delve into immediately yet it will be
referenced again in which the basic model of relations between two
people can then be evaluated in terms whereby an artwork stands
between them, mediating this relation; and how this artwork and its
'truth' can function in what may be somewhat autonomous terms, even;
the artwork in relation to itself, as it is panoptically mediated.

thus, the above diagram is meant to allude to the idea that this self-
with-other relation between two persons or observers then, with
'art', will become more complex via having an artwork mediate this
relation, which then will move into issues of core/peripheral
relations functioning in these dynamics.

so it is to propose that an artwork which is grounded in a 'shared
truth' can still complete this circuit between the self-and-other,
yet this is mediated via artwork, itself, which can have its own self-
with-self relation. so, this is going to become more complex, yet
hopefully also more clear in the process.

and the remaining part of the tripartite self/other/environment
relation is then how the individual if not the group or self/other,
may exist in the larger panoptic environment, and mediate this as a
condition. such that, the very condition of being and existence can
be established, and then, what next? what is this environment, what
does it mean, why are we here, - etc. what do you see, how do you
see, what are the patterns, what are the frameworks, etc. ideas,
landscapes, dynamics, patterns.

whatever it may be considered to be, it is proposed this issue of
'environment' is different than this self-with-self and self-with-
other relation, in some fundamental way. and this is because there is
so much that is not-human or beyond this particular threshold,
including a variety of ways of existence (being), that may not
directly map into the same framework as humans or even other
lifeforms. or, maybe more accurately, that there may be gaps in these
relations, gaps in awareness, in knowledge, which then can be
mediated by the 'truth' of artwork, which then could explore various
dimensions of this condition. this situation, of being in the cosmos,
a seemingly finite speck in an infinite expanse.

in any case, this is to then review a basic preconception mentioned
previously in which it could be 'believed' that the artist then is
producing this 'art' (truth) via the artwork, by default; as an act
of the mode of cultural production, even. and this was thoroughly
looked into, as to why it is more complex...

and thus, this idea of the relation between 'the artist' and
'artwork' is more than an act of will, alone. or so it is proposed.
in that, this is not necessarily only a one-way conveyance of a
viewpoint or given relativistic framework which defaults into 'shared
truth', and exists in a work (as 'art'), in which this is necessarily
conveying some inherent 'truth' via this interaction. that is, unless
it is actually occurring.

and to what degree this could occur may vary depending on how this
observer relates to their own self, and how they relate to the medium
of the work, say...

thus, it is proposed that this relation between the 'artist' and the
'artwork' is more complex and also is functioning beyond the
individual, in which this relation with the (other) medium must be
established, in which to ground this relation (between the painter
and painting, say, in a shared truth). this same aspect was mentioned
earlier with regard to how a canvas may influence a way of painting,
or how a type of stone may help determine what may be carved or
chiseled from its mass, given its dynamics. and that this is also a
reciprocal feedback process, of learning, discovery, which does not
all originate within the artist themselves and exist external and
beyond just an individual limit of this relation (thus, the oil
painting of an artist also exists in relation to all oil painting,
via larger panoptic review, etc).

so, to try to establish a basis for moving into more complex models
of the functioning in the relations involved in 'art', as it relates
to this issue of the observer-observed mediated by many peoples, it
is to then examine the basic scenario for relating via the artwork...

it is proposed that this is no longer a relation whereby someone
simply produces a work of 'art' via a type of will-to-
cultural.production, which then is sent one-way via this producer to
the consumer...

that is, this is not simply an issue where an artwork is jettisoned
from the protective subset of 'the artist' and exists as 'art' by
default (empirically, in terms of grounded truth) and then must be
mediated in this condition by passive observers, who must submit to
hierarchical relation, in which to not question this presumption to
'shared knowing', when this may not be shared nor of great insight,
in terms of claiming (!) agency of 'art' yet functioning towards a
'commercialized' consciousness, say, of 'culture, inc' or 'reality,
inc' which this artwork then may be representative of; the protected
subset.

thus, the critic or critical observer may interrogate this claim (!)
of 'art' in itself, as 'art' per se ('truth'), and then delve into
the issues of dimensionality in terms of shared and unshared
frameworks, and of assumptions, grounded and ungrounded, as the work
relates or ceases to, to 'the other' (this POV).

and such an interaction or relation can take place beyond the
producer, or 'artist', of this work, via the work itself, (which
speaks for itself, in various ways, with greater/less insight). and
it is proposed that this is one of the most fundamental aspects of
relation, which then can help establish and define the relations
between peoples (observers) in terms of set/subset relations, in
terms of hierarchy, skew, thresholds, boundaries, biasing, shared
values, -- via this potentially external mediation of relations
beyond this self-with-self framework of the protected viewpoint of
self. and this relationship can open up relations with others and
environment, if it were successfully grounded in a shared view or model.

in a sense it would seem this is the litmus test of &quot;good&quot; if not
&quot;great&quot; 'art', in which what is going on in these relations begins to
scale to larger issues of awareness, consciousness, values, insight,
etc. and that much of this involves patterns, recognizing patterns
and movements and flows and relations and organization as it maps
into self-with-self modeling. and that this can begin in emotions,
feeling, sensory impulses, and move further into symbolization, into
language, from a type of shared sense (resonance, say) which then
becomes structural in terms of logical evaluation, and reasoning.
such that sound and color and movement and various other dimensions
begin to build up models of reality in which people (observers) may
begin to relate in terms of co-existence, or shared set relationships.

in this way, it is proposed that this 'artwork' then is functioning
implicitly in terms of a foundational truth (T) which is the basis
for empirical relations, yet which is mediated in this relativistic
context of individual observers who then begin communicating and
sharing their perspectives, across and within this environment,
between self-and-others.

in any case, even further it would be to then begin to test and
construct models of awareness, and a basis for given frameworks, in
which the encyclopedia of given existence and being could begin to be
explored via this approach, which may be a basic skill of human
relations, necessary for establishing grounded communication in a
shared truth, yet somehow lost through an ideological division-of-
labor in which this grounding of experience becomes 'virtual'
instead, a realm of information circuitry alone. as if the claim
alone (!) establishes this 'shared truth', rather than the larger
panoptic review and its grounding, via shared facts, truth, logic,
reasoning. as it relates to making sense (shared sense) and not that
this can be assumed inherent, especially when this could be sharing
of skew instead, which then could be sharing of false views, etc.

the underlying aspect of these dynamics is proposed to be aesthetics,
as in aesthetic knowledge that relates in general and specifically to
design as it may be modeled to exist in a particular valuation (of
'shared truth') and also, a type of basis for culture, to be built
and developed upon this foundation.

in any case, it would seem that a lot about 'artwork' then can tell
us about ourselves, in which 'ways of seeing' relate to 'ways of
being', and that this can begin to be observed via the cultural
artifacts and which could carry or sustain certain awareness or
understanding, via artworks or ideas which are explored in this way.
and it is to propose that whatever may be going on in a given case,
that it also tells something about this self-with-self relation, in
terms of dimensional frameworks and how people relate to their selves
and to others, via these artifacts (of relation). a type of tree-ring
dating of the emotional world of humans, say, by what themes or
approaches may emerge in this process.

yet, so much of this today seems contained to 'certain' subset
viewpoint based in institutional control over these larger questions
(self/other/environment) and it is curious to what degree this is
actually 'art' in the sense of grounded truth about this shared
awareness, or if this incorporation of 'art' and 'culture' into this
privatized subset is actually suffocating this consciousness, to only
certain views, in which the 'values' reflected become those of an
automated machinery, say, and its value-system...

which could become that of profit or money or power or control or
whatnot. yet, further, which could also exist in terms of 'partial
truth' of skew; and in this way, instead of this 'art' reaching into
ground, it may do so only in limited ways, via thresholds, via
biasing, etc. yet also, importantly, via pseudo-truth which assumes
itself and functions as if 'truth' itself, when it is ideologically
incapable of engaging this larger truth beyond its protected self-
with-self boundary.

in any case, the mass media can project 1-way views of what is
important and of significance, about 'artwork' which can push culture
and push ideas of 'art' which are supposed to be meaningful, if not
moving or intellectually stimulating or whatnot. yet, are they
really? or is this just a sustained illusion? and where might these
larger checks and balances come into play if the system cannot allow
for it, for this critical self-examination of skew, bias, distortion,
and warping which functions against larger review, etc. it would seem
this is all part of 'art' today. the very interrogation of the
interrogation, as it is bound to certain dynamics. yet what if this
is largely peripheral to the larger shared truth, beyond these
problems of communication, which is core and shared and beyond given
relativistic viewpoints? what if 'art' is bigger than museums,
institutions, schools, and it is more central to the basic human
condition than has been allowed in the existing scenarios -- and
that, instead, this is what needs to be reestablished in self-with-
self relations, so as to begin to establish more robust relations
with others and the environment -- this ability to be self-aware, to
experiment, to develop skill, to communicate, to use and explore
language, symbols, patterning, etc. the wholistic mediation of
existence, versus its particularization and fracturing -- the weaving
together of the self (others, environment) versus only the cutting,
tearing, ripping apart in the quest to declare (!) reality, truth,
for a relativistic perspective.

it is proposed 'art' is not necessarily something 'other there' done
by other people which then is hung up in a museum like holy objects,
as if carrying 'great truths' when this may not always be the case,
and instead, that this begins in the person and within the
recognition of truth and self-relation, which this artwork then can
help mediate and even transcend via bridging this isolated unique
being of an individual, with others and the environment -- as a type
of first step into the world of cosmic mystery and the great fortune
of both knowing and unknowing -- and learning to navigate within
these realms.

these posts are never going to be able to voice what is held in the
heart, grounded in individual and common awareness which is sustained
within 'artists' of many/all persuasions, about this 'shared truth'
which goes beyond categorization -- yet, it is an attempt to convey
that this 'art' is actually a way of knowing and sharing and being,
'in truth', and establishing this truth, and sustaining and building
it for others. as a type of testament, even. then, to consider what
may be classified or called 'art' which could be functioning against
this truth, turned away from this awareness, or only minor in
comparison to shared skewing is also testament to this
institutionalization of 'art' into an ideology, in which this artwork
can begin to function against this greater truth, via its value as
money/power, etc. versus truth, as the highest value. the value by
which these relations are mediated and established. versus pseudo-
truth, whereby this truth can be contained, controlled, manipulated,
and detourned for other agendas, which function against this greater
awareness, as a type of anti-aesthetic, of noise.

in any case, an attempt will be made to prepare a basic framework for
evaluating this idea of 'art' in the context of artifacts (i.e.
artworks), and several examples will be given. this is not simply an
either-or scenario whereby what is going on today is entirely wrong
in its every aspect. it is instead to try to make the point that with
relativistic ideology and binary one-sided reasoning, everyone can be
facing in 'other' directions, via difference, and overall this adds
up to nothing greater than the individual star who shines brightly
for 15 seconds and then fades, versus long-standing constellations
which are a part of a larger and more elaborate awareness, built of
shared frameworks of knowledge, not only of the most superficial
observations -- yet also of the deepest awareness and most resonating
of truths which can be captured by human imaginations, and reveal
these mysteries as a path to develop by. as a type of morality,
grounding in this truth and its observation and deference to it. not
the egotistic presumption of this knowing -- the absolute humility
that this is largely lost, in such a depraved era. that these
relations are ungrounded, skewed, unfair, unjust -- that this is not
utopia by any means -- except for fools, and those who buy-into the
protected frameworks. what will it take to make power and money and
people serve this truth, firstly? and to respect and balance with it,
rather than to try to control it towards given ends, yet by acting
against this greater awareness -- yet in total ignorance.

it is proposed the truth of 'art' is central to this process, and key
to opening up these dynamics to the light that is shared between
people, versus the darkness that is shared in the peripheral
connections in which this is proposed 'truth' when instead,
functioning against it, via skew, if not lesser knowing. it is to
question why this condition exists, within ourselves, and to break it
open, to interrogate this self-with-self and self-with-other dynamics
and how we exist in the environment, in which these dynamics then
become this 'consciousness' which is largely devoid of shared
grounding in an empirical reality. and it is by the truth of those
who observe these events, and how it is grounded in their frameworks,
and how they can understand and relate to this truth within
themselves, via what dimensions and what circuitry/relations, that
this then can begin to be clarifies, organization, related to and
through, with the self yet also with others -- to say 'this exists'
-- this is how i am observing this event -- and it is not only a
surface representation, it can become an interpretation that goes
deep into this knowing and awareness and insight, grounding in a
particular truth yet which _is universal, grounded, 'true'. that is,
beyond the self, external, which may clarify, if not bring judgement
upon this condition, to not only represent, but to illuminate the
situation, the scenario, via enlightened awareness, reasoning.

thus, the posts which follow will try to setup a scenario for
evaluating such possibilities as inherent in the present frameworks
of people, should they become grounded and the basis for relating in
this shared truth, via a neutral and balanced observation, versus
shared skew which acts against this.
