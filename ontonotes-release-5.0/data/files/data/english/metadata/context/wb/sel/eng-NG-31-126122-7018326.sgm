THE FINAL KANTDOWN - PART 4

WHAT HAPPENED TO THE HARE KRISHNA MOVEMENT?

The Founder and Guru, His Divine Grace A C Bhaktivedanta Swami
Prabhupada, arriving in the West from India in 1965 who founded the
famous Hare Krishna Movement has been poisoned physically and
spiritually since November 14 1977 by usurpers (trisexuals) within the
Movement.  The World and India are without his guidance as a result.
In 1977, the Founder wanted the American and European "K" alphabet
shape changed because the shape symbolises suicides according to
ancient scriptures however the shape has not been made non-suicidal by
the usurpers (trisexuals).  The Founder's books and philosophy have
been changed by the usurpers (trisexuals).  This posting reflects on
this  continued poisoning and sees evil, suicidal and demoniac changes
happening around the World and  his birth country India.   Below are
various stories as a result of this.....

The days have elapsed since the usurpers in the Hare Krishna Movement
removed the Hare Krishna Founder:  His Divine Grace A C Bhaktivedanta
Swami Prabhupada, from spiritually being the initiating spiritual
master are:

EMERGING INDIA/Social change started with on-screen kiss

The Yomiuri Shimbun

The following is the fourth installment in a series of articles
reporting on new developments in India, which celebrates the 60th
anniversary of its independence this year, and where the nation is
heading.

Yomiuri Shimbun Asian General Bureau

Actress Mallika Sherawat has emerged as one of India's top film stars
after starring in the 2004 film "Murder," in which she performed
"daring" kissing scenes and other sensational scenes--explicit
portrayals that could not be found in Indian movies prior to that
time.

With a slim figure and bright smile, the 25-year-old could capitalize
on her beauty to sustain her popularity. However, she is not satisfied
with this alone and is proud of taking a prominent stand to lead a new
India.

"Murder," a suspense film about a woman involved in an extramarital
affair, caused much controversy across the country when the film was
released.

Sherawat's father, a landlord in Hariyana State, a conservative
agricultural area in the northern part of the country, has not spoken
to Sherawat since her film debut in 2002.

However, Sherawat remains undaunted. She says she is supported by
India's younger generation, who have had their eyes opened to the
world via the Internet and satellite TV, adding that they are
different from the hypocritical older generation.

Indian movies are called "Bollywood movies," as Bombay, now Mumbai,
has been compared to Hollywood. In the commercial city of Mumbai,
movie studios are everywhere.

Indian movies have followed an established pattern for decades: Lovers
are finally joined together after overcoming differences in family
lineage and social positions, and family bonds are respected. In many
movies, song-and-dance routines are crammed in, even if they bear no
relation to the scenes that precede or follow them.

This is because the movies have to be entertaining and have a broad
appeal in the country. Kissing and sexual scenes have long been taboo
with audiences due to social conventions.

Over the past few years, however, new, experimental movies such as
"Murder" have become more prevalent.

Shradha Sukumaran, a film critic who writes for local papers, said
that the number of movies with fewer song-and-dance scenes and a
stronger emphasis on the storyline had increased.

After India liberalized its economy in the 1990s, foreign film
releases, especially Hollywood movies, increased in the country.

Such a new trend for Indian movies is supported by those aged 35 years
old and younger, who make up about 70 percent of the population of
1.11 billion (2006 estimate). Most of them grew up in the 1990s during
the high economic growth period associated with the Internet, mobile
phones and cable TV.

Since the country is a rare example of a society dominated by young
people, movie makers have focused on "strategies toward young people."

In 2006, various public relations events that utilized digital media
such as the Internet, as well as advertisements through corporate
tie-ups, proved successful and major hit movies were released in quick
succession, making it the "greatest year" in the history of Bollywood.

The movie world in India has started to reflect changes in the
country--urbanization, the spread of the nuclear family and
advancement of information technology.

One reason behind the growth in status of Indian movies in recent
years is the high level of animation and visual effects using
computers, reflecting the country's IT strength.

Rhythm & Hues, a special effects and animation studio based in Los
Angeles, established an overseas subsidiary in Mumbai in 2001 to meet
increasing demand.

Special effects depicting vivid backdrops in "The Chronicle of Narnia:
The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe" and "Superman Returns," both
released in Japan last year, were produced at the Mumbai studios.

In a dimly lit workshop covering about 30,000 square meters, animators
busily but silently shuffle 200 computer mice.

According to Saraswathi Balgam, director at Rhythm and Hues India, the
parent company first looked at Australia and Canada as locations for
setting up a subsidiary, but Mumbai was finally selected for its
moviemaking tradition and abundant human resources.

Toonz Animation India is an animation production firm based in
Thiruvananthapuram, formerly known as Trivandrum, the capital of
southern Kerala State, about 1,200 kilometers from Mumbai.

The company announced in December it will produce the animated movie
"Dragonlance" with Paramount Home Entertainment and Commotion
Pictures. Voice actors for the film include Kiefer Sutherland, the
leading actor in the popular U.S. TV series "24."

Toonz Animation India Chief Executive Officer P. Jayakumar said, "This
is an incredible opportunity to create an exciting film with global
appeal and iconic characters."

Jayakumar also places an emphasis on swashbuckling films for domestic
audiences, such as one in which the Hindu divine monkey Hanuman is the
hero.

India itself is a large market with 300 million children aged 12 years
old and younger, said Jayakumar.

In addition, the purchasing power of ethnic Indian residents now
living in areas from East Africa and the Middle East to Southeast Asia
has been increasing. The sheer demand for children's entertainment is
almost immeasurable.

"If we let our guard down, they may surpass us," a concerned senior
executive of a major Japanese animation firm said.

However, while Bollywood has been increasing its international
profile, many critics point out its Achilles' heel--a lack of
storylines. Among hit Bollywood movies are many films that blatantly
copy Hollywood movies.

Mahesh Bhatt, who directed and produced "Murder," said Bollywood has
focused too much on entertainment at the expense of depictions of
Indian history or social problems.

"There's no denying that Bollywood...has become an identity that is
linked to India and rising aspirations of the Indian people," he said,
before adding that, unlike films from South Korea and China, Bollywood
had failed to make inroads into markets dominated by Western movies.

Bhatt said he was strongly influenced by British cinema giant David
Lean, who is known for directing "Dr. Zhivago."

Bhatt's new film was inspired by the 2005 terrorist attacks in London.
It depicts the life of a young Indian Muslim living in Britain who
joins a terrorist organization and his awareness of tolerance that
saves him.

Bhatt's efforts to create real Indian stories on the big screen will
continue.

EMERGING INDIA / 400 mil. in middle-income bracket

The Yomiuri Shimbun

Japanese cars are sold at this modern shopping mall that recently
opened in a suburb of New Delhi.

The following is the second installment in a series of articles
reporting on new developments in India, which celebrates the 60th
anniversary of its independence this year, and where that nation is
heading. High levels of economic growth are changing the country, once
referred to as a "giant sleeping elephant," to an emerging global
power.

Anand, a 33-year-old strategic consultant for a client company at a
foreign-affiliated information technology company, and Anjali, a
23-year-old student trying to get a master's degree in business
administration, married three years ago after they met on a
matchmaking Web site. They now live in a quiet residential area in
southern New Delhi.

In India, it remains a common custom for parents to choose marriage
partners for their children, but couples like Anand and Anjali have
been gradually becoming more common, mainly in urban areas.

Anand earns 800,000 rupees (about 2.08 million yen; 1 rupee is about
2.6 yen) a year. Since people earning 40,000 rupees to 180,000 rupees
a year are considered to be in the middle-income bracket in India, he
can be called a high-income earner.

The couple is interested in buying a fridge and a washing machine.

"We got an opportunity," said Anjali. "We're concerned with the
quality rather than the price [of appliances]."

Recently, household electrical appliances have been selling in huge
numbers in the country.

In fiscal 2004, India produced 9 million color television sets, 3.9
million refrigerators and 1.6 million washing machines--an increase of
more than 10 percent from the previous year.

Strong sellers are 21- to 25-inch flat-screen television sets priced
at between 22,000 rupees to 30,000 rupees.

As for mobile phones, about 5 million people become new users every
month in the country. The total number of cell phone users reached 130
million in September.

According to an estimate by the Indian Communications and Information
Technology Ministry, the number is likely to reach 500 million, nearly
half of the country's population, by 2010.

Santosh Desai, 43, president of the major advertising company McCann
Erickson India, said he believes there are at least 400 million people
in the middle-income bracket in India, a figure exceeding the
population of the United States.

These middle-class people are playing the leading role in India's
consumer market, which is now the center of attention in the business
world.

According to Desai, until a while ago, 20 million people, the number
equivalent to Australia's population, are said to have joined India's
middle-income bracket every year. But he said that the figure has
recently increased to 60 million, close to the population of France.

Indians who used to ride bicycles have now switched to motorcycles and
then compact cars. In major cities, large, sophisticated shopping
malls are being opened one after another.

The diversification of payment methods, including credit cards,
banking institutions and loan systems offered by each consumer
electronics maker is boosting consumer spending in India.

"In recent times, ICICI Bank has shown a two-time increase in the loan
to consumer," said Ashwini Kumar, a sales executive with the major
bank in New Delhi.

India was once described as a country where the gap between the rich
and the poor was so wide that there was no middle class.

At present, the poor, who live mainly in rural areas, account for more
than 30 percent of India's population and are often left close to
death from starvation. Saving the poor is a big responsibility for the
government.

However, it also is true that the number middle-income bracket
families is increasing sharply due to the country's economic growth,
creating a gigantic consumer society. They are about to change India's
image.

Desai said that Indians can believe now for the first time in history
that their life will be better tomorrow than it is today.

His words reflect the dynamism India has today.

The growing middle-income bracket is heating up the consumption spree
in India. But the Indian government faces difficult challenges in
improving living standards for the poor, who have not benefited from
the nation's economic growth, and in narrowing the wealth gap in its
society.

There is a popular waterfront disco in the coastal city of Mumbai,
India's largest commercial city, in Maharashtra State in the western
part of the country.

Behind a metal detector and a heavy door, about 50 men and women dance
under glimmering lights.

Tanvi Gandhi, 27, an employee of a television station in Mumbai, said
she came to the disco at least once every two weeks.

Gandhi said that she did not know where else to spend her money
because she and her friends could spend twice as much money as they
had before since cable TV stations and call centers were opened there.

But the situation is dramatically different in the village of Sunna,
about 900 kilometers east of Mumbai. The village of about 1,000
residents is located in the middle of vast cotton fields.

Vijai, a 53-year-old farmer in the village mourned the death of his
26-year-old son, Ravi.

"We don't know any proper plan in mind," Vijai said with tear-filled
eyes. "How can we do? I am in too much shock to offer any future plans
for my family."

Ravi had committed suicide three days earlier by hanging himself from
an electricity pole in a cotton field.

The family had debts of 250,000 rupees (about 650,000 yen) to banks
and other lenders due to a poor harvest. Ravi had been very worried
that his family would not be able to pay for his sister's marriage
expenditures as her wedding date was approaching.

"My son didn't drink or smoke. He just worked hard for my family. He
was pressed by his sense of responsibility how to do for a living as
as householder," the father said.

Ravi and his wife lived in a small room with a black-and-white TV set
they bought 10 years ago. But the local electric power company had cut
off electricity supply to the whole village as many residents had
often failed to pay bills.

In the Vidarbha region where Sunna is located, about 3 million people
work in cotton farming. And in the same region, 1,140 people committed
suicide between June 2005 and November 2006.

Vidarbha People's Movement Society, a nongovernmental organization
supporting poor cotton farmers in the region, made a map on which
small skull illustrations marked places where suicides occurred. Soon
the whole of the map was covered with the marks.

Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh visited the Vidarbha region
having taken the news of a "suicide village" seriously, and announced
an emergency aid package including financial assistance for the coming
five years.

In late November, Agriculture Minister Sharad Pawar emphasized the
effects of the aid saying, "The emerging trends in respect of this
region indicates that the number of suicide by farmers due to
agriculture-related causes is on the decline."

However, Kishor Tiwari, 51, secretary of the NGO, said that three
people per day had still committed suicide even after the prime
minister's visit.

"The government said a fraud," he said angrily.

Mumbai and other big cities in India are in the midst of an
unprecedented feverish wave of consumption. But for farmers living in
the region, the prosperity is, according to one rural resident, a
world "not relevant to us. This is only for rich men and bureaucrats."

In the country's general election in 2004, the ruling coalition led by
the Indian People's Party (BJP) suffered an unpredicted major setback
despite a slogan of "Shining India" praising the recent economic
growth.

It was because those in poverty and other socially vulnerable people
interpreted the coalition's policy of prioritizing economic growth as
neglecting the weak.

The current governing coalition led by the Indian National Congress
Party insists that consideration should be given to "another India,"
where many people have no access to the benefits of economic growth.

Sonia Gandhi, president of the party, has said that the country is now
walking a tightrope between prosperity and achieving social justice.

Singh, an economist, said that the coming 15 to 20 years will be the
key, because the number of people in poverty can be reduced
drastically if the economy grows 8 percent to 10 percent every year
during the period.

Conversely, India now has no other measure to save the poor than
continuing to pursue more economic growth to enlarge shares of
prosperity.

Melting glaciers, sinking isles: Warming hits India

By Nita Bhalla

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - With India's Himalayan glaciers melting, its
eastern islands sinking and freak rain flooding deserts,
environmentalists say global warming is already taking its toll on
this populous Asian nation.

The U.N. climate panel issued its strongest warning yet on Friday that
human activities are heating the planet, forecasting that temperatures
would rise by between 1.8 and 4.0 Celsius (3.2 and 7.8 Fahrenheit) in
the 21st century.

In India, the signs already back up forecasts that as the mercury
rises the Indian subcontinent, home to one-sixth of humanity, will be
one of the worst-affected regions.

"We are already seeing glaciers are receding at a faster rate and
islands have disappeared and then there is all this freak weather
phenomena," said Shruti Shukla, climate change officer for WWF India.

Experts say the melting of Himalayan glaciers could have serious
consequences as more than 500 million residents -- almost half of
India's total population -- of the Indus, Ganges and Brahmaputra river
basins rely on them for water supply.

Research about the Gangotri glacier -- which feeds the Ganges -- has
found the average rate of retreat has almost doubled to 34 meters (110
ft) per year compared to 19 meters in 1971.

"Glaciers are like a frozen reservoir of water, so when glaciers
recede ... proportionally, there will be a decrease in the water,
which affects drinking water supply, irrigation, hydropower," said
glaciologist Jagdish Bahadur.

This is likely to exacerbate already widespread water shortages.

VANISHING ISLANDS, DESERT SEAS

Rising temperatures will also hurt the annual June-September monsoon
rains, which India is heavily dependent on for its crops.

It is estimated that a temperature rise of between 2 and 3.5 Celsius
would result in a loss of between 9 and 25 percent of revenue from
agriculture -- which makes up 22 percent of India's GDP and employs 70
percent of the workforce.

Besides, researchers say rising temperatures will mean vector-borne
diseases such as malaria and dengue fever will spread to higher
altitudes known for being free of mosquitoes.

In the Sunderbans, off India's east coast, scientists say two of the
104 islands have disappeared over the past decade partially due to
rising sea levels.

"Both islands were inhabited and thousands of people were forced to
relocate to some of the other islands," said Sugata Hazra, who teaches
oceanography at Jadhavpur University in eastern India, adding that 12
more islands were vulnerable.

In western India, freak torrential rains flooded the desert state of
Rajasthan, displacing hundreds of thousands and killing 140 people
last year.

Barmer district in the state recorded 58 cm (23 inches) of rainfall in
just three days -- more than double the average it usually receives
for the entire year.

While India is not required under the Kyoto Protocol to reduce its
energy consumption and cut greenhouse gas emissions at this stage,
experts say its emissions are rising and could make it a significant
contributor to global warming.

"Clean technologies exist and the government should come out with an
immediate policy and implementation framework to address the issue of
energy for all while reducing carbon dioxide emission," said K.
Srinivas of Greenpeace.
