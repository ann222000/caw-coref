Editorial

This is the first edition of “COSATU Media Monitor” (CMM) - an upgrade of
the longstanding COSATU Daily Labour News. The main intention of the new
design has been to create a clear distinction between it and “COSATU Today”
(CT). The latter carries our own media releases. CMM carries “newsclips”
from the bourgeois mass media, whether friendly or not, on questions of
interest to the working class.

CMM will carry articles in full whenever possible. The logo of the source
will be given, hyperlinked to the original article on the Internet. Click on
a logo to find the original article reproduced or quoted next to that logo.
Every effort has been made to accommodate the wishes of subscribers. Further
changes will be made if necessary, as we feel our way forward.

Articles will be quoted here which are the product of media releases that
have already been transmitted in the CT. This is the first monitoring
function of CMM. It should be possible for subscribers to get a measure of
the distance between the labour movement’s point of view, and its
presentation by the mass media - hence the micrometer logo of CMM.

Other articles will be included for their news value. Therefore CMM will not
be “hard linked” to the CT. Many hardcopy newspapers, web sites, radio and
television outlets will all be monitored.

This launch coincides with the first appearance of advertising in CT or CMM,
limited to five small ads on the front page, linked to Internet pages. These
will help cover the cost of producing the two publications, but will not be
permitted to seriously intrude on the space or the overall content.

=buss&amp;ArticleID=1518-1786_2139540&gt; 1.1 'We will shut SA down'

Magdel Fourie, Fin24, 1 July 2007
Johannesburg - Eskom workers have threatened to plunge South Africa into
darkness and extreme cold for 24 hours in the coming week.

At least 25 000 members of three labour unions want to down tools
countrywide because of a wage dispute with the state power utility.

Paris Mashego, a negotiator of the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM), said
they are planning a daylong strike from Thursday 23:00 to Friday 23:00,
where all Eskom workers belonging to NUM, Solidarity and the National Union
of Metalworkers (Numsa) will participate.

He warned that the industrial action could spark huge outages because union
members operate most of the country's power stations.

Meanwhile, André Damons reports that winter temperatures could drop as low
as 3°C in Gauteng, with the mercury not expected to go higher than 16°C.
Eskom already experienced record demand for electricity during a recent
snowfall.

Mashego said the unions plan to march to the ministry of minerals and energy
in Pretoria on Friday.

The month-long wage dispute between Eskom and the unions reached a critical
point on Wednesday when Eskom apparently attended the wage talks without a
mandate.

Police and security guards apparently used teargas to disperse angry Eskom
workers who protested against Eskom's refusal to budge from its 6% offer.
The unions demand a wage increase of 12%.

The Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA) is
currently considering the issue of crucial services. This is to determine
which employees may strike and which not, said Solidarity spokesperson Jaco
Kleynhans.

Mashego, however, said: &quot;Our members are now so angry they are willing to
contravene any interdict or ignore any other issue.&quot;

Kleynhans described the frustration levels of Solidarity members as &quot;high&quot;.
&quot;Eskom's delay tactics with negotiations are terrible; therefore we have to
give the workers a chance to express themselves.&quot;

Although a strike looks imminent and Solidarity is planning the march with
NUM, a strike &quot;is by no means the ideal&quot;, said Kleynhans.

Numsa spokesperson Mziwakhe Hlangani denied that his union has any plans for
a strike. He did however say that Numsa's national managers are meeting over
the weekend to discuss problems with the talks and the possibility of a
strike.

Eskom's human resources manager, Mpho Letlape, denied any knowledge of a
possible strike. She however said contingency plans are in place should it
happen.

&lt; http://www.theherald.co.za/herald/biz/01_29062007.htm &gt; 1.2 Markman
engineering workers demand medical aid

Mawande Jack, Eastern Cape Herald, 1 July 2007
A PORT Elizabeth heavy engineering company has been hit by industrial
action.

Xmeco in Markman township has since last Monday been hit by a strike, with
about 250 workers locked out by management.

The National Union of Metalworkers (Numsa) said the workers were demanding
medical aid for themselves and their immediate families, with an insistence
that the company subsidise it by 70%.

“It is this legitimate demand that made 250 workers go on strike, demanding
that the employer must genuinely address their plight as workers,” said
Numsa regional secretary Irvin Jim. Xmeco staff were subjected to a
hazardous work environment with lots of dust and fumes while tuberculosis
was common among the workers, he said.

“Xmeco is expecting employees to be at work and to work productively, but
when they are sick they must pay for themselves out of their starvation
wages,” Jim said. The union has also accused the company of “outdated
baasskap attitudes”.

Company spokesman Peter Stephens confirmed yesterday that workers were
demanding a 70% company-subsidised medical aid and were being locked out.
“We‘re in constant communication with the union,” Stephens said. However, no
break through in negotiations had so far been made, he said.

Meanwhile, trade union Solidarity indicates that a strike in the industrial
chemicals and petroleum industry seems unavoidable after dispute
negotiations came to naught this week, reports I-Net Bridge.

This could halt the production of petrol, gas and paraffin in the near
future, it cautioned yesterday.

“We remain hopeful that the employers will come up with a better offer in
order to avert a strike, but at the moment a strike seems inevitable,” said
Solidarity chemical industry spokesman Marius Croucamp.

Trade unions Solidarity, the Chemical, Energy, Paper, Printing, Wood and
Allied Workers Union (Ceppwawu), the SA Chemical Workers Union (Sacwu) and
the General Industrial Workers Union of SA (Giwusa) are threatening to
strike.

According to Solidarity, the bargaining council for the industry is already
in possession of a strike certificate, in terms of which trade unions can go
out on strike after having given 48 hours‘ notice.

Employers in the industrial chemicals sector are offering a 7,5% wage
increase and those in the petroleum sector 7%. The unions are demanding 12%,
but have indicated that they are willing to settle on 10%.

This was rejected by the employers, Solidarity said.

Angloplats meets unions on wages

Angus Macmillan, The Times, 29 June 2007
Anglo Platinum is holding talks with mining unions in an eleventh hour
attempt to avert a dispute that could lead to industrial action.

Simon Tebele, spokesman for the world’s biggest platinum miner, told I-Net
Bridge that negotiations are being held this morning with the National Union
of Mineworkers (NUM), Solidarity and the United Associations of South Africa
(Uasa).

Anglo Platinum currently has a 7% wage increase offer on the bargaining
table, its third offer since negotiations started in May. The unions have
been demanding 15%.

Solidarity put out a statement calling today &quot;D-Day for Anglo Platinum&quot;,
saying deadlock would lead to unions making a decision on their next step.
This would most likely be arbitration by the CCMA before any strike action
could take place.

In its statement, Solidarity said Anglo Platinum CEO Ralph Havenga received
a threefold increase in his remuneration package in the past financial year
and shareholders also got threefold dividend increases, &quot;while the workers
would be happy with a double digit wage increase&quot;.

Solidarity also pointed to Statistics South Africa’s latest inflation data
which showed that CPIX was up 6.4% year-on-year and food inflation of 9.1%.

Anglo Platinum’s first offer to unions was 5% plus a once-off 30% bonus
based on a monthly salary. It later raised this offer to 6% without the
once-off bonus and then upped its offer to 7%.

Government workers ended their four-week strike yesterday after the majority
of public sector unions accepted a 7.5% wage increase offer.

mplate/0,,433-441-442_2138126~E,00.html&gt; 1.4 Strikers break ranks

Michael Nkalane, City Vision, 28 June 2007
FOLLOWING some of the striking unions’ decision to suspend their
participation and failed negotiations between the unions and the government
last Friday, SADTU Nyanga branch met at Oscar Mpetha High School on Monday
to update members on their latest position.

Vusumzi Ntlahla, SADTU Nyanga branch secreatary told the teachers that
unlike other unions who decided to suspend the strike, the teacher union
will continue with the strike until they are given a fresh mandate to
suspend it.

He said although the province has decided to suspend the strike, at national
level it still continues. He told the educators that not all the unions
attended the negotiations at the Public Sector Co-ordinating­ Bargaining
Chamber (PSCBC) on Friday. “That is because they knew the government would
stick to their 7,5 % increase.”

He added that SADTU hoped that the two meetings to be facilitated by Cosatu,
will be fruitful.

One was to be held in all provinces on Tuesday. Also, Cosatu Western Cape
general secretary, Tony Ehrenreich, was to chair a joint meeting between
Nehawu and Naptosa where the unions were expected to discuss whether to
suspend the strike or not.

Ntlanhla said: “There is a feeling to suspend the strike (among members).
But if we do suspend, we will resume again,” he said. He asked those present
at the report-back meeting on Monday to come up with a solution concerning
their position on the strike.

Ntlahla said Geraldine Fraser-Moleketi, minister of administration, tried to
call another meeting this past Sunday, which was again marked by the poor
attendance from the unions. “Discussions and updates will continue at Oscar
Mpetha till Wednesday.”

The strikers were also promised that SADTU National Deputy Secretary, Don
Pasquallie, will attend the meeting on Tuesday for a full update on the
strike.

Kwanele Magutywa, a teacher at Sinethemba High School, said although the
province has decided to suspend the strike, they are still striking, because
they are bound by the decision taken at national level.

He said their hopes depended on the outcome of a fresh round of
negotiations.

“We are hoping for a better deal. We’ve been doing this since the begining
of June. We hope that there will be an agreement between the government and
the u­nions,” he said.

Magutywa said the purpose of their meetings was to assess their position and
to keep themselves informed about the happenings and also to strategise.

Vuyokazi Ndabambi (18) of the Learners Representative Council at Oscar
Mpetha said although the strike is affecting them, they felt pity for their
teachers. “Teachers work very hard. They deserve more than 12%. Even some
MPs were teachers before.”

She said since the begining of the strike her school has been trying not to
let the situation deprive them of their right to education.

“During the strike we asked Dugmore to find us invigilators. Our attempts to
engage him were unsuccesful.”

But Ndabambi said they were not taking the strike lying down or being idle.
“We have formed our own study group, where we revise question papers. We
teach ourselves just to keep the education spirit high,” she said.

545717C954082&gt; 1.5 Madisha lashed for Vavi's 'loose tongue'

Eleanor Momberg, IOL, 1 July 2007
The ANC national executive gave Willie Madisha, the Cosatu president, a
roasting this week because of the way the public service wage offer had been
communicated to union members.

Madisha, an official said, had received a severe tongue-lashing from the ANC
national executive prior to the party's policy conference &quot;because certain
information regarding the strike and the deals offered had been communicated
through the media and not directly with union members first&quot;.

Senior Cosatu officials and some of the affiliated public service union
office bearers said last Saturday's announcement by Zwelinzima Vavi, the
union federation's general-secretary, had caused extreme unhappiness and the
scuppering of a planned announcement to suspend the strike on Sunday.

Vavi had told thousands of South African Communist Party supporters at a
gathering in Bushbuckridge that the indication from most Cosatu-affiliated
unions was that they would accept the government's wage offer tabled in the
Public Service Co-ordinating Bargaining Council (PSCBC) on June 22.

Earlier statements by Vavi indicated that there was no way the union would
back down from its 12 percent wage demand, and the country and the
government should be braced for a protracted, crippling work stoppage.

On Tuesday, however, he told the National Education Health and Allied
Workers Union national conference that government's 7,5 percent final wage
offer was not a bad deal, representing some progress and gains.

After three weeks of strike action, the 17 unions in the PSCBC said they
would take the final offer, which included service and specialist-related
increases as well as improved housing and medical aid subsidies, to their
members before making a formal announcement.

Geraldine Fraser-Moleketi, the public service and administration minister,
announced she would meet the unions last Sunday to end the impasse.

But the meeting never happened. Instead of announcing the suspension of the
strike pending the finalisation of consultation with their members, the
unions said the process had been postponed to Wednesday.

Senior union officials said Vavi's announcement had put a spanner in the
works, sparking a row that had dominated last Sunday's four-hour meeting and
again raised its head shortly before the announcement on Wednesday morning
that 60 percent of unions would accept the government's wage offer.

&quot;There was a lot of anger that Vavi had made the comments. It is true that
until Wednesday there were still grumblings that he had not consulted with
us as union leaders before he spoke,&quot; said a senior nursing union official.

An independent union representative said he found Vavi's announcement
&quot;strange&quot;, adding that earlier pronouncements by the Cosatu
general-secretary that workers would not accept anything less than a 12
percent wage increase when negotiators and union members had already agreed
to drop the demand to 10 percent &quot;had almost derailed the entire process&quot;.

The strike has highlighted the strained relationship between Cosatu's
president and its general-secretary. A union official argued this week that
Vavi was a &quot;loose cannon&quot; who was harming the labour movement.

According to a source, Vavi was reprimanded by Madisha, who instructed him
to refrain from making public statements about the strike without discussing
them first with the union executive. Vavi could not be reached for comment.

d=662&gt; 2.1 SAA to stay in red until restructuring

Audrey d’Angelo, Business Report, 1 July 2007
Johannesburg - SAA, which ended the year to March with a loss of R883
million, would be profitable again in 18 months, after restructuring, chief
executive Khaya Ngqula said on Friday.

He told a media conference that although the airline's earlier plans to
expand its route network with more long-haul aircraft had been put on hold,
it would be able to order them in about two years.

Ngqula said SAA's airline income had risen by 7.8 percent to R20.6 billion
and passenger numbers had grown about 9 percent to 7.7 million. Passenger
revenue had risen by more than 11 percent to R14.2 billion. But operating
costs rose by 13.4 percent to R21.3 billion.

This was due to factors beyond SAA's control, including the fall in the
rand-dollar exchange rate, a 12.3 percent rise in the oil price, higher
lease payments for aircraft and &quot;ongoing increases in the broader structure&quot;
of the group.

This meant a basic restructuring of the airline was needed, said Ngqula.
Other airlines globally had been in the same position and many were
returning to profitability.

He explained that the higher lease costs were due to the sale and lease-back
of three of the six Airbus A340-600s it had bought. It also made a final
&quot;balloon lease payment&quot; of R168 million on June 27 on one of the Boeing
747-400s leased when Coleman Andrews was chief executive. This had now been
returned.

Ngula said 30 percent of SAA managers would have to leave as part of the
staff reduction, but some were doing so to take advantage of opportunities
they were offered, rather than being retrenched. It was important that SAA
did not lose those who were vital to recovery and success.

SAA regained some market share it had lost to low-cost carriers in the past
year. Revenue from passengers rose by more than 10 percent to R14.2 billion.

It launched its own low-cost airline, Mango, in response to riding
competition and this was on track. The entire domestic airline market had
grown by more than 50 percent in the past five years.

So far only 5 percent of the population was flying, which meant there was
plenty of scope for growth.

Discussing the restructuring of SAA's route network, Ngqula said it was
concentrating on its African operations and would retain profitable global
routes to &quot;each major continent&quot;. In the domestic market it would focus on
high-density routes but it would retain coastal routes to areas with high
growth.

2.2 So Many Question about electricity

Sunday Times, (part), 1 July 2007
Chris Barron: Given that Alcan will export 95% of what it produces, using
vast amounts of electricity at much lower rates than anyone else is paying,
isn’t it fair to say that it will be subsidised by local consumers?
Eskom CEO Jacob Maroga: No.
CB: Why not?
JM: I’ve told you, the price is not subsidised. It has been approved by the
regulator and the regulator obviously looks at any impact on other
customers, and they’re satisfied that there isn’t.
CB: Given our supply crisis, does it make sense to allow a foreign company
to export, in effect, the electricity it’s getting so cheaply?
JM: Next question?
CB: And now you want local consumers to pay an extra 18%. Why should they?
JM: We’re building new infrastructure to bring capacity to deal with the
consumption of electricity.
CB: Isn’t new infrastructure something your shareholders should pay for?
JM: No. If you want an insight into how tariffs are determined I think you
can talk to the national regulator. Capital expenditure has to be reflected
in the price of electricity; that’s fairly straightforward.
CB: Is it fair to ask consumers to pay 18% more when they’re getting such an
unreliable service?
JM: Which unreliable service?
CB: Consumers in Bedfordview could tell you about that.
JM: I think there are problems in Bedfordview, very significant problems.
But that’s 16000 of 4 million customers.
CB: There’ve been power failures all over the country.
JM: All over the country? That’s an overstatement.
CB: The bottom line is that it’s an unreliable service and we’re being asked
to pay 18% more for it.
JM: Have you got any other questions, because we’re not getting very far
with this?

3.1 SACP heads will roll over divided loyalty

Mpumelelo Mkhabela, Sunday Times, 1 July 2007
Party members serving on ANC Cabinet face chop

THE South African Communist Party (SACP) hardliners plan to purge the party
of several ANC Cabinet ministers who also sit on its top leadership
structure, the central executive committee (CEC), for failing to support the
party’s political campaigns.

The SACP’s plan comes as ANC President Thabo Mbeki appears to be losing
patience with the party. At the ANC policy conference this week, Mbeki
accused the SACP of trying to interfere with ANC policies.

A discussion document, prepared by SACP secretary-general Blade Nzimande for
its elective national conference, proposes that SACP members elect people
who will dedicate their time to the party’s activities.

Those fingered for failing to perform party work include Safety and Security
Minister Charles Nqakula, who is also chairman of the party.

Nqakula’s deputy in the SACP, Dipuo Mvelase, and Provincial and Local
Government Minister Sydney Mufamadi, who is also a CEC member, face the
chop.

Party insiders say Limpopo Premier Sello Moloto, Cosatu President Willie
Madisha and ANC MP Godfrey Oliphant also look set to be driven out.

Moloto and Madisha are said to be too close to Mbeki’s inner circle, which
is considered to be hostile to the SACP.

The Sunday Times has also been told that there is unhappiness in the
Nzimande camp of the SACP about these officials’ perceived hostility towards
ANC Deputy President Jacob Zuma — who remains Nzimande’s preferred candidate
for the ANC presidency.

SACP officials, who are also ANC Cabinet ministers, have been accused of
making public statements that appear to contradict the party’s position.

Nqakula’s statement condemning the public sector strike, in contrast to the
SACP’s support for the strike, has been cited as an example.

SACP sources say former National Union of Mineworkers leader Gwede Mantashe,
who sits on the party’s CEC, is likely to take over from Nqakula.

A replacement for the party’s treasurer Phillip Dexter, who was last week
suspended for a year for penning a document critical of the party, was still
being identified.

While the party intends axing several Cabinet ministers, Minister of
Intelligence Ronnie Kasrils appears to still be in the clear.

Nzimande has, for a long time, been arguing that SACP leaders who also serve
as ANC MPs and Cabinet ministers must be held to account to the SACP for
decisions they take in their capacity as leaders of the ruling party. “Our
medium-term vision calls for . .. relevant accountability measures to be put
in place,” said Nzimande.

“How does a premier or Public Works MEC, who is a member of the SACP,
integrate the pillars of the [SACP’s vision] into his/her own work? We need
nothing less than this from our party cadres.”

Nzimande said the SACP would not continue to allow a lack of accountability
to the party by “cadres deployed in government and the legislature”.

“Much as they must respect the structures in which they are deployed, to go
with policies that are in direct contradiction of the SACP is not
acceptable,” he told the Sunday Times last week.

Nzimande pointed out that when the Termination of Pregnancy Bill was voted
into law, a certain number of MPs opted not to be present in Parliament, as
this contradicted their religious beliefs.

“And then comes the issue of cross boundaries. The SACP has taken a position
to say: ‘Let’s resolve the Khutsong issue before legislation can be passed.’
But MPs, who are communists, voted against the views of the SACP. It cannot
continue,” he said.

According to SACP insiders, several SACP provincial structures had proposed
constitutional amendments that would oblige members who are ANC public
representatives to advance SACP campaigns. The proposals are to be tabled at
the party’s conference in Port Elizabeth next month.

Speaking to the Sunday Times yesterday, Madisha said he did not believe
there was a plot to oust him because of his perceived closeness to the
government.

“In my opinion, there is no fight between the SACP and the government or
ANC. All of us have to work together to build and make sure that the
alliance is strong.”

4.1 ITUC General Council Decisions

Scoop, 30 June 2007
Brussels, 29 June 2007 (ITUC OnLine): The ITUC General Council, at its
second meeting on 20 - 22 June. held a major thematic discussion on
&quot;Building the New Trade Union Internationalism&quot;, centred on deepening the
involvement of trade unionists at all levels in solidarity actions and
international activities, mobilising membership on key international issues,
enhancing cooperation between the ITUC and its Global Unions partners,
making international cooperation programmes more effective, and working
effectively with progressive political and civil society allies.

The Council decided that in implementing the ITUC Programme adopted at the
Vienna Founding Congress, special focus would be given to trade union work
on climate change, protection of migrant workers and those in informal and
unprotected work, action to fundamentally change the course of
globalisation, support for workers in Export Processing Zones, and
supporting workers' rights in China. The Council also decided that planning
should start for an international trade union day of mobilisation for a new
globalisation in 2008.

The meeting also heard progress reports on the creation of unified regional
organisations of the ITUC, with the process expected to be completed in
Africa and Asia-Pacific by the end of 2007, and the Americas early in 2008.
The 87,000-member NHS Croatia was accepted into affiliation.

The Council debated the trade union role in sustainable development and
globalisation and agreed on the need for enhanced work both by national
affiliates and by the Confederation, in order to make an effective impact on
globalisation.

The General Council adopted four special Resolutions:

On the PlayFair 2008 campaign; calling on the International Olympic
Committee to enter concrete discussions with the ITUC and its PlayFair
partners on the IOC's responsibilities to ensure respect for workers' rights
in the production of all Olympics merchandise and to set the standard on
this issue for sports merchandise and sporting events;

Issuing a global warning to pensions funds over negative impacts of private
equity and hedge funds, and calling for governments and international
agencies to ensure proper regulation, taxation and transparency concerning
the activities of private equity and hedge funds;

Welcoming the withdrawal by the European Union of trade preferences to
Belarus, as a result of flagrant and persistent violations of freedom of
association and the right to collective bargaining by the Lukashenko regime;
and,

On the ongoing WTO negotiations, demanding that developing countries not be
pressured to make disproportionate tariff reductions which would seriously
affect their industrial development and employment, given the extremely
negative impacts that current proposals would have in these areas.

The Council noted with satisfaction the release in April of three detained
Eritrean trade unionists, Minase Adezion, Tewelde Ghebremedhin and Habtom
Weldemichael, following the intervention of the ITUC with its Eritrean
affiliate, the NCEW.

The Council also adopted reports from the ITUC Womens' and Youth Committees,
and reviewed the outcomes of the recent ILO International Labour Conference,
including the adoption of new ILO standards for the fishing sector, and
discussions on sustainable enterprises and on the future work of the ILO.

Founded on 1 November 2006, the ITUC represents 168 million workers in 153
countries and territories and has 304 national affiliates.
