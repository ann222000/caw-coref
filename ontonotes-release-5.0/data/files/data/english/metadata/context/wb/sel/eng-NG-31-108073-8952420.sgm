I am among intellectuals in r.h.j. Townsend Harris, City College uptown --
in my day the homes of the poor Jews with brains. Among my friends, it was
acceptable for me to go to Clinton and Cornell because I had been accepted
to Townsend Harris and then when I graduated from Clinton, I was accepted to
CCNY. It was my father's idea that, if I could support myself while going to
Cornell, there would be a greater financial value to the degree.

Clinton was a breeze and much easier to reach from my home in The Bronx.
Cornell was a challenge because I literally worked my way through. However,
I became a chef (union card, you betcha) and a magazine salesman and a
newspaper deliverer and a stadium usher and a carving table server for a
caterer and a waterer in a greenhouse and a lawn cutter. All on a full
schedule and with decent grades.

It was worth it, financially, in later life but I regret not having spent my
college years among the brains at City. My friends who did go to City told
me of the stimulating faculty and wild-haired Jewish geniuses they went to
school with.

Your friends were right.....I remember attending a lecture given by Bertrand
Russell at a time when I was too young and callow to appreciate his
brilliance.  In those halcyon days,  City was known as the Communist College
of NY in spite of the fact that it had the largest volunteer ROTC unit in
the entire country, in which membership I was exposed to the beauties of
fighting WWII of my ass rather than on my feet.  It was an infantry unit
and, by the time I had finished the basic course, I knew that my preordained
future was undoubtedly in the world of aviation.  How did it work out?
Well, I'm here to tell you about it, aren't I?  Ain't education
wonderful????

BTW, speaking of Clinton HS, we used to have some humongous football games
with Clinton, which we lost more often than we won.  AIR, we used to
attribute it to the fact that Clinton was all-male while Evander Childs was
co-ed, and our players were more often than not more depleted than yours, if
you get my drift.  No wonder you never seemed to have too much trouble
whipping our asses.

My brother went to Jr. High at Clinton.......PS 45, I think it was.  He
ended up at Stuyvesant, Cooper Union and the Manhattan Project.

I was quite bitter about the closing of THHS after my second year. But
it made the third year (William Howard Taft HS) a total breeze. Is
stopped working hard for grades and my grad point average went up from
89 to 97 with little effort. And the credentials of a CCNY BS got me
into the U. of Chicago in 1948 (when it was the ne plus ultra of grad
schools) in Chemistry. We were a class of 60 some odd of supposedly
among the best in the nation (I question that) but I was one of 13 a
year later who were given their S. M. degree and admitted to research. I
found U. of C. just as stimulating as was THHS except now more
sophisticated. BTW when I got out of the army in 1946 I applied to
Syracuse U. and was accepted. But decided to go to CCNY as that way I
could save my GI Bill funds for grad school; worked for me.

Those were the days. Schools such as THHS, Bronx HS of Science,
Stuyvesant HS, CCNY, ...  Then the egalitarians took over and after WWII
they turned CCNY eventually into a glorified HS. Open enrollment killed
a very good school. I doubt they'll ever recreate its good reputation.
I found it ironically amusing that Fiorello LaGuardia used the argument
that THHS was a school for an elite and didn't deserve to continue. But
he was impetus for founding the High School of Music and Art (my sister
was in the first graduating class) and to him that wasn't an elite school.

When I was of Jr. High age, I went to Creston (PS 79), on Creston Avenue
around 179th Street. At the time, the &quot;famous educator&quot; Angelo Patri was the
principal of PS 45. It was there, writing about his students that he coined
the phrase &quot;juvenile delinquent.&quot;

He was also famous for recording an RCA commercial with kids singing &quot;I want

In spite of not enjoying the lap of luxury, it was fun growing up in those
days.  When I lived on White Plains Road, we used to go around the block to
Hunt Avenue, a relatively quiet street with little traffic, for pick up
stickball games.  Used to play three base softball (because there wasn't
room for the fourth base) in an empty lot next door to our apartment
building.  Used to hitch rides on the back end of the trolley car that ran
in front of our house, drop off a few blocks away and wait for a trolley
going in the opposite direction for a free ride home.

Like I said, it was fun.  I doubt that kids these days have anything
comparable available to them.  Their loss.....even worse, they don't even
know it.

What do I remember, you shouldn't ask. I believe it's the dicarboxylic
acids starting with oxalic, malonic ... oh fudge. I'd have to google
this. I believe there are other chemists here who may remember, I only
have a horribly advanced degree in analytical chemistry (we're
affectionately known as anal chemists) from 1967, and 30 years leaves
lacunae. I suppose this is one of them.

But I do remember the mnemonic, for what that's worth.

Two MIT students were doing homework together. Of course, in the pre-Gates
days they used slide rules. One was doing a simple math problem and asked
the other, &quot;How much is 2 X 2?&quot;

Whipping out his K&amp;E slide rule (or was it Dietzgen?) the second student
replied, &quot;It's 3.999 -- oh, call it 4.&quot;

I learned to use a sliderule.  (One of the last classes to do so at

to buy myself one of those new-fangled electronic calculators.  (I
still have it, and it still works.  The power switch is broken, so
you have to turn it off by removing the batteries [four double-A's],

A friend of mine, a Cal Tech alum, commented that during one dismal football
game, the cheerleaders led a cheer that went like this:
&quot;Give us a C!  Give us an A!  Give us a L!  Give us an I&quot;   until California
Institute of Technology was completely spelled out.

At Pacific Lutheran University the cheer is &quot;Lutefisk lutefisk, lefse lefse!

I've been told as we age, we forget the newer things first, sort of

school just down the block from where I used to live on Netherland

I hate to brag (not really), but when I graduated from

One of our sayings back then was &quot;You can always tell a Harvard man ... but
not much.&quot;

In a supermarket in Cambridge, Mass, a young man with a grocery cart stacked
high got into the &quot;15 Items Only&quot; lane. Two professors exchanged
observations. One said, &quot;He's obviously from Harvard and can't count,&quot; but
the other one replied, &quot;He is probably from MIT and can't read.&quot;

Like a schtarker, I asked for two chocolate pops, in Hebrew. The elderly
vendor shook his head. &quot;I don't understand your Hebrew,&quot; he said in
Yiddish.&quot;You talk like a Chinaman.&quot;

&gt; That's the version I remember from Bronx Science.  I don't remember if
&gt; the sports teams had names, but folks from other schools tended to refer
&gt; to us as &quot;Science Fags&quot;.
">

I vaguely recall that, back in the 30s and early 40s, the term &quot;fag&quot;
referred to feminine characteristics or behavior rather than homosexuality.
Cigarettes were also called &quot;fags&quot; and that connotation goes at least as far
back as WWI.  A popular song of that era &quot;Pack Up Your Troubles&quot;  contains
such a reference, as you can see from the chorus  below:

Pack up your troubles in your old kit-bag,
And smile, smile, smile,
While you've a lucifer to light your fag,
Smile, boys, that's the style.
What's the use of worrying?
It never was worth while, so
Pack up your troubles in your old kit-bag,
And smile, smile, smile.

Me.  I grew up in Brooklyn on E 22nd Street, between Quentin
Road and Avenue R. I was recently told that this block is
considered to be the best in the neighborhood; I thought it
was the best in my time.  The neighborhood was mostly Jewish
then, and it still is, but lately it has shifted from
Ashkenazi to Sephardic.

We didn't have pizza places.  We did have Jewish delis,
appetizer stores and a cafeteria.  Kings Highway was the
place to shop.

I thought that I had impressed my son by using that mnemonic to rattle
off the names of the dicarboxylic acids, until he pointed out that
they now used the IUPAC names, eg  ethanedioic, propanedioic and
butanedioic instead of oxalic, malonic, succinic, etc.
