One of the most obvious tasks I thought Photoshop could handle with
ease would be to allow me to edit my holiday photos, then burn them to
CD or DVD and view them on my TV. Apparently not. Neither iPhoto nor
iMovie can perform this simple task either. I have had a few &quot;experts&quot;
try to figure out a method, but to no avail.

Is there any genius out there who has the magic answer?

Why should an image manipulation program also burn your images?

Hook your laptop to your TV, or get a DVD player that will play them.

Photoshop is for creating and editing images. Why should it
do anything else? It has never been sold as a DVD burner
or a thing which hooks up to your TV.

You may just as well complain that your TV does edit your
photographs, or come to that, it does make toast either.

Try Adobe Premiere Elements for movies or still images then save them
as an mpeg.
Or use Roxio Easy Creator 9.

You could try using the right software for the job. Photoshop is a photo
editor, not disc burning software.

It does not take any degree of genius or even of moderate intelligence.

You just use Photoshop, or any other competetant Image editor to resize your
images to the size you need, and then save them as Jpeg.

You would then use Nero, or any other competant Burning program to put them
onto a CD or DVD.

You would then put that CD or DVD into a DVD Player connected to your TV,
and see your pictures.

PS Remember to turn the TV and DVD Player on.

Both Macs and PCs can easily burn CDs (if you have a CD burner installed

CTRL click the desktop, select &quot;New Burn Folder&quot;. Save your images into
that folder from PhotoShop. Go back to the desktop, CTRL click the
folder again and select &quot;burn&quot;. Insert a blank disc when prompted.

Well. Thanks for all your kind help. I'm a retired teacher and spent
my career trying to share my knowledge to help others learn.
Unfortunately, that spirit is not shared by all members in this forum.
Some are here only to bully and belittle others. My advice is to them:
Grow up.

Oh, by the way, I found the answer to my question (on my own). Here it
is:

After editing photographs in Photoshop, you simply &quot;Save for Web &amp;
Devices...&quot; and select &quot;JPEG&quot; in the Dialog box, then click &quot;Save&quot;.
Burn the Jpegs to a DVD and play them on your DVD player. Sit back and
enjoy viewing a siideshow on your TV, using all the functions of your
remote--Pause, Forward/Backwaard, Zoom, etc.

There is no need to use any other software, or hook up a laptop to the
TV.

People did try to give you the correct answer. Myself included. But you
chose to ignore the advice you were given and kept up your rant instead.
For the record and for your information, the correct answer is this...
You are trying to use the wrong tool for the job.
Use photoshop to make the Jpegs, then use a CD Burning tool like Nero to
burn these Jpegs onto a CD.

Pray tell, why did you ignore all these answers?
Was it because you were more interested in trolling, and the question was
merely an excuse to troll?

Photoshop is a professional image editing program. It does that better than
any other, though at a price.

For what you are seeking to do, look at Adobe Premiere CS3 (now packaged with
Adobe Encore). It will do all that you want. However, it is also a
professional NLE w/ authoring tool.

Where is your &quot;simple question&quot;?

Is this how you write questions for your students?

Bill has seven apples.  John has four apples.  Susan wants to make
cider, but her iPod's battery is dead.  Is there any genius out there
who has the magic answer?

My fellow brother and sister genii have been somewhat unkind to you,
professor. But you did sort of open the door with a bit of attitude.

The instructions about saving for web are correct. You can also look at the
scripts that came with Photoshop. Several of them will generate
presentations that might do what you want to do.

As far as people not being nice to you, or not sharing information with you,
that's really unfair. A lot of people spend time here answering -- not
asking -- questions. Getting mad at an application or at a bunch of people
like me -- who have nothing better to do than try to help newcomers like you
-- is sort of silly, don't you think?

But have a wonderful day, and may you and your family have a wonderful
holiday season, professor.

&gt;&gt; You didn't ask a question you came in critical of an application you
&gt;&gt; knew nothing about and expected it to make hot chocolate for you. If you
&gt;&gt; were a teacher I feel ever so sorry for the poor minds you fucked up.

DEAR KATWOMAN
What part of my question is rude? I stated that my &quot;expert&quot; friends
couldn't find the answer I needed. Is that rude? I asked if there was
a &quot;genious&quot; in the forum who could help. Is that rude? Perhaps you
thought I was being sarcastic? It was intended humorously (to
emphasize my need for a brilliant person to save me! Geeze.
As for me being wrong, I don't understand what I was ever wrong about.
It seems clear to me (now) however, that some readers thought I was
asking if Photoshop, itself, can burn a CD. I do admit, after reading
my question more carefully, it does sounds that way. So I plead guilty
for phrasing the question ambiguously.  Nevertheless ,did that warrant
all the hostile comments I received? I am genuinely perplexed by this
whole experience. I wouldn't be writing all these replies to complete
strangers if I didn't feel genuinely indignant about the way I have
been--and continue to be--treated. Don't worry, I'm never coming back
here. No more rude questions from me.
-Andy
