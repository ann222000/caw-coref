Railways boss plans prefabricated stations
Thu Nov 1, 2007 12:33am GMT

By Pete Harrison
LONDON (Reuters) - Dozens of prefabricated glass and steel stations
and around 1,700 new carriages on trains running 7 days a week will
shape future railways, says the chief executive of rail infrastructure
company Network Rail.
The news is likely to be welcomed by the country's passengers who make
over a billion train journeys a year and have become used to
overcrowded carriages, decrepit stations and closures each Sunday for
maintenance.
Iain Coucher is the man tasked with overhauling and expanding the
clogged system at a cost of more than 10 billion pounds over the next
7 years.
&quot;Rail usage is at its highest level since 1946 and will soon be at its
highest ever,&quot; Coucher told Reuters late on Wednesday on the eve of
submitting to government Network Rail's plans for renewal and
expansion to 2014.
&quot;Lots of the stations are very tired and very old,&quot; added Coucher, who
took over as CEO in July.
&quot;We can produce a high quality, high tech station for about a million
pounds, with 13 weeks for installation, so there's minimum passenger
disruption. The first one's going into a station in south London, at
Earlsfield, in the next few weeks.&quot;
Traditionally, station renewals have cost over 4 million pounds each
and led to lengthy closures, putting the system under even more
stress, but Coucher plans to install around 25 of the new structures a
year for the next decade.
&quot;We're also looking at modular bridges and anything we can replicate,&quot;
said Coucher, who is starting to make a name for himself through his
hands-on style. &quot;It's all about driving down the Railway's unit
costs.&quot;
The focus on modularity is a new approach Coucher has brought to the
job, but plans for a &quot;seven day railway&quot; predate his arrival as chief
executive.
&quot;At the moment, we do too much at the weekends and passengers hate
it,&quot; he said. &quot;Increasingly over the next two years, you'll see much
less.&quot;
Working processes will be changed to fit into the eight- hour time
slots available at night.
Network Rail has managed to cut the time taken to replace a set of
railway points from 54 hours to 27 and aims to have that down to an 8-
hour night shift by 2010.
But Coucher's biggest challenge will come from overhauling some of
Britain's biggest and busiest stations, such as London Bridge,
Blackfriars by the River Thames and Reading Station, which forms a
bottleneck on the country's main east-west artery.
&quot;London Bridge will be a challenge and will take meticulous planning,&quot;
he said. &quot;Blackfriars will be about building a station on a bridge,
which has never been done in the UK before. People will be able to
exit on either side of the Thames.&quot;
And will all of this fit within the 10 billion pounds budget the
government has allocated?
&quot;It's there or thereabouts,&quot; he added.

Coucher said &quot;Replacing a station has conventionally cost £4m - which
will be cut to £1m&quot; in precis.

Excuse me but didn't the likes of Flowery Field, Godley, and Woodsmoor
come in at less than £100k - simple pre-fab timber construction on
concete pad foundations?

OK - that was just less than twenty years ago - but double it and add
a bit and you still can't get to more than £250k

Why can the modern railway not achieve that level of value for money?

As I understand it the GWR produced standard sized panels in the
woodworking shops in Swindon. A number of these panels could be used
to make a station building, signal box or whatever. They were
transported as panels and assembled on site. The same sort of thing
could be done with modern materials, but in many projects the aim is
to minimise site work by plonking down whole buildings which have
been built elsewhere.

While some of the panels may have been CLASP, ISTM that they were
assembled in a somewhat different way to most CLASP buildings, no
matter what variety of CLASP one is considering (from memory there
were at least four varieties of CLASP but I can't be bothered to
look it up). CLASP did not involve the concrete beams commonly seen
in the railway buildings for example.

I thought the whole idea (that Antony Smith appears to have glossed over),
is that Government have already published the 'Statement of Funds Available'
in the White Paper/HLOS, and this is NR's response:

&quot;It is Network Rail's formal response to the Government's High Level Output
Specification (July 2007), and our first major submission to the Office of
Rail Regulation's (ORR's) periodic review.&quot;

Roughly half of Edinburgh Waverley is on vaults, as is the whole of
the original St Pancras and presumably a lot of the new roof
extension there.

I have recollections of a number of disused station buildings being
on bridges over the line and I'm sure there are examples of
currently open stations arranged like this.

Are at least part of the buildings at Manchester Oxford Road not
above the road?

Because of payments made to all and sundry as compensation for
disruption.  Network Rail pays millions in compensation each year.

In BR days, this didn't happen.  IF BR's work on a station disrupted
BR's train services, BR didn't have to pay BR anything.  Trains were
either disrupted or cancelled for the duration of the work, people
just accepted it, and that was that.

Of course not one penny of the millions of pounds in compensation paid
to TOCs by Network Rail ever gets to the long suffering passengers.
TOCs pass on the disruption to their passengers, but keep the money.
It merely swells the TOCs' profits.

I doubt he writes his own press release - I reckon these PR people ought to
employ a bit less hyperbole, and stick with the facts. I just emailed a

of the new carriages only being used once per day...

Can't be certain, David, but *all* of Piccadilly is effectively on stilts.

Isn't Manchester Central on stilts?  ISTR there being a car park under
there when I were a lad.  What about Wolverhampton (High Level) - that
seems significantly above at least some of the surrounding environs.

Almost as soon as I'd sent that post, I was reminded that someone who gave
me a lift to a (then) work Xmas do in Manchester had parked in the one under
the former Central station. I suspect the former Mayfield terminus is on
stilts too.

&gt; &gt;Coucher said &quot;Replacing a station has conventionally cost £4m - which

&gt; &gt;Excuse me but didn't the likes of Flowery Field, Godley, and Woodsmoor
&gt; &gt;come in at less than £100k - simple pre-fab timber construction on
&gt; &gt;concete pad foundations?

&gt; &gt;OK - that was just less than twenty years ago - but double it and add
&gt; &gt;a bit and you still can't get to more than £250k

&gt; &gt;Why can the modern railway not achieve that level of value for money?

&gt; Because of payments made to all and sundry as compensation for
&gt; disruption.  Network Rail pays millions in compensation each year.

&gt; In BR days, this didn't happen.  IF BR's work on a station disrupted
&gt; BR's train services, BR didn't have to pay BR anything.  Trains were
&gt; either disrupted or cancelled for the duration of the work, people
&gt; just accepted it, and that was that.

&gt; Of course not one penny of the millions of pounds in compensation paid
&gt; to TOCs by Network Rail ever gets to the long suffering passengers.
&gt; TOCs pass on the disruption to their passengers, but keep the money.
&gt; It merely swells the TOCs' profits.
">

There are changes in Health and Safety requirements, building
regulations and so on. Plus wages are generally higher these days,
too.

And the compensation point is correct, too. However, the compensation
is for loss of profit. The levels are adequate for the odd weekend
closure, because the traffic bounces back straight away. However, on
routes that are often disrupted traffic falls away and the
compensation paid to the TOCs is hopelessly inadequate, particularly
for a franchise based on predictions for growth.

There is now a car park for the Manchester Central Convention Complex
(GMex plus the Manchester International Convention Centre) that is
contained within the vaulted basement of the old Central Station.  The
structure is not on stilts, it is formed of brick vaults.

After Manchester Central Station closed, and in the approximately ten
years before it was converted to GMex, I think the train shed was used
for car parking, but not the basement.  If I recall correctly, the
conversion of the basement into a car park only happened during the
conversion of the train shed into GMex.

It's certainly high above Wolverhampton Low Level.  ;-)

Good point, though I'm sure the &quot;stilts&quot; description is good enough
between friends.

Nope.  There was a car park under Central after it closed and long
before it became GMex.  That would have been late 1960s, early 70s.
There was also a car park on what must have been railway property of
some kind in Watson Street, just round the corner.  I remember going up
a ramp onto what looked like it must have been a former goods yard,
possibly also on a vaulted base.

Having mentioned &quot;my&quot; station on the DLRE, I've realised pretty much
all of the stations on the original Docklands Light Railway routes to
Stratford and Island Gardens (old) were built on bridges...

Most of the LOR, Various 'elevated' stations on the 'Underground',
e.g. the West end of the H&amp;C, and since I don't think which country
was specified, how about the 'Els' in New York?
