Hi all,

Sorry for the simplicity of this question, however I am new to the car
audio scene, and thinking of buying a set of 6x9's to put on the parcel
shelf of my car, and some more powerful speakers for the front doors.
However, will i benefit from new speakers that have an output of say
200W if the maximum output of my stereo is only 25W x 4 x channels?

Many Thanks,
Mark

Speaker output is not neasured in Watts. A Watt
( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watt ) is a measurement of electrical
power and does not directly map to acoustical output, which is
typically measured in dB SPL
( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_pressure_level ).

When you see a speaker with a label on it that says "200W" that only
means that the speaker is rated to dissipate or "handle" 200 Watts of
power--it does not "output" those Watts.

Powering a speaker rated for 200W with a radio capable of delivering
only 25W is not going to hurt anything other than perhaps your wallet.
It's like putting "Z"-rated Pirellis
( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tire_code#Speed_rating_codes ) on a Toyota
Tercel--it may look dang impressive, but it's a waste of money and
won't make your car go any faster. It will, however, make the tire
salesman very happy.

Thank you for your response,

So basically - are you telling me that I won't hear any sound benefits
from installing these new speakers unless i purchase an amp?

No, that's not what I'm saying at all.

Using the tire analogy from my last post, Z-rated Pirellis won't make a
Toyota Tercel any faster, but it might very well take corners better
because of the lower profile and better rubber compounds used compared
to the original factory tires. Your system as a whole might very well
sound better, but it probably won't be louder, and it won't mean that
you can crank your head unit up and get less distortion.

I once put a set of MB Quart 6.5" coaxials on a basic Sony CD player
and it sounded *worlds* better than did the factory speakers on the
same head unit. So you may very well notice a difference in sound
quality. However, if you have a crappy source of signal (head unit),
there exists a very real possibility that the only thing a set of
really nice set speakers is going to do is "amplify" (or make more
apparent) just how sucky your head unit is.

Personally, I would probably seek out a pair of really nice 6.5"
coaxials and use an adaptor plate instead--by going with a more
universally-sized speaker, you'll have far more to choose from and will
likely get a better deal.

I swear by the Pioneer 4-way  6X9's. The the 200W version made a
believer out of me back in '90 when I put them in my 1980 Formula Firebird.
I since had to get another pair, I think they are 220W  now; because the
first set "rotted" in the back window. They now even have a 5-way that I
have not heard but if they are anything like the 4-way they must be pretty
darn good. Then again quality has diminished over the last few years.
I entered a stereo competition back in '90 with just my Pioneer head
unit powering everything and actually had the promoters wondering where my
hidden subs and amps were because they could not believe the bass and dB's
(112) that I obtained from just a pair of 6x9's and my head unit power. They
thought for sure I had 10's in the back so I popped my trunk and they were
amazed to just see the 6x9's mounted on the underside of the rear window
bay. I know 112dB is nothing now days but give it a thought: these were
6x9's powered by my KEH-8686 head unit (15x4). Those were the days......

There are two different wattages on the speakers: the RMS Wattage, and
the maximum watts that the speaker can handle.  My 6x9's are 100 Watt
RMS and 400 Watt Peak.  Does this mean that I want to play the speakers
at 200 Watts instead of 100 Watts?  No.  Keep in mind that the RMS
wattage of a speaker is the continuous power output.  Anything above
that specified RMS power is only meant for short bursts; like a snare
drum or a bass drum.  Same thing goes with amplifiers... always go by
the RMS value of your amp and speakers first before you buy anything.
It is pointless to buy an amp if your speakers can't handle them.  My
suggestion is to buy loud speakers with a decent RMS value (say 65
Watts RMS or above) first.  Next my suggestion would be to buy a new
head unit that handles at least 17 Watts RMS per speaker and about 50
Watt Peak power output so that you can some decent sound quality out of
the head unit.  If you want to buy an amplifier, you should know the
RMS power of your speakers first before you make any decisions.
Typically, you want an amplifier with a higher RMS value than the
speakers themselves.  If the amplifier outputs power above the amp's
RMS power, then the signal gets distorted and ruins the speaker.  This
is why you need to good clean signal especially if the output of the
amplifier is above the RMS value of the speaker; this way the clean
signal will not ruin the speaker.  Remember, the better the signal the
longer your speakers will last.

The "peak power" spec (and I use the term "spec" very loosely here) is
absolutely meaningless. More often than not it's simply a marketing
ploy to make you think you're getting something you're not.

RMS stands for "root-mean-square" and is a way to find the steady state
equivalent of something that varies over time--it's how you figure out
how much power a wave is being carried by a non-steady current. I could
go on about how RMS is calculated (it's really simple) and what it
means, but there are a plethora of resources online that already do
that--Wikipedia, however, would be a good place to start
( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_mean_square ).

This is very debateable. I would say that it's not *pointless*, though
it *MIGHT* be a waste of money, depending upon how much the power
ratings for both amp and speakers differ. Some people, however, will
say that having an amp that delivers more power than the the speakers
are rated for is a good thing--it means your amp doesn't run as close
to its limits and gives you greater dynamic headroom, but of course if
you overdo it and get careless, you can do some serious damage to your
speakers. Many discussions have been had about this on this newsgroup
and on the web in general; once again, Google is your friend.

Here's where I start getting confused. First of all, assuming you're
not talking about the 12V supply voltage from the battery, a head unit
does not "handle" watts, it "produces" or "delivers". And your advice
about the "50 Watt Peak power output" makes no sense. The corresponding
peak value of an RMS rating is the RMS times 1.414, so 17 * 1.414 = 24
Watts, which, incidentally, is pretty close to the maximum amount of
power you can expect per channel from a head unit (assuming the head
unit does not employ a switching power supply, which I seriously
doubt). This 50W figure you've produced, I suspect, has been pulled
directly from your shorts and means nothing.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; RMS power of your speakers first before you make any decisions.

This makes sense, assuming you already have the speakers.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; speakers themselves.
">

But earlier you said it's pointless to have an amp that the speakers
can't handle. If the speakers are rated for X Watts, and the amp is
rated to deliver MORE than X Watts, isn't that "more than the speakers
can handle"? This seems to be somewhat self-contradictory advice.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; If the amplifier outputs power above the amp's
&gt; RMS power, then the signal gets distorted and ruins the speaker.
">

This is flatly wrong. Distortion alone does *not* destroy speakers--at
least not always (again, Google for this--don't bother trying to argue
your point until you do some research). Furthermore, the term "a
distorted signal" means pretty much next to nothing. Anything that is
not exactly as the musician played it is a distortion. When I play my
Fender Stratocaster through my Tube Screamer and then into my Fender
amp, the Screamer adds (a lot, if I want) of distortion...and that
distortion doesn't hurt my amp or my speaker one bit. When you listen
to any rock 'n' roll band, you are listening to (at times grossly)
distorted signals--that's part of the character and unique sound that
the musician is looking for. You can also distort signals by time
shifting them, compressing them, etc., etc., etc. Additionally, because
of the human ear's relative insensitivity to distortion at low
frequencies (i.e. in your subs), we can get quite a bit more than RMS
out of an amp playing subbass frequencies and not harm the subs one
bit...and I guarantee you that every subwoofer system you've ever heard
is playing above its rated RMS power level, and yet the subs are not
"ruined."

Lastly, there is no real standard (or regulation) in the car audio
industry on how to come up with this RMS rating, and it's difficult to
compare two amps on RMS ratings alone. RMS does not mean "unclipped
signal"--RMS does not even consider whether the signal is clipped or
not! This is why you see amps with a rating that looks like "100W RMS @
1% THD"--which tells you how much "total harmonic distortion" is
produced at that power level.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Remember, the better the signal the longer your speakers will last.
">

Again, vague generality...what's a "better signal"? I would personally
say that Robin Trower would be a much "better signal" than Nine Inch
Nails, but that's not to say that either one is more dangerous to your
speakers than the other. Now as for your ears and the stuff between
your ears, that's a whole different matter altogether...

What I meant was don't buy a 800 Watt amp for 10 Watt speakers... When
you do have loud speakers that can handle a lot of watts, buy an amp
that can output a little more power than the speakers are rated at.

"Here's where I start getting confused. First of all, assuming you're

Yes, basically the 50 Watts means nothing at all.  Most head units that
say "50x4 W max" have an RMS value of 17x4 W.  This is why I said look
for the 50x4 W peak power units.

it according to how much continuous power the speaker can handle

max power ratings.

I think the general sentiment behind your advice is right-on, but some
of the details need a bit of explanation.

Better advice would be to say "buy an amp whose power rating is
*comparable to* the rated power handling of the speakers"...going a
little over or a lot under is not bad--it all depends upon how
concientious the user is behind the volume knob. I'm not going to blow
a 200W speaker with 15W of power, no matter how clipped the signal is.

The problem here is that you're actually encouraging people to look for
head units whose manufacturers have lied about the performance of their
product.

Most people think "peak watts" means "this is what I'll get for short
bursts of music program, when that isn't really accurate--it refers to
the square of the peak output voltage (14.4V if you have a
superconducting head unit and a revved-up engine) divided by the load
impedance (typically 4 Ohms)...it's not the "peak" in the sense of a
dynamic peak, it's the peak as in "this is as much voltage as this head
unit can deliver regardless of how far you crank that volume knob, and
regarless of how short the 'burst' is."

I think a better thing to say to people would be to "avoid altogether
those head units that make a big fuss over 'peak watts' and try to draw
your attention away from reality. Buy a head unit from a reputable
manufacturer and don't buy your head unit at Sears." :-)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

The ratings usually reflect the thermal power handling of the
speaker--in other words "this speaker can handle 200 applied Watts, RMS
without melting the voice coil or shorting it out." You can't really
rate a speaker according to it's "point of distortion" (by which I
assume you mean "mechanical power handling") because that is
dramatically altered by the enclosure that the speaker is in. It's a
well-known fact that subs in sealed enclosures will handle infrasonic
frequencies *far* better than those of a ported enlosure because a sub
in a ported enclosure will "unload" (act as if in "free air") below the
Fb or tuned frequency of the cabinet. I know we're still talking about
6x9's here, which likely assume infinite baffle, but it's worth noting
that mechanical power handling is solely dependent upon the speaker
itself.

No. With your existing amp there is no benifit provided by the new speakers
being rated 200 watts.
If they are better speakers thay may sound better, but the 200 watt rateing
is not the reason.
If the 200 watt speakers are less efficient thay might not be as loud.

they have good bass response; would you recommend speaker baffles?  Or
does it depend on how the 6x9 is made?  I'm hearing that some 6x9's
have better bass without speaker baffles (open inside a trunk) and some
have better bass with speaker baffles.  "Better bass" meaning quicker
bass response and louder.  I notice when I have my 6x9's not mounted at
all and just laying on the seat, I hear very little bass; I can see the
woofer cone moving but I barely here anything.  I think this is because
the sound waves in the bass spectrum cancel each other out somehow
since the front end of the speaker is not isolated from the back end.
Either that, when it is mounted in place, does the part where the
speaker is attached to (the metal frame) help bring out the bass
somehow?  What I'm really asking is how can you make your 6x9's sound
best?

If you're talking about foam baffles, please check out the link
below--it's a thread on this newsgroup from early December of last year
in which we discussed the merits of foam baffles. I don't personally
think they're worth spending time or money on, but others have said
they've noticed improvements from using them (which may or may not be
psychosomatic :-):

I don't think I've ever seen a 6x9 that was intended to be used in an
enclosure. They're typically intended for use in what's called
"infinite baffle" situations, or what some people mistakenly call "free
air". If you want to know what is considered "infinite baffle", just
look at the listed "Vas" (volume of the acoustic suspension) spec of
the speaker, which is typically measured in liters (or "litres" if
you're from Canada, eh?). If you wanted to put the 6x9 in an enclosure
and have it perform as though it were in an infinite baffle situation,
you'd construct a box that's greater than or equal to the Vas of the
driver...which can get pretty large in a hurry.

So, if you want to put put a speaker in a box, just make sure it's no
smaller than the Vas of the driver, otherwise it's not going to perform
as the manufacturer intended. It'll be louder, for sure, (in the
midrange) but it won't do as well in the lower frequencies.

You've got it. This is what "free air" really is--sitting on a table
(or a seat) with no baffle or barrier between the front of the cone and
its rear. And the politician-like behavior you describe (a whole lotta
lip movement, but not much being said) makes perfect sense if you think
about what sound is.

Sound is nothing more than a fluctuation in air pressure that happens
rapidly enough and with enough intensity to be heard by the human ear.
That means that, for the 'average' human, the air around you must
oscillate more than approximately 20 times per second (20 Hz) but not
more than twenty-thousand times per second (20kHz). This range varies
from person to person, but this is the generally accepted limit of
human hearing.

Now, how does a speaker produce these vibrations? Simple--by rapidly
compressing and rarefying the air in the listening space. When the
speaker moves towards you, it creates a region of high pressure on the
front and a region of low pressure behind the cone. But if you cannot
isolate these two regions from one another, the pressure that you
increase on the front will bleed around the edge of the speaker and
fill the "void" in the rear, giving you a zero net change in sound
pressure level on the front of the cone and voila...no bass.

But why is it that you can hear the higher frequencies with no problem,
but it only seems to be the bass that's affected? That's because in
order for there to not be a cancelling effect, the baffle has to be as
wide as 1/2 (or is it 1/4? I can never remember and it's been a *long*
time since I've presented this information--on the order of 10 years or
so, so if it turns out to be 1/4-wavelength, adjust the following
figures accordingly) wavelength of the sound you're trying to produce.
Let's say you want to reproduce a 60 Hz sine wave with a speaker and
you want to know exactly how wide the baffle must be in order to do it.
A 60Hz tone has a wavelenth of approximately 18.76 feet--we'll call it
20' just to keep the math simple. Half of that is 10 feet, so to keep
from cancelling-out a 60Hz tone, your baffle would have to have a
radius of at least 10 feet. Want to reproduce a lower tone without
cancellation? You gotta go bigger. :-)

So what could you expect to hear from a 6x9 in free air? Well, working
backwards, we'd take the smallest dimension of the speaker's diamter
(6") and double that--12" or 1 foot. Then we figure out what frequency
has a wavelength of 1 foot, which is approximately 1,125 Hz (1.1 kHz).
Below this point, you get attenuation (cancellation) and above this
point, the speaker itself acts as its own baffle (otherwise you'd never
be able to hear *anything*).

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; What I'm really asking is how can you make your 6x9's sound best?
">

Go back to the fundamentals. :-) To get the best performance from your
6x9's, you need to fist make sure that you have completely isolated
(acoustically) the front of the driver from its rear--seal your trunk
and allow no air to pass from the trunk to the cabin and visa versa.
Unfortunately, this is easier said than done, unless you're driving a
German luxury car. :-) Of course, the best "infinite baffle" is a
sealed enclosure bigger than the driver's Vas, but that's often times
completely impractical for sundry factors.

The second thing you can do is to make sure that the surface to which
the speakers are mounted is *very* rigid--it should not flex, vibrate,
bend or move in the slightest. If the mounting surface (the baffle)
vibrates at all, you lose fidelity (and usually get to listen to
rattles, adding insult to injury)--this is why we typically make
subwoofer enclosures out of wood composites like MDF rather than out of
sheet metal. Wood composites have a very low "Q" (they don't want to
resonate at any particular frequency) whereas metal tends to be a very
high "Q" material (it would just love to sing, given the right
stimulus).

Then, assuming these factors are taken care of, you can start worrying
about how much power you're using and the quality of the amplifier and
head unit...but if you haven't taken care of the speaker's back wave
and your baffle is crap, putting more money into your amp and/or head
unit to get "mo' betta bass" is going to be nothing more than building
a palace of gold on a foundation made of Jello-O brand gelatin.

Thanks Dan.  You provide a lot of detail in your explanation.  I know a
lot more about electronics than a normal person and I've taken a lot of
physics and calculus classes but I still want to learn more about
amplifiers and electronics in general.  Sound waves and and sound
creation is something I need to work at, but I know that the pattern of
sound waves is based off of a sinusoidal wave function... something
like y(x,t) = Amplitude * sin (xt - phase constant)...  or w/e and that
sound waves are just pressure differences that travel through air in a
longitudinal wave form.  I have really good physics books that I got
from college discussing the basics of electronics with calculus based
theorems and sound wave patterns through mathematics.  I find it really
interesting how it all goes together real well.

Yep. Just goes to show you that God really knew what He was doing when
he "threw" this stuff all together. :-)

talking about tires to tell about speakers..HahaHAHahaha.....idiot.
mb qapp....lol
stay away from any speakers that cost over $100 n $59 for smaller
speakers (5.25-3.5).
infinity-polk-kicker are the top 3 in car speakers...
i dont own any of these.
jvc-kenwood are very good too.

i see all here know very lil about audio things.. the max power on
speakers mean almost nothing.....
the rms power is more important..i wouldnt go over 20% higher than
that.with a very good amp.
max power youre only there for 1sec more or less.
just back off your bass n your gains.....
also important you get solid powersupply.
also never play your music over 85% of max on the volume knob.ever!
