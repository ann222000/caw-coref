Based on what you have said, The most relevant Conns of the PS3 are as
follows:

* At least $100 of $499/$599 price you're paying for is Blu-Ray,
unless you have a High Definition televison this is a useless feature.
If you do have an HD televison you may find this as a perk, just be
away Blu-Ray is still an early adopter technology and good chunk of
the PS3's price is to cover the cost of the built-in Blu-Ray player.

* There will be more M rated games on PS3 than on the Nintendo Wii.
The PS3 and XBox 360 consoles lend themselves more to older teenagers
and adults with a lot M-rated games in their library. M-rated games
today often include strong language (use of the F-word is not
uncommon, nudity, extreem violence (which your playable character
often has to act out), etc... I'm not stating all of this to tell you
what is best for you or you son, but to make you aware that when games
are stamped as M/Mature you might want to consider the content and the
PS3 is not marketed for children.

* I already mentioned the extra cost of the Blu-Ray with PS3, the PS3
isn't necessarly a bad value when you sum up the cost of what you're
getting in the box, it's just a lot of the extras Sony is putting in
the box isn't going to improve your Son's gaming experience. For
example with the PS3, you're paying for WiFi, you're paying for media
card readers, there's an option to install another operating system,
etc...

* The PS3 is the selling the most poorly of the three next generation
consoles in the US. It only came out last November and already Sony
has discontinued two models... the system is still evolving and unless
sells improve dramaticly over the long term it is possible Sony may
pull out of the hardware business or more likely rush the PS4 out the
door within the next two years.

* Two other consoles you may consider for your son are the Nintendo
Wii and the XBox 360, both have a larger library of games at this
point and based on the release dates available that trend will only
continue.

* The PS3 is the most expensive of the current crop of consoles, the
low end prices are: Nintendo Wii - $249, XBox 360 $299 and PS3 - $499.
You minimum investment does buy you more with the $499 PS3, but
exactly how much more is really questionable. I think it's a Conn that
Sony does not give the customer the option for a lot of the features
that come in the box for the $499 system... a lot of these parts are
over valued to help Sony compensate for the very expensive Blu-Ray
drive as I already mentioned.

- The competition has a better (albeit more expensive) on-line
service. The XBox 360's on-line service is very grown up and as a
parent you can allow your son to play against his friends on-line in a
family zone, Microsoft also has a pretty good auditing system in place
to help insure their family zone is kid friendly (although I would not
let my kids play on-line unsupervised). Microsoft's on-line service
comes out to about $4/month when you sign up for a year. Nintendo's on-
line service provides a web browser, downloads and some fun content,
but no on-line play... The PS3 does has an on-line service, it allows
on-line play, but it's less developed at this point, it is

PROS

* PS3 comes with a Blu-Ray (this one can go either way, depending on
your perspective, it requires HDTV, some would say 1080p capable HDTV
to really notice any difference in quality). Blu-Ray movies still cost
about $10 more than DVDs.

* PS3 is a &quot;PlayStation&quot; product, Sony has been very success with the
PS2 and PS1 and at this point with the $499 model you can still run
all of those games. This means you can go to a video game chain like
GameStop and trade in your sons PS2 (assuming he has one, most people
do) so you can knock off $30-40 off the $499 price, that could go
towards a game.

* PS3's on-line service is free, it's currently more limited than what
it's leadin competitor is offering... but that could change.

Pick one up ASAP.
For a 10 year old there is no finer choice then a PS3.
The Wii is a flat out joke and the 360 is geared towards adults.

I would recommend not listening to boodybandit. As you see he's
typically a man of few words who doesn't qualify much of anything he
has to say with substance or data. He's sort of the local ass clown.

Pros:

HD movies, and HD games
It plays PS3 games, PS2 games, and PS1 games
It can play videos, and mp3's, and display photos
The ability to give allowances on the playstation network store

Suggested games:
F1 Championship edition
Need for Speed Carbon
Madden 08 (out in a few weeks)
Plenty of Arcady type games on the Playstation Network store.

Cons:
It's lacking in the games department. Especially non-violent ones.  Your
best bet is the go to the store and look to see how many they have. Look for
the E for everyone titles.

other than the lack of games, there really isnt another con. With the price
dropped it's the only complaint. But that will change come this fall and
next spring. However, it would be a good idea to look into what E rated
games are coming.

RMZ would and probably has, traded in the prospect of ever having a woman in
his life in exchange for his 360.  He doesn't own a PS3 so I wouldn't listen
to anything he says.  Wait for the guys who actually own one to tell you
what to do for a 10 year old.  I personally would be hesitant to buy anyone
that young a 360 or a PS3.  Does he have a PSP already?  I bought my 7 year
old a Wii and there are times when he will watch Spanish soap operas with my
wife (he doesn't speak Spanish) rather than go play his Wii.  Its funny how
recently there was an episode of Run's House on MTV that was one big
advertisement for the Wii.  Avoid this if possible.  I would truly recommend
a PSP with 6 or 7 games for the price of a much more expensive and delicate
next-gen console.

You do realize by attacking me personally it shows not only your
immaturity level, but also your inability to counter my discussion
topics on a intelluctual level. Which pretty much has been the case in
most of most post here. As the many threads will show, the cycle
generally goes something like this. A. I'll post a lengthy opinon
piece backed backed with links to sources to back my claims. B. You
you guys call me names and while you can't provide any source for your
logic or figures you will unsuccessfully try to argue a counterpoint
C. Fascinated that a group of people with no facts and the inability
to acknowledge others perspectives would continue to argue to the
point of name calling and personal attacks (like this one) I persist
on, generally providing more data to back up my comments while the
personal attacks grow more intense.

Most recently this occurred to the degree that someone went out and
posted my personal information... and I'm the one who gets called
crazy. I hate to dilute this perfectly fine thread with all of this
baggage, but the original poster has a right to know that a lot of
people in this group are apparently children or adults that just
aren't intelligent enough to back their opinions with any kind of data/
research.

Before you even bring up &quot;but you called boodybandit and ass clown&quot;,
well that's because in this context and in other post he's just so off
the mark that it's comical and the term ass clown just came to mind.
Let's review what he said, he said &quot;For a 10 year old there is no
finer choice then a PS3&quot;, you just disagreed with that as well and at
least provided some additional comment to back up why you feel the way
you do, he didn't provide anything, just a loose, incorrect,
unvalidated opinion.

First, my background.  I have an 11 year-old son and a 9 year-old daughter.
I own all three current systems, all of the last gen systems, and basically
almost every system ever released since the late 1970's.  So, you could say
I enjoy videogames.

For me, each console purchase decision comes down to the following factors:
current software library, price, future outlook, and extra features.

In my opinion, the current PS3 software library is not adequate for most
adults, let alone a 10 year-old. Neither would I recommend an Xbox 360, as
most of those titles are M-rated and geared towards teens and older players.
Of the three current systems, the Wii is most geared towards the younger
players.

I'm going to assume for the moment that price is not a problem.  If you were
concerned about the price, you would probably not even be considering a PS3.

As for the future outlook, for the PS3 it is mixed.  There are a lot of
great titles on the way, but again, most of those are for the older crowd.
If the PS3 follows the path set by the PS2 and PS One, eventually it will
become mainstream and attract a lot of other games geared towards families
and younger players.  This is likely to happen, but it is not a certainty
because the PS3 isn't selling as well and therefore not attracting the
attention of developers.

For extra features, the PS3 is aces.  There's the Blu-Ray movie playback, of
course, which may be more important in a few years as HDTV's come down in
price.  The card reader, backwards compatibility with PS2, and wireless
internet adaptor are great to have, and I particularly enjoy the
connectivity with the PSP.  Compare this to the competition, which requires
you to purchase an add-on for HD-DVD and pay for an online subscription.

That said, a 10 year-old probably could not care less about extra features,
future outlook, and price (unless he is spending his allowance!).  All my
kids care about are the games, and this is the order of their gaming
preferences--Nintendo DS, PlayStation 2, GameCube, Wii, and Xbox.  There is
nothing on the PS3 or Xbox 360 that they really care about right now.

So, I ask you, why does your son want a PS3?  What games does he want to
play?  Does he already own a PS2?

I would not recommend a PS3 for a 10 year-old at this point in time because
it is quite expensive for casual gamers, and the software library isn't big
enough.  However, if you have the cash and don't want to wait, you could
pick one up now and be content to play all the $19 PS2 Greatest Hits games
on it while waiting for new PS3 software to arrive.  This might be
especially exciting if he never had a PS2 to begin with, since all those
games would be new to him.

If he has no gaming systems at all right now, and doesn't need the &quot;latest
and greatest&quot; technology, pick up a PS2 and unique games such as Guitar Hero
and Singstar, as well as any of the hundreds of bargain-priced software (Sly
Cooper, Jak &amp; Daxter, Ratchet &amp; Clank), all for less than the price of a
PS3.

But it couldn't have been more on cue for YOU to post a response to this
thread.  You are more predictable than Jonah.  What Jonah has on you is he
changes it up at least.  You are so freaking repetitive with your rants its
not even funny.  Why would anyone respond to your &quot;lengthy opinion&quot; when
everything you have said has already been addressed.  You just take the same
information and regurgitate it in a different way.  Maybe if you said
something different, you wouldn't get attacked personally all the time.
Jojo is very anti-PS3 as is Jordan, you won't hear anyone except the
hardcore sony trolls attack them personally because they are not repeating
the same drivel.  I think you honestly belive that if you say something
enough, you will first convince yourself and then later others.

The fact of the matter is, YOU DO NOT OWN A PS3 so what can you offer to
what the guy needs to know other than your uninformed opinion of the PS3.
He didn't ask about the 360.  He didn't even mention the 360.  As a matter
of fact, what group are you posting in, troll?  You are a broken record,
move the needle.

I only wrote what I did to piss off RMZ.
That and I do believe that of the 3 next gen (well the Wii isn't next gen
but you know what I mean) systems the PS3 will be best in the long run for a
10 year old going on 13. With the wide variety of PS2 and 1 games that coule
be picked up cheap, there is no better soultion for a 10 year old &quot;boy&quot;.
The Wii is young kids and there just isn't enough games out for it and why
pay $50 dollars for games that are last gen? The controllers are expensive
as hell to boot.

The 360 is mainstream adult.

I didn't go into detail because I knew I new resident troll would blow a
gasket. Not that I can see it unless someone responds to his dumb ass
because I filtered him out last week.

&gt; That said, a 10 year-old probably could not care less about extra features,

Just wanted to point out there are actually a lot of games on the XBox
360 that my 9 year old son likes, but a lot of them are too difficult
for him to play to finish. Some games that come to mind. Project
Gotham Racing 3, Burnout Revenge, movie licensed far like: Disney's
CARS, Shrek The Third, Ratatoullie,  Surf's Up... While not all great
games by critics standards, my son loves those games.... There are all
a lot of games on XBox Live Arcade that will appeal to kids and they
are all rated either E or T. Some that come to mind are: Mad Tracks is
a good example (cost about $10.00 for the full game and can be
downloaded), Ageis Wing and Pac Man Championship Editon are others
that come to mind.

We own a Nintendo Wii and an XBox 360 and I ask my nine year old which
system he liked more and he told me he liked the Nintendo Wii a little
bit more, but I've observed he plays the XBox 360 a lot more...
probably because we haven't gotten anything new for the Wii in a
while.

As a parent I really recommend the Nintendo Wii for a 10 year old.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; My son wants a PS3, so Icome to the experts here on this newsgroup.
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Pros
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; and cons please.  My son is ten years old and loves video games. I do
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; not
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; let him play the more violent games out there.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; So help me out here, experts.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Thanks to all

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; RMZ would and probably has, traded in the prospect of ever having a
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; woman in
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; his life in exchange for his 360.  He doesn't own a PS3 so I wouldn't
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; listen
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; to anything he says.  Wait for the guys who actually own one to tell you
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; what to do for a 10 year old.  I personally would be hesitant to buy
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; anyone
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; that young a 360 or a PS3.  Does he have a PSP already?  I bought my 7
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; year
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; old a Wii and there are times when he will watch Spanish soap operas
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; with my
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; wife (he doesn't speak Spanish) rather than go play his Wii.  Its funny
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; how
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; recently there was an episode of Run's House on MTV that was one big
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; advertisement for the Wii.  Avoid this if possible.  I would truly
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; recommend
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; a PSP with 6 or 7 games for the price of a much more expensive and
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; delicate
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; next-gen console.

&gt; &gt;&gt; You do realize by attacking me personally it shows not only your
&gt; &gt;&gt; immaturity level, but also your inability to counter my discussion
&gt; &gt;&gt; topics on a intelluctual level. Which pretty much has been the case in
&gt; &gt;&gt; most of most post here. As the many threads will show, the cycle
&gt; &gt;&gt; generally goes something like this. A. I'll post a lengthy opinon
&gt; &gt;&gt; piece backed backed with links to sources to back my claims. B. You
&gt; &gt;&gt; you guys call me names and while you can't provide any source for your
&gt; &gt;&gt; logic or figures you will unsuccessfully try to argue a counterpoint
&gt; &gt;&gt; C. Fascinated that a group of people with no facts and the inability
&gt; &gt;&gt; to acknowledge others perspectives would continue to argue to the
&gt; &gt;&gt; point of name calling and personal attacks (like this one) I persist
&gt; &gt;&gt; on, generally providing more data to back up my comments while the
&gt; &gt;&gt; personal attacks grow more intense.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Most recently this occurred to the degree that someone went out and
&gt; &gt;&gt; posted my personal information... and I'm the one who gets called
&gt; &gt;&gt; crazy. I hate to dilute this perfectly fine thread with all of this
&gt; &gt;&gt; baggage, but the original poster has a right to know that a lot of
&gt; &gt;&gt; people in this group are apparently children or adults that just
&gt; &gt;&gt; aren't intelligent enough to back their opinions with any kind of data/
&gt; &gt;&gt; research.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Before you even bring up &quot;but you called boodybandit and ass clown&quot;,
&gt; &gt;&gt; well that's because in this context and in other post he's just so off
&gt; &gt;&gt; the mark that it's comical and the term ass clown just came to mind.
&gt; &gt;&gt; Let's review what he said, he said &quot;For a 10 year old there is no
&gt; &gt;&gt; finer choice then a PS3&quot;, you just disagreed with that as well and at
&gt; &gt;&gt; least provided some additional comment to back up why you feel the way
&gt; &gt;&gt; you do, he didn't provide anything, just a loose, incorrect,
&gt; &gt;&gt; unvalidated opinion.

&gt; &gt; But it couldn't have been more on cue for YOU to post a response to this

1. He didn't ask about a PS2, he asked about a PS3.

2. As I pointed out in another post the XBox 360 has quite a few more
games available RIGHT NOW geared for kids, granted they are mostly
movie licensed games, but still the selection is there and it's not at
this time on PS3.

Microsoft is positioning the XBox 360 as a family console (finally),
granted up to this point it has been marketed exclusively for adults.
The PS3 has always been marketed for adults and continues to be.

Well, what sort of games does he like to play?  Does he have any other
game console/handheld already?

The PS3 still suffers from its high price (even at its reduced price of
$500) and relatively small library of compelling exlusive games.  The best
exclusive game for the PS3 currently is 'Resistance: Fall Of man', which
is a violent first-person-shooter based on an alternate history of WW2 and
is rated &quot;M for mature&quot;, so it doesn't sound like something you'd let your
son play...

Seriously, I'd recommend a PS2.  Yes, it's the older console, but has a
huge library of games that will keep your son entertained as he gets
older, and is loads cheaper than even the Nintendo Wii.  There are still
new games being produced, and of course, the stores are filled with older
and used titles at bargain prices.

A 10 year old will be perfectly satisfied with a PS2 - there's more than
enough there to keep him interested for years, and unlike the PS3/360,
there's actually a selection of GOOD non-M (and even non-T) titles - all

Try to think beyond the scope of this year Doug.
I am saying if you are going to get one of the &quot;3 next gen&quot; systems the PS3
is the way to go because you can play &quot;ALL&quot; of those PS2 and 1 games on it
for cheap and the PS3 has a wider range of games for all ages when compared
to Nintendo and MS.

&gt; &gt; So help me out here, experts.

&gt; &gt; Thanks to all

&gt; Pros:

&gt; HD movies, and HD games
&gt; It plays PS3 games, PS2 games, and PS1 games
&gt; It can play videos, and mp3's, and display photos
&gt; The ability to give allowances on the playstation network store

&gt; Suggested games:
&gt; F1 Championship edition
&gt; Need for Speed Carbon
&gt; Madden 08 (out in a few weeks)
&gt; Plenty of Arcady type games on the Playstation Network store.

&gt; Cons:
&gt; It's lacking in the games department. Especially non-violent ones.  Your
&gt; best bet is the go to the store and look to see how many they have. Look for
&gt; the E for everyone titles.

&gt; other than the lack of games, there really isnt another con. With the price
&gt; dropped it's the only complaint. But that will change come this fall and
&gt; next spring. However, it would be a good idea to look into what E rated
&gt; games are coming.
">

Ratchet and Clank?

Also the people who did Sly Cooper are said to be making a PS3 game.

Good point!  But I never said which of those systems I bought at or near
launch, which systems I waited for price drops on, and which systems I found
years later at a garage sale! :)

For the record, the only systems I bought at/near launch were the Atari 2600
(a gift from parents), the SNES, the PlayStation, PS2, N64, Dreamcast,
GameCube, and Xbox 360.  I waited for price drops to purchase a PS3, the
original Xbox, and the original Nintendo.  Everything else (Intellivision,
Colecovision, Genesis, Jaguar, 5200, 7800, etc.) I found at swap meets or
garage sales.

I still have to rent PS2 games for my kids (though they're quite a bit

Oblivion .for me to play, then I have 1 PS2 rental out at a time for games
like Ratatouile or Meet the Robinsons that they play with me when they want
to.

That said, I have gotten quite a bit of PS2 time myself on my PS3 as I went
through Bully, GodFather, and God of War 2 on my PS3.   There are still
plenty of good PS2 games that will keep me occupied in between PS3 releases.

What?  It makes sense.  The only reason to choose one console over another
is exclusive games.  The PS3's best exclusive games at this moment are one
&quot;M&quot; rated shooter, and one &quot;E&quot; rated racer - neither of which got
super-stellar reviews.  Most of the titles shared between the PS3 and 360
aren't very kid-friendly either.

At 10, the kid's going to be interested in E/T games, but that's going to
quickly change once he becomes a teenager.  The PS2's large established
library makes more sense here, and a lower price isn't going to hurt
either.  At this time, there's no reason to buy a 10 year old a PS3 unless
he's completely played out the PS2's library (and if that's the case, you
might want to rethink how much time he's spending playing video games ;)

Do you have kids Doug?
They usually want what they ask for or they don't want anything.  If his son
is asking for a PS3 he isn't going to be happy with a PS2.

10 years old is not really a &quot;kid&quot;  in terms of gaming.  Unlike people of
our gaming generation, they have been exposed to a great deal more gaming by
the age of 10.  By the time I was 10, we had Atari 2600, 5200,
Intellivision, Collecovision, Oddessy, Commodore Vic 20 and 64 and Vectrex
in terms of portable gaming.  A 10 year old today has infinitely more
options and exposure so they are more &quot;gamingly mature&quot;.

True - but the OP didn't say &quot;my son wants a PS3&quot; - he just said &quot;my son
loves video games.&quot; and asked for opinions.

My opinion is, if the kid doesn't have a PS2 already, that should be a
consideration.  It's much cheaper to buy a PS2 than a PS3 at this moment,
and the PS2 has a much larger, kid-friendly library compared to the PS3's
PS3 game library.

Even though the PS3 can play PS2 games, I don't see a reason to spend 4x
the money on a PS3 if you're just going to play PS3 games on it.

Sure, in a year or so, the PS3 will probably be the better option.  At the
same time, the PS3 will also be more affordable, too.

I hope you dont mind me jumping in this conversation. Here is my two
cents since I have both the xbox and ps2. i have played the ps3 and I
think it is pretty similar to the xbox, the games are more geared
toward the advanced users. See if he would settel on the PS2, it has a
way better selection in games plus more games for kids -- even girl
games if you have a daugther. And another tip, he is going to want you
to purchase games and they can get way spendy. I would research the
rental places around your town or subscribe to a company like gamefly.
I use gamefly since i often play the games for a few weeks and then i
can send back without the cost of late fees. good luck on your new
journey into the video game world. you will probably notice yourself
spending more time with your son, playing video games. it is a
definitely a great way to bond.

my son is 13, I've been playing games for over 30 years on, from pong to
PC plus countless others to the ps3.

I bought a ps3 when it came out. I have had no trouble with it at all.
the blueray dvd stuff...who cares, I have a separate system for that
stuff.  I don't see it as a perk, I guess I'm sorta stuck in that
component way of thinking, but my components are down to two or three
these days.

As for the games, there aren't a lot to choose from, but I don't know
exactly what kind of games he likes. I'm into just about everything
except those strategy based games, kinda like a big chess board.

We also have a Wii, If you purchase it you WILL be asking Why a few
months after the purchase. The wii format is fun for a while, but it
just becomes overdone and boring.

PS3 will play ps1, ps2 games as well, which you can get many ps2
greatest hits games for 20.00 and lower,  many are GREAT games.

If you wanna take the plunge on a ps3 remember there aren't many games
out there, I don't know how fast you son is a finishing games but after
a few months he'll be playing ps2 games on it waiting for new ps3 games.

PS3 games I've played: Madden 07 -  get the ps2 version, Fall of Man,
Ninja Gaiden Sigma, Oblivion, Tony Hawk, and some others.

It is very easy to set the ps3 up online, we have a wireless router and
it hooked up directly, just entered my router info and there ya go.

although some ps2 games are not supported for online play on the ps3,
like madden 07.

I was thinking about those systems recently, my son is 13, he broke his
teeth on a ps1, then quickly a ps2 and now is beating ps3 games with ease.

The memories of that joystick and one button on the 2600. We had a
knock-off pong and gun system before that, but I can't remember the name
of that system, but I thought it was awesome back then.

my daughter's DS Lite demolishes everything I had back then, and she's 9.

Well, he specifically said that he doesn't let his kid play mature or
violent games. Nintendo is obviously the best option, given those
conditions.

Glad you did cause more people need to know about this service. Our
family started using gamefly (like netflix for games for those who
don't know) and we love it. we get all our games from them now since
you can 'keep' any game you like for vastly discounted prices. and i
think you get free shipping when you keep games (atleast some times.
need to check on that one.) great service. kids don't beg for games
anymore in the store. we set the parental controls so they can manage
the game queue themselves. they really enjoy that and, it probably
gives them a sense of responsibility. they can rent stinkers too and I
don't care cause i didn't pay for the game. just send it back. yeah!
the kids don't leave games around any more cause it has to go back
before they get a new one. i don't know if gamefly thought much about
families when they set the service up but it's so perfect. i'm sure
you all've heard of them but incase not their site is www.gamefly.com .
