By the wayâ€¦.I think Dr. Dillehay (who discovered and excavated Monte Verde
in South America) is one of the best when it comes to knowledge about the
peopling of the Americas. If you are interested in these sorts of things I
recommend his books for study.

Science notes: The Americas weren't farming laggards, after all

Researchers discover that agriculture began in this hemisphere about the
same time it did in the Mideast.

By Robert C. Cowen | Columnist

Archaeologists writing agriculture's history are gaining new insight from
ancient food remains. They are tracing the progress of crop domestication
through genetic changes recorded in DNA samples. This new perspective has
already punctured the notion that agriculture was slow off the mark in the
Americas. As recently reported research in northern Peru illustrates,
agriculture's roots run back some 10,000 years in the Americas, just as they
do in the Middle East.

Meanwhile, studies of DNA from ancient and modern cultivated wheats and
their wild relatives trace the domestication of this wonder plant over
thousands of years. They reveal how wheat's genetic nimbleness allowed
breeders to adapt it to a variety of environments to the point where it now
supplies 20 percent of humanity's food calories.

The impression that the Americas were agricultural laggards was an illusion
created by insufficient data. A review of research into agriculture's
origins published in Science last month quotes paleobotanist Tom Dillehay of
Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tenn., who points out that
archaeologists &quot;were misled by what was not preserved and what we could not
see.&quot; Now they are finding fossil remains of ancient crops under old
grindstones, hut and hearth floors, and in other once-inhabited places. Dr.
Dillehay and colleagues described a wealth of such discoveries in the June
29 issue of Science, which also carried the overall research review.

The researchers conclude that their findings in Peru &quot;provide evidence for
early use of peanut and squash in the human diet and of cotton for
industrial purposes and indicate that horticultural economies in parts of
the Andes took root about 10,000 years ago.&quot; The researchers add that the
evidence of trade and social complexity they are finding show that this also
developed &quot;in the Americas nearly as early as it did in the Old World.&quot;

Botanists distinguish between cultivating wild plants and domesticating
them. You can cultivate wildflowers in your garden. But they won't be
domesticated until breeders change their physical characteristics. Ancient
farmers cultivated wild wheat.

Then they began selecting plants for characteristics they valued. Stronger
stalks made harvesting easier. An ability to hold on to seeds so the wind
did not disperse them made for higher yields.

Jorge Dubcovsky and Jan Dvorak at the University of California in Davis
reviewed this long domestication of wheat as it is reflected in the DNA of
wheat samples from various ages. They pointed out earlier this month in
Science that one central fact stands out: Wheat has what these botanists
call a &quot;dynamic genome&quot; that makes it ideal for domestication.

It's all too easy to breed the original genetic diversity out of a wild
plant to the point where it's hard for breeders to adapt their favorite crop
variety to a changing environment. A new insect pest or a shift from a wet
to a dry climate can make a particular variety useless. The DNA record shows
that wheat has overcome such so-called genetic bottlenecks by easily
reincorporating some of the genetic diversity of its wild ancestors by
interbreeding. It also can quickly rewrite its own genome.

The story of humanity's shift from hunter/gatherer to farmer is a tapestry
of interwoven threads representing environmental, social, and botanical
changes. Scientists are beginning to trace the botanical thread in
unprecedented detail.
