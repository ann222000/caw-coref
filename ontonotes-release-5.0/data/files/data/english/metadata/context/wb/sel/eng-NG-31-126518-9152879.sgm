Dear members

I thought you might be interested to know that The Guardian, a British daily
newspaper, has launched a long-term relationship with a village in Uganda.
Below is their introductory article.

Best wishes

Tim
Welcome to Katine

The main road through Katine.

The village and its hinterland is one of the poorest places on the planet. A
few wells and boreholes are the only source of water and most of those are
contaminated. Most people rise early to tend their own small plots of
vegetables before trying to earn the typical daily wage of just 50p. But
they offer warmth, friendliness, and hospitality.

The road falls and rises to the horizon like a highway across the American
midwest, except that the surface is brick-red mud and stones and potholes.
It runs through the heart of the village called Katine. As it heads south
towards Soroti town, it passes the health centre where the frustrated doctor
is absent, before carving its way between the dusty porches and wooden doors
of the trading post, Katine's High Street, where Loyce Achao, the
pharmacist, gives malaria pills on credit and reflects on politics and the
shortcomings of men.

And the road goes on, past the secondary school where Mathias Obella, the
PTA chairman, smart in jacket, tie and shiny shoes, has finished his earnest
end-of-term exhortations to the students on hard work and good behaviour,
and the primary school, where the new head, Didimus Emiru, frowningly pushes
the class registers about the desk, trying to figure out why the attendance
sums don't add up.

To the right and left of the road spread small clusters of houses where men
and women, their husbands, wives, sisters, brothers, uncles, aunts,
grandparents and innumerable children sleep, work, suffer and, when they
can, laugh together.

Most of them live in absolute poverty. They have too little to eat and their
water comes from contaminated wells. Those babies who do not die from
malaria become hungry, ragged schoolchildren with no shoes whose ambition to
better themselves in life hangs on their chances of obtaining an exercise
book and a pen.

Katine is a village with nothing except the warmth and initiative of its
people.

[image: Katine: Mary Amulo and Julius Elwangu] Mary Amulo and Julius
Elwangu.  On one side of the road, Mary Amulo and Julius Elwangu, an
aspirational thirty-something couple, stage a brief morality play for guests
in their yard which will one day be shaded by the orange trees they have
planted. Their theme, acknowledged with nods from the neighbours, is that a
man should not beat his wife when he comes home to no food because the
hungry children have eaten it.

Not far away Stephen Edau, 19, head boy and teetotal father of two, dreams
of becoming a doctor but wishes his mother would give up making the hooch
that helps pay for his education.

Elsewhere, Esau Edonu, an ageing farmer rich in cattle, reflects that he
would like a brick house but must make do, because he must pass his animals
to his sons. A green awning offers shade to those who visit with condolences
for the death of his three year-old grandchild, while the young mother leans
listless against a post of the house. At her similarly grass-thatched home
on the other side of the road the traditional birth attendant, who now calls
herself Sister Josephine, contemplates the wreck of her once-yellow plastic
apron and wonders where she will get another.

This is a community that has known devastation. Four years ago, the red road
was empty. Anti-government rebels from the Lord's Resistance Army in the
most northerly districts of Uganda swept along and across it, fighting and
stealing children - boys for soldiers and girls for concubines. A burned-out
car rusts in memory of the bad times.

[image: Katine's Bodada taxi cyclist Peter Otim gives a ride to passenger
Benna Acio and her son Richard Ebulu (2)] Peter Otim earns a small living by
running one of the village's cycle taxis. His passengers are Benna Acio and
her two-year-old son, Richard Ebulu.  But these days, early on a Tuesday
morning, the road is a flood of people, on foot, on bicycles or riding
pillion, exchanging shouts of greeting and handshakes as they go. They surge
from the south and meet a tide coming from the north at the junction with a
second road which leads to Kaberamaido. It is shopping day.

A few yards down the Kaberamaido road stand the fixed shelters, restaurants
and a hot, dark video hut in Katine market. It's a babble of noise, a
confusion of colour. Everything is for sale, dirt cheap, though not
everybody has money to spend.

At the butcher's stall, the meat is very fresh. The head of the cow
slaughtered that morning sits in the dust. With a grunt, the butcher swings
his machete high and smashes it down again and again onto the tree trunk
that is his chopping board, eventually severing muscle and bone. This beef
is sold not by the fillet or rump steak but by the chunk.

There are, as yet, no flies here, nor around the fish or food stalls. Women
serving take-away rice balls pick them up out of the sizzling pan with their
hand in a plastic food bag, deftly turning it inside out to enclose, wrap
and hand over the snack for all the world as if this were Waitrose.
Monstrous snake-like fish of the eel family from the lake are packaged in
palm leaves, for those who can afford it. There are tiny dried silver fish,
tilapia and Nile perch too.

Where money is so scarce, recycling has a whole new meaning. A man sits on
the ground in the shade of a thatched stall repairing plastic washing-up
bowls. He sews neat patches cut from car tyres or old boots over the holes,
pushing a heavy-duty needle through the layers with an iron thumb. He mends
cheap flip-flops that have come apart. Second-hand clothes from the UK and
the US are for sale. Among them is a Gap man's shirt in faded blue and white
check, soft from a hundred washes but neatly pressed, and modest dresses
hailing from the American Bible Belt that hang below the knee. The man who
repairs ancient radios is busy. The barber powers his razors with old car
batteries.

This community is ingenious and industrious but as poor as the road's red
dirt, eking out a precarious existence that can be tipped into tragedy by
disease or drought. So many individuals have potential that is unfulfilled
by an education that is low-grade even for those whose parents manage to
raise enough money for books and uniforms to keep them in school.

Katine market is organised and prosperous, but most of the traders bringing
bananas, tomatoes, huge sweet pineapples, grain and beans come from some
distance away. Most local people dig their gardens - good-sized fields -
only to try to feed their families. If they have surplus in a plentiful year
they will sell to buy hens and goats to rear and produce chicks and kids
which eventually they hope to exchange for cows. Then the children can have
milk for breakfast, but like the goats and chickens, the animals are rarely
for eating. Cows are bankable wealth - and dowries.

[image: Katine: Sarah Akol (17) and Kevin Ameso (12)] Sarah Akol, 17, and
Kevin Ameso, 12, tend their mother's plot of land early in the morning. Like
others in the village they go to dig at 6am before attending school or
attempting to make some money later in the day.  And so the whole village
goes to dig at 6am as the sun rises, coming back at 11 to eat if they have
food. Most children, heading for school after a couple of hours, have
nothing at all, all day until dinner. After weeding, planting or harvesting,
people attempt to make money.

Julius Elwangu goes to his bicycle repair business and Mary knits woollen
caps in pinks and reds which occasionally somebody will come to buy for 50p.
That's a day's wage here. Most people's daily income is no more than $1, the
recognised wealth threshold of the poorest of the poor.

The 32 year-old widow Caroline Itwaru sells fish she has bought wholesale
from a lorry to try to keep her nine children in school - some years they
go, some they miss.

Those who work at the market are among Katine's more prosperous citizens.
Lucy Amero has secured one of a row of restaurants, a low mud-walled
structure with thatched shelter supported by upright tree branches. But it
is hardly an easy life or a grand income. She is 35, with eight children
including two month-old twins. Sweat shines on her forehead as she hurries
between the customers seated on logs at wooden tables and the fire out the
back where the goat stew simmers, while her oldest son, 21 year-old Julius
Echeau, waits on the tables. He defers to her when asked how much money the
business makes.

&quot;Today I bought a goat, slaughtered, at 25,000 shillings (around £7),&quot; she
says, pausing in her shuttle between customers and pot. &quot;If it goes very
well I am likely to get 30,000 (£8.40) or 32,000 shillings (£8.96),
depending on how many portions are left.&quot;

It's a big financial outlay for her, so today she is cooking only goat stew,
millet bread and beans. Other days she may buy two or three kilos of meat
instead of a carcass but also two chickens, and posho (maize meal) and rice
could also be on the menu. Lunch costs 600 shillings (16p), but with rice
instead of posho or atap (millet bread), the price goes up to 700 shillings.

Profit margins depend on the generosity of the restaurateur, Julius
acknowledges. &quot;It will depend on the size of the piece of meat you cut,&quot; he
says. &quot;If you cut very small you lose customers. If you cut large sizes you
may make a loss.&quot;

Two restaurants along, business is considerably brisker, but he denies they
are more generous with their meat. It's the regulars, he says. Habit. &quot;The
customers are used to them.&quot;

Over the far side of the market is Janet Adong, a tailor. She sits in the
sewing alley, two lines of Singer machines, their needles racing. By
mid-afternoon she has completed eight commissions - some of them repairs,
some entire traditional dresses called gomas, of silky fabric with puffed
sleeves, gathers at the waist and a large decorative girdle. These days the
modern older woman may go for the half-gomas, she explains - a short jacket
and matching full-length skirt which is lighter to wear.

It's a good job for a man or a woman. She can earn as much as 30,000
shillings on a Tuesday at the market and she likes her work. The ceaseless
flow of customers wanting her to copy a blouse or mend a dress shows she is
expert at it. The rest of the week she works in a community project, the
Ugandan Women's Effort to Serve Orphans (UWESO), helping to train 14
children - 10 boys and four girls - in her skills. It's a real chance for
them. No less than an opportunity to escape destitution. There are too few
such life chances in Katine.

The most influential woman in the village has not gone to market. Back up
the road at the trading centre, Loyce Achao, former nurse and politician,
watches her customers pass and return with chickens strapped to their
bicycles and waits for business behind the pharmacy counter. On the wall to
the right of her head is a poster that has a profound resonance. It shows a
smiling young woman in cap and gown, brandishing a tassled degree
certificate. &quot;Look where self-respect and self-control have got me,&quot; it
says.

Clambering on the steps with a handful of groundnuts is little Ezra, 15
months old, the only child in the village with shoes and the son of Loyce's
daughter Brenda Achao - who unusually has her mother's surname. Most
children are given grandparents' surnames or the father's. Brenda fell
pregnant in her first year studying commerce at Makere University.

&quot;I told her after delivery to bring the baby to me and I will look after
him,&quot; she said. &quot;She brought him at six months.&quot;

Her other children are teachers and accountants. She has no intention of
letting Brenda drop out. Loyce, who cannot hide her anger that her own
husband has left her, says that life in Katine is hard on women, many of
whom have not had more than basic schooling.

&quot;The problem here is women have very low self-esteem. It is the men who
dominate everything.&quot;

Does she ever tell the men they are wrong? She smiles. &quot;I tell them they are
wrong.&quot;

She has painkillers and antibiotics and malaria tablets that have run out at
the health centre up the road. The clinical officers - three years of
medical training but not qualified doctors - tell their patients to go and
buy their drugs from her. But most of the people of the village, says Loyce
who used to be their elected representative on the district council,
struggle to pay and she gives pills on credit.

&quot;The community is very poor,&quot; she says. &quot;They do not have enough money to
buy drugs. They can't afford it unless they sell their chicken or they sell
their food.&quot;

[image: Katine: Students at Katine Primary School] Pupils at the primary
school in their distinctive pink dresses and shirts. For many their
education is partial - interrupted by family chores such as fetching water,
childminding, working in the fields, or simply through hunger.  You see
poverty most clearly in the torn and frayed children. Even many of those in
school have uniforms held together with safety pins. Two days after school
has broken up for the holidays, children are working at home and in the
fields in their bright pink or purple primary school dresses or shirts. It
is a stretch for families to afford uniforms at all and they have few other
clothes.

But on any schoolday at the wells and boreholes that are Katine's only
source of water, you see children who are poorer still. There is Martha
Akello, aged 8 and full of fun, pumping water from a borehole into one of
the ubiquitous yellow plastic jerry cans. She boldly says she is not in
school because the teachers gave them a day off to do marking and hoists 10
litres of water onto her head, holding a second 5-litre jerry can in her
hand, before setting off on the 3km walk home.

But her friend Sara Ayupo, two years older, thinner and smaller, struggles
to write her own name. If she is in school at all, and her rags suggest she
is not, she gets little from it. She's not the only one. It's hard to
concentrate when you are hungry. Most children eat just once a day, when
they get home around 5pm.

Along well-trodden paths through long grass, the girls and the women make
their way to the water - source of life for Katine and of sickness. There
are around eight wells, springs and boreholes. Most are contaminated.

A spring well that is a short march from the trading centre is blocked by
stones. The water no longer bubbles out of the ground but sits low and
fetid, a milky pond with concrete walls contaminated by faeces. It has been
that way for some eight months. Yet women keep arriving with huge jerry
cans, which they hold under the surface to fill.

Benna Acio has come for one of her several daily trips to get water for
herself and her eight children at home - a ninth is in secondary school in
Soroti. They drink it, cook with it and bathe in it, she says. &quot;I try to
boil it but if I don't have firewood we drink it as it is,&quot; she says. If it
rains - as it does every day in the rainy season - she can't get dry wood,
she says. Other people say they don't have pots to boil water.

There's a cleaner supply at a borehole not much further away, but families
using it must pay a maintenance charge. It's not much - just 1,000 shillings
a month (28p). But, says Benna, &quot;I can't afford to pay when the children
need books and school uniforms and food when they come home.&quot;

[image: Katine: Joyce Abuko and Rose Alelo] Joyce Abuko begins the long
walk home from one of the Katine sub-county wells, now submerged in flood
water, while Rose Alelo finds the source of the spring with her jerry
cans. This is not the only blocked spring well. At a second, on the
edge of swamp
land, there are tiny worms which women filling their cans use their hands to
push away, along with the algae. There are two further boreholes where worms
are said to be pumped up with the water. And another spring has been
completely flooded in the unusually persistent rains that should have
stopped by now. The swamp has overrun it. Women wade out up to their knees
to push their jerry cans under the swamp water surface at the spot where the
spring used to bubble out of the earth. This water brings disease -
bilharzia caused by parasitic worms and diarrhoea which can kill babies.

So it's hardly surprising that at the far end of the red road through Katine
from the market, Tiriri health centre is busy. In the morning, the waiting
room is thronged. The clinical officers - two of them are usually available
- see around a hundred out-patients a day. This is a level IV health centre
- the next best thing to a hospital.

On the wall at the entrance hangs a plaque celebrating its opening by First
Lady Janet Museveni on October 11 2006. It has a full operating theatre,
with shiny metal and glass equipment. There is an ether inhaler, an oxygen
concentrator, an ECG machine for monitoring the heart rate, an autoclave for
sterilisation. None of it has ever been used. The adjustable operating table
stands in a large empty space in the middle of the room gathering dust, a
huge inoperable lamp hovering above it.

[image: Katine health centre] The operating theatre in Katine's Tiriri
health centre. It was opened a year ago, but is unusable without water or
electricity. There are not enough drugs to treat malaria, which is
widespread, or to test for HIV. They are even short of disinfectant.  There
is no power. There has been no electricity supply, save for a few lights in
the wards linked to a small generator, since 2003, when the Lord's
Resistance Army cut the overhead wires and sold them for scrap. The cables
are now saucepans and the denuded wooden posts running up the red road are a
mockery. Government funds and aid money went into the refurbishing and
equipping of Tiriri health centre IV.

They built a white elephant.

Not only is there no power. The gleaming taps in the sluice rooms, wash
rooms and scrubbing-up room are dry and always have been. Tiriri has no
running water. Like the rest of Katine, the medical staff have to fetch
their water in jerry cans from a nearby borehole. They have small charcoal
stoves and firewood to boil it on the step outside the wards for sterilising
instruments and drinking.

Yet it has two ambulances. One is being used in another county. The other is
parked on the grass in the middle of the health centre compound. Every
morning the ambulance driver travels in from Soroti to start the engine and
listen to it ticking over. But he can't answer an emergency call. The
ambulance needs a service, without which he is not allowed to drive it. But
the health centre hasn't the 200,000 shillings (£56) to pay for it.

And so Dr Simon Oluka on only his second posting after medical school, the
only qualified doctor in the whole sub-county, is not to be found in his
prestigious principal health centre with its operating theatre which is as
useful as an empty chocolate box and its dispensary which is more often than
not denuded of useful drugs. There's little he can do there with his skills
and, he says, he has to share himself around, visiting a number of clinics
in the area. In fact, he is usually in Soroti, the main town 30km away,
which has the regional referral hospital.

Samuel Agom, 29, one of the three clinical officers at Tiriri, is acting
administrator and looks dazed by the end of the day. So do the handful of
nurses and midwives. &quot;We are overworked but we give them all the service we
are able,&quot; says Sam. &quot;Those we are not able, we refer them to Soroti.&quot;

The children's ward is the saddest. Malaria is responsible for nearly a
quarter of deaths in Katine. It most often takes babies and pregnant women.
Aids is a hidden killer, but everybody knows malaria. Even so, only the
maternity ward at the clinic has full bed nets. Few homes have them either.
Occasionally you see bed nets hung out to dry on thatched roofs in the
village, but they gape with holes.

[image: Katine: Bernard Alingu (2) suffers from severe dehydration]
Two-year-old
Bernard Alingu with his 16-year-old mother, Lucy Acen. Bernard was admitted
to the Tiriri health centre with severe dehydration. Contaminated water
causes disease and death in many children.  In the children's ward, listless
babies lie in their mother's arms with a drip in their heads.

Although there is supposed to be no charge for medical care, the hospital
has to ask patients to pay for the supplies that have not been delivered by
the authorities.

Parents of children with malaria have to buy the needle and pump for the
drip as well as drugs. The dispensary has just one box of quinine remaining.

&quot;We have not enough drugs,&quot; says Sam. In fact they have hardly any. They are
also out of HIV test kits, and even if they were able to diagnose it, they
couldn't treat it with the antiretroviral drugs which keep people well and
healthy in affluent countries and even now in many African cities. &quot;We would
wish to give ARVs,&quot; says Sam. &quot;But even with ordinary drugs the supply is
not consistent.&quot;

These drugs, which the UN is now straining to get to all Africans who need
them, have to be taken every day or the HIV virus will mutate and overwhelm
the patient once more, causing weakness, sickness and inevitable death. The
only hope for those with HIV in Katine is Soroti hospital, 30km away.

The midwives' needs are more basic but just as hard to come by. They want
disinfectant and mops, they say, and they have only two delivery kits left.
Around 60 women a month give birth at the health centre, some of them
crossing the swamp in labour, carried by two men.

But traditional birth attendants still find plenty of work. These are older
women in the village who have learned their trade through experience. There
has been an attempt to draw them into the healthcare system through some
basic training.

Josephine Achau, who says her age is possibly 70, now has a uniform, though
it has seen better days, and a tattered exercise book where she keeps her
records. She claims in many decades of helping women in labour that she has
never had a baby die. The clinic midwives, though, shake their heads in
general disapproval of the attendants, muttering that they do not always
refer women with complications to hospital early enough.

Some of those giving birth are mere girls of 14 or 15 - often married,
sometimes not. When a young unmarried girl gets pregnant, the man may be
accused of &quot;defilement&quot; - rape. The girl may be taken to his family who must
look after her until the baby is born. Then there will be negotiations over
possible marriage and the bride price, which is paid in cattle.

On the scrub grass stretching back from the red road to Katine primary
school's dilapidated classrooms, girls play netball with a passion. There
must be 60 or more on the unmarked pitch, charging as a pack with
enthusiastic cries from one end, which has a genuine netball post without a
net, to the other, which has only a metal pole. A goal seems to be scored
when somebody hits the top of it and everybody applauds, but nobody is
keeping count.

It's a rare interlude of childish exuberance for girls whose young lives are
dominated by the twice daily walk to the well and home, carrying heavy water
cans, and other domestic chores. Lack of money for uniforms is not the only
reason so many are not in school, says Santina Awio, head of girls.

&quot;Sometimes they remain to care for other children at home,&quot; she says. &quot;When
it is the rainy season, they stay to do agriculture. Before last year early
marriage was common for children not able to provide themselves with writing
materials.&quot;

But now the sub-county has passed a by-law, she says, placing a duty on
parents to send their children to school. She has not heard of an early
marriage since then, although it is hard to know whether attendance has
improved. Nobody seems sure how many children are on the roll.

Head teacher Didimus Emiru, who was moved here seven months ago from another
school in a reshuffle nobody can explain, wrestles with the registers. There
used to be 653 children, he says. By the afternoon he has concluded there
are now 506, of whom 260 are boys and 246 girls.

The by-law doesn't specify the age at which children may leave, says
Santina, but primary education is free. So is the first year of secondary
school, but some children linger on to 14 or 15, unable to pass the primary
leaving examination in social studies, maths, English and science. Some sit
in the classroom staring into space. They cannot afford exercise books or
pens.

And yet Santina says things have improved. &quot;When I was at school there was
not as much advice as there is now for the girls. Many people now like
girls' education. Many are able to get at least somewhere and earn their own
living.&quot; Her parents believed in education for girls, she says, and sent her
to teacher training college after her O-levels. Now she is married to
another teacher at the school and they live in a house in the grounds with
their five children.

She does what she can for her girl pupils. Those who start menstruating were
staying at home, so she used the school budget to buy sanitary towels and
encouraged them to come to class.

But other problems are harder to overcome - the need for them to look after
younger children while their parents work and the distraction of hunger.
&quot;There is no food in school,&quot; she says, and the children have had no
breakfast. &quot;They try to learn but their stomach will be crying. They escape
to eat at one o'clock and don't come back.&quot;

The school now has a garden where they grow potatoes and beans - but that
provides food only in the third school term in October and November.

Didimus complains of the tumble-down classrooms. Several are missing part of
a wall. And the teachers' accommodation is inadequate. Only three are brick
houses - the rest are grass huts. Seven families share three toilets. It's
no different from most of Katine, but it doesn't attract talented teachers
to make the journey up the red road from town to teach here.

The secondary school next door, the only one in 25,000-strong Katine
sub-county, is an aspiration too far for most children. It offers three
years of education. In the first year, which the government now subsidises,
there are 82 pupils - 57 boys and 25 girls. In the second year, there are
just 12 pupils, evenly divided. In the third year, there are nine, of whom
seven are boys and just two are girls.

[image: Okezo Moses (8) with his toy car] Eight-year-old Okezo Moses has
little except enthusiasm and imagination. This is his toy car. He says that
today it is a white Toyota pickup truck. When he grows up he wants to be a
motor mechanic.  Anybody who wants to take O-levels, in the fourth year, and
has parents who can afford it, must go to Soroti. On the last day of term
you see them cycling the 30km back home, mattress on the back of the bike,
from their rented room in town.

It troubles Matthias Obella, 68, a retired former primary head teacher who
now chairs the secondary school PTA. &quot;How can a girl live in accommodation
in a town alone?&quot; he asks colleagues. &quot;How can she be safe? It is putting a
goat among the hyenas.&quot;

They would like their school to offer the O-level year, but it's hard to
imagine a substantial take-up. Fees are 45,000 shillings (£12.74) a term,
uniforms - immaculate, pressed white shirts and blue trousers or skirts (no
rips and safety pins here) - cost around 10,000 (£2.83). The PTA is now
trying to persuade parents to contribute 15,000 (£4.24) a term so the
students can eat at midday.

Yet some are still struggling with the basics. &quot;Many come and they just sit
there in class and when you ask what is the problem, they say I don't have
books or a pen,&quot; says head teacher Simon Eromgu.

The young people sitting under a tree on the last day of term, being
lectured by PTA members, teachers, the head and any other dignitary who
cares to weigh in, are Katine's best hope for the future. Their elders
exhort them to do their best. But there are so few of them, in their smart
white shirts, and so many thin and tattered girls and boys who will not get
even this far and for whom a short and brutal life of physical hard labour,
dawn to dusk, threatened by disease and, for the girls, the very real risk
of dying in childbirth, is the only expectation.

Katine is one of the poorest and most deprived places on the planet. Its
people ask very little but offer all they have - hospitality, warmth,
friendliness and willingness to help. This is the village where the Guardian
hopes to transform lives and prospects. In three years time, Katine and its
sub-county should have taken some sizeable steps into the 21st century. It
may be a very different place.

Whether the story has a happy ending will be for the people of Katine to
judge.
