1. &quot;The Flaw in the Plan&quot;

At the end, Harry plans to return the Elder Wand to DD's tomb and die
undefeated, thus ending the power of the Deathstick.

But this cunning plan seems virtually suicidal. Harry became master of
the wand simply by disarming Malfoy, who had never even touched it. So
surely anybody who disarmed Harry in the future, or killed him, or beat
him at chess, would  become the new master of the Elder wand.

Further, Harry *explains* all this to the watching crowd during his duel
with Voldemort. Which means, presumably, that everyone in the Wizarding
World knows exactly how to do it. The legend is right: the wand makes
you way too gabby for your own good.

2. &quot;It only took Alexander ten years. And he didn't know magic&quot;

Dumbledore is about 150 years old in Book One. That means he met
Grindelwald in 1860 (give or take a few years). At this time, the two
made their plans to seek out the Deathly Hallows and establish a New
Wizarding Order for the &quot;greater good&quot;. After the death of Ariana,
Grindelwald departs alone to undertake this plan.

Eventually he finds the Deathstick (while still a &quot;merry youth&quot;) and
begins to build his new order. Dumbledore, still sympathetic to his
erstwhile friend, waits until it would be shameful not to act against
this would be conqueror. Eventually however,  he must act and finally
defeats Grindelwald..... in 1945.

This means that Grindelwald spent 85 years just getting his Dark
Wizarding empire rolling. And he didn't even conquer the world. He just
mucked around in Eastern Europe for a while. No wonder Dumbledore didn't
feel there was an urgency in fighting him.

3. &quot;Putting the Dumb back in Dumbledore&quot;

Grindlewald may have been slow, but at least he actually managed to find
one of the Deathly Hallows. Albus Dumbledore, on the other hand,
greatest wizard of the age, could not locate one of Lord Voldemort's
horcruxes hidden..... just a little ways down the corridor from his office.

Of course, he only had a mere FOUR DECADES to look for it. Merlin's
pants, I'm surprised Voldemort didn't just hide it under the
headmaster's desk.

lol, loved your &quot;putting the Dumb back in Dumbledore&quot;. Well, to answer
why this error was made, we naturally have to pull out the good, old
'thematic' card. JKR *had* to end the HP saga at Hogwarts. That was
the right decision from a thematic point of view. We had spent six
books coming to know and love the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and
Wizardry. Like they said for sonatas in music during the Classical
era, you must begin at home (the exposition section), go away from
home (the development section) and then finally return home
(recapitulation section), to have the proper sonata structure play
out. Well, Hogwarts has been 'home' for HP, and for all his readers,
all of this time. To have the climactic showdown between evil and good
anywhere else would have been quite unthinkable. Notice how JKR made
the homecoming sweeter by having the core trio stay away from Hogwarts
for most of the duration of the book, so that when the catharsis of
going back to Hogwarts finally arrived toward the end, it gave us all
a high of getting to see the familair again.

So one of the Horcruxes *had* to be hidden at Hogwarts. Otherwise, why
would HP, Hermione and Ron go back there? Sure, if that forced JKR to
put the Dumb back in Dumbledore, that was just one of those
inconvenient somethings that she would have to live with.

I agree with you on this.  The owners, save Dumbledore, have been very
chatty about the fact that they own the Elder Wand.  Granted, Harry is
telling Voldemort, and everyone else, this to emphasize how much of an idiot
LV has been.  Is JKR perhaps leaving a door open?  We can only hope.  Okay,
enough wishful thinking.  Remember that Harry wanted to put the Elder Wand
back in Dumbledore's tomb, and only Ron and Hermione knew that he was going
to do this.  So, if anyone did defeat Harry, they still would have
difficulty obtaining the wand.  The simple solution would be to make it
impossible to retrieve the wand from the tomb.  Permanently seal the tomb,
modify Ron and Hermione's memories about its location, or better yet, weight
it down and drop it in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean.

The real problem though is that none of this helps Harry. Anyone can
still kill him and become the master of the Elder wand.

And with the full resources of magic, surely there is some way to find
and recover your own wand, no matter where it is.

Granted, there may be no good solution. The Deathstick is probably
indestructable. If Harry had it, he would still have to worry about
backstabbers. If he doesn't have it.... well, out of sight is out of
mind. Maybe people will just forget about it.

Yeah, right.

Well, you're right, they had to return to Hogwarts. I think we all
expected it.

But surely there was some way to get them back there without requiring
Dumbledore to pass by the diadem six times a day, every day for
thirty-five years without having a clue it was there. Dumbledore was
supposed to be this colossus,  this great legendary thing. And yet
Voldemort gains.

I can think of an easy way to get them back even without a horcrux
there. Once they lose the sword, they can go back simply to get basilisk
fangs to destroy the horcruxes they find elsewhere. They did that
anyway, after all.

Book Seven seems to be annoyingly free from obvious nits or problems.
But I found a couple more &quot;semi-nits&quot;:

4. &quot;Just make sure your balance doesn't slip below a thousand Galleons.&quot;

Bellatrix Lestrange is a convicted multiple murderer. Her last act
before her capture was torturing Aurors Frank and Alice Longbottom into
insanity. She is complicite in the murders of goblins and is the
lieutenant of a Dark Lord who values all non-wizard lives at naught and
who has, in fact, personally broken into Gringott's and attempted to
steal an item of value. In Deathly Hallows Belletrix even imprisons a
goblin and mutilates him for no particular reason.

And yet, when Hermione arrives at Gringott's impersonating her, the head
goblin's only comment about her is:  'very old family..... old clients'
as he deferently hurries to help this old and valued customer down to
her vault.

Even for bankers this is a bit much. Well, okay. Maybe not.

On the upside, I suppose it means that Harry won't have any trouble
getting gold out of his vault, robbery and escape by dragon or no. The
goblin on duty will just respectfully show him to his gold. 'Good day,
sir, and thank you for banking with Gringott's'.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------

5.  &quot;As Eihwaz going to St. Ives, I met a man with seven lives&quot;

The Tales of Beedle the Bard is written in runes and this, according to
Lovegood, makes it the original version. This would imply that the tales
are written in Anglo-Saxon, which Hermione has apparently translated
with the help of her Spellman's Syllabary.

Leaving aside the question of why a syllabary would be useful for
deciphering Anglo-Saxon runes, if the tales are in Anglo-Saxon, that
implies that Ignotus Peverell lived no later than, let's say, 1100 AD.

In that case, his gravestone is one of the oldest legible standing grave
markers in Britain. And it begs the question, why is there still room in
this churchyard for Harry's parents? Even if only wizards are buried
there, in nine centuries, that's still a lot of bodies piling up.

(Okay, this is a cheap nit. The runes are obviously there to suggest a
particular mythological idea, not to establish a date. Never the less,
it is a bit of a nit and is hearby officially picked.)

Given that they are translated by a book called *Spellman's*

Or 1700AD, which is a more plausible date, given Newton's lifetime,
and the activities of people like Hans Christian Anderson and the

Lovegood's word about them being original? This is the man who
believes in the existence of the Crumple-Horned Snorcack, remember?
HCA and Grimm were mainly collecting and recording traditional folk
tales that until then had been told and passed on purely orally, so
what's to say that Beedle didn't do exactly the same?

In many old graveyards, burial was only for a couple of decades. You
(more accurately, your family) had to be seriously rich to avoid being
dug up after at most a century and your bones moved to the catacombs,
or simply ground down for glue (they'd save the skull, though).

Good point. I can offer no really convincing counter-argument to this,

It's in character for Voldemort.

When possible, Voldemort seems to have liked to hide his horcruxes
near where he had triumphed.
He had gotten away with something in the sea cave: locket.
He had successfully murdered his father's side of the family and
pinned the murder on his other relatives, involving the Gaunt house:
the ring.
The diary was in the hands of his most rabid supporter (until she
was arrested, and it wound up in her brother-in-law's hands).
The cup was in a bank vault.
The tiara? Well, he had successfully gotten away with a murder
using his famous ancestor's hidden secret which he had found,
in Howarts: where better to hide a horcruxed relic of another
Hogwarts founder than in Hogwarts?

Problem with that is that Hogwarts has been around for a thousand
years itself... so 1100 ad is probably a bit conservative since
Gryffindor was descended from the Peverells.

As for the gravestone being the oldest in Britain... this *is* the
gravestone of a magical family!

With regards space... this is a village/hamlet where wizards live.
They could well have magically enhanced the place to leave space for
their own... or magically enlarged it in some way... or (more likely)
they simply re-use some plots for new burials.

People were forever burying people in the nave of churches... and then
digging then up and moving them out to make room for more people :)

No idea :) I think I was mixing up Ignotus and Godric somehow... can't
find it in the interviews stuff either so lord knows why I thought
that.

otoh... we *do know Harry Was... related :)

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albus_Severus_Potter#Albus_Severus_Potter

Voldemort and Harry share Peverell ancestry, making them distantly
related.[4] It is believed that the Potters were descended from the
youngest brother, Ignotus, due to their possession of the Invisibility
Cloak, while it is believed that the Gaunts were descended from
Cadmus, the middle brother. This is due to their ownership of the
Resurrection Stone, though it is possible that they came into
possession of the Stone through other means than inheritance, calling
their descent from Cadmus Peverell into question.

&gt;Dumbledore is about 150 years old in Book One. That means he met

&gt;defeats Grindelwald..... in 1945.

&gt;This means that Grindelwald spent 85 years just getting his Dark

&gt;era, you must begin at home (the exposition section), go away from

&gt;out. Well, Hogwarts has been 'home' for HP, and for all his readers,
&gt;all of this time. To have the climactic showdown between evil and good
&gt;anywhere else would have been quite unthinkable. Notice how JKR made
&gt;the homecoming sweeter by having the core trio stay away from Hogwarts
&gt;for most of the duration of the book, so that when the catharsis of
&gt;going back to Hogwarts finally arrived toward the end, it gave us all

&gt; &gt; 5.  &quot;As Eihwaz going to St. Ives, I met a man with seven lives&quot;

&gt; &gt; The Tales of Beedle the Bard is written in runes and this, according
&gt; &gt; to Lovegood, makes it the original version. This would imply that
&gt; &gt; the
&gt; &gt; tales are written in Anglo-Saxon, which Hermione has apparently
&gt; &gt; translated with the help of her Spellman's Syllabary.
&gt; &gt; Leaving aside the question of why a syllabary would be useful for
&gt; &gt; deciphering Anglo-Saxon runes, if the tales are in Anglo-Saxon, that
&gt; &gt; implies that Ignotus Peverell lived no later than, let's say, 1100
&gt; &gt; AD.

&gt; Given that they are translated by a book called *Spellman's*
&gt; Syllabary, why do you think the stories are written in Anglo-Saxon
&gt; runes? I think it's much more likely they are written in wizarding
&gt; runes, which may resemble the alchemical symbols used even by Isaac
&gt; Newton.
&gt; Or 1700AD, which is a more plausible date, given Newton's lifetime,
&gt; and the activities of people like Hans Christian Anderson and the
&gt; Brothers Grimm round about that time. And why do we take Xeno
&gt; Lovegood's word about them being original? This is the man who
&gt; believes in the existence of the Crumple-Horned Snorcack, remember?
&gt; HCA and Grimm were mainly collecting and recording traditional folk
&gt; tales that until then had been told and passed on purely orally, so
&gt; what's to say that Beedle didn't do exactly the same?
">

It is a nice idea. In fact I think I like your idea better than the
reality.

Unfortunately this is a nitpicking thread, so I have to point out that
Hermione studied &quot;Ancient Runes&quot;, not &quot;Neoclassical Runes&quot;. In
addition, in OotP, iirc, she mentions that she was worried that she
mistook eihwaz (reverse 'Z' &quot;yew&quot;) for ehwaz (M &quot;horse&quot;) on her OWL.
(Although it is hard to see how you would actually make that mistake,
now that you bring it up. Better make that a retroactive nitpick to
OotP.)

Anyway, it seems clear that the 'runes' used in the tales must be one
of the Futhark alphabets. Further, since Hermione needed to refer to
her Spellman's Syllabary it also seems clear that the tales are not
written in modern English, but using a runic alphabet. If it were,
then Hermione would simply have transliterated them.

And finally, since it seems pretty unlikely that Hermione translated
The Tales of Beedle the Bard from Old Norse, I am forced to conclude
that the tales were most probably written in Anglo-Saxon.

Which is a pity, because I think the best date for the Peverell
brothers to meet Death would be in 1348, when Death was just beginning
his extended stay in England. I guess it is just barely possible that
runes could have hung on that long in the Wizarding World. Wizards are
pretty traditional after all.

Dumbledore did know about it - he mentions in GoF that it turned into
a room full of chamberpots one night when he needed the toilet. (A

Actually, LV Controlled snakes and the Basilisk (even then I'd imagine
as he's a parseltongue).  Remember Harry could control the snake
during the duel?  Since Parseltongue is really rare, having the
basilisk guard the Horcrux would prevent a lot of people from getting
it; that's even if they did manage to find and open the chamber . . .
and to do that they needed to know Parseltongue again.  So basically,
only a Slytherin would really (other than Harry) be able to
theoretically find and open the chamber.   Since most Slytherin are
followers of Voldy, he could hide it there with strict words going out
that whomever tried to open the chamber would die by his hand.  That
would pretty much stop his Slytherins to even look for it, so when you
think about it, it really is a good place to hide the horcruxes; not
to mention the enchantments on the school where outsiders cannot get
in without being invited there.

Yeah, there is a saying that the best place to hide something is in
plain sight.

But it isn't true. :)

The best place to hide something is in a small cave facing the ocean and
accessible only at low tide--- and then only from a small pile of rocks
that would require superb mountaineering skill to reach. Inside the
cave, put the item behind a door that only someone of prodigious magical
skill could find. Then put additional protection in place to kill anyone
capable of finding it.

Now that's how you hide an item!

Dragon guarded vaults? Also good. Secret chamber that opens when
addressed in language known only to you? Superb. Dumping item on statue
in room available to anyone who needs to hide something? Not really
optimal. Giving item to Lucius Malfoy and asking him to keep an eye on
it? Priceless.

Hiding something in plain sight is only a good idea in books. That way
when the author reveals where the item was hidden, you kick yourself and
say: &quot;I should have thought of that&quot;.

But what you don't want is, when you read the reveal, to feel a impulse
to kick the author and say: &quot;I did think of that---- but rejected it as
too dumb.&quot;

Yeah; some great spot; right where you have a past and anyone with
brains could figure it out.  Personally, I'd hide something in a place
I'd never been, a place nobody would guess at in a million years and
then do the spells/charms.  Perhaps ANTARTICA!  LOL

remember Nagini was in plain sight too.  As was Harry.  but we all
guess that right?  So better idea to do something innocuous like an
old boot (though I guess someone might accidentally change it to a
portkey). LOL

Well, though we guessed at Harry it wasn't really dumb.

Another good way to hide a Horcrux would be to move them every so
often (just so long as you remember where you moved them to).  I
always thought V was a moron.  The fact he hides his stuff related to
his past and the fact that he makes horcruxes people might guess at
because of his need for power isn't brilliant.

6. &quot;Oh, Fudge!&quot;

Cornelius Fudge's ministry spent a whole year desperately trying to
discredit Albus Dumbledore. Yet they somehow managed to overlook the
potentially embarrassing fact that Dumbledore's father was sent to
Azkaban for attacking Muggles.

7. &quot;Loony, Loony Lupin&quot;

At the begining of the battle of Hogwarts, Lupin is preparing to take
groups of fighters out into the grounds to fight the Death Eaters.

Perhaps Lupin in not familiar with the concept of 'siege'. When you
are greatly outnumbered by deadly foes, and your only advantage is a
powerfully fortified castle, STAY IN THE DAMN CASTLE! That's what your
wizarding ancestors built it for, at considerable expense.

&gt;&gt; Actually, isn't there a saying where if you want to hide something,

&gt; Yeah, there is a saying that the best place to hide something is in
&gt; plain sight.

&gt; But it isn't true. :)

&gt; The best place to hide something is in a small cave facing the ocean
&gt; and accessible only at low tide--- and then only from a small pile
&gt; of
&gt; rocks that would require superb mountaineering skill to reach.
&gt; Inside
&gt; the cave, put the item behind a door that only someone of prodigious
&gt; magical skill could find. Then put additional protection in place to
&gt; kill anyone capable of finding it.

&gt; Now that's how you hide an item!

&gt; Dragon guarded vaults? Also good. Secret chamber that opens when
&gt; addressed in language known only to you? Superb. Dumping item on
&gt; statue in room available to anyone who needs to hide something? Not
&gt; really optimal. Giving item to Lucius Malfoy and asking him to keep
&gt; an eye on it? Priceless.

&gt; Hiding something in plain sight is only a good idea in books. That
&gt; way
&gt; when the author reveals where the item was hidden, you kick yourself
&gt; and say: &quot;I should have thought of that&quot;.

&gt; But what you don't want is, when you read the reveal, to feel a
&gt; impulse to kick the author and say: &quot;I did think of that---- but
&gt; rejected it as too dumb.&quot;

Actually, I do remember thinking that the mention of all the stuff
Harry piled up to mark the place where he hid his potion book oddly
signifigcant when I first read it.

That happened about 140 years ago, and it wasn't particularly relevant
to Dumbledore's claims that LV was back. Besides, if they'd pointed
out the apparent hypocrisy of Dumbledore's father attacking Muggles
when Dumbledore himself has a pro-Muggle stance, it would be much
easier for Dumbledore to highlight the Ministry's own, more recent

when the defenders stay in the castle, and the attackers stay outside,

someone to betray them. This is not what is happening at Hogwarts - it
is an assault situation, in which mobile raiding/response parties to

First of all, Aragorn did not attack the orcish &quot;flank&quot;. His &quot;small
party&quot; (Lol, Aragorn and Gimli) simply jumped onto the causeway to
disrupt the orcish ram assault until the gate could be reinforced.
Then they got back inside tout de suite. This is, I guess, a &quot;sortie&quot;
in the technical sense.

But it is hardly the same thing as leading a group out into the
Hogwart's grounds to fight Death Eaters in the open. When Lupin should
have been concentrating his force on the decisive point of the
assault, he was instead dividing the weak defending force for
pointless counterattacks.

&gt; party&quot; (Lol, Aragorn and Gimli) simply jumped onto the causeway to
&gt; disrupt the orcish ram assault until the gate could be reinforced.

Precisely - the flank of the group manning the ram.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Then they got back inside tout de suite. This is, I guess, a
&gt; &quot;sortie&quot;
&gt; in the technical sense.

&gt; But it is hardly the same thing as leading a group out into the
&gt; Hogwart's grounds to fight Death Eaters in the open. When Lupin
&gt; should
&gt; have been concentrating his force on the decisive point of the
&gt; assault, he was instead dividing the weak defending force for
&gt; pointless counterattacks.
">

We know they had people covering the secret passages, presumably
they'd also send people to cover other choke-points, such as the
gates, and signifigcant points with good observation, such as the lake
shore and Hagrid's hut.

It's doctrine - do you want to take up 15 fighters and shoot down
twenty bombers before they drop their bombs, or do you wait until
you've got 50 fighters assembled, and shoot down all the bombers after
they've dropped their bombs? Do you want to take out half a dozen
fighters and prevent a small number of attackers from presssing home,
or do you wait until all the atackers are up close and doing serious
damage and then zap them all? Zapping takes time, best to do it before
damage starts, not while it's happening.

Gringotts basically acknowledges the new dispensation at this point -

Yes, but it looks as if the Lestrange vault has been maintained
throughout Belletrix's 15 imprisonment. While it is not 100% clear
that the cup has been there the whole time, this seems to be the
implication.

I'm sorry, I simply can't agree that jumping next to orcs at the gate
is a &quot;flanking&quot; attack in any military sense.

Gandalf and Eomer's relief of the siege of Helm's Deep----- that's a
flanking attack. The orcs even had to redeploy their troops to meet
it. The Ride of the Rohirrim was also a flanking attack.  Even the
surrounding of the Army of the West at the Battle of the Black Gate
would involve &quot;flank&quot; attacks by the Mordor troops.

But a couple of guys jumping next to a bunch of other guys? It's just
a melee. Perhaps a coup de main, if you wanted to dignify it a little

Returning to Lupin's tactics, the strategic goal for the Order was to
secure Hogwarts until Harry could search, while minimizing casualties
and leaving open an escape route. With greatly superior forces on the
Death Eater side, the best way for the Order to achieve this goal was
to accept a regular siege and shelter themselves within the
fortifications of the castle.

That's assuming the Giants haven't already pulverized it!
Perhaps Lupin's sortie took out a few of the giants before they reached the

Perhaps the 20 bombers shot down by the limited number of planes saved
key war production facilites from being destroyed.
Man, you've got ALOT to learn about defensive strategy!
