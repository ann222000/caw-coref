Technology and modern conveniences can be a wonderful thing. But when they don't work the way they are designed, they can definitely be frustrating.

Don't even get me started on computers and all the problems associated with them. I think I've already had to reboot mine three times while trying to write this.

But in our world, filled with technological advancements, vending machines are wonderful and useful and very convenient tools. After all, we can purchase various different products at any time of the day or night, and not have to deal with that incredibly annoying and slow clerk behind a counter.

Then, as a vendor, you can move your merchandise in many more locations, without having to worry about the expense and overhead of a store or paying individuals a salary to manage, work and occupy the establishment.

No, you just set your machine in place, and let the money (literally) role in.

Yeah, sounds simple enough.

But when one of those machines are not properly maintained or stocked, it can be one of the most irritating nuisances on the face of this earth, and when they do not function properly, they can transform the most calm and peaceful person into a complete lunatic, psychopath or even potentially homicidal maniac.

Take this recent incident for example;

While waiting for one of my uncle's treatments, I decided to go to the next building, to the vending machines and just grab a nice refreshing soda pop. A simple task that I have done on numerous occasions.

However, on this day, it appears as though the planets were not in line, and the earth was not in perfect rotation, and the wrath of the vending machine gods were obviously against me.

Now a relatively new frustration I've experienced with some vending machines is the fact that many of them now do not have an easily visual indication as to how much the product actually does cost. And another flaw as I can see it, is that they also do not display whether or not a product is even available, or &quot;sold out&quot;, until after you have already inserted your money. &quot;Nice trick, Mr. Vending Machine Engineer Dude.&quot;

So when I take out my semi-crumpled dollar bill, and I place it in the bill feeder slot, and it makes that whirring noise, and it starts to take it, there is that slight pause of anticipation we all go through as to whether or not it is actually going to accept the money, or spit it back out. Then we take the next aggravating moments out of our lives trying to refresh and renew a simple dollar bill. And I never can seem to remember to carry my iron and ironing board around with me, everywhere I go. And that's when I come to the realization that the annoying clerk behind the counter of the local convenience store may not be all that bad after all, and that they would most certainly take that dollar, no matter how bad it looked, or not matter how wrinkled or crumpled it may be. And it's those times when I actually miss those annoying counter clerks.

So we take that dollar and run it along side the hard edge of the vending machine or any other sharp, flat surface in an attempt to flatten out all the wrinkles, hoping that will appease the vending machine gods and satisfy the highly technological brain inside of the incredibly retarded machine. And then we wonder, what does the machine actually want? Did it tell us? Is smoothing this bill out actually going to work? Is there some magical formula that it is looking for? Is George Washington's face just slightly too blurred? Or is it the fact that the bill is faded and is just not a sufficient shade of green enough for the sensitive sensors inside the machine?

The point is, we really don't know why it did not accept the bill. We can only assume. But most of us have learned by trial and error that the machines do tend to have more problems with whether or not the bill is smooth or stiff enough to pass through the mechanical rollers of the feeder mechanism. (&quot;Oh what did I do with that iron and that can of spray starch?&quot;) Oh well....

So we smooth and we smooth and we smooth, and we finally get the bill flat enough for that annoying vending machine to finally accept that bill, and hopefully display some lights or any indication that it's ready, and we can now select a product.

Sometimes I think it should be like a slot machine in Vegas, with all kinds of flashing lights and bells, rewarding us for our efforts. Or like we just won the big prize on &quot;The Wheel of Fortune&quot;. We jump up and down, the crowd cheers, Pat Sajak shakes your hand and Vanna White comes running over to give you a big hug and a kiss. (Okay, so maybe that's just my fantasy.)

But no, we don't really win anything, other than the satisfaction to know that the mechanical clerk accepts our money, and we just might hear a click or see a simple display to let us know that it took the correct amount of money we inserted.

So I put my bill up to the metal lips of the money-eating monster. Miraculously, it actually slides in perfectly, sucks it up and I never see it again. However there were no bells and flashing lights and Vanna White was nowhere around. But there is only the little digital display that now reads &quot;1.00&quot;, indicating that I did actually feed one dollar into the system, and now it's ready for the next step.

Not having any displays of how much any of the particular sodas actually cost, I decide to go ahead and try pressing a button, just to see if one dollar was enough. Trying to monitor my sugar input, I reach down to the lower part of the machine and I press the button adjacent to the Diet Dr. Pepper, hoping to hear that familiar &quot;clunkity-clunk&quot;, and have my pre-fizzed cold soda tumble and drop down into that annoying anti-theft chute. You know the one where you almost have to be a contortionist just to get your bottle out.

But no, there was no sound at all, and now the display that previously read &quot;1.00&quot; now displayed, &quot;1.25&quot;. Okay, certainly it did not just give me an extra twenty-five cents, and we have to assume that it's not displaying how much I entered, but now is displaying how much it really wants before it will release a product into my possession. Of course we have to assume. Because I couldn't find an instruction manual anywhere printed on the equipment, so I just have to go with my own advanced intellect. Because I am certainly smarter than a soda vending machine, right? Of course now I'm having my doubts as to whether or not I am even more intelligent than a door-knob, and a vending machine now clearly has me intellectually dominated.

So I decide to pull out the next flimsy and dilapidated dollar bill out of my pocket and start the whole process all over again. Wondering, will it even accept this other dollar bill now?

Well, as I placed it up to the bill feeder, it made no noise of motion whatsoever, and like trying to feed strained beets to a fussy and picky baby, it just sat there, completely resilient to all my efforts to insert the money into it's metal lips.

So I found another dollar bill and tried again. It still did not budge or take my next bill. &quot;Maybe it's full?&quot; Or this baby doesn't like strained beets, and I had no other change in my pocket.

Well, thankfully, all was not lost and there was a change machine directly behind me. So I turned around, inserted my dollar bill, and it took it and returned my efforts with the wonderful clankity-clang of that ever familiar and beautiful sound of change dropping into the small tray, with three quarters, two dimes, and a nickel. &quot;Yay! I finally won something.&quot; And since there was nobody around, I even gave a cute little dance of excitement. (But still no Vanna White.)

I scooped out and grabbed my handful of change and quickly turned around and dropped a quarter into the soda vending machine where it accepted it, and now displayed the &quot;1.25&quot; on the LED readout. Finally, I was there, and I was going to be rewarded for my efforts in the form of a nice cold refreshing soda-pop.

I again reached down and pressed the button adjacent to the picture of the Diet Dr. Pepper. But I heard no sound. I looked up and noticed a small red light was now illuminated next to the LED readout. The red light was labeled, &quot;Sold Out&quot;. Then, flashing on the digital LED readout was the message, &quot;SOLd&quot;, then followed with, &quot;OUt&quot;. &quot;Okay, I get the point.&quot; I was naturally disappointed. But there were other options, and I'm not that picky. So I pressed the button adjacent to the refreshing picture of a Diet Coca-Cola, with the little water droplets and ice crystals on the side of the bottle.

Again, nothing, and the same message displayed. There was another button for Diet Coca-Cola, so I tried it, but with only the same results. I was starting to get a little frustrated.

Now it was down to being forced to buy one of the other products loaded with sugar, but again, I'm not that picky, and artificial sweeteners are not all that good for us either, so I tried the regular Dr. Pepper, and nothing. The regular Coca-Cola, and nothing. I tried them all. I tried the Sprite, and even the other two items that I couldn't even identify. Some kind of weird citrus drink, and a power drink.

But every product I tried was &quot;SOLd&quot; &quot;OUt&quot;.

&quot;SOLd&quot; &quot;OUt&quot;.

&quot;SOLd&quot; &quot;OUt&quot;.

The annoying message kept flashing. Flashing directly at me, as if the machine were now laughing at me.

Flashing across every pore of my skin, and I could almost even feel it.

And now flashing it's way deep into my brain. The red flashing error message was like a laser burning into my synapses.

It was like somebody tapping you on the shoulder, a reminder every time it blinked, &quot;You're an idiot!&quot;, &quot;You're an idiot!&quot;, &quot;You're an idiot!&quot;

Then I realized that the flashing red message was actually a neurological trigger. It was a trick of the vending machine gods, and I was now turning into Mr. Hyde, and I was about to get into a fight with an inanimate object. And the fact that the machine was inanimate, and nothing was moving, was actually my problem. But I refrained, and contained my rage, and just decided to give in, accept my failure, and now just attempt to reclaim my investment. I was just hoping that the machine actually did contain the money I had put into it, and would actually refund it back to me. Yep, we've all been there before too. Looking at that &quot;Change Return&quot; button, wondering, Will it work?&quot;

So I cringed as I pressed the coin return button, and for a moment there was nothing. I was about to explode. So I pressed the button again, and finally I heard it.

A single &quot;clang&quot;, as the LED display actually changed from &quot;1.25&quot; to &quot;1.20&quot;. A single nickel had dropped into the change tray. A slight pause, and then another &quot;clang&quot; as another nickel dropped, and the display subtracted another five cents off of the total amount.

One by one, each nickel dropped, as I shook my head in disbelief, until the machine had actually performed correctly and returned to me a total of twenty-five shiny new nickels. Quite a handful, I must say. So I scooped all of my nickels out of that evil mechanical device and began contemplating my next course of action.

Not having any luck with that particular machine, I then turned my attention to another machine right next to it. There were no sodas, but only various selections of bottled water.

For a moment I paused, wondering if I should go through the whole endeavor again. If they had not maintained the one machine, how could I be sure if there was any product in the other? I pondered for a moment, and decided to go ahead and give it a try. After all, I had developed quite a thirst after my ordeal in dealing with the first machine, and I now had twenty-five shiny new nickels to dispose of.

So one by one, I inserted each nickel. Like the sound of a pin-ball machine as each nickel clinked, and clanked and zigzagged down and into the intestines of machine. One by one the display on that machine increased in five-cent increments, until I had finally inserted all twenty-five nickels.

Well, I would tell you what happened next, but I think it would just be a waste of time. Or I'll save it for another day. Besides, my finger is getting tired.

But I was actually surprised to discover that I actually do have a WiFi signal here in my cell.

And, although this jacket is pretty tight, I was still able to sneak one finger out of the folds of material and pluck out this message.

So my room is fairly cozy, and the jacket is nice and snug and warm,

But I am finding myself incredibly thirsty.
