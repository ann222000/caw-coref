Dear All,

In response to a msg of mine, Alan M. wrote a meditation of sorts on
immortality, which I found very moving, and it spoke to me
personally.  But that thread got hijacked by politics, so I am going
to post this separately.  It is topical.

[This is from "Letters to a Nation:  A Collection of Extraordinary
American Letters", edited by Andrew Carroll.  (The following, when
originally posted online, was truncated and mutilated by the poster,
(shame!) so I hope I was able to put back every single word.]

*Background:  Sandy Kempner, a former Peace Corps volunteer from
Galveston, TX, was sent to Vietnam in July 1966 to serve with the
Marines.  He wrote this letter to his great-aunt:

"20 Oct 66

Dear Aunt Fannie,

This morning, my platoon and I were finishing a three-day patrol.
Struggling over steep hills covered with hedgerows, trees, and
generally impenetrable jungle, one of my men turned to me and pointed
a hand, filled with cuts and scratches, at a rather distinguished-
looking plant with soft red flowers waving in the downpour (which I
said had been going on ever since the patrol began) and said: "That is
the first plant I have seen today which didn't have thorns on it.  I
iimmediately thought of you.

The plant and the hill upon which it grew, was also representative of
Vietnam.  It is a country of thorns and cuts, of guns and marauding,
of little hope and of great failure.  Yet in the midst of it all, a
beautiful thought, gesture, and even person can arise among it waving
bravely at the death that pours down upon it. Some day this hill will
be burned by napalm, and the red flower will crackle up and die among
the thorns.  So what was the use of living and being a beauty among
the beasts, if it must, in the end, die because of them, and with
them? This is a question which is answered by Gertrude Stein's "A rose
is a rose is a rose".  You are what you are, what you are. Whether you
believe in God, fate, or the crumbling cookie, elements are so mixed
in a being that make him what he is: his salvation from the thorns
around him lies in the fact that he existed at all, in his very own
personality.  There was once a time when the Jewish idea of heaven and
hell was the thoughts people had of you after you died.  But what if
the plant was on an isolated hill and never was seen by anyone?  That
is like the question of whether a falling tree makes a sound in the
forest primeval when no one is there to hear it.  It makes a sound,
and the plant was beautiful and the thought was kind, and the person
was humane, and distinguished and brave, not merely because other
people recognized it as such, but because it is and it is, and it is.

The flower will always live in the memory of a tired, wet Marine, and
thus has achieved a sort of immortality.  But even if we had never
gone on that hill, it would still be a distinguished, soft, red,
thornless flower growing among the cutting, scratching plants, and
that in itself is its own reward.

Love,

Sandy

*Four months later, on 11 November, Sandy Kempner was killed by
shrapnel from a mine explosion near Tien Phu. He was 24 years old.  I
want to add, [from my book], a little more detail:  Kempner was
disarming a mine when one of his men accidentally tripped another
mine.  Though seriously injured by the explosion, Kempner ordered that
the other wounded man be treated first.  Kempner was finally placed in
a medevac to be taken to the hospital, but he died on route.

Just wanted to say to you, Sandy (Marion Lee) Kempner, wherever you
are, you have indeed achieved immortality.  Not just in my heart.
Your words have been repeated and celebrated by many.  For example:

I know there was a play called "One Red Flower" in '04, which got very
good reviews. Believe it or not, it was a musical.  Also, there is an
excellent documentary ("Dear America: Letters Home from Vietnam",
1987), which got outstanding ratings.  I happen to know that *this
particular letter* is included in the movie.  (It would be so
beautiful to hear it read aloud.)

I think we all should read this letter closely to remind us that we
are in the midst of a war, and to make us think about it seriously.
In todays's NY Times there was a list of the newly dead in Iraq, and
among the casualties was a young man from Galveston, TX, Travis
Buford, 23 years old.  So much like Sandy.  I wonder what he would
have had to say to us.  Anyway, please read this:
