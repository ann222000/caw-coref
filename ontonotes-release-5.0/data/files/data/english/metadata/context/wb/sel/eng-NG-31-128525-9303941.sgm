&gt;&gt;&gt; I am thankful for my son.  Last eve he once again asked if Santa was
&gt;&gt;&gt; real.  He was holding his breath and at first I thought he was
&gt;&gt;&gt; internally begging for me to say Santa was real, but then I really,
&gt;&gt;&gt; really looked.  He wanted to know the truth.

&gt;&gt;&gt; This last year I have noticed him really grow.  Yeah he can be a
&gt;&gt;&gt; crazy, irritating, spacey 11 year old boy.  But, something was just
&gt;&gt;&gt; different this year.  It made me feel a bit sad, but very proud.  I
&gt;&gt;&gt; think he will turn into a wonderful man.  It might be early to feel
&gt;&gt;&gt; this, but I do.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I told him the truth.  He wasn't disappointed.  Actually he seemed
&gt;&gt;&gt; like he stood a bit taller.  He has this way of arching one brow and
&gt;&gt;&gt; nodding his head like, &quot;Hmmm, yes, it was as I suspected&quot;.  I savored
&gt;&gt;&gt; the moment for a minute, then turned back into mom and lectured him on
&gt;&gt;&gt; not spilling the beans to his sisters.

&gt;&gt;&gt; He said that he wouldn't want to tell them because he hates when he
&gt;&gt;&gt; thinks I am disappointed in him.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Damn.  What a kid.  I love my son.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Vickie

&gt;&gt; That's pretty good to hear, Vickie.
&gt;&gt; And hopefully he doesn't want to hurt them too, either (by telling them
the
&gt;&gt; truth about Santa).      Well, kudos to ya.

&gt; I think he will hold to it.
&gt; It was just one of those moments, you know?
&gt; V

Yes.    I remember that there are or were such moments.

Really, any celebration is as much or as little that you want to make of it.
Being a grinch or an Ebenezer Scrooge is a matter of choice for us all. I'd
rather choose neutrality over raining all over someone else's parade, any

I'm very much looking forward to tomorrow. The prep,
cooking, eating and whatever just seems very enjoyable to me.

I don't have much family of origin close by. My boyfriend
and I will spend it alone and probably jump in the vehicle
for our enjoyable rides trying to get that perfect pic with
our digital cameras.

I remember as a kid going to these BIG Thanksgiving feasts -
the endless food and all the relatives. As I grew, got
married, had my own kid, I always noticed sharply how the
size of the get-togethers kept getting smaller &amp; smaller.

I also remember several years ago when I was alone, I used
to eat out a lot. The owner of a Chinese restaurant who by
then knew me by sight invited me over to the restaurant for
Thanksgiving. I never took them up on it, but it struck me
in an impersonal way. It was really ironic, because he
graciously invited me personally, however it felt
impersonal, surreal, in fact because I was used to being
with family. Change, sometimes, is very hard to take.

As for 'non-traditional' things I am thankful for:

My boyfriend who was extremely patient at the beginning of
our relationship. I had major issues stemming mostly from
post traumatic stress and he just let me be me, even when I
vented, bitched, &amp; blamed everyone else but myself for my woes.

My daughter who continuously perseveres in her new life and
makes me proud.

To quite a few posters here at ASM: I know none of you know
me. I've lurked here for a long time. I'm just very grateful
to the ones who do post here and have posted here - your
thoughts &amp; feelings for the whole world to read, if they
chose to, which I did. I've learned a lot about
relationships right here and I thank you all who've taken
the time to sit at the computer to communicate your thoughts
&amp; helpful advice.

Happy Thanksgiving!

That's adorable! It sounds like he'll be happy to keep the magic going for
his little sisters.

I never really answered that question in the affirmative or negative with my
older children and just replied that Santa only comes to those who believe
in him*.  The last time I repeated that to my eldest son was when he was
about to spill the beans to his youngster sister and either my tone told him
or he was smart enough to realise that he would be putting himself into the
unbeliever (and non-visited) category! He was around 11 at that point, too.

This was around when our youngest son was just born so DD15 and DS17 have
become quite protective of keeping Santa alive for him over the years since
then. I think we have two, maybe three more years before we have a houseful
of pretenders rather than believers! The last few years DD17 has been
chomping on the carrot and consuming the shortbread and drink left out for
Santa and his reindeer.

Last year my daughter reminded me of a tiny letter the tooth fairy left her
when she was around 8 years old. She'd taken it to school to show her
friends and when she came home - totally out of nowhere and for no reason
she was prepared to specify - she asked me to copy down what was in the
letter..... Fortunately the tooth fairy had been two steps ahead of that
little bit of predictable thinking and had used a special script! But it was
only last year that we had our first conversation ever where we both
acknowledged we had each lost our belief in, although definitely not our
faith in the power of, Santa, the tooth fairy and the Easter bunny.  My
daughter's awfully discreet as a rule!

*My husband occasionally finds a full stocking at the foot of the bed -
Santa visits him once every few years but not often enough for him to expect
to be remembered.

&gt; My oldest son also asked me this question.  I don't remember how old

&gt; if he really wanted to know and he said yes, so I told him that it was
&gt; actually Dad and I who were Santa.  He said that he had suspected as
&gt; much, but a little while later he also said, &quot;Dang it, I wish I didn't
&gt; ask you that!&quot;.  LOL.  So he already had a pretty good idea, but part
&gt; of him wanted to keep believing for a bit longer.

&gt; He's a man now, in his early 20's.  But he stays the night with me on
&gt; Christmas Eve, and the next morning I still wake him up by saying,
&gt; &quot;J___, wake up!  Santa was here!&quot;
">

Good for you!

I'm wondering whether we'll ever stop having Santa stockings left on the end
of their beds for our children. Probably not until they are well out of the
house and even married. Maybe not even then! Santa's only ever bought little
things and there is a set of common items in there every year so it would be
easy to keep that tradition going.

My middle daughter, 9, has always been a bit suspicious, regarding
Santa.  It has been easy enough to tell her St. Nick is real.  As St.
Nick *was* real, heehee.  The tooth fairy got sloppy, but luckily it
did not cause any direct suspicions for Santa or the Easter Bunny.

And my 5 year old, well she is at that wonderful age of no doubt AT
ALL.  Got to love that.

I do exactly the same.  Once every few years for his stocking.
This year is a no gift year between us, as our gift to each other is
savings for a new house this time *next* year.  Still, I might
purchase something little, I just can't help myself, lol.

Big Game Hunters
They're men who chase chubbies for sport and pleasure. They call it
hogging.
By Sarah Fenske
Published: October 1, 2003

It started with Rick's dad, who was never a big presence in his life.
His mother raised him; his dad, Rick says dismissively, was your
typical West Side drunk. But he could talk. And he liked to talk about
&quot;sweat-hogging.&quot; A college friend, a good-looking guy, had been into
it. &quot;Let's go out and pick up some pigs tonight,&quot; the guy would say. He
homed in on fat girls, demanded oral sex, then kicked them out of the
car when he was done. &quot;He'd literally boot 'em out with his foot,&quot; Rick
says, telling the story just as his dad told it to him.

When Rick and his friends headed out for the night, his dad would
inevitably ask, &quot;You guys going sweat-hogging?&quot;

In high school, Rick lost his virginity to a large woman. It only
escalated from there. He eventually dropped the &quot;sweat.&quot; But hogging --
that was something he got good at. Good at doing, good at talking
about, just like his dad.

Rick is sitting at the Treehouse patio, drinking bottles of Bud with
his roommate Mark and talking about hogging. Rick is tall, broad, 23, a
salesman who looks like a construction worker. Mark is three years
older, shorter, with a shy grin that women love.

At first, both are hesitant to discuss the subject. Hogging, after all,
is something men talk about with men, not women, and certainly not a
woman taking notes. But they can't help themselves. After just one
beer, they're egging each other on, jockeying for time, trying to top
each story with something bigger and better.

Rick explains the attraction bluntly: &quot;Everyone knows that if you want
to get belligerent with your friends, hogging is the way to go. It's
not something you aspire to, but no one decent is going to talk to you
when you're at the bar with your friends, doing shots of Jaeger.
Sometimes you just say, 'Fuck it, let's get a pig.'&quot;

It's not that they prefer fat women, they say. It's just easier.

&quot;You're not embarrassed getting shot down by them,&quot; Mark says. &quot;You're
not embarrassed when they leave.&quot;

Mark's had nothing but big women for a long time. On a woman of average
height, he'll go up to 160, 170 pounds -- 225 if it's St. Patrick's Day
or New Year's Eve.

&quot;I wake up and see monsters in his bed,&quot; Rick says, feigning horror.

Mark doesn't dispute their size. But he resists the &quot;monster&quot; label.
&quot;The problem is, sometimes they're really nice people.&quot; He feels sorry
for them, sorry for using them, sorry for being a jerk. If his friends
don't find out, he'll call them. Do it again.

Rick will have none of it. &quot;I just talk to them like they're complete
disgusting pigs,&quot; he says. &quot;You gotta break 'em down with insults.
Comment on their fat -- 'You're a dirty little pig.' They call me a
dick, an asshole, but after a few beers, they're into it.&quot;

&quot;He's good because he has no conscience,&quot; Mark says mournfully.

Rick runs through his Rolodex of hogging adventures with little
prompting. There was his ex-girlfriend's sister: &quot;She was a little
porker, and I violated her every way.&quot; The secretary, with her big
white breasts. &quot;She was a perfect hog.&quot; Beautiful face, big soft body.

Then there was the girl who gave him and a friend oral sex in the front
seat of a Ford Explorer. His friend wanted to take it further, but Rick
dissuaded him: &quot;Most of the time, you're not going to bang 'em,&quot; he
explains, disgusted by the thought.

Few hoggers take such obvious delight in degrading women. But all have
stories they're dying to tell, so long as their real names aren't used.
&quot;My mom reads Scene,&quot; one guy explains.

Scott, a 30-year-old from Broadview Heights, met an obese woman at
Knucklehead's in Parma on St. Patrick's Day. He'd been drinking since 8
a.m. They made out at the bar, then he took her home. The next morning,
he made up an excuse to get her to leave; he actually circled the block
in his car until she left. But when he ran into her two weeks later,
they did it again. His friends gave him a hard time: &quot;You went home
with a hog.&quot;

His ready answer: &quot;I got laid. What's your point?&quot;

Jake, a 35-year-old bartender, had just broken up with his girlfriend
when he met a big girl. Took her home. Got some. &quot;The next day I was,
like, how did this happen? Well, it just happens.&quot;

Bryan, 29, met his hog at karaoke night. One minute she was applauding
his performance, the next they were singing a duet. Soon they were
making music of their own in the parking lot. &quot;I might see her again, I
might not,&quot; he says, adding, &quot;If I do, I hope none of my friends are
there.&quot;

Sometimes hogging is a group activity. Chris and his friends use a
strategy they call &quot;the scud missile.&quot; Confronted with a group of hot
girls and one heavy, they designate their drunkest comrade as the
missile. &quot;We'll say, 'It's 11 o'clock, we're going to launch him!'&quot; The
drunk is deployed to woo the big girl; the rest of the posse follows
five minutes later and moves in on her friends.

Sometimes the drunk closes the deal; sometimes he doesn't. His friends
are always grateful. &quot;Hey, we scored, too,&quot; Chris says. &quot;We don't say
nothin'.&quot;

Some guys claim that hogging is a &quot;slump-buster&quot;: Sex with a fat woman,
they say, can break a string of bad luck and lift morale. (As the
Arizona Diamondbacks' Mark Grace once explained, even pro athletes have
been known to do it.) It can also be an act of selflessness: A guy
&quot;jumps on the grenade&quot; by taking the fat friend, clearing his pal's way
to the skinny one.

The common denominator is extreme emotional detachment. Scott tells the
story of a friend who slept with a hog. Scott called the next day to
taunt him. &quot;You didn't cuddle with her in the morning, did you?&quot;

He repeats his friend's answer with glee: &quot;No, I stepped over her fat
ass and left!&quot;

Mark and his friend Alex go to the Fox &amp; Hound in Parma, a city Mark
considers hog heaven.

Sure enough, Mark manages to find a potential hog while he's buying the
first round. She might as well have &quot;eager&quot; tattooed on her back. She's
poured into a red halter top, faux leather pants that lace up the side,
and chunky stacked-heel boots.

They banter, and Mark buys her a shot. He returns to the table,
excited. &quot;She's perfect,&quot; he says. &quot;A perfect little pig.&quot;

&quot;Ask her to join us,&quot; Alex suggests.

&quot;I did,&quot; Mark says. &quot;But she's waiting for her food. How novel.&quot;

A few minutes later she sidles past the table, then slips and wipes
out. &quot;Another shot!&quot; Mark cries.

&quot;You're supposed to catch me,&quot; she says, giving a sidelong glance as
she heads toward the bathroom.

&quot;This is going to be great,&quot; Mark hisses. &quot;I might get a blow job out
of this. Right here in the parking lot.&quot;

&quot;If you wake up with that the next morning . . .&quot; Alex warns.

&quot;I've done worse,&quot; Mark says blithely.

Leather Pants invites the guys to ladies' night at a bar called Quotes.
They follow. The place is packed -- with men.

Then darkness falls: Leather Pants is with another guy. A big guy. She
accepts a light for her cigarette, but that's about it.

&quot;You can't just go out with the mindset that you're going to get a
hog,&quot; Mark explains. &quot;You can't.&quot;

They end up at a cop bar called Dina's, drinking Budweisers and talking
about hogging. Mark sheds no tears for the hog who got away. &quot;I think
she might have been strung out on crack anyway,&quot; he says. &quot;Did you see
how her hand was shaking?&quot;

Still, he wonders about his own track record: &quot;When's the last time
you've seen me with a hot chick?&quot; Mark demands, then answers his own
question: &quot;You probably haven't.&quot;

If hogging is a long-standing tradition, as Rick's father seems to
indicate, it's passed down strictly as oral history. As far as anyone
seems to know, it's never been the focus of a sitcom or a movie. Even
in that repository of all things strange and elusive, the internet, it
barely has a presence. It takes the right kind of dad or college
roommate to explain the rule book.

Not everyone is grateful for the lesson. Some men react with horror,
others distant amusement.

But for certain men -- typically guys in their 20s and 30s, boozers all
-- hogging tales are like their grandfathers' fishing stories:
oft-repeated and always embellished. There's the one that got away. The
one who capsized the boat. The biggest whale of all.

From Parma to Mentor, the themes are the same. So are the jokes. &quot;Fat
women are like Mopeds,&quot; they'll say. &quot;They're fun to ride, but you
wouldn't want your friends to see you.&quot;

&quot;Slap her thighs and ride the wave in.&quot;

&quot;Roll her in flour and find the wet spot.&quot;

One universal truth: The boldest hogging stories always happened to
someone else. The more savage the act, the better the chance that the
guy telling the story didn't do it -- his buddy did. And the buddy,
just as frequently, is impossible to track down.

One grad student explains that a friend participated in a hogging
ritual at the U.S. Naval Academy. Sailors going on leave would throw
money into a pot; the one who displayed the biggest pair of panties the
next morning took all. But when the guy surfaces who supposedly
participated, he says he wasn't actually involved: A friend had told
him the story about his friends.

Another guy, an architect, tells of some bored college kids from Medina
who drew straws; the loser had to pick up a fat woman and bring her
home. The two then had sex while his pals watched from the closet. (In
hogging parlance, this is known as &quot;logging closet time.&quot;) &quot;He knew his
friends were watching, so the guy would be like, 'Call me Mr.
President,'&quot; the architect explains. &quot;She did it, too.&quot;

But when he finds the Medina man who told the story, it wasn't his crew
after all. It was one of his friend's friends; no one is sure who or
where they are today.

It's tempting to attribute all hogging to braggadocio and the fine art
of B.S. Indeed, even some guys who've hogged insist that it's no more
than a way to justify drunken actions the morning after. &quot;Take home a
big girl, and the next day, you say you went hogging,&quot; Jake, the
bartender, explains. &quot;It's not like it's the plan. It's the backup
plan.&quot;

Indeed, much of the fun seems to come in the telling, in recounting the
tale that can top all others. Even for Rick, who relishes the act, part
of hogging's appeal is knowing he can tell his buddies later. &quot;He loves
it,&quot; explains his roommate, Mark, &quot;and he loves telling the story.&quot;

But even Rick is smart enough not to share his affinity for hogging
with just anyone. He has a foolproof way of sussing out his audience:
He'll wait for a fat woman to walk by, then make a comment about how
he'd like to &quot;stick it to her.&quot;

His companion's reaction is everything, Rick explains. &quot;If he's
disgusted, I'll say, 'Oh, I'm just kidding.' If he's like, 'Oh yeah,
I'd do that,' you know he's with you. He's not afraid.&quot;

Rick Gilmour, the WTAM radio shock jock, prides himself on being a
misogynist -- or at least a man who can appeal to misogynists and their
prized 18-to-36-year-old demographic. In person, he's more gangly than
his radio voice would suggest; he looks like the guy who ran the school
audiovisual department, not the one who partied with the rugby team.

He's been known to refer to &quot;hogging&quot; on the air. He just assumes that
his listeners know what he's talking about. His usual fare is politics
or music or cars. Disparagement of fat women fits right into the mix.

One of Gilmour's regular haunts, Backdraft's, is a hole-in-the-wall
tucked into a Lorain Road strip mall. Gilmour knows most of the guys
here; the only woman is a tired fortysomething giving full attention to
her drink. &quot;You'd never know it from this sausage fest,&quot; he says, &quot;but
this is Ladies' Night.&quot;

Gilmour has been told the topic of conversation, so he comes suitably
prepared with a steady patter of hogging jokes. &quot;If you wake up and
say, 'Thanks for the lovely evening, Ms. Oakar,' then you know you've
been hogging,'&quot; he says. Rim shot.

Then he tries the roll-her-in-flour line. His audience groans. &quot;There
are no new jokes, just people to hear them,&quot; he says, a little
defensively.

A mustachioed Army vet on the next barstool lights up a smoke. &quot;Hey,
you know what they say: more cushion for the pushin'.&quot;

&quot;Any port will do in a storm,&quot; Gilmour agrees.

The Mustache leans in. At Ohio State in the '60s, he went to something
called a Green Dot party. &quot;Whoever brought the ugliest girl got the
prize,&quot; he says.

What did the women think? someone asks.

&quot;Who cared?&quot; says The Mustache.

Gilmour admits he's been with some heavies. He professes not to like
it. &quot;In polite society, they call 'em Rubenesque. Some people say it's
softer, it feels better.&quot; Not him: &quot;I'll take a chance with a woman
where our hip bones are knocking together.&quot; The Mustache laughs.

Gilmour's friend Bryan sidles over. At 29, he's got a house in the
'burbs and one of those job titles -- tech-support specialist -- that
could mean he's anything from a software programmer to a janitor.

Gilmour explains the topic, and Bryan sips his MGD thoughtfully. &quot;It's
a situation where you could either play golf with a high handicap or a
low one,&quot; he says philosophically. &quot;Sometimes you just feel like
winning the game.&quot;

When it gets to be 12:30, there are only two hours left in the evening,
&quot;unless you count Denny's, which I don't,&quot; Bryan explains. So he takes
what he can. &quot;Fat chicks may be just as lonely and bored as you are.&quot;

Last time he did it: a month ago. Worst time: a 220-pounder, sister of
his pal. Fortunately, he was at a friend's college campus at the time,
not his own. &quot;This was the perfect situation,&quot; he says. &quot;I was in
Toledo; I knew one person.&quot;

But, Bryan adds, he would have done it even if his entire college had
been there. &quot;The fallout just would have been greater,&quot; he says.

Or he could lie, someone suggests. Claim he didn't really do it.

&quot;You don't lie about it,&quot; Bryan says, horrified.

&quot;You just say, 'Fat chicks need loving, too,'&quot; Gilmour says.

Bryan takes a long swig, then confesses, &quot;Really, I think the prettiest
women look like Marilyn Monroe, Bettie Page. They had meat on their
bones.&quot;

&quot;Jayne Mansfield,&quot; Gilmour agrees, in almost a reverie. &quot;We're talking
real meat.&quot;

The bartender supplies another round.

&quot;Women want a man big enough to protect them,&quot; Gilmour says. &quot;Nobody
cares how fat Alfred Hitchcock was.&quot;

&quot;But no one wants to bang Alfred Hitchcock,&quot; Bryan points out.

Hogging almost always starts in college. Scott's friends used to
declare &quot;No Pride Night&quot; whenever they hit a dry spell. The call of the
evening: &quot;Let's just go find anything.&quot;

&quot;In college especially, you're just too lazy for a good-looking girl,&quot;
Scott says. &quot;So you find the ugliest, most disgusting one you can find
and take her home. Then it's a joke. And if your friends give you a
hard time, you say, 'I got a blow job. What about you?'&quot;

Jamie, who grew up on the East Coast, first heard of hogging at the
University of Michigan. He uses &quot;coyote arm&quot; to convey the horror:
&quot;You'd chew off your own arm in the morning to get out of there without
waking her up.&quot;

Growing up in Bay Village, Chris and his football pals only joked about
hogging. In a town where most of the girls were pretty, there wasn't
much more to do than talk.

Then he went away to college in Minnesota. There was a tight group of
14 guys on his floor, and the ones returning for their sophomore year
explained the drill to the freshmen: They'd each donate $100. Then
they'd go barhopping. If one of the guys found a willing hog, everyone
would hurry back to the dorm to surreptitiously watch the guy usher his
prize into the room -- and neglect to lock the door behind him.

The pack of 13 would wait outside.

With cameras.

Inside, Chris says, the guy would mount his woman doggie-style. &quot;We'd
be outside the door . . . And he'd yell, 'Hi-ho-rodeo!'&quot; Chris pauses
for dramatic emphasis. &quot;And then we'd all run in and take a picture.&quot;

At the end of the year, the guy who'd rodeoed the biggest girl
collected the pot, all $1,400 of it.

Competition was fierce. &quot;Eight of us did it,&quot; Chris says. One guy did
it three times. &quot;Mine was 250, 260 pounds. And I didn't win. The guy
that won it, she was large. Probably 280, 290.

&quot;It was very hard, because you're not attracted to them,&quot; Chris adds,
laughing. &quot;It was difficult, because you get her clothes off, you see
the side rolls. It just turns you off. You gotta suck yourself up and
just do it. You got to.&quot;

Even today, Chris doesn't feel guilty: &quot;It was one of my college
classics.&quot; His friends, he says, all think it's funny. &quot;Yeah, it's bad,
but you're not thinking about that. You're thinking it's hilarious --
and it is.&quot;

The average hogger has little sympathy for his prey. &quot;Fat chicks need
lovin', too,&quot; is often the closest they come to acknowledging the
woman's needs.

Many guys claim the hog should be, and often is, grateful for their
attentions. &quot;Fat chicks never get laid, because no one wants to see 'em
naked,&quot; Scott explains.

&quot;They feel appreciative just because a guy will let them give him a
blow job,&quot; adds his friend Justin.

&quot;They understand their place,&quot; Rick says. &quot;They know they're pigs. They
don't get it like a normal girl could. They're desperate.&quot;

Women aren't exactly clamoring to tell their side of the story. Some
may be oblivious to the way they're being discussed; &quot;hogging&quot; is a
term few women have even heard. Others, like the women at Chris's
college, may be too embarassed to tell even their closest friends. No
woman wants to think of herself as a hog, much less let her girlfriends
see her that way. The victims are silent.

And many hoggers admit to having few female friends. They see women as
alien creatures whose motives are suspect. It's only a small leap to
rationalize their piggish behavior by insisting that women are just as
bad.

The excuses are many: Women are all hunting for a sugar daddy anyway.
They mock men for their small size or limited stamina. In a hogger's
way of thinking, it's only right that men return the insult. &quot;You've
got the other end of the coin, too,&quot; explains Mike, who owns a Lakewood
bar. &quot;'He only lasted thirty seconds!' Stuff like that.&quot;

Some guys even admit they go for hogs because it's the only door open
to them. &quot;Sure, we could hit on good-looking chicks, but we're such
West Park retards, it doesn't happen,&quot; Rick says.

&quot;We've lowered our standards so low, they're no standards at all,&quot; Mark
adds.

He says he's genuinely &quot;remorseful&quot; about his behavior. &quot;It just
happens,&quot; he says. But if he can keep his friends from finding out,
he'll keep seeing hogs on the side. He likes them. &quot;They don't expect
anything. They're just cool.&quot;

Hogging's appeal is clear to Michael Broder, a Philadelphia clinical
psychologist. &quot;Some of these guys may be really intimidated by asking
out the type of woman they really want to go out with,&quot; he says. &quot;But
if they get turned down by a woman they consider unattractive, there's
no loss.&quot;

That, however, doesn't make it forgivable. &quot;If you have to do that to
feel good about yourself, you don't have much going for you,&quot; Broder
says. &quot;I feel sorry for everyone involved.&quot;

For years, Donna Jarrell was so self-conscious about her weight that
she avoided the bar scene entirely. She wasn't even willing to try it
until she was a divorcee in her mid-30s. &quot;I hated going to clubs,&quot; she
says.

So when Jarrell heard of hogging, she wasn't particularly shocked. It
only confirmed the fears that she'd long struggled with. &quot;If men were
really nice to me, I just assumed they were trying to exploit me in
some way,&quot; she admits. She wouldn't go near dances for &quot;big and
beautiful&quot; women, for example; she was convinced that they attracted a
certain type of predator who assumed &quot;big&quot; meant &quot;desperate.&quot;

Life provided good reason for her caution. After Jarrell's divorce, she
met a doctor in a chat room. They had great conversations, typing back
and forth for 10 days. Then he sent The E-mail. &quot;This is the most
heartfelt communication I've had with a woman in 10 years,&quot; he wrote.
&quot;Please don't tell me you're fat.&quot;

Almost a decade later, Jarrell has perspective. &quot;It just captures the
confusion and ambivalence of men who want a wonderful relationship --
but also want a trophy,&quot; she says.

A lecturer at Ohio State, Jarrell co-edited a collection of fiction,
What Are You Looking At?: the First Fat Fiction Anthology. She's a
self-described &quot;fat American&quot; and says the words proudly. She hates the
way they've been co-opted to mean &quot;ugly.&quot;

A big part of Jarrell's confidence stems from a casual comment her son
made: &quot;Mom, who cares if you look fat, as long as you look good.&quot;

It changed her life. &quot;Fat&quot; and &quot;good&quot; coexisting had once been
unthinkable. &quot;What I think a lot of people, not just men, don't
recognize is that our attraction or our revulsion to fat has a lot to
do with our culture,&quot; she says.

Hogging, then, becomes something sad -- for the woman, certainly, but
also for the man. &quot;There's a stigma so extreme that even if men do get
more pleasure with fat women, how do they admit that?&quot;

And, if they don't get pleasure from the hookup, there's no point in
doing it, she says. &quot;I'm so unfamiliar with the idea that you wouldn't
be real with somebody. It's just such a waste of your time. But for
some people, I guess, that's what their life is.&quot;

Night is falling back at the Treehouse, and the conversation is growing
windy. &quot;Perfect hogging is big fat tits, fat thighs, but a good-looking
face,&quot; Rick explains.

&quot;The hogs don't think they're hogs, ever,&quot; Mark says.

Rick is getting philosophical. &quot;It's not the way my mom said I should
be to women, but it works. I don't make the rules, I just play the
game.&quot;

When the time comes, Rick says, he'll pass down the rule book, just
like his dad did to him. &quot;When my kid's in college, sure I'll say
something,&quot; Rick says. &quot;Of course.&quot;

&quot;If he was going to Homecoming with a big cow, I'd say it to my wife:
'He likes hogging,'&quot; Mark says. &quot;But not to him.&quot;

&quot;I wouldn't tell my wife,&quot; Rick says. &quot;Some things you keep to
yourself.&quot;

Mark doesn't buy it. &quot;He can't keep it in,&quot; he taunts.

&quot;They are great stories,&quot; Rick protests, &quot;but to tell your dudes!&quot;

The patio is pitch-black by the time Andy and Ben join the group. Both
Mark and Rick are thrilled: Ben, they explain, is the perfect guy to
talk about hogging. He always has a heavy woman on his arm. He dates
'em. He revels in 'em.

But Andy quickly sets us straight. Ben, he says, doesn't hog. &quot;But he
likes hogs.&quot;

Ben explains that he likes a woman with a big butt, a firm fat shape.
&quot;I don't care how big it is, as long as it's firm. I think even you
would be shocked at how big you can get and still be firm,&quot; he tells
Rick.

&quot;But she's still a hog to me,&quot; Mark protests.

Ben will have none of it. &quot;I know what I like. These guys find
something I like to be a joke. They like to laugh about it and retell
it. But they may find it gives them some reserve of pleasure. They're
expanding their definitions of what is attractive.&quot;

Rick has grown quiet. &quot;In a certain sense, he has a point,&quot; he says.
&quot;It's fat women I usually masturbate to. Because they get me off. . . .
I can't get Tyra Banks, nor do I want to. But there's something about
violating this little pig that makes me happy.&quot; It's almost an epiphany.

Still, the moment of reflection can only last so long. Within a minute,
he and Mark are back to talking about how fat women give better oral,
how they're disposable, how the hookup is fun because the woman is
willing to be degraded.

Most important: It's a hookup and only a hookup. Never a girlfriend.
Never wife material. &quot;If it's a fat bitch, I don't want to see her
afterward,&quot; Rick says.

&quot;You're hogging,&quot; Andy says.

&quot;I'm hogging,&quot; Rick agrees. &quot;You don't want to have a hot bitch blow
you off because she can. You want a fat bitch who'll suck your cock.
Last call, I like to get my dick sucked rather than play euchre all
night.&quot;

Rick takes a long swig of his beer. &quot;That's the bottom line,&quot; he
explains to the darkness. &quot;That's hogging.&quot;
