M48/NGC 2548 - Great seeing but poor transparency

Dear group,

The skies finally cleared last night for the first time in about three
weeks. With 92% humidity, the seeing was exceptional for this time of
the year ranging from 1.8-1.9" (FWHM) at the start of the session and
which was down to 1.52" a few hours thereafter. However, the
transparency was poor and partially impacted the net result.

The open cluster M48 in Hydra is most impressive and I am disappointed
the poor transparency did not permit for an even better result. For
those interested, the result is available at
http://www.perseus.gr/Astro-DSO-NGC-2548.htm .

Clear skies!

Anthony.

Nice pic. It's just not fair that I can't get them like that!

The viewing of late has been appalling hasn't it? I got a new 150mm Dob
last week, and my 105mm Mak arrived yesterday. I reckon I've got about 2
hours viewing in the last two weeks.

I have produced much better results under better transparency.

It seems every winter is worse than the previous one. This winter in
particular has been very atypical for us in the southeastern

Nevertheless, the result looks very nice!  Some color differences are
distinguishable amongst some of the brighter stars.

I suppose personal preference comes in when it comes to 'diffraction'
spikes.  Some people try to minimize them, others introduce them ;-)

Still, it *is* a nice image!

That's more worrying than ever, I'm actually replying in the uk.s.a.

Hi Anthony:

Nice shot. I was conincidentally looking at M93 last night myself with
my little Meade ETX 125. While we've had at least some clear weather
down here on the U.S. Gulf Coast, last night was like yours, clear but
poor transparency.

Our local astro group tried to have a moon viewing night last night here (in
Aus) but that annoying grey filter wouldn't go away. At least someone got
some viewing in.
At least we had a bit of rain to justify the clouds.

I reckon in the 6 weeks of owning my new scope, I have managed to get out
about 6 times.......not sure how to 'measure' transparency, clearness, etc
but suffice to say IMHO the skies have been pretty awful and even when I can
see stars theres that high level alto and cirro stratus which is just great
combined with LP.......I am glad I didnt break the bank and get a SCT on
credit........with the amount of use it wouldve got I would be feeling
pretty bad with a young family to spend my hard earned £s on.......

Still I hold out hope that soon I will be able to get a cloud free night sky
and drive to the Highlands of Scotland for some perfect dark skies......or
even just up the road to northern Angus for some 'almost' dark skies

Yes, much the same here really, I usually measure the clarity of viewing
by seeing how much 'twinkle' the stars have (when I can see them at all
that is). It's also why I decided to set a maximum budget for the
scopes, I could easily have spent more, but didn't see the point.

Indeed, although in mid-summer the sky doesn't really get quite dark
enough for ideal viewing, and you do tend to get a lot more pollution in
the air too.

Glad you like the photo. Now, if I could have a dollar for each time I
have been asked about the spikes and my refractor I would have enough
money to pick up a 20" RC.

Anyway, with two pieces of string in the form of a cross and placed at
the front of the dew shield, we are able to generate the difraction
pattern for the bright member stars of an image. It is also a great way
to converge towards focus when initially setting up.

I have experimented shooting open clusters with and without the
diffraction spikes and much prefer the latter. I have also asked quite a
few others as to their preference and we literally have a 50-50 split.

What are your thoughts on the spikes? Roland Christen calls them
"distraction spikes".  LOL!

Anthony.

Ah ha - I suspected as much. My own thoughts are that I like the
aesthetic result but I have trouble with diffraction/distraction
spikes because they are not supposed to be there. When they appear
they play to our childhood memories of the large professional
observatory images of stars with those massive spikes.

Hi Anthony,

That is one fine, crisp image.

GOOD WORK,

Twinkling is an indication of atmospheric turbulence, but it doesn't
generally correlate very well to telescopic seeing.  The stars can seem
perfectly still to the unaided eye, yet the planets will seem very fuzzy
at best focus in the telescope; and correspondingly (though less often,
it seems to me), the stars can twinkle noticeably, and yet the planets
will seem pretty sharp in the telescope.

How often either of these situations happens seems to vary considerably
with your observing site, judging from comments on SAA over the years.

So in short, just point your scope at the sky, and see what you can see?

Indeed. Twinkling at my location is a fair (but far from perfect)
indicator of visual seeing. I'd add, however, that it's a very reliable
indicator of _photographic_ seeing. When you are imaging, slow image
wander destroys resolution. Visually, that same wander may have little
effect (the eye integrates at about 100mS, compared to minutes when
imaging). The nights I get the highest resolution images are always the
nights that the stars are steady.

I always rub my hands in anticipation when I see a lot of humidity
and/or slight fog, for this is when I have my best seeing for imaging.

I remember we had a little fog here one night a few years back. But when
we get some serious humidity, maybe 40%, it doesn't seem to correlate to
seeing &lt;g&gt;.

I used to believe this too Chris. Unfortunately it's not as reliable
as you would think. I've had plenty of nights with steady stars which
have got me very excited. Sometimes they are good for high resolution
imaging but only about 50% of the time.

In the UK at the start of February we had a very promising start. High
pressure and a favourable position for the jets stream. A number of
nights were crystal clear with very steady stars. Unfortunately the
seeing for imaging Saturn at an altitude of ~50 degrees was very poor
indeed.

Well, that just goes to show that this rule is variable with location
both for visual and imaging. Certainly, at my site, the degree of
twinkling correlates almost perfectly with long-exposure FWHM.

Pete et al,

For my location, nights which are CRYSTAL clear invariably translate to
VERY poor seeing. In fact, it is usually one or the other right now
(winter): I can wish for great transparency which comes with very poor
seeing (FWHM greater than 4.5") or great seeing (FWHM around &lt; 2.2") but
with average to poor transparency. For the latter, I must have high
humidity and/or some slight fog which of course impact transparency.

Summer time is another story.

Anthony.

I also use twinkling as a gauge and which I have found to be accurate as
well (for imaging).

&gt;Nice pic. It's just not fair that I can't get them like that!

I agree; and I've recently added the website to my own page list of
links.  Sometimes the pages don't come up too fast out here in
California but it's worth the wait to see such excellent photos.

&gt;The viewing of late has been appalling hasn't it? I got a new 150mm Dob
&gt;last week, and my 105mm Mak arrived yesterday. I reckon I've got about 2
&gt;hours viewing in the last two weeks.
">

Normally winter seeing is not consistently very good for me out here
on the Pacific coast.  But, amazingly: during clearings for as much as
a week at a time, going back to December, I've had the most amazingly
GOOD seeing out here, at 3,400 feet elevation, not far from Santa
Cruz.  I have had numerous nights of 8-9 Pickering scale seeing, and
fantastic sky transparency too.  The last time I remember such good
winter seeing was back before Mt. Pinatubo erupted.  I've done more
winter observing this year than on any single year during the winters
of the seventies and eighties.  Of course it's cyclical,
unpredictable, and regionally localized so one can't extrapolate
anything from my experience here.

However, the other night I saw a show on the Discovery Channel about
"chemtrails" and then subsequently heard much discussion of it on talk
radio.  It seems to me, though, that there can't be any 'seeding' of
the high atmosphere with reflective particles according to the
conspiracy theries, or by now it would be utterly impossible for me to
see things like Minkowski 1-18 and large diameter faint Abell
planetaries -- like Abell 7 -- that I've looked at this winter.  I am
sure that the infrared sky survey data would show a trend one way or
another to give some evidence; after all, if light is being allegedly
reflected away from earth, then it would dim, obscure, or blur
astronomical observations: and from my own narrow personal experience
this winter, it isn't happening!
