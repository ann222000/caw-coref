That's a good idea.. One I'll use when I get ready and make leaf mold..
Currently no leaves to do anything with here though, so my impatient

Huh. I'll have to try that.

I noted last week when I &quot;mowed&quot; my front driveway with a &quot;Grass Hog&quot;
weed whacker, it did pulverize stuff nicely if I went after it just
right.

black walnut, butternut &amp; hickory all have juglone in varying
amounts, so you don't want to add those to the compost... in
theory. OTOH, both my black walnuts have grass growing up to
the trunk &amp; the bigger one has a lovely healthy dogwood
growing well inside it's dripline (it did kill an apple tree
though).
i also wouldn't compost poison ivy, poison sumac or poison
oak.

Hint I got from locals on Okra... (I know what you mean about them
becoming &quot;trees&quot;!!! ;-D )

They told me to &quot;top&quot; the plant (pull the terminal bud&quot; when the plant
hit 2' to 3' tall. This not only prevents it from getting 8' tall, but
it also makes it branch where you cut it (and you can continue the
practice as the branches get longer) so this will increase your yields.

More branches, more blooms/fruits.

I do so love Okra blooms and the fresh young fruits!

Only anything that is known to be toxic...
Or if your soil tends to be too acidic, avoid pine needles.

We tend to have alkaline soil so pine needles and shavings
are beneficial.

Hi again, Jang.

I was watchin' Omelets thing regarding alkaline soil and pine needles.
Noticed that the Juniper Ashe needle runoff into settling areas, after a few
years, does similar around the rocky areas (surface limestone and caliche).
Doesn't hold water very long though.  Long term for soil making.  Making
some of my property a test bed regarding Juniper Ashe only, Live Oak only,
mixture of both, and no trees area getting no sustenance from either tree.
Talk to you in a decade or so.

Hi Dave,

I'm not sure what you're saying, but if you are saying that leaving
the leaves where you have a lot of caliche and rocky soil to grow new
soil (so to speak) then that would be correct.  Soil is made with the
combined effort of rock and organic matter.  It really does help and
make a lot of sense to grow plants which prefer cliche (and they do
exist).

We live almost at the bottom of a hill in Hill Country and I have the
great fortune to have very deep soil.  It's at least 3 feet deep.  I
know because when they dug the pool I say the horizons of soil and
caliche didn't start for at least 36 inches, deeper in spots.  Do let
everyone now how your progress comes along.

Guess I was a bit hazy.  Am supposing that the cedar (juniper ashe)
leaves/needles are composting in low lying areas consisting of limestone and
caliche.  Mostly pockets in the limestone areas.  Just an observation on my
part.  Other supposin's are that the chemical that naturally inhibits other
plant growth in &quot;cedar&quot; is diminished over time by rain and so forth.  Am
also supposin' that &quot;cedar&quot; needles are of an acidic nature.

Am about 3/4s up a hill west of Wimberley.  Soil is sparse at best.  I can
get St. Augustine it grow well in some of this if I water the heck out of
it.  And, is under tree cover (live oaks/juniper ashe).  Stuff is too well
drained due to limestone immediately beneath it.  Soil in surrrounding yard
around house, I had brought in.  Gonna transplant my lemon tree from pot to
yard next early spring.  My end intent is to block the SW-W sun from shining
on the front porch.  Too hot.  Winter heating bill in minimal here, so I
don't think this will affect it that much.

Your soil depth has me green with envy.

Heh! I hear you on the Live Oaks! I have them too.

I just let leaves lay.
They compost down to nothing in less than a month depending on rain
patterns.

I still boggle on why anyone bothers to rake leaves!!!

Granted, I DO rake leaves out of the driveway but only because the leaf
compost is beneficial for my bulb/rhizome beds. That is the location it
gets raked to. Best weed control I've ever practiced. My herb bed
benefits too since it is also next to the driveway. (West side of the
house).

Pine tends to do poorly in Alkaline soils. Using pine mulch, when
available, tends to correct the problem. Most pines around here look
like hell unless their tenders are wise to that fact. :-(

I understand that Cedars and junipers are also gymnosperms, but they
seem to not have quite the same soil needs as true pines.

I have to carefully watch the soil Ph of my one Sago Palm also.

If you want to save water, look into Buffalo grass or Bermuda.

My front yard is fully shaded, so I'm trying to get Monkey grass to grow
there instead. I'm fencing it off from the Border Collie.

St. Augustine needs full sun as do most true grasses.

Monkey Grass is not (true) grass and likes full to partial shade.

Frankly, I don't understand why the OP is trying to discourage it. I'm
trying to grow an entire lawn of it! It takes less water and never needs
mowing if it is the dwarf variety.

I'm not sure a lemon will survive the usual ice storm we can get down
here in Tejas.  I have two in huge tubs and one of them currently has
dozens of lemons on it.  Big, juicy lemons!

I was floored with the depth of the soil, myself and consider myself

I'll say.  And hey, there's nothing wrong with having a lawn guy

and winter fertilization process.  It's all crap.  If turf is fed when
it is dormant all it does is feed the weeds.  It is ridiculous.  It's
also ridiculous to do a fall feeding.  There only needs to be two
fertilizations, if that.  Every few years I put out some fertilizer
and I mulch mow the lawn, which keeps the fertilization process as
natural as can be and it is effective.  Trees out in the forest have
been fertilized by their own waste for beginningless time. Fertilizer,

that sounds like how the water works in NYC apartment

I've been fantasizing with the idea of a large (8-10' diameter)

climb on and do a little jogging.  Lots of issues though, like easy exit

yes, just a pitcher pump. the dug well is not deep (water is
not even 13' down), so it's not much effort to pump water up.
my jet pump for that well is only 1/2 HP &amp; works just fine for

actually, i've never seen one set up like that here in New
England or NY. the most common method of harnessing horse,
goat or dog power was a contraption that resembles a treadmill
or indoor jogger. adapting a treadmill is far safer than a
turnstyle, i'd think.
i guess the turnstyle would have been used more for a larger
mill (hired miller), as opposed to an on-farm mill for
personal use. you need at least 2 horses for a turnstyle,
preferably 4. a treadmill can be powered by one. the
treadmills were used for quite a few applications from baling
hay to budling corn stalks to powering mills or whetstones
(sharpening stones).
we have a handcrank grain mill we use here (with adaptions
for using a drill if we're feeling lazy) for beer grains &amp;
coarse bread flour (it'll grind fine flour, but then i have to
reset it for beer grain &amp; it's a PITA)
you could also adapt a bicycle for powering things fairly
easily. i know a few people that have turned old bicycles into
spinning wheels.
one advantage to old houses, or building your own new house,
is that they are/can be adapted to get along without
electricity. i doubt this house had electric until the 1950s.
there's never been post &amp; knob in here, so it wasn't wired
until the cloth romex wire came into use.

There is a book called &quot;China at work&quot;  by Rudolf P. Hommel

MIT Press Editions , September 1969

First edition was 1937

SBN 262 08035- 4

Deals with tools before gasoline and Oil.  Worth the search and maybe
your library can track it down.
