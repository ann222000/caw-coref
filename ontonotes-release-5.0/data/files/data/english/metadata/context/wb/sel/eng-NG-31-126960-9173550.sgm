You &quot;American Idolers&quot; are the cream of the crop when it comes to pop music
and there is not one of you who can tell me the name of the megahit based on
the theme of suicide? It's hard to believe. Come on people, there's more to
life than Ruben,Aiken and Hicks and McPhee and all the rest of the bozos who
have created  Simon Cowbell zillionaires. Furthermore can anyone name the
very first rock and roll song? Hint: released in 1948 and the artist is very
much alive today.
Let's go gang----think.

That doesn't stop the discussion, however. Turn the time machine back
even further than Brenston's 1951 number and you find Fats Domino's
The Fat Man (1950), Wynonie Harris' Good Rockin' Tonight (1948), and
Freddie Slack's House Of Blue Lights (heard here in a similar version,
1946). Some folks have nominated even earlier tunes, but those haven't
gained much critical or popular support.

If you don't buy the &quot;Rocket 88&quot; model, there are other pre-Elvis
songs that get mentioned often in these lists, such as Arthur Smith's
Guitar Boogie (the first national hit with electric guitar, 1948), The
Dominoes' infamous Sixty Minute Man (1951), Lloyd Price's raw R&amp;B
smash Lawdy Miss Clawdy (1952), &quot;Big Mama&quot; Thorton's original version
of Hound Dog (1953), and the Crows' remarkable Gee (1953).

Nice going. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland classifies &quot;The Fat
Man&quot; as the 1st R&amp;R tune. Now tell me what megahit was based on the theme of
suicide.

I'm coming, to the rapid conclusion, that you are a different type of
annoying troll.

If you've read the ng, for any length of time, prior to posting, you
would see the kind of people we are and the topics that we, generally,
discuss.  You've managed to make some personal comments about various
long-standing and friendly group members that are not polite as well as
appear to be, at least mildly, antagonistic IMHO.

Please consider this a &quot;heads up&quot; from someone who has been in here from
day one of the ng.  We always welcome, with open arms, new people.  All
we ask is reasonable civility and respect of the other person.  If you
want to be a part of a family like that, please make the necessary
changes within your style to accommodate that.  If, on the other hand,
you really want to come across and become someone who is
ignored/disliked/killfiled...then keep on the road you are currently
one.

Thanks very much for your support &quot;PeterL.&quot; No, the song is NOT &quot;50 Ways to
Leave Your Lover.&quot; The answer is &quot;ALONE AGAIN, NATURALLY&quot; by Gilbert
O'Sullivan but some people, instead of thinking, prefer warning, cajoling
and being agressively obnoxious as Mr.Rudd exemplifies. Hell, I'm not
trolling but instead trying to inject some interesting and thought provoking
discussions. And because Rudd doesn't understand that, he labels me.
However I've met with rotten big-headed bossy people in my life and Rudd is
like a drill sergeant I once had. Everyone in time, in our platoon, got over
the louse but the memories linger. To prove my point about &quot;ALONE AGAIN,
NATURALLY&quot; being a megahit about suicide, here are the lyrics,

&quot;In a little while from now
If I'm not feeling any less sour
I promise myself to treat myself
And visit a nearby tower
And climbing to the top will throw myself off
In an effort to make it clear to who
Ever what it's like when you're shattered
Left standing in the lurch at a church
Where people saying: &quot;My God, that's tough
She's stood him up&quot;
No point in us remaining
We may as well go home
As I did on my own
Alone again, naturally

To think that only yesterday
I was cheerful, bright and gay
Looking forward to well wouldn't do
The role I was about to play
But as if to knock me down
Reality came around
And without so much, as a mere touch
Cut me into little pieces
Leaving me to doubt
Talk about God and His mercy
Or if He really does exist
Why did He desert me in my hour of need
I truly am indeed Alone again, naturally

It seems to me that there are more hearts
broken in the world that can't be mended
Left unattended
What do we do? What do we do?

Alone again, naturally
Now looking back over the years
And whatever else that appears
I remember I cried when my father died
Never wishing to hide the tears
And at sixty-five years old
My mother, God rest her soul,
Couldn't understand why the only man
She had ever loved had been taken
Leaving her to start with a heart so badly broken
Despite encouragement from me
No words were ever spoken
And when she passed away
I cried and cried all day
Alone again, naturally
Alone again, naturally&quot;

That is ONE MAGNIFICENT LYRIC, isn't it?

Only one problem with your original question, &quot;Alone Again&quot; was not song
of the year (NARAS) nor record of the year (NARAS), nor was he a novice,
and being voted songwriter of the year in the Ivor Novello Awards is at
best a red herring. It is an award virtually unknown outside of the UK
and hardly a prestigious award, not even remotely comparable to an ASCAP
OR BMI award. I could just as easily vote someone else songwriter of the
year and it would have about as much credence in a primarily American
populated news group.

Here's an easy one for you: other than Karen, who was the drummer for
the Carpenters? He also backs up Bernadette Peters on the road.

What was for most of the previous century the most famous singer's
hangout in Philadelphia?

&gt; It seems to me that there are more hearts
&gt; broken in the world that can't be mended
&gt; Left unattended
&gt; What do we do? What do we do?

&gt; Alone again, naturally
&gt; Now looking back over the years
&gt; And whatever else that appears
&gt; I remember I cried when my father died
&gt; Never wishing to hide the tears
&gt; And at sixty-five years old
&gt; My mother, God rest her soul,
&gt; Couldn't understand why the only man
&gt; She had ever loved had been taken
&gt; Leaving her to start with a heart so badly broken
&gt; Despite encouragement from me
&gt; No words were ever spoken
&gt; And when she passed away
&gt; I cried and cried all day
&gt; Alone again, naturally
&gt; Alone again, naturally&quot;

&gt; That is ONE MAGNIFICENT LYRIC, isn't it?

&gt; &gt; Vlodovek, the Polish Prince

&gt; Only one problem with your original question, &quot;Alone Again&quot; was not song
&gt; of the year (NARAS) nor record of the year (NARAS), nor was he a novice,
&gt; and being voted songwriter of the year in the Ivor Novello Awards is at
&gt; best a red herring. It is an award virtually unknown outside of the UK
&gt; and hardly a prestigious award, not even remotely comparable to an ASCAP
&gt; OR BMI award. I could just as easily vote someone else songwriter of the
&gt; year and it would have about as much credence in a primarily American
&gt; populated news group.

&gt; Here's an easy one for you: other than Karen, who was the drummer for
&gt; the Carpenters? He also backs up Bernadette Peters on the road.

&gt; What was for most of the previous century the most famous singer's
&gt; hangout in Philadelphia?

&gt; The Other Mickey
">

Mick,
Here's the link http://www.superseventies.com/1972_2singles.html that
dispels your incredulity regarding all the accolades I mentioned about the
song and artist. It was a brilliant number done by a brilliant artist who
became disgusted with the whole show business theme.

Cubby O'Brien drummed for the Carpenters as well as drums for Bernadette
Peters. You are asking what was the favorite Philly hangout for the most
famous singer of the 1900s?
Sinatra used to love Geno's.

Hey I might be wrong on both but at least, unlike some retards here, make
fun of your questions? And by the way, the second best selling single of all
time in the USA is
&quot;Diana.&quot;

Zob, the song had not only a marvelous melody and chord changes but an
extraordinarily powerful message which was NOT commonplace THEN or NOW. I
guess one has to thnk maturely to appreciate it which omits a lot of the
dunces who lay around here waiting to hear Simon Cowell fart which acts as
the starting gun for another season of &quot;Fox Losers.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt; like a drill sergeant I once had. Everyone in time, in our platoon, got
&gt; over
&gt;&gt;&gt; the louse but the memories linger. To prove my point about &quot;ALONE AGAIN,
&gt;&gt;&gt; NATURALLY&quot; being a megahit about suicide, here are the lyrics,

&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;In a little while from now
&gt;&gt;&gt; If I'm not feeling any less sour
&gt;&gt;&gt; I promise myself to treat myself
&gt;&gt;&gt; And visit a nearby tower
&gt;&gt;&gt; And climbing to the top will throw myself off
&gt;&gt;&gt; In an effort to make it clear to who
&gt;&gt;&gt; Ever what it's like when you're shattered
&gt;&gt;&gt; Left standing in the lurch at a church
&gt;&gt;&gt; Where people saying: &quot;My God, that's tough
&gt;&gt;&gt; She's stood him up&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt; No point in us remaining
&gt;&gt;&gt; We may as well go home
&gt;&gt;&gt; As I did on my own
&gt;&gt;&gt; Alone again, naturally

&gt;&gt;&gt; To think that only yesterday
&gt;&gt;&gt; I was cheerful, bright and gay
&gt;&gt;&gt; Looking forward to well wouldn't do
&gt;&gt;&gt; The role I was about to play
&gt;&gt;&gt; But as if to knock me down
&gt;&gt;&gt; Reality came around
&gt;&gt;&gt; And without so much, as a mere touch
&gt;&gt;&gt; Cut me into little pieces
&gt;&gt;&gt; Leaving me to doubt
&gt;&gt;&gt; Talk about God and His mercy
&gt;&gt;&gt; Or if He really does exist
&gt;&gt;&gt; Why did He desert me in my hour of need
&gt;&gt;&gt; I truly am indeed Alone again, naturally

&gt;&gt;&gt; It seems to me that there are more hearts
&gt;&gt;&gt; broken in the world that can't be mended
&gt;&gt;&gt; Left unattended
&gt;&gt;&gt; What do we do? What do we do?

&gt;&gt;&gt; Alone again, naturally
&gt;&gt;&gt; Now looking back over the years
&gt;&gt;&gt; And whatever else that appears
&gt;&gt;&gt; I remember I cried when my father died
&gt;&gt;&gt; Never wishing to hide the tears
&gt;&gt;&gt; And at sixty-five years old
&gt;&gt;&gt; My mother, God rest her soul,
&gt;&gt;&gt; Couldn't understand why the only man
&gt;&gt;&gt; She had ever loved had been taken
&gt;&gt;&gt; Leaving her to start with a heart so badly broken
&gt;&gt;&gt; Despite encouragement from me
&gt;&gt;&gt; No words were ever spoken
&gt;&gt;&gt; And when she passed away
&gt;&gt;&gt; I cried and cried all day
&gt;&gt;&gt; Alone again, naturally
&gt;&gt;&gt; Alone again, naturally&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt; That is ONE MAGNIFICENT LYRIC, isn't it?

&gt;&gt;&gt; Vlodovek, the Polish Prince

&gt;&gt; Only one problem with your original question, &quot;Alone Again&quot; was not song
&gt;&gt; of the year (NARAS) nor record of the year (NARAS), nor was he a novice,
&gt;&gt; and being voted songwriter of the year in the Ivor Novello Awards is at
&gt;&gt; best a red herring. It is an award virtually unknown outside of the UK
&gt;&gt; and hardly a prestigious award, not even remotely comparable to an ASCAP
&gt;&gt; OR BMI award. I could just as easily vote someone else songwriter of the
&gt;&gt; year and it would have about as much credence in a primarily American
&gt;&gt; populated news group.

&gt;&gt; Here's an easy one for you: other than Karen, who was the drummer for
&gt;&gt; the Carpenters? He also backs up Bernadette Peters on the road.

&gt;&gt; What was for most of the previous century the most famous singer's
&gt;&gt; hangout in Philadelphia?

&gt;&gt; The Other Mickey

&gt; Mick,
&gt; Here's the link http://www.superseventies.com/1972_2singles.html that
&gt; dispels your incredulity regarding all the accolades I mentioned about the
&gt; song and artist. It was a brilliant number done by a brilliant artist who
&gt; became disgusted with the whole show business theme.
">

Actually, the web site supports my opinion that the clues you gave were
fundamentally dishonest. None of the titles and awards you credit him
with are from significant, important, or determinative sources. As for
brilliance, the UPI award offered to him says it all, &quot;the worst
potential influence on the direction of pop music since Tiny Tim.&quot;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

No, the question spanned the entire 20th century. The answer is
&quot;Victor's Cafe.&quot; As regards Rock and Roll, the tunes in its juke box
were important influences on the Philly music scene which was for many
years (because of American Bandstand) the most important single market
in the US. Unlike the trivia, e.g., Cubby O'Brian, this piece of obscure
info ties a whole bunch of musical trends and styles together. Knowing
more (or anything, for that matter) about Gilbert O'Sullivan is probably
not worth the effort.

... written about Paul Anka's baby sitter. Look, the problem your having
here has to do with your attitude, not everyone else's. Don't denigrate
postings because their authors don't believe the urban myth to which you

definitive. The story you were told about Mandy may just as easily be
bull shit as any of the other stories published on the internet.
Performers routinely lie to fans who invade their private time. Don't
doubt it for a moment. Frequently, composers or lyricists can't even
remember why they wrote a song or what it really means. Ever heard of
&quot;MacArthur Park?&quot; (Rhetorical question: it does not require an answer.)
I've known performers who have lied about their ages so often that they
are hardly sure what is correct.

So far, you've managed to piss off the most reasonable folk in this ng

apology, and you might just make it out of some kill files.

Other Mickey,

Who then was the most famous 20th Century singer to frequent &quot;Victor's
Cafe?&quot;

You say not knowing anything about Gilbert O'Sullivan is inconsequential?
Why? Isn't that discriminatory? I very much like &quot;Alone Again, Clair&quot; and
&quot;Get Down&quot;. He made 7 million $ on them but had to sue his record label to
get cash that was being siphoned off from sales. You poo poo the man so I
ask...did you ever earn money as a composer/artist?

Your statement &quot; So far, you've managed to piss off the most reasonable folk
in this ng
and faster than I even managed to do it. Back off, render a sincere
apology, and you might just make it out of some kill files&quot; has me puzzled.
You mean to say that automatically I must think like the rest? Yes I do find
that some posters are sincere and polite even when disagreeing with me but
holy smokes, how about the bums who use &quot;fuck, shit&quot; and all the rest of
scatology to embarrass posters? Did I miss bowing down to some Caesar on

I make no apologies to anyone because I did nothing but to express my own
thoughts and if those thoughts were contrary to opinion, that's life as Ol'
Blue Eyes used to sing. I mean I wish no one any harm, even Rudd, who came
down on me as if he were God. I even sent him a congrats upon reading about

Probably Mario Lanza, (supposedly Caruso once sang there) but you're not
quite getting it. Victor's Cafe was a neighborhood joint where people
who became famous hung out while growing up. (It's character has changed
in recent years, which was the reason for my date qualification.) As a
result, the music performed there and what was playing on it gramophone,
phonograph, and jukebox became important influences on several
generation of Philly bred singers legit and pop. As Philadelphia was a
hotbed of do wop, the influence of Victor's Cafe cannot be ignored.
Philly groups include the Castelles, the Silhouettes, the Dreamers, and
the Turbans. A discussion of the importance of Philadelphia flavor of do
wop is beyond the scope of the present discussion, but the &quot;Philly
sound&quot; continues to live in some of the contemporary a capella groups.

&gt; &gt;&gt; I've known performers who have lied about their ages so often that they

&gt; &gt;&gt; The Other Mickey

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Vlodovek

&gt; &gt; Other Mickey,

&gt; &gt; Who then was the most famous 20th Century singer to frequent &quot;Victor's
&gt; &gt; Cafe?&quot;

&gt; Probably Mario Lanza, (supposedly Caruso once sang there) but you're not
&gt; quite getting it. Victor's Cafe was a neighborhood joint where people
&gt; who became famous hung out while growing up. (It's character has changed
&gt; in recent years, which was the reason for my date qualification.) As a
&gt; result, the music performed there and what was playing on it gramophone,
&gt; phonograph, and jukebox became important influences on several
&gt; generation of Philly bred singers legit and pop. As Philadelphia was a
&gt; hotbed of do wop, the influence of Victor's Cafe cannot be ignored.
&gt; Philly groups include the Castelles, the Silhouettes, the Dreamers, and
&gt; the Turbans. A discussion of the importance of Philadelphia flavor of do
&gt; wop is beyond the scope of the present discussion, but the &quot;Philly
&gt; sound&quot; continues to live in some of the contemporary a capella groups.

&gt; &gt; You say not knowing anything about Gilbert O'Sullivan is inconsequential?
&gt; &gt; Why? Isn't that discriminatory? I very much like &quot;Alone Again, Clair&quot; and
&gt; &gt; &quot;Get Down&quot;. He made 7 million $ on them but had to sue his record label to
&gt; &gt; get cash that was being siphoned off from sales. You poo poo the man so I
&gt; &gt; ask...did you ever earn money as a composer/artist?

&gt; Yes, for 35 years, so far.

&gt; &gt; Your statement &quot; So far, you've managed to piss off the most reasonable folk
&gt; &gt; in this ng
&gt; &gt;  and faster than I even managed to do it. Back off, render a sincere
&gt; &gt;  apology, and you might just make it out of some kill files&quot; has me puzzled.
&gt; &gt; You mean to say that automatically I must think like the rest?

&gt; No, but you obviously failed to lurk a bit before shooting off you mouth.

&gt; &gt; I make no apologies to anyone because I did nothing but to express my own
&gt; &gt; thoughts and if those thoughts were contrary to opinion, that's life as Ol'
&gt; &gt; Blue Eyes used to sing.

&gt; You tried to hi-jack a group by spawning threads like a moose in rut.
&gt; You insulted folk for not knowing the answers to some fairly stupid
&gt; trivia questions, btw questions which were not fairly or accurately framed.

&gt;   I mean I wish no one any harm, even Rudd, who came

&gt; &gt; down on me as if he were God. I even sent him a congrats upon reading about
&gt; &gt; the negative biopsy. I wish no one ill will but you know something? Send in
&gt; &gt; the original Mickey because the other Mickey is getting to be a pain in the
&gt; &gt; ass.

&gt; I'm trying to do you a favor. If you lack the wit to understand that,
&gt; your stay in this ng is likely to be an unpleasant one.

&gt; The Other Mickey-
">

Mickey - you couldn't have stated it any better.
Vlod, you came in here barrell-assing like a bull in a china shop.
Most of the posters in this group are decent folk but when a pompous
blowhard comes in and tries to take over, and then, when &quot;rejected&quot;,
still can't see the forest for the trees - well, I don't know what to
tell you. But you remind me so much of another poster that was once in
here - someone who may have had knowledge and was definately
opinionated about things, but had the most obnoxious way of putting
those opinions forth and consequently was very unpopular around here.
Take a hint or take a hike - please.

I thought so too, until he stayed very much in the background during the
Katrina anniversary slap one's own back contest. This, in spite of the
fact that he was one of the few officials fed, state, or local to handle
the disaster competently. He'd make a first class president, which is
one of the few things on which my politically connected friends agree.
Unfortunately, him holding that office is not a likely scenario anytime
soon, if ever.  ... but a boy can dream...

Well, as much as some people hate/hated him, I think he was the most popular
prez in recent history.  I think one of the reasons Gore tanked was that he
tried to distance himself from slick Willy when he should have used his
popularity.  In this day and age, for good or for ill, people really don't
care who someone might be screwing around with on the side (*NOT* saying
this was the issue, I know, he lied and all that - but this is how most
Americans *SAW* the issue).  For the average Joe it was still &quot;about the
economy, stupid&quot;.  No matter when it started, or who was responsible, the
average Joe saw the Clinton administration as a time of prosperity with the
deficit gone and jobs aplenty.

I think a lot of people still feel this way and Hilary *WILL* take advantage
of his popularity.

without him, she's dead in the water as poll after poll shows the

Big risk. Back in 2000, I assumed that Hillary couldn't be that bad if
she had Bill whispering in her ear every night.
I have yet to find anyone who can name 3 things she has done for the

collective will of the people of New York.
I voted for her in 2000. It's a mistake I vowed not to repeat. That vote

&gt; &gt; I agree with pretty much all you said - and as much as she may dislike
&gt; &gt; it, Hillary will *have* to take advantage of Bill's popularity -
&gt; &gt; without him, she's dead in the water as poll after poll shows the
&gt; &gt; woman is just not very likeable.

&gt; Yep.  I think if he could have run for a third term America would have voted

&gt;&gt; Big risk. Back in 2000, I assumed that Hillary couldn't be that bad if she
&gt;&gt; had Bill whispering in her ear every night.
&gt;&gt; I have yet to find anyone who can name 3 things she has done for the
&gt;&gt; benefit of New Yorkers or as an accurate representative of the collective
&gt;&gt; will of the people of New York.

&gt; But only New Yorkers know that - the rest of America doesn't.
">

If it ends up Hillary v Rudy, discussions of her ineffectiveness
(bordering on complete indifference to NY state issues) will be front
and center, since only with Rudy (or Bloomberg) in the election is NY in
play. Republican campaign funds will be spent in NY in amounts never
seen before. As NY is a media center, this aspect of the campaign will
get plenty of national air time and column inches.

In a Hillary v Rudy contest, the campaign for NY will also become a
shadow campaign for Penn., NJ, and possibly Ohio, as well. That is, if
NY goes to Rudy, a number of other key states are also likely to go his
way, including Florida, which is now home to an awful lot of formerly NY
residents.

All in all, if given a choice between Hillary and Obama, I'll take
Hillary. Hell, I'd pick Reverend Al before I'd vote for Obama. He's damn
near clueless enough to make me long for the days of Jimmy Carter. I
know some of you will find this hard to believe, but I'm a registered
Democrat and I'm voting for Hillary in the primary, though the very
thought of her makes me ill.

No *I* wouldn't, but my best friend put up with her husband cheating on her
at least twice a year for the 30+ years of their marriage - and he didn't
have the prestige of being president of the US to bring to the table.  You
can never second-guess the dynamics of a marriage (or any other sexual
relationship) unless you're one of the parties in it.  I don't believe she
was running the show - I don't think she's smart enough (he, on the other
hand, was a Rhodes scholar and smart enough to understand what the American
people wanted and at least put on a show of delivering it).  If she were
smart, she'd be much more well-liked because she would know exactly how much
that counted in politics.

I agree - but my point still stands, Bill has/had something Hillary
needed or didn't have on her own, 'back then' - today though, may be a
different story.  If he were 'again' caught with his pants down, I
think she'd 'have' to cut him lose.  Hill's grown into her own now,
and praxctically all she's doing now is working on that public image
un-likeable thing - as P.T. Barnum said..

I really think you're underestimating her - Hillary seems to have been
shooting for bigger things in the political arena ever since she was a
youngin' in college.  I don't for a minute think Bill's un-
intelligent, but you can't be the sharpest knife in the drawer when
you're running around chasing tail and getting busted like a horny
high school kid.

It's not for a lack of trying - but sometimes you just can't make a
silk purse, although that's exactly what her campaign is blowing their
wad on right now; with much help from the media bootlicking.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;popularity.  In this day and age, for good or for ill, people really
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;don't
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;care who someone might be screwing around with on the side (*NOT* saying
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;this was the issue, I know, he lied and all that - but this is how most
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Americans *SAW* the issue).  For the average Joe it was still &quot;about the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;economy, stupid&quot;.  No matter when it started, or who was responsible,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;average Joe saw the Clinton administration as a time of prosperity with
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;deficit gone and jobs aplenty.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I think a lot of people still feel this way and Hilary *WILL* take
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;advantage
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;of his popularity.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I agree with pretty much all you said - and as much as she may dislike
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;it, Hillary will *have* to take advantage of Bill's popularity -
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;without him, she's dead in the water as poll after poll shows the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;woman is just not very likeable.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Yep.  I think if he could have run for a third term America would have
&gt;&gt;&gt;voted Clinton back in again - and this is the chance for average Joe to
&gt;&gt;&gt;get him back into the White House (and of course they'll all assume that
&gt;&gt;&gt;he'll be the one *really* running the show).

&gt;&gt;Big risk. Back in 2000, I assumed that Hillary couldn't be that bad if she
&gt;&gt;had Bill whispering in her ear every night.
&gt;&gt;I have yet to find anyone who can name 3 things she has done for the
&gt;&gt;benefit of New Yorkers or as an accurate representative of the collective
&gt;&gt;will of the people of New York.

&gt; But only New Yorkers know that - the rest of America doesn't.

I'm trying to get the word out, but I can only yell so loud. :)
