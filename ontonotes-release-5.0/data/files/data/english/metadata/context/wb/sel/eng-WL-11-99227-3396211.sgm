I can't. What the heck was wrong with him? Like father , like son?

In vino veritas . Instead of an excuse, under Roman law, doing something while drunk was an intensifier as the Romans believed (correctly, I think) the central nervous depressant (alcohol) merely allowed one to do what one really wanted to do, which in Mel's case was spew anti-Semitic remarks. Those of us who defended him against charges of anti-Semitism in The Passion of the Christ , feel pretty much the fool now.

I'm still going to see Apocalypto ; I'm a sucker for telling the truth about American Indian, pre-Columbian cannibalism.

And you have to admit that this statement is a real apology, not a pretend, Democrat style non-apology (as in I'm sorry you were so stupid as to be offended):

After drinking alcohol on Thursday night, I did a number of things that were very wrong and for which I am ashamed. I drove a car when I should not have, and was stopped by the LA County Sheriffs. The arresting officer was just doing his job and I feel fortunate that I was apprehended before I caused injury to any other person. I acted like a person completely out of control when I was arrested, and said things that I do not believe to be true and which are despicable. I am deeply ashamed of everything I said . Also, I take this opportunity to apologize to the deputies involved for my belligerent behavior. They have always been there for me in my community and indeed probably saved me from myself. I disgraced myself and my family with my behavior and for that I am truly sorry . I have battled with the disease of alcoholism for all of my adult life and profoundly regret my horrific relapse. I apologize for any behavior unbecoming of me in my inebriated state and have already taken necessary steps to ensure my return to health. (Emphasis added).

As for me, I admire many Jews and like a lot of them. I think, like Sartre, the origin of anti-Semitism is jealousy. The closest I ever got to anti-Semitism is this statement: We don't reject the Jews so much as they reject us.
