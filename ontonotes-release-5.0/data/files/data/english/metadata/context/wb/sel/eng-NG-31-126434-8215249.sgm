Freedom's Roads

For so many years I thought I was free,
that, living outside the law and society's
idea of normalcy was my own form of revolution.
What I failed to realize, was that I was caging
myself with the other misfits, those who raged
about the &quot;straights,&quot; and capitalism, who needed
to be wasted to feel normal---or at least normal to us.

I traded one prison for another---with real bars
and count time, jailhouse tats and a couple of scars,
marking my youth spent, chasing the elusiveness of freedom.
Once out, I rejoined the ranks, fighting
the establishment in what I thought was my own way,
disavowing any government except that of my peers,
bleary-eyed hippies and zippies, pranksters all,
answering the call of what we thought was freedom.

Another sentence followed. What started out
as revolutionary fun turned into a frantic series
of desperate runs, consuming my life with powders
and pills and anything that would take me outside
of myself--outside of the image of failure
that I had sculpted out of my life.
Mistrust of governments turned into a paranoia
that enveloped my whole being, relegating me
to an existence of isolation from any happy
relationship, even with myself.

This last sentence was nearly fatal. The deeper
into the hole of my addiction I fell, the stronger fear
gained a grip on my life. Not only had I failed at
bringing about change in the world, I had lost myself
in the process. All the morals I had fought so bravely
for in the beginning were gone. I would do anything
to score just one more---and one more was never enough.
It didn't matter what, either--one more fix,
one more unhealthy relationship, one more trick
I played on myself to believe this was freedom.
Thankfully, I was reprieved. I found others,
who'd been there, who had climbed their way out
of this self-imposed hell, and they showed me the key.

Strangely, the key was really something
I'd strongly believed in my youth-lessons
learned at my mother's knee-to think of others
needs, to spread seeds of encouragement where despair
had a hold. To draw strength from one another, banding
together in a bold outcry of love.

I think all of our lives are spent
escaping one prison or another.
Abuse, abandonment, addictions, conformity --
our spirits constantly evolving through time
and experiences to become our true, loving selves,
if we're lucky enough to survive
the lessons and sentences these prisons can impose.
Once free, we are responsible to reach back and show
others the door, and that, is the blessing!

Expectations

&quot;As we realize our need to be forgiven, we tend to be more
forgiving.&quot; Basic Text, p.38

Our behavior toward other people in our life is a mirror of our
behavior toward ourselves. When we demand perfection of
ourselves, we come to demand it from others around us, too.
As we strive to repair and heal our lives in recovery, we may
also expect others to work just as hard and to recover at the
same pace as we do. And just as we are often unforgiving
of our own mistakes, we may shut out friends and family
members when they don't meet our expectations.

Working the steps helps us understand our own limitations
and our humanity. We come to see our failures as human
mistakes. We realize that we will never be perfect, that we will,
at times, disappoint ourselves and others. We hope for forgiveness.

As we learn to gently accept ourselves, we can start to view
others with the same accepting and tolerant heart. These people,
too, are only human, trying to do their best and sometimes falling
short.

Just for today: I will treat others with the tolerance and forgiveness
I seek for myself.  pg. 219

A Measure of Humility
In every case, pain had been the price of admission into a
new life.  But this admission price had purchased more than
we expected.  It brought a measure of humility, which we
soon discovered to be a healer of pain.
TWELVE STEPS AND TWELVE TRADITIONS, p. 75

It was painful to give up trying to control my life, even though
success eluded me, and when life got too rough, I drank to escape.
Accepting life on life's terms will be mastered through the humility
I experience when I turn my will and my life over to the care of God,
as I understand Him. With my life in God's care, fear, uncertainty,
and anger are no longer my response to those portions of life that I
would rather not have happen to me. The pain of  living through
these times will be healed by the knowledge that  I have received
the spiritual strength to survive.

Twenty-Four Hours A Day by Hazelden/ July 29th

A.A. Thought for the Day

There are two days in every week about which we should not
worry, two days that should be kept from fear and apprehension.
One of these days is yesterday, with its mistakes and cares,
its faults and blunders, its aches and pains.  Yesterday has
passed forever beyond our control.  All the money in the world
cannot bring back yesterday.  We cannot undo a single act we
performed.  We cannot erase a single word we said.  Yesterday
is gone beyond recall.  Do I still worry about what happened
yesterday?

Meditation for the Day

&quot;God will not suffer you to be tempted above what you are
able, but with the temptation He will also find a way of escape,
that you may be able to bear it.&quot;  If you have enough faith and
trust in God, He will give you all the strength you need to face
every temptation and to overcome it.  Nothing will prove too
hard for you to bear.  You can face any situation.  &quot;Be of good
cheer.  I have overcome the world.&quot;  You can overcome any
temptation with God's help. So fear nothing.

Prayer for the Day

I pray that I may face every situation without fear.  I pray
that nothing will prove too hard for me to bear.

Today's Thought
JULY 29

You are reading from the book The Language of Letting Go.
Melody Beattie ©

Have Some Fun

Have some fun. Loosen up a bit. Enjoy life!

We do not have to be so somber and serious. We do not
have to be so reflective, so critical, so bound up within the
rigid parameters and ourselves others, and often ourselves,
have placed around us.

This is life, not a funeral service. Have some fun with it.
Enter into it. Participate. Experiment. Take a risk. Be
spontaneous. Do not always be so concerned about doing
it right, doing the appropriate thing.

Do not always be so concerned about what others will think
or say. What they think and say are their issues not ours.
Do not be so afraid of making a mistake. Do not be so fearful
and proper. Do not inhibit yourself so much.

God did not intend us to be so inhibited, so restricted, so
controlled. These repressive parameters are what other people
have imposed on us, what we have allowed to be done to us.

We were created fully human. We were given emotions,
desires, hopes, dreams, feelings. There is an alive, excited,
fun loving child in us somewhere! Let it come out! Let it come
alive! Let it have some fun - not just for two hours on Saturday
evening. Bring it with us. Let it help us enjoy this gift of being
alive, being fully human, and being who we are!

So many rules. So much shame we've lived with. It simply isn't
necessary. We have been brainwashed. It is time now to free
ourselves, let ourselves go, and enter fully human into a full life.

Don't worry. We will learn our lessons when necessary. We
have learned discipline. We will not go awry. What will happen
is that we will begin enjoying life. We will begin enjoying and
experiencing our whole self. We can trust ourselves. We have
boundaries now. We have our program for a foundation. We
can afford to experiment and experience. We are in touch with
our Higher Power and ourselves. We are being guided, but a
frozen, inanimate object cannot be guided. it cannot even be
moved.

Have some fun. Loosen up a bit. Break a few rules. God won't
punish us. We do not have to allow people to punish us. And
we can stop punishing ourselves. As long as we're here and
alive, let's begin to live.

Today, I will let myself have some fun with life. I will loosen
up a bit, knowing I won't crack and break. God, help me let
go of my need to be so inhibited, proper, and repressed. Help
me inject a big dose of life into myself by letting myself be fully
alive and human.

Choose Hope
by David Krieger and Daisaku Ikeda

There are days when it is difficult to have hope. The
newspapers are filled with stories of wars, terrorism
and human suffering. There are times when our hope
for humanity is seriously challenged by the actions or
inactions of individuals and societies across the globe.

We all have a choice. We can submit to apathy and
indifference or we can choose hope. This dialogue is
about choosing hope and recognizing that we each
have a responsibility to make a difference in the world.
In this book. Choose Hope, Daisaku Ikeda and I are not
saying that choosing hope is a simple, easy solution to
life and humanity's serious problems. We are only saying
that it is necessary if we are to create a better future. We
are asking you to consider being part of the solution to
the grave problems that confront humanity.

Foremost among these problems is the ever-present
danger of nuclear weapons. These weapons, which really
are not weapons at all but instruments of annihilation,
place humanity's future in jeopardy. As long as some
countries rely on nuclear weapons for security, all countries
and all people are threatened.

After the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the
dangers of nuclear terrorism loom large. September 11
taught us that even the most powerful nations are not
immune from terrorist attacks. All are vulnerable, and the
weak and despairing have certain advantages in their
battles with the rich and powerful. Had terrorists had nuclear
weapons on September 11, the death toll could have been
three hundred thousand or three million instead of three
thousand.

The citizens of rich nations can no longer feel secure
in a world in which large numbers of people live in utter
despair. No castle walls can be built high enough or strong
enough to protect the rich from those who have given
up hope for their future. No military preparations or
expenditures will in the end be able to protect the rich from
suicidal terrorists, particularly those armed with weapons of
mass destruction. The world will either be made more just
and decent for all, or it will be secure for none.

The issue of nuclear threat, whether by terrorists or
governments, like so many other critical issues, is
surrounded by thick layers of ignorance and apathy.
To change the world, we must bring forth butterflies
of hope from the cocoons of ignorance and apathy
that surround them. The best place to begin is with
ourselves. We must emerge from our own cocoons
as positive agents of change.

In this dialogue, we explore our own lives and views
of the world. We share with each other and with you,
the reader, our views on achieving a more just and
peaceful world. We believe deeply that the world can
and must be made more decent for all. This is true not
only because it is moral and right, but also because if it
is not done, those who are injured, alienated and hateful
will wreak havoc, tearing down the castle walls and the
castle itself. In our Nuclear Age, the demise of civilization
and humanity itself could be the price of failure.

We have reached a point in human history that demands
more from each of us. It is not just leaders who make history.
It is all of us. By our decisions each day we help shape the
world, for better or for worse. On the path to building a better
world, a first step is to choose hope. It is only a first step,
but it is a critical one, one that will provide the impetus to
move forward. There is much to do and you are needed
more than perhaps you can imagine.

In the words of the great representative of the American
Renaissance Ralph Waldo Emerson, whose works I started
reading in my youth, &quot;It is really a thought that has built this
portentous war-establishment, and a thought shall also melt
it away.&quot;'

Two global wars and a series of ideological and racial
conflicts made the twentieth truly a century of war and
violence. We must remember, however, that the same
century witnessed the worldwide spread of popular
movements aimed at peace and disarmament, such as
those sponsored by non-governmental organizations.
Some memorable achievements in this direction are the
World Court Project, which raised in the International
Court of Justice the issue of the illegality of nuclear arms,
and the treaty obtained by the International Campaign to
Ban Landmines. As such developments indicate, popular
solidarity is breaking through the hard wall of harsh reality
and altering conventional thinking about security. In the
same direction, we of the Soka Gakkai International have
joined forces with David Krieger and the Nuclear Age
Peace Foundation he heads in the Abolition 2000 drive to
eliminate nuclear weapons.

Such movements stimulate a swelling tide of hope. In this
book, Dr. Krieger and I examine various outlooks in a search
for a philosophy and a vision that will make hope the byword
of all humanity in the twenty-first century.

Our range of topics includes the roles of the United Nations
and nongovernmental organizations and the mission and
responsibilities of science and education. We have attempted
to plot a path for a world free of war and nuclear weapons.
We agree that a conversion from state security to human
security is essential if we are to reform our times lastingly.

In Dr. Krieger's words: &quot;Human security...demands protection
of the environment and protection against human-rights
abuses. It demands an end to poverty as well as to war and
genocide. It demands an end to the threat of nuclear holocaust.
It demands a judicial system capable of holding states and
individuals accountable for violations of international law and
a system of nonviolent conflict-resolution.

&quot;The power of our technologies makes our problems global.
No nation by itself can protect its citizens from them. National
security now requires common security, just as human security
demands global security.&quot;

On September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks took many precious
lives in the United States and roused sorrow and anger in many
parts of the world. We must accept the challenge to convert that
sorrow and anger into resoluteness and energy for peace.
In this way we can help create a world of security and happiness
for everyone.

As Dr. Krieger strongly asserts, the destiny of twenty-first-century
humanity depends on ensuring worldwide safety and security.
Terrorism can be said to epitomize inhumanity. Converting its
negative into the positive of a global society radiant with
humanism requires pooling all our wisdom supported by the
solidarity of all the peoples of the earth.

Today I am more than ever convinced that though our situation
may be difficult, we must not stand idly by. In the twenty-first
century, humanity must show how mighty &quot;people power&quot;
can be. We must make recognition of that power the hallmark
of the age.

Despite spates of bad news and crises typified by the dark
clouds of trouble hovering over the Middle East, steady hope-
giving progress is being made in many areas. The British
historian Arnold J. Toynbee said that, when we view the
future of humanity in millennial units, we see that ultimately
history is created by &quot;deeper, slower movements.&quot;' In our
present situation, choices we must make deep within
ourselves will determine whether the twenty-first century
follows the violent, bellicose path of the twentieth century
or leads humanity to an age of peace and harmonious
symbiotic living.

Hope does not just occur. It is a conscious choice, an act
of will. One must choose hope in the face of all we know.

When one surveys the world, however, there is so much
that is not hopeful. There is far too much poverty with all the
tragedy that accompanies it. There is far too much violence
and there are far too many weapons. Someone examining
the budgets of the world's countries might conclude that most
countries care more about weapons for their militaries than
they do about their people.

In a millennial report, the UN secretary-general found that
if the world were a village of a thousand people, then only
150 of the inhabitants would live in an affluent area while
780 would live in poor districts and seventy would be in
transition. Of the thousand people, two hundred would
dispose of 86 percent of the wealth, and nearly half of the
villagers would be living on less than two dollars per day.

The secretary-general reported that these problems of
poverty and disparity make peace unpredictable. He also
reported that the environment is also suffering and the
quality of the air and water, essential to life, is deteriorating.
&quot;Who among us,&quot; the secretary-general asked, &quot;would not
wonder how long a village in this state can survive?&quot;

A clear-eyed view of the present circumstances on earth
is not cause for celebration. Political leaders at all levels
seem more focused on shortsighted gains for themselves
than on the welfare of humanity. The world's states
continue to operate largely in a competitive mode, while
increasing numbers of people throughout the world cry
out for new modes of cooperation. The corporations that
dominate the world's economy continue to base their
success on short-term profits and to treat the earth, air
and water as economic externalities at their disposal.

I have not yet mentioned the murderers, the merely
greedy, and those who are responsible for racism and ethnic
cleansing and for the proliferation, use and creation of
weapons.

A good argument could be made for giving up on the
human species in hopelessness and despair. Perhaps
our species is simply acting out a death wish by its
selfish, shortsighted and cruel behavior. And yet, we
know at a deep level that we are capable of far better than
this.

We are a species gifted in the creation of sublime beauty.
We are a species capable of love, friendship, loyalty and
acts of great selflessness. We are capable of seeing the
bigger picture and embracing the challenge of building
a better world. Like our technologies, we are dual-purpose.
We are capable of both good and evil, and we struggle
forward in this world where good and evil continue to
co-exist.

I choose hope. It is a conscious choice, made in the full
understanding that the evil around us is enough to
envelop and overwhelm us. I choose hope because I feel
a deep responsibility to do what I believe I am obligated to
do-to pass the world on a better place than when I came
into it. It is what gives meaning to life. To fight for a better
world is a form of living life to its fullest and richest. I choose
hope as a personal and professional responsibility.

Dialogue is a way that probes and explores, a way from
which hopefully both participants grow in their own
understanding of the world. The world needs more dialogue,
but dialogue that is aimed at action.

Words must lead to change-in the case of this dialogue, to
creating a better world. Building a better world requires hope.
Without hope it is not possible to go forward. To choose hope
is already a step in the right direction. It is as easy to choose
hope as it is to deny it and push it away. With hope, we can
change the world.

Each of us must decide whether or not to choose hope. Our
dialogue will have succeeded if it helps you to choose hope
and act for a better world.

The great French writer Victor Hugo triumphed over a life of
turmoil and oppression. Soka University of America
possesses a portrait photograph of him in his later years,
which bears a hand-written inscription of which I am extremely
fond. In English, it means, &quot;Where there is hope, there is peace.&quot;
If hope is wanting, we must create it for ourselves. Once we have
done so, the great wave of peace can swell and spread freely.

Serenity

Serenity, which is the immunity to all addictions,
is characterized by feelings of tranquility, gratitude,
contentment, affection for others, and a deep inner peace.

When people are serene, they don't need to fulfill desires to
feel complete. Addiction is the attempt to find completion in
a substance or situation. In fact, completion can only be found
within.

The feeling of serenity is innate (inborn).
When we 'lose' serenity, the desire to regain it is innate
as well. For some, that desire is heightened by adversity or
physical and/or emotional problems. For others, the search
represents curiosity about the deeper meaning of life.
Throughout the brief history of addiction treatment,
various leaders have stated that the antidote for addiction is
serenity, a spiritual awakening, a changed level of consciousness.

Serenity is our birthright.
It is as natural to us as breathing or digesting food.
When we are in a state of physical health, those functions are
balanced. In a healthy mental state, all our
emotions, thoughts, and behaviors act in unison too.
We experience harmonious interaction with our environment.
One obvious result of serenity is mature, harmonious human
relationships. When we feel serene, we are more open, honest,
respectful, and loving. There is no need for defensiveness or
blame. We can see and appreciate the positive characteristics
of others. When others are feeling insecure and behaving
negatively, we can respond with compassion and patience.
We feel no need to control them so that we can feel good.
Above all, we see the best in others, not the worst.
Serenity fosters learning, insecurity or fear hinders it.
A state of serenity increases our ability to listen, learn, and
create. The tranquil mind is an open channel of perception
and insight - spurred by curiosity, unobstructed by past beliefs,
attitudes, limitations and prejudices.
When we are serene, we are excited and motivated to contribute.
Work is more of a joy. We are more productive with less effort,
more free of stress and able to see positive solutions to problems.
Our minds and bodies are inseparable.
Modern medicine shows a relationship between state of mind
and the body's immune system, growth and development,
physical attractiveness and organ function.
When we are in a positive mental state,
we get sick less often and heal more quickly.
When we are serene, we can more easily realize
the full potential of our talents and relationships.
Fully living in the present - not the past or the future
- we are no longer plagued by guilt, resentment and fears.
Serenity lets us access our wisdom.
We see life objectively and gain more freedom of choice.
Clearly, serenity has many benefits.
But if our sole purpose for pursuing it is to gain these benefits,
then we have put the cart before the horse.
Serenity comes first, above all other things.
Our quest must take a turn away from the illusion
that external events create our happiness.
The source is deep within, and that is where our focus must be.

Where

Today is the first day of the birth of my awareness
the day that begins the rest of our lives.
For I am not alone in this journey...
I am with.  I am for.  I am in.  I am in the midst.

What is today?  It is a time of meandering within,
of seeking the soul's living quarters to see
where I am, where we are...
a concentration of being into the present full tilt,
the absorption of life
as it is being lived.
My awareness is of now.
The smile on my heart confirms this.

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*Easy Does It*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

God is gentle with me.  I am gentle with myself.
I am in awe of God's power;
however it is God's gentleness that moves me.
God's will for me is that which is best for me;
yet God does not force anything upon me.
Patiently, God waits for me to be still, to turn within and listen.

God's gentle spirit is my foundation.
When the cares of the world seem to overwhelm me
and when challenges cause me to forget the truths that support
me, God's spirit gently caresses me, uplifting and sustaining me.

Because God is gentle with me, I am gentle with myself and
others. I do not condemn or speak hurtful words to others.
My actions are ones that encourage
the unfoldment of God's divine plan in myself and others.

Through gentleness and love, God's work is done.

Can Miracles Be?

Utter confusion, misery and pain,
Humiliation, remorseful, ashamed.
Dreading to face the light of each day,
Not wanting to hear what people would say.

Like, &quot;Where is your power? Where is your pride?&quot;
They don't understand that deep down inside
I wish I knew the answers to give,
Or how to find the courage to live.

I had taken pills they told me I should.
I tried all the cures, but they did no good.
I made many promises and meant them too.
But the compulsion to drink is stronger than you.

One day a friend happened to say:
&quot;I know the answer, I can show you a way.
All it takes is an open mind.
Believe what you hear from your own kind.&quot;

I went to a meeting, they read Chapter V.
The steps made some sense and hope was revived.
I saw living proof of what faith can do.
It worked for them, why not for you ?

One day at a time, they told me to live.
They said, &quot;Easy does it.&quot; And &quot;Learn to forgive.&quot;
Be humble, be honest and help when you can.
Pass on what you learn to a new man.

I heard them repeat the Serenity Prayer.
And soon realized all my answers were there.
Now, when someone asks, &quot;Can miracles be?&quot;
May I always reply, &quot;Take a look at me.&quot;

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*Keep The Focus On You*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

You were created as a magnificent being
with a special purpose on this earth.
There is a spot in the heart of God that only you can fill.
You matter, because you make a difference to God.

Death is not the greatest loss in life.
The greatest loss is what dies inside of us while we live.

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*Come*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

The flower of knowledge will unfold slowly,
petal by petal, as your inner being learns
how to seek the wisdom of nature's way.
Martin Schulman
The Ascendant, Your Karmic Doorway

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*Come To*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

What if we knew for certain that everything we're worried
about today will work out fine?
What if . . . we knew the future was going to be good,
and we would have an abundance of resources
and guidance to handle whatever comes our way?
What if . . .  we knew everything was okay,
and we didn't have to worry about a thing?
What would we do then?
We'd be free to let go and enjoy life.
Melody Beattie, The Language of Letting Go

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*Come To Believe*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

Worry is like a rocking chair
it gives you something to do but it doesn't get you anywhere.
