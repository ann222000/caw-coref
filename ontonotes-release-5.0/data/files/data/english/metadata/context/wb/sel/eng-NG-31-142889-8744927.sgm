Thought I'd repost some of Elaine's old posts, and some of the
comments made about HER over the past half-dozen years.

Elaine, as you SO love to say to me/about me, &quot;you brought it on
yourself.&quot;

Any time you decide you wish to behave like a normal human being (if
that's possible for you), and to stop being NASTY and falsely accusing
people (you DO know what I mean), this can all end.

In the meantime, I'm sure some folks will LOVE the stuff I've dragged
up from &quot;elsewhere.&quot;  Like some of the stuff Cathy REALLY says / said
about you. Like BEFORE you and Jimmy A became &quot;kissing buddies.&quot;

Remember Kay/Karen?  I do!  YOU drove her away! No one else!
Remember Don? He was NOT among your allies! As insane as Don was, he
wasn't in your camp!

---

Cathy, don't feel too lonely. We'll get to your psychotic behavior
soon enough!  ;-)

Elaine has done something that you are incapable of Narcissus. She made the
choice to try and be more tolerant of others and to let bygones be bygones.
Five years from now if you are still capable you will still be right here
carrying on and on like a lunatic.

&gt;&gt;Elaine has done something that you are incapable of Narcissus.

&gt;  I am not a narcissist, you sociopath!

You ARE a narcissist.
And you're paranoid, to say nothing of a known liar and all-round pain
in the tush.

Try to prove Cathy is a 'sociopath' - you're not a diagnostician.
Therefore, you have no comment of any accuracy to render.

Your actions only got you what you deserved, John.
Your hatred has lost you every friend you ever had in here.

You're so busy trying to put everyone else down, but all you're
putting down is yourself.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Another brilliant comment made by the narcissist!!!

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;  If you / Elaine can't control yourselves, why blame others?
">

Your problem is, we do control ourselves.
Do you see us fighting all the time? No. We used to argue a lot, but
both of us decided it was time to put that behind us, and start over.

Your jealousy that we COULD do that certainly isn't earning you any
Brownie points, John.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;  Let's face it, since you two kissed and &quot;made up&quot;, Elaine can almost
&gt;commit murder, and it's fine with you. If I SNEEZE, it's &quot;The End of

">

It's called 'putting the past behind and moving forward, something
CHRIST HIMSELF advocates.

Would you prefer we should have continued sniping and griping at each
other? Obviously, your answer is yes - ours is NO.

It's called 'burying the hatchet'...... and I BY FAR prefer to speak
peaceably with Cathy than argue and fight.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Your ridiculous obsession with weapons is duly noted. Remember, BY
LAW, you're not permitted to own or operate any firearms. Get over it.
The judge was right.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;Five years from now if you are still capable you will still be right here

No, YOU'RE projecting.

Cathy is sane; you're not.

Argue and falsely accuse all you like, John, but clearly, you've gone
way over the edge, and you're moving closer to falling into the abyss.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

YOU don't get to tell anyone how much time 'they're allowed'.

Dream on. YOU disgraced yourself. It took no effort on my part.
And since you consider yourself such a 'good Christian', John, did you
ever hear of this passage?

Rom 12:19  Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but rather give
place unto wrath: for it is written, Vengeance is mine; I will repay,
saith the Lord.

YOUR problem is, all your gutter mouth, idle threats and blasphemies
WILL BE REPAYED by God when HE deems the time to be right.

Your actions as a professing Christian are a total ABOMINATION.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Elaine has done something that you are incapable of Narcissus.
&gt;&gt;&gt;  I am not a narcissist, you sociopath!

&gt; signed off on it?  I would like their registration #s.

You actually don't lower yourself - You're just being yourself.  If you
