All right, no more excuses, people. After four years in Iraq, it’s time
to get serious. We’ve spent too long goofing off, waiting to be saved by
the bell, praying that we won’t get asked a stumper like, “What’s the
difference between a Sunni and a Shiite?” Okay, even the head of the
House intelligence committee doesn’t know that one. All the more reason
to start boning up on what we—and our leaders—should have learned back
before they signed us up for this crash course in Middle Eastern
geopolitics. And while we’re at it, let’s do the math on what the war
really costs in blood and dollars. It’s time for our own Iraq study
group. Yes, there will be a test, and we can’t afford to fail.

3 years in Korea cost us 40,000 dead soldiers, 54 years of keeping
troops stationed there and all we have is a cease fire with an
increasingly dangerous enemy.

Maybe you should be happy as a clam that our losses in Iraq have been on
a much smaller scale?

Singularly handed?  :)

We didn't "win" the Korean War.  We settled for a cease-fire and are
suffering the consequences 54 years later.

IOW, we invested 40,000 lives and a bunch of money for a big nothing,
other than the fact that the South Koreans aren't starving like their
bretheren to the north.

The older generation of South Koreans appreciate the sacrifices we made
for them, the younger generation has already forgotten it.

So the question is, how much are we willing to invest in the freedom of
25 million Iraqis?

It took over 30 years for the South Koreans to work out any form of
stable, democratic government but you expect Bush and the Iraqis to come
up with one yesterday.

Face the facts.  The whole Iraqi question is nothing but an excuse for
Bush-bashing by the democrats and everyone with a working brain knows this.
