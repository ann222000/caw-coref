Part of a 'Things you didn't know about New Jersey' email sent to me.

New Jersey has the most diners in the world and is sometimes referred
to as the &quot;Diner Capital of the World.&quot; (Have eaten at a couple.)

New Jersey is home to the original Mystery Pork Parts Club
(no, not Spam): Taylor Ham  or Pork Roll.  (Yum!)

Home  to the less mysterious but the best Italian hot dogs and Italian
sausage w/peppers and onions. (Even more yum!)

Jersey tomatoes are  known the world over as being the best you can buy.
(Yes they are.)

New Jersey  is the world leader in blueberry and cranberry
production (and  here you thought Massachusetts?). (Knew about the
blueberries, not the cranberries)

Here's to  New Jersey -    the toast of the country! In 1642, the first
brewery in  America, opened in  Hoboken. (Actually it was in 1663)

Hobken is also the home of the first 'Blimpie' sandwich shop, started by
NJ students.

You know you're from NJ when:

You don't think of fruit when people mention &quot;The Oranges.&quot; (Towns
bordering Newark by the name of Orange, East Orange, West Orange and
South Orange. No North Orange though.)

A good, quick breakfast is a hard roll with butter.

You know that a  &quot;White Castle&quot; is the name of BOTH a fast food
chain AND a fast food sandwich.

You consider  putting mayo on a corned beef sandwich a sacrilege.

You've had a boardwalk cheese steak and vinegar fries. (Down the Shore
of course)

Yes, Hoboken. All kinds of unique food choices available there.

Here's the only place left I know of where you can get sfogliatella.

Anybody know of any other places, perchance?

True enough. My NJ informant told me there's still one 'Jimmy Buff's'

Yes apparently it is. Used to belong to a Newark-based (former residents

Can't help you with bakeries but you could try making your own:

(My Italian dictionary defines 'strutto' as lard.)

Or else try North Newark or NYC bakeries.

------------
Im Italian who grew up in Newarl,NJ in the 40,s-50,s.,when South Orange
Ave-Westside Park was the Italian section.
The ingredients and quality of food was much better back then.This was
during the war when I was very little.Eggs tasted like eggs,chickens
were tastier.Most of our families had little gardens in the yards
growing tomatoes,herbs and various vegetables..Whole days were spent
making  spaghetti sauces,raised our own chickens.When my great
grandparents came over from Genoa they opened a chicken market in
Belleville Nj.Italian hotdogs were something my mother and grandmother
used to make all the time.or we,d buy them at the St Roccos Catholic
feasts of the Saints once a year.,or Coney Island and Seaside
heights.The ones made today just not the same somehow.Ive heard all the
eeews and whats also...dont know what they,re missing.

ITALIAN HOTDOGS
Family recipe

1 pkg GOOD beef hotdogs
4 or 5 lg potatoes cubed or sliced in strips
3 green peppers-cut in strips
1 med onion-cut in strips
3 cloves garlic-minced
Olive Oil
salt-pepper to taste
2 loaves of any round  italiian flat bread

In large heavy skillet over med heat,add olive oil and garlic
till slightly browned.Remove garlic to the side.
Add potatoes and saute till slightly browned amd softend--add onions and
peppers.Lower heat and cook (stirring and watching till done.Remove all
to a bowl
and set aside
Add hotdogs to oil and raise to med.More oil can be added now if needed.
They can be added whole,coined,or split down the middle,whatever your
preference(whole is better).Fry till theyre the way you like them,Some
prefer slightly browned-some like almost blackened-your choice.
Put garlic.onions,peppers back into skillet with hotdogs,toss
lightly.till all ingredients are heated thru.Cover and renove from heat
and let lavors meld.
Slice the round bread in halves if small,in quarters if large.If they
are cut in half rounds make a pocket in the bread.
Add a layer of potatoes,peppers,onions,garlic,then hotdog slices,then
repeat with onion,garlic pepers ,potatoes.Drizzle a little hot oil from
the pan.It will NOT be greasy.The flavor combo is to die for.
The breads originally used for this was from a bakery in NJ called
Celantanos,which also sold pasta.It was called &quot;pizza bread&quot;(no not
pita),was about 2 inches thick, round with a hole in the center.
Have had 'modern' fancy versions of this,but it not at all like the
originals.

Hey nice recipe. It's the potatoes that make them special LOL. I've made
my own when the craving was upon me, but never had the 'pizza bread'. Is
that the same Celantano's that used to make frozen ravioli?

We lived off of South Orange Ave but we aren't Italian. There was a good
Italian deli and a couple of good bakeries; that was in the late
70s--early 80s.

Ahhhh, that's it then, I'm going.

My only recollection of sfogliatella, other than my own, is when

They are beautiful, and doing well.  The boy is smaller and still
in some care ward (NICU?), but he's fine.  Over 6 pounds, that's
good for a twin, I think.

Scary, though, my sil (she's from Canada, BTW) lost her vision
this morning for a while.  She's fine now, too.

Thanks for asking, my man.

I'm going to give this a shot.  From memory:

3 layers of rye bread ... thin slices
a layer of turkey
a layer of roast beef
cole slaw
russian dressing

Not necessarily in that order.  The turkey and roast beef
were separated by bread.  Oddly enough, the sandwiches
were very neat and, I think, quartered.  Not sloppy at all.

Anyone who knows better, feel free to step in.  Okay, just
for jokes, I googled, and this is the first thing that popped up.

Pretty close to what I've had; I also like the version that used to be
made locally --  it had ham and swiss cheese as well.  It was called a
bigmouth, possibly because of the ham.  I guess the cole slaw, russian
dressing and rye make it authentic...  :)   I've had the version of
the jewish sloppy joe made with pastrami -- good, but not the
same...

I could be wrong but that's probably not an authentic

I get a sandwich at this one place that is made with corned beef.
Very good but not exactly authentic.  The discussion on that
link I posted was pretty amusing.  Where I found sloppy joes
is probably one of the places they mentioned.  I worked in
Short Hills at the time and a friend took me there for lunch.

---------------------------------------------
There were alot of good jewish deli,s on Vauxhall Rd.The one I remember
not nessecerally on that street were Tabachnick,s and Horowitz,s
They were made as you described although some places started making them
with cheese and grilled.Due to kosher details about dairy products
hybrids sarted emerging without cheese.We made them as one large
sandwich with all 3 meat items in the middle on rye or a roll,cole slaw
or saurkraut,russian dressing,a 3 inch thick monster...thus turkey
sloppy joes.or ham sloppy joes,etc(some even threw potato salad in the
middle-which surprisingly was quite good if you,ve never tried it!)
were(are) popular. Youd be amazed what combos are good if you step
outside the box and experiment a little.Everyone and their mother
started different versions..
