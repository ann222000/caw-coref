Celebrate Sweetest Day With Flowers

Has someone done something particularly sweet for you this year?
Does your sweetheart deserve a treat for being the best friend
you could have? Or, is your best friend the greatest person you
know? You're in luck! There's a day set aside each year just to
recognize the &quot;sweetest&quot; people in our lives-Sweetest Day.

Sweetest Day is celebrated each year on the third Saturday in
October. Its origins are a bit foggy. Some have chalked up as a
contrived holiday designed to sell more greeting cards and
candies. Others believe it began as a philanthropic event. The
most widely accepted story surrounding the first Sweetest Day
seems to combine a bit of both theories.

The first Sweetest Day on record was celebrated in 1921 and was
reported in The Cleveland Plain Dealer on October 8, 1921. Some
people attribute the creation of the day to Herbert Birch
Kingston, an employee at a candy company. Others, though, believe
it was an idea produced by the candy making companies themselves
as a means of boosting sales. Whatever the case, according to The
Cleveland Plain Dealer, the first Sweetest Day was planned by a
committee made up of 12 candy makers. The committee organized the
distribution of 19,500 boxes of candy around the city of
Cleveland, Ohio. The candy went to orphans, homeless people,
newsboys, and other citizens who were experience difficulties.
Helping with the distribution were some of the biggest names in
movies for that time period. Celebrity distributors included
actresses Theda Bara and Anne Pennington.

Today, Sweetest Day has its largest population of celebrators in
the Great Lakes region of the United States. The cities that have
the greatest number of Sweetest Day followers are Detroit,
Cleveland, and Buffalo. Retail Confectioners International calls
the day an &quot;occasion which offers all of us an opportunity to
remember not only the sick, aged, and orphaned, but also friends,
relatives, and associates whose helpfulness and kindness we have
enjoyed.&quot;

One of the ways many people choose to celebrate Sweetest Day is
by sending flowers to those they love and appreciate. Your gift
could be anywhere from an enormous and extravagant display of
roses, to a basket of brightly colored mixed flowers, or a single
bloom given out to all the many people who make your life a
little better. Your florist can help you choose the perfect
flowers to send to anyone in your life who deserves to be told
how sweet they are.
