AAA: Fresno defeated New Orleans 5-4 (13 innings)

Fresno: 3B-RF Justin Leone: 4 for 5, HR, 2 2B, SB
Fresno: LF Brian Horwitz: 3 for 6, SO, SB
Fresno: CF Clay Timpner: 2 for 3, HR, SO
New Orleans: 3B Fernando Tatis: 2 for 5, HR, BB, SO, E

Fresno: LHP Travis Blackley: 7.0 IP, 4 H, 3 R, 2 ER, 3 BB, 6 K, 1 HR
Fresno: RHP Scott Munter: 2.0 IP, 1 H, 0 R, 0 ER, 3 BB, 0 K, 0 HR
Fresno: LHP Erick Threets: 3.0 IP, 3 H, 0 R, 0 ER, 0 BB, 2 K, 0 HR

Moved to the leadoff spot today, Leone's bat woke up as though he were
a cleanup hitter as he had 3 XBH, including his 18th HR.  Three
singles raised Horwitz's AVG to .323, only slightly higher than
Timpner's .321 AVG.  Timpner connected for his 6th HR.  The 32-year-
old Tatis, now in the Mets system, is hitting .270/.350/.462 this year
in 392 AB.

Blackley improved his ERA to 4.65 while throwing 61 of 98 pitches for
strikes.  July was the only month of the season Munter has had a K/BB
ratio of 1.00 or higher.  With three walks today, it looks like July
will remain the only month this year with more strikeouts than walks.
Munter threw barely half his pitches (18 of 35) for strikes.
Threets had perhaps his longest relief appearance of the year, but he
was efficient with just 40 pitches (29 strikes) in those three
innings.

AA: Connecticut lost to Erie 4-2

Connecticut: 3B Julio Cordido: 2 for 4, 2B, SO, GiDP
Connecticut: 2B Trey Webb: 0 for 4, 3 SO

Connecticut: LHP Eugene Espineli: 6.0 IP, 5 H, 3 R, 3 ER, 2 BB, 1 K, 0
HR
Connecticut: RHP Kelvin Pichardo: 1.0 IP, 1 H, 1 R, 1 ER, 0 BB, 2 K, 1
HR

Cordido was one of three Defenders with a pair of hits, but he also
had an XBH.  The 27-year-old is now hitting .247/.317/.438 this season
in 73 AB.  Following today's hat trick, Webb once again has more
strikeouts than hits.

Espineli's ERA rose to 3.32.  Pichardo allowed his 1st HR since his
promotion and his 3rd HR of the season.

A+: San Jose defeated Bakersfield 6-3 (14 innings)

San Jose: SS Brian Bocock: 2 for 5, HR, 2B, 2 BB, SO
San Jose: DH Adam Witter: 1 for 5, HR, 2 BB, 2 SO
San Jose: 3B David Maroul: 0 for 7, 4 SO
San Jose: 1B William Thompson: 2 for 3, 2 BB, E
Bakersfield: 3B John Whittleman: 2 for 5, 2B, BB, 2 SO, PO

San Jose: RHP Ronnie Ray: 6.0 IP, 8 H, 2 R, 1 ER, 0 BB, 3 K, 0 HR--1
WP
San Jose: RHP Taylor Wilding: 2.0 IP, 0 H, 0 R, 0 ER, 1 BB, 1 K, 0 HR
San Jose: RHP Sergio Romo: 2.2 IP, 1 H, 0 R, 0 ER, 0 BB, 4 K, 0 HR

Bocock had his best game in some time, connecting for two XBH and
reaching base four times.  His overall season line (including his time
in Augusta) had slipped to .255/.317/.349 entering tonight.  Witter
connected for his 5th HR in four games and his 14th HR of the season.
Given his SO/AB ratio above 25%, it's not a surprise to see Maroul
with the sombrero in an extra inning game.  Thompson had one of his
best games of the year, reaching base four times.  The former batting
champ entered the night with a .512 OPS.  The Rangers' Whittleman, who
like Bocock participated in the Futures Game, reached base three times
in his fifth Cal League game.  He was picked off first base by catcher
Pablo Sandoval.

Ray brought his ERA below 5.00 for the first time since early May.
Wilding made his second appearance with San Jose since rejoining the
team following a dozen appearances with Connecticut.  Romo's K/BB
ratio is now above 6.00.  Over his last nine appearances, he has 7 H,
6 BB and 30 K in 16.0 IP.  It's been a month since he last allowed a
run.

A-: Augusta at Lake Count was postponed by rain
(A doubleheader has been scheduled for tomorrow.)

ssA: Salem-Keizer defeated Spokane 5-2

Salem-Keizer: CF Shane Jordan: 2 for 4, 2B, BB, SO, GiDP
Salem-Keizer: 1B Matthew Downs: 3 for 5, 2B, SB
Salem-Keizer: 2B Jose Flores: 1 for 2, 2 BB, 2 SB, 2 E

Salem-Keizer: RHP Daryl Maday: 3.2 IP, 6 H, 1 R, 1 ER, 0 BB, 1 K, 1 HR
Salem-Keizer: RHP Waldis Joaquin: 2.0 IP, 2 H, 1 R, 0 ER, 1 BB, 1 K, 0
HR
Salem-Keizer: LHP Jesse English: 2.1 IP, 1 H, 0 R, 0 ER, 1 BB, 5 K, 0
HR
Salem-Keizer: RHP Daniel Otero: 1.0 IP, 0 H, 0 R, 0 ER, 0 BB, 1 K, 0
HR

With three hits, including his 23rd double, Downs raised his AVG to .
309.  Also reaching base three times were Jordan, who raised his OBP
over .400, and Flores, who raised his OBP over .250.

Maday allowed nearly two baserunners per inning, but he stranded
nearly all of them as the only run he allowed was on a HR to leadoff
the 4th inning.  It was the first HR he has allowed in his pro career,
and it raised his ERA to 1.39.  One positive sign for Joaquin is that
he did not allow a flyball out.  His K/BB is just 1.50.  English
continues to rack up the strikeout total as he struck out over half (5
of 9) the batters he faced.  Otero picked up his 14th save.

R: Scottsdale had their regularly scheduled off-day

DSL: The Dominican Giants had their regularly scheduled off-day

Age             Team    BB/PA   K/PA    BABIP   GB%     HR/Air
2004    19      A       Hag     20%     22%     .332
2006    21      A-      S-K     15%     33%     .273    34%     15%
2007    22      A-      S-K     5%      47%     .311    44%     0%

That needs to go on the 40-man, or be traded for something useful, or
convince me that it's a 97-batter fluke.
