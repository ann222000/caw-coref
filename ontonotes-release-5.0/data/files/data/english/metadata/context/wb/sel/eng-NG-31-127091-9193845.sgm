All I can say is GOODY! You get what you give, Phred Phelps!

The Fred Phelps hate cult is $10.9 million poorer today: Father of slain
Marine wins case against funeral protesters.

The brokenhearted father of a Marine killed in Iraq won a long-shot
legal fight today after a federal jury in Baltimore awarded him nearly
$11 million in a verdict against members of a Kansas church who hoisted
anti-gay placards at his son’s Westminster funeral.

The jury’s announcement 24 hours after deliberations first began
was met with tears and hugs from the family and supporters of Lance Cpl.
Matthew Snyder, whose March 2006 funeral was protested by members of the
Westboro Baptist Church with signs including “Thank God for dead soldiers.”

Snyder’s father, Albert, won on every count of his complaint, as
well as $2.9 million for compensatory damages and $8 million for
punitive damages.

Ok, let me get this straight (pun intended). These freaks think doG is
killing soldiers because the US is &quot;too tolerant&quot; of homosexuality? Ok, so I
know they believe that, but I just had to see it in print. And picketing a
funeral of a HETEROSEXUAL soldier is going to make the US less tolerant of
gays exactly how? Last time I looked the US didn't seem to be all that
tolerant of gays, especially in the flyover states.

Why are these loons allowed to walk the streets? They should be locked up as
a danger to themselves and others. Unbelievable.You just can't make this
shit up.

Well, Phred Phelps is so far beyond homophobic that he believes that
EVERYONE who is in the military is gay and gawd hates them. He is
so wrapped up in his hatred of anyone who isn't him that he
believes gawd hates them, too. Sad, isn't it?

You're right. This just can't be made up.

AFAIC, Phelps and his loons are more than welcome in my book to be a
danger to themselves to their heart's content. They can go kill
themselves for all I care. As long as they leave the rest of
the ppl they hate out of it.

I am so glad Phelps got his pee-pee slapped. He had it coming.

Learn not to top-post sharky.

Freedom of expression is a two way street. Invading an event
such as a funeral isn't freedom of expression. It is not censorship
to prevent such invasion.

You want to hold and express an opinion there are plenty of
legitemate channels. Being prevented from certain behaviour
in certain contexts is perfectly reasonable.

Freedom of expression does *not* mean I have to provide you
with whatever stage for it you decide you want.

Well said.

Regarding that, this is a great old article:

&quot;The Truth Hurts: The Humanitarian Threat to Free Inquiry&quot;

http://www.reason.com/news/show/29358.html

Excerpts:

&quot;We have standard labels for the liberal political and economic
systems-democracy and capitalism. Oddly, however, we have no name for
the liberal intellectual system, whose activities range from physics
to history to journalism. I use the term &quot;liberal science.&quot; The very
need to invent a label for our public idea-sorting system speaks
volumes about the system's success. Establishing the two basic rules
on which liberal science is based required a social revolution; yet so
effective have those rules been, and so beneficent, that most of us
take them for granted. Put them into effect, and you have laid the
groundwork for a knowledge-producing and dispute-resolving system that
beats all competitors hands down. They are the basis of liberal
inquiry and of science.......

&quot;In liberal science, there is positively no right to have one's
opinions, however heartfelt, taken seriously as knowledge. Just the
contrary: Liberal science is nothing other than a selection process
whose mission is to test beliefs and reject the ones that fail. A
liberal intellectual regime says that if you want to believe the moon
is made of green cheese, fine. But if you want your belief recognized
as knowledge, there are things you must do. You must run your belief
through the science game for checking. And if your belief is a loser,
it will not be included in the science texts. It probably won't even
be taken seriously by most respectable intellectuals. In a liberal
society, knowledge is the rolling critical consensus of a
decentralized community of checkers. That is so not by the power of
law but by the deeper power of a common liberal morality.&quot;

Very true! I've kinda wondered the same thing. I do hope
that the soldier's family is able to get at least *some*
compensation for such an unmerited tirade. I do think
it's unfortunate that the judgement isn't gonna stop
'ol Phred and his loons from protesting military funerals.
He said he's gonna keep on protesting.

I do think it would be funny if he were to wind up in a
fiery car wreck and have a gay man or woman rescue him.

Wackos like that don't realize that the very people they
hate the most are sometimes the ones who pick them up when
they fall.  To me, that's the best payback.

Well... The bits you've posted don't strike me as reasons to
think that's a great article. The bits you've posted strike me
as reasons to think the author is the kind of nutbar sharks
rails against. And the reason is, the only checking this article
talks about is regarding what opinions the community holds.

In one kind of &quot;liberal&quot; society, knowledge is indeed consensus.
It's not a pleasant sort of society that results. For a glimpse at
what a society with &quot;community checkers&quot; looks like, look here.

http://s3.amazonaws.com/thefirecache/752.html?PHPSESSID=38981d935a14d...

http://snipurl.com/1t0p4

In science, knowledge is based on observation of reality.
And all the consensus and &quot;community checkers&quot; can be
swept aside by one repeatable measurement.

Science isn't a democracy. Any notions of &quot;consensus&quot;
are orthogonal to science.

The award is justified.

Before all the retards start b-b-butting about the First Amendment,
let's just snip that rancid bud by making it abundantly clear that
this was a civil case between two private parties, not a case of
government-sponsored censorship.

Next, all the retards who yell &quot;B-b-but you lib-ruls always cry about
free expression!&quot; This one is also easily handled. A legal axiom
states that &quot;your right to swing your fist extends to the tip of my
nose.&quot; Private citizens have a right to express themselves. But they
do not have a right to do so at the expense of the rights of others.
Thus we have things like libel and slander (duh).

The funeral for the soldier was not a public occasion. It was a
private occasion, not unlike a wedding or a business meeting. Pastor
Asshole and his crew of Nitwits have every right to declaim this event
in forums where the soldier's family have not organized a private
meeting/occasion. They can write letters, stand in front of town hall,
etc. No one is curtailing their right to speak up about this funeral.

Similarly, WTO protesters can gather in Seattle and wave their signs,
but they cannot block access to the building or disturb the events
going in within the building. This was hard for some of them to
understand. The results were less than optimal.

When I see idiots who claim the Westboro Baptists have every right to
disturb funerals, I wonder if these same people feel I have the right
to crash their wedding, blaring air horns and shouting &quot;The bride a
filthy fat cunt!&quot; at the top of my lungs. If not, why not?

This case was a civil case wherein the family of the soldier felt that
Westboro Baptists had &quot;crashed the wedding&quot;. In this case, the event
was the most solemn event of the family's lives. Their right to be
secure in their persons and possessions at this private, one-time-only
occasion was utterly violated by the defendants. The actual dollar
amount can be argued, but the finding of the court was sound.

It's ironic that the Westboro Baptists have sued others (successfully)
on many occasions for violating their rights to be secure in their
persons etc when others raucously protested the Westboro church.

Oh, the taste is surely bitter.

I assume the church will appeal. They may get the damages reduced, but
I'm convinced the finding will stand. In a few years, they will likely
sign over liens to their properties to this soldier's family. They
will have to become renters and focus their efforts on their web
campaign.

Methinks the Westboro Baptists are done. Just like someone else around
here.

The boolean result was valid. The total was valid. But the
explanation for the total didn't seem sensible at all. There
was no way that the compensatory damages should have been
that high. The punitive - heck, mate that as high as you
like, but there really wasn't that much of a material loss
from the actual offence.

How much would you expect your damages to be if you were
to have shouted &quot;the bride's a filthy slag with pussey pussy
warts&quot;, or whatever, at a wedding? Ruined the occasion -
that thousands - but millions?

Of course, historically, the US has set absurd precedents
in this direction, but precedent doesn't make right.

Of course, 100% agree on the oft-misunderstood freedom of
speech issues.

It would take far more than a bullet to kill you. It would take a silver crucifix pushed through your
heart at a crossroads.

Even the president doesn't have 24/7 security. What he has is people paid
to *attempt* to provide security 24/7. If someone is smart and determined
no security is effective. Imagine if Monica Lewinski's interests lay in
directions other than dousing cigars? In total privacy (one would assume)
and with a half naked President who had his mind on other things. All she
would need would be a slow acting contact poison under one fingernail. With
Bush of course, someone like Monica wouldn't do, he'd need something off a
farm and someone to hold it down.

elizabeth tries the next best thing, hiding 24/7 along with deliberately
building a false impression of who and what &quot;she&quot; is.

You really are a 'tard, dearie.  I post under my own name, it's a very
rare name, and make absolutely no attempt to disguise my identity.

If you consider that hiding and building a false identity . .. you are
far beyond stupid.

Besides, what's wrong with a false identity?  This is a support
group.  Many of us are in professions where a majority of people
are USENET-aware, and posting a rant under your real name about
how annoying the sticky little ape-demons were at a co-worker's
Thanksgiving dinner might not fly all that well at the office
the following week.

&quot;Frank Apple&quot; ain't my real identity.  Anyone who doesn't like it
is invited to bugger off.
