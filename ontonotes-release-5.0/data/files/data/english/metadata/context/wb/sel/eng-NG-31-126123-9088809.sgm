I wonder why the following is not on the internet.

One can find nearly any famous tab but that is only the way to PLAY it. Why
is there not some database, like alle the tabs, which contains information
for the specific sound (and gear) of the guitar?

For example, the following is not true because I don't know the gear he is
playing with, Slash/Guns n' Roses/Sweet Child of Mine.

Guitar: Gibson les Paul, Bridge Pick-Up
Amp: Marshall
Effect: Wah - Cry Baby,
Distortion: Boss no 1 pedal, distortion 75%, bas 60%, mid 70%, treble 70%
Delay: Left: 220 miliseconds, feedback 20%
Right: 400 milliseconds, feedback 40%

So, first the original gear is being explained.
After that, everyone is free to come with alternatives,
For example, You don't have the Boss pedal but a Rocktron.
Wich settings on the Rocktron are the closest to the original?
In a wiki-style, all the users in the world could add information which he
has sorted out.

I have not the time and the knowledge but it seems to me that I would search
regurarely in this kind of database...

Nobody else has the time, either. And nobody has knowledge of all
the recording sessions you and everbody else wants to know about.
There is no profit incentive. And few people really care.

Such a database would be of minor interest only, and not very
useful. There are many ways to approximate any given sound. Even if
you were to use the same gear, you wouldn't sound the same. So what
if it doesn't sound identical? Use your imagination. You can easily
come up with something good enough or better.

Actually, there is...at least as far as a gear list is concerned.
here's an example:

The other side of the coin is that TABs on the internet are fast
disappearing due to artists asserting their right to control the
distribution of their music in all forms - including the crumby TAB.
If you ask me they are hypocrite's anyway.  Do you think they didn't
learn their craft from TABs they got off the net or through sheet-
music they copied, or even from a guitar tutor who provided them with
copies of copyrighted materials such as facsimiles of sheet-music that
even the tutor didn't go out and buy?  How much do you think a house
of cards is worth?  As much as what Metallica and the like have? Not
likely!  I don't believe in intellectual rights for property that has
either been recorded, mixed and mastered all with software that they
nicked, or a skill that has been acquired with the use of stolen
(pirated) material.

Artists justify what they charge for their time eg tutoring and what
they produce eg cds performances by saying it has taken years and
years of hard work to gather the experience and knowledge to do what
they do.  How much do you think they should be allowed to charge for
cds produced with stolen software, for experience gained through
studying copyrighted material that they have stolen?

My opinion:  $0.00

Doug,

If you think for a minute about how long tabs have been available on line
I hope you'll quickly conclude that most of the current super stars did not
learn by downloading from the web. Maybe they passed xerox copies around,
instead. You're trying to support your beliefs without any real facts,
though.

Downloading from the net is only one way of pirating (stealing) from
the owners of intellectual property.  You said that maybe they passed
around xerox copies.  Do you not think that that constitutes
intellectual property theft in every way that downloading from the net
does?  You say I have no real facts.  Well you're right!  No facts -
just experience.  The experience of not knowing a single musician that
ISN'T into intellectual property theft.  I have even seen xerox
machines in music shops with teaching rooms for the convenience of the
tutors who habitually steal by photocopying other people's music.
They even let students of the tutors copy copyrighted material AND
they charged for the privilege!

Musicians are people too.  Do you really think just because someone
eventually becomes a super-star that they are any different?  But you
are right, no facts about any one super-star, just a wealth of
experience all my life of what everyday musicians get up to!  And it
IS ILLEGAL!  And it is every bit as hypocritical as I stated before!

What are your experiences?  Do you have a selection of sheet music you
have stolen?  Do you ever frequent online TAB sites to download?  Ever
used Guitar Pro to learn copyrighted material?  Do you know others
that have or do? No? Then you need to get out more.  I am just stating
that this is industry-wide practice.

Given that most of the tabs I've seen online have been horribly,
horribly fucked up and sound nothing like the original tune, should
these tabs still be considered illegal?

Isn't it bad enough that, since the availability of tabs on the
internet, the art of learning a song by ear has been all but totally
lost? Do we really need to add to that the definitive listing of
whatever equipment was used to accomplish the guitar sound? Is it
really too much to ask of a supposed musician to sit down with a
recording for a few hours, pick out the patterns, and use what gear
they have to approximate the sound as closely as possible? I think
we're losing our way here guys. Ear training is a pretty integral part
of learning any instrument, and if it's not part of your daily regimen
you're shortchanging yourself.

People have invented new ways to try and steal
what isn't theirs.

Before the internet, obviously people couldn't

Before credit cards, people couldn't steal

Stealing someone else's property never has been right,

very usefull to use your ears instead of a tab in decomposing guitar-solo's.
On the other hand, the net profit of tabs to my guitar-playing has been
great: some solo's I would never have deducted by myself but I can play now.
I learned who to play and I learned which tricks and licks were used.
And, allthough I think I know what you mean and somewhere I agree but it is
also very moralistic to neglect the evolution of all things. I assume you
play on an electric amplifier, on an electric guitar, probably with effects,
... All due to modern progress and &quot;electric&quot; (r)evolution and when they
were just invented they were also recieved with a lot of scepsis...

&gt; &gt;&gt;    If you think for a minute about how long tabs have been available on line
&gt; &gt;&gt; I hope you'll quickly conclude that most of the current super stars did not
&gt; &gt;&gt; learn by downloading from the web. Maybe they passed xerox copies around,
&gt; &gt;&gt; instead. You're trying to support your beliefs without any real facts,
&gt; &gt;&gt; though.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Dave M.

&gt; &gt; Downloading from the net is only one way of pirating (stealing) from
&gt; &gt; the owners of intellectual property.  You said that maybe they passed
&gt; &gt; around xerox copies.  Do you not think that that constitutes
&gt; &gt; intellectual property theft in every way that downloading from the net
&gt; &gt; does?  You say I have no real facts.  Well you're right!  No facts -
&gt; &gt; just experience.  The experience of not knowing a single musician that
&gt; &gt; ISN'T into intellectual property theft.  I have even seen xerox
&gt; &gt; machines in music shops with teaching rooms for the convenience of the
&gt; &gt; tutors who habitually steal by photocopying other people's music.
&gt; &gt; They even let students of the tutors copy copyrighted material AND
&gt; &gt; they charged for the privilege!

&gt; &gt; Musicians are people too.  Do you really think just because someone
&gt; &gt; eventually becomes a super-star that they are any different?  But you
&gt; &gt; are right, no facts about any one super-star, just a wealth of
&gt; &gt; experience all my life of what everyday musicians get up to!  And it
&gt; &gt; IS ILLEGAL!  And it is every bit as hypocritical as I stated before!

&gt; Given that most of the tabs I've seen online have been horribly,
&gt; horribly fucked up and sound nothing like the original tune, should
&gt; these tabs still be considered illegal?- Hide quoted text -

Damn staright- I have rarely encountered tabs that were completely
accurate- even the expertly tabbed out stuff you get in the authorized
books can be inaccurate. Having said that, I rarely use tabs unless
I'm totally stumped- I rely on my ear 99% of the time- sometimes I'm
wrong, but I'll eventually figure it out. Shit, man, I download music
off the net all the time. If I like it, I'll buy it. If I don't, I
won't. Sometimes I can get stuff online that I can't find anywhere. I
like the curveball that internet piracy has thrown to the industry- if
any industry was more deserving of getting ripped off, it's probably
the oil industry- both have been ripping people off for decades.
Creative musicians can use to their advantage. Now, you don't have to
listen to what the industry tries to forcefeed you. the industry has
been slow to respond to the threat of piracy. That's their problem-
they've been ripping off musicians longer than anyone. Now, real music
not driven by the profit motive can proliferate and actually has.

It is all a matter of taste, of definition. There is no absolute law who
describes that you can sing a popular song under the shower for free but
when you add a guitar to it you have to pay. In my opinion the music is free
to decompose. Just like a car. You can buy a Toyota and totally strip the
car and put the information on the internet. Implicity, the knowledge of the
car is all ready &quot;on the street&quot;. Suppose, in a few years they invent a
program who decomposes the music for you, should the program be prohibited?
The music (and chords)  is allready in the open. Or is it withhold for only
the few talented players who play anything they hear in just a few minutes?
I think it ought to be free. This is my opinion.

No, I don't now, and never have used &quot;tabs&quot;. When I first started
playing in 1964 I occaisonally used what were called fake books... and
that's exactly what they were. I couldn't get what I wanted out of 'em
so I either learned the songs from better players or just stuck my ear
to the record player speaker and took the time to figure the fucker
out.

And I don't think it's &quot;moralistic&quot; of me to to neglect the evolution
of things. I just think that it's more beneficial in the long run to
train your ear. The rewards are paramount to understanding what you're
doing.

I do play electric guitar... I do use an amp.... but no, I don't use
any effect pedals at all.

If you wanna use tabs, more power to you. I still think it's a crutch,
and you're denying yourself the necessity of putting in the effort to
teach yourself how to &quot;absorb&quot; the essence of recorded sound. The more
you listen, the more you learn. It's quite simple.

I have no issue with having to pay royalties on a live performance (if
and only if that's the way the deal with the originator was written), of
any kind.  I have no issue with sharing revenue with an originator if I
generate revenue from his original work.

I do have an issue to having to pay for learning from a peer if that
peer offers me information or knowledge as he has gained it on his own
terms, or if I offer to correct him in the interest of accuracy and an
exchange of learning.  I have a couple casual students, and I support a
local working band with a great deal of my personal experience and
expense...I don't expect or take any money from them.  I just enjoy what
I'm doing, and what they're doing.  And I learn things in the process,

Not at all.
You can learn the rudiments of music from the net

If you want to jump back and forth between definitions,
I'll probably entertain you, at least for a while.
Here's how it works...

You hear a song, you figure it out, you perform it
in your bedroom, no problem.

You hear a song, you figure it out, you perform it
in Joe's Bar, for money or gratis. Joe has to pay
for the license to have it performed in his venue.

You hear a song, you figure it out, you transcribe it,
you study it YOURSELF, no problem.

You hear a song, you figure it out, you transcribe it,
you make that transcription (tabs or otherwise, correct
or full of errors) available to others, you're in violation.

The copyright laws were enacted to protect the rights of the
originators to profit from their work. If I transcribe YOUR
song and distribute it, I'm interfering with the possibility
of YOU profiting from it. Doesn't matter if you actually do
choose to transcribe and distribute it.

Here's two scenarios.

You're my guitar teacher. I come to you and say
&quot;Here's my version of Sunshine of Your Love&quot;.
You say:
Instead of an Am for the 2nd chord, try a C Major.

2nd scenario&quot;
You're my guitar teacher. I come to you and say
&quot;I want to learn Sunshine of Your Love&quot;. You transcribe the
arrangement from memory and give it to me.

The 2nd scenario is technically in violation of copyright.
Doesn't matter if you agree or if you think it's right.
Doesn't matter if it's so minor that nobody will ever
get caught. It's still a violation of copyright. You've
interfered with the composer's right to make a profit from
selling the transcription.

I'm not saying it's not done or people don't all agree with it.
I AM saying that your personal opinion, or mine or anyone else's,
doesn't change the law. That law was designed to protect the rights
of the composer to profit from his work.

At first, English is not my native language (Dutch is) so it is hard for me
to express myself in a right way, there where subtlety is needed when it is
about law.
Maybe Lupus is technical right, I agree for my self with Rufus.

Do I understand Lupus correct that if you change 1 chord, there is no
violation of the law? If so, a band who is earning money from gigs with
covers, all they have to do is change the final chord into a very different
chord. In that way there is no law violation and the audience will notice
the false note and they know that the band pays no royalties. Fair and
square: the band does not pay royalties, in return they treat the audience
on a (one) false note. That is the price of a cheap ticket to the concert...

&gt; You can learn the rudiments of music from the net

I guess it all depends on the definition of &quot;rudiments&quot;...all I useem

Not unless someone makes it an issue because I do something wholly out

Granted.  What I'm saying is that the law is outmoded and ill-fitted to
the reality of people's behavior.  And that the whole system of things
is ripe for some revolutionary evolution.  Old thinking needs to be
thrown out altogether.

What I see today is two camps - people like Trent Reznor of Nine Inch
Nails quitting his record contract, direct marketing his music to the
fans from his own studio on his own label, and even making some of his
master tracks available for fans to remix themselves using Apple's
Garage Band; and people like yourself that espouse continuing to operate
within the existing outmoded legal framework.

I think that people like Mr. Reznor are pioneers and are going to
eventually be the future of the distribution of music, and maybe of
artistic endeavors in general - particularly for any form of graphic or
digital creativity.  People don't like to say it, but the porn folks
have the single best and most efficient business model on the net, bar
none.  Anyone that produces a chunk of digital information that suits
that delivery system and biz model - and music certainly falls into that
sort of commodity - could stand to take a lesson from that.  Making
music isn't enough - you have to be a businessman, too...and musicians
have historically on the whole been lousy businessmen.  That's not going
to float anymore.

I was discussing such an idea with a freelance photographer friend of
mine in the midwest a couple nights ago - seems he and I have developed
this same idea independently, and he's not even a musician.  If we've
each thought it, someone else surely has, and is probably doing it - and
I'll jump for joy for anyone that beats me to it and proves me right
even if I don't get the chance to do it for myself.

Do NOT accuse every other musician in history,
and do NOT EVER accuse me of stealing copyrighted
material. My ethics, and I'd certainly guess the ethics
of the overwhelming majority of musicians, are not in
the toilet like yours.

You are a thief and you're just trying to make
it seem ok by saying &quot;everyone is a thief&quot;.
That flavor of ethics doesn't work with me.
And it doesn't work with the American
legal system.

I didn't accuse you of &quot;stealing&quot;, I accused you of learning and
interacting with other musicians whether that be in strict &quot;violation of
