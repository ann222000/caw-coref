One can establish anything by invoking a force which doesn't obey known
physics to account for the behaviour of a form of matter which doesn't
obey known physics. But is it science?

Umm, "teleconnection"???

Also, _all_ the currently accepted forces were
once new to science, and everything below the
size level of gross matter was once new to
science, so your argument doesn't hold much

That is not a force. That is a proposed answer to unresolved questions
concerning the unification of quantum theory and general relativity. In
fact it does appear to be a uniquely consistent resolution.

You may like to know, btw, since you raised this point some while ago,
that while the motion of an individual star cannot be determined with
sufficient accuracy to test the teleconnection prediction, I am engaged
in analysing the Doppler and proper motions local stars for which there
is an unbiassed database of thousands, and having none of the ambiguity
or the lack of homogeneity of the SN data sets. This time it does look
like a conclusive result is possible. I will let you know what that
result is in due course.

True. But before it was meaningful to discuss such forces and such
matter, there was clear empirical evidence both for its existence and
its behaviour. In contrast the evidence for Cold Dark Matter and its
behaviour is about as clear as the evidence for Phlogiston, and I don't
think that was scientific either.

You know, considering that you recommend so heavily
in your disputes with Chalky and John Bell for
deference to the known experts when it comes to
standard candle quality measures, velocity error
bars, and other data, which support your analyses,
it seems a bit self serving that you can be so much
in denial on the growing evidence from rafts of
other, equally skilled experts that cold dark matter
exists, and that only a limited amount of it can be
MACHOs, evidence that seemingly confounds your
theories.

Consult Ted's just posted URL,

http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0107248

for both example direct content, and a long, long
list of references on the subject.

That particular evidence, moreover, is right here at
home in the Local Group, not in galaxies far, far
away where accuracy of standard candles is
exceptionally important. Having it here, and using
the "least astonishment" that probably what we see
here is pretty typical of the universe, makes it
likely that dark matter is everywhere, not just here
where we live, and surely not of "Phlogiston
credibility".

The recent Hubble data and image from survey of the
dark matter lensing in a narrow window toward the
universe is pretty convincing on an
"authoritativeness" level as well:

http://imgsrc.hubblesite.org/hu/db/2007/01/images/a/formats/print.jpg
http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2007/01/full/

considering that even rating exceptionally scarce and
valuable Hubble time is already an indication of great
respect from other astronomers.

How about if you start letting the data play on an even
field, instead of one so severely tilted toward your
theories?

As I said in that thread, the bottom line is one consults the facts, not

Precisely of that level imv. Worse, actually, because phlogiston was not
in conflict with scientific knowledge at the time. But it did have many
self contradictory properties swept under the carpet, in so far as I
know, and that does make it very similar.

Despite repeated pooh-poohing from Charles Francis,
apparently the rest of the scientific community has
no particular problem anticipating that dark matter
and dark energy are going to require some rewriting of
the rules of physics.

This eminently readable popularization of the
issues:

http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?chanID=sa006&amp;articleID=1356B82B-E7F2...

says in part:

"Not only does dark energy appear to make up the
bulk of the universe, but its existence, if it
stands the test of time, will probably require the
development of new theories of physics."

Pay special attention to the overview and sidebars,
which are also informative.

Of course we already know that we need to develop a new theory of
physics, and have done for about seventy years since quantum theory and
general relativity are not compatible. All I have been saying is that
Cold Dark matter and dark energy are symptomatic of the type of thing
which arises when there is something wrong in the model used to describe
physics. They do indeed require some rewriting of the rules of physics.

As far as I know the only rewriting of the rules of physics to date
which unifies general relativity and quantum theory in a consistent
model is the teleconnection. I have tested numerous empirical
predictions of the teleconnection and found them consistent with
observation in a universe with neither cold dark matter nor dark energy.

So were and did special and general relativity.

In the minds of most working astronomers, dark
matter and energy _are_ the needed changes.

You are falling for the old logical trap that when
something is not understood (here the formulation
that will blend quantum and gravity concerns), that
lack of understanding constitutes affirmative
evidence for unlikely explanations.

That simply isn't true, never has been, whether the
resulting unlikely explanation of what isn't
understood is deities or teleconnections.

There's _lots_ of very good, thoroughly peer
reviewed evidence for dark matter, and more arriving
constantly. That's why it has become the
overwhelmingly held opinion among practicing
cosmologists.

http://images.google.com/images?q=hubble+dark.matter+map

Can you really look at a cold dark matter map
[developed by 70-odd scientists who can "do the
math" and are practicing astronomers of the
reputation rank that rate Hubble time], covering
half the span of time, that even shows cold dark
matter collapsing over time from its own gravity,
shows it lensing the distant stars, shows it both in
and between galaxies and clusters of galaxies, and
simply _ignore_ its reality, and claim there is _no
such evidence_?

What, for you, would _constitute_ evidence, if that
survey does not?

"Teleconnection" is so far only a working theory in
your own mind, and your frequent confessions that
you are learning astronomical theory and data as you
go along, while at the same time the persistent
evidence that you just ignore facts inconvenient to
your theories, doesn't hold out much hope that
teleconnection is ever going to be a theory anywhere
_but_ your mind.

How you are working isn't how science is done, at
least not "real science". Your "teleconnection"
theory is judged now and will be judged forever
after on how much like a scientist you function in
creating that theory, including that all available
evidence was included/considered in checks that it
"worked".

You need desperately much to internalize the concept
that _one_ confounding datum sinks a theory, and
stop ignoring the ones that do or will sink yours.

FWIW

contrary evidence has strong explanatory
power for your recent participation in

Actually not, a) because I do understand a formulation that does blend

There wasn't any evidence that disagreed with me. Actually, some of the

It is all based on the analysis of redshift and/or lensing.

Of course. They can do the math of classical general relativity, but
they cannot, as yet do the math of the teleconnection. When that math is
done it will produce an entirely different map. I wouldn't mind betting
that it produces a map with no cold dark matter.

I don't think I agree with that. Compared to the great mathematicians of
history, he was not one of the best. I don't think he made any
contributions to mathematics, though he came close because he discovered
teleparallelism independently of Cartan, albeit after him. Certainly his
intuition was very strong, but intuition which is not guided and
constrained by mathematics is of doubtful worth. I say he was a
mathematical theorist because his results were not just expressed in the
language of mathematics, they were arrived at through applying the
method of mathematics, that is to say start with as few postulates as
possible and use only mathematical deduction to derive the results from
those postulates. It is not right to say he was no better at mathematics
than other physicists. If one names physicists who were good at
mathematics, then I would describe them too as mathematical theorists,
Dirac, Feynman, Penrose, Weyl. I am not so sure about Witten. His work
seems to me to lack the fundamental insight into the relationship of
mathematics to physics which I expect of a true mathematician, rather
than someone who is just clever at solving problems. There is still no
evidence that string theory is either physics or mathematics. But if one
talks of physicists generally, then they are substantially less good at
mathematics. Misner, Thorne Wheeler for example, even moot the idea that
that one should dispense with axiomatisation in modern physics, and the
general standard of mathematics taught in leading departments like
DAMPT, where I studied along with DPMMS, is of a very poor and sloppy
character (the maths taught at DPMMS was not sloppy, but much of it was
of questionable relevance).

[Mod. note: contrary to popular belief, that's DAMTP -- mjh]

... to start with. By the time he had completed GR, he was, by
the standards of the man on the horse-drawn Clapham Omnibus, a
mathematician. If I remember my biography of Einstein (a school project
many years ago), he had to spend month travelling to visit a
mathematician to learn the ins and outs of "tensor mathematics" around
about 1911 as part of the GR project. To me, that suggests that he was
pretty near the bleeding edge of mathematics at the time, even if as a
follower, not a leader.

Not particularly disagreeing with you - this factoid (from IIRC
Britannica 1972 edition) stuck in my mind as I was struggling to get my
head around integral calculus at the time and it made the wild-haired

&gt; mathematician. If I remember my biography of Einstein (a school project
&gt; many years ago), he had to spend month travelling to visit a
&gt; mathematician to learn the ins and outs of &quot;tensor mathematics&quot; around
&gt; about 1911 as part of the GR project. To me, that suggests that he was
&gt; pretty near the bleeding edge of mathematics at the time, even if as a
&gt; follower, not a leader.
&gt;        Not particularly disagreeing with you - this factoid (from IIRC
&gt; Britannica 1972 edition) stuck in my mind as I was struggling to get my
&gt; head around integral calculus at the time and it made the wild-haired
&gt; one seem more human to me.
">

I guess Einstein was in his 30's before he even heard
of tensors, many of us were learning them in teens &amp;
20's. Perhaps a good mathematical physicist is one
who chooses the right math for the problem, in that case
AE did an outstanding job, we've never looked back.

About Dark Matter, has anyone an estimate of the
density of Electromagnetic Radiation that fills our
universe. I'm wondering about whether or not we can
eliminate that as insignificant.

PS: I've tried some calculations on this, for example
the intensity flux through a cubic kilometer. Now I
can see the Andromeda galaxy, with a 7mm eye
pupil. So the radiation flux on a km^2 area would
be, &gt;10^10 brighter.

[Mod. note: yes, the photon energy density (from all sources) is
negligible compared to the baryon energy density at the present time

Your reference prompts the name:

Levi-Civita (Tensor originator)

ref:
The The Mechanical Universe
Annenberg foundation
Produced by the California Institute of Technology and Intelecom. 1985.

This series is somewhat elementary but very interesting in its scope
and its relating the personalities of physics.

Albert Einstein corresponded with Levi-Civita
(they never met)
of which 6 letters exist (Einstein's).
Levi-Civita kept all documentation.
Einstein threw everything away.

Levi-Civita (Tensor originator) disputed Einsteins development (circa 1914).
Through physical insight, Einstein proved to be right.

The letter discourse was very honorable
particularly when you consider that Einstein
and Levi-Civita were from different countries Germany and Italy
which were soon at War (WW 1).

Levi-Civita wrote in Italian, Einstein in German.

(Such honor should be emulated
with correspondence among current physicists
if anything worthwhile is to be achieved)

Einstein and Levi-Civita remained friends through the 20's and 30's
at which time Einstein moved to Princeton
to escape Nazi Germany.

Levi-Civita did not fair so well.
As a Jew, he was stripped of all credentials
and died alone in a hotel room in Rome, 1941.

Asked of Einstein:
What do you remember of Italy?
his response was:
"Levi-Civita and spaghetti"

Indeed. The first stage of the mathematical treatment of a physical
problem is to abstract from the problem postulates which can then be
used for deduction.

Certainly you cannot dispense with deduction, unless you are happy to
arrive at false conclusions. There is no means of making correct
deductions without this mathematical apparatus. What one may do, and
indeed what mathematicians should have been doing, is clarify and
simplify the mathematics. In practice, the reverse has been taking place
- I think because pure and applied maths have effectively become
divorced in the 20th century. Pure mathematicians do not address the
issue to any extent, and applied mathematicians, by and large, do not
have the requisite understandings. Instead they seem to make things more
complicated and more obscure, as though it is a game to show how clever
they are. I'm afraid I don't think that is clever at all.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

I fear that is true. If one dispenses with the philosophical foundations
it is rapidly the case that the mathematics ceases to have any meaning
or worth beyond its predictive ability.

Indeed. According to the teleconnection, this is precisely the reason
for dark energy and cold dark matter. You ought to approve, since this
model was found by going back to Einstein's philosophical foundations,
and by applying them within the context of philosophical foundations of
quantum theory.

It is at least also due to the fact that one person could easily read
all the literature.  Even as late as the 1930s, one could read the
entire Physical Review (at least Feynman could).  Thus, an "outsider"
had it easier to let his results speak for themselves.

We do seem to be in agreement on a number of levels. I certainly do

I don't really see how you can talk about the "philosophical
foundations" of QM at all. QM is a data driven science with a set of,
admittedly, very elegant and very successful rules, which were
conjured up to statistically explain and model the apparently wierd
behaviour of martter at the QM level. I would hesitate to call this a
philosophy, any more than I would call a car mechanic's toolkit a
philosophy.

Consequently, it seems to me that you approach could equally well be
interpreted as a splicing together of these two disciplines which, I
must admit, I still find unconvincing.

Therefore, I prefer to continue down the path that we have taken,
which involves a more rigorous and comprehensive examination of the
logical consequences of Einstein's fundamental axioms, in isolation,
in order to arrive at a deeper unerstanding of the totality.

Philosophy aside, the acid test of which approach is best, hinges on
their respective predictions, and conformance, or otherwise, to
observational evidence.

In specific relation to our respective predicted dynamisms of the
accelerating expansion of the Universe, and conformance, or otherwise,
to astronomical data, I suggest we simply wait to see, for example,.
whether it is your or Chalky's analysis which gets approved for peer
reviewed publication.

Actually that fundamental step is where I started, and it is how I came
to the realisation that the teleconnection is necessary to a consistent
quantum theory, long before I realised that it had any empirical
consequences. A referee complained that in my Relational Quantum Gravity
paper there are eighteen pages devoted mainly to the foundations of
quantum theory before I attempt to consider gravity.

That is how it is usually approached. I confess I gagged on such an
approach as an undergraduate, and declined to take the courses as far as
the exam at the moment the lecturer told us that if one thought about
why it was true one would end up failing that exam. I have mainly
learned quantum theory from books on foundations, not from the usual
application driven approach.

It is a splicing together of the two disciplines. In the teleconnection
paper I do simply splice together the disciplines with a view to showing
the empirical predictions and comparing them to data. But there is a
much deeper paper which underlies that and logically comes before it,
namely the Relational Quantum Gravity paper.
