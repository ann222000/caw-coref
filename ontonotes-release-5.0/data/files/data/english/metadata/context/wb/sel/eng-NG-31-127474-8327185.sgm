I stole this from Slashdot.

hmccabe writes &quot;YouTube is currently taking submissions for their next
debate, in which the Republican candidates will answer questions. This
seems like a good opportunity to challenge those candidates who say
they
do not believe in evolution. But since I am not an expert in the
subject,
I would be interested in how you all feel the question should be
presented. For my own part, I think it is important to present the
overwhelming body of evidence on the subject as incontrovertible fact,
much the same way DNA evidence is presented during a criminal trial,
and
ask why the candidate feels they can pick and choose what facts they
believe in. Moreover, I am wary of coming across like Christopher
Hitchins, so vitriolic the candidate will defend themselves rather
than
answer the question. Perhaps the most important aspect of posing the
question is to inform the viewers who watch the debate that this is
really not a matter of opinion, but of science. So my question is:
'Hey
geneticists, have you considered addressing evolution in the YouTube
debates? Can you do it in 30 seconds?'&quot;

I don't think this is the right question.
I don't expect a politician to be able to protect scientific topics,
and it doesn't matter if they are real science or pseudo-science.

The real important question, is what that politician will do regarding
education.
Will he let the scientific community or his personal belief dictate
what children will learn in schools?

I agree, but if it is fair game to ask someone his/her views on
abortion and gay-marriage, stem-cell research or evolution or a
scientific topic is fair game too.

After all, a president executes, he does not make laws.

Topics like gay marriage, stem cell research or abortions are moral
questions.
Science can help by providing information like if homosexuality is
social or a result of genetics, if the fetus feels pain, but the
decision itself is not scientific.

When it comes to education, especially if the subject in question is
science, this should be purely a scientific question.

Except that evolution is not a purely scientific question for many
Christians in the USA.  It actually goes towards how personal stances
affect policy.  Stem-cell funding and abortion are classic examples.
Evolution too is such a issue in the USA, since biblical creationism
is touted as the competing premise by the ignoramii.

Given the fact that the theory of evolution is *the* cornerstone of
the biological sciences, Republican's have effectively undermined
science education and, by proxy, the advancement of scientific
discovery by directly hindering progress in this vital field of
science. If it is the position of the conservative party to advance
science in our schools ( a discipline which we all know is severly
lacking) and lead the world in scientific discovery, then why is it
that they place pandering to religious fundamnetalists for votes over
and above the best interest of science, education and the American
people?

LL: I'd ask any anti-evolutionist if they take vaccinations and
antibiotics; whether they give them to their children; whether they've
ever had surgery; whether they believe in purifying water,
pasteurizing milk, and sterilizing instruments, among other things.
All of these things are based on evolution. If they really don't
believe evolution exists, they should not be doing any of those
things.

Some will say, ridiculously, that they believe in micro evolution, but
not macro evolution, which is like saying they believe in tiny genetic
heredity but not big genetic heredity.

Science and morality aren't exactly two different universes, either.
Science is driven by the motivation to do what humans think would be
&quot;good&quot; to do. Evolution is treated like a &quot;moral&quot; issue as well
because some people think it is right to believe a fairy tale and some
people think it is right to believe science.

Senate vote of being a majority ruling in 2004, with just the

Why does California, a state so blue that Republican presidential

Seriously, I know the Republican party is fractured right now because
of the religion issue. There are many Republicans who do not like the
religious tone their party's politics have developed. Nevertheless,
they are in control and I don't think they'll be going anywhere
anytime soon. I suggest you vote Democrat if you don't want them in

And I do not believe in creationism.  Should I?  The &quot;bad rap&quot; is
justified if all Republicans support it. They do not.  If you go by
majority then all Americans are responsible for the Iraq war, which
was supported by large poll numbers.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You think it is possible that the gay-marriage ban comes within a

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in a Republican Senate.

&gt; &gt; &gt; That's not too impressive. Plus, we aren't really talking about gay
&gt; &gt; &gt; marriage.

&gt; &gt; We are talking about religious affiliations of parties, which is where

&gt; &gt; I do not know of any poll that identifies disbelief in evolution

&gt; And, rightfully so. People who are aligned with similar beliefs

&gt; generally correct, however. It is an issue we should all be concerned
&gt; about.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Why does California, a state so blue that Republican presidential
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; candidates avoid even campaigning there, amend its state constituion
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to get a ban on gay-marriage?

&gt; &gt; &gt; Because religious bigots are everywhere. Nevetheless, I don't see how
&gt; &gt; &gt; gay marriage pertains to evolution/science deniers.

&gt; &gt; It is all based on religion.  I'll withdraw the discussion as soon as

Yes, that was part of my point.  And The Dover board is in...

The point is that there are really no blue states, but heavy
concentrated blue areas.  The country is predominantly red.  So it is
quite easy to point to AF or NY and claim that there will be no
evolution deniers, or creationism fanatics, but just about everywhere
else you'll have this, regardless of what state it is in.

The example of gay-marriage though was a state-wide referendum, and

Not quite. Republicans backed by fundmentalists were at the forefront,

I would like to see the question focused on a purely legal and
educational ground.  That is to say, approach it from the current
debates in the public schools.

Many school districts are arguing for the inclusion of religious-based
understandings of the origin of human, other animal, and plant life
and origins the universe.  These alternate understandings are often
called Intelligent Design or Creationism to varying degrees.
Understandings of these same origins from the perspectives of
evolution and abiogenesis have a substantial amount of scientific data
to support them as verifiable scientific theories to help us
understand the origins and development of life.  It would seem that
any basis for these origins other than that which is strictly on clear
scientific grounds would be a clear confusion of something inherently
religious with the role of a public educational institution as one
that serves the ends of the state.  Moreover, clear problems with both
intelligent design and creationism are that neither can be supported
by scientific evidence or a scientific method to yield a scientific
result.  It would thus seem that either of these understandings would
yield confusion in the study of science itself in a science classroom.

What are the constitutional justifications for including any theory of
the origins of life and the cosmos that is directly related to any
religious understanding of these origins such as creationism or
intelligent design?  If there are clear constitutional reasons for the
former question, what are the scientific reasons that you understand
for any inclusion of intelligent design or creationism or any other
religiously based understanding of the origins of life and the
universe in the science classroom?

&gt; &gt; When it comes to education, especially if the subject in question is

&gt; Except that evolution is not a purely scientific question for many

&gt; Evolution too is such a issue in the USA, since biblical creationism

This is why I think the questions needs to be focused on what someone
in a legal position can affect: the constitutionality of including any
understanding of the nature of reality that has clear religious
justification and also, the implications for including something in a
science classroom that is not scientific by its nature.  teaching good
science means teaching good hypothesis building and theorizing.  You
cannot do either of these with ID or creationism that by their nature
lack this level of investigation and methodology.  Now including them
in the vein of saying, here's why these theories are NOT science might
be good, but it is not even pretending that they are viable
alternative theories to origins because they are not actually
theories.  In a science classroom, the responsibility is to teach kids
good science, how to think like scientists, and to do good science.
Especially for the novice, confusing science with anything that is
only tangentially science at best does a disservice to that central
pedagogical outcome.
