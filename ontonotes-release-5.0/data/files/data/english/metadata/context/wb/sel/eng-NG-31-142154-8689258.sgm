&gt; The running amok of the Malay
&gt; Written by Rajen Panikkar
&gt; Saturday, 17 February 2007
&gt; The running amok of the Malay: a mental 'culture-bound' syndrome or another myth
&gt; of the 'native races'?
&gt; Born and raised in Malaysia, and having lived there for much of my life, I am of
&gt; course familiar with the Malay's alleged tendency to unpredictable murderous
&gt; frenzy, his 'running amok'. The Malay's tendency to run amok is one of the many
&gt; racialised beliefs that permeate the Malaysian consciousness to this day.
&gt; However I first came across the classification of amok as a bona fide scientific
&gt; 'syndrome' only recently when familiarising myself with the master text of
&gt; psychiatry, the Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (the DSM),
&gt; as is required of any aspiring clinical psychologist. Another common belief that
&gt; pertains to the Malay is that of his indolence, a myth famously exploded by the
&gt; late honourable Professor Syed Alatas in his great work The myth of the lazy
&gt; native (1977). It must be said that these commonly promulgated beliefs do not
&gt; match my actual experiences of living in Malaysia for almost thirty years. I
&gt; have yet, for example, to witness an amok attack despite having spent over
&gt; thirty years of my life in Malaysia, and this singular fact provoked me to
&gt; investigate further this classification of amok as mental disorder of
&gt; psychiatry.

&gt; In a recent attempt to read the social/ cultural with the natural, to
&gt; incorporate cultural/ social factors as seems the fashion today, psychiatry has
&gt; formulated a new category of cultural disorders in its classification (and
&gt; diagnosis) of mental disorders - mental syndromes that are supposedly unique in
&gt; that they are confined to a specific culture. Amok is one such
&gt; Culture-Bound-Syndrome (CBS), as are koro and latah. It soon occurred to me that
&gt; these CBSs are 'syndromes' of cultures that could be classified as other than
&gt; First-World', Western, modern or 'developed'. Not only are these the exotic
&gt; behaviours of the so-called 'Third-World' peoples, I was also struck by the
&gt; highly pejorative nature of their 'writing' by contemporary psychiatry. Reading
&gt; historical, and psychiatric or psychological descriptions of amok only
&gt; reinforced this impression. Psychiatric and lay characterizations of the Malay
&gt; malaise of amok are invariably as dramatic and incendiary as the act itself - so
&gt; much so that they tend towards cliché and not scientific fact. Inevitably it
&gt; also occurred to me that this writing was bizarre and distorted and likely
&gt; entirely fictional, i.e. delusional.

&gt; The Western writing of amok

&gt; Of all the means of taking human life none are as unpredictable and dramatic in
&gt; its senseless ferocity, none as gratuitous as that of the legendary running
&gt; amok, as it is represented by the great Western Canon. In comparison an
&gt; assassination is politically motivated, and murder is an act that similarly
&gt; requires reason, mens rea, for its modern legal assignment. That the Malay
&gt; customarily, according to mainly Western writing, counts, unpredictably or
&gt; spontaneously 'runs amok' in his homicidal acts suggests that he is largely
&gt; bereft of man's reason. When investigating these Western accounts of amok I
&gt; stumbled upon the following account.

&gt; 'As he read the clipping he heard the clock strike eleven in the market place.
&gt; He finished the clipping and handed it back. As he turned into the market he
&gt; heard the cry, &quot;Amok! Amok! Amok!&quot; And there was Ali with his kris in front of
&gt; the drug store. The shutters fell like a guillotine. The old market women were
&gt; scampering off with the agility of rats or evil spirits.

&gt; Three of them were too slow.'

&gt; Typical as this representation of amok may seem, what is atypical then is that
&gt; the author is William S. Burroughs (1971), perhaps the Beat Generation's
&gt; pre-eminent poet. Burrough's account, derived within an 'alternative' site of
&gt; Western culture, illustrates for me the west's all-pervasive and unerring
&gt; articulation and dissemination of the other as exotic, chaotic and inherently
&gt; savage. This lay depiction of the amok of the stereotypical Malay and/or
&gt; 'Mohammadan', Ali, is in fact as precise as any disseminated by the historical
&gt; and even 'scientific' discourses, of which the following is typical:

&gt; 'Amok is characterised by a sudden outburst of indiscriminate homicidal frenzy
&gt; directed towards bystanders and terminated by the killing, suicide, or capture
&gt; of the assailant.'

&gt; Both these characterisations conjure the legendary image of a temporarily
&gt; unhinged Malay, that otherwise gentlemanly and indolent race of Orientals,
&gt; spontaneously running through the teeming bazaars of the Malay Archipelago
&gt; slashing furiously at its blameless inhabitants, as if hacking his way through
&gt; its as teeming jungles. The alarm 'amok, amok' heralds his wayward bloody
&gt; progress, sending his terrified fellow citizens scurrying to safety behind
&gt; locked doors. This alarm also brings about that which he purportedly desires
&gt; most, an honourable if violent death by the hand of the society of men with whom
&gt; he had, when he entered into this homicidal-suicidal pact, broken his ties. This
&gt; writing hints at the innate volatile savagery, and thus his treachery, of the
&gt; 'lazy but gentlemanly' Malay, another infamous characterisation long carried by
&gt; the Encyclopaedia Brittanica.

&gt; Culture, race and the other in contemporary psychiatric discourse

&gt; Perhaps by unwitting, and uncritical, design, all the 'cultures' associated with
&gt; the CBSs are precisely those belonging to those once explicitly identified as
&gt; natives and savages in terms of a Western and historical primitivist discourse.
&gt; These cultures are not of the modern, developed or First World. No less a
&gt; luminary than Darwin, second only to Einstein amongst modern scientists,
&gt; promulgated the notion of the native/ savage races of man possessed of a
&gt; deficient, degraded and stagnant humanity, and predicted that at

&gt; 'some future period, not very distant as measured by centuries, the civilized
&gt; races of man will almost certainly exterminate, and replace, the savage races
&gt; throughout the world.'

&gt; Underdeveloped, developing, least developed countries (LDCs) and Third World are
&gt; amongst the many common euphemisms for the deficient (backward) peoples, always
&gt; in juxtaposition with West of course, employed in this persisting, and indeed
&gt; transforming, fundamentally primitivist discourse. They indicate significant
&gt; deficiencies in supposedly scientifically determined biological and social
&gt; (cultural) 'norms', when referring to those discovered, conquered, and enslaved
&gt; and colonised from the late 1400's. These terms are coincident with the gamut of
&gt; imperialist relationships between the West and its subordinate other; beginning
&gt; with the latter's 'discovery' by the former, and continuing through to the
&gt; social, political, economic and military dominance of the North and West over
&gt; the South and East to this day. In particular these terms maintain the
&gt; historical status of the 'lesser races' in advance of some elusive redemption
&gt; that is indubitably the West's project of modernity.

&gt; The specific case of the Malay native/ savage and his malaise; Amok has recently
&gt; been incorporated as a mental syndrome confined to the Malay, or Malaysian,
&gt; society or cultural area. The implicit assumption appears to be that Malaysian
&gt; and/ or Malay culture is a historical/scientific truth or constant, a
&gt; biologically and socially homogeneous collective, to which can be attributed
&gt; that specific historical/scientific truth that is the mental or behavioural
&gt; disorder of amok. J. E. Carr, like many other transcultural psychiatrists,
&gt; asserts that

&gt; 'amok as it is conceptualised by the Malay, will be found prevalent only among
&gt; people who share Malay conceptualisations and behavioural norms. Behaviour
&gt; similar to the amok phenomenon will found in other cultures but it will be
&gt; called a different name and conceptualized and valuated in their ways.'

&gt; Contemporary psychiatric discourse invokes culture when it confines the word
&gt; amok and the phenomena it signifies to the Malay. In doing so, it appropriates
&gt; and endorses prior historical and even scientific truths, but really myths, of
&gt; the Malay and his purported nature, in place of providing actual empirical
&gt; evidence with which to validate amok, and the CBSs in general, as a 'mental
&gt; syndrome'. In reading culture with the natural, the medical/ scientific and thus
&gt; universal, psychiatry has formulated a category of mental syndromes that are
&gt; supposedly 'culturally structured' (but which excludes all Western cultural
&gt; influence). Instead, the critical criterion, implicit though it may be, appears
&gt; to be that the CBS must be a syndrome of those 'cultures' that have at one time
&gt; or another considered to be native/ savage, by exactly coincident imperialist
&gt; and Enlightenment discourse. It is only when this criterion is made explicit
&gt; does the CBS as category appear to take meaning rather than exist as a
&gt; supposedly natural disorders arising from an organic origin, as is required with
&gt; all medical disorders. However what is intimated, however implicitly and
&gt; unwittingly, is exactly that. Amok and the other CBSs arise from deficiencies
&gt; innate to the savage/native state (and correspondingly not found in developed
&gt; Western peoples). What however is highly ironic is that amok as with almost all
&gt; of the catalogue of over 400 mental disorders ('universal' and 'culture-bound'),
&gt; even schizophrenia, in reality only exist as 'syndromes' or putative medical
&gt; disorders - as collection of signs that appear significant to what are in
&gt; reality culturally-bound elites (including psychiatrists) but with no distinct
&gt; unitary real organic basis (the 'medical model' or organic' physical basis or
&gt; 'disease entity').

&gt; With psychiatry's formulation of the CBS, amok does not only continue to be
&gt; written as a historical truth, it is further ...

&gt; &gt; Does he not tell you that he was sent by God? Does he not teach you

&gt; Dear Darion,
&gt; Let me first debunk your logic in the following saying:
&gt; &quot;Wrong !!! King or Queen (regardless he or she is married or not) use
&gt; &quot;We&quot;
&gt; because it represent he/she and the whole imperial system&quot;.

&gt; Debunking:
&gt; Imperatively, I am asking you: &quot;Is your Islamic Allah king or queen?
&gt; If not, then your Allah cannot use &quot;We&quot; UNLESS YOUR ALLAH IS NOT
&gt; SINGULAR  GOD, understand???&quot;  Please DO NOT FORGET that we are
&gt; debating whether Allah is one god or more, and if your Allah is one
&gt; god, then your Allah cannot use 'We' whenever your Allah speaks in the
&gt; Quran because, even then, your Allah is not king or queen based your
&gt; illogical sense of reasoning!
&gt; Moreover, I have explained clearly about monachy using 'we' as
&gt; follows:
&gt; &quot;We&quot; when used by one person speaking on behalf of a group is
&gt; acceptable but if by a Singular God, then it is unfathomable; and
&gt; when  &quot;we&quot; is used by a Monarch, it is taken to mean that the King is
&gt; speaking on behalf of the Royal Family, but if the King is not
&gt; married
&gt; and only himself alone in His kingdom, He will be most foolish to use
&gt; &quot;We&quot; when he speaks, right?

&gt; Wake up, Darion and pray to the True Allah who give WISDOM=Knowledge
&gt; of the truth of God with understanding !!!

&gt; Amen in Christ Jesus.- Hide quoted text -

Dear Darion,

Do you as a Muslim think it is lustful for a old man who claimed to be
a holy prophet to be eyeing at a 5 years baby girl for sex in marriage
at the age of 53?
Do you know that this was what your prophet, Mohammed, did: lusting to
have sex with a baby girl?

Please watch the following video link to know the dark secrets of
Mohammed:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZS_WakLDBes&amp;mode;=related&amp;search;=
Amen in Christ Jesus.

P S
Why are Muslims easily inveigled into becoming murderers- Islamic
TERRORISTS?
The reason is that Islam is a false religion having a false 'Holy
Book' - Quran WHICH-Mohammed said falsely- HAS THE COVENANT OF THE
PEOPLE OF THE BOOK (Israelites), but this covenant has not the LAW of
the True Allah (Elohiym) namely the 5 books of Moses of which clearly
gives one of the law of God: &quot; Thou shall not MURDER&quot;. The taking of
innocent lives is murder.
Muslims must know that when God give a COVENANT, They(Trinity) give a
COVENANT THAT COMES WITH THE LAW OF GOD, and the Quran mentions that
the Muslims were given the COVENANT of the people of the Book
(Israelites), but if Muslims were to read carefully, they will find
that there is no Law of the True Allah (Elohiym); and no where in the
Quran, was there the mentioning of the giving of the Law of God to
any
Muslim at all in respect of the so-called Islamic Covenant like the
giving of the Israelite Covenant to Moses, the Israelite.
God would not give a Covenant to the Muslims with a different set of
the Law of God; for God is wise and He would only give one and only
set of the Law of God for all people.
Hence, it explains why Muslims are killing Muslims, for example, the
sunni will kill even sunni when they become suicide-bombers, and
likewise the shites will kill the shites; all BECAUSE THE ISLAMIC
COVENANT IS FALSE, and hence, the Muslims have an EMPTY covenant
lacking the Law of the True Allah.
When questioned about EMPTY COVENANT, the Islamic religious teachers
will say that there are Haddiths, but make no mistake, Haddiths were
written by men, and THE HOLY BOOK IS WRITTEN BY GOD.
Finally, those Muslims who are wicked will become Islamic Terrorists,
and those Muslims who are not wicked will find the True Allah who
give
wisdom which is knowledge with understanding of the Truth of God
(Elohiym).
Amen.

Debunking:
So, Kewkahfatt, do you, Muslims, really think that it is alright for
your prophet, Mohammed, supposed to be holy especially in the aspect
of marriage to marry officially 11 wives and of one wife was a 40
years old woman named Khatijah who was old enough to be Mohammed's
mother at the time of marriage- Mohammed was only 25 years of age,
and
of another wife was a 9 years baby girl named Aisha at the time of
marriage- Mohammed was 57 years of age? And yet none of the ancient
prophets of God had 11 wives??? And yet the Quran has not even 1
Arabic prophet of God???
In the case of Aisha, Mohammed was eyeing her for sex in marriage
when
he, Mohammed, was 53 years old and Aisha was 5 years old little baby
girl; and then little Aisha at the age of 6 years old was betrothed
to
Mohammed at the age of 54 years old when sexual foreplays are allowed
according to Islamic law for marriage.
Marriage at the age of 9 between boy and girl of the same age is
acceptable according to other races of old custom, but NOT A GIRL OF
9
YEARS OLD WITH A OLD MAN OF 57 YEARS OF AGE !!! And when you,
Muslims,
accept such marriage, it not only shows how foolish you, Muslims, are
but also it reflects your foolishness when it comes to deciding what
is right and what is wrong !!!
Amen in Christ Jesus.

&gt; Dear Darion,
&gt; Let me first debunk your logic in the following saying:
&gt; &quot;Wrong !!! King or Queen (regardless he or she is married or not) use
&gt; &quot;We&quot;
&gt; because it represent he/she and the whole imperial system&quot;.

&gt; Debunking:
&gt; Imperatively, I am asking you: &quot;Is your Islamic Allah king or queen?
&gt; If not, then your Allah cannot use &quot;We&quot; UNLESS YOUR ALLAH IS NOT
&gt; SINGULAR  GOD, understand???&quot;  Please DO NOT FORGET that we are
&gt; debating whether Allah is one god or more, and if your Allah is one
&gt; god, then your Allah cannot use 'We' whenever your Allah speaks in the
&gt; Quran because, even then, your Allah is not king or queen based your
&gt; illogical sense of reasoning!
&gt; Moreover, I have explained clearly about monachy using 'we' as
&gt; follows:
&gt; &quot;We&quot; when used by one person speaking on behalf of a group is
&gt; acceptable but if by a Singular God, then it is unfathomable; and
&gt; when  &quot;we&quot; is used by a Monarch, it is taken to mean that the King is
&gt; speaking on behalf of the Royal Family, but if the King is not
&gt; married
&gt; and only himself alone in His kingdom, He will be most foolish to use
&gt; &quot;We&quot; when he speaks, right?

&gt; Wake up, Darion and pray to the True Allah who give WISDOM=Knowledge
&gt; of the truth of God with understanding !!!

&gt; Amen in Christ Jesus.- Hide quoted text -

Dear Darion,

Do you as a Muslim think it is lustful for a old man who claimed to be
a holy prophet to be eyeing at a 5 years baby girl for sex in marriage
at the age of 53?
Do you know that this was what your prophet, Mohammed, did: lusting to
have sex with a baby girl?

Please watch the following video link to know the dark secrets of
Mohammed:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZS_WakLDBes&amp;mode;=related&amp;search;=
Amen in Christ Jesus.

P S
Why are Muslims easily inveigled into becoming murderers- Islamic
TERRORISTS?
The reason is that Islam is a false religion having a false 'Holy
Book' - Quran WHICH-Mohammed said falsely- HAS THE COVENANT OF THE
PEOPLE OF THE BOOK (Israelites), but this covenant has not the LAW of
the True Allah (Elohiym) namely the 5 books of Moses of which clearly
gives one of the law of God: &quot; Thou shall not MURDER&quot;. The taking of
innocent lives is murder.
Muslims must know that when God give a COVENANT, They(Trinity) give a
COVENANT THAT COMES WITH THE LAW OF GOD, and the Quran mentions that
the Muslims were given the COVENANT of the people of the Book
(Israelites), but if Muslims were to read carefully, they will find
that there is no Law of the True Allah (Elohiym); and no where in the
Quran, was there the mentioning of the giving of the Law of God to
any
Muslim at all in respect of the so-called Islamic Covenant like the
giving of the Israelite Covenant to Moses, the Israelite.
God would not give a Covenant to the Muslims with a different set of
the Law of God; for God is wise and He would only give one and only
set of the Law of God for all people.
Hence, it explains why Muslims are killing Muslims, for example, the
sunni will kill even sunni when they become suicide-bombers, and
likewise the shites will kill the shites; all BECAUSE THE ISLAMIC
COVENANT IS FALSE, and hence, the Muslims have an EMPTY covenant
lacking the Law of the True Allah.
When questioned about EMPTY COVENANT, the Islamic religious teachers
will say that there are Haddiths, but make no mistake, Haddiths were
written by men, and THE HOLY BOOK IS WRITTEN BY GOD.
Finally, those Muslims who are wicked will become Islamic Terrorists,
and those Muslims who are not wicked will find the True Allah who
give
wisdom which is knowledge with understanding of the Truth of God
(Elohiym).
Amen.

Debunking:
So, Kewkahfatt, do you, Muslims, really think that it is alright for
your prophet, Mohammed, supposed to be holy especially in the aspect
of marriage to marry officially 11 wives and of one wife was a 40
years old woman named Khatijah who was old enough to be Mohammed's
mother at the time of marriage- Mohammed was only 25 years of age,
and
of another wife was a 9 years baby girl named Aisha at the time of
marriage- Mohammed was 57 years of age? And yet none of the ancient
prophets of God had 11 wives??? And yet the Quran has not even 1
Arabic prophet of God???
In the case of Aisha, Mohammed was eyeing her for sex in marriage
when
he, Mohammed, was 53 years old and Aisha was 5 years old little baby
girl; and then little Aisha at the age of 6 years old was betrothed
to
Mohammed at the age of 54 years old when sexual foreplays are allowed
according to Islamic law for marriage.
Marriage at the age of 9 between boy and girl of the same age is
acceptable according to other races of old custom, but NOT A GIRL OF
9
YEARS OLD WITH A OLD MAN OF 57 YEARS OF AGE !!! And when you,
Muslims,
accept such marriage, it not only shows how foolish you, Muslims, are
but also it reflects your foolishness when it comes to deciding what
is right and what is wrong !!!
Amen in Christ Jesus.

Dear Othman bin Ahmad,
How could Christians be blood thirsty when the Christians have the
Law
of God namely the 5 books of Moses of which one of the commandment
is:
' Thou shall not murder' ?
As I have been saying that all Muslims are foolish, and you as a
Muslim are being foolish again when you say that Hitler was a
Christian. Go and buy a biography on Hitler, and you will find out
that Hitler was a occultist following the Tibetan belief, and hence
it
explains the Nazi symbol of Buddhism on its Nazi flag!
Othman, whenever you speak without proof, you are lying like the
Islamic false prophet, Mohammed who claimed to be an Arab as well as
a
Hebrew being the descendant of Ismail. Hence, all Muslims are foolish
when they believe such claim of Mohammed being an Arab as well as a
Hebrew. How could Mohammed have 2 biography Fathers to enable him,
Mohammed, to be of 2 ethnic races???
Read the following for true understanding of the truth of the
falsehood of Islam:
Dear little hoopoe,
You wrote in reply to &quot;Allah is One(god)&quot; saying: &quot;....These words,
innaa (&quot;Verily We&quot;) and nahnu (&quot;We&quot;), and other forms of the plural,
may be used by one person speaking on behalf of a group, or they may
be used by one person for purposes of respect or glorification, as is
done by some monarchs when they issue statements or decrees in which
they say &quot;We have decided..&quot;
My reply:
&quot;We&quot; when used by one person speaking on behalf of a group is
acceptable but if by a Singular God, then it is unfathomable; and
when
&quot;we&quot; is used by a Monarch, it is taken to mean that the King is
speaking on behalf of the Royal Family, but if the King is not
married
and only Himself alone in His kingdom, He will be most foolish to use
&quot;We&quot; when he speaks, right?
And for the truth you may not know: what if Allah uses &quot;We(Nahnu)&quot;
when He is speaking on behalf of the Family of God - Elohiym; and &quot;
I(Ana) &quot; when He uses it to express Himself like He expressed his
name
to Moses as &quot; I AM THAT I AM&quot; as God, the Father Almighty; and
&quot;He(Huwa)&quot; when He uses it to refer to His Son, Jesus???
To say that in Arabic language using plurality to emphasize glory or
respect is literary style is unwise: for why adopt such literary
style when it is practical to use the right words to emphasize glory
or respect like &quot;I, your Allah or We, your God(Elohiym)...I, your
King
or We, the Royal Family, etc&quot; so as not to confuse other races who,
wisely, never use plurality to emphasize glory or respect !
And &quot;Innaa&quot; translated by you as &quot;verily, We&quot;. You know the meaning
of
verily which means in the very truth, and to put &quot;verily&quot; infront of
the word &quot;WE&quot; which you say could be &quot;I&quot; makes the word &quot;verily&quot; to
also mean not the very truth, right?
I could understand why the Arabic language uses such &quot;literary
style&quot;:
since Mohammed-a uneducated man, in the past, ruling by the sword, no
one dares to oppose his grammatical errors, and now he is acclaimed
by
Muslims as a prophet of Islam, which Muslim dares to point out his
errors WHEN MOHAMMED SAID &quot;We&quot; Is &quot;I&quot;, and &quot;I&quot; is &quot;We&quot;?
Even now, no Muslim dare to object to Mohammed-the uneducated man-
using Arabic language uneducatedly with grammatical mistakes except
the Christians, right? For Christians do what is right in the sight
of
God Almighty, BUT NOT THE MUSLIMS for Muslims fear the Islamists who
are ready to kill any Muslim who goes against the Quran even in good
faith that there are grammatical errors in the Quran such as using
the
PLURAL PRONOUN 'WE' wrongly!!
Now, speaking of the beauty of the Arabic language, may I ask you &quot;
Was Mohammed an Arab?&quot;
Amen in Christ Jesus.
--------------------------------
Dear Darion,
As I have been saying many times that all Muslims are foolish because
they seem to have the knowledge but they lack understanding like your
knowledge of 144,000 virgins mentioned in Revelation of the Holy
Book-
The Bible.
You lack understanding because either your English is not good enough
to understand that the 144,000 virgins are HOLY men of God who did
not
marry or have sex with women when they were living on earth or you
simply do not care enough to read well the Bible for true
understanding. Perhaps, it will do you spiritually good if you read
the Bible well enough to know the truth of the True Allah (Elohiym)
before you thread again otherwise you would be lying like Mohammed.
And in Heaven, there is no male or female but will live as the angels
of God(mentioned in Matthew 22:23-30) for all those saved by God; and
hence the 144,000 virgins are just to let all know that these virgins
were holy men of God who obeyed Jesus faithfully spreading the
message
of the True Allah unlike Mohammed who had officially more than 11
wives of one was old enough to be Mohammed's mother and of another
was
young enough to be Mohammed's great, grand daughter. Such is the
&quot;holiness&quot; of Mohammed which misguides Muslims to follow !
These virgins are not like the &quot;virgins&quot; mentioned in the Quran where
many Muslims were tempted enough to become &quot;martyrs&quot; so that they
could have sex, wine and comfortable riotious living in the Islamic
Heaven with these &quot;virgins&quot;.
Darion, these Islamic terrorists calling themselves ' Martyr ' will
find out as the truth reveals: Then in the Islamic Heaven, these
Islamic &quot;martyrs&quot; will find &quot;virgins&quot; without sex organ, wine barrel
which no hole opening for the wine to pour out, and out of the dark
pit hole comes ONE individual greeting them saying &quot; Salaam Walaikum,
I am Satan, your Allah!&quot;.
So, my question to the Muslims again: &quot; Muslims, have you verify the
sayings of Mohammed yet?&quot;
Amen in Christ Jesus.
