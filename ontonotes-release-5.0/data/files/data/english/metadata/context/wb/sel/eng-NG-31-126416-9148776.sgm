Hi All],

W3C in http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/selector.html#simple-selector ,
section 5.5 says that &quot;em { color: red }&quot; won't affect the color of
&quot;&lt;EM&gt;very&lt;/EM&gt;&quot; when it's embedded in an H! like:

&lt;H1&gt;This headline is &lt;EM&gt;very&lt;/EM&gt; important&lt;/H1&gt;

The W3C example uses &quot;red&quot; for both H1 and EM.  I put up an example at
with red for H1 and green for EM at http://home.comcast.net/~CaptQueeg/TypeSelectorsWithoutH1_EM.html .

The result was a green &quot;very&quot;, contrary to W3's assertion the the EM
text would not be affected by the EM specification.

To go one step further,  I added the recommend &quot;h1 em { color: blue }&quot;
using a third color instead of W3's choice, as shown in
http://home.comcast.net/~CaptQueeg/TypeSelectorsWithH1_EM.html

Now &quot;very&quot; is displayed in blue.  But the  &quot;h1&quot; in the  &quot;h1 em
{ color: blue }&quot;  construct.  If it is removed,  the &quot;very&quot; text will
be blue,  because the blue specification follows the green spec. and
hence overrides it.

Am I mixed on this?  Or is there a later version of thise W3C
document.

Thanks in Advance,
Richard

Nope, you're missing the point. It sais it WILL affect the color, but you
wouldn't notice it ('effect will be lost') due to the fact the H1 is also
red. It is an illustration WHY one could want a descendant selector.

Hi Steve and Rik,

Thank you both for your responses.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

You go that right :-)

It says it WILL affect the color, but you
wouldn't notice it ('effect will be lost') due to the fact the H1 is
also
red.

Well, that's a weird way to start an example,  because (1) no one
would ever code the thing that way and (2) the second &quot;red&quot; is
superfluous:  The H1 color is sufficient for both the H1 text proper
and the subordinate EM.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; It is an illustration WHY one could want a descendant selector.
">

I agree with your assessment of the illustration's intent.  However, I
think it's bogus because a simple EM with a different color will apply
that different color to the EM element.  So no descendant selector is
necessary.

Do my assertions make any sense?  I'd appreciate additional
assessments from you both.

Best wishes,
Richard

This is about the example in the CSS 2.1 draft that contains the markup
example

&lt;H1&gt;This headline is &lt;EM&gt;very&lt;/EM&gt; important&lt;/H1&gt;

which is a _bad_ example on practical grounds: there is hardly a point in
making an individual word emphasized in a top-level heading, which is highly
emphatic by its very nature and generally rendered in manner that
corresponds this.

Moreover, the CSS example is a bad example too:

h1 { color: red }
em { color: red }

and the discussion revolves around adding

h1 em { color: blue }

but does not even mention that it is _bad_ - and against W3C recommendations
(WCAG 1.0), too - to set color without setting background. It's also bad to
use bright colors like pure red and pure blue in texts that will presumably
be rendered in a very large font. And it's bad to use blue color for any
text that is not a link, except in special situations (and this is hardly
one on them).

People learn by example. Write a nice exact textual description, present an
example that contradicts it, and people will do as you did in your example.
In this case, the bad things in the example are not related to the issue
discussed in the text, but so what? People still learn by example.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Well, that's a weird way to start an example,  because (1) no one
&gt; would ever code the thing that way
">

I'm not sure what features of which code (HTML? CSS?) you are referring to,
but people surely write such code. They have learned it by example, usually
from sloppily written tutorials or other people's code.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; and (2) the second &quot;red&quot; is
&gt; superfluous:  The H1 color is sufficient for both the H1 text proper
&gt; and the subordinate EM.
">

No, it is not. Given an EM element inside an H1 element, the EM element
inherits the color of H1 _only if_ there is absolutely no rule in the style
sheets being applied (browser, user, and author style sheets) that sets the
color for the EM element.

There is no law against setting a particular color for EM elements in a
browser's default style sheet, for example. I've seen at least one browser
with such a default.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; It is an illustration WHY one could want a descendant selector.

&gt; I agree with your assessment of the illustration's intent.  However, I
&gt; think it's bogus because a simple EM with a different color will apply
&gt; that different color to the EM element.  So no descendant selector is
&gt; necessary.
">

Wrong. The bad example has a good point here. If you use a particular color
for highlighting say, H1 and EM elements, then you need a more specific
selector than just plain EM in order to make that particular EM element
highlighted with respect to the text around it (the rest of the H1 content
here) _using color_.

In this example, setting _all_ EM elements to blue was not the intent.

If course, a descendant selector is not the only way (a class selector could
be used, too, for example), but it's the simple and natural way in such a
case. _This_ point is good in the example in the CSS 2.1 draft. It's just
all the other ingredients of the example that are bad or very bad.

The example is also misleading in the sense that by common browser defaults,
EM elements appear in italics (or as slanted - CSS implementations don't
really distinguish between them). Thus, unless you do something special, in
most situations an EM element inside H1 _will_ differ from the rest of the
H1 contents, even if they appear in the same color.

Nonsense. Emphasis of one word in a sentence is used to tilt the
sentence by adjusting the relative weights of the ideas in it. This is
unrelated to the average weight of the whole sentence.

These three sentences all have different meanings, and either might be
used on its own as a heading:

&quot;Art does not _repeat_ the visible.&quot;
&quot;_Art_ does not repeat the visible.&quot;
&quot;Art does not repeat the _visible_.&quot;

(For the sake of completeness, the original sentence was &quot;Art does not
repeat the visible but makes visible&quot;.)

Hi Rik and Steve,

I submit that the following is more suitable for making the point that
W3C was trying to make: http://home.comcast.net/~CaptQueeg/TypeSelectorsExample.html .

Do you guys concur.  Or do you think the W3C example at Section 5.5 of

really does the job?

Firstly, there no authoritative definition of the kind of emphasis that EM
means. The spec says just &quot;emphasis&quot;. It's a natural assumption that it
means lesser emphasis than STRONG, which is defined as &quot;strong emphasis&quot;,
but even this is just reasoning, not part of the specification. Anyway, the
specification does not say that the emphasis is relative to something, still
less that it means emphasis of a word relative to the sentence where it
appears.

It is a relatively common assumption - and I used to adhere to it - that EM
is word emphasis (so that it needs to be noted only when reading sentences)
and that STRONG is overall emphasis that should stand out, or even jump out
of the text. The default rendering, italics and bold, is so common and taken
as so self-evident by many people that we're not very far from truth if we
say that in practice, EM and STRONG are little more than verbose synonyms
for I and B, used by structure nerds that pretend to express logical
relations rather than visual styling.

From the typographic point of view, that does not make much sense. In
typography, italics is the way to emphasize text - words or even sentences -
inside serif text, whereas bolding is used for the same purpose in
sans-serif text (largely because sans-serif italics tends to differ so
little from norman sans-serif).

There are many kinds of emphasis from the practical point of view. But how
many levels of emphasis can you really have? You can emphasize some words
because they are a heading, or because they constitute an important warning,
or something like, and you can use different methods for this. You can raise
your voice, you can speak slower, you raise your hand and look impressive,
or you can use italics, bold, color, blinking, large font size, borders
around, whatever. But can you really emphasize a word relative to its
sentence which is emphasized relative to its paragraph which is emphasized
relative to the document as a whole? Do people get the emphasis?

One of the key ideas is that headings are, or should be, very emphatic, so
it makes little sense to try to emphasize an individual word there. A
heading should be so short and to the point that each word carries strong
emphasis by being there.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;    &quot;Art does not repeat the _visible_.&quot;
">

They make poor headings. In copy text, you can play with emphasis that way.
In a heading, you had better express yourself differently. For example, for
the last case, you'd use &quot;It's not the visible that Art repeats&quot; or, maybe
better - since positive thinking is especially important in headings - &quot;Art
repeats the invisible&quot; (or &quot;It's the invisible that Art repeats&quot;. (I know
that it might have been the art that you meant and not a person called Art;
I like to intentionally misunderstand the misunderstandable, to make
points.)

Now returning to CSS, how would you present such emphasis inside a heading?
Using colors here would be artistic perhaps in some sense, but just awfully
naive in a better sense. Since headings are normally displayed in large and
often bold font, what would you do? Italics might work for serif fonts, but
headings should really appear in sans-serif fonts, right? Making the heading
not bold and bolding the emphasized word might work just almost tolerably.

Hi Jukka and John,

Thanks for responding.  However, the appropriateness of EMs inside
Hx's -- while perhaps an important issue -- is not relevant to my
question.

Section 5.5 of http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/selector.html#simple-selector
could be any well known tags for the  page's purpose of illustrating
descendant type selectors.

I posted the question of whether that section seem weird to anybody
besides me.  After getting a couple of responses that disagreed my
take on the issue,  I thought more about and proposed an alternative
which I believe better exemplifies the issue.

Please compare W3C's example and the above address with my example at
http://home.comcast.net/~CaptQueeg/TypeSelectorsExample.html and
advise which page better addresses the issue of descendant type
selectors.

Thanks in Advance,
Richard

If they can be any well known tags, then an example should show good example
by using tags in a meaningful way (and styling reasonably, not naively and
disruptively).

On the other hand, the document purports to be a draft _specification_, not
a tutorial. It really needs improvement, but it's the normative parts that

You have the same basic mistakes there. I find it strange that you decided
to learn nothing from my explanation.

Moreover, it's more complex and confusing than the CSS 2.1 draft example,
which is very poor but somehow understandable in the basic point it tries to
make. I really can't see what you are trying to exemplify.

The basic idea of descendant selectors is fairly easy, and unnecessarily
complex examples just make it more difficult to understand. There's no need
to present special cases right after introducing a concept. This first
example should be something very simple like the following:

ul ul { font-size: 90%; }

Not a particularly good example, but not that bad either. Actually,
descendant selectors are seldom of the simple type consisting of two element
names; usually there's something more involved, like a class selector.

Hi Jukka,

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Then why did you quote John's entire message, down to the sig? Hint:
&gt; fullquoting strongly reduces your credibility on Usenet.
">

I'm using Google Groups as my server.  Whenever I reply to a message,
it generates a &quot;quote&quot; of the antecedent message (with leading &gt;) and
positions my cursor beneath it.  When I enter my content post it,  the
new message in my viewer contains only a link to the quoted text.  So
it's no bother at all, as I see it.  Apparently, your view acts
differently.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; And a fake name
">

I formerly used &quot;Richard&quot; as a User-name on this newsgroup.  Someone
else complained that there was already a Richard on this newsgroup, so
that I should desist from using it.  So I decided to fashion an
appellation not likely to be used by anyone.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

My email address isn't a forgery.  It's a dummy account in the sense
that I hardly ever look at its in-box.  The name is chosen to
frustrate spammers, and it appears to be successful in that respect.
And I see no need for private message from this other groups I
frequent.  Publicly posted messages are the way to go,  IMHO.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; You have the same basic mistakes there. I find it strange that you decided

The only mistakes I'm aware of is John's observation about CSS's vaild

you're referring to the use of Hx's in this example.  I responded
before that the particular tags chosen for illustrating descendant
styles is insignificant.  It appears we'll just have to agree to
disagree.

So I think I'm going to join John in signing off and downing a brew.

&gt; &gt;&gt; which is a _bad_ example on practical grounds: there is hardly a
&gt; &gt;&gt; point in making an individual word emphasized in a top-level
&gt; &gt;&gt; heading, which is highly emphatic by its very nature and generally
&gt; &gt;&gt; rendered in manner that corresponds this.

&gt; &gt; Nonsense. Emphasis of one word in a sentence is used to tilt the
&gt; &gt; sentence by adjusting the relative weights of the ideas in it. This is
&gt; &gt; unrelated to the average weight of the whole sentence.
">

Two things going on here. First, JK is right that the above is
not the best example, that bit is not to be disputed too much
surely? The fact that it is a top level heading speaks for its
importance, the very word &quot;very&quot; is the icing on the cake, any
further emphasis would be too sickly.

Second, there is the general claim that it does not make a lot of
sense to emphasise a word in a heading. On this, I doubt JK is
right. I read his arguments but they look an uphill battle;
meaning that he is inclined to change them about so that the
meaning of the whole obviates the need for the &quot;same heading
different word emphasised each time&quot; approach. This then looks
like he is doing this merely to support his policy that it is not
a good idea to emphasise just one word in a heading. We are still
needing a clear argument as to why not in principle.

If someone is analysing a dictum in an essay, and it is the sort
of dictum that can be interpreted according to how the words are
emphasised (as in Ben C's example), why bother not to simply
emphasise the bit that is relevant to the interpretation that
might then be discussed in the paragraphs immediately ensuing? It
is a simpler plan than having to scratch one's head on rewriting
the headings.

Always be careful of dictionaries for support for the type of

you what should be used when there is a choice. A dorayme can.
And has. &quot;First&quot; is shorter. So you need a good reason for using
&quot;Firstly&quot; instead.

Actually, I mislead about my authority on this: I am just

Well, whoever said this (you do not show who in your post, you

and fair or deserving. But then, as William Munny said to the

(2) Can you please change your name again. I am a little
sensitive to the name &quot;Richard&quot; at the moment. But that is just
something personal. There will be others who remember someone
they used to call, rather unkindly, &quot;Richard the Stupid&quot; years

That's a fairly confusing statement. So maybe _I_ am allowed to present _my_
argument and other people can present theirs. My point was that a heading is
emphatic as such, and it should be short, each word*) carrying a weight, so
any emphasis on individual words would be odd.

The presentational (and thus CSS-related) side of the matter is that there
is seldom any good way to emphasize an individual word in a heading in
visual rendering. (I bet nobody gave any thought to aural rendering here.
You should, as a mental exercise.)

*) Except perhaps short particles. Cf. to the style of capitalizing all
words except a small set of short words in English. It's not just
decorative; it reflects the idea that (almost) each word is emphatic in a
heading.

Did such a situation occur to you in practical authoring, or did you just
make it up? Can you cite a real example of an existing page where a word is
emphasized in a heading and this serves a useful purpose? Then we could
discuss the styling issue.

In your hypothetical case, the different presentations of the dictum with
one of the words emphasized (with italics) would best serve as texts right
under the heading - maybe in large font size, but smaller than heading size
and not logically a heading. The headings should summarize the
interpretations or at least name them. This is comparable to an essay on
translating a sentence in different ways, with different interpretations;
you should not make the translations themselves headings. A heading should,
if possible, _answer_ a question rather than just pose it.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Don't you agree that the word emphasis
&gt; (albeit less precisely defined in the spec than, say, the word

&gt; /compared to something else/.
">

The HTML specifications - which are obscure, probably intentionally obscure
in part, in issues like EM and STRONG semantics - use just the vague word
&quot;emphasis&quot;, and the main reason for assuming implicit relativeness is that
those elements are _text level_ elements only. Yet, emphasis as such does
not imply relativeness to its context. I can yell &quot;stop&quot; non-emphatically or
emphatically; there is a whole range of degrees of emphasis I can use. And
nothing prevents me from writing

&lt;div&gt;&lt;em&gt;Welcome!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

on a web page. Yet people don't do that when they want to say &quot;Welcome!&quot;
emphatically. They turn it into a heading (bad), or use &lt;font&gt; tags to
change font size and perhaps face (bad, but not as bad a misusing heading
markup), or create an image containing the &quot;Welcome!&quot; in some fancy font and
with fancy coloring. And it's not emphasis relative to something on the page

&gt; visually relates well to the marginal bit of emphasis you'd allow
&gt; part of a heading to have. Semantically strict in the code and
&gt; subliminally effective to the reader.
">

No, it does not work that way. It's subliminally effective just in making
the user inexplicably (to himself) irritated at some variation in
presentation, too unnoticeable to convey a message, yet noticeable enough to
disturb reading and cause mental processes that lead nowhere.

It's comparable to changing font size by, say, 6%. The typographic
principles say that when you have text in different font sizes in the same
context, the difference should be at least 10% (assuming the font face is
the same) - otherwise the difference may easily look like a mistake (e.g.,
the result of combining texts from different sources, each slightly
different font sizes, mistakenly not unified in style, with no intent of
_saying_ anything with the font size change).

A compromise: a combination of two conflicting proposals that combines their
drawbacks and nullifies their benefits.

Thanks for the comforting thought.

I think the Biblical expression is &quot;eye of THE Needle,&quot; which referred
to some gate around a walled city.  Oh,  and I think it was a &quot;heavily
laden camel&quot;. :-)

I don't really get frustrated,  partly because I've invariably had
good responses to the many posts I've made to the few dozen NGs I've
visited over quite a few years.  The only instances I can recall is
(1) Jukka going on ad nauseum over stuff that had nothing to do with
question; (2) Some guy last month who was on my case about bottom
posting or top posting; and (3) Some other guy who ranted about Google
Groups users on Usenet groups.  C'est la vie.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; (2) Can you please change your name again.
">

I forgot.  That's another complaint I got (on this NG I think.)  The
guy said there was already a member named Richard, so he instructed me
to change my name.  Well,  that inspired me to set my user-name on all
sites I visit to RichardOnRails.

As to the &quot;on Rails&quot; part,  are you aware that there's a programming
language named Ruby that's getting increasingly popular. It's become
my favorite.  Another guy,  while developing a web application in
Ruby,  abstracted various parts of it into a web development frame
which he called Ruby On Rail, which I also like a lot.  And I belong
to local interest group called B'more On Rails.  So RichardOnRails
merges my real identity, &quot;Richard,&quot; with one of my primary interests,
&quot;Rails.&quot;

So instead of continuing the mental association of Richard with
Richard, the Stupid,  consider associating it with Richard, The Lion-
heart; Richard Rogers (the great composer);  Richard Branson (Virgin
Air, etc.);  Richard Avedon (the photographer); and last and
unfortunately least, RichardOnRails.

What do you think?

Best wishes,
Richard (not stupid, I hope)

Heh. *I* consider Jukka'a understanding of (this or any other aspect of)
CSS superior to mine, and so I suppose he's probably a superior judge of
others' understanding. (Although it might be said here that he doesn't
always exhibit a superior understanding of others' feelings. I'm just
glad he's not actually a Superior Court judge. ;-) )

I don't always agree with Jukka, but I find his breadth and depth of
technical knowledge in matters Web impressive, and I usually learn
something. At least he makes me think.

I once had a friend who quite captivated me. Not only was she female and
attractive (you see this has nothing to do with Mr. Korpela), but she
actually listened to what I said when I was talking or flirting with
her, then she'd ask what I meant, exactly. She made me more careful
about what I said, and that helped train my thinking process.

Posting in NGs does that too, especially knowing that someone like Jukka
is lurking in the shadows waitng to ask, &quot;what did you mean? Why did you
say that?&quot;

(And for some languages, emphasis might be expressed by using smaller [!]
font size.)

That is correct. I limited the scope to the Latin script, since _even there_
the idea of using italics and bolding as &quot;emphasis&quot; and &quot;strong emphasis&quot; is
questionable and surely not universally applicable.

Things get worse if we consider other scripts as well. If we use &lt;em&gt; markup
for, say, Hebrew text, browsers may slant Hebrew letters (to the right!).
It's not right of course, but what else could they do? The point is that
people who designed HTML didn't really think in terms of emphasis and strong
emphasis, or at least they didn't consider their implementation for scripts
other than Latin, Greek, and Cyrillic.

The bottom line really is that EM and STRONG are little more than verbose
synonyms for I and B. You can use them, and I tend to use them, due to their
being somewhat more logical, but they are really presentational markup in
disguise and we should not expect browsers to get them right for most
scripts.

You could use &lt;em&gt; for, say, Arabic if you use CSS to set font-style: normal
(to prevent the slanting) and figure out some way to emphasize the text,
e.g. using color or font size. But using &lt;span class=&quot;em&quot;&gt; you could achieve
just the same _except_ that when CSS is off, the emphasized text will appear
as normal, not slanted.

">

It's normally expressed indirectly in typography books by explaining how
italics was designed for serif fonts, how italics is the main method for
emphasis in copy text (where classic typography tends to use serif fonts),
how italics can be rather unnoticeable for sans-serif fonts (which may even
lack genuine italics) and how bolding is a way to make sans-serif more
prominent, and sans-serif fonts often have several different-weight versions
to compensate for the problems of using italics.

What's the connection between having several different-weight versions,
instead of just regular and bold, and the problems associated with
italics? Italics don't have different degrees of slanting, so you must
have something else in mind.

Thanks for your assessment.  But in truth,  I'm no thin-skinned.  I
retired a month after 9/11 because my recently renewed contract was
canceled in the wake of  government re-budgeting.  I had last 30+
years as an independent computer consultant.  Sadly, I'd had no web

Perhaps.  But I've had a lot of experience in teaching computer
technology as a adjunct at two universities over a decade or so,  not
to mention commercial seminars from DC to Hawaii.  In that capacity,
I've concluded that the most important attribute of one who presumes
to teach is *not* subject matter expertise.  It is genuine empathy
with the student so as to understand exactly what the student's
missing and the discipline to confine the response to that issue,
especially from several different angles, without obfuscation by
mentioning a host of tangential technical issues.

I responded several of Jakka's hoping to persuade him to address the
posted question directly, and to hint that ad hominem assertions were,
er, questionable.  I failed.  And I give up:  I won't respond any
further

Hope this wasn't too long-winded.

&gt; &gt; Second, there is the general claim that it does not make a lot of
&gt; &gt; sense to emphasise a word in a heading. On this, I doubt JK is
&gt; &gt; right. I read his arguments but they look an uphill battle;
&gt; &gt; meaning that he is inclined to change them about so that the
&gt; &gt; meaning of the whole obviates the need for the &quot;same heading
&gt; &gt; different word emphasised each time&quot; approach.

&gt; That's a fairly confusing statement.
">

And, to think, there was I thinking it was merely compact. &lt;g&gt;

Yeah ok... fair enough, the reader would have to work too hard at
it. I just meant that you have decided in advance that there can
be no good reason to emphasise a word in a heading and that when
you are presented with examples, you are inclined to think up
ways to avoid such emphasis.

If it was bad in principle to so emphasise, your approach would
be essential for good practice. But what are the arguments in
advance of the cases? That a heading is already emphatic? So? A
little more sensitive emphasis will not spoil this. There is no
contradiction, no real inconsistency.

What could be another argument? Is this one I make up, or yours:

Emphasis can be a shorthand way of conveying meaning.
CSS is for styling only.
Therefore it is poor practice to use styling to convey meaning.

The fault here would be the second statement. The distinction
between styling and meaning is just not that divided as to bear
such weight. Making a webpage is a joint exercise between an
intelligent being and his tools, all working together, there is
some division of labour, but it is not unionised, the css will
not go on strike if it is asked to lend a hand in a bit of
meaning work.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; The presentational (and thus CSS-related) side of the matter is that there
&gt; is seldom any good way to emphasize an individual word in a heading in
&gt; visual rendering. (I bet nobody gave any thought to aural rendering here.
&gt; You should, as a mental exercise.)

I did! I cannot see why aural emphasis is any less important in
the aural expression of a heading than in a written one. In fact
just as important if not more.

&gt; &gt; If someone is analysing a dictum in an essay, and it is the sort
&gt; &gt; of dictum that can be interpreted according to how the words are
&gt; &gt; emphasised (as in Ben C's example), why bother not to simply
&gt; &gt; emphasise the bit that is relevant to the interpretation that
&gt; &gt; might then be discussed in the paragraphs immediately ensuing?

&gt; Did such a situation occur to you in practical authoring, or did you just
&gt; make it up?

I made it up. (But I will look over my work to see). Is it bad to
imagine cases? Have I fallen into some sort of trap? You are
closing off a possibility and I am wondering quite why.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Can you cite a real example of an existing page where a word is

Watch this space. You want actual. OK, I will look and if I can
remember the name of this thread, I will get back. Please send me

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; In your hypothetical case, the different presentations of the dictum with
&gt; one of the words emphasized (with italics) would best serve as texts right
&gt; under the heading - maybe in large font size, but smaller than heading size
&gt; and not logically a heading. The headings should summarize the
&gt; interpretations or at least name them. This is comparable to an essay on
&gt; translating a sentence in different ways, with different interpretations;
&gt; you should not make the translations themselves headings. A heading should,
&gt; if possible, _answer_ a question rather than just pose it.

This is interesting. But I do not believe it. Why should a
heading do this? What do you mean, &quot;if possible&quot;? With you as
author, it would always be possible because you would come up
with a plan to follow your view on the matter. The qualification
leaves the barn door swinging wide open.

An essay may well have headings that are questions, it being
understood that the particular question is being discussed in the
ensuing paragraphs. The headings do not _need_ to be answers of
any kind. My memory tells me I had some that were not so bad in
an essay... where is that thing?  Ah yes:

Very true.  I am not one of his defenders (he already has more than he

seem confined to the &quot;doctrine&quot; of CSS or HTML, but suggestive of a more
personal failing on the part of the offender.  His responses frequently
demand &quot;why?&quot;, with no suggestion of seeking a better understanding. It
is most interesting that a  human communication expert, can get so
caught up in the syntax of the communication, and lose sight of the
purpose (communication).  As a writer my purpose is to convey a thought,
to achieve that I try to write well.  Writing well it the method, not
the objective, and when that method fails I will try what ever works.

I am reminded of what they say about Washington D.C. &quot;If you want a
friend, get a dog.&quot;

I read his posts expecting a thorough parsing of the rules, and take
them for their technical value.  As for any conclusions that parsing may
yield, I draw my own.

In my opinion, not that that is worth a tinker's damn, standards are
great, but they are not the beginning and end of all knowledge.  I
remember a time when there were at least three &quot;standards&quot; for DS1 (two
in the US. and at least one elsewhere), and there were none for anything
above DS3.  That didn't limit developers from developing SONET.  If
everyone were as devoted to the &quot;standards&quot;, we probably would not see
posts bemoaning &quot;yet another browser to test for&quot;, but would we see
things evolving as rapidly as they are?

On the subject of war, it is almost too unbearable to hear the
anxieties of western nations over Afghanistan opium agriculture.
This agriculture feeds the Taliban and other terrorists groups
with huge amounts of money. It hardly occurs to any of the
western administrations that it is their very policy of
prohibition that has made this policy. They might just about get
the idea that with no prohibition, the trade would simply
collapse as an absurdly attractive money spinner. But I am now
confident that nothing will ever get nations to see that repeal
of the prohibition laws would bring, in the long run, great
*other* benefits to their countries.

&gt;&gt; Great essay.  Would that I could articulate the anti-War_on_Drugs
&gt;&gt; position so well.  By strange coincidence,  the folly of our drug
&gt;&gt; policy came mind this morning when I read the Washington Post's report
&gt;&gt; on Bush trying to hook his war policy on the back of the Johnson-Nixon
&gt;&gt; debacle.  Thanks for publishing it.

&gt; On the subject of war, it is almost too unbearable to hear the
&gt; anxieties of western nations over Afghanistan opium agriculture.
&gt; This agriculture feeds the Taliban and other terrorists groups
&gt; with huge amounts of money.
">

Excuse me? Being religious fanatics (including their believes about
substance abuse) the opium market was in total disarray when the Taliban
came to power: the production of drugs was halted quite thoroughly (and
Afghanistan was indeed one of the major producers). Only when some
geniuses descided they shouldn't be in power and bombed the hell out of
the country overthrowing them, the production recovered quickly.

Indeed, and that applies equally to drug runners across our
southwestern border, as well as the on-going wars on our inner-city
streets.

Nothing changes because we,  the citizenry, think that voting is
enough to determine the direction of our government ... and as many as
half of us can't be bothered to do that.  But I'm happy to report that
my telephone number is duly noted at 202-456-1111 (the W.H.)  I still
remember fondly the '70s when Archibald Cox was fired and that phone
rang off the hook.

C'ya,
Richard

You are right about something here. The Taliban were more
efficient at *repressing* the agriculture. That is really quite
the easy part in the short term. The yanks cannot be as ruthless
(eg. they could simply spray and bomb the shit out of the
growers) because it would drive the farmers into terrorist and
Taliban hands even further and so strengthen the latter in
manpower ways, not just financial.

I cannot help feeling that the Yanks were right to overthrow that
murderous lot (who openly harboured and refused to hand over
quickly enough their arab terrorist guests). One big Yank mistake
was to stick around afterwards. After 9/11, there was no more
appropriate target.

Anyway, the disaster of the drug trade is mostly due to the
especially American policy of prohibition.
