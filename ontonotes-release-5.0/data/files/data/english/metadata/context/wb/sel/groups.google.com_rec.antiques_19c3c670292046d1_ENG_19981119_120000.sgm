Just some sketchy, thoughts.

Is the world of antiques changing and if so, how?
As you will learn reading your price guide blurbs,
Tiffany, for example was not collected with much
enthusiasm until the late 1960's. Will it fall
out of fashion one day? It seems like a lead pipe
cinch, (which is one of the great phrases) that
the answer is yes. When, might be the next question
but before we hurry there, we might want
to consider for a moment some of the implications
and ramifications. Just for grins.
You see on occaision the buyer who says something
like, &quot;I am buying these (anvils, beanies, Coalport,
condom dispensing machines) for my kid,&quot; as if it
were an investment or, at least, speculation. In this
case, as opposed to a reader who wrote in to ask the
value of an item he had (already) bought at an auction,
and who upon learning that he had been had,
retreated from his origianl position,
the one he had written in about in the first
place, by saying he had just bought it because he LIKED it.
Well, in the example we are considering in this paragraph
that is gettting to be pretty lenghty for Usenet, this
may be the case, or not. But the STATED purpose of the
purchase is profit in the long term. And if the truth
were told, I would guess that most &quot;antiques&quot; are bought
with an eye toward future returns of some kind.
That being so- more or less ;) - I wonder...
Well, I wonder a lot of things. What about collectors
for example, who have in the past decade or two found
that thier milk glass or Avon or younameit collection has
suddenly become worth significantly less......
At this point sketchy does not even come close, fragmented
would be closer, so this is good place to close.

As always,
T.

"/> Interesting thoughts Trance, it seems that anytime the general public gets
involved in the antiques and collecting game it is because of potential
profit down the road ( remember the sports card fad a few years ago) what
ever is hot the masses grab for until the next hot item appears. Everything
rises in price until it hit a high point only the wealthy can afford and
the the teeming masses search for other prey they can afford ( cabbage
patch dolls, tickle me elmo. beanie babies, ready made collectibles, need I
go on) The joyous few , the true collector's , care not for the value only
the joy of the hunt, the adrenaline surge I'm sure most of us here still
feel when bidding on the objects of our desire. Antiques will go on for
ever, fads will come and go, l think the trick with fads is to get in on it
first and use your excess profits to buy what you love. Man , l love this
business!

This is probably the true &quot;great divide&quot; between antiques and collectibles
[of whatever age]. Craftsmanship and artistic merit will prevail and
ultimately have &quot;legs&quot; versus fads and nostalgia. Collector demand does ebb
and flow as manufactured-trends switch directions. People can sometimes
truly be sheep.

Tiffany, to use Trance's example, may diminish in popularity to a degree,
but it's quality, style, workmanship, etc. will survive and, IMHO, continue
not only to be collected, but remain a paradigm of art.

Wish I could think of another example than period milk glass
as an antique that has gone out of style and has had its
value plummet. Seems like there was some talk here once on
the subject of antiques that had gone out of style.
All this to say, that the issue is likely a bit broader
than just antiques vs. collectables.

I know next to nothing about mercury glass, but humbly submit that fruit
sealers, much like glass insulators, are truly collectibles, not antiques.
The only gauge to classify them as antiques is age. Tiffany glass =
antique. Mason jar = collectible [100 years old or not].

Trance does have a point, though. There must be examples of true antiques
which fall from grace. I still believe, however, that collectibles, not
antiques, make up the vast preponderance of cyclical fads.

&gt; Is the world of antiques changing and if so, how?

"/> Reproductions seem to affect the antique market. For several years in our
area depression glass suddenly became hard to sell after they started
reproducing it &amp; now we are seeing the same thing happen to Roseville.

As noted in former messages, just about everyone thinks of themselves as a
dealer nowadays, but they think they can be one without any prior (or
future) knowledge of antiques. So whenever repros hit the market, they back
away from that item entirely. I'm always amazed by the amount of collectors
who do the same thing, because they can't recognize the real thing.

After a time, an item that has been very hot on the market, will suddenly
drop off because the market gets so flooded. Something that used to be
rarely seen, becomes very common after everyone digs it out of their
basement, shed or attic.

Let us not forget, too, the changing of our lifestyles. Few people live in
a house that has been in the family for generations with all belongings
passed down. Our houses are smaller &amp; those huge Victorian pieces of
furniture no longer will fit. Decorating &amp; color scheme tastes have
changed. We want light, bright furniture such as Oak, not dark, somber
woods.

In general, I think there are fewer collectors. At least, not people having
large collections. Space is limited for one thing &amp; we feel the need to get
as much clutter out of our lives as possible, the world is hectic enough.
Economics play a major role in our fast paced lives. No longer are we
content to drive the same car year after year, but feel the need to get a
new one every couple of years &amp; whatever the newest electronic gadget is,
why we just have to rush right out &amp; buy it. The kids won't wear
hand-me-downs, but need designer clothes &amp; shoes. Pay $600 for an 1800's
vase that will just sit around collecting dust? No thanks, I'll take a new
stereo instead. (Remember that I am speaking of general attitudes). We
work longer hours &amp; extra jobs &amp; are making more money than we ever dreamed
possible when we were young. So how come the pay check is gone as soon as
we get it &amp; we're still in debt? Most people no longer have the resources
for antiques &amp; collectibles that just sit there doing nothing.

Gee, T, you shouldn't have gotten me started, could go on &amp; on, but will
promise to stop now (much to everyone's relief).

"/> My sentiments entirely. The only people who can/should afford to follow
fads are dealers who turn their stock over quickly. Well, i suppose
lucky sellers who jump, on the band-wagon and offload some old junk
would be happy too... There are two basic rules in buying for
fun/collecting:

1) Only buy it if you like it.
2) See rule 1

People who, say, buy beanie babies by the truckload because they think
they'll be worth even more in 20 year's time, are doomed to bitter and
expensive disappointment. &quot;Real&quot; antiques will always be a hedge against
inflation, and sometime might actually make some profit.

point of &quot;investments&quot; in antiques. As an example, we discussed a late 18th

from a High Street shop in London. He paid the round figure of 1000 pounds for
it. We both reckoned that the 1000 pounds at this time represented (in the UK)
about half a years wages for the professional man (ie middle-management). We
both agreed, the same stool today in a Christie's sale would have an approx
estimate 6000-8000 pounds and in a High Street shop a value around 10k, At the
end of the evening we both agreed there was no &quot;real&quot; investment in the
original purchase, considering it still represented around half the average
professional wage, and in fact, in some UK regions today, much less than half
the professional wage.

Excellent point. I've always believed that the only true way to value any
art or antique is in relation to a fixed financial reference, such as a wage
index - to Ronnie's point.

At best, art and antiques have proven to be a hedge against inflation. Few,
if any, collectibles [baseball cards, stamps, insulators, Avon, Franklin
Mint, whatever] have done about as well against inflation as a 1983 Dodge
Omni, let alone provide investment growth. Both art &amp; antiques and
collectibles spike in price as trends and taste fluctuate. However, a&amp;a
return to that modest growth curve while collectibles do not.

"/> Rich, from the mid 80s until the early 1990s I was buying *certain* mid
Victorian furniture, mainly ... 4door breakfront sideboards, 2door Chiffs and
Duchess bedroom furniture. As example, in the mid 80's, a 4door breakfront
sideboard (in my region) was bought-in for around £350 though the 80s until
around 1990 the buying in price had risen to around 1500-2000 pounds for the
same type of item. When the ass fell out of the Victorian market and the
shippers stopped buying I couldn't give these things away. I could quote you
many other items regarded as &quot;antique&quot; bought and shipped, some less than 5
years ago, that are no longer in demand ...... or in favour.

"/> Ain't it the truth! I'd honestly never seen one of these things until they did
a local news story about a crowd gathering for one of these damn things at a
store. After that I have now been able to decipher alot of the messages I'd
read in reference to these beany baby things. One that had me scared for weeks
was about a group of these people getting together for a halloween party with
their little friends in tow, all dressed up no less! When I first read this I
had no idea what they were referring to, thought it was a joke, now of course
realizing their subject matter was stuffed animal things I can only wonder what
will become of their children who look hopelessly on as mom and her friends act
like complete idiots. I'm telling ya, it is really scary! Oh yeah, the same
thing goes for those so-called collectors who collect McDonald toys, just once
I'd like to get a happy meal for my daughter that actually has the advertised
toy inside, not one of their not-so-popular older toys being sloughed off!
That ticks me off, try explaining that to a 5 year old who says I've already
got that one, where is the one they show on TV?

You are both right, of course. If I really wanted to invest I'd buy real
estate. I justify my collecting by thinking that, even if there isn't a
*real* gain in value for my &quot;investment,&quot; at least when I die my kids
can sell the things if they don't want to keep them, whereas if I'd spent
the money on new drapes, clothes, electronic toys, they'd have no money
at all from my estate. And I wouldn't have had the fun of buying,
dusting, preserving that little bit of history.

(England, Wales and Scotland) another sure fire &quot;investment&quot; that turned into
the big 80's lie. We in N.I are still *unfortunately* living the real estate
dream ..... pity the poor suckers when the cash comes.

I don't buy antiques as investments, and by God in the 1990s I sure don't
market them as investments, that's the other big lie of the 1980s.

I hope my boy Nathan, (when both I and Alison pass on), will keep the bits and
pieces we have put together, not for the hope of an investment, or the sheer
thrill of the monetary worth, but for the objects, their history, the memories
and what we hopefully have taught him about material objects. Should he decide
to sell them ....... good luck! to the wee fellow .... I'm certain he'll take
a quick turn :-)

YES, Mike Wilcox, mercury glass is a good one!
And bristol glass.
Thank you. I knew I wasn't just making this stuff up.
T.

l have been racking the little gray cells this Am. to come up with Antiques
out of favour,one that comes to mind is fruit sealers ( Mason's ,Beaver,
Ball...etc ) there seems to be must less interest in them than in times past
and the prices have dropped somewhat. Mercury glass glass seems to be another
item that seems to have fallen off the face of the earth,at least in my area
( Ontario, Canada ). Some thing's seem to go in cycles, big pine pieces ( out
) small tables (in) but it all seems to stem from the big name magazines, an
article in Antiques or some movie star collecting a certain item starts the
value moving skyward. Quality items seem to maintain most of their value,
ready made collectibles end up in next years yard sales with the &quot; Ab
Blisters&quot; ( Grin ). Man, l love this business!

&gt;How about pattern glass? I think my Mother's generation collected it

"/> I think you are probably right, but there is one area (at least) that
muddles both collectible and antique arguments, and that is
automobiles.

Cars have been around for slightly more than 100 years, so there are
truly antique vehicles. But it would be hard to think that a 1935
Auburn roadster, say, is not an antique as well. Its swoop of line
also makes it a fine example of the designer's flourish and gives it
the intrinsic value of art (not to mention that you can always trot it
out for a parade - or drive it to the dry cleaners).

At the same time, it is certainly a collectible -- and collector cars
are subject to the cyclical fad you both have mentioned. I did see a
Packard with a $650,000 sticker at the Hershey, Pa., flea market last
month, but that was an exception. Prices have fallen drastically over
the past five to ten years, and even icons of American iron such as
the hugely finned '59 Cadillac Eldorado, which brought upwards of
$125,000 not so long ago, can now be had for a piddling 60 grand or
so.

In this case, though, there is more to long-term value (and falling
prices) than craftsmanship or artistic merit. With cars, no matter
how lovely, one of the problems is the aging of the population. A
prime factor in the love of old automobiles is the remembrance of what
your grandfather or your father drove. And as people who remember the
20's and 30's die off, sadly, there may not be many to take their
place as buyers and conservators.

Without question, the classics will survive. But big prices across
the board, as well as the flow of collecting (IMHO) will definitely
ebb. There will indeed be rare things to fire the spirit, things like
Vipers and Vettes. But I can't see future generations reaching back
to snatch a Ford Taurus or a Chevy Malibu from the junk-yard crusher.

The times -- as Trance, and I think somebody else, said -- they are a
changin'.

"/> That's not just limited to automobiles. I believe that most of the
antiques and collectibles markets are strongly influenced by elements
of nostalgia and childhood imprinting.

One of our local antiques shop proprietors explained that the local
market did not value cut glass as highly as more urban markets not very
far away, because this was a rural country area in the heyday of the
brillant cut glass makers. People didn't grow up exposed to the glitter
as evidence of sophistication and elegance, and hence the present day
market lacks collectors to buy.

No, &quot;maintenance&quot; is hardly a factor when you are talking restorations
and collector cars. With a perfect old original or a pristine
restoration, you don't have the problems you'd have with a
daily-driver, because the cars are coddled from the git-go. But cost
is certainly a thing to consider when you get into the hobby. And, as
they say, the best way to make a small fortune in restorations is to
start with a big one.

&gt; same type of item. When the ass fell out of the Victorian market and the
&gt; shippers stopped buying I couldn't give these things away. I could quote you

Sold at Sotheby's 1968 for £2,600.00

Today would sell to-day perhaps for £45,000.00

years ago, but I would say across the board, middle market no real investment.

Not so sure the harpsichord is a real investment ... 2600 in 1967 was a heck
of a lot of money, I reckon a years wages say a bank manager (??) (or the
like) 45000 today still sounds like a bank manager's wage (or the like)

The Tiffany is of course a different ball game, if it's an 80k lamp today
.... is it?

Anyway good game ..... do you have any other examples? wouldn't mind you
posting them just for fun. I have some old &quot;Antique Collector&quot; mags from the
late 60's, somewhere, if I find these I'll have a look see.

One thing that may have been good in the long term are Longcased clocks
(Grandfathers) in the early 70's over here something like 80-100 pounds would
have bought most if not any longcased, today the biggest boat of a clock will
make around 2k., however, that may only be a regional difference.

T,

I'm a collector myself and I just collect stuff for the fun of it I
really don't
think of money at all except for the initial purchase of the object I
want to buy
and I have a knack at getting things fairly cheaply so I am a pretty
shrewd collector.
When I look at a piece of furniture I try to imagine the pieces history
and what
glimmers of the past it might encompass. I have always been a history
buff so slipping
into the collection of antiques was a natural step for me.

If I ever turned into a dealer I think my toughest problem would be
having to
sell furniture I really want for myself. If I ever sell anything in the
near
future it will be to improve my collection and get something better or
older.
My favorite period is rococo but its a very expensive period to collect
in so
most of my collection of furniture and porcelain varies from the 1800's
to the
1920's.

I personally love the craftsmanship in the old furniture &amp; porcelain,
etc. and the history behind it and this is why I collect.

&gt; case, as opposed to a reader who wrote in to ask the
&gt; value of an item he had (already) bought at an auction,
&gt; and who upon learning that he had been had,
&gt; retreated from his origianl position,
&gt; the one he had written in about in the first
&gt; place, by saying he had just bought it because he LIKED it.
&gt; Well, in the example we are considering in this paragraph
&gt; that is gettting to be pretty lenghty for Usenet, this
&gt; may be the case, or not. But the STATED purpose of the
&gt; purchase is profit in the long term. And if the truth
&gt; were told, I would guess that most &quot;antiques&quot; are bought
&gt; with an eye toward future returns of some kind.
&gt; That being so- more or less ;) - I wonder...
&gt; Well, I wonder a lot of things. What about collectors
&gt; for example, who have in the past decade or two found
&gt; that thier milk glass or Avon or younameit collection has
&gt; suddenly become worth significantly less......
&gt; At this point sketchy does not even come close, fragmented
&gt; would be closer, so this is good place to close.

&gt; As always,

Rich,

I agree with you completely. Craftsmanship and history are what matters.

Hi,

I personally never follow fads. I don't think people should collect what
is &quot;trendy&quot; to collect but to purchase what they like and can live with.

&gt; My sentiments entirely. The only people who can/should afford to follow
&gt; fads are dealers who turn their stock over quickly. Well, i suppose
&gt; lucky sellers who jump, on the band-wagon and offload some old junk
&gt; would be happy too... There are two basic rules in buying for
&gt; fun/collecting:

&gt; 1) Only buy it if you like it.
&gt; 2) See rule 1

&gt; People who, say, buy beanie babies by the truckload because they think
&gt; they'll be worth even more in 20 year's time, are doomed to bitter and
&gt; expensive disappointment. &quot;Real&quot; antiques will always be a hedge against
&gt; inflation, and sometime might actually make some profit.

&gt; Cheers, Laurie.

Ronnie,

It's nice your leaving everything to your son. I think its rare that
young people respect or even like antiques. I live with a modern
furniture enthusiast that I
am slowly converting. We are both in our early 30's.

I don't have any children and if I die my antiques and porcelain etc
will go to help endangered animals.

&gt;&gt;dusting, preserving that little bit of history.

&gt; I totally agree with you Tish. However, I'm not so sure about &quot;real estate&quot; :)
&gt; I think Laurie could enlighten you all on the &quot;house market&quot; in Britain
&gt; (England, Wales and Scotland) another sure fire &quot;investment&quot; that turned into
&gt; the big 80's lie. We in N.I are still *unfortunately* living the real estate
&gt; dream ..... pity the poor suckers when the cash comes.

&gt; I don't buy antiques as investments, and by God in the 1990s I sure don't
&gt; market them as investments, that's the other big lie of the 1980s.

&gt; I hope my boy Nathan, (when both I and Alison pass on), will keep the bits and
&gt; pieces we have put together, not for the hope of an investment, or the sheer
&gt; thrill of the monetary worth, but for the objects, their history, the memories
&gt; and what we hopefully have taught him about material objects. Should he decide
&gt; to sell them ....... good luck! to the wee fellow .... I'm certain he'll take
&gt; a quick turn :-)

Hahahaha...The antiques will go on auction and the money they get at the
auction will go towards charities involving endangered animals.

Rococo period 1750-1775 in Swedish antique terms if not European
http://www.stacken.kth.se/~xymox/swedish_antiques.html  (see chart)
Taken from a Swedish book about Swedish antique periods.

If someone can lead me to a European general antiques period chart I can
put it
on my other antique page.

Thanks,
Kathleen

Hi,

Well the Rococo period in Sweden is from 1750-1755 but who's style
spills over to the
Gustavianskt period (1775-1810) in Sweden, named after a Swedish King
(Gustav III) who was very influenced by the French Rococo period. The
Rococo style tends to differ from country to country but seems to have
ornateness and romantacism common in its unified style. The Swedish
Rococo style isn't very ornate compared with furniture from other
countries of the same period. Guess it has to do with the Swedish love
of simplicity
and usefulness.

My English dictionary from 1892 describes it as &quot;from roc meaning rock
work being a character of the style.A debased variety of ornament of the
time of Louis XIV and XV
characterized by meaningless scrolls conventional shell work sometimes
applied in contempt to anything bad or tasteless in decorative art.

Sounds like he didn't like the period very much!

My modern dictionary defines it as &quot;A style of architecture, decoration,
and furniture
making prevailing in Louis XV's time, marked by ornamental details
unrelated to structure and unsymetrical and broken curves, a freer
development of the Baroquein the
style of the rococo.

Yes &quot;Rococo&quot; is a nice name for the period :))))

From my antiques glossary page  http://www.brownowl.com/  :

Rocaille: A French word meaning rockwork, often applied to shell and
rockwork decoration found in Rococo work.

Rococo: A term derived from the French rocaille meaning rockwork, this
extravagant architectural and decorative style developed in France in
the early C18th,
spreading to and being developed all over Europe. It was principally a
reaction against, and was born out of, the heaviness and seriousness of
Baroque. Principally used
in interior decoration, its influence spilled over into furniture
design. In essence it was frivolous, light and asymmetrical, its
principal motifs being Chinese and Indian
motifs, and delicate curvaceous shapes.

Cheers, Laurie.

provenance being served up by reputable dealers as &quot;antiques,&quot; mostly to the
nouveau riche, including the foreign monied. &quot;Chandelier bidding&quot; has become
the norm, even in some of the reputable auction houses.

Rarity and provenance are the only two elements that will never change. A
Tiffany will survive simply because there will be no more &lt;at least those with
good provenance&gt;.

there's a world-wide conflagration of Beanie Babies &lt;ok, so I dream big and
