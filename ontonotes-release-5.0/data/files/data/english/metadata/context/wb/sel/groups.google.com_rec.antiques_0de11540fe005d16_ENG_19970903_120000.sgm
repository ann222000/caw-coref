I thought I had found a real treasure. I was looking through
a 1900 era bible, and found a newspaper dated 1800. I paged through
it, and there it was. The announcement of the death of General
George Washington!!!
As I looked closer, I found that this was merely a reproduction
of the 1800 newspaper, commemorating 100 years since his death!

My question....Is it still a treasure? A 1900 repro of an 1800
newspaper? It is yellowed, but there isn't any wear or tearing
anywhere on it.

Thanx in advance for any info ya'll can provide!

"/> Yes, you're right. This is undoubtedly a reproduction. Is the paper by any
chnace from Ulster County, New york? We found such a paper in my mother's
belongings and were similarly thrilled until we learned that these are
quite common. I think the one that we have was produced for the U.S.
Centennial in 1876, though my memory could be faulty on this.

I understand there is little value to these. Would be happy to find out
that I'm wrong.

For information on old newspapers you may wish to contact Rick Brown of
the Newspaper Collecotrs Society of America, P.O. Box 19134, Lansing MI
48901. I'm not sure what they still do, but at one point you could order a
24 page primer that had all kinds of information on the most asked
newspaper questions which included both the information about Washington's
Death newspapers and Lincoln Assassination newspapers. Judging by the
number of calls we get at AntiqueWeek, numerous people have kept copies of
all of the papers which were reproduced over the years.
