FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

PBS AND STILETTO TELEVISION PRESENT

BARRY MANILOW: GREAT SONGS FROM THE SEVENTIES

- A New PBS Television Special To Air December 2007 -

Los Angeles, CA, August 28, 2007 - Legendary songwriter and performer
Barry
Manilow revisits the 70s for his new high-definition television
special, Barry
Manilow: Great Songs From The Seventies, airing on PBS during its
December Fundraising Campaign.
Inspired by his highly anticipated CD, The Greatest Songs of the
Seventies, the
television event will not only feature Manilow in concert, but sharing
his
personal experiences with the audience.

Barry Manilow: Great Songs From The Seventies will be taped before a
live
audience on September 12th at Steiner Studios in Brooklyn, New York, a
return to
the city where Manilow was born and raised.  Manilow will also reunite
with
director David Mallet, who helmed last year's Barry Manilow: Music and
Passion
for which Manilow won an Emmy Award for &quot;Outstanding Individual
Performance in a
Variety or Music Program.&quot;  As a director, Mallet's work includes
specials for
Elton John, Celine Dion, The Rolling Stones, Madonna, U2 and Cher
(where he won
an Emmy for The Farewell Tour).

Manilow's music is synonymous with the 70s.  His songs helped define
the era,
and Barry Manilow: Great Songs From The Seventies will revisit some of
those
songs, as well as some of his own favorites from the decade - many of
which are featured
on his new CD.  Industry charts have ranked Manilow as the undisputed
number one
adult contemporary artist of all time with record sales exceeding 70
million
worldwide.  He has written hundreds of songs and performed around the
globe,
thrilling millions of fans and winning a Grammy, two Emmys, several
Tony Awards,
and an Oscar nomination.

In 2006, Manilow celebrated one of the most successful years of his
career. The
Greatest Songs of the Fifties entered the Billboard charts at #1; the
PBS
special, Barry Manilow: Music and Passion, earned him an Emmy; and The
Greatest
Songs of the Sixties hit the charts at number two.

STILETTO Television develops, produces and distributes groundbreaking
programs,
including the first original musical movie made for television, and
has garnered
national recognition for its docudramas on American life.   Principals
Garry C.
Kief, Mark C. Grove, and Troy P. Queen will serve as Executive
Producers for Barry Manilow: Great Songs From The Seventies.

That is SO true, Brenda.  I have a friend who traveled all the way to
L.A. to see Barry's taping at the Kodak Theatre, thinking that perhaps
since it was by invitiation only to the members of the &quot;BMIFC&quot;
everyone would actaully be able to be seated based on your membership.
As it turned out, they had a special line off to one side which
consisted of younger &quot;fans&quot;, (mainly girls), who were tagged with
wrist bands;  THESE were the ones who had been hand picked to sit down
close to the stage to look good for the cameras.
Also, the invitation which had been sent out to the BMIFC members
clearly stated that they were to dress rather business like, but the
ones who had been banded were dressed in anything BUT dresses, suits,
etc.
It's quite noticable when you watch the tape that the first few rows
consist of lots of bouncing boobs and no one over the age of 30 or so,
still banded.

Just one of the reasons why I'd never bother to go to one of his
tapings.  What the heck kind of a way is that for *them* to treat his
fans, anyway????????

I know of two people that went...

..to the Kodak taping of UM from the fan club. Neither of them were under
thirty, and both were over two-hundred pounds. Both were &quot;die-hard&quot;
fan-club members, both had been waiting and were one of the &quot;firsts.&quot; Both
posted regularly on the B'net before UM special. AFTER, both said to me
privately by e-mail, that the way they were treated as opposed to the
&quot;belly-button&quot; girls, that if they never saw Manilow &quot;live&quot; again, that it
would suit them &quot;just fine.&quot; Their posts became less and less, until they
just &quot;disappeared&quot; into B'net oblivion.

How sad. To alienate your core fan base, just to &quot;sex-up&quot; an aging
crooner's image. (AND, it DIDN'T need sexing up, he was doing just fine!)
I treasure my own memories of seeing him live, but after what happened to
my friends, and how put-off they were, and how it tarnished otherwise
wonderful memories of this brillant man, all in the name of image, I am
almost grateful that I didn't suffer through this experience. Yes, they
enjoyed the actual taping, but being treated as third-rate people
and-second-rate &quot;extra's&quot; in Manilow-world, and someone whose image was
built BY these very same people, I find just appalling.

Some punk-rockers treated thier fans better, and that is saying alot.

The second night of the taping is the beginning of Rosh Hashana (one
of the two holiest days in Jews).  I realize Barry doesn't observe
anymore, but many of his fans (like me) still do and so do many of the

No summer attire.......and apparently no Jews either.

I was lucky enough to go to the taping that was done in Nashville.

I think that was the last one that was done where the fans COULD sit
down front (I had second and third row).  It was one of the best times
I ever had as a fan.

And all the fans raved about it.

And I think a lot of folks went out to the Kodak hoping for the same
experience - and they got burned.

I hope against hope that things will be different in New York but -
given Barry's alleged five plastic surgeries - it seems the pressure
on him to deliver a younger image (and that includes his fans, who are
a reflection of him) is worse than ever.

While I don't agree with the way the fans get treated at some of the
tapings, I can't say that I don't understand the rationale behind it. This
is a business, folks, and it's all about the bottom line. The days of
consistently rewarding loyalty are pretty much long gone.

I have to say, however, that I don't completely disagree with providing
guidelines for attire (many talk show do the same thing); if people
dressed appropriately for his shows, they wouldn't need to send out
instructions. I know that people don't really &quot;get dressed&quot; for shows like
they used to, but I can't believe what many consider to be acceptable
evening/show attire. T-shirts, shorts (!!), sweatshirts...it's appalling.

Let's be real for a moment, shall we? Take a look at the photos from past
Barry conventions...are you really surprised that TPTB don't want an
audience that looks like that??

Not totally.  Certainly not in the Country Genre or certain artists.
(Another example, getting reading and performing for two hours, then a
set number of fan meetings backstage, Weird Al continued to the back
stage door and met and signed more autographs from fans.  Genuinely a
NICE guy.)  I think the days of any longtime fan just getting to meet
Barry because they are a long time fan are long gone.  If one lowers
their high hopes or expectations, though, it is pretty neat that you'd
get to go to a taping, no matter the distance.

I'd say have fun with the dress.  One can't lose wearing basic black.
Decide if you are a Carrie, Miranda, Samantha, or Charlotte.  Just
don't wear a Scrunchie.  Apparently that isn't in the Manhatten code
according to Sex and The City and Ms. Bradshaw.  Send the BMIFC
updated e-mails and photos with ones botox experiements, weight loss
methods on the way to front seat worthiness.  Letters of
recommendation from, who's the guy that rates celebs?  Blackstone?
Maybe a showing of your classy outfit and picture in contrast to the
latest outfit that Brittney Spears went out in public with would be a
hoot.

If one gets to go, just have fun with it.  It'll be an adventure no
matter what, right?

I'd never really be interested in going to a taping but... if I had
ever seen this type of behavior, I'd do the below:

1. observe taking mental notes - to ensure what I am seeing is what is
happening
2. find the manager and let them know what I am observing and my
obvious disdain
3. walk out and write to BMIFC and let them know the same
4. fine a new singer to admire... and spend my hard earned money
on...

In the end, it is not the famous that wield the power, it is the
consumer.  We have buying power, in that we can chose to or not to.
With these shows, we can choose to 'not' view or to view.  Every
decision sends a strong message.

In this, we say we will condone this or that we feel it is just wrong
to sort people like live stock... Wonder if they looked at their teeth
too?

I think I would be MORE angry if I found out this was true and was put
in the front row....

Look, its not about just Barry's singing, its the way he treats
people, helps out when he can and basically the personality he brings
to the stage and in public when he's 'ON'.  When Barry's people do
things such as this, it does not matter that he is or is not aware
because they are representing him and his name, which is a brand.  So,
I suggest if he knows about this, he put a stop to it, or really think
through how one person turning away from his music can affect others.

I mentioned that I am looking at other albums, and might - might not
buy this one of Barry's.... the more I hear things like his. the more
I think I'll keep looking.. Maybe..well maybe I'll take a cue from him
and his people, and go look up a musician with tight buns, cute face
and 'YOUNG'....

Well?  Turn about is fair play after all...

Deb..
Sorry for being cranky... on meds and sick :(  (its in another post).

Peace out.

I often walk by the hair dye section, especially recently, with my eye
brows getting silver... I guess I am lucky, my hair is long-ish (had
it trimmed) very dark (almost black) and the silver infront is very
nice ... (alot of silver upfront and top).  I have a sensitivity to
hair dye (tried it once).  Heck, I cannot use the same shampoo more
than one week - develop a sensitivity to it...

Last week I was picking up a container and wondered... what price
vanity... am I willing to feel the burn, be uncomfortable, and yes
even get scabs where my scalp burned and beld?  or.. do I want to be -
who I am...

Sure I wear makeup... last few weeks been sick (found out today its
pluersy and bronchitis)... not wore makeup and know what?  World did
not come to an end.  I went to and held my meetings - I still
maintained an air of dignity and sincerity and held my own.  The make-
up or prettying up - did not make me who I am, nor does it make me
less when I choose not to wear it.

I understand the battle - especially as I see the signs of aging, the
hands - the brown spots on my face, and again, the silver in my
hair... and there is nothing wrong with dying your hair, getting your
surgery to take away some age, and etc... but you have to be doing it
for all of the right reasons.

I realized that I am comfortable with who I am... and running out with
wet hair, no makeup - is my call, and I'm still the same person if I
had ran out of the house with my hair made up, makeup on and nice
dress.... and I expect to be treated the same.

You cannot force people to think of you as young, and youth has its
problems... an older, mature person is generally wise, knowing of
common matters and mindful of mistakes.  When the young rush off due
to impatience, the older, wait... because they know they will be back,
to ask for advice and help once it all blows up in their face.  Older
people have power just through their knowledge, abilities and skills
and so I am proud to wear my silver... it defines me as an elder...

well peace out

---------

While I agree.... than you can say this is one of two things, but both
come down to 'profiling'.  Selecting an audience to be towards the
front, because they fit desired specifications.

So... some questions are:

1.  if it is about looks - give me a reason that gives this credence?
(everyone else is doing it?  we want to appeal to a certain type of
audience? (why? old audience is some how not good enough).

2. if it is about clothing - okay, I do not own any dresses.... with
my budget I might not be able to dress as nice as they wish.  So how
hard are they cutting - if my hair is not done, if my dress is plain -
its a no-go, or does this come about by giving me an 'up and down
sweep' and seeing if I appear to be over the line of 'low-to-medium
income'...

3.  Handicapped - why not.... were there any handicapped upfront

4.  Race, Gender, Age - were these three covered as well?

I would of loved to be in the meeting deciding how the lines were cut,
because no matter how you slice a line, you ARE 'profiling'.

I'll ask one question here... if it is true, ehhh  because we know how
some peps think we make alot over nothing.... if it was true, would it
be something they could stand up and say 'yes we do - we sort the line
based upon these specific reasons'.... If it was true, could they
admit to it in press ?  to the fans?

If its true then why not just make two signs -

If you are not as attractive as the person on this board - stand in
that line, if you are not dressed as nice, etc... (and so on).

See so my question is... if it is the right thing to do - do it
openly... if you cannot.. then.. why are you doing it?

People like me - that tend to get their nose bent out of shape when
they feel others are some how 'measuring' them can be vocal.  Like now
for example.

And when you feel yourself offering up excuses, remember - I am not
some young, doe-eyed child that swallows everything she hears from
some one - famous or not.

When I went to Barry's concerts, back in 1985 and 1987, I had nothing
pretty to wear.... I made what I wore from cloth that was on sale for
$1 a yard, I cut the zipper and buttons from old clothes and covered
them with cloth so you could not tell they did not match.  I got my
shoes from thirft.

So excuse me in feeling that I might of not made the front row.  The
first time I was about 7 months pregnant and the second time I had
just had a baby.. I am guessing...not in the 'good' group here.

sorry for attitude.. still sick. (running temp).  I get kinda mean
when I am sick.

I have a question for those who attended the Nashville and/or LA
tapings: how long before the tapings were you told that you had
tickets ?   'Cause it seems to me that the day before (9-10 for shows
on the 11th and 12th) is cutting it a *little* close.

I was going to say &quot;do they really expect people to drive/fly in from

Just like announcing a tour date on a Friday and putting tickets on

Thing is, there will be diehards that will come in droves for the
taping no matter the size, shape, age, or monetary status -- always
there, always it's a given they'll be there.   It is short notice
though, for those scheduling planes, etc.   Make it a double scoop,

&gt; &gt; Peg

&gt; -------------

&gt; I'd never really be interested in going to a taping but... if I had
&gt; ever seen this type of behavior, I'd do the below:

&gt; 1. observe taking mental notes - to ensure what I am seeing is what is
&gt; happening
&gt; 2. find the manager and let them know what I am observing and my
&gt; obvious disdain
&gt; 3. walk out and write to BMIFC and let them know the same
&gt; 4. fine a new singer to admire... and spend my hard earned money
&gt; on...

&gt; In the end, it is not the famous that wield the power, it is the
&gt; consumer.  We have buying power, in that we can chose to or not to.
&gt; With these shows, we can choose to 'not' view or to view.  Every
&gt; decision sends a strong message.

&gt; In this, we say we will condone this or that we feel it is just wrong
&gt; to sort people like live stock... Wonder if they looked at their teeth
&gt; too?

&gt; I think I would be MORE angry if I found out this was true and was put
&gt; in the front row....

&gt; Look, its not about just Barry's singing, its the way he treats
&gt; people, helps out when he can and basically the personality he brings
&gt; to the stage and in public when he's 'ON'.  When Barry's people do
&gt; things such as this, it does not matter that he is or is not aware
&gt; because they are representing him and his name, which is a brand.  So,
&gt; I suggest if he knows about this, he put a stop to it, or really think
&gt; through how one person turning away from his music can affect others.

&gt; I mentioned that I am looking at other albums, and might - might not
&gt; buy this one of Barry's.... the more I hear things like his. the more
&gt; I think I'll keep looking.. Maybe..well maybe I'll take a cue from him
&gt; and his people, and go look up a musician with tight buns, cute face
&gt; and 'YOUNG'....

&gt; Well?  Turn about is fair play after all...

&gt; Deb..
&gt; Sorry for being cranky... on meds and sick :(  (its in another post).

I agree with you deb.  I have gone to the dark side myself.  In Nov
last year I took notice of Michael Buble and haven't looked back.  Saw
him at the Greek here in Los Angeles in Sept and he got me &quot;hook, line
and sinker!!&quot;  Little more fan friendly and VERY  good looking!!
Granted he hasn't been around as long as Barry and his fans are not as
crazy.....yet.  Great show and very easy on the eyes.  I've been a
fan of Barrys for 30+ yrs but I'm not crazy about the 70's album  I
think I'll wait for something brand new.....Thank Goodness Michael is
young   me thinks the wait will be long!!!!!!!

I too have strayed. Looking into other musicians/artists.

I always will love Barry...for his brilliance, his vocal virtuosity, his
arrangements, and writing. Having said that, BECAUSE of the pomposity and
arrogance and utter insensitivity of those in Camp Manilow as well as
Manilow himself, I am * &quot;no more a worshipping fan.&quot; (*quote by
Manilow/Anderson from: &quot;I Want To Be Somebody's Baby.&quot;*)

So, I too have &quot;Gone to the Dark Side.&quot; (Winks to Deb.)

I have (belately to the younger generation,) &quot;discovered&quot; the young Robin
Thicke on American Idol finals. He is the son of Alan Thicke. Robin's
music is a really smoothe, smoky blend of soul, pop, and Latino pop-ala
Marc Anthony. Oh, he is HOT! I told my 22-y.o.daughter about him, and she
just about went crazy when she finally heard him.

Also still like very much, Josh Groban. I am also really liking Coldplay.
(Gweneth Paltrow's husband's band.) Like the newer country artists. I am
also into Micheal W. Smith, Steven Curtis Chapman, Clannad, Secret Garden
(Irish &amp; Irish- Scandinavian band &amp; duo respectively.) I have a wide
variety of tastes, including dance, some LIGHT hip-hop, salsa, and even
have a compilation of LadySmith Black Mombaza, (South-African acapella
group-remember Paul Simon's song &quot;Diamonds on the Soles of their
Shoes&quot;?-they sang the background.)

I can't say that I'm into Buble'. Just too &quot;piano bar&quot; for me. Don't like
&quot;piano bar&quot; styles.

If anyone has any other &quot;new&quot; discoveries out there, let me know. I am
into new music, and always expanding my library. As of today, I have
counted 2253 CD'S in my catalog A-Z. (Very organized!) BTW, my Manilow
collection tops out at over 120 alone! (Don't ask!)

I did think of that too Vicki.  Usually in NYC there is a memorial
every year on that day so I imagine if that's the case this year,
traffic will be a nightmare.
Someone else brought up the fact that the confirmations only come a
day prior and how can one make reservations for travel and hotels on
such late notice.
TPTB know fans well enough that some will jump through hoops of fire
(expect that at the next free taping) just to be part of the whole
Barrylicious experience.

">

--------------

I like Josh Groban  really good sound but... at the same time, I do
like how personable Barrys songs are.  Josh is singing to sing, but
Barry's songs just have much more emotion in them....Hard to explain
but its like you feel the pain, sadness... and he is singing from
'it'.

But, I do not choose who I like or do not like based upon their album
covers, how sexy they are or even their age.  Leave that to the teens
who are still at the age for crushes... and so in this I am confused
about why Barry buys into this... I think he has too many people
whispering in his ear about how 'looks' are so omni important..... for
him and for fans being caught on camera.

Reality is, people are people - are people.  We like what we like and
will buy same... snub us or insult us, well some might stay because
they will smooth it over but some will keep weighing it - but stay
loyal and some will say... uh.. you all, they are kinda insulting us
here....

I do not get out much so I can only base my observations on what I
hear .... or am told but... I have to admit, that when so many are
saying 'did you see this or this or this'.. I have to seriously ask
myself if this is a pattern and why.

So.... its simple, if we fans are just not what they want sitting in
the front row, if we some how cannot make the cut or meet their
standards, then ehh... maybe I should do... same.. right?  Power is in
the purchasing...

When the new album comes out.. I'll stand there - look it over, pick
it up - and make my decision.... maybe pick out another album - hot
guy onfront, nicely dresssed - and 'compare' the two... use the bmifc
method of screening.... see how it all comes out.. ;)

But we all know - in the end, its not about what you appear to be - on
the outside, its about who you are on the inside right?  Barry would
win... so... one last question... if Barry were a regular person -
standing in line waiting to be sorted - which side would he be sorted
to?

Just curious.. and I'll let it die.

peace out

Sorry for coming to the party so late, but I was out of town and just saw
this.

The irony with all of this is that while TPTB seem to be be rejecting the
long term (read aging in years and appearance) fans in favor of the
youthful in what seems to be a pathetic attempt to make Barry's market
appear to be younger, we all prefer his God-given, original face to the
&quot;new/improved&quot; surgically altered one.  Geez, we all not only accepted him
as he was, but preferred it.  Guess our &quot;love&quot; was pretty much
unconditional but his isn't, eh?

Sadly, while Barry has always professed to be amazed at the length of his
career - courtesy of his loyal fans - it would appear that he's come to
take them for granted.  I live in Maryland and could possibly get myself
to NYC for a taping, but I wouldn't even think of doing it on that short
amount of notice.  Do they have no respect for work and life obligations
or is that just it - they think we have no life or will move heaven and
earth for the chance to see Barry perform?  It would be really interesting
to know the profile of the audience in terms of where they live.

From a fan standpoint, I pale in comparison to many, having attended maybe
8 concerts.  I've never been to a BMIFC Convention or to see his show in
Vegas.  But I've been a fan since the beginning and I used to read the TV
Guide listings to make sure I didn't miss an appearance.  It's probably a
good thing the internet didn't exist back in those days or I'd have
probably been whipped into such a frenzy I'd have exploded.  Up until
these cover albums, I bought every album and then I replaced them all with
the CD version(s).  I think I have 5 copies/version of HATM.

Bottom line, I will always be a Manilow fan and I think he'll always be my
favorite, most listened-to musician.  I can't even explain my interest in
reading and occasionally posting on a site like this - it's like once you
have an addiction, you never fully recover.  But I'll confess that I've
cheated on him in recent years.  I, too, like Josh Groban, find Fountains
of Wayne catchy and hysterical and have a huge CD collection of assorted
musicians, but Barry will always be my main squeeze, even if I doubt I'd
make it to the front cause I'm not young or pretty enough and my ta-ta's
aren't riding high enough to meet the standards.

Sorry for the length of this post/rant.  I guess it struck a nerve that
we're good enough to sell items to, but we have to conform to a dress code
and appearance standard in order to be seen.  I guess it's not cool to have
old fans ... even if we grew up with him ... and stuck by him when God
knows it's never been cool to be a Manilow fan.  Shutting myself up ...

Mine too.

And someday - years from now - when we look back and remember Barry, I
don't think we'll dwell much on the crappy, superficial shit.  We'll
remember the concerts and the music and the friends and the good times
and the random acts of kindness and all the good that came out of the
whole glorious thing and we'll just be thrilled we got to experience
him at all.

didn't have a problem with the way he looked before either. It's his
face and if he wasn't happy with the way he looked and if he had
something done, then more power to him because if I had the money I'd
practically live in a plastic surgeon's office. There's nothing
pathetic about his attempt to make his market appear younger because
I've seen quite a few people at his shows in Vegas who are younger
than a lot of his long term fans.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Sadly, while Barry has always professed to be amazed at the length of his
&gt; career - courtesy of his loyal fans - it would appear that he's come to
&gt; take them for granted.  I live in Maryland and could possibly get myself
&gt; to NYC for a taping, but I wouldn't even think of doing it on that short
&gt; amount of notice.  Do they have no respect for work and life obligations
&gt; or is that just it - they think we have no life or will move heaven and
&gt; earth for the chance to see Barry perform?  It would be really interesting
&gt; to know the profile of the audience in terms of where they live.
">

What makes you think Barry didn't realize this is short notice for
a lot of people? This is short notice for him, his band, and PBS as
well, but for everyone who's been complaining about a taping they
aren't going to attend, there are a lot of people who are excited
about the chance to be there.

I, too, like Josh Groban, find Fountains

&gt; of Wayne catchy and hysterical and have a huge CD collection of assorted
&gt; musicians, but Barry will always be my main squeeze, even if I doubt I'd
&gt; make it to the front cause I'm not young or pretty enough and my ta-ta's
&gt; aren't riding high enough to meet the standards.
">

Someone else already commented on this but I'd like to know how you
know for sure that what happened at the Kodak will be repeated? Sure
there were some young people sitting in the stage seats but I saw some
older fans mixed in with them, and not everybody in the first few rows
on the floor was a twenty something size four with a Playboy
centerfold bustline.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Sorry for the length of this post/rant.  I guess it struck a nerve that
&gt; we're good enough to sell items to, but we have to conform to a dress code
&gt; and appearance standard in order to be seen.  I guess it's not cool to have
&gt; old fans ... even if we grew up with him ... and stuck by him when God
&gt; knows it's never been cool to be a Manilow fan.  Shutting myself up ...
">

Oh come on, you know that if some people aren't told in advance
they'd show up wearing jeans, sneakers,and a t shirt with Barry's face
plastered on it thinking that was suitable attire for a television
appearance. Did it ever occur to anyone that he wants the fans who are
going to be in that studio to look their best just to show those
people who think it's not cool to be a Barry Manilow fan that we're
not the way the media likes to portray us? He said himself on QVC
today that we're beautiful, intelligent, amazing people and he knows
because he's met so many of us. Yeah you're going to say he's met
those of us who could pay over a $1000 a pop, but if Barry didn't want
to continue with these Platinums they would have been discontinued a
long time ago. But thanks for proving once again that there's no fan
like a long time fan; jaded, cynical, and always looking for a chance
to gripe.

Crystal,

Can you get down off your &quot;petty stool&quot; and stop doing the superiority
dance on top of other fans' heads?  You're no better fan than anyone
else, and everyone is entitled to gripe now and again - after all, we
ARE paying customers! (and this ISN'T the Barrynet!)

And, for the record, a lot of fans are very unhappy over the PBS
taping rules.  The latest piece of brilliance is that fans are being
told they can't bring their purses in!  So ... if you don't drive in
to the city and have a car to leave your purse in, does that mean
you're disqualified from going?  Or disqualified because you're a
woman?

Oh, and the fine print also states that you're not GUARANTEED a seat
even if you do receive an email stating you have one.

The BMIFC could have handled this one MUCH better than they did.  The
fans attending the PBS taping should have nothing to anticipate other
than fun.  They shouldn't have to deal with peptic ulcers just to
attend a taping.

A gripe now and again? This is a 24/7 bitch fest and it pretty much
always has been and always will be. I also never claimed to be a
better fan than anyone else; I just don't let every little thing Barry/
Garry/Stiletto/the BMIFC does or doesn't do give me an ulcer. If I
don't want to buy a certain item all the hotlines in the world aren't
going to get me to do so, and if I can't go to something like a taping
I'm happy for those who can and hope they have a good time.

This is the first I've heard of any fans being unhappy or not being
allowed to bring their purses in; that's either going to be dropped or
they'll come up with some way to appease them.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

That's because these studios have a limited amount of floor space
which was also in the email, so I would imagine the BMIFC wants to
make sure everyone attending understands that due to limited space
they may not be able to attend before they arrive, and it might be a
good idea to make sure they get there early.

The same mythical person who appointed you their supreme judge and

C'mon, Crystal ...

There are PLENTY of posts out here in cyberspace that applaud Barry,
compliment Barry, celebrate the wonder of all that is Manilow (in
fact, I've written a few of them!  How about that?).  So it's NOT a
&quot;24/7 bitchfest&quot;.  But lately, when it comes to fan-bashing, you're
your own 24/7 bitchfest.
It's like you can't wait for someone to post something negative about
Barry so you can rip into them for it.

I've let plenty of posts that had me grinding my teeth go without
comment so that's no more true than you claiming I've been appointed
supreme judge and jury of fans. If my calling the ng a 24/7 bitchfest
bothers you perhaps you'd rather I'd compare it to Fox or Faux news
instead?

I'm not going to post another thing on this - except:

I don't agree with everything everyone writes, but I respect the right of
those people to speak their mind, as I was of the opinion this is a forum
to do just that.  Flaming people, in my opinion, does nothing but prevents
people who may have a lot to share (not that I necessarily do) from coming
out of lurk-dom and posting.

Sorry if anyone was offended or if I gave the mistaken impression that I
have anything but respect and admiration for Barry Manilow's music.
