*A FOOT HAS NO NOSE* - An African tale narrated by the experiencer Of the
many interactions I had with my mother those many years ago, one stands out
with clarity. I remember the occasion when mother sent me to the main road,
about twenty yards away from the homestead, to invite a passing group of
seasonal work-seekers home for a meal. She instructed me to take a container
along and collect dry cow dung for making a fire. I was then to prepare the
meal for the group of work-seekers. The thought of making an open fire
outside at midday, cooking in a large three-legged pot in that intense heat,
was sufficient to upset even an angel. I did not manage to conceal my
feelings from my mother and, after serving the group, she called me to the
veranda where she usually sat to attend to her sewing and knitting. Looking
straight into my eyes, she daid &quot;Boy, why did you sulk when I requested you
to prepare a meal for those poor destitute people?&quot; Despite my attempt to
deny her allegation, and using the heat of the fire and the sun as an excuse
for my alleged behaviour, mother, giving me a firm look, said &quot;&quot;Lonao ga lo
na nko&quot; - &quot;A foot has no nose&quot;. It means: you cannot detect what trouble may
lie ahead of you. Had I denied this group of people a meal, it may have
happened that, in my travels some time in the future, I found myself at the
mercy of those very individuals. As if that was not enough to shame me,
mother continued: &quot;Motho ke motho ka motho yo mongwe&quot;. The literal meaning:
&quot;A person is a person because of another person&quot;!!

That day I learnt the most wonderful lesson of life that even the suffering
people have a lot to teach us for our own upliftment of the soul!

SPIRITUAL COMMENTARY

Suffering people are often our best teachers.When someone we love suffers,
we suffer with that person, and we would not have it otherwise, because the
suffering and the love are one, just as it is with God's love for us. It is
really rather foolish to so often feel we have to say something brilliant
and enlightening to someone who is suffering but simple companionship and
love &amp; concern from someone is what suffering people often crave for - not a
course in philosophy.

There is a beautiful short story which explains the essence of helping
others during their times of crisis (narrated by an anonymous person)- &quot;On
the street I saw a small girl cold and shivering in a thin dress, with
little hope of a decent meal. I became angry and said to God, Why did you
permit this? Why don't you do something about it? For a while God said
nothing. That night He replied quite suddenly, I certainly did do something
about it, I made you.&quot;

God has created us to help eachother and keep eachother happy and peaceful.
We all need eachother to comfort us during times of our crisis. We think we
understand another person's struggle, until God reveals the same
shortcomings in our lives.In whatever God does in the course of our lives,
he gives us, through the experience, some power to help others.

*How can we help others ease their suffering?*

-Listen, Listen, Listen - the person who is grieving must be allowed an open
expression of feelings without condemnation at all stages of the grief
process.

-Understand your own feelings - be honest about those feelings.

-Affirm the value of the one who is grieving - share memories and stories.

-Don't use cliches. They are meaningless, devalue the person, and show a
real lack of understanding.

-Encourage reality. Gently and patiently help the person to accept what has
happened and to go on with life.

-Weep with them. Tears unite us when words fail !

-Don't stifle their grief. Every human being must go through the grief
process after suffering a significant loss.

-Touch, don't talk. One hug can say more than a million words.

-Give practical help. Plan meals, clean the house, help make arrangements,
care for the children, give some relief from daily requirements.

-Don't avoid talking about the afflicted or departed one.

-Motivate them to mingle with others. Invite them over to dinner or for an
outing.

-Don't disappear after a couple of weeks. Be committed to care after the
initial crisis is past.

It is one of the most beautiful compensations of this life that no man can
sincerely help another without helping himself.

&quot;Everybody can be great, because anybody can serve, you don't have to have a
college degree to serve. You don't have to make your subject and your verb
agree to serve. You don't have to know about Plato and Aristotle to serve.
You don't have to know Einstein's theory of relativity to serve. You don't
have to know the second law of thermodynamics in physics to serve. You only
need a heart full of grace. A soul generated by love. &quot; Martin Luther King

So do all the good you can, by all the means you can, in all the ways you
can, in all the places you can, at all times you can, by all the means you
can, as long as ever you can!

*SHARPEN THE AXE*

Once upon a time, a very strong woodcutter asked for a job at a timber
merchant's, and got it. The pay was really good and so were the work
conditions. For that reason, the woodcutter was determined to do his best.

His boss gave him an axe and showed him the area where he was supposed to
work. The first day, the woodcutter brought eighteen trees

&quot;Congratulations,&quot; said the boss. &quot;Go on that way !&quot;

Motivated for the boss' words, the woodcutter tried harder the next day, but
he only could bring only fifteen trees. The third day he tried even harder,
but could manage just ten trees. Day by day he brought less and less trees.

&quot;I must be losing my strength.&quot; the woodcutter thought. He went to his boss
and apologized, saying he could not understand what was going on.

&quot;When was the last time you sharpened your axe?&quot; the boss asked.
&quot;Sharpen? I had no time to sharpen my axe. I have been very busy trying to
cut trees.&quot;!

*SPIRITUAL COMMENTARY*

Our lives are like that. We sometimes get so busy that we don't take time to
&quot;Sharpen The Axe&quot;.

In today's world, it seems that everyone is busier than ever, but less happy
than ever. Why is that?

Could it be that we have forgotten how to stay sharp? There's nothing wrong
with activity and hard work. But God doesn't want us to get so busy that we
neglect the truly important things in life, like taking time to pray, to
read and do noble things in life.

We all need time to relax, to think and meditate, to learn and grow. If we
don't take time to sharpen the
axe, we will become dull and lose our effectiveness.

So start today. Think about the ways in which you could do your job more
effectively and make your life more meaningful and add a lot of value to
it!!
