About the festival

The Public Service Broadcasting Trust presents Open Frame 2007, its annual
international film festival and forum on public service broadcasting and
cultural diversity. Organised in partnership with UNESCO, the Prasar Bharati
Corporation, INPUT, Max Meuller Bhavan and the India Habitat Centre, the
festival is scheduled to be held between 24 August and 1 September 2007, at
the India Habitat Centre, New Delhi. The festival will showcase challenging
productions from Asia and the rest of the world, while stimulating
reflection on current audio-visual production trends and public service
broadcasting issues.

INPUT, a voluntary organization founded in 1978, is dedicated to the concept
of television as a public service in public interest; access to honest,
innovative, provocative, courageous and challenging broadcasting is a
universal fundamental human right. INPUT encourages high quality television
programming worldwide, supports television as a public service, fosters
discussion and debate about television as a craft and serves as a global
meeting point for those who make television. It also recognizes the
potential of television to promote better understanding among different
cultures. INPUT has been organizing the most important and influential
Annual Screening Conference in international television for over 25 years.
This unique event – held in a different country each year – encourages the
development of public service television by screening and debating the most
outstanding programmes from around the world.

Simon Laub is a liberal left-wing pacifist and a literature professor. He
gets torn out of his easygoing, hedonistic lifestyle when his son Felix gets
ripped off by Can, a turkish youth. As he tries to interfere, he finds
himself entering a violent world that he is not used to. Concepts of
'respect' and 'honor' as used by his young antagonist do not mean much to
him. But his method of solving problems through talking does not work with
Can. They provoke each other and both make mistakes as a result of their
misunderstandings until they end up in a deadly spiral.

When the priest pronounced them “man and wife”, Edilberto and Cristina had
been having sex for a long time. Both considered good sex an excellent
reason to get married, and today they are a young solid couple, united by
love. In this chapter of the series, along with other youngsters they voice
their opinions on a topic they love: sex. They tell us why, with whom, and
when to have it. We hear the voice of those who have never had sex, those
who love it, those who only have sex when in love, those who like men and
women as well. It is all about voiceless youngsters talking boldly about
sex.

Mischief was an innovative and wildly ambitious series tackling topical and
often serious issues by combining humour with solid journalism and taking
unique approaches to stories that are often the reserve of more serious
current affairs programming. In Let’s Make A Baby – one of the lighter
episodes in the series – the idea was to test how far reality TV makers and
contestants would be prepared to go. A preposterous, fake but almost
believable idea was hatched and then presented, promoted and pitched to the
world’s TV organization. Auditions were held for willing contestants to take
part in this most ethically grotesque reality TV format. Would anyone
actually believe it was real? And worse, would anyone want to buy it and
take part in it?
