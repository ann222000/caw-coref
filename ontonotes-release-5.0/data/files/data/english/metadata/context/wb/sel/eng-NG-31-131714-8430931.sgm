I was watching Payback *ing Mel Gibson. The screenplay and music
copyrights are dated 1997-1998.

There is a scene where Mel Gibson returns from the dead and meets his
girlfriend. In her house he opens a music box and strains of the
interlude from Jeena Yaha waft out.

There are two possibilities. The music director was inspired by Jeena
Yahan.. or the source is a traditional tune which inspired S-J.

I am inclined to the first.

Sunil

I saw the credits http://imdb.com/title/tt0120784/soundtrack and
noticed Al Jolson's 'Anniversary Waltz'.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=md4_ywlw2aI

Is it this song you were writing about? Or is it one from this list

Yes! That's the one. This comes as a tune from music box.

Does this tune predate MNJ?

Oh, yes! Anniversary Waltz was composed by the great Jolson and Saul
Chaplin
in 1943. More importantly, it is itself inspired by a Rumanian song
composed by Georges Grigoriu 'Valerulie Dinarii&quot; (Waves of the
Danube):

Instrumental (here you can glimpse how Shankar Jaikishan were
inspired)

It is kind of heart breaking, eh, when you find out that one of the finest

Yes, it does. However in this case, it is only the interlude music
that is inspired, nay, copied. The main tune *seems* to be original...
So only tiny corner of my heart...

Agree with you on the second count too. RDB fans prefer to try to
break the heads of the dissenters...

This sort of reflexive, generalized bashing irritates me to no end.
RDB fans are not a monolithic group, and I'm sure their reactions to
RDB's &quot;inspired&quot; songs span the spectrum from disillusionment to
rationalization.  While an absolutist, inspired-songs-are-bad, stance
may work for you, not everyone favors such a simplistic view.  I for
one have no problems enjoying and appreciating &quot;dharti kahe pukaar ke&quot;
or &quot;raahi matwaale&quot; despite their borrowed antecedents.

==============================

Since it is Friday and I want to lighten up this thread, here's a quiz
question on the gentleman named by Ketan. This is an old chestnut in
quizzing circles in India and therefore, will be an easy nut to crack
(no pun intended). Word of honor that you will not google. Some of
this info has been cut and pasted from Wikipedia.

Theodore Roosevelt was hunting in Mississippi in the early part of the
last century. He refused to shoot a particular animal that had been
cornered and tied to a tree, considering it unsportsmanlike.
Washington Post staff artist Clifford K. Berryman made the incident
famous with a front-page cartoon. Among the many readers who saw the
Berryman cartoon was Russian immigrant Morris Michtom, owner of a
small novelty store in Brooklyn, New York. Seeing a potential market,
Morris had his wife make a toy ______, with movable limbs, for sale.
When it sold quickly, the Michtoms made others. After obtaining T.R.'s
permission to use Roosevelt's name in connection with the new toy,
Michtom closed a deal with a large toy wholesaler to distribute the
________.

Question: Which famous cuddly toy (a household word) are we talking
about?

Cheers
Arun

FYI..the animal was badly wounded and dying and TDR hence ordered the mercy
killing of the animal as a humane gesture.
