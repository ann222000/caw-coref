Thanks for the information.  I wasn't expecting it, but I guess it
should be no surprise.  Here's the link to the ACLU story:

http://www.aclu.org/immigrants/workplace/31494prs20070829.html

The ostensible reason the ACLU gives for trying to block the sending
of no-match letters to employers is to protect people who may get
terminated because of innaccuracies in the government database.  The
real reason for their action is that the ACLU wants to protect
illegals who are committing fraud.  This is also the reason the
American Dream coalition is filing a lawsuit against the state of
Oklahoma over HB 1804 -- because it promises to be the toughest, most
effective means of preventing illegals from getting benefits and
holding jobs.

So the battle is joined.  I read somewhere else that Microsoft has
retained a lobbying firm to press Congress for unlimited H1-B visas,
and there is a bill on the floor to give La Raza millions of dollars.
The enemy is active.  We need to gird ourselves and engage them.

Just another side note on this.  Any attempt by towns or states to
solve problems with illegal immigration lately has been challenged in
court with the argument that only the federal government can do
anything about it, even though congress has recognized the need for
lower jurisdictions to cooperate and assist the federal government in
enforcing immigration law.

Now the federal government is trying to do something.  Of course, it
is too little, too late, and there is reason to doubt the current
administration's motives and sincerity.  Regardless, the ACLU is still
trying to stop it.  Whether it is a town, a state, or the federal
government, they try to stop anyone from doing anything whatsoever to
limit illegal immigration and the rampant fraud, identity theft, and
other crimes associated with it.

Good post by Iconoclast but it is not complete.; Article in todays
Washington paper, that the new rules to go into effect 10 Sep will
Require any employer of any employee who has a  &quot;no-match&quot; SSN to
Terminate that employee in 90 days Or the employer will face Criminal
Penalties!!

I also refer to this new regulation in another thread.

That's what the telemarketers said when the no-call list went into
effect -- it would trigger a recession because they couldn't interrupt
people's dinner to try and sell them time shares or get them to switch
their long distance service.

The government has been derelict in its functions, and things are
building to a much worse disaster than you can imagine if we don't get
a handle on mass illegal immigration and turn it around.  The economy
is not the absolute end-all and be-all for everything.  Most people
think that there is a valid, rational purpose behind the laws we make,
and if those laws continue to be widely flaunted for the sake of
greed, we won't have anything.

&gt;&gt;  This once a day Google Alert is brought to you by Google.

&gt;Thanks for the information.  I wasn't expecting it, but I guess it
&gt;should be no surprise.  Here's the link to the ACLU story:

&gt; http://www.aclu.org/immigrants/workplace/31494prs20070829.html

&gt;The ostensible reason the ACLU gives for trying to block the sending
&gt;of no-match letters to employers is to protect people who may get
&gt;terminated because of innaccuracies in the government database.  The
&gt;real reason for their action is that the ACLU wants to protect
&gt;illegals who are committing fraud.  This is also the reason the
&gt;American Dream coalition is filing a lawsuit against the state of
&gt;Oklahoma over HB 1804 -- because it promises to be the toughest, most
&gt;effective means of preventing illegals from getting benefits and
&gt;holding jobs.

&gt;So the battle is joined.  I read somewhere else that Microsoft has
&gt;retained a lobbying firm to press Congress for unlimited H1-B visas,
&gt;and there is a bill on the floor to give La Raza millions of dollars.
&gt;The enemy is active.  We need to gird ourselves and engage them.

I agree 100 percent.  Excellent observations and comments.

&gt;&gt;  This once a day Google Alert is brought to you by Google.

&gt;Just another side note on this.  Any attempt by towns or states to
&gt;solve problems with illegal immigration lately has been challenged in
&gt;court with the argument that only the federal government can do
&gt;anything about it, even though congress has recognized the need for
&gt;lower jurisdictions to cooperate and assist the federal government in
&gt;enforcing immigration law.

&gt;Now the federal government is trying to do something.  Of course, it
&gt;is too little, too late, and there is reason to doubt the current
&gt;administration's motives and sincerity.  Regardless, the ACLU is still
&gt;trying to stop it.  Whether it is a town, a state, or the federal
&gt;government, they try to stop anyone from doing anything whatsoever to
&gt;limit illegal immigration and the rampant fraud, identity theft, and
&gt;other crimes associated with it.
