Hi,

My wife and I did our ISP when we were 5 months pregnant. Today our son is a year old.

In my opinion, it is the best course a couple can ever do for their child and themselves ( as parents ). It taught us so much more than we imagined. In my understanding, the ISP is based on our ancient Vedic principals + the latest scientific developments.

The course is actually worth 55 lacs IF you listen to  what they teach and do the home play ( others call it home work) and follow through on their instructions.

I have come across  a lot of parents who find spending 20 minutes with their child to do their home play &quot;impractical&quot;. They don’t think twice before whiling away their time in front of TV or at parties.. don’t do the ISP if you belong to that category. Do it only if you are committed to your child's and most importantly, YOUR OWN development.

Regards,

Viren

This  is  Great   Course   and  must  for  every  parent.

Just  do  what   is  told  to  you  for  9  weeks.

Bond  between  my  Child  and  me   has    increased  greatly.

Intelligence    of   my  child  has   also   increased.

We   do   not  understand  music  but  my   Child  does.

If  money  is  the  problem,   there   are  ISP   classes  going  on  for
Less  money   and  Free   also  for  NGO   and  Municipal  school  teachers.
You  can  attend  any  of  that  Batch   But   you  must  do  it.

Hi,

the course is excellent and every parent must do it.

it is right time to do the course for parents having kids up to 5 years.

by these course you can creat strong bonding between you &amp; your child.

there is huge amount of deep knoledge and technics covers all part of our child's growth.

talking about advantages, 2hrs are lees for me to discuss about.

about fees, at 1st look, little higher side, but compairing to the advantages i realised, the amt. is just nothing.
