I don't mean to drag this into a huge debate with flaming and such but I am
curious as to why the consensus here is that desexing your cat in great and
humane, makes them better pets and such, but when the subject turns to
declawing, people believe that it is brutal mutilation.

They are both relatively simple surgeries and can have risks involved (the
anesthetic alone is a risk), the cat hates having any of the parts removed,
and the cat generally recovers in a few days to a couple weeks. I've read
the anti-declawing websites and find them to be a little biased, most
knowledgeable veterinarians dislike having the declawing procedure done but
believe the cats will be better off as a better pet that isn't destructive
and causing frustrations. If the owners are happy, the pet will be happy.
If the owners are unhappy, the pet can be abandoned or put asleep.

I guess the point to make is that both surgeries are a form of mutilation,
but are usually routine and make for a happier home (especially strictly
indoor cats).

imagine functioning without them. How do you think it would feel?

You cannot compare it to a desexing operation. Millions of women around
the world every year have hysterectomies. They all live happy and healthy
lives afterwards. How many people would go on happily without any knuckles
on either hand? And sometimes the first joint of the toes as well?

come out in ten days) and males within 24 hours. For early age neutering

can be charged with animal cruelty if they perform the surgery.

There are also many *good* reasons to desex a cat including:

1. Reduction in the number of litters produced. You may say &quot;I keep my
cat in so it won't get pregnant&quot; - you haven't had a cat in season! They
will do *anything* to get out! You may also say &quot;I have homes for any
kittens I produce&quot; - that just means four or five kittens from the RSPCA
are going to be euthanaised because you've produced four or five more.

2. Reduction in the incidence of uterine and mammory cancers in females
and testicular cancer in males. These cancers are found almost exclusively
in intact cats.

3. Reduction in the risk of contracting sexually transmitted diseases
such as FeLV (Feline Leukaemia Virus), FIV (Feline Immunodeficiency Virus)
and Chlamydia. If the cat can't mate, they can't contract these diseases
(there is some evidence that FIV can be contracted though bites, see
below).

4. Reduction in the number of fights that the cat will get into. Males
will fight males to get to a female and females and males will fight during
the sex act. This can lead to bites and scratches that can cause disease
(see above) or become infected and kill the cat.

Now let us compare these benefits of desexing with the benefits of
declawing.

1. Ahhhh, there are none.

Are these enough reasons for you to consider that perhaps declawing and
desexing should not be placed in the same catagory?

Good post Vicki.

On the subject of desexing, all of my cats are spayed/neutered. None have
suffered ANY ill effects. In fact, a couple of the females were tearing
round fit to burst their stitches as soon as they got home. One tom was a
little bothered for a couple of days, the other not at all.

Now, as to declawing, I replied to a previous post, the transcript of the
whole post being as follows below (please read from the bottom up). I know
I'd much prefer carpets and furniture that resemble worn out pincushions and
happy cats, than declaw them. Isn't this part of the fun of having cats ?

Transcript follows :-

I had no idea it was THAT bad. I'm even more against it now. Thanks for the
information. I hope that people who are considering declawing read this and
see just how much suffereing they will cause.

&gt; Right!
&gt; The nail is actually extended directly from the bone itself. In fact it
is
&gt; not too uncommon for vets who do not cut enough of the bone off to have
the
&gt; claw start growing back. The problem is it grow through the skin that has
&gt; healed OVER the cut off part of the toe. When this happens it almost
always
&gt; results in severe infection and ultimately leads the kitty back to get
&gt; de-clawed all over again to stop the infection.

&gt; The other problem with declawing is the kitty supports much of it's weight
&gt; with the claw part of the toe. Just like you and I extend a significant
&gt; portion of our weight onto out toes when we walk. Cats do the same thing
&gt; but their claws are their toes. After de-clawing the entire posture of
the
&gt; cat is changed to an unnatural form. This often leads to back, leg and
hip
&gt; problems later in life because the cat has tried to compensate by
adjusting
&gt; itself to an unnatural walk and stance.

&gt; One other problem is a cat needs to stretch it's back and legs almost
every
&gt; day. You've seen your cat when it first wakes up arch his back real
sharply
&gt; upward, then almost as sharply downward. While they are doing this their
&gt; claws are anchored into whatever they are standing on. If they do not
have
&gt; claws they cannot anchor themselves. This seriously reduces the amount of
&gt; stretching they can do. This also often leads to problems later in life.

&gt;&gt; also, technically -from what i've read- it's more like chopping off
&gt;&gt; your finger tips since the claw is connected to the bone (right?)

No, the point is one is actually better for their health,
the other is if not worse for their health later,
a pointless maiming -- done by people too lazy to train
their cats properly. Cats don't have to be destructive.
You don't make the animal suffer and pay for what it can't
help when its sheer laziness on the human's part.

As far as &quot;people will abandon&quot; pets they aren't happy with...
those are the people who are supposed to be adult enough not
to get a pet in the first place. Its common adult knowledge.
If you take on a pet, you take it on for life. You don't justify
maiming an animal because a particular
person is too-self centered and uncaring from the start to assess
whether they are truly in a postition to take on an animal or not.

A person that can't be bothered to train a cat not to do damage
with their claws shouldn't have a cat. Down the line it will just
be something else they &quot;don't have the time for&quot;.

I believe that getting my females neutered was the right thing to do. If
they were to have kittens they would have to go through the birth naturally
(if you are a woman you will know the pain this involves although we can
have pain relief) There is also a chance of them dying. It is a very
stressful time for females to have kittens. I would not be able to have a
litter of kittens in my house so I would rather not put them through that
pain and suffering only to take their babies away.
Declawing I had never heard of until I used this newsgroup and am disgusted
at why people would want to take away their cats one way to defend
themselves. There are ways to stop your cats destroying furniture (although
if you don't want them to scratch you sofas or walls, dont declaw them, just
don't get a cat in the first place!!) My two females do not scratch my
walls, carpets or furniture anymore but even if they did I would not get
them declawed.
I had them neutered for their own protection and safety, declawing your cats
would be for the owners own selfish reasons

"/> Declawing is, by definition,
1. Mayhem: The permanent maiming or mutilating of an indivudual, rendering
that indivudual partly or wholly defenseless;
2 Dismemberment: To cut, tear, or pull off the limbs or part;
3. Mutilate: To deprive of a limb or an essential part; cripple;
4. Disjoint: To take apart at the joints;
5. Disfigure: To mar or spoil the appearance or shape of;
6. Deform: To spoil the natural form of.

Declawing fits the strict definition of the words &quot;assault and battery&quot; and
&quot;mayhem&quot; because the amputations are performed on an indivudual without the
consent of, or any benefit to, that indivudual (the cat).

"/> A happier home for whom? Surely not the cat. I don't consider removing
major organs and severing bones, disjointing and dismembering a cat
&quot;routine&quot;.

Since you obviously have no idea of what's involved in declawing, I'll
explain it to you - then tell me if you still consider it &quot;simple&quot; or
&quot;routine&quot;:

&quot;The claw is extended by pushing up under the footpad or by grasping it with
Allis tissue forceps. A scalpel blade is used to sharply dissect between the
second and third phalanx over the top of the ungual crest . The distal
interphalangeal joint is disarticulated (disjointed), and the deep digital
flexor tendon is incised (severed). The digital footpad, is not incised. If
a nail
trimmer is used, the ring of the instrument is placed in the groove between
the second phalanx and the ungual crest. The blade is positioned just in
front of the footpad. The blade is pushed through the soft tissues over the
flexor process. With the ring of the nail trimmer in position behind the
ungual crest, the blade is released just slightly so that traction applied
to the claw causes the flexor process to slip out and above the blade. At
this point, the flexor tendon can be incised and disarticulation of the
joint (disjointing) completed. Both techniques effectively remove the entire
third phalanx. If a larger segment of the third phalanx is left, it should
be dissected out with a scalpel blade. A surgeon's knot of absorbable suture
material is sometimes used to decrease hemorrhage and to act as a &quot;guiding
suture&quot; for second intention wound healing in large cats. &quot; Slatter D;

The following is a clinical report published in the journal of Veterinary
Surgery:

Feline Onychectomy at a Teaching Institution: A
Retrospective Study of 163 Cases.

Tobias KS
Department of Veterinary Clinical Sciences,
Washington State University, College of Veterinary Medicine,
Pullman 99164-6610.

&quot;One hundred sixty-three cats underwent onychectomy from January 1985 to
November 1992.
Fifty percent of the cats had one or more complications immediately after
surgery. Early postoperative complications
included pain (38.1%), hemorrhage (31.9%), lameness (26.9%), swelling
(6.3%), or non-weight-bearing( 5.6%).

Follow-up was available in 121 cats;

19.8% developed complications after release.
Late postoperative complications included infection (11.6%), regrowth
(7.4%), P2 protrusion (1.7%), palmagrade stance
(1.7%), and prolonged, intermittent lameness (0.8%)&quot;.

Comparison of Effects of Elective Tenectomy or Onychectomy in Cats.

Jankowski AJ, Brown DC, Duval J, Gregor TP, Strine LE, Ksiazek LM, Ott AH
Department of Clinical Studies, Veterinary Teaching Hospital,
School of Veterinary Medicine, University of Pennsylvania,
Philadelphia 19104, USA.

&quot;OBJECTIVE: To compare short- and long-term complications after Tenectomy of
the deep digital flexor tendons or
onychectomy.
ANIMALS: 20 cats undergoing Tenectomy and 18 cats undergoing onychectomy.
PROCEDURE: Cats undergoing
Tenectomy or onychectomy were monitored for a minimum of 5 months to enable
comparison of type and frequency of
complications.Type and frequency of complications did not differ between
procedures.
CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Owners should be aware of the high complication rate
for both procedures.&quot;

The Cat Fanciers' Association unanimously approved this guidance statement
on the declawing of cats:
&quot;CFA perceives the declawing of cats (onychectomy ) and the severing of
digital tendons (tendonectomy) to be elective surgical procedures which are
without benefit to the cat. Because of post operative discomfort or pain,
and potential future behavioral or physical effects, CFA disapproves of
declawing or tendonectomy surgery.&quot;

Dr. Nicholas Dodman, Professor of Behavioral Pharmacology and Director of
the Behavior Clinic at Tufts University School of Veterinary Medicine and
internationally known specialist in domestic animal behavioral research,
explains declawing:

&quot;The inhumanity of the procedure is clearly demonstrated by the nature of
cats' recovery from anesthesia following the surgery. Unlike routine
recoveries, including recovery from neutering surgeries, which are fairly
peaceful, declawing
surgery results in cats bouncing off the walls of the recovery cage because
of excruciating pain. Cats that are more stoic huddle in the corner of the
recovery cage, immobilized in a state of helplessness, presumably by
overwhelming pain.
Declawing fits the dictionary definition of mutilation to a tee. Words such
as deform, disfigure, disjoint, and dismember all apply to this surgery.
Partial digital amputation is so horrible that it has been employed for
torture of prisoners of war, and in veterinary medicine, the clinical
procedure serves as model of severe pain for testing the efficacy of
analgesic drugs. Even though analgesic drugs can be used postoperatively,
they rarely are, and their effects are incomplete and transient anyway, so
sooner or later the pain will emerge.&quot;

Educate yourself about declawing - here's a site with photos and diagrams
from veterinary literature - and not from &quot;biased&quot; sources.

On the myths of declawing:

1)I've never seen a declawed cat have a problem with balance (and I've seen
quite a few)

2)Complications with declawing are so rare that I've never even heard of one
from anyone I've ever known that has had a cat or even any vets I've talked
to. They are probably just as rare as complications with spaying or
neutering. Complications due to anesthesia required in he operations are
the most common and I've never heard of that either (besides from a vet who
said it's happened once). Talk to your vet and find out f he or she has
ever seen a complication due to declawing.

3)Cats can still stretch if they've been declawed and they can live just as
long as those who haven't been declawed.

4)Cats don't live a life of depression just because they don't have claws.

&gt; Good post Vicki.

&gt; On the subject of desexing, all of my cats are spayed/neutered. None have
&gt; suffered ANY ill effects. In fact, a couple of the females were tearing
&gt; round fit to burst their stitches as soon as they got home. One tom was a
&gt; little bothered for a couple of days, the other not at all.

&gt; Now, as to declawing, I replied to a previous post, the transcript of the
&gt; whole post being as follows below (please read from the bottom up). I know
&gt; I'd much prefer carpets and furniture that resemble worn out pincushions
and
&gt; happy cats, than declaw them. Isn't this part of the fun of having cats ?

&gt; Transcript follows :-

&gt; I had no idea it was THAT bad. I'm even more against it now. Thanks for
the
&gt; information. I hope that people who are considering declawing read this
and
&gt; see just how much suffereing they will cause.

&gt;&gt; Right!
&gt;&gt; The nail is actually extended directly from the bone itself. In fact it
&gt; is
&gt;&gt; not too uncommon for vets who do not cut enough of the bone off to have
&gt; the
&gt;&gt; claw start growing back. The problem is it grow through the skin that
has
&gt;&gt; healed OVER the cut off part of the toe. When this happens it almost
&gt; always
&gt;&gt; results in severe infection and ultimately leads the kitty back to get
&gt;&gt; de-clawed all over again to stop the infection.

&gt;&gt; The other problem with declawing is the kitty supports much of it's
weight
&gt;&gt; with the claw part of the toe. Just like you and I extend a significant
&gt;&gt; portion of our weight onto out toes when we walk. Cats do the same
thing
&gt;&gt; but their claws are their toes. After de-clawing the entire posture of
&gt; the
&gt;&gt; cat is changed to an unnatural form. This often leads to back, leg and
&gt; hip
&gt;&gt; problems later in life because the cat has tried to compensate by
&gt; adjusting
&gt;&gt; itself to an unnatural walk and stance.

&gt;&gt; One other problem is a cat needs to stretch it's back and legs almost
&gt; every
&gt;&gt; day. You've seen your cat when it first wakes up arch his back real
&gt; sharply
&gt;&gt; upward, then almost as sharply downward. While they are doing this
their
&gt;&gt; claws are anchored into whatever they are standing on. If they do not
&gt; have
&gt;&gt; claws they cannot anchor themselves. This seriously reduces the amount
of
&gt;&gt; stretching they can do. This also often leads to problems later in
life.

&gt;&gt;&gt; also, technically -from what i've read- it's more like chopping off
&gt;&gt;&gt; your finger tips since the claw is connected to the bone (right?)

I

&gt;&gt; Then you are asking entirely the wrong question. My first instinct was
&gt;&gt; that you are a troll, simply here to start a flame war. Then I
wondered,
&gt;&gt; what if you aren't? What if you are genuine? Then you need to hear
both
&gt;&gt; sides of the story.

&gt;&gt; You won't hear any flames from me, but you will hear the truth and
&gt;&gt; sometimes the truth hurts.

&gt;&gt;&gt;am curious as to why the consensus here is that desexing your cat in
&gt;&gt;&gt;great and humane, makes them better pets and such, but when the subject
&gt;&gt;&gt;turns to declawing, people believe that it is brutal mutilation.

&gt;&gt;&gt;They are both relatively simple surgeries and can have risks involved

&gt;&gt; First mistake. Declawing is *not* a simple surgery. It involves the
&gt;&gt; removal of not only the claw but the entire first knuckle. Take your
hand
&gt;&gt; off the keyboard for a moment. Look at the fingers on your right hand.
&gt;&gt; Now imagine someone cutting them *all* off at the first knuckle. Now
&gt;&gt; imagine functioning without them. How do you think it would feel?

&gt;&gt; You cannot compare it to a desexing operation. Millions of women around
&gt;&gt; the world every year have hysterectomies. They all live happy and
healthy
&gt;&gt; lives afterwards. How many people would go on happily without any
&gt; knuckles
&gt;&gt; on either hand? And sometimes the first joint of the toes as well?

&gt;&gt;&gt;(the anesthetic alone is a risk), the cat hates having any of the parts
&gt;&gt;&gt;removed, and the cat generally recovers in a few days to a couple
weeks.

&gt;&gt; Second mistake. If the desexing surgery is done at a fairly young age,
&gt;&gt; most females recover within a couple of days (except for the stitches
&gt; which
&gt;&gt; come out in ten days) and males within 24 hours. For early age
neutering
&gt;&gt; (at about 8 weeks) the recovery time is even less. Declawing can take
up
&gt;&gt; to six weeks for full recovery.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I've read the anti-declawing websites and find them to be a little
&gt;&gt;&gt;biased, most knowledgeable veterinarians dislike having the declawing
&gt;&gt;&gt;procedure done but believe the cats will be better off as a better pet
&gt;&gt;&gt;that isn't destructive and causing frustrations. If the owners are

&gt;&gt; Third mistake. It is well documented that cats without claws can become
&gt;&gt; habitual biters. In fact a cat without claws will be much *more*
&gt;&gt; frustrated because they can't do the things that come naturally to it -
&gt;&gt; like scratching on a scratching post or digging comfortably in it's
litter
&gt;&gt; tray.

&gt;&gt;&gt;happy, the pet will be happy. If the owners are unhappy, the pet can be
&gt;&gt;&gt;abandoned or put asleep.

&gt;&gt;&gt;I guess the point to make is that both surgeries are a form of
&gt;&gt;&gt;mutilation, but are usually routine and make for a happier home
&gt;&gt;&gt;(especially strictly indoor cats).

&gt;&gt; Fourth mistake. Declawing is *never* routine, even in the USA where it
is
&gt;&gt; common. The majority of moral Vets will only do it in exceptional
&gt;&gt; circumstances. In Australia (where I live) declawing is banned and Vets
&gt;&gt; can be charged with animal cruelty if they perform the surgery.

&gt;&gt; There are also many *good* reasons to desex a cat including:

&gt;&gt; 1. Reduction in the number of litters produced. You may say &quot;I keep
my
&gt;&gt; cat in so it won't get pregnant&quot; - you haven't had a cat in season!
They
&gt;&gt; will do *anything* to get out! You may also say &quot;I have homes for any
&gt;&gt; kittens I produce&quot; - that just means four or five kittens from the RSPCA
&gt;&gt; are going to be euthanaised because you've produced four or five more.

&gt;&gt; 2. Reduction in the incidence of uterine and mammory cancers in
females
&gt;&gt; and testicular cancer in males. These cancers are found almost
&gt; exclusively
&gt;&gt; in intact cats.

&gt;&gt; 3. Reduction in the risk of contracting sexually transmitted diseases
&gt;&gt; such as FeLV (Feline Leukaemia Virus), FIV (Feline Immunodeficiency
Virus)
&gt;&gt; and Chlamydia. If the cat can't mate, they can't contract these
diseases
&gt;&gt; (there is some evidence that FIV can be contracted though bites, see
&gt;&gt; below).

&gt;&gt; 4. Reduction in the number of fights that the cat will get into.
Males
&gt;&gt; will fight males to get to a female and females and males will fight
&gt; during
&gt;&gt; the sex act. This can lead to bites and scratches that can cause
disease
&gt;&gt; (see above) or become infected and kill the cat.

&gt;&gt; Now let us compare these benefits of desexing with the benefits of
&gt;&gt; declawing.

&gt;&gt; 1. Ahhhh, there are none.

&gt;&gt; Are these enough reasons for you to consider that perhaps declawing and
&gt;&gt; desexing should not be placed in the same catagory?

an operation to the genetals is at least as painful as an operation to the
feet.

seen drapery, carpet, or furniture ruined by a cat biting it.

&gt; Fourth mistake. Declawing is *never* routine, even in the USA where it is
&gt; common. The majority of moral Vets will only do it in exceptional
&gt; circumstances. In Australia (where I live) declawing is banned and Vets
&gt; can be charged with animal cruelty if they perform the surgery.

"/> In the USA it is so common that some landlords require their cats to be
dclawed before they can rent an apartment, some vets offer it in a package

millions of times a years, and probably more than a dozen times a year by
each vet, is definitely is routine and complications are so rare that I have
never heard of case where a complication occurred by anyone I've known who's
ever had a cat.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Now let us compare these benefits of desexing with the benefits of
&gt; declawing.

"/> I think you missed my point in the previous post so I'll reiterate. A
declawed cat in most cases will make for a happier home (if your cat isn't
ruining your furniture, drapery, carpet, blankets, beds, etc that is great,
but most of the time they will). If the owners are happy, the cat will be
happy from many factors (better care, more attention, toys, better food,
bonding, etc.). If the owners are unhappy, the cat is very likely to be
resented, abandoned, given to the animal shelter, or put to death. Don't
tell me that a cat has never been abandoned or put to death over ruining the
furniture becase last I checked behavioral problems were the #1 reason for
abandoning cats.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Are these enough reasons for you to consider that perhaps declawing and
&gt; desexing should not be placed in the same catagory?

"/> There's one more reason I've been considering declawing my cat. Clipping
her claws seems to reslove the problem for a week or two but every time I go
to clip her claws she resents it so much, throws such a fit, and is
anguished so badly that it would almost be better just to remove them all at
once and get it over with than to have a lifetime of clipping them with all
the pain and angiush.

&gt;You cannot compare it to a desexing operation. Millions of women around
&gt;the world every year have hysterectomies. They all live happy and healthy
&gt;lives afterwards. How many people would go on happily without any knuckles
&gt;on either hand? And sometimes the first joint of the toes as well?

"/> I do get tired of this argument. I guess if I had to choose
between having ovaries &amp; uterus removed versus fingertips removed,
I'd choose the former, but it would be close. Hysterectomy,
particularly when the ovaries are also removed (which is what
happens to a spayed cat) is NOT trivial in a human. Women who
have their ovaries removed, especially if they are premenopausal,
often have to take hormones to stay healthy, and it's still not
easy. For example, I know someone who had this done and she is
constantly wrestling with her cholesterol levels, which weren't
a problem before -- a common effect. Osteoporosis is a risk too.
Few humans would accept this surgery unless (as in my friend's
case) there is an overriding, *immediate* medical reason to do it.

I make the point about *immediate* because it's true for humans
that we wouldn't get much ovarian cancer or testicular cancer if
we all had our ovaries or testicles removed at an early age, but
that doesn't mean we should do that. I'm not volunteering, that's
for sure.

Now, cats are pretty different from humans in this area, and I
can only take it on faith from my vets and others that it's less
of a problem in cats than it is in people. I never heard of a cat
getting osteoporosis, for example!

I also think it's unfair for people having this discussion to
pretend that there's no benefit to the human in having the pet
desexed. If scratching is just what cats do, and you should be
able to accept that if you're going to adopt a cat, why doesn't
that apply to intact male cats spraying, and females calling?
I personally think that it *does* apply -- that if desexing the
cat had no benefits to the cat, it would probably be wrong to do
it for only those reasons. (And in that case, I wouldn't have a
cat, because I wouldn't tolerate having my house sprayed.)

Now don't anybody misinterpret the above. I am opposed to
declawing, and I believe pets should be spayed and neutered.
But it weakens the argument if we pretend that it's *all* for
the cat's benefit. And comparing spaying to a human having
ovaries and uterus removed is probably misleading, in that it
appears to have more health benefits than disadvantages for a
cat, where the opposite is true for humans unless there is a
diagnosed problem such as endometriosis or cancer.

I think the reason these issues (and some others, like indoor vs.
outdoor) are so contentious is because at the root of it, it comes
down to the basic issue of whether it is right for humans to keep
animals for companionship or other purposes, when it means that the
animal's life is changed in some ways that may not be entirely to
the animal's benefit, e.g. loss of freedom (though the changes may
be balanced by improvements to other areas of the animal's life).
I think that's something that everyone has to decide for herself
or himself. I also think that once you know how you feel on this
basic issue, you'll find your positions on indoor/outdoor, desexing,
and declawing will flow naturally from that basis.

(And just to avoid any overly-polarized arguments, I don't think
it's black-and-white -- for example, I personally feel ok about
keeping cats, and in a different living situation would keep a dog,
but have doubts about riding horses and keeping birds in cages.)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Good post indeed, but I disagree in almost every place. I'll tell you

"/> why.
&lt;snip&gt;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I don't understand why someone can't ask a simple question and get a
&gt; straight answer without a huge flame war.

"/> Because declawing is a very touchy subject around here, to say the least,
and with very good reason. To someone who is completely unaware of how
cruel and unnecessary declawing is, it might come as a surprise to see
people on this newsgroup come out with such force against it. We can seem
downright fanatical or irrational in condemning it, at least to someone who
sees it as a simple matter of removing only the claws.

Phil P. has probably already provided a link to an excellent page on
declawing; the sources he cites are from veterinary journals, and it is
important to read it and understand exactly what declawing entails. It is
also important to understand how completely *unnecessary* the procedure is,
and that there are far more effective and humane ways of dealing with cat
behavior.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; First mistake. Declawing is *not* a simple surgery. It involves the
&gt;&gt; removal of not only the claw but the entire first knuckle. Take your
hand
&gt;&gt; off the keyboard for a moment. Look at the fingers on your right hand.
&gt;&gt; Now imagine someone cutting them *all* off at the first knuckle. Now
&gt;&gt; imagine functioning without them. How do you think it would feel?
&gt; Taking off the first knuckle sounds pretty simple to me. A bit more
simple
&gt; than cutting into the abdomen, cutting into the fallopian tubes, and
cutting
&gt; them off. Neutering seems like the simplest of the operations but I'm
sure
&gt; an operation to the genetals is at least as painful as an operation to the
&gt; feet.

"/> I've had a tubal ligation, and I know women who have had to have
hysterectomies. Given the choice between performing *ten separate
amputations* in order to remove the tips of our fingers and thumbs or having
abdominal surgery for valid health reasons, which do you really think we
might have sprung for?

&lt;snipped&gt;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; You can't compare losing knuckles in a human being to losing knuckles in a
&gt; cat. Humans need their hands and fingers for most things they do (eating,
&gt; drinking, driving a car, keyboard, remote control). A cat doesn't need
&gt; their fingers for any of this. I've seen people who've lost fingers in
&gt; accidents, and even as important as fingers are to human beings, they
still
&gt; live happy lives. Same with many people in wheelchairs.

"/> Cats do need their claws, just as humans need their fingers. If they didn't
need them, they wouldn't have them. Cats keep the muscles in their legs,
back and shoulders in shape by clawing--the stretching and pulling they
engage in while clawing keeps the muscles toned. They mark their
territories by clawing, not simply with visual evidence, but also with
scent--there are scent glands in their paws that can only release their odor
through clawing.

If a cat can't mark its territory by clawing, it will very often resort to
urinating. I have a friend who got a wonderful cat from the local animal
shelter; after her previous owner had her declawed she was still dumped
because she began peeing on the furniture that was supposed to be saved by
having her claws removed.

Claws are also there for defense--if a declawed cat gets outside it is
automatically at a great diasdvantage, not only agains other cats, but
raccoons and other animals as well. They don't even have the option of
racing up a tree to get away from danger. Unless you live in an urban
high-rise apartment with very controlled access, there is *always* a chance
that the cat will get out. If you're lucky, you'll be home and able to get
her back inside.

The argument that a cat &quot;doesn't need its claws&quot; is based in ignorance of
cat behavior. Unfortunately, too many people get cats and never make an
effort to find out what makes that animal tick. The most effective way of
dealing with difficulties with *any* animal is to take the time to
understand the animal. Cats are not a mystery. There are reasons why they
do what they do, and when you work with their own innate behaviors rather
than fight against them or resort to quick and brutal &quot;fixes&quot; like declawing
they will respond.

As for humans who lose fingers or limbs, they have ways of adapting,
including specialized prostheses and tools developed to make their lives
easier. They are able to effectively communicate with other humans, who can
then render assistance. A cat has none of those options.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; Second mistake. If the desexing surgery is done at a fairly young age,
&gt;&gt; most females recover within a couple of days (except for the stitches
&gt; which
&gt;&gt; come out in ten days) and males within 24 hours. For early age
neutering
&gt;&gt; (at about 8 weeks) the recovery time is even less. Declawing can take
up
&gt;&gt; to six weeks for full recovery.
&gt; This is what I mean by biased. Yes, declawing can take up to 8 full weeks
&gt; for recovery, in rare cases but most are on their feet within a couple
days
&gt; and have fully recovered by ten days. Spaying and neutering can take 8
full
&gt; weeks to recover too, in rare cases.

"/> The problem I have with your argument here is that it is comparing two
procedures that have nothing to do with each other, and are performed for
completely different reasons. Spay and neuter surgery is primarily
performed to keep cats from producing unwanted kittens. There are
behavioral changes that accompany the removal of the sex organs, and yes,
these are desirable, but they actually *benefit* the health of the cat in
the long run. Declawing is performed strictly to prevent the cat from
damaging furniture--there is no other reason to do it. It provides
absolutely no health benefit to the cat, only convenience to the owner.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; They *can* become habitual biters, and for the most part they probably do
&gt; bite more often. But it is much better than having you arms scraped up
and
&gt; bleeding from claw marks which is more likely to happen if your cat isn't
&gt; declawed than being biten badly if your cat is declawed. Also, I've never
&gt; seen drapery, carpet, or furniture ruined by a cat biting it.

"/> What are you *doing* to the cat that would cause you to have &quot;arms scraped
up and bleeding from claw marks?&quot; I have five cats, and it is very rare for
me to get scratched; it usually only happens if something startles a cat
while I am holding it. And as for bites being better--have you ever been
bitten (and I mean really bitten, not just nipped) by a cat? You can get
one hell of a nasty infection from a single deep cat bite, the sort that
lands you in the hospital with IV antibiotics.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; In the USA it is so common that some landlords require their cats to be
&gt; dclawed before they can rent an apartment,

"/> That is because they don't want their property damaged, not because it is
good for the cat. It completely overlooks the fact that a cat trained well
to a scratching post will not damage carpet or drapes. It has nothing to do
with what is humane or right, only the landlord's mistaken perception of
what will work in his own self-interest. A declawed cat can still pee all
over the place; it solves nothing.

have
&gt; never heard of case where a complication occurred by anyone I've known

&gt; ever had a cat.

"/> Declawing is also quite profitable. The same economics that leads plastic
surgeons to perform excessive or risky procedures on human patients, simply
because they want it, drives vets who declaw. As long as there are people
who get cats and are too lazy or ignorant to approach clawing from a
behavioral perspective, there will be vets who will perform declawing
surgery--until it is outlawed entirely. Some of the vets who perform
declawing, or offer it as part of a &quot;new kitten package&quot; never tell their
customers exactly what the procedure involves; if they did, they would
perform far fewer of them. There are also a *lot* of vets who will not
perform the procedure at all, including the one I chose for my cats.

Declawing is illegal, in fact, in many European countries, as well as
Australia and New Zealand; it has been acknowledged as cruel and barbaric.

And yes, there are often significant complications. When you perform ten
separate amputations at one shot, the chances of complications are very
high. You may not know anyone whose cat has had complications, but exactly
how many declawed cats do you know? And would you want to risk the kinds of
complications that can develop on your own cat?

most common complaint. Declawing a cat does not assure it a happy, secure

By &quot;quite a few&quot; you must mean 2 or 3. Don't preach about somthing you've

&gt;&gt; Good post Vicki.

&gt;&gt; On the subject of desexing, all of my cats are spayed/neutered. None
have
&gt;&gt; suffered ANY ill effects. In fact, a couple of the females were tearing
&gt;&gt; round fit to burst their stitches as soon as they got home. One tom was
a
&gt;&gt; little bothered for a couple of days, the other not at all.

&gt;&gt; Now, as to declawing, I replied to a previous post, the transcript of
the
&gt;&gt; whole post being as follows below (please read from the bottom up). I
know
&gt;&gt; I'd much prefer carpets and furniture that resemble worn out pincushions
&gt; and
&gt;&gt; happy cats, than declaw them. Isn't this part of the fun of having cats
?

&gt;&gt; Transcript follows :-

&gt;&gt; I had no idea it was THAT bad. I'm even more against it now. Thanks for
&gt; the
&gt;&gt; information. I hope that people who are considering declawing read this
&gt; and
&gt;&gt; see just how much suffereing they will cause.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Right!
&gt;&gt;&gt; The nail is actually extended directly from the bone itself. In fact
it
&gt;&gt; is
&gt;&gt;&gt; not too uncommon for vets who do not cut enough of the bone off to
have
&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt;&gt; claw start growing back. The problem is it grow through the skin that
&gt; has
&gt;&gt;&gt; healed OVER the cut off part of the toe. When this happens it almost
&gt;&gt; always
&gt;&gt;&gt; results in severe infection and ultimately leads the kitty back to get
&gt;&gt;&gt; de-clawed all over again to stop the infection.

&gt;&gt;&gt; The other problem with declawing is the kitty supports much of it's
&gt; weight
&gt;&gt;&gt; with the claw part of the toe. Just like you and I extend a
significant
&gt;&gt;&gt; portion of our weight onto out toes when we walk. Cats do the same
&gt; thing
&gt;&gt;&gt; but their claws are their toes. After de-clawing the entire posture
of
&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt;&gt; cat is changed to an unnatural form. This often leads to back, leg
and
&gt;&gt; hip
&gt;&gt;&gt; problems later in life because the cat has tried to compensate by
&gt;&gt; adjusting
&gt;&gt;&gt; itself to an unnatural walk and stance.

&gt;&gt;&gt; One other problem is a cat needs to stretch it's back and legs almost
&gt;&gt; every
&gt;&gt;&gt; day. You've seen your cat when it first wakes up arch his back real
&gt;&gt; sharply
&gt;&gt;&gt; upward, then almost as sharply downward. While they are doing this
&gt; their
&gt;&gt;&gt; claws are anchored into whatever they are standing on. If they do not
&gt;&gt; have
&gt;&gt;&gt; claws they cannot anchor themselves. This seriously reduces the
amount
&gt; of
&gt;&gt;&gt; stretching they can do. This also often leads to problems later in
&gt; life.

&gt;&gt;&gt; (John) purred the following:

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I don't mean to drag this into a huge debate with flaming and such
but
&gt; I

&gt;&gt;&gt; Then you are asking entirely the wrong question. My first instinct
was
&gt;&gt;&gt; that you are a troll, simply here to start a flame war. Then I
&gt; wondered,
&gt;&gt;&gt; what if you aren't? What if you are genuine? Then you need to hear
&gt; both
&gt;&gt;&gt; sides of the story.

&gt;&gt;&gt; You won't hear any flames from me, but you will hear the truth and
&gt;&gt;&gt; sometimes the truth hurts.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;am curious as to why the consensus here is that desexing your cat in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;great and humane, makes them better pets and such, but when the
subject
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;turns to declawing, people believe that it is brutal mutilation.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;They are both relatively simple surgeries and can have risks involved

&gt;&gt;&gt; First mistake. Declawing is *not* a simple surgery. It involves the
&gt;&gt;&gt; removal of not only the claw but the entire first knuckle. Take your
&gt; hand
&gt;&gt;&gt; off the keyboard for a moment. Look at the fingers on your right
hand.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Now imagine someone cutting them *all* off at the first knuckle. Now
&gt;&gt;&gt; imagine functioning without them. How do you think it would feel?

&gt;&gt;&gt; You cannot compare it to a desexing operation. Millions of women
around
&gt;&gt;&gt; the world every year have hysterectomies. They all live happy and
&gt; healthy
&gt;&gt;&gt; lives afterwards. How many people would go on happily without any
&gt;&gt; knuckles
&gt;&gt;&gt; on either hand? And sometimes the first joint of the toes as well?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;(the anesthetic alone is a risk), the cat hates having any of the
parts
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;removed, and the cat generally recovers in a few days to a couple
&gt; weeks.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Second mistake. If the desexing surgery is done at a fairly young
age,
&gt;&gt;&gt; most females recover within a couple of days (except for the stitches
&gt;&gt; which
&gt;&gt;&gt; come out in ten days) and males within 24 hours. For early age
&gt; neutering
&gt;&gt;&gt; (at about 8 weeks) the recovery time is even less. Declawing can take
&gt; up
&gt;&gt;&gt; to six weeks for full recovery.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I've read the anti-declawing websites and find them to be a little
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;biased, most knowledgeable veterinarians dislike having the declawing
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;procedure done but believe the cats will be better off as a better
pet
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;that isn't destructive and causing frustrations. If the owners are

&gt;&gt;&gt; Third mistake. It is well documented that cats without claws can
become
&gt;&gt;&gt; habitual biters. In fact a cat without claws will be much *more*
&gt;&gt;&gt; frustrated because they can't do the things that come naturally to
it -
&gt;&gt;&gt; like scratching on a scratching post or digging comfortably in it's
&gt; litter
&gt;&gt;&gt; tray.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;happy, the pet will be happy. If the owners are unhappy, the pet can
be
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;abandoned or put asleep.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I guess the point to make is that both surgeries are a form of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;mutilation, but are usually routine and make for a happier home
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;(especially strictly indoor cats).

&gt;&gt;&gt; Fourth mistake. Declawing is *never* routine, even in the USA where
it
&gt; is
&gt;&gt;&gt; common. The majority of moral Vets will only do it in exceptional
&gt;&gt;&gt; circumstances. In Australia (where I live) declawing is banned and
Vets
&gt;&gt;&gt; can be charged with animal cruelty if they perform the surgery.

&gt;&gt;&gt; There are also many *good* reasons to desex a cat including:

&gt;&gt;&gt; 1. Reduction in the number of litters produced. You may say &quot;I
keep
&gt; my
&gt;&gt;&gt; cat in so it won't get pregnant&quot; - you haven't had a cat in season!
&gt; They
&gt;&gt;&gt; will do *anything* to get out! You may also say &quot;I have homes for any
&gt;&gt;&gt; kittens I produce&quot; - that just means four or five kittens from the
RSPCA
&gt;&gt;&gt; are going to be euthanaised because you've produced four or five more.

&gt;&gt;&gt; 2. Reduction in the incidence of uterine and mammory cancers in
&gt; females
&gt;&gt;&gt; and testicular cancer in males. These cancers are found almost
&gt;&gt; exclusively
&gt;&gt;&gt; in intact cats.

&gt;&gt;&gt; 3. Reduction in the risk of contracting sexually transmitted
diseases
&gt;&gt;&gt; such as FeLV (Feline Leukaemia Virus), FIV (Feline Immunodeficiency
&gt; Virus)
&gt;&gt;&gt; and Chlamydia. If the cat can't mate, they can't contract these
&gt; diseases
&gt;&gt;&gt; (there is some evidence that FIV can be contracted though bites, see
&gt;&gt;&gt; below).

&gt;&gt;&gt; 4. Reduction in the number of fights that the cat will get into.
&gt; Males
&gt;&gt;&gt; will fight males to get to a female and females and males will fight
&gt;&gt; during
&gt;&gt;&gt; the sex act. This can lead to bites and scratches that can cause
&gt; disease
&gt;&gt;&gt; (see above) or become infected and kill the cat.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Now let us compare these benefits of desexing with the benefits of
&gt;&gt;&gt; declawing.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Good post Vicki.

&gt;&gt;&gt; On the subject of desexing, all of my cats are spayed/neutered. None
&gt; have
&gt;&gt;&gt; suffered ANY ill effects. In fact, a couple of the females were
tearing
&gt;&gt;&gt; round fit to burst their stitches as soon as they got home. One tom
was
&gt; a
&gt;&gt;&gt; little bothered for a couple of days, the other not at all.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Now, as to declawing, I replied to a previous post, the transcript of
&gt; the
&gt;&gt;&gt; whole post being as follows below (please read from the bottom up). I
&gt; know
&gt;&gt;&gt; I'd much prefer carpets and furniture that resemble worn out
pincushions
&gt;&gt; and
&gt;&gt;&gt; happy cats, than declaw them. Isn't this part of the fun of having
cats
&gt; ?

&gt;&gt;&gt; Transcript follows :-

&gt;&gt;&gt; I had no idea it was THAT bad. I'm even more against it now. Thanks
for
&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt;&gt; information. I hope that people who are considering declawing read
this
&gt;&gt; and
&gt;&gt;&gt; see just how much suffereing they will cause.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Right!
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The nail is actually extended directly from the bone itself. In
fact
&gt; it
&gt;&gt;&gt; is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; not too uncommon for vets who do not cut enough of the bone off to
&gt; have
&gt;&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; claw start growing back. The problem is it grow through the skin
that
&gt;&gt; has
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; healed OVER the cut off part of the toe. When this happens it
almost
&gt;&gt;&gt; always
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; results in severe infection and ultimately leads the kitty back to
get
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; de-clawed all over again to stop the infection.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The other problem with declawing is the kitty supports much of it's
&gt;&gt; weight
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; with the claw part of the toe. Just like you and I extend a
&gt; significant
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; portion of our weight onto out toes when we walk. Cats do the same
&gt;&gt; thing
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; but their claws are their toes. After de-clawing the entire posture
&gt; of
&gt;&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; cat is changed to an unnatural form. This often leads to back, leg
&gt; and
&gt;&gt;&gt; hip
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; problems later in life because the cat has tried to compensate by
&gt;&gt;&gt; adjusting
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; itself to an unnatural walk and stance.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; One other problem is a cat needs to stretch it's back and legs
almost
&gt;&gt;&gt; every
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; day. You've seen your cat when it first wakes up arch his back real
&gt;&gt;&gt; sharply
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; upward, then almost as sharply downward. While they are doing this
&gt;&gt; their
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; claws are anchored into whatever they are standing on. If they do
not
&gt;&gt;&gt; have
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; claws they cannot anchor themselves. This seriously reduces the
&gt; amount
&gt;&gt; of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; stretching they can do. This also often leads to problems later in
&gt;&gt; life.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; also, technically -from what i've read- it's more like chopping
off
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; your finger tips since the claw is connected to the bone (right?)

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I don't mean to drag this into a huge debate with flaming and such
&gt; but
&gt;&gt; I

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Then you are asking entirely the wrong question. My first instinct
&gt; was
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that you are a troll, simply here to start a flame war. Then I
&gt;&gt; wondered,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; what if you aren't? What if you are genuine? Then you need to hear
&gt;&gt; both
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; sides of the story.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You won't hear any flames from me, but you will hear the truth and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; sometimes the truth hurts.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;am curious as to why the consensus here is that desexing your cat
in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;great and humane, makes them better pets and such, but when the
&gt; subject
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;turns to declawing, people believe that it is brutal mutilation.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;They are both relatively simple surgeries and can have risks
involved

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; First mistake. Declawing is *not* a simple surgery. It involves
the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; removal of not only the claw but the entire first knuckle. Take
your
&gt;&gt; hand
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; off the keyboard for a moment. Look at the fingers on your right
&gt; hand.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Now imagine someone cutting them *all* off at the first knuckle.
Now
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; imagine functioning without them. How do you think it would feel?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You cannot compare it to a desexing operation. Millions of women
&gt; around
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the world every year have hysterectomies. They all live happy and
&gt;&gt; healthy
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; lives afterwards. How many people would go on happily without any
&gt;&gt;&gt; knuckles
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; on either hand? And sometimes the first joint of the toes as well?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;(the anesthetic alone is a risk), the cat hates having any of the
&gt; parts
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;removed, and the cat generally recovers in a few days to a couple
&gt;&gt; weeks.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Second mistake. If the desexing surgery is done at a fairly young
&gt; age,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; most females recover within a couple of days (except for the
stitches
&gt;&gt;&gt; which
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; come out in ten days) and males within 24 hours. For early age
&gt;&gt; neutering
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (at about 8 weeks) the recovery time is even less. Declawing can
take
&gt;&gt; up
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to six weeks for full recovery.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I've read the anti-declawing websites and find them to be a little
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;biased, most knowledgeable veterinarians dislike having the
declawing
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;procedure done but believe the cats will be better off as a better
&gt; pet
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;that isn't destructive and causing frustrations. If the owners are

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Third mistake. It is well documented that cats without claws can
&gt; become
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; habitual biters. In fact a cat without claws will be much *more*
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; frustrated because they can't do the things that come naturally to
&gt; it -
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; like scratching on a scratching post or digging comfortably in it's

Well, by the sound of this and your other posts over the last couple of
days, post you probably *are* a troll ... however ...

Whilst licking their paws in alt.animals.cat on 11 Oct 2000, j ... @wd.net
(John) purred the following:

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Good post indeed, but I disagree in almost every place. I'll tell you
&gt;why.

&gt;&gt; Then you are asking entirely the wrong question. My first instinct
&gt;&gt; was that you are a troll, simply here to start a flame war. Then I
&gt;&gt; wondered, what if you aren't? What if you are genuine? Then you need

&gt;I don't understand why someone can't ask a simple question and get a
&gt;straight answer without a huge flame war.

&gt;&gt; removal of not only the claw but the entire first knuckle. Take your

&gt;&gt; Now imagine functioning without them. How do you think it would
&gt;&gt; feel?
&gt;Taking off the first knuckle sounds pretty simple to me. A bit more
&gt;simple than cutting into the abdomen, cutting into the fallopian tubes,
&gt;and cutting them off. Neutering seems like the simplest of the
&gt;operations but I'm sure an operation to the genetals is at least as
&gt;painful as an operation to the feet.

"/> Did you do what I suggested?? Sure, cats don't use thier paws for typing
or writing - only to WALK!!!!!! A slightly more essential activity than
almost *anything* we humans can use our hand for.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; You cannot compare it to a desexing operation. Millions of women

&gt;knuckles
&gt;&gt; on either hand? And sometimes the first joint of the toes as well?
&gt;You can't compare losing knuckles in a human being to losing knuckles in
&gt;a cat. Humans need their hands and fingers for most things they do
&gt;(eating, drinking, driving a car, keyboard, remote control). A cat
&gt;doesn't need their fingers for any of this. I've seen people who've
&gt;lost fingers in accidents, and even as important as fingers are to human
&gt;beings, they still live happy lives. Same with many people in
&gt;wheelchairs.

"/> Difference being there is a medical reason to lose them. You want to take
your cats claws away for convenience - nothing more. And don't say
desexing is for convenience - I gave in my last post the many, many good
reasons why desexing is for the good of the cat and the good of all the
kittens that he/she might produce if left undesexed.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Second mistake. If the desexing surgery is done at a fairly young

&gt;&gt; neutering (at about 8 weeks) the recovery time is even less.
&gt;&gt; Declawing can take up to six weeks for full recovery.
&gt;This is what I mean by biased. Yes, declawing can take up to 8 full
&gt;weeks for recovery, in rare cases but most are on their feet within a
&gt;couple days and have fully recovered by ten days. Spaying and neutering
&gt;can take 8 full weeks to recover too, in rare cases.

"/> I have been there for the spay/neuter surgery for so many cats I wouldn't
even begin to be able to count them. And not one, *ever* has taken more
than a day or two to recover. I have never seen a declawing surgery (thank
goodness) but I know from my many friends in the States that the recovery
time is very long.

Do you also realise the idiocy of one statement up there? &quot;most are on
their feet within a couple of days&quot; - *any* surgery done simply for
convenience that lays a cat out for a couple of days is disgusting!!!!

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Third mistake. It is well documented that cats without claws can
&gt;&gt; become habitual biters. In fact a cat without claws will be much
&gt;&gt; *more* frustrated because they can't do the things that come naturally
&gt;&gt; to it - like scratching on a scratching post or digging comfortably in
&gt;&gt; it's litter tray.
&gt;They *can* become habitual biters, and for the most part they probably
&gt;do bite more often. But it is much better than having you arms scraped
&gt;up and bleeding from claw marks which is more likely to happen if your
&gt;cat isn't declawed than being biten badly if your cat is declawed.
&gt;Also, I've never seen drapery, carpet, or furniture ruined by a cat
&gt;biting it.

"/> So what is more important - your cats health or your furniture? If you
provide sufficient scratching posts and toys the cats tend to leave the
furniture alone (like mine do) I've been scratched (and bitten) quite a
few times and it really doesn't hurt that much. It's part of being a cat
lover!!!

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Fourth mistake. Declawing is *never* routine, even in the USA where
&gt;&gt; it is common. The majority of moral Vets will only do it in
&gt;&gt; exceptional circumstances. In Australia (where I live) declawing is
&gt;&gt; banned and Vets can be charged with animal cruelty if they perform the
&gt;&gt; surgery.
&gt;In the USA it is so common that some landlords require their cats to be
&gt;dclawed before they can rent an apartment, some vets offer it in a
&gt;package along with spaying or neutering and vaccinations. An operation
&gt;performed millions of times a years, and probably more than a dozen
&gt;times a year by each vet, is definitely is routine and complications are
&gt;so rare that I have never heard of case where a complication occurred by
&gt;anyone I've known who's ever had a cat.

"/> Then this is *very* sad. To make a mutilation routine ....

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Now let us compare these benefits of desexing with the benefits of
&gt;&gt; declawing.
&gt;I think you missed my point in the previous post so I'll reiterate. A
&gt;declawed cat in most cases will make for a happier home (if your cat
&gt;isn't ruining your furniture, drapery, carpet, blankets, beds, etc that
&gt;is great, but most of the time they will). If the owners are happy, the
&gt;cat will be happy from many factors (better care, more attention, toys,
&gt;better food, bonding, etc.). If the owners are unhappy, the cat is very
&gt;likely to be resented, abandoned, given to the animal shelter, or put to
&gt;death. Don't tell me that a cat has never been abandoned or put to
&gt;death over ruining the furniture becase last I checked behavioral
&gt;problems were the #1 reason for abandoning cats.

"/> And why can't a clawed cat make a happy home?? My cats *don't* ruin my
furniture, drapery, carpet, blankets, beds, etc. I am happy and my cats do
indeed reflect this.

I think you've gone a little over the top with your statement &quot;last I
checked behavioural problems were the #1 reason for abandoning cats&quot;. In
Australia at least, the #1 reason for abandoning cats is when they become
pregnant (females) or start spraying (males). Both of these problems are
fixed by desexing. Kinda blows your whole argurment out of the water
doesn't it??

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Are these enough reasons for you to consider that perhaps declawing
&gt;&gt; and desexing should not be placed in the same catagory?
&gt;There's one more reason I've been considering declawing my cat.
&gt;Clipping her claws seems to reslove the problem for a week or two but
&gt;every time I go to clip her claws she resents it so much, throws such a
&gt;fit, and is anguished so badly that it would almost be better just to
&gt;remove them all at once and get it over with than to have a lifetime of
&gt;clipping them with all the pain and angiush.

"/> Have you heard of a product called &quot;Soft Paws&quot;? They are small, soft
things that you glue over the top of the claws. They last for several
weeks apparently. They stop all scratching but the cat still thinks it
*can* scratch so it doesn't bite. Sounds like the perfect solution to me!

At least give something non-surgical like this a try, okay??

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Good post indeed, but I disagree in almost every place. I'll tell you
why.

&gt;&gt; First mistake. Declawing is *not* a simple surgery. It involves the
&gt;&gt; removal of not only the claw but the entire first knuckle. Take your
hand
&gt;&gt; off the keyboard for a moment. Look at the fingers on your right hand.
&gt;&gt; Now imagine someone cutting them *all* off at the first knuckle. Now
&gt;&gt; imagine functioning without them. How do you think it would feel?
&gt; Taking off the first knuckle sounds pretty simple to me. A bit more
simple
&gt; than cutting into the abdomen, cutting into the fallopian tubes, and
cutting
&gt; them off. Neutering seems like the simplest of the operations but I'm
sure
&gt; an operation to the genetals is at least as painful as an operation to the
&gt; feet.

"/> Maybe the initial surgery pain is equivalent (I don't agree with this. A
spay has ONE incision to hurt. A declaw has 10) , but then again, they
don't walk on their testicles or abdomens.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; You cannot compare it to a desexing operation. Millions of women around
&gt;&gt; the world every year have hysterectomies. They all live happy and
healthy
&gt;&gt; lives afterwards. How many people would go on happily without any
&gt; knuckles
&gt;&gt; on either hand? And sometimes the first joint of the toes as well?
&gt; You can't compare losing knuckles in a human being to losing knuckles in a
&gt; cat. Humans need their hands and fingers for most things they do (eating,
&gt; drinking, driving a car, keyboard, remote control). A cat doesn't need
&gt; their fingers for any of this. I've seen people who've lost fingers in
&gt; accidents, and even as important as fingers are to human beings, they
still
&gt; live happy lives. Same with many people in wheelchairs.

"/> Yes, and humans don't walk on their hands either. Cats are digitrade. They
walk on their toes. When you amputate part of them, it can cause chronic
pain.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Second mistake. If the desexing surgery is done at a fairly young age,
&gt;&gt; most females recover within a couple of days (except for the stitches
&gt; which
&gt;&gt; come out in ten days) and males within 24 hours. For early age
neutering
&gt;&gt; (at about 8 weeks) the recovery time is even less. Declawing can take
up
&gt;&gt; to six weeks for full recovery.
&gt; This is what I mean by biased. Yes, declawing can take up to 8 full weeks
&gt; for recovery, in rare cases but most are on their feet within a couple
days
&gt; and have fully recovered by ten days. Spaying and neutering can take 8
full
&gt; weeks to recover too, in rare cases.

"/> Declawing can take a life time to recover. Chronic pain, arthritis. Every
day of their lives in pain.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Third mistake. It is well documented that cats without claws can become
&gt;&gt; habitual biters. In fact a cat without claws will be much *more*
&gt;&gt; frustrated because they can't do the things that come naturally to it -
&gt;&gt; like scratching on a scratching post or digging comfortably in it's
litter
&gt;&gt; tray.
&gt; They *can* become habitual biters, and for the most part they probably do
&gt; bite more often. But it is much better than having you arms scraped up
and
&gt; bleeding from claw marks which is more likely to happen if your cat isn't
&gt; declawed than being biten badly if your cat is declawed. Also, I've never
&gt; seen drapery, carpet, or furniture ruined by a cat biting it.

"/> You are showing a lack of knowledge here. Cat bites are VERY SERIOUS. They
are more dangerous than a few scratches. If you are bleeding from claw
marks, you must be doing something questionable to the cat.

I've seen cords and blinds ruined by cats biting them. But you know what, I
wouldn't take their teeth out for it. So what if the furniture is
scratched? It only means you've been too lazy to train them. YOUR PROBLEM,
NOT THEIRS.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Fourth mistake. Declawing is *never* routine, even in the USA where it
is
&gt;&gt; common. The majority of moral Vets will only do it in exceptional
&gt;&gt; circumstances. In Australia (where I live) declawing is banned and Vets
&gt;&gt; can be charged with animal cruelty if they perform the surgery.
&gt; In the USA it is so common that some landlords require their cats to be
&gt; dclawed before they can rent an apartment, some vets offer it in a package
&gt; along with spaying or neutering and vaccinations. An operation performed
&gt; millions of times a years, and probably more than a dozen times a year by
&gt; each vet, is definitely is routine and complications are so rare that I
have
&gt; never heard of case where a complication occurred by anyone I've known
who's
&gt; ever had a cat.

"/> It's been stated in studies that only 10% of the feline population is
declawed.

So what if it is a routine procedure? It shouldn't be! Of course vets
offer it as a package deal! It's called GREED!
Only in the US and Canada is this done. Other countries have banned the
practice. I wonder why?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Now let us compare these benefits of desexing with the benefits of
&gt;&gt; declawing.
&gt; I think you missed my point in the previous post so I'll reiterate. A
&gt; declawed cat in most cases will make for a happier home (if your cat isn't
&gt; ruining your furniture, drapery, carpet, blankets, beds, etc that is
great,
&gt; but most of the time they will). If the owners are happy, the cat will be
&gt; happy from many factors (better care, more attention, toys, better food,
&gt; bonding, etc.). If the owners are unhappy, the cat is very likely to be
&gt; resented, abandoned, given to the animal shelter, or put to death. Don't
&gt; tell me that a cat has never been abandoned or put to death over ruining
the
&gt; furniture becase last I checked behavioral problems were the #1 reason for
&gt; abandoning cats.

"/> Yes, behavioral problems may be a top reason for cats being abandoned. But
scratching furniture isn't in those top reasons. Urinating inappropriately
is. And that can be caused by litter aversion due to declawing. Biting is
a reason some people surrender their cats too.

If people are so happy with their declawed cats, then why are they in
shelters? If people can't accept animals as animals who may have some
destructive behavior, and take the time to train them, they don't deserve a
cat. If things like this make them unhappy, the cat's gonna be abandoned
anyway. They'll find another reason.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; Are these enough reasons for you to consider that perhaps declawing and
&gt;&gt; desexing should not be placed in the same catagory?
&gt; There's one more reason I've been considering declawing my cat. Clipping
&gt; her claws seems to reslove the problem for a week or two but every time I
go
&gt; to clip her claws she resents it so much, throws such a fit, and is
&gt; anguished so badly that it would almost be better just to remove them all
at
&gt; once and get it over with than to have a lifetime of clipping them with
all
&gt; the pain and angiush.

"/> Oh the pain and anguish of nail clipping. Give me a break! I've got 12
cats and I clip ALL of their nails without pain and anguish.

&gt;&gt;&gt;I don't mean to drag this into a huge debate with flaming and such but

&gt;Probably not possible when you bring up declawing!

&gt;&gt;and healthy lives afterwards. How many people would go on happily
&gt;&gt;without any knuckles on either hand? And sometimes the first joint of
&gt;&gt;the toes as well?

&gt;I do get tired of this argument. I guess if I had to choose
&gt;between having ovaries &amp; uterus removed versus fingertips removed,
&gt;I'd choose the former, but it would be close. Hysterectomy,
&gt;particularly when the ovaries are also removed (which is what
&gt;happens to a spayed cat) is NOT trivial in a human. Women who
&gt;have their ovaries removed, especially if they are premenopausal,
&gt;often have to take hormones to stay healthy, and it's still not
&gt;easy. For example, I know someone who had this done and she is
&gt;constantly wrestling with her cholesterol levels, which weren't
&gt;a problem before -- a common effect. Osteoporosis is a risk too.
&gt;Few humans would accept this surgery unless (as in my friend's
&gt;case) there is an overriding, *immediate* medical reason to do it.

"/> I never said that it was simple surgery or trivialised it in humans. In
cats it is still major abdominal surgery. And you're right, you can't
compare cat and human surgery - it does indeed take weeks for humans to
recover from a hysterctomy while for a cat it's a couple of days.

But I was trying to point out in my original post to this troll the fact
that women live mostly happy lives after having a hysterectomy. Sure some
need to take hormones and there are some health risks, but they far
outweight the reasons why they had the surgery in the first place. And I
guess this is what it comes down to. The benefits of the surgery should
outweight the negatives of what is required afterwards.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;I make the point about *immediate* because it's true for humans
&gt;that we wouldn't get much ovarian cancer or testicular cancer if
&gt;we all had our ovaries or testicles removed at an early age, but
&gt;that doesn't mean we should do that. I'm not volunteering, that's
&gt;for sure.

"/> Me neither!! But what about the *immediate* danger of many unwanted
kittens being born? What about the *immediate* danger of contracting
sexually transmitted disease? What about the not-so-immediate danger of a
future with uterine/mammory/testicular cancer - all prevelant in cats that
aren't desexed.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Now, cats are pretty different from humans in this area, and I
&gt;can only take it on faith from my vets and others that it's less
&gt;of a problem in cats than it is in people. I never heard of a cat
&gt;getting osteoporosis, for example!

"/> No, but other health problems can arise if you don't get them desexed.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;I also think it's unfair for people having this discussion to
&gt;pretend that there's no benefit to the human in having the pet
&gt;desexed. If scratching is just what cats do, and you should be
&gt;able to accept that if you're going to adopt a cat, why doesn't
&gt;that apply to intact male cats spraying, and females calling?
&gt;I personally think that it *does* apply -- that if desexing the
&gt;cat had no benefits to the cat, it would probably be wrong to do
&gt;it for only those reasons. (And in that case, I wouldn't have a
&gt;cat, because I wouldn't tolerate having my house sprayed.)

"/> Because it's much, much more than that. You are helping cats everywhere by
not contributing to the over population. You are helping the cat from
contracting a lot of diseases. You are helping the cat with certain types
of cancer. Sure there are some side benefits (ie the stopping of spraying)
but I wouldn't have my cats desexed for that reason only.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Now don't anybody misinterpret the above. I am opposed to
&gt;declawing, and I believe pets should be spayed and neutered.
&gt;But it weakens the argument if we pretend that it's *all* for
&gt;the cat's benefit. And comparing spaying to a human having
&gt;ovaries and uterus removed is probably misleading, in that it
&gt;appears to have more health benefits than disadvantages for a
&gt;cat, where the opposite is true for humans unless there is a
&gt;diagnosed problem such as endometriosis or cancer.

"/> Humans shouldn't be having hysterectomies except for medical reasons. Any
gynae doing it for contraceptive purposes, for example, should be shot!!
I'm not naive enough to think that it isn't going on, it just shouldn't.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;I think the reason these issues (and some others, like indoor vs.
&gt;outdoor) are so contentious is because at the root of it, it comes
&gt;down to the basic issue of whether it is right for humans to keep
&gt;animals for companionship or other purposes, when it means that the
&gt;animal's life is changed in some ways that may not be entirely to
&gt;the animal's benefit, e.g. loss of freedom (though the changes may
&gt;be balanced by improvements to other areas of the animal's life).
&gt;I think that's something that everyone has to decide for herself
&gt;or himself. I also think that once you know how you feel on this
&gt;basic issue, you'll find your positions on indoor/outdoor, desexing,
&gt;and declawing will flow naturally from that basis.

&gt;(And just to avoid any overly-polarized arguments, I don't think
&gt;it's black-and-white -- for example, I personally feel ok about
&gt;keeping cats, and in a different living situation would keep a dog,
&gt;but have doubts about riding horses and keeping birds in cages.)

"/> This is very true. Those who believe in total naturality usually disagree
with desexing, declawing and keeping their pets indoors. Those who see
cats as being owned tend to agree with all the above. I'm somewhere in the
middle.

scratch mark (especially Bengels who are known to play hard). My cat likes
to stretch her claws and sink them in to furniture or carpet when she is
happy (or after eating tasty canned food). Sometimes she will sink her
claws into clothing or skin when she is happy not realizing it is painful to
humans. Ever try bathing a cat? Or clipping a cat's nails? You would be
very lucky to get away without being scratched. Or sometimes my cat will be
in a playful mood and swat at me (or others) when they pet her. She also
finds it especially effective to wake me up in the morning by scratching me.

&gt;&gt; Good post indeed, but I disagree in almost every place. I'll tell you
&gt; why.
&gt;&lt;snip&gt;
&gt;&gt; I don't understand why someone can't ask a simple question and get a
&gt;&gt; straight answer without a huge flame war.

&gt; Because declawing is a very touchy subject around here, to say the least,
&gt; and with very good reason. To someone who is completely unaware of how
&gt; cruel and unnecessary declawing is, it might come as a surprise to see
&gt; people on this newsgroup come out with such force against it. We can seem
&gt; downright fanatical or irrational in condemning it, at least to someone
who
&gt; sees it as a simple matter of removing only the claws.

&gt; Phil P. has probably already provided a link to an excellent page on
&gt; declawing; the sources he cites are from veterinary journals, and it is
&gt; important to read it and understand exactly what declawing entails. It is
&gt; also important to understand how completely *unnecessary* the procedure
is,
&gt; and that there are far more effective and humane ways of dealing with cat
&gt; behavior.

&gt;&gt;&gt; First mistake. Declawing is *not* a simple surgery. It involves the
&gt;&gt;&gt; removal of not only the claw but the entire first knuckle. Take your
&gt; hand
&gt;&gt;&gt; off the keyboard for a moment. Look at the fingers on your right
hand.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Now imagine someone cutting them *all* off at the first knuckle. Now
&gt;&gt;&gt; imagine functioning without them. How do you think it would feel?

&gt;&gt; Taking off the first knuckle sounds pretty simple to me. A bit more
&gt; simple
&gt;&gt; than cutting into the abdomen, cutting into the fallopian tubes, and
&gt; cutting
&gt;&gt; them off. Neutering seems like the simplest of the operations but I'm
&gt; sure
&gt;&gt; an operation to the genetals is at least as painful as an operation to
the
&gt;&gt; feet.

&gt; I've had a tubal ligation, and I know women who have had to have
&gt; hysterectomies. Given the choice between performing *ten separate
&gt; amputations* in order to remove the tips of our fingers and thumbs or
having
&gt; abdominal surgery for valid health reasons, which do you really think we
&gt; might have sprung for?

&gt;&lt;snipped&gt;
&gt;&gt; You can't compare losing knuckles in a human being to losing knuckles in
a
&gt;&gt; cat. Humans need their hands and fingers for most things they do
(eating,
&gt;&gt; drinking, driving a car, keyboard, remote control). A cat doesn't need
&gt;&gt; their fingers for any of this. I've seen people who've lost fingers in
&gt;&gt; accidents, and even as important as fingers are to human beings, they
&gt; still
&gt;&gt; live happy lives. Same with many people in wheelchairs.

&gt; Cats do need their claws, just as humans need their fingers. If they
didn't
&gt; need them, they wouldn't have them. Cats keep the muscles in their legs,
&gt; back and shoulders in shape by clawing--the stretching and pulling they
&gt; engage in while clawing keeps the muscles toned. They mark their
&gt; territories by clawing, not simply with visual evidence, but also with
&gt; scent--there are scent glands in their paws that can only release their
odor
&gt; through clawing.

&gt; If a cat can't mark its territory by clawing, it will very often resort to
&gt; urinating. I have a friend who got a wonderful cat from the local animal
&gt; shelter; after her previous owner had her declawed she was still dumped
&gt; because she began peeing on the furniture that was supposed to be saved by
&gt; having her claws removed.

&gt; Claws are also there for defense--if a declawed cat gets outside it is
&gt; automatically at a great diasdvantage, not only agains other cats, but
&gt; raccoons and other animals as well. They don't even have the option of
&gt; racing up a tree to get away from danger. Unless you live in an urban
&gt; high-rise apartment with very controlled access, there is *always* a
chance
&gt; that the cat will get out. If you're lucky, you'll be home and able to
get
&gt; her back inside.

&gt; The argument that a cat &quot;doesn't need its claws&quot; is based in ignorance of
&gt; cat behavior. Unfortunately, too many people get cats and never make an
&gt; effort to find out what makes that animal tick. The most effective way of
&gt; dealing with difficulties with *any* animal is to take the time to
&gt; understand the animal. Cats are not a mystery. There are reasons why
they
&gt; do what they do, and when you work with their own innate behaviors rather
&gt; than fight against them or resort to quick and brutal &quot;fixes&quot; like
declawing
&gt; they will respond.

&gt; As for humans who lose fingers or limbs, they have ways of adapting,

&gt; easier. They are able to effectively communicate with other humans, who
can

geared towards my specific case.

&gt; Well, by the sound of this and your other posts over the last couple of
&gt; days, post you probably *are* a troll ... however ...

&gt; Whilst licking their paws in alt.animals.cat on 11 Oct 2000, j ... @wd.net
&gt; (John) purred the following:

&gt;&gt;Good post indeed, but I disagree in almost every place. I'll tell you
&gt;&gt;why.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Then you are asking entirely the wrong question. My first instinct
&gt;&gt;&gt; was that you are a troll, simply here to start a flame war. Then I
&gt;&gt;&gt; wondered, what if you aren't? What if you are genuine? Then you need
&gt;&gt;&gt; to hear both sides of the story.
&gt;&gt;I don't understand why someone can't ask a simple question and get a
&gt;&gt;straight answer without a huge flame war.

&gt;&gt;&gt; First mistake. Declawing is *not* a simple surgery. It involves the
&gt;&gt;&gt; removal of not only the claw but the entire first knuckle. Take your
&gt;&gt;&gt; hand off the keyboard for a moment. Look at the fingers on your right
&gt;&gt;&gt; hand. Now imagine someone cutting them *all* off at the first knuckle.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Now imagine functioning without them. How do you think it would
&gt;&gt;&gt; feel?
&gt;&gt;Taking off the first knuckle sounds pretty simple to me. A bit more
&gt;&gt;simple than cutting into the abdomen, cutting into the fallopian tubes,
&gt;&gt;and cutting them off. Neutering seems like the simplest of the
&gt;&gt;operations but I'm sure an operation to the genetals is at least as
&gt;&gt;painful as an operation to the feet.

&gt; Did you do what I suggested?? Sure, cats don't use thier paws for typing
&gt; or writing - only to WALK!!!!!! A slightly more essential activity than
&gt; almost *anything* we humans can use our hand for.

&gt;&gt;&gt; You cannot compare it to a desexing operation. Millions of women
&gt;&gt;&gt; around the world every year have hysterectomies. They all live happy
&gt;&gt;&gt; and healthy lives afterwards. How many people would go on happily
&gt;&gt;&gt; without any
&gt;&gt;knuckles
&gt;&gt;&gt; on either hand? And sometimes the first joint of the toes as well?
&gt;&gt;You can't compare losing knuckles in a human being to losing knuckles in
&gt;&gt;a cat. Humans need their hands and fingers for most things they do
&gt;&gt;(eating, drinking, driving a car, keyboard, remote control). A cat
&gt;&gt;doesn't need their fingers for any of this. I've seen people who've
&gt;&gt;lost fingers in accidents, and even as important as fingers are to human
&gt;&gt;beings, they still live happy lives. Same with many people in
&gt;&gt;wheelchairs.

&gt; Difference being there is a medical reason to lose them. You want to take
&gt; your cats claws away for convenience - nothing more. And don't say
&gt; desexing is for convenience - I gave in my last post the many, many good
&gt; reasons why desexing is for the good of the cat and the good of all the
&gt; kittens that he/she might produce if left undesexed.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Second mistake. If the desexing surgery is done at a fairly young
&gt;&gt;&gt; age, most females recover within a couple of days (except for the
&gt;&gt;&gt; stitches
&gt;&gt;which
&gt;&gt;&gt; come out in ten days) and males within 24 hours. For early age
&gt;&gt;&gt; neutering (at about 8 weeks) the recovery time is even less.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Declawing can take up to six weeks for full recovery.
&gt;&gt;This is what I mean by biased. Yes, declawing can take up to 8 full
&gt;&gt;weeks for recovery, in rare cases but most are on their feet within a
&gt;&gt;couple days and have fully recovered by ten days. Spaying and neutering
&gt;&gt;can take 8 full weeks to recover too, in rare cases.

&gt; I have been there for the spay/neuter surgery for so many cats I wouldn't
&gt; even begin to be able to count them. And not one, *ever* has taken more
&gt; than a day or two to recover. I have never seen a declawing surgery
(thank
&gt; goodness) but I know from my many friends in the States that the recovery
&gt; time is very long.

&gt; Do you also realise the idiocy of one statement up there? &quot;most are on
&gt; their feet within a couple of days&quot; - *any* surgery done simply for
&gt; convenience that lays a cat out for a couple of days is disgusting!!!!

&gt;&gt;&gt; Third mistake. It is well documented that cats without claws can
&gt;&gt;&gt; become habitual biters. In fact a cat without claws will be much
&gt;&gt;&gt; *more* frustrated because they can't do the things that come naturally
&gt;&gt;&gt; to it - like scratching on a scratching post or digging comfortably in
&gt;&gt;&gt; it's litter tray.
&gt;&gt;They *can* become habitual biters, and for the most part they probably
&gt;&gt;do bite more often. But it is much better than having you arms scraped
&gt;&gt;up and bleeding from claw marks which is more likely to happen if your
&gt;&gt;cat isn't declawed than being biten badly if your cat is declawed.
&gt;&gt;Also, I've never seen drapery, carpet, or furniture ruined by a cat
&gt;&gt;biting it.

&gt; So what is more important - your cats health or your furniture? If you
&gt; provide sufficient scratching posts and toys the cats tend to leave the
&gt; furniture alone (like mine do) I've been scratched (and bitten) quite a
&gt; few times and it really doesn't hurt that much. It's part of being a cat
&gt; lover!!!

&gt;&gt;&gt; Fourth mistake. Declawing is *never* routine, even in the USA where
&gt;&gt;&gt; it is common. The majority of moral Vets will only do it in
&gt;&gt;&gt; exceptional circumstances. In Australia (where I live) declawing is
&gt;&gt;&gt; banned and Vets can be charged with animal cruelty if they perform the
&gt;&gt;&gt; surgery.
&gt;&gt;In the USA it is so common that some landlords require their cats to be
&gt;&gt;dclawed before they can rent an apartment, some vets offer it in a
&gt;&gt;package along with spaying or neutering and vaccinations. An operation
&gt;&gt;performed millions of times a years, and probably more than a dozen
&gt;&gt;times a year by each vet, is definitely is routine and complications are
&gt;&gt;so rare that I have never heard of case where a complication occurred by
&gt;&gt;anyone I've known who's ever had a cat.

&gt; Then this is *very* sad. To make a mutilation routine ....

&gt;&gt;&gt; Now let us compare these benefits of desexing with the benefits of
&gt;&gt;&gt; declawing.
&gt;&gt;I think you missed my point in the previous post so I'll reiterate. A
&gt;&gt;declawed cat in most cases will make for a happier home (if your cat
&gt;&gt;isn't ruining your furniture, drapery, carpet, blankets, beds, etc that
&gt;&gt;is great, but most of the time they will). If the owners are happy, the
&gt;&gt;cat will be happy from many factors (better care, more attention, toys,
&gt;&gt;better food, bonding, etc.). If the owners are unhappy, the cat is very
&gt;&gt;likely to be resented, abandoned, given to the animal shelter, or put to
&gt;&gt;death. Don't tell me that a cat has never been abandoned or put to
&gt;&gt;death over ruining the furniture becase last I checked behavioral
&gt;&gt;problems were the #1 reason for abandoning cats.

&gt; And why can't a clawed cat make a happy home?? My cats *don't* ruin my
&gt; furniture, drapery, carpet, blankets, beds, etc. I am happy and my cats
do
&gt; indeed reflect this.

&gt; I think you've gone a little over the top with your statement &quot;last I
&gt; checked behavioural problems were the #1 reason for abandoning cats&quot;. In
&gt; Australia at least, the #1 reason for abandoning cats is when they become
&gt; pregnant (females) or start spraying (males). Both of these problems are
&gt; fixed by desexing. Kinda blows your whole argurment out of the water
&gt; doesn't it??

&gt;&gt;&gt; Are these enough reasons for you to consider that perhaps declawing
&gt;&gt;&gt; and desexing should not be placed in the same catagory?
&gt;&gt;There's one more reason I've been considering declawing my cat.

"/> Dr. Nicholas Dodman, Professor of Behavioral Pharmacology and Director of
the Behavior Clinic at Tufts University School of Veterinary Medicine and
internationally known specialist in domestic animal behavioral research,
explains declawing and *confirms* your statement:

&quot;The inhumanity of the procedure is clearly demonstrated by the nature of
cats' recovery from anesthesia following the surgery. Unlike routine
recoveries, including recovery from neutering surgeries, which are fairly
peaceful, declawing
surgery results in cats bouncing off the walls of the recovery cage because
of excruciating pain. Cats that are more stoic huddle in the corner of the
recovery cage, immobilized in a state of helplessness, presumably by
overwhelming pain.
Declawing fits the dictionary definition of mutilation to a tee. Words such
as deform, disfigure, disjoint, and dismember all apply to this surgery.
Partial digital amputation is so horrible that it has been employed for
torture of prisoners of war, and in veterinary medicine, the clinical
procedure serves as model of severe pain for testing the efficacy of
analgesic drugs. Even though analgesic drugs can be used postoperatively,
they rarely are, and their effects are incomplete and transient anyway, so
sooner or later the pain will emerge.&quot;

are

&gt;&gt; 3)Cats can still stretch if they've been declawed and they can live just
&gt; as

&gt;&gt;&gt; Good post Vicki.

&gt;&gt;&gt; On the subject of desexing, all of my cats are spayed/neutered. None
&gt; have
&gt;&gt;&gt; suffered ANY ill effects. In fact, a couple of the females were
tearing
&gt;&gt;&gt; round fit to burst their stitches as soon as they got home. One tom
was
&gt; a
&gt;&gt;&gt; little bothered for a couple of days, the other not at all.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Now, as to declawing, I replied to a previous post, the transcript of
&gt; the
&gt;&gt;&gt; whole post being as follows below (please read from the bottom up). I
&gt; know
&gt;&gt;&gt; I'd much prefer carpets and furniture that resemble worn out
pincushions
&gt;&gt; and
&gt;&gt;&gt; happy cats, than declaw them. Isn't this part of the fun of having
cats
&gt; ?

&gt;&gt;&gt; Transcript follows :-

&gt;&gt;&gt; I had no idea it was THAT bad. I'm even more against it now. Thanks
for
&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt;&gt; information. I hope that people who are considering declawing read
this
&gt;&gt; and
&gt;&gt;&gt; see just how much suffereing they will cause.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Right!
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The nail is actually extended directly from the bone itself. In
fact
&gt; it
&gt;&gt;&gt; is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; not too uncommon for vets who do not cut enough of the bone off to
&gt; have
&gt;&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; claw start growing back. The problem is it grow through the skin
that
&gt;&gt; has
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; healed OVER the cut off part of the toe. When this happens it
almost
&gt;&gt;&gt; always
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; results in severe infection and ultimately leads the kitty back to
get
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; de-clawed all over again to stop the infection.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The other problem with declawing is the kitty supports much of it's
&gt;&gt; weight
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; with the claw part of the toe. Just like you and I extend a
&gt; significant
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; portion of our weight onto out toes when we walk. Cats do the same
&gt;&gt; thing
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; but their claws are their toes. After de-clawing the entire posture
&gt; of
&gt;&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; cat is changed to an unnatural form. This often leads to back, leg
&gt; and
&gt;&gt;&gt; hip
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; problems later in life because the cat has tried to compensate by
&gt;&gt;&gt; adjusting
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; itself to an unnatural walk and stance.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; One other problem is a cat needs to stretch it's back and legs
almost
&gt;&gt;&gt; every
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; day. You've seen your cat when it first wakes up arch his back real
&gt;&gt;&gt; sharply
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; upward, then almost as sharply downward. While they are doing this
&gt;&gt; their
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; claws are anchored into whatever they are standing on. If they do
not
&gt;&gt;&gt; have
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; claws they cannot anchor themselves. This seriously reduces the
&gt; amount
&gt;&gt; of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; stretching they can do. This also often leads to problems later in
&gt;&gt; life.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; also, technically -from what i've read- it's more like chopping
off

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Whilst licking their paws in alt.animals.cat on 09 Oct 2000,
&gt; j ... @wd.net
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (John) purred the following:

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I don't mean to drag this into a huge debate with flaming and such
&gt; but
&gt;&gt; I

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Then you are asking entirely the wrong question. My first instinct
&gt; was
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that you are a troll, simply here to start a flame war. Then I
&gt;&gt; wondered,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; what if you aren't? What if you are genuine? Then you need to hear
&gt;&gt; both
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; sides of the story.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You won't hear any flames from me, but you will hear the truth and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; sometimes the truth hurts.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;am curious as to why the consensus here is that desexing your cat
in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;great and humane, makes them better pets and such, but when the
&gt; subject
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;turns to declawing, people believe that it is brutal mutilation.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;They are both relatively simple surgeries and can have risks
involved

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; First mistake. Declawing is *not* a simple surgery. It involves
the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; removal of not only the claw but the entire first knuckle. Take
your
&gt;&gt; hand
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; off the keyboard for a moment. Look at the fingers on your right
&gt; hand.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Now imagine someone cutting them *all* off at the first knuckle.
Now
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; imagine functioning without them. How do you think it would feel?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You cannot compare it to a desexing operation. Millions of women
&gt; around
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the world every year have hysterectomies. They all live happy and
&gt;&gt; healthy
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; lives afterwards. How many people would go on happily without any
&gt;&gt;&gt; knuckles
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; on either hand? And sometimes the first joint of the toes as well?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;(the anesthetic alone is a risk), the cat hates having any of the
&gt; parts
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;removed, and the cat generally recovers in a few days to a couple
&gt;&gt; weeks.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Second mistake. If the desexing surgery is done at a fairly young
&gt; age,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; most females recover within a couple of days (except for the
stitches
&gt;&gt;&gt; which
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; come out in ten days) and males within 24 hours. For early age
&gt;&gt; neutering
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (at about 8 weeks) the recovery time is even less. Declawing can
take
&gt;&gt; up
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to six weeks for full recovery.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I've read the anti-declawing websites and find them to be a little
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;biased, most knowledgeable veterinarians dislike having the
declawing
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;procedure done but believe the cats will be better off as a better
&gt; pet
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;that isn't destructive and causing frustrations. If the owners are

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Third mistake. It is well documented that cats without claws can
&gt; become
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; habitual biters. In fact a cat without claws will be much *more*
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; frustrated because they can't do the things that come naturally to
&gt; it -
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; like scratching on a scratching post or digging comfortably in it's
&gt;&gt; litter
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; tray.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;happy, the pet will be happy. If the owners are unhappy, the pet
can
&gt; be
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;abandoned or put asleep.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I guess the point to make is that both surgeries are a form of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;mutilation, but are usually routine and make for

John, the bottom line is you stated you weren't trolling.
However, you have no facts to go on, you are merely TOTALLY
INSISTANT that you are right, no matter what.
You being &quot;right&quot; is what's important to you.
Unfortunately this is one of the things in life you aren't right about,
and the truth isn't altered by anything you say.
Now, you have definitely become either a troll, or the equivalent
of a very foolish boy. I would hope somewhere in life you learn
more and become a more reasonable thinker.

&gt;&gt;Cats do need their claws, just as humans need their fingers.
&gt; But they don't need them anywhere near as much as humans. They definitely
&gt; don't need them for eating, driving, working, typing, changing the channels,
&gt; etc.

&gt;&gt;If they didn't need them, they wouldn't have them.
&gt; Which does a lot to explain why we have tonsils and an appendix.

&gt;&gt;They mark their territories by clawing, not simply with visual evidence,
&gt; but also with scent--there are scent glands in their
&gt;&gt;paws that can only release their odor through clawing.
&gt; An indoor cat has no use for this.

&gt;&gt;Declawing is performed strictly to prevent the cat from
&gt;&gt;damaging furniture--there is no other reason to do it. It provides
&gt;&gt;absolutely no health benefit to the cat
&gt; A happy owner often makes for a happy (and healthy) cat. An unhappy owner
&gt; often makes for an abandoned (or dead) cat. Often a cat that destroys the
&gt; furniture makes a home unhappy. Declawing many times is the only answer.

&gt;&gt;What are you *doing* to the cat that would cause you to have &quot;arms scraped
&gt;&gt;up and bleeding from claw marks?&quot;
&gt; Often just playing with a cat that has claws will result in some formidable
&gt; scratch mark (especially Bengels who are known to play hard). My cat likes
&gt; to stretch her claws and sink them in to furniture or carpet when she is
&gt; happy (or after eating tasty canned food). Sometimes she will sink her
&gt; claws into clothing or skin when she is happy not realizing it is painful to
&gt; humans. Ever try bathing a cat? Or clipping a cat's nails? You would be
&gt; very lucky to get away without being scratched. Or sometimes my cat will be
&gt; in a playful mood and swat at me (or others) when they pet her. She also
&gt; finds it especially effective to wake me up in the morning by scratching me.
&gt; You don't necessarily have to *do* anything to get clawed by a cat.

&gt;&gt;And as for bites being better--have you ever been
&gt;&gt;bitten (and I mean really bitten, not just nipped) by a cat?
&gt; Didn't say bites are better, only that being scratched by a cat not declawed
&gt; happens much more often than being bitten by a declawed cat (and cat bites
&gt; usually don't wreck furniture).

&gt;&gt;Declawing is also quite profitable. The same economics that leads plastic
&gt;&gt;surgeons to perform excessive or risky procedures on human patients, simply
&gt;&gt;because they want it, drives vets who declaw
&gt; I hope you aren't trying to say that none of these vets care for cats or
&gt; animals. They sure got into the wrong field under your views.

&gt;&gt;You may not know anyone whose cat has had complications, but exactly
&gt;&gt;how many declawed cats do you know?
&gt; Veterinarians usually know quite a few declawed vets and out of the 3 I've
&gt; talked to none of them has seen a complication yet. They've seen allergic
&gt; reactions to anesthesia but that is very rare as well.

&gt;&gt;In other words, it's *inconvenient for you* to clip her claws, so she
&gt; should
&gt;&gt;be the one to suffer?
&gt; That is a *very* hasty assumption. Convenience hasn't been the issue, her
&gt; painful anguish and resentment is. After clipping she is usually so worked
&gt; up and sick to her stomach that she just lays there, sleeps, and feels
&gt; horrible. This isn't in the cat's best interest (or mine). Would be easier
&gt; for her if they were just gotten rid of all at once and never had to deal
&gt; with a lifetime of torturous clipping sessions.

&gt;&gt;find another way to do it--having someone else hold
&gt;&gt;her while she is wrapped firmly in a towel, one leg outside the towel at a
&gt;&gt;time, might help.
&gt; again, this is more convenient for me, but not the cat

&gt;&gt;I can tell that you don't have a clue what makes her tick or
&gt;&gt;how to deal with it from a cat's point of view
&gt; That's not an insult, I know I don't know very much. That is why I asked
&gt; the question in the first place. But I think that you on the other hand
&gt; assume you know what makes a cat tick or how to deal with things from a
&gt; cat's point of view and really don't know much more than me.

&gt;&gt;A cat is not a toy, or an animate object that can simply be manipulated at
&gt;&gt;will. A cat is not a toy, or an animate object that can simply be
&gt; manipulated at
&gt;&gt;will. It's not a little meat puppet, there simply to make you happy. It
&gt;&gt;has a life and consciousness and way of relating to the world that is very
&gt;&gt;unique, but hardly unfathomable. If she's clawing the furniture and doing
&gt;&gt;things you don't want her to do, it is not because she is spiteful, or
&gt;&gt;playing mind games, or stupid--she is simply a cat, doing what cats do, and
&gt;&gt;you need to be able to offer her a reasonable alternative from a cat point
&gt;&gt;of view.
&gt; duh, *sigh* Which is exactly why many people are forced to resort to
&gt; declawing in order to correct their scratching problem. There usually isn't
&gt; any other way. Other problems resulting from declawing is so rare that it
&gt; isn't even worth bringing up in an unbiased discussion.

&gt;&gt;training her to use a scratching post
&gt; useless, she won't even look at the thing (even placed right by her food).

&gt;&gt;&gt; Good post indeed, but I disagree in almost every place. I'll tell you
&gt;&gt; why.
&gt;&gt;&lt;snip&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; I don't understand why someone can't ask a simple question and get a
&gt;&gt;&gt; straight answer without a huge flame war.

&gt;&gt; Because declawing is a very touchy subject around here, to say the least,
&gt;&gt; and with very good reason. To someone who is completely unaware of how
&gt;&gt; cruel and unnecessary declawing is, it might come as a surprise to see
&gt;&gt; people on this newsgroup come out with such force against it. We can seem
&gt;&gt; downright fanatical or irrational in condemning it, at least to someone
&gt; who
&gt;&gt; sees it as a simple matter of removing only the claws.

&gt;&gt; Phil P. has probably already provided a link to an excellent page on
&gt;&gt; declawing; the sources he cites are from veterinary journals, and it is
&gt;&gt; important to read it and understand exactly what declawing entails. It is
&gt;&gt; also important to understand how completely *unnecessary* the procedure
&gt; is,
&gt;&gt; and that there are far more effective and humane ways of dealing with cat
&gt;&gt; behavior.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; First mistake. Declawing is *not* a simple surgery. It involves the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; removal of not only the claw but the entire first knuckle. Take your
&gt;&gt; hand
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; off the keyboard for a moment. Look at the fingers on your right
&gt; hand.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Now imagine someone cutting them *all* off at the first knuckle. Now
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; imagine functioning without them. How do you think it would feel?

&gt;&gt;&gt; Taking off the first knuckle sounds pretty simple to me. A bit more
&gt;&gt; simple
&gt;&gt;&gt; than cutting into the abdomen, cutting into the fallopian tubes, and
&gt;&gt; cutting
&gt;&gt;&gt; them off. Neutering seems like the simplest of the operations but I'm
&gt;&gt; sure
&gt;&gt;&gt; an operation to the genetals is at least as painful as an operation to
&gt; the
&gt;&gt;&gt; feet.

&gt;&gt; I've had a tubal ligation, and I know women who have had to have
&gt;&gt; hysterectomies. Given the choice between performing *ten separate
&gt;&gt; amputations* in order to remove the tips of our fingers and thumbs or
&gt; having
&gt;&gt; abdominal surgery for valid health reasons, which do you really think we
&gt;&gt; might have sprung for?

&gt;&gt;&lt;snipped&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; You can't compare losing knuckles in a human being to losing knuckles in
&gt; a
&gt;&gt;&gt; cat. Humans need their hands and fingers for most things they do
&gt; (eating,
&gt;&gt;&gt; drinking, driving a car, keyboard, remote control). A cat doesn't need
&gt;&gt;&gt; their fingers for any of this. I've seen people who've lost fingers in
&gt;&gt;&gt; accidents, and even as important as fingers are to human beings, they
&gt;&gt; still
&gt;&gt;&gt; live happy lives. Same with many people in wheelchairs.

&gt;&gt; Cats do need their claws, just as humans need their fingers. If they
&gt; didn't
&gt;&gt; need them, they wouldn't have them. Cats keep the muscles in their legs,
&gt;&gt; back and shoulders in shape by clawing--the stretching and pulling they
&gt;&gt; engage in while clawing keeps the muscles toned. They mark their
&gt;&gt; territories by clawing, not simply with visual evidence, but also with
&gt;&gt; scent--there are scent glands in their paws that can only release their
&gt; odor
&gt;&gt; through clawing.

&gt;&gt; If a cat can't mark its territory by clawing, it will very often resort to
&gt;&gt; urinating. I have a friend who got a wonderful cat from the local animal
&gt;&gt; shelter; after her previous owner had her declawed she was still dumped
&gt;&gt; because she began peeing on the furniture that was supposed to be saved by
&gt;&gt; having her claws removed.

&gt;&gt; Claws are also there for defense--if a declawed cat gets outside it is
&gt;&gt; automatically at a great diasdvantage, not only agains other cats, but
&gt;&gt; raccoons and other animals as well. They don't even have the option of
&gt;&gt; racing up a tree to get away from danger. Unless you live in an urban
&gt;&gt; high-rise apartment with very controlled access, there is *always* a
&gt; chance
&gt;&gt; that the cat will get out. If you're lucky, you'll be home and able to
&gt; get
&gt;&gt; her back inside.

&gt;&gt; The argument that a cat &quot;doesn't need its claws&quot; is based in ignorance of
&gt;&gt; cat behavior. Unfortunately, too many people get cats and never make an
&gt;&gt; effort to find out what makes that

&gt;allergic reactions to anesthesia but that is very rare as well.

"/> You are basing this on talking to 3 Vets?? That is *so* laughable.

And I didn't know Vets got declawed :))

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;In other words, it's *inconvenient for you* to clip her claws, so she
&gt;should
&gt;&gt;be the one to suffer?
&gt;That is a *very* hasty assumption. Convenience hasn't been the issue,
&gt;her painful anguish and resentment is. After clipping she is usually so
&gt;worked up and sick to her stomach that she just lays there, sleeps, and
&gt;feels horrible. This isn't in the cat's best interest (or mine). Would
&gt;be easier for her if they were just gotten rid of all at once and never
&gt;had to deal with a lifetime of torturous clipping sessions.

"/> As I suggested in a previous post, try Soft Paws. No clipping and none of
your precious furniture needs to be touched.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;find another way to do it--having someone else hold
&gt;&gt;her while she is wrapped firmly in a towel, one leg outside the towel
&gt;&gt;at a time, might help.
&gt;again, this is more convenient for me, but not the cat

"/> If you're so worried about &quot;convenience&quot; for the cat, why on earth are you
even debating getting them declawed??

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;I can tell that you don't have a clue what makes her tick or
&gt;&gt;how to deal with it from a cat's point of view
&gt;That's not an insult, I know I don't know very much. That is why I
&gt;asked the question in the first place. But I think that you on the
&gt;other hand assume you know what makes a cat tick or how to deal with
&gt;things from a cat's point of view and really don't know much more than
&gt;me.

"/> I think you asked the question to inflame. However, I think the majority
of people on these ngs have remained calm and tried to tell you the truth.
But you aren't just here to ask a question - you have made it pretty clear
that you've already decided to get your cats declawed and just want to
fight. I feel very sad for your kitties ...

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;A cat is not a toy, or an animate object that can simply be manipulated
&gt;&gt;at will. A cat is not a toy, or an animate object that can simply be
&gt;manipulated at
&gt;&gt;will. It's not a little meat puppet, there simply to make you happy.
&gt;&gt;It has a life and consciousness and way of relating to the world that
&gt;&gt;is very unique, but hardly unfathomable. If she's clawing the
&gt;&gt;furniture and doing things you don't want her to do, it is not because
&gt;&gt;she is spiteful, or playing mind games, or stupid--she is simply a cat,
&gt;&gt;doing what cats do, and you need to be able to offer her a reasonable
&gt;&gt;alternative from a cat point of view.
&gt;duh, *sigh* Which is exactly why many people are forced to resort to
&gt;declawing in order to correct their scratching problem. There usually
&gt;isn't any other way. Other problems resulting from declawing is so rare
&gt;that it isn't even worth bringing up in an unbiased discussion.

"/> Scratching is not a &quot;problem&quot;!! It's a natural behaviour!!

Ummm, the problems resulting from declawing are niether rare nor
insignificant. And in any truly unbiased discussion, *all* possible risks
*should* be raised.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;training her to use a scratching post
&gt;useless, she won't even look at the thing (even placed right by her
&gt;food).

"/> Placing it near her food *is* useless. Try putting it near the furniture
that you say she is destroying. And put some catnip spray on it to attract
her to it. You'll find she prefers it to the furniture I'm almost sure.

(John) purred the following:

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;Well, by the sound of this and your other posts over the last couple of
&gt;&gt;days, post you probably *are* a troll ... however ...
&gt;I think my original post asked for no flaming. Trolls are generally the
&gt;one who flame and call others names. if you want to take a look at
&gt;previous posts, look here:
&gt;http://www.deja.com/profile.xp?author ... @wd.net
&gt;for flame free posts on which is the friendliest type of cat,
&gt;littermaid, World's Best Cat Litter, and others.

"/> Trolls sometimes do post good messages (just ask Frank). And I did read
your post. But you seem to be taking no notice whatsoever of anything
anyone is saying. You just keep on spouting off about the benefits of
declawing. If you were truly here to be educated you would accept at least
some of the things people are saying.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;Did you do what I suggested?? Sure, cats don't use their paws for
&gt;&gt;typing or writing - only to WALK!!!!!!
&gt;Check that, since declawed cats *do* indeed walk, and with no real
&gt;problems, they don't use them to walk.

"/> Yes, and some walk with pain for the rest of their lives. Have you heard
of a desexing surgery that caused life-long pain? Sure none of the cats
you have known previously have had it, but how would you like your cat to
be the first? How would it feel to you every day that you did this to her
for your *own* convenience?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;I gave in my last post the many, good
&gt;&gt;reasons why desexing is for the good of the cat and the good of all the
&gt;&gt;kittens that he/she might produce if left undesexed.
&gt;I don't think your cat would feel the same way.

"/> So helping to prevent disease in the cat (sexually transmitted and cancer)
and helping to cut down on the number of euthanaised cats wouldn't make my
cat feel better if she could understand? And how much does a declawed cat
understand when she is laid up for at least two days, not being able to
walk, and then has to modify her behaviour because of something that an
uncaring owner has done?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;I know from my many friends in the States that the recovery
&gt;&gt;time is very long.
&gt;I know from my friends, and a cat I had when I was little, that the time
&gt;to recover is very short.

"/> Then your friends have been very lucky.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; *any* surgery done simply for
&gt;&gt;convenience that lays a cat out for a couple of days is disgusting!!!!
&gt;That is a matter of your personal view, my cat is usually off her feet
&gt;and sleeping most of the time anyway.

"/> That's not the point!! Any surgery that is so major as to lay a cat up for
two days is really bad. If it is done for good, sound reasons, I could
understand it. But this is done *purely* for your own convenience - there
is *no* advantage to the cat at all.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;So what is more important - your cats health or your furniture?
&gt;I'm not talking about my cat in specific. What's more important, that a
&gt;cat have claws or be abandoned (or possibly destroyed)?

"/> Why is this necessarily so?? Here in Australia millions own cats (or are
owned by them more to the point) and not a *single* one is declawed. And
your argument was???

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;Then this is *very* sad. To make a mutilation routine ....
&gt;They obviously don't see it that way. I could say it is very sad they
&gt;offer spaying and neutering in packages as routine because it is
&gt;mutilation as well.

"/> But there are good, sound medical reasons for doing it. There is only one
reason to declaw and that's for the convenience of the owner.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;And why can't a clawed cat make a happy home??
&gt;They definitely can, but you should know that for many people they don't

"/> Wrong!! The majority of cats worldwide are *not* declawed. It seems to be
a North American phenomenum.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;Have you heard of a product called &quot;Soft Paws&quot;? They are small, soft
&gt;&gt;things that you glue over the top of the claws. They last for several
&gt;&gt;weeks apparently. They stop all scratching but the cat still thinks it
&gt;&gt;*can* scratch so it doesn't bite. Sounds like the perfect solution to
&gt;&gt;me!

&gt;&gt;At least give something non-surgical like this a try, okay??
&gt;I have been trying many things and I have no plans to have her declawing
&gt;*anytime* soon. I was just wondering why people view declawing as
&gt;mutilation and desexing not as mutilation (many people believe desexing
&gt;is essential). Like I said before, my question was out of curiosity and
&gt;not geared towards my specific case.

"/> So are you going to try Soft Paws? If you are truly asking this question
for the purpose of education, then I have provided you with a non-surgical
solution to your problem. If you are not a troll, then you will give them
a go (and not for five minutes either).

Desexing is essential if we want to help with the cat overpopulation
problem and try to keep disease in the cat to a minimum. Declawing is
*ver, very* rarely essential.

You think you are being flamed!! Huh!! You haven't been around on cat
newgroups very long have you??? I am simply stating facts. I didn't
scream at you or call you names. I am providing facts that you are
choosing to ignore, or are replying with &quot;that's not the case&quot; type answers
where you have nothing to back it up.

Whilst licking their paws in alt.animals.cat on 11 Oct 2000, j ... @wd.net
(John) purred the following:

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; If we are now talking evolution... human appendixes are (it is
&gt;&gt; thought)
&gt;the
&gt;&gt; remnants of a fibre digesting organ, similar to one in rabbits. So it
&gt;&gt; did have a purpose once. And tonsils *do* have a very important
&gt;&gt; function -
&gt;the
&gt;&gt; stopping of bacteria and virii getting further into the respiratory
&gt;&gt; tract. That's why people who've had their tonsils removed sometimes
&gt;&gt; develop many more chest infections.
&gt;Yes we are talking evolution, at one time cats needed their claws, but
&gt;they don't anymore as indoor house pets.

"/> Evolution is a process that takes thousands of years (now I am a
creationist in reality, but I have studies evolution). Keeping cats
indoors is a fairly recent adaptation. They can't &quot;grow out&quot; of natural
behaviours in just a few generations. In 1000 years time perhaps cats
won't feel the need to claw things.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;They mark their territories by clawing, not simply with visual
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;evidence,
&gt;&gt;&gt;but also with scent--there are scent glands in their
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;paws that can only release their odor through clawing.
&gt;&gt;&gt;An indoor cat has no use for this.

&gt;&gt; But it is still a natural behaviour that can't be stopped.
&gt;Yes it can, by declawing.

"/> Yes, by mutilating a cat with a surgery simply for the convenience of the
owner.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Wrong!! Why then are there millions of happy cat owners in Australia?
&gt;&gt; Here the barbaric practice is *banned* so fools like you have the
&gt;&gt; choice
&gt;of
&gt;&gt; putting up with the claws or not owning a cat.
&gt;There is a *huge* problem with homeless feral cats in Austrailia.
&gt;Declawing is banned in Australia. Coincidence? I think for the most
&gt;part the feral problem has to do with Australia's delicate ecosystem,
&gt;but not being able to declaw them has to play at least a small role.

"/> The feral problem in Australia stems directly from cat owners reluctance to
desex. The majority of cats that are abandoned here are the result of
kittens that couldn't find homes and as there are very few no-euthanaise
shelters people believe the cats will be better off living wild than dead.

People don't even think about declawing in Australia. It's just accepted.
Landlords do sometimes have &quot;no pet&quot; policies - but it goes for dogs, and
birds, not just cats. So it's not for the clawing - more likely it's
because of inappropriate elimination. Do you know what people with pets
who rent do in this situation? They find somewhere else to live!

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;You don't necessarily
&gt;&gt;&gt;have to *do* anything to get clawed by a cat.

&gt;&gt;Yes you do. The cat has to be upset about something to cause it to
&gt;&gt;claw - particularly badly enough to draw blood.
&gt;My cat will claw when she's happy (usually purring at the same time) or
&gt;feeling playful.

"/> My cats claw when they are &quot;making bread&quot; ... but never hard enough to draw
blood. In fact it's never hard enough to even make a scratch.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;Again with the &quot;my furniture is more important than the cat&quot;!
&gt;You are assuming that you must pick one over the other, declawing makes
&gt;it so you don't have to.

"/> So you are picking mutilating and causing pain (definately in the short
term, possibly in the long term) over your furniture? Sounds like a
*really* tough decision ...

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;Vets who perform declawing surgeries without a medical reason *don't*
&gt;&gt;care for cats IMHO.
&gt;There are many vets who came into the field because of their love for
&gt;animals that do perform the surgury and would be quite upset to see
&gt;someone assume they do not care for cats.

"/> Yes, most Vets do originally come into the field with a love of animals.
But sometimes a love of money takes over. Those who really care for cats
would only perform declawing surgeries if there was a medical reason for
it.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;If you're so worried about &quot;convenience&quot; for the cat, why on earth are
&gt;&gt;you even debating getting them declawed??
&gt;Like I said. Get them all taken off at once and never have to subject
&gt;them to another torturous claw clipping session.

"/> Well I've never had a cat that complained too much about being clipped
(although I don't do them now because there's no reason to). But I don't
doubt that there are some cats who may not enjoy it. That is why I
suggested Soft Paws. A suggestion I've now made several times and you've
jsut ignored. It will not upset the cat (like you say the clipping does)
and it won't cause long term problems.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;I think you asked the question to inflame. However, I think the
&gt;&gt;majority of people on these ngs have remained calm and tried to tell

&gt;Another hasty assumption, and another flame. I have no plans to get my
&gt;cat declawed, I have thought about it but not decided to at the moment
&gt;(or anytime in the near future). I asked the question because I was
&gt;curious about why people thought declawing was mutilation and desexing
&gt;is not (and desexing is praised). NOT in flame (like you have resorted
&gt;to).

"/> How was this a flame??? I simply stated the fact that you seem to just
want to argue the virtues (as you see them) of declawing without taking one
blind bit of notice of the many, many reasons people have given you as to
why it's bad.

I'm not a flamer and never have been.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;Scratching is not a &quot;problem&quot;!! It's a natural behaviour!!
&gt;It is a natural behavior that is a problem.

"/> Then try the non-surgical means of correcting this &quot;problem&quot; before
resorting to mutilation.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;Ummm, the problems resulting from declawing are niether rare nor
&gt;&gt;insignificant. And in any truly unbiased discussion, *all* possible
&gt;&gt;risks *should* be raised.
&gt;Then why haven't you raised the possible risks for desexing (urinary
&gt;tract infections, long recovery, complications, etc.)

"/> I haven't known of any problems with recovery time in desexing, except
where the cat was pregnant when the surgery was done. There was some
evidence many years ago about the increased risk of FUS in desexed males.
Since the introduction of recommendations regarding the feeding of cats dry
food and better neutering procedures, this has all but vanished.

And of course, like any major surgery, there may be complications. But the
risk to the cat by being undesexed is *much* greater than the risk of
complications. The same cannot be said for declawing.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;Placing it near her food *is* useless. Try putting it near the

&gt;She isn't destroying my furniture. You are relating this question to me
&gt;again and making hasty assumptions again. Many other cats *do* destroy
&gt;furniture though.

"/> So if she's not destroying your furniture, why on earth are you even asking
this question??????????????????

I think declawing is perfectly acceptable. I've had two of my three
declawed (the first cat was already declawed when I got him) and I never had
a problem. People think it is cruel to declaw, but I think it is more cruel
to leave a cat at a shelter in a cage than giving it a nice home minus the
claws. Half the people who don't believe in declawing let their cats
outside - I think that is more cruel because it puts the cat in danger and
is an even bigger, thoughtless think to do as a pet owner!

Letting them outside (while I don't agree with it) doesn't put your animal
in any direct danger. Declawing gives your cat tremendous pain and the
possibility of lifelong complications.

Most people who declaw would adopt if they couldn't. It doesn't save any
cats from going to good homes. There are plenty of declawed cats that are
abandoned too. So they don't keep their homes either.

You don't necessarily have to *do* anything to a cat to get badly scratched.
Mine baby tried to jump up on my lap and missed. He hung on to my leg with
his claws and refused to let go because probably he was scared and a little
disconcerted by not landing where he thought he was going to land. I grabbed
him to keep him from falling (he was less than a foot off the floor) and
clinging harder with his claws, but the damage was done. The scratches were
so deep, I had to have stitches and will likely have permanent scars. I'm
not saying it was his fault, but I didn't *do* anything to him to make him
scratch me so badly. My point is sometimes cats scratch when they don't
necessarily mean to, but that doesn't makes it any less bad for the human.

&gt; What are you *doing* to the cat that would cause you to have &quot;arms scraped
&gt; up and bleeding from claw marks?&quot; I have five cats, and it is very rare for
&gt; me to get scratched; it usually only happens if something startles a cat
&gt; while I am holding it. And as for bites being better--have you ever been
&gt; bitten (and I mean really bitten, not just nipped) by a cat? You can get
&gt; one hell of a nasty infection from a single deep cat bite, the sort that
&gt; lands you in the hospital with IV antibiotics.

&gt; Dr. Nicholas Dodman, Professor of Behavioral Pharmacology and Director of
&gt; the Behavior Clinic at Tufts University School of Veterinary Medicine and
&gt; internationally known specialist in domestic animal behavioral research,
&gt; explains declawing and *confirms* your statement:

&gt;&quot;The inhumanity of the procedure is clearly demonstrated by the nature of
&gt; cats' recovery from anesthesia following the surgery. Unlike routine
&gt; recoveries, including recovery from neutering surgeries, which are fairly
&gt; peaceful, declawing
&gt; surgery results in cats bouncing off the walls of the recovery cage
because
&gt; of excruciating pain. Cats that are more stoic huddle in the corner of the
&gt; recovery cage, immobilized in a state of helplessness, presumably by
&gt; overwhelming pain.
&gt; Declawing fits the dictionary definition of mutilation to a tee. Words
such
&gt; as deform, disfigure, disjoint, and dismember all apply to this surgery.
&gt; Partial digital amputation is so horrible that it has been employed for
&gt; torture of prisoners of war, and in veterinary medicine, the clinical
&gt; procedure serves as model of severe pain for testing the efficacy of
&gt; analgesic drugs. Even though analgesic drugs can be used postoperatively,
&gt; they rarely are, and their effects are incomplete and transient anyway, so
&gt; sooner or later the pain will emerge.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt; On the myths of declawing:

&gt;&gt;&gt; 1)I've never seen a declawed cat have a problem with balance (and I've
&gt;&gt; seen
&gt;&gt;&gt; quite a few)

&gt;&gt;&gt; 2)Complications with declawing are so rare that I've never even heard
of
&gt;&gt; one
&gt;&gt;&gt; from anyone I've ever known that has had a cat or even any vets I've
&gt;&gt; talked
&gt;&gt;&gt; to. They are probably just as rare as complications with spaying or
&gt;&gt;&gt; neutering. Complications due to anesthesia required in he operations
&gt; are
&gt;&gt;&gt; the most common and I've never heard of that either (besides from a
vet
&gt;&gt; who
&gt;&gt;&gt; said it's happened once). Talk to your vet and find out f he or she
has
&gt;&gt;&gt; ever seen a complication due to declawing.

&gt;&gt;&gt; 3)Cats can still stretch if they've been declawed and they can live
just
&gt;&gt; as
&gt;&gt;&gt; long as those who haven't been declawed.

&gt;&gt;&gt; 4)Cats don't live a life of depression just because they don't have
&gt; claws.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Good post Vicki.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; On the subject of desexing, all of my cats are spayed/neutered. None
&gt;&gt; have
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; suffered ANY ill effects. In fact, a couple of the females were
&gt; tearing
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; round fit to burst their stitches as soon as they got home. One tom
&gt; was
&gt;&gt; a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; little bothered for a couple of days, the other not at all.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Now, as to declawing, I replied to a previous post, the transcript
of
&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; whole post being as follows below (please read from the bottom up).
I
&gt;&gt; know
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I'd much prefer carpets and furniture that resemble worn out
&gt; pincushions
&gt;&gt;&gt; and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; happy cats, than declaw them. Isn't this part of the fun of having
&gt; cats
&gt;&gt; ?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Transcript follows :-

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I had no idea it was THAT bad. I'm even more against it now. Thanks
&gt; for
&gt;&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; information. I hope that people who are considering declawing read
&gt; this
&gt;&gt;&gt; and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; see just how much suffereing they will cause.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Right!
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The nail is actually extended directly from the bone itself. In
&gt; fact
&gt;&gt; it
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; not too uncommon for vets who do not cut enough of the bone off to
&gt;&gt; have
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; claw start growing back. The problem is it grow through the skin
&gt; that
&gt;&gt;&gt; has
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; healed OVER the cut off part of the toe. When this happens it
&gt; almost
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; always
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; results in severe infection and ultimately leads the kitty back to
&gt; get
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; de-clawed all over again to stop the infection.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The other problem with declawing is the kitty supports much of
it's
&gt;&gt;&gt; weight
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; with the claw part of the toe. Just like you and I extend a
&gt;&gt; significant
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; portion of our weight onto out toes when we walk. Cats do the
same
&gt;&gt;&gt; thing
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; but their claws are their toes. After de-clawing the entire
posture
&gt;&gt; of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; cat is changed to an unnatural form. This often leads to back,
leg
&gt;&gt; and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; hip
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; problems later in life because the cat has tried to compensate by
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; adjusting
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; itself to an unnatural walk and stance.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; One other problem is a cat needs to stretch it's back and legs
&gt; almost
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; every
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; day. You've seen your cat when it first wakes up arch his back
real
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; sharply
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; upward, then almost as sharply downward. While they are doing
this
&gt;&gt;&gt; their
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; claws are anchored into whatever they are standing on. If they do
&gt; not
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; have
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; claws they cannot anchor themselves. This seriously reduces the
&gt;&gt; amount
&gt;&gt;&gt; of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; stretching they can do. This also often leads to problems later
in
&gt;&gt;&gt; life.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; also, technically -from what i've read- it's more like chopping
&gt; off
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; your finger tips since the claw is connected to the bone
(right?)

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Whilst licking their paws in alt.animals.cat on 09 Oct 2000,
&gt;&gt; j ... @wd.net
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (John) purred the following:

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I don't mean to drag this into a huge debate with flaming and
such
&gt;&gt; but
&gt;&gt;&gt; I

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Then you are asking entirely the wrong question. My first
instinct
&gt;&gt; was
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that you are a troll, simply here to start a flame war. Then I
&gt;&gt;&gt; wondered,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; what if you aren't? What if you are genuine? Then you need to
hear
&gt;&gt;&gt; both
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; sides of the story.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You won't hear any flames from me, but you will hear the truth and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; sometimes the truth hurts.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;am curious as to why the consensus here is that desexing your cat
&gt; in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;great and humane, makes them better pets and such, but when the
&gt;&gt; subject
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;turns to declawing, people believe that it is brutal mutilation.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;They are both relatively simple surgeries and can have risks
&gt; involved

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; First mistake. Declawing is *not* a simple surgery. It involves
&gt; the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; removal of not only the claw but the entire first knuckle. Take
&gt; your
&gt;&gt;&gt; hand
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; off the keyboard for a moment. Look at the fingers on your right
&gt;&gt; hand.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Now imagine someone cutting them *all* off at the first knuckle.
&gt; Now
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; imagine functioning without them. How do you think it would feel?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You cannot compare it to a desexing operation. Millions of women
&gt;&gt; around
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the world every year have hysterectomies. They all live happy and
&gt;&gt;&gt; healthy
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; lives afterwards. How many people would go on happily without any
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; knuckles
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; on either hand? And sometimes the first joint of the toes as
well?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;(the anesthetic alone is a risk), the cat hates having any of the
&gt;&gt; parts
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;removed, and the cat generally recovers in a few days to a couple
&gt;&gt;&gt; weeks.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Second mistake. If the desexing surgery is done at a fairly young
&gt;&gt; age,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; most females recover within a couple of days (except for the
&gt; stitches
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; which
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; come out in ten days) and males within 24 hours. For early age
&gt;&gt;&gt; neutering
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (at about 8 weeks) the recovery time is even less. Declawing can
&gt; take
&gt;&gt;&gt; up
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to six weeks for full recovery.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I've read the anti-declawing websites and find them to be a
little
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;biased, most knowledgeable veterinarians dislike having the
&gt; declawing
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;procedure done but believe the cats will be better off as a
better
&gt;&gt; pet
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;that isn't

&gt; choosing to ignore, or are replying with &quot;that's not the case&quot; type
answers
&gt; where you have nothing to back it up.

&gt; Whilst licking their paws in alt.animals.cat on 11 Oct 2000, j ... @wd.net
&gt; (John) purred the following:

&gt;&gt;&gt; If we are now talking evolution... human appendixes are (it is
&gt;&gt;&gt; thought)
&gt;&gt;the
&gt;&gt;&gt; remnants of a fibre digesting organ, similar to one in rabbits. So it
&gt;&gt;&gt; did have a purpose once. And tonsils *do* have a very important
&gt;&gt;&gt; function -
&gt;&gt;the
&gt;&gt;&gt; stopping of bacteria and virii getting further into the respiratory
&gt;&gt;&gt; tract. That's why people who've had their tonsils removed sometimes
&gt;&gt;&gt; develop many more chest infections.
&gt;&gt;Yes we are talking evolution, at one time cats needed their claws, but
&gt;&gt;they don't anymore as indoor house pets.

&gt; Evolution is a process that takes thousands of years (now I am a
&gt; creationist in reality, but I have studies evolution). Keeping cats
&gt; indoors is a fairly recent adaptation. They can't &quot;grow out&quot; of natural
&gt; behaviours in just a few generations. In 1000 years time perhaps cats
&gt; won't feel the need to claw things.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;They mark their territories by clawing, not simply with visual
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;evidence,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;but also with scent--there are scent glands in their
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;paws that can only release their odor through clawing.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;An indoor cat has no use for this.

&gt;&gt;&gt; But it is still a natural behaviour that can't be stopped.
&gt;&gt;Yes it can, by declawing.

&gt; Yes, by mutilating a cat with a surgery simply for the convenience of the
&gt; owner.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Wrong!! Why then are there millions of happy cat owners in Australia?
&gt;&gt;&gt; Here the barbaric practice is *banned* so fools like you have the
&gt;&gt;&gt; choice
&gt;&gt;of
&gt;&gt;&gt; putting up with the claws or not owning a cat.
&gt;&gt;There is a *huge* problem with homeless feral cats in Austrailia.
&gt;&gt;Declawing is banned in Australia. Coincidence? I think for the most
&gt;&gt;part the feral problem has to do with Australia's delicate ecosystem,
&gt;&gt;but not being able to declaw them has to play at least a small role.

&gt; The feral problem in Australia stems directly from cat owners reluctance
to
&gt; desex. The majority of cats that are abandoned here are the result of
&gt; kittens that couldn't find homes and as there are very few no-euthanaise
&gt; shelters people believe the cats will be better off living wild than dead.

&gt; People don't even think about declawing in Australia. It's just accepted.
&gt; Landlords do sometimes have &quot;no pet&quot; policies - but it goes for dogs, and
&gt; birds, not just cats. So it's not for the clawing - more likely it's
&gt; because of inappropriate elimination. Do you know what people with pets
&gt; who rent do in this situation? They find somewhere else to live!

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;You don't necessarily
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;have to *do* anything to get clawed by a cat.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Yes you do. The cat has to be upset about something to cause it to
&gt;&gt;&gt;claw - particularly badly enough to draw blood.
&gt;&gt;My cat will claw when she's happy (usually purring at the same time) or
&gt;&gt;feeling playful.

&gt; My cats claw when they are &quot;making bread&quot; ... but never hard enough to
draw
&gt; blood. In fact it's never hard enough to even make a scratch.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Again with the &quot;my furniture is more important than the cat&quot;!
&gt;&gt;You are assuming that you must pick one over the other, declawing makes
&gt;&gt;it so you don't have to.

&gt; So you are picking mutilating and causing pain (definately in the short
&gt; term, possibly in the long term) over your furniture? Sounds like a
&gt; *really* tough decision ...

&gt;&gt;&gt;Vets who perform declawing surgeries without a medical reason *don't*
&gt;&gt;&gt;care for cats IMHO.
&gt;&gt;There are many vets who came into the field because of their love for
&gt;&gt;animals that do perform the surgury and would be quite upset to see
&gt;&gt;someone assume they do not care for cats.

&gt; Yes, most Vets do originally come into the field with a love of animals.
&gt; But sometimes a love of money takes over. Those who really care for cats
&gt; would only perform declawing surgeries if there was a medical reason for
&gt; it.

&gt;&gt;&gt;If you're so worried about &quot;convenience&quot; for the cat, why on earth are
&gt;&gt;&gt;you even debating getting them declawed??
&gt;&gt;Like I said. Get them all taken off at once and never have to subject
&gt;&gt;them to another torturous claw clipping session.

&gt; Well I've never had a cat that complained too much about being clipped
&gt; (although I don't do them now because there's no reason to). But I don't
&gt; doubt that there are some cats who may not enjoy it. That is why I
&gt; suggested Soft Paws. A suggestion I've now made several times and you've
&gt; jsut ignored. It will not upset the cat (like you say the clipping does)
&gt; and it won't cause long term problems.

&gt;&gt;&gt;I think you asked the question to inflame. However, I think the
&gt;&gt;&gt;majority of people on these ngs have remained calm and tried to tell
&gt;&gt;&gt;you the truth. But you aren't just here to ask a question - you have
&gt;&gt;&gt;made it pretty clear that you've already decided to get your cats
&gt;&gt;&gt;declawed and just want to fight. I feel very sad for your kitties ...
&gt;&gt;Another hasty assumption, and another flame. I have no plans to get my
&gt;&gt;cat declawed, I have thought about it but not decided to at the moment
&gt;&gt;(or anytime in the near future). I asked the question because I was
&gt;&gt;curious about why people thought declawing was mutilation and desexing
&gt;&gt;is not (and desexing is praised). NOT in flame (like you have resorted
&gt;&gt;to).

&gt; How was this a flame??? I simply stated the fact that you seem to just
&gt; want to argue the virtues (as you see them) of declawing without taking
one
&gt; blind bit of notice of the many, many reasons people have given you as to
&gt; why it's bad.

&gt; I'm not a flamer and never have been.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Scratching is not a &quot;problem&quot;!! It's a natural behaviour!!
&gt;&gt;It is a natural behavior that is a problem.

&gt; Then try the non-surgical means of correcting this &quot;problem&quot; before
&gt; resorting to mutilation.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Ummm, the problems resulting from declawing are niether rare nor
&gt;&gt;&gt;insignificant. And in any truly unbiased discussion, *all* possible
&gt;&gt;&gt;risks *should* be raised.
&gt;&gt;Then why haven't you raised the possible risks for desexing (urinary
&gt;&gt;tract infections, long recovery, complications, etc.)

&gt; I haven't known of any problems with recovery time in desexing, except
&gt; where the cat was pregnant when the surgery was done. There was some
&gt; evidence many years ago about the increased risk of FUS in desexed males.
&gt; Since the introduction of recommendations regarding the feeding of cats
dry
&gt; food and better neutering procedures, this has all but vanished.

&gt; And of course, like any major surgery, there may be complications. But
the
&gt; risk to the cat by being undesexed is *much* greater than the risk of
&gt; complications. The same cannot be said for declawing.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Placing it near her food *is* useless. Try putting it near the
&gt;&gt;&gt;furniture that you say she is destroying. And put some catnip spray on
&gt;&gt;&gt;it to attract her to it. You'll find she prefers it to the furniture
&gt;&gt;&gt;I'm almost sure.
&gt;&gt;She isn't destroying my furniture. You are relating this question to me
&gt;&gt;again and making hasty assumptions again. Many other cats *do* destroy
&gt;&gt;furniture though.

&gt; So if she's not destroying your furniture, why on earth are you even
asking
&gt; this question??????????????????

&gt;&gt;&gt;Well, by the sound of this and your other posts over the last couple of
&gt;&gt;&gt;days, post you probably *are* a troll ... however ...
&gt;&gt;I think my original post asked for no flaming. Trolls are generally the
&gt;&gt;one who flame and call others names. if you want to take a look at
&gt;&gt;previous posts, look here:
&gt;&gt;http://www.deja.com/profile.xp?author ... @wd.net
&gt;&gt;for flame free posts on which is the friendliest type of cat,
&gt;&gt;littermaid, World's Best Cat Litter, and others.

&gt; Trolls sometimes do post good messages (just ask Frank). And I did read
&gt; your post. But you seem to be taking no notice whatsoever of anything
&gt; anyone is saying. You just keep on spouting off about the benefits of
&gt; declawing. If you were truly here to be educated you would accept at
least
&gt; some of the things people are saying.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Did you do what I suggested?? Sure, cats don't use their paws for
&gt;&gt;&gt;typing or writing - only to WALK!!!!!!
&gt;&gt;Check that, since declawed cats *do* indeed walk, and with no real
&gt;&gt;problems, they don't use them to walk.

&gt; Yes, and some walk with pain for the rest of their lives. Have you heard
&gt; of a desexing surgery that caused life-long pain? Sure none of the cats
&gt; you have known previously have had it, but how would you like your cat to
&gt; be the first? How would it feel to you every day that you did this to her
&gt; for your *own* convenience?

&gt;&gt;&gt;I gave in my last post the many, good
&gt;&gt;&gt;reasons why desexing is for the good of the cat and the good of all the
&gt;&gt;&gt;kittens that he/she might produce if left undesexed.
&gt;&gt;I don't think your cat would feel the same way.

&gt; So helping to prevent disease in the cat (sexually transmitted and cancer)
&gt; and helping to cut down on the number of euthanaised cats wouldn't make my
&gt; cat feel better if she could understand? And how much does a declawed cat
&gt; understand when she is laid up for at least two days, not being able to
&gt; walk, and then has to modify her behaviour because of something that an
&gt; uncaring owner has done?

&gt;&gt;&gt;I know from my many friends in the States that the recovery
&gt;&gt;&gt;time is very long.
&gt;&gt;I know from my friends, and a cat I had when I was little, that the time
&gt;&gt;to recover is very short.

&gt; Then your friends have been very lucky.

&gt;&gt;&gt; *any* surgery done simply for
&gt;&gt;&gt;convenience that lays a cat out for a couple of days is disgusting!!!!
&gt;&gt;That is a matter of your personal view, my cat is usually off her feet
&gt;&gt;and sleeping most of the time anyway.

&gt; That's not the point!! Any surgery that is so major as to lay a cat up
for
&gt; two days is really bad. If it is done for good, sound reasons, I could
&gt; understand it. But this is done *purely* for your own convenience - there
&gt; is *no* advantage to the cat at all.

&gt;&gt;&gt;So what is more important - your cats health or your furniture?
&gt;&gt;I'm not talking about my cat in specific. What's more important, that a
&gt;&gt;cat have claws or be abandoned (or possibly destroyed)?

&gt; Why is this necessarily so?? Here in Australia millions own cats (or are
&gt; owned by them more to the point) and not a *single* one is declawed. And
&gt; your argument was???

&gt;&gt;&gt;Then this is *very* sad. To make a mutilation routine ....
&gt;&gt;They obviously don't see it that way. I could say it is very sad they
&gt;&gt;offer spaying and neutering in packages as routine because it is
&gt;&gt;mutilation as well.

&gt; But there are good, sound medical reasons for doing it. There is only one
&gt; reason to declaw and that's for the convenience of the owner.

&gt;&gt;&gt;And why can't a clawed cat make a happy home??
&gt;&gt;They definitely can, but you should know that for many people they don't

&gt; Wrong!! The majority of cats worldwide are *not* declawed. It seems to
be
&gt; a North American phenomenum.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Have you heard of a product called &quot;Soft Paws&quot;? They are small, soft
&gt;&gt;&gt;things that you glue over the top of the claws. They last for several
&gt;&gt;&gt;weeks apparently. They stop all scratching but the cat still thinks it
&gt;&gt;&gt;*can* scratch so it doesn't bite. Sounds like the perfect solution to
&gt;&gt;&gt;me!

&gt;&gt;&gt;At least give something non-surgical like this a try, okay??
&gt;&gt;I have been trying many things and I have no plans to have her declawing
&gt;&gt;*anytime* soon. I was just wondering why people view declawing as
&gt;&gt;mutilation and desexing not as mutilation (many people believe desexing
&gt;&gt;is essential). Like I said before, my question was out of curiosity and
&gt;&gt;not geared towards my specific case.

&gt; So are you going to try Soft Paws? If you are truly asking this question
&gt; for the purpose of education, then I have provided you with a non-surgical
&gt; solution to your problem. If you are not a troll, then you will give them
&gt; a go (and not for five minutes either).

&gt; Desexing is essential if we want to help with the cat overpopulation
&gt; problem and try to keep disease in the cat to a minimum. Declawing is
&gt; *ver, very* rarely essential.

I totally understand where you are coming from. I'm sure many other people
have had similar situations where they didn't necessary mishandle their cat
or provoke them in any way. Sometimes you just can't help but get scratched
if you own a cat that still has it's claws.

&gt; You don't necessarily have to *do* anything to a cat to get badly
scratched.
&gt; Mine baby tried to jump up on my lap and missed. He hung on to my leg with
&gt; his claws and refused to let go because probably he was scared and a
little
&gt; disconcerted by not landing where he thought he was going to land. I
grabbed
&gt; him to keep him from falling (he was less than a foot off the floor) and
&gt; clinging harder with his claws, but the damage was done. The scratches
were
&gt; so deep, I had to have stitches and will likely have permanent scars. I'm
&gt; not saying it was his fault, but I didn't *do* anything to him to make him
&gt; scratch me so badly. My point is sometimes cats scratch when they don't
&gt; necessarily mean to, but that doesn't makes it any less bad for the human.

&gt;&gt; From: &quot;Baby Strange&quot;&lt;babystra ... @earthlink.net&gt;
&gt;&lt;snip&gt;

&gt;&gt; What are you *doing* to the cat that would cause you to have &quot;arms
scraped
&gt;&gt; up and bleeding from claw marks?&quot; I have five cats, and it is very rare
for
&gt;&gt; me to get scratched; it usually only happens if something startles a cat
&gt;&gt; while I am holding it. And as for bites being better--have you ever
been
&gt;&gt; bitten (and I mean really bitten, not just nipped) by a cat? You can
get
&gt;&gt; one hell of a nasty infection from a single deep cat bite, the sort that
&gt;&gt; lands you in the hospital with IV antibiotics.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;You think you are being flamed!!
&gt;&gt;&gt;I feel sorry for your kittens is definitely the type of flame I would
&gt;&gt;&gt;expect from a cat newsgroup.

&gt;&gt; That is hardly a flame!! I *do* feel sorry for any cat that is
mutilated
&gt;&gt; for no other reason than the convenience of the owner (I know I am
&gt;&gt; repeating myself, it seems I am not being heard).

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Evolution is a process that takes thousands of years
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Keeping cats indoors is a fairly recent adaptation
&gt;&gt;&gt;Cats are believed to have been domesticated for 4,000 to 5,000 years
&gt;&gt;&gt;ago, ever since the ancient Egyptians. At that time they needed their
&gt;&gt;&gt;claws, but not anymore as an indoor house cat.

&gt;&gt; Domesticated, yes. But the practice of keeping cats indoors only has
been
&gt;&gt; fairly recent - maybe the last decade or so. When cats were outdoors
&gt;&gt; mostly there certainly wasn't the desire to declaw.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;So you are picking mutilating and causing pain (definitely in the
short
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;term, possibly in the long term) over your furniture?
&gt;&gt;&gt;You could say the same thing about desexing, picking mutilation and
pain
&gt;&gt;&gt;over the small chance that they might get out and get pregnant and have
&gt;&gt;&gt;kittens.

&gt;&gt; Okay, let's look at the two scenarios.

&gt;&gt; Cat - not declawed - might scratch furniture - live normal life.
&gt;&gt; Cat - declawed - won't scratch furniture - may live life in pain.

&gt;&gt; Cat - not desexed - will get pregnant - may get disease - reduced life
&gt;&gt; expectancy.
&gt;&gt; Cat - desexed - won't get pregnant - live normal life.

&gt;&gt; How on earth can you compare the two??

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Those who really care for cats
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;would only perform declawing surgeries if there was a medical reason
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;for
&gt;&gt;&gt;it.
&gt;&gt;&gt;I disagree. If the vet believes the owner is so fed up they might
&gt;&gt;&gt;abandon or destroy it, he or she would probably do the surgery for
&gt;&gt;&gt;everybody's benefit. The vet could still care a great deal about cats.

&gt;&gt; No, truly moral Vets will advise the person to move house (if a landlord
&gt; is
&gt;&gt; demanding the desexing) or rehouse the cat. I'm sorry, but only Vets
in
&gt;&gt; it for the money do declawing surgeries.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; But the risk to the cat by being undesexed is *much* greater than
the
&gt;&gt;&gt;risk of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; complications.
&gt;&gt;&gt;How do you figure? Can you support this?

&gt;&gt; I am not going to repeat all of it again. Most of it in my other posts
&gt; you
&gt;&gt; ignored. The risk to the female cat of problems with pregnancy and
&gt; labour,
&gt;&gt; the increased risk of disease through mating and fighting, the unwanted
&gt;&gt; litters are just a couple.

&gt;&gt; You name me some benefits of declawing *besides* keeping your furniture
&gt;&gt; nice or appeasing the landlord.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; So if she's not destroying your furniture, why on earth are you even
&gt;&gt;&gt;asking
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; this question??????????????????
&gt;&gt;&gt;Out of curiosity, I am trying to learn why so many people hate one
&gt;&gt;&gt;routine mutilating procedure with a passion and love another. Phil has
&gt;&gt;&gt;made some good points, but only against declawing and most of them
apply
&gt;&gt;&gt;to desexing.

&gt;&gt; Because desexing isn't a &quot;routine mutilating procedure&quot; that's why. The
&gt;&gt; only one that applies to desexing is the use of anaesthetic - as with
&gt; *any*
&gt;&gt; surgery. And as I've already said the benefits far outweigh any risk.

&gt; don't need them for eating, driving, working, typing, changing the
channels,
&gt; etc.

"/> Yes, they do need their claws, just as humans need their fingers, and the
fact that they are not engaging in &quot;important&quot; human tasks does not make the
function of their claws any less important. You may not think a cat needs
its claws, but for many reasons it does. I explained that at some length in
my previous post.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;If they didn't need them, they wouldn't have them.
&gt; Which does a lot to explain why we have tonsils and an appendix.

"/> Human tonsils and appendixes are evolutionary leftovers, so to speak. But
cat claws still serve active functions and are necessary to a cat's
well-being, as described in my previous post.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;They mark their territories by clawing, not simply with visual evidence,
&gt; but also with scent--there are scent glands in their
&gt;&gt;paws that can only release their odor through clawing.
&gt; An indoor cat has no use for this.

"/> Not according to you, but try explaining it to the cat! An indoor cat
definitely has its own territory, and however irrational and useless you may
find it from a *human* perspective, it is still necessary from the *cat's*
point of view.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;Declawing is performed strictly to prevent the cat from
&gt;&gt;damaging furniture--there is no other reason to do it. It provides
&gt;&gt;absolutely no health benefit to the cat
&gt; A happy owner often makes for a happy (and healthy) cat. An unhappy owner
&gt; often makes for an abandoned (or dead) cat. Often a cat that destroys the
&gt; furniture makes a home unhappy. Declawing many times is the only answer.

"/> No, another answer is to find another home for a cat whose behavior you are
apparently unwilling to understand, and therefore deal with in a reasonable
and humane manner. Declawing is never the *only answer*.

I notice you've chosen not to comment on the number of declawed cats I saw
come into the shelter I once volunteered at. Apparently, even declawed,
these cats still couldn't make their owners happy. What lovely people they
must be, those who would willingly mutilate a cat's feet to save the sofa,
then haul it to the pound when it sprays the couch with urine or claws it
with its back feet while climbing up, instead...

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;What are you *doing* to the cat that would cause you to have &quot;arms
scraped
&gt;&gt;up and bleeding from claw marks?&quot;
&gt; Often just playing with a cat that has claws will result in some
formidable
&gt; scratch mark (especially Bengels who are known to play hard). My cat
likes
&gt; to stretch her claws and sink them in to furniture or carpet when she is
&gt; happy (or after eating tasty canned food). Sometimes she will sink her
&gt; claws into clothing or skin when she is happy not realizing it is painful
to
&gt; humans. Ever try bathing a cat? Or clipping a cat's nails? You would be
&gt; very lucky to get away without being scratched. Or sometimes my cat will
be
&gt; in a playful mood and swat at me (or others) when they pet her. She also
&gt; finds it especially effective to wake me up in the morning by scratching
me.
&gt; You don't necessarily have to *do* anything to get clawed by a cat.

"/> Having owned many cats over the years, I have bathed many of them, and yes,
occasionally I have been scratched, though rarely seriously. I have never
clipped a cat's nails because I have never seen any need to. Once in a
while, I have also taken a swipe when play gets out of hand, at which point
the smartest course is to realize the cat has been overstimulated and back
off until it cools off.

Occasionally I get pricked when a contented cat is &quot;kneading&quot; it's paws in
my lap, but it doesn't break the skin, is a relatively minor annoyance, and
is hardly worth declawing the cats over. If you don't like being awakened
in the morning by being scratched, you can do things to discourage that
behavior. I broke my youngest kitten of the habit of batting at my nose in
the mornings by blowing hard in his face every time he got close to mine as
I lay in bed; it was a simple thing to do, was very effective, and did not
cause him any suffering.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;And as for bites being better--have you ever been
&gt;&gt;bitten (and I mean really bitten, not just nipped) by a cat?
&gt; Didn't say bites are better, only that being scratched by a cat not
declawed
&gt; happens much more often than being bitten by a declawed cat (and cat bites
&gt; usually don't wreck furniture.

"/> Again, there are a lot of ways to avoid getting scratched, or keep the cat
from clawing the furniture. That's not to say you will never get scratched,
or that the cat won't forget and take a swipe at the couch, but with
patience, care, and some basic understanding of cats you can minimize it.
Declawing is totally unnecessary. If you can't stand the thought of your
couch being clawed at all, or of sustaining a few minor scratches
occasionally, a cat simply isn't the right pet for you.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;Declawing is also quite profitable. The same economics that leads
plastic
&gt;&gt;surgeons to perform excessive or risky procedures on human patients,
simply
&gt;&gt;because they want it, drives vets who declaw
&gt; I hope you aren't trying to say that none of these vets care for cats or
&gt; animals. They sure got into the wrong field under your views.

"/> While the vets who perform declawing surgery might profess to having great
care for animals, there is no doubt that they care for their profit margin
much more. To willingly subject a cat to that kind of pain strictly for the
sake of the owner's convenience does not show any great regard for cats, and
there are a *lot* of veterinarians that will not do declawing.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;You may not know anyone whose cat has had complications, but exactly
&gt;&gt;how many declawed cats do you know?
&gt; Veterinarians usually know quite a few declawed vets and out of the 3 I've
&gt; talked to none of them has seen a complication yet. They've seen allergic
&gt; reactions to anesthesia but that is very rare as well.

"/> You didn't answer my question--how many declawed cats do you know?

If a vet offers declawing surgery, he or she isn't exactly going to be
forthcoming about complications, especially if they involve his or her
patients. My own vet is a cat specialist who will not perform declaw
surgery, but she has seen many cats brought in to her practice with post-op
complications, as well as cats that had been declawed years before and
suffered from chronic foot problems.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;In other words, it's *inconvenient for you* to clip her claws, so she
&gt; should
&gt;&gt;be the one to suffer?
&gt; That is a *very* hasty assumption. Convenience hasn't been the issue, her
&gt; painful anguish and resentment is. After clipping she is usually so
worked
&gt; up and sick to her stomach that she just lays there, sleeps, and feels
&gt; horrible. This isn't in the cat's best interest (or mine). Would be
easier
&gt; for her if they were just gotten rid of all at once and never had to deal
&gt; with a lifetime of torturous clipping sessions.

"/> Then quit clipping her damn claws, if it's such an ordeal.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;find another way to do it--having someone else hold
&gt;&gt;her while she is wrapped firmly in a towel, one leg outside the towel at
a
&gt;&gt;time, might help.
&gt; again, this is more convenient for me, but not the cat

"/> LOL--Wrapping the cat in a towel for a few minutes while having her claws
clipped is &quot;inconvenient&quot; for her, but having her feet mutilated isn't?
That's an amazing feat of logic, John. It really is.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;I can tell that you don't have a clue what makes her tick or
&gt;&gt;how to deal with it from a cat's point of view
&gt; That's not an insult, I know I don't know very much. That is why I asked
&gt; the question in the first place. But I think that you on the other hand
&gt; assume you know what makes a cat tick or how to deal with things from a
&gt; cat's point of view and really don't know much more than me.

"/> What makes you think I don't know any more than you? I have had cats for
most of my life, and have faced all kinds of behavioral problems, from
clawing furniture, to crapping outside the box, to engaging in overly rough
play. In order to deal with those problems, I have taken the time to learn
what I could about cat behavior so that I could deal with undesirable
behaviors in a manner that was both effective and humane. I don't *assume*
what makes cats tick; in most cases I *know*, and I know because I took the
time to learn it, both through reading and observation. No, I don't know
every last thing there is to know about cat behavior--nobody does. But I at
least understand what makes a cat tick, and actively use that knowledge to
reinforce or discourage specific behaviors.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;A cat is not a toy, or an animate object that can simply be manipulated

very
&gt;&gt;unique, but hardly unfathomable. If she's clawing the furniture and
doing
&gt;&gt;things you don't want her to do, it is not because she is spiteful, or
&gt;&gt;playing mind games, or stupid--she is simply a cat, doing what cats do,
and
&gt;&gt;you need to be able to offer her a reasonable alternative from a cat
point
&gt;&gt;of view.
&gt; duh, *sigh* Which is exactly why many people are forced to resort to

isn't
&gt; any other way. Other problems resulting from declawing is so rare that it

&gt;&gt; On the myths of declawing:

&gt;&gt; 1)I've never seen a declawed cat have a problem with balance (and I've
&gt; seen
&gt;&gt; quite a few)

Well, out of my 12 cats, one is declawed. He was adopted that way from the
shelter. He DOES have problems with balance. He falls off of stuff because
he can't grab on to keep himself there. Just because you claim to not have
seen it doesn't make it a myth.

&gt;&gt; 2)Complications with declawing are so rare that I've never even heard of
&gt; one
&gt;&gt; from anyone I've ever known that has had a cat or even any vets I've
&gt; talked
&gt;&gt; to. They are probably just as rare as complications with spaying or
&gt;&gt; neutering. Complications due to anesthesia required in he operations
are
&gt;&gt; the most common and I've never heard of that either (besides from a vet
&gt; who
&gt;&gt; said it's happened once). Talk to your vet and find out f he or she has
&gt;&gt; ever seen a complication due to declawing.

Not as rare as you think. 50% have short term complications and 20% have
long term complications. I know of one cat (a friend of mine belongs to
her) who has had SO MANY problems with her feet due to declawing. The
surgery has been redone once and there is nothing she can do to fix the
mangled toes she was left with.

&gt;&gt; 3)Cats can still stretch if they've been declawed and they can live just
&gt; as
&gt;&gt; long as those who haven't been declawed.

How can they stretch if they can't hold onto something? No one said it
decreases their life span. Just life quality.

&gt;&gt; 4)Cats don't live a life of depression just because they don't have
claws.

How do you know this? I'm sure that if the tips of your fingers were cut
off, you'd spend time each day regretting it.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Good post indeed, but I disagree in almost every place. I'll tell you
why.

&gt;&gt; First mistake. Declawing is *not* a simple surgery. It involves the
&gt;&gt; removal of not only the claw but the entire first knuckle. Take your
hand
&gt;&gt; off the keyboard for a moment. Look at the fingers on your right hand.
&gt;&gt; Now imagine someone cutting them *all* off at the first knuckle. Now
&gt;&gt; imagine functioning without them. How do you think it would feel?
&gt; Taking off the first knuckle sounds pretty simple to me. A bit more
simple
&gt; than cutting into the abdomen, cutting into the fallopian tubes, and
cutting
&gt; them off. Neutering seems like the simplest of the operations but I'm
sure
&gt; an operation to the genetals is at least as painful as an operation to the
&gt; feet.

"/> Maybe the initial surgery pain is equivalent (I don't agree with this. A
spay has ONE incision to hurt. A declaw has 10) , but then again, they
don't walk on their testicles or abdomens.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; You cannot compare it to a desexing operation. Millions of women around
&gt;&gt; the world every year have hysterectomies. They all live happy and
healthy
&gt;&gt; lives afterwards. How many people would go on happily without any
&gt; knuckles
&gt;&gt; on either hand? And sometimes the first joint of the toes as well?
&gt; You can't compare losing knuckles in a human being to losing knuckles in a
&gt; cat. Humans need their hands and fingers for most things they do (eating,
&gt; drinking, driving a car, keyboard, remote control). A cat doesn't need
&gt; their fingers for any of this. I've seen people who've lost fingers in
&gt; accidents, and even as important as fingers are to human beings, they
still
&gt; live happy lives. Same with many people in wheelchairs.

"/> Yes, and humans don't walk on their hands either. Cats are digitrade. They
walk on their toes. When you amputate part of them, it can cause chronic
pain.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Second mistake. If the desexing surgery is done at a fairly young age,
&gt;&gt; most females recover within a couple of days (except for the stitches
&gt; which
&gt;&gt; come out in ten days) and males within 24 hours. For early age
neutering
&gt;&gt; (at about 8 weeks) the recovery time is even less. Declawing can take
up
&gt;&gt; to six weeks for full recovery.
&gt; This is what I mean by biased. Yes, declawing can take up to 8 full weeks
&gt; for recovery, in rare cases but most are on their feet within a couple
days
&gt; and have fully recovered by ten days. Spaying and neutering can take 8
full
&gt; weeks to recover too, in rare cases.

"/> Declawing can take a life time to recover. Chronic pain, arthritis. Every
day of their lives in pain.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Third mistake. It is well documented that cats without claws can become
&gt;&gt; habitual biters. In fact a cat without claws will be much *more*
&gt;&gt; frustrated because they can't do the things that come naturally to it -
&gt;&gt; like scratching on a scratching post or digging comfortably in it's
litter
&gt;&gt; tray.
&gt; They *can* become habitual biters, and for the most part they probably do
&gt; bite more often. But it is much better than having you arms scraped up
and
&gt; bleeding from claw marks which is more likely to happen if your cat isn't
&gt; declawed than being biten badly if your cat is declawed. Also, I've never
&gt; seen drapery, carpet, or furniture ruined by a cat biting it.

"/> You are showing a lack of knowledge here. Cat bites are VERY SERIOUS. They
are more dangerous than a few scratches. If you are bleeding from claw
marks, you must be doing something questionable to the cat.

I've seen cords and blinds ruined by cats biting them. But you know what, I
wouldn't take their teeth out for it. So what if the furniture is
scratched? It only means you've been too lazy to train them. YOUR PROBLEM,
NOT THEIRS.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Fourth mistake. Declawing is *never* routine, even in the USA where it
is
&gt;&gt; common. The majority of moral Vets will only do it in exceptional
&gt;&gt; circumstances. In Australia (where I live) declawing is banned and Vets
&gt;&gt; can be charged with animal cruelty if they perform the surgery.
&gt; In the USA it is so common that some landlords require their cats to be
&gt; dclawed before they can rent an apartment, some vets offer it in a package
&gt; along with spaying or neutering and vaccinations. An operation performed
&gt; millions of times a years, and probably more than a dozen times a year by
&gt; each vet, is definitely is routine and complications are so rare that I
have
&gt; never heard of case where a complication occurred by anyone I've known
who's
&gt; ever had a cat.

"/> It's been stated in studies that only 10% of the feline population is
declawed.

So what if it is a routine procedure? It shouldn't be! Of course vets
offer it as a package deal! It's called GREED!
Only in the US and Canada is this done. Other countries have banned the
practice. I wonder why?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Now let us compare these benefits of desexing with the benefits of
&gt;&gt; declawing.
&gt; I think you missed my point in the previous post so I'll reiterate. A
&gt; declawed cat in most cases will make for a happier home (if your cat isn't
&gt; ruining your furniture, drapery, carpet, blankets, beds, etc that is
great,
&gt; but most of the time they will). If the owners are happy, the cat will be
&gt; happy from many factors (better care, more attention, toys, better food,
&gt; bonding, etc.). If the owners are unhappy, the cat is very likely to be
&gt; resented, abandoned, given to the animal shelter, or put to death. Don't
&gt; tell me that a cat has never been abandoned or put to death over ruining
the
&gt; furniture becase last I checked behavioral problems were the #1 reason for
&gt; abandoning cats.

"/> Yes, behavioral problems may be a top reason for cats being abandoned. But
scratching furniture isn't in those top reasons. Urinating inappropriately
is. And that can be caused by litter aversion due to declawing. Biting is
a reason some people surrender their cats too.

If people are so happy with their declawed cats, then why are they in
shelters? If people can't accept animals as animals who may have some
destructive behavior, and take the time to train them, they don't deserve a
cat. If things like this make them unhappy, the cat's gonna be abandoned
anyway. They'll find another reason.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; Are these enough reasons for you to consider that perhaps declawing and
&gt;&gt; desexing should not be placed in the same catagory?
&gt; There's one more reason I've been considering declawing my cat. Clipping
&gt; her claws seems to reslove the problem for a week or two but every time I
go
&gt; to clip her claws she resents it so much, throws such a fit, and is
&gt; anguished so badly that it would almost be better just to remove them all
at
&gt; once and get it over with than to have a lifetime of clipping them with
all
&gt; the pain and angiush.

"/> Oh the pain and anguish of nail clipping. Give me a break! I've got 12
cats and I clip ALL of their nails without pain and anguish.

&gt;&gt;&gt; On the myths of declawing:

&gt;&gt;&gt; 1)I've never seen a declawed cat have a problem with balance (and I've
&gt;&gt; seen
&gt;&gt;&gt; quite a few)

&gt;&gt;&gt; 2)Complications with declawing are so rare that I've never even heard
of
&gt;&gt; one
&gt;&gt;&gt; from anyone I've ever known that has had a cat or even any vets I've
&gt;&gt; talked
&gt;&gt;&gt; to. They are probably just as rare as complications with spaying or
&gt;&gt;&gt; neutering. Complications due to anesthesia required in he operations
&gt; are
&gt;&gt;&gt; the most common and I've never heard of that either (besides from a
vet
&gt;&gt; who
&gt;&gt;&gt; said it's happened once). Talk to your vet and find out f he or she
has
&gt;&gt;&gt; ever seen a complication due to declawing.

&gt;&gt;&gt; 3)Cats can still stretch if they've been declawed and they can live
just
&gt;&gt; as
&gt;&gt;&gt; long as those who haven't been declawed.

&gt;&gt;&gt; 4)Cats don't live a life of depression just because they don't have
&gt; claws.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Good post Vicki.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; On the subject of desexing, all of my cats are spayed/neutered. None
&gt;&gt; have
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; suffered ANY ill effects. In fact, a couple of the females were
&gt; tearing
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; round fit to burst their stitches as soon as they got home. One tom
&gt; was
&gt;&gt; a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; little bothered for a couple of days, the other not at all.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Now, as to declawing, I replied to a previous post, the transcript
of
&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; whole post being as follows below (please read from the bottom up).
I
&gt;&gt; know
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I'd much prefer carpets and furniture that resemble worn out
&gt; pincushions
&gt;&gt;&gt; and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; happy cats, than declaw them. Isn't this part of the fun of having
&gt; cats
&gt;&gt; ?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Transcript follows :-

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I had no idea it was THAT bad. I'm even more against it now. Thanks
&gt; for
&gt;&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; information. I hope that people who are considering declawing read
&gt; this
&gt;&gt;&gt; and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; see just how much suffereing they will cause.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Right!
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The nail is actually extended directly from the bone itself. In
&gt; fact
&gt;&gt; it
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; not too uncommon for vets who do not cut enough of the bone off to
&gt;&gt; have
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; claw start growing back. The problem is it grow through the skin
&gt; that
&gt;&gt;&gt; has
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; healed OVER the cut off part of the toe. When this happens it
&gt; almost
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; always
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; results in severe infection and ultimately leads the kitty back to
&gt; get
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; de-clawed all over again to stop the infection.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The other problem with declawing is the kitty supports much of
it's
&gt;&gt;&gt; weight
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; with the claw part of the toe. Just like you and I extend a
&gt;&gt; significant
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; portion of our weight onto out toes when we walk. Cats do the
same
&gt;&gt;&gt; thing
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; but their claws are their toes. After de-clawing the entire
posture
&gt;&gt; of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; cat is changed to an unnatural form. This often leads to back,
leg
&gt;&gt; and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; hip
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; problems later in life because the cat has tried to compensate by
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; adjusting
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; itself to an unnatural walk and stance.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; One other problem is a cat needs to stretch it's back and legs
&gt; almost
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; every
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; day. You've seen your cat when it first wakes up arch his back
real
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; sharply
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; upward, then almost as sharply downward. While they are doing
this
&gt;&gt;&gt; their
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; claws are anchored into whatever they are standing on. If they do
&gt; not
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; have
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; claws they cannot anchor themselves. This seriously reduces the
&gt;&gt; amount
&gt;&gt;&gt; of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; stretching they can do. This also often leads to problems later
in
&gt;&gt;&gt; life.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; also, technically -from what i've read- it's more like chopping
&gt; off
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; your finger tips since the claw is connected to the bone
(right?)

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Whilst licking their paws in alt.animals.cat on 09 Oct 2000,
&gt;&gt; j ... @wd.net
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (John) purred the following:

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I don't mean to drag this into a huge debate with flaming and
such
&gt;&gt; but
&gt;&gt;&gt; I

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Then you are asking entirely the wrong question. My first
instinct
&gt;&gt; was
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that you are a troll, simply here to start a flame war. Then I
&gt;&gt;&gt; wondered,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; what if you aren't? What if you are genuine? Then you need to
hear
&gt;&gt;&gt; both
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; sides of the story.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You won't hear any flames from me, but you will hear the truth and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; sometimes the truth hurts.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;am curious as to why the consensus here is that desexing your cat
&gt; in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;great and humane, makes them better pets and such, but when the
&gt;&gt; subject
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;turns to declawing, people believe that it is brutal mutilation.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;They are both relatively simple surgeries and can have risks
&gt; involved

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; First mistake. Declawing is *not* a simple surgery. It involves
&gt; the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; removal of not only the claw but the entire first knuckle. Take
&gt; your
&gt;&gt;&gt; hand
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; off the keyboard for a moment. Look at the fingers on your right
&gt;&gt; hand.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Now imagine someone cutting them *all* off at the first knuckle.
&gt; Now
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; imagine functioning without them. How do you think it would feel?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You cannot compare it to a desexing operation. Millions of women
&gt;&gt; around
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the world every year have hysterectomies. They all live happy and
&gt;&gt;&gt; healthy
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; lives afterwards. How many people would go on happily without any
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; knuckles
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; on either hand? And sometimes the first joint of the toes as
well?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;(the anesthetic alone is a risk), the cat hates having any of the
&gt;&gt; parts
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;removed, and the cat generally recovers in a few days to a couple
&gt;&gt;&gt; weeks.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Second mistake. If the desexing surgery is done at a fairly young
&gt;&gt; age,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; most females recover within a couple of days (except for the
&gt; stitches
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; which
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; come out in ten days) and males within 24 hours. For early age
&gt;&gt;&gt; neutering
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (at about 8 weeks) the recovery time is even less. Declawing can
&gt; take
&gt;&gt;&gt; up
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to six weeks for full recovery.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I've read the anti-declawing websites and find them to be a
little
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;biased, most knowledgeable veterinarians dislike having the
&gt; declawing
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;procedure done but believe the cats will be better off as a
better
&gt;&gt; pet
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;that isn't destructive and causing frustrations. If the owners
are

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Third mistake. It is well documented that cats without claws can
&gt;&gt; become
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; habitual biters. In fact a cat without claws will be much *more*
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; frustrated because they can't do the things that come naturally to
&gt;&gt; it -
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; like scratching on a scratching post or digging comfortably in
it's
&gt;&gt;&gt; litter
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; tray.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;happy, the pet will be happy. If the owners are unhappy, the pet
&gt; can
&gt;&gt; be
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;abandoned or put asleep.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I guess the point to make is that both surgeries are a form of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;mutilation, but are usually routine and make for a happier home
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;(especially strictly indoor cats).

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Fourth mistake. Declawing is *never* routine, even in the USA
where
&gt;&gt; it
&gt;&gt;&gt; is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; common. The majority of moral Vets will only do it in exceptional
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; circumstances. In Australia (where I live) declawing is banned
and
&gt;&gt; Vets
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; can be charged with animal cruelty if they perform the surgery.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; There are also many *good* reasons to desex a cat including:

&gt;&gt; Dr. Nicholas Dodman, Professor of Behavioral Pharmacology and Director
of
&gt;&gt; the Behavior Clinic at Tufts University School of Veterinary Medicine
and
&gt;&gt; internationally known specialist in domestic animal behavioral research,
&gt;&gt; explains declawing and *confirms* your statement:

&gt;&gt;&quot;The inhumanity of the procedure is clearly demonstrated by the nature
of
&gt;&gt; cats' recovery from anesthesia following the surgery. Unlike routine
&gt;&gt; recoveries, including recovery from neutering surgeries, which are
fairly
&gt;&gt; peaceful, declawing
&gt;&gt; surgery results in cats bouncing off the walls of the recovery cage
&gt; because
&gt;&gt; of excruciating pain. Cats that are more stoic huddle in the corner of
the
&gt;&gt; recovery cage, immobilized in a state of helplessness, presumably by
&gt;&gt; overwhelming pain.
&gt;&gt; Declawing fits the dictionary definition of mutilation to a tee. Words
&gt; such
&gt;&gt; as deform, disfigure, disjoint, and dismember all apply to this surgery.
&gt;&gt; Partial digital amputation is so horrible that it has been employed for
&gt;&gt; torture of prisoners of war, and in veterinary medicine, the clinical
&gt;&gt; procedure serves as model of severe pain for testing the efficacy of
&gt;&gt; analgesic drugs. Even though analgesic drugs can be used
postoperatively,
&gt;&gt; they rarely are, and their effects are incomplete and transient anyway,
so
&gt;&gt; sooner or later the pain will emerge.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; On the myths of declawing:

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 1)I've never seen a declawed cat have a problem with balance (and
I've
&gt;&gt;&gt; seen
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; quite a few)

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 2)Complications with declawing are so rare that I've never even
heard

&gt;&gt;&gt; one
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; from anyone I've ever known that has had a cat or even any vets I've

operations

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the most common and I've never heard of that either (besides from a
&gt; vet
&gt;&gt;&gt; who
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; said it's happened once). Talk to your vet and find out f he or she
&gt; has
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ever seen a complication due to declawing.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 3)Cats can still stretch if they've been declawed and they can live
&gt; just
&gt;&gt;&gt; as
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; long as those who haven't been declawed.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 4)Cats don't live a life of depression just because they don't have
&gt;&gt; claws.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Right!
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The nail is actually extended directly from the bone itself. In
&gt;&gt; fact
&gt;&gt;&gt; it
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; not too uncommon for vets who do not cut enough of the bone off
to
&gt;&gt;&gt; have
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; claw start growing back. The problem is it grow through the
skin
&gt;&gt; that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; has
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; healed OVER the cut off part of the toe. When this happens it
&gt;&gt; almost
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; always
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; results in severe infection and ultimately leads the kitty back
to
&gt;&gt; get
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; de-clawed all over again to stop the infection.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The other problem with declawing is the kitty supports much of
&gt; it's
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; weight
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; with the claw part of the toe. Just like you and I extend a
&gt;&gt;&gt; significant
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; portion of our weight onto out toes when we walk. Cats do the
&gt; same
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; thing
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; but their claws are their toes. After de-clawing the entire
&gt; posture
&gt;&gt;&gt; of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; cat is changed to an unnatural form. This often leads to back,
&gt; leg
&gt;&gt;&gt; and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; hip
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; problems later in life because the cat has tried to compensate
by
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; adjusting
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; itself to an unnatural walk and stance.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; One other problem is a cat needs to stretch it's back and legs
&gt;&gt; almost
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; every
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; day. You've seen your cat when it first wakes up arch his back
&gt; real
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; sharply
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; upward, then almost as sharply downward. While they are doing
&gt; this
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; their
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; claws are anchored into whatever they are standing on. If they
do
&gt;&gt; not
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; have
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; claws they cannot anchor themselves. This seriously reduces the
&gt;&gt;&gt; amount
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; stretching they can do. This also often leads to problems later
&gt; in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; life.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Whilst licking their paws in alt.animals.cat on 09 Oct 2000,
&gt;&gt;&gt; j ... @wd.net
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (John) purred the following:

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I don't mean to drag this into a huge debate with flaming and
&gt; such
&gt;&gt;&gt; but
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Then you are asking entirely the wrong question. My first
&gt; instinct
&gt;&gt;&gt; was
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that you are a troll, simply here to start a flame war. Then I
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; wondered,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; what if you aren't? What if you are genuine? Then you need to
&gt; hear
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; both
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; sides of the story.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You won't hear any flames from me, but you will hear the truth
and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; sometimes the truth hurts.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;am curious as to why the consensus here is that desexing your
cat
&gt;&gt; in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;great and humane, makes them better pets and such, but when the
&gt;&gt;&gt; subject
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;turns to declawing, people believe that it is brutal
mutilation.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;They are both relatively simple surgeries and can have risks
&gt;&gt; involved

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; First mistake. Declawing is *not* a simple surgery. It
involves
&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; removal of not only the claw but the entire first knuckle. Take
&gt;&gt; your
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; hand
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; off the keyboard for a moment. Look at the fingers on your
right
&gt;&gt;&gt; hand.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Now imagine someone cutting them *all* off at the first knuckle.
&gt;&gt; Now
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; imagine functioning without them. How do you think it would
feel?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You cannot compare it to a desexing operation. Millions of
women
&gt;&gt;&gt; around
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the world every year have hysterectomies. They all live happy
and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; healthy
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; lives afterwards. How many people would go on happily without
any
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; knuckles
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; on either hand? And sometimes the first joint of the toes as
&gt; well?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;(the anesthetic alone is a risk), the cat hates having any of
the
&gt;&gt;&gt; parts
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;removed, and the cat generally recovers in a few days to a
couple
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; weeks.

I have 6 cats; 3 are declawed and 3 are not; some I had done when I
adopted them and some came to me without claws. I can honestly say that
I feel there is no difference in the actions , i.e. playfulnes, etc.
between any of the six. I do rest assured knowing that my furniture is
reasonably safe. I do have to chase the cats with claws from the
furniture from time to time. I use a spray water bottle.

"/> I'm having to piggyback here, since I never received John's original
post. (Hope I snipped right).

There's no doubt that spaying and neutering are done for behavioral
reasons as well as for population control and health reasons. For many
pet owners, the deciding factor is the prevention of stinky intact male
cat spray or annoying female calling behavior, not necessarily the
prevention of cancers of the reproductive organs or even decreasing the
surplus cat population, no matter how valid these reasons are, since
there is widespread ignorance of these issues among the general
pet-owning population.

In general it isn't acceptable to me (or to many other people) to choose
a surgical method of behavioral modification with all the attendant
risks of anesthesia, infection etc., when less invasive, less expensive,
and less complicated techniques are readily available. You can't easily
train a cat out of its reproductive instincts, no matter how clever you
are. Those are powerful hormones at work. You can, however, train it to
scratch on scratching posts or other acceptable substrates-and, in most
cases, it's pretty easy-and usually less expensive than declaw surgery,
too! Even if you have a hard case, you can always buy slip covers for
the sofa, or restrict access (e.g., by shutting the door to a room with
expensive carpets or furniture and not allowing the cat in). Older cats
often scratch less than kittens and young cats, so the problem often
abates with time, too. This isn't true of the behaviors associated with
reproduction.

Yes, but if your instincts were uncontrollable and made you &quot;bonkers&quot; (like
male teen years I suppose, heh) on a regular basis, then you would
appreciate being spayed/neutered.

That operation has its mental and physical benefits.

Absurd.

Heh, letting your children out of the house puts them in more danger too!
Does it make for a thoughtless parent to let them go to college? the
military?
I do not think that is a valid argument. Many cats (like people) don't like
to be couped up.

Before you assume which half of your statistic I am in...My cat has
razor-sharp claws in fact, and once in a while she likes to sit on the porch
when I am outside. Otherwise, she is an indoor cat.

&gt;&gt; 1)I've never seen a declawed cat have a problem with balance (and I've
&gt; seen
&gt;&gt; quite a few)

&gt;&gt; 2)Complications with declawing are so rare that I've never even heard of
&gt; one
&gt;&gt; from anyone I've ever known that has had a cat or even any vets I've
&gt; talked
&gt;&gt; to. They are probably just as rare as complications with spaying or

&gt;&gt; the most common and I've never heard of that either (besides from a vet
&gt; who
&gt;&gt; said it's happened once). Talk to your vet and find out f he or she has
&gt;&gt; ever seen a complication due to declawing.

&gt;&gt; 3)Cats can still stretch if they've been declawed and they can live just
&gt; as
&gt;&gt; long as those who haven't been declawed.

&gt;&gt; 4)Cats don't live a life of depression just because they don't have claws.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Good post Vicki.

&gt;&gt;&gt; On the subject of desexing, all of my cats are spayed/neutered. None
&gt; have
&gt;&gt;&gt; suffered ANY ill effects. In fact, a couple of the females were tearing
&gt;&gt;&gt; round fit to burst their stitches as soon as they got home. One tom was
&gt; a
&gt;&gt;&gt; little bothered for a couple of days, the other not at all.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Now, as to declawing, I replied to a previous post, the transcript of
&gt; the
&gt;&gt;&gt; whole post being as follows below (please read from the bottom up). I
&gt; know
&gt;&gt;&gt; I'd much prefer carpets and furniture that resemble worn out pincushions
&gt;&gt; and
&gt;&gt;&gt; happy cats, than declaw them. Isn't this part of the fun of having cats
&gt; ?

&gt;&gt;&gt; Transcript follows :-

&gt;&gt;&gt; I had no idea it was THAT bad. I'm even more against it now. Thanks for
&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt;&gt; information. I hope that people who are considering declawing read this
&gt;&gt; and
&gt;&gt;&gt; see just how much suffereing they will cause.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Right!
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The nail is actually extended directly from the bone itself. In fact
&gt; it
&gt;&gt;&gt; is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; not too uncommon for vets who do not cut enough of the bone off to
&gt; have
&gt;&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; claw start growing back. The problem is it grow through the skin that
&gt;&gt; has
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; healed OVER the cut off part of the toe. When this happens it almost
&gt;&gt;&gt; always
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; results in severe infection and ultimately leads the kitty back to get
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; de-clawed all over again to stop the infection.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The other problem with declawing is the kitty supports much of it's
&gt;&gt; weight
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; with the claw part of the toe. Just like you and I extend a
&gt; significant
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; portion of our weight onto out toes when we walk. Cats do the same
&gt;&gt; thing
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; but their claws are their toes. After de-clawing the entire posture
&gt; of
&gt;&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; cat is changed to an unnatural form. This often leads to back, leg
&gt; and
&gt;&gt;&gt; hip
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; problems later in life because the cat has tried to compensate by
&gt;&gt;&gt; adjusting
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; itself to an unnatural walk and stance.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; One other problem is a cat needs to stretch it's back and legs almost
&gt;&gt;&gt; every
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; day. You've seen your cat when it first wakes up arch his back real
&gt;&gt;&gt; sharply
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; upward, then almost as sharply downward. While they are doing this
&gt;&gt; their
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; claws are anchored into whatever they are standing on. If they do not
&gt;&gt;&gt; have
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; claws they cannot anchor themselves. This seriously reduces the
&gt; amount
&gt;&gt; of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; stretching they can do. This also often leads to problems later in
&gt;&gt; life.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Whilst licking their paws in alt.animals.cat on 09 Oct 2000,
&gt; j ... @wd.net
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (John) purred the following:

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I don't mean to drag this into a huge debate with flaming and such
&gt; but
&gt;&gt; I

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Then you are asking entirely the wrong question. My first instinct
&gt; was
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that you are a troll, simply here to start a flame war. Then I
&gt;&gt; wondered,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; what if you aren't? What if you are genuine? Then you need to hear
&gt;&gt; both
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; sides of the story.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You won't hear any flames from me, but you will hear the truth and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; sometimes the truth hurts.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;am curious as to why the consensus here is that desexing your cat in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;great and humane, makes them better pets and such, but when the
&gt; subject
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;turns to declawing, people believe that it is brutal mutilation.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;They are both relatively simple surgeries and can have risks involved

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; First mistake. Declawing is *not* a simple surgery. It involves the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; removal of not only the claw but the entire first knuckle. Take your
&gt;&gt; hand
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; off the keyboard for a moment. Look at the fingers on your right
&gt; hand.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Now imagine someone cutting them *all* off at the first knuckle. Now
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; imagine functioning without them. How do you think it would feel?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You cannot compare it to a desexing operation. Millions of women
&gt; around
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the world every year have hysterectomies. They all live happy and
&gt;&gt; healthy
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; lives afterwards. How many people would go on happily without any
&gt;&gt;&gt; knuckles
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; on either hand? And sometimes the first joint of the toes as well?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;(the anesthetic alone is a risk), the cat hates having any of the
&gt; parts
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;removed, and the cat generally recovers in a few days to a couple
&gt;&gt; weeks.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Second mistake. If the desexing surgery is done at a fairly young
&gt; age,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; most females recover within a couple of days (except for the stitches
&gt;&gt;&gt; which
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; come out in ten days) and males within 24 hours. For early age
&gt;&gt; neutering
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (at about 8 weeks) the recovery time is even less. Declawing can take
&gt;&gt; up
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to six weeks for full recovery.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I've read the anti-declawing websites and find them to be a little
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;biased, most knowledgeable veterinarians dislike having the declawing
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;procedure done but believe the cats will be better off as a better
&gt; pet
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;that isn't destructive and causing frustrations. If the owners are

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Third mistake. It is well documented that cats without claws can
&gt; become
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; habitual biters. In fact a cat without claws will be much *more*
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; frustrated because they can't do the things that come naturally to
&gt; it -
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; like scratching on a scratching post or digging comfortably in it's
&gt;&gt; litter
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; tray.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;happy, the pet will be happy. If the owners are unhappy, the pet can
&gt; be
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;abandoned or put asleep.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I guess the point to make is that both surgeries are a form of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;mutilation, but are usually routine and make for a happier home
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;(especially strictly indoor cats).

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Fourth mistake. Declawing is *never* routine, even in the USA where
&gt; it
&gt;&gt; is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; common. The majority of moral Vets will only do it in exceptional
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; circumstances. In Australia (where I live) declawing is banned and
&gt; Vets
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; can be charged with animal cruelty if they perform the surgery.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; There are also many *good* reasons to desex a cat including:

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 1. Reduction in the number of litters produced. You may say &quot;I
&gt; keep
&gt;&gt; my
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; cat in so it won't get pregnant&quot; - you haven't had a cat in season!
&gt;&gt; They
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; will do *anything* to get out! You may also say &quot;I have homes for any
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; kittens I produce&quot; - that just means four or five kittens from the
&gt; RSPCA
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; are going to be euthanaised because you've produced four or five more.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 2. Reduction in the incidence of uterine and mammory cancers in
&gt;&gt; females
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and testicular cancer in males. These cancers are found almost
&gt;&gt;&gt; exclusively
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in intact cats.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 3. Reduction in the risk of contracting sexually transmitted
&gt; diseases

Why allow the debate to drift into knocking peoples expertise or
otherwise. The issue is very simple, the only reason declawing is done
is for the benefit of the human, all other arguments are just trying to
justify the truth of the matter! Those of you who declaw your cats may
love them but you love your furniture more! The issue of preventing
injury is rubbish as you are making your poor cats more liable to being
hurt as they can't defend themselves. Go away and pull all your
fingernails out and see how you feel! Wasn't this once used as a form of
torture????
There is no argument over this issue, if you don't like cats with claws
then get a goldfish!

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Good post Vicki.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; On the subject of desexing, all of my cats are spayed/neutered. None
&gt;&gt; have
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; suffered ANY ill effects. In fact, a couple of the females were tearing
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; round fit to burst their stitches as soon as they got home. One tom was
&gt;&gt; a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; little bothered for a couple of days, the other not at all.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Now, as to declawing, I replied to a previous post, the transcript of
&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; whole post being as follows below (please read from the bottom up). I
&gt;&gt; know
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I'd much prefer carpets and furniture that resemble worn out pincushions
&gt;&gt;&gt; and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; happy cats, than declaw them. Isn't this part of the fun of having cats
&gt;&gt; ?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Transcript follows :-

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I had no idea it was THAT bad. I'm even more against it now. Thanks for
&gt;&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; information. I hope that people who are considering declawing read this
&gt;&gt;&gt; and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; see just how much suffereing they will cause.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Right!
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The nail is actually extended directly from the bone itself. In fact
&gt;&gt; it
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; not too uncommon for vets who do not cut enough of the bone off to
&gt;&gt; have
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; claw start growing back. The problem is it grow through the skin that
&gt;&gt;&gt; has
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; healed OVER the cut off part of the toe. When this happens it almost
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; always
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; results in severe infection and ultimately leads the kitty back to get
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; de-clawed all over again to stop the infection.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The other problem with declawing is the kitty supports much of it's
&gt;&gt;&gt; weight
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; with the claw part of the toe. Just like you and I extend a
&gt;&gt; significant
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; portion of our weight onto out toes when we walk. Cats do the same
&gt;&gt;&gt; thing
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; but their claws are their toes. After de-clawing the entire posture
&gt;&gt; of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; cat is changed to an unnatural form. This often leads to back, leg
&gt;&gt; and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; hip
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; problems later in life because the cat has tried to compensate by
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; adjusting
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; itself to an unnatural walk and stance.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; One other problem is a cat needs to stretch it's back and legs almost
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; every
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; day. You've seen your cat when it first wakes up arch his back real
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; sharply
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; upward, then almost as sharply downward. While they are doing this
&gt;&gt;&gt; their
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; claws are anchored into whatever they are standing on. If they do not
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; have
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; claws they cannot anchor themselves. This seriously reduces the
&gt;&gt; amount
&gt;&gt;&gt; of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; stretching they can do. This also often leads to problems later in
&gt;&gt;&gt; life.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; also, technically -from what i've read- it's more like chopping off
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; your finger tips since the claw is connected to the bone (right?)

John,
While I don't get as heated up on the declawing issue I do have to agree
with the general consensus. I rescue strays and care for orphaned kittens. I
see just as many as I rescue die because of cars, dogs, animals, disease and
it breaks my heart every time and I always am left wondering if I have any
heart left.
Spaying and neutering can control this problem. There are too many cats and
not enough homes. I know first hand, I am caring for a ton of them. I had a
litter of orphans all die on me and I still don't know why. I cannot even
bring myself to look at the pictures I took still. I had to take one of the
feral babies off the road about a week ago and I had to remain strong while
doing so but broke down in tears afterwards.
If these cats that are feral and having kittens were fixed(and I am trying
to see that end) I would not have this heartache and neither would they.
People domesticated the cat and now we have to take responsibility for that.

I jave 3 cats with all claws intact!!! I have really nice furniture. My cats also
have something to claw on( a 8 ft cat tree) and will let me trim their claws. Sure
my cats get mad for trimmimg their claws but it passes, just as emotions do. What I
found ridiculous is that some folk are putting waay too much emotion into their cats.
Mine have their moods too, I just don't read alot into it, unless it pretains to
their health.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; suffered ANY ill effects. In fact, a couple of the females were tearing
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; round fit to burst their stitches as soon as they got home. One tom was
&gt;&gt;&gt; a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; little bothered for a couple of days, the other not at all.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Now, as to declawing, I replied to a previous post, the transcript of
&gt;&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; whole post being as follows below (please read from the bottom up). I
&gt;&gt;&gt; know
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I'd much prefer carpets and furniture that resemble worn out pincushions
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; happy cats, than declaw them. Isn't this part of the fun of having cats
&gt;&gt;&gt; ?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Transcript follows :-

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I had no idea it was THAT bad. I'm even more against it now. Thanks for
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; information. I hope that people who are considering declawing read this
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; see just how much suffereing they will cause.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Right!
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The nail is actually extended directly from the bone itself. In fact
&gt;&gt;&gt; it
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; not too uncommon for vets who do not cut enough of the bone off to
&gt;&gt;&gt; have
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; claw start growing back. The problem is it grow through the skin that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; has
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; healed OVER the cut off part of the toe. When this happens it almost
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; always
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; results in severe infection and ultimately leads the kitty back to get
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; de-clawed all over again to stop the infection.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The other problem with declawing is the kitty supports much of it's
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; weight
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; with the claw part of the toe. Just like you and I extend a
&gt;&gt;&gt; significant
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; portion of our weight onto out toes when we walk. Cats do the same
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; thing
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; but their claws are their toes. After de-clawing the entire posture
&gt;&gt;&gt; of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; cat is changed to an unnatural form. This often leads to back, leg
&gt;&gt;&gt; and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; hip
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; problems later in life because the cat has tried to compensate by
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; adjusting
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; itself to an unnatural walk and stance.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; One other problem is a cat needs to stretch it's back and legs almost
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; every
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; day. You've seen your cat when it first wakes up arch his back real
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; sharply
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; upward, then almost as sharply downward. While they are doing this
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; their
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; claws are anchored into whatever they are standing on. If they do not
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; have
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; claws they cannot anchor themselves. This seriously reduces the
&gt;&gt;&gt; amount
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; stretching they can do. This also often leads to problems later in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; life.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; also, technically -from what i've read- it's more like chopping off
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; your finger tips since the claw is connected to the bone (right?)

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; poor kitties....

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Whilst licking their paws in alt.animals.cat on 09 Oct 2000,
&gt;&gt;&gt; j ... @wd.net
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (John) purred the following:

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I don't mean to drag this into a huge debate with flaming and such
&gt;&gt;&gt; but
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Then you are asking entirely the wrong question. My first instinct
&gt;&gt;&gt; was
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that you are a troll, simply here to start a flame war. Then I
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; wondered,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; what if you aren't? What if you are genuine? Then you need to hear
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; both
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; sides of the story.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You won't hear any flames from me, but you will hear the truth and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; sometimes the truth hurts.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;am curious as to why the consensus here is that desexing your cat in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;great and humane, makes them better pets and such, but when the
&gt;&gt;&gt; subject
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;turns to declawing, people believe that it is brutal mutilation.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;They are both relatively simple surgeries and can have risks involved

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; First mistake. Declawing is *not* a simple surgery. It involves the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; removal of not only the claw but the entire first knuckle. Take your
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; hand
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; off the keyboard for a moment. Look at the fingers on your right
&gt;&gt;&gt; hand.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Now imagine someone cutting them *all* off at the first knuckle. Now
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; imagine functioning without them. How do you think it would feel?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You cannot compare it to a desexing operation. Millions of women
&gt;&gt;&gt; around
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the world every year have hysterectomies. They all live happy and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; healthy
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; lives afterwards. How many people would go on happily without any
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; knuckles
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; on either hand? And sometimes the first joint of the toes as well?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;(the anesthetic alone is a risk), the cat hates having any of the
&gt;&gt;&gt; parts
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;removed, and the cat generally recovers in a few days to a couple
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; weeks.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Second mistake. If the desexing surgery is done at a fairly young
&gt;&gt;&gt; age,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; most females recover within a couple of days (except for the stitches
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; which
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; come out in ten days) and males within 24 hours. For early age
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; neutering
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (at about 8 weeks) the recovery time is even less. Declawing can take
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; up
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to six weeks for full recovery.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I've read the anti-declawing websites and find them to be a little

Hi! I'm new to this newsgroup but I really need some advice...
I currently have 4 cats, two tabbies one tom&quot;blind&quot; and a female persian.
Now here's my problem, all my cats are either neurtered or spayed but one of
the tabbies, the younger one
seems to bear some kind of hatred for my tom and the persian...( my tom and
the other tabby isn't too
fond of the persian either, but at least they won't attack it.) and since my
tom is blind though much bigger,
the tabby just takes advantage and attacks it when she is feelin?? bored?
And she eyes the persian as is she is lunch or something... so I had to
actually keep the persian locked up in the toilet to prevent accidents from
happening. As for my tom, he has his own &quot;bodyguard&quot; the other tabby she
keeps a lookout for him so I'm not so worried. (and the tom doesn't sufferas
many attacks from the persian cuz he is really huge. This problem has been
so frustrating for me and I simply can't bear to see the persian being
locked up all alone and I also can't bear to give up my tabby..
so I have actually thought about declaying my cat so that it can't attack
them. I have a friend who did it once and told me it was just fine for the
cat so I'm really in a bit of a dilemma here. Any advice?

&gt; Why allow the debate to drift into knocking peoples expertise or
&gt; otherwise. The issue is very simple, the only reason declawing is done
&gt; is for the benefit of the human, all other arguments are just trying to
&gt; justify the truth of the matter! Those of you who declaw your cats may
&gt; love them but you love your furniture more! The issue of preventing
&gt; injury is rubbish as you are making your poor cats more liable to being
&gt; hurt as they can't defend themselves. Go away and pull all your
&gt; fingernails out and see how you feel! Wasn't this once used as a form of
&gt; torture????
&gt; There is no argument over this issue, if you don't like cats with claws
&gt; then get a goldfish!

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; On the myths of declawing:

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 1)I've never seen a declawed cat have a problem with balance (and
I've
&gt;&gt;&gt; seen
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; quite a few)

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 2)Complications with declawing are so rare that I've never even
heard of
&gt;&gt;&gt; one
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; from anyone I've ever known that has had a cat or even any vets I've
&gt;&gt;&gt; talked
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to. They are probably just as rare as complications with spaying or
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; neutering. Complications due to anesthesia required in he
operations are
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the most common and I've never heard of that either (besides from a
vet
&gt;&gt;&gt; who
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; said it's happened once). Talk to your vet and find out f he or she
has
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ever seen a complication due to declawing.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 3)Cats can still stretch if they've been declawed and they can live
just
&gt;&gt;&gt; as
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; long as those who haven't been declawed.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 4)Cats don't live a life of depression just because they don't have
claws.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Good post Vicki.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; On the subject of desexing, all of my cats are spayed/neutered.
None
&gt;&gt;&gt; have
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; suffered ANY ill effects. In fact, a couple of the females were
tearing
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; round fit to burst their stitches as soon as they got home. One
tom was
&gt;&gt;&gt; a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; little bothered for a couple of days, the other not at all.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Now, as to declawing, I replied to a previous post, the transcript
of
&gt;&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; whole post being as follows below (please read from the bottom

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Right!
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The nail is actually extended directly from the bone itself. In
fact
&gt;&gt;&gt; it
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; not too uncommon for vets who do not cut enough of the bone off
to
&gt;&gt;&gt; have
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; claw start growing back. The problem is it grow through the
skin that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; has
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; healed OVER the cut off part of the toe. When this happens it
almost
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; always
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; results in severe infection and ultimately leads the kitty back
to get
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; de-clawed all over again to stop the infection.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The other problem with declawing is the kitty supports much of
it's
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; weight
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; with the claw part of the toe. Just like you and I extend a
&gt;&gt;&gt; significant
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; portion of our weight onto out toes when we walk. Cats do the
same
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; thing
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; but their claws are their toes. After de-clawing the entire
posture
&gt;&gt;&gt; of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; cat is changed to an unnatural form. This often leads to back,
leg
&gt;&gt;&gt; and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; hip
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; problems later in life because the cat has tried to compensate
by
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; adjusting
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; itself to an unnatural walk and stance.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; One other problem is a cat needs to stretch it's back and legs
almost
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; every
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; day. You've seen your cat when it first wakes up arch his back
real
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; sharply
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; upward, then almost as sharply downward. While they are doing
this
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; their
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; claws are anchored into whatever they are standing on. If they
do not
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; have
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; claws they cannot anchor themselves. This seriously reduces the
&gt;&gt;&gt; amount
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; stretching they can do. This also often leads to problems later
in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; life.

&gt; fine. They love to sleep on the new cushy pillows. Penny

"/> *sigh*

See, I've kind of had this idea in my mind that people who declaw for
the sake of the furniture are control freaks. This kind of post
reinforces that idea. You can't take the time to properly train your
cats, you have to have everything just so, so you cut off the offending
part.

Just heartbreaking. I hope you have many happy years with your
wonderful, special, extraordinary furniture. And my sympathies to your
poor kitties for not being as important as the furniture. It's a matter
of ethics.

In our home, we modify our surroundings for our cats, not our cats for
our surroundings.

problems when they've had a year to get used to each other I think it's
really time to sort the problem out for them. It sounds like the

will need to be prepared for a lot of grooming!

All I can say about the neutering subject is that when I had my male cat
neutered, I had the decency to replace his little do-dads so he wouldn't
notice.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Cats do need their claws, just as humans need their fingers.
&gt;&gt; But they don't need them anywhere near as much as humans. They
definitely
&gt;&gt; don't need them for eating, driving, working, typing, changing the
&gt; channels,
&gt;&gt; etc.

&gt; Yes, they do need their claws, just as humans need their fingers, and the
&gt; fact that they are not engaging in &quot;important&quot; human tasks does not make
the
&gt; function of their claws any less important. You may not think a cat needs
&gt; its claws, but for many reasons it does. I explained that at some length
in
&gt; my previous post.

&gt;&gt;&gt;If they didn't need them, they wouldn't have them.
&gt;&gt; Which does a lot to explain why we have tonsils and an appendix.

&gt; Human tonsils and appendixes are evolutionary leftovers, so to speak. But
&gt; cat claws still serve active functions and are necessary to a cat's
&gt; well-being, as described in my previous post.

&gt;&gt;&gt;They mark their territories by clawing, not simply with visual
evidence,
&gt;&gt; but also with scent--there are scent glands in their
&gt;&gt;&gt;paws that can only release their odor through clawing.
&gt;&gt; An indoor cat has no use for this.

&gt; Not according to you, but try explaining it to the cat! An indoor cat
&gt; definitely has its own territory, and however irrational and useless you
may
&gt; find it from a *human* perspective, it is still necessary from the *cat's*
&gt; point of view.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Declawing is performed strictly to prevent the cat from
&gt;&gt;&gt;damaging furniture--there is no other reason to do it. It provides
&gt;&gt;&gt;absolutely no health benefit to the cat
&gt;&gt; A happy owner often makes for a happy (and healthy) cat. An unhappy
owner
&gt;&gt; often makes for an abandoned (or dead) cat. Often a cat that destroys
the
&gt;&gt; furniture makes a home unhappy. Declawing many times is the only
answer.

&gt; No, another answer is to find another home for a cat whose behavior you
are
&gt; apparently unwilling to understand, and therefore deal with in a
reasonable
&gt; and humane manner. Declawing is never the *only answer*.

&gt; I notice you've chosen not to comment on the number of declawed cats I saw
&gt; come into the shelter I once volunteered at. Apparently, even declawed,
&gt; these cats still couldn't make their owners happy. What lovely people
they
&gt; must be, those who would willingly mutilate a cat's feet to save the sofa,
&gt; then haul it to the pound when it sprays the couch with urine or claws it
&gt; with its back feet while climbing up, instead...

&gt;&gt;&gt;What are you *doing* to the cat that would cause you to have &quot;arms
&gt; scraped
&gt;&gt;&gt;up and bleeding from claw marks?&quot;
&gt;&gt; Often just playing with a cat that has claws will result in some
&gt; formidable
&gt;&gt; scratch mark (especially Bengels who are known to play hard). My cat
&gt; likes
&gt;&gt; to stretch her claws and sink them in to furniture or carpet when she is
&gt;&gt; happy (or after eating tasty canned food). Sometimes she will sink her
&gt;&gt; claws into clothing or skin when she is happy not realizing it is
painful
&gt; to
&gt;&gt; humans. Ever try bathing a cat? Or clipping a cat's nails? You would
be
&gt;&gt; very lucky to get away without being scratched. Or sometimes my cat
will
&gt; be
&gt;&gt; in a playful mood and swat at me (or others) when they pet her. She
also
&gt;&gt; finds it especially effective to wake me up in the morning by scratching
&gt; me.
&gt;&gt; You don't necessarily have to *do* anything to get clawed by a cat.

&gt; Having owned many cats over the years, I have bathed many of them, and yes
,
&gt; occasionally I have been scratched, though rarely seriously. I have never
&gt; clipped a cat's nails because I have never seen any need to. Once in a
&gt; while, I have also taken a swipe when play gets out of hand, at which
point
&gt; the smartest course is to realize the cat has been overstimulated and back
&gt; off until it cools off.

&gt; Occasionally I get pricked when a contented cat is &quot;kneading&quot; it's paws in
&gt; my lap, but it doesn't break the skin, is a relatively minor annoyance,
and
&gt; is hardly worth declawing the cats over. If you don't like being awakened
&gt; in the morning by being scratched, you can do things to discourage that
&gt; behavior. I broke my youngest kitten of the habit of batting at my nose
in
&gt; the mornings by blowing hard in his face every time he got close to mine
as
&gt; I lay in bed; it was a simple thing to do, was very effective, and did not
&gt; cause him any suffering.

&gt;&gt;&gt;And as for bites being better--have you ever been
&gt;&gt;&gt;bitten (and I mean really bitten, not just nipped) by a cat?
&gt;&gt; Didn't say bites are better, only that being scratched by a cat not
&gt; declawed
&gt;&gt; happens much more often than being bitten by a declawed cat (and cat
bites
&gt;&gt; usually don't wreck furniture.

&gt; Again, there are a lot of ways to avoid getting scratched, or keep the cat
&gt; from clawing the furniture. That's not to say you will never get
scratched,
&gt; or that the cat won't forget and take a swipe at the couch, but with
&gt; patience, care, and some basic understanding of cats you can minimize it.
&gt; Declawing is totally unnecessary. If you can't stand the thought of your
&gt; couch being clawed at all, or of sustaining a few minor scratches
&gt; occasionally, a cat simply isn't the right pet for you.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Declawing is also quite profitable. The same economics that leads
&gt; plastic
&gt;&gt;&gt;surgeons to perform excessive or risky procedures on human patients,
&gt; simply
&gt;&gt;&gt;because they want it, drives vets who declaw
&gt;&gt; I hope you aren't trying to say that none of these vets care for cats or
&gt;&gt; animals. They sure got into the wrong field under your views.

&gt; While the vets who perform declawing surgery might profess to having great
&gt; care for animals, there is no doubt that they care for their profit margin
&gt; much more. To willingly subject a cat to that kind of pain strictly for
the
&gt; sake of the owner's convenience does not show any great regard for cats,
and
&gt; there are a *lot* of veterinarians that will not do declawing.

&gt;&gt;&gt;You may not know anyone whose cat has had complications, but exactly
&gt;&gt;&gt;how many declawed cats do you know?
&gt;&gt; Veterinarians usually know quite a few declawed vets and out of the 3
I've
&gt;&gt; talked to none of them has seen a complication yet. They've seen
allergic
&gt;&gt; reactions to anesthesia but that is very rare as well.

&gt; You didn't answer my question--how many declawed cats do you know?

&gt; If a vet offers declawing surgery, he or she isn't exactly going to be
&gt; forthcoming about complications, especially if they involve his or her
&gt; patients. My own vet is a cat specialist who will not perform declaw
&gt; surgery, but she has seen many cats brought in to her practice with
post-op
&gt; complications, as well as cats that had been declawed years before and
&gt; suffered from chronic foot problems.

&gt;&gt;&gt;In other words, it's *inconvenient for you* to clip her claws, so she
&gt;&gt; should
&gt;&gt;&gt;be the one to suffer?
&gt;&gt; That is a *very* hasty assumption. Convenience hasn't been the issue,
her
&gt;&gt; painful anguish and resentment is. After clipping she is usually so
&gt; worked
&gt;&gt; up and sick to her stomach that she just lays there, sleeps, and feels
&gt;&gt; horrible. This isn't in the cat's best interest (or mine). Would be
&gt; easier
&gt;&gt; for her if they were just gotten rid of all at once and never had to
deal
&gt;&gt; with a lifetime of torturous clipping sessions.

&gt; Then quit clipping her damn claws, if it's such an ordeal.

&gt;&gt;&gt;find another way to do it--having someone else hold
&gt;&gt;&gt;her while she is wrapped firmly in a towel, one leg outside the towel
at
&gt; a
&gt;&gt;&gt;time, might help.
&gt;&gt; again, this is more convenient for me, but not the cat

&gt; LOL--Wrapping the cat in a towel for a few minutes while having her claws
&gt; clipped is &quot;inconvenient&quot; for her, but having her feet mutilated isn't?
&gt; That's an amazing feat of logic, John. It really is.

&gt;&gt;&gt;I can tell that you don't have a clue what makes her tick or
&gt;&gt;&gt;how to deal with it from a cat's point of view
&gt;&gt; That's not an insult, I know I don't know very much. That is why I
asked
&gt;&gt; the question in the first place. But I think that you on the other hand
&gt;&gt; assume you know what makes a cat tick or how to deal with things from a
&gt;&gt; cat's point of view and really don't know much more than me.

&gt; What makes you think I don't know any more than you? I have had cats for
&gt; most of my life, and have faced all kinds of behavioral problems, from
&gt; clawing furniture, to crapping outside the box, to engaging in overly
rough
&gt; play. In order to deal with those problems, I have taken the time to
learn
&gt; what I could about cat behavior so that I could deal with undesirable
&gt; behaviors in a manner that was both effective and humane. I don't
*assume*
&gt; what makes cats tick; in most cases I *know*, and I know because I took
the
&gt; time to learn it, both through reading and observation. No, I don't know
&gt; every last thing there is to know about cat behavior--nobody does. But I
at
&gt; least understand what makes a cat tick, and actively use that knowledge to
&gt; reinforce or discourage specific behaviors.

&gt;&gt;&gt;A cat is not a toy, or an animate object that can simply be manipulated
&gt; at
&gt;&gt;&gt;will. A cat is not a toy, or an animate object that can simply be
&gt;&gt; manipulated at
&gt;&gt;&gt;will. It's not a little meat puppet, there simply to make you happy.
It
&gt;&gt;&gt;has a life and consciousness and way of relating to the world that is
&gt; very
&gt;&gt;&gt;unique, but hardly unfathomable. If she's clawing the furniture

&gt;&gt; Declawing is totally unnecessary. If you can't stand the thought of
your
&gt;&gt; couch being clawed at all, or of sustaining a few minor scratches
&gt;&gt; occasionally, a cat simply isn't the right pet for you.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Declawing is also quite profitable. The same economics that leads
&gt;&gt; plastic
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;surgeons to perform excessive or risky procedures on human patients,
&gt;&gt; simply
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;because they want it, drives vets who declaw
&gt;&gt;&gt; I hope you aren't trying to say that none of these vets care for cats
or
&gt;&gt;&gt; animals. They sure got into the wrong field under your views.

&gt;&gt; While the vets who perform declawing surgery might profess to having
great
&gt;&gt; care for animals, there is no doubt that they care for their profit
margin
&gt;&gt; much more. To willingly subject a cat to that kind of pain strictly for
&gt; the
&gt;&gt; sake of the owner's convenience does not show any great regard for cats,
&gt; and
&gt;&gt; there are a *lot* of veterinarians that will not do declawing.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;You may not know anyone whose cat has had complications, but exactly
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;how many declawed cats do you know?
&gt;&gt;&gt; Veterinarians usually know quite a few declawed vets and out of the 3
&gt; I've
&gt;&gt;&gt; talked to none of them has seen a complication yet. They've seen
&gt; allergic
&gt;&gt;&gt; reactions to anesthesia but that is very rare as well.

&gt;&gt; You didn't answer my question--how many declawed cats do you know?

&gt;&gt; If a vet offers declawing surgery, he or she isn't exactly going to be
&gt;&gt; forthcoming about complications, especially if they involve his or her
&gt;&gt; patients. My own vet is a cat specialist who will not perform declaw
&gt;&gt; surgery, but she has seen many cats brought in to her practice with
&gt; post-op
&gt;&gt; complications, as well as cats that had been declawed years before and
&gt;&gt; suffered from chronic foot problems.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;In other words, it's *inconvenient for you* to clip her claws, so she
&gt;&gt;&gt; should
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;be the one to suffer?
&gt;&gt;&gt; That is a *very* hasty assumption. Convenience hasn't been the issue,
&gt; her
&gt;&gt;&gt; painful anguish and resentment is. After clipping she is usually so
&gt;&gt; worked
&gt;&gt;&gt; up and sick to her stomach that she just lays there, sleeps, and feels
&gt;&gt;&gt; horrible. This isn't in the cat's best interest (or mine). Would be
&gt;&gt; easier
&gt;&gt;&gt; for her if they were just gotten rid of all at once and never had to
&gt; deal
&gt;&gt;&gt; with a lifetime of torturous clipping sessions.

&gt;&gt; Then quit clipping her damn claws, if it's such an ordeal.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;find another way to do it--having someone else hold
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;her while she is wrapped firmly in a towel, one leg outside the towel
&gt; at
&gt;&gt; a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;time, might help.
&gt;&gt;&gt; again, this is more convenient for me, but not the cat

&gt;&gt; LOL--Wrapping the cat in a towel for a few minutes while having her
claws
&gt;&gt; clipped is &quot;inconvenient&quot; for her, but having her feet mutilated isn't?
&gt;&gt; That's an amazing feat of logic, John. It really is.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I can tell that you don't have a clue what makes her tick or
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;how to deal with it from a cat's point of view
&gt;&gt;&gt; That's not an insult, I know I don't know very much. That is why I
&gt; asked
&gt;&gt;&gt; the question in the first place. But I think that you on the other
hand
&gt;&gt;&gt; assume you know what makes a cat tick or how to deal with things from
a
&gt;&gt;&gt; cat's point of view and really don't know much more than me.

&gt;&gt; What makes you think I don't know any more than you? I have had cats
for
&gt;&gt; most of my life, and have faced all kinds of behavioral problems, from
&gt;&gt; clawing furniture, to crapping outside the box, to engaging in overly
&gt; rough
&gt;&gt; play. In order to deal with those problems, I have taken the time to
&gt; learn
&gt;&gt; what I could about cat behavior so that I could deal with undesirable
&gt;&gt; behaviors in a manner that was both effective and humane. I don't
&gt; *assume*
&gt;&gt; what makes cats tick; in most cases I *know*, and I know because I took
&gt; the
&gt;&gt; time to learn it, both through reading and observation. No, I don't
know
&gt;&gt; every

In response to the people who thought I mutilated my cats, the vet used a
new laser method which is a kinder way to remove the claws. She also used a
new skin glue instead of stitches. And, there is not one difference in
their personality. I tried in vain to teach them not to claw the furniture;
bought them scratching posts, sprayed the furniture with lemon juice, etc.
Nothing I did worked. So, after 9 years of trying to train them, I
reluctantly had their front claws removed. They still have their back ones.
Believe me, it really was the last thing I wanted to do.

"/> It's no less mutilation just because a different method of amputation was
used. If someone cut off all the tips of your fingers, I'm sure you'd feel
mutilated regardless of whether or not you felt any pain during the
procedure.

"/> Animals are extremely good at masking pain and discomfort, and they are
extremely good at adapting to handicaps and disabilities. It's a part of
their basic survival instinct. But just because they manage to cope,
doesn't make it right to disfigure them.

I rent and could not have cats unless they were declawed. They are all
rescued would it have been better to let them be euthanized than declawed?

Now that you are perfectly aware you are unsuitable
as a cat owner, we trust you'll have different pets
in the future, or refrain from having any at all.

*gasp* you mean your furniture would not be in mint condition?? My goodness! No
wonder you *mutilated* (and yes, no matter how you sugar coat it, it IS
mutilation) your cat. No bloody wonder.

*tut* *tut* scratches on the couch.. what *will* the neighbours think??
