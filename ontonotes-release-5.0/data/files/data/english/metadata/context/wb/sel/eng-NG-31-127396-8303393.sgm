Please get your facts correct.
[1] General Musharraf, Kings and Tyrants, Bush and Blair do not and
I repeat do not follow any religion.

[2] There is no war amongst Muslims.  Do you feel the noise of bomb
explosion against Army personnel in Pakistan?  Do you hear the noise
of attacks on US forces in Iraq and Afghanistan?  These are not civil
wars amongst Muslims.  Subas Chandra Bose was not fighting against
Indians.  He was fighting against British occupation.  When Ulemas were
up in arms in 1857, they were not engaged in fighting against their
countrymen.

[3] You are obsessed with JI.  The world and Pakistanis do not see
that way.  They are fighting againt America.  Just as their brothers
are fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan

[4] BY THE WAY, this discussion is futile because we see the cracks
in Pakistan Army occupation.  General Musharraf is in his last days.  His
talks with BB indicates that he is not acceptable to USA or to
Pakistanis.

In a conflict or war there are parties engaged in
killings. Who are the parties in Pakistan?

Party Number ONE - Pakistan Army - the occupiers
of Pakistan.

Party Number TWO - Lawyers who want rule of law NOT
one man rule.

Party Number THREE- Mullahs who are fighting against
the Army rule and resisting the occupation.

Whom do you support?
============================

Dear Shaikh Sahab,

To hell with every groups you mentioned above!

Since we all Exploit Islam so much particularly the
Rogue Jamat-e-Islami and other Mullahs therefore we
must follow it thoroughly in the first place. The only
thing allowed WHEN MUSLIMS ARE KILLING EACH OTHER LIKE
DOGS THEN TO AVOID THE FOLLOWING:

{And whoever kills a believer intentionally, his
recompense is Hell to abide therein, and the Wrath and
the Curse of Allaah are upon him, and a great
punishment is prepared for him}, [Soorah an-Nisaa,
Aayah 93].

Ahnaf b. Qais reported on the authority of Abu Bakra
that Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) said:
When two Muslims confront each other with their
swords, both the slayer and the slain are doomed to
Hell-Fire. [Sahih Muslim The Book Pertaining to the
Turmoil and Portents of the Last Hour (Kitab Al-Fitan
wa Ashrat As-Sa`ah]

And in the Sunan of An-Nasaa’ee, on the authority of
‘Abdullaah ibn ‘Amr, (radhi-yallaahu 'anhu), the
Prophet (sal-Allaahu `alayhe wa sallam) said:

((The cessation of the dunyaa (world) is less
significant to Allaah than the killing of a single
Muslim man (i.e. person)))

And one day, Ibn ‘Umar looked to the House, or the
Ka'bah, and said: ((How great you are, and how great
is your sanctity, and the believer is even greater in
sanctity to Allaah than you)) (Meaning that the haram
is safe and protected from fighting and bloodshed, and
the believer has even more right to be safe and
protected from bloodshed)

Usaamah bin Zaid reported, “Allaah’s Messenger sent us
towards Al-Huruqa, and in the morning we attacked them
and defeated them. I and an Ansari man followed a man
from among them and when we overwhelmed him, he said,
“La ilaha illal-Lah.” On hearing that, the Ansari man
stopped, but I killed him by stabbing him with my
spear. When we returned, the Prophet (sal-Allaahu
`alayhe wa sallam) came to know about that and he
said:

((O Usaamah! Did you kill him after he had said “La
ilaha ilal-Lah?” I said, “But he said so only to save
himself.” He kept on repeating that so often that I
wished I had not embraced Islam before that day))
[Agreed upon, and this is the wording of Bukhaaree.]

When the Muslims Community is afflicted with some
hardship then Qunoot-E-Naazilah should be recited in
the Fajr Salaat.

Method: After the Ruku' of the second rakaat, while
standing in the position known as Qaumah, the Qunoot
should be read in a voice lower in tone than when
reciting the Qiraat. The Muqtadees should place their
hands at the side and say Ameen at the proper
juncture.

Note: Women may also recite this dua softly.

One may recite it as often as possible as a dua.

Translation:

O Allah, guide us aright along with those who have
been rightly guided and grant us safety along with
those that have been granted safety and support us
along with those that have been supported and add Your
Blessings to what You have given us and save us from
the harmful effects of what You have ordained ( i.e.
lest I should be wanting in cheerfully submitting to
your Decrees) as You alone disposes and no one can
dispose against You. Anyone who is under Your
Protection cannot be lowered and anyone who is opposed
by You cannot gain dignity; our Lord; You are full of
blessings and Most High, we beg forgiveness from You
and repent before You and may the blessings of Allah
be showered on the Holy Prophet (Sallallaahu Alayhi Wa
Sallam). O Allah, forgive us and the believing men and
women and Muslim men and women, unite their hearts
with mutual love, set right their mutual affairs and
help them against theirs and Your enemy. O Allah, let
Your curse be on those unbelievers who prevent people
from treading Your path, who reject Your prophets and
fight Your chosen ones. O Allah, make difficult their
plans, shake their feet and give them such punishment
which is not turned away from a sinning people. [Al
Behaqi,

Aameen

Dear Shaikh Sahab,

We Muslims every year celebrate Special Days in the
Name of Companions [a severe Bida'at &quot;Innovatio&quot;]of
the Prophet Mohammad [PBUH]

The advice of one such companion [RA] for such
turbulent times:

When fitnah occurs, remain in your house
When turmoil (fitnah) occurs, remain within your house
[1] and flee from the neighbourhood of tumult. Beware
of blind following and every case of fighting between
Muslims for this world is discord and a trial. Fear
Allah, who is alone, having no partner. Do not go out
in it, do not fight in it, do not take part in it, do
not take sides in it, nor incline towards either
(side) and do not have love for any of their affairs,
since it is said, “He who loves the deeds of a people,
good or bad, is just like the one who commits them.”
May Allah grant us and you those things pleasing to
Him and keep us away from disobedience to Him.

Ibn az-Zubayr narrates: My close friend,
Abul-Qaasim (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) advised me,
“If you reach anything of the tumult (fitnah), go to
Uhud and blunt your sword upon it, then remain in your
house.” Reported by Ahmad in al-Musnad. Its isnaad is
hasan, as has been mentioned by Shaikh al-Albaanee
(rahimahullaah) in as-Saheehah.
