1)  Iraq: Bomb kills nine en route to Shiite shrine
MSNBC

&quot;A car bomb exploded in Baghdad on Sunday next to a parked minibus waiting
for worshippers to board and travel to a Shiite shrine in the Iraqi capital,
a police officer said. The blast killed nine people, including two boys, 9
and 14 years old. After the blast, police banned cars from the area
surrounding the shrine in the Kazimiyah district until further notice, the
officer said.&quot; (10/14/07)

&quot;Russian President Vladimir Putin has been told about a plot to assassinate
him during a visit to Iran this week, a Kremlin spokeswoman said Sunday. The
spokeswoman, who spoke on customary condition of anonymity, refused further

3)  CA: Schwarzenegger vetoes marriage equality again
San Francisco Chronicle

&quot;Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger vetoed a same-sex marriage bill Friday, the
second time in three years that such a measure died on the governor's desk.
Schwarzenegger vetoed a similar bill in 2005. 'I support current domestic
partnership rights and will continue to vigorously defend and enforce these
rights,' the governor said in a statement Friday. In his veto message, the
Republican governor said it is up to the state Supreme Court and then, if
necessary, voters to alter Proposition 22, which defines marriage as between
a man and a woman in California. The California Supreme has agreed to decide
on the constitutionality of Prop. 22, but the justices are not expected to
hear the case until next year.&quot; (10/13/07)

4)  GA: Victim disarmers bust rapper
New York Daily News

&quot;Grammy Award-winning rapper T.I. allegedly was in the process of building a
massive 'arsenal' at his suburban Atlanta home when he was arrested for
allegedly using his bodyguard to buy machine guns and silencers, authorities
said Sunday. 'This convicted felon allegedly was trying to add several
machine guns to an already large, and entirely illegal, arsenal of guns,'
charged David Nahmias, U.S. attorney for the Northern District of Georgia.
Federal agents nabbed the rapper and actor Saturday when he arrived at a
store parking lot to pick up three machine guns and two silencers from his
bodyguard, authorities alleged. He was arrested just hours before he was
scheduled to perform at the BET Hip-Hop Awards -- where, despite his
no-show, he won two awards.&quot; (10/15/07)

6)  Tech titans seek virtual world interoperability
CNet News

&quot;Welcome to virtual world interoperability: a new era where the many
previously walled-garden virtual worlds can share content, currency and even
identity, all in the guise of making life easier for end users and, ideally,
for enterprises trying to leverage the Second Lifes of the world for
businesses purposes. Unfortunately for those who like that notion of
interoperability, it's not going to be happening just yet. But a group of
representatives from some of the biggest and most powerful technology
companies on earth -- including IBM, Cisco Systems, Intel, Microsoft,
Motorola, Google and Sony, as well as from leading virtual-world developers
like Second Life publisher Linden Lab, the Multiverse Network, Mindark and
others -- is hoping to change that in the not too distant future.&quot;

in Jerusalem. In the latest case, he is suspected of granting political

two sides are at bitter odds over an outline of a peace agreement that would

on 'prohibition.' His comments come as the Home Office this week ends the
process of gathering expert advice looking at the next 10 years of strategy.
In his radical analysis, which he will present to the North Wales Police

21) Netherlands bans sale of hallucinogenic mushrooms
Arizona Republic

&quot;The Netherlands will ban the sale of hallucinogenic mushrooms, the
government announced Friday, tightening the country's famed liberal drug
policies after the suicide of an intoxicated teenage girl. The ban, in
response to the death and other highly publicized adverse reactions
involving the fungus, is the latest backlash against the freewheeling
policies of the past. Psilocybin, the main active chemical in the mushrooms,
has been illegal under international law since 1971. However, fresh
mushrooms continued to be sold legally in the Netherlands, along with herbal
medicines in so-called 'smart-shops,' on the theory that it was impossible
to determine how much psilocybin any given mushroom contains.&quot; [editor's

able to obtain a substance ... leads to its banning for adults as well -

picnic in Las Vegas. 'This race is not over. ... We've got three months to

from the primary ballot in Michigan, despite a promise not to campaign in
the state because it broke party rules in scheduling the contest before Feb.
5. Clinton is the front-runner. 'She wants to have it both ways, you're

that are clear, that take strong positions.'&quot; (10/14/07)

&quot;Children's issues will top the agenda on Capitol Hill this week, as
Democrats try to override President Bush's veto of a popular child-health
bill. It's a moment of political drama that could tip close congressional

children's health in the US and abroad. House Democrats call it 'Bush versus
the kids.' They put off an override vote for 15 days after Mr. Bush's Oct. 3
veto of a bill to renew the State Children's Health Insurance Program
(S-CHIP) -- that's about a day for every new GOP vote they need to prevail.
Meanwhile, Democrats and outside groups are stepping up ad campaigns

26) The WarOn Commission Report
from Reason to Freedom
by Garry Reed

&quot;This war [on poverty] has been a very successful project for the
Lefty-whimpery-whiny social welfare crowd since President Johnson launched
it in 1964. Because of the various change-as-needed definitions of 'poverty'
the program will never run out of 'welfare fodder.' For example, by sheer
mathematics there will always and forever be a 'bottom one fifth of the
population' which takes the definition of poverty to infinity. This has
become somewhat problematic in the last few years since so many 'poor'
Americans live in houses, own TV sets and automobiles. Certain people
identifying themselves as 'libertarian' have taken to calling the program
The War On Relative Poverty, noting that by Third World standards the
program recipients are practically rich. But this objection is muted by the
crush of do-gooder propaganda, and the War On Poverty should continue to
provide careers, benefits and comfortable retirements for the lefty/liberal
bureaucratic classes forever.&quot; (10/14/07)

27) The end
The Libertarian Enterprise
by L. Neil Smith

&quot;Bad enough that this government, exactly like Lenin's and Stalin's before
it, kidnaps individuals, and illegally imprisons and tortures them; bad
enough that it starved half a million Iraqi children to death by denying
their country access to world trade; bad enough that it's erecting all sorts
of internal barriers in this country and plans to demand that Americans
obtain passports to travel from Colorado to Utah. The Bush regime is also
issuing all sorts of directives to the researchers in colleges and
universities about who can work on what, and with whom they can discuss it.
These directives, little known by the general public, have made the conduct
of science appreciably harder over the past several years and may even
threaten to make it impossible. Add to that the more general rape of the
Bill of Rights -- the one thing that ever made America different from the
rest of the world -- the collapse of the economy in general and the dollar
in particular, and you have the sort of picture that let me predict the fall
of the Soviets.&quot; (10/14/07)

invisible. Even though some people give him a lot of credit for extensive

32) Blowing people up: The fun, cool, Christian thing to do
The Price of Liberty
by Doug Newman

&quot;Mr. Proctor discusses some of the more outlandish ways churches are
recruiting new people nowadays. The one that caught my eye was a church here
in Metro Denver that I have attended on and off for several years. He refers
to a New York Times article on the use of this Halo game to attract
teenagers. I watched a few Halo videos on YouTube. This is violent stuff!
What is it doing in church? Christians are famous for crusading against
excessive sex and violence in entertainment. They remind us time and again
that life imitates art. (After Columbine -- 10 miles from Colorado Community
Church -- much was made of the killers' penchant for violent video games.)
However, if violent material gets kids into church, who cares? ... Christ

33) Save the New Hampshire primary
Salon
by Walter Shapiro

&quot;Bill Gardner, the doggedly nonpartisan New Hampshire secretary of state, is
the keeper of the flame of the first-in-the-nation primary, a modern-day
Horatio at the Bridge holding off the uninformed hordes who fail to
appreciate this small New England state's unique status in the political
firmament. Unlike anyone else in the galaxy, Gardner boasts the superpower
to schedule his state's presidential primary by personal fiat without
consulting the governor, the state Legislature or either political party.
Gardner is guided by a single North Star -- the wording of the New Hampshire
statute that decrees that the secretary of state shall set a day for the
primary 'which is 7 days or more preceding the date on which any other state
shall hold a similar election.'&quot; (10/15/07)

34) Making the Old Right new
The American Spectator
by W. James Antle III

&quot;Paul's real goal may be even more audacious than trying to get to the White
House -- reviving an older conservatism that is more skeptical of military
interventions and restoring the Robert Taft wing of the Republican Party.
Paul admits that the latter more or less died with Senator Taft during the
Eisenhower administration, though he sees the Facebook friends who come out
to support him on the campaign trail as proof it can be resurrected. Even
Congress's libertarian happy antiwarrior must know this is a tall order.&quot;

35) Our capacity to think
Rebirth of Reason
by Manfred F. Schieder

&quot;Knowledge is not and cannot be obtained in any easy way. It requires a
constant effort, a never-ending study and the permanent updating of the
knowledge, the data and the informations throughout life. It is the
continuous process of thought applied to questions and problems posed by
nature and its interconnections with human beings. It is the process of
deducing conclusions and applying them to the reality which surrounds us and
in which we live. It is what makes the human characteristic of 'homo
sapiens-sapiens.' The continued co-existence of faith and reason in the
modern world is the biggest contradiction of all possible contradictions.&quot;

interesting that the feds went after him. And I was sort of inclined to say
'Eh, maybe we can give him a free pass on this one, seeing as how he stood

37) American lawbreaking
Slate
by Tim Wu

&quot;There will, of course, always be some lawbreaking that goes unpunished
simply because law enforcement is expensive -- not every shoplifter is
caught, and it's not worth expending the resources to catch every
kleptomaniac. But the areas we will look at here are different: What's going
on here is that the parties all know the law is being broken, accept it, and
-- while almost never overtly saying so -- both the 'criminals' and law
enforcement concede that everyone likes it better that way. The law in
question thus continues to have a formal existence, and, as we shall see, it
may become a kind of zoning ordinance, enforced only against very public or
flagrant behavior. But few, except sometimes a vocal minority, actually
think we'd be better off if the law were fully enforced.&quot; (10/14/07)

38) Big Sister is watching you
National Review
by Whittaker Chambers

&quot;That Dollar Sign is not merely provocative, though we sense a sophomoric
intent to raise the pious hair on susceptible heads. More importantly, it is
meant to seal the fact that mankind is ready to submit abjectly to an elite
of technocrats, and their accessories, in a New Order, enlightened and
instructed by Miss Rand's ideas that the good life is one which 'has
resolved personal worth into exchange value,' 'has left no other nexus
between man and man than naked self-interest, than callous 'cash-payment.&quot;
The author is explicit, in fact deafening, about these prerequisites. Lest
you should be in any doubt after 1,168 pages, she assures you with a final
stamp of the foot in a postscript: 'And I mean it.' But the words quoted
above are those of Karl Marx. He, too, admired 'naked self-interest' (in its
time and place), and for much the same reasons as Miss Rand: because, he
believed, it cleared away the cobwebs of religion and led to prodigies of
industrial and cognate accomplishment. The overlap is not as incongruous as
it looks. Atlas Shrugged can be called a novel only by devaluing the term.&quot;

&quot;Few people would argue with the fact that the Internet is driving economic

could open for students, workers, and consumers in the future. So, why would

dictatorial regime in its neighborhood and they can connect that to the 2008
Olympics, that will scare the shit out of Beijing.' But China is not the
only country doing business with Burma, only the largest. In recent years
India has made an about-face, shifting dramatically from a policy of
supporting opposition party leader Aung San Suu Kyi, the pro-democracy
movement and criticizing the military government, to courting the junta,
cooperating on cross-border anti-insurgency campaigns, and bidding for
Burma's natural resources.&quot; (10/01/07)

after eight years in power (viz. the elections of 1960, 1968, 1976, and
2000). And the Republican presidential candidates seem problematic, each in

If anger over the U.S. Supreme Court's contemptible Kelo decision remains at
a healthy simmer, the land-grabbers on the Riverside city council could face
the necessity of searching for real jobs; if voters' memories are as short

AlterNet
by Robert Jereski

&quot;If you're riding the 'L' in Chicago or taking a stroll down the boardwalks
of Greenport, Long Island, or Santa Monica, Calif., you are connected to an
international movement away from the most destructive use of the world's
remaining rainforests -- industrial timber extraction. Almost two decades of
environmental advocacy has shown significant gains: the park benches in Los
Angeles are made from locally sourced wood, the subway ties under Chicago's
'L' train and the boardwalks at the Saw Mill River Audubon wetlands
preserves are made from recycled plastic lumber. Millions of acres of
pristine rain forests are no longer being felled so Americans can park our
asses or wipe our feet on the world's trees. But for New Yorkers, many
pleasant experiences the city has to offer bring us unwittingly closer to
the obliteration of the most ecologically dynamic part of the world -- the
Amazonian rain forest.&quot; (10/15/07)

46) How to win a Nobel Peace Prize
Reason
by Jesse Walker

&quot;In the last decade, Al Gore has won the triple crown: an Oscar, a Nobel
Peace Prize, and (this is disputed) Florida. Now, winning an Oscar is hard
-- you usually have to pretend to be handicapped, or speak with a
semi-convincing English accent, or spend hours in an uncomfortable period
costume. And Gore himself would have trouble telling you how to claim the
Sunshine State. But the Nobel Prize is easy. The important thing to remember
is that peace doesn't have much to do with it. One of the very first winners
was Theodore Roosevelt, a man who described the Spanish-American War as
'fun.' The Peace Prize is more of a Humanitarian of the Year Award, with
humanitarian defined loosely enough to include Yasser Arafat and Henry
Kissinger.&quot; (10/12/07)

47) Be not afraid
Cato Institute
by Jerry Taylor and Peter Van Doren

&quot;During the last week of September, 2003, oil was selling in U.S. spot
markets for $23.86 a barrel. If one asked economists back then what would
happen to the economy if oil prices were to hit $80 four years hence, they
would have almost certainly predicted economic ruin. But the inflation,
unemployment, and recession that supposedly follow oil price shocks are
nowhere on the macroeconomic radar screen. If the economy goes into a
tailspin, it will be in response to bad news in the housing market, not the
oil market. The lesson to be derived from this is pretty clear: While
oil-price spirals are certainly nothing for consumers to celebrate, the
widespread belief that the health of the American economy is held hostage to
oil markets is, for the most part, incorrect.&quot; (10/15/07)

&quot;American exceptionalism -- the view that America is unique among nations --
is a treasured creed. That's why it is so troubling to observe radical
changes in American public life that threaten to make the United States look
like many other countries, including those in the so-called third world.
Consider four important dimensions: a comfort level with growing wealth and
income disparities, the embracing of previously eschewed means in combating
national security threats, a loss of confidence in the integrity of the
election process and in the judicial system that is its ultimate arbiter,
and a trend toward political dynasty. Americans have always embraced
capitalism and accepted the legitimacy of the highly variable standards of
living it produces.&quot; [editor's note: If the concept of &quot;America&quot; ever

&quot;Running into one obstacle after another, opponents of the war in Iraq are
shifting tactics to prevent any steps that would prolong the bloody

to set timetables for U.S. troop withdrawals or reassign more soldiers to
non-combat roles. Each time, President Bush was able to use his veto power
or congressional Republicans were called upon by the administration to block
legislation. With the weight of public opinion solidly on the side of
Democrats in this endeavor, the failures have been disheartening -- no more
so than when the president called for a $190 billion increase in spending on
Iraq and Afghanistan through September 2008. It's the largest single request
for those conflicts since they began. The amount is staggering on its own;
added to the half-trillion dollars already spent on Iraq, it's almost
unthinkable.&quot; (10/13/07)

71) Pistols, property and pogo sticks

In response to my in-line editorial comment on an RRND blurb, DC Collins
asks &quot;What is that sound? Could it be? Why yes it is! It is the sound of
pogosticks merrily hopping down the street.&quot;

Background: A long time ago, on a list far, far away, a number of us had the
&quot;owner banning possession of weapons on his property?&quot; argument. I argued
from the position that a property owner's rights are absolute in that
respect -- analogizing that if the owner requires anyone entering his
property to do so unarmed ... or, for that matter, naked and hopping on a
pogo stick ... then the ethical alternatives are to a) comply with the
owner's requirements, or b) decline to enter the property.

Others advanced various opposing arguments, including but not limited to the
notion that if a gun is inside one's clothes, it's on the gun carrier's
property and not the external property being entered, etc.

Hey, I have an idea! Let's have that argument here!

&quot;On April 16, 2007, twenty-seven students and five faculty members at
Virginia Tech lost their lives to a madman who possessed one distinct
advantage over his victims -- He was not concerned with following the rules.
Undeterred by Virginia Tech's status as a 'gun free zone,' this mentally
unstable individual carried two handguns onto the university campus and
indiscriminately opened fire. During the week of October 22-27, 2007,
college students throughout America will attend classes wearing empty
holsters, in protest of state laws and campus policies that stack the odds
in favor of armed killers by disarming law abiding citizens who are licensed
to carry concealed handguns virtually everywhere else.&quot; (10/09/07)
