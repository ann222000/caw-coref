My husband and I went to Loon Lake Lodge in November.  I wanted a light
dinner do I ordered their Mandarin Orange Chicken Salad.   It is NOT
GF.  What I was fascinated with was the feathery noodles on top.  I
could tell they were rice because they had the appearance of cellophane
(rice) noodles.  Today I called the restaurant to see what they are
called she told me they are just called rice noodles and maybe I could
find them at the international store.  The noodles are so light and
feathery.  They have a very slight crunch and remind me of chow mien
noodles except they are are lighter and made  of rice.  If anyone knows
the name of this product and where I can find it, I would be  very
grateful.  I know this salad is not GF because there was another light
cracker in it that did not look GF.  The woman I talked with told me
that she was getting her information from a waitress/server that knew
about GF food.

Don't know what those particular noodles were, but Asian/Oriental markets carry a large assortment of noodles and pastas made from rice.  We especially like the vermicelli.

This noodle is not served cooked.   It is light, short, curly, and is
slightly crunchy.  I will check the International Mart the next time I
go.

Hi Nancy.  Actually the noodle IS served cooked.  It is put into hot
oil (most Asians do this in a big wok) and they puff up into that
wonderful texture.

Scroll down this page to what are called &quot;thin rice stick noodles&quot;
and &quot;rice vermicelli&quot;:
http://www.foodsubs.com/NoodlesRice.html

These are the noodles you want to look for.  You can cook these as
little thin noodles by soaking them in water or broth -- or drop them
into about 2-3&quot; of very hot oil (just a small clump at a time) and
they will pop up, after a few seconds, transforming into beautiful
white crunchy noodles.  I remember the first time I did it I wasn't
expecting it at all, and jumped about 10 feet when the clump of
noodles puffed up to about 5 times its size!  I was just following a
recipe that said &quot;fry the noodles in the hot oil.&quot;  It is quite fun
to do actually, once you get the hang of it.  As you are looking for
these (because there are so many thin rice noodles), read the
preparation labels on the packages -- and I think you'll find the
ones that puff up because there will be frying instructions as well
as reconstituting instructions.

Have fun!

Hi Nancy,

When I saw this post to the list, I wasn't sure if I was totally
clear.  You don't soak them first and then fry them.  I meant you can
choose to use them are more traditional noodles, by soaking in hot
liquid.  OR, you can fry them into puffy, crispy noodles by putting
them DRY (not soaked or reconstituted) directly into 2-3&quot; of very hot
oil.

Thanks Suzanne,

I found out how to make them:
http://www.ehow.com/how_2150226_fry-rice-noodles.html?ref=fuel and a
picture that is similar to what they look like.  See
http://www.flickr.com/photos/mundozurdo/149699880/ The ones at the
rerstaurant  were white, not yellowed by oils. My daughter is away so
we'll try them at a time when she is here.  My son wouldn't be
interested in them.  I like it when she is the one cooking.  She like
to make GF crepes  with her sisters and friends.

I don't go out very often.  In fact the restaurant business would grind
to a halt if they had to depend on people like me.  Fortunately others
help pave the way so that I can enjoy the variety when I do go out.
The grilled chicken mandarin orange salad is very good.  Now that I
know that the noodles were fried in oil I wonder if the oil is
contaminated.  I don't have CD but I would wonder if my children went
there.  They have a wheat flour cracker amongst the layers of the
salad.  It gives it more texture and I guess flavor.  I don't know if
the sauce is GF.  All this to say that maybe it could be prepared sans
wheat crackers to make it GF that is if everything else is GF.   If
anyone has experience with Loon Lake Lodge I would be interested in
knowing.  When I called yesterday about the noodles the woman who
answered told me she asked a server who knew about GF foods.  I really
enjoyed going there.

Again, thank you for telling me that they are fried.

Nancy

Hi Nancy,

Yep!  Those are the way they are cooked, for sure!

As for oils, if you use (as I think the instructions suggest) peanut
or coconut oil, I'm pretty sure they won't be yellowed.  I just
wouldn't use something like olive oil, which doesn't get up to as
high a temperature, and also can have more yellow or green to it in
color.

Let us know how it goes!  They are really tasty, as you found out,
and fun to make, especially if you've got a daughter inspired to do
the work!  LOL!

Regarding Loon Lake Lodge, you wrote:

I really like Loon Lake Lodge, too -- but it's a place we went
pre-GF, I fear.  I did end up going there last year for a friend's
50th birthday party.  I was prepared not to eat at all -- but they
were very kind in figuring out something I could eat.  However, there
wasn't much that was safe at all.  I ended up with a plain hamburger
patty (no seasoning) and cooked green beans (no seasoning).  It was
REALLY the only thing they thought they could make for me.  I have to
say, that it's hard (for me) going to restaurants where there are
such great things to eat, and being relegated to something so
distinctly &quot;not fun.&quot;  On a side note, the manager told me that he
had someone come in who was allergic to garlic.  He said there was
actually not ONE thing in the restaurant he could safely serve to her
-- that either all dishes contained garlic, or would be too easily
contaminated.  With me, he was delighted he could figure out at least
something I could eat.

I'll be personally happy to learn if, in more recent times, anyone
has eaten successfully at Loon Lake -- it's such a comfortable and
enjoyable restaurant.

Suzanne,
Most, if not all, of the things we buy at the Oriental Market do not have instructions in English.  I try to find out from the sales person how to cook them, but sometimes even that doesn't work.  Appreciate someone sharing their cooking methods.
