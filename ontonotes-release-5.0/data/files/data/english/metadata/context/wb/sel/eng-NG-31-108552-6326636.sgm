Battery didn't work in fire alarm again. Why don't engineer and
science make a battery that work in fire alarm?

Nine dead in NYC house fireFire in New York's Bronx kills woman, 8
children from extended family, injures many

March 8, 2007 (NEW YORK) - Screams poured from the burning building
along with smoke and flames: "Help me! Help me! Please! Please!"
Bystanders looked up to see a woman toss two children out the window
one at a time to those below.

The scene unfolded early Thursday during New York's deadliest fire in
nearly two decades -- a blaze that killed eight children and one
adult, part of an extended family led by African immigrants who shared
a row house near Yankee Stadium.
The children tossed from the three-story building survived,
authorities said. The woman who threw them jumped but survived.

The fire was sparked by an overheated space heater near a mattress in
a basement bedroom, then raced up a stairway pushed by air from broken
back windows, said Fire Chief Salvatore Cassano. Most of the 22
residents -- 17 of them children -- were stranded on the upper floors
as the blaze raged for two hours.

"I can't recollect a fire where we lost eight children," Cassano
said.

Neighbor Edward Soto ran toward the fire, then stared in disbelief as
an infant was tossed from the building.

"All I see is just a big cloud of white dust, and out of nowhere comes
the first baby," said Soto, who caught the child while with another
neighbor. Moments later, he caught a second child. At least one of the
children was not breathing.

Firefighters worked for two hours in freezing predawn temperatures to
bring the flames under control. The home had two smoke alarms, but
neither had batteries. Police said there was no evidence of a crime.

The dead were found throughout the house, mostly on the upper floors,
with babies still in their cribs. The victims included five children
from one family, along with a wife and three other children from a
second family.

Word of the fire spread grief across two continents, from the Bronx to
villages in Mali, a West African country about twice the size of Texas
and one of the poorest nations in the world.

"I don't know what I'm going to do," said a devastated Mamadou
Soumare, a livery cabdriver whose wife, son and 7-month-old twins died
in the blaze. "I love her. I love my wife."

Soumare was driving through Harlem when he received a frantic cell
phone call from his wife, Fatoumata, who relatives said died in the
fire. "She said, `We have a fire,"' Soumare recalled. "She was
screaming."

Soumare rushed home in his cab, only to helplessly watch as their home
turned into a fiery tomb.

Moussa Magassa, an official of the New York chapter of the High
Council for Malians Living Abroad, was headed back to the city from a
business trip to Mali after receiving the grim news that nearly half
of his 11 children were dead, said council representative Bourema
Niambele.

"He's the best in our community," said Imam Mahamadou Soukouna, a
Muslim cleric and family friend. "It's very, very, very sad what has
happened to us today."

Magassa arrived in New York about 15 years ago, friends said. One
neighbor said Magassa and Mamadou Soumare were brothers. Fatoumata
Soumare was from the village of Tasauirga and left Mali for the Bronx
about six years ago, friends said.

The death toll might have been higher if not for the efforts of Soto
and another neighbor, David Todd.

Todd, 40, who lived next door, said one child was already on the
ground in the yard when he arrived with Soto outside the burning home.
"Please God, help my children!" the woman inside screamed while
tossing the children out -- and then jumping from the window.

Another neighbor, Elaine Martin, said flames were shooting from the
building when she arrived, and a shoeless woman in a nightgown stood
crying in the street.

"My kids is in there, my kids is in there," the woman wailed to
Martin.

Neighbor Charles O'Neal, 21, watched as firefighters passed along
babies still in their pajamas. Later, O'Neal saw two of the children
dead, splayed across white plastic on the ground.

There were reports of 19 injuries, including four firefighters and an
emergency medical worker. A 7-year-old girl remained in critical
condition, while a pair of 6-year-olds and a 24-year-old were in
stable condition.

Part of the problem, according to Mayor Michael Bloomberg, was that
residents apparently tried to extinguish the fire themselves.

"Once they were notified, the Fire Department was on the scene in a
little more than three minutes," the mayor said. "Sadly, that was not
enough time."

The home did not have a fire escape and was not required to under city
building codes. There were no complaints or violations on record
against the building, constructed in 1901.

In February, Moussa Magassa applied for a permit to divide the
building into three apartments. Such a change would have required a
fire escape or other evacuation route, city buildings department
spokeswoman Kate Lindquist said.

The dead, according to family members, included Fatoumata Soumare, 42,
and three children: a son, Dgibril, and 7-month-old twins, Sisi and
Harouma. A fourth child, 7-year-old Hasimy, escaped the carnage, her
father said.

The family members provided different name spellings than the
authorities did.

Authorities identified the members of the Magassa family as four
brothers: Bandiougou, 11, Mahamadou, 8, Abudubucary, 5, and Bilaly, 1;
and their sister, 3-year-old Diaba.

Varying accounts had the families' names spelled differently.

The fire was New York City's deadliest since the 1990 Happy Land
social club blaze in the Bronx that killed 87 people.

I'm afraid it's not within the ability of science or engineering to make
a battery which will work in a fire alarm when it's been removed from
the fire alarm. Some solution other than science and engineering is
needed to solve this problem. Perhaps you can think of one.

My question...How can you expect the fire alarm system to work if the
batteries were taken out.?  Or did I miss something?...

That's an interesting concept - compulsory connection to the
grid.  It also raises issues about non-payment of electricity
bills.

Of course not.
99.99% of housing stock in those markets has electricity.

(I'm thinking of rental housing stock in the UK)

How about a non-accessible lithium primary battery that's big enough to
last 10 years (life of the alarm).

pp3 - 4Wh or so, lasts a couple of years.
So, that's around 20Wh or so for a lithium cell, or at 3V, 6Ah.
A quick wander round indicates that the price is around a tenner.

Contemplate how many people wandering round woolworths will pick the
13.99 alarm, versus the 3.99 one.

Well, have you ever wander around your house in the middle of the night,
trying to figure out which fire-alarm makes this nasty pip-sound once
a minute? Than making a trip to Walmart to get the new batteries - 2$
for gasoline and 1 hr of your time + price for the battery 1-2$? Than getting the ladder and taking
alarm out? Putting the battery in - not the easiest exercise?
All of this repeated every 2-3 years for each alarm you have?

Considering all above, 13.99 might not be too much to ask... In
fact you might just break even for battery/gasoline price alone,
not considering time and work.
