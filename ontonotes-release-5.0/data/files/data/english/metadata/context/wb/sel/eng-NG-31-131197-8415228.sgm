NOTE FROM ME:  The  Sheriff's Office in Pinellas County, Florida Sheriff's
Office is having a book  drive for underprivileged children.   The book drive
ends on the  22nd.  If you need more info, let me know and I'll get you in
contact with  a person who is a dancer who works with the Sheriff's office.

SUBJECT: United Way Children’s Book Drive, Pinellas County, FL

Too many children in our community do not have books of their own to  read.
How well children read will ultimately affect how they learn and how
successful their future will be. The more variety of reading materials there are  in
the home, the more likelihood for greater reading ability.
The Pinellas  County Sheriff’s Office is joining the United Way Children’s
Book Drive  occurring now through August 22. We are asking for new or slightly
used books  for children ages four through eleven. Please deposit them in the
box located in  your Division. All books collected will be delivered to the
United Way Campaign  Kickoff, August 23m at Tropicana Field.
Children in low-income elementary  schools will receive these books as their
own through the efforts of the United  Way Children’s Book Drive. More then
25,000 children in Pinellas and  Hillsborough Counties schools will benefit from
these books.
Please, let us  give our children a better chance to improve their reading
and hopefully their  lives.

near St Augustine  FL
Wanda Fulton AL
My husband Keith and I are taking our  annual anniversary trip the third week
in September and plan on staying in St  Augustine. We are couples lead and
follow CW mainly Two Step, I enjoy line  dancing too. He prefers places that
serve beer. We are looking for places to  dance within 50 miles or so, we may be
traveling through Jacksonville as well  and going South to Cape Kennedy. The
list of places on this letter are great but  I am not sure of the locations.
Any one have  suggestions?

( http://www.spreadyourwingsanddance.com )
It was great to visit with so many friends yesterday at the Sizzlin' Hot
Summer Bash in Lakeland, FL. James Gregory was fun and entertaining as always!
Sorry to say that Terri Alexander was ill on Saturday and could not join us,
but  Lindy Bowers and Nettie Manzo stepped in on short notice and covered those
spots. Kathy Brown and I kept the dancers busy the rest of the time. Thanks
to  all of you who joined my classes. A number of folks were interested in the
beginner dances I did, but I was really pleased at the response to Maggie
Gallagher's awesome night club two, &quot;GUARDIAN ANGEL&quot; that I taught in the
afternoon. It is 32 counts/4walls with one restart and the music is wonderful.
Take a look if you haven't seen it.
I had three newbies from my beginner  class who made this their first ever
&quot;event&quot; and they loved it! And they did so  well! They are already asking me
about the next one. (By the way, the next  beginner workshop for me will be the
&quot;Gonna Make U Dance&quot; on October 20, 2007 in  Orlando at the Whirl &amp; Twirl. That
is where we hold the monthly Sunday  Social. See my website for more details
on that one.)
Another dance I wrote  to Carol about on Friday night was Rep Ghazali's fun
beginner dance &quot;BARKING UP  THE WRONG TREE&quot;, a rockabilly tune by Don Woody.
The response I have received  from that posting has just been amazing! And I
just read in the Sunday  newsletter a post from Arline Winerman who met Rep and
learned his dance while  in Scotland recently. Since she is teaching it at her
country club, she is  dancing it to a country song.
CLASS AGENDA:
This week in our Tuesday  class we will be introducing Rob Fowler's COUNTRY
GIRL. We have been hearing a  lot of buzz about this high beginner 32/4 dance
with one easy tag. The song by  Rissi Palmer is a sort of cool &quot;Gretchen Wilson
sound&quot; with a lot of attitude.  Looks like fun! We will also review BARKING
UP THE WRONG TREE, NIMBY and A  COWBOY AND A DANCER.
On Wednesday night we will introduce SHAKE IT UP by Pat  &amp; Lizzie Stott and
Stephen Rutter. This is a very upbeat pop song and the  dance is 32/4 with one
restart. We will also re-teach GUARDIAN ANGEL and review  TO LOVE SOMEBODY,
GIVE IT BACK, PUCKER UP and YOU'RE THE INSPIRATION.
More  Later!

Subject: jg2 Sizzlin  Hot Summer Bash
Lakeland, Florida
Well it's done and  stress level back to normal. Wonderful day of dancing
with my good friends and  all the new dancers that I met this weekend. We had two
glitches in the day, my  good friend Terri Alexander who got sick the night
before (hope she's feeling  better) had to cancel, so my other friends took
over for her at the last minute.  And I mean last minute. Lindy Bowers graciously
took her slot and kept Terri's  slot running smoothly, and Nettie Manzo
popped in a quicky dance on the sly.  Thanks a bunch ladies.
The second glitch, we arrived and management said  they had problems with the
A/C and my heart fluttered. But they ended up giving  us 2 of the larger
rooms. So we had over 10,000sq ft. of dance space. The  facility was beautiful,
and we were taken care of. The concession was just  outside our door which was
very convienent.
Thanks to Sandy Albano for not  only teaching but bringing the DJ equipment
and spinning the discs all day and  night. She keep the requests going. Thanks
to my friend Katie who manned the  door and also was learning to DJ. And to
John Alexander who DJ'd in the back  room and had some of the same illness that
Terri had but was a trooper and kept  on truckin.
Dances done were: Ain't Crazy, Love Train, Stay Another Day, Eye  Candy, Code
Red, Who Me, Cooties, Return to Sender, Honey Kisses, Knock em back,
Disavaro Cha, Everyday Distraction, Guardian Angel, Bridges to your heart.
Thanks to all the instructors, James Gregory, Sandy Albano, Lindy Bowers,
Nettie Manzo who kept the dancers on the floor all day. Thanks to all the
dancers that travelled far and wide to the event, so we had a good mix of
intermediate and beginners.

SUBJECT: 2007 WOW LINE DANCE WEEKEND-A REVIEW
FROM: MIKE  COHEN-MIDDLETOWN, N.J.
Hi Dancers,
Well, WOW 2007 has  been written into line dance history. Judy Chen and her
staff can be very proud  of the excellent program they put together for all of
us to enjoy. I discovered  that I was the second person to sign up for WOW
back in February and I waited a  long time for this weekend. All my expectations
were fully realized.
I  cannot say enough about the staff of instructors-The very beautiful &amp;
talented Rachael McEnaney, Scott Blevins, the unbelievable Guyton Mundy (what
talent), the very personable Steve Lescarbeau, Mr.Dangerous, John Robinson, Joey
Warren, Brian McWherter, Max Perry &amp; Kathy Hunyadi, the always fun Joanne
Brady, the team of Doug &amp; Jackie Miranda, and the multi-talented Barry &amp;  Dari
Ann Amato.
These are some of the dance highlights and dances whose  lessons I took this
weekend:
La Charanga-Rachael McEnaney-Certainly one of  the most played &amp; requested
dances. Music is La Charanga by Cubaila-32 Ct-4  wall with 1 restart-You'll love
it!
Give It Back-Rachael McEnaney-Music is  Give It Back by Gaelle-32 Ct-4
Walls-played constantly.
Fool In Love-Barry  Amato-Music is Fool In Love by Tina Turner from the
soundtrack to the movie  &quot;What's Love Got To Do with It&quot;. (Barry recommends this
version only)-32 Ct with  16 Ct Tag
Swing Bella Bella-Max Perry-Music is Bei Mir Bist Du Schon by  Janice Seigel
on the &quot;Swing Kids&quot; Soundtrack-A beginner &quot;novelty&quot; dance 4-wall,  64 count.
NIMBY-Maggie Gallagher-very popular. Called as a split-floor dance  with
&quot;Jukebox&quot;. NIMBY is a 64 Ct, 4 -wall dance. Taught by John Robinson
World On A String-Patrick Fleming-Music is I've Got TheWorld on A String by
Michael Buble. As taught by Brian McWherter, the dance is 32 Ct, 2-walls and
heartily recommended.
Tell Me Bout It-Rachael McEnaney-Music is Tell Me Bout  It by Joss Stone and
is 32 Ct, 2-walls. This was also played constantly and  highly recommended.
Creek (Creeque) Alley, taught &amp; written by Steve  Lescarbeau, was recently
taught at our Pt. Pleasant Elks Club of N.J. and it was  great to do it with
Steve right there with us. Great teach, Steve! Music is  Creeque Alley by The
Mamas &amp; The Papas. 80 Cts and 2-walls. All easy  patterns and no syncopations
makes this a great intermediate dance and is  classified as intermediate only
because of the 80 counts otherwise it would be a  high beginner dance, as Steve
explained.
Cha Cha Ruleta -Scott Blevins-Scott  wrote this in 2000 and taught this as
preparation for a dance event in  Carifornia. It's a challenge as most of
Scott's dances are, at least for me.  Those who took the lesson seemed to like it.
Music is Ruleta Rusa by Enrique  Iglesias. 32 Ct,4-Wall
American Thighs-Another Rachael McEnaney winner.  Music is You shook Me all
Night by AC/DC. 64 Ct, 2-Wallls and highly  recommended.
Other dances I took were: Fanilow Eyes to Can't Take My Eyes  Off Of You By
B.Manilow.This is a phrased dance that fits the song perfectly.  (Yes Jackie &amp;
Doug are Barry Manilow Fans-Get It?), an easy beginner dance  called Wake Up
Little Suzie by Diana Dawson 48 Ct, 4-walls &amp; no  syncopations. I also took a
great dance that was revived by Kathy Hunyadi called  Majik Touch by Kathy
Hunyadi &amp; Jamie Marshall hence MaJiK Touch-Get it?  Music is Rub You The Right Way
by Johnny Gill and dates back to 2000. As Kathy  said &quot;It's funky without
being Hip-Hop&quot;) The dance is 64 Cts and 2-walls.
Well that's just about it. So many dances,so little time but just a great
event. Hope you try some of these dances yourself. Enjoy!

SUBJECT: HOTEL ROOMS FOR TAMPA (FLORIDA) LINE DANCE CLASSIC - NOV.  1 - 4,
2007
FROM: ARLINE WINERMAN
There are about 6 rooms  available next to the Double Tree Hotel at the
Sheraton Suites. They can take 5  in a room and have microwave, frig and a heated
indoor pool. Just 100 feet from  the host hotel. The charge is $139 and be sure
to ask for this rate for the  Tampa Bay Line Dance Classic. Or use AAA and go
on line to see what price you  can get in a nearby location. (Cypress St. and
West Shore Dr.) I heard the  Hampton Inn was even cheaper. I have 15 on the
waiting list for a cancellation  for the special price - but we are never sure
how this is going to turn out.  Please call me if you have any concerns or if
there is any way I can help. 727  551-0062. Thanks for your understanding.
Don't forget the theme is the 50's ---  so get out your bobby sox and poodle
skirts (gals !) and guys get that hair cut  that was so cool. See you soon!!!

Subject:  WOW Dance Event in Newark Airport, NJ - Aug 16-19
From: Barbara, NJ
Even better than last year - Judy Chen and family and staff  - THANKS !
The most important thing - the dancefloors were rented and the  BEST ever!
We had three workshop rooms and three difficult choices to make  each hour.
The instructors were ALL superb and Louie kept the party going  and going
and Ellen Kiernan helped out with a second open dancing room on  Sat nite.
We had some additions to last year's lineup - Rachel (who was  fantastic)
and Steve Lescarbeau (who did a late nite teach) the energy level  was up,
up, up!
I was lucky enough to win a pass to the Spring Break in  Myrtle Beach next
April.
The show was &quot;Inside the Toy Store&quot; after hours  hosted by Doug Miranda who
was awesome! All our favorite instructors were  dressed like toys and each
did a little
performance - one was better than  the next --the acrobatics were amazing!
I only hope we can get more dancers  interested in this event so it can be
held
next year. The numbers were  nothing like they should have been with such
a wonderful cast of  instructors. The workshops started on Fri morning til
Sunday at 2 PM. Try to  plan ahead and let Judy Chen know that you
may be interested for next year  and try to support this terrific event!
I have to unpack now - I'm exhausted  but feel terrific! What a fabulous
weekend!

SUBJECT:   AIN'T GOT NO MONEY  CLARIFICATION
FROM:  NEVILLE FITZGERALD
Hiya.

I've had some queries regarding this dance...

'Does it start facing 3.00 Nev??'

'Pardon?' says I.... 'Where do you get that idea?'

'It says so on the step sheet on Linedancer site' was the reply.....  &amp;
indeed it does

Well.... Whoever uploaded it to said resource (not me).... (nor  Julie)
has added their own wee bit at the start that says dance begins  facing
3.00.... Comedian.

It does in fact start like 99.987% of all other dances... facing  the
front.. 12.00

Sorry for any confusion that may have arisen from this..
I'm being  awfully polite today... really must see the doctor

Just  some facts about Epilepsy:
More than two million people in the U.S. have  epilepsy, the third most
common neurological disorder in the country.  Approximately 30 to 40 percent of
people with epilepsy have seizures that cannot  be controlled with medications,
leaving many unable to work or drive.

1 in 10 adults will have a seizure sometime during their life. More than 3
million Americans are treated for epilepsy, most commonly, with anti seizure
medications.
In spite of its prevaence, however, epilepsy remains a condition  often
shrouded in mystery. &quot;Because epilepsy can be a stigmatized condition,  some people
shy away from using the word -- saying instead that they have  seizures or a
seizure disorder. This is in epilepsy, and it is important to help  eliminate
and eradicate myths, fears and stigma, that the correct term --  epilepsy --
be used, &quot; said Eric Hargis, President and CEO of the Epilepsy  Foundation.
