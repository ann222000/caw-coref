&quot;NEW DELHI -- India chose its first female president Saturday in an
election hailed as a victory for women in a country where gender
discrimination is deep-rooted and widespread.

Still, it's not clear how much 72-year-old Pratibha Patil -- a lawyer,
congresswoman and former governor of the northern state of Rajasthan
-- can or will do in the mostly ceremonial post to improve the lives
of her countrywomen.&quot;

Isn't President a fairly ceremonial position in India? Isn't the most
powerful person in India its Prime Minister, like the immortal Indira
Ghandi?

Very good, Lorad.  It appears that this time you have hit the nail
right on the head.

Whe I was a lad I served a term ...  no, that's HMS Pinafore ....

When I was a lad I was interested in the Hare Krishnas, partly because
of their use of Sanskrit.  I used to look at the Vedic hymns in their
magazine (which were in Sanskrit in the proper script, then Sanskrit
transliterated into Latin alphabet, and then English translation) to
see if I could spot Baltic cognates.  They pop up in the most
unexpected places.  For example, I remember one Sanskrit word
'svabhavika', said to mean 'essential' in the etymological sense
('pertaining to essence or being') which given the context and
explanatory notes, I could see was cognate to the Lithuanian elements
'sau' (for self) and 'buti' ('to be').

Here's a more straightforward example for you to ponder..
The Sanksrit word 'Sarasvati':

&quot;The best theory regarding the Vedic Sarasvati River states that it
was formed by the present headwaters of the Yamuna River.&quot;

Relate this word with to the first Common Baltic-Sanskrit root in the
word. (the second common root is obvious).

Nonsense!
Skt. &lt;svabhavika&gt; and &lt;svabhava&gt; (character, inherent nature) could be
Serbian &lt;svebiće&gt; (the complete being), &lt;sve bivanje&gt; all being, but
it also could be Serbian &lt;zabava&gt; entertainment and even &lt;zabavište&gt;
kindergarten!!! All we need for a such &quot;scientific&quot; discourse is a
little bit more imagination. Sanskrit &lt;sva&gt; means 'self'; Serbian
sebe, svoj (self, one own) but if you scrape the surface you will see
that in this case English &lt;self&gt; or German &lt;selb-&gt; are older not only
from Baltic and Slavic sav-, svoj- but even from Sanskrit sva-,
because that words were derived from the basis Sur-Bel (cf. Skt. sarva
all, everything); German selber is a metathesis of srjabl via ON
sjarlf.

If you are inteligent enough you will see correspondence between
selbst, selber and silver; Serbian srebro (silver; in some Slavic
dialects sljebro; from srebljo; Baltic sidabrinis (Lit) or sidrabs in
Latvian).

I know, you are amaized, what silver got to do with our svabhavika?
Yes it's got, not only silver but the whole world (Serbian svet;
Latvian pasaule, Lithuanian pasaulis; Serbian vaseljene: Sanskrit
vishva)

Ask me if you are unable to catch the clue.

Well, according to Wikipedia, the name Sarasvatī is descended from
Proto-Indo-Iranian *saras-vn̥t-iH (virtually PIE *séles-wn̥t-ih2),
meaning &quot;she with many pools&quot;.  Sanskrit saras- means &quot;pool, pond&quot;;
the feminine sarasī́ means &quot;stagnant pool, swamp&quot; (e.g. RV 7.103.2b).
Cognate with Greek ἕλος &quot;swamp&quot;, the Rigvedic term refers mostly to
stagnant waters, and Mayrhofer considers unlikely a connection with
the root sar- &quot;run, flow&quot;.[1]

Are you saying the vati bit means water in Sanskrit?

Well,a susual, there are different versions.  One says:

Silver is a chemical element denoted on the periodic table by the
symbol ‘Ag’. In etymological terms this symbol is derived from the
early Proto-Indo-European language root word ‘Arg'- meaning ‘White’,
or ‘To shine’. This root word is found in ancient:
Greek – Argos.
Latin – Argentums.
Celtic – Argent.
Sanskrit – Arjuna.

The only languages that lacked this root are the Germano-Balto-Slavic
languages that used another stem for Silver thought to be based on a
river in Lycia, modern day Turkey:

Slavic – Sirebro.
Baltic – Silabr.
Germanic – Silbr.

ANother version ( http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=silver )
says:

O.E. seolfor &quot;silver,&quot; from P.Gmc. *silubra- (cf. O.S. silvbar, O.N.
silfr, M.Du. silver, Du. zilver, O.H.G. sillabar, Ger. silber, Goth.
silubr), from a common Germanic/Balto-Slavic term (cf. O.C.S. sirebo,
Rus. serebo, Lith. sidabras &quot;silver&quot;), possibly from a language of
Asia Minor. Perhaps from Akkad. sarpu &quot;silver,&quot; lit. &quot;refined silver,&quot;
related to sarapu &quot;to refine, smelt.&quot; Chemical abbreviation Ag is from
L. argentum &quot;silver,&quot; from the PIE root (see argent). The verb, &quot;to
cover or plate with silver&quot; is recorded from 1440. Silverware is from
1860.

&gt; O.E. seolfor &quot;silver,&quot; from P.Gmc. *silubra- (cf. O.S. silvbar, O.N.
&gt; silfr, M.Du. silver, Du. zilver, O.H.G. sillabar, Ger. silber, Goth.
&gt; silubr), from a common Germanic/Balto-Slavic term (cf. O.C.S. sirebo,
&gt; Rus. serebo, Lith. sidabras &quot;silver&quot;), possibly from a language of
&gt; Asia Minor. Perhaps from Akkad. sarpu &quot;silver,&quot; lit. &quot;refined silver,&quot;
&gt; related to sarapu &quot;to refine, smelt.&quot; Chemical abbreviation Ag is from
&gt; L. argentum &quot;silver,&quot; from the PIE root (see argent). The verb, &quot;to
&gt; cover or plate with silver&quot; is recorded from 1440. Silverware is from
&gt; 1860.- Hide quoted text -

I brought out the Latvian etymology dictionary to look at
&quot;sudrabs&quot; (also sidrabs) which is the Latvian word for silver, and the
entry was over a page long, and much more of a tale than the usual
terse paragraph of roots, similar words and so forth!  Apparently
there are a number of theories about the roots of the word, and
Karulis lists a number of them, all of which was interesting reading,
and much overlapped with what you said, but the conclusion was (quick
translation):

&quot;For now there is no singular theory about the word &quot;sudrabs&quot; and its
related Slavic and Germanic counterparts - perhaps because these words
formed under differening influences, as there was no one route for the
import of silver; therefore, there could have been different
originally borrowed names for silver.&quot;

Then he finishes:

&quot;The old southern and easter ide peoples also had a different name for
silver, which had at its root the ide. arg- &quot;shining, glittering,
bright&quot; (thus silver was named &quot;the bright metal&quot; as opposed to gold,
&quot;the yellow metal&quot;).  (a-Then followed examples)  The word &quot;mirdzet&quot;
is related to these names for silver.&quot;

(Mirdzet means to glitter or glisten)

Interesting, thanks! :-)  Talking about learning things, I am doing a
translation about Klaipeda Harbour and is it every interesting.  In
the part about the fluid dynamics of the Harbour, there are a couple
of words which I though at first might be untranslatable.  But the
first one, 'seiša', borrowed from French 'seiche', is still used in
English as 'seiche'.    The other one, 'trauklys', has a name in
Japanese (!), but in English I had to settle for 'harbour
oscillation'.

Great thing about translation, like reading, &quot;it broadens one&quot;  :-)

&gt; &gt; &gt; Very good, Lorad.  It appears that this time you have hit the nail
&gt; &gt; &gt; right on the head.

&gt; &gt; Not just &quot;this&quot; time... most times.

&gt; &gt; &gt;..I remember one Sanskrit word
&gt; &gt; &gt; 'svabhavika', said to mean 'essential' in the etymological sense
&gt; &gt; &gt; ('pertaining to essence or being') which given the context and
&gt; &gt; &gt; explanatory notes, I could see was cognate to the Lithuanian elements
&gt; &gt; &gt; 'sau' (for self) and 'buti' ('to be').

&gt; &gt; Here's a more straightforward example for you to ponder..
&gt; &gt; The Sanksrit word 'Sarasvati':

&gt; &gt; &quot;The best theory regarding the Vedic Sarasvati River states that it
&gt; &gt; was formed by the present headwaters of the Yamuna River.&quot;

&gt; &gt; Relate this word with to the first Common Baltic-Sanskrit root in the
&gt; &gt; word. (the second common root is obvious).

&gt; Nonsense!
&gt; Skt. &lt;svabhavika&gt; and &lt;svabhava&gt; (character, inherent nature) could be
&gt; Serbian &lt;svebiće&gt; (the complete being),

Well, if facts cannot be reconciled with your Sur-Bel thingy, I would

English cannot predate Sanskrit.. unless you have a time machine.
You hypothesis has failed.

You are forgetting another basic fact:
The fact that all Slavic languages are derived from a Baltic parent
language.

If Serbian has retained vocabulary lost elsewhere within IE, it is
notable.. but only in a derivative sense.
The above fact probably makes your Sur-Bel-Gon thingy quite a
localized phenomenon (this without even delving into its rationality)

As you can see Serbian Va-se-ljena (unlike Baltic reduced form
Pasaule) already contains your 'loka'; loka means people, world, publc
in Sanskrit and I do not see what it got to do with Baltic lauk-
(lauke = abroad, laukinis = agrarian, laukti = anticipate, laukti =
await, laukti = bargain, laukas = field, laukti = hold, laukti = hope,
laukinis = jungle, laukinis = natural, lauk = out, laukas = plot,
lauktuvės = present, lauke = rough, laukinis = savage, laukymė = spot,
laukymė = star, laukininkas = tiller, laukti = watch, lauke =
without).

It seems, there is nothing in the world what Lithuanian lauk- could
not mean.

Latin loco (place, put, set) sounds more logical as well as Serbian
loga (place where animal or man was lying in, lair), because those
words are connected to the verb place (Serbian položiti; I hope, you
are able to see that Serbian položaj /position, lokation/ is equal to
the English noun place).

Lorad means well but he gets his facts confused.What he is trying to
say that the two Baltic languages, especially Lithuanian,  are the
most linguistically conservative languages still spoken in Europe
today, i.e. the least changed from Indo-European.  There is tonnes of
stuff on Google to confirm this.  Unfortunately, the layperson's
shorthand for saying this is that Lithuanian &amp; Latvian are the
&quot;oldest&quot; languages in Europe.  This is where lorad and many others get
confused.  The phrase &quot;oldest language&quot; has no scientific meaning.  In
one sense, Finnish and Estonian (not IE languages, of course) are
&quot;older&quot;, because they have been in their place longer.

I just do not understand why someone is fleeing away from a
discussion, which he started in the first place. Lorad seems to be
trying to preserve (and protect!) his illusion and he seems to be
afraid that some day his &quot;sweet dreams&quot; could be shattered. I would
say he prefers dreams to reality.

Talking about the age of languages is a complete nonsense, at least in
this moment when we have no arguments at all to substantiate any
possible assumption concerning the tongue &quot;ontogenesis&quot;. As I
understood, lorad is an amateur and it gives him the right for more
frivolity and more imaginative creativity.

On the other side, there are certain &quot;established scientist&quot; who are
pursuing &quot;language separation from the IE tree&quot;. In fact, they are
repeating the same immature national enthusiasm of lorad's type.

Yes, Lorad is an amateur and he loves his native Latvian language very
much, but strangely he thinks that the best way to boost the image of
his native language is to claim that it is the &quot;mother of all
languages&quot;, practically the same thing as Proto-Indoeuropean.  I'm not
sure what he thinks about PIE, but he appears to think that at least
proto-Baltic is the direct successor of PIE.  Well, in one sense it
is, but so then is every IE language spoken.

Let's face it, in the absence of hard data (e.g. texts or sound
recordings), the exact nature of PIE is going to remain largely a
mystery.  We can make some eductaed guesses about general principles,
but we will never be able to fill in all the details.

I personally prefer to look at the etymologies of words and to marvel
and the circuitous paths of evolution of many of the words we use
today – in many languages.

For example, I found out recently that 'kicsi' means small in
Hungarian: obviously the source of German 'kitsch', with the same
deprecatory overtones that surround the meaning given to the word
'petty' in English when it was borrowed from the French 'petit'.
