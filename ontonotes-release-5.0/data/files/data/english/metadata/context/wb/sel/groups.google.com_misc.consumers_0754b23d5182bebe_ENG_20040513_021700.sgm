&gt; US spies 'urged abuse' of prisoners
&gt; BY Roy Eccleston, Washington correspondent, and John Kerin
&gt; May 03, 2004

&gt; THE scandal over the US military's abuse of Iraqi prisoners
&gt; at a notorious Baghdad prison is deepening, with new claims
&gt; the possible war crimes were encouraged by American intelligence
&gt; officers wanting inmates &quot;softened up&quot; for interrogation.

&gt; http://tinyurl.com/29w34
&gt; A BRITISH captive freed from Guantanamo Bay today tells the
&gt; world of its full horror - and reveals how prostitutes were
&gt; taken into the camp to degrade Muslim inmates. (...) He said
&gt; detainees were shackled for up to 15 hours at a time in hand
&gt; and leg cuffs with metal links which cut into the skin.
&gt; Their &quot;cells&quot; were wire cages with concrete floors and
&gt; open to the elements - giving no privacy or protection from
&gt; the rats, snakes and scorpions loose around the American base.
&gt; He claims punishment beatings were handed out by guards
&gt; known as the Extreme Reaction Force. They waded into inmates
&gt; in full riot-gear, raining blows on them. Prisoners faced
&gt; psychological torture and mind-games in attempts to make them
&gt; confess to acts they had never committed. Even petty breaches
&gt; of rules brought severe punishment. Medical treatment was
&gt; sparse and brutal and amputations of limbs were more drastic
&gt; than required, claimed Jamal. A diet of foul water and food
&gt; up to 10 years out-of-date left inmates malnourished.
&gt; But Jamal's most shocking disclosure centred on the
&gt; use of vice girls to torment the most religiously
&gt; devout detainees. ...

Al Qaeda supporter &quot;probably&quot; beheaded American - May 13 2004
http://tinyurl.com/2dvhu

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Al Qaeda supporter Abu Musab al-Zarqawi
probably was the one who beheaded American Nick Berg on a video
shown this week on an Islamist Web site, a U.S. official says.

U.S. intelligence agencies have been analysing the video that
has poor audio quality, and while the technical analysis was
not complete, it was &quot;quite probably&quot; Zarqawi who wielded the
knife, the official told Reuters on Thursday.

The intelligence analysis so far is leaning toward &quot;Zarqawi
personally is the voice heard on the tape and that the person
whose voice is on the tape is also the person who wields the
knife,&quot; the official said on condition of anonymity.

A Web site video on Tuesday showed five masked men standing
behind Berg. One of them read a statement urging Muslims to
seek revenge for Iraqi prisoners abused by U.S. soldiers at
Abu Ghraib prison near Baghdad.

The masked men then pushed Berg to the floor and one of them
sawed the American's head off with a large knife and held
the head up for the camera.

What a horrible thing for the family to know exists. I saw Nick Berg's
father on television and am moved to send a financial donation to the
family. It won't bring their son back, but the entire family is going to
need counseling and healing to cope with this event.

Years ago there were other videos online that showed similar treatment of
their own people. Except the victim was wrapped and tied tightly in a
sleeping bag type body bag, while his throat was slit open allowing the life
blood to gush in a violent stream. The scene showed a line of 'observers'
casually watching the chest of the body exaggeratedly rise and fall while
gasping for air through the visible large opening.

How should this type of behavior be stopped?
Capture them, feed them tranquilizers or natural relaxers?

It doesn't matter if it is a military action the U.S. is involved in or not.
That uncivilized behavior goes on. How can random bands of savages be
eradicated?
When a young couple who worked in the same location as I did at Intel in
1999 went to Africa  http://www.ugandamission.org/news/Bwindi.htm  there was
no U.S. military action going on. Yet they were beheaded in that country,
much to the horror of their family, co-workers and community. Here is an
excerpt from a book written by their guide about the last days of their
lives.  http://www.booksense.com/readup/excerpts/dangerousbeauty.jsp

I guess the U.S. could back out of the mid east and let things go back the
way they were.
But we'd have score of people wanting to get away and be accepted into this
country.....a country that is becoming overrun with oppressed immigrants
already. We can't bring all the oppressed HERE.

Instead of mocking our President as the focus of this thread, it would be
productive to engage in problem solving solutions that may result in a
win-win-win situation.

Here is a thought not mentioned anywhere, so far...

Daniel Pearl was Jewish and beheaded.

Nick Berg was Jewish and beheaded.

A trend?

&gt;&gt; http://tinyurl.com/2dvhu

&gt;&gt; WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Al Qaeda supporter Abu Musab al-Zarqawi
&gt;&gt; probably was the one who beheaded American Nick Berg on a video
&gt;&gt; shown this week on an Islamist Web site, a U.S. official says.

&gt;&gt; U.S. intelligence agencies have been analysing the video that
&gt;&gt; has poor audio quality, and while the technical analysis was
&gt;&gt; not complete, it was &quot;quite probably&quot; Zarqawi who wielded the
&gt;&gt; knife, the official told Reuters on Thursday.

&gt;&gt; The intelligence analysis so far is leaning toward &quot;Zarqawi
&gt;&gt; personally is the voice heard on the tape and that the person
&gt;&gt; whose voice is on the tape is also the person who wields the
&gt;&gt; knife,&quot; the official said on condition of anonymity.

&gt;&gt; A Web site video on Tuesday showed five masked men standing
&gt;&gt; behind Berg. One of them read a statement urging Muslims to
&gt;&gt; seek revenge for Iraqi prisoners abused by U.S. soldiers at
&gt;&gt; Abu Ghraib prison near Baghdad.

&gt;&gt; The masked men then pushed Berg to the floor and one of them
&gt;&gt; sawed the American's head off with a large knife and held
&gt;&gt; the head up for the camera.

They said on that video that they tried to exchange the
guy against prisoner and the USA refused. I agree that
was horrible but that is their way of getting the
attention to the horrible thing POW were getting from
Americans.

Americans army men killed 5000 thousands afghans cause
there was no place anymore in prison. They placed them
in big containers and when people began to yell cause
there was no air, they fired the container with
machine gun to make some holes. Half the prisoners
were killed. The blood was pouring down all the road.
The people who survived were 5 days in it under big
sun. They had to drink the blood from the dead people.
When they arrived, they got all killed and got buried
by bulldozers. They showed the big fields with bones
everywhere.

Nothing to be proud of being Americans. They don't
show that on your TV.

In Rwanda, Americans left the country even if they knew
what was going on. One million people were killed after
that. One Canadian general went into depression cause
he had friends there who were getting killed every day.

In your movie Black Hawk Down, we see heroes in Somalia.
The fact is that after a few deaths that we saw in the
movie, the American army left the country and there
was a big genocide there too.

Your government is full of shit. They only get involved
when they are risking to lose money. They don't defend
democracy at all. I hope that you won't vote to that
Bush Shit anymore. They control the media too.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Al Qaeda supporter &quot;probably&quot; beheaded American - May 13 2004
&gt;&gt;&gt;http://tinyurl.com/2dvhu

&gt;&gt;&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Al Qaeda supporter Abu Musab al-Zarqawi
&gt;&gt;&gt;probably was the one who beheaded American Nick Berg on a video
&gt;&gt;&gt;shown this week on an Islamist Web site, a U.S. official says.

&gt;&gt;&gt;U.S. intelligence agencies have been analysing the video that
&gt;&gt;&gt;has poor audio quality, and while the technical analysis was
&gt;&gt;&gt;not complete, it was &quot;quite probably&quot; Zarqawi who wielded the
&gt;&gt;&gt;knife, the official told Reuters on Thursday.

&gt;&gt;&gt;The intelligence analysis so far is leaning toward &quot;Zarqawi
&gt;&gt;&gt;personally is the voice heard on the tape and that the person
&gt;&gt;&gt;whose voice is on the tape is also the person who wields the
&gt;&gt;&gt;knife,&quot; the official said on condition of anonymity.

&gt;&gt;&gt;A Web site video on Tuesday showed five masked men standing
&gt;&gt;&gt;behind Berg. One of them read a statement urging Muslims to
&gt;&gt;&gt;seek revenge for Iraqi prisoners abused by U.S. soldiers at
&gt;&gt;&gt;Abu Ghraib prison near Baghdad.

&gt;&gt;&gt;The masked men then pushed Berg to the floor and one of them
&gt;&gt;&gt;sawed the American's head off with a large knife and held
&gt;&gt;&gt;the head up for the camera.

Apology/Forgiveness
Days of Atonement
http://www.science-spirit.org/

The history of forgiveness is a story
of rituals and bargains. In the ancient
world, the pattern was simple: Humans
erred, repented, and sacrificed; the
gods forgave wrongs. Somewhere along
the line, however, we started
expecting mercy not only from the
divine, but also from each other.

by Paul O'Donnell

The Dalai Lama's &quot;Words of Wisdom&quot; calendar for January 26 of
this year read: &quot;Forgiveness does not mean just to forget about
what happened. You should use memory and experience to develop
positive energy.&quot;

This bit of advice from the leader of Tibetan Buddhism frames
forgiveness as not only the right thing to do, but also as a
virtue that gives back to the forgiver the benefits of
positive energy. It seems like a plum the Tibetan Buddhist
leader would pluck ripe from his 2,400-year-old tradition,
making Western ideas about forgiveness as a divine command
seem overwrought and self-defeating.

But forgiveness, either in the sense of forgetting what
happened or of developing positive energy, doesn't have
much of a history at all in Buddhism. As a religious concept,
forgiveness appears to be a Christian innovation, born not of
any regard for psychological hygiene, but of millennia of
sacrifice to a jealous Yahweh and the conquering influence
of Greek thought. In its original conception in the Christian
gospels, forgiveness seems to have simply meant forgetting
about what happened; the kind of forgiveness the Dalai Lama
recommends is an entirely modern construct.

For many centuries before Jesus' birth, forgiveness in the
West was something bought, wholesale, from the divine.
In agrarian communities--from Turkey to Mesopotamia and
down through Egypt--society depended on rain and calm,
warm weather for growing crops and peaceful relations with
neighbors to harvest them. When faced with storms,
earthquakes, or invading armies, it was thought that the
gods were angry at the way locals had been running their
lives. Repentance was signified by sacrifice of livestock
or crops, and the gods, it was understood, forgave the wrong.

This relationship, however, was tenuous. Looking to secure
the gods' constant forgiveness, the ancient West
institutionalized sacrifice, dedicating priests who made
their living receiving tribute for the deities.
The gods &quot;would fly into a rage if it so much as looked
as if you were going to step on a rule,&quot; says Gregory Riley,
who teaches history of religion at the Claremont School of
Theology in California. &quot;The priests were essentially
feeding the gods what they needed.&quot; Personal forgiveness
goes all but unmentioned in the ancient world.

Yet what we mean today by &quot;forgiveness&quot;--an emotional
transaction between two humans--has its roots in this
sacrificial bargain. Judaism was one of these temple
cults and, as in other Middle Eastern sects, forgiveness
belonged to God. &quot;Sacrifice a bull each day as a sin
offering to make atonement,&quot; the Lord commands the
priestly Aaron and his sons in Exodus. Subsequent books
in the Torah codify precisely how and where to perform
the rites and what could be expected if the contract
wasn't honored: &quot;The fruit of your womb will be cursed,
and the crops of your land, and the calves of your herds
and the lambs of your flocks,&quot; warns Deuteronomy 28.
&quot;You will be cursed when you come in and cursed when
you go out.&quot;

Such a legalistic arrangement between God and man bred a
similar code among humans: Lex Talionis, or the law of
retaliation, a belief reflected in the Old Testament.
Properly understood, &quot;An eye for an eye&quot; is not a
barbarian standard of justice but a matter of piety.
The Jews, in fact, weren't alone in thinking this.
The Greeks, whose Zeus was a fiercely jealous god, shared
Judaism's strict insistence on equity.

As they slowly left behind their belief in demanding gods
and vindictive Furies, the Greeks were well disposed to
discover forgiveness for themselves, and they nearly did.
Stoicism, a school of philosophy born some 300 years before
Christ, believed wisdom lay in the imperturbable mind;
anger and resentment only blocked personal growth. In the
Nicomachean Ethics, Aristotle comes close to our notion of
equity and mercy, &quot;but nothing like the Judeo-Christian
forgiveness,&quot; says Arizona State University philosophy
professor Jeffrie G. Murphy, author of Getting Even:
Forgiveness and Its Limits.

As Judaism continued to refine monotheism--with some help,
perhaps, from Aristotle's ideas about a unitary,
self-sufficient divinity that had spread eastward--the
conditions for a broader forgiveness came together. Even as
the High Priests were conducting sacrifices morning and
evening in the Jerusalem temple, God was increasingly seen
as residing above all the blood and smoke. Jesus saw that
a God who didn't need feeding to grant his forgiveness might
be approached directly. &quot;Jesus looks up and says, ‘Look at
me, God, I'm a sinner,'&quot; says Riley. From his reading of
the Dead Sea Scrolls, Riley believes it's possible the
Gnostics may have already reached the same point in their
relationship with God. But it is Jesus we first see appealing
directly to the God of the Old Testament as a father,
expecting forgiveness to be given freely.

The dynamic of forgiveness was profoundly changed: Atonement's
strict line between heaven and Earth was turned into a triangle,
or rather a web connecting all of us to God. If humans were to
seek forgiveness individually from the Father, it was obvious
that we would be expected to forgive one another. In the parable
of the 10,000 talents, Jesus shows how this gambit works.
Those who are forgiven, as the servant in Matthew 18 is freed
from his debts, are to forgive others. When the forgiven servant
doesn't forgive his fellow a much lesser amount, the parable says
he is &quot;turned over to the jailers to be tortured.&quot;

It's little wonder the priestly Jewish establishment, who owed
its power to a grasp on the sacrifice industry, so to speak,
reacted badly to Jesus' democratization of forgiveness. In his
teaching, the price of forgiveness becomes not a lamb or bird
for sacrifice, but extending forgiveness to others. Failure to
do so results not in suffering for the whole community, but in
no forgiveness for you.

It's little wonder, too, that other major religions, like
Buddhism or Hinduism, have such different notions of
interpersonal forgiveness, since sacrifice is either absent
or understood very differently. Far from asking God's
forgiveness, Hindus are charged with forgiving the deity for
so blithely bringing suffering. In his book, The Hungry God,
Sanskrit scholar David Dean Shulman examines a mythical Hindu
family's struggle to forgive Siva after he visits their house
and demands their child be killed for his dinner. As a response
to such random acts of destruction, Hinduism seeks an emotional
purity not unlike the Stoics' ideal. &quot;Emotions are like a lake
in which you can only see the self, the atman, clearly when
the water is still,&quot; offers University of Chicago divinity
professor Wendy Doniger.

Similarly, Buddhism holds that we are all responsible for
our own fate, good and bad, through the concept of karma.
&quot;If there is no idea of sin,&quot; Buddhist historian Donald
Lopez points out, &quot;there is nothing to be forgiven.&quot;
The Dalai Lama's claim for the vaguely therapeutic properties
of forgiveness grows from the late nineteenth century, when
Asians of various faiths countered the scientific rationalism
of colonizing Europeans by stressing the physical benefits of
their native religions, a bent that works out today in yoga's
near total detachment from Hinduism.

What was the character of Jesus' forgiveness then?
Was it a Stoic's neutral letting go of hurt, or did he
require repentance? While Jesus urged his followers never
to withhold forgiveness--forgive &quot;seventy times seven
times,&quot; he tells Peter--Murphy at Arizona State cites
Luke 17:3 (&quot;If your brother sins, rebuke him, and if he
repents, forgive him&quot;) to argue that Christ never meant
us to forgive without repentance. &quot;Forgiving people without
repentance risks compromising yourself,&quot; he says.

Modern Judaism has come to the same conclusion.
&quot;The Talmud offers an extraordinary reward and great
encouragement for forgiving others,&quot; writes Joseph
Telushkin, a rabbi and ethicist, in a forthcoming book,
pointing out that forgiveness is sometimes even obligatory.
For some crimes, like slander, forgiveness is optional.
And sometimes, he says, forgiveness is forbidden--most of
all when the forgiver has not suffered personally.
Forgiving Timothy McVeigh, as one pastor did in a photo
op with President Clinton in 1997, strikes Telushkin as
taking Christian forgiveness too far. For both Murphy and
Telushkin, forgiveness has its limits, and they caution
everyone from self-help authors to truth-and-reconciliation
committees to administer it carefully.

In the conversational Greek of the New Testament, Jesus'
word is aphiemi, translated into Latin in the Vulgate as
dimitto--the root of our word &quot;dismiss.&quot;

&quot;It's sort of like our saying, ‘Hey, man, fuhgetaboutit,
or, ‘Let it go, pal,'&quot; says Howard Clarke, a classics
professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara
and author of the recently published The Gospel of Matthew
and Its Readers. Later Christians, Clarke says, might have
&quot;sacramentalized&quot; the word to give it a deeper sense of
emotional exertion, bound up in St. Paul's insistence on
the overwhelming power of love.

As the Dalai Lama's quote shows, it's this sacramentalized
conception that we mean when we today say &quot;forgiveness,&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Al Qaeda supporter &quot;probably&quot; beheaded American - May 13 2004
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;http://tinyurl.com/2dvhu

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Al Qaeda supporter Abu Musab al-Zarqawi
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;probably was the one who beheaded American Nick Berg on a video
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;shown this week on an Islamist Web site, a U.S. official says.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;U.S. intelligence agencies have been analysing the video that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;has poor audio quality, and while the technical analysis was
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;not complete, it was &quot;quite probably&quot; Zarqawi who wielded the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;knife, the official told Reuters on Thursday.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The intelligence analysis so far is leaning toward &quot;Zarqawi
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;personally is the voice heard on the tape and that the person
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;whose voice is on the tape is also the person who wields the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;knife,&quot; the official said on condition of anonymity.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;A Web site video on Tuesday showed five masked men standing
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;behind Berg. One of them read a statement urging Muslims to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;seek revenge for Iraqi prisoners abused by U.S. soldiers at
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Abu Ghraib prison near Baghdad.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The masked men then pushed Berg to the floor and one of them
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;sawed the American's head off with a large knife and held
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the head up for the camera.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Al Qaeda supporter &quot;probably&quot; beheaded American - May 13 2004
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;http://tinyurl.com/2dvhu

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Al Qaeda supporter Abu Musab al-Zarqawi
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;probably was the one who beheaded American Nick Berg on a video
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;shown this week on an Islamist Web site, a U.S. official says.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;U.S. intelligence agencies have been analysing the video that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;has poor audio quality, and while the technical analysis was
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;not complete, it was &quot;quite probably&quot; Zarqawi who wielded the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;knife, the official told Reuters on Thursday.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The intelligence analysis so far is leaning toward &quot;Zarqawi
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;personally is the voice heard on the tape and that the person
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;whose voice is on the tape is also the person who wields the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;knife,&quot; the official said on condition of anonymity.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;A Web site video on Tuesday showed five masked men standing
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;behind Berg. One of them read a statement urging Muslims to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;seek revenge for Iraqi prisoners abused by U.S. soldiers at
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Abu Ghraib prison near Baghdad.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The masked men then pushed Berg to the floor and one of them
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;sawed the American's head off with a large knife and held
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the head up for the camera.

"/> I rewatched the video just now. (If you don't want to read descriptions of
it, please don't read further.)

It shows 5 terrorist standing behind Nick. The two on the right appear to
be looking at a piece of paper. The two on the left appear more attentive
to Nick who is on the floor. Then he is yanked to his side by the man in
the middle, as one man on the left (the only one with a white headcover)
removes his rifle and puts it on the floor, then puts his hands on the area
above Nicks elbows.

Other man goes to Nick's feet, but not visible after that. What appears to
be struggling could be from pushing and pulling of the body. I noted that
there was not any blood spurting. The hands remained strongly around Nick's
arms even after the movement stopped. The completion of the job is done and
in one smooth move the man with the white headcover stands up with the knife
in one hand and Nick's head in the other. It would lead one to think the
video was staged.

"/> There is no question that they murdered a non-combatant prisoner, whether it
was as the video depicted, or before then. Thus, they demonstrated the same
despicable behavior that was shown when the Arab murderers beheaded Daniel
Pearl.

Assuming that Berg was dead, there is no question that they wanted to
portray themselves as blood thirsty animals. I will gladly oblige them and
acknowledge that they are. They consistently demonstrate it.

Continuing the assumption that he was dead, they mutilated the body of of a
dead Jew, which is a a sacrilege. I would be more upset with it if I did not
expect this from them. They are purging the Zone of Islam of infidels, and
Jews are more of an infidel than others (Christians are next).

you guys can't even keep from killing allied soldiers and even American
soldiers. And in all honestly, they don't really avoid killing non-

armed forces don't put a very high cost on killing poor people in countries
they don't like. Hence, even at quite high risks of them dying, missiles

It feels like things are right back the way they started, except
Sadam Hussein is not in power. The people of Iraqi who were
oppressed don't seem to be standing up for themselves to
ward off this new religious leader who is trying to take over.

At least I'm not seeing enough reports of the Iraqi people
joining us, organizing and fighting them off. I hear that they
are being threatened with death if they help the Americans
(chop, chop....this could happen to you stuff on television).

If they want a better life for themselves and future generations
I guess I expect them to hang their ass on the line for
democracy just as much (if not more) as the Americans are.

LOS ANGELES, July 11 (IslamOnline &amp; News Agencies) - The U.S. detention
of prisoners from the Afghan conflict at a military outpost in Cuba is
“un-American,” human rights advocates said Wednesday, July 10, as they
sought to revive a legal challenge to the practice.

The claim came six months after the first shackled detainees from the
U.S. war in Afghanistan were flown to the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo
Bay in Cuba where 534 men from 39 countries are now being held in a
state of legal limbo.

Rights advocates opposing the legality and of the detentions on behalf
of some of the prisoners, who have been denied access to legal counsel,
asked an appeals court to overturn an earlier judgment that threw out
their case, Agence France-Presse (AFP) reported.

“Our laws prohibit holding them the way we’re holding them,” said
Stephen Yagman, the attorney for the group of clergy, lawyers and
journalists challenging the detentions. “It’s a paradox, un-American,”
he added.

VERY IMPORTANT:
http://www.scoop.co.nz/mason/stories/HL0305/S00151.htm
There is even an realaudio clip.
It tells the story of thousands of prisoners who surrendered to the US
military’s Afghan allies after the siege of Kunduz. According to
eyewitnesses, some three thousand of the prisoners were forced into
sealed containers and loaded onto trucks for transport to Sheberghan
prison. Eyewitnesses say when the prisoners began shouting for air,
U.S.-allied Afghan soldiers fired directly into the truck, killing many
of them. The rest suffered through an appalling road trip lasting up to
four days, so thirsty they clawed at the skin of their fellow prisoners
as they licked perspiration and even drank blood from open wounds.

Witnesses say that when the trucks arrived and soldiers opened the
containers, most of the people inside were dead. They also say US
Special Forces re-directed the containers carrying the living and dead
into the desert and stood by as survivors were shot and buried. Now, up
to three thousand bodies lie buried in a mass grave.

Here is a report on what happenned from Americans :
US chose to ignore Rwandan genocide
Classified papers show Clinton was aware of 'final solution'
to eliminate Tutsis
Rory Carroll in Johannesburg
Wednesday March 31, 2004
The Guardian
President Bill Clinton's administration knew Rwanda was
being engulfed by genocide in April 1994 but buried the
information to justify its inaction, according to
classified documents made available for the first time.
Senior officials privately used the word genocide within
16 days of the start of the killings, but chose not to do
so publicly because the president had already decided not
to intervene. Intelligence reports obtained using the US
Freedom of Information Act show the cabinet and almost
certainly the president had been told of a planned
&quot;final solution to eliminate all Tutsis&quot; before the
slaughter reached its peak. It took Hutu death squads
three months from April 6 to murder an estimated 800,000
Tutsis and moderate Hutus and at each stage accurate,

detailed reports were reaching Washington's top policymakers.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;In Rwanda, Americans left the country even if they knew
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;what was going on. One million people were killed after
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;that. One Canadian general went into depression cause
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;he had friends there who were getting killed every day.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Rwanda was not our business.
&gt;&gt;&gt;The solution was better left to African
&gt;&gt;&gt;countries.

Instead of getting all heated up about it, why don't you sit down and ask
yourself WHY people hate, not the USA as a whole, not the people or the
land, but the present administration..
If you answer the question honestly you will come to the conclusion it is
because
1] They rip up international laws and treaties when it suits them,
2] They lie and decieve even those who are supposedly their friends
3] They refuse to agree to comporomise, and do as they wish based on
their strength.
4] They ally themselves with despicable regimes and prevent freedom
movements according to US $$ interests, while pretending that they are the
great protector of human rights. For example they get rid of Saddam, yet
back the Saudi Royal family, which has an eqally bad, if not worse human
rights record as Iraq. Now in Iraq they commit the same abuses Saddam
committed.
5] They start the first war of aggression onvolving a major power since
1945
6] They promise military violence against anyone who disagrees

If you moved into a house and had a neighbour who after some time ripped
up all the community agreements that didn't suit him, Lied to those he
called his freinds, refused any attempt at compromise, as well as making
friends with all the bullies and bad guys in your neighbourhood, then
started a neighbourhood gang fight, and told everyone that they were &quot;Either
with us or against us&quot;...............Don't you think you would start to hate
your neighbour.

You Yanks are so worried about people *liking* you, yet you carry on in
such a despicable manner...............Well, all I can say if you wanna do

&gt; ward off this new religious leader who is trying to take over.

&gt; At least I'm not seeing enough reports of the Iraqi people

&gt; are being threatened with death if they help the Americans
&gt; (chop, chop....this could happen to you stuff on television).

&gt; If they want a better life for themselves and future generations
&gt; I guess I expect them to hang their ass on the line for

Come on. The US already made the big mistake in Iraq when it said that no
Ba'ath party members could be part of the new administration, when being a
Ba'ath party member was the only way to a half decent life in Saddam's Iraq.
For someone to be of the educated class and not join the Ba'ath party they
may as well have just cut their throat and saved Saddam the job.

'US soldiers started to shoot us, one by one'

Survivors describe wedding massacre as generals refuse to apologise

Rory McCarthy in Ramadi
Friday May 21, 2004

The Guardian

The wedding feast was finished and the women had just led the young
bride and groom away to their marriage tent for the night when
Haleema Shihab heard the first sounds of the fighter jets screeching
through the sky above.

It was 10.30pm in the remote village of Mukaradeeb by the Syrian
border and the guests hurried back to their homes as the party ended.
As sister-in-law of the groom, Mrs Shihab, 30, was to sleep with her
husband and children in the house of the wedding party, the Rakat
family villa. She was one of the few in the house who survived
the night.

&quot;The bombing started at 3am,&quot; she said yesterday from her bed in
the emergency ward at Ramadi general hospital, 60 miles west of
Baghdad. &quot;We went out of the house and the American soldiers
started to shoot us. They were shooting low on the ground and
targeting us one by one,&quot; she said. She ran with her youngest
child in her arms and her two young boys, Ali and Hamza, close
behind. As she crossed the fields a shell exploded close to her,
fracturing her legs and knocking her to the ground.

She lay there and a second round hit her on the right arm.
By then her two boys lay dead. &quot;I left them because they
were dead,&quot; she said. One, she saw, had been decapitated
by a shell.

&quot;I fell into the mud and an American soldier came and kicked me.
I pretended to be dead so he wouldn't kill me. My youngest child
was alive next to me.&quot;

Mrs Shibab's description, backed by other witnesses, of an attack
on a sleeping village is at odds with the American claim that they
came under fire while targeting a suspected foreign fighter
safe house.

She described how in the hours before dawn she watched as
American troops destroyed the Rakat villa and the house next
door, reducing the buildings to rubble.

Another relative carried Mrs Shihab and her surviving child to
hospital. There she was told her husband Mohammed, the eldest
of the Rakat sons, had also died.

As Mrs Shihab spoke she gestured with hands still daubed
red-brown with the henna the women had used to decorate
themselves for the wedding. Alongside her in the ward
yesterday were three badly injured girls from the Rakat
family: Khalood Mohammed, aged just a year and struggling
for breath, Moaza Rakat, 12, and Iqbal Rakat, 15, whose
right foot doctors had already amputated.

By the time the sun rose on Wednesday over the Rakat family
house, the raid had claimed 42 lives, according to Hamdi
Noor al-Alusi, manager of the al-Qaim general hospital, the
nearest to the village.

Among the dead were 27 members of the extended Rakat family,
their wedding guests and even the band of musicians hired to
play at the ceremony, among them Hussein al-Ali from Ramadi,
one of the most popular singers in western Iraq.

Dr Alusi said 11 of the dead were women and 14 were children.
&quot;I want to know why the Americans targeted this small village,&quot;
he said by telephone. &quot;These people are my patients. I know
each one of them. What has caused this disaster?&quot;

Despite the compelling testimony of Mrs Shihab, Dr Alusi and
other wedding guests, the US military, faced with apparent
evidence of yet another scandal in Iraq, offered an
inexplicably different account of the operation.

The military admitted there had been a raid on the village
at 3am on Wednesday but said it had targeted a &quot;suspected
foreign fighter safe house&quot;.

&quot;During the operation, coalition forces came under hostile fire
and close air support was provided,&quot; it said in a statement.
Soldiers at the scene then recovered weapons, Iraqi dinar and
Syrian pounds (worth approximately £800), foreign passports and
a &quot;Satcom radio&quot;, presumably a satellite telephone.

&quot;We took ground fire and we returned fire,&quot; said Brigadier
General Mark Kimmitt, deputy director of operations for the
US military in Iraq. &quot;We estimate that around 40 were killed.
But we operated within our rules of engagement.&quot;

Major General James Mattis, commander of the 1st Marine
Division, was scathing of those who suggested a wedding
party had been hit. &quot;How many people go to the middle of
the desert ... to hold a wedding 80 miles (130km) from the
nearest civilisation? These were more than two dozen
military-age males. Let's not be naive.&quot;

When reporters asked him about footage on Arabic television
of a child's body being lowered into a grave, he replied:
&quot;I have not seen the pictures but bad things happen in wars.
I don't have to apologise for the conduct of my men.&quot;

The celebration at Mukaradeeb was to be one of the biggest
events of the year for a small village of just 25 houses.
Haji Rakat, the father, had finally arranged a long-negotiated
tribal union that would bring together two halves of one
large extended family, the Rakats and the Sabahs.

Haji Rakat's second son, Ashad, would marry Rutba, a cousin
from the Sabahs. In a second ceremony one of Ashad's female
cousins, Sharifa, would marry a young Sabah boy, Munawar.

A large canvas awning had been set up in the garden of the
Rakat villa to host the party. A band of musicians was called
in, led by Hamid Abdullah, who runs the Music of Arts
recording studio in Ramadi, the nearest major town.

He brought his friend Hussein al-Ali, a popular Iraqi singer
who performs on Ramadi's own television channel. A handful
of other musicians including the singer's brother Mohaned,
played the drums and the keyboards.

The ceremonies began on Tuesday morning and stretched through
until the late evening. &quot;We were happy because of the wedding.
People were dancing and making speeches,&quot; said Ma'athi Nawaf, 55,
one of the neighbours.

Late in the evening the guests heard the sound of jets
overhead. Then in the distance they saw the headlights
of what appeared to be a military convoy heading their
way across the desert.

The party ended at around 10.30pm and the neighbours left
for their homes. At 3am the bombing began. &quot;The first thing
they bombed was the tent for the ceremony,&quot; said Mr Nawaf.
&quot;We saw the family running out of the house. The bombs were
falling, destroying the whole area.&quot;

Armoured military vehicles then drove into the village,
firing machine guns and supported by attack helicopters.
&quot;They started to shoot at the house and the people outside
the house,&quot; he said.

Before dawn two large Chinook helicopters descended and
offloaded dozens of troops. They appeared to set explosives
in the Rakat house and the building next door and minutes
later, just after the Chinooks left again, they exploded
into rubble.

&quot;I saw something that nobody ever saw in this world,&quot; said
Mr Nawaf. &quot;There were children's bodies cut into pieces,
women cut into pieces, men cut into pieces.&quot;

Among the dead was his daughter Fatima Ma'athi, 25, and
her two young boys, Raad, four, and Raed, six. &quot;I found
Raad dead in her arms. The other boy was lying beside her.
I found only his head,&quot; he said. His sister Simoya, the
wife of Haji Rakat, was also killed with her two daughters.
&quot;The Americans call these people foreign fighters. It is a
lie. I just want one piece of evidence of what they
are saying.&quot;

Remarkably among the survivors were the two married couples,
who had been staying in tents away from the main house, and
Haji Rakat himself, an elderly man who had gone to bed early
in a nearby house.

From the mosques of Ramadi volunteers had been called to
dig at the graveyard of the tribe, on the southern
outskirts of the city.

There lay 27 graves: mounds of dirt each marked with a
single square of crudely cut marble, a name scribbled in
black paint. Some gave more than one name, and one,
belonging to a woman Hamda Suleman, the briefest of
explanations: &quot;The American bombing.&quot;
