I suspect we've done this (I suspect _I've_ done this) but
suppose way back in 1985, the PTB at DC comics look at the idea of
CoIE and think &quot;there is no way that this can result in anything but
a giant snarl of contradictory continuity&quot; and reject the idea of
collapsing all of the alternate Earths in the DCU into one.

Upside: a lot of comics whose basis was undermined by CoIE
survive in a healthier form.

I suspect it won't touch some of the problems superhero
comics have&quot; the slide into grimngritty, the rise of some truly
shitty artstyles, the inevitable decline in sales. On the plus side,
Legion of Superheroes would probably have suffered, if not less at
least differently in the last generation.

Actually, what might have been an interesting idea is to do an
Earth-naught: just as Earth 1 had all its heroes begin 25 years later
than their analogs on E2, E0 is the story of an Earth whose masks are
just starting out. That's a cleaner slate with meta connections to the
old continuities and it might allow more interesting work.

The &quot;Crisis in Infinite Earths &quot; was DC's way of
jumping on Marvel's bandwagon. Marvel, then, was
believed to have found the key to infinite growth, with it's recipe of
multitudes of half-baked characters thrown at the reader at machinegun
speed and uncontrolably convoluted soapoperish plots. Crisis was DC
hammering and scissoring its characters (and their bios) into versions
compatible with Marvel's style - Or with marvel's style as DC
understood it. Unsurprisingly, they called one of Marvel's frontline
writers (John Byrne) to re-design DC's frontline character. Not too
long after that, Marvel's bubble would burst, but, by then, DC was
commited to the writing strategy and writing teams impleented with
CRISIS.   In an ATL in which DC held out, choosing to fight with its
differences instead of
adopting the competitor's stragey, DC could have
resisted until Marvel's slump, in which case, it would not have any
more motivation to copy Marvel.

No, I think unless DC edges Marvel out of the number one
spot saleswise, or unless another company does, DC will always have
at least some motivation to consider copying Marvel.

But would Marvel stay in number one spot saleswise? OTL, Marvel's
bubble eventually burst,
and DC, having jumped the bandwagon, sank too.  But we are talking
ATL, and many
longtime readers who jumped out with CRISIS (as I pretty much did
myself) would have
stayed. DC would have also preserve its own style, and contrarywise to
OTL, it
would profit from Marvel's sales slump, gobbling many readers who,
OTL, simply
opted out of comics altogether (since most comicdom was imitating
Marvel).

I did say &quot;unless DC edges Marvel out of the number one

is terribly likely:

http://www.zaksite.co.uk/lockjaw/comic_sales.html

This is weak on post-1987 data but after about 1966, DC only
matched Marvel's sales once, in 1972. CRISIS seems to have hurt them
or at least not helped, judging by the sales dip in 1986. I believe
currently Marvel has around 45% of the market and DC slightly over
35%.

The problem with the infinite Earths, in DC's view, was that their
main character's histories had multiplied into a mismash of possible
pasts, which as a plot device meant that any event could be explained
away as yet another earth.  DC chose a high-publicity angle in an
attempt to boost sales and try to enforce a one-universe rule which
seemed to work for Marvel.  It backfired.

That may happen, but the CoIE was more of a symptom of a larger
problem (IMHO): writers had to write out plots in concordance with
management directives, which sometimes completely violated the stories
they wanted to write.

Comics tend to follow fads, particularly successful ones.  IIRC,
stories like &quot;The Dark Knight Returns,&quot; and &quot;The Killing Joke&quot; were
successful, and because of that success they spawned a host of
imitators.  Granted, mini-series themselves started a host of
imitators which got out of hand.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

That was either a fad, or the result of talent finding work
elsewhere.   The rise of independent publishers started around that
time, and a lot of the established artistic and writing talent had
grown tired of the dictates of both Marvel and DC.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;the inevitable decline in sales.

Actually, one comics retailer argued that there was no real boom in
comic's readership.  Rather, it was a result of a first issue Superman
being sold for ~$30 000 US, followed by some high prices for other #1
issues (IIRC, Bat-man #1 sold $65 000 US).  That spawned a collector's
market that boosted sales which prompted the publishers to pander to
the collecters, which glutted the market, which killed the resale
value of most of the comics, which prompted the collecters to abandon
the market.  Scott McCloud, in &quot;Reinventing Comics,&quot; had a different
explanation.

Perhaps a more radical method would be to allow the writers to
completely rewrite the characters every 10 years.  Even then, the OTL
quality drop was inevitable, with the rise of independent publishing.

Mini series are a symptom of stores having to order 3 or so issues
ahead, and thus under ordering issue 4 in case the title is a flop so
they don't lose money (comics are non-returnable). Make every &quot;series&quot;
3 issues and there's no problem :) I don't mind them, really, if it
lets creators take more time on a book instead of having to rush out an
issue a month. They can take a month or two off between series to work
things out, and if it's going to be collected into one book anyways you
might as well plot out the story to fit in X number of issues.

It didn't hurt that the first issue of TMNT was such a small run and
led to such a big fad. Everyone wanted to get the next first issue that
did the same...

Just imagine if Marvel IS still top of the charts, but decaying,

Because even if Marvel's market share is declining, it
is still doing better than DC's. As well, copying a successful
practice and failing is more justifiable to one's corporate
overlords than trying something original and failing. This is
why we see so many remakes of successful movies.

Debatable. How one is doing is not just a function of a punctual
sales figure but also of immediate projected sales figures as well.

Sticking to one's tried-and-true methods is NOT
&quot;trying something original&quot;, and  it is quite justifiable,
