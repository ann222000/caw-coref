[I quote from two Internet sources. I'm interested in the parallel
between Burns and Shakespeare in respect to lack of education,
motivation in adverse circumstances, and alligorical treatment. I
see the term &quot;tragedy of the mouse&quot; used, but I'm not sure about
that. bookburn]

---Burns was born on Jan. 25, 1759, in Alloway, Ayrshire, in a home
like the one
he described in his poem 'The Cotter's Saturday Night'. His father,
William
Burnes, was a Scottish tenant farmer. His mother was Agnes Brown
Burnes.
Robert had little formal education, but he read whatever he could
get his
hands on, including Dryden, Milton, Shakespeare, and most of the
18th-century
English writers.

Robert Burns: TO A MOUSE
On Turning Her up in her Nest with the Plough, November 1785

Gilbert Burns says, `The verses to the Mouse and Mountain Daisy were
composed on the occasions mentioned, and while the author was
holding the
plough: I could point out the particular spot where each was
composed.
Holding the plough was a favourite situation with Robert for poetic
compositions, and some of his best verses were produced while he was
at that
exercise.'
`John Blane,' says Mr Chambers, `who was farm-servant at Mossgiel at
the
time of its composition, still (1838) lives at Kilmarnock. He stated
to me that
he recollected the incident perfectly. Burns was holding the plough,
with Blane
for his driver, when the little creature was observed running off
across the
field. Blane, having the pettle, or plough-cleaning utensil, in his
hand at the
moment, was thoughtlessly running after it, to kill it, when Burns
checked him,
but not angrily, asking what ill the poor mouse had ever done him.
The poet
then seemed to his driver to grow very thoughtful, and, during the
remainder of
the afternoon, he spoke not. In the night time he awoke Blane, who
slept with
him, and, reading the poem which had in the meantime been composed,
asked
what he thought of the mouse now.'

First published in the Kilmarnock edition it has moved countless
readers and
critics including Snyder who acclaimed it the outstanding
achievement in that
volume: `the tragedy of the mouse has become the tragedy of Burns
himself,
and of all heart-broken folk who review the past with regret, or
await the
future with misgiving.'

Behind what is ostensibly an inspired occasional poem is the tension
between
philosophical faith and personal insecurity. Informing the address
is Burns'
Deistic belief in a natural religion, a notion reinforced by his
reading of
favourite poets such as Thomson and Pope. Subjectively, Burns was in
a
poignant position in November 1785: the previous year his father had
died, a
victim of `the rapacious hell-hounds that growl in the kennel of
justice'; the
previous month his brother John had died at the age of sixteen.
Burns had
catastrophe on his consciousness.

R.C. Day
---------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;&lt;July 22: This is Rat Catcher's Day because in 1376 the Pied Piper got
rid of all the rats in the
German town of Hamelin.&gt;&gt;
---------------------------------------------------------------------
PER-imeter = Pi*d
---------------------------------------------------------------------
PIEd PiPER of Ham’elin.
E. Cobham Brewer 1810–1897. Dictionary of Phrase and Fable. 1898.

&lt;&lt;Pied Piper of Hamelin The Pied Piper was promised a reward if he would
drive the rats and mice out of Hameln
(Westphalia). This he did, for he gathered them together by his pipe,
and then drowned them in the Weser. As the people refused to pay him, he
next led the children to Koppelberg Hill, where 130 of them perished
(July 22nd, 1376). (See Hatto .)

“To blow the pipe his lips he wrinkled,
And green and blue his sharp eyes twinkled ...
And ere three notes his pipe had uttered ...
Out of the houses rats came tumbling-
Great rats, small rats, lean rats, brawny rats,
Brown rats, black rats, grey rats, tawny rats,
And step by step they followed him dancing,
Till they came to the river Weser.”
Robert Browning.

Hameln, on the river Hamel, is where the Rattenfänger played this
prank. It is said that the children did not perish in the mountain, but
were led over it to Transylvania, where they formed a German colony.&gt;&gt;
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Hatto Archbishop of Mainz, according to tradition, was devoured by mice.
The story says that in 970 there was a great famine in Germany, and
Hatto, that there might be better store for the rich, assembled the poor
in a barn, and burnt them to death, saying, &quot;They are like mice, only
good to devour the corn.&quot; By and by an army of mice came against the
archbishop, and the abbot, to escape the plague, removed to a tower on
the Rhine, but hither came the mouse-army by hundreds and thousands, and
ate the bishop up. The tower is still called Mouse-tower. Southey has a
ballad on the subject, but makes the invaders an army of rats.

&quot;And in at the windows, and in at the door,
And through the walls by thousands they pour,
And down through the ceiling, and up through the floor,
From the right and the left, from behind and before,
From within and without, from above and below
And all at once to the bishop they go.
They have wetted their teeth against the stones,
And now they are picking the bishop's bones;
They gnawed the flesh from every limb,
For they were sent to do judgment on him.&quot;
Southey: Bishop Hatto.

A very similar legend is told of Count Graaf, a wicked and powerful
chief, who raised a tower in the midst of the Rhine for the purpose of
exacting tolls. If any boat or barge attempted to evade the exaction,
the warders of the tower shot the crew with cross-bows. Amongst other
ways of making himself rich was buying up corn. One year a sad famine
prevailed, and the count made a harvest of the distress; but an army of
rats, pressed by hunger, invaded his tower, and falling on the old
baron, worried him to death, and then devoured him. (Legends of the
Rhine.) Widerolf, bishop of Strasburg (in 997), was devoured by mice in
the seventeenth year of his episcopate, because he suppressed the
convent of Seltzen, on the Rhine.
Bishop Adolf of Cologne was devoured by mice or rats in 1112.
Frei herr von Güttengen collected the poor in a great barn, and burnt
them to death; and being invaded by rats and mice, ran to his castle of
Güttingen. The vermin, however, pursued him and ate him clean to the
bones, after which his castle sank to the bottom of the lake, &quot;where it
may still be seen.&quot;
A similar tale is recorded in the chronicles of William of Mulsburg,
book ii. p. 313 (Bone's edition).
Mice or rats. Giraldus Cambrensis says: The larger sort of mice are
called rats. (Itinerary, book xi. 2.) On the other hand, many rats are
called mice, as mustela Alpina, the mus Indicus, the mus aquaticus, the
mus Pharaonis, etc.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Hatton The dancing chancellor. Sir Christopher Hatton was brought up to
the law, but became a courtier, and attracted the attention of Queen
Elizabeth by his very graceful dancing at a masque. The queen took him
into favour, and soon made him both chancellor and knight of the garter.
(He died in 1591.)

&quot;His bushy beard, and shoestrings green,
His high-crowned hat and satin doublet,
Moved the stout heart of England's queen,
Though Pope and Spaniard could not trouble it.&quot; Gray.

The Scottish tradition is wholly different from the
English -- dating back centuries, if not millennia.
Since Roman times (and probably earlier) there
has been no doubt about the differences. There
has been a border between the nations for that
long. Scots don't have the rigid English hierarchy,
that dates at least to the Conquest. Every Scot
thinks himself as good as any other. So their
attitude to education is quite different (as one
example -- if an important one). Likewise their
religious tradition is wholly different -- being one
that rejects established or imposed authority.
The quality of education and the rates of literacy
in Scotland have been higher (if not much higher)
than in England since printing came in.

Such traditions, even if hard to define or prove,
are immensely important. It is very much more
difficult for members of the English working,
peasant, or lower-middle-classes to become
a professional, or an artist of any sort -- than
it is for any Scot.

And what a wealth that was! Even IF the Stratman
had the right attitude, and had become literate,
and had received encouragement from someone
in the locality, what inspiring material in print was
available to him?

And, even if it was in print, what could he have
managed to buy? Could he even have afforded
the paper on which to write his early verses?
(His father started to run into financial
problems when he was about 10.)

Why do we have _nothing_ along these lines for

the remotest hint of one -- even after his death

[..]

This IS more-or-less what we would expect
from a highly talented ploughman. It reflects
exactly what he would see in the field. It
displays no knowledge and no experience
beyond such a life.

How come Shakespeare's writing indicates
nothing like this? How come everything
from his pen suggests a highly educated
Londoner?

Is there no end to Stratfordian nonsense?
Don'tcha all get sick of it?

Paul.

Of course only three of these are Scots...
does this mean *Shakespeare* was thought to be of Scottish origins
I wonder...or the genius and fame overrode such ideas.

Maybe it had to do with a possible visit of his

I note Burns and Scott went there, don't know about Byron...

of Lord BYRON &amp; [W]alter [S]cott on the north wall
and ROBERT BURNS &amp; [W]ILLIAM [S]HAKESPEARE on the south.

A distinctive fireplace is set into the center of the north wall. Above
the mantel is is a lifesized portrait of William St. Clair, painted by
Allan Ramsay. In a recess in the center of' the south wall, between the
murals, is the organ built by Snetzlear of London, installed here in
1757. This organ is similar to that used by Handel at his first
performance of the &quot;Messiah&quot; in 1742.

Throughout the world in Scottish-created Lodges the most frequently seen
engravings are of Stewart Watson's &quot;Inauguration of Robert Burns as Poet
Laureate in Canongate Lodge. &quot;The original painting is in the museum of
the Grand Lodge of Scotland in Edinburgh, Other interesting items
contained in this Lodge are the gavel on the dais presented by William
St. Clair, said to have been used at the construction of Roslyn Chapel,
and the gavel used at the altar, made from cedar from Lebanon.

Two very old Bibles are used regularly, one a Breeches Bible from the
translation in Genesis 3. This book was printed in 1589 and presented to
the Lodge on November 14, 1735. The other is a Black Letter Bible of
1642, known is the Treacle Bible, presented on August 3, 1737.

most notable is &quot;O Wert Thou in the Cauld Blast&quot; The tune was composed
by Felix Mendelsohn, but add to that Robert Schumann, Haydn,
Shostakovich, Beethoven, Bruch and Benjamin Britten plus many more.

Burns had started to read plays with a view to writing a drama. He
wanted a play that the Scots would appreciate. He wrote in a letter that
he was studying Shakespeare to learn the nuances involved in such an
enterprise.

Myth - Burns sent carronades to France to help the revolution.

Truth - Yes Burns was sympathetic to the cause of Liberty and,
yes, he was a leading figure in the capture of the brig Rosamond.
On Feb 29th 1792, he and other excise officers found themselves
wading chest-deep into the waters of the Solway. The Rosamond
had been involved in smuggling but was now grounded on the
sands waiting for the tide to lift her off. Part of the vessel's
equipment included four carronades and the story persists that
Burns bought these and sent them to the Legislative Assembly
of France. The guns never got there, allegedly held up by
the customs officers at Dover.

Myth - Burns was made Poet Laureate
when he attended Lodge Canongate Kilwinning.

Truth - This error has probably been compounded by the painting
&quot;The Inauguration of Robert Burns as Poet Laureate of Canongate
Kilwinning 1st March 1787&quot; by Stewart Watson where Burns is
shown receiving the honour. Burns only attended the Lodge once
in Feb 1787 and the next mention of him in the minutes was in
1816 when he was referred to as lately Poet Laureate of this
Lodge. No doubt the members considered him as such, but it is
certain that he was never present to receive the honour personally.

&gt;&gt; Gilbert Burns says, `The verses to the Mouse and Mountain Daisy
were
&gt;&gt; composed on the occasions mentioned, and while the author was
&gt;&gt; holding the plough: I could point out the particular spot where
each
&gt;&gt; was composed.

&gt; Why do we have _nothing_ along these lines for
&gt; Shakespeare? _Nothing_. Not a whisper. Not
&gt; the remotest hint of one -- even after his death
&gt; and even though he was, supposedly, the
&gt; greatest writer who had ever existed

"/>

Art tends to conceal itself, so I submit that the reading is there
for s/he who can read nature; because my thought is that both Burns
and Shakespeare were people whose eye scanned between heaven and
earth in a fine frenzy folling, and were good at making the
analogies, the allegories, and using metaphors. Formal education
might build artificial walls that stifle invention.

&gt; This IS more-or-less what we would expect
&gt; from a highly talented ploughman. It reflects
&gt; exactly what he would see in the field. It
&gt; displays no knowledge and no experience
&gt; beyond such a life.

"/>

Exactly the opposite, because if you can read poetry, as Burns could
read nature, you would see the &quot;of mice and men&quot; level of meaning in
the poem and celebrate the choice expressions of the English
language in it, as Scots do. The comment I quoted says, &quot;the
tragedy of the mouse has become the tragedy of Burns himself, and of
all heart-broken folk who review the past with regret, or await the
future with misgiving.&quot;
BTW, some say Burns dialect may be close to Shakespeares.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; How come Shakespeare's writing indicates
&gt; nothing like this? How come everything

&gt; Londoner?

Not true. Maybe this weekend I will select some quotes from
Shakespeare and Burnes supporting the religion of nature angle. The
quote was, &quot;behind what is ostensibly an inspired occasional poem is
the tension between philosophical faith and personal insecurity.
Informing the address is Burns' Deistic belief in a natural
religion, . . .&quot; Sorry I scrambled &quot;To a Mouse&quot; in posting or
perhaps you would have been

a notion reinforced by his
reading of
favourite poets such as Thomson and Pope. Subjectively, Burns was in
a
poignant position in November 1785: the previous year his father had
died, a
victim of `the rapacious hell-hounds that growl in the kennel of
justice'; the
previous month his brother John had died at the age of sixteen.
Burns had
catastrophe on his consciousness.

I'm truly sorry man's dominion,

An' justifies that ill opinion,

An' cozie here, beneath the blast,
Thou thought to dwell ---
Till crash ! the cruel coulter past

That wee bit heap o' leaves an' stibble,

Now thou's turn'd out, for a' thy trouble,

But och! I backward cast my e'e,
On prospects drear!
An' forward, tho' I canna see,

You have heard of Hadrian's Wall, I trust?

It is a fact that the territory we now call &quot;England
and Wales&quot; was colonised by Romans for hundreds
of years and what we now call &quot;Scotland&quot; was not.
And that most of the people living in Scotland are
descended from those living there then. It's also
likely that most of the people south of the border
are also descended from those living there then.

It may be arguable that traditions do not last that
long. I think that certain fundamental attitudes
probably do -- constantly maintained, of course,
by the physical nature of the country and the forms
of government, social structure, and types of
agriculture it allows. Large farms with plenty of
tillage under a fairly strong government could
exist for many generations in 'England' -- resulting
in a highly structured society. The rougher land
north of the Border, the harder climate, the difficult
communications and the presence of the
Highlands all meant that nothing like that was
possible.

I am merely making the point that there IS a
border, and that there has been one in that
place for as long as there have been records.
Most other borders (without a geographical
barrier) have been far more flexible or transient.
The people on either side of Hadrian's Wall are
quite different and see themselves as being
different. Alliances across the border have
been rare.

I agree with this, but *also* disagree...
like Keats'poem, there are also similarities...

A SONG ABOUT MYSELF. (John Keats)

There was a naughty boy,
A naughty boy was he,
He would not stop at home,
He could not quiet be
He took
In his knapsack
A book
Full of vowels
And a shirt
With some towels,
A slight cap
For night cap,
A hair brush,
Comb ditto,
New stockings
For old ones
Would split O!
This knapsack
Tight at's back
He rivetted close
And followed his nose
To the north,
To the north,
And follow'd his nose
To the north.

There was a naughty boy
And a naughty boy was he,
For nothing would he do
But scribble poetry
He took
An ink stand
In his hand
And a pen
Big as ten
In the other,
And away
In a pother

He ran
To the mountains
And fountains
And ghostes
And postes
And witches
And ditches
And wrote
In his coat
When the weather
Was cool,
Fear of gout,
And without
When the weather
Was warm
Och the charm
When we choose
To follow one's nose
To the north,
To the north,
To follow one's nose
To the north!

There was a naughty boy
And a naughty boy was he,
He kept little fishes
In washing tubs three
In spite
Of the might
Of the maid
Nor afraid
Of his Granny-good
He often would
Hurly burly
Get up early
And go
By hook or crook
To the brook
And bring home
Miller's thumb,
Tittlebat
Not over fat,

Minnows small
As the stall
Of a glove,
Not above
The size
Of a nice
Little baby's
Little fingers
O he made`
Twas his trade
Of fish a pretty kettle
A kettle
A kettle
Of fish a pretty kettle
A kettle!

There was a naughty boy,
And a naughty boy was he,
He ran away to Scotland
The people for to see
There he found
That the ground
Was as hard,
That a yard
Was as long,
That a song
Was as merry,
That a cherry
Was as red,
That lead
Was as weighty,
That fourscore
Was as eighty,
That a door
Was as wooden
As in England
So he stood in his shoes
And he wonder'd,
He wonder'd,
He stood in his
Shoes and he wonder'd.

THE END

&gt;&gt; The Scottish tradition is wholly different from the`&gt; English --
&gt; dating back centuries, if not millennia.

&gt; Tradition, as in &quot;Tradition and the Individual Talent&quot;? But I
think
&gt; there are commonalities of interest that cross the walls
separating
&gt; the two. We might wonder what Burns would have made of himself if
&gt; he had translated himself to London, as Shakespeare did.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Robert had little formal
&gt;&gt;&gt; education, but he read whatever he could get his hands on,
&gt;&gt;&gt; including Dryden, Milton, Shakespeare, and most of the 18th-
&gt;&gt;&gt; century English writers.

&gt;&gt; And what a wealth that was! Even IF the Stratman
&gt;&gt; had the right attitude, and had become literate,
&gt;&gt; and had received encouragement from someone
&gt;&gt; in the locality, what inspiring material in print was
&gt;&gt; available to him?

&gt; Well, he had schooling in rhetoric, enough Latin to pick up the
&gt; Romance languages, Ovid, Plautus et al, the English Bibles,
North's
&gt; translations--what else do you find necessary in addition to that?

&gt;&gt;&gt; Robert Burns: TO A MOUSE
&gt;&gt;&gt; On Turning Her up in her Nest with the Plough, November 1785

&gt;&gt;&gt; Gilbert Burns says, `The verses to the Mouse and Mountain

================================
Miscellaneous notes on Burns.

The poetry of the Caledonian Bard or Scotland's Shakespeare as he is
known, conveys a range of sorrows and joys, moods and emotions that
has appealed to people everywhere,

And such is Burns's popularity in Japan that &quot;Coming Thru' the Rye&quot;
is played on pedestrian crossings in some cities when the lights
change.

At one time every Carnegie library in the United States, some 3,460,
had a bust of Burns

Burns did not have sufficient confidence in his ability to earn his
living by writing, and, with some misgivings, in 1788 he took on the
tenancy of a farm north of Dumfries. At the same time he wrote to
the Scottish Board of Excise expressing a wish to work for it and a
post was found for him. The farm was a &quot;ruinous affair&quot; and he moved
with his wife, Jean, and their young family that included children
sired by other women to Dumfries where, never a robust man, he died
at the age of 37.

Little did tutor John Murdoch know that the young pupil who &quot;made
rapid progress in reading and was just tolerable at writing&quot; would
grow up to become Scotland's national Bard.

He spent his youth working his father's farm,

He moved around the country, eventually arriving in Edinburgh, where
he mingled in the illustrious circles of the artists and writers who
were agog at the &quot;Ploughman Poet.&quot;

On the day of his burial more than 10,000 people came to watch and
pay their respects

Not true. Following your standard practice,
I'd call you a liar. But here you are just a
fool. History is based on documented facts.
The story that &quot;the Scots were living in Ireland&quot;

I don't know its source (probably someone

The Picts appear to have been taken over by,

&gt;&gt; There is much better evidence for this. But
&gt;&gt; again, the bulk of the inhabitants of the island
&gt;&gt; at the end of Roman empire hardly went extinct,
&gt;&gt; or moved west.

&gt; And this relates to your claims concerning the antiquity of _English_
&gt; culture how?

"/>

I made no claims about an English 'culture'.
I was merely pointing out that Burns came
from a very different _tradition_ from the
Stratman. Even ignoring the facts that he
was 200 years later, that he was a part of a
highly literate society, and that he had ready
access to cheap printed books containing
material of the highest quality -- including
Shakespeare's works, he would have seen
no great impediment to becoming a literary
person if he had the interest and the desire.
Whereas a peasant in the southern part of
the island (even a contemporary of Burns)
would have been part of a much more
established order, where he was one of the
illiterates, while 'his betters' learned how to
read, and talk the talk.

Such a peasant would rarely think to rise out
of it -- unless somehow he found himself in
some special career path, such as within the
Church. The Stratman had no such 'career
path'. Any rise out of his inherited station
would have been entirely up to him and his
own efforts. Which is not to say that some did
not rise -- by making money at commercial
enterprises. But NONE became literary
figures, nor even THOUGHT of adopting a
literary career.

The Stratfordian story is closer to the incredible
than the barely credible. No sensible person
should consider it as being possibly true without
having first-rate confirmation. But there is no
confirmation whatsoever.

&gt;&gt; When approached, they are found to be cleverly executed mural paintings
&gt;&gt; of Lord Byron and Sir Walter Scott on the north wall
&gt;&gt; and ROBERT BURNS and WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE on the south.
&gt;&gt; ------------------------------------------------------

&gt; Of course only three of these are Scots...
&gt; does this mean *Shakespeare* was thought to be of Scottish origins
&gt; I wonder...or the genius and fame overrode such ideas.

&gt; Maybe it had to do with a possible visit of his
&gt; to Rosslyn Chapel...
&gt; I note Burns and Scott went there, don't know about Byron...

"/>

Byron was of course Scottish on his mother's side...*and*,
it seems, descended from King James I (James I of Scotland?)

(quote)
Byron was born in London on 22 January 1788. His father was
Captain &quot;Mad Jack&quot; Byron (1756-91), his Scottish mother was Catherine
Gordon of Gight.

Like Walter Scott , Byron was lame,
being born with a club foot that caused him much misery and is
believed to have been a factor in the development of his troubled
personality.

His father's profligacy led to financial difficulties, and his
mother, wishing to be closer to her family, took him to Aberdeen when
he was four. He attended Aberdeen Grammar School (1794-8) and is
commemorated by a statue in Skene Street. Byron succeeded to the
family title on the death of his great-uncle in 1798 and left
Scotland, never to return.

Byron's attitude to Scotland was ambivalent. In &quot;Don Juan&quot; he
writes: &quot;But I am half a Scot by birth, and bred/ A whole one&quot;... &quot;I
'scotched, not kill'd', the Scotchman in my blood,/ And love the land
of 'mountain and of flood'.&quot; Yet in &quot;The Curse of Minerva&quot;, instead of
mountain and flood (Scott's phrase) Scotland is a &quot;land of meanness,
sophistry and mist&quot;.

T. S. Eliot considered Byron's Scottishness in 1937, and Byron has
been eagerly embraced by some as a &quot;Scottish writer&quot; (appearing as
such in Trevor Royle's &quot;Companion to Scottish Literature&quot; and Reid and
Osborne's &quot;Discovering Scottish Writers&quot;), but his case illustrates
how important it is not to be restricted by pre-conceived notions of
&quot;Scottishness&quot; when judging a writer's place (if any) in Scottish
literature.

(unquote)

.........................................................

(quote)
Catherine Gordon of Gight - north of Aberdeen in the valley of
Ythan -
could claim descent from King James I,
although the poet was to be more exercised by his Byron progenitors.

His grandfather was Admiral John Byron, known as &quot;Foulweather
Jack&quot;, whose brother, the 5th Lord (1722-98) also rejoiced a nickname
- &quot;The Wicked Lord&quot;. Had circumstances fallen out such that the poet
inherited a Huntly or Gordon title then a less tormented attitude to
his Scottishness could have been the result. However, it's a big &quot;if
only&quot;.

Byron was a mere three-and-a-half when his prodigal father died,
and six when through the death in action in Corsica of the direct heir
to the Byron title, he became its heir presumptive.

He attended Aberdeen Grammar School where he is remembered in GS
Fraser's Home town elegy:

... Or I can make my town that homely fame
That Byron has, from boys in Carden Place,
Struggling home with books to midday dinner,
For whom he is not the romantic sinner,
The careless writer, the tormented face,
The hectoring bully or the noble fool,
But, just like Gordon or like Keith, a name,
A tall, proud statue at the Grammar School

Coincidentally, I posted an excerpt of this discussion (without
names) and found the following anthropological description, from
soc.culture.scottish. bookburn

(quote)
The term Scotch is used to describe Scottish of an Anglo-Saxon
ancestry. This term is put to good practice in Ulster in a hope of
strengthening ties between the provinces Presbyterians and the
English.

Thanks to modern anthropology, we know that about 80% of Scottish
people belong to Haplogroup 1. Haplogroups are basically a genetic
way
of describing ancestry, and they are based on a sequence of genes on
the Y-chromosome. Sons almost always inherit an identical copy of
their fathers Y chromosome, and the same applies for your father's
father and his father etc, etc. Prior to 3000 years ago, all of
Europe's inhabitants belonged to haplogroup 1. This therefore means
that most of Scotland's inhabitants descend form Europe's Stone Age
people.

Today, much of Europe is of &quot;Aryan&quot; extraction, which includes
Haplogroups 2, 3, and 4. HP2 being Germanic, HP3 being
Scandinavian/Slavic, and HP4 being described as Finnish. The bulk of
these people (particularly Germanic tribes) arrived in Europe as the
Roman Empire began to falter. For example, the Anglo-Saxons arrived
in
Britain when the Romans abandoned it to safeguard more important
bases
in Europe. Prior to this date, the people of southern Britain were
Briton Celts. These people were left defenceless when the Romans
left,
and the Saxons apparently removed them from the entire south of
Britain, bar Wales and Cornwall. Many Britons also fled to France to
form Brittany.

For many years, anthropologist argued about whether Picts were of
Scandinavian or Celtic extraction. It is now known that they are not
related to Scandinavians, but are in fact genetically identical to
both the Britons and the Gaels. In the Irish province of Connacht,
97%
of men with Gaelic surnames belong to haplogroup 1. Ironically
Ulster
has a higher HP1 percentage than the Irish province of Leinster
(contains Dublin) - although this is simply explained by the fact
that
most of those planted in Ulster were Scottish, while the Irish
midlands was planted by English, Normans and Huguenot.

81% of Cornish people belong to haplogroup 1.

The main haplogroup 1 nations include -
Scotland, Ireland, and the Isle of Man - Gaelic
Wales, Cornwall, and Brittany - Briton
Galicia, and the Basque Country.

And he never bothers to check anything. When he made his amazing remark
that the Scots did not come from Ireland, I checked, just in case I had
it wrong -- it's not my field, after all. The Britannica -- no, it says
the Scots came from Ireland. Try a few websites, including royal.gov.uk
and others I feel I can trust -- no, they all say the Scots came from
Ireland. Check in Google News -- no, there's no suggestion of any
controversy; I can't even find a _looney_ who doubts it, let alone an
historian.

But &quot;Creepy&quot;? He can't figure out what Britany has to do with pre-Saxon
Britain, but does he try looking it up? Nooooooooo!

&gt;&gt; *Can* Crowley actually believe that there were Scotsmen (and Englishmen) in
&gt;&gt; Roman times &quot;(and probably earlier)&quot;? His ignorance is so hair-raising
&gt;&gt; that
&gt;&gt; I suppose it's just about possible.

&gt; You have heard of Hadrian's Wall, I trust?

You have heard of The Antonine Wall?
Obviously not - look it up.

Wrong. And while you're at it, look up Mons Graupus.

Here's what my dictionary says:

&quot;Scottish is the full, original form of the adjective. Scots is an
old Scottish variant of the form; Scotch is an English contraction
of Scottish that at one time also came into use in Scotland (as
in Burns's “O thou, my Muse! guid auld Scotch drink!”) but
subsequently fell into disfavor. To some extent these facts
can serve as a guide in choosing among the many variant
forms of related words, such as Scot, Scotsman or Scotswoman,
or Scotchman or Scotchwoman, for one of the people of Scotland;
Scots, (the) Scotch, or, rarely, (the) Scottish for the people of
Scotland; and Scots, Scotch, or Scottish for the dialect of English
spoken in Scotland. The forms based on Scotch are English and
disfavored in Scotland, while those involving the full form Scottish
tend to be more formal. In the interest of civility, forms involving
Scotch are best avoided in reference to people. But there is no
sure rule for referring to things, since the history of variation in the
use of these words has also left many expressions in which the
choice is fixed, such as Scotch broth, Scotch whisky, Scottish rite,
and Scots Guards.&quot;

I don't query 'colonists' nor the kingdom of Dál
Riada. I query your original claim that &quot;the Scots
were living in Ireland&quot;. Who would want to invade
the Highlands and attempt to dislodge populations
already there? The Romans did not try, nor the

Possibly, Pictish populations in the Lowlands were

we have no good information on the matter --

Right, actually.

I did know that there had been another wall,
but I was unsure of the details. Thanks for
suggesting I look it up. I see that the Romans
did briefly (over 20 years or so) try to go beyond
Hadrian's Wall and try to bring Robert Burns'
ancestors into the Empire (making the not
unreasonable assumption that they were in
the area at the time.) They failed -- supporting
my argument that the separate tradition in that
region -- of being independent-minded unco-
operative bastards (wholly unlike the tradition
of the peasants of Stratford-upon-Avon) -- is
at least 1,900 years old.

So, basically, you regard putting something in parentheses and prefixing
it with &quot;By the way&quot; as equivalent to, say, putting it in boldface?

As to your quaint belief that there is no such place as Scotland (for if
the Scots never came from Ireland, they must, logically, still be
there), I can only say that, as 4096th in line to inherit the
Marquessate of Ailsa and Earldom of Cassilis, I refute it thus.

Apart from when there wasn't, during the time of the kingdoms of
Bernicia and Northumbria, from the 6th to the 11th centuries.
