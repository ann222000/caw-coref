Loved it.  Utterly brilliant!

I especially liked the bit where they were working out the timelines.  And
then Violet's face when Norris not only ordered a *pint* but pickled eggs as
well! LOL

It's nice to see Norris relaxed for a change, even if it *is* liquid
relaxation.

Her indoors says &quot;What about Derek Wilton?&quot; . No mention poor chap, and
maybe *he* was the longest serving husband. Though being dead-oh, he
couldn't  &quot;of&quot; chaired the meeting.

Also I though Keith Barron was fine. Mebbe it's when he tries to be
funny that I really don't like him.

And - and!! Here's summat! That there Paul Copley what played the other

From IMDB:

Name a well-known TV programme, he's been in it.  Also the narrator of
&quot;How Clean is Your house&quot;.  He also appeared on CS in 1972.

Remembered mostly for &quot;Roughnecks&quot; and &quot;Hornblower&quot; on my part.

I used to live down the street from the mother of Derek Benfield, who

I've even got a photo of me and my friend with him c. 1954. He has 71
acting credits on IMDb, and he wrote 4 episodes of Dixon of Dock Green.

You mean &quot;trouper&quot; - member of a stage troupe or company.

A trooper is a cavalry soldier, a mounted police officer or a US state
patrol officer.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It's nice to see Norris relaxed for a change, even if it *is*
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; liquid relaxation.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and maybe *he* was the longest serving husband. Though being
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; dead-oh, he couldn't  &quot;of&quot; chaired the meeting.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Also I though Keith Barron was fine. Mebbe it's when he tries to be

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; And - and!! Here's summat! That there Paul Copley what played the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; other husband (Ivor?) he was at school with me. How about that? I'm
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; almost on Corrie :)

&gt;&gt;&gt;Yay!  That makes you a ratucs celebrity!

&gt;&gt;&gt;I recognise that uncle Paul Copley and all. What else has he been in?

&gt;&gt; He is an old trooper and has done masses of radio and TV - off the top
&gt;&gt; of my head I recall he was in &quot;The Lakes&quot;  with John Simm and in
&gt;&gt; Hornblower as a petty officer- fantastic hat, and , well, there y go

That reminds me of Linda Baron, whom appeared in a dinnerladies episode we
watched tonight as the overwrought mother of Bren's mother's (Julie
Walters) teenage toyboy. She didn't look a bit like Nurse Gladys Emmanuel!
She appeared in Corrie in 1997 as an intimidating date for Jack (posing as
Ken) through Alec's Golden Years Escort Agency.

&gt; &gt; Good to see him - do you know he once appeared in a fillum with Billy
&gt; &gt; Walker's girlfriend and Al Swearengen? :-D

&gt; That reminds me of Linda Baron, whom appeared in a dinnerladies episode we
&gt; watched tonight as the overwrought mother of Bren's mother's (Julie
&gt; Walters) teenage toyboy. She didn't look a bit like Nurse Gladys Emmanuel!
&gt; She appeared in Corrie in 1997 as an intimidating date for Jack (posing as
&gt; Ken) through Alec's Golden Years Escort Agency.

Album recommendation.

American III: A Solitary Man.  Utterly brilliant.  Cash does a cover version
of U2's &quot;One&quot; that is far better than the original.

Thanks, Enzo.  I wonder if Bas has it so that I can nick it temporarily
put it on my iPod for a while.

&gt; &gt;Loved it.  Utterly brilliant!

&gt; &gt;I especially liked the bit where they were working out the timelines.  And
&gt; &gt;then Violet's face when Norris not only ordered a *pint* but pickled eggs as
&gt; &gt;well! LOL

&gt; &gt;It's nice to see Norris relaxed for a change, even if it *is* liquid
&gt; &gt;relaxation.

&gt; Her indoors says &quot;What about Derek Wilton?&quot; . No mention poor chap, and
&gt; maybe *he* was the longest serving husband. Though being dead-oh, he
&gt; couldn't  &quot;of&quot; chaired the meeting.

&gt; Also I though KeithBarronwas fine. Mebbe it's when he tries to be
&gt; funny that I really don't like him.

&gt; And - and!! Here's summat! That there Paul Copley what played the other
&gt; husband (Ivor?) he was at school with me. How about that? I'm almost on
&gt; Corrie :)
