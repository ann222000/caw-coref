I want to measure % of K in solutions using our ICP facility.
Unfortunately i see that K lines can be affected by argon lines. Can
someone suggest me the best line to be used. I see that these lines
are quite week if compared with argon lines. My final result can be
affected somehow.
Regards,
Luca

A flame source is much better than the ICP for the alkali
metals.  If you have an atomic absorption spectrometer, you
can probably use it in the flame emission mode.  If not AA
is still better than ICP.

An ion-sensitive electrode is another possibility.
