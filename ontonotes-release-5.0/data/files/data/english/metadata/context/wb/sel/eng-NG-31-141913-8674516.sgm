1. DEBATING GARDASIL IN CANADA
by Judith Siers-Poisson
On Wednesday, September, 5, 2007, I was pleased to
participate in a panel discussion on The Agenda with Steve Paikin on
Ontario Public Television in Toronto, Canada. (You can view the
debate by going to www.tvo.org , going to the page for The Agenda,
finding the program for September 5th, and then selecting the tab
that says &quot;Gardasil, Morality and Medicare&quot; and clicking on
&quot;view video&quot; to the right.)
Thanks to the wonders of video uplinks, I was brought in with
2 other remote guests from Ottawa and Montreal. The other three
guests were in the Toronto studio.

2. IT'S A TOBACCO THING, YOU WOULDN'T UNDERSTAND: VIRGINIA COMMONWEALTH UNIVERSITY AND THE TOBACCO INDUSTRY
by Anne Landman
Interested in researching and exposing tobacco industry spin?
Visit our Tobacco Portal on Sourcewatch, sponsored by CMD and the
American Legacy Foundation. Join our team of citizen journalists
researching and exposing tobacco industry secrets.
It's no secret that Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU)
shares a cozy relationship with the tobacco industry.  In fact, VCU
and the industry have long supported each other in a number of ways.
In 1991, while other medical schools including Harvard and
Johns Hopkins were divesting their tobacco stocks, VCU's longtime
President, Dr. Eugene Trani, was working to make VCU more
tobacco-friendly, negotiating a new smoking policy that explicitly
permitted smoking in 41 out of 42 of the University's facilities.
The one area where smoking was not permitted was VCU's hospital,
since this would have made it ineligible for accreditation, and
hence government Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements. Philip Morris
CEO Michael Szymanczyk was the keynote speaker at VCU's graduation
ceremony in 2003. In 2005, USA Today reported that PM had endowed a
Chair of International Business in the University's School of
Business, and that PM was at that time funding 12 studies at VCU
accounting for $4.4 million.  Also in 2005, the Richmond
Times-Dispatch reported that PM was investing $300 million in a new
Virginia Biotechnology Research Park and that VCU had been closely
involved in the negotiations to create the facility.  The Dispatch
wrote that, thanks to the Biotech Park, &quot;VCU is poised to become a
partner in key areas of compatible research with Philip Morris.&quot;

3. DID MARLBORO MAN EDIT WIKIPEDIA?
by Bob Burton
Philip Morris (PM) has long been a past master at funding
front groups and organizing scientists to deny the obvious. Now it
is apparent that someone at PM tried puffing the entry in Wikipedia
on the Marlboro cigarette.

1. FEATURED PARTICIPATORY PROJECT: ELI LILLY'S CONTRIBUTIONS TO PATIENT AND OTHER GROUPS
http://www.prwatch.org/node/6435
In May of this year, the drug company Eli Lilly announced that it
would post details of &quot;all educational grant funding and other
monetary contributions provided to U.S.-based organizations&quot; into an
online database. Tucked away amongst the numerous  grants made in
the first six months of 2007 are details of funds provided to
patient groups, various research centres and a sprinkling of
political groups. So, to save citizens and journalists from having
to sift through the whole report, we have a created a page to make
the highlights a little easier to find. If you'd like to help dig
out the nuggets, just head over to the SourceWatch page for the
project, where there are complete instructions, a couple of examples
of interesting grants and an email hotline for support. If this is
your first time editing on SourceWatch, you can register here, and
learn more about adding information to the site here,  hereand here.
HAVE FUN, AND THANKS FOR YOUR HELP!

1. PR ADVISER PRAISES MALDIVES PRISONS
http://www.prwatch.org/node/6438
Nic Careem, a London-based &quot;public affairs consultant&quot;, recently
proclaimed his interest in helping raise the profile of the
President of the Maldives, Dr Abdul Gayoom, on the issue of global
warming. While Gayoom's government has been widely criticized for
human rights abuses, earlier this year Careem gushed that he was
&quot;impressed with the humanity shown to prisoners.&quot; In response to
recent criticism of his defense of the regime, Careem wrote that the
&quot;penal system&quot; is &quot;as good as anything in the western world&quot; and
explained that murders occurred in his own London suburb. In a
pointed letter to the editor, a reader objected to the comparison:
&quot;Does Mr Careem know that we too have murder cases in the Maldives?
The police torture and kill detainees to perpetuate the regime in
this country.&quot; Last year, Nick Falloon from Hill &amp; Knowlton's London
office, was deluged with critical comments after defending his
company's work for the Gayoom regime on his blog.

2. WHITEOUT FOR THE WEB
http://www.prwatch.org/node/6437
Consumers Union, the publisher of Consumer Reports magazine,
recently had firsthand experience with search engine optimization
(SEO) techniques that companies are using to suppress negative
stories about themselves on the Internet. A company called &quot;DONE!
SEO&quot; claims that it can &quot;Displace -- push down -- the negative
listings with favorable ones and ones that you can control or
influence&quot; to &quot;make sure that your company and key executives are
being portrayed favorably online by burying the negatives and
maintaining a positive online image.&quot; One of the &quot;problem sites&quot;
where it promised to perform this service was ConsumerWebWatch.org,
the Internet arm of Consumers Union. Another company, called
&quot;Reputation Defender,&quot; offers what it calls &quot;Google insulation,&quot;
padding the web with friendly-sounding content about its clients and
then pushing that content to the top of Google results so that
negative information is harder to find.

3. FRAMING THE WAR ON TERROR
http://www.prwatch.org/node/6436
The Gallup polling organization marked the sixth anniversary of
the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks by publishing a thoughtful
analysis challenging the assumption that &quot;religious fanaticism fuels
extremism and therefore replacing Muslims' worldview with Western
liberalism is the path to victory against terrorism. ... As a
starting point, Muslims do not hold a monopoly on extremist views.
While 6% of Americans think attacks in which civilians are targets
are 'completely justified,' in both Lebanon and Iran, this figure is
2%, and in Saudi Arabia, it's 4%. In Europe, Muslims in Paris and
London were no more likely than were their counterparts in the
general public to believe attacks on civilians are ever justified
and at least as likely to reject violence, even for a 'noble cause.'
After analyzing survey data representing more than 90% of the global
Muslim population, Gallup found that despite widespread
anti-American sentiment, only a small minority saw the 9/11 attacks
as morally justified. Even more significant, there was no
correlation between level of religiosity and extremism among
respondents.&quot; Rather than religion, extremists are motivated by the
belief that &quot;occupation and U.S. domination&quot; is threatening their
societies. &quot;The real difference between those who condone terrorist
acts and all others is about politics, not piety,&quot; writes Dalia
Mogahed.

4. SADDAM DID 9/11 -- ONE-THIRD OF AMERICANS BELIEVE THE BIG LIE
http://www.prwatch.org/node/6427
An important New York Times/CBS News survey finds that six years
after the terror attacks of 9/11, &quot;33 percent of all Americans,
including 40 percent of Republicans and 27 percent of Democrats, say
Saddam Hussein was personally involved.&quot;  In reality, of course,
Saddam and Iraq had absolutely no connection to the terror attacks.
1/3 of Americans believe the Big Lie propaganda tactics employed by
the pro-war lobby.  Only 5 percent of Americans &quot;most trusted the
Bush administration to resolve the war, the poll found. Asked to
choose among the administration, Congress and military commanders,
21 percent said they would most trust Congress and 68 percent
expressed most trust in military commanders.   That is almost
certainly why the White House has presented General Petraeus and Mr.
Crocker as unbiased professionals, not Bush partisans.&quot;

5. CMD'S FOUNDER JOHN STAUBER PROFILED IN CAP TIMES
http://www.prwatch.org/node/6425
Rob Zaleski, columnist with Madison's Capital Times,  has written
a profile piece on CMD's founder John Stauber.  &quot;In the beginning,
it was just Stauber and his buddy Sheldon Rampton, a local
typesetter and Princeton University grad Stauber recruited to help
produce the first issue of PR Watch.  ...  Fourteen years later, the
center has 10 staffers and an $800,000 budget. And nobody is more
surprised, or proud, by its growth and success than Stauber, who at
54 says he's more determined than ever to expose the powerful
corporate and government spin machines and diminish their impact. 'I
could walk in front of a bus today and, while the center would
hiccup, it would continue to survive and thrive,' he maintains,
'because we have an amazing staff, and the work we do is absolutely
unique.' &quot;

6. LOBBYING FOR BABYKILLERS
http://www.prwatch.org/node/6422
Babies that are not breast fed suffer higher rates of health
problems including sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), diabetes,
lymphoma, leukemia, Hodgkin's disease, obesity, high cholesterol and
asthma. Unfortunately, many parents are still unaware of these
risks, thanks to the infant formula industry. In 2003, the industry
hired a former chairman of the Republican National Committee and
former agriculture secretary Clayton Yeutter, who lobbied the U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to yank an
attention-grabbing advertising campaign that would have warned of
the risks. Yeutter told HHS Secretary Tommy Thompson the ads should
be pulled because they would create &quot;guilty feelings&quot; in women who
fail to breastfeed. HHS replaced the original ads with a
watered-down advertising campaign, which was so ineffective that
breast-feeding rates actually dropped during the period when it was
broadcast. In an interview with PR Week, Mardi Mountford of the
International Formula Council disputed accusations of undue industry
influence.

7. I CAN'T BELIEVE IT'S NOT BUTTER!  DIACETYL-FLAVORED POPCORN MAKES HEADLINES
http://www.prwatch.org/node/6421
52 year old furniture salesman and nonsmoker Wayne Watkins
suddenly found himself getting short of breath while golfing and
singing in the choir.  From his symptoms, doctors at Denver's
National Jewish Medical &amp; Research Center deduced that Watson had
indulged excessively in an entirely different behavior that over
time had reduced his lung capacity by 50%: eating microwave popcorn.
Mr. Watson admitted to eating 2-3 bags of microwave popcorn a day
for years, making a point of inhaling the fumes that come from the
steamy bag of popcorn when it is first opened.  His  condition,
bronchiolitis obliterans, is also known among food workers as
&quot;popcorn lung,&quot; and strikes food manufacturing employees who work
around popcorn.  The illness is caused by diacetyl, the chemical
companies add to popcorn to make it taste buttery.  Orville
Redenbacher, Act II, Pop Secret and Jolly Time all use it.  Jiffy
Pop, which gets popped on the stovetop, doesn't.  Popcorn workers'
plight aside, just one day after the story about Wayne Watson's
condition was printed in the Denver Post, all four of the above
companies agreed to immediately remove the chemical from their
popcorn.

8. FLACKS GET A CHILL UP THE SPINE
http://www.prwatch.org/node/6419
James L. Horton of the Robert Marston &amp; Associates PR firm is
worried about Wikileaks, a new website that provides a means for
people to share information about unethical behavior by governments
and corporations. Wikileaks says it &quot;is developing an uncensorable
Wikipedia for untraceable mass document leaking and participatory
analysis. Our primary interests are oppressive regimes in Asia, the
former Soviet bloc, Sub-Saharan Africa and the Middle East, but we
expect to be of assistance to peoples of all countries who wish to
reveal unethical behavior in their governments and corporations.&quot; On
his blog, Horton says this &quot;statement of purpose is chilling. ...
The site has been successful already in revealing the misbehavior of
an African leader. If it endures, it is a matter of time before
whistle-blowers use it elsewhere. I suppose one can look at it as a
full-employment reason for crisis PR practitioners.&quot;
