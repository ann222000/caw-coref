Getting bored waiting for Apple to deliver my new MacBook Pro to the
Sacramento Apple store, so think I will yank the tails of the
ignoramuses in this NG who believe that hex zero and ASCII zero are the
exact same thing.

Still haven't heard from you about my ballroom dance video:

PS: No one has stated that &quot;hex zero and ASCII zero are the
exact same thing.&quot;  You've misinterpreted everything anyone has ever
posted on that topic, and in general.

Hint: he's gonna try to yank his own tail.

Memo to Markie-poo: tails are in back. Something else is in front, and if you
keep on yanking on it, be careful where you point it.

Depends on what you are talking about; the *value* zero is about
zero, independently of number base. However, a hex zero character
represents only four bits, whereas an ASCII zero character (NUL)
represents eight bits.

Ah. And if you write it on ten bits of paper, its ten bits.

Still looks like nothing to me tho.

That depends on what you mean by &quot;ASCII 1&quot;.

Do you mean the ASCII *value* 1, or the ASCII *character* &quot;1&quot;?

The printable ASCII character &quot;1&quot; is represented internally as the
decimal number 49.

The ASCII value 1 (the decimal number 1) cannot be represented
visually, because it is outside the range of printable characters. This
value represents the &quot;Start of Header&quot; character.

For more information, see:
