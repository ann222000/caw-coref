Ken,
I need to pick your brain and I want to do it here, just in case someone
else might be able to help...

When I was a kid, my uncle would always drag out his guitar whenever we
visited him.
He knew a quite a few humorous songs that I've since forgotten, but there
was one that we all loved.
It told the story of young man who took a young lady out on a date to dinner
and she ordered everything on the menu.
&quot;And all I had to my name was fifty cents&quot;...or something of that nature was
the hook line.

Ring any bells?

Bob, the first one that comes to mind is &quot;International Feeder.&quot;  It
is a story about a guy who takes women out and all of them eat like a
horse and now &quot;he is looking for a girl with acute indigestion&quot; and he
went to a magician that sawed women in half &quot;but he gave me the half
that eats.&quot;

That was a very popular song once and it was a good dialect song and
often done in either Scot or Yiddish accents.  Both of these cultures
are thought to be a frugal sort.

That, by the way, was not a simple song, but there could have been
simpler versions.

I will check some of my notes.

Ken

Or this?  &lt;g&gt;

I took my girl to a fancy ball;

It was a social hop.

We waited till the folks got out,

And the music it did stop.

Then to a restaurant we went,

The best one on the street.

She said she wasn't hungry

But this is what she ate.

A dozen raw, a plate of slaw,

A chicken and a roast,

Some applesauce and asparagus,

And soft-shell crabs on toast.

A big box stew, and crackers too;

Her appetite was immense!

When she called for pie,

I thought I'd die,

For in my pocket I had but fifty cents.

She said she wasn't hungry

And didn't care to eat,

But I've money in my clothes

To bet she can't be beat.

She took it in so cozy,

She had an awful tank.

She said she wasn't thirsty

But this is what she drank.

A whisky skin, a glass of gin,

Which made me shake with fear,

A ginger pop, with rum on top,

A schooner then of beer,

A glass of ale, a gin cocktail.

She should have had more sense.

When she called for more

I fell on the floor

For in my pocket I had but fifty cents.

Of course I wasn't hungry

And didn't care to eat,

Expecting every moment

To be kicked into the street.

She said she'd fetch her family round,

And some night we'd have fun

But in my pocket I had but fifty cents.

When I gave the man the fifty cents,

This is what he done:

He tore my clothes,

He smashed my nose,

He hit me on the jaw,

He gave me a prize

Of a pair of black eyes

And with me swept the floor.

He took me where my pants hung loose,

And threw me over the fence.

Now take my advice, don't try it twice

If in your pocket you've got but fifty cents.

The words came from --

http://corry.ws/CorryBook-22.htm

All I did was sort on &quot;song all I had was fifty cents&quot; and it was
about the third hit.  &lt;g&gt;

Isn't the internet a wonderful resource?  &lt;g&gt;

Ken...glad to help...if that is the right song.

That's it!

I had googled for that before, and never came up with it.

My Uncle Ray was quite the guy.
6'7&quot;, with shoulders as wide as a door.
He was missing the  ring  and middle fingers on his right hand.
He had been shot by a jealous husband and one of the shots hit his hand.
I asked him where his hand was when he got shot, and he said,
&quot;What the hell would you be covering up if  your girlfriend's husband was
shooting at you&quot;?
&quot;Damn...did you get hit in the, you know...the privates?'
&quot;Yeah, but I only lost an inch or two and it actually makes walking around
more comfortable.
That ol' boy did me a favor by lopping off a little.&quot;...

He'd been married 5 times and three times it was to a woman named Mary!
He said by the time he got done paying for the divorces, he didn't have
enough money left to change the monogrammed towels, so he just found another
one named Mary.

He had an old D28 and knew three -four chords, but with that limited music
knowledge he could light up a room.
Thank you...my sisters and my mother thank you as well because they've been
after me for years to play this song.

Absolutely great story.  Ted Blackwell, are you there?  Did you read
this?  Do you feel a song coming on?

Aren't we all blessed with some strange relatives?  I feel sorry for a
family that is only, 100% functional.  I had a drinkin' aunt when that
really meant something.  I had a whoring aunt but they didn't call her
that...bless her heart.

G-G-dad ran the stage from Cleburne to Hillsboro (Texas).  He carried
a sawed-off shotgun and bugle.  It is a recorded fact that if someone
heard that bugle and it wasn't &quot;on time,&quot; it meant that the stage was
in trouble and if people wanted their mail and relatives, they'd
better saddle up in a hurry.

He let a sleeping Cleburne know he was on time when he would run the
horses down through a ford on Buffalo Creek just outside Cleburne
while standing up blowing his bugle.      &lt;g&gt;

My mother told me for years that those were the Itasca Cashions and we
were NOT akin to &quot;that bunch.&quot;  I did some checking and found that
those Itasca Cashions produced a son born on my G-dad's birthday and
he was named after their father...John W. Cashion...which was strange
since that was MY g'dad's name; John Wise Cashion.  And it was also my
dad's name.

When I confronted my mom with this information, she huffed a little
bit and then said, &quot;Well, we might be.  I don't want to talk about
it.&quot;  Most of the early Cashions died young and generally violently.

I was listening to that song just yesterday...and the day before.

I have a lot of mp3s on this computer and I play them often!

I have that song by Bob Roberts, 1906  (Yes! 1906)  You want a copy of
the mp3?

Thanks both of you guys.  My Mom used to sing a snippet of song about
being &quot;Behind Those Swinging Doors&quot;.  I googled up the lyrics and found
out that it was a Spike Jones song.

If Spike Jones did it, there is a good bet it was a parody.  There
might be some real words out there somewhere.

It is said that an intellectual is someone who can hear the William
Tell Overture and not think of the Lone Ranger...I cannot hear
&quot;Somewhere Over The Rainbow&quot; without thinking of Homer and Jethro.

It has taken me a long time to hear the beautiful prohibition song
&quot;Cocktails For Two&quot; and not expect it to crash into the Spike Jones
version.

And on my newest Vitaphone shorts collection I got several songs by
Dick Rich and his Melodious Monarchs, this was from 1928 (done in
Burbank, CA) and he does &quot;Chloe&quot; and &quot;Ramona&quot;.  There is no doubt that
Spike Jones heard him.

I find more and more often that some one I thought was an original,
wasn't.  I guess who made the oldest recording should get credit for
it.       &lt;g&gt;

And I am babbling....

Best I can find, it was as composed when Spike did it.  It's a fun song
by itself.  It was written by Fleming Allan.  The year on the lyrics I
found was 1941.  All I can find about Mr. Allan is that he was a film
composer for westerns in the 30's.  I may actually have to invest in a
Spike Jones CD.

I know they had some originals...how could some one produce
&quot;Beetlebaum&quot; from something else?  &lt;g&gt;

I have three Spike Jones CD and a couple of videos of he and his band.
They were a wild bunch.  His lead tenor banjoist was the funniest in
the band.

In one of the videos, it starts with a voice over and the dignified
voice says, &quot;In the beginning, music sounded like this...&quot; and they
show three cave men banging rocks together in an uncoordinated manner.
Then the guys says &quot;and then there was...&quot; and there was medieval
group with Gregorian chants...&quot;and then...&quot; and now they show a large
costume ball with the maskers doing the minuet, -- this progresses
through sweet bands, then a Benny Goodman, and the voice says...&quot;and
after many years we have Spike Jones and the City Slickers!&quot;  And the
scene goes back to the cavemen beating rocks together.  &lt;g&gt;

As has been said, &quot;You have to have a bunch of really good musicians
to sound that bad.&quot;  I think I will check a couple of books and see if
any of the Dick Rich bunch played with Spike Jones.

While you are at it...get a Hoosier Hotshot CD and at least one of the
Jonathon and Darlene&quot; CDs...oh YEAH! and get a Red Ingles and His
Natural Seven with Cinderella G. Stump.  Get the one with &quot;I Love You
For Seventy Mental Reasons,&quot; and &quot;Temptation.&quot;

Absolutely right.  &quot;Behind Those Swinging Doors&quot; by Spike Jones and
his City Slickers (his very first record, 1941) was a parody of a 1864
tear-jerker, &quot;Come Home, Father,&quot; composed by Henry Clay Work (who
also composed &quot;My Grandfather's Clock&quot;).

BTW, &quot;I Had But 50 Cents&quot; was remade on an LP by R. Crumb and his
Cheap Suit Serenaders, probably in the 1970s.

You are kidding.  That is interesting about Crumb.  What a strange
fellow.  I know a couple of guys who played with him early on.  Both
play with Janet Klein and the Parlor Boys now.

Thanks for the info.
