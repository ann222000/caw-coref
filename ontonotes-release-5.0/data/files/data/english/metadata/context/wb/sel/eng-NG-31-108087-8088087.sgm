Took Sue out on my new 1997 Carbureted Electra Glide Classic with 28k
miles on the mechanical yesterday.  Prior to our ride we dropped by the HD
Dealer to see if they had a record of the bike.  In fact they did, and
they say the previous owner apparently did a good job of having them
service the bike.  No stage kits, no muffler work, no internal work other
than standard maintenance like tires and wheel bearing (forgot whether
that was pack or new).  I know the oil is clean.  Too clean.  So clean
you'd think it had just had a tear down.

Then we walked among the many used bikes for say, seeing two different
sidecars, each on sale for $5000.  Saw some convex mirrors with the same
Live to Ride logo as the non-convex ones on the bike now for $50 each.

Back home, I decided to check the tire and air shock pressures.  Tires and
shocks were fine, but I went ahead and gave the rear an extra 2 pounds.
As I was returning my little air shock hand pump/gauge to it's home on the
wall, I noticed I had red oil all over my hand.  For some reason the gauge
had oil all over it.  I then pump red oil out of the shock pump into a
paper towel, which meant those 2 pound I just added to the rear no doubt
pumped some of this oil into the air line.  My little pump probably isn't
too happy either.

Wondering what that was all about, I decided to drain the air out of the
shocks to see what came out.  Hardly any oil came out of the rear (just a
bubble), but maybe an ounce came out of the front air bleeder.  I
repeatedly pumped and bled the front air line till I was getting only air,
wondering about the significance of what I was experiencing.  A fork seal
project similar to what I did with my Concours when I bought it?

We finally got on the road, heading out the Seward Highway as the norm to
eat a pizza at Chair 5 in Girdwood.  Traffic was bogged down by
sightseers, so we were going as slow as 40 mph in a 55.  It's a shame I
didn't take a camera as we had a lows 70s F day.  The Alyeska ski slope
looked really nice.  Picture a green mountain with a restaurant at its
peak, someone paragliding in front of that mountain, and a taller mountain
behind the restaurant, also snow free except for a snow field that sits
directly behind the restaurant, creating a contrast that causes the
restaurant to standout.  You had to have been there I suppose.

Gassed up at the Girdwood intersection and headed on down the highway for
Turnagin Pass to see if this bike could maintain speed 2-up on a long
grade.  I'm happy to say I maintained 72 mph uphill in 5th gear without a
problem.  This bike is going to be allright.  Heading home I passed a few
people, hitting up to 90 in one case.  The bike was smooth as glass at
that speed, other than a little head buffeting.  Gassed up back at town
with 75 miles on the trip meter.  It looks like I was getting between 35
and 39 mpg, much of that at 55 mph.

One complaint is that it is too stinking loud when accelerating full on.
I did a close inspection of the pipes when I arrived home.  Mufflers are
Part No. 65539-95, apparently OEM Harley pipes guaranteed to not exceed 80
db.  On the net, this part number is shown as belonging to bikes older
than mine, but my guess is the exhaust is stock.  I did find two exhaust
leaks (black soot), so perhaps I can quiet it down by fixing the leaks.
This thing is going to deafen me.

A few passing experiences.  I was a fighting  headwind and seemed to get a
blast as I hit 80 which actually prevented me from going any faster.  This
morning I learned I have a red-line (5k rpm) spark retarder, so now I'm
wondering if I forgot about the tach and redlined the thing in 4th.  I
also experienced a backfire twice, each time after a wide-open pass
followed by a full off deceleration to get back down to a reasonable
speed.

While I'm not happy about the exhaust noise and finding oil in my shock
air line, I'm happy with the performance of the stock 1340 Classic.  Much
more comfortable than the Concours, but given my posture I think the
backrest I ordered will be an asset, even if the $300 price is outrageous.
I experienced pressure at the base of my back where I was resting against
the sweep of the seat toward the end of the ride.  Riding a 1997
Electraglide Classic is not a high tech experience, but I enjoy the old
tech.  Now if I can only remember I now have a fuel petcock that is
supposed to be turned off, and back on.

Time to order a repair manual and learn about front forks,
Robert

Someone likely knocked out the baffles in those mufflers. Check ebay
for some stock replacements. They're a dime-a-dozen as most folks
replace 'em w/aftermarket muffs.

Thanks Rayvan.
I hadn't thought about the mufflers being modified.

Look into the pipe with a flashlight. If you can see right down the
middle, they're modified.

The baffles route all the exhaust into the packing that's packed into
the 'outer surround' in the mufflers. The faffles look just like a
freeze-plug. They're welded to a perforated core in the center of the
muffler and are fairly easy to knock out. After the modification,
they're built exactly like an automotive Cherry Bomb glasspack: Kind
of quiet at idle but LOUD as heck when you're on the throttles at
all.

In about 1998 I tried this mod w/my Sportster. A friend had some stock
muffs he gave me for free so I figured it was worth a try. I hated the
sound and pulled 'em after one day. I could never stand the sound of
Cherry Bomb glasspacks either!
