Uriah ANDO(E/W) was the eldest son of Richard and Ann (NUTT) of
Walton, SOM, England.

On 20 Oct 1828, he acquired lodgings at Ilchester Gaol.  He was
convicted on 28 Mar 1829, and invited to take a cruise to Australia on
the Claudine, departing London, on 19 Aug 1829, for a lifelong
holiday.  He arrived 6 Dec of that year.

Sometime between 1838 and 1849 he was pardoned.  He seems to have made
four attempts.

As far as I know, he didn't return to England although he'd left a
wife, Eleanor/Ellen (nee MARSH) behind along with his son, George.
However, Eleanor and George disappear after 1851, as does Eleanor's
illegitimate dau, Emily Marsh ANDOW.

I've yet to find out what Uriah did to warrant a life sentence.

I have showing his arrival in Australia, his pardons and
transportation.

What I don't know is what happened to him after he arrived other than
he was employed by Wm BLACK in Windsor.

I've tried the NSW site but there's nothing coming up for a marriage
or any children.  Nor a death.

What sources are available, online please, that I can try to find out
what happened to him?  I'm in the UK, so visiting repositories is not
an option.

Hi Charani

His records according to the Indent of the &quot;Claudine&quot; state that he:

Was about 30 years of age when he arrived in Port Jackson (Sydney). He was
Protestant, could read and was a married man with one child. He gave his native
place as Somersetshire and his trade listed that he could plough, reap, shear
and milk. The offence for which he obtained a Life sentence was sheep stealing
and as tried on the 28th March 1829.

He applied for a Conditional Pardon 21st July 1847 and this was granted on the 1
October 1848 - Conditional Pardon No. 48/1773. He had obtained numerous Tickets
of Leave prior to receiving his CP  i.e. in 1838, 1840 and 1843

That's brilliant!!  You're an angel!! :D  Thank you so much for that
:))

From my rummaging around a Conditional Pardon I understand meant that
he couldn't return to England although he was effectively free, is
that right?

What would he have got the Tickets of Leave for though?

His trade gives a good insight too.  Other references only say he was
a labourer.

Uriah was my 4xgreat uncle, incidentally :))

Do you suspect that his wife may have come to Australia?

All sorts of indexes online including Immigration records at:
http://www.records.nsw.gov.au/archives/indexes_online_3357.asp I did a very
quick and dirty search there in the immigration section for his wife -
didn't find anything.

SAG (Socy of Aus Genies) http://www.sag.org.au/
Go to Databases, then the Ticket of leave section 1810-1875.  You can see
the conditons applying to T.O.L. there.  If you do an advanced search for
Ando (no 'e' or 'w'), you will find that Uriah appears - he seems to have
been assigned to a number of places at various times including Maitland and
Mudgee (and I'm fairly sure it would be hime given that it mentions Som.,
the Claudine (although perhaps there were 2 Uriah Andos on the Claudine [fat
chance I suspect] - there appears to be 2 pages on him but I can't get
beyond the first page for some reason.

It's possible that she followed him once he was given his Conditional
Pardon.  Or he could have changed his surname, got himself back to
England and resumed his family life somewhere else in the country, he
could have turned his hand to anything agricultural.  One of the
variations on ANDO is ANDREWS - much easier to disappear with a name

Hi Charani

Had a sleuth around some records of various CDs and fiche...........
Not everythings on line :-))

Theres a CD published by the SAG ( Society of Australian
Genealogists)  AGCI Vol 2 , indexes from the NSW Government Gazettes
1832  - 1863

Uriah ANDO is mentioned 5 times.... Probably  when CPs were issued
..

4 Sep 1838  Maitland ( in the Hunter Valley 200 ks or so north from
Sydney, just a few ks  west of whats now the city of Newcastle )
1 Jun 1842        &quot;
22 May 1843     &quot;
14 Nov 1843  Mudgee ( about the same distance by NW of Sydney)

Via the CD version or on line you can look up the Uriahs who died in

In a slim book I have  are transcriptons from newspapers of passengers
sailing to California 1849 - 1852 .    The lure of gold attracted
quite a few ex cons  to California were some known as the Sydney Ducks
caused a bit of mayhem . And then alot came back in 1852 when the
world went gold fever crazy  in AUS . No ANDO/vars found in that

In the Colonial Corressepondence indexes . I have the fiche 1826 -
1842 and no ANDO/vars

There was a ship named Panama what came here in 1850 that carried a
few wifes of convicts  but  no refs found
for your lot

He could have easily changed his name  . In word association Uriah =
HEAP   :-))

Just got a surprise ........ checked my 2003 phone CD ( last one made)
&amp; there were 22 x ANDO's , scattered across NSW,QLD, VIC &amp; WA and one

I spotted him and wondered if there was a connection between him and
Uriah.  James is listed as ANDO or ANDREWS.  A branch of the family
that went to Canada ended up as ANDREWS as well.

Both James and Uriah were in Sydney at the same time.

He's certainly causing a heap of trouble! :))

I always think of Uriah FRAMPTON after whom I believe Uriah ANDO was
named.  The FRAMPTON family were the village &quot;gentry&quot; and Uriah F was
the parish clerk for some time as well as either the verger or sexton.

ANDOW is what the branch of the family I'm connected to finally
became.

Some of the ANDOs may well be connected to Uriah because he's
distantly related to John CHANCELLOR who I was asking about in August
and more closely related to John HELLARD who also went to Australia
(in 1857 on the Mary Pleasants).

Uriah was initially sentenced to death for stealing 3 lambs, the
property of James CLOTHIER, but he didn't act alone.  His co-accused
was Joseph OSGOOD who was also found guilty and sentenced to death but
reprieved and transported for life.

He was a lucky bloke that he wasnt hung .    Some time ago I did some
research  into the transport 'Lonach' arr 1826 from Ireland .  Were
141 Irish convicts on board, 140  got life for stealing  sheep and odd
man out got caught stealing a horse
Some of these men had wives and children  Must have been devastating
for the people involved and a huge expense to the tax payer  . Say one
sheep was worth 1 pound , would have cost a great deal more that that
to prosecute the offender thru the courts...... Feed him in goal
,transport him to Cork City  or which ever port  , feed him for 3-4
months en route and support him in the Colony for a while

Either the loss was noticed by the shepherd or Uriah and Joseph were
spotted with the lambs.  If I can find the newspaper report of the
trial, I may learn what actually happened.

There were a lot of crimes which incurred the death penalty then and
earlier.

http://www.oldbaileyonline.org/ gives a record of a number of trials
and their verdicts.  Assault, theft, breaking the peace, forgery and
&quot;offences against the King&quot; all carried the death penalty.

Yes, he was lucky.

It was the principle of the matter that counted, rather than the
actual cost, although I agree it would have cost a lot more than the
value of the stolen items.

Justice was swift then as witness this account of Phineas RADFORD:

Phineas RADFORD, 28, 5'10&quot;, weight not given, dark complexion, dark
hair, grey eyes, stout made, b Lipold, Devon, Labourer, last abode
Walton nr Glastonbury, single, no known children, could read but not
write, Executed Apr 27 1825. Brought into custody 26 Mar 1825,
committed by M Blake MD on Dec 4, charged with the suspicion of
stealing 35 Ewes the property of William Gay, tried 26 Mar 1825 by Sir
JA Park and Sir James Burroughs Knights, verdict Guilty, Sentenced to
Death, executed 27 April 1825.

Some wives stayed behind, waited 7 years and after that time, they
could have their husband declared dead and legally remarry, if they
hadn't seen or heard from him in that time.  Tough if he then showed
up! &lt;G&gt;

Some committed crimes in order to join their husbands.

Some followed at their own expense.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Uriah was initially sentenced to death for stealing 3 lambs,

&gt;&gt; Good grief!  If only he'd known that he was going to be sent to Oz,
&gt;&gt; where it would be a rare sheep farmer who would be able to tell if
&gt;&gt; he'd lost 30 lambs let alone a miserable 3!  And to be sentenced to
&gt;&gt; death for it!

&gt; He was a lucky bloke that he wasnt hung .

Yes for the time he was probably lucky but I can never read the history of
some of these offences without thinking how horrific the sentences are.  I
know we aren't supposed to read history from a modern day perspective but I
can't stop myself. Someone tried to murder my husband and he did very little
time given the circumstances.

3 lambs, a few pocket handkerchiefs or the proverbial loaf of bread and the
sentences for such petty crimes were so farreaching.  It always amazes me
when I read details of the crimes and the punishments.

But there are indications that the syatem was specifically being used as a
means of providing cheap labour and residents for the new country.  It
really did work well as we didn't end up with a nation of criminals,
(despite what Americans say when they want to put down an Australian on
ngs - most of them don't even know that they received nearly as many
convicts as we did).

There were a few rogues but if we consider that we really ended up being a
nation of very law abiding people then I guess we can't complain about the
stock we were sent.  Perhaps it is more a reflection on the sort of
desperation that most of the (criminal as opposed to political) convicts
felt to resort to such crimes.

It's understandable that you would compare the two situations.  TBH, I
think we've gone too far the other way with sentencing.

The punishments do seem to be draconian but, as you say, there was an
apparent ulterior motive behind transportation.

I think you're right that it was, for the most part, desparation that
drove many to commit, what to us, seem to be minor crimes.  Who wants
to see their children starve for want of a loaf of bread?  By being
transported it gave many a new start which they made the most of.
