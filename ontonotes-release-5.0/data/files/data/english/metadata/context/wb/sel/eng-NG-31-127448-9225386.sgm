Despite the attempt by ID to present this debate as a scientific one, I
think for most of us Christians it comes down to defending our reading of
Genesis.  But are we reading it correctly?

I have written an article on how Augustine dealt with Genesis and it shows a
very humble, flexible approach that we can all learn from.  You can read it
here:

http://euangelion.wordpress.com/2007/08/28/how-should-we-read-genesis...

I would greatly appreciate your thoughts, either here or there.  That is a
Christian blog for Christians, however, so non-Christians can respond here.

Thanks!

Since you are a Darwinist this means you are not a Christian; rather,
it means that you think that you are a Christian. A Christian accepts
the evidence of the Biblical lineages that tell us that your alleged
Savior descended from the first man Adam; and real Christians know for
a fact that reality was produced directly by the Father of our Savior:
design indicates Creator.

Because you are a Darwinist this means you care about defending
evolution even to the point of denying that God created by special
creation in Genesis.

Just like I said: the call to corrupt the plain prose of Genesis and

I am glad your kind presupposes me not to be a Christian. The approval

As for your &quot;article&quot; it is very predictable as to what you will say
since you are a Darwinist and closet Atheist with one ulteror motive:
defend and promote evolution and corrupt your enemy the Bible. Real
Christians defend and promote the Bible and do not attempt to twist

So. Since Genesis does not actually mean what it clearly says,

A note to VBM: Ray declares everybody who disagrees with him to be a
Darwinist. (Or atheist; the terms are synonymous in his somewhat
fractured reality.)

On the other hand, I wouldn't worry too much about Ray's opinion of
YOUR adherence to Christ's doctrines, since Ray's theology is
decidedly, ah, NOVEL, from the point of view of most Christians.

That is begging the question that it &quot;clearly&quot; says what you think it
&quot;clearly&quot; says.

I think it is only a Modern (in the specific use of the term) mindset
presupposes a reading of Genesis 1 and 2 as strict literal historical
narrative.  Why would we make such a presumption, when that is not at all
how the orignal tellers of those stories, or the original hearers, would
have thought of them?

We can not impose our modernistic methods of telling about our past on
ancient texts and then call them out as &quot;in error&quot; based on that approach.

Then I stand corrected. Please accept my apologies.

Still, I'm not sure what you mean by &quot;overlay it with any naturalistic
philosophy.&quot; Science is dependent on methodological naturalism, only
because we can't figure out a way to test, measure, or quantify God.
But that's not the same as PHILOSOPHICAL naturalism, the argument that
nothing supernatural exists; most scientists have no trouble
reconciling science with their own religious beliefs.

If you want to look at it from a spiritual perspective, you could
fairly say that methodological naturalism is the admission that God is
inscrutable, and that miracles are not amenable to being stuffed in
test tubes.

None of it matters to Ray, though. From his point of view, you either
accept the entire Bible literally (except where otherwise noted by
Ray) or you're an atheist PRETENDING to be Christian.

Hi, Ray! I guess you forgot again that your attorney ordered you to
have no further contact with me because of your pending court case. I
really DO hope you weren't just making that up, but I'm beginning to
have my doubts; it's been a few months now and I haven't heard
anything from him.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; this means he is a full blooded evolutionist,
&gt; ready, willing and able, to shit on the Bible for the approval of the
&gt; secular world. Why can't TEists simply say the Bible is fucking wrong?
&gt; Answer: because they hate the Bible and Creationism so much they have
&gt; decided to corrupt what it says.
">

Another possible answer: Because they believe the Bible contains
profound spiritual truths, but was never intended as a textbook on the
physical sciences. Otherwise it would have included handy tips like
&quot;boil water before drinking it&quot; and &quot;here's how to forge a steel
sword,&quot; both of which would have been phenomenally useful for the
ancient Hebrews.

My answer is better supported by the evidence. It's also the answer
you're more likely to get when you ask theistic evolutionists.

Maybe you should stop, take a few deep breaths, and consider whether
you might conceivably be wrong about this. Is it at least
theoretically possible that theistic evolutionists are SINCERE in
their beliefs? That they DON'T hate the Bible?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Anyone who says Genesis does not

It depends on what you mean by &quot;special creation.&quot; Theistic
evolutionists (as well as adherents of just about every monotheistic
religion) DO believe that God created both the universe in general and
man specifically.

However, not all of them believe the story should be interpreted in
the literal sense, with God magicking a man into existence from clay.
The evidence simply doesn't point that way, so it forces one to
postulate a deity who deliberately plants false and misleading
evidence. Most Christians have serious theological objections to that
kind of trickster-god.

He doesn't deny it, he simply interprets it differently than you do.
That's not lying, that's diagreeing. Lying is when you make a
counterfactual statement with deliberate intent to deceive-- such as
claiming you can read a language when you can't.

A better question: Why should anyone trust you to interpret the Bible,
since you content that it contains deliberate heresy?

&gt; A note to VBM: Ray declares everybody who disagrees with him to be a
&gt; Darwinist. (Or atheist; the terms are synonymous in his somewhat
&gt; fractured reality.)

&gt; On the other hand, I wouldn't worry too much about Ray's opinion of
&gt; YOUR adherence to Christ's doctrines, since Ray's theology is
&gt; decidedly, ah, NOVEL, from the point of view of most Christians.

&gt; &gt; &gt; I think for most of us Christians it comes down to defending our reading of
&gt; &gt; &gt; Genesis.  But are we reading it correctly?

&gt; &gt; Since you are a Darwinist this means you are not a Christian; rather,
&gt; &gt; it means that you think that you are a Christian. A Christian accepts
&gt; &gt; the evidence of the Biblical lineages that tell us that your alleged
&gt; &gt; Savior descended from the first man Adam; and real Christians know for
&gt; &gt; a fact that reality was produced directly by the Father of our Savior:
&gt; &gt; design indicates Creator.

&gt; This is a false dichotomy. A &quot;Darwinist&quot; can believe that God created
&gt; the universe; in fact, many do.

&gt; &gt; Because you are a Darwinist this means you care about defending
&gt; &gt; evolution even to the point of denying that God created by special
&gt; &gt; creation in Genesis.

&gt; Uh, Ray... I don't think VBM accepts evolution. At least not in the

VBM is a TEist, Richard, this means he is a full blooded evolutionist,
ready, willing and able, to shit on the Bible for the approval of the
secular world. Why can't TEists simply say the Bible is fucking
wrong?
Answer: because they hate the Bible and Creationism so much they have
decided to corrupt what it says. Anyone who says Genesis does not say
special creation is the creating method of God is a liar and of
course, a Darwinist.

Objective persons know Genesis says reality was produced by God via
special creation; VBM simply shows what a brazen liar he is. Why would

Probably because you are clearly unable to credibly critique anything.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Uh, Ray... I don't think VBM accepts evolution. At least not in the

&gt; &gt; Actually, for the record, I do accept evolution entirely.  I just don't
&gt; &gt; overlay it with any naturalistic philosophy.  I simply accept that it is
the
&gt; &gt; way God created.

&gt; Then I stand corrected. Please accept my apologies.

&gt; Still, I'm not sure what you mean by &quot;overlay it with any naturalistic
&gt; philosophy.&quot; Science is dependent on methodological naturalism, only
&gt; because we can't figure out a way to test, measure, or quantify God.
&gt; But that's not the same as PHILOSOPHICAL naturalism, the argument that
&gt; nothing supernatural exists; most scientists have no trouble
&gt; reconciling science with their own religious beliefs.

&gt; If you want to look at it from a spiritual perspective, you could
&gt; fairly say that methodological naturalism is the admission that God is
&gt; inscrutable, and that miracles are not amenable to being stuffed in
&gt; test tubes.

&gt; None of it matters to Ray, though. From his point of view, you either
&gt; accept the entire Bible literally (except where otherwise noted by
&gt; Ray) or you're an atheist PRETENDING to be Christian.
">

Yes, I remember Ray in action, IIRC, the many years back when I was active
here.  So, I am not in the least interested in playing along with him.

But I definitely want to address your question, and no apologies are
necessary on your part, since it was an understandable presumption.

What I meant by such an overlay is that I don't hold to a naturalistic
philosophy, which I take to mean that, not only is the supernatural not able
to be studied and commented on by science (which MUST use methodological
naturalism), but that there IS no supernatural at all, as a categorical
conclusion.

I am in complete agreement with you regarding what science can do.  I think
science is merely the study of the natural world in its natural state.  To
the extent that God DOES intervene in His natural creation, science can not
say anything about it (other than as I discuss below).  At the same time, I
would oppose those who include a naturalistic philosophy in their scientific
presentations (ala Dawkins or Mayr), or at least clearly distinguish when
they are speaking as pure scientist, and when they are speaking outside of
science, drawing their own philosophical and theological conclusions, which
have nothing to do with science.  They have EVERY right to speak out on such
matters, but as scientists, I think it is incumbent upon them to make it
CLEAR when they go beyond just statements about the natural world.

The one area where I think science CAN speak to the issue of the
supernatural is when the evidence shows that a certain supernatural even did
NOT take place, as with the concept of a global flood.  But this is still
not speaking to the supernatural, per se, simply describing what the natural
evidence shows about whether a particular event did, or did not, occur.

&gt; &gt; &gt; overlay it with any naturalistic philosophy.  I simply accept that it is
&gt; the
&gt; &gt; &gt; way God created.

&gt; &gt; Then I stand corrected. Please accept my apologies.

&gt; &gt; Still, I'm not sure what you mean by &quot;overlay it with any naturalistic
&gt; &gt; philosophy.&quot; Science is dependent on methodological naturalism, only
&gt; &gt; because we can't figure out a way to test, measure, or quantify God.
&gt; &gt; But that's not the same as PHILOSOPHICAL naturalism, the argument that
&gt; &gt; nothing supernatural exists; most scientists have no trouble
&gt; &gt; reconciling science with their own religious beliefs.

&gt; &gt; If you want to look at it from a spiritual perspective, you could
&gt; &gt; fairly say that methodological naturalism is the admission that God is
&gt; &gt; inscrutable, and that miracles are not amenable to being stuffed in
&gt; &gt; test tubes.

&gt; &gt; None of it matters to Ray, though. From his point of view, you either
&gt; &gt; accept the entire Bible literally (except where otherwise noted by
&gt; &gt; Ray) or you're an atheist PRETENDING to be Christian.

&gt; Yes, I remember Ray in action, IIRC, the many years back when I was active
&gt; here.  So, I am not in the least interested in playing along with him.

Probably just as well. Most of the Christians I know feel deeply
insulted (justifiably, to my mind) when somebody else tells them
&quot;you're not REALLY a Christian!&quot;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; But I definitely want to address your question, and no apologies are
&gt; necessary on your part, since it was an understandable presumption.

&gt; What I meant by such an overlay is that I don't hold to a naturalistic
&gt; philosophy, which I take to mean that, not only is the supernatural not able
&gt; to be studied and commented on by science (which MUST use methodological
&gt; naturalism), but that there IS no supernatural at all, as a categorical
&gt; conclusion.
">

Ah, I see.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I am in complete agreement with you regarding what science can do.  I think
&gt; science is merely the study of the natural world in its natural state.  To
&gt; the extent that God DOES intervene in His natural creation, science can not
&gt; say anything about it (other than as I discuss below).  At the same time, I
&gt; would oppose those who include a naturalistic philosophy in their scientific
&gt; presentations (ala Dawkins or Mayr), or at least clearly distinguish when
&gt; they are speaking as pure scientist, and when they are speaking outside of
&gt; science, drawing their own philosophical and theological conclusions, which
&gt; have nothing to do with science.  They have EVERY right to speak out on such
&gt; matters, but as scientists, I think it is incumbent upon them to make it
&gt; CLEAR when they go beyond just statements about the natural world.
">

I agree. For what it's worth, I feel &quot;nothing supernatural exists&quot; is
a conclusion not adequately supported by the evidence. That would
require a way to plumb the absolute limits of not only what science
CAN know, but also what it CAN'T know-- and to KNOW you've covered all
of it to boot.

I share Dawkins's lack of belief in the supernatural, but not his
certainty that there isn't anything to believe IN. I remain open to
evidence-- I just haven't yet seen any that I consider persuasive. I
may yet have some kind of life-changing supernatural experience at
some point; that would actually be quite fascinating. (Well, unless
I'm devoured by Cthulhu or something. I'd just as soon pass on that.)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; The one area where I think science CAN speak to the issue of the
&gt; supernatural is when the evidence shows that a certain supernatural even did
&gt; NOT take place, as with the concept of a global flood.  But this is still
&gt; not speaking to the supernatural, per se, simply describing what the natural
&gt; evidence shows about whether a particular event did, or did not, occur.
">

True enough.

Thank you for expounding on your views more clearly. For what it's
worth, I disagree with nothing you've said.

reading
&gt; &gt; of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Genesis.  But are we reading it correctly?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I have written an article on how Augustine dealt with Genesis and it
&gt; &gt; shows a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; very humble, flexible approach that we can all learn from.  You can
read
&gt; &gt; it
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; here:

&gt; &gt; http://euangelion.wordpress.com/2007/08/28/how-should-we-read-genesis ...

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I would greatly appreciate your thoughts, either here or there.
That is
&gt; &gt; a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Christian blog for Christians, however, so non-Christians can
respond
&gt; &gt; here.

&gt; &gt; &gt; So. Since Genesis does not actually mean what it clearly says,
&gt; &gt; &gt; what does that say for the rest of the Bible?

&gt; &gt; That is begging the question that it &quot;clearly&quot; says what you think it
&gt; &gt; &quot;clearly&quot; says.

&gt; &gt; I think it is only a Modern (in the specific use of the term) mindset
&gt; &gt; presupposes a reading of Genesis 1 and 2 as strict literal historical
&gt; &gt; narrative.  Why would we make such a presumption, when that is not at
all
&gt; &gt; how the orignal tellers of those stories, or the original hearers, would
&gt; &gt; have thought of them?

&gt; &gt; We can not impose our modernistic methods of telling about our past on
&gt; &gt; ancient texts and then call them out as &quot;in error&quot; based on that
approach.

&gt; Does that apply to the New Testament as well? Can we assume Jesus
&gt; didn't float into the sky or rise from the dead?
">

No, because the New Testament was written much later, at at time when
something more akin to modern history was being written (ie, post-Herodotus,
et al).  Not to say that the Gospels were meant to be strict history in the
exact same sense as we think of it today, but those writers were making
historical claims, and were not using figurative, symbolic or typological
language (other than maybe John in some areas).  The genre and
cultural/historical setting can inform us in these areas.

Our Atheist plainly admitting that he agrees with everything said by
the &quot;Christian&quot; (VBM).

Invulnerable logic says that the Atheist would never agree with a real
or true Christian; therefore, VBM, of course, is not a real or true
Christian. He is, of course, a Darwinist, like our Atheist. They see
eye to eye on everything concerning origins.

What kind of crazy mixed up world do we live when no one has the
***objective*** ability to see that there is something wrong when a
Christian and Atheist agree on origins?

Objective persons know that in this particular case the Christian
cannot be a real Christian, that is, antonyms do not agree, but since
they do one is not genuinely as such. Like I said upthread: VBM
***thinks*** he is a Christian. The Bible explains the VBMs of this
world the same way it explained Judas the Betrayer: Jesus said He
chose Judas knowing he was a son of the devil from the beginning (John
chp.6).

VBM, like Judas, is deceived: the essence of being deceived is that
you ***think*** that you are all right with God - but you are not.

One section I found quite notable:  &quot;As for the material truth, there
is nothing wrong with accepting this as well, unless and until there
is evidence which shows that it can not be the true reading. When that
happens, we know that the material interpretation was never part of
Scripture to begin with.&quot;  (Hence, &quot;truth cannot contradict truth.&quot;)

This is something that is apparently too esoteric for many Fundy/

contrary to their existing belief, they come unglued.

But for me it raises another question concerning Protestant
denominations (if they can even be roughly grouped as such).  The RCC
has quite a bit of material (such as from Augustine) from many
hundreds of years ago.  Much of RCC belief is based on that old
material, and the philosophical ideas they raised.  I'm curious how
much of that material is accepted, or even known, within different
Protestant denominations?

The reason I'm curious is that, in my experience, many creationists
know as little about Christianity as they do about science.  Did they
not study in Bible class either?  Did they have &quot;bargain basement&quot;
preachers who flunked their philosophy finals, if they went to college

I don't recall anyone empowering you to decide who is and who is not a

scholarship and possibly stronger claims to sanity who claim that one
has to accept the Biblical  teaching of a young Earth to be a real
Christian.  There are people, like Gerardus Bouw, who are as bright as
you and claim that to be a real Christian, one has to reject
Copernicanism and its denial of the clear statements of the Bible that
the sun orbits the Earth.

&quot;Design indicates Creator&quot; is, I think, not the point of Romans 1:20
(the point of which is the obviousness of the moral law, not the
obviousness of special creation or &quot;design&quot;), much less Hebrews 11:3
(which states that &quot;by faith&quot; -- as opposed, presumably, to scientific
evidence -- Christians know that God is Creator).

Again, the &quot;plain prose of Genesis&quot; implies that the sky is a solid
dome with hatches in it, that the sun circles the Earth (inside the
dome of the sky), and that breeding animals in front of striped and
spotted sticks increases the chances of their bearing striped and
spotted offspring.  You corrupt the plain prose every time you
compromise with Copernicanism or Mendellianism.  Or perhaps, on these

I think you can say precisely the same thing of a lot of the OT, as well.
Such claims as the Exodus were clearly accepted as actual historical events,
despite the now obvious total lack of evidence surrounding any of the Moses
story.

&gt;&gt; &gt; Since you are a Darwinist this means you are not a Christian; rather,
&gt;&gt; &gt; it means that you think that you are a Christian. A Christian accepts
&gt;&gt; &gt; the evidence of the Biblical lineages that tell us that your alleged

&gt;&gt; &gt; design indicates Creator.

&gt;&gt; This is a false dichotomy. A &quot;Darwinist&quot; can believe that God created
&gt;&gt; the universe; in fact, many do.

&gt;&gt; &gt; Because you are a Darwinist this means you care about defending
&gt;&gt; &gt; evolution even to the point of denying that God created by special
&gt;&gt; &gt; creation in Genesis.

&gt;&gt; Uh, Ray... I don't think VBM accepts evolution. At least not in the
&gt;&gt; conventional sense.

&gt; VBM is a TEist, Richard, this means he is a full blooded evolutionist,
&gt; ready, willing and able, to shit on the Bible for the approval of the
&gt; secular world. Why can't TEists simply say the Bible is fucking
&gt; wrong?
&gt; Answer: because they hate the Bible and Creationism so much they have
&gt; decided to corrupt what it says. Anyone who says Genesis does not say
&gt; special creation is the creating method of God is a liar and of
&gt; course, a Darwinist.

&gt; Objective persons know Genesis says reality was produced by God via
&gt; special creation; VBM simply shows what a brazen liar he is. Why would
&gt; anyone take the time to read what VBM has to say since he denies the
&gt; prose of Genesis? It is very simple: Genesis is either true or false.
&gt; Since the entire Creation-Evolution debate is built on the fact that
&gt; Genesis says special creation, TEists are attempting corruption,
&gt; confirmed by the fact that no Atheist ever jumps in and says what I

&gt;&gt; I agree. For what it's worth, I feel &quot;nothing supernatural exists&quot; is
&gt;&gt; a conclusion not adequately supported by the evidence. That would
&gt;&gt; require a way to plumb the absolute limits of not only what science
&gt;&gt; CAN know, but also what it CAN'T know-- and to KNOW you've covered all
&gt;&gt; of it to boot.

&gt; Here we have a declared Atheist and our &quot;Christian&quot; TEist (VBM) brown
&gt; nosing each other in perfect agreement.
">

But the point on which VBM and I agree is that &quot;nothing supernatural
exists&quot; is a conclusion not adequately supported by the evidence. Don't
you agree with that, Ray? Or do YOU believe that nothing supernatural
exists?

&gt;&gt; I share Dawkins's lack of belief in the supernatural, but not his

&gt;&gt; evidence-- I just haven't yet seen any that I consider persuasive. I
&gt;&gt; may yet have some kind of life-changing supernatural experience at
&gt;&gt; some point; that would actually be quite fascinating. (Well, unless
&gt;&gt; I'm devoured by Cthulhu or something. I'd just as soon pass on that.)

&gt;&gt;&gt; The one area where I think science CAN speak to the issue of the
&gt;&gt;&gt; supernatural is when the evidence shows that a certain supernatural even did
&gt;&gt;&gt; NOT take place, as with the concept of a global flood.  But this is still
&gt;&gt;&gt; not speaking to the supernatural, per se, simply describing what the natural
&gt;&gt;&gt; evidence shows about whether a particular event did, or did not, occur.
&gt;&gt; True enough.

Yup.

&gt; What kind of crazy mixed up world do we live when no one has the

&gt; Christian and Atheist agree on origins?

Ummmm... actually, VBM and I weren't discussing origins; we were
discussing the epistemological limits of methodological naturalism.

Did you even bother reading the post in detail before you began
composing your next spittle-flecked missive?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Objective persons know that in this particular case the Christian
&gt; cannot be a real Christian, that is, antonyms do not agree, but since
&gt; they do one is not genuinely as such. Like I said upthread: VBM
&gt; ***thinks*** he is a Christian. The Bible explains the VBMs of this
&gt; world the same way it explained Judas the Betrayer: Jesus said He
&gt; chose Judas knowing he was a son of the devil from the beginning (John
&gt; chp.6).

So a person can sincerely believe he's Christian, but be wrong? How do
you know that YOU aren't wrong?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; VBM, like Judas, is deceived: the essence of being deceived is that
&gt; you ***think*** that you are all right with God - but you are not.
&gt; This is the only explanation as to how and why an Atheist and a
&gt; &quot;Christian&quot; could agree on origins.

But YOU think you're &quot;all right with God&quot;-- how do you know you're not
wrong? Why are your theological views on origins more authoritative than
the Anglican or Catholic Churches?

Ray claims that the Pope lies about what he REALLY believes and is

&gt; &gt;&gt; So. Since Genesis does not actually mean what it clearly says,
&gt; &gt;&gt; what does that say for the rest of the Bible?

&gt; &gt; That is begging the question that it &quot;clearly&quot; says what you think it
&gt; &gt; &quot;clearly&quot; says.

&gt; &gt; I think it is only a Modern (in the specific use of the term) mindset

&gt; &gt; narrative.  Why would we make such a presumption, when that is not at
all
&gt; &gt; how the orignal tellers of those stories, or the original hearers, would
&gt; &gt; have thought of them?

&gt; I would imagine the original formulators of the cosmography did indeed
&gt; believe it.

&gt; &gt; We can not impose our modernistic methods of telling about our past on
&gt; &gt; ancient texts and then call them out as &quot;in error&quot; based on that
approach.

&gt; I think, assuming that the ancient Bronze Age Hebrews did believe that the
&gt; world was dish-shaped, and that the sun, moon and stars were set in a
&gt; crystal dome, and that there was a global flood that wiped out just about
&gt; everything, we can safely say they were wrong.  Nothing wrong with that.
&gt; Lots of ancient peoples were wrong.
">

No, actually, while the ancient Israelites would definitely might have
believed those very things (or other things just as wrong) about science,
and obviosly DID write their origins stories using those motifs and details,
that does not mean that they considered them true historically.  They just
didn't think about it that way, and they definitely did not write about
their past that way.   There is a reason why they call Herodotus the &quot;father
of history&quot;.  It is because people were simply not attempting to write about
their past in that way prior to that time, and definitely not in the time
the Genesis creation stories were first told and first written.   The first
hearer would not have thought of those stories as strict literal narrative
history.  They would have thought they were TRUE, yes, but not in the same
way we read history today.

&gt; &gt; No, because the New Testament was written much later, at at time when
&gt; &gt; something more akin to modern history was being written (ie,
post-Herodotus,
&gt; &gt; et al).

&gt; Then that produces its own problems.  The consistency of the Gospels in
&gt; places is obviously faulty.

True, I said they were attempting to write history, and with general
attempts at accuracy, but I did not say they were entirely successful at
that! :)

And, &quot;generally accurate&quot; in major points is not the same as absolutely
accurate in every detail.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt;  Not to say that the Gospels were meant to be strict history in the
&gt; &gt; exact same sense as we think of it today, but those writers were making
&gt; &gt; historical claims, and were not using figurative, symbolic or
typological
&gt; &gt; language (other than maybe John in some areas).  The genre and
&gt; &gt; cultural/historical setting can inform us in these areas.
&gt; I think you can say precisely the same thing of a lot of the OT, as well.
&gt; Such claims as the Exodus were clearly accepted as actual historical
events,
&gt; despite the now obvious total lack of evidence surrounding any of the
Moses
&gt; story.

Ah, but you are conflating the Creation stories and the Exodus stories,
which are not the same type of literature at all, and then starting a
different discussion altogether, which is the &quot;evidence for the Exodus&quot;
argument.
