Hi Everyone!

Sorry it's been so long, but figured it's about time I updated everyone
on what's been going on!

Also wanted to take the time to thank all of you for your incredible
support and prayers---they have meant the world and have helped me get
through what has been a bit of a trying and stressful time.

As many of you know, during my last hospital stay, my lung doctor
started doing a bit of testing to try to figure out why I have been
getting so sick so often. He just didn't feel like I should be getting
so sick so often and it has become harder and harder to clear those
infections. Thus his looking into things a bit further.

Turns out, that I have almost no immune system to speak of. Besides
retesting my IGg, IGa, and IGm levels, the specialist I saw tested for T
cells, B cells, antibodies to several things including a few different
types of pneumonia. One of the types of pneumonia (s. pneumonia has like
15 subtypes and on every single one of them, the normal range should be

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; 1.0 and my levels were &lt; 0.2 --- yikes! On something else that was
">

tested, the levels were supposed to be 100-560 and my level was less
than 5!  So, just this past week, I was given the official diagnosis of
CVID (common variable immuno- deficiency).

The best way to treat this condition is by getting regular monthly
infusions of IVIG for the rest of your life. The specialist wants to get
these infusions started as soon as possible, so am scheduled to start
the infusions at the end of october. Of course, this all hinges on what
the financial coverage is for the infusions.   Since this will be
something that I have to deal with for the rest of my life, I am still
waiting to hear about financial coverage/help,  especially long term,
for all of this.   The infusions would be two days each month.

Am also scheduled to get a port put in my chest wall on thursday for
these treatments. Oh joy!

Think I am way way past the 3 disease limit these days! LOL!!!

It's all a bit overwhelming to me and though the infusions of the IVIG
are supposed to help me in the long run get less infections and the
infections I do get should be easier to treat, the infusions are not
without their own set of risks, including the possibility of making my
rheumatoid worse, because it is made from components of blood products,
the possibility of getting hepatitis C or some other blood born illness,
etc. Not to mention the side effects (chest pains/tightness, nausea,
headache, body/joint pain, etc) of each set of infusions.   Don't know
whether to be happy or not at this point.

My pcp said, let's just take it one step at a time and see how it all
works out.   He said he does have some concerns himself, but also said
I am the first patient he has ever had that has been diagnosed with this
problem, so isn't all that familiar with the condition or the treatment.
LOL, told him I'm sure I have been his first for several things!!!
He just laughed!!!

Thank God for wonderful doctors who are so willing to talk all this
through with me and who are honest yet encouraging!!!

I'm still kind of trying to process it all, but also trying not to get
too worked up about any of it until I know that this treatment is even
going to be an option for me financially.

The specialist did say that after looking at my bloodwork, that she
thinks this is something that has been going on for a very very long
time with me and that when I was diagnosed with the RA and put on some
of the heavier dmards, that that just added to the problems.   This
CVID may have even been something that was inherited.

They've already made sure I got my flu shot to try to protect me as best
as possible.

Am due for my rituxan infusion as well, but the RD has pushed that
infusion back until I can get the IVIG infusions. He said that really
needed to take first priority.   Grrrrr-----I want my rituxan as my RA
is screaming that it is more than past due!

Just got over another infection that hit just 3 weeks after my last
hospital stay in sept.     As has been the case lately, it took
several rounds of antibiotics to clear it up and in the mean time flared
my breathing issues up.   My pcp wanted to admit me again, but I told
him I'd like to try to manage it at home. As luck would have it, he was
on call that weekend, so was willing to let me go home with the
understanding that if things got any worse at all, that I was to head
straight for the hospital and let him know.   Ended up I was able to
avoid being hospitalized, but it took a long long time to clear it all
up and my poor pcp was literally seeing me in his office about every
other day or so. Did finally clear it though and then ended up with a
pretty nasty yeast infection which I am just getting cleared up now.

Whew, what a ride it has been and I'm afraid I have been so sick and so
self absorbed, that I just didn't have it in me to be very supportive to
anyone else and didn't feel like anyone else needed to listen to my
whining, thus my disappearance from the group for awhile!

Kelly E. has been such an amazing angel checking up on me and she did
forward to me all of your prayers, well wishes, and even the little
lectures! LOL---God bless you all for your care and concern and for
taking the time to tell me like it is!!!   I know I needed to hear
some of that and of course, the prayers are so precious and are truly
what carry me through at times!!!
I hope each of you knows how very precious you all are to me!!!

Am working at getting my act back together and hopefully can rejoin the
gang a little more regularly sometime soon!

Appreciate all the prayers thus far, and appreciate the continued
prayers that this will all work out in what ever way is best!!!
Hugs and prayers to all of you for pain free healthier days!!!

Hi Donna,,,,, Someone once told me that my RA is not what will kill me but
it may cause something else to do the job.    You are in a D** if you do and
D**ed if you don't type deal.   I can only say what I would do in this case
for myself,,,,,,,stop the dmards and start prednisone and maybe  Naprosyn
until your immune system comes back.   When your immune system comes back,
start DMARDs.    Pred. and Nap. both are hard on your insides and must be
taken with food and atleast 2 hours before bedtime.  There are so many
people here that care about you and have you in our thoughts and prayers
which means that this must be updated.

Donna,
I'm so sorry you are going through more problems with your health.  It
hasn't been at all good for you lately, but hopefully you will turn a
corner soon.   I tend to think your PCP has the right idea to go along
with it and see what happens.  I hope the insurance will end up taking
care of the cost of the infusions.  I wish someone would tell us the
ideal insurance policy that would take care of all of our meds and
treatments so we wouldn't have so much stress  about money.  You will
remain in my daily prayers.

Donna, the important thing is for you to do what you can to help yourself
get rid of the problem.  If this treatment will work, I'll be praying that
the financial part will fall into place and you can get started right away.
You have had too many people's share of health problems; it is past time for
them to go away so you can really feel good for a change.  That will also be
in my prayers.  Please don't be concerned about not supporting others; we
just want you to do what's best for you.
Gwen

Sorry I haven't gotten to the newsgroups for a few days now.  You have been
in all our prayers.  I had a portacath put in for treatment of cryptococcal
sinusitis - six weeks of daily IVs for two hours.  The only bad part was
after the portacath was put in and the home nurse came out to access it.
The only solution that time is to grit your teeth and bear it.  It didn't
take long but was very painful.  After that it was so easy to do the IVs.
My cat loved to watch the few bubbles go up the tube!  He did learn not to
touch the tubes, although I would see his paw twitch just a bit!  LOL

Hange in there Donna, we are all thinking of you.

for all of this. The infusions would be two days each month.

Am also scheduled to get a port put in my chest wall on thursday for
these treatments. Oh joy!

Think I am way way past the 3 disease limit these days! LOL!!!

It's all a bit overwhelming to me and though the infusions of the IVIG
are supposed to help me in the long run get less infections and the
infections I do get should be easier to treat, the infusions are not
without their own set of risks, including the possibility of making my
rheumatoid worse, because it is made from components of blood products,
the possibility of getting hepatitis C or some other blood born illness,
etc. Not to mention the side effects (chest pains/tightness, nausea,
headache, body/joint pain, etc) of each set of infusions. Don't know
whether to be happy or not at this point.

My pcp said, let's just take it one step at a time and see how it all
works out. He said he does have some concerns himself, but also said
I am the first patient he has ever had that has been diagnosed with this
problem, so isn't all that familiar with the condition or the treatment.
LOL, told him I'm sure I have been his first for several things!!!
He just laughed!!!

Thank God for wonderful doctors who are so willing to talk all this
through with me and who are honest yet encouraging!!!

I'm still kind of trying to process it all, but also trying not to get
too worked up about any of it until I know that this treatment is even
going to be an option for me financially.

The specialist did say that after looking at my bloodwork, that she
thinks this is something that has been going on for a very very long
time with me and that when I was diagnosed with the RA and put on some
of the heavier dmards, that that just added to the problems. This
CVID may have even been something that was inherited.

They've already made sure I got my flu shot to try to protect me as best
as possible.

Am due for my rituxan infusion as well, but the RD has pushed that
infusion back until I can get the IVIG infusions. He said that really
needed to take first priority. Grrrrr-----I want my rituxan as my RA
is screaming that it is more than past due!

Just got over another infection that hit just 3 weeks after my last
hospital stay in sept. As has been the case lately, it took
several rounds of antibiotics to clear it up and in the mean time flared
my breathing issues up. My pcp wanted to admit me again, but I told
him I'd like to try to manage it at home. As luck would have it, he was
on call that weekend, so was willing to let me go home with the
understanding that if things got any worse at all, that I was to head
straight for the hospital and let him know. Ended up I was able to
avoid being hospitalized, but it took a long long time to clear it all
up and my poor pcp was literally seeing me in his office about every
other day or so. Did finally clear it though and then ended up with a
pretty nasty yeast infection which I am just getting cleared up now.

Whew, what a ride it has been and I'm afraid I have been so sick and so
self absorbed, that I just didn't have it in me to be very supportive to
anyone else and didn't feel like anyone else needed to listen to my
whining, thus my disappearance from the group for awhile!

Kelly E. has been such an amazing angel checking up on me and she did
forward to me all of your prayers, well wishes, and even the little
lectures! LOL---God bless you all for your care and concern and for
taking the time to tell me like it is!!! I know I needed to hear
some of that and of course, the prayers are so precious and are truly
what carry me through at times!!!
I hope each of you knows how very precious you all are to me!!!

Am working at getting my act back together and hopefully can rejoin the
gang a little more regularly sometime soon!

Appreciate all the prayers thus far, and appreciate the continued
prayers that this will all work out in what ever way is best!!!
Hugs and prayers to all of you for pain free healthier days!!!

Thanks, Harv, I really appreciate your prayers and good wishes.

Unfortunately, stopping the dmards is really not an option as my RA
tends to be rather agressive in attacking my organs and I just can't
afford to have anything else with the health come up right now.  The
dmards have to stay, and the doctors are working with each other to try
to use the best possible dmards for my situation. The immune stuff has
been going on for a way long time before the RA was ever even diagnosed,
so it is just a matter of trying to get that component of it under
better control.  Besides, I'm really not supposed to do nsaids and the
pred causes just as much problem, if not more, than the dmards do.

Hope you are doing well and doing ok these days on your regimen!

Hugs,

Donna

Loujean,

Was the port really painful to access each and every time, or just when
you first got it put in and until it healed?   Even if it is rather
painful all the time, I guess it is better than getting stuck over and
over and over again, which is what usually happens even when I am just
getting blood drawn.   I have horrible access.

Appreciate your sharing your experiences with me, they really help.

Hugs,

Donna

Ohhh, I wish I knew more.   I do not understand how your immune system could
be so down that your lungs, sinuses,ect,ect. are in trouble because of a
lack of immune system to take care of them,,,,, but your RA marches on into
a uncontrolled state which is our immune system turning on ourselves.  If
you ever get one of your doctors to explain that,,,, please tell us.

Donna,

My mom had Emla cream (or something similar) to put on the skin over her
port for when she had chemo or blood draws. It's an anesthetic cream, like
they use for putting in sutures. She put it on an hour before there was to
be an infusion or draw and covered it with gauze. Not sure whether that's
just a chemo thing, the procedure at the center she went to, or what. But it
certainly made it more comfortable.

Hoping these infusions help!!!!

Donna,

You are always in my prayers and thoughts.

I feel for you with all that you are going thru. I wish there was something
that could be done and fixed quickly to make you so much better.

I hope the infusions work quickly so that your immune system starts working
again.

I imagine a port would be better than having them prick you all the time.

I hope you get thru the infusions ok without the possibilities you listed
below.

Yes, thank God for wonderful drs. that are willing to talk with you and be
honest and encouraging.

I feel for you with not being able to get the rituxan infusion.

I sure hope this all works for you and that the infections stay away for
good now. I hope the yeast beastie leaves quickly too.

Donna, we do understand when you are not up to being here and being
supportive, now get that thought out of your head. We can't be up and
supportive all the time, if we were we wouldn't be here now would we. ;-)

Do not disappear from the group for this at all. Yeah it is ok to disappear
if you don't feel  up to it, but let us know why. We do worry about you. We
care about and love you very much.

You take care and I hope to hear soon that you are doing much better. But if
you can't tell us that for awhile , then tell us how you are doing.

Love and Hugs to all

Hi Everyone!

Sorry it's been so long, but figured it's about time I updated everyone
on what's been going on!

Also wanted to take the time to thank all of you for your incredible
support and prayers---they have meant the world and have helped me get
through what has been a bit of a trying and stressful time.

As many of you know, during my last hospital stay, my lung doctor
started doing a bit of testing to try to figure out why I have been
getting so sick so often. He just didn't feel like I should be getting
so sick so often and it has become harder and harder to clear those
infections. Thus his looking into things a bit further.

Turns out, that I have almost no immune system to speak of. Besides
retesting my IGg, IGa, and IGm levels, the specialist I saw tested for T
cells, B cells, antibodies to several things including a few different
types of pneumonia. One of the types of pneumonia (s. pneumonia has like
15 subtypes and on every single one of them, the normal range should be

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; 1.0 and my levels were &lt; 0.2 --- yikes! On something else that was
">

tested, the levels were supposed to be 100-560 and my level was less
than 5!  So, just this past week, I was given the official diagnosis of
CVID (common variable immuno- deficiency).

The best way to treat this condition is by getting regular monthly
infusions of IVIG for the rest of your life. The specialist wants to get
these infusions started as soon as possible, so am scheduled to start
the infusions at the end of october. Of course, this all hinges on what
the financial coverage is for the infusions. Since this will be
something that I have to deal with for the rest of my life, I am still
waiting to hear about financial coverage/help,  especially long term,
for all of this. The infusions would be two days each month.

Hi Donna,
Yiu are in my thoughts and prayers. I hate hearing that  you have to
deal with another serious problem. I wonder how this immune disorder
does affect your RA. It will be interesting to see if there is any
change once your immunity is boosted. You can see how the DMARDs would
act to further limit your immunity and I would think that some DMARDs
would automatically be out. Since many of the new DMARDs are targeted
toward specific cells it may not be as bad though. We will have to see
what the docs say on that matter. I am not sure how rituxan works, but
I hope that you can continue if it helps the RA.
Please remember we are here for you and never be afraid that you are
whining. I bet that thought has not ever crossed anyone's mind.

((((((((((((((((((((((Donna))))))))))))))))))))))))

I read the link you gave us. I wonder if some of the damage to your joints
and your internal organs that's been attributed to your RA might actually be
the result of the CVID.  I'm crossing my fingers and saying my prayers for
you somehow getting coverage for the infusions and treatment showing this
will cover more of your problems than expected!  Hopefully you won't get the
side effects and they will cover any pains you suffer through this.

I forget if this incredible rain we've been having up here is stretching into
the southern part of the state.  I'm hoping it isn't, or that it's cool
enough for you to turn on the heat and cook out some of the humidity.  You
truly don't need that playing havoc with your lungs right now and messing up
the scheduled first infusion.

Reading about CVID leaves me even more curious about the results of my repeat
IGG to see if it's recovered post-Enbrel and about the testing to check my
response to the pneumonia vaccine last spring.  Don't remember ever hearing
about hte latter, though it's been hard to keep track.  Depending on whether
the hypogammaglobulinemia has resolved without the Enbrel, a mild version of
this may have been part of what's been going on with me.  Time for more
inquiries at my next appointment.  I don't want to reach the point of
competing with you on severity of this condition.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

that is a real blessing, indeed.  Even more so with them willing to discuss
things with each other and work out the best way to treat you.  It is so hard
to take care of yourself when you feel like crap and it's great that you
don't have to &quot;manage&quot; your doctors on ops of things.  (heh, my *doctors* are
great, but I've really been having to &quot;manage&quot; my surgeon's nurse.  She's
simply clueless and seems to see me as even more clueless.  the doc and I are
able to talk straight to each other, though.)

you know that we don't mind you needing to focus on yourself for a while and
we more than understand about the need to work on your own health and even to
whine.  But at the same time, I know all of us who are accustomed to coping
with stuff understand wanting *not* to whine and wanting *not* to be so
focused on yourself.  When we are really sick, we so crave the ability to
once again be the people when are when we are less sick (realizing that most
of us here are never really *well*).  So, do what you have to do, but stay in
touch with someone so we know what's going on with you.  You know we care and
we worry.

Nann,

You know, when I first read the link I posted, which is basically the
same thing that the specialist gave me in a printed out format, I
immediately thought of you!  In fact, after reading about the
enlarged/inflammed lymph nodes and such in the abdominal cavity, with
the occassional bouts of nausea and such, I almost came home and called
you.  A number of the symptoms really seem to fit what you have been
dealing with, and one can't help but wonder if this is what you are
dealing with and the doctors are missing the diagnosis.   It's
definitely worth checking into.  Perhaps even worth printing out the
link and taking it with you the next time you see your doctors!!!

Sure praying that they can get things sorted out soon for you and get
you feeling back to some semblance of normal!!!

Hugs,

Donna

I recall one of the tests my RD ran last spring was to check my body's
response to the pneumonia vaccine and the site mentioned low antibodies in
response to vacines as one marker of CVID.  I wonder if that's where he was
going.  I don't recall what the results were though. I'll find out more on my
next visit, when I'll feel better than I did last time.  As much as I hate
you going through what you are, I'll be grateful if it helps us pinpoint
what's up with me!

Nann,

Wouldn't that be something if you end up going in there and asking them
to check a few things and arrive at your own diagnosis?    Mine journey
started with them drawing the IGG, IGA, IGM, and IGE levels.   When 3
out of the 4 showed quite low, that is when they really started
investigating.

Would love it any of this could help them get things figured out for
you!

BTW, what really seemed to tip me over the edge, especially infection
wise, was when I was on the enbrel.  The enbrel worked wonders for me
with my RA, but really set  me off in a downward spiral with the numbers
and severity of infections.

I have to admit that the enbrel tipped me too for infections and I have
followed this very very closely!  I finish 3 months of antibiotics next week
for the constant bladder infections. If they occur after I am going to
scream!  One after another since enbrel.  The sinus infections are down a
bit - I never ever had those before enbrel and while on enbrel they were
constant.  Always wondered if the infections and the stopping and starting
etc. was part of the whole reaction thing I had.  Will never know what
happened there.

I do wish Diane W was still here too to discuss this.  The enbrel was sort
of off label for her as she had the MS too but she got infection after
infection on it and was on IVIG.  I need to go back in the archives and see
what it was they decided she had - I know her son was being genetically
tested to see if he had it too and he really didn't want to know (that age -
you know the 19 year old thing - no symptoms though).

I was going to add Donna - I am sure the rituxan is finally starting to
work.  Two incredible days without huge pain and I have been doing so much
running around.  Because my wrists have been painful I have not been even
using my cane as much and have not used my scooter (even though a couple of
times I could have used it).  Even with the moving thing = well no
painkillers.  So I think it has started to kick in.  Would be so nice.  This
is 5 months.  Wasn't looking for it so will see - the rd figured it would
take 6 - 7 months since I am so &quot;different&quot;. Oh and bonus the neurological
pain has been reduced.  Real bonus and they have reported that in some
articles on the internet.  So will see.  We are talking reduced by the way -
pain level from 8 - 9 a day out of 10 last week to 7 this week. Fingers
crossed.  I will take 7 on a steady basis.  Do I hear 6 - sold to the
highest bidder!

Nann - it would be interesting to know if they recommend IVIG.  The reading
are interesting on this.

Kelly, am so excited to hear that the rituxan is starting to kick in a
bit.  If you're like me, it was a very gradual slow process of kicking
in and it did take a good 5-7 months before it felt like it really
kicked in completely.  I still don't think it is as good as the enbrel
for me and my RA, but the enbrel just caused way way too many problems.

Might behoove you to have your immunoglobulin levels checked too.  Maybe
you and Nann both have a component of this cvid.  I'm beginning to
wonder if more people (especially with RA) might not have varying
degrees of cvid and not even be aware of it.

Just takes some blood work to check into it, so may be worth checking
out.

Am also soooo excited for you that you are moving into the new house!!!
Wooooohoooooooo!!!   Can't wait to see pics!   Pace yourself, though,
and please, please don't overdo!!!

Hugs,

Donna

Kelly,

I sure hope you are over that bladder infection stuff. Oh man that is a long
time to be battleing it. I don't blame you for screaming if it reoccurs.

I sure hope your rituxan is kicking in finally. I have my fingers crossed
and that hurts. ;-)
I sure hope it is helping with the neurological stuff too. That would be a
bonus. ;-)

Love and Hugs to all

They only have to access it once.  Then they put in a tube with a port on
the end.  After I was through using it, they removed in under anesthesia.
It wasn't bad healing, if I remember.  I agree than a portacath is much
better than getting stuck every day.  I even had one vein collapse - boy,
did that hurt - until I had the portacath put in.  The visiting nurse would
use the portacath to withdraw the weekly blood samples for testing for liver
damage, etc, from the medication.  It all turned out well at the end.
Unfortunately, there isn't an end with arthritis.  I think I was very
fortunate as they got a medication that worked before I got too bad.  It's
still there, but at least it is in check for right now.

&gt; Loujean,

&gt; Was the port really painful to access each and every time, or just when
&gt; you first got it put in and until it healed?   Even if it is rather
&gt; painful all the time, I guess it is better than getting stuck over and
&gt; over and over again, which is what usually happens even when I am just
&gt; getting blood drawn.   I have horrible access.

&gt; Appreciate your sharing your experiences with me, they really help.

&gt; Hugs,

&gt; Donna

Hi, Donna.  It's just wonderful that your poor beat up immune system
is going to get an assist.  I'm sure hoping and praying this is going
to make a world of difference for you.

I'm probably going to have a port soon myself.  Not for the same
reason, though.  They are having a really  hard time getting stuff OUT
of me!  I love being backwards.  I guess that means I should have a
starboard put in...  (The  '...'  means I technically did NOT end the
previous sentence with a preposition.)

Happy to see you again,
Denise

&gt; Hi Everyone!

&gt; Sorry it's been so long, but figured it's about time I updated everyone
&gt; on what's been going on!

&gt; Also wanted to take the time to thank all of you for your incredible
&gt; support and prayers---they have meant the world and have helped me get
&gt; through what has been a bit of a trying and stressful time.

&gt; As many of you know, during my last hospital stay, my lung doctor
&gt; started doing a bit of testing to try to figure out why I have been
&gt; getting so sick so often. He just didn't feel like I should be getting
&gt; so sick so often and it has become harder and harder to clear those
&gt; infections. Thus his looking into things a bit further.
