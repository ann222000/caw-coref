I was wondering, if anyone knew an exact date or perhaps knows when
the shakespeare authorship first began.. not the theories as such, but
how long after shakespeare death did the questions arise and why did
people only after his death begin to question the authorship? I cant
seem to find any information on this, maybe because im not looking for
it correctly, but all that ive found is the dates where theorist have
suggestion their opinions as to who wrote the works. Or is there no
information because no one knows when they all really began?

So if anyone knows any good articles online for me to have a look at,
or just anything would be greatly appreciated.

Thankyou :)

I can't remember his name now, but I believe the first anti-Stratfordian was
a local antiquarian who in the late eighteenth century travelled the
Stratford area in search of Shakespeare. He turned up almost nothing.and
concluded that someone else had written the works. So, anti-Stratfordianism
dates from about a century and a half after Shakespeare's death.

It began in the 1550s before Ned Vere was ten,
and showed such talent that his work had to be
published, yet it could not come under over his

We don't know when he adopted the pseudonym
of 'Will Shake-speare'; it could have been before
1565, or as late as 1580.

From the time De Vere first published, both
anonymously or under another name, people
would have been asking: 'who wrote this?' or
'who really wrote this?' But the 'public', (i.e. the

only some time after the Folio came out in 1623.

Your problem is mainly in your question.
It's like asking when did people start to
doubt the Piltdown fraud or when did they
start to question the accuracy of Archbishop
Usher's calculation. The answer is that well-
informed, intelligent people did so from the
first instant. But often they kept quiet,
because there were a lot of foolish people
in positions of authority who would have
felt that such questions were impertinent.

Are you so wrapped up in your own crackpottery that you can't even read a

_Two Shakespeares_ by Scott McCrea (Skeptic Magazine)

&lt;&lt;About 1785, THE REVEREND JAMES WILMOT,
the rector of Barton-on -the-Heath (a town just a few miles
north of Stratford-upon-Avon) made a startling discovery.
He had recently retired to the rural village after an illustrious career
in London, where his friends included members of Parliament, the writer
Laurence Strerne and the critic Samuel Johnson. With new found time
on his hands, he had accepted the invitation of a bookseller to write a
biography of Shakespeare. Since he now lived down the road from the great
man's birthplace, Wilmot began HIS RESEARCH by seeking anecdotes
from his new neighbors. The local towns people recounted all the pastoral
legends preserved in Stratford because of their felicitous effect on
tourism.

What [Wilmot] heard stunned him. According to his friend James Corton
Crowell, he learned that Shakespeare was &quot;at best a country clown at the
time he went to seek his fortune in London, that he could never have had any
school learning, and that that fact would render it impossible that he could
be received as a friend and equal by those of culture and breeding who
alone could by their intercourse make up for the deficiencies of his youth.&quot;

So Wilmot began to have doubts.&gt;&gt;
------------------------------------------------------------------
James Wilmot declined payment from a bookseller
in order to follow THE SCIENTIFIC METHOD :
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Hypothesis based on experience:

&lt;&lt;If Shakespeare were a great poet, he reasoned, he would have been
one of the few men in the county with an extensive library and, no doubt,
some of his volumes would, over time, find their way
onto the bookshelves of the best families.

Test:

Wilmot paid a visit to every manor house within a 50 mile
radius of Stratford. He viewed old letters, preserved by
the descendants of Shakespeare's contemporaries,

Results:

and found -shockingly- not one reference to the poet!

As for books, he couldn't find a single one that had
belonged to Shakespeare in any of the private libraries.&gt;&gt;
----------------------------------------------------------------
The only real mistake that Wilmot made was in not publishing:

&lt;&lt;If you've made up your mind to test a theory, you should always
decide to publish it whichever way it comes out. If we only publish
results of a certain kind, we can make the argument [biased].
We must publish both kinds of results.&gt;&gt;

Delia Bacon: Hawthorne's Last Heroine* by Nina Baym

&lt;&lt;On 28 July 1856, Nathaniel Hawthorne visited for an hour in London
with a compatriot, Delia Bacon. Bacon, forty-five years old at the time,
had been living in London for three years writing a book about the true
authorship of the plays falsely attributed, as she believed, to William
Shakespeare. Hawthorne's sister-in-law Elizabeth Peabody had been urging
this meeting on him for some time, for Bacon had quickly become a
favorite among the liberal literati of Boston and Cambridge after she
moved there from New Haven in 1849.

Besides being attractive, vivacious, and intellectual, Bacon had been
victimized in a nasty little scandal, no less nasty for being little,
that fractured the New Haven Congregational community in 1847. Her
brother Leonard Bacon, a minister, formally accused Alexander McWhorter,
also a minister, of attempting to evade an engagement with Delia Bacon
by defaming her. Leonard was backed by the town clergy, McWhorter by the
Yale faculty. The evidence supported Leonard's claim, but the church
proceedings that followed produced only the equivalent of a slap on the
wrist for the culprit and exposed Delia Bacon to public humiliation. The
examiners decided that though McWhorter had indeed calumniated Delia
Bacon, her innocently indiscreet behavior had more or less invited it;
therefore the harsh penalty sought by Leonard-defrocking-was not
warranted.

The bad showing by the Yale Congregationalists in this episode
delighted Boston Unitarians, and endeared Delia Bacon especially to the
women. She was warmly received when she moved to Boston to support
herself, as she had supported herself for many years, by giving group
lessons in history to women in their homes. About a year after her
arrival, Bacon began to deliver her historical lessons as public
lectures; a year later she moved to New York and repeated the lectures
on the public stage. Hawthorne might have learned about these events
from Peabody or through the newspapers; if so, Bacon's circumstances as
a woman scapegoated by a self-protective religious establishment might
have been echoed in THE SCARLET LETTER, while her stint at public
lecturing might have influenced his depictions of Zenobia and Priscilla
in The Blithedale Romance. By the time he met her in person, however,
the McWhorter scandal and her lecturing career were over; she was now
completely driven by the idea that the historical Shakespeare had not
written the plays attributed to him.

The conviction that this actual personage had been paid to front for
works written collaboratively by a society of Elizabethan statesmen
headed by Francis Bacon had first dawned on her before she moved to
Boston, and as time passed she became increasingly certain that it was
her destiny to make the existence of this society and its authorship of
the plays known to the world.' In her view the society was necessarily a
secret one, its authorship of the plays concealed, not because of any
scorn attached to courtiers who wrote plays, but because the plays were
politically incendiary. To simplify her complex argument, she saw the
plays as briefs for and expositions of the principles of republican
government in opposition to the monarchial despotism represented in and
enforced by Queen Elizabeth. As student and teacher of history-to be
sure, &quot;history&quot; for her did not mean what it means today-Bacon was far
more interested in the historical than the literary implications of her
theory (or, as she saw it, her discovery). She had long thought of drama
as a unique teaching instrument through which an elite might instruct
the masses, and had even published a Shakespearean play herself about
the American Revolution, The Bride of Fort Edward, designed to instruct
the populace in patriotism.

The possibility-to Bacon, the certainty-that a secret society of
courtiers devoted to republican ideals had existed in Elizabeth's day
and had tried to reach the masses surreptitiously through drama
constituted a major revision, not only of a standard English history,
but of standard United States history as well. American history written
from the New England perspective (as it largely was before the Civil
War) regularly claimed that American republican ideals originated among
the Calvinist Puritans and emigrated to these shores along with them.
Bacon's find, displacing republicanism from bourgeois Puritans to Church
of England aristocrats, deprived New England Calvinism of its originary
historical claim, and, indeed, struck more generally at American
exceptionalism.

Shakespeare was already an established cultural institution in the
United States by the late 1840s, and those who heard Bacon talk about
her theory and who took it at all seriously urged her to bolster her
assertions with concrete evidence. It was not enough, they pointed out,
to demonstrate that the historical Shakespeare was an unlikely person to
have written the plays; and, they insisted, literary interpretations, no
matter how provocative, could never substitute for concrete facts. Like
many another textualist, Bacon found her readings of the works
absolutely convincing; but she bowed to pressure, garnered financial aid
from patrons and family, and went to England ostensibly in search of
proof.

In England, however, Bacon did not search for material evidence.
Rather, she worked at refining and extending her interpretations to make
their arguments ever more self-evident. That is, she continued to act as
though extrinsic evidence was not really necessary to her case, as
though the text itself contained all the proof required. (Here she
betrayed her long exposure to and immersion in the traditional art of
biblical exegesis.) Bacon also made a bad strategic mistake by
publishing an attack on Shakespeare-the ground-clearing, she said, for
her graver performance of the plays as political treatises-in Putnam's
in January 1856. The response to this article was so negative that
Putnam's declined to publish any more of her project.

When Hawthorne met her she was living in great poverty and in a state
of near-despair because she had no idea how to get her book (which took
the form of a long historical preamble and extended close readings of
three plays: King Lear, Julius Caesar, and Coriolanus) into print.
Hawthorne evinced an interest in the work that went beyond mere
politeness, and soon after their meeting she sent him the manuscript. He
and Sophia read it, Sophia thought it brilliant, and Hawthorne undertook
to see that it was published. He negotiated with publishers and with the
increasingly anxious and emotionally volatile author; eventually he not
only wrote an introduction for the book but also subvented publication
costs. Thanks to him, then, Bacon's book of almost seven hundred pages,
The Philosophy of Shakespeare's Plays Unfolded, came out in London and
Boston in 1857.

With the manuscript finally at the press, Delia Bacon left London for
Stratford and finally, briefly, faced the challenge of finding the
extrinsic evidence that she still continued to think she did not need.
In deciding what to look for she reasoned, first, that the society would
have left documentary evidence of its existence; and second, that the
prohibition against moving Shakespeare's bones probably meant the
documents were buried in the grave. But at Stratford she lingered and
lingered without doing anything. Once, and once only, she visited the
grave inside the Stratford church to test her conclusions in some
unspecified way. Gaining permission to remain after closing time, she
spent perhaps three hours there. In a letter dated 16 October 1856, she
described this episode to Hawthorne. This, the only account she seems to
have written of her visit, was republished in an 1888 biography by a
nephew; but long before then Hawthorne had used it in the Stratford
essay called &quot;Reflections of a Gifted Woman,&quot; which appeared first in
the Atlantic Monthly and then in Our Old Home.

In this essay Hawthorne portrayed Bacon as a combination of his two
major character types: the individual whose obsession determines the
shape of the inner and outer life, and the antinomian heroine who defies
social conventions. The character who most prefigures her is Catherine
of &quot;The Gentle Boy,&quot; but this character type is filtered through the
memorable sequence initiated by Hester Prynne. Assimilating Bacon to his
own world, Hawthorne inevitably discounted Bacon's own view of her
project. He deprecated the particular content of her theory, going so
far as to transform her bardophobia into an unconscious manifestation of
bardolotry:

&quot;Unquestionably, she was a monomaniac; these overmastering ideas
about the authorship of Shakespeare's plays, and the deep political
philosophy concealed beneath the surface of them, had completely thrown
her off her balance; but at the same time they had wonderfully developed
her intellect, and made her what she could not otherwise have become....
To have based such a system on fancy, and unconsciously elaborated it
for herself, was almost as wonderful as really to have found it in the
plays. But, in a certain sense, she did actually find it there.
Shakespeare has surface beneath surface, to an immeasurable depth,
adapted to the plummet-line of every reader.&quot;

Hawthorne would never have fixated on Shakespeare had the plays not
been icons of the culture and had Bacon not accepted them as
masterpieces. There is considerable rhetorical canniness in this way of
handling ...

Yes, you dope. All that is (and was) perfectly
obvious. My point -- which I did not feel I had
to spell out (although that was obviously a
mistake as far as you are concerned) -- was
that it depends entirely on your starting
position.

IF you start by ASSUMING that the Stratfordian
position is correct, then it makes sense to ask
'when did anti-Stratfordianism begin?'.

But IF you start with the correct assumption --
that Oxford wrote the works, starting in the
1560s before he was ten -- then such questions
as posed from a Stratfordian point of view will
be seen to be very different. Some people knew
the truth from the beginning -- so the issue of
'doubt' is not applicable. Maybe sometime
in the 18th century the truth got forgotten, as
the tide of middle-class idiocy swept the land.
Maybe it didn't. But those are the interesting
and the relevant questions -- not the one
posed by Anca.

I made analogies with other erroneous positions,
such as those created by the Piltdown fraud and
by Usher's calculation of the date of the Creation.
Obviously you could not follow them.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I was wondering, if anyone knew an exact date or perhaps knows when
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the shakespeare authorship first began.. not the theories as such,

&gt;&gt;&gt; It began in the 1550s before Ned Vere was ten,
&gt;&gt;&gt; and showed such talent that his work had to be
&gt;&gt;&gt; published, yet it could not come under over his
&gt;&gt;&gt; true name.

&gt;&gt; Are you so wrapped up in your own crackpottery that you can't even read
a
&gt;&gt; poster's question? She didn't ask when you think your candidate became
&gt;&gt; Shakespeare. Her full question was: &quot;I was wondering, if anyone knew an
&gt;&gt; exact date or perhaps knows when the shakespeare authorship first
began..
&gt;&gt; not the theories as such, but how long after shakespeare death did the
&gt;&gt; questions arise and why did people only after his death begin to
question
&gt;&gt; the authorship?&quot;

&gt;&gt; In other words, she asked: When did anti-Stratfordianism start?

&gt; Yes, you dope. All that is (and was) perfectly
&gt; obvious. My point -- which I did not feel I had
&gt; to spell out (although that was obviously a
&gt; mistake as far as you are concerned) -- was
&gt; that it depends entirely on your starting
&gt; position.

"/>

No it doesn't, you fuckwit. It's a matter of historical fact. Whether the
assumption that William of Stratford wrote the plays is true or false makes
not a jot of difference. Anti-Stratfordianism began when people first
expressed their doubts about his authorship. Just read the bloody question,
and stop answering questions you invented for yourself.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; IF you start by ASSUMING that the Stratfordian
&gt; position is correct, then it makes sense to ask
&gt; 'when did anti-Stratfordianism begin?'.

Is your idiocy congenital? It makes no difference what you assume. The
historical fact remains what it was.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; But IF you start with the correct assumption --
&gt; that Oxford wrote the works, starting in the
&gt; 1560s before he was ten -- then such questions
&gt; as posed from a Stratfordian point of view will
&gt; be seen to be very different.

"/>

Yes. Different from the fucking question the poster asked.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I made analogies with other erroneous positions,
&gt; such as those created by the Piltdown fraud and
&gt; by Usher's calculation of the date of the Creation.
&gt; Obviously you could not follow them.

"/>

I fell asleep before I got to the end. Your voice carries that kind of
monotonous whine commonly found in train-spotters and beer-mat collectors.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Your inability to read posters' questions is matched only by your
&gt;&gt; inability to read a line of Shakespeare.

&gt; Isn't it strange how you (and all other
&gt; Strats and quasi-Strats) avoid making
&gt; any detailed criticism of my readings of
&gt; the Sonnets?

"/>

No, it isn't strange. When you first posted that kind of bullshit, it was a
novelty. Good for a laugh. But now the joke has run its course, because
watching a crank turning out the same sad stuff year after year has its
limits as entertainment. Nobody can be bothered even to read your ridiculous

What is, or is not, 'historical fact' is dependent

You are so locked in to your tiny view of
your tiny world that you simply cannot
conceive of any other. In addition, you have
received not the slightest training that might
have opened your mind to such a possibility.
I never thought I'd ever have anything good
to say about 'post-modernist education' but
then I've rarely encountered stupidity as
profound as yours. Perhaps that education
IS -- in some respects, anyway -- slightly in
advance of the worst sorts of conversational

Do you remember Bill Clinton's famous phrase
&quot;I never had sex with that woman&quot;? Suppose
someone asked you &quot;When did people begin
to doubt the veracity of that statement?&quot;,
-- you'd wonder whether or not they were
joking, or had a poor command of English,
or had failed completely to understand what
was going on.

The grammar of that question is exactly the
same as the grammar of Anca's. Her confusion
(and that of Stratfordians generally) is similar
to that of this hypothetical foreigner. Both are
founded on a false belief that there was a period
-- right at the start -- when the statement was
accepted as true.

You probably won't understand this analogy
-- given your congenital problems. But I
can't afford to spend any more time on it.

You miss the point (as ever). Strats
around here love to make a spectacle
of attacking what they regard as anti-
Strat foolishness. But, no matter how
much coat-trailing I do, they never pick

I guess it's just that I am much too nice.

Hi, Roundy. Long time no contact.

I'm just dropping in to present the facts as I know them:

In 1805 Cowell gave a talk based on the &quot;research&quot; of James Wilmot in
which Cowell suggested that Shakespeare of Stratford could not have
written the Shakespearean Oeuvre. But Cowell's talk was not
published. Ergo, credit for being the first Gulielmus-Rejector should
go to Joseph C. Hart who in 1848 speculated in a memoir that
Shakespeare was not Shakespeare. In 1852 an anonymous writer
questioned who wrote the Oeuvre in an Edinburgh journal. Delia Bacon
was next in 1856. She should be given credit for writing the first
truly serious Gulielmus-rejecting work. She did not quite attribute
the Oeuvre to Bacon, preferring some kind of group Bacon participated
in.

&gt;&gt; the shakespeare authorship first began.. not the theories as such, but
&gt;&gt; how long after shakespeare death did the questions arise and why did
&gt;&gt; people only after his death begin to question the authorship? I cant

&gt;&gt; it correctly, but all that ive found is the dates where theorist have
&gt;&gt; suggestion their opinions as to who wrote the works. Or is there no
&gt;&gt; information because no one knows when they all really began?

&gt;&gt; So if anyone knows any good articles online for me to have a look at,
&gt;&gt; or just anything would be greatly appreciated.

&gt; I can't remember his name now, but I believe the first anti-Stratfordian
was
&gt; a local antiquarian who in the late eighteenth century travelled the
&gt; Stratford area in search of Shakespeare. He turned up almost nothing.and
&gt; concluded that someone else had written the works. So,

"/>

anti-Stratfordianism

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; dates from about a century and a half after Shakespeare's death.

"/>

Just to add that its late emergence is a significant argument against
anti-Stratfordianism, which is almost entirely built on conspiracy plus
cover-up. Such a strikingly modern blanket-censorship, if it ever existed,
could have had no force after the outbreak of the Civil War in the 1640s,
and especially after the execution of Charles I in 1648, and the effective
emasculation of the aristocracy. The First Folio, which pinned the
authorship on William, was only two decades old - well within reach of
living memory. There would have been plenty of people privy to the knowledge
who would have had no reason to remain silent, and plenty of reasons for
speaking out. In any age it would go against the grain for people to make
or connive in a knowing misattribution of works of literature, especially
those as great as Shakespeare's. It strains credulity beyond reason to
propose that those in the know would have kept silent when silence could no
longer be enforced - that is, even supposing that anyone in the aristocracy
of the 1640s cared a damn one way or the other about maintaining the
non-literary credentials of some long-dead nobleman or courtier.

Had Anti-Stratfordianism had any basis in reality, it would have emerged
long before it did. It belongs to the industrial age, and the age of
radicalism. Roughly coincident with the rise of that most paranoid of
political creeds, Marxism, and the formation of secret societies and
&quot;movements&quot; of one kind or another (with conspiracy as some kind of ideé
fixe - chronicled by Dostoevsky, amongst others) anti-Stratfordianism
strikes me as a text-book case of back-projection, revealing far more about
the preoccupations of the society in which it emerged than those of the
society it purports to deal with.

No. Just cover-up. It was almost trivially easy.
The Queen decided (with the consent of the
poet) that his name should not be associated
with his writing. It was a policy first implemented
when he was a child, possibly even before he
reached the age of ten. It was maintained on
a similar basis thereafter.

They had plenty of reasons for not speaking out.
The assertion that 'Good Queen Bess' indulged in

today. At that time any such statements would
invited a good beating at the minimum.

Ridiculous. Luckily the Bard's works were
almost completely misunderstood. Otherwise
they would have been treated much worse
than were the works lesser authors -- such
as James Joyce. His name could not be
mentioned in polite society in Dublin for
some 50 or so years after the publication of
Ulysses. Many of his nieces and nephews
in Dublin did not even know that they were
related to him, such was the disgrace. The
works of the great Bard would have been
destroyed had the truth been known, and
their meanings comprehended.

All this is from a fatuous idiot who has not

It is only now that we can begin to discuss

1964 -

Justice Wilberforce in a court case in England brought by the heirs of
the deceased Evelyn May Hopkins, challenging the validity of her gift
to the Francis Bacon Society, Inc., gave an opinion in favor of Miss
Hopkins' intentions, indicating that &quot;the evidence in favour of
Shake-speare's authorship is quantitatively slight. It rests
positively, in the main, on the explicit statements in the First Folio
of 1623 and on continuous tradition; negatively on the lack of any
challenge to this ascription at the time.&quot; He goes on to say that the
noted English historian, Professor Trevor-Roper also considers that
the case for William Shakespeare rests on a narrow balance of evidence

authorship resources and news of the debate to a global audience.
Teachers at both the high school and college level increasingly have
class assignments on the authorship debate and use the Internet as a
primary resource for up-to-date information.

&gt; James Greenstreet, a British archivist, in a series of essays in The
&gt; Genealogist, proposed that William Stanley, 6th Earl of Derby was
&gt; author of the Shakespeare plays.

&gt; 1892 -

&gt; Our English Homer listed several writers as a group who were
&gt; responsible for writing Shakespeare's works: Marlowe, Greene, Peele,
&gt; Nashe, Lodge, Bacon and others.

&gt; 1895 -

&gt; It Was Marlowe: A Story of the Secret of Three Centuries, a novel by
&gt; Wilbur Ziegler, proposed that Marlowe, Raleigh, and the Earl of
&gt; Rutland were authors of the Shakespearean canon.

&gt; 1903 -

&gt; Henry James in a letter to Miss Violet Hunt says &quot;I am 'a sort of'
&gt; haunted by the conviction that the divine William is the biggest and
&gt; most successful fraud ever practised on a patient world.&quot;

&gt; 1908 -

&gt; Sir George Greenwood, scholar and Member of Parliament, exposed the
&gt; major arguments and scholarship against the Stratford man as author of
&gt; the Shakespearean canon in his book, The Shakespeare Problem Restated,
&gt; the first in a series of volumes that Sir George devoted to the
&gt; subject.

&gt; 1910 -

&gt; Bacon Is Shakespeare by Sir Edwin Durning-Lawrence (New York, John
&gt; McBride Co.) cited arguments that Bacon is Shakespeare and that the
&gt; following are distinguished men who perceived &quot;the truth respecting
&gt; the real authorship of the Plays:&quot;

&gt; --Lord Palmerston, British statesman, 1784-1865.
&gt; --Lord Houghton, British statesman, 1809-1885 (better known as Richard
&gt; Monckton Milnes).
&gt; -- Samuel Taylor Coleridge, British critic and poet, 1772-1834

Where is the quotation from Coleridge?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; --John Bright, British statesman, 1811-1889 (&quot;Any man that believes
&gt; that William Shakespeare of Stratford wrote Hamlet or Lear is a
&gt; fool.&quot;)
&gt; --Ralph Waldo Emerson, American philosopher and poet, 1803-1882

AntiStrat claims that Emerson doubted are a fraud. It's an intentional
misreading of the quotation they use.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; --John Greenlief Whittier, American poet, 1807-1892 (&quot;Whether Bacon

&gt; The Derbyite theory, suggesting that William Stanley, 6th Earl of
&gt; Derby was the true author behind the Shakespeare name, was revived by
&gt; Robert Fraser in The Silent Shakespeare.

&gt; 1919 -

&gt; Abel Lefranc, a French scholar, also supports the Derbyite theory in
&gt; his Sous le Masque de &quot;William Shakespeare&quot;: William Stanley, VI Comte
&gt; de Derby.

&gt; 1920 - J. Thomas Looney, British schoolmaster and scholar, evolved the
&gt; theory of Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford as author in his book,
&gt;&quot;Shakespeare&quot; Identified in Edward de Vere, the Seventeenth Earl of
&gt; Oxford.

&gt; 1922 -

&gt; The Shakespeare Fellowship, an organization devoted to research on the
&gt; Shakespearean authorship, is formed with honorary president Sir George
&gt; Greenwood, and officers including J. T. Looney, Colonel B. R. Ward
&gt; (father of the biographer of Edward de Vere) and Abel Lefranc.

&gt; 1926 -

&gt; Sigmund Freud adopts J. Thomas Looney's theory on the 17th Earl of
&gt; Oxford. (One of Freud's teachers, Theodor Meynert, had believed in
&gt; Bacon as the true author.) Freud later confirmed this advocacy in 1935
&gt; with the revision of his Autobiographical Study.

&gt; 1930 -

&gt; Canon Gerald Rendall, Gladstone professor of Greek at Liverpool's
&gt; University College, publishes Shakespeare Sonnets and Edward de Vere
&gt; --another book that influenced Sigmund Freud.

&gt; 1930 -

&gt; Eva Turner Clark publishes a book, Shakespeare's Plays in the Order of

&gt; plays and at a much earlier date than supposed.

&gt; 1943 -

&gt; Alden Brooks advocates the candidacy of Sir Edward Dyer as author in

&gt; Marlowe was author of Shakespeare's plays.

&gt; 1956 -

&gt; George Elliot Sweet's Shakespeare the Mystery presents the case for
&gt; Queen Elizabeth as author.

&gt; 1957 - present

&gt; Incorporation of the Shakespeare Oxford Society. From its inception
&gt; (originally as the Shakespeare Fellowship in the l930s) a stream of
&gt; publications in the form of books, newsletters, and journals advanced
&gt; the evidence for Edward de Vere's authorship of the Shakespeare canon.
&gt; Noted writers: Charlton and Dorothy Ogburn, Charlton Ogburn, Jr.,
&gt; Charles Wisner Barrell, Louis Benezet, Gelett Burgess, Ruth Loyd

&gt; 1962 -

&gt; Historian Hugh Trevor-Roper in Realites ( Nov. 1962) says,
&gt;&quot;One-hundredth part of the labor (expended on Shakespeare's curriculum
&gt; vitae) applied to one of his insignificant contemporaries would be
&gt; sufficient to produce a substantial biography.&quot;

&gt; 1964 -

&gt; Justice Wilberforce in a court case in England brought by the heirs of
&gt; the deceased Evelyn May Hopkins, challenging the validity of her gift
&gt; to the Francis Bacon Society, Inc., gave an opinion in favor of Miss
&gt; Hopkins' intentions, indicating that &quot;the evidence in favour of
&gt; Shake-speare's authorship is quantitatively slight. It rests
&gt; positively, in the main, on the explicit statements in the First Folio
&gt; of 1623 and on continuous tradition; negatively on the lack of any
&gt; challenge to this ascription at the time.&quot; He goes on to say that the
&gt; noted English historian, Professor Trevor-Roper also considers that
&gt; the case for William Shakespeare rests on a narrow balance of evidence
&gt; and that new material could upset it&quot;

&gt; 1975

&gt; Reprint publication of Looney's Shakespeare Identified (edited by Ruth
&gt; Loyd Miller) from Minos Publishing.

&gt; 1984

&gt; Publication of Charlton Ogburn's The Mysterious William Shakespeare
&gt; results in a burst of new interest in the authorship that continues

&gt; 1987

&gt; The Moot Court Debate in Washington DC presided over by three sitting
&gt; Justices of the US Supreme Court. Two of the three justices (Blackmun

&gt; History of Doubts surrounding the
&gt; authorship of Shakespeare's Works

&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------------------
------

&gt; 1728 -

&gt; Publication of Captain Goulding's Essay Against Too Much Reading in
&gt; which he comments on the background Shakespeare would require for his
&gt; historical plays and suggests that Shakespeare probably had to keep
&gt;&quot;one of those chuckle-pated Historians for his particular
&gt; Associate...or he might have starvd upon his History.&quot; Goulding tells
&gt; us that he had this from &quot;one of his (Shakespeare's) intimate
&gt; Acquaintance.&quot;

"/>

How old was this &quot;intimate Acquaintance&quot;? Or how old was Goulding when he
wrote his essay? Considering Shakespeare died 116 years before, one or the
other must have had an abnormally extended life-span.

As for the quote from this essay, it appears to be nothing more than a
would-be-witty comment based on references by Jonson and others to
Shakespeare's lack of education. If Goulding took that at face value, he
might well have made the remark he did make.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; 1769 -

&gt; Publication of The Life and Adventures of Common Sense, an anonymous
&gt; allegory which describes a profligate Shakespeare casting &quot;his Eye
&gt; upon a common place Book, in which was contained, an Infinite Variety
&gt; of Modes and Forms, to express all the different Sentiments of the
&gt; human Mind, together with Rules for their Combinations and Connections
&gt; upon every Subject or Occasion that might Occur in Dramatic
&gt; Writing...&quot;

"/>

How does this qualify as anti-Stratfordian material? It's a comment on the
extensive variety of human behaviour to be found in the plays. The
suggestion is that there is more in them than any one man could ever know.
In that case it's also anti-Oxfordian, anti-Marlovian, anti-Baconian.....

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; 1786 -

&gt; The Story of the Learned Pig , an anonymous allegory by an &quot;Officer of
&gt; the Royal Navy,&quot; in which The Pig describes himself as having
&gt; variously been a greyhound, deer, bear and a human being (after taking
&gt; possession of a body) who worked as horseholder at a playhouse where
&gt; he met the &quot;Immortal Shakespeare&quot; who's he reports didn't &quot;run his
&gt; country for deer-stealing&quot; and didn't father the various plays,
&gt; Hamlet, Othello, As You Like It, The Tempest , and Midsummer's Night
&gt; Dream. Instead the Pig confesses to be author.

"/>

I've seen a reference to this a couple of times by anti-Strats, but I've
haven't read it. But I'll make an informed guess, based
on the dishonest scholarship one normally finds in that quarter. I'll guess
that in this fable, writing Shakespeare's plays is only one of many things
that the Pig gets up to. In his other incarnations as greyhound, deer, bear,
etc, he has other adventures, popping up at various moments in history to
perform a famous action that someone other historical personage is given
credit for. Bet?

A wise move. Antistratfordians love to misquote and quote out of context
anything they can twist into &quot;support&quot; for their lunacy. Dickens, Melville,
Emerson, and Leslie Howard have all been abused that way.

A C O M E D Y.

Acted in the Year 1625. By His M A J E S T Y' S Servants.

The Author Ben. Johnson.

Aut prodesse volunt, aut delectare poetæ: Aut simul &amp; jucunda,
&amp; idonea dicere vitæ. Hor. in Art. Poet.

(quote, excerpt)

Prologue. Nay, start not, Ladies; these carry no Fire- works
to fright you, but a Torch i' their Hands, to give Light to the Business.
The truth is, there are a Set of Gamesters within, in travel of a thing
call'd a Play, and would fain be deliver'd of it: and they have
entreated me to be their Man-Midwife, the Prologue;
for they are like to have a hard Labour on't.

Tattle. Then the Poet has abus'd himself, like an Ass as he is.

Mirth. No, his Actors will abuse him enough, or I am deceiv'd.
Yonder he is within (I was i' the Tiring-house a while
to see the Actors drest) rolling himself up and down like a Tun,
i' the midst of 'em, and spurges, never did Vessel of Wort
or Wine work so! His Sweating put me in mind of
a good Shroving Dish (and I believe would be taken up
for a Service of State somewhere, an't were known)
a stew'd Poet! He doth sit like an unbrac'd Drum,
with one of his Heads beaten out;
for that you must note, a Poet hath two Heads, as a Drum has;
one for making, the other repeating;
and his repeating Head is all to pieces;
they may gather it up i' the Tiring-house;
for he hath torn the Book in a Poetical Fury,
and put himself to silence in dead Sack,
which, were there no other Vexation,
were sufficient to make him
the most miserable Emblem of Patience.
Censure.
The Prologue, peace.

(another excerpt)

Great noble Wits, be good unto your selves,
And make a difference 'twixt Poetick Elves,
And Poets: All that dabble in the Ink,
And defile Quills, are not those few, can think,
Conceive, express, and steer the Souls of Men,
As with a Rudder, round thus, with their Pen.
He must be one that can instruct your Youth,
And keep your Acme in the state of Truth,
Must enterprise this Work; mark but his Ways,
What Flight he makes, how new: And then he says,
If that not like you, that he sends to night,
'Tis you have left to judge, not he to write.

Hi Lynne,

Here's a link to Clark Holloway's invaluable Jonson
site:

&lt;&gt;

Jonson first staged Staple years earlier--it was originally
written to make Prince Charles' humiliating rejection by the
Hapsburg Infanta a 'triumph' for Britain. Jonson added the
'Lickfinger the Master Cooke' scenes after the First Folio
was printed.

You can find Jonson's reference to Oxford by searching
the page for 'oracle.'

Thanks, Elizabeth. Are we talking about this?

Hope the fare was good. Pec. Yes, Lickfinger,
And we shall thank you for't, and reward you.
Mad. Nay, I'll not lose my argument, Lickfinger;

[Lickfinger is challeng'd by Madrigal of

There are different bot flavours. Bianca-bot doesn't know whether she knows
anything about it, or might have misunderstood the question, or else doesn't
think it's interesting enough, and doesn't know why she's posting a question
in the first place, so maybe you could explain, because you might be
insinuating something. Weir-bot knows all about it, but doesn't take
questions. Malcrowleyo, or Pisspot-bot, knows all about it too, but
complains about not getting any questions.....etc

Read Diana Price's observations on the Davies' epistle including
reference to Terence. Read Ogburn on snide references to concealed
authorship re Venus and Adonis. See confusion over authorship of Romeo
and Juliet attributing it to Daniel.

References to authorship issues were contemporary, but very toned

&gt;&gt;&gt; I was wondering, if anyone knew an exact date or perhaps knows when
&gt;&gt;&gt; the shakespeare authorship first began.. not the theories as such,

&gt;&gt; It began in the 1550s before Ned Vere was ten,
&gt;&gt; and showed such talent that his work had to be
&gt;&gt; published, yet it could not come under over his
&gt;&gt; true name.

&gt; Are you so wrapped up in your own crackpottery that you can't even read a
&gt; poster's question? She didn't ask when you think your candidate became
&gt; Shakespeare. Her full question was: &quot;I was wondering, if anyone knew an
&gt; exact date or perhaps knows when the shakespeare authorship first began..
&gt; not the theories as such, but how long after shakespeare death did the
&gt; questions arise and why did people only after his death begin to question
&gt; the authorship?&quot;

&gt; In other words, she asked: When did anti-Stratfordianism start? And
&gt; anti-Stratfordianism started when the first person to doubt the Stratfordian
&gt; assumption put pen to paper to say so. Do you know anyone in the 1550s who
&gt; did that? Your inability to read posters' questions is matched only by your
&gt; inability to read a line of Shakespeare.

&gt; Buffalo

&gt;&gt; We don't know when he adopted the pseudonym
&gt;&gt; of 'Will Shake-speare'; it could have been before
&gt;&gt; 1565, or as late as 1580.

&gt;&gt;&gt; but
&gt;&gt;&gt; how long after shakespeare death did the questions arise and why did
&gt;&gt;&gt; people only after his death begin to question the authorship?

&gt;&gt; From the time De Vere first published, both
&gt;&gt; anonymously or under another name, people
&gt;&gt; would have been asking: 'who wrote this?' or
&gt;&gt; 'who really wrote this?' But the 'public', (i.e. the
&gt;&gt; newly-literate middle-classes) only became
&gt;&gt; aware of his existence, to any significant extent
&gt;&gt; only some time after the Folio came out in 1623.
&gt;&gt; Given their predominantly straight-laced,
&gt;&gt; humourless, puritanical nature, it simply did not
&gt;&gt; occur to them that their leg was being pulled,
&gt;&gt; What they thought or did not think is no more
&gt;&gt; than a minor question in the history of folly.
&gt;&gt; An investigation here would be roughly similar
&gt;&gt; to one into the thinking of those people fooled
&gt;&gt; by the Piltdown fraud, or to one into the
&gt;&gt; thinking of the followers of Archbishop Usher
&gt;&gt; after he established the precise moment of the
&gt;&gt; creation of the world (as being in 4004, BC).

&gt;&gt;&gt; I cant
&gt;&gt;&gt; seem to find any information on this, maybe because im not looking for
&gt;&gt;&gt; it correctly, but all that ive found is the dates where theorist have
&gt;&gt;&gt; suggestion their opinions as to who wrote the works. Or is there no
&gt;&gt;&gt; information because no one knows when they all really began?

&gt;&gt; Your problem is mainly in your question.
&gt;&gt; It's like asking when did people start to
&gt;&gt; doubt the Piltdown fraud or when did they
&gt;&gt; start to question the accuracy of Archbishop
&gt;&gt; Usher's calculation. The answer is that well-

As I have pointed out before(possibly the only one in the twentieth
to twenty-first centuries) and will now point out again:
We might start with the original preface to Greene's &quot;Farewell
to

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Follie&quot;(l587,but published ,with an additional preface ,in the early
&gt; nineties).
&gt; This was spotted by Richard Simpson(one of the most intelligent
&gt; Statfordian minds in the second half of the nineteenth century,his
&gt;&quot;Thomas More&quot; essay aside), in the early l870's.

&gt; According to Greene,someone who could not write a manuscript
&gt; without the aid of the parish clerk(St.Giles outside Cripplegate is
&gt; specifically mentioned in said paragraph) is being made the &quot;father of
&gt; interludes&quot;One of these interludes is very specifically identified by
&gt; two separate quotations given as&quot;Faire Em&quot;. This appeared,undated and
&gt; anonymously, in a wretched transcription ,exactly as Greene had
&gt; predicted.
&gt; Further,according to both Startfordian(Simpson and Alwin Thaler)
&gt; and anti-Stratfordian scholars(Titherley and Lefranc) &quot;Faire Em&quot;
&gt; contains a series of direct links to the circle, and geographical
&gt; holdings, of Fernando and William Stanley.In fact, a then still living
&gt; neighbor and recorded household guest is brought on as a character.

&gt; Greene specifically parallels the bizarre course of putting forth
&gt; a near illiterate as the author of interludes(in the sense of full
&gt; length productions) with another,rather more sensible procedure, of
&gt; hiring a &quot;Batylus&quot; to include one's anonymous poems with his
&gt; own.Batylus generally indicates a snapper up of other men's trifles
&gt; and this Batylus is not only a thief but also a front man.

&gt; There are a limited number of published poetry collections between
&gt; Greene's first appearance on the scene in l580 and the fall of l587.We
&gt; have a further clue in that Greene was a notorious Batylus himself.
&gt; The only ripoff he is likely to be complaining about is one in which
&gt; he was the victem.So we want a work published between these dates
&gt; containing obvious Greene lines and stylometrically identifiable as
&gt; being the work of at least two authors, but with a single name on the
&gt; title page.The allusion should have still been identifiable when the
&gt; original preface was published four years later and this,among other
&gt; things, would imply that the Batylus was publishing closer to l587
&gt; than l580 and may well have repeated the offence between l587 and
&gt; l591.

&gt; Whether accurately or inaccurately,Simpson believed the near
&gt; illiterate involved in the &quot;Faire Em&quot; caper(among other similar
&gt; literary frauds) was William Shakspere of Stratford on Avon.He
&gt; therefore tried to prove Shakspere had written &quot;Faire Em&quot;(and to
&gt; authenticate the &quot;More&quot; manuscript) and thereby prove that Greene was
&gt; deliberately lying. This attribution has not found support among
&gt; either Stratfordians or anti-Stratfordians.

&gt; It is an inevitable logical supposition,however,that our budding
&gt; fraudulant father of interludes, whoever he was, found a promising
&gt; career ,at least for the time being, nipped by Greene's chilling
&gt; advance review.

&gt; Simpson,unfortunately, did not live to see Wallace's discovery of
&gt; the Mountjoy deposition which lists William(by then) Shakespeare
&gt; living in the area of St.Giles,Cripplegate(far removed from the Globe
&gt; but close to the new Henslowe enterprise) some ten years later.Still
&gt; it is Will's only known London address ever and his brother Edmund
&gt; went to that same church, as did another well-known Stratford
&gt; eminence,Sir Thomas Lucy .Again,unfortunately, most of the church
&gt; records went up in the Great Fire of 66.

&gt; But, whether directly linked to Shakspere or not, the practice of
&gt; hiring literary front men existed in London at least six years before
&gt; the publication of &quot;Venus and Adonis&quot; and nine years before the most
&gt; prolific publisher and/or printer of Shakespearean quartos,brought out
&gt;&quot;Locrine&quot; under the initials W.S.
&gt;&quot;Locrine&quot; was very specifically identified by the co-author George Buc
&gt; as a work by Sir Charles Tilney which was lost,along with Buc's
&gt; material, at the time of Tilney's death.Tilney,aged 24, was executed
&gt; in the Fall of l586 for complicity in the Babbington plot. As an
&gt; attainted traitor his belongings were confiscated by the
&gt; Crown.Someone, not a friend of the Buc-Tilney circle,would have
&gt; acquired the manuscript before the Fall of l587.Many critics believe
&gt; this manuscript was brought to Robert Greene(who certainly would have
&gt; had no access to the confiscated Tilney estate) in which event Greene
&gt; knew even more about Batylus like activity than he was letting on.

&gt; On the basis of the Buc annotation a second thing regarding
&gt; pseudonymous Elizabethan authorship may be taken as certain:Already
&gt; old aristocratic work emanating from a small Catholic circle was on at
&gt; least one occasion being presented as the work of
&gt; commoners,specifically one W.S. in l595.

You don't appear top have read Davies for yourself, Ken. Davies wrote not
an epistle but an epigram to Shakespeare which ought to have been
interesting to Price (if she had not been disabled from understanding it)
since Davies writes of Shakespeare not only as a playwright (&quot;Our English

You suggestion is about as helpful as it would be to suggest that a person

I know of no contemporary attribution of *Romeo and Juliet* to Samuel

&gt; References to authorship issues were contemporary, but very toned

There are a great many contemporary references to the authorship of
Shakespeare's works; indeed, they are a great part of the reason why his
works are attributed to him. This should not be a difficult concept to
understand; one of the main reasons Spenser's works are attributed to him
is that there were contemporary references to his authorship of those
works. Oxford's small output is credited to him on the basis of
contemporary attributions.

I would disagree with this, Terry. My feeling is that the Davies poem reads
very well on at least two different levels. It is an extremely clever piece
of work. Richard Whalen has written on it. I believe you and I and likely
some others discussed it on the Fellowship boards, although not
exhaustively. And Diana Price, I believe, will be saying more about it at
some point. I heard her speak on it in Knoxville. If she erred, it was in
not seeing the poem's potential to be truly ambiguous.

Good one, Terry!

But seriously (or at last as seriously as befits h.l.a.s.), are you

Ken so tersely alludes? Is it as pertinent to Shakespeare authorship as
the Wilmot Proviso?

What is the argument not to link to Sobran? I think you _should_ link
to Joseph Sobran's work. He's a skilled polemicist (I think, from the
few things I've read) and a well-known, and I presume respected,
American conservative. I've seen him referred to respectfully by
Michael Novak (who I think is generally considered a &quot;friend to the
Jews,&quot; and who does not stray too far from the center of the road, in
many respects), with nearly as much respect as Novak granted to Dennis
Prager. While I don't consider Holocaust-denial a respectable branch
of history, I also would _not_ want to restrict gentiles' remarks on
Jewish concerns to what's consistent with a long-discredited ghetto
mentality. (Least of all, when that mentality is now threatening to
take over the State of Israel, as well.)

The only reason I can think of not to link to Joseph Sobran is that
you know he has taken, publicly, a highly discreditable position (one
that, surely, sufficiently discredits his Shakespeare/Oxford work, as
well). If there are others, I'd be grateful to be enlightened.

none

the
&gt; Board
&gt;&gt;&gt; of Trustees was when we were deciding whether to provide a link to
&gt; Joseph
&gt;&gt;&gt; Sobran's website.

&gt;&gt; What is the argument not to link to Sobran?

&gt; We found that the problem with linking to Sobran's work on Oxford was that
&gt; the same link provided access to his anti-Semitic, anti-homosexual articles.
&gt; We did not wish to be associated with them nor to have to become apologists
&gt; (in both senses of the word) for him. I want to be quite clear about this as
&gt; in the past members of hlas have protested that Oxfordians would not take a
&gt; stand against this man.

"/>

This _is_ a problem with the World Wide Web: a new one, which will
need to be resolved -- in my opinion, probably in some new way.

But Sobran has written what you _know_ to be the best-known book on
&quot;the Oxford case,&quot; and it reflects badly on the Shakespeare Fellowship
that you appear to be ignoring it.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; I think you _should_ link
&gt;&gt; to Joseph Sobran's work.

&gt; Vote was taken several years ago. Anyone who wishes to have a website that
&gt; links to his work is quite welcome to do so. Our original link was broken.
&gt; After receiving a complaint about the link from a member, we voted not to
&gt; reinstate it.

&gt;&gt; He's a skilled polemicist (I think, from the
&gt;&gt; few things I've read) and a well-known, and I presume respected,
&gt;&gt; American conservative.

&gt; He is so far right that most other conservatives have distanced themselves
&gt; from him.

"/>

That may be the case. As I only read the rational sorts of
conservatives, being a liberal myself, I don't know. He does seem to
be a kind of Rush Limbaugh figure.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; I've seen him referred to respectfully by
&gt;&gt; Michael Novak (who I think is generally considered a &quot;friend to the
&gt;&gt; Jews,&quot; and who does not stray too far from the center of the road,
in
&gt;&gt; many respects), with nearly as much respect as Novak granted to
Dennis
&gt;&gt; Prager. While I don't consider Holocaust-denial a respectable
branch
&gt;&gt; of history, I also would _not_ want to restrict gentiles' remarks
on
&gt;&gt; Jewish concerns to what's consistent with a long-discredited ghetto
&gt;&gt; mentality. (Least of all, when that mentality is now threatening
to
&gt;&gt; take over the State of Israel, as well.)

&gt;&gt; The only reason I can think of not to link to Joseph Sobran is that
&gt;&gt; you know he has taken, publicly, a highly discreditable position
(one
&gt;&gt; that, surely, sufficiently discredits his Shakespeare/Oxford work,
as
&gt;&gt; well).

&gt; Not sure what you're talking about here.

"/>

I mean that his claims in favor of Holocaust-denial cast doubt on his
ability to evaluate the work of historians, as well as his ability to
carry out his own work in the field. Even if the former, in his case,
are polemical and not scholarly.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; We have no quarrel with his work on
&gt; Oxford, although some of our members do not agree with some of it. Our
&gt; quarrel is with his other activities.

"/>

My question regarded his public Holocaust-denial and his apparent
claim that this denial is historically based. I presume this is what
you mean by &quot;other activities.&quot; I suppose you would not blackball
someone you, in all other ways, respect as a scholar, merely because
he is involved in politics. It appears, however, from what you say,
that there are in fact no other arguments than this.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; If there are others, I'd be grateful to be enlightened.

&gt; See above. Or visit his website for yourself. And read all his material. I'm
&gt; not advocating that Sobran's work should be banned (mostly as I know this
&gt; would upset my friend and fellow member, Terry). I'm saying that we took a
&gt; vote and don't want to reinstate a link to him on our site. Apart from

"/>

I can certainly understand how that might be.

I have, in fact, looked at Joseph Sobran's website. I did not remain
very long, primarily because it was so clogged with political ephemera
that there wasn't anything interesting to see at all, and it was
impossible to find anything really substantive. Perhaps Sobran is
unwise not to set up separate websites for work on separate topics.

Lynne, the request was made by one of the SF administrators in a Forum
post timestamped &quot;11/12/2003 20:09&quot; on the thread &quot;Re: HLAS threads on
Price.&quot; Neither you nor any other member of the SF seemed to think the
request was out of order, and in deference to the request I said, &quot;I will
defer to your wishes and move on&quot; (see my post on the same thread that was
timestamped &quot;12/12/2003 06:26&quot;).

The SF forum is a different kind of critter from hlas. At hlas, anything
goes, including quite a few things that I wish had NOT gone. The SF forum
is managed by and for Oxfordians. The issue is not one of any censorship
being imposed on me -- I am, if anything, self-censoring on the SF forum.
I think the members of the SF ought to be able to post whatever they want
without feeling that someone opposed to their views is lurking in the
shadows, ready to take a potshot whenever anybody says something that I
might think wrong or far-fetched or silly. I want them to have fun and to
feel comfortable enough to say whatever they like about Oxford or
Shakespeare or whatever else comes up. I have no wish to dominate the SF
forum or to change the point of view of the SF or to make people there
less comfortable.

The SF has very generously invited me to their meetings (I will be
performing twice at the October SF-Fest in Baltimore -- three times, if my
dancing bear recovers in time), and has tolerated my occasional posts on
their forums. There are Oxfordian forums where I am not welcome at all; I
appreciate the willingness of the SF to allow me to exchange views with
its members, but I will not press those views when I know my doing so has
become irritating to the SF.

I gave my word that I will not discuss it on the SF forum, and I have not
mentioned Price on the SF forums since last December; I don't think my
views would be any more welcome today then they were last year. I
recently posted on an issue related to Price's work, but I was careful not
to mention Price's view of the precise matter on which I posted.

Does this mean that the SF is guilty of some kind of horrible censorship?
Not really -- as I have said, I am essentially censoring myself. It is
common in moderated forums for a moderator to say &quot;exchanges on this issue
have gone on long enough,&quot; and to close discussion. I belong to several
lists or forums where some topics are completely ruled out -- e.g., on
some lists devoted to birding, questions about pet birds and squirrels are
not welcome. On SHAKSPER, discussions whether Bacon or Oxford or Marlowe
or Derby or Dyer or the Countess of Pembroke was the &quot;real&quot; author are not
welcome. I favor these limitations. There is no shortage of outlets for
the expression of views on these matters, and I see no reason why every
list or forum should declare itself open to anything anybody wishes to
say.

I only mentioned the SF discussion about Price here because Lynne
said,

What was exhausted on the SF forum was not the discussion of Price's book
but the willingness to hear further from me on that subject.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; P.S. Dan Wright has done some preliminary work to show that Wilmot was

&gt;&gt;&gt; Really? What evidence to that effect has he unearthed?

&gt;&gt; David, surely you have heard of the Wilmot Reviso?

&gt; Good one, Terry!

&gt; But seriously (or at last as seriously as befits h.l.a.s.), are you
&gt; aware of the supposed &quot;preliminary work&quot; of Prof. Dr. Wright to which
&gt; Ken so tersely alludes? Is it as pertinent to Shakespeare authorship as
&gt; the Wilmot Proviso?

"/>

I am not aware of any such &quot;preliminary work.&quot; The original report of
James Wilmot's belief that Shakespeare's works were written by Bacon was
delivered by James Corton Cowell to the Ipswich Philosophic Society in
1806 (see Schoenbaum, *Shakespeare's Lives*, p. 399). The manuscripts of
Cowell's remarks to the society eventually went to the University of
London Library. I don't know whether Wright has looked at Cowell's actual
manuscripts, but that would seem to be the first step in any &quot;preliminary
work.&quot; The first published account of Cowell's report on Wilmot was made
by Allardyce Nicoll in the *TLS* in 1932.

Nicoll was not a Baconian, of course, so presumably the way the fable is
supposed to work is that some Baconian or other forged Cowell's
manuscripts and then just left them alone in the hope that somebody would
stumble over them some day, and that chump Nicoll was the useful idiot.
Perhaps Ken could enlighten us.

The Wilmot Proviso, as fans of American legislative history will know, was
a proposal that slavery should not be extended to the territories that the
United States acquired from Mexico after the Mexican War. The Wilmot in
question was David Wilmot, a member of the House from Pennsylvania.

The Wilmot RE-viso is a term of my own coining. James Wilmot seems to
have been the first person who clearly expressed the opinion that
Shakespeare did NOT and that somebody else DID write the works commonly
attributed to Shakespeare. Some Oxfordians may prefer to believe that the
first antistratfordians thought Oxford was the &quot;real author,&quot; but I know
of nobody before Thomas Looney who argued that the one &quot;real author&quot; of
Shakespeare's works was Oxford. Oxfordians have tried their darndest to
misread such texts as Robert Plumer Ward's novel *De Vere, or the Man of
Independence* or Melville's *Billy Budd* or Isaac Disraeli's brief essay
about Oxford (which chiefly concerns the &quot;fart&quot; anecdote) as if any of
these writers thought Oxford was the &quot;real&quot; Shakespeare.

The following falsehood appears on one of the SF pages (it is, of course,
not the only falsehood on the site): &quot;The anonymous novel, *De Vere, or
the Man of Independence*, by Robert Plumer Ward, proposes in fictional
form that Edward de Vere was the real mind behind the mask of
Shakespeare.&quot;

Ward's *De Vere* is a three-volume novel -- a very tough slog, by the way
-- that may be of some interest to literary historians as an early example
of the political novel. Trollope he ain't. What he also ain't is an
Oxfordian. I know of no passage anywhere in this long novel where either
Ward or any of his characters says that William Shakespeare did not and
that the 17th Earl of Oxford did write the works commonly attributed to
Shakespeare. In fact, the 17th earl is not even a character in the novel,
which is set centuries later than his time. The novel's title character
is descended from the earl, but does not say that his progenitor wrote
*Hamlet* or *Venus and Adonis* or even so much as a single line that has
generally been attributed to Shakespeare. Neither Ward nor any character
in the novel ever suggests that ANYBODY other than Shakespeare wrote the
works of Shakespeare. What we might now think of as the &quot;Shakespeare
authorship&quot; matter never arises in volume 1, never arises in volume 2,
never arises in volume 3.

To date there has been no term for the Oxfordian attempt to twist
pre-Looney writers into proto-Oxfordians. The practice resembles the
Mormon custom of &quot;proxy baptism&quot; of one's non-Mormon ancestors. If it is
true, as Ken claims, that there is an Oxfordian attempt to deny Wilmot
credit for being the first Baconian, then if we combine that project with
the &quot;proxy baptism&quot; of Robert Plumer Ward and Herman Melville as
proto-Oxfordians we get the &quot;Wilmot Reviso&quot;: a revisionist history of
antistratfordianism which holds that the first antistratfordians were
Oxfordians. While the Wilmot Proviso would have mandated that slavery not
be extended into the territories purchased from Mexico, the Wilmot Reviso
would propose that Oxfordianism SHOULD be extended backwards in time while
the roots of Baconism should be snuffed out.

&gt;&gt;&gt; have to go through the committee and receive a majority vote. And it

&gt;&gt; Lynne, the request was made by one of the SF administrators in a Forum
&gt;&gt; post timestamped &quot;11/12/2003 20:09&quot; on the thread &quot;Re: HLAS threads on
&gt;&gt; Price.&quot; Neither you nor any other member of the SF seemed to think the
&gt;&gt; request was out of order, and in deference to the request I said, &quot;I
will
&gt;&gt; defer to your wishes and move on&quot; (see my post on the same thread that
was
&gt;&gt; timestamped &quot;12/12/2003 06:26&quot;).

&gt; Lynne has now moved the posts in question to the subscriber-only area.

No, Terry's was part of an entirely different conversation, which I have now
found (after some trouble) and checked. This was a personal suggestion on
the part of one administrator, who then said he'd asked Terry to take his
quibbles somewhere else. Terry and the administrator involved had recently
had a falling out at tennis. ;)

I replied, &quot;I actually like hearing everyone's quibbles (if they can be
termed that), as long as people are reasonably polite...&quot; which was my
mouselike way of diffusing the situation. Neufer then replied to me, and
Terry to him, rather lightheartedly, I thought, on the subject of quibbles,
and I believed everything was copasetic. I had no idea that Terry really
thought he was censored. To do that would take all four administrators and
Terry would be in no doubt of it. He would receive a private message.

TERRY, YOU ARE NOT CENSORED.

In fact, as far as I remember, Terry has never been censored on our boards,
although I have written to someone else and asked him to censor himself as
he had suggested that Terry was a liar simply because he was not an
Oxfordian.

I moved the new posts on Price to the subscriber section after asking
everyone posting on the subject if they had any problem with my doing so and
speaking to the other administrators to get approval. I gave reasons in my
post. That certainly wasn't censorship, it was just that there were so many
posts and threads on the subject they were drowning all the general stuff
which is more for newbies. Ms. Price is neither an Oxfordian nor a member of
the Shakespeare Fellowship. It may be rather daunting for newcomers to come
to our site and see miles and miles of posts on her position in the
authorship debate.

I trust this clarifies the matter--hopefully to everybody's satisfaction.
Though I doubt it. :(

Best wishes,
Lynne

&gt; TR

&gt;&gt; The SF forum is a different kind of critter from hlas. At hlas,
anything
&gt;&gt; goes, including quite a few things that I wish had NOT gone. The SF
forum
&gt;&gt; is managed by and for Oxfordians. The issue is not one of any
censorship
&gt;&gt; being imposed on me -- I am, if anything, self-censoring on the SF
forum.
&gt;&gt; I think the members of the SF ought to be able to post whatever they
want
&gt;&gt; without feeling that someone opposed to their views is lurking in the
&gt;&gt; shadows, ready to take a potshot whenever anybody says something that I
&gt;&gt; might think wrong or far-fetched or silly. I want them to have fun and
to
&gt;&gt; feel comfortable enough to say whatever they like about Oxford or
&gt;&gt; Shakespeare or whatever else comes up. I have no wish to dominate the
SF
&gt;&gt; forum or to change the point of view of the SF or to make people there
&gt;&gt; less comfortable.

&gt;&gt; The SF has very generously invited me to their meetings (I will be
&gt;&gt; performing twice at the October SF-Fest in Baltimore -- three times, if
my
&gt;&gt; dancing bear recovers in time), and has tolerated my occasional posts on
&gt;&gt; their forums. There are Oxfordian forums where I am not welcome at all;
I
&gt;&gt; appreciate the willingness of the SF to allow me to exchange views with
&gt;&gt; its members, but I will not press those views when I know my doing so
has
&gt;&gt; become irritating to the SF.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I'm amazed that when this happened I didn't speak up--Did I, Terry?--
&gt;&gt;&gt; unless I was indisposed at the time. This sounds more like a spat, or
a
&gt;&gt;&gt; word spoken out of annoyance. Terry, one of the people whose
scholarship
&gt;&gt;&gt; I admire most, is always welcome on our boards. I miss his presence of
&gt;&gt;&gt; late. I again invite him to discuss Diana Price's work. As I said
&gt;&gt;&gt; before, it's on the &quot;State of the Debate&quot; thread.

&gt;&gt; I gave my word that I will not discuss it on the SF forum, and I have
not
&gt;&gt; mentioned Price on the SF forums since last December; I don't think my
&gt;&gt; views would be any more welcome today then they were last year. I
&gt;&gt; recently posted on an issue related to Price's work, but I was careful
not
&gt;&gt; to mention Price's view of the precise matter on which I posted.

&gt;&gt; Does this mean that the SF is guilty of some kind of horrible
censorship?
&gt;&gt; Not really -- as I have said, I am essentially censoring myself. It is
&gt;&gt; common in moderated forums for a moderator to say &quot;exchanges on this
issue
&gt;&gt; have gone on long enough,&quot; and to close discussion. I belong to several
&gt;&gt; lists or forums where some topics are completely ruled out -- e.g., on
&gt;&gt; some lists devoted to birding, questions about pet birds and squirrels
are
&gt;&gt; not welcome. On SHAKSPER, discussions whether Bacon or Oxford or
Marlowe
&gt;&gt; or Derby or Dyer or the Countess of Pembroke was the &quot;real&quot; author are
not
&gt;&gt; welcome. I favor these limitations. There is no shortage of outlets
for
&gt;&gt; the expression of views on these matters, and I see no reason why every
&gt;&gt; list or forum should declare itself open to anything anybody wishes to
&gt;&gt; say.

&gt;&gt; I only mentioned the SF discussion about Price here because Lynne
&gt;&gt; said,

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I believe you and I and likely some others discussed it on the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Fellowship boards, although not exhaustively.

&gt;&gt; What was exhausted on the SF forum was not the discussion of Price's
book
&gt;&gt; but the willingness to hear further from me on that subject.

I was actually talking about Davies' poem. I think we crossed wires. But the

Let me correct what I said earlier --

Ward's *De Vere* is a FOUR-volume novel -- a very tough slog, by the way

of the political novel. Trollope he ain't. What he also ain't is an
Oxfordian. I know of no passage anywhere in this long novel where either
Ward or any of his characters says that William Shakespeare did not and
that the 17th Earl of Oxford did write the works commonly attributed to
Shakespeare. In fact, the 17th earl is not even a character in the novel,
which is set centuries later than his time. The novel's title character
is descended from the earl, but does not say that his progenitor wrote
*Hamlet* or *Venus and Adonis* or even so much as a single line that has
generally been attributed to Shakespeare. Neither Ward nor any character
in the novel ever suggests that ANYBODY other than Shakespeare wrote the
works of Shakespeare. What we might now think of as the &quot;Shakespeare
authorship&quot; matter never arises in volume 1, never arises in volume 2,
never arises in volume 3, never arises in volume 4.

Lynne, since you are the proud owner of all four volumes, perhaps you
could type up the exact passage where Ward (according to the SF) &quot;proposes
in fictional form that Edward de Vere was the real mind behind the mask of
Shakespeare.&quot;

I'm no expert, Terry, as you very well know. I don't believe he does, not in
any outright way, at least; however, if I remember correctly, although the
story is about a de Vere, a descendant of the 17th earl, there are many
Shakespeare quotations throughout, and almost all the chapter headings are
followed by Shakespeare quotes. I only got through volume two, not being as
much of a slogger as you, although I may go back to it, so it's quite
possible there is an authorship nugget of gold further on.

My guess is that Oxfordians would say that Oxford's authorship is hinted at
because the character is, as it were, surrounded by Shakespeare. And the
Earl of Oxford is mentioned more than once, at least as I remember it.
Rather strange in a nineteenth century novel. There is also something about
his being a great poet. If you push me, I will go and look for the exact
quote. Sigh. And my husband Michael (who is much more diligent than I and
read the whole thing) has just reminded me that there are parallels between
Mortimer and Edward. Mortimer is supposed to have written a masque, etc. I
can offer nothing conclusive, but the subject is rather intriguing.

&gt; Terry to take his quibbles somewhere else. Terry and the administrator

"/>

The &quot;personal suggestion&quot; was more in the nature of a public rebuke, but I
don't believe I did anything to provoke it except to present my views on
Price. It was the airing of those views on SF that was the problem.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; I replied, &quot;I actually like hearing everyone's quibbles (if they can

It was indeed, and it still is -- I gave my promise not to discuss Price's
work on the SF forums; I have kept that promise; I will continue to keep
that promise. There were responses generated by the post in which I gave
my promise that claimed my arguments on Price were nothing but quibbles,
but having given my word I could not, of course, offer any defence to
those responses. On the other hand, to leave the SF forums or to remain
completely silent might give the impression that I resented being put in
the situation of having to give such a promise. By posting soon after on a
side issue (what Samuel Johnson said of Shakespeare's doting on quibbles)
I meant not only to provide a bit of context for Art's post (without
mentioning Price or going anywhere near the issues in her book) but also
to show that I was not sulking, and that the request that I say nothing
further on Price was not a problem for me. I did not want the tiny matter
of whether my views on Price were welcome on SF to become an issue; I did
not want people voting or taking sides or feeling ill at ease either
because of my views on Price or because those views were not welcome.
Now, unfortunately, this remarkably trivial matter has arisen here, but it
will soon fade away, and there will not even be a flagging of the trees to
show that it ever existed.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I had no idea that Terry really thought he was censored. To do that

I don't want anybody to think I consider myself a victim of censorship (or
of anything else). As I said before, if there is any censoring in this
instance, it is my own self-censorship out of consideration for the SF.

I did not say that I was -- the SF forum may not be a place where my views
on Price's work are welcome, but that does not mean I have no outlet for
those views, and it does not mean that my views on other subjects are

welcome on the SF, I could not discuss them there without going back on my
word.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; In fact, as far as I remember, Terry has never been censored on our
&gt; boards, although I have written to someone else and asked him to censor
&gt; himself as he had suggested that Terry was a liar simply because he was
&gt; not an Oxfordian.

There's another matter that need not have made it to hlas. Since it has,
let me say that I was glad that Lynne and others among my fellows defended
me in a situation where I did not particularly care to defend myself, and
it is partly because of her and their consideration in that instance that
I deferred to the request that I cease posting on Price. Until now, I had
been successful at keeping my word without making the keeping of that word
an issue for anybody but myself. If nobody at SF noticed that I have said
nothing about Price since last year, that was all to the good as far as I
was concerned.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; I moved the new posts on Price to the subscriber section after asking
&gt; everyone posting on the subject if they had any problem with my doing so
&gt; and speaking to the other administrators to get approval. I gave reasons
&gt; in my post. That certainly wasn't censorship, it was just that there
&gt; were so many posts and threads on the subject they were drowning all the
&gt; general stuff which is more for newbies. Ms. Price is neither an
&gt; Oxfordian nor a member of the Shakespeare Fellowship. It may be rather
&gt; daunting for newcomers to come to our site and see miles and miles of
&gt; posts on her position in the authorship debate.

&gt; I trust this clarifies the matter--hopefully to everybody's satisfaction.
&gt; Though I doubt it. :(

I would rather not have anybody try to use this matter against the SF.

I've been away from HLAS again. Just looked at this one post and found it
interesting. LynnE recently pushed threads I'm involved in about Price to a
private forum. I agreed to it, and have no problem with it. I assume that I'll
be able to re-post any of my better comments here or elsewhere if I want to.

It does seem to me that Price is a sacred cow at the Fellowship. I've been
about the only Gulielmus-Affirmer (yes, new name) there over the past year or
so. Buffalo showed up for a while, Terry made a few but not many posts, and
someone else posted six texts attempting to show that Oxford could not have
written the Ouevre. That, as far as I know, was it.

Anyway, I haven't been censored, but pretty strongly denounced, mainly by Roger.
Especially when I finally started seriously to take on Price's book. I had it
coming to a certain degree because I did accuse her of not being a scholar. An
exaggeration I thought anyone would understand to mean that I felt she was
wrong, and perhaps an imperfect scholar but not truly a non-scholar. I have
otherwise been fairly well-behaved, but have been honest in acknowledging that
I'm writing a book about what I take to be the mental dysfunction some
Gulielmus-Rejectors are afflicted with. (They accuse me right and left of the
mental dysfunctionality of &quot;denial&quot; while I haven't accused any of them
personally of any dysfunctionality that I know of, but that's the way it goes
among Gulielmus-Rejectors.)

At the Fellowship, I feel I've been continually challenged to respond to the
&quot;significant arguments&quot; for Gulielmus-Rejection forwarded by Price instead of
arguing the various things I argued--such as the fact that the Oxfordians have
not worked out a good scenario for their man. (I got them working on one that
is an improvement on what they had but still has defects; most of them
blithefully assume they don't need a scenario that makes sense, or so it seems
to me; only four or five argue with me, and only two in a sustained, serious
way--Willedever and Ken K.) So I finally started a discussion about her ten
evidence bins. Now, I'm trying to define what she means by &quot;personal evidence.&quot;
It's interesting, but frustrating. I [i]did[/i] finally realize Dooley was sort
of right about something a long time ago I thought he was insanely wrong
about--but it's too convoluted to go into again. It's about a kind of personal
evidence he said existed and I couldn't understand. I discuss it in my
&quot;personal evidence&quot; thread at the Fellowship--which will eventually become part
of a full analysis of Price's book, I hope. If so, I'll post it here.

I was wondering why Terry never entered the fray and now know why. He [i]i[/i]
re-post something of his that Ken K. was wondering about, and misrepresenting.
I suspect he's made all the arguments I'm now making, and then some.

Apologies for the long post, and for jumping into a thread without knowing
what's been said previously.

&gt; way

&gt;&gt;&gt; Yes. Mine is four volumes. Perhaps you misplaced one?

&gt;&gt; No, I returned the 4th along with volumes 1, 2, and 3 to the library
some
&gt;&gt; time ago -- I guess it was even more of a slog than I had remembered.
&gt;&gt; Let me correct what I said earlier --

&gt; You sly fox, you. ;)

&gt;&gt; Ward's *De Vere* is a FOUR-volume novel -- a very tough slog, by the way
&gt;&gt; -- that may be of some interest to literary historians as an early
example
&gt;&gt; of the political novel. Trollope he ain't. What he also ain't is an
&gt;&gt; Oxfordian. I know of no passage anywhere in this long novel where
either
&gt;&gt; Ward or any of his characters says that William Shakespeare did not and
&gt;&gt; that the 17th Earl of Oxford did write the works commonly attributed to
&gt;&gt; Shakespeare. In fact, the 17th earl is not even a character in the
novel,
&gt;&gt; which is set centuries later than his time. The novel's title character
&gt;&gt; is descended from the earl, but does not say that his progenitor wrote
&gt;&gt; *Hamlet* or *Venus and Adonis* or even so much as a single line that has
&gt;&gt; generally been attributed to Shakespeare. Neither Ward nor any
character
&gt;&gt; in the novel ever suggests that ANYBODY other than Shakespeare wrote the
&gt;&gt; works of Shakespeare. What we might now think of as the &quot;Shakespeare
&gt;&gt; authorship&quot; matter never arises in volume 1, never arises in volume 2,
&gt;&gt; never arises in volume 3, never arises in volume 4.

&gt;&gt; Lynne, since you are the proud owner of all four volumes, perhaps you
&gt;&gt; could type up the exact passage where Ward (according to the SF)
&quot;proposes
&gt;&gt; in fictional form that Edward de Vere was the real mind behind the mask
of
&gt;&gt; Shakespeare.&quot;

&gt; I'm no expert, Terry, as you very well know. I don't believe he does, not
in
&gt; any outright way, at least; however, if I remember correctly, although the
&gt; story is about a de Vere, a descendant of the 17th earl, there are many
&gt; Shakespeare quotations throughout, and almost all the chapter headings are
&gt; followed by Shakespeare quotes. I only got through volume two, not being
as
&gt; much of a slogger as you, although I may go back to it, so it's quite
&gt; possible there is an authorship nugget of gold further on.

"/>

There is a faster way, of course, which is to ask the person responsible for
the item on the SF website. If they made the assertion, they must have the
evidence to support it. Then you can give chapter and verse without having
to slog through all four volumes of that (allegedly) unreadable novel.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Really? What evidence to that effect has he unearthed?

&gt;&gt;&gt; David, surely you have heard of the Wilmot Reviso?

&gt;&gt; Good one, Terry!

&gt;&gt; But seriously (or at last as seriously as befits h.l.a.s.), are you
&gt;&gt; aware of the supposed &quot;preliminary work&quot; of Prof. Dr. Wright to which
&gt;&gt; Ken so tersely alludes? Is it as pertinent to Shakespeare authorship as
&gt;&gt; the Wilmot Proviso?

&gt; I am not aware of any such &quot;preliminary work.&quot; The original report of
&gt; James Wilmot's belief that Shakespeare's works were written by Bacon was
&gt; delivered by James Corton Cowell to the Ipswich Philosophic Society in
&gt; 1806 (see Schoenbaum, *Shakespeare's Lives*, p. 399). The manuscripts of
&gt; Cowell's remarks to the society eventually went to the University of
&gt; London Library. I don't know whether Wright has looked at Cowell's actual
&gt; manuscripts, but that would seem to be the first step in any &quot;preliminary
&gt; work.&quot; The first published account of Cowell's report on Wilmot was made
&gt; by Allardyce Nicoll in the *TLS* in 1932.

&gt; Nicoll was not a Baconian, of course, so presumably the way the fable is
&gt; supposed to work is that some Baconian or other forged Cowell's
&gt; manuscripts and then just left them alone in the hope that somebody would
&gt; stumble over them some day, and that chump Nicoll was the useful idiot.
&gt; Perhaps Ken could enlighten us.

&gt; The Wilmot Proviso, as fans of American legislative history will know, was
&gt; a proposal that slavery should not be extended to the territories that the
&gt; United States acquired from Mexico after the Mexican War. The Wilmot in
&gt; question was David Wilmot, a member of the House from Pennsylvania.

&gt; The Wilmot RE-viso is a term of my own coining. James Wilmot seems to
&gt; have been the first person who clearly expressed the opinion that
&gt; Shakespeare did NOT and that somebody else DID write the works commonly
&gt; attributed to Shakespeare. Some Oxfordians may prefer to believe that the
&gt; first antistratfordians thought Oxford was the &quot;real author,&quot; but I know
&gt; of nobody before Thomas Looney who argued that the one &quot;real author&quot; of
&gt; Shakespeare's works was Oxford. Oxfordians have tried their darndest to
&gt; misread such texts as Robert Plumer Ward's novel *De Vere, or the Man of
&gt; Independence* or Melville's *Billy Budd* or Isaac Disraeli's brief essay
&gt; about Oxford (which chiefly concerns the &quot;fart&quot; anecdote) as if any of
&gt; these writers thought Oxford was the &quot;real&quot; Shakespeare.

&gt; The following falsehood appears on one of the SF pages (it is, of course,
&gt; not the only falsehood on the site): &quot;The anonymous novel, *De Vere, or
&gt; the Man of Independence*, by Robert Plumer Ward, proposes in fictional
&gt; form that Edward de Vere was the real mind behind the mask of
&gt; Shakespeare.&quot;

&gt; http://www.shakespearefellowship.org/virtualclassroom/historyofdoubt.htm

&gt; Ward's *De Vere* is a three-volume novel -- a very tough slog, by the way
&gt; -- that may be of some interest to literary historians as an early example
&gt; of the political novel. Trollope he ain't. What he also ain't is an
&gt; Oxfordian. I know of no passage anywhere in this long novel where either
&gt; Ward or any of his characters says that William Shakespeare did not and
&gt; that the 17th Earl of Oxford did write the works commonly attributed to
&gt; Shakespeare. In fact, the 17th earl is not even a character in the novel,
&gt; which is set centuries later than his time. The novel's title character
&gt; is descended from the earl, but does not say that his progenitor wrote
&gt; *Hamlet* or *Venus and Adonis* or even so much as a single line that has
&gt; generally been attributed to Shakespeare. Neither Ward nor any character
&gt; in the novel ever suggests that ANYBODY other than Shakespeare wrote the
&gt; works of Shakespeare. What we might now think of as the &quot;Shakespeare
&gt; authorship&quot; matter never arises in volume 1, never arises in volume 2,
&gt; never arises in volume 3.

&gt; To date there has been no term for the Oxfordian attempt to twist
&gt; pre-Looney writers into proto-Oxfordians. The practice resembles the
&gt; Mormon custom of &quot;proxy baptism&quot; of one's non-Mormon ancestors. If it is
&gt; true, as Ken claims, that there is an Oxfordian attempt to deny Wilmot
&gt; credit for being the first Baconian, then if we combine that project with
&gt; the &quot;proxy baptism&quot; of Robert Plumer Ward and Herman Melville as
&gt; proto-Oxfordians we get the &quot;Wilmot Reviso&quot;: a revisionist history of
&gt; antistratfordianism which holds that the first antistratfordians were
&gt; Oxfordians. While the Wilmot Proviso would have mandated that slavery not
&gt; be extended into the territories purchased from Mexico, the Wilmot Reviso
&gt; would propose that Oxfordianism SHOULD be extended backwards in time while
&gt; the roots of Baconism should be snuffed out.

Thanks yet again Terry for contributing to hlas's rather high
misinformation level.And you,to a lesser extent,Ken. Oh what a tangled
Webb we weave...
The alleged discovery of the forgery respecting James Wilmot came
from John Rollett,not Daniel Wright.Dr. Rollett had spent better than
a year following up the clues and announced his conclusions in some
detail to a strictly closed forum to which Dr.Wright occasionally
contributes.Wright ,following his trip to England,pronounced that
Rollett was entirely correct.And I gather a joint announcement was to
be made(was it?).According to both men the alleged transcript of the
Ipswich speech at the University of London appears to be of clearly
twentieth century origin and Rollett,after extensive research in early
nineteenth archives, has found no trace of the existence of either
Cowell or the Ipswich
Philosophic Society.
That Schoenbaum mistates ,or is ignorant of, key facts in the
Nicoll case as he is in the Roderick Eagle case,the Hester Dowden
case,the Abraham Bronson Feldman case,the Richard Simpson case,the
George Buc case,the E.H.C.Oliphant case, and many,many,other cases too
numerous for citation here, need occasion no surprise.

It is,however, surprising to find the gentle and truly scholarly
Allardyce Nicoll being used as a dupe in the affair. As I myself
utilized some of the Nicoll material(Elizabethan Review,l997)
concerning Wilmott's alleged discovery of a Bacon passport ,I would be
delighted to see it reauthenticated but this does not, at the moment
,appear to be the most probable course of coming events.
Meanwhile John Rollett has behaved with all due caution in the affair
and has not addressed one abusive word in respect to Dr.Nicoll's
seeming error.You, Terry,in the finast hlas tradition, are the first
to intemperately state &quot;that chump Nicoll was the useful idiot&quot;. Come
now,may be historian Nicoll just lacked physical scientist Rollett's
expertise on early nineteenth century paper making,should Rollett
prove to be correct.

And further,I suspect that Terry will eventually find that the
first discovery was made in the earlier l920's ,not l932. In fact I
vaguely recall that I corrected my original misdating of the Nicoll
article to a period shortly after its discovery. There was,in fact,
most of a decade in between the two events. And it would surprise
me(for I am far from my own notes on the subject) if Terry is correct
in his assertion that Nicoll was the first one involved to touch those
archives.Meanwhile,stay cool TR.

authorship as the Wilmot Proviso?&quot;

To which I replied, &quot;I am not aware of any such 'preliminary work.'&quot; I
then summarized Schoenbaum's account of the Wilmot/Cowell story, giving
not only the page number in Schoenbaum, but also mentioning Schoenbaum's
source, Allardyce Nicoll.

If you are right, then Ken was wrong.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Dr. Rollett had spent better than a year following up the clues and
&gt; announced his conclusions in some detail to a strictly closed forum to
&gt; which Dr. Wright occasionally contributes.

I hope you won't be in trouble for spilling the beans.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Wright, following his trip to England, pronounced that Rollett was

I can find no trace of any such announcement on the Internet, even in
Oxfordian forums that are not &quot;strictly closed&quot; to me.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; According to both men the alleged transcript of the Ipswich speech at
&gt; the University of London appears to be of clearly twentieth century
&gt; origin and Rollett, after extensive research in early nineteenth
&gt; archives, has found no trace of the existence of either Cowell or the
&gt; Ipswich Philosophic Society.

"/>

Well, that's fun, isn't it. I did say, &quot;I don't know whether Wright has
looked at Cowell's actual manuscripts, but that would seem to be the first
step in any &quot;'preliminary work.'&quot; According to your account, it appears
that Rollett did indeed do some looking, which is good to hear.

Rollett has made at least one very useful find that I know of -- noticing
the reference to Elizabeth as &quot;an ever-living Empress&quot; in *Polimanteia*.
On the other hand, he also thought he had found Oxfordian ciphers in the
dedication to *Shakespeare's Sonnets*, and even though he is no longer an
Oxfordian, he is reluctant to give up the ciphers. Rollett thought the
difference between Shakespeare's relative fondness for &quot;since&quot; and
Oxford's for &quot;sith&quot; was almost enough by itself to rule out Oxford as the
author of Shakespeare's works -- he has a point, but probably overstated
its importance. Since I know nothing about what he may have found in this
instance (beyond what you have told me), it is, of course, impossible to
evaluate it, but I do hope he will make his announcement soon so that his
claims can be reviewed by experts.

By the way, there DOES appear to be a &quot;trace of the existence&quot; of the
&quot;Ipswich Philosophical Society.&quot; According the the National Register of
Archives in the UK, the Ipswich branch of the Suffolk Record Office has
the &quot;minutes, corresp, accounts and papers&quot; of the Ipswich Philosophical
Society; the collection covers the years 1849-72:

Nicoll's account, according to Schoenbaum, places Cowell's report quite a
bit earlier than 1849; I hope Rollett's &quot;extensive research&quot; included a
look at the Ipswich Philosophical Society collection.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; That Schoenbaum misstates ,or is ignorant of, key facts in the Nicoll

&gt; citation here, need occasion no surprise.

"/>

Schoenbaum cited the sources he relied on; I haven't checked to see
whether he misstated what Nicoll said. I gather Rollett's point is not
that Schoenbaum was wrong but that Nicoll was.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; It is,however, surprising to find the gentle and truly scholarly
&gt; Allardyce Nicoll being used as a dupe in the affair.

"/>

But used as a &quot;dupe&quot; by whom? Does Rollett think some Baconian tipped him
to the existence of the Cowell material? What was Nicoll's account of how
this material came to his attention?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; As I myself utilized some of the Nicoll material(Elizabethan

I haven't heard enough to agree or disagree; let's hope Rollett reveals

&gt; now,may be historian Nicoll just lacked physical scientist Rollett's
&gt; expertise on early nineteenth century paper making,should Rollett prove
&gt; to be correct.

"/>

Actually, Roger, it is your own misreading that is giving you grief. Let
me quote my words:

&quot;Nicoll was not a Baconian, of course, so presumably the way the fable is
supposed to work is that some Baconian or other forged Cowell's
manuscripts and then just left them alone in the hope that somebody would
stumble over them some day, and that chump Nicoll was the useful idiot.
Perhaps Ken could enlighten us.&quot;

Did you miss the words &quot;presumably the way the fable is supposed to work&quot;?

You must be familiar with the term &quot;useful idiot,&quot; which is generally
credited to Lenin, and is used to refer to someone who unwittingly
advances an ideology he opposes. Within the possible &quot;fable&quot; that I
sketched, such would be Nicoll's role.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; And further,I suspect that Terry will eventually find that the first
&gt; discovery was made in the earlier l920's ,not l932.

"/>

Roger, you really should attend to the actual words that are before you
when you read. I said nothing about the date of &quot;the first discovery&quot;; I
said, &quot;The first published account of Cowell's report on Wilmot was made
by Allardyce Nicoll in the *TLS* in 1932.&quot; My source for this information
was Schoenbaum, but other sources say the same thing.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; In fact I vaguely recall that I corrected my original misdating of the
&gt; Nicoll article to a period shortly after its discovery. There was,in
&gt; fact, most of a decade in between the two events. And it would surprise
&gt; me(for I am far from my own notes on the subject) if Terry is correct in
&gt; his assertion that Nicoll was the first one involved to touch those
&gt; archives.

"/>

I made no such assertion -- you really need to pay more careful attention,
Roger. A Baconian essay dated 1933 contains this interesting tidbit about
an earlier &quot;touch[ing of] those archives&quot;:

&quot;In the *Times Literary Supplement* of 25th February, 1932, Professor
Allardyce Nicholl tells a story which should profoundly interest every
Baconian student. Just before his death, Sir E. Durning Lawrence obtained
and bequeathed to the London University a 'thin quarto volume,' containing
in manuscript the text of an address entitled 'Some reflections on the
life of William Shakespeare,' read before the Ipswich Philosophical
Society by James Cowell on 7th February, 1805.&quot;

See

Unlike Nicoll, Edwin Durning-Lawrence certainly was a Baconian; his
library (which I presume would have included the volume in question) &quot;was
bequeathed to the London University Library by Lady Durning-Lawrence in
1929.&quot;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Meanwhile, stay cool TR.

Cool as can be; thanks for the additional details -- if it becomes
permissible, please let us know more about this very interesting tale.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; David, surely you have heard of the Wilmot Reviso?
&gt;&gt;&gt; Good one, Terry!

&gt;&gt;&gt; Ken so tersely alludes? Is it as pertinent to Shakespeare authorship as
&gt;&gt;&gt; the Wilmot Proviso?
&gt;&gt; I am not aware of any such &quot;preliminary work.&quot; The original report of
&gt;&gt; James Wilmot's belief that Shakespeare's works were written by Bacon was
&gt;&gt; delivered by James Corton Cowell to the Ipswich Philosophic Society in
&gt;&gt; 1806 (see Schoenbaum, *Shakespeare's Lives*, p. 399). The manuscripts of
&gt;&gt; Cowell's remarks to the society eventually went to the University of
&gt;&gt; London Library. I don't know whether Wright has looked at Cowell's actual
&gt;&gt; manuscripts, but that would seem to be the first step in any &quot;preliminary
&gt;&gt; work.&quot; The first published account of Cowell's report on Wilmot was made
&gt;&gt; by Allardyce Nicoll in the *TLS* in 1932.

&gt;&gt; Nicoll was not a Baconian, of course, so presumably the way the fable is
&gt;&gt; supposed to work is that some Baconian or other forged Cowell's
&gt;&gt; manuscripts and then just left them alone in the hope that somebody would
&gt;&gt; stumble over them some day, and that chump Nicoll was the useful idiot.
&gt;&gt; Perhaps Ken could enlighten us.

&gt;&gt; The Wilmot Proviso, as fans of American legislative history will know, was
&gt;&gt; a proposal that slavery should not be extended to the territories that the
&gt;&gt; United States acquired from Mexico after the Mexican War. The Wilmot in
&gt;&gt; question was David Wilmot, a member of the House from Pennsylvania.

&gt;&gt; The Wilmot RE-viso is a term of my own coining. James Wilmot seems to
&gt;&gt; have been the first person who clearly expressed the opinion that
&gt;&gt; Shakespeare did NOT and that somebody else DID write the works commonly
&gt;&gt; attributed to Shakespeare. Some Oxfordians may prefer to believe that the
&gt;&gt; first antistratfordians thought Oxford was the &quot;real author,&quot; but I know
&gt;&gt; of nobody before Thomas Looney who argued that the one &quot;real author&quot; of
&gt;&gt; Shakespeare's works was Oxford. Oxfordians have tried their darndest to
&gt;&gt; misread such texts as Robert Plumer Ward's novel *De Vere, or the Man of
&gt;&gt; Independence* or Melville's *Billy Budd* or Isaac Disraeli's brief essay
&gt;&gt; about Oxford (which chiefly concerns the &quot;fart&quot; anecdote) as if any of
&gt;&gt; these writers thought Oxford was the &quot;real&quot; Shakespeare.

&gt;&gt; The following falsehood appears on one of the SF pages (it is, of course,
&gt;&gt; not the only falsehood on the site): &quot;The anonymous novel, *De Vere, or
&gt;&gt; the Man of Independence*, by Robert Plumer Ward, proposes in fictional
&gt;&gt; form that Edward de Vere was the real mind behind the mask of
&gt;&gt; Shakespeare.&quot;

&gt;&gt; http://www.shakespearefellowship.org/virtualclassroom/historyofdoubt.htm

&gt;&gt; Ward's *De Vere* is a three-volume novel -- a very tough slog, by the way
&gt;&gt; -- that may be of some interest to literary historians as an early example
&gt;&gt; of the political novel. Trollope he ain't. What he also ain't is an
&gt;&gt; Oxfordian. I know of no passage anywhere in this long novel where either
&gt;&gt; Ward or any of his characters says that William Shakespeare did not and
&gt;&gt; that the 17th Earl of Oxford did write the works commonly attributed to
&gt;&gt; Shakespeare. In fact, the 17th earl is not even a character in the novel,
&gt;&gt; which is set centuries later than his time. The novel's title character
&gt;&gt; is descended from the earl, but does not say that his progenitor wrote
&gt;&gt; *Hamlet* or *Venus and Adonis* or even so much as a single line that has
&gt;&gt; generally been attributed to Shakespeare. Neither Ward nor any character
&gt;&gt; in the novel ever suggests that ANYBODY other than Shakespeare wrote the
&gt;&gt; works of Shakespeare. What we might now think of as the &quot;Shakespeare
&gt;&gt; authorship&quot; matter never arises in volume 1, never arises in volume 2,
&gt;&gt; never arises in volume 3.

&gt;&gt; To date there has been no term for the Oxfordian attempt to twist
&gt;&gt; pre-Looney writers into proto-Oxfordians. The practice resembles the
&gt;&gt; Mormon custom of &quot;proxy baptism&quot; of one's non-Mormon ancestors. If it is
&gt;&gt; true, as Ken claims, that there is an Oxfordian attempt to deny Wilmot
&gt;&gt; credit for being the first Baconian, then if we combine that project with
&gt;&gt; the &quot;proxy baptism&quot; of Robert Plumer Ward and Herman Melville as
&gt;&gt; proto-Oxfordians we get the &quot;Wilmot Reviso&quot;: a revisionist history of
&gt;&gt; antistratfordianism which holds that the first antistratfordians were
&gt;&gt; Oxfordians. While the Wilmot Proviso would have mandated that slavery not
&gt;&gt; be extended into the territories purchased from Mexico, the Wilmot Reviso
&gt;&gt; would propose that Oxfordianism SHOULD be extended backwards in time while
&gt;&gt; the roots of Baconism should be snuffed out.

Huh? Why is Mr. Paraleresis dragging me into this? I merely asked a

&gt; Do you think the sonnets are basically

"/>

I think the first 17 were a creative exercise though inspired by a real life boy
shirking a duty to marry. I think the rest were mostly lyric poems that bits of
autobiography surely got into here and there. A few might have been inspired by
real-life events. I haven't really studied them, though; also, I tend to think
their author was like me, and during my sonnet phase (brief), I tended to write
on standard themes, but twice wrote on real life experiences--one about a girl
coming up the school stairs as I went down, and the way the light was; and one
about a girl who happened to show up at the high school track one Saturday
morning when I was running laps. No one would know that either sonnet was
entirely about a specific event because both were generalized. Anyway, my
simple point is that I tend to think Shakespeare wrote his sonnets the way I
wrote mine.

Also, I think of his bare ruined choirs sonnet, which is a theme sonnet such as
might have been written by anyone of sufficient talent, and is not
autobiographical, except in the sense that he may have had a particular scene in
mind, and may have been thinking about his own ageing (as I did at the age of
25).

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;It does seem to me that Price is a sacred cow at the Fellowship. I've been
&gt;&gt;about the only Gulielmus-Affirmer (yes, new name) there over the past year or
&gt;&gt;so. Buffalo showed up for a while, Terry made a few but not many posts, and
&gt;&gt;someone else posted six texts attempting to show that Oxford could not have
&gt;&gt;written the Ouevre. That, as far as I know, was it.

&gt; Those few, those happy few....

&gt;&gt;Anyway, I haven't been censored, but pretty strongly denounced, mainly by Roger.

&gt; I should hope so, otherwise we might start thinking
&gt;that you weren't doing your job!

&gt;&gt;Especially when I finally started seriously to take on Price's book. I had it
&gt;&gt;coming to a certain degree because I did accuse her of not being a scholar. An
&gt;&gt;exaggeration I thought anyone would understand to mean that I felt she was
&gt;&gt;wrong, and perhaps an imperfect scholar but not truly a non-scholar. I have
&gt;&gt;otherwise been fairly well-behaved, but have been honest in acknowledging that
&gt;&gt;I'm writing a book about what I take to be the mental dysfunction some
&gt;&gt;Gulielmus-Rejectors are afflicted with. (They accuse me right and left of the
&gt;&gt;mental dysfunctionality of &quot;denial&quot; while I haven't accused any of them
&gt;&gt;personally of any dysfunctionality that I know of, but that's the way it goes
&gt;&gt;among Gulielmus-Rejectors.)

&gt;&gt;At the Fellowship, I feel I've been continually challenged to respond to the
&gt;&gt;&quot;significant arguments&quot; for Gulielmus-Rejection forwarded by Price instead of
&gt;&gt;arguing the various things I argued--such as the fact that the Oxfordians have
&gt;&gt;not worked out a good scenario for their man. (I got them working on one that
&gt;&gt;is an improvement on what they had but still has defects; most of them
&gt;&gt;blithefully assume they don't need a scenario that makes sense, or so it seems
&gt;&gt;to me; only four or five argue with me, and only two in a sustained, serious
&gt;&gt;way--Willedever and Ken K.)

&gt; If you're talking to Willedever again, remind him
&gt;that a name on a title pages is evidence that someone with
&gt;that name wrote the work. Not conclusive evidence, of
&gt;course, but evidence. I was never able to get him to accept
&gt;that point in our go-round here some months ago. Perhaps
&gt;you'll have better luck.

Names are one of the many topics I avoid discussing with Will--because he can
get too riled for poor sensitive me at times, and because he sometimes says
worthwhile things on topics I CAN discuss with him.

I owe my term, &quot;Gulielmus-Rejector,&quot; to him. He claims no reference to William
Shakespeare can be considered a reference to the Stratford man because the
church records state that the Stratford man's name was Gulielmus Shakspeare;
presumably, they are the only records that count. I believe the man who bought
New Place, and is recorded as &quot;William Shakespeare,&quot; wrote the plays. I think
he may have been a cousin of Gulielmus but am not sure.

&gt;&gt;So I finally started a discussion about her ten

&gt;&gt;&quot;personal evidence&quot; thread at the Fellowship--which will eventually become part
&gt;&gt;of a full analysis of Price's book, I hope. If so, I'll post it here.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Ward's *De Vere* is a FOUR-volume novel -- a very tough slog, by the way

&gt;&gt;&gt; Ward or any of his characters says that William Shakespeare did not and
&gt;&gt;&gt; that the 17th Earl of Oxford did write the works commonly attributed to
&gt;&gt;&gt; Shakespeare. In fact, the 17th earl is not even a character in the

&gt;&gt;&gt; which is set centuries later than his time. The novel's title character
&gt;&gt;&gt; is descended from the earl, but does not say that his progenitor wrote
&gt;&gt;&gt; *Hamlet* or *Venus and Adonis* or even so much as a single line that has
&gt;&gt;&gt; generally been attributed to Shakespeare. Neither Ward nor any
&gt; character

Yes, that's right. There is a brief, passing mention (in volume one,
I believe) of the novel's protagonist's blue-blooded ancestor, but
nothing more, and certainly not the slightest hint that the seventeenth
Earl of the line had anything whatever to do with the Shakespeare canon.
I recall my astonishment when an Oxfordian (if memory serves, it was
none other than Dr. Stritmatter) made this claim in the newsgroup
several years ago; my conclusion at the time was that he could not
possibly have read the novel, which no more suggests that Edward de Vere
(or Mortimer de Vere, for that matter) wrote the works of Shakespeare
than that the novel's title, _De Vere: or, The Man of Independence_,
suggests that the protagonist hails from Missouri. The suggestion is,
if anything, *even* funnier and more redolent of wanton wishful thinking
and/or outright desperation than the comic claims that Leslie Howard was
an Oxfordian and that Nabokov was an anti-Stratfordian.

Buffalo, your posts have been both sensible and insightful, but I can
see that you *still* don't understand how much Oxfordian &quot;research&quot; is
conducted -- in that community, baseless rumors enjoy not merely a life
of their own, but actual immortality. An Oxfordian comes up with some
ridiculous speculation, easily refuted by the mere expedient of reading
the text in question, and brings it up on Phaeton or on some other
Oxfordian forum. It then spreads like wildfire and is repeated soberly
and bruited about on web sites, in newsletters, etc. Never mind that
nobody can find the pertinent quotation or other evidence. Never mind
that the canard can be conclusively refuted. It lives on in Oxfordia
nearly unscathed. One or two of the saner and more responsible
Oxfordians have actually tried to banish a few of these colorful myths
from the Oxfordian confession of faith (see, e.g., Nina Green's
&quot;Oxmyths&quot; page, &lt;&gt;), but to
little avail. Long after you and I are both gone, Oxfordians will
*still* be claiming that Nabokov was an anti-Stratfordian, that
&quot;moniment&quot; meant &quot;laughingstock&quot; in the early 1600s, that Oxford used
the Bolbec arms depicting a lion shaking a broken spear, etc., etc.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Then you can give chapter and verse without having
&gt; to slog through all four volumes of that (allegedly) unreadable novel.

"/>

The novel *is* nearly unreadable, but I certainly would not hold my
breath waiting for any SF participant to cite chapter and VERse. The
best you're likely to get is some Oxfordian opining that his or her
friend read the book and formed that impression, or that your informant
doesn't know any of the details but some other Oxfordian is writing a
book about the subject that will remove all doubt, or that the novel
contains both quotations from Shakespeare and a passing mention of
Edward de Vere. It's like waiting for Elizabeth Weird to produce
sources for the &quot;quotations&quot; that she invents -- you could wait until
the last trumpet sounds or until the Sun goes nova without results.

&gt;presumably, they are the only records that count. I believe the man who bought

&gt;he may have been a cousin of Gulielmus but am not sure.

I recall that same argument. I've come to the
conclusion that there must have been eight or nine people
living in Stratford with names similar to 'William
Shakespeare'. Must have been damn confusing:

&quot;William Shakespeare? No, I'm not William
Shakespeare. I'm William Shakspeare. You're probably
looking for William Shakespear. He lives four houses down,

An Oxfordian comes up with some

&gt; little avail.

"/>

Talking of &quot;sensible&quot; Oxfordians, I've just been net-searching to find an
article I read a few months ago by (I think) Peter Moore, which urges
Oxfordians to show a little more discrimination in their choice of material
and a little more level-headedness in the way they present it. I can't find
the link now, but the article is a fine example of unwitting comedy. He
begins sensibly enough, advising people to steer clear of arguments that
have long been refuted, arguments that are weak, or otherwise not worth
pursuing, etc, and generally proposing a new Oxfordianism that doesn't lend
itself to the kind of ridicule that the old kind couldn't help attracting.
Common sense rules for most of the article, and I even found myself nodding
in agreement at various points. But the strain was too much and he couldn't
sustain it. With the finishing line in sight, he just had to get stuck into
E.J. Honigmann's dating of one of the plays, and at that point all his
discipline deserted him: the Oxfordian flecks of foam started appearing at
the corners of his mouth. In no time at all he had invented a scenario where
Honigmann, who had been pursuing a dating theory that Oxfordians would have
found welcome, had been given &quot;orders&quot; by his &quot;superiors&quot; to drop his
theory. It seems the Elizabethan Age is just too small to hold the kind of
conspiracy Moore has in mind. It has to expand into our own time, with an
all-powerful Stratfordian Brotherhood, secret handshakes, bizarre rituals in
the dead of night... Thus in the space of one article the New Oxfordianism
metamorphoses back into the Old one.

I couldn't help thinking of the legendary episode from the BBC's Fawlty
Towers comedy series, where Basil Fawlty warns the hotel staff that they
have German guests coming whose sensibilities should be respected (&quot;Don't
mention the War&quot;). Within half an hour of their arrival Basil is
goose-stepping around the dining-room and the disgusted Germans are all
leaving....

Never say Oxfordians don't provide entertainment.

No. First of all we're not sure if it's Oxford's poetry, and second, it was
a particular poem that I thought and have always thought was pretty good.
We've spoken about it before on hlas and I gave the same opinion. If you had
chosen a different poem I might have agreed with you. However, you didn't
wind me up at all. I would say I'm an Oxfordian third, a non-Stratfordian
second, and interested in about ten other subjects first. I would have
thought you knew that by now. I don't live or die on whether Oxford wrote
the canon. I have far more strings to my bow.

So does everyone else around here -- in some

It's most peculiar. I had not realised the full

to us. Let's shut our minds to it all.&quot;

If I were wrong in my exegeses of the sonnets
it would be very easy for any Strat or quasi-
Strat to demonstrate that. Yet, week after week,
every single one of them ducks the challenge.
Any excuse will do. The current one is that I
am not always polite.

Convincing . . . eh?

I am certain (possibly foolishly) that I would
find it quite intolerable to be in the position of
the Strats and quasi-Strats around here. The
level of intellectual dishonesty seems to me to
be far too high to be bearable. What is it, to
have week after week, dozens of simple and
obvious questions, the answers to which you
cannot begin to formulate?

Many 'pre-contact' tribes had the belief that
their tribe constituted the sole occupants of
the universe. Were there many individuals in
those tribes who, after contact, continued in
that belief . . . in spite of all the planes, ships,
and multitudinous artefacts the new strangers
brought in? The evidence from HLAS would
seem to suggest so. No amount of evidence
seems adequate to dislodge a long-held
system of belief.

Except that there is not an instance of a similar

any other) literature. Nor is there one in extant

But what's wrong with dreaming up entirely

Where does intellectual dishonesty end, and

A Novel Whose Hero is a De Vere

The 19th century item is a novel published in 1827 and having the
title, De Vere, or the Man of Independence [1]. The novel was recently
brought to light by Sam Cherubim of Northampton, Massachusetts, who
came across it in a library, and passed the word to Roger Stritmatter
of UMass-Amherst. I am indebted to both of them for calling it to my
attention.

De Vere, or the Man of Independence, appropriately enough was
published anonymously. The author soon became known; he was Robert
Plumer Ward (no known relation to the Oxfordian scholars William
Plumer Fowler or Bernard M. Ward.)

Robert Plumer Ward was not your typical l9th century literary
novelist. He was first of all a lawyer and successful career
politician who held senior government positions. His novels were based
on the contemporary political scene, which he knew well. They caused
considerable sensation since his main characters were modeled on
government leaders, including William Pitt, the prime minister. [2]

Robert Plumer Ward thus was a political insider writing anonymously
about government affairs disguised as fiction --just as Oxford was
writing pseudonymously about court affairs as Shakespeare. Moreover, a
descendant of Oxford is the hero of Ward's novel.

Nothing should be forced when looking for possible references to
Oxford and Shakespeare in the works of other writers, but there are a
number of striking correspondences in Ward's novel. First of all,
quotations from Shakespeare lead off the title page in 88 of the 93
chapters (5 are by Milton). And Shakespeare is quoted fairly often
throughout the novel. Robert Plumer Ward knew his Shakespeare.

At the start of the novel, the author narrator, who is named
Beauclerk, meets Mortimer de Vere, the novel's hero, and discovers
that they are related. Mortimer de Vere is a direct descendant of
Edward de Vere, the 17th Earl of Oxford, and at his country house
there is a column on a pedestal with an inscription:

Trust in thy own good sword,
Rather than Princes' word.
Trust e'en in fortune sinister,
Rather than Princes' minister.
Of either, trust the guile,
Rather than woman's smile.
But most of all eschew,
To trust in Parvenu.

The only synonym for &quot;parvenu&quot; in Webster's unabridged dictionary is
&quot;upstart&quot;, as in &quot;upstart crow&quot;.

Mortimer de Vere, the hero of the novel, then explains that the verse
was supposed to have been taken from Oxford's study at Castle
Hedingham. He's not sure who the parvenu is. But here is a novelist in
1827 creating (?) a verse from Oxford's study that seemingly warns the
reader to shun an upstart like the &quot;shake-scene&quot; in Robert Greene's
Groatsworth of Wit (1592), who seems to stand for the man from
Stratford. [3] Mortimer mentions, too, Oxford's quarrels with his
father-in-law, Lord Burleigh, and other details of Oxford's life.
Writing in the early 19th century, Ward knows a lot about Oxford and
Shakespeare.

The novel is a long tale of political intrigue and romance, ending
with a dispute over a will. The hero, Mortimer de Vere, is brilliant,
impetuous and uncommonly proud and upright, a man of so much integrity
he has trouble succeeding in the world of politics. The book ends with
a dramatic trial over an inheritance.

Several passages describing Mortimer de Vere sound like a description
of Oxford:

&quot;His enthusiastic imagination, which often ran away with him, and
falling upon a spirit hereditarily independent, influenced, as we
shall see, the whole cast of his life.&quot; (p. 42)

Mortimer read deeply in law and history and he found that &quot;Edward,
earl of Oxford, in the days of Elizabeth, united in his single person,
the character of her greatest noble, knight and poet.&quot; (p. 61)

At one point Mortimer and the woman he eventually marries, known as
the &quot;queen&quot; of her household and the &quot;lady of the castle&quot;, plan a
theatrical performance, a masque. (p. l84)

Mortimer de Vere says: &quot;And what can I do for you my cousine?&quot; She
answers: &quot;O! a great deal, --for while I am the manager of my theater,
you must be the poet.&quot;

&quot;I never wrote a verse in my life,&quot; replies de Vere, despairingly,
yet half laughing at the proposal.

The masque raises many questions among the audience: &quot;What was the
exact meaning of the masques? Who was the compiler?

Quickly, however, the word spreads that Mortimer de Vere wrote the
masque and the allusions are to the &quot;queen&quot; of the household, the
&quot;lady of the castle&quot;. Later, she says, &quot;the bard wants to send me to
London to reign over I know not what sort of people.&quot;

In the audience is a parvenu, an upstart. He is the son of a
manufacturer who converts his name from lower-class Bartholomew to
upper- class Bertie and is notorious for insinuating himself into
nobility. He buys himself a knighthood just as Will Shakspere, also a
parvenu, bought himself a coat of arms.

These references and allusions linking Mortimer de Vere, a descendant
of Oxford, to playwriting for the queen of the household, constitute a
small part of a long novel. But they are striking, given the evidence
that the author of the novel was well versed in his Shakespeare and
well acquainted with the historical personage Edward de Vere, the 17th
Earl of Oxford.

Did he know the truth? More research and analysis may turn up
stronger connections and permit more telling interpretations.

1. De Vere; or the Man of Independence, by Robert Plumer Ward.
Philadelphia: Carey, 1827.
2. The Dictionary of National Biography. See also Memoirs of the
Political and Literary Life of Robert Plumer Ward, Esq., by Edmund
Phipps. London: Murray, 1850. On page 106 Ward is called &quot;a spectator
of the game of politics.&quot; On page 165 is a letter from Benjamin
Disraeli to Ward praising his book. Ward himself energetically
disclaims that real people are represented in the book. (xi)
3. Ward, p. 25. The hero, Mortimer, guesses that &quot;parvenu&quot; may refer
to Burghley or an &quot;insinuating, designing flatterer of a secretary&quot;,
but in the end cannot decide.

&gt; My guess is that Oxfordians would say that Oxford's authorship is hinted at
&gt; because the character is, as it were, surrounded by Shakespeare. And the
&gt; Earl of Oxford is mentioned more than once, at least as I remember it.
&gt; Rather strange in a nineteenth century novel. There is also something about
&gt; his being a great poet. If you push me, I will go and look for the exact
&gt; quote. Sigh. And my husband Michael (who is much more diligent than I and
&gt; read the whole thing) has just reminded me that there are parallels between
&gt; Mortimer and Edward. Mortimer is supposed to have written a masque, etc. I
&gt; can offer nothing conclusive, but the subject is rather intriguing.

&gt; Talking of &quot;sensible&quot; Oxfordians, I've just been net-searching to find an
&gt; article I read a few months ago by (I think) Peter Moore, which urges
&gt; Oxfordians to show a little more discrimination in their choice of material
&gt; and a little more level-headedness in the way they present it. I can't find
&gt; the link now, but the article is a fine example of unwitting comedy. He
&gt; begins sensibly enough, advising people to steer clear of arguments that
&gt; have long been refuted, arguments that are weak, or otherwise not worth
&gt; pursuing, etc, and generally proposing a new Oxfordianism that doesn't lend
&gt; itself to the kind of ridicule that the old kind couldn't help attracting.
&gt; Common sense rules for most of the article, and I even found myself nodding
&gt; in agreement at various points. But the strain was too much and he couldn't
&gt; sustain it. With the finishing line in sight, he just had to get stuck into
&gt; E.J. Honigmann's dating of one of the plays, and at that point all his
&gt; discipline deserted him: the Oxfordian flecks of foam started appearing at
&gt; the corners of his mouth. In no time at all he had invented a scenario where
&gt; Honigmann, who had been pursuing a dating theory that Oxfordians would have
&gt; found welcome, had been given &quot;orders&quot; by his &quot;superiors&quot; to drop his
&gt; theory. It seems the Elizabethan Age is just too small to hold the kind of
&gt; conspiracy Moore has in mind. It has to expand into our own time, with an
&gt; all-powerful Stratfordian Brotherhood, secret handshakes, bizarre rituals in
&gt; the dead of night... Thus in the space of one article the New Oxfordianism
&gt; metamorphoses back into the Old one.

All this can be got from staring hard enough at the word &quot;parvenu&quot;.
Eventually the letters start to move. They turn themselves into a writhing
snake, then a fish, then a fat Turkish sultan....

Another route to enlightenment, of course, is to know something of 19th
century language and preoccupations. Then you wouldn't have to look up
&quot;parvenu&quot; in the dictionary in the first place. You would know that it was a
common word of the time, used to describe someone who was upwardly mobile.
What was meant was &quot;nouveau riche&quot;. At the time this novel was written there
was new class of people made wealthy by the industrial revolution of the
previous century who were now cultivating pretensions to gentility, buying
up landed estates from impoverished nobles and setting themselves up as if
they were nobility themselves. These days everyone is supposed to be a
parvenu; it's part of the modern doctrine of getting ahead, advancing
yourself, getting out of the ghetto, etc. But in those days, you were
supposed to know your place, especially according to novelists who chose
names for their heroes like &quot;Mortimer de Vere&quot;. It goes without saying that
these novelists were not themselves members of the aristocracy, and
therefore parvenus. So it was a kind of proxy snobbery.

In Elizabethan times, as in all previous times, there wasn't a parvenu
class as such, but a few individuals who attained influential positions
would doubtless be looked down upon in the same way, especially by noblemen
who fell under their power. The profile would be of someone below Oxford in
rank, but far enough advanced that he would be the kind of person Oxford
would have dealings with. W.S. of Stratford was not one of those. His
station was so lowly that he would be regarded as part of the great
unwashed. You would be looking for someone newly elevated to the peerage and
stinking rich. And the best fit is:-

&gt; 2. The Dictionary of National Biography. See also Memoirs of the

&gt; Phipps. London: Murray, 1850. On page 106 Ward is called &quot;a spectator

If the printing of the First Folio instigated another

Unlike other aristocrats who wrote anonymously,

This could be an aristocratic reference.

The OED shows 'quick wine' to be bubbly or

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Let me correct what I said earlier --

[...]

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Ward's *De Vere* is a FOUR-volume novel -- a very tough slog, by the
&gt; way
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; -- that may be of some interest to literary historians as an early
&gt;&gt;&gt; example
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of the political novel. Trollope he ain't. What he also ain't is
&gt; an
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Oxfordian. I know of no passage anywhere in this long novel where
&gt;&gt;&gt; either
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Ward or any of his characters says that William Shakespeare did not
&gt; and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that the 17th Earl of Oxford did write the works commonly attributed
&gt; to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Shakespeare. In fact, the 17th earl is not even a character in the
&gt;&gt;&gt; novel,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; which is set centuries later than his time. The novel's title
&gt; character
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; is descended from the earl, but does not say that his progenitor
&gt; wrote
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; *Hamlet* or *Venus and Adonis* or even so much as a single line that
&gt; has
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; generally been attributed to Shakespeare. Neither Ward nor any
&gt;&gt;&gt; character
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in the novel ever suggests that ANYBODY other than Shakespeare wrote
&gt; the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; works of Shakespeare. What we might now think of as the
&gt;&quot;Shakespeare
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; authorship&quot; matter never arises in volume 1, never arises in volume
&gt; 2,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; never arises in volume 3, never arises in volume 4.
&gt;&gt; Yes, that's right. There is a brief, passing mention (in volume one,
&gt;&gt; I believe) of the novel's protagonist's blue-blooded ancestor, but
&gt;&gt; nothing more, and certainly not the slightest hint that the seventeenth
&gt;&gt; Earl of the line had anything whatever to do with the Shakespeare canon.
&gt;&gt; I recall my astonishment when an Oxfordian (if memory serves, it was
&gt;&gt; none other than Dr. Stritmatter) made this claim in the newsgroup
&gt;&gt; several years ago; my conclusion at the time was that he could not
&gt;&gt; possibly have read the novel, which no more suggests that Edward de Vere
&gt;&gt; (or Mortimer de Vere, for that matter) wrote the works of Shakespeare
&gt;&gt; than that the novel's title, _De Vere: or, The Man of Independence_,
&gt;&gt; suggests that the protagonist hails from Missouri. The suggestion is,
&gt;&gt; if anything, *even* funnier and more redolent of wanton wishful thinking
&gt;&gt; and/or outright desperation than the comic claims that Leslie Howard was
&gt;&gt; an Oxfordian and that Nabokov was an anti-Stratfordian.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Lynne, since you are the proud owner of all four volumes, perhaps
&gt; you
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; could type up the exact passage where Ward (according to the SF)
&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;proposes
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in fictional form that Edward de Vere was the real mind behind the
&gt; mask
&gt;&gt;&gt; of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Shakespeare.&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I'm no expert, Terry, as you very well know. I don't believe he does,
&gt; not
&gt;&gt;&gt; in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; any outright way, at least;
&gt;&gt; He does not. Not in any outright way, nor in any other way, for that
&gt;&gt; matter. (I'm sure that Art could find a few anagrams (with farcically
&gt;&gt; poor INPNC scores) and ciphers with his secret decoder ring, but that's
&gt;&gt; the strongest case that the book's content permits.)
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; however, if I remember correctly, although the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; story is about a de Vere, a descendant of the 17th earl, there are
&gt; many
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Shakespeare quotations throughout,
&gt;&gt; Shakespeare quotations were a commonplace of the period, and many
&gt;&gt; literary works are *still* saturated with such quotations; have you
&gt;&gt; never read the novels of, say, Sir Walter Scott, Lynne?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and almost all the chapter headings are
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; followed by Shakespeare quotes. I only got through volume two,
&gt;&gt; Then you already encountered the strongest &quot;argument&quot; for the
&gt;&gt; putative presence of the authorship &quot;question&quot; in the novel, Lynne: the
&gt;&gt; mere mention, in passing, of the seventeenth Earl of Oxford. I can
&gt;&gt; think of novels and stories saturated with Biblical lore and quotations
&gt;&gt; that mention Joseph of Arimathea in passing, but I have never been
&gt;&gt; tempted to infer that the novel's author was intimating that Joseph of
&gt;&gt; Arimathea wrote the Bible.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; not being
&gt;&gt;&gt; as
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; much of a slogger as you, although I may go back to it, so it's quite
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; possible there is an authorship nugget of gold further on.
&gt;&gt; If you read as far as volume two, Lynne, then you have already
&gt;&gt; enountered by far the best &quot;nugget&quot; that the novel affords.
&gt;&gt;&gt; There is a faster way, of course, which is to ask the person responsible
&gt; for
&gt;&gt;&gt; the item on the SF website. If they made the assertion, they must have
&gt; the
&gt;&gt;&gt; evidence to support it.
&gt;&gt; Buffalo, your posts have been both sensible and insightful, but I can
&gt;&gt; see that you *still* don't understand how much Oxfordian &quot;research&quot; is
&gt;&gt; conducted -- in that community, baseless rumors enjoy not merely a life
&gt;&gt; of their own, but actual immortality.
&gt; Well, I'm not as green as my suggestion makes it appear. I was being
&gt; mischievous. I was even tempted to add &quot;and if you find that there is no
&gt; evidence, you can insist that it be removed&quot;. But on reflection I decided to
&gt; leave that out. I wound Lynne up enough yesterday by damning Oxford's poetry
&gt; with faint praise.
&gt;&gt; An Oxfordian comes up with some
&gt;&gt; ridiculous speculation, easily refuted by the mere expedient of reading
&gt;&gt; the text in question, and brings it up on Phaeton or on some other
&gt;&gt; Oxfordian forum. It then spreads like wildfire and is repeated soberly
&gt;&gt; and bruited about on web sites, in newsletters, etc. Never mind that
&gt;&gt; nobody can find the pertinent quotation or other evidence. Never mind
&gt;&gt; that the canard can be conclusively refuted. It lives on in Oxfordia
&gt;&gt; nearly unscathed. One or two of the saner and more responsible
&gt;&gt; Oxfordians have actually tried to banish a few of these colorful myths
&gt;&gt; from the Oxfordian confession of faith (see, e.g., Nina Green's
&gt;&gt;&quot;Oxmyths&quot; page, &lt;http://www3.telus.net/oxford/phaeton.html&gt;), but to
&gt;&gt; little avail.
&gt; Talking of &quot;sensible&quot; Oxfordians,

The term is, of course, relative.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I've just been net-searching to find an
&gt; article I read a few months ago by (I think) Peter Moore, which urges
&gt; Oxfordians to show a little more discrimination in their choice of material
&gt; and a little more level-headedness in the way they present it. I can't find
&gt; the link now, but the article is a fine example of unwitting comedy.

he propose in its stead?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; and generally proposing a new Oxfordianism that doesn't lend

I see -- if Oxfordians refrain from making *any* arguments, then
presumably their arguments will not invite ridicule.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Common sense rules for most of the article, and I even found myself nodding
&gt; in agreement at various points. But the strain was too much and he couldn't
&gt; sustain it. With the finishing line in sight, he just had to get stuck into
&gt; E.J. Honigmann's dating of one of the plays, and at that point all his
&gt; discipline deserted him: the Oxfordian flecks of foam started appearing at
&gt; the corners of his mouth.

"/>

This does sound amusing!

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; In no time at all he had invented a scenario where
&gt; Honigmann, who had been pursuing a dating theory that Oxfordians would have
&gt; found welcome, had been given &quot;orders&quot; by his &quot;superiors&quot; to drop his
&gt; theory.

"/>

His superiors would, of course, be the Knights Templar.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; It seems the Elizabethan Age is just too small to hold the kind of

"/>

Careful -- don't reveal *too* much about our Order.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Thus in the space of one article the New Oxfordianism

&gt;&gt; Thanks yet again Terry for contributing to hlas's rather high

&gt;&gt; Webb we weave...

&gt; I provided no misinformation, although I may have used a bit of mild humor
&gt; and engaged in a bit of clearly labeled speculation, but thank you, Roger
&gt; for providing some very interesting details.

&gt; This claim was made by Ken Kaplan: &quot;Dan Wright has done some preliminary
&gt; work to show that Wilmot was a forgery made up by Baconians.&quot;

&gt; David Webb asked what the evidence was, I made my little &quot;Wilmot Reviso&quot;
&gt; joke, and David said,

&gt;&quot;Good one, Terry! But seriously (or at last as seriously as befits
&gt; h.l.a.s.), are you aware of the supposed &quot;preliminary work&quot; of Prof. Dr.
&gt; Wright to which Ken so tersely alludes? Is it as pertinent to Shakespeare
&gt; authorship as the Wilmot Proviso?&quot;

&gt; To which I replied, &quot;I am not aware of any such 'preliminary work.'&quot; I
&gt; then summarized Schoenbaum's account of the Wilmot/Cowell story, giving
&gt; not only the page number in Schoenbaum, but also mentioning Schoenbaum's
&gt; source, Allardyce Nicoll.

&gt;&gt; The alleged discovery of the forgery respecting James Wilmot came
&gt;&gt; from John Rollett,not Daniel Wright.

&gt; If you are right, then Ken was wrong.

&gt;&gt; Dr. Rollett had spent better than a year following up the clues and
&gt;&gt; announced his conclusions in some detail to a strictly closed forum to
&gt;&gt; which Dr. Wright occasionally contributes.

&gt; I hope you won't be in trouble for spilling the beans.

"/>

RNP
The announcement was supposed to be out some months ago.As Ken gave
an account it is to be expected it had been done.
<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; Wright, following his trip to England, pronounced that Rollett was
&gt;&gt; entirely correct. And I gather a joint announcement was to be made (was
&gt;&gt; it?).

&gt; I can find no trace of any such announcement on the Internet, even in
&gt; Oxfordian forums that are not &quot;strictly closed&quot; to me.

RNP
Terry,I hope you aren't moonlighting on private property and,if you
are, you could easily have ascertained that the investigation ,which I
can't discuss, was conducted with the utmost care.In fact an old
Stratfordian acquaintance of yours was asked to participate as a
gesture of good will and ,I understand, did also examine the papers.
<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; According to both men the alleged transcript of the Ipswich speech at
&gt;&gt; the University of London appears to be of clearly twentieth century
&gt;&gt; origin and Rollett, after extensive research in early nineteenth
&gt;&gt; archives, has found no trace of the existence of either Cowell or the
&gt;&gt; Ipswich Philosophic Society.
&gt; TR
&gt; Well, that's fun, isn't it. I did say, &quot;I don't know whether Wright has
&gt; looked at Cowell's actual manuscripts, but that would seem to be the first
&gt; step in any &quot;'preliminary work.'&quot; According to your account, it appears
&gt; that Rollett did indeed do some looking, which is good to hear.

&gt; Rollett has made at least one very useful find that I know of -- noticing
&gt; the reference to Elizabeth as &quot;an ever-living Empress&quot; in *Polimanteia*.

"/>

RNP
Actually that reference was,I believe , first pointed out by Diana
Price.
However,John has made many interesting discoveries and critiques over
the last decade,including,probably including the Cowell forgery.
TR
<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; On the other hand, he also thought he had found Oxfordian ciphers in the
&gt; dedication to *Shakespeare's Sonnets*, and even though he is no longer an
&gt; Oxfordian, he is reluctant to give up the ciphers.

"/>

RNP
Where do you get this &quot;reluctant&quot; from? John submitted his
findings and the peer review board at a well known journal accepted
them for publication.After acceptance,the editor(not a member of the
board) took it upon himself to prevent publication on the grounds
that there was no interest in the subject.
You've published your opinion here.Others equally well qualified
feel otherwise. I personally don't claim the right to a judgment one
way or the other(a rare situation on hlas).I do know that John is a
respected scientist and,if someday proved wrong, he has nevertheless
proceeded at all times proceeded with due care with his hypothesis.

Rollett thought the

&gt; By the way, there DOES appear to be a &quot;trace of the existence&quot; of the
&gt;&quot;Ipswich Philosophical Society.&quot; According the the National Register of

&gt; the &quot;minutes, corresp, accounts and papers&quot; of the Ipswich Philosophical
&gt; Society; the collection covers the years 1849-72:

&gt; Nicoll's account, according to Schoenbaum, places Cowell's report quite a
&gt; bit earlier than 1849; I hope Rollett's &quot;extensive research&quot; included a
&gt; look at the Ipswich Philosophical Society collection.

&gt;&gt; That Schoenbaum misstates ,or is ignorant of, key facts in the Nicoll
&gt;&gt; case as he is in the Roderick Eagle case,the Hester Dowden case,the
&gt;&gt; Abraham Bronson Feldman case,the Richard Simpson case,the George Buc
&gt;&gt; case,the E.H.C.Oliphant case, and many,many,other cases too numerous for
&gt;&gt; citation here, need occasion no surprise.

&gt; Schoenbaum cited the sources he relied on; I haven't checked to see
&gt; whether he misstated what Nicoll said. I gather Rollett's point is not
&gt; that Schoenbaum was wrong but that Nicoll was.

"/>

RNP
I gather , as was plainly said,that Schoenbaum is not necessarily to
be relied on his own right but should ordinarily be relied on when
quoting Nicoll, whom I thought anyone would be absolutely safe in
quoting.Up till now Nicoll has been a strictly non-controversial
scholar.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; It is,however, surprising to find the gentle and truly scholarly
&gt;&gt; Allardyce Nicoll being used as a dupe in the affair.

&gt; But used as a &quot;dupe&quot; by whom? Does Rollett think some Baconian tipped him
&gt; to the existence of the Cowell material? What was Nicoll's account of how
&gt; this material came to his attention?

&gt;&gt; As I myself utilized some of the Nicoll material(Elizabethan
&gt;&gt; Review,l997) concerning Wilmott's alleged discovery of a Bacon
&gt;&gt; passport,I would be delighted to see it re-authenticated but this does
&gt;&gt; not, at the moment ,appear to be the most probable course of coming
&gt;&gt; events.

&gt; I haven't heard enough to agree or disagree; let's hope Rollett reveals
&gt; what he knows as soon as he can.

&gt;&gt; Meanwhile John Rollett has behaved with all due caution in the affair
&gt;&gt; and has not addressed one abusive word in respect to Dr.Nicoll's seeming
&gt;&gt; error.You, Terry,in the finest hlas tradition, are the first to
&gt;&gt; intemperately state &quot;that chump Nicoll was the useful idiot&quot;. Come
&gt;&gt; now,may be historian Nicoll just lacked physical scientist Rollett's
&gt;&gt; expertise on early nineteenth century paper making,should Rollett prove
&gt;&gt; to be correct.
&gt; TR
&gt; Actually, Roger, it is your own misreading that is giving you grief. Let
&gt; me quote my words:

&gt;&quot;Nicoll was not a Baconian, of course, so presumably the way the fable is
&gt; supposed to work is that some Baconian or other forged Cowell's
&gt; manuscripts and then just left them alone in the hope that somebody would
&gt; stumble over them some day, and that chump Nicoll was the useful idiot.
&gt; Perhaps Ken could enlighten us.&quot;

&gt; Did you miss the words &quot;presumably the way the fable is supposed to work&quot;?

&gt; You must be familiar with the term &quot;useful idiot,&quot; which is generally
&gt; credited to Lenin, and is used to refer to someone who unwittingly
&gt; advances an ideology he opposes. Within the possible &quot;fable&quot; that I
&gt; sketched, such would be Nicoll's role.

"/>

RNP
Actually I don't know the Lenin quote.I much prefer St. Seraphim
of Sarov or the Archpriest Avvakum,if reading non-professional Russian
writers.However I fear that, if I had recognized the quote, it would
have only increased my ire.In my book accusing anyone of a Lenin like
plot is worse than accusing anyone of a Goebbels like plot. But I
guess that depends on whose relatives got murdered by whom.

Of course,I accept your emendation &quot; 'fable' that I sketched&quot; with
pleasure
and in such context the phrases complained of are harmless. However,
as originally constructed the sentence most naturally presented
itself as stating that a fable had been concocted by the alleged
discovers with sinister intent. I am delighted to find this is not
so,though I would be equally delighted to find that both of us ,and
Schoenbaum, hadn't been quoting a forged document
'
'

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; And further,I suspect that Terry will eventually find that the first
&gt;&gt; discovery was made in the earlier l920's ,not l932.

&gt; Roger, you really should attend to the actual words that are before you
&gt; when you read. I said nothing about the date of &quot;the first discovery&quot;; I
&gt; said, &quot;The first published account of Cowell's report on Wilmot was made
&gt; by Allardyce Nicoll in the *TLS* in 1932.&quot; My source for this information
&gt; was Schoenbaum, but

Mr. Paraleresis misreads yet *again*! I did not say that I had never

in outline.

Dr. Wright, preliminary work ostensibly suggesting that, in Ken's words,
&quot;Wilmot was a forgery made up by Baconians.&quot; I was intrigued by Ken's

By no means. The standard Baconian sources that I can recall, both

&gt;&gt; RNP
&gt;&gt; Maybe not.But Terry likewise admits he knows nothing about it.So
&gt;&gt; why ask him?
&gt; Because Terry said that he didn't know about it *after* I asked him,
&gt; of course -- how would *anyone* know what Terry knew about the matter
&gt; without *asking* him? (One hesitates to explain the obvious, but in the
&gt; case of Mr. Paraleresis, one really cannot take anything for granted.)

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Dr. Rollett had spent better than
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a year following up the clues and announced his conclusions in some
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; detail to a strictly closed forum to which Dr.Wright occasionally
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; contributes.Wright ,following his trip to England,pronounced that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Rollett was entirely correct.And I gather a joint announcement was to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; be made(was it?).

&gt;&gt;&gt; I don't know -- indeed, I asked the question in order to elicit
&gt;&gt;&gt; exactly such information, if it was available.

&gt;&gt; RNP
&gt;&gt; And within the bonds of discretion,it is.

&gt; Good -- when will the information be forthcoming?

If you want additional information you will have to write to one
of the three scholars directly involved or make up with Ken.Maybe his
recent Reagan fulminations have done something to warm the cockles of
your heart toward him.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; According to both men the alleged transcript of the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Ipswich speech at the University of London appears to be of clearly
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; twentieth century origin and Rollett,after extensive research in early
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; nineteenth archives [sic], has found no trace of the existence of either
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Cowell or the Ipswich
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Philosophic Society.

&gt;&gt;&gt; DW
&gt;&gt;&gt; As I recall, the institution in question was called the Ipswich
&gt;&gt;&gt; Philosophical Society, not the Ipswich Philosophic Society. If Mr.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Paraleresis is accurately reporting Rollett's and Wright's conclusion
&gt;&gt;&gt; (always a perilous assumption), that circumstance might explain why
&gt;&gt;&gt; neither man found any trace of the Society's existence, either in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;nineteenth archives&quot; or elsewhere. However, a quick Google search
&gt;&gt;&gt; turns up (in addition to the usual anti-Stratfordian sources) a link to
&gt;&gt;&gt; the National Register of Archives of the U.K. in which the Ipswich
&gt;&gt;&gt; Philosophical Society quite plainly appears, right after the Ipswich
&gt;&gt;&gt; Philatelic Society.

&gt;&gt; RNP
&gt;&gt; But,David,since you began by admitting (for once)that you knew
&gt;&gt; nothing about the question,you admit in advance that you could not
&gt;&gt; possibly have recollected
&gt;&gt; anything about the institution (of which you profess never to have
&gt;&gt; heard) which is allegedly involved.

&gt; Mr. Paraleresis misreads yet *again*! I did not say that I had never
&gt; heard of Wilmot, of the Cowell paper supposedly read before the Ipswich
&gt; Philosophical Society, etc.; indeed, almost anyone with even a passing
&gt; famliarity with Shakespeare will have heard the Wilmot story, at least
&gt; in outline.

&gt; Rather, I said only that I knew nothing about the recent &quot;preliminary
&gt; work&quot; mentioned by Ken Kaplan and attributed by him to the Rev. Prof.
&gt; Dr. Wright, preliminary work ostensibly suggesting that, in Ken's words,
&gt;&quot;Wilmot was a forgery made up by Baconians.&quot; I was intrigued by Ken's
&gt; post -- but recognizing that Ken has proven to be by no means the most
&gt; reliable source of information in h.l.a.s., I appealed to someone who
&gt; *has* proven to be among the most reliable and best informed sources of
&gt; pertinent information in h.l.a.s.

&gt;&gt; Since you failed to find the
&gt;&gt; Ipswich Philosophic
&gt;&gt; Society on a quick search,you ASSumed that the researchers were rather
&gt;&gt; like yourself satisfied with an even quicker Google search and should
&gt;&gt; have thrown in the sponge when they found a philosophicAL society with
&gt;&gt; records dating,as Terry states,from some forty years after the
&gt;&gt; purported speech.

&gt; By no means. The standard Baconian sources that I can recall, both
&gt; online and elsewhere, are pretty unanimous in identifying the society in
&gt; question as the &quot;Ipswich PhilosophicAL Society&quot; [emphasis added], and I
&gt; merely noted that there *does* exist at least some evidence of its
&gt; existence. That the extant archival records whose existence is readily
&gt; confirmed be a Google search postdate the supposed Cowell paper does not
&gt; confirm that the Society did *not* exist earlier. I expressed no
&gt; opinion concerning the existence of the Society; rather, I questioned
&gt; the assertion that there was no *evidence* of it, which is a different
&gt; matter altogether.

Whatever unidentified Baconian sources say about the Cowell
speech, the correct suffix is one thing about which Ross at third
hand(quoting Schoenbaum quoting Nichol) correctly informed Webb and
which Webb,bemused by his earlier unidentified sources, fails to
recollect as the more recent information available .The speech is
represented as given to the Ipswich PhilosophIC Society as I stated
and the investigators stated.In fact it the one thing everyone did
agree on.If the Baconian sources and Webb using PhilosophicAL are
correct,he should verify it at the Durning-Lawrence Collection at the
University of London.
Here again is what Terry wrote:
The original report of

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; James Wilmot's belief that Shakespeare's works were written by Bacon was
&gt; delivered by James Corton Cowell to the Ipswich Philosophic Society in
&gt; 1806 (see Schoenbaum, *Shakespeare's Lives*, p. 399). The manuscripts of
&gt; Cowell's remarks to the society eventually went to the University of
&gt; London Library. I don't know whether Wright has looked at Cowell's actual
&gt; manuscripts, but that would seem to be the first step in any &quot;preliminary
&gt; work.&quot; The first published account of Cowell's report on Wilmot was made
&gt; by Allardyce Nicoll in the *TLS* in 1932.

&gt; Nicoll was not a Baconian, of course, so presumably the way the fable is
&gt; supposed to work is that some Baconian or other forged Cowell's
&gt; manuscripts and then just left them alone in the hope that somebody would
&gt; stumble over them some day, and that chump Nicoll was the useful idiot.
&gt; Perhaps Ken could enlighten us.
&gt; RNP
&gt;&gt; If the questioned manuscript refers to the Philosophic Society,as
&gt;&gt; is alleged,you have just done yet another great job of enmeshing
&gt;&gt; yourself in your own webb.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; That Schoenbaum misstates ,or is ignorant of, key facts in the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Nicoll case as he is in the Roderick Eagle case,the Hester Dowden
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; case,the Abraham Bronson Feldman case,the Richard Simpson case,the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; George Buc case,the E.H.C.Oliphant case, and many,many,other cases too
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; numerous for citation here, need occasion no surprise.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It is,however, surprising to find the gentle and truly scholarly
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Allardyce Nicoll being used as a dupe in the affair. As I myself
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; utilized some of the Nicoll material(Elizabethan Review,l997)
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; concerning Wilmott's alleged discovery of a Bacon passport ,I would be
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; delighted to see it re-authenticated but this does not, at the moment
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ,appear to be the most probable course of coming events.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Meanwhile John Rollett has behaved with all due caution in the affair
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and has not addressed one abusive word in respect to Dr.Nicoll's
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; seeming error.You, Terry,in the finast [sic] hlas tradition, are the
