Hi,
I bought a 98 TJ Sport 6 cylinder.  The dealer window sticker was
still with the paperwork and it says it has a 15 gallon tank.  Is this
accurate?  I had assumed the tank would be cloer to 20 gallon.
Thanks,
Al

It is an either or situation on the TJ I believe unlike the YJ were they
just 'faked' the 15 gallon tank by moving the filler vent.

Actually if you really knew anything you would know that 15 gallons is
standard and there was a option for a 20 gallon tank.

Both the TJ and later YJ tanks can be converted to 20 gallons by
trimming the vent tube.  The only problem is that your gauge will read
full until the last 15 gallons start being used.

So they faked out some of the early TJ's too?  I thought I remembered
something about that.

I was just reading around and found out you have a 19 gallon tank in
your 98 TJ.

If the sticker says it is a 15 gallon tank, they put a float ball
stopper in the fill tube so it shuts off at 15, but the tank is the same.

You can drop the tank and remove this ball by trimming the tube back.

Here is a link with directions about halfway down:
http://www.pirate4x4.com/forum/showthread.php?t=453329

You then would need the 19 gallon sender or just realize your gauge just
reads the bottom 3/4 of the tank.  I have had cars like that...

Why on Earth would they do something like that?  You usually know what

I can't imagine why they would do that either, unless it was to make
some easy money on people ordering the upgrade to the 20 gallon tank.
There are sites all over the net on how to do the fix though.

They must've changed the spec sheets in later years, 'cause I have a
2006 Wrangler X and my spec sheet does say 19 gallons.  However, the
manual states that when the 'low gas, dummy' light comes on, you have
approximately 2 gallons of gas left.  I have intentionally travelled
as far as I have dared around my town with this light on (never more
than walking distance from a gas station if it quit), and even when I
fill it, I have never been able to put more than 17.5 gallons in it.
So I am not sure if the gauge reads wrong, or if the tank is not
really a 19 gallon tank.

It may be a different tank as compared to the earlier TJs. Most fuel
gages don't read as accurate as we'd like to think. My truck can run
well below empty for quite a while, but I have pushed it too far a
couple times and ended up walking a short distance.

I've let the needle actually cross over onto the idiot light before
refeuling, but it's risky ;-)
Usually, when I refuel anywhere between the last line and the light, I
can only get to within 2 gallons of max.

It must be cheaper to do it that way rather than design a new skid plate
and strap setup.

The later 4.0 YJ's are the same, one tank fits all with just the filler
vent deeper on the 'smaller' tank.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I was just reading around and found out you have a 19 gallon tank in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; your 98 TJ.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If the sticker says it is a 15 gallon tank, they put a float ball
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; stopper in the fill tube so it shuts off at 15, but the tank is the same.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Why on Earth would they do something like that?  You usually know what
&gt;&gt;&gt; your talking about and I'm not disputing you, it just sounds like a
&gt;&gt;&gt; really stupid thing to do... so if they really did do it I'm sure it was
&gt;&gt;&gt; to meet some goofy government regulation.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Jeff DeWitt
&gt;&gt; I can't imagine why they would do that either, unless it was to make
&gt;&gt; some easy money on people ordering the upgrade to the 20 gallon tank.
&gt;&gt; There are sites all over the net on how to do the fix though.

&gt; They must've changed the spec sheets in later years, 'cause I have a
&gt; 2006 Wrangler X and my spec sheet does say 19 gallons.  However, the
&gt; manual states that when the 'low gas, dummy' light comes on, you have
&gt; approximately 2 gallons of gas left.  I have intentionally travelled
&gt; as far as I have dared around my town with this light on (never more
&gt; than walking distance from a gas station if it quit), and even when I
&gt; fill it, I have never been able to put more than 17.5 gallons in it.
&gt; So I am not sure if the gauge reads wrong, or if the tank is not
&gt; really a 19 gallon tank.
">

I always take any 'new' to me vehicle I buy and put a full gas can on
board 'planning' to run out of gas.

I do this on a specific run so I don't have any surprises.

I mark the odometer when the light come on, then I mark it a second time
when the gauge is 'exactly' on the E line, then again when the needle
stops moving if I can notice that.

I then drive until it sputters, pull over and put gas in from the can to
get to a gas station.

This lets me know exactly how many miles I have left at the bottom parts
of the gauge.

Some vehicles have given up to 70 miles after the gauge read E, others
like my CJ7 are 'out' of gas when it hits E.

I always whenever possible take heed of the advice
the old farmer I used to work for gave me.

&quot;Keep the top half full, the bottom half will never go dry&quot;

Every winter when we're out snowmobiling in Quebec
Gas stations are far and between, riding those gas guzzelers
(My 4.0litre Rubie gets better mileage than my little 0.5litre sled)
we NEVER pass up a gas staion. Even if it's down a quarter tank

Nothing like that nervous feeling, when you're not quite sure where you
are, It's -20C out, soon to be dark and you only got a 1/8 tank left

&gt; &gt; Jeff DeWitt

&gt; It must be cheaper to do it that way rather than design a new skid plate
&gt; and strap setup.

&gt; The later 4.0 YJ's are the same, one tank fits all with just the filler
&gt; vent deeper on the 'smaller' tank.

&gt; Mike

&gt; &gt;&gt; You can drop the tank and remove this ball by trimming the tube back.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Here is a link with directions about halfway down:
&gt; &gt;&gt; http://www.pirate4x4.com/forum/showthread.php?t=453329

&gt; &gt;&gt; You then would need the 19 gallon sender or just realize your gauge
&gt; &gt;&gt; just reads the bottom 3/4 of the tank.  I have had cars like that...

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;  Psychopaths cannot be understood in terms of antisocial rearing or
&gt; development. They are simply morally depraved individuals who
&gt; represent the &quot;monsters&quot; in our society. They are unstoppable and
&gt; untreatable predators whose violence is planned, purposeful and
&gt; emotionless. The violence continues until it reaches a plateau at age
&gt; 60 or so, then tapers off.

&gt; Their emotionlessness reflects a detached, fearless, and possibly
&gt; dissociated state, revealing a low-state autonomic nervous system and
&gt; lack of anxiety. It's difficult to say what motivates them - control
&gt; and dominance possibly - since their life history will usually show no
&gt; long-standing bonds with others nor much rhyme to their reason (other
&gt; than the planning of violence).

&gt; They tend to operate with a grandiose demeanor, an attitude of
&gt; entitlement, an insatiable appetite, and a tendency toward sadism.
&gt; Fearlessness is probably the prototypical (core) characteristic (the
&gt; low-fear hypothesis). It's helpful to think of them as high-speed
&gt; vehicles with ineffective brakes.

&gt; Certain organic (brain) disorders and hormonal imbalances mimic the
&gt; state of mind of a psychopath.

&gt; There are four (4) different subtypes of psychopaths. The oldest
&gt; distinction was made by Cleckley back in 1941 between primary and
&gt; secondary.

&gt; PRIMARY PSYCHOPATHS do not respond to punishment, apprehension,
&gt; stress, or disapproval. They seem to be able to inhibit their
&gt; antisocial impulses most of the time, not because of conscience, but
&gt; because it suits their purpose at the time. Words do not seem to have
&gt; the same meaning for them as they do for us. In fact, it's unclear if
&gt; they even grasp the meaning of their own words, a condition that
&gt; Cleckley called &quot;semantic aphasia.&quot; They don't follow any life plan,
&gt; and it seems as if they are incapable of experiencing any genuine
&gt; emotion.

&gt; SECONDARY PSYCHOPATHS are risk-takers, but are also more likely to be
&gt; stress-reactive, worriers, and guilt-prone. They expose themselves to
&gt; more stress than the average person, but they are as vulnerable to
&gt; stress as the average person. (This suggests that they are not &quot;fully
&gt; psychopathic.&quot; This may be due to distinctive genetic variations.)

&gt; They are daring, adventurous, unconventional people who began playing
&gt; by their own rules early in life. They are strongly driven by a desire
&gt; to escape or avoid pain, but are unable to resist temptation. As their
&gt; anxiety increases toward some forbidden object, so does their
&gt; attraction to it. They live their lives by the lure of temptation.
&gt; Both primary and secondary psychopaths can be subdivided into:

&gt; DISTEMPERED PSYCHOPATHS are the kind that seem to fly into a rage or
&gt; frenzy more easily and more often than other subtypes. Their frenzy
&gt; will resemble an epileptic fit. They are also usually men with
&gt; incredibly strong sex drives, capable of astonishing feats of sexual
&gt; energy, and seemingly obsessed by sexual urges during a large part of
&gt; their waking lives. Powerful cravings also seem to characterize them,
&gt; as in drug addiction, kleptomania, pedophilia, any illicit or illegal
&gt; indulgence. They like the endorphin &quot;high&quot; or &quot;rush&quot; off of excitement
&gt; and risk-taking. The serial-rapist-murderer known as the Boston
&gt; Strangler was such a psychopath.

&gt; CHARISMATIC PSYCHOPATHS are charming, attractive liars. They are
&gt; usually gifted at some talent or another, and they use it to their
&gt; advantage in manipulating others. They are usually fast-talkers, and
&gt; possess an almost demonic ability to persuade others out of everything
&gt; they own, even their lives. Leaders of religious sects or cults, for
&gt; example, might be psychopaths if they lead their followers to their
&gt; deaths. This subtype often comes to believe in their own fictions.
&gt; They are irresistible.

&gt; Sociopaths have always existed in varying form and to various degrees.
&gt; They have been known by various titles. They have been studied using
&gt; various techniques, and through the years their ailment has been
&gt; blamed on various causes. But one thing never varies: all sociopaths
&gt; share three common characteristics. They are all very egocentric
&gt; individuals with no empathy for others, and they are incapable of
&gt; feeling remorse or guilt. [The Sociopath Rebecca Horton (April 1999)]

&gt; While the psychopath has likes and dislikes and fondness for the
&gt; pleasures that human company can bring, analysis shows that he is
&gt; completely egocentric, valuing others only for their enhancement of
&gt; his own pleasure or status. While he gives no real love, he is quite
&gt; capable of inspiring love of sometimes fanatical degree in others.

&gt; He is generally superficially charming and often makes a striking
&gt; impression as possessed of the noblest of human qualities. He makes
&gt; friends easily, and is very manipulative, using his ability with words
&gt; to talk his way out of trouble. Many psychopaths love to be admired
&gt; and bask in the adulation of others.

&gt; With the lack of love, there is also a lack of empathy. The psychopath
&gt; is unable to feel sorry for others in unfortunate situations or put
&gt; himself in another's place, whether or not they have been harmed by
&gt; him.[Gordon Banks]

&gt; How Psychopaths View The World
&gt; Not only do they covet possessions and power, but they gain special
&gt; pleasure in usurping and taking from others (a symbolic sibling, for
&gt; example); what they can plagiarize, swindle, and extort are fruits far
&gt; sweeter than those they can earn through honest labor.

&gt; And once having drained what they can from one source, they turn to
&gt; another to exploit, bleed, and then cast aside; their pleasure in the
&gt; misfortune of others is unquenchable. People are used as a means to an
&gt; end; they are to be subordinated and demeaned so that the antisocial
&gt; can vindicate themselves...

&gt; The causes of this sociopathic disorder have been narrowed to several
&gt; factors through research. One of the primary causes of sociopathic
&gt; behavior is believed to be neurological abnormalities mainly in the
&gt; frontal lobe of the brain. This area is also related to fear
&gt; conditioning. The abnormal anatomy or chemical activity within this
&gt; area of

&gt; Their emotionlessness reflects a detached, fearless, and possibly
&gt; dissociated state, revealing a low-state autonomic nervous system and
&gt; lack of anxiety. It's difficult to say what motivates them - control
&gt; and dominance possibly - since their life history will usually show no
&gt; long-standing bonds with others nor much rhyme to their reason (other
&gt; than the planning of violence).

&gt; They tend to operate with a grandiose demeanor, an attitude of
&gt; entitlement, an insatiable appetite, and a tendency toward sadism.
&gt; Fearlessness is probably the prototypical (core) characteristic (the
&gt; low-fear hypothesis). It's helpful to think of them as high-speed
&gt; vehicles with ineffective brakes.

&gt; Certain organic (brain) disorders and hormonal imbalances mimic the
&gt; state of mind of a psychopath.

&gt; There are four (4) different subtypes of psychopaths. The oldest
&gt; distinction was made by Cleckley back in 1941 between primary and
&gt; secondary.

&gt; PRIMARY PSYCHOPATHS do not respond to punishment, apprehension,
&gt; stress, or disapproval. They seem to be able to inhibit their
&gt; antisocial impulses most of the time, not because of conscience, but
&gt; because it suits their purpose at the time. Words do not seem to have
&gt; the same meaning for them as they do for us. In fact, it's unclear if
&gt; they even grasp the meaning of their own words, a condition that
&gt; Cleckley called &quot;semantic aphasia.&quot; They don't follow any life plan,
&gt; and it seems as if they are incapable of experiencing any genuine
&gt; emotion.

&gt; SECONDARY PSYCHOPATHS are risk-takers, but are also more likely to be
&gt; stress-reactive, worriers, and guilt-prone. They expose themselves to
&gt; more stress than the average person, but they are as vulnerable to
&gt; stress as the average person. (This suggests that they are not &quot;fully
&gt; psychopathic.&quot; This may be due to distinctive genetic variations.)

&gt; They are daring, adventurous, unconventional people who began playing
&gt; by their own rules early in life. They are strongly driven by a desire
&gt; to escape or avoid pain, but are unable to resist temptation. As their
&gt; anxiety increases toward some forbidden object, so does their
&gt; attraction to it. They live their lives by the lure of temptation.
&gt; Both primary and secondary psychopaths can be subdivided into:

&gt; DISTEMPERED PSYCHOPATHS are the kind that seem to fly into a rage or
&gt; frenzy more easily and more often than other subtypes. Their frenzy
&gt; will resemble an epileptic fit. They are also usually men with
&gt; incredibly strong sex drives, capable of astonishing feats of sexual
&gt; energy, and seemingly obsessed by sexual urges during a large part of
&gt; their waking lives. Powerful cravings also seem to characterize them,
&gt; as in drug addiction, kleptomania, pedophilia, any illicit or illegal
&gt; indulgence. They like the endorphin &quot;high&quot; or &quot;rush&quot; off of excitement
&gt; and risk-taking. The serial-rapist-murderer known as the Boston
&gt; Strangler was such a psychopath.

&gt; CHARISMATIC PSYCHOPATHS are charming, attractive liars. They are
&gt; usually gifted at some talent or another, and they use it to their
&gt; advantage in manipulating others. They are usually fast-talkers, and
&gt; possess an almost demonic ability to persuade others out of everything
&gt; they own, even their lives. Leaders of religious sects or cults, for
&gt; example, might be psychopaths if they lead their followers to their
&gt; deaths. This subtype often comes to believe in their own fictions.
&gt; They are irresistible.

&gt; Sociopaths have always existed in varying form and to various degrees.
&gt; They have been known by various titles. They have been studied using
&gt; various techniques, and through the years their ailment has been
&gt; blamed on various causes. But one thing never varies: all sociopaths
&gt; share three common characteristics. They are all very egocentric
&gt; individuals with no empathy for others, and they are incapable of
&gt; feeling remorse or guilt. [The Sociopath Rebecca Horton (April 1999)]

&gt; While the psychopath has likes and dislikes and fondness for the
&gt; pleasures that human company can bring, analysis shows that he is
&gt; completely egocentric, valuing others only for their enhancement of
&gt; his own pleasure or status. While he gives no real love, he is quite
&gt; capable of inspiring love of sometimes fanatical degree in others.

&gt; He is generally superficially charming and often makes a striking
&gt; impression as possessed of the noblest of human qualities. He makes
&gt; friends easily, and is very manipulative, using his ability with words
&gt; to talk his way out of trouble. Many psychopaths love to be admired
&gt; and bask in the adulation of others.

&gt; With the lack of love, there is also a lack of empathy. The psychopath
&gt; is unable to feel sorry for others in unfortunate situations or put
&gt; himself in another's place, whether or not they have been harmed by
&gt; him.[Gordon Banks]

&gt; How Psychopaths View The World
&gt; Not only do they covet possessions and power, but they gain special
&gt; pleasure in usurping and taking from others (a symbolic sibling, for
&gt; example); what they can plagiarize, swindle, and extort are fruits far
&gt; sweeter than those they can earn through honest labor.

&gt; And once having drained what they can from one source, they turn to
&gt; another to exploit, bleed, and then cast aside; their pleasure in the
&gt; misfortune of others is unquenchable. People are used as a means to an
&gt; end; they are to be subordinated and demeaned so that the antisocial
&gt; can vindicate themselves...

&gt; The causes of this sociopathic disorder have been narrowed to several
&gt; factors through research. One of the primary causes of sociopathic
&gt; behavior is believed to be neurological abnormalities mainly in the
&gt; frontal lobe of the brain. This area is also related to fear
&gt; conditioning. The abnormal anatomy or chemical activity within this
&gt; area

&gt; ANTISOCIAL PERSONALITY, SOCIOPATHY, AND PSYCHOPATHY

&gt; Antisocial Personality Disorder (APD) is practically synonymous with
&gt; criminal behavior, but as with all distributions of a disease or
&gt; whatever in a population, it is probable that the majority of people
&gt; with this particular affliction are law-abiding.  Aging,
&gt; overinvolvements, and/or relationships might hold sway over the
&gt; control (or lack of control) in these kind of people, and although
&gt; approaching the study of offenders from a relationship &amp; personality
&gt; disorders point of view may or may not be productive, Dr. Drew is
&gt; probably an adequate source of information on such matters.  Dr.
&gt; Drew's theory (and one with wide ramifications since he pretty much
&gt; defines an antisocial tendency as thinking about one's self first) is
&gt; that women with certain kinds of disorders, like borderline
&gt; personality disorders, tend to be attracted to and hook up with men
&gt; who manifest symptoms of psychopathic personality disorder (see
&gt; Lecture on BPD &amp; OCD) and that such match-ups may or may not be
&gt; dysfunctional.  On the other hand, the field of criminology tends to
&gt; treat APD as so synonymous, in fact, with criminal behavior that
&gt; practically all convicted criminals (65-75%) have it, with
&gt; criminologists often referring to it as a &quot;wastebasket&quot; category.
&gt; Antisocials come is all shapes and sizes, and psychologists consider
&gt; the juvenile version of it to be a juvenile conduct disorder. The main
&gt; characteristic of it is a complete and utter disregard for the rights
&gt; of others and the rules of society. They seldom show anxiety and don't
&gt; feel guilt. Although many people would hope that there's an effective
&gt; treatment, there's really no effective treatment for them other than
&gt; locking them up in a secure facility with such rigid rules that they
&gt; cannot talk their way out. A full list of APD traits would include:

&gt;        &quot;List of Antisocial Personality Disorder Traits&quot;

&gt; Sense of entitlement; Unremorseful; Apathetic to others;
&gt; Unconscionable behavior; Blameful of others; Manipulative and conning;
&gt; Affectively cold; Disparate understanding; Socially irresponsible;
&gt; Disregardful of obligations; Nonconforming to norms; Irresponsible.

&gt; whereas the DSM-IV &quot;clinical&quot; features of Antisocial Personality
&gt; Disorder (with a person having at least three of these
&gt; characteristics) are:

&gt;    &quot;Clinical Symptoms for an Antisocial Personality Disorder
&gt; Diagnosis&quot;

&gt; 1. Failure to conform to social norms;
&gt; 2. Deceitfulness, manipulativeness;
&gt; 3. Impulsivity, failure to plan ahead;
&gt; 4. Irritability, aggressiveness;
&gt; 5. Reckless disregard for the safety of self or others;
&gt; 6. Consistent irresponsibility;
&gt; 7. Lack of remorse after having hurt, mistreated, or stolen from
&gt; another    person.

&gt;   Sociopathy is chiefly characterized by something wrong with the
&gt; person's conscience. They either don't have one, it's full of holes
&gt; like Swiss cheese, or they are somehow able to completely neutralize
&gt; or negate any sense of conscience or future time perspective.
&gt; Sociopaths only care about fulfilling their own needs and desires -
&gt; selfishness and egocentricity to the extreme. Everything and everybody
&gt; else is mentally twisted around in their minds as objects to be used
&gt; in fulfilling their own needs and desires. They often believe they are
&gt; doing something good for society, or at least nothing that bad. The
&gt; term &quot;sociopath&quot; is frequently used by psychologists and sociologists
&gt; alike in referring to persons whose unsocialized character is due
&gt; primarily to parental failures (usually fatherlessness) rather than an
&gt; inherent feature of temperament.  Lykken (1995), for example, clearly
&gt; distinguishes between the sociopath (who is socialized into becoming a
&gt; psychopath) and a &quot;true&quot; psychopath (who is born that way).  However,
&gt; this may only describe the &quot;common sociopath&quot;, as there are at least
&gt; four (4) different subtypes -- common, alienated, aggressive, and
&gt; dyssocial. Commons are characterized mostly by their lack of
&gt; conscience; the alienated by their inability to love or be loved;
&gt; aggressives by a consistent sadistic streak; and dyssocials by an
&gt; ability to abide by gang rules, as long as those rules are the wrong
&gt; rules. As Stout (2005) indicates, it only takes three of the following
&gt; to be defined as a sociopath, and some common sociopathic traits
&gt; include:

&gt;                  &quot;List of Common Sociopathic Traits&quot;

&gt; Egocentricity; Callousness; Impulsivity; Conscience defect;
&gt; Exaggerated sexuality; Excessive boasting; Risk taking; Inability to
&gt; resist temptation; Antagonistic, deprecating attitude toward the
&gt; opposite sex; Lack of interest in bonding with a mate.

&gt;    Psychopathy is a concept subject to much debate, but is usually
&gt; defined as a constellation of affective, interpersonal, and behavioral
&gt; characteristics including egocentricity; impulsivity;
&gt; irresponsibility; shallow emotions; lack of empathy, guilt, or
&gt; remorse; pathological lying; manipulativeness; and the persistent
&gt; violation of social norms and expectations (Cleckley 1976; Hare 1993).
&gt; The crimes of psychopaths are usually stone-cold, remorseless killings
&gt; for no apparent reason. They cold-bloodedly take what they want and do
&gt; as they please without the slightest sense of guilt or regret. In many
&gt; ways, they are natural-born intraspecies predators who satisfy their
&gt; lust for power and control by charm, manipulation, intimidation, and
&gt; violence. While almost all societies would regard them as criminals
&gt; (the exception being frontier or warlike societies where they might
&gt; become heroes, patriots, or leaders), it's important to distinguish
&gt; their behavior from criminal behavior. As a common axiom goes in
&gt; psychology, MOST PSYCHOPATHS ARE ANTISOCIAL PERSONALITIES BUT NOT ALL
&gt; ANTISOCIAL PERSONALITIES ARE PSYCHOPATHS. This is because APD is
&gt; defined mainly by behaviors (Factor 2 antisocial behaviors) and
&gt; doesn't tap the affective/interpersonal dimensions (Factor 1 core
&gt; psychopathic features, narcissism) of psychopathy. Further, criminals
&gt; and APDs tend to &quot;age out&quot; of crime; psychopaths do not, and are at
&gt; high

Who's only way to get attention is to make a fool of its self, with its goat

when the other kids laughed at its attempt to use foul language in
elementary school play grounds, but its just gibberish. Too senile to
remember what he last wrote, like the rest of Florida. You remind me of a
little rat dog, like a Mexican Chiwawa with its senseless barking it's rabid

I thought your attacks were just personal disagreements, but with
passing of my country's Independents Day, I realize these attacks are
stemming from my love of God and America, and that's what you've been doing
all along is declaring your hatred for the United States of America, with
each declaration of my signature, but just too cowardly  to be a terrorist.
It's America, love it, or leave it, so get the f*ck out!
Considering the source, which you're a habitual lair, so these plus your

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; ANTISOCIAL PERSONALITY, SOCIOPATHY, AND PSYCHOPATHY

&gt; Antisocial Personality Disorder (APD) is practically synonymous with
&gt; criminal behavior, but as with all distributions of a disease or
&gt; whatever in a population, it is probable that the majority of people
&gt; with this particular affliction are law-abiding.  Aging,
&gt; overinvolvements, and/or relationships might hold sway over the
&gt; control (or lack of control) in these kind of people, and although
&gt; approaching the study of offenders from a relationship &amp; personality
&gt; disorders point of view may or may not be productive, Dr. Drew is
&gt; probably an adequate source of information on such matters.  Dr.
&gt; Drew's theory (and one with wide ramifications since he pretty much
&gt; defines an antisocial tendency as thinking about one's self first) is
&gt; that women with certain kinds of disorders, like borderline
&gt; personality disorders, tend to be attracted to and hook up with men
&gt; who manifest symptoms of psychopathic personality disorder (see
&gt; Lecture on BPD &amp; OCD) and that such match-ups may or may not be
&gt; dysfunctional.  On the other hand, the field of criminology tends to
&gt; treat APD as so synonymous, in fact, with criminal behavior that
&gt; practically all convicted criminals (65-75%) have it, with
&gt; criminologists often referring to it as a &quot;wastebasket&quot; category.
&gt; Antisocials come is all shapes and sizes, and psychologists consider
&gt; the juvenile version of it to be a juvenile conduct disorder. The main
&gt; characteristic of it is a complete and utter disregard for the rights
&gt; of others and the rules of society. They seldom show anxiety and don't
&gt; feel guilt. Although many people would hope that there's an effective
&gt; treatment, there's really no effective treatment for them other than
&gt; locking them up in a secure facility with such rigid rules that they
&gt; cannot talk their way out. A full list of APD traits would include:

&gt;        &quot;List of Antisocial Personality Disorder Traits&quot;

&gt; Sense of entitlement; Unremorseful; Apathetic to others;
&gt; Unconscionable behavior; Blameful of others; Manipulative and conning;
&gt; Affectively cold; Disparate understanding; Socially irresponsible;
&gt; Disregardful of obligations; Nonconforming to norms; Irresponsible.

&gt; whereas the DSM-IV &quot;clinical&quot; features of Antisocial Personality
&gt; Disorder (with a person having at least three of these
&gt; characteristics) are:

&gt;    &quot;Clinical Symptoms for an Antisocial Personality Disorder
&gt; Diagnosis&quot;

&gt; 1. Failure to conform to social norms;
&gt; 2. Deceitfulness, manipulativeness;
&gt; 3. Impulsivity, failure to plan ahead;
&gt; 4. Irritability, aggressiveness;
&gt; 5. Reckless disregard for the safety of self or others;
&gt; 6. Consistent irresponsibility;
&gt; 7. Lack of remorse after having hurt, mistreated, or stolen from
&gt; another    person.

&gt;   Sociopathy is chiefly characterized by something wrong with the
&gt; person's conscience. They either don't have one, it's full of holes
&gt; like Swiss cheese, or they are somehow able to completely neutralize
&gt; or negate any sense of conscience or future time perspective.
&gt; Sociopaths only care about fulfilling their own needs and desires -
&gt; selfishness and egocentricity to the extreme. Everything and everybody
&gt; else is mentally twisted around in their minds as objects to be used
&gt; in fulfilling their own needs and desires. They often believe they are
&gt; doing something good for society, or at least nothing that bad. The
&gt; term &quot;sociopath&quot; is frequently used by psychologists and sociologists
&gt; alike in referring to persons whose unsocialized character is due
&gt; primarily to parental failures (usually fatherlessness) rather than an
&gt; inherent feature of temperament.  Lykken (1995), for example, clearly
&gt; distinguishes between the sociopath (who is socialized into becoming a
&gt; psychopath) and a &quot;true&quot; psychopath (who is born that way).  However,
&gt; this may only describe the &quot;common sociopath&quot;, as there are at least
&gt; four (4) different subtypes -- common, alienated, aggressive, and
&gt; dyssocial. Commons are characterized mostly by their lack of
&gt; conscience; the alienated by their inability to love or be loved;
&gt; aggressives by a consistent sadistic streak; and dyssocials by an
&gt; ability to abide by gang rules, as long as those rules are the wrong
&gt; rules. As Stout (2005) indicates, it only takes three of the following
&gt; to be defined as a sociopath, and some common sociopathic traits
&gt; include:

&gt;                  &quot;List of Common Sociopathic Traits&quot;

&gt; Egocentricity; Callousness; Impulsivity; Conscience defect;
&gt; Exaggerated sexuality; Excessive boasting; Risk taking; Inability to
&gt; resist temptation; Antagonistic, deprecating attitude toward the
&gt; opposite sex; Lack of interest in bonding with a mate.

&gt;    Psychopathy is a concept subject to much debate, but is usually
&gt; defined as a constellation of affective, interpersonal, and behavioral
&gt; characteristics including egocentricity; impulsivity;
&gt; irresponsibility; shallow emotions; lack of empathy, guilt, or
&gt; remorse; pathological lying; manipulativeness; and the persistent
&gt; violation of social norms and expectations (Cleckley 1976; Hare 1993).
&gt; The crimes of psychopaths are usually stone-cold, remorseless killings
&gt; for no apparent reason. They cold-bloodedly take what they want and do
&gt; as they please without the slightest sense of guilt or regret. In many
&gt; ways, they are natural-born intraspecies predators who satisfy their
&gt; lust for power and control by charm, manipulation, intimidation, and
&gt; violence. While almost all societies would regard them as criminals
&gt; (the exception being frontier or warlike societies where they might
&gt; become heroes, patriots, or leaders), it's important to distinguish
&gt; their behavior from criminal behavior. As a common axiom goes in
&gt; psychology, MOST PSYCHOPATHS ARE ANTISOCIAL PERSONALITIES BUT NOT ALL
&gt; ANTISOCIAL PERSONALITIES ARE PSYCHOPATHS. This is because APD is
&gt; defined mainly by behaviors (Factor 2 antisocial behaviors) and
&gt; doesn't tap the affective/interpersonal dimensions (Factor 1 core
&gt; psychopathic features, narcissism) of psychopathy. Further, criminals
&gt; and APDs tend to &quot;age out&quot; of crime; psychopaths do not, and are at
&gt; high

On my diesel , the worry on an empty tank isn't pulling crud up from the
bottom of the tank, but running the fuel pump dry, since the fuel lubricates
the pump.

'My' fuel pickup has a sock on it and always sucks from the same place
near the bottom of the tank.  If there is crap there, the amount of fuel
in the tank makes no matter.

If there is enough crap to plug the pickup sock or screen, I want to
know about it 'now' so I don't get screwed way out in the bush some day
running low on fuel.

'Usually' I also do a tune up and oil change on them shortly after
buying which also 'includes' a new gas filter.

The only time I ever get 'crud' in my carburetor, is if I run dry on gas
and don't have a prime available so it has to crank and crank which
'can' suck charcoal bits out of the charcoal canister and deposit these
in the float bowl.

If I have my normal gas can on board, I prime the carb first which
prevents this.

On a FI vehicle, this is moot.

They must've changed the spec sheets in later years, 'cause I have a
2006 Wrangler X and my spec sheet does say 19 gallons.  However, the
manual states that when the 'low gas, dummy' light comes on, you have
approximately 2 gallons of gas left.  I have intentionally travelled
as far as I have dared around my town with this light on (never more
than walking distance from a gas station if it quit), and even when I
fill it, I have never been able to put more than 17.5 gallons in it.
So I am not sure if the gauge reads wrong, or if the tank is not
really a 19 gallon tank.

Now you have my curiosity up.... Let me have a lok here.

On my 06 Rubicon Sticker it says it has a 19 gallon tank.
I never gave it too much thought but as far as I remember I have never put
in more than 15 gallons or so.

I usually don't run much lower than the last quarter anyway....

&gt;  The Psychopathy Checklist lets us discuss psychopaths with little
&gt; risk that we are describing simple social deviance or criminality, or
&gt; that we are mislabeling people who have nothing more in common than
&gt; that they have broken the law. But it also provides a detailed picture
&gt; of the disordered personalities of the psychopaths among us. In this
&gt; chapter and the next, I bring that picture into focus by describing
&gt; the more salient features one by one. This chapter looks at the
&gt; emotional and interpersonal traits of this complex personality
&gt; disorder; chapter 4 examines the unstable, characteristically
&gt; antisocial lifestyle of the psychopath.

&gt; Emotional/Interpersonal
&gt; glib and superficial
&gt; egocentric and grandiose
&gt; lack of remorse or guilt
&gt; lack of empathy
&gt; deceitful and manipulative
&gt; shallow emotions
&gt;  Social Deviance
&gt; impulsive
&gt; poor behavior controls
&gt; need for excitement
&gt; lack of responsibility
&gt; early behavior problems
&gt; adult antisocial behavior

&gt; A cautionary note: The Psychopathy Checklist is a complex clinical
&gt; tool for professional use.[1] What follows is a general summary of the
&gt; key traits and behaviors of psychopaths. Do not use these symptoms to
&gt; diagnose yourself or others. A diagnosis requires explicit training
&gt; and access to the formal scoring manual. If you suspect that someone
&gt; you know conforms to the profile described here and in the next
&gt; chapter, and if it is important to you to obtain an expert opinion,
&gt; seek the services of a qualified (registered) forensic psychologist or
&gt; psychiatrist.
&gt; Also, be aware that people who are not psychopaths may have some of
&gt; the symptoms described here. Many people are impulsive, or glib, or
&gt; cold and unfeeling, or antisocial, but this does not mean they are
&gt; psychopaths. Psychopathy is a syndrome--a cluster of related symptoms.

&gt; Psychopaths are often witty and articulate. They can be amusing and
&gt; entertaining conversationalists, ready with a quick and clever
&gt; comeback, and can tell unlikely but convincing stories that cast
&gt; themselves in a good light. They can be very effective in presenting
&gt; themselves well and are often very likable and charming. To some
&gt; people, however, they seem too slick and smooth, too obviously
&gt; insincere and superficial. Astute observers often get the impression
&gt; that psychopaths are play-acting, mechanically &quot;reading their lines.&quot;

&gt; One of my raters described an interview she did with a prisoner: &quot;I
&gt; sat down and took out my clipboard, and the first thing this guy told
&gt; me was what beautiful eyes I had. He managed to work quite a few
&gt; compliments on my appearance into the interview -- couldn't get over
&gt; my hair. So by the time I wrapped things up I was feeling
&gt; unusually...well, pretty. I'm a wary person, especially on the job,
&gt; and can usually spot a phony. When I got back outside, I couldn't
&gt; believe I'd fallen for a line like that.&quot;

&gt; Psychopaths may ramble and tell stories that seem unlikely in light of
&gt; what is known about them. Typically, they attempt to appear familiar
&gt; with sociology, psychiatry, medicine, psychology, philosophy, poetry,
&gt; literature, art, or law. A signpost to this trait is often a smooth
&gt; lack of concern at being found out. One of our prison files describes
&gt; a psychopathic inmate claiming to have advanced degrees in sociology
&gt; and psychology, when in fact he did not even complete high school. He
&gt; maintained the fiction during an interview with one of my students, a
&gt; Ph.D. candidate in psychology; she commented that the inmate was so
&gt; confident in his use of technical jargon and concepts that those not
&gt; familiar with the field of psychology might well have been impressed.
&gt; Variations on this sort of &quot;expert&quot; theme are common among
&gt; psychopaths....

&gt; Psychopaths have a narcissistic and grossly inflated view of their
&gt; self-worth and importance, a truly astounding egocentricity and sense
&gt; of entitlement, and see themselves as the center of the universe, as
&gt; superior beings who are justified in living according to their own
&gt; rules. &quot;It's not that I don't follow the law,&quot; said one of our
&gt; subjects. &quot;I follow my own laws. I never violate my own rules.&quot; She
&gt; then described these rules in terms of &quot;looking out for number one.&quot;

&gt; When another psychopath, in prison for a variety of crimes including
&gt; robbery, rape, and fraud, was asked if he had any weaknesses, he
&gt; replied, &quot;I don't have any weaknesses, except maybe I'm too caring.&quot;
&gt; On a 10-point scale he rated himself &quot;an all-round 10. I would have
&gt; said 12, but that would be bragging. If I had a better education I'd
&gt; be brilliant.&quot;

&gt; The grandiosity and pomposity of some psychopaths often emerges in
&gt; dramatic fashion in the courtroom. For example, it is not unusual for
&gt; them to criticize or fire their lawyers and to take over their own
&gt; defense, usually with disastrous results. &quot;My partner got a year. I
&gt; got two because of a shithead lawyer,&quot; said one of our subjects. He
&gt; later handled his own appeal and saw his sentence increased to three
&gt; years.

&gt; Psychopaths often come across as arrogant, shameless braggarts --
&gt; self-assured, opinionated, domineering, and cocky. They love to have
&gt; power and control over others and seem unable to believe that other
&gt; people have valid opinions different from theirs. They appear
&gt; charismatic or &quot;electrifying&quot; to some people.

&gt; Psychopaths are seldom embarrassed about their legal, financial, or
&gt; personal problems. Rather, they see them as temporary setbacks, the
&gt; results of bad luck, unfaithful friends, or an unfair and incompetent
&gt; system.

&gt; Although psychopaths often claim to have specific goals, they show
&gt; little understanding of the qualifications required -- they have no
&gt; idea how to achieve their goals and little or no chance of attaining
&gt; them, given their track record and lack of sustained interest in
&gt; education. The psychopathic inmate thinking about parole might outline
&gt; vague plans to become a property tycoon or a lawyer for the poor. One
&gt; inmate, not particularly literate, managed to copyright the title of a
&gt; book he was planning to write about himself and was already counting

Who's only way to get attention is to make a fool of its self, with its goat
obsession/fetish, where it writes via remailers, to no one's surprise. Like
when the other kids laughed at its attempt to use foul language in
elementary school play grounds, but its just gibberish. Too senile to
remember what he last wrote, like the rest of Florida. You remind me of a
little rat dog, like a Mexican Chiwawa with its senseless barking it's rabid
head off, me too, me too. And is too afraid to use your name, address, or
even sign your statement as any man would, totally worthless!

I thought your attacks were just personal disagreements, but with
passing of my country's Independents Day, I realize these attacks are
stemming from my love of God and America, and that's what you've been doing
all along is declaring your hatred for the United States of America, with
each declaration of my signature, but just too cowardly  to be a terrorist.
It's America, love it, or leave it, so get the f*ck out!
Considering the source, which you're a habitual lair, so these plus your
other accusations would be thrown out of court.
When are you going to take responsibility for yourself, and become a
man??????????
People that follow astrology, know the traits you have listed are a
hundred eighty out from any Capricorn.

Is this what your Psychologist wrote about you? They don't fit any
Capricorn, sounds like a spoil Leo.
You're a LIAR and never been in the Service much less Vietnam, as you
suggest!!!!!
If you think I'm a Psycho, then report me to my friends at the San Diego
Sheriffs Department.
I'm just really curious as to who you think will believe you over any
man responsible enough to list his name and address here and in every place
I know of????? All you can do is lie, as most everything you have said
contradicts it's self.
You know what they say, once a faggot coward, always a faggot coward.
I won't give up until traitors like you are gone from these groups I
participate and see you've pretty well killed this group I will devote my
life to reminding your groups who you are!!!!!!!

&gt;  The Psychopathy Checklist lets us discuss psychopaths with little
&gt; risk that we are describing simple social deviance or criminality, or
&gt; that we are mislabeling people who have nothing more in common than
&gt; that they have broken the law. But it also provides a detailed picture
&gt; of the disordered personalities of the psychopaths among us. In this
&gt; chapter and the next, I bring that picture into focus by describing
&gt; the more salient features one by one. This chapter looks at the
&gt; emotional and interpersonal traits of this complex personality
&gt; disorder; chapter 4 examines the unstable, characteristically
&gt; antisocial lifestyle of the psychopath.

&gt; Emotional/Interpersonal
&gt; glib and superficial
&gt; egocentric and grandiose
&gt; lack of remorse or guilt
&gt; lack of empathy
&gt; deceitful and manipulative
&gt; shallow emotions
&gt;  Social Deviance
&gt; impulsive
&gt; poor behavior controls
&gt; need for excitement
&gt; lack of responsibility
&gt; early behavior problems
&gt; adult antisocial behavior

&gt; A cautionary note: The Psychopathy Checklist is a complex clinical
&gt; tool for professional use.[1] What follows is a general summary of the
&gt; key traits and behaviors of psychopaths. Do not use these symptoms to
&gt; diagnose yourself or others. A diagnosis requires explicit training
&gt; and access to the formal scoring manual. If you suspect that someone
&gt; you know conforms to the profile described here and in the next
&gt; chapter, and if it is important to you to obtain an expert opinion,
&gt; seek the services of a qualified (registered) forensic psychologist or
&gt; psychiatrist.
&gt; Also, be aware that people who are not psychopaths may have some of
&gt; the symptoms described here. Many people are impulsive, or glib, or
&gt; cold and unfeeling, or antisocial, but this does not mean they are
&gt; psychopaths. Psychopathy is a syndrome--a cluster of related symptoms.

&gt; Psychopaths are often witty and articulate. They can be amusing and
&gt; entertaining conversationalists, ready with a quick and clever
&gt; comeback, and can tell unlikely but convincing stories that cast
&gt; themselves in a good light. They can be very effective in presenting
&gt; themselves well and are often very likable and charming. To some
&gt; people, however, they seem too slick and smooth, too obviously
&gt; insincere and superficial. Astute observers often get the impression
&gt; that psychopaths are play-acting, mechanically &quot;reading their lines.&quot;

&gt; One of my raters described an interview she did with a prisoner: &quot;I
&gt; sat down and took out my clipboard, and the first thing this guy told
&gt; me was what beautiful eyes I had. He managed to work quite a few
&gt; compliments on my appearance into the interview -- couldn't get over
&gt; my hair. So by the time I wrapped things up I was feeling
&gt; unusually...well, pretty. I'm a wary person, especially on the job,
&gt; and can usually spot a phony. When I got back outside, I couldn't
&gt; believe I'd fallen for a line like that.&quot;

&gt; Psychopaths may ramble and tell stories that seem unlikely in light of
&gt; what is known about them. Typically, they attempt to appear familiar
&gt; with sociology, psychiatry, medicine, psychology, philosophy, poetry,
&gt; literature, art, or law. A signpost to this trait is often a smooth
&gt; lack of concern at being found out. One of our prison files describes
&gt; a psychopathic inmate claiming to have advanced degrees in sociology
&gt; and psychology, when in fact he did not even complete high school. He
&gt; maintained the fiction during an interview with one of my students, a
&gt; Ph.D. candidate in psychology; she commented that the inmate was so
&gt; confident in his use of technical jargon and concepts that those not
&gt; familiar with the field of psychology might well have been impressed.
&gt; Variations on this sort of &quot;expert&quot; theme are common among
&gt; psychopaths....

&gt; Psychopaths have a narcissistic and grossly inflated view of their
&gt; self-worth and importance, a truly astounding egocentricity and sense
&gt; of entitlement, and see themselves as the center of the universe, as
&gt; superior beings who are justified in living according to their own
&gt; rules. &quot;It's not that I don't follow the law,&quot; said one of our
&gt; subjects. &quot;I follow my own laws. I never violate my own rules.&quot; She
&gt; then described these rules in terms of &quot;looking out for number one.&quot;

&gt; When another psychopath, in prison for a variety of crimes including
&gt; robbery, rape, and fraud, was asked if he had any weaknesses, he
&gt; replied, &quot;I don't have any weaknesses, except maybe I'm too caring.&quot;
&gt; On a 10-point scale he rated himself &quot;an all-round 10. I would have
&gt; said 12, but that would be bragging. If I had a better education I'd
&gt; be brilliant.&quot;

&gt; The grandiosity and pomposity of some psychopaths often emerges in
&gt; dramatic fashion in the courtroom. For example, it is not unusual for
&gt; them to criticize or fire their lawyers and to take over their own
&gt; defense, usually with disastrous results. &quot;My partner got a year. I
&gt; got two because of a shithead lawyer,&quot; said one of our subjects. He
&gt; later handled his own appeal and saw his sentence increased to three
&gt; years.

&gt; Psychopaths often come across as arrogant, shameless braggarts --
&gt; self-assured, opinionated, domineering, and cocky. They love to have
&gt; power and control over others and seem unable to believe that other
&gt; people have valid opinions different from theirs. They appear
&gt; charismatic or &quot;electrifying&quot; to some people.

&gt; Psychopaths are seldom embarrassed about their legal, financial, or
&gt; personal problems. Rather, they see them as temporary setbacks, the
&gt; results of bad luck, unfaithful friends, or an unfair and incompetent
&gt; system.

&gt; Although psychopaths often claim to have specific goals, they show
&gt; little understanding of the qualifications required -- they have no
&gt; idea how to achieve their goals and little or no chance of attaining
&gt; them, given their track record and lack of sustained interest in
&gt; education. The psychopathic inmate thinking about parole might outline
&gt; vague plans to become a property tycoon or a lawyer for the poor. One
&gt; inmate, not particularly literate, managed to copyright the title of a
&gt; book he was planning to write about himself and was already counting

More likely, it was some kind of government requirement or an attempt to
increase gas mileage.  The trick on the web sites suggest that the vent
hose was long enough to airlock the tank at the lower level - wish it was
that simple on my Comanche!  Even I can manage the effort to cut off a
rubber hose.

&gt; &gt; &gt;It is an either or situation on the TJ I believe unlike the YJ were they
&gt; &gt; &gt;just 'faked' the 15 gallon tank by moving the filler vent.
&gt; Actually if you really knew anything you would know that 15 gallons is
&gt; standard and there was a option for a 20 gallon tank.
&gt; What did he say that was wrong and that would warrant such a
&gt; condescending response? Not only that but there was nothing relevant or
&gt; contributary in your post. You're really reaching far to insult others

Snowman seems to stalk MikeR and always try to point out anything he
doesn't agree with.
His posts always seem to be right after Mikes.

Recently he said
&quot;BTW, if you want to restart this fued I will tear you a new one ...
Your little more than a BSing troll with abig EGO problem.
TheSnoMan.com&quot;

Clearly, to most of us, MikeR is more than a BSing troll...  :-)

But when he talks smack about something like this gas tank capacity
issue, and is proven wrong again,
he doesn't post back.  Huh, I wonder why?
