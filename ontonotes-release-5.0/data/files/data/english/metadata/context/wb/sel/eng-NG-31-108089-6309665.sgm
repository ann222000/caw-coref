Hey Curly,
You don't owe me, and you don't know me, really, but I'd like to hear the
(short) story behind your bike's moniker, with a picture across the street
if you're willing to show and tell.

Coffee's on me.

Scheduled to see my doc tuesday at 3:45 . I'm pretty sure I've got a
dislocated (carpal ? metacarpal ?) bone in my hand , which he should be able
to fix in his office . Hopefully no broken bones , cuz they take a while to
heal ... if it's just dislocated , I'll be up and ridin' much sooner .
A short run on mama's yesterday convinced me I don't need to be on any big
bike just yet .

That's a beauty.  Thanks for the pic.
This round's on me.

Took the FXR our for a two hour spin today. It was almost 45F.  Got up into
Ringe, NH following Rte 119 out of Groton, MA before turning around.
Beautiful ride. I can't wait for it to get warm enough that I can just keep
on going until it gets time to bed down somewhere up in Vermont for the
night.

It's a '90 ultra , just had a top end , tranny has been rebuilt (shifter
fork issues ) . He's got all the originals but exhaust .
The "custom paint" is OK , if not what I'd have chosen . A little peeling
damage I need to repair , and the hard lowers need to be painted to match .
And it was a thou less than I got for the '76 . Just enough to buy tags ,
sales tax here is a killer .
I'm ready to go get it , the insurance check has cleared , but my hand
still has some problems . Target date is friday ...

For lack of proper terminology, do you not get the trade in/sale

it would be a taxless transaction since the new bikes cost is
lower than the totaled/sold one.

We can apply for a sales tax rebate if we dispose of one vehicle and
buy another. You might be able to get the tax back on the cheaper of
the two vehicles.

My friend Mahesh moved there maybe ten or twelve years ago.  He found it
to be kind of cold and unfriendly.  But then Mahesh is about four and a
half feet tall and Indian (dots, not feathers).  There was nobody
anything like Mahesh in Bentonville.

Until he saved up enough money to bring his wife over.  Then he liked it
a bit better.

So if you're a white guy you'll probably do fine. Or probably if you're
a black guy you'll do as well as most places.

But if baba ganoosh is part of your regular diet, you might find it lacking.

Unless Mahesh is still there and you can find him.

I'm no fan of the Walton legacy, but................
NW Arkansas is chock full of good riding roads and you can ride
year round.  Lots of business opportunities, UA is next door in
Fayetteville and they are supposed to be opening another medical
campus there soon.  The area is probably the most rapidly expanding
business area in the state.  FWIW according to a recent article in the
state paper the fastest growing segment of the population in the area is
Spanish speaking folks.  The article went on to outline the reasons
(I forget other than multiple job possibilities) why the area is becoming
a very culturally diverse area.  They focused on a group from some very
small island that had adopted NW AR as their new home.  It was a
pretty interesting read.

But the best reason would be that you could make the Snow Run.
Ya know, they do say Arkansas is the "Land of opportunity",
well at least it used to say that on our license plates.

Well I'm not a big fan of some of Wal-Marts personnel practices and
that they've killed a lot of small sole proprietorships in a lot of
towns that they've moved into.  However, that being said I'm in IT,
and Wal-Mart has some of the most cutting edge IT systems in the
retail industry and view it as a business essential function, not a
cost to be mitigated.

Yeah, he did.  Dunno if he's still there or not.  He's good people,
whether or not he's still there.  Smart, hard working, modest, and

I agree with this. Some of the most polite I've ever met, too. We had a
student years ago who would *always* start off a conversation with
"hello" and "how are you" and actually be interested in the answer. He
was such a good guy. Handsome as all hell, too. Honest as the day is
long. I loaned him a pencil once and when he returned it(!), he taped it
to my desk so it wouldn't roll off and get lost.

Diversity is a good thing. I even practice it in my own household. ;-)

I know we're not supposed to categorize or stereotype folks, but
certain things about some groups just seem to ring true more often
then not.  I agree with everything you said and it has been my
experience as well.  Seems an awful lot of First Gen Immigrants have
those qualities (well the legal ones anyhow).  Maybe its being an
American that screws them up.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Did he go to work for Wal-Mart?  I've worked with a lot of Indians and
&gt;&gt;&gt; by-in-large find them to be good people.  Damn hard working people, or
&gt;&gt;&gt; at least the ones in IT that I've met are.
&gt;&gt; I agree with this. Some of the most polite I've ever met, too. We had a
&gt;&gt; student years ago who would *always* start off a conversation with
&gt;&gt; &quot;hello&quot; and &quot;how are you&quot; and actually be interested in the answer. He
&gt;&gt; was such a good guy. Handsome as all hell, too. Honest as the day is
&gt;&gt; long. I loaned him a pencil once and when he returned it(!), he taped it
&gt;&gt; to my desk so it wouldn't roll off and get lost.

heh heh heh We had a lot of international students in our department and
yeah, I know about not categorizing or stereotyping, but I saw lots of
traits in different nationalities that were admirable. And a bunch in
our American students that were downright embarrassing in comparison.

No, of course not. I'm such a wonderful, fantastic person that I can
take it all in stride and just smile. I could go on, but I'm very modest.

I was quite blessed to read a story in the local (my town, not
Portland) newspaper this morning.  It was about a guy that took Castro
up on his 1994 offer to let anyone leave Cuba, as long as they did it
within week of his announcement.  He and a few of his buddies strapped
six inner tubes together and made a run for the border.  They are some
of the ones that made it.  Clinton got a touch of the cold feet and
sent every one of the refugees to Guantanamo to have background checks
run.  The guy was there for a little over a year and a half.

When he finally did get to come to the States, the agency that helped
him had a few places he could relocate to... one was Oregon.  God
knows why he chose Oregon, but he did.

He went to work as a dishwasher in a pretty nice restaurant in
downtown Portland, because a few people spoke Spanish there.  He
studied long and hard to learn English and rose up through bus boy,
bartender etc.

As he was working at the restaurant, he did odd jobs on the side.
Everybody loved his work.  On the advice of a friend, he quit the
restaurant and started his own remodeling business.

The picture in the paper showed him standing next to his new Chevy
van, that has his business name and logo on its side, in front of his
home in Milwaukie, Oregon.

According to the gent, the American dream is still alive and well, and
that anyone who wants to put in some hard work, and an effort at
assimilating, can achieve any damn thing they want.

&gt;&gt; Well Speaking of Arkansas, what do you think of Bentoville &lt;sp?&gt;.
&gt;&gt; Wal-Mart is recruiting me for a job and I think that is where their HQ
&gt;&gt; is.  Like to get a little first hand info.

&gt;My friend Mahesh moved there maybe ten or twelve years ago.  He found it
&gt;to be kind of cold and unfriendly.  But then Mahesh is about four and a
&gt;half feet tall and Indian (dots, not feathers).  There was nobody
&gt;anything like Mahesh in Bentonville.

&gt;Until he saved up enough money to bring his wife over.  Then he liked it
&gt;a bit better.

&gt;So if you're a white guy you'll probably do fine. Or probably if you're
&gt;a black guy you'll do as well as most places.

&gt;But if baba ganoosh is part of your regular diet, you might find it lacking.

&gt;Unless Mahesh is still there and you can find him.

Well, I"m white(sorta pasty, really)and I found Arkansas a bit
stand-offish for a while.  I moved here from SoCal and it took them a
while to see that I(unlike a lot of Californiains that move
here)didn't want to change them or their lifestyle.
After they figured that out, I've done pretty good.
The roads here are the bomb for a m/c rider, too.
