&quot;What's So Bad about Abortion&quot; - Everything!

By Alice Lemos

August 14, 2007

On August 9th, I took the subway home after an evening at the Society
for (un)Ethical Culture on West 64th Street in Manhattan where a pro
abortion panel discussed &quot;What's so bad about abortion&quot;. I immediately
hugged my son and took a long shower to wipe off the filth and general
slime I had encountered earlier. I felt I had been in the presence of
evil. I had run into pro aborts at all sorts of events. Heaven knows I
have sat next to them on the subway. But I had never heard a real live
female abortionist say in public, &quot;I love women and I love children
and I love life!&quot; - with no sense of irony whatsoever. Then, why,
lady, do you kill babies if you love children so much? So many lies
and so much propaganda in such a small room!

The members of this illustrious panel, chaired by Jean Smith of New
York Salon, included such famous slimeballs as: Donna Crane, Director,
Government Relations, for NARAL, which has now changed its name to
&quot;NARAL Pro Choice America&quot; in the vain hope of cleaning up its scuzzy
image; the always lying Vicki Saporta, president and CEO of the
National Abortion Federation, a group whose prior president, Ron
Fitzsimmons, has admitted lying to congress about the number of
partial birth abortions performed in America; the weird Ann Furedi,
CEO of British Pregnancy Advisory Service, which helps abort babies in
the island nation which is rapidly disappearing into the Caliphate of
Europe (how does that burka fit, Anne); and last, but not least, the
chipper Kirsten Moore, President and CEO of Reproductive Health
Technologies Project who told us that pro choicers are not extremists
although she would have no problem with other women aborting babies if
they carried the &quot;brown eyed gene&quot; or the &quot;gay gene&quot; in response to a
question from a member of the Columbia University Republicans. So many
CEOs, and so few brains! Also present was a bald man who resembled
Mister Clean who works at Planned Parenthood, several lesbians, and
several elderly proaborts who have less of a chance of becoming
pregnant than I do after my hysterectomy - plus the usual trampy pro
abortion young chics who blatthered about their &quot;autonomy&quot; (i.e.,
their right to be as callous as men). I am not a CEO. Just a humble
single mother who feels &quot;fully integrated into society&quot; and &quot;very
autonomous&quot;.

Mr. Clean informed us that he '&quot;really respects&quot; pro lifers (which
means he really doesn't) and that if his 16 year old daughter became
pregnant, he doesn't want her to ruin her life by having his
grandchild. What a guy! I wonder if there is another one like him at
home.

The biggest liar in the group, by far, was Ms. Saporta, who has
dedicated a lifetime in the pursuit of destoying babies and women's
lives. She gave the usual false statistics about &quot;women who have died
in back alley abortions&quot; and referred to her favorite Third World
country, Peru, where abortion is illegal. She claimed that gazillions
of Peruvian women have &quot;died in illegal abortions&quot; but did not bother
to mention the number of women who have died from cholera, dysintery
and generally poor public health conditions. So much for the facts.
Oh, yes, and she is &quot;not an extremist&quot; although she would not answer
my question about what the penalty should be for a man who shoots a
pregnant woman in the stomach.

The British broad informed us that abortions are up in the island
nation and that &quot;this is good because it means that more people are
having more sex!&quot; She was not joking when she said that and that
comment elicited a giggle from the trampier members of the audience.
She is another CEO!

Ms. Crane tried to tell us what life would be like without Roe. She
warned us that the matter &quot;would not go back to the states&quot; (a naked
lie) and that police (probably from Peru, everybody's favorite Third
World Nation) would be in the maternity wards to arrest women who had
aborted. She also claimed to be a &quot;civil libertarian&quot; although she did
not recognize the humanity of the dead babies - or their separate DNA.
She also stated that &quot;abortion has been around forever&quot; which is why
it should be legal. Using her logic, wife beating has been around
forever and thus should be legalized. She is not a CEO but she is a
&quot;Director&quot;.

This panel totally disparaged crisis pregnancy centers, sonograms and
post abortion syndrome. Their information on cps was based on a report
issued by famous dummie congressman Henry Waxman of California, who
claimed that &quot;130% of crisis pregnancy centers give false medical
information&quot; (or maybe it was 200%?) without bothering to mention the
misinformation given out by Planned Parenthood, a non profit
organization that has a billion dollar a year budget.

The bright notes of the evening were the wonderful young pro-life
people who attended. They included a young woman who is a social
worker; memers of the college Republicans from Columbia University, a
black woman who works in a cpc, a young man who does sidewalk
counseling, and a couple of my wonderful friends. The pro-abortion
moderator was forced to admit that apparently young people are more
pro life than people of her generation and they certainly are our
hope. The unhinged attacks on crisis pregnancy centers, which operate
on shoe string budgets, and the refusal to admit the pain that women
feel after abortion lead me to believe that the other side realizes
that it is losing. This is truly a &quot;clash of civilizations&quot; or a clash
of visions of the world. As &quot;Greg&quot; the young sidewalk counsellor put
it, &quot;You have not mentioned God, father or babies&quot;. They simply do not
fit into the hedonistic vision of the world that the Furedis,
Saportas, Moores and Cranes have in which it is all about me, myself
and I. Half the panel actually admitted that abortion is the &quot;taking
of a life&quot; - but they are down with it. These truly are sad, souless
people who earn their livings off the misery of others. Their days are
numbered.

As an atheist, I am nonetheless appalled at the hate and bigotry of
some religion haters. You are no different from a Talibanni, in
demanding that views other than yours be Ad Hominemed.

I prefer to meet religious views with *reasoned* opposition, but I
understand that that takes brains and empathy, two traits that
the knee jerk haters utterly *lack*.

Thank you for so clearly and easily showing which camp you are
a True Member of.

I never heard of ANYONE  being &quot;pro-abortion&quot;.  That would be like
being pro-tonsillectomy.  Either of those medical procedures should
be a matter between patient and physician.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Does your religion have your so used to not using your brain that you
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; are not even capable of posting an original thought, but rather, are
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; reliant on the mindless drooling of your religious, whackjob cohorts
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; which you constantly cut-n-paste from?

&gt; &gt; &gt; As an atheist, I am nonetheless appalled at the hate and bigotry of
&gt; &gt; &gt; some religion haters. You are no different from a Talibanni, in
&gt; &gt; &gt; demanding that views other than yours be Ad Hominemed.

&gt; &gt; The Taliban banned all opposition to their views.

&gt; Indeed. They had absolute power, not having to deal with the
&gt; inconvenience thats democracy.

&gt; &gt; I don't see where
&gt; &gt; Pr03p suggested that Sound of Trumpet be banned from speaking.

&gt; Oh, of course not. All he did was to call many vile names at anyone
&gt; who dared disagree with his views.

You're making unfounded assumptions. Showme where he said he wanted

&gt; &gt; I had a letter to the editor published where I pointed out that I

&gt; &gt; mentioned that he had never gotten such a letter of comment

&gt; &gt; people MUST hold ONLY ONE view in areas where other
&gt; &gt; religious folks tended to hold the opposing view.

&gt; &gt; But, not all religious people agree on many social issues,
&gt; &gt; so it logically follows that not all non religious people MUST all
&gt; &gt; agree on many social issues as well. As I said, intelligent

What has religion got to do with it? Are you saying that atheists
belive in the mass murder
of innocent unborn babies because they do not fear
God?  You didn't even address one of the points
raised in her post.  Ever heard of adoption?
Normal women are born with maternal instincts,
abnormal women are not. Normal men are born with
paternal instincts, abnormal men are not.  Which
one are you?

&gt; &gt; &gt; The Taliban banned all opposition to their views.

&gt; &gt; Indeed. They had absolute power, not having to deal with the
&gt; &gt; inconvenience thats democracy.

&gt; &gt; &gt; I don't see where
&gt; &gt; &gt; Pr03p suggested that Sound of Trumpet be banned from speaking.

&gt; &gt; Oh, of course not. All he did was to call many vile names at anyone
&gt; &gt; who dared disagree with his views.

&gt; &quot;religious whackjob&quot; is a vile name?   Good god man, grow a set of
&gt; balls.

&gt; &gt; The ONLY difference between his bigoted ass and the Taliban
&gt; &gt; is his bigoted ass has NO power.

&gt; &gt; &gt; I think your Taliban analogy is unfair.

&gt; &gt; Thats OK, you're allowed to be utterly... *wrong*.

&gt; &gt; The &quot; tolerance &quot; crowd is often like that bigoted pustule; Full of
&gt; &gt; hate and an *inability* to debate/refute the views that they would
&gt; &gt; ban, *if they could*. Campus speech codes show the truth of
&gt; &gt; that.

&gt; You call yourself an atheist, but quite frankly, you sound just like a
&gt; religious whackjob who's having an identity crisis.

Since he is using the name of a well-known
satanist and jew, he has his own religion,
it's known as anti-God, anti-Christianity
and pro evil and death.

&gt;  Normal women are born with maternal instincts,
&gt;  abnormal women are not. Normal men are born with
&gt;  paternal instincts, abnormal men are not.  Which
&gt;  one are you?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Does your religion have your so used to not using your brain that you
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; are not even capable of posting an original thought, but rather, are
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; reliant on the mindless drooling of your religious, whackjob cohorts
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; which you constantly cut-n-paste from?

&gt; &gt; &gt; As an atheist, I am nonetheless appalled at the hate and bigotry of
&gt; &gt; &gt; some religion haters. You are no different from a Talibanni, in
&gt; &gt; &gt; demanding that views other than yours be Ad Hominemed.

&gt; &gt;  &quot;Albert Lieven&quot;?  That name sounds familiar,
&gt; &gt;   are *you* that yid satanist?

&gt; &gt; &gt; I prefer to meet religious views with *reasoned* opposition, but I
&gt; &gt; &gt; understand that that takes brains and empathy, two traits that
&gt; &gt; &gt; the knee jerk haters utterly *lack*.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Thank you for so clearly and easily showing which camp you are
&gt; &gt; &gt; a True Member of.

&gt; &gt; &gt; PLONK.

&gt; &gt;  &quot;Killfile&quot; The net equivaleant of earplugs for the
&gt; &gt;  braindead - and cowards.

&gt; You're a brain-dead whore who's unable to comprehend that people
&gt; are not obliged to pay attention to you.
">

Indeed. If one so displays that that one cannot debate/refute the
topic at hand, shunning such a pathetic attention whore is
entirely a reasonable thing to do.

Now, to that topic at hand: As it stands now, women are allowed
more than one non medical and non biological legal means to void
all legal parental rights and obligations, not only post coitally, but
post natally. To grant such non medical and non biological legal
rights solely based on SEX is, well, sexist.

The means I mention are Legal Abandon Laws and Legal Adopting
Out Laws. They exist solely for women, yet bear no connection to
either biology or medicine. To grant men similar post coital legal
means to say &quot; No, thanks &quot; to the legal status of obligated parent
would not only be easy, but it would be entirely within the concept
of Equal Protection Under The Law. Equal rights. Even for men.

What a concept.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Does your religion have your so used to not using your brain that you
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; are not even capable of posting an original thought, but rather, are

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As an atheist, I am nonetheless appalled at the hate and bigotry of

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; demanding that views other than yours be Ad Hominemed.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The Taliban banned all opposition to their views.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Indeed. They had absolute power, not having to deal with the
&gt; &gt; &gt; inconvenience thats democracy.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I don't see where
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Pr03p suggested that Sound of Trumpet be banned from speaking.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Oh, of course not. All he did was to call many vile names at anyone
&gt; &gt; &gt; who dared disagree with his views.

&gt; &gt; &quot;religious whackjob&quot; is a vile name?   Good god man, grow a set of
&gt; &gt; balls.

&gt; &gt; &gt; The ONLY difference between his bigoted ass and the Taliban
&gt; &gt; &gt; is his bigoted ass has NO power.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I think your Taliban analogy is unfair.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Thats OK, you're allowed to be utterly... *wrong*.

&gt; &gt; &gt; The &quot; tolerance &quot; crowd is often like that bigoted pustule; Full of
&gt; &gt; &gt; hate and an *inability* to debate/refute the views that they would
&gt; &gt; &gt; ban, *if they could*. Campus speech codes show the truth of
&gt; &gt; &gt; that.

&gt; &gt; You call yourself an atheist, but quite frankly, you sound just like a

&gt;   Since he is using the name of a well-known

The maternal instinct in the woman is far stronger than the paternal
instinct in the male.
There is a saying &quot;No men really want children&quot;.
Some do want a son to carry on family line and this kind of thing - but this
is not really an instinct - more an ego.
You will find that children only occur in marriages where there is not love.
When they are truly happy with your partner - and indeed - truly in love -
you only have eyes for them - thoughts for them - they are your world - your
existence.
When you wish to introduce a third party - this is because the partner is
not sufficient to fulfil all you require - boredom - these kind of reasons.
It is lucky so few humans do really love each other - or the human race
would die out.
But would this be such a bad thing?

You sound like a very nice person.  Perhaps we should get to know you
better.
Did you consider the feelings of the person you are addressing?

the men who stand by and allow them to kill their child.

I think I'll make that my sig, I like the sound of it.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;What's So Bad about Abortion&quot; - Everything!

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; By Alice Lemos

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;snip&gt;

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Does your religion have your so used to not using your brain that you
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; are not even capable of posting an original thought, but rather, are
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; reliant on the mindless drooling of your religious, whackjob cohorts
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; which you constantly cut-n-paste from?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As an atheist, I am nonetheless appalled at the hate and bigotry of some religion haters. You are no different from a Talibanni, in demanding that views other than yours be Ad Hominemed.

&gt; &gt; &gt;  &quot;Albert Lieven&quot;?  That name sounds familiar,
&gt; &gt; &gt;   are *you* that yid satanist?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I prefer to meet religious views with *reasoned* opposition, but I
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; understand that that takes brains and empathy, two traits that  the knee jerk haters utterly *lack*.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thank you for so clearly and easily showing which camp you are a True Member of.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; PLONK.

&gt; &gt; &gt;  &quot;Killfile&quot; The net equivaleant of earplugs for the
&gt; &gt; &gt;  braindead - and cowards.

&gt; &gt; You're a brain-dead whore who's unable to comprehend that people
&gt; &gt; are not obliged to pay attention to you.

&gt; Indeed. If one so displays that that one cannot debate/refute the
&gt; topic at hand, shunning such a pathetic attention whore is
&gt; entirely a reasonable thing to do.

Both you and retard gwennie appear to be experts
on &quot;whores&quot;, no doubt you both have had personal experiences
with them. Aren't they the ones who kill their unborn?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Now, to that topic at hand: As it stands now, women are allowed
&gt; more than one non medical and non biological legal means to void all legal parental rights and obligations, not only post coitally, but post natally. To grant such non medical and non biological legal rights solely based on SEX is, well, sexist.
">

You are an idiot.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; The means I mention are Legal Abandon Laws and Legal Adopting Out Laws. They exist solely for women, yet bear no connection to either biology or medicine. To grant men similar post coital legal means to say &quot; No, thanks &quot; to the legal status of obligated parent
&gt; would not only be easy, but it would be entirely within the concept
&gt; of Equal Protection Under The Law. Equal rights. Even for men.

Men can claim the child of a relationship if the mother
does not want the child and many men do so.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; What a concept.
">

What utter and complete rubbish.  Why is *this* being cross-posted to
alt.religion christian roman catholic?  Is the idiot
who posted it there anti-Catholic for some reason?  Such
bigotry.
