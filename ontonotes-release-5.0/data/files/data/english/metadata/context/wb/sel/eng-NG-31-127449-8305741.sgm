How much do you pay per mile for public transport (of any kind)?

An interesting article in today's Guardian about some of the
incredible prices charged for certain journeys:

&quot;Are Britain's trains the most expensive in the world?&quot;
http://www.guardian.co.uk/g2/story/0,,2134710,00.html

The highest they can come up with is £64.50 per mile (currently
$132.44) for a London Underground journey from Charing Cross to
Embankment.  Although, to be fair, the distance between the two
stations is only about 200 yards - they're on opposite sides and ends
of a very short street.  Still, a staggering amount of money.

I average about 25 cents per mile, I suspect. Transportation here
costs a dollar a bus ride full fare, 85 cents if you use a 10 ride
passes and 30 dollars for a monthly pass for unlimted rides.  I
usually spend less than 30 bucks a month so it is not worth it for me.
Length of trip is irrelevnant.  Public transit (buses) are usually
reliable here in Lansing, Michigan.

I think that generally public transport should be free. I know that
doesn't address you question exactly but I think that any attempt to
charge people to use public transport just reduces movement and that
reduces efficiency for people and for the systems in question.

In the United States, you might not believe, some transit systems get
less of their operating cost from some trip fares than it costs to
produce and sell and take the tickets for those trips. That seems insane
to me but it suggests that free public transport is a rational way to
deal with a lot of problems.

Whatever the cost of transport and the extent to which it should exist
for the public benefit, funding should currently come from, in my view,
taxes on fossil fuels used for transportation. I certainly don't agree
with driving around empty buses and charging people fares that they
think make taking the bus not worth it (because they have a car) when
the fare might only cover the cost of selling the ticket or perhaps ten
percent of the total cost of the service. If you want people off the
roads in their cars, give them a free substitute. That's the market at
work.

(I grant you this isn't Shawn's idea of the &quot;market&quot;, it's the more
general, more moderate, meaning of bending the market to our whim and
not living a life to the whim of whatever the natural market would
choose.)

There could be many reasons to do that including just that there are so
many people in an area that two stations helps, or that it's hard to
cross the street so you might as well let people off on both sides. The
reason question might be why charge anything to go from the one station
to the other.

The stations are on two different lines.  But looking at the London
Underground map, the Charing Cross station on the Bakerloo line is
just one stop from the Embankment station.  So I don't understand

Good question.  Here's a tube map (a schematic):

http://www.afn.org/~alplatt/tube.html

Charing Cross and Embankment are in square D5, and the reason they're
both on the Bakerloo line (the brown one) is that Charing Cross is
part of the surface rail station (hence the red logo next to its
name), and Embankment also connects the larger-than-Bakerloo
underground Circle, District and Northern lines.

So, you get a train into central London, disembarking at Charing
Cross, and you want to get to, say, Victoria, you go down to the tube,
get whisked to Embankment, change trains and go to Victoria on either
the Circle or District line.

Of course, that still raises the question: why didn't they build just
one station for the lot?  Well, for this I'm going to have to rely on
vague memory and speculation, but here goes:

Here's the actual topography of that immediate area (a street map):
http://tinyurl.com/33ea62

Charing Cross station is old, and a well-established place.  In fact,
that whole district is old and well-established - you're really
talking expensive real estate here, busy central London.

I *think* that the Circle and District lines in that area run under
Embankment itself - that's the road that runs along the north bank of
the Thames - and they were built in the days of 'cut-and-cover', when
the underground lines were laid by digging huge trenches.  No way
could they match the underground to the surface lines without a huge
and expensively disruptive (not to say ruinous) plowing-up of the
Strand area.

The Bakerloo line, I believe, was a later addition, and used the
&quot;mole&quot; type of construction, with tunnels cut horizontally.  I've a
vague suspicion that the Circle line was built completely underground
too, possibly much later, in which case it was just connection to the
District line that was the cause of that short station distance.

Oh, and BTW, ISTR that Embankment station has the longest escalator in
Europe or the World or Britain or something, since it's a station on
two levels, one relatively shallow and the other much deeper.  I
suspect the deeper level is for the Northern line, which really
descends a lot around there to fit under the Thames.

I could have researched all this properly online, but I couldn't be
arsed, and anyway, sometimes it's fun to dredge up stuff just from
meatware.  I'll look into this further another day if it's of
interest.

The cost is probably extrapolated from some kind of flat fare system,
or at least a banded pricing structure.  It's been years since I last
travelled on the Tube, so I don't know how it's done these days.

The ultimate question is why someone would want to just go from the
one to the other and then leave - that would be silly.  If you went
from Charing Cross to Embankment, your only purpose could be to change
trains onto a different line and continue your journey (bear in mind
that it's an integrated system, so switching to a different line
doesn't mean paying again).

Specifically, the passage in the Guardian reads:

#  And what about Leicester Square to Covent Garden on the Piccadilly Line,
#  a 250m journey that is commonly assumed to be the single most expensive
#  on the planet, thanks to London Underground's punitive £4 single cash
#  fare?  Here, too, it turns out, the carpers and moaners of Britain have
#  missed the mark.
#
#  Although not by very far.  The accolade actually goes to the journey
#  from Charing Cross to Embankment on the Northern line, which works out
#  at around £64.50 per mile.

According to the London Underground's own FAQ page at

http://www.tfl.gov.uk/corporate/modesoftransport/londonunderground/16...

the two closest stations are indeed Leicester Square and Covent Garden
on the Piccadilly Line, as &quot;commonly assumed&quot;, at 260 m apart.  If you
really want to calculate a fare per mile based on the punitive £4 cash
fare, that's £24.76.

(The £4 fare was instituted because They want people to switch to the
Oyster smart card system, with which they would pay just £1.50 for the
trip.)

Clive's Underground Line Guides give the distance from Charing Cross to
Embankment on the Northern Line as the same 260 m, based on positions
of each station rounded to the nearest 10 m.  £64.50 per mile would
correspond to a distance of only 100 m.  Even if they cheated by excluding
the station length from the distance, it wouldn't be that short.

Don Manno:

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Which raises the question: Why did they build two stations so close
&gt;&gt; together?
">

The answer is basically that they wanted their terminal station to be
at the entrance to Charing Cross main line station, where it would also
serve the busy district of Trafalgar Square and the Strand.  It's a
prime location.

But that put it about 1,000 feet (300 m) north of the river, and in
that area, what is now the District Line follows its north bank.  So
when they realized they also wanted a convenient interchange with the
District, there was nothing to be done but extend the line to a new
station that close to the existing one.

Incidentally, Embankment station was originally built with a single
platform on a terminal loop, like Charles de Gaulle-Étoile station on
Line 6 in Paris or the open-air Fern Rock station on Philadelphia's
Broad Street Line, except that the platform was nearer the stem of the
loop, which extended under the river.  When the line was later extended
further south, the loop tunnel was plugged with concrete.  During WW2
it was flooded when a bomb fell in the river and breached it, but the
concrete held, so the system wasn't flooded.  (The running tunnels
had floodgates that were closed every time there was a raid.)

Also incidentally, the two stations, so close together, have undergone
multiple changes of name.  Many people can remember when the station
now called Embankment was Charing Cross.  When a 1965 Doctor Who movie
had scenes set in Embankment station on the Bakerloo and Northern Lines,
there was no such station -- but there is now!

It occurs to me that an additional factor in the location of the two
stations was that at the time they didn't have escalators good enough for
the kind of heavy use that they get in subway stations.  If the line was
being designed today, and was to follow the same route, it might well
have been given one station with platforms halfway between the Strand
and the Embankment, with escalators rising from each end.  If the station
was 75 feet deep and had platforms 350 feet long (which is about right),
that puts the escalator heads 600 feet apart, so a walk of only about
200 feet would be needed to reach either of the two main streets.

The line was authorized in 1893, fixing its station locations unless they
decided to apply for an amendment, although due to financing problems
it didn't open until 1907.  (The Embankment extension opened in 1914.)
The first installation of an escalator in what we now call an Underground
station was in 1911, and in subsequent decades many existing stations
had their elevators replaced by escalators.

&gt; I *think* that the Circle and District lines in that area run under
&gt; Embankment itself - that's the road that runs along the north bank of
&gt; the Thames - and they were built in the days of 'cut-and-cover', when
&gt; the underground lines were laid by digging huge trenches.
">

True.  In fact, in that area the building of the Embankment, the new
main sewer to relieve the Great Stink, and what is now the District Line
were all planned as a single project, although financing problems meant
that the District was dug a few years after the rest was finished.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; The Bakerloo line, I believe, was a later addition, and used the
&gt; &quot;mole&quot; type of construction, with tunnels cut horizontally.
">

This is what &quot;tube&quot; originally meant, and still does among cognoscenti,
to whom the District is not a &quot;tube&quot; line.

What we were talking about was the Northern Line, which is also tube
in thie strict sense.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I've a vague suspicion that the Circle line was built completely
&gt; underground too, possibly much later...
">

No, the Circle Line is just a service which in thie area uses the
District Line tracks.  It didn't get a designation as a separate line
until 1949, but it's always been that way.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Oh, and BTW, ISTR that Embankment station has the longest escalator in
&gt; Europe or the World or Britain or something, since it's a station on
&gt; two levels, one relatively shallow and the other much deeper.

Nope.  The longest escalators on the Underground are the ones put in at
Angel station when it was converted from elevators in 1992.  Before that,
the longest were at Leicester Square.

I've read your other posts, but I don't have time to reply in full yet
(but I will later - interesting stuff).  In the meantime, I wonder if
the Guardian's distance is calculated in terms of:

a. The lines between the platforms (the distance the trains travel)
b. The walking distance between the street levels of the stations
c. An &quot;as the crow flies&quot; variation of (b)
d. Other
e. Yet another

When you're talking about c. 250m, things like that can be very
significant, especially vertical movement and bendy tracks and
pedestrian crossings and stuff like that.

For sure;  well out of line with what it should be.

We just visited friends in south Manchester, a round trip of just
over 400 miles.  A perfect case for the train -- we have a direct

The cost comparison with a car for one person travelling was probably

1) So now they sleep in the subway stations.
2) You better believe that fares are one *intended* way to keep the
homeless off the buses. In fact, they actually charge enough to
discourage the riff raff from getting on board. Who else rides the damn
bus? It's a catch 22.
3) Who else rides the bus? Well, you find do-gooder Liberals riding the
bus, when they aren't riding their bikes blocking traffic because &quot;they
have a right to the road too!&quot;
4) Public transport can't be cost efficient unless it is heavily used.
The best way to do that is to make the fare free and find some other way
to deal with the people that are undesirables, the homeless et al. Since
dealing with the homeless et al is something that should be done anyway,
why not do it instead of playing games making public transport more
expensive, less efficient and more absurd than it otherwise would be?

The same is true in the U.S.  The Northeast Corridor (between
Washington, DC and Boston) is the one line that is well served by
rail.  But I can do a round trip from Maryland to New York on a
privately operated bus for less than half what the rail ticket would
cost.  Many areas have decent commuter rail systems.  In practice when
I go into New York City I drive to New Jersey and take a commuter
train into the city.  Even by myself this costs a fraction of what
taking Amtrak would.  I haven't tried the privately operated bus, but
I may give it a go my next trip.

That's true.

Curvature isn't an issue; the line is not dead straight, but it
doesn't curve enough to significantly affect the distances.

The platforms on this line are 350 feet long.  At Charing Cross
station they are centered just north of the north side of the
Strand, putting their south end near the front of the main line
station.  At Embankment the south end of the platforms is just
north of the south side of the Embankment.  So at track level
you have these distances:

CX                  Emb.
########-------------########
&lt; 350' &gt;&lt;    515'   &gt;&lt; 350' &gt;

That gives a real station-to-station distance of 865 feet (the
possible error in this number is about 10 feet), corresponding
to the 260 m that I cited earlier.

However, if they're going by street entrances, it's always possible
that Charing Cross station had one that is some distance south of
the platforms, and that Embankment station has one that is some
distance north.  This I don't know, but if they do, I could well
imagine them being 100 m (330 feet) apart.  And if so, instead of
walking those 330 feet, using the Underground would mean walking
a total of 535 feet in the opposite direction, to ride 865 feet in
the direction you want to go.  Not something worth worrying about
the cost of.

Yes - I remember when Ongar was still part of the Underground network,
and the tube map looked like this:

http://homepage.ntlworld.com/clive.billson/1974.html

(anyone following this: look to the extreme top right)

... indicating a change of trains at Epping.  I've a vague
recollection of making that change at Epping to get to Ongar,
something about a separate platform around the corner from the main
terminus.  It's all a long time ago, though, around 1974.

There's also a break at Hainault shown, but I never went there, so I
don't know what that was about.  Modern maps don't show it.

The reason I'm so interested in that stretch of the Underground is
that at the age of about 14 I spent an excellent fortnight camping
with my Dad at Chigwell, and every day (except Sundays) we'd take the
Tube^WUnderground into London proper to see something or other.

I fell in love with the Underground, already being a train enthusiast.
In fact, most of the time I spent visiting standard railway stations
and watching the various engines and rolling stock do their stuff.  I
went in the cab of a Deltic loco in King's X, went to Paddington to
see the lovely old Western locos, visited the busiest stretch of
railway in the country at Cannon St, and received a dirty phone call
in a callbox in between Pancras and King's X.  That's another story.

Dad did his own thing while I was watching trains, but on other days
he took me to see the better sights - the Greenwich museum and Cutty
Sark being a highlight.  It was probably the first time I really got
to know my father in a sort man-to-man way, and that camping holiday
(the first of several we made together to various parts of the
country) remains a wonderful and important memory.

And the Underground helped a lot.  We bought Red Rover tickets (cheap
passes that allowed you to go anywhere on the tube or bus for no extra
cost) and that gave us freedom to explore.

The significant thing about it was that at the age of 14 I was allowed
to roam at will through London, alone.  That was a Good Thing.

Indeed it was.  From the age of 12 I was finding my own way from Victoria
Station where I had arrived at the end of term from my prep school to

It occurs to me that this needs to be clarified.  When some
people say &quot;mole&quot; in connection with tunneling, they refer to a
tunnel-boring machine.  TBMs were not used in London Underground
construction until the 1990s.  But I think John was just using the
word as another way of saying that the tunnels were dug horizontally,
otherwise called being &quot;bored&quot; (or &quot;tunneled&quot;, but that can be
confusing).

">

True, and sometime around 1990 the Underground management adopted it
themselves -- putting the title &quot;Tube Map&quot; on the system diagram,
for example.  If one wants to clearly express the original meaning
of &quot;tube line&quot;, one now has to say &quot;deep-level tube line&quot;, and I'll
do that for the rest of this message.

But above and below ground is not the point.  Most of the lines have
above-ground sections; a common pattern is to have a long tunnel
section through Central London with surface sections at each end.
(In general these were built later, or taken over from main-line
railways, such as with the Ongar branch, which I will discuss below.)
The issue is what sort of tunnel the underground sections mostly use.
If they're tube tunnels, it's a (deep-level) tube line.  If they're
cut-and-cover, it's a subsurface line.

Incidentally, earlier this month I learned in uk.transport.london
that on at least one line -- the Piccadilly -- drivers use the word
&quot;pipe&quot; to refer to the long tunnel section through Central London,
or a complete journey through it from the above-ground section at
one end of the line to that at the other.  If they make six such
one-way journeys on one shift, they call that a &quot;six-pipe turn&quot;.

">

The word &quot;tube&quot; was originally promulgated by the companies operating
the first deep-level tube lines, which opened starting in 1890.
They wanted to emphasize the point that they offered something
new, compared to the subsurface routes -- trains that not only ran
conveniently below the streets, but were *electric instead of steam*.

The subsurface routes in Central London were electrified in 1905,
but the word &quot;tube&quot; had taken hold in the public mind.  However,
it stopped being used for promotional purposes and people eventually
came to lose track of the distinction.

Nick Spalding:

True.  But more important, the tube tunnels are also *smaller*,
giving the trains their distinctive low profile with the roof
curving down so far that the tops of the doors slant inwards, and the
floors down relatively close to the track.  Tunneling was expensive
enough the early companies tried to minimize it however they could.
The first deep-level tube line (now part of the Northern) used
tunnels as small as 10'2&quot;; eventually a uniform diameter of 11'8¼&quot;
was settled on, and the smaller bits enlarged.

The diameter required for a circular tunnel for British main-line
trains, in comparison, would be about 17', and the subsurface trains
are pretty much main-line size.

The size difference does not relate to the tunneling technology but
rather to the original purpose of the lines.  The subsurface lines
were intended to have suburban trains running through onto them,
and were once connected to the main-line system at points like
King's Cross and Paddington; the deep-level tube lines were viewed
as self-contained, and therefore did not need to be compatible.

That's correct.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; What I can't find out is whether there is an alternative rail route
&gt; from Ongar into Liverpool Street.

No.  The line to Ongar was was built originally for steam trains
running to Liverpool Street Station.  (Likewise the Hainault loop,
which connected two lines running from Liverpool Street; the other
one was the line to Southend Victoria, which it branched off at
Ilford.)  But by the 1930s, Liverpool Street station was overloaded.
Meanwhile it was realized that the Central Line, which then extended
only from Ealing Broadway to Liverpool Street tube station, could
handle more passengers.  So the plan was developed to extend the
Central at both ends, and in the east, to do this by taking over
the Ongar and Hainault services at a point east of Liverpool Street.

So from Liverpool Street the Central was extended to Leyton,
mostly in tube tunnel and more or less parallel to the existing
line to Ongar, which it joined onto at Leyton.  A new south side was
also built for the Hainault loop, roughly parallel to the existing
line to Ilford.  The work was well advanced when WW2 broke out and
the tunnels-in-progress were temporarily repurposed as shelters
(the section on the south side of the loop became a factory for
aircraft parts), then resumed after the war.  In the late 1940s the
new tunnels were opened and the existing surface lines electrified,
and services to Liverpool Street ceased to run; and in due course
the track connections at

Except for the outer bit of the line between Epping and Ongar.
The London Underground was dubious about the cost of electrifying
it, and they continued operating it with a steam shuttle until 1957.
Then they did electrify it, but as cheaply as possible -- with only
enough capacity for a half-length train.  It was thus condemned
to shuttle operation forever.  And since Epping station was never
intended as a double terminus, it had platforms on each side of the
double tracks, and through passengers had to cross by the footbridge
from one to the other.  This cannot have helped build traffic on
the line!

As noted elsewhere in the thread, Hainault was also operated as a
double terminus for many years.  In this case there was no technical
reason necessitating this; apparently they just assumed that not
many people would want to ride between points on the north and east
sides of the loop; and eventually it was changed.

I'm fairly sure I was about 12 when I first got the rail travel bug
(aka trainspotting in more interesting places than Hull).  It was only
day trips, of course - Doncaster, Sheffield, York, Selby, places like
that.  I'd make sandwiches and a flask, and I'd load up my bag with
those and books of lists and notebooks and pens, and head off, usually
with a friend or two.

My daughter's now 12, and she wouldn't have a clue about how to do
this sort of thing.  Nor would my son, who's approaching 16.  Nor
would it have any appeal for them.  Same for their friends and peers.
It's easy to say that it's because they have TVs and DVDs and

Something's changed, that's for sure, but I don't know what it is.

Not much to say, really.  I was walking from Euston (not St Pancras)
to King's Cross/Pancras and passed a row of phone boxes.  One of the
phones was ringing, which puzzled me, so I picked it up out of
curiosity.

A male voice at the other end said: &quot;Hello, little boy, this is Uncle.
Take your trousers down.&quot;  I could hear laughter in the background. So
I put the phone down and carried on walking.

Directly opposite the row of phone boxes was a large office block with

Thanks for the clarification - I wasn't sure myself if I had the
correct term.

&gt;&gt; What I can't find out is whether there is an alternative rail route
&gt;&gt; from Ongar into Liverpool Street.

&gt;No.  The line to Ongar was was built originally for steam trains
&gt;running to Liverpool Street Station.  (Likewise the Hainault loop,
&gt;which connected two lines running from Liverpool Street; the other
&gt;one was the line to Southend Victoria, which it branched off at
&gt;Ilford.)  But by the 1930s, Liverpool Street station was overloaded.
&gt;Meanwhile it was realized that the Central Line, which then extended
&gt;only from Ealing Broadway to Liverpool Street tube station, could
&gt;handle more passengers.  So the plan was developed to extend the
&gt;Central at both ends, and in the east, to do this by taking over
&gt;the Ongar and Hainault services at a point east of Liverpool Street.

Again, thanks for clearing that up.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This is what &quot;tube&quot; originally meant, and still does among
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; cognoscenti, to whom the District is not a &quot;tube&quot; line.

&gt; John Hopkin:
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I'd not heard that distinction; in common parlance it seems that
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the whole network - above and below ground - is called &quot;the Tube&quot;.

&gt; True, and sometime around 1990 the Underground management adopted it
&gt; themselves -- putting the title &quot;Tube Map&quot; on the system diagram,
&gt; for example.  If one wants to clearly express the original meaning
&gt; of &quot;tube line&quot;, one now has to say &quot;deep-level tube line&quot;, and I'll
&gt; do that for the rest of this message.

&gt; But above and below ground is not the point.  Most of the lines have
&gt; above-ground sections; a common pattern is to have a long tunnel
&gt; section through Central London with surface sections at each end.
&gt; (In general these were built later, or taken over from main-line
&gt; railways, such as with the Ongar branch, which I will discuss below.)
&gt; The issue is what sort of tunnel the underground sections mostly use.
&gt; If they're tube tunnels, it's a (deep-level) tube line.  If they're
&gt; cut-and-cover, it's a subsurface line.

&gt; Incidentally, earlier this month I learned in uk.transport.london
&gt; that on at least one line -- the Piccadilly -- drivers use the word
&gt; &quot;pipe&quot; to refer to the long tunnel section through Central London,
&gt; or a complete journey through it from the above-ground section at
&gt; one end of the line to that at the other.  If they make six such
&gt; one-way journeys on one shift, they call that a &quot;six-pipe turn&quot;.

Is is hard to learn the route?

Then if you haven't already, you should track down a 1972 Brit horror
movie with Donald Pleasance, called Death Line, released as Raw Meat in
North America. Dumb movie, and extremely enjoyable.

Plot summary, from imdb:

At the turn of the century, a group of diggers were lost during a
cave-in of part of the London Underground tube-train network. They
managed to live for a lifetime trapped in a crevice, but now there is
only one family left. The half-human father heads to the Underground
station to pick off lone passengers for food, while a London police
detective investigates the mysterious disappearances.

Yeah, I'd say - how many parents allow their 12-year olds to wander
around on trains unsupervised any more?
