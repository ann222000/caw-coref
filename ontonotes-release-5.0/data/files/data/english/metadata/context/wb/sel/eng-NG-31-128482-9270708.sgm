Civil Rights Icon Calls Obama Too Young

8 December 2007

ATLANTA (AP) - Civil rights icon Andrew Young says Democratic presidential
candidate Barack Obama is too young and lacks the support network to ascend
to the White House.

In a media interview posted online, Young also quipped that Democratic
presidential candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton has her husband behind her,
and that &quot;Bill is every bit as black as Barack.&quot;

&quot;He's probably gone with more black women than Barack,&quot; Young said of former
President Clinton, drawing laughter from a live television audience. Young,
75, was quick to follow his comment on Bill Clinton with the disclaimer,
&quot;I'm clowning.&quot;

Young, a former United Nations ambassador and lieutenant of Martin Luther
King, Jr., made the comments at an appearance at &quot;Newsmakers Live,&quot; an urban
media forum that interviews prominent Atlanta personalities and political
figures.

Excerpts of the interview were posted on Newsmakers Journal, the Newsmakers'
Web site, though the date of the appearance was not included with the video
posting. Young was scheduled to appear on &quot;Newsmakers Live&quot; on Sept. 5,
according to a press release.

Repeated efforts by The Associated Press to reach Young were unsuccessful.

Young's comments were prompted by a member of the audience who inquired
about his opinion on Obama's candidacy.

&quot;I want Barack Obama to be president,&quot; Young said, pausing for effect, &quot;in
2016.&quot;

&quot;It's not a matter of being inexperienced.  It's a matter of being young,&quot;
Young said.  &quot;There's a certain level of maturity ... you've got to learn to
take a certain amount of (expletive).&quot;

Young went on to say that Obama needs a protective network that he currently
lacks - a quality that could hurt him if he were to be elected.  He said
Hillary Clinton already has that kind of network, including her husband to
back her up.

&quot;There are more black people that Bill and Hillary lean on,&quot; Young said.
&quot;You cannot be president alone. ... To put a brother in there by himself is
to set him up for crucifixion. His time will come and the world will be
ready for a visionary leadership.&quot;
