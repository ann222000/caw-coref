While the dumb Airbus workers were all outdoors having a gay and wonderful
time protesting, Airbus was quietly shipping their jobs off to Russia.
Airbus sold out, just like Prodi sold out to Taliban terrorists and Zapatero
sold out to ETA terrorists. No doubt part of the conditions to get the
recent 20 A350 plane deal, Airbus will be shipping production of the next
millennium A350XWB off to Russia. Airbus may be dumb but they apparently
suckered the even dumber Russians. Russia thinks it's getting something but
all it's getting is a financial and political sinkhole.

The politics of Airbus will become more and more muddled and confused, if
that's possible, just like an A380 wiring bundle. Meanwhile, shareholders
can't seem to dump EADS shares fast enough.

I'm sure Alenia is glad they threw their lot in with Boeing though. They are
guaranteed jobs for decades just building the 787. The first Italian-built
fuselages should be arriving shortly. Let's hope the Italians didn't screw
things up. It is very difficult to get Italians to do any work even under
ideal conditions.

It seems almost certain that Boeing will need to double 787 production
because of the demand.

Meanwhile, Rostyk is buying more Bombardier shares just as the Russians and
Chinese will be biting into Embraer's and Bombardier's 100-seater market.
The only good news is that the Chinese and Russians will likely have a hard
time selling outside of their respective countries.

Yeah but how did the Saudis convince the Brits to sweep the BAE corruption
scandal under the rug?

Keep snooping around and Eurofighter order is cancelled...that's how.
