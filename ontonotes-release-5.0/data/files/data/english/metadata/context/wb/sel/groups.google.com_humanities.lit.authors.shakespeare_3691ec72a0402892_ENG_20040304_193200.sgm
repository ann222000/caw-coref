- March 3, 1765 : William Stukeley dies
-----------------
-------------- 239
----------------------------------------------------------------
Exactly 239 years after Marlowe's 29 year old demise.

The most tragic &amp; mysterious prodigy in all mathematics:

EVARIste GALOIS(at age 20!) wrote the mathematical &quot;Holy Grail&quot;
of number/group theory the night before his fatal May 30, 1832 duel.

His INNOCENCE lead him to the Grail that had eluded
so many of Mathematic's greatest geniuses.

&lt;&lt;PERCIVAL GOL(d)I(ng), 1st cousin of de VERE, wrote a history
of the family in which he stated that &quot;Edward de VERE ... lieth

--------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;&lt;PERCIVAL G(a)LOI(s), raised by his widowed mother
deep in the forest, has never seen a knight, or a sword, or even
a horse. He is ill-clad, unlettered, and entirely lacking in the
chivalric graces expected of a knight, yet his INNOCENCE leads him
to the Grail that has eluded so many of Arthur's greatest knights.&gt;&gt;

William Stukeley (November 7, 1687 - March 3, 1765)

&lt;&lt;'...to take all the beautys of Abury we must widen
our imagination &amp; think with the antients &amp;
behold the most stately strife between art &amp; nature.'

'...the strolling for relaxed minds upon these downs [in Wiltshire] is
the most agreeable exercise and amusement in the world especially when
you are every minute struck with some piece of wonder in antiquity.
The NEAT TURN of the huge barrows wraps you up into a contemplation of
the flux of life &amp; passage from one state to another and you meditate
with yourself of the fate and fortune of the famous personages
who thus took care of their ashes that have rested so many ages.'&gt;&gt;
----------------------------------------------------------------------
_William Stukeley_ from 1911 Encyclopedia Britannica

&lt;&lt;English antiquary, was born at Holbeach, Lincolnshire,
the son of a lawyer.

After taking his M.B. degree at Cambridge, he went to London
&amp; studied medicine at St Thomas's Hospital. In 1710 he started
in practice in Lincolnshire, removing in 1717 to London.

In the same year he became a fellow of the Royal Society,
and, in 1718, joined in the establishment of the Society
of Antiquaries, acting for nine years as its secretary.

His principal work, an elaborate account of Stonehenge,
appeared in 1740, and he wrote copiously on other supposed
Druid remains, becoming familiarly known as the &quot;Arch-Druid.&quot;

In 1729 he took holy orders, and, after holding two livings
in Lincolnshire, was appointed rector of a parish in BLOOMSbury,
London. He died in London on the 3rd of March 1765.

In 1742 he visited the cave at Royston &amp; a year later he published
his Palaeographia Britannica or discourses on Antiquities
in Britain no.I, Origines Roystonianae, or

an account of the Oratory of lady Roisia, Foundress of Royston
discovered in Royston in August 1742.

Following a response by the Reverend Charles Parkin
he penned the sequel: Palaeographia Britannica
or discourses on Antiquities in Britain no.II,

or defense of Lady de Vere, Foundress of Roiston,
against the Calumny of Mr. Parkin, rector of Oxburgh
wherein his pretended answer is fully refuted:
the former opinion further confirm'd and illustrated.

To which are occasionally added, amny curios matters in antiquity.&gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt;Robin Hood is first mentioned by the Scottish historian Fordun,
who died in 1386. According to Stow, he was an outlaw in the reign
of Richard I. (12th century). He entertained one hundred tall men, all
good archers, with the spoil he took, but 'he suffered no woman to
be oppressed, violated, or otherwise molested; poore men's goods
he spared, abundantlie relieving them with that which by theft
he got from abbeys and houses of rich carles.' He was an immense
favourite with the common people, who have dubbed him an earl.

William Stukeley says he was Robert Fitzooth, Earl of Huntingdon.
He was grandson of Ralph Fitzooth, Earl of Kyme, a Norman,
who came to England in the reign of William Rufus.

His maternal grandfather was Gilbert de Gaunt, Earl of Lincoln,

and his grandmother was Lady Roisia de Vere,
sister to the Earl of Oxford. His father was under the
guardianship of Robert, Earl of Oxford, who, by the king's
order, gave him in marriage the 3rd daughter of Lady Roisia.

Fuller, in his Worthies, considers him an historical character,
but Thierry says he simply represents a class-viz. the remnant
of the old Saxon race, which lived in perpetual defiance
of the Norman oppressors from the time of Hereward.&gt;&gt;
-----------------------------------------------------------
William Stukeley (1687-1765)

&lt;&lt;British antiquarian, best known for his competent
archaeological fieldwork at Avebury and Stonehenge.
Between 1710 and 1725 Stukeley made numerous summer
expeditions on horseback across the English countryside
accurately observing and describing, carefully sketching and
drawing, and always looking for antiquities. He published
several Itineraria, one of which was named significantly
&quot;Itinerarium Curiosum Centuria I: An Account of the
Antiquitys and Remarkable Curiositys in Nature or Art
observed in Travels through Great Brittan&quot;

&quot;The Herman street, now call'd high dyke road, goes along
the heath which preserves it from being worn away, and 'tis
a sight highly entertaining. The next town it comes to is
Ancaster, what was its roman name I know not, but it has
been a very strong city entrenche'd and walled about as may
be seen very plainly for the most part, and perceiv'd by
those that are the least verst in these searches&quot;

In 1729, Stukeley was ordained and one year later he was
installed as vicar in All Saints, Stamford. The preface
of his Stonehenge (1740) included the following passage:

&quot;My intent is (besides preserving the memory of these
extraordinary monuments, so much to the honour of our
country, now in great danger of ruin) to promote, as much
as I am able, the knowledge and practice of ancient and true
Religion; to revive in the minds of the learned the spirit
of Christianity ... to warm out hearts into that true sense
of Religion, which keeps the medium between ignorant
superstition and learned free-thinking, between enthusiasm
and the rational worship of God, which is no where upon
earth done, in my judgement, better than in
the Church of England&quot;

The field archeologist and antiquarian Rev. Dr. William
Stukeley was part of the circles that gathered regularly
at London coffeehouses and which included, among others,
the scientist Robert Hooke (1635-1703), the writers
Daniel Defoe (1660?-1731) and Jonathan Swift (1667-1745),
the buccaneers William Dampier (1651-1715) and Woodes
Rogers (1679?-1732) and the cartographer, Herman Moll
(1654-1732). As a consequence of overseas expansion,
coffee, tea, and chocolate became fashionable beverages
throughout Europe in the seventeenth century. Over time
London coffeehouses became centers of intellectual
stimulation and provided gathering places where people
conducted business and exchanged news, opinion, and
gossip. Such establishments encouraged friendships and
garnered specialized clienteles, circles for which they
became famous. The promoted the idea that land and
honest hard work, would transform colonists into
the British archetype of the yeoman farmer.&gt;&gt;

Pickwick Papers by Charles Dickens

&lt;&lt;As they turned back, Mr. Pickwick's eye fell upon a small
broken stone, partially buried in the ground, in front of a
cottage door. He paused.
'This is very strange,' said Mr. Pickwick.
'What is strange?' inquired Mr. Tupman, staring eagerly at
every object near him, but the right one. 'God bless me, what's
the matter?'
This last was an ejaculation of irrepressible astonishment,
occasioned by seeing Mr. Pickwick, in his enthusiasm for
discovery, fall on his knees before the little stone, and commence
wiping the dust off it with his pocket-handkerchief.
'There is an inscription here,' said Mr. Pickwick.
'Is it possible?' said Mr. Tupman.
'I can discern,'continued Mr. Pickwick, rubbing away with all
his might, and gazing intently through his spectacles--'I can
discern a cross, and a 13, and then a T. This is important,'
continued Mr. Pickwick, starting up. 'This is some very old
inscription, existing perhaps long before the ancient alms-houses
in this place. It must not be lost.'
He tapped at the cottage door. A labouring man opened it.
'Do you know how this stone came here, my friend?' inquired
the benevolent Mr. Pickwick.
'No, I doan't, Sir,' replied the man civilly. 'It was here long
afore I was born, or any on us.'
Mr. Pickwick glanced triumphantly at his companion.
'You--you--are not particularly attached to it, I dare say,'
said Mr. Pickwick, trembling with anxiety. 'You wouldn't mind
selling it, now?'
'Ah! but who'd buy it?' inquired the man, with an expression
of face which he probably meant to be very cunning.
'I'll give you ten shillings for it, at once,' said Mr. Pickwick,
'if you would take it up for me.'
The astonishment of the village may be easily imagined, when
(the little stone having been raised with one wrench of a spade)
Mr. Pickwick, by dint of great personal exertion, bore it with his
own hands to the inn, and after having carefully washed it,
deposited it on the table.
The exultation and joy of the Pickwickians knew no bounds,
when their patience and assiduity, their washing and scraping,
were crowned with success. The stone was uneven and broken,
and the letters were straggling and irregular, but the following
fragment of an inscription was clearly to be deciphered:--

[cross] B I L S T
u m
P S H I
S. M.
ARK

Mr. Pickwick's eyes sparkled with delight, as he sat and
gloated over the treasure he had discovered. He had attained one
of the greatest objects of his ambition. In a county known to
abound in the remains of the early ages; in a village in which
there still existed some memorials of the olden time, he--he,
the chairman of the Pickwick Club--had discovered a strange
and curious inscription of unquestionable antiquity, which had
wholly escaped the observation of the many learned men who had
preceded him. He could hardly trust the evidence of his senses.&gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt; Mr. Blotton, with a mean desire to tarnish
the lustre of the immortal name of Pickwick, actually
undertook a journey to COBHAM in person, and on his return,
sarcastically observed in an oration at the club, that he had
seen the man from whom the stone was purchased; that the man
presumed the stone to be ancient, but solemnly denied the
antiquity of the inscription--inasmuch as he represented it to
have been rudely carved by himself in an idle mood, and to
display letters intended to bear neither more or less than
the simple construction of--'BILL STUMPS, HIS MARK'; and that
Mr. Stumps, being little in the habit of original composition,
and more accustomed to be guided by the sound of words
than by the strict rules of orthography,
had omitted the concluding 'L' of his Christian name.&gt;&gt;

----------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;&lt;The Pickwick Club (as might have been expected from so
enlightened an institution) received this statement with the
contempt it deserved, expelled the presumptuous and ill-conditioned
Blotton from the society, and voted Mr. Pickwick a pair of gold
spectacles, in token of their confidence and approbation: in
return for which, Mr. Pickwick caused a portrait of himself
to be painted, and hung up in the club room.&gt;&gt;
-----------------------------------------------------
William Stukeley -- 1 Antiquary and 'Douzeper'

&lt;&lt;WILLIAM STUKELEY was born at Holbeach, in Lincolnshire, in 1687.
He is widely known for his publications, the Itinerarium Curiosum
(Observations from a Journey) of 1724; then Stonehenge, a Temple
Restored to the British Druids, published in 1740; and Abury, a Temple
of the British Druids, published three years later in 1743. In 1753
William Stukeley, visited nearby Bardney and observed that the abbey
was completely disappeared and that 'the rubbish of the sacred
structure has covered up the pavement of the church which
they are now digging for the sake of the stones&quot;.

Stukeley was a good archaeologist and surveyor; his Itinerarium
Curiosum records his travels round Britain and produced plans of towns,
as well as of buildings. Beyond their intrinsic interest, they also show
how much has been lost in the last 200 years or so. For example, when
was the market cross in Horncastle removed? He also very usefully
studied both Stonehenge and Avebury, following John Aubrey's lead. It
was this latter theme which was to lead Stukeley into murky waters: he
constructed some rather wild and elaborate theories about the Druids
without any basis beyond his imagination. Yet he was successful:
Stukeley's ideas permeated so deeply, much of what is the common
understanding of the Druids is, in fact, Stukeley regurgitated -
- ie baseless. It was he who suggested without evidence
that Stonehenge was used by Celtic/Druid magicians.

He was also part-creator of yet another fad: this time it was the
'Gothic Revival' of the early 19th century which found its inspiration
in his studies of ruins. The view, from George Weir's book, of
Horncastle church with Roman wall, could only have been produced under
the influence of this fashion. {Jane Austen's Northanger Abbey was a
product of this fashion for ruins and ghostly goings-on.} Stukeley's
topographical views themselves served as a kind of visual primer for
what later became the early-19th century's love affair with Nature and
all that was mediæval. In a small way, he trailed the path in creating a
visual lexicon for the 19th century. It would be easy to exaggerate his
claims to posthumous glory. Nevertheless, it is clear that many of his
interests found themselves echoed and amplified in the century
or so following his death in London in 1765.

Exemplifying his waywardness of judgment is the manner in which
Stukeley was conned by one Charles Bertram. When Bertram produced
a document which he claimed was a history of Roman Britain, it was
Stukeley who identified it as authentic. He claimed the author was
Richard of Cirencester -- a genuine historical figure who was known to
have lived in Westminster in the 14th century. Part of the skill of the
deception lay in the document's being part of a large volume of texts by
genuine historians. Again, one must conclude that wish led him on. Yet
once more, Stukeley paved the way and his stamp of approval influenced
the study of Roman Britain well into the last (20th) century.

The late 18th century was a good time for literary forgers.
Thomas Chatterton produced some poems he claimed had been written
by Thomas Rowley in the 15th century -- more 'Gothic' atmospherics.

A few years earlier -- 1762 -- James Macpherson published some poems
he claimed were 3rd century. Fingal and Temora he claimed were about
Ossian, an Irish warrior king, translated from the original Gaelic.
It was all tosh, of course, but harmless tosh. Edward Gibbon,
in his great work on the Roman empire, makes passing reference
both to Fingal and to Ossian in the following terms:

'Fingal, whose fame, with that of his heroes and bards, has been
revived in our language by a recent publication... if we could, with
safety, indulge the pleasing supposition. that Fingal lived, and that
Ossian sung...' Gibbon was, clearly, not convinced of the authenticity
of the poems. The writer's subtle ear proved him right. Decline
and Fall of the Roman Empire, Ch VI. [first published 1776]

Finally, and, as if the above were not enough, Stukeley also
created a family pedigree for Robin Hood! It was from this
that the persistent idea of Robin Hood living in the time
of the crusades and the reign of Richard 1 emanates.

WILLIAM STUKELEY was one of the first antiquaries who not only
valued the ancient monuments but who also displayed anxiety about
their survival. By drawing attention to places like Avebury
[which he called 'Abury'] he was most likely responsible for
its continued existence. In his own words, his purpose was:

'...to perpetuate the vestiges of this celebrated wonder &amp;
of the barrows avenues cursus &amp;c for I forsee that it will
in few years be universally plowd over &amp; consequently defaced.'

In the 14-15 years after 1710 he travelled the country on horseback,
noting and drawing all the while -- material which in time became his
'Itinerarium Curiosum Centuria I: An Account of the Antiquitys and
Remarkable Curiositys in Nature or Art observed in Travels through Great
Brittan' (1724). During that time he lived in London from about 1717 and
was considered an authority on the Druids and various remains like
Avebury, Stonehenge, barrows and, megaliths. Obviously self taught, WS
virtually invented the study of ancient ruins in Britain. In the matters
of observation and description he was accurate and admirable. Only when
it came to interpretation do we have to step back and listen not quite
so credulously. He may have devised the science; but he invented the
subject matter, projecting his fantasy of ancient Britain
onto bare stone.

Not only had Stukeley helped to found the Society of Antiquaries of
London, he was also a member -- perhaps more tellingly -- of the Society
of Roman Knights. The purpose of the knights was to preserve Roman
remains in England but one suspects they probably also dressed up
as Romans, wore togas and spoke Latin to each other.

Stukeley was given a Druid name among his Antiquaries friends; and his
house in Grantham was laid out as a Druid grove. He saw Avebury as a
Druid temple while still involving half a dozen other disappeared
societies in his fantasies. Egyptians, Chaldeans, Phoenicians, Moses and
Plato, all featured in this eclectic vision of the past peopled by what
we would call 'noble savages'. Later -- having been ordained in 1740 --
he sought some kind of reconciliation between what he called the ancient
religion and Christianity as found it in the Church of England -- for
throughout his studies there was pride in the nation's past. The old
religions, he felt, would have prefigured his own Christianity.

After the Itinerarium, he published after he left London, two important
works, &quot;Stonehenge, a Temple Restored to the British Druids&quot;, published
in 1740, &quot;Abury, a Temple of the British Druids&quot;, published three years
later in 1743. It was in these works that he made his most serious
claims for his interpretations.

Apart from his pioneering work as archaeologist, Stukeley left his mark
upon the imagination by placing the Druids firmly at the heart of the
British past. That we now know this to be wholly anachronistic, does not
diminish his work. Stonehenge and Avebury [c2,500 BC] were built and
abandoned long before the Druids emerged in British history. And by the
time Tiberius was emperor [AD Ist century] there was not much left for
him to extirpate in Gaul and Britain -- which he did thoroughly and
ruthlessly, as was his way.&gt;&gt;
