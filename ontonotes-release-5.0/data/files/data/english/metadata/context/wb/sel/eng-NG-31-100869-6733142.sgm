Subject: Jackie Gleason, N-xon And The Aliens.               April 13, 2007.

Here is some information abou someone seeing some dead aliens from space.

........................................................................... .
........................................................................... .

Gleason was considered on of the foremost television comedians of the 20th
century producing the Jackie Gleason Show for almost 20 years, and playing
the character of Ralph Kramden on the top rated Honeymooners TV show in the
mid 50's. He appeared in 21 movies, and produced 20 music albums from 1953
to 1969.
Jackie Gleason and Pres-dent Ni-on had a number of things in common and
became good friends. Gleason was a strong supporter of the Republican party.
Gleason lived in Florida, and Ni-on had a compound on Biscayne Bay only
miles
away. In addition to being avid golfers, both had high regard for the F-I.
Nix-n had in April 1937 applied to become an agent with the FB-, and
Gleason worked for the -BI as an official "contact" for the Special Agent in
Change (SAC) in Miami where he lived for the last twenty years of his life.
One of the other things they had in common, according to Gleason, was a
large collection of UFO books. Both were fascinated by the subject.
Gleason had long been a fan of UFOs. He was a subscriber to the newsletter
of the group Just Cause (Citizens Against UFO Secr-cy). Gleason had a
collection of 1700 books on parapsychology, UFOs, and the unknown. These
were
donated to the University of Miami by his third wife when he passed away in
1987. Gleason had even built a house in Peekskill, N.Y. which he called "
The
Mother ship." Gleason had architects built everything in the round like a
flying saucer. Most of his furniture was round, and the garage, called the
"Scout Ship" was also round, like a flying saucer.
Biographer William A. He-ry 111 in his book " The Life and Legend of
Jackie Gleason" described his view of Jackie Gleason's interest in the
unknown:
"Jackie Gleason had a lifelong fascination with the supernatural.
Everything that Shirley MacLean was to explore in her exotic life and
best-selling book had already been explored by Gleason...He would spend
small fortunes on everything from financing psy-ic research to buying a
sealed box said to contain actual ectoplasm, the sp-rit of life itself. He
would contact everyone from back-alley charlatans to serious researchers
like J.B. Rhine of Duke University and, disdaining the eli-ism of the
scholarly apparatus, would treat them all much the same way".
Gleason was a frequent insomniac. He would stay up all the night reading
(or rereading) some of the hundreds of (UFO and paranormal phenomena)
volumes in his library."
Gleason did not see a UFO . In 1955 at the high of his popularity with
the American people he stated during a magazine interview.
"I have never seen a flying saucer anywhere personally but have read
published flying saucer literature. Most of this literature is ridiculous,
but amongst the trash there are some undeniable points that can not be
refuted even by the Uni-ed States Go-ernment.  So Jackie Gleason stated.
Gleason had probably figured out that a h-ll of a lot of stuff on UFO's
is rubbish - disinformation if you want to call it that. But by his own
admission stated that some of the (UFO) information cannot be refuted by the
gove-nment.
He seemed to have a great deal of difficulty understanding why the
Go-ernments of the world were "hiding the truth" on UFO's. Yet by his own
admission was "extremely disturbed" for at least 3 weeks after seeing
what Ni-on had shown him. This should show you that IF the truth ever did
come out it would be simply too much for most people to take in and
understand. UFO's or Aliens - or whatever you want to call them are a fact
of life - but hidden from view for a very good reason.
Gleason let the public know that he was interested in UFOs, but he was
very se-retive about how strong his belief was.
While living in New York he invited Sheila MacRae for a visit to his
saucer
shaped home in Peeksville. MacRae replaced Audrey Meadows as the
"Honeymooners" Alice Kramden when Jackie Gleason moved his TV shows to
Florida in the sixties.
There he showed her his massive collection of books on spiritualism, the
occult,
and UFOs. " I'm kind of a nut on the subject, " he told Sheila "Hey, maybe
'nut'
isn't the right word, eh? Think of the fun the columnists and the writers
for TV
Guide would have if they got a load of all this, hunh?"
There were a few people who Jackie trusted who he
would discuss the subject with. One of these people was Bob Considine.
Jackie
Gleason's publicist James Bacon, in his book "How Sweet it Is: The Jackie
Gleason Story," described how Gleason was "always arguing" about UFOs with
Bob
Considine, columnist for the New York Journal-American. These UFO debates
took
place in Gleason's favourite watering hole - Toots Shor's Restaurant and Bar
in
New York City.
Gleason would tell Considine how
small UFOs had been seen by both sides during World War 11, and that four
Presidents of the United States had told him about these UFOs. Considine
didn't
believe Gleason until one day General Emmett "Rosie" O'Donnell, over heard
the
two arguing. He came up and said to Considine, 'Jackie's right.'
http://www.phils.com.au/macarthur.htm
(see my link to General Douglas McArthur)
(picture above) General Emmett
"Rosie" O'Donnell. Distinguished U.S. pilot and commander. Awarded many
citations and regarded as one of the U.S.'s most outstanding commanders. Was
Commander in chief of the Pacific Air Forces. Led the bombing raids over
Tokyo -
of Industrial targets - in 1944 - ( after the
famous 1942 air raids by General Doolittle)
-
in the second world war.
According to Gleason's second wife, Beverly
McKittrick, Gleason apparently had done more than talk and golf with his
friend
Richard Nixon while in Florida.
McKittrick
stated that one night Gleason had returned home very shaken.
It was during the Nixon February 1973 visit to Florida.
She related that President Nixon had taken Jackie to a heavily secured area
at
Homestead Air Force Base where he had viewed the remains of small aliens in
a
top secret repository. McKittrick related this story in an unpublished
manuscript of Gleason called "The Great One.
Larry Bryant, the editor of Just Cause, the newsletter Gleason
had a subscription to, filed a Freedom of Information Act Request with
Homestead
Air Force Base. Bryant requested documentation on the top secret repository
and
Gleason's visit there to see the alien bodies. The Air Force Base replied
that "
no such records existed." Bryant also sent an advertisement to the Homestead
Air
Force Base Newspaper soliciting information anyone on the base could provide
about the alien bodies or Jackie Gleason's visit to see them. The public
affairs
officer at Homestead denounced the Bryant advertisement and "forbade its
publication."
At the same time Bryant wrote Gleason providing him with a
draft affidavit. He asked Gleason to execute the affidavit so it could be
used
as part of a growing accumulation of evidence Bryant was collecting in
preparation for taking the government to court to release all information on
alien crash retrievals. Gleason did not reply.
About the same time as Bryant was approaching Gleason to
provide an affidavit about his experience at Homestead, Gleason was
approached
by the film industry about the rumoured story. Bryant recounted the
story;
"Though I never did hear from Gleason," said Bryant, " I did
learn that he had been contacted by a third party in the film industry. At
this
confrontation, Gleason chose to neither confirm nor deny the story, saying
that
he would prefer not to discuss it at all . The way I see it Gleason easily
could
have set the record straight in reply to my proposal or in an explanation to
the
inquisitive film-industry representative. If the story was a fabrication or
misinterpretation on the part of his wife, he now had every opportunity to
say
so. That he chose not to merely deepens the mystery."
Shortly before his death in
1987, one story says Gleason did finally
confirm the story about seeing the bodies at Homestead. The person who
Jackie
Gleason told the story to was Larry Warren
who was a member of the Air Force Security Police at RAF Bentwaters.
Bentwaters was one of two bases in England where in late
December 1980, three days of bizarre UFO incidents took place. Many US -
RAAF
airmen stationed at the base were involved in sightings, radar trackings,
landings of unusual craft and unusual events never seen before by any of
them.
The Base U.S. Deputy Commander made a written statement to the British
Ministry
of Defence admitting landing of "unusual craft" and "unusual events" that
actually took place.
Larry Warren had been involved in
events on the second night of sightings. He saw an object land in a clearing
of
the forest, and along with a number of other airmen saw three beings come
out of
the craft. The Commander of the base , Gordon Williams made sign movements
to
the three small dome shaped "beings" who emerged from the craft. The
incident
became known as the Rendelesham Forest Case, and was considered by many to
be
"the most significant Military - UFO incident in the history of Great
Britain."
- Sometimes called the "U.K. Roswell incident."

Subject: Jackie Gleason, Ni-on And The Dead Alien From Space.       Part 2
of 2.
April 14, 2007.

Well it seems that there was more than one dead alien from space, as we
shall see in the following information.

........................................................................... .
....
........................................................................... .
....

Lord Hill-Nor-on ( a former
head
of the British Ministry of Def-nce) stated in the House Of Lords that a
"craft
of unknown origin did actually land at the mili-ary base and did indeed get
the
persons stationed there into a " (quote) "considerable state". Lord
Hill-Nort-n
demanded - and did manage to get the British Authorities to release some
information on the incident - much to the dismay of the U.S. that have
refused
to even discuss the incident - and have done everything to cover it up.
Larry W-rren wrote a now famous
book
about this "Left at East Gate" The Ren-elsham Forest Incident is an amazing
fact.
http://www.phils.com.au/rendelesham.htm
(see my link to the Re-delesham Forest Incident)
Larry War-en's encounter
with
Jackie Gleason was in May 1986, shortly before Gleason died in June 1987.
CNN and HBO had been running
stories
on the 1980 Rendele-ham Forest case.
"Through mutual friends who knew members of his family," recounted War-en,
I was told that Gleason would like to talk to me privately in his home in
Westchester County, and so the meeting was set for a Saturday when we would
both have time to relax."
Timothy Green B-ckley, a New York City author, produced an excellent
account
of the meeting between the two men:
After being formally introduced, the two men ventured into Gleason's
recreation room complete with pool table and full-size bar. "There were
hundreds of UFO books all over the place," Wa-ren explains, "but Jackie was
quick to tell me that this was only a tiny portion of his entire collection,
which was housed in his home in Florida." For the rest of the day, UFO
researcher and UFO witness exchanged information.
"Gleason seemed to be very well informed on the subject," Larry says, "as
he knew the smallest detail about most cases and showed me copies of the
book "Clear Intent" that had just been published, as well as a copy of "Sky
Crash", a British book about Bentwaters that was published, actually, before
all the details of this case were made public. I remember Gleason telling
me about his own sightings of several discs in Florida and how he thought
there were undersea UFOs bases out in the Bermuda Triangle."
But it wasn't till after War-en had downed a few beers and Gleason had
had a number of drinks -"his favourite, Rob Roys"- that conversation really
got down to brass tacks.
"At some point, Gleason turned to me and said, 'I want to tell you
something very amazing that will probably come out some day anyway. We've
got em !'
'Got what', I wanted to know?
'Aliens!' Gleason sputtered, catching his breath.
According to Warr-n, Jackie proceeded to tell him the intriguing set of
circumstances that led him to the stunning conclusion that
extraterrestrials have arrived on our cosmic shores.
"It was back when Nix-n was in office that something truly amazing
happened to me," Gleason explained. "We were close golfing buddies and had
been out on the golf course all day when somewhere around the 18th hole,
the subject of UFOs came up. Not many people know this," Gleason told
Wa-ren, "but the President shares my interest in this matter and has a
large collection of books in his home on UFOs just like I do. For some
reason, however, he never really took me into his confidence about what he
personally knew to be true ... one of the reasons being that he was usually
surrounded by so many aids and advisers."
Later that night, matters changed radically, when Richard Ni-on showed up
at Gleason's house around midnight. "He was all alone for a change. There
were no sec-et service agents with him or anyone else.
I said, 'Mr. Pr-sident, what are you doing here?' and he said he wanted
to take me someplace and show me something." Gleason got into the
Pr-sident's
private car and they sped off into the darkness - their destination being
Homestead Air Fo-ce Base.
"I remember we got to the gate and this young MP came up to the car to
look
to see inside and his jaw seemed to drop a foot when he saw who was behind
the wheel. He just sort of pointed and we headed off."
W-rren says that later Gleason found out that the se-ret service was
going absolutely crazy trying to find out where Nixon was.
"We drove to the very far end of the base in a segregated area," Gleason
went on, "finally stopping near a well-guarded building. The secu-ity
police saw us coming and just sort of moved back as we passed them and
entered the structure.
There were a number of labs
we
passed through first before we entered a section where Nix-n pointed out
what
he said was the wreckage from a flying saucer, enclosed in several large
cases."
Gleason noted his initial reaction was that this was all a joke brought on
by
their earlier conversation on the golf course. But it wasn't, as Gleason
soon
learned. "Next, we went into an inner chamber and there were six or eight of
what looked like glass-topped Coke freezers. Inside them were the mangled
remains of what I took to be children. Then - upon closer examination - I
saw
that some of the other figures looked quite old. Most of them were terribly
mangled as if they had been in an accident."
According to Larry Warren's testimony
(regarding
Gleason's lengthy conversation about UFOs and space visitors), "I forget
whether
he said they had three or four fingers on each hand, but they definitely
were
not human...of this he was most certain!" For three weeks following his trip
with Ni-on to Homestead Air Fo-ce Base, the world famous entertainer
couldn't
sleep and couldn't eat.
"Jackie told me
that
he was very traumatised by all of this".
He just couldn't understand why our go-ernment wouldn't tell the public
all
they knew about UFOs and space visitors.
http://www.phils.com.au/mj12.htm
(see my link for an answer to this question)
He said " He even drank more heavily than usual until he could regain some
of his composure and come back down to everyday reality."
Larry Wa-ren is convinced that Gleason wasn't lying to him. "You could
tell that he was very sincere - he took the whole affair very seriously, and
I could tell that he wanted to get the matter off his chest, and this was
why he was telling me all of this."
And as far as Larry Warr-n was concerned, the
Great
One's personal testimony only added extra credibility to his own first hand
experience with aliens while he was in the service.
"Jackie felt just like I do that the
gov-rnment
needs to 'come clean,' and tell us all it knows about space visitors. It
time
they stopped ly-ng to the public and release all the evidence they have."
NOTE -
It's quite possible that after it was discovered that N-xon had shown
Gleason
the evidence at Homestead it would have been quite possible that Gleason had
been warned to "shut up" about it. Or else!
The obvious question that has
been
asked about this incident is how Ni-on, the most protected man in the world,
was
able to get away from his sec-et service detail, get a car, and head off to
Homestead with Jackie Gleason. The story seems at first totally impossible.
(Understand this was nearly 35 years ago - a very different world to
today!)
The Director of the Se-ret Service under Pres-dent Cl-nton, Lewis
Mer-etti,
claimed that the idea of a Pr-sident escaping his s-cret service agents only
happens in the movies. In response to a question by reporter Joan Lo-don
about the possibility of the Presi-ent escaping his protection to go out and
se-retly do something Merle-ti claimed, " All Hollywood! - there's no
sneaking out. It has never happened."
Marty Ve-ker, a S-cret Service agent who
worked
with Mer-etti under Pr-sidents F-rd and C-rter, however, tells a different
story. In his book Confessions of an Ex-Sec-et Service Agent tells that not
only can the Pr-sident disappear, but it has happened. Ve-ker stated that in
the exact year of the Homestead incident with Gleason, 1973, Nix-n had
tried to cut his sec-et service protection. Ve-ker also stated that it was
not uncommon for Nixo- to try to elude his sec-et service detail.
The agents working on the Ni-on
Pres-dential detail had been warned about it.
V-nker even recounted one occasion when Ni-on was able to ditch his sec-et
service guards while at his California compound:
"-ixon always felt that he
was
overprotected. He felt that he couldn't pick his nose without some agent
taking
notes. In 1973, he tried to cut his detail by a third. 'I don't like it and
my
family doesn't like it.' Ni-on said."
"I'd be warned of the lengths
N-xon
would go to elude us. One time he snuck out of the San Clemente compound.
His
valet, Manolo San-hez, drove past the agents in a car with Nixo- stretched
out
in the back seat under a blanket. Nix-n just wanted to go to a restaurant.
But
some reporters saw him and phoned the (wh-te) house. They wanted to know
what
N-xon was up to. The se-ret service told them, "he's not at any restaurant,
he's
here at home" But then the agents found he was gone they chased him down."
N-xon was very familiar
with
Homestead Air For-e Base which was only minutes from his Biscayne Bay
compound.
Every time Ni-on flew south to his "Southern W-ite House" Air F-rce One
would
land at Homestead. In Nix-n's first term as Pre-ident he travelled to his
Key
Biscayne compound 55 times and spent 118 nights there.
Gleason, on the other hand,
lived
in nearby Miami, and owned his own golf course, the Inverrary Country Club
nearby in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.
