&quot;Of particular note, the individuals who seem most urgently in need of this
inoculation regimen are weak-willed members of Congress who returned a few
weeks ago from their summer recess. Rather than serving as steady bulwarks
against the ravages of this president's destructive agenda, too often they
have simply capitulated to the pressure--as recently witnessed in this past
August's vote to broadly expand the administration's warrantless
surveillance authority. When our elected representatives surrender to
intimidation in this way, the entire country is put at greater risk of
becoming similarly infected. So, just as we give priority to society's most
vulnerable when facing other public health crises, today's Congress needs to
move quickly to the front of the line for immunization against the latest
strain of White House fear-mongering.&quot;

COMMENT:  The Bush43 bushwhacker gang is simply adhering to Goebbels'
lessons on propaganda: say something often enough with vigor and authority
and many will believe it, regardless of its rational validity.

Congress Needs A Shot In The
Arm&lt; http://agonist.org/roy_eidelson/20071005/congress_needs_a_shot_in_the... &gt;

Author Note: The following essay was co-authored with *Coleen Rowley*,
retired FBI agent and former Minneapolis division counsel.

Among the most important public health advances of the past century has been
the development of potent vaccines against dangerous and life-threatening
illnesses. Polio, tuberculosis, and measles quickly come to mind. Through a
process of inoculation, a small dose of the pathogen is intentionally
administered to the patient which induces immunity against the full-blown
disease.

In a similar way, social scientists have demonstrated that attitude
inoculation can be used to prevent the transmission of hazardous beliefs and
behaviors from one person to another. For example, research reveals that
adolescents can more effectively resist pressure from cigarette-smoking
peers if they are given role-playing opportunities in which they rehearse
their responses to students pressuring them to smoke.

But today we are in urgent need of an inoculation campaign against an
entirely different threat to our nation's health--namely, the Bush
administration's exploitation of its &quot;global war on terror&quot; to eviscerate
the rule of law and our constitutional checks and balances; to prolong the
disastrous occupation of Iraq; and to lay the groundwork for military
strikes against Iran. Ever since the tragic events of 9/11 six years ago,
the White House has promoted this agenda by working non-stop to spread a
simple yet infectious idea: All actions taken by this president and his
representatives are necessary to protect the United States from future
catastrophic terrorist attacks.

In the immediate aftermath of the 9/11 horrors, most Americans succumbed to
this potent viral message. But fortunately, over time a growing majority has
gradually recovered and now doubts the legitimacy of the Bush
administration's core arguments. Of course, from the very beginning the
actual evidence--about links between 9/11 and Saddam Hussein, about WMD in
Iraq--did not support the White House's claims. Moreover, recent data
document that the annual rate of terrorist attacks around the world has
increased as much as sevenfold since the invasion of Iraq, while public
support for the U.S. beyond our borders, especially in Muslim countries, has
plummeted during this same period.

But the White House's relentless fear-mongering has never depended upon
careful logic and rational analysis to infect the citizenry. Instead it has
targeted the public's deepest worries--of mushroom clouds over our cities
and the wanton destruction of our children, our families, and our
communities. These 9/11-inspired nightmares are haunting in their imagery
and debilitating in their effects on individual and collective
reasoning--which is precisely the Bush administration's intent. Indeed,
psychological research has demonstrated that reminders of one's own
mortality--such as subliminal cues about 9/11 and the World Trade
Center--produce heightened support for leaders who adopt patriotic appeals
to national greatness and a religious fervor to &quot;rid the world of evil.&quot;

And so the president and his followers constantly probe for weaknesses in
our cognitive and emotional defenses, looking for wounds not yet healed
through which to infect us once again with the fear that enables the entire
White House enterprise. Consider a partial sampling from the past month
alone:

• In a month-long series of TV ads from the White House front group
&quot;Freedom's Watch,&quot; veterans and their family members warned viewers that
&quot;They attacked us, and they will again--they won't stop in Iraq&quot; and &quot;If we
surrender now, it's giving the message to terrorists that they can do what
they want and get away with it&quot; and &quot;We've already had one 9/11, we don't
need another.&quot;

• The American Enterprise Institute--the neo-conservative think tank behind
the so-called pre-emptive war and &quot;surge&quot; strategy in Iraq--chose the eve of
the 9/11 anniversary to roll out a new book with the chilling title *The
Iranian Time Bomb* (a rehashing of arguments for regime change by military
force in Iran).

• General Petreaus's much ballyhooed congressional testimony on progress in
Iraq was timed to precisely coincide with the anniversary of 9/11. While
some may decry the chosen date as shameful exploitation, the Bush
administration no doubt saw it as effective marketing.

• President Bush himself addressed the nation two days after the 9/11
anniversary and cautioned that &quot;If we were to be driven out of Iraq….We
would leave our children to face a far more dangerous world. And as we saw
on September the 11th, 2001, those dangers can reach our cities and kill our
people.&quot;

Viruses are unremitting in finding and attacking their victims'
vulnerabilities, and it is easy to see that the White House propaganda
machine operates in much the same way. The consequences of our failure to
adequately resist the Bush administration's past efforts are tragically
apparent. The key to fending off new rounds of fear-mongering lies in
thoroughly rehearsing the counterarguments--neither complex nor
obscure--that can protect us against these tactics. In other words,
forewarned should be forearmed.

Consider the standard challenge that the White House and its supporters
repeatedly pose to skeptics: &quot;Don't you care about the safety of your family
and your country?&quot; If we have prepared in advance, we are ready with
effective responses to this hollow appeal. For example:

• &quot;We are *not* made safer by granting unchecked power to an executive
branch with a demonstrated devotion to secrecy, the curtailment of civil
liberties, and the disregard of our Constitution.&quot;

• &quot;The reckless and misguided invasion and occupation of Iraq has not
enhanced our security at home. To the contrary, it has multiplied our
enemies, drained our precious resources, distracted us from addressing real
threats, and placed our soldiers unnecessarily in harm's way.&quot;

• &quot;We will *not* sleep easier at night if this White House compounds its
extraordinary foreign policy blunders by attacking Iran. Doing so risks
setting the entire Middle East ablaze, creating countless casualties, and
inspiring untold numbers of new potential terrorist recruits.&quot;

The preparation and rehearsal of concise rebuttals like these to anticipated
White House rhetorical assaults actually share much in common with the
injections used to immunize us against the flu and other potentially
dangerous infections. Of particular note, the individuals who seem most
urgently in need of this inoculation regimen are weak-willed members of
Congress who returned a few weeks ago from their summer recess. Rather than
serving as steady bulwarks against the ravages of this president's
destructive agenda, too often they have simply capitulated to the
pressure--as recently witnessed in this past August's vote to broadly expand
the administration's warrantless surveillance authority.

When our elected representatives surrender to intimidation in this way, the
entire country is put at greater risk of becoming similarly infected. So,
just as we give priority to society's most vulnerable when facing other
public health crises, today's Congress needs to move quickly to the front of
the line for immunization against the latest strain of White House
fear-mongering.

*Addendum*: For those who may be interested, the 10-minute online
video *&quot;Resisting
the Drums of War&quot;* is a good complement to this essay. It describes how the
Bush administration has promoted the misguided and destructive war in Iraq
by targeting our core concerns about vulnerability, injustice, distrust,
superiority, and helplessness. Looking ahead, the continuing occupation of
Iraq-or an attack on Iran-will likely be sold to us in much the same way.
The video examines the White House's warmongering appeals and offers
suggestions for how to counter them. It's available for viewing
