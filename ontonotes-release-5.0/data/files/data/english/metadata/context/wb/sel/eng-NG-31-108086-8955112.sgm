I see that Hannants now have this in stock.  Anyone seen one yet?  Is it a
new tool or is it a re-pop of the old Hasegawa or even Frog kits?

That's a shame. The moulds for that must be nearly 40 years old.  I have to
wonder at the pricing for the kit. It costs a tenner. If it was priced at a
fiver I might be willing to buy one simply to graft the belly tank and wing
leading edges on to the forthcomng MPM kit but I'm not willing to pay a
tenner for spare parts.

Wasn't it pretty much a scaled down version of the 1/32 kit? I
remember it had all the removable panels &amp; internal extras.

What a shame.  I definitely wn't be buying it. Not at that price.

So, we still don't have a modern kit of the Lightning F6. There is a
forthcoming F3 from MPM.

So here's a thought.  MPM also produce kits for Xtrakits (Hannants own
brand).  The MPM Meteor FR9 is also the Xtrakits Meteor F8.  The forthcoming
Sea Vixen will be boxed by MPM as the Mk1 and by Xtrakits as the Mk2.

Given that MPM will be producing a Lightning F3, what at the chances of
Xtrakits releasing an F6? Careful mould design could ensure that the wings
and belly tanks all fit on one sprue. This would allow seperate sprues for
the F3 and F6.

That sure looks like the old Hasegawa one I had, right down to the
above-wing fuel tanks, and Red Top missiles.
Way, way, back I had this very poor model of a Lightning that was molded
in silver and predated the Airfix one, at least in its MPC U.S. issue.
It also had Red Tops on it, but no wingtop tanks. That may have been a
Frog one, although I associate with some Japanese company, and the scale
being smaller than 1/72.

Okay, here we go:
http://www.fortunecity.com/meltingpot/portland/971/Reviews/60s/lightn...
The Hasegawa one is the same as the Frog one as they both were marketing
it simultaneously.
I think the other one I remembered was a Eldon Match Kit model of a
Lightning F.2.

If it was the Eldon one, and the others were as good, you were wise not
to buy them. They were very crude kits.
I had some others in the Match Kit series (a He-111, Ju-87, Ju-88,
Lancaster, B-17, Zero, Fokker D-7 and a few others I don't remember)
scale was determined by what would fit in the over-sized matchbook, so
all the models were about the same size.
The fact that they were sold at our local Holiday gas station didn't
exactly argue in their favor either.

The first time people first knew it was the delta, not swept-wing,
MiG-21 that was being mass produced, was due to it's use in the 1963
Arab-Israili war. It had been seen at Soviet airshows but everyone
though it was the swept-wing &quot;Faceplate&quot; that had been selected for mass
production. No one got a really good look at one till the 1967

It may well have been the Hasegawa one being co-produced by Frog; like I
said, it was a pretty crude kit of a MiG-21F early model like the Airfix
one. Neither it or the Airfix one was very good, but the Airfix was
probably the lesser of two evils, as it was a bit more detailed looking.
The interesting one was the IMC version of a MiG-21PF, which gave you
the option of showing the aircraft after a missile hit with the pilot
ejecting: http://modelingmadness.com/scotts/viet/russian/mig21dpreview.htm
The Revell of Germany version is apparently a new molding, and it has a
_lot_ more parts than the early Hasegawa one:

I don't remember that one but I do remember other IMC kits, especially the
bullet-ridden A4. They cost quite a lot more than a dollar by the time they
reached England. My walk to school took me past a shop that specialised in
American imports such as Monogram and Aurora so I spent a lot of time
looking in the shop window.

The IMC MiG-21 was the later version with the larger nose intake
(MiG-21PF), while the Hasegawa one had the smaller intake like the
Airfix one (MiG-21F). I assume the Frog one was also a F.
That RG kit was the first decent 1/72 scale model of the early version.

Thoroughly, obviously. ;)

I can't say as I never built a 1/48th P-38.  I did build Airfix's really
old -J and their P-38F.  I built Hasgawa's P-38J and had at one time
Revell's -J,L,M and the F-5E kits as well as the Matchbox -J kit.

I can honestly say that only Revell's original Willys coupe ever met
with intentional destruction whilst in progress.  There was a DML XF-22
which 'accidentally' took a bite of the concrete downstairs.  Some parts
were salvaged although I have no idea what they will be used for - sheet
plastic, perhaps.

&gt;&gt; i remember starting a second tube of filler and then it ran into super heavy
&gt;&gt; flak over by the window and took 4 88mm shells down the center of the
&gt; fuselage
&gt;&gt; which cause the ac to disintegrate. by sheer bad luck, a string of 128mm
&gt;&gt; shells&quot;stitched&quot; it in a spotlight convergence. i think the biggest surviving
&gt;&gt; piece was one rudder blade. the rest was razor blades and thevpilot was some
&gt;&gt; red blotches on the bigger pieces.
&gt;&gt; when it hit the ground, it hit the mine field protecting the factory setting
&gt;&gt; of a chain mine explosion. not even the vacum could find much.
&gt;&gt; i really hated that kit!

&gt;Thoroughly, obviously. ;)

&gt;I can't say as I never built a 1/48th P-38.  I did build Airfix's really
&gt;old -J and their P-38F.  I built Hasgawa's P-38J and had at one time
&gt;Revell's -J,L,M and the F-5E kits as well as the Matchbox -J kit.

&gt;I can honestly say that only Revell's original Willys coupe ever met
&gt;with intentional destruction whilst in progress.  There was a DML XF-22
&gt;which 'accidentally' took a bite of the concrete downstairs.  Some parts
&gt;were salvaged although I have no idea what they will be used for - sheet
&gt;plastic, perhaps.

i had several accidental suicides in my build pile. and it took a lot for me
to abandon a kit. far more than today because kits represented many hours of
work at the davis snack bar. i washed dishes and flipped burgers for vietnam
era draftees going through basic. we called them doggies and they were a pain
in the ass. but thier eating portion control frozen GARBAGE kept my
motorcycles running and kits a building.
i can't remeber the maker, not revell, mono, airfix or other biggie, but there
was a 72nd b17g that was a steaming pile. it was my duty to change the
fryolater lard once a week. should have been everyday because we cooked
chicken, fish, fries, everything in that very poor lard. the night of a
change, the 90% complete 17 lost all 4 engines and hit the 400 degree fat. the
fat almost bubbled over but didn't and the plane was GONE! not a scrap to be
found.
the smell was almost beyond description. think od retching maggots....

I had the Monogram one and didn't have any problem building it; the
Revell 1/32nd scale one was a royal pain in the arse to build though.
That was in the period when Revell was bringing out 1/32 scale kits as
fast as they could, and they all had problems of one sort or another.

I'll always remember the MPC 1/72 scale one because it was the first one
I used Testors liquid cement on, and I got sick to my stomach from the
fumes.

I was just finishing up my Monogram 1/72 scale B-36 when I found that
Testor's thinner will remove paint from the canopy, but Testor's brush
cleaner will eat the plastic.
The model ended up being melted down in a coffee can till it was a
circular block of plastic.
My big Heller model of the Victory ended up coming under  heavy French
fire in the form of rocks after I managed to superglue my hand down to
the hull while rigging it.
A botched Monogram LM was sent flying to the antipodes under a weather
balloon* (If you are going to secure gold foil covering to a spacecraft,
use gel-type superglue, as the regular type runs all over the place.)
The only model that ever completely frustrated me to the point of
getting tossed across the room despite its simplicity was the Roden
PKZ-2 helicopter: http://www.internetmodeler.com/2002/march/aviation/PKZ.htm
With super glue this might be pretty easy to do, but with styrene cement
it was impossible. :-(

&gt; &gt;&gt; no the Revell/Frog is differant to the Hase, compared them both next

&gt; &gt;&gt; differances

&gt; &gt; What I noticed was that the parts looked very similar but their
&gt; &gt; positions on the sprues was very different.  The parts were similar
&gt; &gt; enough to be easily assembled together.  Yeah, I 'kitmingled' two of
&gt; &gt; them.

&gt; &gt; Bill Banaszak, MFE Sr.

&gt; According to this article it's the exact same model in different boxes:

&gt; It may well have been the Hasegawa one being co-produced by Frog;
&gt; like I said, it was a pretty crude kit of a MiG-21F early model like
&gt; the Airfix one. Neither it or the Airfix one was very good, but the
&gt; Airfix was probably the lesser of two evils, as it was a bit more
&gt; detailed looking. The interesting one was the IMC version of a
&gt; MiG-21PF, which gave you the option of showing the aircraft after a
&gt; missile hit with the pilot
&gt; ejecting:
&gt; http://modelingmadness.com/scotts/viet/russian/mig21dpreview.htm The
&gt; Revell of Germany version is apparently a new molding, and it has a
&gt; _lot_ more parts than the early Hasegawa one:

The RoG MiG-21F *is* a new mould. It is a very fine kit indeed!
