Well, I felt so good after finally completing the 1701-D bridge I simply had
to jump into another project. The bridge of the 1701-E!

I only started this an hour ago but wanted to let people know it was on the
way. The modelling for this should take too long. Now that I've done one
bridge I can simply scale my future models to it. This way I can keep them
allscaled to eachother but also I know what works in regards to wall height,
chair dimensions and such.

I found a fairly plain yet ideal floorplan from
Strekschematics.utvinternet.com, I scaled it to fit my screen and set it as
a background on my 3D program of choice: Truespace. After that mapping out
the walls is fairly simple. Ignore the narrow doorways, it looks that way as
the walls are set high. This is because the bridge has tiers/steps around it
whereas the &quot;D&quot; bridge had the ramp so it should allcome together once I've
done the floor.

Please offer your input or comments, I found it helped me greatly in staying
focused on the &quot;D&quot; bridge.

I've did a bit more on this. Sadly I have to stop for today. :(

I have family coming to visit the weekend and I have chores to do. I'm not a
happy bunny. At least I can give myself a break until Monday then come back
at this with a vengence!

Two more pics for you guys, The floor is almost done now. The floor and the
walls are I'd say the hardest part, after that it's pretty straight forward.

Hope youlike what you see so far.

I appreciate your work. I can't find the 1701-D bridge on your site.
Is there a reason you don't include a link to your site in your posts?

Yeah, I don't use it anymore. I just lost interest in maintaining it I
guess, I've not even been there for ages. I know alot of the download
links went down soI ended up emailing my models to those who asked.

The bridge is ready though I'm going to wait for the testbuilds to be
completed before release. I hope to have it hosted at John Leslie's
site as he has always helped me with hosting in the past.

He currently hosts my AT-ST, X-Wing, Boba Fett helmet and I recently
sent him my Ambassador class and Phoenix so they should be available
there soon though  haven't heard from him since sending them so he
must be busy.

Well lastnight I did finish the floor layout and start to model in the
perimeter consoles lastnight. Sadly I forgot to save my progress
before shuting down my PC and going to bed! D'oh!

Nevermind eh?

Check out John's site, there are plenty of models there of real world
space craft as well as sci-fi. Also as it ties in with my project,
you'll find Ron Caudilo's TOS Bridge there too!

I've had a smallknock this morning with the D bridge. One of my test
builders felt that some of the faces were too small, this is down to
the scale so parts like the chairs (Picards armrests) in particular
may present a problem to some. I'll make the ammendments I can ASAP
but some things can't be changed due to the size.

I have three more testbuilder working on it so I'll see what they say
over the weekend.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Yeah, I don't use it anymore. I just lost interest in maintaining it I
&gt; &gt; &gt; guess, I've not even been there for ages. I know alot of the download
&gt; &gt; &gt; links went down soI ended up emailing my models to those who asked.

&gt; &gt; &gt; The bridge is ready though I'm going to wait for the testbuilds to be
&gt; &gt; &gt; completed before release. I hope to have it hosted at John Leslie's
&gt; &gt; &gt; site as he has always helped me with hosting in the past.

&gt; &gt; &gt; He currently hosts my AT-ST, X-Wing, Boba Fett helmet and I recently
&gt; &gt; &gt; sent him my Ambassador class and Phoenix so they should be available
&gt; &gt; &gt; there soon though  haven't heard from him since sending them so he
&gt; &gt; &gt; must be busy.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I found a fairly plain yet ideal floorplan from

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; way as
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; the walls are set high. This is because the bridge has tiers/steps

My in-laws decided to leave early this morning as my father-in law had
to go into work for something.

Which means that later today or tonight I'll have some updates for you
guys. I've been thinking about this one alot and I think I've decided
how to proceed for the wall consoles. These were presenting a bit of a
problem in my head when I started this one.

Also, as I'm becoming aware of some minor problems with the &quot;D&quot; model
I'm incorperating the fixes into the &quot;E&quot; model before unfolding so
hopefully the new &quot;E&quot; model should have none at all when it's done(he
says and hopes  ).

On another forum I was asked which version of the &quot;E&quot; bridge I were
doing. I had a feeling there'd be differences but when I check through
my reference I can only see very, very subtle changes. So small in
fact that unless I find any big differences then I'll only be doing
the one version. If anyone can shed any light on this issue, please
let me know.

That's it for now. See ya tonight with updates hopefully.

Got some progress tonight. Some but not enough! :(

I managed to get the side consoles modelled along with placeholder for
the status bars/columns that line the perimeter. I'll try harder
tomorrow, too many distractions tonight.

I've made a decision today. Although I can model the bridge, there is
a lacking of the LCARS for it when it's ready. Wanting an accurate
representation for this I'm going to wait until some is available, or
until I feel confident enough do to my own.

So as of now this one is on hold. All is not lost though, I'm still
doing a bridge just not this one for a while. Sorry guys.

I'm thinking of doing the Defiant, Ihave a friend who's helping me
with the LCARS for it now. I just need a floorplan and I'm away!
Should I fail to get the floorplan then I'll do the 1701-A from ST:VI
- TUC!!

Hope there's not too much disappointment.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Nevermind eh?

&gt; &gt; &gt; Check out John's site, there are plenty of models there of real world
&gt; &gt; &gt; space craft as well as sci-fi. Also as it ties in with my project,
&gt; &gt; &gt; you'll find Ron Caudilo's TOS Bridge there too!

&gt; &gt; &gt; I've had a smallknock this morning with the D bridge. One of my test
&gt; &gt; &gt; builders felt that some of the faces were too small, this is down to
&gt; &gt; &gt; the scale so parts like the chairs (Picards armrests) in particular
&gt; &gt; &gt; may present a problem to some. I'll make the ammendments I can ASAP
&gt; &gt; &gt; but some things can't be changed due to the size.

&gt; &gt; &gt; I have three more testbuilder working on it so I'll see what they say
&gt; &gt; &gt; over the weekend.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; to jump into another project. The bridge of the 1701-E!

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I only started this an hour ago but wanted to let people know it was

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; chair dimensions and such.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I found a fairly plain yet ideal floorplan from
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Strekschematics.utvinternet.com, I scaled it to fit my screen and set
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; it as

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; out
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; the walls is fairly simple. Ignore the narrow doorways, it looks that
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; way as
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; the walls are set high. This is because the bridge has tiers/steps
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; around it
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; whereas the &quot;D&quot; bridge had the ramp so it should allcome together

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I've
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; done the floor.

Scrap my last. Since I wrote that I now have two people willing and
able to assist me with the LCARS I'll be needing!! WooHoo!

So I did a bit more lastnight on the 3D model. A finished the floor,
and also redid the sode walls. Actually blended all the walls into one
after getting rid of the crappy consoles I put in the other night.
They just didn't look right and were set too low down.

More to follow.

Couldn't sleep this morning, the central heating was on for some
reason and it was like a furnace here!!

I've added the newer improved side consoles and the rear recess for
the MSD. Much happier with it now, I used the &quot;D&quot; model to get the
heights right.

Please comment??? It's getting a little lonely here. LOL

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; let me know.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; That's it for now. See ya tonight with updates hopefully.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Well lastnight I did finish the floor layout and start to model in the

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Nevermind eh?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Check out John's site, there are plenty of models there of real world
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; space craft as well as sci-fi. Also as it ties in with my project,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you'll find Ron Caudilo's TOS Bridge there too!

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I've had a smallknock this morning with the D bridge. One of my test
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; builders felt that some of the faces were too small, this is down to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the scale so parts like the chairs (Picards armrests) in particular
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; may present a problem to some. I'll make the ammendments I can ASAP
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but some things can't be changed due to the size.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I have three more testbuilder working on it so I'll see what they say
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; over the weekend.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yeah, I don't use it anymore. I just lost interest in maintaining it I
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; guess, I've not even been there for ages. I know alot of the download
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; links went down soI ended up emailing my models to those who asked.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The bridge is ready though I'm going to wait for the testbuilds to be
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; completed before release. I hope to have it hosted at John Leslie's
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; site as he has always helped me with hosting in the past.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; simply had
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; to jump into another project. The bridge of the 1701-E!

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I only started this an hour ago but wanted to let people know it was
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; way. The modelling for this should take too long. Now that I've done
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; one
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; bridge I can simply scale my future models to it. This way I can keep
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; them
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; allscaled to eachother but also I know what works in regards to wall
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; height,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; chair dimensions and such.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I found a fairly plain yet ideal floorplan from
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Strekschematics.utvinternet.com, I scaled it to fit my screen and set
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; it as
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; a background on my 3D program of choice: Truespace. After that
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mapping
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; out
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; the walls is fairly simple. Ignore the narrow doorways, it looks that
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; way as
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; the walls are set high. This is because the bridge has tiers/steps
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; around it
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; whereas the &quot;D&quot; bridge had the ramp so it should allcome together

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I've
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; done the floor.

Viewer is done!! I'm getting quite excited with this one now. Very
happy with it.

&gt; Couldn't sleep this morning, the central heating was on for some

&gt; I've added the newer improved side consoles and the rear recess for
&gt; the MSD. Much happier with it now, I used the &quot;D&quot; model to get the
&gt; heights right.

&gt; Please comment??? It's getting a little lonely here. LOL

&gt; &gt; Scrap my last. Since I wrote that I now have two people willing and

&gt; &gt; So I did a bit more lastnight on the 3D model. A finished the floor,
&gt; &gt; and also redid the sode walls. Actually blended all the walls into one
&gt; &gt; after getting rid of the crappy consoles I put in the other night.
&gt; &gt; They just didn't look right and were set too low down.

&gt; &gt; More to follow.

&gt; &gt; &gt; I've made a decision today. Although I can model the bridge, there is

&gt; &gt; &gt; representation for this I'm going to wait until some is available, or
&gt; &gt; &gt; until I feel confident enough do to my own.

&gt; &gt; &gt; So as of now this one is on hold. All is not lost though, I'm still
&gt; &gt; &gt; doing a bridge just not this one for a while. Sorry guys.

&gt; &gt; &gt; I'm thinking of doing the Defiant, Ihave a friend who's helping me
&gt; &gt; &gt; with the LCARS for it now. I just need a floorplan and I'm away!
&gt; &gt; &gt; Should I fail to get the floorplan then I'll do the 1701-A from ST:VI
&gt; &gt; &gt; - TUC!!

&gt; &gt; &gt; Hope there's not too much disappointment.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; how to proceed for the wall consoles. These were presenting a bit of a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; problem in my head when I started this one.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Also, as I'm becoming aware of some minor problems with the &quot;D&quot; model
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I'm incorperating the fixes into the &quot;E&quot; model before unfolding so
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hopefully the new &quot;E&quot; model should have none at all when it's done(he
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; says and hopes  ).

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; On another forum I was asked which version of the &quot;E&quot; bridge I were
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; doing. I had a feeling there'd be differences but when I check through
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; my reference I can only see very, very subtle changes. So small in

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the one version. If anyone can shed any light on this issue, please

The pictures look great and I look forward to seeing the finished product. I
think the LCARS data works effectively and gives it a lot of class.

Has anyone heard whether or not a Klingon bridge is being worked on?

&gt; Couldn't sleep this morning, the central heating was on for some
&gt; reason and it was like a furnace here!!

&gt; I've added the newer improved side consoles and the rear recess for
&gt; the MSD. Much happier with it now, I used the &quot;D&quot; model to get the
&gt; heights right.

&gt; Please comment??? It's getting a little lonely here. LOL

Although I can model the bridge, there is a lacking of the LCARS for

Sorry, being a Trekker/Trekie I automatically assume people know what
it is. Okudagrams is another term. Tee Hee!

Thanks for the kind words, it's getting there. I've just finished the
doors too, I have two recesses to add for the replicators(futuristic
food vending machines) and then on to consoles.

As for a Klingon bridge, I'm thinking of adding a Bird of Prey bridge
to my list???

Ok, another update. Got some consoles done, place holders for seats.
Finished the columns/ status bars. and carpeted the floor. Not too bad
for a few hours while the kids were out eh?

Really taking shape now.

Andrew-

Just a thought-

You could create your viewscreen with slots to allow &quot;changing out&quot;
different images by sliding cards in and out. Could make this terrific model
even more fun.

BTW: If you don't do it, I'll probably modify the one I build :)

BoP bridge? Go for it!

Cheers!

Chris

You know that is a good idea! What I was going to do was offer say 4
different screen parts and one blank so that the builder could pick
one and go with that, or do their own.

But then they are stuck with it, so that is a cool idea. I'll look
into that one definitely!

Thanks for posting.

Hey, another idea. Do 5 screen parts, the 5th bein the screen changin
screen. This way one could build any of 4 variants or the variant with
changing screen!

I ment, do the 4 static screens and the &quot;slot&quot; screen Chris suggested. One
can cut out screens from the 4 static ones to use them in &quot;slot&quot; screen. Or
just do the &quot;slot&quot; screenbn and one can permanently glue the chosen slot in
place if he/she chooses to..

Can't see anything sorry. Is it a flash site or something? I've been
having trouble with those lately.

At least I know what was meant now. :)

Yup: it's a Flash LCARS-style page and pretty nicely done.

Sorry if this is taking things even further OT, but there's a nice LCARS
screensaver at http://www.mewho.com/system47/ if you're interested. PC

I have that, it's great. Comes with sounds of a computer system
running too, very convincing.

Do feel free to comment on the model though eh???????

The 3D modelling is now done on this too. I'm not going to jump into
unfolding it until the &quot;D&quot; bridge has been released. So,in the
meantime I'm starting to model another bridge. But which one???

The model is amazing, Andrew. I did mean to say that too. :)
If you're looking for bridges to model, how about the Defiant bridge?
It's quite a bit smaller, but there are many unique details.
Another idea: Modify your existing D bridge to reflect changes on the
&quot;Generations&quot; Enterprise bridge (extra consoles, etc.)
Keep up the fine work!

Don't sweat it buddy. I know topics often wonder off topic, it's cool.

As for your suggestions I have them down already. LOL  I have a long
list of these I'd like to do. The list is:

1701-A (Undiscovered Country)
1701-B and NCC-2000 Excelsior class
1701-C
1701-D (AGT and Generations)
1701-D Battle Bridge
1701-E
USS Voyager
USS Defiant
DS9 Ops inc Sisko's office

I think that's it for bridge models, there are more like engineering,
ready room and observation lounge for the 1701-D. The list goes on and
on and on...

Figured if I get modelling them now I'll always have a steady flow of
models to offer for a while.

Andrew, why don't you model all the Galaxy class starship rooms? I mean, not
just the bridge but also the sickbay, engineering, etc...;-)

Just joking,

Bosko Buha, that's what I meant when I said the list goes on and on.
There are a lot of them I'd like to do. Sickbay isn't one of them but
1701-D Engineering is.

I have to admit I know not what you're talking about. LOL Sorry, I
know what the Yamato is, Anime scifi right? Someone built a 6 foot
papermodel of the ship??

Other than that you lost me.

See, Trek is fairly easy as there usually so much reference out there
and it's my favourite sci-fi show/franchise so I'm always interested
in what I'm doing.
