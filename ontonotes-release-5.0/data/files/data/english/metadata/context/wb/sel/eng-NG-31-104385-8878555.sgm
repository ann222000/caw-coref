Anyone else remember your Mama saying these things?  Seems like just
yesterday I could hear her voice . .

Be sure and refill the ice trays, we are going to have company after while.

Watch for the postman, I want to get this letter in the mail today.

Either come in or go out, but quit slamming that screen door!

Don't forget to wind the clock before you go to bed.

You have torn the knees out of that pair of pants so many times there is
nothing left to put a patch on.

Don't you go outside with your good school clothes on.

Put a dish towel over the cake so the flies won't get on it.

Quit jumping on the floor! I have a cake in the oven and you are going to
make it fall if you don't quit!

You can walk to the store; it won't hurt you to get some exercise. Maybe you
will learn to be more careful with your bicycle.

Don't sit to close to the TV; it is hard on your eyes.

No! I don't have five cents for you to go to the show. Do you think money
grows on trees?

Hush your mouth! I don't want to hear words like that. I will wash your
mouth out with soap again!

If you get a spanking in school and I find out about it, you will get
another one when you get home.
