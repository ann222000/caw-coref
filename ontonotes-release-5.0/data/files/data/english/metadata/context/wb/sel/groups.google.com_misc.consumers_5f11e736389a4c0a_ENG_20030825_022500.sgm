&quot;&quot;The author(s) of what has been called &quot;the fastest spreading virus
ever&quot; remain at large at this time.

Although the worldwide spread of the &quot;SoBig.F&quot; virus appears to be
slowing down, the virus has nonetheless disrupted computers and
internet traffic worldwide, and continues to this day to present a
problem for internet administrators and home computer users alike.

Industry analysts, willing only to speak under conditions of
anonymity, have stated a belief that the SoBig.F virus and its other
variants have caused incalcuable damage to e-commerce, and that
authorities have been overly lax in seeking to find the authors and
distributors of the virus.

Nevertheless, &quot;SoBig&quot; has drawn the attention of authorities
worldwide.

In America, the FBI has issued a subpoena to the owners of an Internet
service provider which is suspected to have provided internet access
to the original distributor, and possible author, of the latest SoBig
virus variant.

It is unknown at this time what exactly the much-rumored relationship
between the SoBig.F virus and the conjectured &quot;Nixon replacement
scenario&quot; is, precisely. The &quot;Nixon replacement scenario&quot;, a view
widely held by prominent conspiracy theorists, states that the Nixon
that visited China in 1972 is not the same Nixon that China sent back
to America.

The FBI continues to seek information about identities of the authors
of SoBig.F, and asks that anyone having any relevant knowledge call
their local FBI field office.&quot;&quot;

Night Movie, circa one or two decades ago, in which the

world leaders with mechanical replicas, not currently

relates to worm/virus propagation.

Somebody with too much poly sci 101 on their brain?

That's the first time I've heard that particular wacko theory. Who came up
with that, Art Bell?

"/> No, no, no. They're clearly saying that the replacement Nixon authored the
Sobig.F worm. After all, anyone who can fake a moon landing is certainly
smart enough to write a virus.
