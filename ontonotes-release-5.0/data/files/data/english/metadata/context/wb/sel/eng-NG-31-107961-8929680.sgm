Patching cracks in a polyethylene boat

Have any of you developed a successful method for patching a cracked
polyethylene boat (not crosslinked)?  I have a '97 Dagger Cascade that has
cracked on the cowl where the pull strap on the skirt is located.  I have
glued it (E6000) to a piece of plastic molded to fit.  That failed.  I
melted the crack shut with a soldering gun.  That failed.  I cut a strip of
plastic from around the combing and melted that in with a soldering gun.
That failed.  I melted the whole area to glossy with a torch.  That gave a
really nice finish and seemed to do it.  That failed.  It seems that new
cracks form in the vicinity of the repaired crack.  It is really hard to get
a C-1 of any kind let alone this size so I really want to save the boat.
Has anyone come up with a method that works?

That is why I went with composite. It may not be pretty, but, at least it
will be solid.

So are you recommending a composite patch or a new boat?

If you have had that much dificulty in patching your boat, a new boat may be
your best option

Everything you listed seemed to be what would work, but it didnt.

If I were desperate, I would lay glass over the old combing, wrapping it
underneath by about 2&quot;.  Charlie Walbridge's Boat Builder's Manual has
good instructions.  Make it about1/8&quot; thick.  Once it's hardened and
trimmed on the top, cut it vertically at the front or back and remove it
from the boat.  Then remove the old combing completely.  Trim the bottom
of the fiberglass &quot;ring&quot;.  Finally, drill and pop-rivet the fiberglass
combing to the plastic, sealing it with silicone.  Then glass over the
cut section.

Or you could buy a Millbrook Hornet, which is a composite version of a
shrunken Cascade.

The best repair method is to weld the plastic with a plastic welder. You
can get them for as little as $30 from Harbor Freight. It sounds like
the crack you're trying to repair is longer than the repairs you're
making, so it just breaks over and over. Your best bet would probably be
to find the ends of the crack and drill holes there to provide stress
relief (a technique commonly used with aluminum), then weld up the holes
and the crack.

Visit http://www.millbrookboats.com and look in the Decked Canoes
section.  The boat is fairly narrow but quick to get used to.  I paddled
the Grand in one.  Had a great time.  Max weight is probably ~180 lbs.

In the interest of full disclosure, I designed the boat for the Canyon
trip (All my other C1s are slalom designs) - and had Millbrook do the
layup from my mold...

Wow!  That is really tempting.  I'm about 20 pounds over the max.  I like my
Cascade because it has enough volume in the bow that I'm not afraid of
getting stuck vertically when I'm running creeks.  Out of the decked boats
on that site, which ones should I consider?

The Wide Ride should fit your bill quite nicely.  E-mail Kaz for details
- I don't know what hull the design was based on.  The guy in the photo
weighs about 250 lbs.

I went and looked at the Esquif site.  It's great to see so many open
whitewater boats.  And the Taureau does look tempting.  I'm hoping that my
repair will hold.  Your suggestion to make a fiberglass cockpit should save
the boat if all else fails.  I haven't bought a boat in quite a few years.
It would be nice to go a few more with some money in my pocket.  Thanks for
the suggestions.

I would wonder if the entire area could be reinforced by backing it up
with another layer of plastic. Perhaps a hunk cut out of a surplus
plastic barrel. Perhaps glue it in place with a layer of Lexel.
