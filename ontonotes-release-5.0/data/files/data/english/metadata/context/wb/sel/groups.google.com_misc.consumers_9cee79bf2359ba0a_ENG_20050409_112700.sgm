A Tax Increase That Bush Didn't Mention
By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

WASHINGTON - Cynics have long predicted that the Bush administration,
plagued by budget deficits, will eventually start raising taxes. But
now it is becoming clear how it would do so: the alternative minimum
tax.

Baffling in its complexity and often bizarre in its impact, the
alternative minimum tax is a giant undeclared tax increase that will
ensnare tens of millions of moderate-income families in the next
several years.

It was created in 1969 to prevent the very rich from using tax
deductions to avoid paying a fair share of taxes. But when the deadline
for filing income tax returns arrives on Friday, the alternative
minimum tax will require 2.9 million families to pay an average of
about $6,000 more than what they would owe under traditional
calculations

That is just the start. If current law remains unchanged, the
alternative minimum tax is expected to wring an extra $33.9 billion
from 18 million households in 2006. In 2010, it will rake in an
additional $100 billion, and by 2015 an extra $200 billion.

Make no mistake: no one says they want that to happen. But it is one
thing to rein in or eliminate the tax itself, and an entirely different
matter to give up the money that it would generate.

President Bush has promised to fix the alternative minimum tax as part
a fundamental overhaul of the tax code, and he has ordered a bipartisan
advisory panel to come up with recommendations by the end of July.

But in giving the panel its marching orders, White House officials made
it clear that they are counting on the extra money regardless of what
happens to the alternative tax. Under the president's instructions, the
panel's recommendations on addressing the alternative minimum tax are
supposed to be &quot;revenue neutral,&quot; neither raising nor lowering taxes,
and to assume that his income-tax cuts will be made permanent rather
than expire in 2010, as required under current law.

Making those ordinary income-tax cuts permanent would reduce the amount
of available revenue by about $1.8 trillion over 10 years. But White
House officials told the panel that any change to reduce or eliminate
the alternative minimum tax would have to be offset by higher taxes
someplace else.

&quot;My understanding is that any reform in the A.M.T. that loses money
would have to be made up with offsetting revenue,&quot; said Elizabeth
Garrett, a panel member and a professor of law at the University of
Southern California.

Jeffrey F. Kupfer, executive director of the tax panel and a former
Treasury official, confirmed that interpretation. &quot;Our mandate is to be
revenue-neutral, and we are interpreting that with respect to the
president's policy baseline, which does not include a permanent fix to
the A.M.T.,&quot; he said in an interview last week.

Tax experts have long complained that the alternative minimum tax is a
&quot;stealth tax increase,&quot; one that Congress never intended and that is
likely to catch millions of taxpayers by surprise. But a tax increase
through tax reform could be even stealthier. If the alternative tax is
reduced, the offsetting revenue increases are likely to be buried in so
many other changes that most people would never know what hit them.

Seen or unseen, the looming tax increases are almost as large as the
president's tax cuts. Leonard E. Burman, a senior fellow at the Urban
Institute, estimated that the government would have to raise ordinary
income tax rates substantially in every bracket to offset the money
lost in each bracket by the elimination of the alternative minimum tax.
People in today's 28 percent bracket, for example, would have to pay a
top rate of 35 percent. Those who now pay a top rate of 33 percent
would pay 41.4 percent.

&quot;The A.M.T. is a huge tax increase built into current law,&quot; Mr. Burman
said. &quot;What the current law assumes is that over time we move to a tax
that is much less progressive, that has atrocious marriage penalties
and penalizes people with children who live in high-tax states.&quot;

Taylor Griffin, a spokesman for the Treasury Department, said the
administration's goal was to prevent a hidden tax increase by replacing
the alternative tax with something that was easier to understand and
more predictable. &quot;What we are trying to do is prevent a stealth tax
that sneaks up on you,&quot; he said. &quot;If we don't do something, millions of
Americans will be facing unanticipated tax increases.&quot;

The alternative minimum tax is similar in some ways to a flat tax that
blocks people from using most of the big deductions that reduce their
taxable income under the normal rules. A married couple with a gross
income of $100,000, for example, must first calculate its tax bill the
traditional way, then again under the A.M.T. In the alternative
calculation, the couple gets to exclude $58,000 from taxation, but it
must also strip out all the personal exemptions and most itemized
deductions.

The prohibited deductions include those for state and local taxes,
medical expenses, employee business expenses and interest on
home-equity loans. The A.M.T. would then apply a flat tax of 26 percent
(28 percent for couples who earn more than $175,000). The couple must
pay whichever is higher, the tax calculated under the traditional
method or the one under the A.M.T.

The huge looming tax increase is caused by two things. The first is
that the exclusion level for the alternative minimum tax is not
adjusted for inflation, so the tax affects more people each year as
nominal incomes go up. The second, paradoxically, stems from Mr. Bush's
tax cuts of 2001 and 2003.

Those cuts reduced regular tax rates at all income levels but did not
change the alternative minimum tax. At the same time, some of the cuts
came in the form of expanded deductions - the child tax credit, child
care tax credits and bigger exemptions for married couples - that are
not allowed under the alternative formula.

The effect of making Mr. Bush's ordinary income tax cuts permanent
would be significant. Mr. Burman, at the Urban Institute, estimated
that the alternative minimum tax would generate about $69.2 billion in
extra tax revenue in 2015 if the president's income tax cuts expired on
schedule. But if the White House persuaded Congress to make the cuts
permanent, the alternative minimum tax would raise a staggering $200.8
billion in that one year.

If the A.M.T. itself is pared back, how would that tax increase show up
in practice? The possibilities are almost limitless, from higher tax
rates for everybody to the abolition of popular tax deductions.

Administration officials are almost certain to insist that any tax
reform result in lower tax rates and fewer deductions. Many Republicans
long for a flat tax or a national sales tax, but that would mean
abolishing or reducing sacred cows like the tax deduction for mortgage
interest.

A potential trade-off, but a politically explosive one, would be to
eliminate deductions for state and local taxes, which cost the Treasury
about $40 billion a year and are a big reason that many people become
subject to the alternative tax. But getting rid of those deductions
would cause howls of protest in Democratic-leaning states like New York
and California, which tend to have above-average tax burdens.

Thus far, the issues have been so tangled and vexing that both the
White House and Congress have simply opted to block increases in the
alternative minimum tax with one-year and two-year patches.

But that will become expensive. By about 2008, Mr. Burman estimates,
the alternative minimum tax will generate so much money that it would
be cheaper to abolish the regular income tax.

&gt; A Tax Increase That Bush Didn't Mention

"/> What the article doesn't mention (but others on this topic have) is that the
AMT's biggest impact in the present and near future will be primarily felt
in those regions which already vote predominantly Democrat. (Which is a rich
irony given that the AMT is a tax created by Democrats for the specific
purpose of promulgating their soak-the-rich class warfare.) Now if you're in
Kalifornia or New York or some other high state income tax, the AMT
considers you a rich tax avoider because you're sending so much money to
your state franchise tax board instead of the Federal IRS. (And they're not
entirely wrong. Kalifornians should pay for their own bloated government,
state income tax deductions are in the end a way for them to pass part of
those costs on the other 49 states.) And of course, there was a big impact
in the heart of lefty-land Silicon Valley back in 2001 when thousands of
dot-com dummies exercised vapor-profit ISO's, held onto the fool's gold
stock and then found themselves on April 15 with a two million dollar tax
bill on stock that they'd sold for about $200 (and they're still being
hounded into bankrupcy by the IRS four years later with no end in sight.)

The fact is, there's little urgency for the Bush administration to expend
political capital on this right now. This was a problem created by the
Democrats and Democratic Congressmen will being hearing the lion's share of
the howls first.

I wonder what would happen if the income tax got replaced with a
millionaire tax. Everyone would pay 1% of their net worth as tax each
year, but the first million dollars would be exempt.

What would the total revenue be from such a tax? Would it be more
than or less than the income tax? It would probably be politically
popular. Most voters would no longer owe any income tax, and would be
exempt from the millionaire tax by not being millionaires. But of
course Bush wouldn't like it, because a lot of his cronies would pay

How so? The AMT hits those is high local tax locations like New York. It throws
away deductions for state and local taxes, as well as home mortgage interest.
Coincidentally, those happen to be places that are strongly Democratic.

Hoisted by their own petard...

The other probelm is that to get a pure VAT to replace an income tax, the
percentage is going to be very high. Even though you might be economically
better off with that high percentage, its going to scare a lot of people.

&gt;tax.

"/> I don't think that the Bush administration is exactly the inventor of
the AMT. In fact, it was, as I recall, the most liberal president in
US history, Richard Nixon, and the Dimocrat Congress, who came up with
it, in order to &quot;soak the rich&quot;.

As with most soak the rich schemes, it is worthless for the intended
purpose, and now threatens the middle class.

The current head of the IRS favors its abolition, but Republicans are
afraid that the Dims will accuse them of favoring the rich if they
come out against it. So, as even the NY Times knows, Dims must take
the lead here, or nothing will change.
