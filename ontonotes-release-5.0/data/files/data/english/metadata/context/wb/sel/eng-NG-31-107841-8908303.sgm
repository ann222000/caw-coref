&quot;The way you get meaning into your life is to devote yourself to loving
others, devote yourself to your community around you, and devote yourself to
creating something that gives you purpose and meaning.&quot;

Mitch Albom

I ran into a friend at the theatre Saturday night and he introduced me to
his wife who I had not met before. She has been a subscriber to the daily
for sometime and shared with me that she regularly forwards copies to her
daughter. If you forward to others as well I will be glad to add them to the
distribution and save you the trouble.

I shared with her that I sometimes wonder about the daily and why I have
been doing it for more than six years. I told her that it makes me think
everyday and that helps. Later I thought more about it and realized that I
am pleased that it seems to have meaning to many of our thousand or so
readers. That triggered me to go back and look at some of the comments made
by some of the people who read it on my 360 Blog. Here are samples:

You describe life in the way as I look at it, I cram as much as i can into
my days and rest at night, I am constantly wanting to feed my brain. I am
like a bright torch and shine it all over the place, there is so much to see
and do that you have to keep on with it all, I say if you don't use it you
loose it. Thanks for the interesting Blogs.

I recently experienced so many problems this last weekend with a vehicle I
purchased but through it all I knew that the problems I had were minor and
was glad I had funds to carry me through. I was lucky when comparing myself
to others and so I just refused to let it get me down. I just count my
blessings for what I have and move forward. A lovely story as usual about
Ashley. Sometimes you have to be reminded that what is happening to you is
minor when compared to others.

Ray, thank you very much for those words on defeat. My son, then a few weeks
later his girlfriend, experienced a disappointing &quot;defeat. One did not get
an important scholarship that he had worked hard for and the other didn't
get the job she interviewed well for and would have been a great opportunity
in her field. They are inconsolable. If you don't mind, I will send them
your words.

I enjoyed reading your Blog, Ray! Got me reflecting about my tendency to
indulge in self-pity...

Praise be to God for that. I need integrity and honesty in order to move on.

&quot;The true way to soften one's troubles is to solace those of others.&quot; So
right! You soften everyone's troubles with your great posts.

A Jewish kid informs his father that he's decided to join the army rather
than go into business.

His father inquires, &quot;What kind of job could you have in the army?&quot;

The young man replies, &quot;Well, I start out as a private, but I could get to
corporal or sergeant.&quot;

&quot;Corporal...sergeant....&quot; the father says, &quot;that's no business.&quot;

&quot;I could become a lieutenant or maybe captain,&quot; the young man responded.

&quot;Lieutenant...captain....that's no business!&quot; father said.

&quot;OK dad&quot;, he replied. &quot;How about getting promoted to major, or colonel, or
general?&quot;

&quot;Still no business,&quot; the father insisted. &quot;Where could you go after
general?&quot;

The son answered, &quot;I could become field marshal.&quot;

The old man says, &quot;Field marshal... that's no business. Marshall Fields, now
that's a business.&quot;

A father found his small son looking very unhappy.

&quot;What's wrong?&quot; he asked.

The boy said, &quot;I can't get along with your wife.&quot;

A priest was being honored at his retirement dinner after 25 years in the
parish. A leading local politician and member of the congregation was chosen
to make the presentation and give a little speech at the dinner. He was
delayed, so the priest decided to say his own few words while they waited.

&quot;I got my first impression of the parish from the first confession I heard
here. I thought I had been assigned to a terrible place. The very first
person who entered my confessional told me he had stolen a television set
and, when questioned by the police, was able to lie his way out of it. He
had stolen money from his parents, embezzled from his employer, had an
affair with his boss' wife and taken illegal drugs. I was appalled, but as
the days went on, I knew that my people were not all like that and I had,
indeed, come to a fine parish full of good and loving people.&quot;

Just as the priest finished his talk, the politician arrived full of
apologies for being late. He immediately began to make the presentation and
gave his talk.

&quot;I'll never forget the first day our parish priest arrived,&quot; said the
politician. &quot;In fact, I had the honor of being the first person to go to him
for confession.&quot;

I asked my psychiatrist if she thought I was crazy, she said &quot;no&quot;, so I let
her up.

A ten year old boy was walking home with a girl in his class when he said,
&quot;Pammy, you're the first girl I have ever loved.&quot;

Pammy responded, &quot;Great, that's all I need is another beginner.&quot;

A nurse noticed a man in golf attire pacing up and down outside the
operating room where another golfer who had a golf ball driven down his
throat, was being treated.

&quot;Is he a relative of yours?&quot; the nurse, stepping outside the room, asked the
pacing golfer.

&quot;No,&quot; replied the man, &quot;That's my ball!&quot;

If you were all alone in the universe with no one to talk to, no one with
which to share the beauty of the stars, to laugh with, to touch, what would
be your purpose in life? It is other life, it is love, which gives your life
meaning. This is harmony. We must discover the joy of each other, the joy of
challenge, the joy of growth.
