Public Lands
As Logging Fades, Rich Carve Up Open Land in West

By KIRK JOHNSON

WHITEFISH, Mont. -- William P. Foley II pointed to the mountain. Owns
it, mostly. A timber company began logging in view of his front yard a
few years back. He thought they were cutting too much, so he bought
the land.

Mr. Foley belongs to a new wave of investors and landowners across the
West who are snapping up open spaces as private playgrounds on the
borders of national parks and national forests.

In style and temperament, this new money differs greatly from the
Western land barons of old -- the timber magnates, copper kings and
cattlemen who created the extraction-based economy that dominated the
region for a century.

Mr. Foley, 62, standing by his private pond, his horses grazing in the
distance, proudly calls himself a conservationist who wants Montana to
stay as wild as possible. That does not mean no development and no
profit. Mr. Foley, the chairman of a major title insurance company,
Fidelity National Financial, based in Florida, also owns a chain of
Montana restaurants, a ski resort and a huge cattle ranch on which he
is building homes.

But arriving here already rich and in love with the landscape, he
said, also means his profit motive is different.

&quot;A lot of it is more for fun than for making money,&quot; said Mr. Foley,
who estimates he has invested about $125 million in Montana in the
past few years, mostly in real estate.

The rise of a new landed gentry in the West is partly another
expression of gilded age economics in America; the super-wealthy elite
wades ashore where it will.

With the timber industry in steep decline, recreation is pushing aside
logging as the biggest undertaking in the national forests and
grasslands, making nearby private tracts more desirable -- and
valuable, in a sort of ratchet effect -- to people who enjoy outdoor
activities and ample elbow room and who have the means to take title
to what they want.

Some old-line logging companies, including Plum Creek Timber, the
country's largest private landowner, are cashing in, putting tens of
thousands of wooded acres on the market from Montana to Oregon. Plum
Creek, which owns about 1.2 million acres here in Montana alone, is
getting up to $29,000 an acre for land that was worth perhaps $500 an
acre for timber cutting.

&quot;Everybody wants to buy a 640-acre section of forest that's next to
the U.S. Forest Service or one of the wilderness areas,&quot; said Plum
Creek's president and chief executive, Rick Holley.

As a result, population is surging in areas surrounding national
forests and national parks, with open spaces being carved up into
sprawling wooded plots, enough for a house and no nosy neighbors.

Here in Flathead County, on the western edge of Glacier National Park,
the number of real estate transactions, mostly for open land, rose by
30 percent from 2003 to 2006, according to state figures. The county's
population is up 44 percent since 1990.

The United States Forest Service projects that over the next 25 years,
an area the size of Maine - all of it bordering the national forests
and grasslands - will face development pressure and increased housing
density.

But the equally important force is the change in ownership. According
to a Forest Service study, not yet published, more than 1.1 million
new families became owners of an acre or more of private forest from
1993 to 2006 in the lower 48 states, a 12 percent increase. And almost
all the net growth, about seven million acres, was in the Rocky
Mountain region.

Institutions, pension funds and real estate investment trusts have
been particularly aggressive buyers. Over the last 10 years, at least
40 million acres of private forest land have changed hands nationwide,
said Bob Izlar, the director of the Center for Forest Business at the
University of Georgia. It is a turnover that Mr. Izlar said was
unmatched at least since the Great Depression.

Here in the West, questions of clout and class have been raised by the
new arrivals.

This year, the conservation group Trout Unlimited, which had been
considering ending its involvement in disputes between private
landowners and fishermen over public access to fishing streams,
backtracked after its members rose up in protest. Some members accused
the group of siding with the landowners by not fighting for
fishermen's access rights.

In parts of Colorado where communities have committed tax money to
preserve open space, conflicts have erupted on the borders of the
public lands over whether the programs -- which in many cases buy out
an owner's right to develop property, but not the property itself --
are simply enriching landowners who keep the land and the public off,
too.

&quot;When you're there, you're on four million acres,&quot; said Michael
Carricarte, who bought an 800-acre property in Glenwood Springs,
Colo., in 2005, and now has the place, bordered on three sides by
federal land, up for sale, asking $23.5 million.

&quot;To get to where our property touched public land would take three
hours by public road, but from our house it was 10 minutes by four-
wheeler or Jeep,&quot; he said.

Mr. Carricarte, 39, said he was now in the process of selling a
conservation easement to the Aspen Valley Land Trust that would lock
600 acres, all bordering public land, into permanent preservation.

Longtime residents tied to the old timber economy are finding it
difficult to keep up. In parts of New Mexico and Colorado, the timber
industry has all but collapsed; log harvests in the national forests
have fallen to about one-fourth of what they were 20 years ago in the
Rocky Mountain region, and less than a tenth what they were in the
Pacific Northwest.

Some privately owned timberlands have increased production, but in the
West, where more than two-thirds of all forest land is publicly owned
(compared with about one-sixth in the eastern United States) private
owners, even if they want to allow logging, cannot make up the
difference.

Ronald H. Buentemeier, a second-generation forester, said he struggled
every day to get enough wood to stoke the family-owned mill he runs in
Montana, the F. H. Stoltze Land and Lumber Company.

&quot;There's not enough private land out there,&quot; said Mr. Buentemeier, a
blunt-talking 66-year-old with a flat-top crew cut. &quot;We've been
pulling rabbits out of the hat to keep going.&quot;

In ways that would have been unthinkable only a few years ago,
environmentalists and representatives of the timber industry are
reaching across the table, drafting plans that would get loggers back
into the national forests in exchange for agreements that would set
aside certain areas for protection.

Both groups are feeling under siege: timber executives because of the
decline in logging, and environmentalists because of the explosion of
growth on the margins of the public lands.

One of the most ambitious proposals is here in Montana. It would allow
some logging in the Beaverhead and Deerlodge National Forests in the
state's southwest corner in exchange for the designation of new areas
within the forests as permanent wilderness.

Some timber companies say that gaining conservationists as allies may
be the only way to get back into the national forests, and so stay in
business. But both sides say that success will require a turn of the
historical momentum against logging in the West that began in the
early '90s.

A court decision in 1991 involving the northern spotted owl required
the Forest Service to manage for more than just timber production. The
national forests in the northern Rockies constricted logging,
fostering expansion in other forest areas like the South.

&quot;If there's anything the industry should have learned over the years,
it's that we can't do this by ourselves,&quot; said Gordy Sanders, the
resource manager at Pyramid Mountain Lumber, one of the mill operators
involved in the Beaverhead and Deerlodge negotiations.

Many environmentalists say they have come to realize that cutting down
trees, if done responsibly, is not the worst thing that can happen to
a forest, when the alternative is selling the land to people who want
to build houses.

Stoltze Land and Lumber, for example, which owns about 36,000 acres
near the border of Glacier National Park, has said that the failure of
the logging industry would leave the company no option but to sell
land into the booming development market.

That prospect chills the blood of people like Anne Dahl, the director
of the Swan Valley Ecosystem Center, a conservation and education
group.

&quot;I'm a former tree hugger who was opposed to everything, every timber
sale,&quot; Ms. Dahl said, &quot;but now I see that the worst thing you can do
is lose it all to development.&quot;

Other new partnerships are emerging. Last year, the Confederated
Salish and Kootenai Indian tribes, which have a reservation south of
Whitefish, joined with conservationists to buy a square mile of land
from Plum Creek that was deemed crucial to the endangered bull trout.

The tribes chipped in $4.8 million, half the purchase price, and the
Trust for Public Lands put together the other half. The two parties
recently completed a plan to manage the property jointly, said the
Salish and Kootenai tribal chairman, James Steele Jr.

Plum Creek, based in Seattle, changed its corporate structure in 1999
to become a real estate investment trust. Some Plum Creek property has
been bought by conservation groups, including about 68,000 acres in
the Blackfoot Valley northwest of Helena. Negotiations continue for
more conservation sales, with money surging into funds organized by
groups like the Nature Conservancy and the Trust for Public Lands.

Mr. Holley, the Plum Creek executive, said that his company was
committed to both the timber and real estate businesses, but that only
a small percentage of its land, perhaps 30,000 acres or so, had the
combination of attractions -- proximity to public lands but also to
other amenities, like shopping and restaurants -- to make sale for
development feasible.

The Forest Service, meanwhile, is struggling to find its own balance.
A spokesman for the agency said that the national forests across the
West were increasingly tilting toward recreation and away from
logging. But the growth in population on the forests' edge also means
more need than ever to thin the trees, through some logging, if only
for wildfire protection.

Tom Tidwell, the regional forester for 25 million acres of national
forest that includes Montana, northern Idaho, North Dakota and part of
South Dakota, said the Forest Service was eager to keep timber
companies in business to help with the thinning.

&quot;We're more in the need of the industry,&quot; Mr. Tidwell said. &quot;It's
essential that we have someone to do that work so that taxpayers don't
have to pay for it.&quot;

One broiling and unresolved issue is who gets to use the land as it
changes hands.

Most private timber tracts in the West, including those owned by Plum
Creek, have traditionally been open to recreational use, treated as
public entry ways into the vast national forests, grasslands and
wilderness areas that in Montana alone add up to nearly 46,000 square
miles, about the size of New York State. But in many places, the new
owners are throwing up no trespassing signs and fences, blocking what
generations of residents across the West have taken for granted --
open and beckoning access into the woods to fish, hunt and camp.

&quot;Part of our character is that we have so much big sky and open
country,&quot; said Gov. Brian Schweitzer of Montana, a Democrat who has
publicly sparred with Plum Creek about its land sales. &quot;We're going to
have to be creative. There's no textbook written on how to do this.&quot;
