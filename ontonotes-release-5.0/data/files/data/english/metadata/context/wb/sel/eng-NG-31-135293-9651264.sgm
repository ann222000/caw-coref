hi,

i would like to have a free text in version attribute of ticket. how
can i configure this. had no luck when searching for this inside
trac.ini (something like disabling option restrict_owner of [ticket]-
section)

using trac 0.11.

There might be a plug-in on trac-hacks, but otherwise you are restricted to
the list you set up in the web admin.

To be honest, you don't really want your users making up the version
numbers.  Much better to proscribe them, so that you know that there will be
useful and correct information in your tickets.

Hi

We've disabled the version-field in default trac (if you don't add any items
to the version list, the field will remain completely hidden from the user
interface) and instead we use a custom field version which is free text.

Cheers / Erik

yes, i know that a drop-box in most circumstances is a better way (to
focus on proper release planning).

but in our special case it is neccessary (temporary workaround). the
best thing would be a drop-list for the trivial cases and at the same
time a possibility to enter a free text.

what generally is missing for our needs is that a certain set of
versions is only visible dependent of the  component. that means, if i
choose 'component1' for a ticket i would only see 'v4,v5,v6', when
choosing 'component2' i would only see 'v1,v2,v3'.
a support for submodules of a component would be fantastic, too. these
days we map submodules through naming conventions like
Component1.moduleA, Component2.moduleA etc..

We also needed a text field entry for version numbers. I  created a custom
ticket field and hid the original admin managed version field (by
removing all admin-defined version numbers).

I updated our reports to include the user data for the custom ticket field
(kept in table: ticket_custom). BTW, I suggest you use your direct SQL
interface to the Trac DB to dump all the DB table definitions.

I'm  using trac 0.10.4 so I don't know if the new 0.11 report interface allows
the use of custom fields. The samples only use the trac defined fields.

custom fields are a good idea, i think i will use this before
switching one day to fixed version-types in a drop-list.
