Hardly new news, but:

http://www.gnn.gov.uk/Content/Detail.asp?ReleaseID=326295&amp;NewsAreaID;=2

&quot;The Department for Transport has today announced funding grants of more
than £132 million towards supporting rail freight. The awards will
improve freight infrastructure on four specific projects across the
country and reduce dependency on road transport, removing around 300,000
lorry journeys from our roads every year.&quot;

The four projects are Peterborough-Nuneaton, Southampton-Nuneaton,
Humber Ports and Liverpool-WMCL.

The local BBC South Today said there would be &quot;months or years of
closures&quot; for commuters while Southampton Tunnel was gauge enhanced.
Months I could understand, but years?

They (ST) originally said weeks IIRC. but I suspect they were looking at the
cock-up over the Portsmouth resignalling and saying 'weeks? yeah right!

Someone stated that new methods could bring the closure of Southampton
tunnel down to a week, but I have no idea how feasable that would be.  The
tunnel is only about 300 metres long and they need to lower the base perhaps
a foot or so. One day to get the tracks out, 5 days to dig it out and a day
to pit the track and signalling back would seem within the bounds of
possibilty.  I suspect something will need doing to the Northam road bridge
as well. that could be interesting, will they raise the road or lower the
track?  Either way will cause problems.  Be a good chance for SCC to widen
the road there as it is a notorious pinch point.

I note ABP have been strong-armed into contributing, following on from the
success in getting business to cough up for Crossrail perhaps?

Months or years of on and off closures on the route perhaps? - its not just
Southampton Tunnel, there are a four more towards Basingstoke. Then there
are all the over bridges, and loads of platform canopies, which I would have
thought could involve repeated short closures...

Nearer 500m Graeme (from the signs at the end!), however in the article
about the 'new method' in the Rail Freight column in Modern Railways
(October?), as you say they reckoned just over a week; but the article was
pretty sketchy about the detail...

As I mentioned in another post, there are another 4 tunnels towards
Basingstoke, perhaps ST are linking the whole job to Southampton Tunnel?

Logically all four tunnels should be done the same week but we know how good

I suspect that if specialist expertise or equipment is required then

time. The work is supposed to last until 2011 and they [BBC News] said
that things like the Southampton Tunnel will be the last things to be done.

Possibly because it is a bridge?  That one should be no problem as it is
where the M3 crosses and was, alledgedly, built to an enhanced loading gauge.

Missed that bit, I only saw the late news from South Today.  Paul Clifton
started talking about months of disruption which became weeks halfway through
the report.  No mention of timetables.

What would be the time penalty of going via Laverstock Junction and
Basingstoke? There are (I think) no tunnels, the route is far less
congested, and it would mean they would not have to manoeuvre through
all the choke points at Southampton Central and Eastleigh.

It adds about an hour I believe.  Cetainly a feasable alternative and has
been suggested on here in the past.  Don't know if there are any weight limit

Nope, definitely not the M3 bridge:) St Cross Tunnel is the next brick
built structure London side of the M3 bridge you're thinking of and is
where St Cross Road crosses the railway. It is pretty small and Hampshire
CC even call it St Cross Tunnel Bridge.

Lack of third rail that way (or via Chandler's Ford) would put 444s at a
slight disadvantage. I assume they could be dragged. There would be a
lot of reversing of Weymouth/Bournemouth trains at Southampton if that
was to be the case.

Well spotted - it'll possibly be one of those that is defined as a 'tunnel'
because it exceeds some arbitary distance (that's been mentioned before),
but it looks like it was a cut and cover, rather than a bored tunnel. But it
could just as easily require a lot of work, or nothing, as it there was some
major work there within the last few years, no idea what though.

If it was strenghtening that required rebuilding would it have automatically
been lifted then?

Don't a proportion of freight trains run that way already, and isn't it on
the gauge clearance 'to do list' anyway?

There is pathing to take into account as well, I dont believe there aren't
any freight loops available that way.  I wouldn't have thought Eastleigh
should be considered a 'choke point' for freight, as its the start of a four
track section where freights can be looped and a good number of trains are
recessed or marshalled in Eastleigh yard during the peaks.

I wonder if there is much gauge clearance required between Fratton and
Eastleigh? (just a thought!)

Reversals at Eastleigh and Romsey too - loads of hassle, and see below...

The only DMUs recently have been 4x153, but they have moved on to pastures
new via Bournemouth. Of course if you're suggesting 180s you're ahead of the
game!

I believe they could run a decent Waterloo - Basingstoke - Laverstock -
Southampton service using their existing 158/159 for pax insisting on a
through journey, with cross platform change at Southampton onto the normal
Bournemouth Weymouth trains. Electric services through Winchester could
terminate at Parkway, or even St Denys for foot/PT pax (no parking).

I don't think the single track Romsey - Eastleigh single line section is a
worthwhile idea for diversions, current practice when Southampton is closed
for weekend engineering work is for the FGW Cardiff - Portsmouth service to
go via Eastleigh &amp; Chandlers Ford, and that usually results in the local
stopper being cancelled due to pathing issues. IIRC BBC suggest 'some'
services will go this way, I guess it will be the FGW diesels.

If the recent Modern Rail article is correct it could be for only a 10 day
period, so a Christmas/New Year blockade, might be feasible.

I've no idea and the brickwork is pretty old and untouched. There was
quite a bit of work done at the road level recently but I don't think
the actual structure was touched. Next time I go through it I'll pay a
bit more attention and have a closer look:)

I suppose another option, given it's age and (relatively) small
size, would be to remove the whole structure and replace with a new
prefabricated bridge.

A quick run along the line on Google Earth would suggest there aren't any.

Good point, there's a 656 metre tunnel out of Fareham.  Incidentally what is

I think the idea was to route the container trains that way as a cheaper

I see what you mean, it's 56 metres, which is a long bridge or a short

The original route was through the tunnel. When the Meon Valley line opened
in 1903 a double track diversion was built round the tunnel, though the
layout allowed Eatleigh trains to use either route, while Meon Valley trains
had to use the single line tunnel. At some point sincev the closure of the
Meon Valley line the diversion has been closed (IIRC it had geological
problems) and all trains now use the tunnel.

That was the twin track tunnel avoiding line opened in 1904, that was closed
in the early 70s?  You can see the depression of the disused cutting either
side of Highlands Rd in Fareham, near Hill Park WM club, where there was an
overbridge. If it wasn't for the M27 embankment going over its formation
basically on the level, I think it's only extended gardens over the
trackbed.

It always puzzled me why the tunnel route wasn't closed (as it was
supposedly prone to subsidence)  and the avoiding line was left in use,
probably the M27 alignment was pencilled in by then. Incidentally there are
two parts to Fareham Tunnel, after an early collapse the middle was opened
out, the northern part is under the M27 embankment now.

The section past Knowle was a three track railway, I think the eastern track
through Knowle Halt was used solely for the Meon Valley route towards
Wickham - you can just about make out the embankment leading off just after
the Meon is crossed heading north after Knowle. There is another tunnel at
Tapnage, heading towards Botley, I imagine this is definitely ok for high
containers as it was originally double track, although now singled.

There is parking at St Denys but it's fairly minimal.  And not a good place
to try and run a bus service to/from.

&gt; I don't think the single track Romsey - Eastleigh single line section is a

&gt; services will go this way, I guess it will be the FGW diesels.

Presumably they are going to re-route the Porstmouth - Bristol services to
avoid Southampton.  I assume a bus connection wull be laid on from Eastleigh.

&gt; &quot;The Department for Transport has today announced funding grants of more

Edge Hill Chord announced this morning

Quote
DfT/NW/066/2007                                                 30 October 2007

£1.7M GOVERNMENT FUNDING FOR LIVERPOOL RAIL FREIGHT

New funding to improve the infrastructure between the Port of
Liverpool and the national rail network, and so allow an increase in
rail freight through the port, has been announced by Transport
Minister Rosie Winterton during a visit to Liverpool today.

The Olive Mount Chord scheme, which will receive £1.7 million
Government funding, will reinstate an important section of track
between the main Liverpool to Manchester rail line and the rail
freight route to Liverpool Docks. It will also enhance the loading
gauge for two routes between the West Coast Main Line and the Port of
Liverpool, enabling larger 'high cube' freight containers to travel by
rail, reducing the impact freight travel has locally on congestion and
the environment.

During her visit to the Port of Liverpool Rosie Winterton said:

&quot;This underlines the Government's commitment to improving the rail
freight network across the country, as well as supporting the growth
of the Port of Liverpool. Importantly, passenger services will also
benefit as these infrastructure improvements are expected to improve
reliability.

&quot;Our new strategic framework, published today, sets out how we can
deliver a better and more environmentally-friendly transport system in
the future. In his transport review, Sir Rod Eddington was clear that
major benefits can be achieved by relatively small-scale projects.
Even though this project involves laying only a short section of track
it will allow more freight to be carried by rail, bringing major
benefits for the reduction of road congestion and environmentally
damaging emissions.&quot;

Towards a Sustainable Transport System: Supporting Economic Growth in
a Low Carbon World outlines a new approach to transport planning over
the next twelve years, and beyond. It is the first stage of a
consultation process to deliver a transport system that meets the key
objectives of supporting the country's economic competitiveness and
helping address climate change. As part of this it argues that forcing
the pace of technological improvements and removing the obstacles to
behavioural change will be key to ensuring transport makes a
substantial contribution to the goal of a 60% CO2 reduction by 2050.

Notes to Editors

1.      The new chord would allow trains to run to and from the docks
without the need to reverse en-route - creating more freight capacity,
improving performance and resource utilisation for the freight
operators using the route and saving rail network capacity on the
route between Wavertree and Liverpool Lime Street station.

2.      The gauge enhancement would allow container trains running to and
from the docks to convey today's larger (9'6&quot; high) containers using
conventional high capacity container carrying wagons (rather than the
more expensive alternative of low deck wagons, or transporting freight
by road).

3.      The project will also receive funding from Network Rail, the
Northern Way, European Regional Development Funding, Merseytravel and
Peel Holdings

4.      Network Rail will start the construction of the scheme early next
year, and it is scheduled to complete by 2011.

5.      These awards are in addition to the £200m announced in this
summer's 'Delivering a Sustainable Railway' White Paper for the
development of a Strategic Freight Network.

6.      For further information and copies of the strategic framework

Trains have reversed at Southampton Airport Parkway (using either
platform) in the past during weekend engineering works at
Southampton; I know, because I've gone there specifically to traverse
any 'rare' crossovers on offer. Here's the chapter and verse:

On 3rd February 2001 I travelled from SAP platform 2 'wrong line' to
Eastleigh platform 2, continuing onto the up fast; on 9th May 2004 my
down train left Eastleigh platform 2 then crossed to the up line,
arriving at SAP platform 1.

Admittedly only a limited service could be operated in this way.
Would it be sufficient?

Possibly not.  The only time I was involved we detrained at Eastleigh onto a
bus.  But then I'm not a track-basher so wouldn't be looking out for odd
moves like that.  The advantage of continuing to St Denys would be
maintainence of the service to there and Swaythling and providing interchange
to the Fareham line services which would also have to reverse at Northam.

Agree with that - but of course any individual train can still terminate at
Parkway as far as pax are concerned, even if it then runs to St
Denys/Northam as ECS to reverse, to avoid problems with too many numbers at
St Denys, which could still be served by a local stopper...
