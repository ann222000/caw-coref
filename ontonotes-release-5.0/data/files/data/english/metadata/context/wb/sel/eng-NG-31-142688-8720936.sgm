Bush repudiates Limbaugh's attack on the troops

by John Aravosis (DC)

About time.
http://tpmelectioncentral.com/2007/09/breaking_white_house_faults_rus...

So will Bush and Cheney still be doing interviews with the
troop-hater?

And will Republicans in Congress finally distance themselves from this
hateful excuse for a human being?

Will Republicans join with Democrats and vote to condemn Rush Limbaugh?
We know Democrats won't force them to vote against their hate monger in
chief. Democrats like losing and they really like looking weak.

Personally, I think anyone who voted to condemn free speech is unfit for
office and I'll never vote for them again. On the other hand, Republican
voters expect their elected officials and demagogues to be pigs and
enemies of the Constitution.

Rush LImbaugh is a loonie.  He hates Americans, who are democrats,
which means he hates the Majority of Americans.

He is very good at making you seem like a crazy person if you love
puppies or like Sunshine and he can make you believe skin cancer is a
precious gift from Republicans we should all be glad to get it.
