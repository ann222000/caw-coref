In Iowa, 'tis the season for TV pitches, political and commercial. By
the time Iowans ring in the New Year, they may be sick of both.

An earlier date for Iowa's caucuses probably means presidential
candidates will run more television ads from mid-November through
December, the height of the Christmas shopping season when retailers
want to promote sales.

Moving the caucuses up 11 days to Jan. 3 also will force candidates to
pay top dollar for TV ads over the holidays and soften their messages
to avoid violating the serenity of the season. The same equation
applies in New Hampshire, whose first-in-the-nation primary will
follow the Iowa caucuses five days later.

&quot;This is just like adding a hailstorm to a hurricane,&quot; said Evan
Tracey, who tracks political advertising as chief operating officer
for TNS Media Intelligence/Campaign Media Analysis Group. &quot;You've got
a 16-deep field of candidates, interest groups and everybody else
that's all going to want the same time.&quot;

The schedule presents a conundrum for the presidential campaigns.
Political advertising has a tendency to become more negative closer to
an election as candidates seek to contrast themselves with their
rivals.

&quot;Attack ads don't necessarily blend well with Santa Claus and holiday
cheer,&quot; said Steve McMahon, a Democratic media strategist who ran
Howard Dean's presidential ad campaign in 2003 and 2004.

What's more, in a field with many candidates, negative advertising can
backfire.

&quot;If candidate A attacks candidate B, it's often not candidate A who
benefits. It's candidate C or D or E,&quot; McMahon said.

He should know. In 2003, Dean was the target of negative advertising
from liberal and conservative independent groups in Iowa and then
engaged in tit-for-tat attack ads with Dick Gephardt. The result was
that John Kerry won the Iowa caucuses and John Edwards came in second.

To avoid such a scenario, candidates may count on independent groups
to do the dirty work during the holidays. The Federal Election
Commission on Tuesday opened the way for corporations and unions to
finance political ad campaigns in the closing days of an election,
provided they focus on a public policy issue.

But those issue ads still can target a candidate, and campaign finance
experts are counting on a barrage to hit the Iowa and New Hampshire
airwaves next month. The only question facing any independent groups
is whether there are enough time slots available for a 30-second or 60-
second TV spot.

Dennis Goldford, a political science professor at Drake University in
Des Moines, predicted that campaigns would run positive ads promoting
candidates until Christmas, then switch to a tougher tone in the week
leading to the caucuses.

&quot;There's not much of a window there between Christmas spirit and
caucus battle,&quot; Goldford said. &quot;There's a certain amount of guesswork
because we haven't been in this position before.&quot;

Tim Albrecht, a spokesman for Republican Mitt Romney, said all the
campaigns will work to design ads that stand out while also remaining
appropriate for the holiday season. &quot;With the holiday ads and the
added retailers, no doubt it's going to be a bit more cluttered this
time than maybe years past,&quot; he said.

Campaigns strategists say they worry more about turning voters off in
Iowa, where attending caucuses requires effort and commitment.

Fergus Cullen, the chairman of the New Hampshire Republican Party,
said New Hampshire voters understand that politics will intrude on
their holiday.

&quot;I expect candidates will work the Communion line at St. Joe's on
Christmas Eve,&quot; he joked. &quot;New Hampshire voters take the process
seriously and they fully expect to be in the thick of politics during
the holiday season and that includes contrasting message. It won't
harm candidates if they run aggressive campaigns.&quot;

All this costs money. Television stations must provide air time to
federal election candidates beginning 45 days before an election. If
candidates pay top rate, they can grab a specific time slot and bump
other advertisers who had the space reserved.

Saying no to local advertisers puts stations in a difficult position,
but most business people understand, said Steve Lake, national sales
manager at KCRG-TV in Cedar Rapids.

&quot;Most of them have been through this before and they understand we can
only do what we can do,&quot; Lake said. &quot;There's quite a bit of
displacement that goes on.&quot;

Lake said bumped advertisers usually are offered a spot elsewhere in
the station's schedule with a comparable rating, but with only so many
hours in the day, some advertisers will be out of luck. The pressure
will build as front-running candidates boost their ad buys and lesser-
known candidates go for broke, he said.

Paul Fredericksen, general manager of KCCI-TV in Des Moines, said all
the station can do is seek a balance between political buyers and
retailers during the expected holiday crunch.

&quot;One thing we always keep in mind is that political is temporary and
retail is something that is a livelihood day in and day out,&quot;
Fredericksen said. &quot;But at the same time on the political side, there
are certain rules and regulations we have to comply with.&quot;

Station managers expect many candidates will pay top rates to ensure
sought-after time slots, given a campaign season that already has set
TV advertising spending records.

Both Romney and Democrat Barack Obama have spent at least $4 million
each for ads in Iowa. Democrats Hillary Rodham Clinton and Bill
Richardson also have exceeded the more than $2.5 million that Kerry
spent in the state in 2003 and 2004.
