Just had a new Indian Limestone patio laid, and the joins pouinted. In
my local B+Q store they are selling Thompsons One coat, Natural Stone
Sealer. What is the current thinking on these sealers ? Are they
recommended, will they enhance and protect the stone and how long will
they last ??

Personally, I'd go for Liquid Plastics K501:

Depends on the type of sealer.  Some form a surface coating or film like
varnish.  The film will eventually break down and possibly need stripping
back to recoat.

Alternatively they could be flurocarbon or silicone based products which
soak into the stone rather than forming a film on top.  Similar concept to
Scotchguard.  These tend to be much more expensive.

Can't find any info on the Thompsons stuff.
