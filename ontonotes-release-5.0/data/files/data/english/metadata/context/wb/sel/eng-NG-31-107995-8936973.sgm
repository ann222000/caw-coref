The motor on my newly acquired lathe doesn't look good to me. wires hanging
out, the cover for the fan is gone things like that. I'm wondering what kind
of motor to get. I know nothing about motors, and like to know what kind I
should get, can I have or need a reversible motor. I have 220 and 110 volts
only. It is in my garage. Strictly for hobby use. I think the reverse is
only used when one threads? I'm not sure.......Peter
The model # of the lathe is 101-07403

I can tell you as a beginning metal lathe trainee, I love the 1/4 horse 90
volt dc variable speed motor I put on my 6&quot; atlas/craftsman lathe..... I get
speeds from 26 rpm all the way up to 3300 rpm, with plenty of torque.
I sure like it!!!!!!!!!!

Mark the leads and remove the mot or from the lathe. Take it to
Grainger or a motor shop and find out what they have for you. You need
a motor with the same frame number, voltage etc. Hopefully it will be
220 capable and reverse capable. Be sure and get the wiring directions
or diagram.

I dont recommend reverse on a threaded spindle

you dont need reverse on the lathe because the forward and backward
movement you need to cut threads (Right and left handed and inside and
outside) is done by the gear train linking the spindle to the
leadscrew.

the Atlas lathe i have uses an AC motor spinning at around 1750 and
its 1/3 HP if i remember right

I'll try and remember to read my nameplate rating in the morning and
post it for you

just dont forget to not modify the speed reduction ratios on the belts
so that you maintain the same speeds

My atlas is a 10x36 but they are very similar

O.K.  For a 12&quot; lathe, I would suggest a 1-1/2 HP motor.

And while you *can* run that from 110-120 VAC, you will probably
trip the breaker more often than you would like when starting the motor
with the lathe set for high speeds.  You halve the current if the
motor is wired for 220-240VAC instead.  That is what I am using on my
12x24&quot; Clausing -- at least until I get around to swapping in a three
phase motor run from a VFD.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; only used when one threads?
">

There are times when reverse is really nice to have.  But the
first question is whether this is a threaded spindle or something else.
If threaded, you have to be careful in reverse, or you are likely to
unscrew your chuck.  I changed mine from a 2-1/4x8 threaded spindle to a
L-00, which has no danger of unscrewing.

But even with a threaded spindle -- it is possible to make up a
locking backplate so the chuck won't unscrew.  (Quite a few Myford
lathes have that feature.

And -- if you are using collets to handle rod stock through the
spindle, there is no problem running in reverse, since there is nothing
using the spindle thread.

Note that the typical single phase motor *must* be allowed to
spin down to a stop.  If you simply switch it to reverse while it is at
speed, it will keep going the direction that it was already going.
(This is one reason for changing to a three phase motor, where reverse
is *sure* to be reverse. :-) I do a lot of switching between forward and
reverse when using a releasing tap holder in the bed turret for internal
threads (like 1/4-20 or 10-32), since there is otherwise no way to back
the tap out of the hole which it has just tapped.  The releasing tap
holder at least keeps you from driving the tap in until it breaks. :-)

As for reverse with threading -- other than when threading with
a tap or a die, it is only necessary when you want to cut a left-hand
thread, or when you want to cut a normal thread from a shoulder to the
free end to avoid running into the shoulder.

But no matter what -- get a motor which you can reverse.  I
would suggest (assuming that you don't want to go for a three phase with
a VFD to drive it) that you get a dual voltage (120/240V) single phase
motor at around 1-1/2 HP.  Once you have that, it is fairly easy to
reverse the motor with the wiring to the drum switch.  (When the time
comes, post again, and I (or someone else) will go into the details of
that wiring.

Oh yes -- if you can't mount the motor somewhere where it won't
be hit by the metal chips, you want a TEFC (Totally Enclosed Fan Cooled)
motor, so the chips can't get inside the motor where they can do damage.

And you probably don't want to buy a new motor -- get a used one
from eBay or somewhere local if you can -- the price is a *lot* better.

Good Luck,
DoN.

I had reverse on my first Myford.

I miss having it, as I do not, on the one I now have.

Single phase motors, at least the one I had, will quite happilly carry
on in the direction they are running, if the switch is thrown while it
is running. About the only time there was a risk of unscrewing a chuck,
was if the motor were strarted in high rpm mode, and in reverse. Net
result, chuck potentially walks off the end of spindle, and lands on
bed, or cross slide. Never had it happen, so I say, potentially.

A metal tab, or other safety device blocking the reversed setting on
the switch will go a long way to prevent that, if you set it up correctly.
If you do not, you will learn from experience, or you will always
remember. &lt;shrug&gt; I never had a problem with it.

Being able to reverse the spindle was very nice, when I had to do a
wee bit of grinding in the lathe. Feeding the work against the stone
rather than with it was a benefit.

Reverse is also handy if you want to thread metrics or worm pitches,
as you will be able to run the whole works back to the start without
having to disengage the gear train, potentially losing your indexing,
and you will not then have to crank it all the way back by hand, two
dozen or more times.

Peter,

I bought my Craftsman 12x36 new from Sears in 1974.  I put a Dayton 3/4hp
single phase motor in it wired for 220 and gave it it's own 15A per-leg
circuit (mostly so the lights won't flicker upstairs every time I turn it on
down in the shop - I know I'd hear about that).  I wouldn't recommend any
more power though, as this is a really light-weight lathe for a 12&quot;.

I have a reversing switch, and I use it.  There are times (like winding a
spring) it's just plain easier.  To get the chuck mounted solidly though, you
have to be meticulous about keeping the threads on both the spindle and chuck
clean.  Set the back-gears to lock the spindle and seat the chuck by giving
it a good half spin BY HAND.  Release the back-gear, and you're good to go.
Never power the chuck on - really bad for the lathe and you could end up with
a permanently mounted chuck.

There's always a risk working in reverse with a threaded chuck - use very
light cuts, and NEVER an interrupted cut.  Even so, it's always better to
take the time to create the proper tooling and do the job running forward,
but in all the years I've used this lathe, I've only knocked the chuck loose
in reverse twice. YMMV!

There's also another need for reverse: tapping in the lathe (I can hear the
gasps from here).  However, using ONLY gun taps, working in non-ferrous
metals with proper lubrication, and having plenty of clearance in the bottom
of the hole (or better yet, a through-hole), I do it all the time.  Heck of a
lot faster and more accurate than doing it by hand.

- Bruce

Are the back gears Zamac as well as the threading/feed gears?
If so, then I would worry about stripping them.

But I still think 1/2 HP is a bit too small for a 12&quot; lathe.  It
might be reasonable for a 10&quot; one.  Perhaps go for 3/4 HP or 1 HP for
the 12&quot; lathe.

And -- a lot safer with a releasing tap holder made for a
turret.  You'll need to adapt it to fit in the tailstock chuck -- or
with a well centered boring bar holder in the carriage, and set a
carriage stop to stop the holder, and thus force it to release and spin
with the chuck and workpiece.  Then you stop and reverse the spindle
(two separate steps with a single phase motor), and pull back on the
releasing tap holder to cause it to pick up a separate dog (or with
friction) to back the tap out.

I use my releasing tap holders in a bed turret, because I have
one, and the other stations do other steps in preparing the workpiece
for tapping and other things like knurls on the outside, and perhaps
external threads with a Geometric die head.  That, at least, you don't
have to stop and reverse the spindle -- the chasers are mounted like the
jaws of a chuck, and retract quickly clear of the workpiece at the end
of the threading operation, so you can back it off with the workpiece
still spinning forwards.

Well thanks Don, I think I just started my Christmas list.  All this time
I've been trying to hold my mouth just right to stop the lathe at the
right time.  &quot;Usually&quot; it works fine.  Time for another upgrade to the
basement shop...

&gt;&gt; Peter,

&gt;      [ ... ]

&gt;&gt; There's also another need for reverse: tapping in the lathe (I can hear
the
&gt;&gt; gasps from here).  However, using ONLY gun taps, working in non-ferrous
&gt;&gt; metals with proper lubrication, and having plenty of clearance in the
bottom
&gt;&gt; of the hole (or better yet, a through-hole), I do it all the time.
Heck of a
&gt;&gt; lot faster and more accurate than doing it by hand.

&gt;      And -- a lot safer with a releasing tap holder made for a
&gt; turret.  You'll need to adapt it to fit in the tailstock chuck -- or
&gt; with a well centered boring bar holder in the carriage, and set a
&gt; carriage stop to stop the holder, and thus force it to release and spin
&gt; with the chuck and workpiece.  Then you stop and reverse the spindle
&gt; (two separate steps with a single phase motor), and pull back on the
&gt; releasing tap holder to cause it to pick up a separate dog (or with
&gt; friction) to back the tap out.

&gt;      I use my releasing tap holders in a bed turret, because I have
&gt; one, and the other stations do other steps in preparing the workpiece
&gt; for tapping and other things like knurls on the outside, and perhaps
&gt; external threads with a Geometric die head.  That, at least, you don't
&gt; have to stop and reverse the spindle -- the chasers are mounted like the
&gt; jaws of a chuck, and retract quickly clear of the workpiece at the end
&gt; of the threading operation, so you can back it off with the workpiece
&gt; still spinning forwards.

&gt;      Enjoy,
&gt;           DoN.

Fred,
no those numbers are from the top to the bottom, in terms of back gears,
dual pulleys on the jack shaft and the 4 pulleys on the head... It can go
lower then 26 with the back gear, but the torque just isn't there.

I don't think that he is advocating switching the tumbler when
in the middle of threading -- just using it to choose between right-hand
and left-hand threading.

And note that *some* lathes have a dog clutch between the
threading gearing and the leadscrew, so you can halt the leadscrew and
re-engage it without losing sync.  Some of these even handle the
reversing, I believe.

This is fine *if* you are cutting imperial threads with an
imperial leadscrew, or metric threads with a metric leadscrew.  If you
are crossing systems, you need to use transposing gears in the
headstock, and you can't disengage the half-nuts without losing sync, so
you pretty much *have* to run the lathe in reverse.

Enjoy,

Don, I don't know for sure exactly what he was advocating.  Hard to
tell without a Ouija board...

He did, however, recommend not having a reversing switch on a lathe
with a threaded spindle.  That's his choice, but an awful lot of
machinists wouldn't be caught dead without the reversing switch -
threaded spindle or not.  I'm one.

You are, of course, right about fractional vs. metric leadscrews and
threading.

There is that.  I guess that I was just assuming. :-)

As am I.  (Well ... I do have three lathes without reversing
switches -- but they are the small ones, the Unimat SL-1000, the Taig
(though I am going to be switching in a small three-phase motor and VFD
which will give it reversiblity), and the Emco-Maier Compact-5/CNC,
which would have no problems with the chuck coming off under power,
because the chucks mount to the flat nose of the spindle by three or
four screws which pass through the body of the chuck.  But I'm not sure
how well the CNC could be adapted to reverse running of the DC motor.
I've been more tempted to use some of the extra control outputs to
switch between two speed control pots in place of the single one which
is fitted as it comes from the factory.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; You are, of course, right about fractional vs. metric leadscrews and
&gt; threading.
">

Which is why I am very glad to have the Compact-5/CNC, since all
it requires is rotating a switch to go between metric and imperial
threads (and everything else).  So -- so far - it is what I use when I
need a metric thread, though I do have the transpose gears set for my
12x24&quot; Clausing.  So far, I have not had a project which needed metric
threads large enough to require that machine.

Enjoy,
DoN.

I just went out and asked one of our machinists about reversing a
lathe (we have at least three), and he pointed to one very large
one and said, &quot;When they first installed that one, they wired it
backwards (two phases swapped); the spindle pulley has an arrow
on it to tell the right direction. The motor has to run one way,
because it operates the oiler pumps.&quot; So as far as he knows, the
reversing is done by way of the gearbox.

Hope This Helps!

This applies to gear headstock lathes, but not to belt drive
ones, such as the Craftsman listed above, or my 12x24&quot; Clausing, so it
does not apply to the person who originated this thread.

Those are reversed by reversing the motor, which drives nothing
but the spindle and (though the threading gears) the leadscrew and (if
present) feed rod.

3 years ago I got a 101-07402 made in 1938, but came with some mods;
Timken tapered roller bearings and a modern 0.25 hp Century motor.

I wired it so it has reverse, but it is still anemic compared to my 3 hp
Clausing.

Someone in bringing me a DC permanent magnet motor next month, that was
surplussed form Precor and their treadmills. I am going to make my own
controller.

I think the lathe can handle all kinds of torque, but the belt drive
seems like it is always on the edge of oscillation.
