&quot;Behemoth and Leviathan&quot; by William Blake, 1825

Hi everyone,

I hope you enjoyed wrapping up the book of Job a couple of days ago! I know I did. In fact, one very interesting thing that I really want to now study further is what exactly was the &quot;behemoth&quot; in Job Chapter 40 and what was the &quot;leviathan&quot; in Job Chapter 41? Were these dinosaurs?? I ask this very openly, in that I don't know. Currently my thinking is lined up with the New Living Translation saying that the behemoth is a hippopotamus and that the leviathan is a crocodile – and obviously those of you that saw my blog entry saw that I had images up yesterday of a hippo and croc. But. . . some of you posted up some good questions and points on the behemoth and leviathan's being something else. . . perhaps even dinosaurs? I know we have some Biblical scholars and many pastors receiving this email each week. What say you? Please post up your thoughts on what the behemoth and leviathan are on the One Year Bible Blog at this link:

Yesterday we began the book of Ecclesiastes!  We will be reading about the vanity of life apart from God in this book. I think some people may find this to be a depressing book. I find it hopeful! Yes, indeed life is depressing apart from God. But life with God is an unending beautiful adventure. (certainly with some trials along the journey. . .)  I pray the book of Ecclesiastes draws you into thanksgiving for the amazing life we can indeed have in relationship with Jesus, God, and the Holy Spirit!

On Wednesday we wrap up Ecclesiastes and begin the Song of Solomon (or Song of Songs) on Thursday! Now, for those of you that have not read Song of Solomon before, let me say this up front – this is a book for married folks y'all! J Well, yes, us single folks can read it, but we would do well to know that this book is all about the beauty of love and, yes, sex - within marriage. As we all know, love and sex can get so very twisted by our modern world these days. If you haven't done much reading on God's plan for sex in our lives, I highly recommend you consider reading the book &quot;Real Sex: The Naked Truth about Chastity&quot; by Lauren Winner. Lauren is a Christian, in her early 30's. This book is a very honest and glorifying look at sex as it was intended by God. I think this book will make the word &quot;chastity&quot; hip and cool! Really.

Then. . . wow. . . this book just snuck up on me. . . on Saturday of this week we begin the book of the prophet Isaiah! Get ready for some Eighth century B.C. prophecies of the coming Messiah, Jesus Christ!

Love Your Neighbor: Please take 5 minutes to explore Food for the Hungry's website link at the bottom of this email today?

King Solomon writing the book of Ecclesiastes

Ecclesiastes
Author: Probably Solomon, the son of David
Date: Probably tenth century B.C.
Content: This difficult book displays the dark philosophy of one who sought to find peace apart from God, but in the end realized that only futility is to be found there. The only possible solution to life's puzzle concludes this book: &quot;Fear God and keep his commandments, for this is the whole duty of man.&quot; (Ecclesiastes 12:13) Leading up to that positive statement is a series of pictures, each one portraying the futility of life without God. Wealth, wisdom, popularity, and pleasure are all put down as so much vanity. Only when a man turns from this world to God will he find true happiness.
Theme: There is a negative lesson to be learned from this book. It is a series of things not to do. It shows the emptiness of trying to live for oneself and to please oneself alone without considering the needs of others or considering God our Maker. There is a positive side, however. If one can see how not to live, perhaps then he will see what he ought to do and be spared the heartaches of living a wasted life. (Above commentary is from Tyndale Publishers &quot;One Year Bible Companion&quot; p. 10) Fantastic commentary on the book of Ecclesiastes titled &quot;On the Wings of Eternity&quot; is at this link and commentary titled &quot;The Theology of Ecclesiastes&quot; is at this link.

Song of Solomon (or Song of Songs)
Author: Solomon
Date: Tenth century B.C.
Content: This book, about the love of Solomon and a Shulamite woman, consists of a series of lyrics or songs, hence the designation in the text: the Song of Songs. It is a simple but moving piece, describing the longing of two lovers for one another, of the struggles that need to be overcome, of the tender feelings that love awakens, and of the joy that the lovers find in being together. The young women of Jerusalem, who appear with Solomon and his beloved, add to the dramatic effect of the story by adding observations of their own.
Theme: The most obvious meaning of this narrative is that human love, which was ordained by God, is good and holy when enjoyed in obedience to the commands of God. Many interpreters have found a symbolic meaning in the book, however, and point to the love of God for Israel or the love of Christ for his church. Seen in this way it underscores the teaching of the New Testament that God is love (see First John 4:8). (Above commentary is from Tyndale Publishers &quot;One Year Bible Companion&quot; pp. 10-11) Great commentary on the Song of Solomon is at this link:

&quot;Whoever sows generously will also reap generously.&quot; 2 Corinthians 9:6

Questions for Reflection
1. This week in Isaiah chapter 1 verses 2 and 3 we will read these words of the prophet Isaiah – &quot;Hear, O heavens! Listen, O earth! For the LORD has spoken: &quot;I reared children and brought them up, but they have rebelled against me. The ox knows his master, the donkey his owner's manger, but Israel does not know, my people do not understand.&quot; These words were spoken to the Israelites in the 8th century B.C., but do you suppose they can apply to our modern world today as well? Do we know God? Do we truly understand God? I do think that sometimes we can forget that God is our Father. We are his children. He has brought us up. And we have rebelled. Is an ox at times smarter than us in terms of knowing who its master is? Do we truly know who our Master is? I'm afraid sometimes I live my life as if I am my own master. I am &quot;master of my own destiny!&quot; Well. . . am I really? What about you. Who is your master day in and day out? Do you know your Master? Do you understand?

2. This week in Second Corinthians chapter 9 verses 6 through 8 we will read these words of Paul's – &quot;Remember this: Whoever sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and whoever sows generously will also reap generously. &quot;Each man should give what he has decided in his heart to give, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver. And God is able to make all grace abound to you, so that in all things at all times, having all that you need, you will abound in every good work.&quot; Great verses! A lot of ground is covered in these verses. Do you believe that we reap what we sow? What are you sowing? What have you decided in your heart to give? Do you give without reluctance? Do you give without compulsion? Are you a cheerful giver? Do you realize that God gracefully gives you all that you need so that you will participate in good works? Are you participating in God's grace that he is freely giving to you?

3. This week we will be reading one of my favorite Psalms – Psalm 51! Psalm 51 is David’s humble prayer for forgiveness and cleansing, after David had committed adultery with Bathsheba and had her husband Uriah killed in battle. I believe that this Psalm can continue to be a humble prayer for forgiveness and cleansing for each of us today. This Psalm is read by many liturgical churches during the season of Lent as a penitential Psalm. Bible.org has a good in depth look at Psalm 51 at this link - http://bible.org/page.php?page_id=1884 A brief quote from this Bible.org link is this – &quot;The application of the psalm to believers today should be obvious. We, like David, can and must have complete cleansing before we can fully and freely serve God in any capacity. Our eternal destiny may not be in doubt when we sin as believers, and neither was David’s because he appealed to that covenant relationship, but our fellowship and service will be. God will not tolerate unconfessed
sin, and so will hold us accountable if we do not confess.&quot; I’ve been trying to figure out my favorite portion or two of this Psalm to share with you. . . but I can’t just pick one portion. It is all so powerful! Tell you what – I think I’m going to copy the full Psalm below. Please take a few moments to meditate upon this Psalm. My questions for reflection are these – Do you confess your sins to God? Do you confess your sins to others? And ask them to hold you accountable? When was the last time you confessed your sins to God? Do you have sins to confess to God today? Will you do so now? I pray this Psalm opens up your heart to the amazing burden that is lifted when we confess our sins to God. . .

Psalm 51

Have mercy on me, O God,
according to your unfailing love;
according to your great compassion
blot out my transgressions.
Wash away all my iniquity
and cleanse me from my sin.

For I know my transgressions,
and my sin is always before me.
Against you, you only, have I sinned
and done what is evil in your sight,
so that you are proved right when you speak
and justified when you judge.
Surely I was sinful at birth,
sinful from the time my mother conceived me.
Surely you desire truth in the inner parts;
you teach me wisdom in the inmost place.

Cleanse me with hyssop, and I will be clean;
wash me, and I will be whiter than snow.
Let me hear joy and gladness;
let the bones you have crushed rejoice.
Hide your face from my sins
and blot out all my iniquity.

Create in me a pure heart, O God,
and renew a steadfast spirit within me.
Do not cast me from your presence
or take your Holy Spirit from me.
Restore to me the joy of your salvation
and grant me a willing spirit, to sustain me.

Then I will teach transgressors your ways,
and sinners will turn back to you.
Save me from bloodguilt, O God,
the God who saves me,
and my tongue will sing of your righteousness.

O Lord, open my lips,
and my mouth will declare your praise.
You do not delight in sacrifice, or I would bring it;
you do not take pleasure in burnt offerings.
The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit;
a broken and contrite heart,
O God, you will not despise.

In your good pleasure make Zion prosper;
build up the walls of Jerusalem.
Then there will be righteous sacrifices,
whole burnt offerings to delight you;
then bulls will be offered on your altar.

4. This week in Proverbs chapter 22 verse 29 we will read – &quot;Do you see a man skilled in his work? He will serve before kings; he will not serve before obscure men.&quot; The thing I love about this Proverb is that it encourages us to be skilled in our work. Whether we are teachers, or bus drivers, or accountants, or technicians, or full time moms, I do strongly believe we are called to be skilled in our work. Do you really focus on your work and make sure you give 100% to your job? Do you avoid surfing the internet at work or chit-chatting for too long or checking personal emails? Do you work for your employer as if you were literally working for God? Do you believe that indeed no matter what your job is that you are really working for God? Do you want to give God your all? Will you give work your all? Don't get me wrong – I'm not encouraging us to be workaholics. I just think that too often we can slack off a bit at work and think it's no big deal. I think it is just the
opposite. I believe if we slack off at work we'll be more likely to slack off in other areas of our life, including our relationship with God. Are you skilled in your work? Do you realize that through your work you are not serving before obscure men, but you are indeed serving the King?

Psalm 51!
