Somehow, they recently convinced the California public utilities
commission to increase the fee for residential phone lines to be
unlisted. It has gone from 25 cents/month to $1.25!!  This is $15/year
to have an unlisted number!

Maybe in the 1970's you could make the argument that it actually cost
them money to remove names from the directory, but with the computerized
databases they have today, this charge has to be unsubstantiated. They
set a checkbox when they open your account and that's it; how could
there be an ongoing cost to it?

It would make just as much sense to charge people extra for having a
long last name, because the accounts people have to press more keys to
open the account.

I suspect the $15 nolist fee(seems like it's about $5 here
in Texas) has nothing to do with any steps necessary to
conceal the listing. But rather, is simply an allocation of
lost revenue to those nolist customers, for which the list
cannot be whored out to numerous direct marketing
companies.

It has nothing to do with an ongoing cost to maintain the non-listed status,
it has to do with..

1. Lost revenue because they can't sell your number to advertisers.
2. Consumers want nonlisting bad enough to pay for it - thus, AT&amp;T would be
passing up easy money by giving it away for free.

I'm not sure the California PUC was even involved in the process
other than to be notified.  ISTR that in a past rate case, the CPUC
agreed to let AT&amp;T charge whatever they want for any discretionary
or add-on services.  AT&amp;T only needs to get CPUC approval to change
basic monthly service and intrastate toll rates.

So items like caller-ID, call waiting, 3 way calling, wiring
&quot;protection&quot; plan, etc are all priced solely at the discretion of
AT&amp;T.

Like most charges associated with AT&amp;T, this one is bogus.  Take your phone
number and run.  I went to Time Warner and couldn't be happier.

While every month I had to call and complain with AT&amp;T about my billing, Time
Warner's bills are the same always.  I can honestly say in the 25 years I've
been a TW customer (cable TV... 12 years with Road Runner and 2 years with the
telephone service), they have never fucked up a bill.  I'm not sure AT&amp;T ever
got one really right.  Every month was always a new adventure.

I really don't know that the CPUC was involved - I just assumed.  The
reason is that this came to my attention is that a friend who is
low-income and qualified for lifeline service just saw their bill go
from $6.60 to $7.73 because of this (their were other minor rate changes
as well, hence the difference is not exactly $1). It just seems even
more outrageous that they can stick someone on lifeline service with an
extra dollar a month because they feel like it.

Of course my friend won't die over a dollar increase, but you have to
wonder - if the state mandates that Lifeline service will be $4.83 (plus
taxes), but then allows AT&amp;T to charge whatever they feel like for other
things like being unlisted, I gotta say &quot;What's the point?&quot; If we have a

That could be true but I couldn't find anything on the virtually
useless CPUC web site.

I was able to find the following taken from Order D0608030 (August
24, 2006)
&quot;Although we require all carriers to provide a thirty-day notice to
customers of any price increase or more restrictive term and
condition, we simplify all tariff procedures and make tariffs
effective after one day. We order a separate briefing cycle to
consider whether we should altogether detariff telecommunications
services other than basic residential service.&quot;

It sounds to me like they want to hang on to regulating basic
residential prices, I'm sure for political reasons.

Note that despite cries of competition and lowered prices, AT&amp;T
still has their antiquated intra-state zone based local tolls. Using
OneSuite, I can call from San Diego to South Africa cheaper than I
can call a place 21 miles away from me.  Calling England, most of
Europe and New Zealand is cheaper by half than calling 13 miles
away.

It's time for AT&amp;T to enter the competitive marketplace.

So, it's no surprise that AT&amp;T has been successful in shafting the
consumers. Soon AT&amp;T will control all aspects of life in America - if

the quality of life for ordinary Americans and most consumers,
including small businesses. AT&amp;T has been a name that is analogous to
poor quality, greed, screw-ups, horrible service, and outright evil.

Hating AT&amp;T is not going to get us any where. We must take action to
destroy the evil power of AT&amp;T, the power that has been juicing us
dry. Again, AT&amp;T must be broken up again to ensure the liberty,
freedom, and justice (among other bullshit sale pitch our corrupt
government has been trying to tell sell/deceive/dump on us).

AT&amp;T is all about GREED and EVIL as it's identified itself well with
the Bush admin.

Cancel your service with AT&amp;T if you can. AT&amp;T is notorious for buying
the better competitors and destroy them. This is what AT&amp;T calls
'competition'. They simply eliminate their competition and maintain a
poor service without any respect for quality and lower the standards
in the process. The losers: the consumers!

Actually, your state is responsible for those intra state

those calls and get a big cut for the privilege.  Onesuite
is a &quot;prepaid&quot; service which some states exempt, or do
routing schemes to make all calls interstate, or route them
as data streams (aka voip). And trying to tax on a 2

&gt; &gt;The Constitution was never intended to give us rights; it is intended to

&gt; Why do you think &quot;Right to Privacy&quot; would be thought to restrict

Read the Constitution; its a restriction on government.

&gt; Thats arguable.

&gt; Correct.

&gt; &gt; So, with that in mind, I ask you, where does the Constitution

&gt; It doesnt have to 'give' that explicitly. It clearly prevents the govt
&gt; from traducing the right to free speech, and dont do that with
&gt; privacy and even if it did, that is irrelevant to what a phone
&gt; company can do as far as listing your phone number in the
&gt; phone book for free unless you pay more to have it unlisted.

Could be. I figure that this question will make its way to the Supreme
Court, then we'll see what they say.

&gt; &gt;&gt; It seems equally outrageous that someone who is allegedly so poor that

&gt; &gt;&gt; income on frivolous options like unlisted numbers and Caller*ID.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Drop the fluff and the monthly bill will be back down to $4.83. Or, if
&gt; &gt;&gt; they can afford the fluff, then pay for it and STFU.

&gt; &gt;FU.  He has a right to complain!

&gt; And, since I am subsidizing his below-market-priced telephone service,
&gt; I have a right to complain as well. So FU2!

Raising the &quot;unlisted&quot; fee is a screwy way to &quot;correct&quot; for low
income prices!

No it wont, unlisted numbers have been around for a hell of a long time now.

Its obvious that the constitution only applies to what the govt can do, as you said.
