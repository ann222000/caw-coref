The minister of a Baptist church has been charged with indecent exposure
and driving under the influence, and police officers say he
propositioned them.

Tommy Tester, 58, of Bristol, Va., was wearing a skirt when he was
arrested last week after allegedly urinating in front of children at a
car wash, police said. Police also said Tester offered to perform oral
sex on officers who were sent to the scene.

Authorities identified Tester as the minister of Gospel Baptist Church
in Bristol and an employee of Christian radio station WZAP-AM in Bristol.

WGAL reports that police found an open bottle of vodka and empty
oxycodone prescription bottle in Tester's car.

Following the general anti-Mormon logic, does this mean all Baptists are
skirt-wearing drunks?  Perhaps this is one of those &quot;trained&quot;
individuals Duwaynea believes is qualified to teach sex education.

I don't think the untrained LDS lay clergy is qualified to individually
ask young people whether or not they masturbate. I think it's bizarre.

I see &quot;Joker&quot; is following in the fine tradition of David Bowie, Guy
R. Briggs, Dale, Diana, et. al.

For those who want to see what I *really* said, go to the thread
titled:

&quot;Mitt Romney backed age appropriate sex education in 2002&quot;

In this newsgroup.

Here's a short excerpt:

---------------------------
Mormon bishops are required to have no training at all.  These are
typically middle-aged men who have achieved some measure of success
within the LDS Church, but they don't have any formal or consistent
training in counseling, teaching, etc.

Also, please note that I'm not necessarily supporting Obama's
position.  I think intelligent people can discuss both sides of that
argument.

What I'm objecting to is the notion that Mitt Romney would take Obama
to task for proposing what I consider to be a far less intrusive
forum
on adolescent sex education than what's actually practiced by the LDS
Church and supported by Romney.

I think it might constitute institutionalized child abuse -- but then
I tend to be rather unforgiving of any situation that looks like phone
sex (without the phone) between a middle-aged man and a minor

Don't get a burr under your saddle; I replied to you there as well.
I'll ask again here though, is this one of those &quot;trained&quot; individuals

Easy with the term liar.  Lying is a deliberate act to deceive.  You are
the one preoccupied with the notion of &quot;untrained, lay clergy&quot;.  I
simply point out that this minister, to be a minister, is a &quot;trained&quot;
clergy, which, by what you have written, would be better than an
untrained clergy.

I did address you notion about Romney and Obama later in the other thread.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Tommy Tester, 58, of Bristol, Va., was wearing a skirt when he was
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; arrested last week after allegedly urinating in front of children
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; at a car wash, police said. Police also said Tester offered to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; perform oral sex on officers who were sent to the scene.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Authorities identified Tester as the minister of Gospel Baptist
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Church in Bristol and an employee of Christian radio station
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; WZAP-AM in Bristol.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; WGAL reports that police found an open bottle of vodka and empty
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; oxycodone prescription bottle in Tester's car.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Following the general anti-Mormon logic, does this mean all Baptists

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Here's a short excerpt:
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ---------------------------
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Mormon bishops are required to have no training at all.  These are
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; typically middle-aged men who have achieved some measure of success
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; within the LDS Church, but they don't have any formal or consistent
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; training in counseling, teaching, etc.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Also, please note that I'm not necessarily supporting Obama's
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; position.  I think intelligent people can discuss both sides of that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; argument.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Don't get a burr under your saddle; I replied to you there as well.
&gt;&gt;&gt; I'll ask again here though, is this one of those &quot;trained&quot; individuals
&gt;&gt;&gt; you think should be speaking to children and taking confessions?

&gt;&gt; Still lying about what I said?  Let me repeat my position for you one
&gt;&gt; more time:

&gt; Easy with the term liar.  Lying is a deliberate act to deceive.  You are
&gt; the one preoccupied with the notion of &quot;untrained, lay clergy&quot;.  I
&gt; simply point out that this minister, to be a minister, is a &quot;trained&quot;
&gt; clergy, which, by what you have written, would be better than an
&gt; untrained clergy.

&gt; I did address you notion about Romney and Obama later in the other thread.

'Trained' clergy doesn't necessarily include qualifications to
interrogate children about whether or not they masturbate. I'd expect
that that would be limited to qualified professional psychologists or
educators.

If you don't want to wear the label, then stop doing it.  You lied
when you blatantly invented and attributed to me things I didn't say.
For example, you lied when you said this:

&quot;So you agree with Duwaynea that this trained Baptist minister is
qualified?&quot;

I *never* said or implied any such thing.  You should be ashamed of
yourself.

You also lied when you said this:

&quot; ... is this one of those &quot;trained&quot; individuals
you think should be speaking to children and taking confessions?&quot;

I never advocated for that.  In fact, I specifically said that I was
*not* taking a position on that.

You think it's a &quot;preoccupation&quot; to argue that untrained, lay clergy
shouldn't be telling children to repent for masturbating?

Good grief.  The only &quot;preoccupation&quot; going on here is the horribly
obsessed need that apologists for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-
day Saints have to jump all over *anything* that's critical of their
church.

Mormon bishops have no formal training for their ecclesiastical
jobs.

Mormonism's preoccupation with masturbation is pervasive, with
children being given periodic interviews throughout life.  Those
children engaging in masturbation are required to go through a
process
of &quot;repentance.&quot; Some of the LDS advice to children for controlling
sexual urges is positively draconian.  Here's a link to a talk I
remember hearing when I was a young man in the LDS Church:

http://www.moonmac.com/Mormon_masturbation.html

This issue becomes even more applicable when you consider the fact
that Mitt Romney has served in leadership positions in the LDS church
that would have involved him asking these sorts of questions.
Imagine
Mr. Romney sitting at his desk asking a pretty teenage girl if she
plays with her private parts.  Is this Presidential material?

Given the harmful attitude of his church, and his personal behavior
(as a leader in that church) regarding human sexuality and how this
affects children, Mitt Romney really has no room to badger Obama
about
the far more benign *age* *appropriate* sex education that he has
proposed.

Professional psychologists will tell you that masturbation by children
is part of a normal and healthy childhood.  They're also likely to
tell you that adults who tell children they are sinning and need to
repent for masturbating may be doing serious mental harm.

http://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/BHCV2/bhcarticles.nsf/pages/Mastur...

All of which brings into focus presidential hopeful Mitt Romney who
(as a leader in the LDS Church) would have taught the church's party
line that masturbation is a sin to be repented of -- and who (most
probably) questioned many children about their &quot;private parts.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Tommy Tester, 58, of Bristol, Va., was wearing a skirt when he was
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; arrested last week after allegedly urinating in front of children at
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a car wash, police said. Police also said Tester offered to perform
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; oral sex on officers who were sent to the scene.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Authorities identified Tester as the minister of Gospel Baptist
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Church in Bristol and an employee of Christian radio station WZAP-AM
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in Bristol.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; WGAL reports that police found an open bottle of vodka and empty
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; oxycodone prescription bottle in Tester's car.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; http://www.wgal.com/news/13796466/detail.html
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Following the general anti-Mormon logic, does this mean all Baptists
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; are skirt-wearing drunks?  Perhaps this is one of those &quot;trained&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; individuals Duwaynea believes is qualified to teach sex education.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I don't think the untrained LDS lay clergy is qualified to individually
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ask young people whether or not they masturbate. I think it's bizarre.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; So you agree with Duwaynea that this trained Baptist minister is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; qualified?  No, that seems a little bizarre.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Joker is lying.  I never said that the Baptist minister is qualified.
&gt;&gt; I've noticed that many Mormon apologists use lying as one of their methods.

&gt; Many?  You know some that *don't?&quot;

It hardly requires any training to ask a person a yes or no question.

Actually, its a rather lucid comment. Everyone wants to diss the
mormons because they figure their leaders are not qualified to lead,
and here is a man who was trained, and considered qualfied, failing
miserably. The point is clear, that even &quot;trained&quot; people screw up,
and not all are in the best interests of the masses.

Still, the ovewhelming majority of baptist ministers are likely doing
a great job, and helping countless people make their lives better.
Just like here in antimormonville, just because you find one that
screws up, doesn't impune the character of millions of other members.

Life, faith, caring, and helping, is  never going to be a zero-defects
task.

Of course it does -- especially with children.  But that's not all the

them it's a sin and that they must repent.

Actually, you have it backwards.  This is an issue of inappropriate
intrusion and &quot;babysat&quot; by LDS leaders.

Look, it's really very simple.  Obama proposed that children receive
*age* *appropriate* sex education by trained professionals.

Mitt Romney says that's wrong --- BUT, Mitt supports the Church of
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints which involves un-trained middle-
aged men questioning children about whether or not they play with
their private parts.

What the LDS Church *does* is far more intrusive than what Obama
proposed.  It is unconscionable that the Church of Jesus Christ of
Latter-day Saints would have un-trained middle-aged men little
children and teenage girls and boys about masturbation.  Frankly, what
these Bishops and Stake Presidents do looks a bit like phone sex -
without the phone.

What I think, is of no consequence. My concerns are with people who
believe that  they can make the rules, stand on a pedestal, and
declare what other people can, and cannot do.

The children in question, are not forcibly hauled into interviews, and
bludgeoned into sexual abuse. Parents have responsibility for their
children. They are okay with, so those on the outside who object, are
of no consequence, especially since you lack any evidence of what goes
on, how it is presented, and whether it causes any problems, beyond
the occasional issues that always arise in all of society.

Pretending that its such a big deal, because every child is sexually
abused, is just stupid, and as I said, trolling.&gt;

I was not a  member of the church as a kid, so I cannot answer your

Oh no. Sorry bubbles....

He agreed that &quot;many mormon apologists&quot; are liars,without posting any
evidence to back it up. If he doesn't have to back up his words, why
on earth, should I have to do the same for mine?

Someone calls a group of people liars, without proof, and not a shred
of evidence, and you don't care, and will let him walk, but when I
call him a liar, you demand proof? Forget it jackson. Even the playing
field, and level the table, and then I will play the game.

I stand by what I said, and based on his behavior and words, I don't
feel any need to provide any more commentary to him, or you, on the
subject.

They stand at &quot;pedestals&quot; (that fancy podium in that big conference

Worse, they instruct Mormon Bishops to question little children about
masturbation, so these children can &quot;repent&quot; of the sin.  To see an

words of a prophet in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

You are really up in the night about this one. Not one of those
children has to go be interviewed. its is a free religion, and they,
along with their parents, choose what is right, and what is wrong.

You may be wanting to move this topic into the place where, yes, there
are unscrupulous people everywhere in society, and the LDS church is
made up of people in society, so it would not be hard to find someone
who has done wrong, but you seem to be arguing that the entire church,
consists of dirty old men, who have phone sex with &quot;pretty&quot; girls,
which is completely indefensibile.

Parents know what the questions are, and parents are free to object,
or not have their children participate. They are also responsible to
see that it is done properly. Your opinion that it is bad, has no
basis in fact. What bothers you, is that you are a former member, and
so you cannot abide the notion that people are content, and happy, and
doing what they believe God wants them to do, and it just irks you to
death. Otherwise, you would be out campaigning across the land, to put
an end to the teaching of masturbation being a sin. Its just the
church that galls you, nothing more than that.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Look, it's really very simple.  Obama proposed that children receive

&gt; Mitt Romney says that's wrong --- BUT, Mitt supports the Church of
&gt; Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints which involves un-trained middle-
&gt; aged men questioning children about whether or not they play with
&gt; their private parts.
">

It really is quiet simple...which is likely why you just don't get it.

Of course, one man is talking about education in schools, based on the
standards and the teachings of the government and its beliefs,  and
the other is a religious leader, asking a child a question, once a
year, for a total of maybe half a dozen times in their life and
explaining that it is wrong in the eyes of God. You seem to equate
mass education on how to &quot;do it,&quot; and why it &quot;is okay to do it,&quot; with
a religious leader, asking if they do it, and if the answer is yes,
telling the person that it is a sin in the eyes of God.

Those are two very different topics. Plus, you only back Obama,
because he wants to teach that its okay, and probably even show them
how to do it better, and more often, whereas the religious portion of
society finds it abhorrent, and does not wish to teach their children
that its okay to violate the word of God.

You have the rules of the LDS part of it, which is the question, and
the teaching that it is wrong, and you have not put up the rules of
what Obama wants to teach, but we know that, based one what the
government teaches so far, he wants the children to be taught the best
positions, the best places, the best  ways, how to do it with others,
and how its perfectly okay to do it anytime, and any place. You got
problems if you think those positions are the same.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; What the LDS Church *does* is far more intrusive than what Obama
&gt; proposed.
">

Among the stupider comments you have made. Please show how that can be
so? Post some government sponsored sex education materials, and show
us how they are more benign than a moral leader, asking a question,
realizing that if the answer is no, the subject is closed, and unless
you have some stats, I think you will find it is usually &quot;no&quot;

&gt;It is unconscionable that the Church of Jesus Christ of

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Latter-day Saints would have un-trained middle-aged men little
&gt; children and teenage girls and boys about masturbation.  Frankly, what
&gt; these Bishops and Stake Presidents do looks a bit like phone sex -
&gt; without the phone.
">

So would you mind it, if they were trained? I think you and manning
are mixing two things together, and just jumping back and forth for no
good reason other than to make sure you always look right.

Do you object to it completely, in any church, by anyone, or are you
just upset, because you think someone needs a college degree, and ten
years experience in doing it, in order to discuss it?

Your accusations are baseless. You constantly demand that I put up
references, and back up comments, and they you declare that 'Mormon
bishops basically have phone sex with children, without the phone.'

If you cannot back that ridiculous assertion, and if you cannot put
forth evidence that such a thing is normal and accepted in the church,
then you got no business demanding others to  put up their references.

Just put up the proof that LDS leaders have essentially phone sex,
with children, or just kindly shut the heck up about it. Your baseless
accusations are an insult to an awful lot of good people.

Here's the so what.

Obama proposed that there be *age* *appropriate* sex education
starting with young children.  Mitt Romney castigated Obama on that.

The problem is Mitt Romney supports the Church of Jesus Christ of
Latter-day Saints (LDS or Mormon) in far more intrusive aspects of
child sexuality. Specifically, the LDS Church promotes interviews in
which un-trained middle-aged men ask children detailed questions about
masturbation, and then counsel those children to repent because
masturbation is a &quot;sin.&quot;

By objecting to Obama's plan, but supporting the Church of Jesus
Christ of Latter-day Saints, Mitt Romney exposes himself as a
hypocrite.

In fact the issue goes deeper than that because Mitt Romney, as an
official in the LDS Church, participated in this abuse of children.

you are almost a functional illiterate, as you seem incapable of
reading and comprehending words. You think because I called your idea

calling your position stupid, is not name calling. I can see that you
are a product of the government school system, lacking the important
details as to how things work.

Your problem is, you can only want to deal with real Latter Day

take the offense, and who continually turn the other cheek, and try to
ignore your blather, rather than risk offense or inciting others.
There are some here, who represent the church quite well in that
respect. I do not represent it, but of course, you like to think I do,
and that is your choice, but it seems that when someone gets in your

I am nobody, but if it serves you to make me into someone I am not, I

the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints look bad by carrying
on like that?

&gt; Sure duwayne, whatever you say. Better to try to make me out to be
&gt; someone I am not, than to address the points, and defend your
&gt; positions.... Sure....

&gt; Not seeing any answers to what I asked you. I guess you just don't
&gt; have the balls to stand up for your pack of lies.

&gt;&gt;&gt; but in truth, I just think people like
&gt;&gt;&gt; you are morons,
&gt;&gt; But of course you do.  After all (in your mind) when you have the holy
&gt;&gt; ghost telling you what's right and wrong --

&gt; I sure don't have the holy ghost. You are a blithering fool to accuse
&gt; me of such a thing. If you really did belong to the church at one
&gt; time, you would know how such things work, and that people like me,
&gt; who have given up on the church, and walked away from it, are not so
&gt; richly blessed. Stop making shit up, and address the issue.

&gt; When you joined the Church, you received that Gift as well. What did
&gt; you do with it?
&gt;&gt;&gt; and so I speak out against your stupidity.
&gt;&gt; You use a lot of name calling.

&gt; Calling your ignorant comments, stupid, isn't name calling. Damn...
&gt; you are almost a functional illiterate, as you seem incapable of
&gt; reading and comprehending words. You think because I called your idea
&gt; stupid, that means I think you are stupid? Well, I do think that, but
&gt; calling your position stupid, is not name calling. I can see that you
&gt; are a product of the government school system, lacking the important
&gt; details as to how things work.

&gt; Your problem is, you can only want to deal with real Latter Day
&gt; Saints, who are good, honest, and upstanding people, who prefer not to
&gt; take the offense, and who continually turn the other cheek, and try to
&gt; ignore your blather, rather than risk offense or inciting others.
&gt; There are some here, who represent the church quite well in that
&gt; respect. I do not represent it, but of course, you like to think I do,
&gt; and that is your choice, but it seems that when someone gets in your
&gt; face, and calls you on your bullshit straw men, you wither and die,
&gt; turning to your favorite 'ad hominem' excuses as to why you don't
&gt; defend yourself.

&gt; I am nobody, but if it serves you to make me into someone I am not, I
&gt; can't stop you. Mostly, I think you just always get upset because you
&gt; can't push me around, and I am gonna call a &quot;shit for brains,&quot; a &quot;shit
&gt; for brains&quot; when I see it. You are only here to abuse people who love
&gt; God, and will just let you be a jerk, as that is the decent kind of
&gt; person that they are. Mostly, you are just a sad example of someone
&gt; who has thrown his life away, and knows not how to repent, and get it
&gt; back, so the goal is to make fun of, and denigrate, those of whom you
&gt; are most envious.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The minister of a Baptist church has been charged with indecent
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; exposure and driving under the influence, and police officers say
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; he propositioned them.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Tommy Tester, 58, of Bristol, Va., was wearing a skirt when he
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; was arrested last week after allegedly urinating in front of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; children at a car wash, police said. Police also said Tester
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; offered to perform oral sex on officers who were sent to the scene.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Authorities identified Tester as the minister of Gospel Baptist
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Church in Bristol and an employee of Christian radio station
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; WZAP-AM in Bristol.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; WGAL reports that police found an open bottle of vodka and empty
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; oxycodone prescription bottle in Tester's car.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; http://www.wgal.com/news/13796466/detail.html

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Following the general anti-Mormon logic, does this mean all
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Baptists are skirt-wearing drunks?  Perhaps this is one of those
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;trained&quot; individuals Duwaynea believes is qualified to teach sex
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; education.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I don't think the untrained LDS lay clergy is qualified to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; individually ask young people whether or not they masturbate. I
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; think it's bizarre.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; So you agree with Duwaynea that this trained Baptist minister is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; qualified?  No, that seems a little bizarre.

&gt;&gt;&gt; That's just plain dumb commentary, Joker. You're smarter than that.

&gt;&gt; Nah, I am just sticking a bee in the bonnet.  The notion or &quot;trained&quot;
&gt;&gt; or &quot;untrained&quot; clergy is just nonsense.

&gt; No, it isn't. The LDS lay clergy has no qualifications to discuss
&gt; masturbation with children.
">

OK, John.  What qualifies a person to discuss sex education with a
minor?  What type of training is required to hear confession?

&gt;&gt; Easy with the term liar. Lying is a deliberate act to deceive.

&gt; If you don't want to wear the label, then stop doing it.  You lied
&gt; when you blatantly invented and attributed to me things I didn't say.
&gt; For example, you lied when you said this:

&gt;  &quot;So you agree with Duwaynea that this trained Baptist minister is
&gt; qualified?&quot;
&gt; I *never* said or implied any such thing.  You should be ashamed of
&gt; yourself.

&gt; You also lied when you said this:

&gt; &quot; ... is this one of those &quot;trained&quot; individuals
&gt; you think should be speaking to children and taking confessions?&quot;

&gt; I never advocated for that.  In fact, I specifically said that I was
&gt; *not* taking a position on that.
">

I inferred from your comments that the problem with LDS clergy taking
confession was the fact that they are &quot;untrained&quot;.  This would lead
someone to the logical conclusion that a &quot;trained&quot; clergy is able to ask
the question.   I saw no reference otherwise in this thread or the other.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; You are the one preoccupied with the notion of &quot;untrained, lay clergy&quot;.

&gt; You think it's a &quot;preoccupation&quot; to argue that untrained, lay clergy
&gt; shouldn't be telling children to repent for masturbating?

&gt; Good grief.  The only &quot;preoccupation&quot; going on here is the horribly
&gt; obsessed need that apologists for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-
&gt; day Saints have to jump all over *anything* that's critical of their
&gt; church.
">

See.  Your comment here leads one to think that a trained clergy is able
to ask the question and receive the answer.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; simply point out that this minister, to be a minister, is a &quot;trained&quot;
&gt;&gt; clergy, which, by what you have written, would be better than an
&gt;&gt; untrained clergy.

&gt; Mormon bishops have no formal training for their ecclesiastical
&gt; jobs.

Yes they do.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Mormonism's preoccupation with masturbation is pervasive, with
&gt; children being given periodic interviews throughout life.  Those
&gt; children engaging in masturbation are required to go through a
&gt; process of &quot;repentance.&quot; Some of the LDS advice to children for controlling
&gt; sexual urges is positively draconian.  Here's a link to a talk I
&gt; remember hearing when I was a young man in the LDS Church:
">

I don't know what church you went to, but there is no such
preoccupation.  It is generally stated, for all ages, to keep you hearts
and minds pure.  This is also a tenet of many religions.

Haus, I don't know if that was actually written by the attributed leader
or not.  It is not impossible to to fabricate stuff and put it on the
web you know.  It should also be stated that the bulk of sexual science
pre-Kinsey was very much like what you describe.

&lt;Snip&gt;

So, did you tell your kids it was ok to play with themselves?  Or did
you just not discuss it?
