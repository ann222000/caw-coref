Vol 2 of Peter Riedel's 3 vol. history of the Wasserkuppe, chapter 5
is dedecated to this question.

It looks like the first successful and repeted airplane tows were done
at Kassel-Waldau airport, Germany, 12 March 1927 by Gerhard Fieseler
in the tow plane and Gottlob Espenlaub in the glider. Repeted on 20
March 1927.

By May of that year airplane towing was used for a glider acrobatic
contest at Rossitten on the Baltic coast in then East Prussia.

Even if you do not read German, Riedel's history of the Wasserkuppe is
an important work to own. It is also the history of gliding and the
Germans who invented it. It is worth having for the pictures alone.

US sell it?

In 1995 on the Wasserkuppe I paid 56 German marks per volume.

I have no idea what that would convert to in US dollers now, but $378
seems a bit high. .
