I've no idea if APEC has made the news over your way. It
should have, but may not have.

Put it this way, when the Presidents and Prime Ministers of
the USA, Russia, China, Japan, Indonesia and around 20 other
Asian and Pacific nations meet in Sydney, and the government
effectively makes the centre of our largest city a ghost
town for security purposes for nearly a week, it makes news
here.

When was the last time those first five met personally at
the same time, if ever?

So, we were treated to one of those leaders at his finest.

Remember, this is the APEC conference,
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4T4-OseE5E

Hosted in Australia:
http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,22378059-29277,00.html

Cheers, Alan, T2, Australia.

'O Lord, make my enemies ridiculous.' And God granted it.

I can't see how they can be charged with anything. The security was well,
insecure... After all the hype about security measures, major loss of

CBD?

When Luxembourg headed the European Union chair,
the rep in charge said the US demands on security and
facilities were just beyond his belief ... he said he would
most certainly document it when he writes his memoirs...

Its probly why Bush never goes to the smaller countries.
A single visit would bankrupt some of them ... ;))))

My condolences, Alan. We had it here in Vancouver 10 years ago and I was so
glad when it was over. What with riots and the world leaders being
helicoptered everywhere and we living between the airport and where the were
going it was horrendous.

I am pretty sure the 5 leaders you mentioned where here, possibly not China,
but we did have Ravjir (?) Ghandi and there were death threats against him
just to add to the mix.

Yes, our papers are carrying it. I guess the police force is rather
embarrassed by the &quot;Canadian&quot; diplomat car carrying Bin Laden.

Europe has had it's share of protests, riots, and security
problems.

You may be forgetting some of the Paris riots of recent
years. In fact Paris is the only city I've been to, apart
from Djakarta in '78, where I've seen police and military
wandering the streets (Champs Elysee at the time) in full
camouflage and armed with sub-machine-guns.
http://politicscentral.com/2006/10/25/france_prepares_50000_riot_pol.php
Or ask a Parisian if they remember '68.

Or the G8 riots in Rostock, one of the background reasons
for the Sydney overkill:
http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200706/s1940849.htm

Or when they closed Frankfurt Airport for GWB:

I sure agree. But then I've been through this nonsense before.

I laughed when I read that John Howard was keeping the Australian gift a
secret. And then went on to rave about the beautiful leather jackets Canada
gave. I hope so. We sure didn't get overjoyed. The cost the Canadian
taxpayers over $1,000 each. I hope your government shows more restraint.

You know, I just realized that we had to mount more security when Yeltsin
and Clinton had a meeting here than we did for APEC. Mind you since there
was only two of them the fences were restricted to the 2 hotels and they
managed to quell that potential riot before it started. Clinton could only
stay in an American hotel so he was at the Hyatt Regency---3 stars, while
Yeltsin stayed in the Royal Suite at the Pan Pacific---5 stars.
Unfortunately, for Clinton none of the American Hotels were 5 stars.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I've no idea if APEC has made the news over your way. It
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; should have, but may not have.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; At least it took the Downer (I can speak French) vs. Rudd (I can speak
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Mandarin) off the front page ;) The whole thing is a big circus.

&gt;&gt;&gt; And put Bush (I can't speak English) on it.

&gt;&gt;&gt; What did you think of the Chasers stunt? I thought it was
&gt;&gt;&gt; hilarious, and made the incredible security overkill look
&gt;&gt;&gt; silly:
&gt;&gt;&gt; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-DDWGKqGmI&amp;mode;=related&amp;search;=

&gt;&gt; I like how officials said it meant security was working?? Lol, they get
&gt;&gt; to a
&gt;&gt; second checkpoint and security is working??

&gt; I sure agree. But then I've been through this nonsense before.

&gt; I laughed when I read that John Howard was keeping the Australian gift a
&gt; secret. And then went on to rave about the beautiful leather jackets

I'm thinking about painting too.  6 years ago the effort alerted me to
a heart attack.  So I'm a bit shy.  Still chaffing at the bit.  Still
the work is about and needs to be done perhaps at a slower rate.
Mind says go for it body I don't know till I'm into it.

Bill sure I'll find some excuse to put it off.

I'm doing a little at a time and, as a 60yo diabetic, I'm
careful not to overdo it. There are lots of other jobs
happening in parallel with tradesmen - new kitchen, carpets,
window repairs etc so I have to work in between their times
and I don't have a deadline. I've almost finished the
interior and only have patch-ups to do on the exterior. I'm
not prepared to spend lots of time straining my calves
standing on ladders (it's a two-storey building). If the
outside needs more extensive painting I'll call in the
experts.

I only do an hour or two at a stretch, then pause and do
something else for a couple of hours. The worst part is
clean-up. I now buy cheap roller-covers and just bin that
day's roller at the end of the day. A long-handled
extendable roller handle is a major advantage for large wall
and ceiling areas. I did the doors in enamel so at the
moment I reek of turps. Acrylic is much easier to use but
doesn't give the same glossy finish for a door.

The energy it takes is surprising. I've been a little lazy
through the winter with my daily exercise and had put on a
kilo or two since April. Since I started this renovation in
late July I've lost three kilos.

Six years ago I was painting my sons room when I got Tired.  Changed
task to the kitchen where I got Tired.  Then sat on a chair where I got
tired. This over about about  an hour.  My eldest came in and I said I
need medical help.

Not saying this is for everybody but I never had chest pain just loss
of power.
