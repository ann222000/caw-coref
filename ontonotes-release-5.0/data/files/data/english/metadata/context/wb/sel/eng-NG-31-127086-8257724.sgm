Venesection therapy of insulin resistance-associated hepatic iron
overload.

BACKGROUND/AIMS:
The association of hepatic iron overload with metabolic disorders has
been coined as the insulin resistance-associated hepatic iron overload
syndrome (IR-HIO).
METHODS:
Fifty-six IR-HIO patients were phlebotomized either weekly (n = 14) or
bimonthly (n = 42) and compared with C282Y homozygotes and with ten IR-
HIO patients treated by a low calorie diet alone.
RESULTS:
In venesected patients, the median amount of mobilized iron was 0.6 g
in 2.8 months in females and 1.8 g in 5 months in males. Mobilized
iron did not differ depending on the frequency of venesections or HFE
genotype. When compared with C282Y homozygotes, IR-HIO patients had a
similar amount of mobilized iron, but three-fold serum ferritin
levels. The presenting symptoms (chronic fatigue and/or
polyarthralgias) improved in 6/7 patients. Phlebotomies were well
tolerated. In patients treated by a low calorie diet, serum ferritin
levels remained stable. CONCLUSIONS:
In IR-HIO patients, body iron stores are significantly increased,
overestimated by serum ferritin, not modified by a low calorie diet,
and safely removed by phlebotomies. Based on these data and on studies
indicating that iron excess is associated with increased risk for
hepatic fibrosis, cancer and cardiovascular disorders, venesection
therapy can be recommended in IR-HIO patients.

Keywords: patients, ferritin, serum, calorie, hepatic, mobilized,
calorie diet, mobilized iron, serum ferritin, ferritin levels,
patients treated, c282y homozygotes, iron overload, compared with,
with c282y, hepatic iron

Aloha IJ and All!

LOL!  So did I!! I had to do a &quot;triple-take&quot; as I had my &quot;V&quot; done back
in 1981 after way too many children were brought into this world by
this sex-crazed man.  I was relieved to re-re-read that the heading
didn't say that...whew!

Uh, Iron-J, my man?  Don't you think you are starting to dig just a
little too far for information to post here? Most of us are what you
might call, &quot;ordinary, average human beings&quot; just trying to cope and
live our lives as best we can with the support and friendship of
others here. How many of us do you really believe care very much about
this that I've C&amp;P'ed from your OP?

&quot;CONCLUSIONS:
In IR-HIO patients, body iron stores are significantly increased,
overestimated by serum ferritin, not modified by a low calorie diet,
and safely removed by phlebotomies. Based on these data and on
studies
indicating that iron excess is associated with increased risk for
hepatic fibrosis, cancer and cardiovascular disorders, venesection
therapy can be recommended in IR-HIO patients.&quot;

I think my left cerebral cortex blew out when I read the above!!  ;-)

You have read these a few times.

People with .. pre-diabetes / insulin resistance / IR .. AND with iron
overload in their livers / hepatic iron overload / HIO.. were found to
be treated .. well .. BY iron reduction.

IE: improved chronic fatigue and polyarthralgias

LOL, yep, perfect example how the use of fancy words makes things so
complicated and unreadable. Why couldn't they have just said that if
you give blood periodically, you will reduce the &quot;iron overload&quot; in
your liver and if you don't, you can expect to die of a heart attack,
stroke, liver disease or cancer. Hey, that might be a good campaign
slogan for the Red Cross? LOL

In this retrospective study, we report the results of the association
of a combined phlebotomy program and chelation in hereditary
sideroblastic anemia (HSA) to reduce iron overload after bone marrow
transplantation (BMT). A male HSA patient, not responding to
pyridoxine treatment, was submitted to successful allogeneic BMT. As
there was a persistence of a tissue iron overload, a regular
phlebotomy program was started followed by chelation. A significant
decrease of iron burden was obtained using a combined treatment with
deferoxamine (DFO) and deferiprone (L1) in addition to the phlebotomy
program. A 10-year follow-up shows a marked decrease in the
concentration of serum ferritin, non-transferrin-bound iron (NTBI),
liver iron and normal hemoglobin (Hb), which allows the patient to
reach and maintain a good quality of life.

Abstract:

Transfusional iron overload in patients with chronic anemias can
result in multiple organ failure. Experience in the management of
iron
overload in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes is limited, as
many do not receive chelation therapy due to short-life expectancy
and
the difficulties associated with the administration of the current
reference standard chelator, deferoxamine. There have, however, been
some reports of reduced transfusion requirement associated with
chelation therapy in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes and
myelofibrosis. Here, we discuss a patient with primary myelofibrosis
and related transfusion-dependent anemia who received chelation
therapy with the once-daily oral iron chelator, deferasirox. In
addition to the reduced iron levels, the patient demonstrated an
unexpected reduction in blood transfusion requirement, ultimately
resulting in long-lasting transfusion-free survival.

see someone acknowledge one of my less existential 'ones'.

Steve, thanks for mentioning the &quot;iron&quot; thingy. I know that
&quot;Ironjustice&quot; has a serious and valid topic to discuss, its just that
these quoted scientific studies get so professionally &quot;wordy&quot; that I
find myself looking up every other word and writing the meanings down
and rereading what he has posted and still don't quite &quot;get it&quot;. It
all get so tiresome sometimes when one is already dealing with the
lifestyle of a CPer....(sigh).

Aloha For Now,
Hawaiian Wayne

Howdy Wayne,
Long time no see only because I haven't been using Usenet much.
There's tranquility in other groups ;)

&gt;&gt;&gt; LOL, yep, perfect example how the use of fancy words makes things so
&gt;&gt;&gt; complicated and unreadable. Why couldn't they have just said that if
&gt;&gt;&gt; you give blood periodically, you will reduce the &quot;iron overload&quot; in
&gt;&gt;&gt; your liver and if you don't, you can expect to die of a heart
&gt;&gt;&gt; attack, stroke, liver disease or cancer. Hey, that might be a good
&gt;&gt;&gt; campaign slogan for the Red Cross? LOL

&gt;&gt;&gt; Please don't think that I am supporting or defending what our
&gt;&gt;&gt; resident ferrinnut digs up and posts, cause believe me, I'm not!
&gt;&gt;&gt; It's just your reply made me chuckle Wayne. ;o)

Aloha Cheeky!

I haven't been posting as regularly as usual because my life for the
last year has really become a &quot;living soap opera&quot;.  It's kind of like
the Simpsons-style or version of the &quot;Waltons&quot; except I'm the one that
may check into an &quot;asylum&quot; (instead of &quot;Ma Walton&quot; like in the
series). LOLOLOLOL!

I foolishly thought that after my SSDI came in and money worries were
over for a while (hopefully forever!) that my life would settle into
some sort of blissfull nonchalonte happy-go-lucky type of &quot;deep
healing of body and soul&quot;. HA! What was I thinking???  I know I'm not
the only one here whose life is a bit topsy-turvy and I can tell by
OG's lack of consistency with posting also....when will it all end???

OK, I'm done. I'll go take a valium and mellow out now. Tsk-tsk...

How are you feeling Cheeky? Feel free to email me if you want. I'd
have done so with this but I only have a few members addy's (to those
members/friends: I know I owe you an email, I'll update you all soon,
OK?).

I've actually missed you around here! You always had a couple of good
things to say here and there that would make me at least smile. I
think we need a little more &quot;sense of humor&quot; in here and hope that
keeps everyone from taking everything said so dang seriously. Don't
y'all think? Or don't you?

Until later,

Aloha Just For Now,
Hawaiian Wayne

I know the feeling but for me these days I'm the nutty guy who went skipping
down the road blissfully because I got care and now know what I really have.

Yeah I know that feeling too! I will never forget the day I got my &quot;award&quot;
and thought my problems were over and even posted &quot;I won&quot; but that was a
false sense for sure. Is it as bad as it used to be? Hell no but I still
have some battles and now it's getting the medical bills paid because the
doctors I see want nothing to do with insurance.

Wayne, I kinda gave up the Usenet groups (and a private one) after I posted
I finally had labs and met a doctor that changed my life. You know the old
saying you can lead a horse to water but can't make him drink. Now the more
I read daily on the things that cause &quot;FMS&quot; and think of what I used to be
like I stopped telling and just concentrate on me for the most part. Sad for
some but giggle at others now.

Am I still funny? More than ever now and many people including myself see a
different person.
I ran into my ex and oddly enough the hate tread was gone for both of us
and I explained the medical problem that helped cause us both problems. Now
I think of the day the medical problem is behind me and the possibility that
the both of us can be in each others lives.
