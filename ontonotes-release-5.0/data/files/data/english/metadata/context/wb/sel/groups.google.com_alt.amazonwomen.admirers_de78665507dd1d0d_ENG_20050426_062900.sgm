I read a little about Jeannie Laurer because the voice from the dark room
Hollywood said she was over the hill. She has a college degree in Spanish
Literature. That's not shabby. Many many FBBs aren't college graduates.
So she is in this movie documentary &quot; 101 Reasons Not To Be a Pro Wrestler
&quot;. So maybe that scene is bad but so is Bodybuilding. It's cardinally no
worse. Drugs ? They are everywhere in our society. I She was born in
1970 so she is only 35. Some people do age faster than others so maybe she
looks bad now. Many Hollywood actors and actresses lose their looks fast.
Some gain weight loose there looks and so on. Why pick on her ? As I said
she is educated and maybe famous but you could not tell it by talking to me.
I never even heard of her until Hollywood's post. You know the actress
Careen Allen she detonated gaining weight but she can change that. None of
us are going to get off this planet alive. So what's the big deal ?

2 reasons:
1. She appeared in the Surreal Life
2. She made a porn movie with her boyfriend Sean Waltman.
That's a good sign your career is going nowhere.

My question is: career as what? She isn't an actress, not a bodybuilder.
Although she was twice in Playboy because of being &quot;Chyna&quot; she isn't a
glamour girl. Notice that the Roc, who is much more successful in
wrestling, kept his association with the WWE and his stage name while trying
to create a movie career. And remember that other former WWE women like
Sable disappeared when they left.

For women like this, the WWE is a JOB, not a career.

Career as a celebrity. Back in her WWF days, she was popular enough to be
given guest star spots on a lot of tv shows, write books and be in one of
the best selling editions of Playboy ever.

The Rock was just more savvy. He didn't burn his bridges and if his movie
career doesn't pan out, he can always come back to the WWE where he will be
warmly welcomed by the fans.

Do you really think that somebody like Chyna ever had the same kind of
career opportunities as does the Roc? Remember, there are women IN action
movies but there are not, and never have been any female action movie stars.

you're something, Bill although I don't know what. You worship FBB who are
unknown to the world and often a flash in the pan. Yet you disparage
professional wrestlers their respect. Overall, wrestlers are far better
athletes than FBB. Yes the realm is seedy and hokey, but the athletic
demands are extremely high. WWE wrestlers work extremely hard to continue
their career, why is this any more a simple &quot;job&quot; than bodybuilding.

I can pretty much guarantee you that more people know who Chyna is than know
any number of pro FBB.

She forgot the power that Vince McMahon wields. Sable thought that her
popularity was due to her looks. She wanted more and when he found her
demands unreasonable, she told him off and decided that she didn't need him
anymore. Without the WWF's machine behind her, she soon faded to obscurity.

In Chyna's case, it was more complicated. At that time, she was dating HHH.
When they broke up, he started dating Stephanie McMahon. Having the boss's
ear he started wielding a lot more power backstage. Chyna was ousted and
without the help of the WWF PR machine, she too faded into obscurity. Her
latest career choices may have been motivated by desperation and lack of
money.

As for The Rock, it may simply be an example of double standards. Vince
McMahon treats women like dirt and feels betrayed when they want to leave
his organisation. When The Rock wanted to try an acting career, Vince
McMahon saw an opportunity to gain mainstream credibility. That's why Vince
promotes the hell out of The Rock's movies during RAW and Smackdown and why
he retains his stage name instead of being called Duane Johnson. Despite
being a billionaire, Vince McMahon still yearns for mainstream acceptance
and resents the stigma associated with wrestling.

None of your response makes any sense. I don't worship FBBs or disparage
wrestlers. Both bodybuilders AND wrestlers are generally pretty good
athletes. They both work hard. And who is more famous than whom frequently
doesn't mean anything in terms of real achievement. Look at Paris Hilton.

You challenged me to give examples of what's wrong with your thinking/logic.
Exhibit one is just above.

Angelina Jolie indeed has done some successful action movies. But she's
done a ton more non-action movies in addition. So that's two movies out of
20 or more. But I guess the Laura Croft movies are the nearest thing to an
exception to the rule.

Hallie Berry was unsuccessful as Cat Woman but I think they are spinning off
her James Bond secret agent character in another film. That could also be
an exception if it works.

No, I'm not. But even in Hong Kong martial arts movies the main lead is

Aside from romantic comedies, in the majority of movies the main lead is
rarely a woman.

But my point was that Michelle Yeoh and Ziyi Yang do mainly action movies
and are often the leads so that qualifies them for the name action movie
stars.

&gt;&gt; videos....

&gt; She forgot the power that Vince McMahon wields. Sable thought that her
&gt; popularity was due to her looks. She wanted more and when he found her
&gt; demands unreasonable, she told him off and decided that she didn't need
&gt; him
&gt; anymore. Without the WWF's machine behind her, she soon faded to
&gt; obscurity.

&gt; In Chyna's case, it was more complicated. At that time, she was dating
&gt; HHH.
&gt; When they broke up, he started dating Stephanie McMahon. Having the boss's
&gt; ear he started wielding a lot more power backstage. Chyna was ousted and
&gt; without the help of the WWF PR machine, she too faded into obscurity. Her
&gt; latest career choices may have been motivated by desperation and lack of
&gt; money.

&gt; As for The Rock, it may simply be an example of double standards. Vince
&gt; McMahon treats women like dirt and feels betrayed when they want to leave
&gt; his organisation. When The Rock wanted to try an acting career, Vince
&gt; McMahon saw an opportunity to gain mainstream credibility. That's why
&gt; Vince
&gt; promotes the hell out of The Rock's movies during RAW and Smackdown and
&gt; why
&gt; he retains his stage name instead of being called Duane Johnson. Despite
&gt; being a billionaire, Vince McMahon still yearns for mainstream acceptance
&gt; and resents the stigma associated with wrestling.

I can agree with your basement of her and that maybe in Howard Stern's eyes
she is a MAJOR fool. I don't think she needs the amount of abuse she is
getting but I know little about her. Maybe she deserves abuse. But you
originally blamed her decline on Steroids. That was ridiculous in my view.

Dobbins did not say that , you did. I know you are very anti steroids
It's your right to be. But every person who who workd out a real lot and
uses steroids is not all messed up from it. You make it seem as if they
are.

more Dobbins induced crap. The only thing I have said is that steroids are
dangerous and should not be used by healthy individuals because the medical
risks outweight the medical benefits. This is in direct response to

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I never even heard of her until Hollywood's post. You know the

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Careen Allen she detonated gaining weight but she can change that.
&gt;&gt;&gt; None

The &quot;accepted medical definition&quot; you refer to makes steroids illegal for

&gt;&gt; are
&gt;&gt;&gt; dangerous and should not be used by healthy individuals because the

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Dobbins did not say that , you did. I know you are very anti
steroids
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It's your right to be. But every person who who workd out a real lot

&quot;Ho&quot; now you are acting even more along the lines of Dobbin's rules of
debate. At least change the words a little so you can retain some shred of
respect.

If you two are going to remain a couple, someone is going to have to stop
taking the testosterone...
