REG has proposed and I have agreed that we will try to segregate our
Uploads this way:

RMU 1:  Opera Files only.

RMU 2:  Everything else.

If you are uncertain where something should go, flip a coin.

Incidentally, if you should get the urge to upload images that's what
the Pages are for. The procedure is about the same as for music
files.
But you must first &quot;create&quot; a page. It's easy.
