Bull passed away:(  I am sad about it, but he had a good life.  I got
him not long after I had first started working at the petstore, so I
think he was around 6, maybe 7 years old or so.  Considering his
probably genetics I think thats not to bad.  I think I am going to find
a new home for his mate, Natasha.

My female Characodon lateralis seems to have terminate her pregnancy:(
Rather than getting bigger she has gotten smaller, and I don't think
she had them.  Hopefully they will breed again.  Once I find a home for
Natasha I am going to lower the water temperature and that may
encourage breeding (they like slightly cooler water).

Sorry to hear about Bull.  Six years leaves an impression.

Thanks.  I was hoping to have him for longer, but all well.  He came
from a fishy farm that probably doesn't really breed for the best fish
genetically . . .

Odd timing. I just lost Pirate last week. Since she was the only fish in
that tank to show any odd symptoms I'm likely to write her off as another
casualty of fish dying. You know I've actully heard shop owners say that its
harmless. I kidna wish they were forced to label the tanks with a warning,
then after everybody sees their dyed fish dieing they wouldn't buy any more.

I think that if a fish is going to be dyed, then the all natural tie dye
method is the best.

Well, he never had any viable babies . . . so hopefully nothing, haha.
He certainly wasn't the best bred angelfish ever, nor the nicest
(temperment wise) but he was Bull.  Its odd not having him in my tank,
after always seeing his fishy face for the last 6ish years it just
doesn't seem right.

That is sad, Melissa.  It's really hard to lose a fish that's been a
pet for such a long time.

I was considering getting some baby angels, but they don't really mix
great with my livebearers, so I think I will not at the moment.  gaa .
. . I never, ever thought I would be choosing livebearers over
angelfish . . or any other fish for that matter.

I have been hinting to Julie that she should find a home for her
goldfish and hand the 56 gallon over to me  . . . since I care for it
anyway . . . if she ever does I may be visiting angelfish gardens.  As
much as I do like the goldies I am sick of their messiness.  I would
rather not have goldfish until we have a house and a pond, or tanks set
up on a drip system:)

Thanks dan.  I will admit I did get a little teary eyed when I found
him:(  I made Julie get him out of the tank, I just couldn't do it.  I
feel bad because I am wondering if the stress from me getting the A.
thomasi out had anything to do with it.

Melissa, sorry to hear about Bull.  Everytime  you have mentioned him
he sounds like such a character.  6 years is such a long time to have
a fish and grow attached.  You poor thing.  Really hope his mate is
doing ok too.

I keep meaning to post some pics of my angels.  You can see what
beautiful fish MG provides then.  I've only had them since June and
love them to bits.

Take care
Mellie

I guess Melissa's Bull and my Little Miss Sunshine will never meet.
Sunshine, a gorgeous koi angelfish that has killed every mate that I have
introduced her to, has been living peacefully in a 20H with a school of
Espei rasboras and corydoras. She's become quite personable, and doesn't
seem to mind living in exile. Until this morning, when I discovered she had
covered an entire Amazon sword leaf with hundreds of eggs. The eggs are all
white, because they weren't fertilized, but she is defending them from any
curious rasboras that wander past. I feel sorry for her. I have plans to try
her again with some of my black juveniles that are getting very close to
sexual maturity. In the past, besides killing her mates when they tried to
fertilize, she's also eaten all the eggs. This morning she is not eating,
she is protecting. Maybe she's learning?
