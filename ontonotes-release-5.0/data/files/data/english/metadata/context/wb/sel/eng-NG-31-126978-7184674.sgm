Heh. Rapid prototyping makes its way out of the laboratory and into the
real world.

The only problem with this is that for now it depends on two materials
that are potentially in short supply in the world at large, and the more
universally this technology is deployed, the greater the relative
scarcity of those materials.

It's interesting to compare one of the major differences between "modern
traditional construction" and "pretechnological construction". The
latter tends to rely almost exclusively on locally-available materials,
and housing in a region has an immediately observable effect on the
local environment. "Modern trad" construction tends to rely almost
exclusively on materials shipped in, and thus while it concentrates
environmental effects elsewhere -- potentially in rather remote and
simple ecologies which can have limited impact on other ecologies -- it
almost inevitably creates a clash of appearances between the local
environment and the imported materials. Further, there are the added
costs of refinement and of energy to transport the materials.

In some parts of the country, it may be quite possible to process local
materials to be used in the same way this robotic builder uses concrete
and gypsum. For example, in the American West, areas characterized by
low rainfall could see the substitution of concrete for variations on
adobe.

The article reminds me a little bit of the invention of Portland
Cement, the ideas they had for it were like that.

What you probably have coming up right here in the near future is
making everyone into trailer trash, just the industrial perfection of
manufactured homes. You don't buy it from a lot, you order exactly
what you want down to the last square foot of space and the factory
computers oblige. It'll be a house made of beams and two by fours just
like the regular kind, it doesn't depreciate like a mobile home.

There are actually very excellent prefab, which is not exactly the
same thing as that, but they are a preview. I have an acquaintance who
just built one. It's a million dollar home and on close examination it
looks exactly like the work of carpenters.

None of this will make buying it cheaper really, just takes the
building skills away from pros and puts it into computers. It just
keeps rolling on, fewer and fewer ways from competent human beings to
make a good living at a skill.

I hope not. The work of carpenters these days isn't very good. The
prefabs I see, which are built in "factories", are much better than
the normally built homes because quality control is better than at the
job site.

Except that competent human beings that have good skills have been
replaced most places by semi- or unskilled labor. The craftmanship
isn't there in most newer homes.

It's been years since I framed something, but at that time quality was
expected and recieved. That was the deal.

You could be right. This very person I mention who just put up a
million dollar home with prefab walls apparently had to fire a Mexican
crew, they were doing a half-ass job that had to be redone at expense,
and their go-between was stealing from the site. He did hire some
local pro carpenters and got it done nice. I imagine he learned
something about false economy.

Unfortunately the false economy doesn't extend to builders, who push
off the problems on the buyer.

Have you noticed that a 50% real decrease in wages in the building
industry over the last 15 years has not resulted in lower cost
housing, but just bigger profits for builders?

I've noticed that about every thing illegal labor touches. It's no
small reason that the employer-class of this country is so dead-set on
keeping these people pouring in here. When the Boomers and the
remaining middle class is completely tapped-out, so will this urgent
desire for imported domestic labor. The society is being slash &
burned.
