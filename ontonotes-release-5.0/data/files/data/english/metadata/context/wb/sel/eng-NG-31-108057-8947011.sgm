Wrong again!!!!!

It was Pong.  Nolan Bushnell saw the Magnavox Odyssey, and using a
technically different approach, he took the video ping pong game to the
arcade.

It was so peaceful around here, too.

Which begs the question, are there ANY collectors who do have a PDP1 in
their home now?  I actually was offered a free IBM System 3 once, but I
was living in an apartment at the time, so I had no choice but to
decline.  Even now, I'd prolly still decline that one.

closest for me was having a PDP 11/10 and a PDP 8/3.  Had 2 teletypes and

entering bootstrap code, one bit at a time to get it to read the paper tape

You can argue it out with KLOV.

&quot;Trivia
This game first appeared for the Vectrex home video game system
produced by CGE and Milton Bradley. This was the first home game to be
converted into a commercial arcade game. This was the last color
vector game released by Cinematronics, which was in Chapter 11
bankruptcy at the time.&quot;

Ralph Baer addressed the issue a long time ago, and basically, he didn't
feel any desire to pursue a lawsuit, but had he wanted to, he prolly
could have won.  Nolan Bushnell has acknowledged the same.  Atari was no
longer under the reigns of Bushnell when they filed against a Magnavox
that had long since severed ties with Baer.  Your arguing Apples and PCs

Are you referring to Bushnell with Pong or Baer with Odysssey?  In the
Odyssey case, the machine had no computer circuits of any kind, so there
was no way to toggle counters.

In Pong, there was scoring, so the above statement makes no sense.

Now in the above paragraph you say that Baer probably could have won...so
are you saying that Odyssey's Table Tennis and Pong are different enough
that they are not the same game?  So which is it?  You also never answered
if the name Pong was used anywhere on the original Odyssey and whether or
not the Odyssey version played, sounded and scored the same.
Fact is Cinematronics used the same name and it was a direct legally
licensed port.  Pong was not.

When it comes to lawsuits, nothing is definite until the suit is won.
And it was Baer and Bushnell who both said probably, so they have
effectively acknowledged the similarities, but no lawsuit was ever
filed, so it has not been proven conclusively.

As far as most people are thus concerned, they are the same.

Are you really that lame and ignorant?

First, look at both of these:

Odyssey:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnavox_Odyssey

Odyssey^2:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnavox_Odyssey_2

And finally, read this:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong

BTW: The patent infringement lawsuit referred to had to do with how the
game's video signal is relayed from the game console to the TV, not the
discussed &quot;look and feel&quot; infringement that Baer never pursued.

The original Odyssey predated the O^2 you keep harping on as having
almost all its games coded by one person.  The O^2 developers have
nothing to do with Ralph Baer, so get that erroneous bit of flim-flam
out of your dense skull.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And apparantly he could never figure out how to write a routine that

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; basic to me.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Are you referring to Bushnell with Pong or Baer with Odysssey?  In the
&gt; &gt; &gt; Odyssey case, the machine had no computer circuits of any kind, so there
&gt; &gt; &gt; was no way to toggle counters.

&gt; &gt; &gt; In Pong, there was scoring, so the above statement makes no sense.

&gt; &gt; &gt; But then, look who posted it.

&gt; &gt; &gt; jt

&gt; &gt; I don't know, but I heard that one man programmed all of the odyessy 2
&gt; &gt; game cartridges is all I'm saying.

&gt; Are you really that lame and ignorant?

&gt; First, look at both of these:

&gt; Odyssey: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnavox_Odyssey

&gt; Odyssey^2: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnavox_Odyssey_2

&gt; And finally, read this: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong

&gt; BTW: The patent infringement lawsuit referred to had to do with how the
&gt; game's video signal is relayed from the game console to the TV, not the
&gt; discussed &quot;look and feel&quot; infringement that Baer never pursued.

&gt; The original Odyssey predated the O^2 you keep harping on as having
&gt; almost all its games coded by one person.  The O^2 developers have
&gt; nothing to do with Ralph Baer, so get that erroneous bit of flim-flam
&gt; out of your dense skull.

Well, he already posted once since he posted he was out of here.  I'm
guessing that right now, he's lurking to see if anyone posts any form of
regret.  Eventually, he'll feel left out and try posting again.

Put me down for seven weeks.

THANK GOD!!! Good ridance!!!

Space Boss is the reason I rarely post anymore.  Been &quot;active&quot; in this
group on and off since 1995, but idiots like Space Boss have driven me
away.  On most postings he's replied to, he will put some completely
off-topic, made-up bullshit &quot;fact&quot; in a reply, and completely destroy a
thread.

To quote Smeagol/Gollum &quot;Go away, and never come back!&quot;

T. &quot;Will be back if the jackass Space Boss is really gone&quot; Rivet

That would be Nov 10.

I'll pick Columbus Day, October 12. I've been on usenet too long to give
him seven weeks. Three weeks feels about right. (We'll ignore his
&quot;really lastest last post for reals&quot; today. He actually has to stop
posting before he can start again.)

I almost said there weeks, but I felt a hunch that said he would
actually try to hold out.  But he won't make it to the two month point.

BTW:  He had stated at one time he left the Kiss newsgroup, but a recent
google groups search showed that he is still posting there.

OK, I'm in..

I'll say Oct 30th.  By then he'll have his halloween costume ready for
Trick-or-Treating, and will be just bursting to tell us how he's
dressing up as an Ewok.
