&quot;I rule CSS&quot;?
&quot;I attacked someone for posting a website?&quot;
&quot;I insult people for using smilies?&quot;

Could someone please explain what the feck is going on over there?

(And why I seem to be the one who's been singled out? Is it cos they think I
don't read it so I'm an easy target perhaps? Or just cos I refuse to post to
the forums so they'll never see any replies?)

And when do I &quot;fly off the handle&quot;? ON A REGULAR BASIS?
/me lands on the floor.... damn, that handle's slippery.

I still read it, but usually only one or two threads catch my eye these
days. When Gasman first set up his server, it looked amazingly busy and
lively compared to CSS, but - particularly in the games section - it
just seems to be the same stuff over and over. The techie bits are quite
good, but then there are good techie posts here. (And, before another
one-sided flamewar flares up either there or here - I'm *not* saying
it's rubbish; it's not. It's just not as good as I'd been led to
believe, and I still  prefer CSS on its good days.)

Spike... I said you can fly off the handle, in what was *meant* to be a
defence of CSS in response to some bloke who was *really* laying into
you. Maybe it didn't come out right. All I meant was that where some of
us might gently point out that a question has been asked 175,603 times
before and please check the FAQ in future if you'd be so kind, you tend
to go in with all guns blazing. Fair enough as far as I'm concerned,
this is Usenet and there are no moderators - it's what most of us
diehards like about it - but it does put some people off (as I said over
there, it would probably have put me off if I'd been on the receiving end).

I don't know where the stuff about smileys came from. I pointed out, in
a jocular fashion, that the animated GIF ones they use over there are a
pain in the arse, and that somehow mutated into you taking out contracts
on people who use them here, or something. I've been through the thread
two or three times trying to work out how that happened.

Tch, WOS, eh?

But I don't treat newbies like that.
I might be a little sarcastic, but the sarcasm dripping from this newsgroup
could butter all the butties in northern england, but I don't fly off the
handle at them unless they're clearly trolls.

(or daniel... he just really gets on my tits... I can't help myself... I
think he's a surrealist troll cos he rarely if ever makes any sense or posts
anything of relevance, and you can't use the language barrier as an excuse
now, he's been doing it for 2 years)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I don't know where the stuff about smileys came from.
">

Oh, I can guess.
Someone from here posted something over there about hating wos forums for a
number of reasons, one of which was graphically rendered and animated
smilies (which are stupid pointless fluff that distract from the written
message). You weren't the only one.

So of course, a moron might pick that up and run with it, extrapolating that
if animated gif smilies are hated in WOS, then all text rendered smilies
must be hated in CSS... Why such a hatred got attributed to me, though...
Pure WOS troll-and-fuckwittery is my guess.

They have the nerve to call us &quot;elitist&quot;. And yet they're the ones posting
all the anti-CSS threads. Hypocrisy, thy name is WOS.

And nick_h, IF you do happen to stumble by this, I stand by what I said. You
used to be a nice reasonable bloke but you did, IMO, turn nasty. I don't
care what &quot;good works&quot; you do. It's your behaviour/attitude here that
changed, quite suddenly. A few years ago. One minute everything's hunky
dory, then suddenly #speccy is crap and ruled with an iron fist by me.

Now it seems CSS is dying and it's crap and ruled with an iron fist by me.
(Hmmmm, what an odd little parallel, eh? Almost as if someone was reading
from a &quot;nick-h said this 4 years ago&quot; script.)

Seems to me everything you take a dislike to, you attempt to harm.
A rather odd and distinctly counterproductive attitude. Maybe you're just
bloated with an overinflated ego from all these &quot;good works&quot; and glowing
with an aura of self importance.

Who knows? Only thing I can think of to explain your &quot;CSS/#speccy are
crap/dying/ruled by me/ delete as applicable&quot; that you've spouted.

Indeed, that's why I posted here, see if I could get some insight from
someone who wasn't brain damaged but still posts there...

OK, it was a bad case of writers verbal diarrhoea, so I'll let you off the
&quot;very rarely on the handle&quot;ness of your WOS post... :)

Indeed. All the technical faults there are with it, and now the troll
problems too... and it's not even capable of crossposting so they can't use
that as an excuse.

Hmmn. Is this a continuation of the earlier WoS/CSS fisticuffs or is
this a new one? I've always found Spike's comments to be perfectly
reasonable. I find the level of profanity on WoS annoying. I think
it's just a culture clash. I think it's sad if it's descended to the
level of personal attacks on longstanding members of the speccy
community.

Owdo spike,

I think some of the confusion regarding CSS and smileys comes from the
Folklore Faq:

&quot;Smilies

You know, those side-on smiley faces (e.g. :-)). You don't need these on
comp.sys.sinclair. We're clued up enough to recognise irony, sarcasm,
humour, etc. when we see it. You'll just get flamed if you use smilies.&quot;

Of course, this isn't the case at all.  It's just been blown out of all
proportion.  Perhaps a winking smiley should be appended on to the end
of the above FAQ entry?

True... if anyone reads it, what I actually posted (under the title
&quot;WoS is (currently) better than css!&quot;) was that the AIOE NNTP server
was not accepting posts due to a balls-up in its config files
(probably still isn't, I haven't re-tested), while Google Groups was
stuck in a time-warp and was only showing posts up to 1994.  Although
I did end it in a joke &quot;flame&quot; which some seem to have taken
seriously. :p

Hence the parenthetical (LMLWD) &quot;currently&quot; in the title.  Google
Groups are now back to normal (?) as far as showing an actual group is
concerned, but still stuck in 1994 when &quot;Sort by date&quot; is selected...

To be fair, I think they have a point about the lack of fanfare here
over the Speccy's 25th anniversary, but then, so what? It was only a
day. It should have been mentioned (maybe it was; to be honest, I can't
remember), but what's the point of hundreds of posts making a fuss about
it? We celebrate every Sinclair machine every day.

Ditto the reaction to Rick Dickinson's Pandora and Loki photos. Rick
wasn't posting here, so any discussion about them would just have been
speculation. Any genuine information could have been gleaned from Rick
on WOS. Which isn't to say that WOS is &quot;better&quot;, just that that's where
he is.

&gt;&gt; &gt; I'd like to know who maintains both the FAQs, as I have website
&gt;&gt; &gt; addresses in them that are clearly wrong and have been for four
&gt;&gt; &gt; years or so.

&gt;&gt; No-one. It's been in a holding pattern for some time. In fact the
&gt;&gt; domain name was nearly lost earlier this year, although I think Philip
&gt;&gt; managed to save it.
&gt; Hmm, so when does this get sorted out?  What happened to Beth? (it was
&gt; Beth, wasn't it?), she just disappeared without warning.  Hope she's
&gt; ok.

She still pops into #speccy occasionally...
I'll mention it next time.

&gt; &gt;&gt; I still read it, but usually only one or two threads catch my eye these
&gt; &gt;&gt; days. When Gasman first set up his server, it looked amazingly busy and
&gt; &gt;&gt; lively compared to CSS, but - particularly in the games section - it
&gt; &gt;&gt; just seems to be the same stuff over and over. The techie bits are quite
&gt; &gt;&gt; good, but then there are good techie posts here. (And, before another
&gt; &gt;&gt; one-sided flamewar flares up either there or here - I'm *not* saying
&gt; &gt;&gt; it's rubbish; it's not. It's just not as good as I'd been led to
&gt; &gt;&gt; believe, and I still  prefer CSS on its good days.)

&gt; &gt; Agree 100%, and (for the benefit of those not reading WOS) I said the
&gt; &gt; same thing over there - the WOS Forums are actually quite dull.

&gt; &gt; I was going to post something to that effect in c.s.s. after reading
&gt; &gt; it for a few weeks but decided better of it.

&gt; &gt; Chris

&gt; I like reading both WoS and css. Does that make me a traitor? :)

&gt; Admittedly I post on WoS more but I do drop in here several times a week
&gt; to read the latest messages. I occasionally post messages too.
">

One way in which css is guaranteed better than WoS:  There's no
moderators. :-)

I post this because the original thread which sparked this one has
been locked as a flame war -- even though it isn't, at least not as
originally posted.  Oh the irony...

Indeed, and in this respect CSS is the superior medium.

Both WoS and CSS have their pros and cons, and I use both.  Admittedly,
lately it's been WoS predominantly, but that's because that's were most
of the activity has been.

I think it's daft to engage in this sort of flame-war.  Yes, I know, I
have helped to fan the flames, and as of now, I'll stop this sort of
shenanigans.  It's stoopid.

Have a good evening,

Daren

I have just developed an irrational disliking of forums after the
behaviour of a mod who deleted my posts without explanation. I hasten
to add that this was not on WoS, although I still find moderation
intrusive.

Erm, when I started it, it wasn't a flame war (the last sentence was a
joke)...

Still, at least I've helped flame the fans. :-) (oops, must stop using

I haven't posted for a good while and most of you may not remember me
because real life kept me from one of my favourite passions, the
Speccy -- still playing the games though
I'll come back to be a regular isooner rather than later. In the mean
time I lurk, but I really have to say something about this. I do not
want to miss the classic posters when I come back just because there's
a bunch of moaning sensitive posters that can't handle a bit of stick.

This shouldn't be being discussed because it's utter bóllocks. Spike
has indeed a strong personality and may be a lil harsh when he has a
go on somebody, but, come on, I'm bloody grateful for what he provided
me both here and in the irc channel. He had lots of patience with my
lack of understanding of the nuances of english, and he took the time
to explain me so many things. Didn't see any kind of iron fist
whatsoever, except the classical Lister slashing or the well deserved
&quot;where have you been&quot; when I was without logging in for a while, so
whoever attacked Spike should get over it and grow the fúck up.

So keep up the good stuff not only you Spike but all of you. You lot
are top blokes when it comes not only to the Speccy but discussion on
a forum. A grateful poster (now  lurker)

Cheers

Ivan

You guys should participate both in w.o.s. and here, like me. The way
I see it, both places are great. Occasionally someone will come here
or go over there, generalize and say 'they (everyone) is saying this
and that'. Are you that gullible to think that an entire community is
against you? Getting angry and maintaining a stand based on what
others say or because your ego says you have to do it, is childish in
my opinion. Both places have pros and cons . No one is trying to be
better. That's the way I see it.
