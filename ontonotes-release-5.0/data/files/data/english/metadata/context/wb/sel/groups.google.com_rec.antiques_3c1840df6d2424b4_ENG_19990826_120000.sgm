Hello!

Just wanted to thank everyone who has helped me figure out the company that
made my china: it was Nagoya N &amp; Co. Nippon.

Now, I am trying to find out what the pattern is. For those of you that
have the Collector's Encyclopedia by Van Patten (5th Series), my backstamp
is on pg. 127, and is #222.

Does anyone know if this company still exists, or anything about it, for
that matter? Also: part of the design on my dishes is duplicated in the
&quot;Argonne&quot; by Noritake (patented Aug. 2, 1921), but not all of it: the fancy
pattern around the edge of the plate isn't on mine. The pattern on my dishes
is in green, purple, and gold.

Any help/ info that anyone can give (or referrals to websites that might
help etc.) are very appreciated. Once again thanks to those who have helped
already!

Cheryl

optimism at this point. A lot of these old Japanese dinnerware patterns
didn't have names. Some had only numbers that have been lost in the
mists of time. Factories burn down (seems to happen a lot with potteries)
or shut down and old manufacturing records are discarded.

"/> If that is the case here, how do you find the pattern elsewhere (to buy
more: at this point it doesn't matter too much to me how much my pattern is
worth, just whether I can complete the set)? Is there any way to do this,
besides going into as many shops/ sites as I can and just looking?

I've been doing that, but that only place I found that has any listings by
the same company is EBay, and they had about 3 (not my pattern), I would
rather not purchase from an auction that I can't see in person, anyway.

Thanks!

"/> This is what replacement services are for, but I think you're going to
have a tough time with this manufacturer, as it is not one of the better
known ones.

I checked a Replacements index but couldn't find your manufacturer listed.

to buy without touching the merchandise, but if it's a reputable seller with
loads of good feedback, the risk is minimal.

Very true. Tiffany glass works burned to the ground and was re-built
three times, if memory serves correctly.

These kilns and furnaces reach temperatures in the thousands of degrees,
and there is enough heat released in them every day to heat a normal
house all winter. All it takes is a few minutes, the right
circumstances, and a night watchman who is away in another building for
an unstoppable fire get going.

In another neat example, a powder magazine caught fire in post WWI
america, and it took less than five minutes to completely erase the
entire building, without an explosion. The column of fire was seen
nearly 50 miles away. Even though there was nothing left of the
building but the cement slabs, the surrounding buildings were unharmed,
except for third degree sunburns- Blistered paint and charring, just
from the radiant heat from that flash.
