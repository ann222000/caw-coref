Is this what our boys are dying for, so that the Iraqi government can
award contracts in the hundred of millions to the Iranians and
Chinese?  The Iranians who are killing our troops in Iraq and building
nukes so that they now can build Power plants there.  and the Chinese
whom we have borrowed billions of dollars from to finance our military
occupation of Iraq so that they may get the contract themselves?
Jesus H. Christ one couldn't write a more bizzare script than this.
This War is nothing more than a God damn comedy of errors.  Would this
not be an excellent opportunity and guise for espionage activities
against us by both countries?

Mr. President,  WHAT THE HELL ARE WE DOING THERE?

What exactly is your goal?  and what happened to the Iraqi oil revenue
that was going to finance this?

Have we not enough problems at home?

Is a viable democracy in Iraq worth thousands more of our boys dead,
owing our asses off to the Chinese and the rest of the world, and an
exhausted disheveled military?

Ever heard of a Pyrrhic victory Mr. President?

Iraqi Contracts With Iran and China Concern US
By James Glanz
The New York Times

http://www.truthout.org/docs_2006/101807T.shtml

Thursday 18 October 2007

Baghdad, Iraq - Iraq has agreed to award $1.1 billion in contracts
to Iranian and Chinese companies to build a pair of enormous power
plants, the Iraqi electricity minister said Tuesday. Word of the
project prompted serious concerns among American military officials,
who fear that Iranian commercial investments can mask military
activities at a time of heightened tension with Iran.

The Iraqi electricity minister, Karim Wahid, said that the Iranian
project would be built in Sadr City, a Shiite enclave in Baghdad that
is controlled by followers of the anti-American cleric Moktada al-
Sadr. He added that Iran had also agreed to provide cheap electricity
from its own grid to southern Iraq, and to build a large power plant
essentially free of charge in an area between the two southern Shiite
holy cities of Karbala and Najaf.

The expansion of ties between Iraq and Iran comes as the United
States and Iran clash on nuclear issues and about what American
officials have repeatedly said is Iranian support for armed groups in
Iraq. American officials have charged that Iranians, through the
international military wing known as the Quds Force, are particularly
active in support of elite elements of the Mahdi Army, a militia
largely controlled by Mr. Sadr.

An American military official in Baghdad said that while he had no
specific knowledge of the power plant contracts, any expansion of
Iranian interests was a concern for the military here.

&quot;We are of course carefully watching Iran's overall presence here
in Iraq,&quot; the military official said. &quot;As you know, it's not always as
it appears. Their Quds Force routinely uses the cover of a business to
mask their real purpose as an intelligence operative.&quot;

&quot;This is a free marketplace, so there's not much we can do about
it,&quot; the official said.

At the same time, it is possible to view Iranian and Chinese
investment as giving those countries a stake in Iraqi stability. The
power plants could also boost a troubled reconstruction effort in
Iraq. An American Embassy spokesman said, &quot;We welcome any efforts to
help develop Iraq's energy infrastructure.&quot;

&quot;These proposals reflect the ongoing business opportunities that
are arising in Iraq that American firms should be competing for,&quot; said
the spokesman, who asked not to be named because of standard protocol
at the embassy.

It was unclear whether any American firms had tried to win the
work, although Mr. Wahid said the projects had been submitted for
bids. The embassy spokesman said, &quot;We are unaware of any violations of
principles of open and fair bidding.&quot;

The agreements between Iraq and Iran come after the American-led
reconstruction effort, which relied heavily on large American
contractors, has spent nearly $5 billion of United States taxpayer
money on Iraq's electricity grid. Aside from a few isolated bright
spots, there was little clear impact in a nation where in many places
electricity is still available only for a few hours each day. Because
the power plants are in largely Shiite-controlled areas, it is
possible they may not face the same sectarian violence that crippled
so many American rebuilding projects.

Mr. Wahid did not say how much the plant between Karbala and Najaf
would cost, but at standard international prices a plant of the scale
he described would be worth roughly $200 million to $300 million.

The outlines of all three agreements were confirmed by Thamir
Ghadban, an expert on energy who is also director of the committee of
advisers to Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki. But Mr. Ghadban said
that the granting of the huge projects to rivals of the United States
was not an indication that American companies were being excluded from
consideration now that Iraqi oil revenues, which provide the basis for
the Iraqi government's budget, are largely paying for the
reconstruction of the grid.

&quot;There is no preference to the Iranians,&quot; Mr. Ghadban said, citing
the most obvious potential point of sensitivity for the United States.
&quot;There is no opposition or stance from the Iraqi government to bar
American or Western companies. It is the other way around,&quot; Mr.
Ghadban said, indicating that he urged American contractors to bid for
work in Iraq.

Of the two new projects Iraq has agreed to finance, Mr. Wahid
said, the largest is a $940 million power plant in Wasit to be built
by a Chinese company, which he said was named Shanghai Heavy Industry.
That project would pump some 1,300 megawatts of electricity into the
Iraqi grid. For comparison, all of the plants currently connected to
Iraq's grid produce a total of roughly 5,000 megawatts.

He said that Iraq had already spent $12 million leveling the
ground in preparation for the Chinese plant. The Sadr City project,
which will include a small refinery, will cost $150 million and be
built by an Iranian company, Sunir, Mr. Wahid said. That plant is
expected to produce about 160 megawatts of electricity.

The Iraqi Electricity Ministry, which Mr. Wahid heads, is one of
the few in the central government that has received praise for
successfully spending much of the money allocated to it in the Iraqi
budget for reconstruction projects. Because of security problems, a
shortage of officials who are skilled at writing and executing
contracts, and endemic corruption, many of the ministries have either
left their rebuilding money unspent or poured it into projects that
have had a marginal impact on the quality of life for Iraqi citizens.

Asked how he had managed to make progress within the bureaucratic
morass of much of the Iraqi government, Mr. Wahid said he had simply
learned to go it alone. Aside from financing, his main need from the
central government was guarantees that Iraqi security forces would
protect his workers and the electricity infrastructure.

&quot;Do not annoy me,&quot; Mr. Wahid said was his main message to the
government. &quot;Let me do my work.&quot;

Whether officials outside his government will be entirely pleased
with the deals is a separate question. An international energy expert
involved in Iraq's electricity sector said he understood that the Sadr
City project had originally been an Iranian initiative and that the
Electricity Ministry had shown little interest at first.

The expert also said that the Iraqi Commission on Public
Integrity, which investigates corruption, had already signaled that it
would be investigating the project. Officials at the commission could
not be reached for comment on Wednesday evening.

Mr. Wahid said the new power plants were part of a sweeping plan
to increase electricity production on the grid, whose output has been
creeping upward in recent weeks. He said that the ministry was in
discussions on building another large power plant, one that would
produce 600 megawatts, within the city of Karbala.

And the minister said that the first installment of another
initiative he had long discussed, bringing diesel-powered generators
into selected Baghdad neighborhoods, was close to having an impact.

Some 14 of the generators, each expected to produce 1.75
megawatts, should be arriving in the capital within weeks, Mr. Wahid
said.

Yea lew, but China is taking over! Reckon why that is? &quot;China&quot; &quot;The
Good Samaritan&quot; is winning without taking a part in the activity's of
aggression ,Colonialism and or firing a shot. Goes to show you, Bush
doesn't understand the Christian principles that he claims to be a
patron to, ie &quot;Turn the other cheek&quot;. Seems Bushs Examples are working
on and or for the side of Beelzebub! America is suffering for one big
reason; reckon what that is lew? Historical evidence shows G W Bushs
approach has always commanded a failure in performance. Who's going to
bail his ass (Americas ass) out now? Who painted us it this tight ass
corner?

Peace,

Don't count on it, if Bush does as he wants and attacks Iran, (which
currently doesn't have adequate facilities to produce gasoline)  He
might just end up with oil contracts from Iran's oil patch, and you
never know.  I think it is shameful that anyone is making any profit
from the attack on the WTC. For King George to use troops to further
his personal wealth, or control of the price of oil and profit is
amazing, to the extreme,  That the American people have fallen for
it ??????????

i have been against this failed invasion from the first day and have
advocated pulling our troops out of Iraq . and according to the bush
supporters our troops are fighting for freedom of the Iraqi people
which would mean the freedom to chose who gets these contracts . so
which is it do you support the bush propaganda about invading Iraq to
&quot; free&quot; them or do you now admit we invaded Iraq for there oil and
wealth ?

Indeed you may have been against it from the start I'll take your word
on it.  I'm not all that concerned with going back and saying who was
right and who was wrong.  It wouldn't change a damn thing as far as
what has happened. My point was that you appear to delight in
saying,&quot;nanna nanna boo boo&quot; to Bush rather than show concern and
outrage that our young men are dying and leaving body parts behind for
this shit.  To me its time to rise above partisan sniping.  As far as
oil and wealth, what oil?  That's my point in another post, and what
wealth? We're going broke fighting.  You want to be ceded  the point
that the whole thing was a mistake, then fine if it makes you feel
better.  If you're going to begrudge and have contempt for those who
may be coming to the realization that Iraq was a mistake and that we
can be doing better things right now, then we will never unite as a
country.  It takes a certain level of maturity for people to extend
their hand and say welcome, now lets fix this.

Kind of like the $540,000 spent for each citizen of Hurricane Katrina
Flood area.

Know where the money went?

there is no &quot; FIX &quot; for what bush has done to Iraq ! all we can do is
pull our troops out and keep the rest of the region form interfering
in the civil war we started in Iraq . sooner or later the Iraqis will
decide on who and what form of government they want .
