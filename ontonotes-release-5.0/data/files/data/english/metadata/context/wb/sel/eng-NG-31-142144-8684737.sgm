Excellent, indeed. It seems to have left out, however, a pertinent
chunk of history. In 1831, the Khedive invaded and occupied Ottoman
Syria (i.e., the future area of British Palestine). In the course of
that venture, thousands of residents fled, and were replaced by
Egyptians. Moreover, a number of settlements were founded and
populated by Egyptians. In fact, at the time, Akko and Jaffa became
predominantly Egyptian cities.

Additionally, several earthquakes in the 19thC, along with locust
attacks and several severe droughts, served further to devatate the
region, contributing to further depopulation of the so-called
&quot;natives&quot;.

This is fucking OUTRAGEOUS.

If anybody else had been arrested while driving drunk, then violated
probation, then refused to enter diversion classes, then continued to
drive with a suspended license......what would have happened to that
person?

In this society, however, apparently, a rich skank ho can get away
with anything.

I read that the cunt's brother was mugged. Maybe we'll get lucky,
someone will mug the cunt, and maybe even ***eviscerate her guts*** at
the

&gt; There are people who die in jail from physical disorders due to neglect and

&gt; if he suddenly came into money. Hilton had no physical disorder that

On 27 April 1952 before I was born there was a Locust Plague that went
through the fields vineyards and roads of the Dan Region, Ramla, Lod
and Rehovat if you can find any of the Kibbutz members of Kibbutz
Sa'ad that were alive at the time they can confirm what I say here.

She is still not a bad person.  Just because someone goes to jail
doesn't mean they are a bad person it just means they made mistakes.
Sure Parris endangered peoples life's by driving drunk but alcoholism
is a disease and she seems to not be in the limelight for criminal
activity since her imprisonment.  I look at a bad person as someone
that wants to hurt another human being for no good reason.  Like those
niggers in Florida that beat up and mugged that 92 year old woman that
was walking to her apartment.  Also to me a bad person is someone that
demonstrates the behavior of Amalek that is described in the seven
remembrances in some Jewish Sidurrim.

Britney needs a wake up call.  Yesterday I had a physical with my
doctor and the first thing he asked me is what kinds of illegal drugs
do I take.  I told him &quot;None. I have enough problems trying to stay
alive on the medications I take much less to pollute myself further
with substances that diminish life instead of prolonging life.&quot;  My
physician said, &quot;I wish all people thought that way.&quot;  The thing that
irritates me is why do I have to be court order on medication for
fighting to defend myself when these Hollywood celebrates break the
law intentionally by taking illegal drugs and you don't read about
them being court ordered on medication.

being eviscerated.  You should know how easy it is to imitate someone
else's posts, you've had it done to you often enough.

You forged Deb on that post, and you know it, and the only reason you
did so was to justify how you support people being allowed to drive
while drunk and without a license.

Sorry, Palestinians, but &quot;revisionism&quot; and &quot;justice&quot; are not the
same.

I don't think the author mentioned this, but the Ottoman ruling family
actually had to populate what is now Israel by importing subjects from
other parts of the empire in the seventeenth century.  They wanted to
increase the tax receipts from that area.

It must have been one heck of a weedy, depopulated dump.

I wouldn't call her a dump, but the early zionsit of the last century
suffered from malaria that they were infected with while clearing the
swamps.  That the truth is told it took more sweat to settle Eretz
Israel than blood.

Only if you choose to ignore Arab blood. Quite a different story then.

It would be interesting to read about each village and see the history
be they Arab villages or Jew. There is one particular Arab village I'm
interested in because I saw the miracle of the Shekinah while camped
on a small hill next to the village.  The name of the village is
Taibiya.  It is just south of Tulkarem.

I was interested in Deir Yassin, but couldn't find it. Apparently the yids
destroyed it. Along with 450 other Palestinian villages. Charming people
these yids, wot?
