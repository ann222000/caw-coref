I have 4' chain link fencing around my yard.  I am not interested in
replacing the fencing at this time, and it would be a rather complicated
ordeal due to bushes and trees, not to mention pretty pricey.

Over the years, erosion, yard work by neighbors as well as ourselves,
etc, the bottom of the fence has been damaged or there is a gap under
much of it.  While it's handy for the bunnies to be able to escape the
yard since the bottom of the fence flexes (some locations more
significantly than others), it's not so handy that a certain young
Golden thinks he should follow them.

I have tent stakes pounded in on some sections, but they seem to get
loose over time, and due to trees and bushes, as well as the fence
itself, hammering them in is a difficult angle to achieve.  Also, some
of the gaps are more significant than others, and the tent stakes aren't
strong enough to bring the fence down to ground level.

I'm visualizing something not too ugly, semi-rigid, and maybe 6" high,
that I can attach to the fence poles and/or to the ground itself, and
perhaps wire/staple/tie the chain link fence to as well.  Depending on
how attractive it is, it may go on my side of the fence or a neighbor's
side.  So far, garden edging seems like it may be a possibility, but
most of it seems "finished" on one side only, and I'd like it to be
not-so-ugly from both my view and that of my neighbors.

Has anyone faced this issue and found a good product, or can anyone
think of something that may fit the bill?  Would a cable with
turnbuckles do it?  I wish I had a bottom rail on the fence, but that
isn't to be, so I'd appreciate any good ideas!

Before I get any stupid answers, I supervise the dogs, but have had to
tell Rudy NO - he may NOT go after the bunny/squirrel/bird/investigate
the whatever in the neighbor's yard.  When it's bedtime, the yard is
rather dark, and I'd like to know that I have a secure fence,
particularly when a petsitter is here instead of me.

This is totally lazy and will require regular maintenance,
but you can attach hardware cloth to your fence (some
overlap - say 3-6") and have it be long enough so that it's
about 6" longer than it takes to touch the ground.  Mount it
and bend it inside the fence and stake it to the ground.
That is to say, have it form an 'L' on the inside of your
fence.

Personally, I tend to prefer putting in the effort up front
and doing something durable, but as with so many things, it
depends on your priorities and resources.

I did this two. I attached the hardware cloth with hog rings, and bent it
over, and laid paving tiles over the hardware cloth. Grass now grows over
the paving tiles, and you can't see their are there, but it solved all
escape problems of dogs burrowing under. But the beagle still scales the
fence.

I thought of the approach you mention, and my concern is about the part
that extends on the ground - lawn mower incompatibility.

I would love to wave a magic wand and have an attractive wooden privacy
fence installed around the whole yard, but between costs and logistics,
I hate the thought of having to actually DO that!

Also, I think I'd have to install a taller fence that I'd prefer to,
because of the pool.  We're grandfathered in with this one.

Thanks for the thoughts!

With the low lying pavers holding down hardware cloth (tent stakes WERE
lawn mower incompatable!), we've never had an issue with the lawn mower.
Grass now covers the pavers  and you can't tell there is extra security

No - he's not a dasher or escaper, but he IS nosy and caught a bird last
week, by jamming his head and shoulders under the fence, so he's been
reinforced.

We're talking a LOT of gaps along a LOT of fenceline.  The one problem
area was caused when we tore out a very thick and unruly mock orange
that extended about 10'. The fence got somewhat damaged in the process.

Know any thorny things that grow fast and are very shade tolerant?

Hmm - I can't figure out how they attach at the posts.  I assumed
(wrongly?) that the had to be fit over the posts (which would mean
removing the fence, although I suppose we CAN detach the wire fencing,
do that, and attach it again).  I don't think we can get to some parts
of the fence, but I don't think they are problem areas either.

Most are not dense shade tolerant (like inside the woods), but will take
bright shade.  Rosa palustris and Rosa glauca will probably work.  If my
woods are any indication, wild blackberries and raspberries should be fine
as well.  Five leaf Aralia is shade tolerant and thorny and American Holly
has pokey leaves.

I can't remember what it is called, but I used a plastic fencing
material before to contain stray kittens I was raising to a dog kennel
at night.  It comes on a spool and it is a square patterned material
with about 1 inch squares.  I've used it outside and it holds up
fairly well outdoors, we used it as a cheap safety railing on a tree
house, lasted at least 5 years.  You could places sections of it in
the bad areas at the bottom and attach it however you feel like doing,
I zip tied it for the kittens.

They expand and slip around the post.

I.e., the same as with the top rail, if you want a bottom rail and not
just a wire.

Thank you.  This is probably the solution I really want, I just wasn't
sure how to do it!  This is the time of year to do it as well, before
the bushes start to leaf and flower.

Thanks.  The fence "hides" pretty well come summer, but the flaws are so
obvious in winter.  Not my first choice of fence, but with the pool

Your Home Depot or Lowe's guy can probably help you out, too.

Or, a fencing company might even come out and do it for you, amd maybe
even make additional repairs, if they're needed.

You might have to call more than one.  If you can catch one during the
slow season, they'll be more likely to take a small job.

Don't forget.  Home Depot and Lowe's install fencing, too.

I hate my chain link fence, but at the time when I put it up, I couldn't
afford anything else.  NONE of my neighbors would share the cost of
mutual sections (but they all put up fences right after I did--hrmph!).
Their loss, too, though, because I was going to put up nice wood if we
could have gotten a group thing going...  I would love to replace this,
but it's in perfect condition and I can't justify the expense.

I had a bottom rail put in with my fence.  I was just outside looking at
it and I think it could be put in after the fact.  Call a fencing
company--they might do it at a reasonable cost.  The sales guy will come
out and explain exactly how they would do it, so if you decide it's too
pricy, you'll at least have a few tips.

Subject: Chasing squirrels

I have not posted to the group for awhile but
want to share my success of teaching my dog
Sunshine, who has a very high prey drive, to
not go after squirrels when on a walk.  It
took a few trials but he can now walk right
past squirrels running up a tree or in a yard.

Using Jerry Howe's approach I used a sound to
get his attention when he saw a squirrel and
then praised him and kept on walking past the
squirrel. Where we live in Michigan we lots of
squirrels and he was always wanting to chase
them up a tree.  Jerry's approach of sound
and praise really works.

have never tried the method because it works
everytine.  Sometimes it takes a little practice
to get the sound from different directions but
I was able to change Sunshine's behavior in
just a week after we moved back to Michigan.

Sunshine is a very sensitive dog so any physical
corrections just won't work but using sound and
praise he is a really great dog who opens doors,
picks up things I drop, and and helps me a lot.

If you have a behavior problem with your dog get
a copy of Jerrry's manual and solve your problem!

Well, let me tell you, your Wits' End

My dog, Dasie, Loves to chase chameleons
around the barbecue on the patio. I
used this system on four different occasions.

When she went out today, she looked
everywhere else but the barbecue.
Amazing, just amazing.

I will write to Amanda about the video.

I am really excited to learn more, and
understand. Maybe just a little reassurance
that I am going about it the right way.

Thanks again

Hi folks,

In my opinion the use of a radioshock fence is a waste of
time, effort or money. I can understand it if you a rich snob
who cares nothing about their dogs safey or behaviours.

At work I boundary train all the dogs to the bricked area
(Four kennels with 26 cages with 1 dog in each, 1 services
building and 2 catterys which is surrounded by scrubland to
the east and woodlands to the north and a lake to the west).

This works well, because then when people buy them the dogs
are easier to boundary train to a door or fence or yard.

However on a personal note, my two shelter mutts, who I
trained using the WITS END DOG MANUAL available at
www.doggydoright.com will not go past the back door, or the
back gate or the front gate without permission.

And it is nice, for when you are having a party, you can leave
your gates open for people, and your dogs won't be the least
concerned.

I find this better then spending your well earned money on a
piece of junk Why not use it to invest in a horse? Or a new
house? Make a nice aquarium? Build a nursery for a child?

Save your money. Train your dog. Please. -- Thankyou,

Here some SUCCESS STORIES ive had using JERRY'S MANUAL

1) My dogz, two bitches - Vicious, barking, aggressive, pulled
on leash, wanted to kill any dogs they saw, fought between
each other. TWO WEEKS using Jerry's manual, they were calm,
friends, my companions.

2) ADDED A BEAGLE PUPPY (male) to my "PACK", the
girls had -NO PROBLEMS- with him from the moment I
dropped him by their noses.

3) My FRIENDS dogs  2 MALES barking and jumping
at the fence all night 3 DAYS TRAINING WITH JERRY'S
MANUAL they were CALMED AND HAVEN'T BARKED ONCE!

Added a NEW MALE DOG (2 yrs old) AND
WELCOMED HIM WITH NO WUCKAS !

4) POODLE that ATE food from the KITCHEN BENCH -
lock him in a box? NO! USE JERRYS MANUAL! 4 DAYS
AND HES NEVER DONE IT SINCE!

5) ABUSED DOGS AT THE SHELTER I WORK AT -
HAD TO BE FED WITH A BUCKET ON  A STICK -
ONE WEEK ON JERRYS MANUAL, THE SUPERVISOR
TOLD ME TO PUT THEM IN THE PUBLIC KENNELS
FOR SALE !

Quite amazing to - I thought they were just dull coloured
dogs, but after I had removed the fear and anxiety their
hairs coloured up amazingly.

6) STAFFY FEMALE who would NOT DROP HER
BALL! She carried it around all day and night - 3
DAYS on jerrys MANUAL and she now DROPS
it when u ASK her to!

I used nylon mesh (not screen, the heavier kind for critter
proofing) installed the way Melinda describes, with landscape
staples to hold it tight to the ground. It took two people about an
hour to install 200 running feet of it.

Just make sure, before installing, that you mow the grass really
close, so that you can get a nice, tight fit along the ground. It
was easy peasy to mow over. If you are concerned, put your mower on
a higher setting when doing the edges. I usually forgot, though, and
had no problems.

The grass grows up through the mesh, so the part on the ground is
invisible. The only place you could see it was where I attached it
to the fence--with zip ties, I might add. It worked beautifully.

Well, since the grass isn't actually growing yet, I don't think
pre-mowing will be required!

I'm going to look at laurel hedge, as I need stuff to replace where the

If you have friends, you can have it done pretty inexpensively.  It is
the labor that is expensive.  At my old house, all the guys who had
portions of fence got together and rebuilt the entire fence around our
properties.  It took a couple of weekends to do, but a lot of that was
waiting for concrete to dry before putting up boards.  I am having my
fence completely redone here at my current house.  I'm replacing
everything, including the posts, since it was put in a couple of decades
ago and when it was done the support framework was put too close to dirt
and rotted out too much to just do new boards.  A friend's husband and
some friends of his are doing it for me.  I am paying them, but not as
much as fencing companies with lots of overhead pay since they are fence
laborers who have the skills but not the overhead.  It is interesting
when you buy all the materials yourself to see how little of the quote is
for materials.

What's the pool issue?  Do you have a pool?  Around here, you can't have
a pool with chain link fencing or with other fencing that has gaps in it
that a kid could get through.  Even if your code doesn't require it, I'd
be really careful about fencing with pools.  I worked on lawsuits where
kids wandered into yards and drowned in pools.  It's the kind of thing
that the people involved never get over seeing.  The main reason I am
replacing all of my fencing is that even though I can repair it to the
inspector's satisfaction, I don't feel comfortable that there won't be
other weaknesses popping up where kids might find them before I do.

In this case, the labor would be challenging as well.  The original
owners gave no thought to tree placement (typical - people put in small
trees not thinking about them getting huge).

Back in 1982, we put in 100' feet of privacy fencing in a rowhouse yard
(40' deep, 20' wide).  OMG was it a challenge.  We rented a power auger
and we still wound up digging by shovel and post hole digger - we hit
ROCK an awful lot.  Putting the fence up was the easy part - the posts
were a bitch!  We also did it in March, in mud and wind.  Needless to
say, I think I'd choose May!

Here, we have roots of all sorts to contend with, plus a dog in the yard
behind us (we share that fence line and she is left out unattended all
day).

Still, I'm thinking of only doing one side, but have to look into the
zoning stuff.  I'd prefer to not have to do 6', but I think I'd have to
because of the pool.  Maybe 5' with lattice top would look less bulky.

Yes, we have an inground pool that was installed in 1973 but the
original owners of the house.  They put the fence in at that time (I
believe).  Current laws are for 6' fence if you have a pool.  The pool
is not separately fenced, nor do I want it to be.

As far as gaps, I guess if a 65# dog can push under the fence, a kid
could too.  The fence gaps are as much as 8" in some places,  0" in
others (but the fence flexes as much as a foot(?).

I like the garden fence option that I have started, but 4' is climbable
as well of course.  What isn't though?  There are several pools in the
neighborhood and most still have only a 4' fence around them.

I'd do six foot.  My old fence is five foot, with one side latticed topped.
The new six foot actually looks much sleeker.  Also, be sure to check the
code on what kind of lattice and other work is allowed.  Some friends had
to redo a whole section of new fence before they could put water in their
pool because it had something to the design that kids could possibly use to
climb it.  I am paying for my fence outright so that I can have all the
support 2x4's and hardware on the other side and just straight boards with
top rail on my side so there is no question of any climbing apparatus.  It
turns out at least 2 of my neighbors are using the money saved on not
sharing the cost of the fence they share with me to have the rest of their
fencing done by my friend's husband and his crew, who are charging him
closer to market rate (but still cheaper than guys with lots of overhead).
Since they are making money on side jobs they wouldn't get otherwise, they
are going to do all my landscaping for me after the pool guys get done with
the pool and concrete.

I have lots of overgrown trees along various sides of my yard, too.  The
worst is one neighbor's bamboo which some idiot before them decided to
plant right next to their side of the fence.  I can't grow grass anywhere
near my side of that fence area because the roots are so invasive.  It
caused some problems with post digging, but my guys were able to work
around it.   They had to cut back lots of tree brances all along the fence
line to be able to put up fencing.  What did they do when they had to put
in the support posts for the chain link you have now?  You should be able
to piggyback on that for the most part.

We have kids and dogs in several neighboring yards, so coordinating when
fencing would be down where has been a pain, but doable.  I had them stop
going the direction they were going and start on the other side after this
past week.  The pool guys got the rebar in and then had to wait for
inspection before putting in the gunite.  I don't want the fence down where
there are kids or dogs when the pool is in the rebar stage, so they had to
skip around to the retired couple on the other side of the house (would
have been last of all in the original plan).  Inelegant, but I care a lot
about safety issues.

I am getting sick and tired of living with dogs who are all pissy about not
getting to go out and supervise the strangers digging up their yard and
having to be on leash even for potty breaks most of the time.  It gives a
whole new perspective on the people who wonder why their dogs are such
pains in the patoot to live with even though the dogs don't get enough
exercise, etc.  Mimi got a Nintendo DS and a Nintendogs game for her
birthday from Grandpa.  My new advice to people is to get those dogs if
they really want easy care dogs.  I am thinking of trading mine in!  Of
course, once the fencing is done and the pool is in and life is back to
normal, I'm sure I'll be glad I went with real live dogs.  If we all live
to see that day! :)

In all honesty, I'd worry less about a four footer than a six footer with
gaps.  It is really easy for kids to push through where the dogs can.
Also, they can climb chain link because they can get footholds.  That's
why chain link of any height is not allowed as pool fencing around here
any more.  If you can't afford to do a better fence all around the
property, a garden fence that would keep kids from wandering onto your
property and into your pool would be a good option.  Even if they can
climb four feet, if it takes a while and some major effort, you are that
much safer.  There are also nets you can put over the pool, but they are
pretty ugly. I thought about putting short wrought iron just around the
pool since that is a lot less fencing than redoing my whole property
line, but decided against.  I would need to redo so much of the fence
anyway over time that it was easier to just do it all now.  Then I found
out I had access to fence savvy cheap labor and the rest is dog-torturing
history.  It's so pretty, though, even before painting or finishing, that
a guy from a couple blocks down stopped and asked my fence guys to give
him an estimate on doing his fence.  It's a very cheap design, but clean
long lines that look really nice and give good privacy, even from the
kids who got one of those swingsets with a clubhouse thing at the top of
the slide for Christmas.
