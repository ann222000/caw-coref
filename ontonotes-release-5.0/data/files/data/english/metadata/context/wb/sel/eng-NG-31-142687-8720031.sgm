News article from The (Portland) Oregonian - September 5, 2007

In the wake of Sen. Larry Craig's swift downfall, Sen. Gordon Smith says
he is ready to be the new go-to guy in the U.S. Senate for timber and
other Northwest natural-resource industries.

Smith, R-Ore., said he feels &quot;very keenly the responsibility&quot; to help
not only loggers, but ranchers, farmers and miners. &quot;My plate just got
bigger,&quot; Smith said in a telephone interview Tuesday, &quot;and I will work
day and night for rural folks.&quot;

Craig was convicted of disorderly conduct and said last week that he
would resign at the end of this month. On Tuesday, the Idaho
Republican's spokesman cast doubt on the certainty of his resignation.
But even if Craig remains in office, he has been stripped of his
committee assignments and virtually all his clout.

In the Senate, Craig has been known as a legislative tactician who
fought to increase timber harvests, limit fish protection and block
several wilderness proposals.

&quot;It will be a big loss,&quot; said Tim Wigley, who frequently represents
timber clients as the head of the Washington, D.C., office of Pac/West
Communications, a Wilsonville-based consulting firm. &quot;I certainly hope
that Senator Smith . . . will be stepping up and playing a larger role
on the issues of forestry.&quot;

Environmentalists who have long tangled with Craig say they are not sure
anyone will bring his clout and expertise to these issues.

&quot;If I was the industry, I would be very nervous,&quot; said Steve Pedery of
Oregon Wild. &quot;He was one of the last of the unreformed timber guys.&quot;

Craig recently blocked an Idaho wilderness proposal pushed through the
House by a fellow Idaho Republican, Rep. Mike Simpson. He also bottled
up a bill to protect the headwaters of the Snake River in Wyoming.

Recently, Craig inserted language in an Interior Department bill that
seeks to prevent a federal judge in Portland from requiring tougher
salmon protection measures on the upper Snake River.

&quot;Since Slade Gorton (of Washington) left the Senate six or seven years
ago, Larry Craig has been the most consistent and most effective
anti-salmon legislator in the Senate, and nobody else has even come
close,&quot; said Pat Ford, executive director of the Save Our Wild Salmon
Coalition.

Chris West, vice president of the American Forest Resource Council, a
timber industry trade group based in Portland, said Craig's power
already was diminished by last year's Democratic takeover of the Senate.

For that reason, West said it is unrealistic to expect too much from
Smith, also serving in the minority. West said he is reaching out to
Democrats such as Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden, who chairs a forestry
subcommittee.

But Smith said he is gaining in seniority and now serves on the Senate
Finance Committee, which gives him the leverage to gain help from
colleagues on natural resource issues. Smith is also now the only
Northwest Republican on the forestry subcommittee.

Observers on both sides of the environmental divide in the Northwest
said they expect Smith to tread more carefully on these issues than
Craig did. Craig's troubles give Smith a higher profile as a defender of
the natural-resource industries that are a mainstay of the Republican
base in Oregon as he gears up to run for re-election. But he also has to
avoid alienating environmentally minded voters in urban areas, noted Ray
Wilkeson of the Oregon Forest Industries Council.

&quot;Collectively, the people of Oregon view these things differently than
do the people of Idaho,&quot; said Wilkeson, adding that he understands why
Smith is supporting a Mount Hood wilderness bill opposed by the timber
industry.

While Smith was cautious in an interview about endorsing Craig's
positions on specific issues, he made it clear he intends to
rhetorically champion the natural-resource industries he says are key to
the state's economic health, particularly in rural areas.

&quot;I do my best to represent Oregonians' interests as broadly as possible,
but I start from a rural place -- Pendleton, Oregon,&quot; said Smith. &quot;I'm
going to stick with those who are my neighbors.&quot;

At least he's being open about it.  That's more than we can say for other
Republicans.  They try to hide their graft and corruption.  Smith isn't
trying to hide the &quot;For Sale&quot; sign.

Congress is continuing a jackass tit-for-tat purge that won't help
anybody. Having failed to effect any major changes either against the
President or disrupt either parties' stance dramatically in Congress
they target becomes devouring the old men with committee duties and
strength.

Rather than strengthen anybody, it will likely lead to a REPUBLICAN
victory in the White House.

How do you convince anybody you are better this way?

When do I find a Democrat that I myself as a Democrat with independent
leanings (voting a party ticket is immoral, you vote for the ones that
you think can do the job) can feel good about?

Hint: I don't think I like anybody for president. I get sick trying to
figure it out. Maybe the stupid debates should end and the jackass
campaigning really begin.

Of course it couldn't be that he really believes that farmers should
have a right to farm, miners to mine, etc. now could it?

Smith is from the rural economy, a place where people tend to have a
different mindset than those in the city who often seem to think that
food grows on supermarket shelves and that the wood in their homes
grew in the lumber yard.

Dude - you would *so* love the article I just got commissioned to write.
Entropy - The Prime Dimension.

I can't say much about it, because it's proprietary stuff, but the jist
is that while energy tends toward entropy, entropy tends toward vacuum -
which is energy.

At one point, the researcher posits that for the origin question &quot;what
banged&quot;, the answer is &quot;entropy&quot;.

So... nature could no more exist without vacuum than good could exist
without evil.
