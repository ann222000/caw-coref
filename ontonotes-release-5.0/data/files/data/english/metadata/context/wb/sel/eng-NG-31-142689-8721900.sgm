Fast food giant McDonald's has been fined £13,500 after a metal bolt was
found in a snack at a West Midlands shopping centre.
A customer chewed on the bolt, which was in a sausage and egg McMuffin, at
the outlet in Merry Hill in June 2006.

The company pleaded guilty at Dudley Magistrates' Court on Thursday to a
charge of producing food which did not meet required standards.

The court heard bolts were missing from a kitchen grill.

The bolt was probably the most nourishing part of the 'meal'.

Hmmm....McDonalds...the professional Victim's punchbag. Yes, the food tastes
like cardboard and the outlets are a blot on the landscape, but they're not
the villians that they're painted to be.

Mcdonalds food must be amongst the most standardised in the world, generally
you get what you get, no matter where. The standards of  food hygiene and
preperation, again are very high, but, Mcdonalds, like the former British
owned company Burger King, are ran on the basis of franchises. The best
quality control can sometimes result in failures.

If you are going out onto the high street to eat fast food, food from
Mcdonalds is certainly amongst the least likely to contain foreign objects.

Of course, you dont like Americans, and Mcdonalds, as an American company
repulses you.

I haven't had a Mickey-D burger since the last time I played golf on a
military golf course (as a guest) years ago. I was running very late for a
tee-time.

They always seemed like meat flavoring juice sprinkled on hard pressed
darkened paper, with lettuce and Mickey-D's patented paste on as a topping.
Even the cheese on the chesse burgers tasted like paste to me. I doubt any
of it it what it's supposed to be.

I think I understand what you're saying, but those who 'run' things, are
enbaled to do so by the goodwill of the general populace. The populace are
at liberty to remove that goodwill any time they chose. And when enough
people decide they are no longer going to recognise the authority of law,
little or nothing can be done about it. The rule of law becomes irrelevant.

So it is by a consensus of acceptance that we are ruled. This has always
been the case and probably always will be. So, in effect, we are always free
.. to accept the tyrant or reject the tyrant

Freedom and democracy are not a natural state of man, past present or the
future. In the early and mid 20th Century we have faced two related but
seperate totalitarian forces hell bent on global domination and a
willingness to use miltiary force to accomplish it.

It was America, an imperfect ideal, that prevented both.

So what?. Like I stated, things of this nature can not be maintained without
the goodwill of the populace. In so far as they are, at the very least,
tacitly accepting subserviance, they are free. If they chose at any time, on
masse, to change the government, what is the government going to do about
it?

If we take one of the examples I believe you're referring to, Nazi Germany,
Nazism didn't meet much resistance amongst the native German populace.. A
lot of them saw it as a golden age, saw it as right, chose it. And the
empire spread, and like all empires, eventually it was rejected.. At all
points during that expansion, Europe was always free to reject it, military
force or not. The consequences of both options are not good but with every
choice comes consequence.. but it's still a choice

You can't rule people who think you're a cunt .. not for long.. ok, Blair's
managed it but the English are going through a particularly 'wet' phase
