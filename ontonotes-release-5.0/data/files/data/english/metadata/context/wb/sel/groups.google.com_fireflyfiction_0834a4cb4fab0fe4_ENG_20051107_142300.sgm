See part 0 for header information.

River sombrely let Zoe take her by the hand and wrapped her fingers around the
older woman's smooth brown arm as she drew her in. Her body language completed
its transition back to what passed for her sort of normal. Her eyes crept back
to the startled and mayhap somewhat stricken Badger, and she told him
seriously, &quot;It was only a game. You really should go now... But it's all right,
I already know you won't.&quot; Her eyes lifted and her head rolled back, body
arching, nose pointing up to the darkened sky. &quot;They're coming.&quot;

&quot;Oh, crap,&quot; said Wash, starting to look around intently.

&quot;Who's coming?&quot; Mal demanded. &quot;Alliance? River, are the feds coming?&quot; He
scowled at the shadows, drawing his gun.

&quot;Doesn't matter,&quot; she said. &quot;Too late.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; asked Badger, thoroughly lost.

&quot;Jayne,&quot; Zoe barked. He had the gun drawn from his boot in one hand, and... Mal
didn't even know where he'd had hidden the smaller pistol he tossed into her
waiting hands. She caught it easily as the shadows surged and sprouted men.

&quot;Zoe... Wash!&quot; Mal started to swear and realised there was no time; dragged
Kaylee from Wash's arm instead. &quot;You both go! Take her - &quot; He pointed them at
River. Kaylee couldn't stay upright, let alone run. He tried to angle his own
body to protect her. Zoe, Wash and River were already in flight down the
street.

&quot;Captain - &quot; Jayne was reaching with his empty arm, and Mal handed Kaylee over
to his care.

Badger's men had drawn their weapons, but it seemed they weren't so sure
whether they'd be firing them. The sight of Alliance uniforms maybe fazed them
a mite. &quot;What's going on?&quot; Badger yelped. He recoiled, doused with blood as the
first shots cut down an undecided henchman. That at least seemed to decide the
other fairly firmly. Badger raised a red-spattered hand and stared at it, then
furiously across at Mal. Swearing, he ducked to retrieve the dead man's gun and
danced back to join them in the negligible cover of a nearby wall. &quot;You brought *
Alliance* trouble down on us?&quot;

&quot;No.&quot; The proximity of a shot passing close by his ear made his own decision to
shoot to kill. Lawmen and the middle of a street on gorram Persephone be
damned. &quot;You did that yourself when you took that girl off my ship.&quot;

&quot;Tol' you,&quot; Jayne grumbled from further down the wall. A shot sent chips of
brick flying and drew a frightened noise from Kaylee.

&quot;They're after the *girl*?&quot; Badger swore at length.

&quot;Never goes smooth,&quot; Mal murmured to himself, and snatched a glance across to
the alley where Zoe and Wash had taken River. Needed to keep the feds from
following after them, he figured. At the same time, he couldn't afford to go
after them back to *Serenity* until he could be sure they'd lost all pursuit.
There was still a chance she'd only been spotted out in the town and nobody
could trace her back to the ship. And if that was true, they might make it out
of this intact. Long as they didn't shed no blood to leave their DNA behind, it
was too dark for the rest of them to have been readily identified. Though he
might have to add Jayne to the list of crew confined to ship on planets with a
big Alliance contingent. Badger... well, Badger was his own lookout.

He fired at a grey uniform across the street and then jerked his head up as a
scream rent the air. It was a sound not quite sane - not the sharp, scared note
of someone caught by horror or surprise, but a song that lifted and fell,
faltered and broke.

&quot;River - &quot;

He came up shooting; tried to get out of cover and across the unprotected,
too-wide street to follow Wash and Zoe. A hail of fire sent him crouching back
down again. The guns the Alliance boys carried were hell of a lost faster and
sharper than his own battered pistol. He was aware of Jayne similarly pinned
down, Kaylee tucked behind him and trying to make herself real small.

Was too busy ducking to see all of what happened then. Was only aware of a
sharp motion from Badger - another signal, directed to his remaining man - and
then the henchman was laying down covering fire with a fancy powered rifle, and
Badger was across the street, snatching the chance to direct a few ill-aimed
shots back at the feds before he disappeared. Mal stood up and tried once more
to follow, but there was a choked sound as the henchman took a laser shot
through the throat, which left him three feet out of cover and scrambling back
for his own safety in another hail of fire.

***

River's scream started the moment before a half-dozen feds sprouted from the
shadows in front of them, and kept on going after. She wasn't looking at the
feds - her gaze crawled around like it was the air itself telling her what was
worth screaming about.

&quot;This way!&quot; Wash grabbed her shoulders and tugged her back the way they'd come,
where another narrow street branched off. It floated banners and illuminated
signs in Chinese down its length; voices and music spilled out to it from a
pool hall and bar. Zoe followed, incongruous in her green dress as she laid
down covering fire with the borrowed gun.

A couple of vagrants were staring. Wash finally stopped River's screams by
planting his sweating palm over her mouth. Behind them, his wife cast her eye
over the bar and the stores that were open, and shook her head very slightly.
&quot;We stand out too well right now to blend into the crowd, and this town, they'd
as likely side with the Alliance. Just keep running.&quot;

&quot;Nobody wants any trouble...&quot; Wash murmured, and swore as he tried to guide the
struggling girl down a quieter street and almost sent them down a dead end.
&quot;Why don't you lead?&quot; he suggested, frustrated, pushing River ahead.

She faltered. &quot;Can't see. Can't see - &quot; Her hands raised, spread fingers
webbing to veil her eyes.

&quot;*Ai ya*!&quot; He grabbed her hand again and tugged her onward, but the girl moved
like her limbs were weighted with lead. They were headed into one of those
parts of the town that only really came alive at night, and it was just
starting to do just that. A shot skimmed past as they rounded a corner, turning
a bystander's face into a mass of red. &quot;Jesus - !&quot; Wash craned his head wildly
back over his shoulder to Zoe. &quot;No!&quot;

She lay on her back not six feet behind, the green dress draped 'round her
fallen form like she'd been artfully arranged there.

River, under his arm, said, &quot;She's not dead. That one took the death for her.&quot;
Gazing forward toward the man with no face left.

Unheeding of the sounds of gunfire still going on, somewhere, Wash was by his
wife's side and couldn't remember the steps in between. She had a bullet graze
on the side of her head, but he couldn't find anything else, and she was alive
- thank God, she was alive... How long she'd stay that way was looking the more
troublesome part. He felt panic threatening to sweep him up, but River was
behind him and Zoe's gun was lying by her outstretched hand. He picked it
up.

Raising his head, still crouched down, he realised all the shooting wasn't just
the feds in pursuit. They were nearer now, but they weren't even faced his way.
Instead they were returning fire at someone behind them. Relief overtook him,
and he aimed and pulled the trigger and watched the nearest figure fall with a
certain detachment. He'd killed men before, on Niska's skyplex, armed with as
much anger as he had now. The rest of the Alliance men took cover, under attack
from two directions.

Wash glanced to the side distractedly as he saw River move. She had crawled to
the corpse of the man he'd shot, and she traced her fingers over the dead face.
The sight prompted a sickness in his stomach he really wasn't needing, on top
of everything else. She didn't close the dead man's eyes. Wash fired again and
the gun clicked hollowly. &quot;River,&quot; he hissed, keeping hold of the weapon as if
it wasn't empty, though he crouched down further. &quot;River... his gun...&quot; He
reached an empty hand toward her, nodding encouragingly. The dead man's weapon
lay inches from her fingers.

She blinked back at him. &quot;No touching.&quot;

He could have strangled Mal. &quot;That's not... captain wouldn't... Throw me the
damn gun!&quot;

She tipped her head and arched it slowly on her neck. &quot;Cavalry's here,&quot; she
said, with an odd smile.

He followed her gaze. Expecting to see Mal or Jayne or both, he was astounded
by the sight of Badger toting his henchman's laser rifle with a certain
enthusiastic ineptness.

&quot;Trying to impress a girl,&quot; River explained seriously.

Wash gaped at her, and didn't realise he'd lowered his gun hand 'til a fed
rifle clicked its threatening song a few feet away. He let the weapon fall from
his fingers and raised both hands, standing carefully. &quot;I'm unarmed!&quot; He tried
to avoid looking down at Zoe, hoping they'd figure her for dead. She'd have a
better chance that way, from what they'd seen of the people who were hunting
River.

A pair of handcuffs was snapped around his wrists, but their concentration
focused mostly on River. She wasn't currently doing anything much, but there
was a firearm inches from her fingers and maybe they had an inkling what she
was supposed to be capable of doing with it. She stared around at them with her
mouth hanging open until they'd crept close enough to haul her up and away from
the gun. She started struggling as soon as they touched her. They weren't
gentle trying to restraining her.

&quot;Hey, you don't - &quot; Wash began.

&quot;Get off her,&quot; a voice snarled. One of the men holding the girl fell as a shot
sounded. The other dragged her body out in front of his own.

Wash winced. Badger had emerged from cover and was levelling his gun at the
remaining feds, but even Wash could see there were too many. Even if Badger's
chief asset was always bluster, it wasn't going to work here.

&quot;Shoot him - &quot; began the one with lieutenant's markings, impatiently.

Almost the same instant, River cried out, in that bubbling voice and her odd
facsimile of Badger's accent, &quot;Simon! I knew you'd come for me!&quot;

&quot;Eh?&quot; said Badger, which expressed Wash's thoughts fairly adequately, too.

The Alliance men exchanged glances. &quot;The brother,&quot; the lieutenant said,
nodding. &quot;We take him alive if we can.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; Badger gave a nervous laugh, and his eyes shifted 'round as if
registering the specifics of his situation for the first time. He visibly
counted the number of fed rifles pointed his way, gauging his very small
chances. The gun fell from his own hands as he raised them. &quot;I give up.&quot; He
grimaced. &quot;I... ah, I reckon what we have here might be a bit of a
misunderstanding, people,&quot; he tried. &quot;See, I really don't know these-&quot;

&quot;*Simon*,&quot; River chided with a smile.

His head jerked around frantically as a fed handcuffed him, coming finally back
around to the girl. &quot;This is a joke, right? Tell them-&quot;

&quot;I'd shut up now, Simon, if I were you,&quot; Wash said, nodding seriously and
trying to catch the man's eye. Badger wasn't completely stupid. He gaped a
moment, then subsided.

The sound of more shots being fired echoed from the direction they'd come. Mal
and Jayne, Wash thought - hoped. But the Alliance lieutenant frowned nervously
back that way, and made a quick survey of his depleted men before giving the
order to pull out. &quot;Bring them. It's important we secure the prisoners. If the
clean-up team don't pull the rest in... well, they'll tell us who helped them
sooner or later.&quot;

Wash carefully didn't look back toward Zoe, lying with the dead in the emptied
street, as they were hustled away.

***

By the neon glow of Persephone's night, they could still see the feds making
themselves scarce in the distance as they broke through into the street where
all the shooting had been. Mal gunned down the last man of their own pursuit
with his last bullet. He swore as he clicked open his gun to glare at its empty
chambers, then stared grimly after the retreating feds and the familiar figures
they were manhandling away.

&quot;I'm all out,&quot; he said.

Jayne was low himself. He took in the mess of the street around them, three
Alliance corpses and one dead bystander, and... &quot;Oh, hey, Mal - Zoe.&quot; He
scrambled over to her, not so quick as the captain, who it happened didn't have
a Kaylee hanging around his waist.

&quot;She's alive,&quot; Mal said, even as he took his hand from her neck and moved to
the side of an Alliance man who assuredly wasn't. He ignored a discarded laser
rifle in favour of a pistol still holstered at the fed's belt. Mal's eyes fixed
again the distant figures almost out of view, drifted to Kaylee and Zoe, and
then Jayne. &quot;Jayne - you follow them. Don't be seen. I want to know where
they're taken. Soon as you know, you come back to *Serenity* - but take care,
seeing as we don't know for sure if they know about her. And don't you get
followed back either, case they don't.&quot; He jammed the Alliance man's gun
through his belt.

&quot;Right.&quot; Jayne nodded, taking note which way the feds turned even while he
unfurled Kaylee, depositing her on the ground by Zoe's still form. Girl was
looking green, as much from all the drink as from all the death. No sooner
she'd touched down then she emptied her stomach on the pavement. He nodded
approval same time as wrinkling his nose - least she might be able to walk a
bit better, now she'd rid herself of some of it. Though Inara wasn't going to
be too happy 'bout the dress. &quot;You'll be all right with these two? Feds'll be
back, and likely more of 'em.&quot;

&quot;I'll manage.&quot; Mal had already gathered Zoe into his arms, no small feat given
Zoe was damn near as tall as he was and not exactly a lightweight. He strained
visibly, straightening, and distractedly said to Kaylee, staggering two steps
to butt her shoulder with his knee, &quot;C'mon, girl. You gotta walk: can't pick
you up as well. But hang onto me and we'll get there.&quot; The words stirred her to
sluggish action, her fingers clawing handfuls of his pants as she practically
climbed his body to get herself upright.

Mal looked back to Jayne, and past him to where the feds and their prisoners
could no longer be seen. &quot;Go.&quot;

***

_Chapter 3_

&quot;With respect, sir - to hell with the head wound. We need to be looking at how
we're going to get my husband back.&quot;

&quot;Zoe, stay down, gorramit! Doc needs to check you out first. And doctor - I
understand you're feeling a mite restless as well, but at the moment what we
need to know is if Zoe's gonna be all right.&quot; Mal's hand pressed her back into
the infirmary chair. He caught Simon's shoulders, firmly guiding him around and
setting him in front of the chair. &quot;Right now, might as well relax and get
doctored. Can't do anything 'til Jayne gets back... *assuming* he hasn't gone
and gotten himself caught, too.&quot;

Zoe had woken up as they approached Eavesdown Docks to find Mal hauling her and
Kaylee back to *Serenity* like so much baggage and her husband nowhere in
sight. They'd come back into the ship, Mal waving some Alliance toy pistol
around, to find Simon in a flat panic and fixing to do Jayne some serious harm.
Mostly, though, Zoe's concerns were for her man who'd not so long since been
tortured by Niska and now was in Alliance hands. Potentially the hands of those
folks who'd tortured and cut into River, who'd also demonstrated no compunction
about leaving a trail of corpses behind them of people who knew too much.

&quot;How do we even know it wasn't Jayne who betrayed us - again - in the first
place?&quot; Simon raised, although at Mal's pointed glare he at least took to
making his protests in between doing his job. His hands felt cool and steady at
her temple, despite the anger and the shake in his voice. &quot;He took her out of
the ship! What the hell was he thinking?&quot;

&quot;I'd guess in this situation he was thinking of Badger's people having a bunch
of guns on the both of them.&quot; Mal had that stillness he got in place of anger
which meant, usually, he hadn't any patience for having his orders questioned,
though the doctor had showed a persistent slowness of uptake on that matter
many a time before. &quot;Jayne didn't do this, on account of earlier he was
shooting feds by my side and they ain't that forgiving, ruse or no. 'Sides,
that last betrayal near got him killed twice over, by them and by me, so if his
lesson ain't learned by now he's even dumber'n I ever thought.&quot;

&quot;How about your Sir Warwick?&quot; Book asked, watching grimly in near-military
stance, arms folded. &quot;In fact, how can we be sure they won't descend on us
here, that they aren't just waiting for the right moment?&quot;

Mal fixed him a glare, too, over the top of Simon's bowed head. &quot;We can't be
sure - but I'm not about to cut and run. If we lose *Serenity*, we lose it all.
If they have our names, it's over, sooner or later. No way can we hide the
whole crew. But we have to work on the assumption they don't know those things
and we can still haul ourselves clear of all this mess. Only assumption right
now that's worth working on.&quot;

&quot;Something of an act of faith, captain,&quot; the Shepherd pointed out gently.

&quot;Nothing but simple common sense,&quot; Mal retaliated. &quot;I'll worry about those
things I can do something to change.&quot; He grimaced. &quot;It wasn't Sir Warwick. That
wasn't an ambush set up from someone knew we'd be coming out of his place.
Plenty better places for them to jump us if they knew we were coming.&quot; His eyes
strayed over to where Kaylee lay on the bed in the corner, as an unidentifiable
mumble emerged from that direction.

Zoe shifted slightly in the chair, easing aches, as Simon finished cleaning the
gash on her head and started to unroll a wad of dressing. He still looked
angry. Boy had done well to stay on the ship, though Book had also had
something to do with that, and might've struggled if the waiting had stretched
any longer.

Mal jerked his head toward Kaylee, distracting Simon from dressing the wound a
moment. &quot;There something you can give her? I could use my engineer
operational.&quot;

&quot;There is,&quot; the doctor said reluctantly, &quot;But she'd feel it later, and would be
unlikely to thank you.&quot;

&quot;Then she and I will have to deal with that later. Reckon she's got some misery
headed her way if we do nothing anyhow.&quot; The edge of his mouth quirked up in a
fragment of a smile, dragged down too soon by their weight of problems. &quot;Get
her up and about once you're finished with Zoe.&quot;

There was a crash of a door that reverberated from somewhere inside the ship,
and Mal was out of the infirmary, the Alliance issue gun drawn, in an instant.
Simon's fingers stilled on her head as the two of them waited, not breathing,
and Zoe wished she could be confident of staying on her feet unaided if it
happened they had to fight. After a moment, voices sounded from somewhere down
the passageway, and slowly worked their way closer.

Book relaxed the position he'd taken by the door as Mal walked back in with
Jayne at his side, even though they'd been able to discern who was approaching
by their voices some seconds earlier. He relaxed too soon anyhow, as it turned
out.

Simon was a blur as he flung himself forward. &quot;You!&quot; the doctor snarled, teeth
bared, backing Jayne over a work-surface with the force of his tackle, the
mercenary too astonished to have even struck back. &quot;How much did they promise
to pay you this time? How can you even - knowing what they'll do to her -
!&quot;

&quot;I didn't, gorramit - &quot; Jayne protested, voice descending to a growl as Simon
managed to land a respectable punch to his jaw; caught both the doctor's hands
roughly and it looked for a moment like they were going to have a surgeon with
a full matching set of broken fingers.

&quot;That's enough!&quot; Mal shouted, dragging them apart. He ignored Jayne - the fact
he turned his back on him enough an indication of trust for Zoe, watching. He
tossed Simon against the wall and pinned him there by leaning weight on the
hands he clenched in the doctor's collar. &quot;I don't care what choices he did and
didn't make this evening. That's past now. Jayne may just have made it possible
to rescue your sister tonight, so I'd quiet down and listen polite to what he
has to say.&quot; His fingers flexed, tightening their grasp, and Simon flinched.
&quot;Now, are we gonna have a problem again if I let you go?&quot;

Simon shook his head, still looking rebellious.

&quot;Good.&quot; Mal released him, shoved him back toward the chair, and placed himself
between the doctor and Jayne anyway. &quot;Finish doctorin' Zoe,&quot; he ordered.

***

&quot;Here's the situation as it stands.&quot; Mal paced in front of the crew where
they'd arranged themselves around the dining table; Kaylee huddled in her seat
back in grease-stained overalls and trying to keep her head up, Zoe with a
red-blotted dressing on her head wound standing leaned over her chair with her
arms set to the table like a challenge, Jayne outwardly relaxed but his eyes
continuing to slide over to where Simon stood with an unusual troubled cast to
them, Simon too agitated for sitting. Shepherd Book stood quiet over at the
back - man always had had an aversion to sitting in with the rest of them,
these meetings where they were about to do something not-entirely-legal. &quot;It's
looking like River was spotted in the street by someone with brains enough to
report it back in and keep her tagged 'til the cavalry arrived. These weren't
regular Alliance troops; they had too much idea what they were chasing for
that. And they were playing for keeps - least one bystander got killed by their
guns in that exchange. Didn't see anyone caring too much, neither.&quot;

He paused, watching their faces. &quot;Point being, firstly - they don't know about
*Serenity*. They don't know who we are. If they had, they'd have come for us by
now. So they got no more'n what they had before, leastways for the moment. Now,
the way things stand, I don't see that we have many choices. Jayne - &quot; He
crossed his arms and stood still, leaning back against the wall, handing over
the floor to the merc.

&quot;Place I trailed 'em to - &quot; Jayne jabbed a finger down on a battered electronic
map, making the image dissolve a moment with the pressure. &quot;There's an Alliance
installation right here. Don't look like much from outside. Small. On the face
of it, seems like one of those bureaucratic bits they set up on worlds like
this to shift paperwork. But I did some sniffing around and, you ask me, the
security don't add up. They got themselves a lot of fancy devices and a whole
hell of a lot of armed personnel.&quot;

Book put in thoughtfully, &quot;Don't forget, last time, Persephone was where we
picked up our mole.&quot;

Mal nodded. &quot;So what we have,&quot; he said, &quot;Is a secure Alliance installation.
Now, we don't know for sure the extent of what's in there, but I imagine we can
all grasp pretty well we're not talking a walk in the park.&quot; A small cough of
nervous laughter escaped him. &quot;We need to think about this carefully.&quot;

&quot;Sir,&quot; Zoe began, and Simon angrily said, &quot;We are going to get them back,
captain? If you think I'm just leaving my sister in their hands, after
everything - &quot;

&quot;Didn't say we weren't.&quot; Mal cut him off. &quot;See, they don't know about
*Serenity*... yet. But soon as they get Wash or River or - *hell* - Badger
talking, they will. And then, there won't be nowhere the rest of us can hide.
Speed is what matters here. If we can get in fast, we can get them out 'fore
that information gets logged and makes it onto any permanent records... or the
cortex... then there's a chance we can still get out of this free and flying.
We rescue them, we rescue ourselves - because if they stay in Alliance custody
every one of us is gonna end up a tagged fugitive. And need I remind you all
that on top of everything else, *Serenity* is going precisely nowhere without
Wash. Ain't none of the rest of us know enough about flying to break atmo in
this boat.&quot;

Simon had listened to all of that with his lips pressing harder together in
anger, until they were white by the time he said, &quot;That's very selfless of you,
captain.&quot;

Mal shot him a look. &quot;I'm just outlining the facts as they stand. And I'm not
finished yet.&quot; He dragged his gaze over the rest. &quot;This time-scale doesn't give
us long to come up with a plan. Kaylee, we need to know if there's any way we
can break their security, or at least make some kind of distraction to get the
edge on them. You and Jayne and - &quot; He gave the preacher a quelling glance &quot; -
Shepherd Book can get to working on that, seeing how Jayne's the one has seen
what they've got and has the best idea of the ground.&quot; Mal gauged their
understanding from their faces. They were all of them in; even Jayne. This
wasn't a rescue mission, it was basic survival.

&quot;There's more,&quot; he added carefully. &quot;We need a workable plan and we need it
quick... but I want to make one thing clear: it has to stand a chance. We don't
have a lot of hope if we can't do this, but I'm not leading us all into
suicide, either. We can't do this... then we scatter, make our way separate.
That's the only chance any of us will have.&quot;

He saw the announcement hit them all. Jayne gave a faintly sour nod of
agreement, but otherwise even Kaylee opened her mouth in protest.

&quot;No,&quot; Simon said. &quot;I'm not leaving River. We have to try - &quot;

&quot;We will.&quot; Zoe's voice had a dangerous edge. She faced Mal across the table.
&quot;Something on your mind, sir? You *know* we don't have anywhere near enough
fighters or firepower among us to pull off this kind of operation. Not against
the Alliance, even if Kaylee works miracles tying their security in knots.&quot;

&quot;Well, now,&quot; Mal said, resting his own hands to the table top to mirror her. &quot;I
do have an idea might garner us some extra resources in that area.&quot;

***

Badger wasn't a man made a habit of courting trouble with the Alliance. No,
sir. He had his business, and they had theirs, and happened that the two didn't
agree with each other so well, but that was just fine so long as he made good
and sure their paths didn't intersect. He'd done a stretch in an Alliance jail
a time or two, but he'd no truck with the kind of sentences handed out for
aiding fugies. To be harbouring a fugitive from federal justice on his ragged
little crew - well, seemed Captain Reynolds had more balls and less brains
than Badger'd ever credited him with, for a one-time rebel soldier scraping by
in the world that kicked his *pigu*.

Still, that wasn't to say he couldn't understand the notion. Was a pretty
little thing, after all, though apparently more'n a little fickle. Gave a man
pause wondering just what it was she might've done, but then who wasn't a bit
tarnished in the eyes of the law, these days? Wouldn't be murder, or nothing
too bad, if Reynolds chose to take her in - man seemed to reckon he could
afford to cling to principles, in these times where all the rest of them were
forced to trade theirs off. No, more likely something political that would
appeal to that subversive Browncoat mindset.

Sitting on a bench with the lady herself and Reynolds' pilot, in a near-empty
room all white reflective tiles and harsh lighting, his hands cuffed behind him
and a guard watching them on either side, Badger wished he'd let Captain
Reynolds try and play the gorram hero.

They'd been walked into some pokey Alliance building looked more like a
storefront than any military set-up. 'Cept this one had a lift at the back that
went down a way, and the stretch of sterile corridors and doors and more
corridors leading off where they emerged was anything but pokey, and Badger was
beginning to get even worse a case of bad feeling about this than he'd had from
the moment the cuffs snapped in place around his wrists with that odd kind of
familiarity like they'd missed him and was welcoming him back. (&quot;Don't you
worry, love,&quot; he'd said to the girl - River - as they'd been hustled away 'fore
Captain Reynolds could mount that daring rescue. &quot;Prison's not so bad. Play
your cards right, even learn yourself a skill or a few while you're there.&quot; And
she'd looked at him seriously, something in her gaze that bordered on
terrifying, and said, &quot;We're not going to prison, Simon.&quot; He somehow just knew
she didn't mean that in a good way.)

Had been about halfway into the journey through the streets to their current
stark cell before he'd remembered 'Simon' was the name of that pampered young
doctor Reynolds employed on his crew - and that was a *joke*, a ship that size
keeping a qualified doctor on permanent retainer. Given Reynolds' habit of
getting himself sliced and diced, maybe he hadn't given so much thought to it
before as it warranted... But the fact was, no doctor without some *major*
circumstances at work would be staying on some gorram junkheap firefly that
barely scraped enough living to keep itself in the air.

Now Badger was sitting in handcuffs and not speaking because he couldn't think
of anything to say wouldn't reveal to all and sundry he wasn't River's gorram
brother. He'd gotten the distinct idea he might be speedily cast off the mortal
coil if these people should learn he wasn't part of this business - which
didn't exactly make him much in the way of hopeful for the future, given he
didn't look a bit like the fellow. Also not speaking because, well, outside you
might be able to spin the world on sharp talk, but in the hands of the
Establishment you got by on shutting up and keeping your head down. 'Cause
sharp talk wasn't about to buy anything more'n a beating in that man's
world.

The girl was staring at him. Her feet kicked against the bench that the three
of them were arrayed along and he realised for the first time she was wearing
too-big black combat boots with that sad cast-off of a dress. &quot;You're much
louder now you've gone all quiet,&quot; she observed, in near a whisper, still
talking for all the world like someone from the Colony, with a tiny smile
didn't fit the situation nor all her earlier screaming at all. He grimaced
back, trying to think up a retort and decide whether he'd just been insulted.
If he could string what she'd just said into any gorram semblance of sense. Her
head rotated up and to the side and her smile widened. &quot;Your hat's all
crooked.&quot;

&quot;I know.&quot; It had tipped forward half over his left eye when one of their
Alliance escort had gotten friendly with his fists, and it'd been annoying the
crap out of him the last half hour while there was precisely nothing he could
do about it for the handcuffs.

Reynolds' pilot was giving him an odd look, from over the other side of the
girl. Badger had been too relieved he'd finally shut up, after running his
mouth off so much about nothing on the way in, to want to encourage
conversation. The way the guards had paid attention ever so carefully when
River spoke didn't make him want much to get chatty, neither, since he could do
without that kind of attention from feds. Even so, he couldn't resist a barked,
&quot;What the hell you think you're looking at?&quot;

&quot;Nothing... nothing...&quot; The man looked away innocently, but gave the definite
impression of being somehow amused.

River turned her head 'round to the pilot. She said, &quot;You don't tell them
nothing if you want that pretty lady o' yours to get away clean.&quot; Dyton Colony
was thick in her earnest voice, and the guards listened then exchanged their
noncommittal glances. Moment after, the door slid open and that bastard
lieutenant and two more regular soldiers trailing behind him stepped
through.

&quot;You,&quot; the lieutenant said, pointing to the pilot. &quot;Get up.&quot;

The man looked like he was considering it, but didn't move fast enough for the
feds. At a motion from the lieutenant, the two regulars manhandled him to his
feet, not being over-gentle about it. &quot;We're going somewhere?&quot; the pilot asked,
voice wavering in almost a high giggle. &quot;Where are we going?&quot;

&quot;Processing. These two, we might not be able to touch, but you... you'll tell
us where to find the others who've been helping them. Might even buy you enough
goodwill to be released from the penal moon a few years before you leave in a
coffin.&quot;

&quot;That sounds... very... goodwill...&quot;

&quot;Remember,&quot; River said, as the poor unfortunate bastard was led away, and the
door closed. Then it was just the two of them on a bench in a stark-lit room,
and the guards fidgeting with the renewal of boredom.

The girl's eyes slowly went distant as the minutes passed. After a while, her
body jerked in her seat - once, and then again only a second after; her eyes
wide and shocky as though with pain.

&quot;Something wrong, love?&quot; Badger asked.

She looked at him, and it seemed more like she was looking through him. Spoke
in a voice wasn't anything like his or her own, but maybe a little like
Reynolds' pilot... at least in the way it was instilled with no small quantity
of high panic that wasn't matched in her now-blank gaze.

&quot;You don't scare me. I've been tortured by experts,&quot; she said, as her body
jerked again.

***

&quot;I'm still not sure I understand why I'm even here,&quot; Simon murmured as they
headed towards the set-up where Badger made his den. Garbage with pretensions,
he thought. Crates, parts and make-do fashioned in a junkyard palace on the
edge of the docks.

&quot;Simple,&quot; Mal said, clapping a hand on his shoulder as they walked. &quot;Wanted a
criminal mastermind on hand in this job. You just think evil thoughts and twirl
that imaginary black moustache of yours, doctor, and pretend you're our good
luck charm.&quot;

&quot;Ariel only worked because I knew the ground,&quot; he said, rather suspecting Mal
wanted his 'criminal mastermind' out of the way of Jayne. &quot;Are you people never
going to let go of that one?&quot;

&quot;About as soon as they all let go of fancy shindigs and sword fights.&quot;

The gun at Simon's hip felt unfamiliar, himself too aware of its weight and the
way it poked his thigh when he moved. When he'd strapped it on, he'd been
thinking of wearing it to storm the Alliance installation where River was held,
to get his sister back no matter what. It was something of a comedown to be
taking it instead into a den of thieves and scoundrels who reportedly tended to
consider Captain Reynolds quaint and honourable in the business... His mind had
a great deal of trouble processing that one.

They were very near the construction now. Simon took a deliberate breath and
tried to fall into step with Zoe and Mal the way they were in step with each
other, and he didn't quite manage it, but he told himself this was as much of
import to rescuing River as a full-out attack on the Alliance itself, and kept
trying.

A hand fell on his arm and half a dozen guns levelled as they brushed through a
curtain into a main chamber that overall looked decidedly shabby, though there
was a desk and the odd individual item that must have been expensive. The hand
on his arm belonged to a guard who'd been standing out of sight at the edge of
the curtain. His grip was bruising.

Simon's hand wanted to drift to his own gun, as though just wearing it created
that very reflex, but neither Mal nor Zoe had made any move to draw theirs.
They just stood projecting an aura of unimpressed calm Simon was certain he
didn't have himself.

&quot;Some bad news about your boss,&quot; Mal said casually. &quot;Alliance bagged him. I'm
thinking that's an awful shame, with him being such an upstanding citizen in
these parts. Pillar of the community...&quot;

The several dangerous and armed men didn't move. Mal surveyed them carefully,
then stepped further inside the chamber, his hands keeping well clear of his
pistol. They swung wide as he walked, in a half-hearted parody of being raised.
He came to a halt at Badger's empty desk and hitched his hip over the side,
leaning there with an air of command. Badger's men looked restless.

Zoe shot Simon a look that he interpreted to mean 'be ready'. Because he really
needed to be told that, he thought irritably, the way his nerves were already
on edge.

&quot;I figure you already got this information,&quot; Mal said, toying with a few
harmless objects on the desk, &quot;Badger's information network being so good and
all. Maybe you've even already engaged in a discussion or two 'bout how you
might fill that power vacuum.&quot;

Some of the men looked more agitated than others. Simon noticed more had crept
out of the woodwork, another half-dozen pairs of eyes watching on the
sidelines. To say he had a 'bad feeling' about this plan didn't even begin to
cover his apprehension.

&quot;Way I figure it, though - &quot; Mal's voice had taken on a friendly, near-amused
tone, and he waggled an open hand at the men in a placating gesture while his
left hand, exploring, found an apple on the desk and plucked it up. He regarded
it, eyes flicking down for what felt like way too long, and then back up. Next
to Simon, Zoe stood like she was cut out of rock &quot; - Better the devil you
know.&quot; The captain waved the apple. &quot;Transition is always painful, and in this
line, as I'm sure you're aware, usually results in more'n a few corpses
alongside the general upheaval. From what I hear, Badger was a fairly
reasonable animal, all things considered, not too bad to work for. Kept you in
pay, stayed clear of trouble... cagey with his contacts, mind. I guess that
last part might make life a fraction hard-going a while without him, 'til
things settle in. Maybe you boys are even thinking you might be in for some
trouble.&quot;

Simon looked to Zoe. The thought running through his head was, inescapably,
'*We're going to die*', but her expression hadn't changed.

&quot;Could be there's another choice,&quot; Mal added, almost an afterthought.

Finally, one of the henchmen stepped forward of the others. A scrawny,
stretched-out fellow with long, lank hair and an array of knives hung about his
person. The glances the other men sent his way spanned a range from resentful
to uncertain. &quot;Get off my gorram desk,&quot; he said.

As he started speaking, Zoe kicked Simon's foot surreptitiously: an
unmistakeable *now*.

Before he'd finished speaking, a shot sounded, and Simon scrabbled to draw his
own weapon as Zoe was doing - had already done - without taking his eyes off
the scene. Even so, he'd already missed entirely the moment the captain drew,
and only saw him now with his pistol raised, but not aimed at anyone, merely
resting parallel to his shoulder, pointed up to the air. With a brief grimace
at the defiance of long habit, he took a bite out of the apple in his other
hand and waited, letting the new landscape of the situation sink in to all
present. Simon stood with Zoe and tried to look threatening, levelling the
unfamiliar gun at... the world in general.

By the time Mal finished chewing, the air in the chamber actually felt, if
anything, a little more relaxed. He rested the hand still holding the apple
against the edge of the desk and nodded at the corpse on the floor. Nobody had
made any particular move toward it.

He said, &quot;How about we say I'm your new boss and I'm saying we're going to get
your old boss back?&quot;

***

&quot;Sit down!&quot; Fury in the voice and the shove that took the last of his balance
from him. He almost landed on Badger, but the smaller man managed to scoot to
the side at the last moment so that Wash ended up this time seated between his
fellow captives. River looked pale and serious. Paying attention to that at
least pried some pieces of his concentration from the lingering pain of his
questioners' fists. His nose felt squashed, and there was a trickle over his
top lip that he left to ooze.

&quot;Torture a part of the arrest process now in a *civilised* society?&quot; River
said sweetly, though there was enough mockery in there that Lieutenant Armin
raised an angry, open palm, only stalling it as he'd begun to bring it down.
River hadn't flinched, like she'd known the blow would never land. Nice for
her.

&quot;Your ally refuses to identify himself, little girl. As such, he's waived any
rights the due process gives him, including legal representation, might I add -
&quot; the lieutenant looked pointedly at Wash &quot; - according to Alliance law.&quot;

&quot;Like it'd matter anyhow.&quot; Wash raised his head, defiantly trying to focus his
blurring vision. &quot;You people have no intention of following due process.&quot; That
time, Armin didn't curtail his blow, nor deliver it open-palmed. Wash fell back
against Badger again, who bolstered him up with a shoulder and an edgy,
&quot;steady.&quot;

The lieutenant smiled. He had two subordinates behind him who looked like they
wouldn't mind at all if he didn't want to get his own hands dirty, but Wash
figured he was a hands-on kinda guy. He proved it again by placing those hands
on the wall either side of Wash's head as he leaned in close. &quot;It won't matter,
you know. It will take less than twenty-four hours to isolate your DNA scan and
find out just who you are. Soon after that we'll have a trace on who you're
working for or with. And whoever else was shooting at my men out there in the
street that you're trying to give a head start? They can't run fast enough or
long enough to escape the Alliance. There aren't many people out there foolish
enough to harbour a tagged fugitive. There'll be nowhere they can hide.&quot;

Wash looked away, telling himself it didn't matter, a head start was better
than nothing. It was a chance... Simon and River had found Mal, and *Serenity*,
after all.

&quot;I don't know,&quot; Badger said, eyes darting to River, then back to the
lieutenant, with a spark in them that had been notably absent earlier. &quot;It's a
big universe. No shortage of places to hide. Took you people long enough to
find us, didn't it?&quot;

&quot;He speaks,&quot; Wash murmured, with mock surprise, as Armin backed off to pay
attention to Badger instead.

&quot;How long's it been, now? A year? And you only found us this time 'cause you
got lucky. Who was it sold us out, if you don't mind my asking? After all, not
like we'll get opportunity to do anything with the information.&quot;

&quot;Nobody 'sold you out'.&quot; The lieutenant's fingers twitched at his sides. &quot;You
were spotted on the docks. Her face is well known.&quot;

&quot;But not so much mine, eh?&quot;

Wash tried to elbow Badger covertly, while Armin's face twisted in distaste. &quot;I
can see that a year living as a renegade hasn't done you any favours, doctor.
But she's the one they really want.&quot;

&quot;'They'? Comes from high up, doesn't it, I'll bet? So you're just the legwork,
then. Not even allowed to lay a hand on little sister here and my own
unfavourable self, eh? Nah... not even allowed to process us. I'll bet *that*
must rankle something mean.&quot;

&quot;I'd suggest you not test the limits of my patience too hard,&quot; Armin said
frostily. He half-turned away, appeared to consider a moment, then came around
again with another blow that knocked Wash back into the wall, forcing the air
from his body in a 'whuff'.

Badger snorted.

&quot;No!&quot; Wash snapped, soon as he'd the breath to, snapping his head 'round
between Badger and River. &quot;In case you're thinking this has the potential to be
a really fun game, just... don't *do* anything else, okay? Either of you!&quot; The
lieutenant laughed and turned again to go. &quot;And why is it I have to be the one
it's okay to hit?&quot;

&quot;The universe decided,&quot; River said. &quot;Tossed a coin. The coin would have had a
billion different sides, you know, but then what's basic physics to fate
anyhow?&quot;

&quot;What indeed.&quot; He heard a touch of hysteria in his own voice. River might have
the worst of their predicament in the long run, but that didn't mean he wasn't
scared to the bone. The Alliance folks involved in this killed those that knew
too much. He hoped his wife was still alive, and Mal had gotten her away. Not
long since, he'd been resenting that relationship... now it was the best hope
he had to count on. Mal and Zoe looked out for each other a long time before
Zoe met him. They'd keep on doing so, no matter what happened to him.

Mal had never owned up to his talent for picking enemies when, all those years
ago, Wash had agreed to take on this job.
