WINGNUTS AREN'T FUNNY

In January, Fox announced that it would begin airing the &quot;Half Hour News
Hour&quot; on Sunday nights, the so-called &quot;right-wing answer to 'The Daily
Show With Jon Stewart.'&quot; &quot;You can turn on any show and see Bush being
bashed,&quot; said creator Joel Surnow, producer of Fox's 24. &quot;There really
is nothing out there for those who want satire that tilts right.&quot; As Fox
has learned, that's because no one wants to watch that kind of satire.

TVNewser reports today that the HHNH has been canceled. In a memo to
senior producers today, Fox News Corp.'s senior vice president Bill
Shine announced:

Joel Surnow and I have mutually decided that we will not continue
the Half Hour News Hour beyond its current 15 episode run. The last show
will be presented on September 16th.

Shine claimed the reason for the shelving of the show was that Fox is
&quot;considering ways to retool the show for future scheduling needs.&quot; He
held out the chance that the show would air again: &quot;There is still a
chance you will see the program at some point in the future.&quot;

The first show guest-starred right-wing all-stars Rush Limbaugh and Ann
Coulter as President and Vice President.

The reviews for the program were consistently dismal. Its very first
review, from the Orlando Sentinel, decried the &quot;laughter, of an awfully
canned variety, greets all the gags. Nothing happening on screen
justifies these outbursts. … If we’re lucky, we'll never hear of this
dreadful show again.&quot; &quot;Sometimes the humor is so heavy-handed that it
seems almost like self-parody,&quot; said the New York Times. &quot;The 1/2 Hour
News Hour is slow torture all by itself,&quot; said the Philadelphia Inquirer.

What the right-wing failed to grasp is Jon Stewart is funny not because
he spins falsehoods but because he tells the truth.

Despite such, Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity still dominate talk
radio.  To each their own.

Too bad Air America can't get Stewart to do talk radio for them. I
wonder though; where are the 'fairness docrine' screamers to object to
this?

hmmmnnnn?????

(deathly silence...) Thought so.

...by the way, I've seen the 'Half Hour News Hour.&quot; Once. I wasn't
tempted to see it twice. It really is awful and deserves to be deep
sixed.

Your post, however, reminded me of something that happened to me when
I was about, oh, 11 or so. I went to a school with a most
disappointing athletic program. So disappointing was it, that our team
had, quite literally, not won a basketball game for over 15 years. On
one memorable occasion, however, we were to travel to Paris (Idaho) to
play the best team in the valley. We were expecting nothing, of
course; we knew we were going to lose; we always did. However----the
opposing team had had some very bad luck. Seems their first string had
all come down with the measles and couldn't play. However, the school
didn't want to cancel the game and send everybody home, so they took
the baseball team second string, put 'em all in basket ball uniforms,
and sent them onto the court.

....and our team won. It was close, but we WON (I don't think this
accomplishment has ever been repeated..). We were stunned. We didn't
know what to do. I mean, we didn't even have any victory cheers to
celebrate the occasion!  The cheerleaders stepped up, though--and used
all the victory cheers the other team was used to using. We all mobbed
the floor and carried the players around on our shoulders...it was
pandamonium. Oh, how we celebrated our basketball victory over the
second string baseball team!!!

Now...I wonder why that story came to me just now?

Every time I hear a right wing talking point repeated, I ask them if they
heard it on Hannity, Limbaugh, or O'Reilly.

Nobody EVER admits to listening to that crap.   Sometimes

Yet reich wing radio claims 'listeners' and 'ratings' is
why they dominate the markets.

Talk Radio is canned thought.  People who don't think just regurgitate
the sophistry and enjoy the sound of their own voice.  It makes me
sick to listen to Rush and here all those ditto heads &quot;I believe every
thing you ever say&quot; Is it possible for any two thinking people to
agree on everything?  I don't think so.  Even the ones who agree 99.7
percent of the time are braindead.  I don't hear callers on NPR
calling up saying how they never disagree with the host.

&gt; to the ratings and free market?
">

Yep. If it didn't make money, if people didn't want to listen, they
wouldn't. The whole thing is about market share. Advertisers like it. If
some liberal came up with a talk show that brought in the listeners the way
Rush, Hannity, John and Ken, O'Reilly and Bill Handel do, the advertisers
would buy into it, and the show would be successful.

No advertiser is going to deliberately go with the low rated show if he can
get more listeners on a higher rated one...no matter WHAT the host
advocates. People want to listen to right wing radio.

As for me, I much prefer it. I HAVE listened to Air America. I keep trying
it....and inevitably the whining and the bitterness make me want to throw my
computer out of the window. This would be financially problematic, not to
mention emotionally and intellectually annoying, so...Bill Handel in the
mornings (who is not, by the way, all THAT conservative; he doesn't like
Bush much...) Rush every once in awhile, O'Reilly every so often..John and
Ken in the late afternoons, once in awhile.

Doesn't surprise me a bit that you didn't get it.

John, you are the spectator from the team that hasn't won in fifteen years.
Your TV team has just won, playing against people who don't DO TV; they are
RADIO people.
...and, because this sucess is so stunning, so joyous...you ignore the fact
that, well...there isn't a whole lot of glory in doing better TV than radio
talk show hosts can do, but hey; you'll take what you can get, celebrate all
out of proportion to the event, and remember it forever.

&gt;&gt; Your post, however, reminded me of something that happened to me when
&gt;&gt; I was about, oh, 11 or so. I went to a school with a most
&gt;&gt; disappointing athletic program. So disappointing was it, that our team
&gt;&gt; had, quite literally, not won a basketball game for over 15 years. On
&gt;&gt; one memorable occasion, however, we were to travel to Paris (Idaho) to
&gt;&gt; play the best team in the valley. We were expecting nothing, of
&gt;&gt; course; we knew we were going to lose; we always did. However----the
&gt;&gt; opposing team had had some very bad luck. Seems their first string had
&gt;&gt; all come down with the measles and couldn't play. However, the school
&gt;&gt; didn't want to cancel the game and send everybody home, so they took
&gt;&gt; the baseball team second string, put 'em all in basket ball uniforms,
&gt;&gt; and sent them onto the court.

&gt;&gt; ....and our team won. It was close, but we WON (I don't think this
&gt;&gt; accomplishment has ever been repeated..). We were stunned. We didn't
&gt;&gt; know what to do. I mean, we didn't even have any victory cheers to
&gt;&gt; celebrate the occasion!  The cheerleaders stepped up, though--and used
&gt;&gt; all the victory cheers the other team was used to using. We all mobbed
&gt;&gt; the floor and carried the players around on our shoulders...it was
&gt;&gt; pandamonium. Oh, how we celebrated our basketball victory over the

&gt;&gt; Now...I wonder why that story came to me just now?

It's interesting that people of your ilk tend to rely on and emulate the

bigot Anne Coulter and other right wing freak show stars.

It's no surprise that the 30% entrenched authoritarian brownshirt-like

Diana's right on this one, except for her last sentence--it's not so
much that people want to listen to right-wind radio, it's that the
right-wing radio hosts are generally more entertaining. (I mean,
c'mon--i'm a fan of John Edwards, and i think some of Limbaugh's
parodies of Edwards are just *hilarious*!) You give people entertaining
left-leaning radio hosts, though, people'll listen to them, as well.

(This is part of why i think that the whole Fairness Doctrine thing is
silly, BTW. Also, i'm realistic enough to know that there's more than
two sides to most issues, and as soon as you have a multiplicity of
positions, the fairness doctrine idea falls apart.)

I considered Rush to be entertaining for a while.   I think the
rest would be more entertaining for me if it wasn't for the fact
that they shill for a grossly immoral war, which I do have personal
stake in.  Indeed, I was a fan of Dr Laura until this time where
I decided since she is evil incarnate.

But this generates another question.   The fact is, of the masses
of conservative talk radio, most of them get really poor ratings, and
are propped up because a few corporate owners can support them
and bring in corporate advertising to support the agenda.

The ratings suck, yet many of these right wing talk stations
are pulling half the ratings that competing liberal radio does in
the same market, where the conservative stations have twice the
wattage and range.

The problem is is that the 'fairness doctrine' is the wrong approach
to the problem.   The problem was the relaxation of station ownership
regulation that allowed powerful corporations to control  thousands of
markets, and sometimes &quot;competing&quot; markets.

The 'fairness doctrine' can't possibly solve that, and indeed the strongest
advocates for change are not calling for the fairness doctrine to step in,
but to break up station ownership.

Even I would. The stuff on TV that lambasts the right is quite often
extremely funny; and I enjoy it. I didn't like that Fox attempt at all. It
was far too heavy handed, using radio people who are very talented at
radio...and can't do TV for squat. (shrug)

I've always considered the 'fairness doctrine' to be about as
unconstitutional an idea as it is possible to get. Now, when there are so
very many venues to get one's message out, there is no need, OR excuse, for

Diana, Manning spams this group by plastering it with off-topic
pastings he hopes will somehow offend the Mormons he thinks will notice
and comment, so he can have an opportunity to insult them, which is his
most desired emotional pay-off.

That's his &quot;job&quot; and that's his pay, for what it's worth. It is
really nothing at all, but it's all Manning has.

A google groups search shows that he is a long-time disappointed and
rejected cult disciple of the Maharishi Yogi (MMY), and is possessed of
an unstable personality. In one revealing episode in his autobiography,
he asked the Yogi what was wrong. The Yogi, just pointing to Manning's
wife, said loudly, &quot;Ask her!&quot; I'm not sure if Manning to this day
realizes that the problem with Manning is Manning, as those who know him
best can attest.

Poor Younger Smith is miffed because I have accurately pointed out that
he claims that Joseph Smith was a fraud and that the Book of Mormon is a
fiction - while at the same time he claims that he's a Mormon.

Because I've repeated this humiliating fact about him he apparently
feels it necessary to misrepresent what I wrote and lie about me personally.

I'd suggest that readers ask Mr. Smith how he justifies claiming that
the Book of Mormon is a work of fiction with his claim that he's a Mormon.

But John...

Is he right about you being a former desciple of the Manarishi Yogi?

Maharishi doesn't have 'disciples'. He's not a personal guru. But I was
indeed involved with the TM organization at one time. I left the TM
organization over 20 years ago as I was interested in God, and to me,
Maharishi didn't appear to be. He was and is into making a lot of money
however.
