Please refresh my memory, someone. I have a 69 C10. Power steering
boxes from 60-something through 80-something will interchange. What are
these years, and what years have the quick ratio steering?
TIA.

regards,
Leon

Don't truck steering boxes mount on the outside of the frame, as opposed to
inside like cars? Also I think the truck boxes are usually the 808 series,
not the 800 as on cars. I don't think I ever heard of quick-ratio gears in a
truck, and the guts don't interchange.

Leon, 71 &amp; 72 Chevy trucks had the variable ration power steering. Those 2
years will bolt right up to your frame. 73 &amp; up had the variable ratio, but
to use them, you will need to space the box .375&quot; away from the rail to make
the steering geometry work. The 73 through 78 bolt holes line up exactly
to your frame, the only difference is the 3/8&quot; difference in mounting
location. Hope I've helped. steve
