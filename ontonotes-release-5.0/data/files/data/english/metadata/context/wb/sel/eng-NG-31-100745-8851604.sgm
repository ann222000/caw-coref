I don't think you save much work that way. I'd go with something
totally different, like Chinese braised spareribs.

I kind of agree. It's about as difficult as getting things
ready, cooking in the oven and cleaning up.

Start the lump, get the temp right, throw 'em on and forget
about 'em for a few hours.

One of the best food investments I have made is putting down the extra money
for the Weber Performer.
I fill the baskets, fire up the propane lighter, let it  burn for five
minutes, and one half hour later you're ready to go. It makes charcoal/wood
grilling as effortless as gas.
The current model has a real disadvanatage. It uses a disposable propane can
of fuel rather than the 5lb tank. The older tank lasts for at least 150
charcoal lights, or a whole season, and the disposable does 10-15, according
to Weber. I also wonder about it's flame output. It raises the cost of
lighting. I don't know if you can hitch a 20lb tank to the new one as you're
supposed to be able to with the old 5lb tank. I doubt it.
Cheers,

Kent

LOL - tough crowd here!

Before I discovered real Q, I used to make these in the oven (even
though they call for grilling) and they were always a hit:

However, they are not even close to the ribs I make now on the wsm. I'll
never make ribs in the oven again.

Mix up 8 tbsp of liquid smoke with 3/4 cup of Hunt's original barbecue
sauce.  Boil the ribs until the bone is beginning to show, then  dip the
ribs in the barbecue sauce mix, Lay the ribs under the electric broiler
for 3 minutes per side.  Remove, paint on the remainder of the sauce and
enjoy.

By the way, are you &quot;Jay&quot; over on rec.travel.cruises?  Tipping is the
big troll there.

Academy Outdoors had that very connection the last time I was in the
store.  I have a little patio griller I like to tailgate/camp with,
but I don't like paying the $2.75 for a small bottle of propane and
worry about having enough to cook a few times when out.

The little gizmo had the connection on one end to connect right up to
the regulator (the same male connection design of the propane bottle),
and the other had the regular large connection to connect the hose on
a 20# propane tank.

The guys at Academy told me that folks buy them for their Coleman two
burner campstoves as they apparently eat those little one pound
cylinders alive when both burners are on.  They attach to a large
cylinder, and they are done.

It was sold brass, and about $15.

Although it's too little, too late:
http://www.foodnetwork.com/food/recipes/recipe/0,,FOOD_9936_11125,00....

I've gotten good results with this _process_ with &quot;featherbone
riblets&quot;, which seem a little too small to stand up to a smoker, so I
braised them.  I say process, because I generally play fast &amp; loose
with ingredients.

Needless to say, I'm a bit of an AB fan.

Regards,

You can bake ribs, but it is not the same as barbecue, and you will
never quite achieve that divinely smoky flavour we have all come to know
and love.

That said, they can still be good in their own right.  If I am going to
bake ribs, First, I remove the fell, then rub them down with the
seasoning/rub of your choice.  My personal favourite is Greek seasoning,
a mixture of salt, pepper, garlic, oregano and lemon rind.  I bake them
on a baking sheet in a slow oven about 300F - 325F until done. I might
baste them with lemon juice once or twice.

Not the same as barbecue, but still very tasty.

Abby

might as well throw them in a crock pot with sauerkraut.... at least
then they will be good. You can't imitate, and i don't know how you
can be too lazy to start the smoker and throw 'em and forget 'em for a
few hours...it's not very hard
