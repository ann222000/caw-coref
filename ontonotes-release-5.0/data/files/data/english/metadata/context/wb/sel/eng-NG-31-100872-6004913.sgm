Formation
Several mechanisms have been suggested for the Moon's formation. Early
speculation proposed that the Moon broke off from the Earth's crust because
of centrifugal forces, leaving a basin (presumed to be the Pacific Ocean)
behind as a scar.[26] This fission concept, however, requires too great an
initial spin of the Earth. Others speculated that the Moon formed elsewhere
and was captured into Earth's orbit.[27] However, the conditions required
for this capture mechanism to work (such as an extended atmosphere of the
Earth for dissipating energy) are not too probable. The coformation
hypothesis posits that the Earth and the Moon formed together at the same
time and place from the primordial accretion disk. In this theory, the Moon
forms from material surrounding the proto-Earth, similar to the way in which
the planets formed around the Sun. Some suggest that this hypothesis fails
to adequately explain the depletion of metallic iron in the Moon. A major
deficiency with all of these hypotheses is that they cannot easily account
for the high angular momentum of the Earth-Moon system.[28]

Today, the giant impact hypothesis for forming the Earth-Moon system is
widely accepted by the scientific community. In this theory, the impact of a
Mars-sized body (which has been referred to as Theia or Orpheus) into the
proto-Earth is postulated to have put enough material into circumterrestrial
orbit to form the Moon.[1] Given that planetary bodies are believed to have
formed by the hierarchical accretion of smaller to larger sized bodies, it
is now recognized that giant impact events such as this should be expected
to have occurred for some planets. Computer simulations modeling this impact
can account for the angular momentum of the Earth-Moon system, as well as
the small size of the lunar core.[29] Unresolved questions concerning this
theory are the relative sizes of the proto-Earth and impactor, and the
proportion of material from the proto-Earth and impactor that contribute to
making the Moon. The formation of the Moon is believed to have occurred at
4.527 Â± 0.01 billion years, about 30 to 50 million years after the origin of
the solar system.[30]
