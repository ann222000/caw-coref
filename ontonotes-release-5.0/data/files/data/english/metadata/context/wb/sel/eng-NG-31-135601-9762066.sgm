As an extension of an earlier thread regarding a COBOL-to-Java
conversion... some meanderings.

As noted, the core of such a thing is not a technology change, it is a
business process change and needs to be addressed both by those familiar
with the present process (what the COBOL system does) as well as those who
are familiar with the new technology's capabilities (what the Java system
can do).  Right off the bat there may be difficulties... those familiar
with the present process may respond with 'oh, we can do *that*, why
didn't you ask?' when the new-tech team begins its proposals.

I recall reading, someplace, a consultant who said he'd been approached by
a small insurance company in the early 1970s about converting their
current paper-and-pencil system to a state-of-the-art COBOL/CICS
green-screen system.  His off-the-record response was 'They wanted to
duplicate their current processes... they had no idea how using a computer
would change the way they work and the way they could work, essentially
they wanted an electronic version of their current system and nothing
more.'

In like manner... who has not seen a DB2 installation obviously designed
by VSAM-heads? All the overhead of an RDBM system, none of the benefits.

The greatest difficulty, I would say, in these situations is that either
marching-orders have already been given (some stinkwad, two-bit,
Corner-Office Idiot says 'That last Executive Retreat I went to in the
Bahamas - oh, the harsh burdens I bear for The Company! - taught that
COBOL's worthless and Java's the way to go.  Get it done!') or that those
with a particular dog in the fight (Preserve the Olde Wayse or New System
Now) are more interested in keeping discussion in areas that they know
about than in honestly learning something new.

(on my current site I do a lot of ad-hoc reporting and file-creation for a
PeopleSoft system that gets ftp'd off the Big Iron... when it started the
general attitude was 'Oh, that can't be done with COBOL'... and this has
changed to 'Oh, only *he* can do that with COBOL', an equally distasteful
view, I'd say)

All in all, it is usually a good thing to remember what Machiavelli had to
say about the introduction of new systems
&lt; http://www.gutenberg.org/files/1232/1232.txt &gt;

--begin quoted text:

And it ought to be remembered that there is nothing more difficult to take
in hand, more perilous to conduct, or more uncertain in its success, then
to take the lead in the introduction of a new order of things. Because the
innovator has for enemies all those who have done well under the old
conditions, and lukewarm defenders in those who may do well under the new.
This coolness arises partly from fear of the opponents, who have the laws
on their side, and partly from the incredulity of men, who do not readily
believe in new things until they have had a long experience of them.

Considering HansJ situation..... and with such a magnitude of
requirements. Woh! System language conversion is not my best solution.
Go to the Cobol vendor who provided the solutions and re-engineer.

If business logic is needed to be changed... then start with a &quot;new&quot;
language platform &quot;you think&quot; is best and IT people have &quot;several&quot;
solutions for it.

Best practice: Go to a Cobol provider.... or Java-based vendor for re-
engineering. Definitely you have a budget for it. Get several vendor
solutions for re-engineering and concentrate even more with budgets.

http://www.computerworld.com.au/index.php/id;1914725230;fp;;fpid;;pf;1

A link above would somehow help... but then again, somehow?!? Most
successful developers knew Cobol, that is why we are here in this
Cobol Google group anyway.

Rene,
I'm not advocating to convert a COBOL application to Java, I like to
know if anyone has seen a successful project od this type.

This question was raised because of a requirement in an RFP that
included that the target language would be Java where the original
language was COBOL (Unisys UCOB).

Well, now that I know this is in answer to an RFP, I can put on my
contractor hat (after dusting it off as I haven't been in that world
for over two decades) and suggest bringing up my question to the
person putting out the RFP and if the answer is either inadequate
or demonstrates a complete lack of knowledge on the subject by the
proposing organization, a &quot;no bid&quot; might be the correct answer.

I don't know about COBOL to Java.  We are doing it at work now but it will
take many years before it will succeed or fail. Actuall I can tell you now
that because of the huge amount of money being spent it will be called a
success even if it fails.

You can go from COBOL to Java byte code user PerCOBOL.  Although I have not
used it those I know who have say it works well.

This echos what I've learned from long experience.

A large system designed from scratch will not work and cannot be made to
work. You have to start over with a working, smaller system. However, a
large system, produced by expanding the dimensions of a smaller system, does
not behave like the smaller system.

In a large system, malfunction, or even total non-function, may not be
detectable for long periods, if ever. The total behavior of large systems
cannot be predicted.

Some complex systems actually work. If a system is working, leave it alone.

In setting up a new system, tread softly. You may be disturbing another
system that is actually working.

SAP is written in C and ABAP, not Java. If it's only 20-30% slower, it's better than most
new systems, which are typically 2-3 TIMES slower. Tuning often produces dramatic
improvements in speed.

Charles,
the trend is definitely going to replace existing individual
application with packaged software. If it makes sense or not is
another question, but I'd admit that in many cases it makes sense.
I have seen successful and unseccessfull attempts to replace large
COBOL applications with both packages (mostly SAP) and individual
developments. So there is no reason to use an unseccessfull example as
a general statement.
Regarding the tax dollars spent, no I'm not living in the US...

across. Obviously, this particular battle is woven into our culture and the
&quot;Spirit of Anzac&quot; is something we grow up with. Despite the courage and
tenacity shown by both sides, there is no doubt that it was a real tragedy
for all concerned. The book I just finished is called &quot;Letters from the

read. Understated, doesn't preach, but has been extremely well researched,
and gives insight into the mores and attitudes of the times, both at home
and at war.)

The important point here is that in industry, when implementing change,
people don't normally die.

(Having said that, I have worked on two projects where team members DID die,
mainly as a result of work related stress. It made me think, and I have
never had this happen on any of my projects. Much as I may hate the thought
of being late or failing to achieve, the thought of people breaking down or
dying is far more repugnant...)

&gt; A large system designed from scratch will not work and cannot be made to
&gt; work. You have to start over with a working, smaller system. However, a
&gt; large system, produced by expanding the dimensions of a smaller system,
&gt; does not behave like the smaller system.

&gt; In a large system, malfunction, or even total non-function, may not be
&gt; detectable for long periods, if ever. The total behavior of large systems
&gt; cannot be predicted.

&gt; Some complex systems actually work. If a system is working, leave it
&gt; alone.

&gt; In setting up a new system, tread softly. You may be disturbing another
&gt; system that is actually working.
">

Somewhat surprisingly, I actually agree with this. While I enjoy change and
large challenges, I think your analysis is pretty much on the button, Jerry.

One of the reasons I get excited about Web Services and OO components is
because you can implement them without the risk of destroying something else
which, as you say, could be working fine.

My experience bears out what you say about starting with a smaller system
and expanding it incrementally. Obviously, encapsulated building blocks
facilitate this.

I don't agree that you should always start small and scale up. Build a system
modularly, absolutely. But not all designs scale up well. For some applications,
you need to &quot;thing big&quot; from the beginning, or it may not scale up properly. Or,
sometimes you miss opportunities if you &quot;think small&quot; but eventually will
&quot;need big&quot;. Designing toward the actual target seems more appropriate to me.
Parhaps I'm just lucky, but I've never designed a system that didn't work as
well or better than the user's expectations.

The landing at Suvla Bay was only lightly opposed but the British
commander, Lieutenant-General Sir Frederick Stopford, had so diluted his
early objectives that little more than the beach was seized. Once again
the Turks were able to win the race for the high ground of the Anafarta
Hills thereby rendering the Suvla front another case of static trench
warfare.

[snip]

The New Zealanders held out on Chunuk Bair for two days before relief was
provided by two New Army battalions from the Wiltshire and Loyal North
Lancashire Regiments. A massive Turkish counter-attack, led in person by
Mustafa Kemal, swept these two battalions from the heights.

Of the 760 men of the New Zealanders' Wellington Battalion who reached the
summit, 711 were casualties.

[snip]

Following the landing at Suvla Bay, casualties among the opposing armies
were particularly high, and the hot and humid weather made the stench of
bodies especially nauseating. A day's truce was arranged to facilitate the
removal of the dead and wounded; this momentary contact led to a strange
camaraderie between the armies much like the Christmas truce of 1914.

I did want to provide a summary of a response that I provided to DD
privately, but maybe the group could benefit as well.

I own a technology company that provides an automated migraton for
COBOL based applications. Most of our clients have IDMS, Datacom, IMS,
VSAM and Adabas and are looking to migrate to DB2, Oracle or SQL
Server.

I am hearing from our clients that they need to migrate for
predominately two reasons - we getting off of the mainframe or we feel
at risk running some of the older databases/files. For those looking
to stay on the mainframe we have been migrating them to DB2 and rarely
do we hear a request for  JAVA. Regarding clients that are migrating
off of the mainframe we are hearing an increased amount of requests to
convert part or all of the COBOL application to JAVA. We have one
client that said &quot;I want to get off the mainframe, convert to JAVA and
outsource to India&quot;. Other client comments are &quot;I had to sell JAVA to
ge the project funded&quot;.

What we are finding when clients actually migrate, they begin to see
the value in the COBOL based applications. They have years of
experience, and a temendous amount of business logic that no longer
has a subject matter expert.

Several of our projects started out with the intention to migrate the
COBOL applicatons to JAVA, and then they realize the cost and risk,
and usually determine the &quot;customer facing, high value&quot; functions will
be written in JAVA. At the end of the day, the application remains 95%
COBOL.

I am responding to a client RFP this month, the original conversation
was &quot;We have to get off the maniframe, its a CIO directive. We thought
that this would be a good time to go to the board one time and ask for
the funding to get off the mainframe and convert to JAVA&quot;. My original
comment to them was to migrate the COBOL mainframe application to
COBOL distributed platform and take inventory. SOA and web services
can be initiated through COBOL and you can leverage your business
logic embedded in your existing programs. The training requirements
for coming off of the mainframe will be limited to environmental
issues, you can protect the productivity and experience of your staff
as well. At first they did not like that thought, and now, 60 days
later, they are asking for three approaches. The first is COBOL to
COBOL, the second is a hybrid, with all the heavy lifting being done
by COBOL, and the online/high-value programs being JAVA, and the third
option is all JAVA.

I hope this group benefits by some of the feedback that I have been
hearing. We have migrated over 50M lines of COBOL code the past few
years, with less than 2% going to JAVA. It is however, being requested
as an option on almost all of our &quot;getting off the mainframe&quot; RFP's.

&gt;I am hearing from our clients that they need to migrate for

Outside of what is said in The Press about such matters... I wonder what
gives them this 'feeling'.  Are their systems maxing out, are they having
trouble hiring folks for the pittance salaries they offer, are their own
people incapable of being trained in these technologies... all
possibilities
and others, I'm sure, but asking those questions might deny your own
organisation some business.

'Oh, you don't need to migrate anything... all you need is to train some
folks and then slap on some golden handcuffs to keep them on the job!'

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Regarding clients that are migrating
&gt;off of the mainframe we are hearing an increased amount of requests to
&gt;convert part or all of the COBOL application to JAVA. We have one
&gt;client that said &quot;I want to get off the mainframe, convert to JAVA and
&gt;outsource to India&quot;.

To which one might respond 'And you believe that denying yourself control
of the resource of IT ownership would be of benefit... how?'

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Other client comments are &quot;I had to sell JAVA to
&gt;ge the project funded&quot;.

Welcome to the World of Business, aye... 'everyone's talking about
'longer, lower, wider and with port-holes, we can't get left behind!'

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;What we are finding when clients actually migrate, they begin to see
&gt;the value in the COBOL based applications. They have years of
&gt;experience, and a temendous amount of business logic that no longer
&gt;has a subject matter expert.

Oooooooooo... don't get me started on the Death of Business Analyst.
'COBOL is self-documenting so we only need programmers, not analysts...
but keep those programmers out of the meetings, they tend to be
distracting with all this 'logic' stuff.'

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Several of our projects started out with the intention to migrate the
&gt;COBOL applicatons to JAVA, and then they realize the cost and risk,
&gt;and usually determine the &quot;customer facing, high value&quot; functions will
&gt;be written in JAVA. At the end of the day, the application remains 95%
&gt;COBOL.

On the front end, nice screens, drop-down menus, easy-to-understand error
text ('1961 not a leap year' instead of 'XMB17355 - DATE ERROR')... on the
inside code that's been running for the past two decades.  I have trouble
understanding why many folks consider this a problem... 'Well, all our
salesfolk drive cars to visit clients, we should have all our deliveries
made by car, too... no trucks!'

Thanks much for this view from Another Side of the Irregular Polygon of
Life.
