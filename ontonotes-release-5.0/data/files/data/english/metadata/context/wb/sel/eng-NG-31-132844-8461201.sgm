What is a Bid'ah ?

The word *Bid'ah* in Arabic is taken from '*Al-Bada*', that is to create
something without precedence. Allah says in the Qur'aan, which translated
means: *&quot;Badei' (the Originator) of the heavens and the earth.&quot;* [Soorah
Baqarah (2): 117]

This means that Allah created the heavens and the earth without precedence.
He also said: *&quot;Say (O Muhammad (sallallhu alahi wa-sallam): I am not Bid'an
(a new thing) among the Messengers.&quot;* [Soorah Ahqaf (46): 9]

This means: 'I am not the first of Allah's Prophets to His slaves, many
(Prophets) preceded me.' When it is said that a person has performed a
Bid'ah, this means that he has innovated a new thing without precedence.

Bid'ahs in the matters of life, like the new scientific inventions are
permissible because originally, what is a matter of life or habit is
permissible. The prohibited Bid'ah is to innovate in the religion. This is
because the religion is 'Tawqifiyah' which means that religion can only be
revealed by Allah and He has completely revealed His religion. Consequently,
there is no room for any innovation. As will be manifest and clear from the
following text.

*Allah Alone has the right to tell us how to worship Him.*

Allah says: *&quot;Follow what has been sent down to you from your Lord (the
Qur'aan and the Sunnah of Prophet Muhaamd (sallallhu alahi wa-sallam) and
follow not any Auliya (protectors, or helper etc. who order you to associate
partners in worship with Allah), besides Him (Allah)…&quot;* [Soorah Al-Aa'raf
(7): 3]

From the Tafseer (explanation) of this verse, we learn that this verse is a
definite statement, explaining the right of Allah Alone; to reveal and
command His slaves, the manners of worshipping Him. And how could it be
otherwise, when the true meaning of 'Ibaadah' is to worship Allah in the
way, which pleases Him, not following one's own desires. As is known from
the following verse: *&quot;And who is more astray then one who follows his own
lust (desires) without the guidance from Allah (revelation)&quot;* [Soorah
Al-Qasas (28): 50]

In regards to this Prophet Muhammad (sallallahu alahi wa-sallam) said: *&quot;I
warn you of the newly invented matters (in the religion), and every newly
invented matter is an innovation, and every innovation is misguidance, and
every misguidance is in the Hellfire&quot;* [An-Nasa'ee]

And he (sallallahu alahi wa-sallam) used to declare at the beginning of his
lectures, *&quot;….and the best speech is the Speech of Allah, and the best
guidance is the guidance of Muhammad (sallallhu alahi wa-sallam), and the
worst of all affairs are the newly invented matters (in the
religion)&quot;*[Saheeh Muslim]

And he (sallallahu alahi wa-sallam) also commanded us, to reject everything,
which has no basis in the religion saying: *&quot;Whosoever does an action, which
we have not commanded then it must be rejected.&quot;* [Saheeh Muslim]

*&quot;Whosoever introduces into this religion of ours that which is not a part
of it then it must be rejected&quot;* [Musnad Ahmad]

In this Hadeeth is a clear evidence that every action which is not
legislated in the Sharee'ah must be rejected' [Jaami al-Ulum of ibn Rajab
1/120]

Consequently, every Bid'ah, that is introduced in the religion has to be
rejected as for the reason that only Allah and His Messenger (sallallahu
alahi wa-sallam) have the right to legislate in the Sharee'ah.

*The Deen is complete*

Allah says in the Qur'aan:* &quot;This day have I perfected your religion for
you, completed My favour upon you, and have chosen for you Islam as your
religion&quot;* [Soorah Maidah (5): 4]

This verse embodies a clear statement that the religion has been completed
and so has no need of addition and deletion, and our noble Messenger
(sallallahu alahi wa-sallam) said: *&quot;There is nothing that Allah ordered you
with except that I have ordered you with it, and there is nothing that Allah
forbade you from except that I have forbidden you from it&quot;* [al-Bayhaqee and
others]

And he (sallallahu alahi wa-sallam) said, *&quot;There is nothing that will take
you closer to Paradise but that I have enjoined it upon you, and there is
nothing that will take you closer to Hell but that I have warned you from
it&quot;* [Musnad ash-Shafi'e and others]

So, Prophet Muhammad (sallallahu alahi wa-sallam) fulfilled the trust placed
upon him by Allah completely, explaining the religion to the people in it's
inward and outward form, making clear the lawful from the prohibited, the
encouraged from the discouraged, even to the extent that he (sallallahu
alahi wa-sallam) taught us the manners of going to the toilet, the manners
of having sex with our partners etc.

Allah also says in His Book, *&quot;and We have sent down to you Book (the
Qur'aan) as an exposition (explanation) of everything, a guidance, a mercy
and a glad tiding for those who have submitted themselves (to Allah).&quot; *[Soorah
al-Maidah (16): 89]

Hence, Qur'aan contains the explanation of the entire religious principles,
tawheed in all it's various categories, even to the extent that it teaches
us the manners of sitting in circles, visiting other people's houses, the
correct clothing etc. …

*In the light of what has preceded* we can now give the formal Sharee'ah
definition of bid'ah... *&quot;A newly invented way (in beliefs and actions) in
the religion, in imitation of the Sharee'ah, by which nearness to Allah is
sought, not being supported by any authentic proof, neither in it's
foundations nor in the manner in which it is performed.&quot;* [al-I'tisaam 1/231
of ash-Shaatibee]

*Reasons behind the Existence of Bid'ah*

*(a) **IGNORANCE: *Whenever people separate from the True Message, knowledge
will decrease and ignorance will flourish. The Prophet of Allah (sallallahu
alahi wa-sallam) informed us about this adversity when he said: *&quot;Whoever
lives (long) will witness many differences.&quot; *[Abu Dawood]

And he (sallallahu alahi wa-sallam) also said: *&quot;Allah does not erase
knowledge (from earth) by erasing knowledge from slaves (hearts). Rather, He
erases knowledge through the death of scholars. When He leaves (earth)
without scholars, people will take the ignorant as leaders (and scholars).
They (the ignorant) will be asked and then give fatawah without knowledge.
Then, they will be lead, and will lead astray.&quot;* [Ahmad]

People of knowledge are those who fight against Bid'ahs. When knowledge and
scholars disappear from earth, then Bid'ah will see the light. Bid'ah will
then appear and spread.

*(b) FOLLOWING ONE'S OWN DESIRES: *Whoever shuns the Qur'aan and the Sunnah,
and follows his own desires, then pertaining him Allah says: *&quot;But if they
answer you not (O Muhammad (sallallahu alahi wa-sallam) (i.e. do not believe
in your teachings of Islamic Monotheism, nor follow you), then know that
they only follow their own lusts. And who is more astray then one who
follows his own lust (desires) without the guidance from Allah (revelation)&quot;
*[Soorah Al-Qasas (28): 50]

*&quot;Have you seen him who takes his own desires as his god, and Allah knowing
(him as such) left him astray, sealed his hearing and his heart, and put a
cover on his sight. Who then will guide him after Allah.&quot;* [Soorah
Al-Jathiyah (45): 23]

So, following one's own desires leads one to straying away from the Straight
Path and indulging in evil innovation

*(c) BLIND FOLLOWING:* *&quot;When it is said to them: 'Follow peoples opinion
blindly prevents one from following the Straight path. Allah said what
translated means: &quot;Follow what Allah has sent down.&quot; They say: &quot;Nay! We
shall follow what we found our fathers following. Even though their fathers
did not understand anything, nor were they guided.&quot; *[Soorah al-Baqarah(2):
170]

This is the case today with those who blindly follow a Madh-hab. If they are
called to following the Qur'aan and the Sunnah, leaving their traditions,
what opposes them, they claim to follow their own Madh-hab, scholars,
fathers or grandfathers, which leads them to indulge in many evil affairs
known as rituals and traditions, originated from the worst of affairs;
Bid'ahs resulting to the final abode in Hellfire.

*(d) IMITATING THE KUFFAR*: Imitating the Kuffar is what befalls one most in
Bid'ahs, because actions of the Kuffar are built only upon corruption and
misguidance.

Abu Waqid Al-Laithi (sallallahu alahi wa-sallam) said: &quot;We were still new
Muslims when we went to the battle of Hunain with the Prophet (sallallhu
alahi wa-sallam). We found that the Mushrikeen had a tree, called 'That
Anwar', which they revered and on which they hanged their weapons on. When
we passed by a similar Sidrah we said: &quot;O Messenger of Allah (sallallhu
alahi wa-sallam), make for us 'That Anwar' as they have.. Prophet
(sallallahu alahi wa-sallam) said: &quot;Allahu Akbar! It is the Sunnan
(traditions of the Mushrikeen). You said by He Who has my soul in His Hand,
what the children of Israel said to Moses: &quot;Make for us gods as they have
gods. He said: 'Verily! You are a people who know not.&quot; [7:138] and he
(sallallahu alahi wa-sallam) said: You will follow the traditions of those
before you (Jews and Christians)&quot; [at-Tirmidhee]

In this hadeeth, we find that imitating the Kuffar (non-believers) is what
drove Jews (before them), and some of the companions (radhi allahu anhu), to
ask for this ugly matter. They wanted gods to worship and revere other than
Allah. This is the case with the majority of Muslims today, imitating the
disbelievers, which is an opening to ruthless Bid'ahs in Islam.

Bid'ah is more Beloved to Shaytaan than Sinning Sufyaan ath-Thawree
(rahimahullah) said: &quot;Innovations are more beloved to Shaytaan than sin.
Since a sin may be repented from but an innovation is not repented&quot; [Sharh
Usul I'tiqaad of al-Laalikaa'ee (d.414) no.238]

This is because the innovator believes that he is doing something good and
therefore sees no need to repent.

He also said, &quot;…so cling to the original state of affairs&quot; [al-Hilya 6/376]
meaning stick to the way of Muhammad (sallallahu alahi wa-sallam) and
Companions

Imaam Abu Haneefah (rahimahullah) said, &quot;Stick to the narrations and the way
of the salaf, and beware of the newly invented matters for all of it is
innovation&quot; [Sawnul Muntaq of as-Suyutee pg.32]

Imaam Maalik (rahimahullah) said, &quot;He, who innovates an innovation in Islam
regarding it as something good, has claimed that Muhammad (sallallahu alahi
wa-sallam) has betrayed his trust to deliver the message as Allah says:
&quot;This day have I perfected your religion for you, completed My favour upon
you, and have chosen for you Islam as your religion&quot; [Soorah Al-Maidah (5):
4] [al-I'tisaam]

Imaam Ahmad (rahimahullah) said, &quot;The fundamental principles of the sunnah
with us are…avoiding innovations and every innovation is misguidance&quot; [Usul
as-Sunnah of Imaam Ahmad pg.1]

*Bid'ah – Corrupting the Sunnah*

We are taught in the revelation that the Sunnah shall become corrupted and
this corruption would become the norm (custom), so much so that the people
who follow the Sunnah would become as strangers, and those who call to
purifying the sunnah would be slandered and reviled (hated).

The Prophet (sallallahu alahi wa-sallam) said: &quot;Islam began as something
strange, and it shall return as something strange as it began. So (radhi
allahu anhu) give glad tidings to the strangers.&quot; It was asked, &quot;who are the
strangers?&quot; He replied, &quot;Those that purify and correct what the people have
corrupted of my sunnah&quot; [Tabaraanee in al-Kabeer [6/202]

And what is this corruption, it is none other than innovation, introducing
into the pure religion of Allah, new ways of worshipping Him that He has not
taught, blemishing His religion with one's own whims and desires, something
that Allah Himself condemns:

&quot;Or do they have partners with Allah, who have instituted for them a
religion which Allah has not allowed.&quot; [Soorah Ash-Shura (42): 21]

The Companion Abdullaah ibn Mas'ud (radhi allahu anhu) laments: &quot;How will it
be when the trials overcome you, in which the young grow old and the old
grow senile. And the people take the Bid'ah as the sunnah, and when it
changes they say: the sunnah has changed. &quot;It was said: When will this be? O
Abu Abdur Rahmaan!&quot; He replied: When your speakers are many and your
scholars are few, and the wealthy ones are plenty and the trustworthy ones
are few.&quot; [ad-Daarimee]

How true this statement is today, that the innovations have become so
widespread in the religion that the people have taken them to be the Sunnah.
And when the true scholar speaks out against these innovations, he is
labelled as a 'wahhabi' by the people because to them it seems that he is
changing the sunnah. To Allah, we complain of the ignorance of our times!

So, once this topic becomes clear, a truth that none can deny; that all
these innovations in the religions are a clear denial of the above mentioned
verses and ahaadeeth, for none were done by the Companions (radhi allahu
anhu). And in what has preceded is ample evidence for any fair-minded Muslim
that all Bid'ah is blameworthy, and in fact a major sin. But unfortunately,
the Muslims are in such a state today that the Words of Allah and His
Messenger (sallallahu alahi wa-sallam) are no longer enough to convince them
and certain groups of people have come up with belief that has very frail
grounds in the Sunnah. For example, the belief of 'Bid'ah hasanah', i.e. a
good Bid'ah, meaning that a scholar can introduce a new action of worship in
Islam, which can be considered to be good as long it does not contradict any
of the principles of Islam. This belief is completely false and has no basis
in the Qur'aan neither in the Sunnah of our Prophet Muhammad (sallallhu
alahi wa-sallam).

This issue has been discussed in details, under the title &quot;The Arguments of
the Misguided&quot;

*Shunning the Bid'ah - Adherence to the Sunnah *

The cure for shunning these newly invented matters has been specified in the
texts of Qur'aan and the Sunnah: Allah has revealed the religion of Islam
unto Prophet Muhammad (sallallhu alahi wa-sallam), and made adherence to his
way, the cure to misguidance:

*&quot;Say… 'And Verily, this is My Straight Path, so follow it, and follow not
(other) paths, for they will separate you away from this Path.' *[Soorah
An'am (6): 153]

Allah also says in the Qur'aan: &quot;Indeed in the Messenger of Allah, you have
an excellent example to follow for him, who hopes in (the meeting with)
Allah and the Last Day and remembers Allah much&quot; [ (33): 21]

Prophet (sallallahu alahi wa-sallam) said: *&quot;I have left behind me two
things, if you cling to them you will never go astray. They are the Book of
Allah and my Sunnah&quot; *[al-Haakim]

And *&quot;…and you will live to see great difference, so cling to my sunnah and
the sunnah of the rightly guided caliphs after me, even if it be with your
teeth&quot;* [Bukhare]

Abdullaah ibn Mas'ud (radhi allahu anhu) said: &quot;Follow the sunnah of
Muhammad (sallallahu alahi wa-sallam) and do not innovate, for what you have
been commanded is enough for you.&quot; [Ad-Daarimee]

Hudhayfah bin al-Yaman (radhi allahu anhu) said, &quot;every act of worship that
the Companions did not do, do not do it&quot; [Abu Dawood]

The Taabi'ee, the Imaam, az-Zuhree commented, &quot;Clinging to the sunnah is to
be saved&quot; as Imaam Maalik (rahimahillah) said, 'like the Ark of Noah', he
who embarked upon it was saved, and he who did not was destroyed.&quot;
[Ad-Daarimee]

Abu Aaliyah said, &quot;Learn Islam, then when you have learned Islam, do not
turn away from it to the right or to the left. But be upon the Straight Path
and be upon the Sunnah of your Prophet (sallallahu alahi wa-sallam) and that
which his companions were upon…

And beware of these innovations because they cause enmity and hatred amongst
you, but stick to the original state of affairs that was there before they
divided.&quot; [al-Hilya of Abu Nu'aym 2/218]

In these narrations is clear evidence that the way of salvation and safety
is to closely follow the Sunnah of our Prophet (sallallhu alahi wa-sallam),
and not to deviate from his path, denying the guidance of others, not
accepting a corrupted form of the Sunnah.

Allah says: *&quot;And whosoever does not contends with the Messenger after
guidance has been made clear to him, and follows a way other than the way of
the believers, We shall leave in the path he has chosen, and land him in
Hell, what an evil destination!&quot;* [Soorah an-Nisa (4): 115]

*Arguments of the Misguided*

Know, O noble reader! The saying that some Bid'ahs are good and that not
every Bid'ah is a sin, rather some Bid'ahs are good is a clear misguidance.
Every example that these misguided bring from the actions of the companions
(radhi allahu anhu) to prove their belief of a 'good innovation', is invalid
and it just shows their weak understanding of the Sunnah of Muhammad
(sallallhu alahi wa-sallam), for all of these examples have a clear basis in
the Sharee'ah, or occurred due to necessity, or from ijtihaad. Insha'Allah,
we will mention a few of their arguments:

Initially, know that their saying is in opposition to the Hadeeth: &quot;For
every Bid'ah is a sin&quot; [Abu Dawood]

The Prophet of Allah (sallallahu alahi wa-sallam) clearly stated that all
Bid'ahs are sins.

Ibn Rajab says regarding this issue: &quot;The Prophet's (sallallahu alahi
wa-sallam) saying: &quot;every Bid'ah is a sin&quot; is a unique way of speech that
nothing (no Bid'ah) can escape. This is a major rule in this religion. It is
similar to Prophet's (sallallahu alahi wa-sallam) saying: &quot;Whoever
innovates, in this religion of ours, whatever is not of it, is rejected.&quot;

Whoever innovates a matter that has no basis in Islam, and introduced it to
the religion, has sinned. The religion disowns whoever does that. This rule
applies to all matters of belief, action, and saying, both in public or in
secrecy.&quot;

1.When Umar (radhi allahu anhu) was caliph, he collected the Muslims to pray
in congregation for taraaweeh prayers and said, &quot;what a good bid'ah this is&quot;
[Saheeh Bukhaaree]

Evidence is derived from this for 'bid'ah hasanah' (i.e. Good Bid'ah), but
of course they have misunderstood the true intent of Umar (radhi allahu
anhu), which can be clearly understood if one were to quote the context of
this narration.

When the Prophet (sallallahu alahi wa-sallam) first prayed taraaweeh, the
Muslims used to pray taraaweeh individually or in small groups, and then for
three nights they prayed in one congregation behind the Prophet (sallallhu
alahi wa-sallam), and after this he (sallallahu alahi wa-sallam) stopped
them from doing so by saying:

*&quot;&quot;I feared that it would become obligatory upon you.&quot; *So after this again,
the Muslims would pray individually or in small groups, and they remained
like this throughout the rule of Abu Bakr (radhi allahu anhu) and the
beginning of the rule of Umar (radhi allahu anhu). Then Umar (radhi allahu
anhu) came to the Mosque and saw the Muslims praying in small groups and so
gathered them as one jama'ah to pray behind Ubayy bin Ka'b (radhi allahu
anhu) and Tameem ad-Daaree (radhi allahu anhu) and stated the above phrase.
[Reported in Bukhaaree, the Muwatta and others]

*Firstly*: How can the action of Umar (radhi allahu anhu) be considered to
be new when the Prophet (sallallahu alahi wa-sallam) did it in his lifetime?
Not only this but the Muslims were also in the habit of praying in small
groups as well. Hence, the praying of taraaweeh in jamaa'ah was well
established in the sunnah and the practice of the Sahaabah (radhi allahu
anhu).

*Secondly*: The Prophet (sallallahu alahi wa-sallam) gave the reason why he
stopped the congregational prayer, for the revelation was still descending,
and he feared that praying in obligation might become obligatory upon his
nation, and that this might lead to be hard on them.

After the death of Muhammad (sallallhu alahi wa-sallam), the revelation
ceased, and this fear was no longer present. Hence, Umar (radhi allahu anhu)
re-established the congregation during his rule because he knew his action
could not be made obligatory upon the ummah.

*Thirdly*: All the companions agreed to this action of Umar (radhi allahu
anhu), there was a consensus (ijmaa) on this. And the scholars of 'usul'
have stated that a consensus cannot occur except when there is a clear text
for it in the Sharee'ah.

*Fourth*: So how do we understand this statement of Umar (radhi allahu
anhu), &quot;what a good bid'ah this is&quot; when the action that Umar (radhi allahu
anhu) called a bid'ah was done by the Prophet r? Bid'ah here can only be
understood in it's linguistic sense and not in it's Sharee'ah sense i.e.
when Umar (radhi allahu anhu) said this, he did not mean it in the legal
sense that we may understand it today. For how many are the words that mean
one thing in the language, but another thing in the Sharee'ah! The
linguistic sense is: something new, because praying in one congregation was
not present in the rule of Abu Bakr (radhi allahu anhu) and the earlier
period of his own rule.

Hence, Abu Yusuf (rahimahullah) said, &quot;I asked Abu Haneefah (rahimahullah)
about the taraaweeh and what Umar (radhi allahu anhu) did and he replied,
'the taraaweeh is a stressed sunnah, and Umar (radhi allahu anhu) did not do
that from his own opinion, and neither was there in his action any
innovation, and he did not enjoin it except that there was a foundation for
it with him and authorization from the Prophet (sallallahu alahi
wa-sallam)…&quot; ['Sharh Mukhtaar' as quoted from in 'al-Ibdaa' (pg. 80) of
Shaykh Alee Mahfooz]

2.The hadeeth: *&quot;Whosoever starts in Islam a good practice (sunnah), he gets
the reward of it and the reward of all those, who act on it. And whosoever
starts in Islam an evil practice (sunnah), he gets the evil of it and the
evil of all those, who act on it.&quot;* [Saheeh Muslim]

The evidence they derive from this hadeeth is that people can invent new
practices in Islam, either good or bad. But were they to take this hadeeth
in it's full context then it would not be possible to infer such a thing.

Imaam Muslim(rahimahullah) reported this story from Jareer ibn 'Abdullaah
(radhi allahu anhu) who also narrated: &quot;Some people came to Prophet
(sallallahu alahi wa-sallam) wearing woollen garments. He (sallallahu alahi
wa-sallam) saw that they were in bad shape and in desperate need, so he
(sallallahu alahi wa-sallam) urged the people to give them charity. People
were very slow to respond, and it could be seen on his face (that he was
upset). Then a man of the Ansaar brought a package of silver, then another
came, then after him another and another, and his face was filled with joy.
He (sallallahu alahi wa-sallam) said: 'Whoever starts a good thing in Islam,
and others do likewise after him, there will be written for him a reward
like that of those who followed him, without detracting it in the least from
their reward. Whoever starts a bad thing in Islam, and others do likewise
after him, there will be written for him a burden of sin like that of those
who followed him, without detracting it in the least from their burden.&quot;
[Saheeh Muslim, no. 1017]

*Firstly:* The word 'sunnah' used in the hadeeth must be understood in it's
linguistic sense (i.e. practice) not it's sharee'ah sense (i.e. the life
example of Muhammad (sallallhu alahi wa-sallam) because otherwise it would
imply that there is something bad in the sunnah.

*Secondly:* The Companion (radhi allahu anhu) who gave charity, did not do
anything new, for giving charity had been legislated from the very early
days of Islam as the Makkan surahs prove, rather he was simply implementing
a previously legislated matter. So, the statement of the Prophet (sallallhu
alahi wa-sallam), 'a good sunnah' was said at a time when the people were
reluctant to give charity, so one man gave it and then others followed him -
i.e. he renewed a sunnah that was being neglected - this is the meaning of
'good practice' - renewing an existing sunnah.

Hence, we do not stick just to the specific occurrence in the hadeeth, but
we generalize it's intent as it's wording is general and as is established
in the 'usul'. The intent of this hadeeth is renewing the Sunnah when it has
been neglected. This is why the early scholars of Islam included this
hadeeth under the chapter 'The reward of the one who renews the sunnah&quot; [as
done by the 4th century Imaam al-Laalikaa'ee in his encyclopedic work
detailing the belief of Ahlus Sunnah, 'Sharh Usul I'tiqaad Ahlus Sunnah wal
Jamaa'ah']

*Thirdly:* The meaning of 'bad sunnah' is to be understood in the similar
vein, i.e. the one who renews an evil act, will get it's evil… Prophet
(sallallahu alahi wa-sallam) gave the example of the two sons of Adam
(alaihi as-salaam), one killing the other, one who killed got the sin of his
action as well the sin of all those who follow hi in killing; without their
sins decreasing, an killing had been forbidden from the time of the first
Prophet (alahi as-salaam) to the last r

*Fourthly:* The hadeeth uses the terms 'good' and 'bad', and from what has
preceded, it is clear that Islam has already defined in it's totality all
that it is good and bad, and if we were to say otherwise, we would then be
accusing the religion of incompleteness and deficiency

*Some Common Innovations*

Imitating the Kuffar nowadays has resulted in many Bid'ah's. Prophet
(sallallahu alahi wa-sallam) said: &quot;You will follow the ways of those who
were before you. (Jews and Christians)&quot;[At-Tirmidhee] Some common Bid'ah
today in the Ummah are:

*Al-Mawlid* - Celebrating the Prophet's (sallallahu alahi wa-sallam)
birthday The practice of celebrating al-Mawlid (Prophet's birthday) on the
12th day of Rabee' al-Awwal each Hijri year, has no basis in the Qur'aan and
the Sunnah, rather this celebration is an imitation of the Christians,
resembling their celebration of Prophet Jesus's (alahi as-salaam) birthday,
invented in the 4th century of Hijrah through the Shites This practice is
known and performed as a sign of one's love for the Messenger of Allah
(sallallhu alahi wa-sallam). Although, the Qur'aan has enlightened the issue
of loving and establishing the love of the Messenger (sallallahu alahi
wa-sallam) in a differing way: Allah says: *&quot;Say (O Muhammad (sallallhu
alahi wa-sallam): 'If you (really) love Allah, then follow me, Allah will
love you and forgive you your sins. And Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most
Merciful.&quot;*

This verse clarifies the fact that the love of the Prophet (sallallahu alahi
wa-sallam) is merely a claim unless the proof of sincerity is exposed, which
is to submit and abide to the laws and commands of Allah, revealed to
Prophet Muhammad (sallallhu alahi wa-sallam). In accordance to the above
mentioned verse, one who claims to loves the Prophet (sallallhu alahi
wa-sallam), then it is for him to obey his (sallallahu alahi wa-sallam)
commands and follow his (sallallahu alahi wa-sallam) Sunnah, for Allah says:
&quot;whatsoever the Messenger gives you, take it, and whatsoever he forbids you,
abstain from it&quot; [(59): 7]

And according to the Sunnah of Prophet (sallallhu alahi wa-sallam),
exaggerating his (sallallahu alahi wa-sallam) position in calling upon him
as is done in these celebrations is not only against his saying but indeed
Shirk. Allah says: &quot; invoke not anyone along with Allah.&quot; [(72): 18]

And he (sallallahu alahi wa-sallam) said: &quot;Do not exaggerate about me, as
the Christians exaggerated about the son of Maryam. I am only a slave, so
say &quot;the slave and Messenger of Allah (sallallahu alahi wa-sallm)&quot; [Bukhari]

Celebrating al-Mawlid even if it does not hold calling upon the Prophet
(sallallahu alahi wa-sallam) and other sorts of sins; like the mingling of
men and women, singing, narrating poems about the Prophet (sallallhu alahi
wa-sallam), which contain undeserved praise of the Prophet etc… is an
innovation, since this practice as mentioned earlier is not a part of the
religion, neither Prophet Muhammad (sallallhu alahi wa-sallam), nor his
Companions (radhi allahu anhu) are known to have commemorated this
celebration. Rather, when Prophet Muhammad (sallallahu alahi wa-sallam) was
asked about fasting on Mondays, he (sallallahu alahi wa-sallam) said: &quot;That
is the day on which I was born and the day on which, I was entrusted with
the Mission or when I was first given Revelation.&quot; [Saheeh Muslim]

Consequently, one who claims to love the Prophet (sallallahu alahi
wa-sallam) and truly thankful to Allah, then according to what has preceded,
he must celebrate the birthday of Prophet Muhammad (sallallahu alahi
wa-sallam) as he (sallallahu alahi wa-sallam) himself did.

*Revering (Tabarruk) from certain places or personal effects Tabarruk* means
to ask for blessing, by means of which a thing is preserved and protected
and increases in goodness. Tabarruk can be asked to Allah Alone, for He is
the One who sends down the Barakah and preserves it. Companions (radhi
allahu anhu) of Prophet (radhi allahu anhu) used to seek Barakah of Allah by
the hairs of Prophet Muhammad (sallallhu alahi wa-sallam), and his personal
effects. This special status is only for the Prophet and only during his
lifetime. After his death, none of his companions (radhi allahu anhu)
carried out such practice, to seek Barakah from certain places, people or
thing is prohibited and considered Shirk. To believe that Barakah can be
reached if one visits or touches certain thing, place or people, or Allah
grants Barakah if one visiting some certain thing, place or people is a way
to Shirk. From these are hanging, kissing or wearing certain Qur'aanic
verses for Barakah, using charms amulets etc..

*Bid'ah in Matters of Worship *The religion of Islam is 'Tawqifiyah'. No
worship can be enacted that has no proof in the religion, as the Prophet
(sallallahu alahi wa-sallam) said: &quot;Whoever does what is not of our matter
then it is rejected.&quot; [Muslim]

*From the many Bid'ah in worship are the following: *To converse the Niyyah
(intention). It is a very common practice to converse the niyyah in
preparation for prayer, like the saying &quot;I intend to pray for Allah such and
such rakah…&quot; This act is a Bid'ah, for intention is a matter of the heart
and not the tongue and moreover it has no proof from the Qur'aan and the
Sunnah. Rather, Allah says: &quot;Say: 'Will you inform Allah about your
religion? While Allah knows all that is in the heavens and all that is in
the earth and Allah is all-Aware of everything.&quot; [(49): 16]

A type of Bid'ah in worship is to recite Fatihah in times of celebration or
death, hiring people to recite the Qur'aan if death comes to someone,
celebrating Israa wa Al-Miraj (ascension of Prophet (sallallhu alahi
wa-sallam) and Hijrah. Also from these is to perform Umrah specifically in
the lunar month of Rajab, Rajab is an ordinary month, there are no special
Umrah, prayer or fast in this month, also form these is to specify prayer
during the middle night of Sha'baan and to fast during the 15th of this
month. Major Bid'ah are building monuments on graves, making graves as
mosques, and visiting graves for Baraqah. All these celebrations are not
valid in the Shar'iah

And we leave you with the hadeeth of the Prophet (sallallhu alahi
wa-sallam), *&quot;….so he follows my sunnah has been guided, and he who follows
the innovations has been destroyed.&quot;* [Ahmad]
