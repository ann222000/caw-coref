even though i know the commonly accepted story - Paul held them
together and pushed for it.  i just wonder how in the hell they really
were able to finish Abbey Road, or even face each other after the mess
that was Let It Be.

It just seems there would have been such bad blood it probably was like
Paul, DRAGGING them into the studio.  I would have liked being a fly on
the wall for those last sessions.

I think the re-appearance of Geroge Martin had a lot to do with it.

While you read a lot about Yoko at the Let it Be sessions, you don' hear
much about her at the Abbey Road sessions.  If she stayed away more often,
or just kept in the background while she was there, that would have helped,
too.

I think you hit the nail on the head on both possible reasons, Kurt.
It could also be that they knew it was the beginning of the end and
wanted to make one last great album before they called it quits.  At

John arrived late for the Abbey Road sessions, as since he had poor vision
and zero driving acumen, he had crashed a car in Scotland with Yoko, Julian,
and Kyoko in tow, whilst visiting his relatives.  John and Yoko were
hospitalized, thus arriving late for the recording sessions.

Since Yoko was still convalescing, on their return to London, John and Yoko
had a large bed brought right into Studio 2 for Yoko, who stayed in this bed
during her convalescence, during the Abbey Road sessions, and had a
microphone placed above the bed in order to give orders.

Not only was she not in the background, she was right there with a
microphone, in a bed, in Studio 2.

Agree with the upbeat nature having been helped by their realization that
&quot;this is it&quot;, and George Martin back.

They should release an accompanying CD

I suspect George agreed to it because he had a couple of powerhouse songs
that rivaled anything of Lennon McCartney. Getting them on a Beatles album
would help straighten history out as to his importance in the group.

Ringo is a very agreeable fellow and it is not surprising he would agree to
it.

As to John, he just wasn't ready yet to make the final break, I guess.

Not exactly a big leap of faith, considering they've said themselves
that's pretty much exactly what happened.

It would be much more appropriate to call it 'the end of the end',
though. The beginning of it was looooooong before that. At times they've
claimed it can be traced back as far as Rubber Soul.

The bed thing must have been really short lived...like if you blink
you missed it.

We were in Studio 2 as much as they were for much of that
time...trading off session time...and I never saw a bed there;)

They also appeared in fine spirts, walking down the halls together

This is one of the great mysteries of show-business, Cal. I think they
were able to do it because they were fucking great. That's all. They
pulled [arguably] the greatest record of their careers out of their
friggin' azzholes. One of the best fucking rock and roll records of
all time, in fact. No one could have done it but them.

The commonly accepted story is crap.

It was George Martin who took control of the Abbey Road recording
and sheparded that project to a success.  It marked the first time,
since the Sgt. Pepper sessions, where George Martin had been at
the
center of the Beatles recording activities.   After the Sgt. Pepper
album,
and also after the death of Brian Epstein, The Beatles tried to do
too
much themselves and the result was the failed Magical Mystery Tour
film project, the haphazard and individualistic &quot;White Album&quot;, the
failed &quot;Get Back&quot;/&quot;Let It Be&quot; film project, and the near ending of
the group at that point.

Paul did not drag the others into the studio.  Instead, he called
George Martin and assured Martin that Martin would be given
control.
That was the thing that made it attractive again both to Martin
and
also to John and George who then didn't have to worry about
McCartney trying to make it be something all about him
(like the &quot;Let It Be&quot; film and period).

When you listen to Abbey Road, it is a case where I think Martin,
glad to be at the helm again,  had even &quot;overproduced&quot; it in
places.
For example,  George's song  &quot;Something&quot; is covered with the type
of smear-y,  pop-y,  string section that is uncharacteristic of
Martin's
earlier work with The Beatles.

The Beatles soft ballads had always sounded more appealing than
other
band's music, because Martin would use tasteful backings that
consisted of
just a few cellos or violas here and there, and not cover up their
songs with
a lot of orchestrated mush (typical of pop music).

But Abbey Road project worked because of the direction and
management
coming from Martin, and the band had that extra confidence that it
was not
going to turn into another &quot;Let It Be Ugly&quot; type of scene as a
result.

After the album, John went to do a live concert (with Eric Clapton)
in Toronto
called the Toronto Peace Festival.   After the success of playing
'live' again with
another band, and his success with his &quot;Give Peace A Chance&quot;
single
(a song that he could not have released as an A-side with the
Beatles),
John decided the time was right to go solo and end the band.   He
told the
others in the fall of 1969, that the group was over and that he
wanted a divorce.

The &quot;Let It Be&quot; project had been scrapped and was not released at
that point.
But they agreed to try and salvage that effort and put out some
packaging
for the public of it, realizing no more Beatles material was going
to occur.

But chronologically, the Beatles had ended on a high note with
Abbey Road.

It is well known that Martin did not have as much control over the
&quot;White Album&quot; project.  Martin, for example, had wanted to make
a single album and not a double album out of all of that recorded
material.  The Beatles overruled him and many of the songs were
produced by either John or Paul.   Lennon even commented on
&quot;staying up for 19 hours with Paul putting the White Album together&quot;
which was probably a reference to the final mix and cut of the
album.
Martin had been involved in certain songs, but he had far less of
a management role and impact than he had for many of their other
albums.

Total crap.

The reason why Abbey Road sounds so &quot;together&quot; is
because it was really was a complete, total-band effort,
with George Martin calling the shots.

George &amp; John were tired of Paul's antics and would
not have even gone back into another &quot;Let It Be&quot; situation
at that point.

glad to be at the helm again,  had even &quot;overproduced&quot; it in
places.    For example,  George's song  &quot;Something&quot; is covered
with the type of smear-y,  pop-y,  string section that is
uncharacteristic of Martin's earlier work with The Beatles.

The Beatles soft ballads had always sounded more appealing
than other band's music, because Martin would use tasteful
backings that consisted of just a few cellos or violas here and
there, and not cover up their songs with a lot of orchestrated
mush (typical of pop music).

But Abbey Road project worked because of the direction
and management coming from Martin, and the band had that
extra confidence that it was not going to turn into another
&quot;Let It Be Ugly&quot; type of scene as a result.

After the album, John went to do a live concert (with Eric
Clapton)
in Toronto called the Toronto Peace Festival.   After the success
of playing 'live' again with another band, and his success with
his &quot;Give Peace A Chance&quot; single (a song that he could not have
released as an A-side with the Beatles),  John decided the time
was right to go solo and end the band.   He told the
others in the fall of 1969, that the group was over and that he
wanted a divorce.

The &quot;Let It Be&quot; project had been scrapped and was not released
at that point.  But they agreed belatedly to try and salvage that
effort and put out some packaging of it for the public, realizing
that no more Beatles material was going to occur.

But chronologically, the Beatles had ended on a high note
with Abbey Road.

That's an excellent point. The addition of Billy Preston undoubtably
had a positive effect at the Apple sessions, beginning Jan. 21, and
the band continued to work on some of the tracks after the film
cameras had left the studio. The blowup between Paul and George
(though actually directed at John) occured within the first week of
January.

The Apple sessions are far happier in spirit than the Twickenham.

I'll jump in before having read donz's next reply, but - you're mixed
up Derek - his point was that George Martin, regardless of how much or
little influence and control, he had on the White Album over all,  DID
arrange the strings and orchestra on &quot;Good Night.&quot;  (Personally I
think he did a great job and the treatment was more than appropriate -
the jazzy harmonic sophistication just makes the song much more
interesting and enjoyable, IMO, and truer to its platonic ideal
realization, than it would have been as some kind of minimalist
acoustic-guitar type track.)

Tom, what a wonderful experience!  I finally got the chance to read through
you're web site, and I'm absolutely envious :-)  It's funny you mention The
Hollies and The Moody Blues (as well as the Beatles of course); I hear a lot
of influence from these two bands in the music.

I too was in a band around that time (a little earlier, perhaps) that
eventually got to the point where we might have seriously considered such an
adventure, but several things got in the way.  First, when we reached that
point, the group's bass player and I basically decided it was more important
to emphasize our education when the demands of the group began taking up an
enormous portion of our time.  Second, we never had anyone who played the
role for us that your mother does in your story.  We never had the nerve to
push ourselves that way alone.

Finally, and probably most importantly, we didn't *quite* have the talent
that's obvious in your recordings.

Thanks for sharing  your story!

I should have clarified: I originally taped these (and other) radio
broadcasts onto reel-to-reel. In 1984, I dubbed these reel-to-reel
moments onto another reel-to-reel in order to collate everything

It was Wednesday night, April 19, 1967, around 11:30 PM on WBZ in
Boston; the 8 PM-11:30 deejay, Bruce Bradley, was chatting with the
11:30PM-6AM all-night deejay, whose name I have listed here only as
&quot;O,&quot; subbing for regular all-nighter Dick Summer. (It might be
&quot;O'Reilly,&quot; but that's just a wild guess.)

They exchanged short, informal patter -- it varied each night, the
passing of the on-air baton -- and, without any warning, or tease, &quot;A
Day in the Life&quot; suddenly aired. With the full guitar intro (no fade-
in from the Reprise). During the intro, Bradley declared something
like, &quot;the Beatles&quot; (I'll have to dig out the tape for his exact
quote, but I do remember that he did a short v/o). The song played,
then &quot;O&quot; recapped the new release. That's all I have on tape for this
night.

The following evening, Jefferson Kaye at WKBW in Buffalo aired the
song. And WBZ put it in heavy rotation that Thursday night, playing it
once every hour. (I don't have the KBW air, but I do have a vivid
memory of the station broadcasting it that night -- this was big, big
stuff to a 16-year-old Beatlemaniac, who immediately made dubs for
friends that weekend.)

Bruce Bradley's WBZ Friday evening show had been taped earlier that
same day, and throughout the tape, Bruce had repeatedly promoted more
broadcasts of the song. But, mysteriously, while the broadcast on
Friday night had him promising more airings, listeners never heard &quot;A
Day in the Life&quot; that night.

It was the following Tuesday, April 25, when Bruce explained what had
happened: Sometime between his Friday afternoon (or morning) taping
and his Friday evening broadcast, the station had received a &quot;cease-
and-desist&quot; order from, it was claimed, Capitol Records. So even
though references to the song remained on the tape, the song itself
was edited out -- several times, for the broadcast.

WBZ never aired the song again until the Pepper promotional LPs got
into their hands in late May.

Meanwhile, in Buffalo, WKBW had received a similar &quot;cease-and-desist&quot;
order, again, presumably from Capitol. So the station also immediately
removed the song from its playlist.

Two years ago, while researching the earliest &quot;Get Back&quot; bootlegs with
John Winn (the findings published in his book &quot;Lifting Latches&quot; and
summarized by me in this newsgroup in another thread from then), I had
managed to track down Jefferson Kaye, the deejay who was the first to
air &quot;A Day in the Life&quot; on KBW in Buffalo. Kaye had become the
station's program director by September 1969, and he had played an
integral role in securing the &quot;Get Back&quot; tape that the station had
aired the weekend of September 21 (two days before WBCN's first
broadcast of an entirely different &quot;Get Back&quot; tape).

But I digress...

After he told me what he remembered about the &quot;Get Back&quot; caper, I
asked him about the &quot;Day in the Life&quot; broadcasts. He recalled it well:
after the cease-and-desist order arrived, the song was banned from
further air. But sometime later (I don't have a time frame for this),
the station had determined that the cease-and-desist letter had been
written and sent from a rival Buffalo radio station, not Captiol!

So, Jeff says, WKBW put the song back on the playlist. My own logs
from that time show no broadcasts, but that means nothing; I likely
missed them while listening to another station or -- watch for it --
actually havng a life.

Finally, I asked Jeff how KBW had gotten the &quot;Day in the Life&quot; tape to
begin with. &quot;Captiol! They sent it to us!&quot; he said.

Whether WBZ's cease-and-desist order was likewise bogus, sent by a
competing Boston station, remains a mystery. I contacted Dick Summer
during the &quot;Get Back&quot; research; he says that the station usually
received &quot;pre-release&quot; Beatles material from a deejay in NYC, but he
had no recollection of whether that might have been the case with &quot;A
Day in the Life.&quot; Nor can he remember whether the cease-and-desist
order had been determined to be real or fake.

All I do remember is that the song was never played again on WBZ until
Pepper. This I know with more certainty than KBW only because WBZ was
my primary listening.

The deejay at WBCN who first aired the &quot;Get Back&quot; tape on September
23, 1969, gave me some history of the relationship between the Boston
radio stations and Capitol's regional representative: it was always a
cat-and-mouse adventure they all played, but it was never &quot;serious,&quot;
legally. Everyone knew the game. Capitol was always two steps behind,
always playing catch-up with what the stations had already aired
before they were supposed to.

It'd be fun to get more definitive answers to all this, but that's all
I got, for now.

Great stuff donz5...!!!

I lived in Quincy at that time...though I was getting ready to go into the
Navy in May of '67.

I never heard A DAY IN THE LIFE till I came home from bootcamp, and then, it
was in the back of a taxicab heading back to Logan Airport, heading to
Seattle, and then to Viet Nam. As I sat in the back seat, ADitL came
on...WOW! To me and the driver, the orchestral orgasm sounded like a jet
plane...I believe Tom Hartman heard it that way too first time he heard it!

Yeah! Well, it was a big world, and the hormones were raging...so I wanted
to see it and fuck it! The '60s were my young life's soundtrack...and what a

I spent three tours of duty in Viet Nam...jet mechanic. I'm relatively sane,
though I have been accused of being out of my mind by friends. They let me
sign my own checks, I can still hold the Crayolas in my hands, and I'm
pretty good at running around in circles! Recently, I have had a few
*senior* moments, but otherwise I'm still present and accounted for, though
occasionally I get lost in space.

&gt; though I have been accused of being out of my mind by friends. They let me
&gt; sign my own checks, I can still hold the Crayolas in my hands, and I'm
&gt; pretty good at running around in circles! Recently, I have had a few
&gt; *senior* moments, but otherwise I'm still present and accounted for, though
&gt; occasionally I get lost in space.

It sounds like you ended up in better shape than we stateside
wusses. :)

No better than most. What doesn't kill you makes you stronger. So they say.
