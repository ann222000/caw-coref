Life risked to speak the truth

CALGARY -- When I met Russian journalist Anna Politkovskaya in 2002 to
discuss her new book about Chechnya, Dirty War, I began by asking her about
life in Moscow.

She brusquely interrupted me, "Please, I am here to speak only of Chechnya."

The 48-year-old Russian journalist told me her days were numbered. She was
murdered last week in Moscow.

At a time when too many journalists have become clapping seals for
governments or their employer's party line, Politkovskaya risked her life to
report the truth.

She exposed massive human rights violations and economic crimes being
committed by Russian forces against independence-seeking Chechen people.

She was among a handful of Russian journalists who dared cover the brutal
war in the Caucasus, fearlessly reporting it in her crusading newspaper,
Novaya Gazeta, one of the last free voices in Russia's mostly
government-controlled media.

But because of mounting death threats against her and her two children,
Politkovskaya told me she had regretfully decided to seek political asylum
in Austria. Since 1996, 23 Russian journalists have been murdered for
reporting on Chechnya and domestic crimes.

But this hero journalist could not stay silent about the slaughter in
Chechnya. She challenged head-on the news blackout Moscow imposed on this
forgotten and largely invisible conflict.

I knew what she went through. While covering the 1980s war in Afghanistan, I
learned the Soviets and Afghan Communists had put a contract out to kill me
as part of their effort to stop Western journalists from reporting on the
war.

Politkovskaya returned to Russia, and continued to cover Chechnya in spite
of more death threats and an attempt to poison her. She was about to come
out with a critical new book about Russia's leader, Vladimir Putin, and
crimes being committed in Chechnya.

A contract killer murdered Politkovskaya outside her Moscow apartment. The
consensus in Moscow points the finger of suspicion at Chechnya's
Moscow-installed puppet ruler, Ramzan Kadyrov, a brutal Chechen warlord.

Her murder was another sign that Russia is still dominated by its security
organs and ruthless gangsters.

By now, Moscow has mostly crushed the life out of Chechnya's 1.5 million
people. These tough Muslim mountaineers have battled Russian rule for 400
years. During the Second World War, Stalin attempted genocide by sending 60%
of all Chechens to concentration camps.

In 1999, as the Soviet Union was crumbling, the Chechen people, like
Ukrainians and Baltics, declared independence. Russian leader Boris Yeltsin
sent his army to crush Chechen independence. The elected Chechen president,
Jhokar Dudayev, was assassinated, thanks to electronic locating gear
reportedly supplied to Moscow's secret police by the CIA.

Chechen fighters, in one of modern history's most remarkable and valiant
feats, defeated Russian invasion forces. In the process, the Russians killed
100,000 or more Chechen civilians.

The world turned its back on this massacre. President Bill Clinton hailed
Yeltsin as "the Abraham Lincoln of Russia. The world bought Moscow's claim
that Chechen independence fighters were "Islamic terrorists."

Russia invaded a second time and slowly crushed the Chechen. Journalists and
aid workers who sought to report this second genocide were killed or
kidnapped.

Some of the remaining few Chechen fighters were driven to desperate acts of
terrorism, like the school hostage-taking at Beslan. But Moscow relentlessly
ground the life out of Chechen resistance.

The world turned its back on the Chechen people and their struggle for
freedom. But Anna Politkovskaya did not. She spoke for those who had no
voice.

She refused to be intimidated and fought to her last breath against
injustice.
