My new WHR-HP-G54s have burned in for ~ 2 weeks and seem to be working
without problems.

I've been all over the DD-WRT and wiki site trying to figure out how to do
the deed of safely installing the correct DD-WRT software in the first of
these with out building a yellow brick road.

I'm quite confused by the acronyms, buzz words and cross references to other
protocols and documents.

So far I've come to the conclusion I need dd-wrt.v23_sp2_standard.zip

The first application will be as an wireless AP and wire 4 port router.
(only 2 or 3 ports will likely ever be used).

The second application will be as a client/router with four ports (I'm
assuming this is possible/practical).

Once I manage to gain a (very) fundamental understanding of these two
options
I'm planning on playing other games just to see what these toys can do.

I'm at a total loss on how to proceed and would appreciate any and all
information/links on how to get from point A to point B.  Nice if I had a
dummy's list of all important stopping points on the way as well as what
other hardware I should consider for the process.

My OS are XP and Mac OS10.2 (for reasons of family harmony I prefer to avoid
using the OS 10)

TIA

Just got mine up and working, too. I'm using it as an AP to an existing LAN
(my mom's broadband next door). I ran the cat 5 and then used the air
station to make an AP. Works good. I too, need the info on how to upgrade.
Maybe  Jeff will respond.

Bah.  It's very easy, but you gotta have rhythm.  The only cerimony
that works the first time is TFTP.  Here are the exact instructions
for doing it under Windoze.  Read carefully:
&lt; http://www.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/Installation#TFTP_Flashing_Buffa... &gt;
The only trick is knowing exactly when to hit &lt;enter&gt; after the tftp
command problem.  There's a narrow window between about 2-3 seconds
after you apply power that's only about 2 seconds wide.  Count to 3
slowly after applying power, and hit enter.  If you get a weird error
message, unplug the router, and try again with a slightly different
delay.  Whatever you do, don't abort in the middle of an upload.

I haven't tried the batch file trick, but it looks quite good and
should work.

After you've successfully installed DD-WRT, subsequent updates can be
easily done from the web based menu and do not require TFTP.  Update
also preserve the settings so you don't have to reload everything from
scratch.  Still, it's best to make backups of your settings just in
case something goes wrong, goes wrong, goes wrong, goes wrong...

The only sure way I know how to &quot;brick&quot; it is to use the wrong version
firmware.  I suggest generic Broadcom v23 SP3 NoKaid (not standard),
which is in the &quot;beta&quot; directory.  This week, I've been using:
&lt; http://www.dd-wrt.com/dd-wrtv2/down.php?path=downloads%2Fbeta%2FGENER... &gt;
Dated 7/13/2007.  Watch out for the directory dates as they're in
European format.  It's also easy to get mixed up in the mini, micro,
standard, etc versions.  You want an image that's 3.2Mbytes big.

I'm sympathetic.  Wireless is like a loaf of bread.  You eat it best
in small bites.  Try to eat the whole thing at once, and you'll choke.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

">

Close.  I prefer the bleeding edge which is SP3.  You probably won't
have any use for Kaid, which is a Xbox game server.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

No problem.  That's fairly basic.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;assuming this is possible/practical).
">

Sure.  Ports are easy.  If you run out of ports, just add an ethernet
switch.  You can do some tricky routing and VLAN things with the
ethernet ports on the DD-WRT router, but that will be later.

Well, Learn By Destroying(tm) is my motto.  You haven't learned
anything about routers until you've totally trashed one, and had to
punch reset to recover, while the wife and kids are screaming at your
to get it back online.

I guess just blunder your way through the Wiki at:
&lt; http://www.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/Main_Page &gt;
There's lots of good things under there.  If there's something you
find confusing, punch the buzzword into the search box and see what
pops up.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Those exist and are called FAQ's.  Methinks it would be best if you
started at the top at:
&lt; http://www.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/What_is_DD-WRT%3F &gt;
and just went through the list of features to get familiar with the
buzzwords.  Then, the regular install and setup instructions should be
more comprehensible.

I just want to reinforce what Jeff said.  Use those links for flashing
via tftp.  I actually just copy and paste the command lines directly
from the wiki into my command line window on XP.

Two comments-

- when you save the downloaded .bin image (dd-wrt.v23_sp2_standard is
fine, you want the .bin version) save it directly to your C drive to
make it easy for the tftp to find.

- Getting the timing right, as Jeff said, can be tricky, but the
consequences of wrong timing are null.  You can try again as many
times as you want.  The important thing is not to reboot the router
prematurely once it takes the flash.  Wait and wait.  As long as you
have seen a confirmation in the tftp dialog that the transfer took and
as long as you wait a looong time (5 minutes?), then the risk seems to
be very low.

Argh.  I forgot about that.  Thanks.

When the flash upload is done and everything is allegedly working
properly, it will display a button that says &quot;restart&quot;.  Do NOT punch
the button with the mouse.  Don't do anything with the router.  Just
walk away for at least 3 minutes.  What happens is that there's
something going on with the NVRAM flash after it's done uploading.  I
don't know what.  Probably copying from RAM to flash.  I've had flash
image corruption after an upload if I hit the &quot;restart&quot; button too
soon.  It's probably only about 30-45 seconds, but it was much longer
in the past, and I'm paranoid.  The v23 SP3 flash screen now says &quot;may
take up to 300 seconds&quot; or something similar.
