I'm sure that Alfa dealers have an official way of doing it. I take it that
the remote won't silence it  ???

If it were me I would remove the battery and use some jump leads to
re-connect while it sat on floor. Then deafen yourself again when you put it
back.

I asked the alfa dealers and they said there is no way to disable it... yeah
right like they just let an alarm go off when doing a large change !

My last ditch option is to jump lead the battery on the ground when removed.
But I was concious that if they hit the body work and short somthing out...

I cannot beleive thier is no override...

Did you get a little 'cylindrical' key with the car?

If so, there's a lock barrel in the fuse box that operates a switch to
disable the alarm.

What he said.  There would also be a battery in the alarm itself, which you
could remove, if you could get to it.  Or just let it sound until it runs
down....

IIRC, this may be something to do with the Thatcham Class 1 category
requirements in the UK. My car (an import) doesn't appear to have a
disabling device but the alarm doesn't go off when the battery is
disconnected. It wouldn't surprise me if Class 1 required the alarm to
go off when the battery is disconnected and, also, required that there
be no user device to permanently disable it. This would explain the
dealer position. It's all to do with getting the insurance group as
low as possible.

Failing that theory, there's the usual caveat that your car may have
been wired in Italy..on a Friday!

Thanks for all your suggestions,

I eventually decided to jump lead the batter after I took it out... Seemed
to work a treat but I cannot beleive this is what alfa would do...

and electrical technician has heard of a device that can be plugged into the
ciggerette lighter that stops the alarm going off on a disconnected
battery - but that sould a little pie in the sky to me...

thanks again...

No no..surely Saturdays and Sundays are when owners puzzle over/fix
what Italians did Monday to Friday?  :(

My alarm has never gone off when I've disconnected the battery and
being a UK spec, it doesn't have anyway of disabling the alarm via a
switch ...

Something very odd with yours Domestos .....

Domestos - plugging a 12V supply into your cigarette lighter is directly
equivalent to the trick with the jump leads. It fools the alarm into
thinking that the battery is still connected. The current drawn from the
main battery by the alarm is very small and can be provided with a small
battery or DC supply with a cigarette lighter plug attached. You would of
course have to make sure everything on the car was switched off ( lights,
radio etc.) otherwise the alternative supply would try to power them.
