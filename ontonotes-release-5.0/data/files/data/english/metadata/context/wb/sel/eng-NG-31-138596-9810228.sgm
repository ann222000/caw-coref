Plateau sacks varsity VC, lecturers
By Jude Owuamanam, Jos
Published: Saturday, 8 Dec 2007

The Plateau State Government has sacked the pioneer Vice-Chancellor of the
state-owned institution, Plateau State University, Bokkos â€“ Prof. John Wade,
as well as all the academic and non-academic staff of the institution.

Wade's sack was contained in a letter with reference no. S/SSG/E/60/Vol.
iv/642 dated November 26, 2007 and signed by the Secretary to the State
Government, Mr. Bukar Bello.

The letter asking the VC to disengage all staff was referenced
S/SSG/E/60/Vol. iv/643, dated November 26 and also signed by Bello .

Jang had on September 10 ordered the suspension of academic activities in
the new institution following the recommendations of an administrative panel
led by Prof. Dakum Shown.

But following outcry from a cross section of the society, including the
students, the state government set up a technical committee headed by a
former Vice-Chancellor of the University of Jos, Prof. Nenfort Gomwalk. The
committee was saddled with the task of examining all aspects relating to the
setting up and administration of the institution.

However, before the committee could submit its report, the state government
sacked all the staff of the institution and also asked the vice chancellor
to go back to where he was coming from.

Saturday Punch gathered that the government is likely to ask the authorities
of the University of Jos, to absorb the students on part time basis, if it
had already filled its approved National Universities Commission's quota. It
also plans to make the university a campus of UNIJOS.

Consequently, the state government, it was gathered has asked UNIJOS to
compute the monetary implications of both exercises.

The move to make PLASU a campus of UNIJOS, it was further gathered was
arrived at after a committee set up by the institution's VC, Prof Sonny
Tyoden, had discovered that it was not possible for the school to absorb all
the students.

The chairman of the technical committee, Prof. Nenfort Gomwalk, told
Saturday Punch that he was not aware of the VC's sack. He also said that his
committee was yet to submit its report on the university.

Gomwalk said that he would not be able to make further comments as he was
scheduled to have a meeting with the Deputy Governor, Mrs. Pauline Tallen,
who also doubles as the commissioner for education.
