A Very Special Human Being - Mother Teresa

Who has not heard of her. This nun has touched countless of hearts,
one way or another, mostly good. I am not a Christian (Islam's my
faith). However in some ways, this special nun touched my heart too.
Included here are some of her words. Rest In Peace Mother Teresa. May
GOD Bless you.

Mother Theresa did not judge a person's Faith, Color of thier
skin....She LOVED people.

I would like to see one Athiest Woman who has touched more hearts
around the world the way
Mother Theresa has. Id like to see one Athiest Woman who has feed,
comforted 1/2 the people
Mother Theresa has.

Seriously, I bought the video but I haven't watched it yet.

I would have no problem doing the video (except I don't do videos for
any reason) and I agree completely.
