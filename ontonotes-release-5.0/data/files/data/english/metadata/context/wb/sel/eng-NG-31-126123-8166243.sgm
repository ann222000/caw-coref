Yay!!

Finally, we're ready. For you Melbournites, you might like to pop along and
have a listen to my band rockin it up. We'll be playing the Noise Bar in
Brunswick on August 26 at 6:00pm. Its a short Demo set for them to see what
we're like. There'll be a bunch of other bands as well but the most
important thing is that we are playing. :)

Give us a tap on the shoulder if you like and say hi.

Might just do that;-) Would love to see that Strat in action.

My first gig in 15 years will be on the 31st. As long as I (or another
band member) gets cold feet.

Maybe I can convince my firm to open a Melbourne office. I'll
volunteer to fly down to scout locations. Otherwise, I don't think I'm

Oh, I dunno. I might suck badly under the pressure;-) Nah, don't need
presure for that, just a bar tab. If I can get over to Brunsawick I will.

Elwood RSL, I'll be playing at, 6 songs (all Aussie/Kiwi pub songs tho).
