All our actions have consequences Greywolf, and many of our actions
produce consequences that end up destroying peace. They destroy our
peace as well as the inner peace of others.

Now, I don't know why your in prison, nor how long you have to serve.
But, even if your in for life, these same tools applies to all areas
of the discussion.

First let me say that Buddhism is not a perfect religion that being
said, Buddhism is infinitely more perfect then the way you have lived
your life.

This is a good example why atheists fail in their search for inner
peace.

Atheists seek only perfection and discards anything that is not
perfect.

Each religion contains perfection's as well as imperfections. It is up
to the practitioner or end user to use the tools in the right way.

The problem is not the wisdom that is defective. The problem lies with
religious practitioners who are defective in their practice of this
wisdom. The wisdom works - we don't work the wisdom.

So the poor atheists can never find anything 'perfect enough' to latch
onto in their journey to find inner peace.

So, what do the atheists put all their hopes in?

They put all their hopes at finding the failures of humanity instead
of finding the successes.

It then becomes a 'tit for tat' game.

Theists point fingers at the atheist failures - atheists point fingers
at theist failures.

All this means nothing.

It is no different from finding a bad parent and saying we should
outlaw parents because one is bad.

It is true that many Christians do not practice what they preach.

Same with Jews, Hindus, Muslims as well as Atheists.

Atheist don't preach do they?

See:

http://jesusneverexisted.org/jne/forum/index.php?topic=640.0

This phenomena of 'talking the talk but not walking the walk' is not
limited to any one set of beliefs. It just proves the point that
'knowledge without application is useless' and this applies to every
religion known to mankind as well as the atheists.

Many of us get blinded with labels and personal prejudices.

I find it is good to 'look for direction and forget perfection' if we
wish to be at peace with this subject.

Perfection is a journey I take and direction I head in - but I never
arrive at in life.

Perfection is the nature of gods.

Imperfection is the nature of humans.

We can see this with logic.

What is logical is not always practical when it comes to humans...is
it?

Despite this fact, we can all do better if we try at perfecting inner
peace within and with all.

I look towards my direction...am I improving...getting worse...or
frozen?

When you see a failure theist or atheists point out the flaws not in
hatred, but with a spirit of kindness and a genuine effort at helping
others.

Sure tearing others down appeals to one's ego and pride, but so did
torturing insects when we were kids. When we grow up we need a
different way to find self worth.

As you instill seeds of peace within others you plant the same seeds
and water these seeds within you as well.

As you give so you receive.

Is that from the bible or karma?

No, it is just universal law.

Do we like to be beaten down?

Whenever we take it upon ourselves to beat down others, we are headed
in a direction of destroying peace. We destroy our own peace as well
as others peace.  It takes no energy from me to pass something by and
leave it alone in peace. But it takes my energy as well as my peace to
pick something up to destroy it.

When I posted this paragraph earlier, an atheist piped to accuse me of
hypocrisy, telling me that I destroy a potato when I pick it up to eat
it.

Natural law dictates I must eat, but there is no law that says I must
spew venom from my mouth to destroy others.

If atheists can get over fishing for red herrings and get onto bigger
fish to fry they will see a world of difference in their peace
practice.

The destruction of inner peace by destroying potatoes comes about when
I destroy my neighbors crop field of potatoes by poisoning them to
bankrupt him in order to take over his farmland...it does not come
about by eating a potato.

The God of Nature gives me potatoes to eat, the God of inner Peace
tells me to not eat potatoes in excess or to destroy others if I wish
to be at peace. I cannot see either God, I know not how they work, I
just know they are.

We should never find happiness in destroying others belief systems.

When I posted this before Raven brought up the Nazis and should we
just let the Nazis belief systems flourish?

Whatever I write about has to be balanced with practicality and some
wisdom. When I write &quot;We should never find happiness in destroying
others belief systems.&quot; I am mainly referring the ongoing battles that
evolve between theists and atheists or theists and other theists.

These groups take pride in destroying others belief or lack of belief
systems. When we put out pride in destruction and hurting others we
destroy ourselves as well. All our actions have consequences, and many
of our actions produce consequences that end up destroying peace. They
destroy our peace as well as the inner peace of others.

As far as Nazis?

My words do not mean we have to not be concerned with danger to our
well being by another, but, it also reminds us we will never be at
peace by fostering hatred for another.

Sure protect yourself, but find no happiness in killing other living
beings even if the killing is out of self defense, if you wish to be
at peace within.

As a freethinker I draw from many spiritual traditions including
Buddhism and Taoism GW. I use whatever can be tested from any source
including religion. If it can't be tested, then I generally leave it
in the 'faith necessary' category.

My main focus of my Buddhist practice is concentrated on the 3 pillars
of Buddhism that are common to all schools of Buddhist practice: I've
settled on the essence of Buddhism and that is what I work on and find
much peace with this type of simplified practice that can be tested.

3 Pillars of Buddhism

1- Practicing mindfulness and meditation to develop peace and self
awareness of our own true nature.

2- Accepting the liberating wisdom of impermanence and practicing non-
clinging and a lessening of craving and desires.

3- The development of compassion for others.

Buddhists are not required to believe or not believe in god, so anyone
can make use of this philosophy irrespective of their religious
beliefs or lack thereof. Buddha was not a god and just a man, so not
need to worship him unless you are a 'Pure Land Buddhist.' In addition
to the 3 pillars, we can use the eightfold path to guide us.

The Eightfold Path

1. Right View
2. Right Intention
3. Right Speech
4. Right Action
5. Right Livelihood
6. Right Effort
7. Right Mindfulness
8. Right Concentration

How can you differentiate right from wrong? By peace. You learn what
destroys your peace and the peace of others as well as what promotes
you inner peace and the inner peace of others. Do you need a teacher
for that? Or the Pope to tell you? Or just listen to peace as the best
teacher?

The 5 precepts are the 'commandments' more or less for Buddhists.
Although you are not commanded to do a thing. If you wish to live at
peace, then proceed the best you can - but it is your choice. No one
to boss you other than you...you alone are in control of your inner
peace.

The Five Precepts

1.  Refrain from Killing:
2.  Refrain from Stealing:
3.  Refrain from Sexual Misconduct:
4.  Refrain from False Speech:
5.  Refrain from the Use of Intoxicants:

Once I am at peace, I can share with others about finding peace for
themselves, which is the secondary reason I practice. I have no
interest in practicing Buddhism for extinguishing reincarnation.
These &quot;fear based&quot; reasons for being a Buddhist are not authentic or
natural - the persons actions are based on fear or negative
consequences otherwise they would not do them. My actions are based on
inner peace and if I stray - there goes my peace - it is my choice. I
enjoy life and realize that due to natural law, suffering comes about
as part of the process. The Taoists have a saying for this, &quot;fleas
come with the dog.&quot; So, I accept there are growth pains as a fair
trade off for the privilege of living and I would enjoy any
reincarnation if given the chance. Buddhism helps makes this trade off
of life and pain more in my favor by lending me support to live a life
at peace. I do not practice Buddhism to earn merit for the next life -
I practice Buddhism for my own peace generation in THIS LIFE.

I'd like to point out that my views are not the orthodox or
traditional vies on these subjects. The orthodox view of Buddhist
beliefs can be summed up in a meditation on the three liberation's. By
meditating on emptiness, formlessness and passionlessness, this will
allow you, with a few lifetimes of diligent practice, to recognize the
three liberation's of the ego and the dharma as being empty, the
dharma as formless and this eventually the recognition of living is an
unworthy desire as our existence is characterized by suffering. So,
please do not think I speak for anyone other than 'myself' with
whatever I write. Of course, traditional Buddhists also believe there
is no 'my' or 'self' so, I guess it really doesn't matter in that
case.

Good Luck,

I'm afraid 'V' failed to take into account that the 'inner peace' that you
rightfully point out is lacking, is not just my own. It's the same lack of
inner peace each and every atheist should feel knowing that there is such
vile hatred, such detestation, contempt, disdain and intolerance on the part
of certain so-called 'Christians' towards a fellow human being, a
'neighbor', that they feel no compunction whatever about attempting to
actually starve to death. Worse, that locally elected government officials
would stand idly by and do nothing about it. Such a psychopathic,
deep-seated hatred of one's neighbor based almost solely on just a
theological difference of *opinion* is . . . well, psychopathic!

*Every* person of good heart and noble conscience should be utterly repulsed
by such behavior. But perhaps *most* of all, the 'Christian'. I'm sure such
abominable, wretched behavior on the part of fellow 'Christians' gives the
'true' Christian little peace of mind and no comfort. Their faith has been
trampled into the ground. And by people who have no business *whatever*
calling themselves 'Christians'. It's time Christians who embrace the noble
teachings and directives of their Jesus rip their faith right back from the
phony-baloney charlatans who stole it from them. And 'soon' wouldn't be fast
enough.
