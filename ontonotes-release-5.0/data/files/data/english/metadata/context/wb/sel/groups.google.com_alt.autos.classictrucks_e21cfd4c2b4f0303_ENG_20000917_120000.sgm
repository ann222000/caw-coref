Hello. I own a 57 Ford F100 and am looking for information on them.
Things such as what kind of drivetrain they would have come with out of
the factory. Also information on production numbers would be great.
As of right now my truck has a 5.0 engine with a C-4 backing it, to a
411 rearend. I think the rearend is orginal but would like to know
what transmission it would have had, and what engine it comes with
stock. The truck does have all the emblems for V-8 truck. But those
could have just been added.

Any help would be great. Thanks in advance.
Charles

Hi, my neighbor has a 57 ford pickup for sale. He says it has the orginal
drivetrain, which is a 312cid engine and a 4 speed manual trans. As far as
automatic trans is concerned, it would be a cruiseomatic 3 speed, which is a
borgwarner box.

This might be out of print, you might find it at the local library to
research your truck questions!

"/> You can tell the original engine from the VIN number. The engine number
is the 4th letter of the vin.
J=223 cid 6 cyl, K=272 cid 8 cyl-145 hp, L=272 cid 8 cyl-153 hp. You can
also tell the tranny/gears from the VIN I think, but I don't know the
codes. MK
