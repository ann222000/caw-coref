What English earl would this be? (Second paragraph)

Quote:

&quot;Letoy ( a fantastic Lord):

Stage-plays and masques are nightly my pastimes -
And all within myself. My own men are
My music and my actors. I keep not
A man or boy but is of quality;
The worst can sing or play his part o' th' viols,
And act his part, too, in a comedy:
For which I lay my bravery on their backs;
[...]

I tell thee,
These lads can act the emperor's lives all over
And Shakespeare's chronicled histories to boot;
And were that Caesar, or that English earl,
That loved a play and players so well, now living,
I would not be outvied in my delights.

[...]
I love the quality of playing, ay; I love a play with all
My heart, a good one, and a player that is
A good one too, with all my heart. As for the poets,
No men love them, I think, and therefore
I write all my plays myself, and make no doubt
Some of the court will follow
Me in that too. Let my fine lords
Talk o' their horse-tricks and their jockeys that
Can out-talk them; let the gallants boast
Their May.games, play-games and their mistresses -
I love a play in my plain clothes, ay,
And laugh upon the actors in the brave ones.&quot;

Richard Brome was in some sort of secretary subjection
to Ben Jonson, and Jonson wrote an introduction to one of
his plays in his usual haughty tone.

The play at question, &quot;The Antipodes&quot; was written by Brome
in 1636 or so and first acted in 1638. A modern critical edition
is &quot;Richard Brome, The Antipodes. Edited by Ann Hacker&quot;,
Univ. of Nebraska, 1966. &quot;Regents Renaissance Drama Series.&quot;

John Rollett has posted that intriguing passage below, our hero
Letoy (&quot;a member of the old order of landed gentry&quot; - A.K.)
speaking of &quot;that English earl&quot; who so loved a play, etc. And
there is also Letoy speaking of himself such as this (caps, rk):

Act III, 5 &quot;Now I protest. Sit, and sit civilly, till the play be
done; I'll lock thee up else, as I am a TRUE LETOY.
Act IV, 8 &quot;As I am TRUE LETOY...&quot;
Act V, 6 &quot;Look you this way, sir, when I speak to you; I'll
cross your fortune else, as I am a TRUE LETOY.&quot;
Act V, 7 &quot;As I am a TRUE LETOY, well said. I hope thy son
is cur'd by this, too.&quot;
Act V, 8 &quot;As I am a TRUE LETOY....&quot;

There is in the Antipodes a play within a play, all directed by Letoy,
who was a &quot;...believer in the therupeutic value of a good play,&quot;
and the earl had some advice for actors, which I'll post next time.

Brome was popular, and evidently his comedy came a bit sideways
or upside-down to his audience, as in the Antipodes. It was dedicated
to William, Earl of Hertford, etc., who was William Seymour
(1588-1660), who &quot;loved his book above all exercise,&quot; a man who
was seated progressively in the highest places of scholarly need and
judicious temper.

Brome begs of Hertford that the Antipodes, &quot;If it meet with too
severe
construction, I hope your protection. What hazards soever it shall
justle with....&quot; .... Much or little could be made of &quot;severe&quot;
and
and &quot;soever&quot;, I suppose, but I wouldn't fool around with it
myself.
And what hazards? This is a foolish comedy, everyone just out for
fun, standing on their heads for a laugh.

Next time I'll post Letoy's advice for the actors listening in,
touching
upon the addiction of the craft, and the unruliness of the ego.

Letoy speaks to his actors:

&quot;Trouble not you your head with my conceit,
But mind your part. Let me not see you act now
In your scholastic way you brought to town wi'ye,
With seesaw sack-a-down, like a sawyer;
Nor in a comic scene play Hercules Furens,
Tearing your throat to split the audient's ears.
And you, sir, you had got a trick of late
Of holding out your bum in a set speech,
Your fingers fibulating on your breast
As if your buttons or your band-st rings were
Helps to your memory. Let me see you in't
No more, I charge you. No, nor you sir, in
That over-action of the legs I told you of,
Your singles and your doubles. Look you, thus -
Like one o'th'dancing masters o' the Bear Garden,
And when you have spoke, at end of every speech,
Not minding the reply, you turn you round
As tumblers do, when betwixt every feat
They gather wind by firking up their breeches.
I'll none of these absurdities in my house,
But words and action married so together
That shall strike harmony in the ears and eyes
Of the severest, if judicious, critics.&quot;

Quailpipe answers: &quot;My lord, we are corrected,&quot; and
Letoy continues.

&quot;Go, be ready - [Exeunt Quailpipe and three actors.]
[to Byplay] But you, sir, are incorrigible, and
Take license to yourself to add unto
Your parts your own free fancy, and sometimes
To alter or diminish what the writer
With care and skill compos'd; and when you are
To speak to your coactors in the scene,
You hold interlocutions with the audients - &quot;

And so might Hamlet have spoken to the players had he
enough time, and of course we have now a play within a
play. But you must read the Antipodes, and I must read
it again, for there's much to wonder about. Here is Letoy
speeching at another place. Truelock is commenting upon a
changling baby, and Letoy's answers him.

Truelock: &quot;...She has been from the third day of her life
Reputed mine, and that so covertly,
That not her lady mother nor my wife
Knew to their deaths the chance of my dead infant,
Nor this sweet lady. 'Tis most true we had
A trusty nurse's help and secrecy
Well paid for in the carriage of our plot.&quot;

Letoy: &quot;Now shall you know what mov'd me, sir. I was
A thing beyond a madman, like yourself
Jealous; and had that strong distrust, and fancied
Such proofs unto myself against my wife
That I conceiv'd the child was not mine own,
And scorn'd to father it; yet I gave to breed her
And marry her as the daughter of this gentleman
(Two thousand pound I guess you had with her);
But since your match, my wife upon her death bed
So clear'd herself of all my foul suspicions
(Blest be her memory) that I then resolv'd
By some quaint way (for I am still Letoy)
To see and try her throughly; and so much
To make her mine, as I should find her worthy.
And now thou art my daughter and mine heir,
Provided still (for I am still Letoy)
You honorably love her, and defy
The cuckold-making fiend, foul jealousy.&quot;

If Ben Jonson knew all about Oxford, and I suppose he
did, then surely Richard Brome also knew, being his
secretary. More of this later.

It would seem that Richard Brome had closely read
Hamlet's advice to his players. LeToy nearly recites
Hamlet in much of his advice, as you see.

Enter HAMLET and Players

HAMLET

Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounced it to
you, trippingly on the tongue: but if you mouth it,
as many of your players do, I had as lief the
town-crier spoke my lines. Nor do not saw the air
too much with your hand, thus, but use all gently;
for in the very torrent, tempest, and, as I may say,
the whirlwind of passion, you must acquire and beget
a temperance that may give it smoothness. O, it
offends me to the soul to hear a robustious
periwig-pated fellow tear a passion to tatters, to
very rags, to split the ears of the groundlings, who
for the most part are capable of nothing but
inexplicable dumbshows and noise: I would have such
a fellow whipped for o'erdoing Termagant; it
out-herods Herod: pray you, avoid it.

FIRST PLAYER

I warrant your honour.

HAMLET

Be not too tame neither, but let your own discretion
be your tutor: suit the action to the word, the
word to the action; with this special o'erstep not
the modesty of nature: for any thing so overdone is
from the purpose of playing, whose end, both at the
first and now, was and is, to hold, as 'twere, the
mirror up to nature; to show virtue her own feature,
scorn her own image, and the very age and body of
the time his form and pressure. Now this overdone,
or come tardy off, though it make the unskilful
laugh, cannot but make the judicious grieve; the
censure of the which one must in your allowance
o'erweigh a whole theatre of others. O, there be
players that I have seen play, and heard others
praise, and that highly, not to speak it profanely,
that, neither having the accent of Christians nor
the gait of Christian, pagan, nor man, have so
strutted and bellowed that I have thought some of
nature's journeymen had made men and not made them
well, they imitated humanity so abominably.

FIRST PLAYER

I hope we have reformed that indifferently with us,
sir.

HAMLET

O, reform it altogether. And let those that play
your clowns speak no more than is set down for them;
for there be of them that will themselves laugh, to
set on some quantity of barren spectators to laugh
too; though, in the mean time, some necessary
question of the play be then to be considered:
that's villanous, and shows a most pitiful ambition
in the fool that uses it. Go, make you ready.
Exeunt Players

---------------------------------------------------

LETOY speaks to his actors:

&quot;Trouble not you your head with my conceit,
But mind your part. Let me not see you act now

A man named Alexander Brome (no relation evidently)
edited the works of Richard Brome in the late 1800s, and at one
place he reflects upon the lowly origin of the playwright, who had
been a serving-man to Ben Jonson. Alexander B. goes to history to
find examples of great literature coming out of the lower class of
folk:

&quot;And were not already the Antients too much trod on, we could name
famous wits who seerved far meaner Masters than Ben Johnson. For,
none vers'd in Letters but know the wise Aesop was born and bred a
wretched slave; Lucian a Stonecutter; Virgil himself begotten by a
Basket-maker, born in a ditch, and then preferred to an under Groom
in the stable; nay (to instance in our Authors own order) Naevius the
Comedian a Captains mans man; Plautus servant to a poor Baker.
Terence a slave as well as Aesop; and (which for our purpose is most
of all) our Authors own Master handled a trowel before he grew
acquainted with Seianus or Cataline....&quot;

The special interest here is that in digging up some names of poets
of low degree, Alexander Brome does not mention Shakespeare amongst
the rest. There it was, a perfect example of a poet who came from the
working class, a small town boy making good, no education we know
anything about, a genius of the most humble beginnings, holding horses
at the theaters, etc. A wonderful example for Alexander Brome's
thesis, and left out of the company of Ben Jonson, Richard Brome, etc.
Why is that do you suppose?

I &quot;suppose&quot; it's evidence (coming 300 years too late, so not very strong in
any case) that Shakespeare never served as an apprentice or slave, as did
all the other examples.

It was about 36 years after the death of the
Stratford man that Alexander Brome made his
remark about Richard Brome, comparing his low
beginnings with the ancients, concluding:

&quot;...and (which for our purpose is most of all) our
Authors own Master handled a trowel before he grew
acquainted with Seianus or Cataline....&quot;

So we'd expect an obvious coupling with Ben
Jonson would be Shakespeare of Stratford. He's
promoted by the Strats in every other guise and
accomplishment, but here was a chance of our
editor to enter him into the working class and
praise his rising up, as he does with Jonson, and
Richard Brome. He doesn't.

Ben Jonson was the one poet most intimately
associated with &quot;Shakespeare,&quot; and that the
Bard should be left out of this low-class catalog
would seem to suggest that AB didn't know
anything about Shakespeare's background, or else
he didn't believe that the Stratford man was the
great poet.

In other words, Ben Jonson's contributions to the
first folio, the monument, all that, was horseshit
and a lot of people knew it.

BROME, ALEXANDER (1620-1666), English poet, was by profession an
attorney, and was the author of many drinking songs and of satirical
verses in favor of the Royalists and against the Rump. He published in
1661 Songs and other Poems, containing songs on various subjects,
followed by a series of political songs; ballads, epistles, elegies and
epitaphs; epigrams and translations. Izaak Walton wrote an introductory
eclogue for this volume in praise of the wrfter, and his gaiety and wit
won for him the title of the English Anacreon in Edward Phillipss
T/ieatrum Poetarum. Brome published in 1666 a translation of Horace by
himself and others, and was the author of a comedy entitled The Cunning
Lovers (1654). He also edited two volumes of Richard Bromes plays.

I notice that, although you appear to be replying to my response, you don't
actually reply to what I said, which is fine, I guess, except it makes it
look like one of us doesn't understand what's going on. Maybe that's me.

For the record: I assume your reference in the orginal post &quot;in the late
1800s&quot; was a typo for &quot;1600s&quot;. Which doesn't alter my primary comment.
Alexander Brome, according to the quote, wasn't talking about rising from
lowly status, he was talking about the specific relationship between a
master and apprentice or slave. Even if he were talking purely about
status, it might not apply to Shakespeare, since he was the son of a
prosperous businessman.

I think it's quite clear that Shakespeare of
Stratford might well be mentioned in the same
breath of Jonson, regarding status. That's the
opinion of all Strat scholars. Alexander
Brome either overlooked this very obvious
comparison, or had no use for it.

Jonson handled a trowel before turning to
poetry, Shakespeare handled sheep. Neither
man was a slave, and I think you're
introducing a quibble to the question.

Thanks for replying.

I've been known to quibble, but not in this case. To me it appears to be
the crux of the issue. The original quote starts with the sentence ...

&quot;And were not already the Antients too much trod on, we could name
famous wits who seerved far meaner Masters than Ben Johnson.&quot;

... and all the examples are of people who served as apprentices or slaves
and who performed manual labor.

I notice, belatedly, that other than Jonson himself (who as Richard Brome's
master was the contemporary exemplar) all the examples are from antiquity as
well.

We have absolutely no evidence that Shakespeare ever lifted a finger in
labor or ever served another man (unless you count his adult service to the
likes of the Lord Chamberlain and King James). It's not out of the realm of
possibility that he did so, but there's no evidence. Some of the anecdotal
stories have him a butcher's apprentice or &quot;holding horses&quot; at the theaters,
but these have no more credibility than the schoolmaster tale. You can take
your pick from them or ignore them all, but you can't hang a syllogism on
them. I can't recall any, even apocryphal, stories that have him handling
sheep (there is the one about him slaughtering a calf ... ).

Alexander Brome's failure to include Shakespeare would argue against, not
for, the apprentice anecdotes ... except of course that he was not citing
contemporary examples.

If Shakespeare had been mentioned in this
passage by Alexander Broom and set in the
company of Ben Jonson as a poet of low
beginnings, the Stratfordians would be
hooting for joy. The Groatsworth would
come second best to such a mention in the
context given.

It's obvious what AB was getting at, his
thesis you understand, and you have surely
gone to quibbling.

My turn at the quibble would be to talk about
slaves, or the mention of Terence as a stand-in
for his betters, or the question if Aesop ever
existed, or some talk about the trades of stone-
cutting, basket-making, brick-laying, the prosperity
of John Shakespeare or his trade in wool, fables
of William, etc. etc.

The passage is clear enough and it's quite
early on, and quite obvious that Alexander
Brome selected to leave out the name of
Shakespeare in this humble inventory.

Nothing personal, and thanks for the offer to
quibble with you, but it's a wasteful exercise
and tiresome, I know the drill.

Well, that pretty much settles it, then, except for the part about not
responding to anything I actually wrote. My original included below for

See you around.

Thanks for replying.

I've been known to quibble, but not in this case. To me it appears to be
the crux of the issue. The original quote starts with the sentence ...

&quot;And were not already the Antients too much trod on, we could name
famous wits who seerved far meaner Masters than Ben Johnson.&quot;

... and all the examples are of people who served as apprentices or slaves
and who performed manual labor.

I notice, belatedly, that other than Jonson himself (who as Richard Brome's
master was the contemporary exemplar) all the examples are from antiquity as
well.

We have absolutely no evidence that Shakespeare ever lifted a finger in
labor or ever served another man (unless you count his adult service to the
likes of the Lord Chamberlain and King James). It's not out of the realm of
possibility that he did so, but there's no evidence. Some of the anecdotal
stories have him a butcher's apprentice or &quot;holding horses&quot; at the theaters,
but these have no more credibility than the schoolmaster tale. You can take
your pick from them or ignore them all, but you can't hang a syllogism on
them. I can't recall any, even apocryphal, stories that have him handling
sheep (there is the one about him slaughtering a calf ... ).

Alexander Brome's failure to include Shakespeare would argue against, not
for, the apprentice anecdotes ... except of course that he was not citing
contemporary examples.

Mark,

Are you going to Stratford again this summer? We should try and have a week
when anyone who is near enough and is on HLAS could make plans to go, and we
could all meet for dinner or something.

For those interested: A week or two before performances, Stratford often
reduces the price of tickets substantially if one buys online.

Greg, there's a train from Chicago to Toronto. There should be a connection
somewhere on the way which goes into Stratford. ;)

&lt;&lt; The [Knights] Templars had a hierarchical structure
(copied fromt the Cistercians and later adopted by the Freemasons)
that consisted of knights, SERGEANTS, chaplains, and servants.&gt;&gt;

- p.71 _The Secret Societies Handbook_ by Michael Bradley
--------------------------------------------------------------

&lt;&lt;Stratford began to take shape in 1832 when
Thomas Mercer Jones, a Canada Company director,
gave a picture of William Shakespeare to William SARGINT,
the owner of the Shakespeare Hotel. A stone marks the site
of this hotel, near 70 Ontario Street. Jones gave the village
the name of Stratford and the creek, which had been
known as Little Thames, was renamed the Avon River.

In 1834 surveyor John MacDonald created the town plan.
He placed the geographic centre of town at the point where
four townships met, not far from today's Wade's Flower Shop.
He then created four main roads radiating from the centre.
Three of these roads were named for the Great Lakes
to which they lead, Huron, Erie and Ontario.

In 1933 a general strike, which started with furniture workers
and chicken pluckers, became so unruly that the army,
along with its tanks, was called in to put a stop to the strike.
The strike was a major event in Canadian industrial history and
is the subject of playwright James Reaney's play Kingwhistle!
In 1936 Thomas Orr succeeded in having the Shakespearean
Gardens created. In 1953, Tom Patterson, a Stratford-born
reporter for Maclean's Magazine, and a group of local
supporters opened the Stratford Festival. &gt;&gt;

I've already got my tickets for August 30-September 4 (plus tickets for the
Shaw Festival the weekend before); Monday, September 5 is, I believe, the
annual cricket match between the Stratford and Shaw companies. I'm always
happy to make a couple trips up there when possible, though. My schedule at
work plus my accumulated vacation might make an additional long-weekend
possible. The only conflict with earlier in the summer would be if I'm
performing with The Cleveland Shakespeare Festival again in July and August
(Cymbelline and All's Well, in case anyone's interested).

If there's any interest and we can find a time more than a few of us can
show up, I'd be glad to inquire if any of their directors or performers
would be willing to lead a discussion on &quot;a working classical theater
person's perspective of the authorship debate&quot;. If anyone on the continent
has insight into that topic, these guys would.

The Stratford season will be a little light on Shakespeare for us
bardoloters of all persuasions. Only Tempest, As You Like It and Measure
for Measure. I think all three productions look very strong, however. They
have some of their best young up-and-coming actors in Measure for Measure,
which is, oddly enough, my personal favorite of his plays (not his best,
just my favorite). Stephen Ouimette will be playing both Touchstone and
Caliban, which should be worth the price of admission for those two shows.

The season overall is worth looking at. It will be one of our few chances
to see Marlowe's Edward II, for example, and Jason Sherman's adaptation of
The Brothers Karamozov sounds very interesting.

There's an excursion bus between Toronto and Stratford, for sure, and I
think train service as well.

, for those who are interested in learning more.

I mentioned in my previous post the The Cleveland Shakespeare Festival will
be performing All's Well That Ends Well and Cymbelline this summer.
Cleveland's big league classical theater also announced its season recently.
FYI, here is Great Lakes Theater Festival's press release:

For Immediate Release
January 4, 2005

Great Lakes Theater Festival
Announces 2005 Season

Classic Theater's 44th Season Features
a Summer Repertory, a Fall Repertory, a Holiday Classic and
a Two For One Subscription Offer

CLEVELAND, OH - Charles Fee, Producing Artistic Director of Great Lakes
Theater Festival (GLTF), recently announced plans for the theater's 2005
season at a Members' Open House in the lobby of the Ohio Theatre, Playhouse
Square Center. &quot;Great Lakes Theater Festival has really come into its own
over the past several seasons and the summer of 2005 will set the course for
the future of this company,&quot; said Fee to an audience of over one hundred
members and friends of the Festival. &quot;We've built an extraordinary resident
acting company, begun to define our approach to the classics - a wild,
accessible, full-blooded approach - and reached out to our community and
audience in consistent and meaningful ways. If you've been wondering what
all the noise is about at Playhouse Square, this is the season to come
downtown and check us out.&quot;
Great Lakes Theater Festival's 2005 season will run from July through
December and will feature a Summer Repertory, a Fall Repertory and the
Festival's annual holiday classic. In the summer (July 29-September 3,
2005), GLTF will present William Shakespeare's comedy The Merry Wives of
Windsor, directed by Sari Ketter, in rotating repertory with Moss Hart and
George S. Kaufman's American classic, You Can't Take It With You, directed
by Victoria Bussert. The Festival's Fall Repertory (September 16-October
22, 2005) will pair Peter Shaffer's Amadeus, directed by Gordon Reinhart,
with William Shakespeare's As You Like It, directed by Risa Brainin. GLTF
will conclude the 2005 season with its annual production of Charles Dickens'
holiday classic, A Christmas Carol (November 25-December 23, 2005), adapted
and directed by Gerald Freedman and staged by GLTF Associate Artistic
Director, Andrew May. All productions will be presented in the Ohio Theatre
at Playhouse Square Center. Each repertory will run for six weeks, while
the Festival's production of A Christmas Carol will run for four weeks.
(Click here to consult the 2005 season performance calendars for complete
details:   )
&quot;We were thrilled by the response of our audience and our critics to last
season's Summer and Fall Repertories,&quot; said Charles Fee. &quot;The opportunity
to see a single resident company of actors perform two plays on the same
stage alternating shows every few nights makes the Great Lakes Theater
Festival experience a unique one in Northern Ohio. It is a great challenge
for artists and great fun for audiences.&quot;
A special feature of the Festival's 2005 season is a NEW Two For One
subscription offer. The Two For One offer is designed to make subscribing
to the Festival easier and more affordable. As part of the offer, the
Festival will match every NEW subscription package purchased with one FREE
subscription package of equal value. &quot;Everybody knows that subscriptions
are down across the board in the arts and in sports,&quot; said GLTF Producing
Artistic Director, Charles Fee, regarding the reasons for the new offer.
&quot;But it is critical to all of our companies that audiences buy into the idea
of a body of work, a series of plays .and the Two For One subscription offer
that we are making this season is a direct appeal to audiences that love our
work but have been hesitant to commit! What have you got to lose?&quot; GLTF's
Two For One subscription offer is valid on all NEW Classic, Best Value and
Family and Senior Matinee subscription package purchases only. The offer is
not valid on Youth or Fest Pass subscription package purchases.
Fee also confirmed the Festival's continued commitment to making classic
theater accessible to student audiences in 2005. &quot;We've opened the doors
wide to the student audience of Cleveland - an audience that really doesn't
have the money to attend most performing arts events. The response has been
outrageous - with nearly a third of our evening audience buying student
tickets. It's all about Shakespeare and the classics! Despite popular
opinion, that's what the young audience today wants to experience -
spectacle, actors who can tear it up, and the strange alchemy that
transforms us in the theater.&quot; The Festival's subscription and single
ticket campaigns echo Fee's statements. Young adult subscriptions (age 25
and under) begin at $30. Educator/Student/Youth tickets for any seat in the
Ohio Theatre are available for $12.50 ($17.50 for A Christmas Carol).
Educator/Student/Youth tickets and are available for all performances
(Additional handling fees may apply and may vary depending on point of
purchase).
&quot;2005 is an exciting time for Great Lakes Theater Festival.&quot; said Charles
Fee of Cleveland's classic theater. &quot;Of all the changes that we have made
over the past several seasons, what is most exciting to me is to have been
able to renew our commitment as an organization to the idea of company. On
an artistic level, on an administrative level and in our work throughout
this vibrant community, the idea of company has and will continue to yield
great results for the Festival. I look forward to the opportunity to
produce another amazing season of great, classic theater in collaboration
with this talented ensemble.&quot;
Fee confirmed that Opening Night performances of The Merry Wives of Windsor,
You Can't Take It With You, Amadeus and As You Like It have been scheduled
for Saturday evenings while A Christmas Carol's opening night is slated for
a Friday night. Curtain times for all evening performances will remain at
7:30 p.m., with a 1:30 p.m. curtain time for Saturday matinees and a 3:00
p.m. curtain time for Sunday matinees. All five productions in GLTF's 2005
season will continue to offer sign interpreted and audio described
performances as well as the popular Director's Night and Playnotes pre-show
discussion series. (Click here to consult the 2005 season performance
calendars for complete details:
)
An adult subscription to Great Lakes Theater Festival starts as low as $72.
Single tickets range in price from $21.50-$55.00 (Additional handling fees
may apply and may vary depending on point of purchase). Subscriptions are
available now by calling (216) 664-6064 (Click here for complete

Should have mentioned that Leon Rubin is directing Measure for Measure.
He's the one who did the incredible Pericles two years ago, and the
delightful Midsummer last year. Not clear how he will use his estimable
visual sense in MfM, but should definitely be worth seeing.

&gt; Caliban, which should be worth the price of admission for those two shows.

&gt; The season overall is worth looking at. It will be one of our few chances
&gt; to see Marlowe's Edward II, for example, and Jason Sherman's adaptation of
&gt; The Brothers Karamozov sounds very interesting.

&gt; There's an excursion bus between Toronto and Stratford, for sure, and I

&gt;&gt; Mark,

&gt;&gt; Are you going to Stratford again this summer? We should try and have a
&gt; week
&gt;&gt; when anyone who is near enough and is on HLAS could make plans to go,
and
&gt; we
&gt;&gt; could all meet for dinner or something.

&gt;&gt; For those interested: A week or two before performances, Stratford often
&gt;&gt; reduces the price of tickets substantially if one buys online.

&gt;&gt; Greg, there's a train from Chicago to Toronto. There should be a
&gt; connection
&gt;&gt; somewhere on the way which goes into Stratford. ;)

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If Shakespeare had been mentioned in this
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; passage by Alexander Broom and set in the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; company of Ben Jonson as a poet of low
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; beginnings, the Stratfordians would be
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; hooting for joy. The Groatsworth would
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; come second best to such a mention in the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; context given.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It's obvious what AB was getting at, his
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; thesis you understand, and you have surely
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; gone to quibbling.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; My turn at the quibble would be to talk about
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; slaves, or the mention of Terence as a stand-in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; for his betters, or the question if Aesop ever
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; existed, or some talk about the trades of stone-
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; cutting, basket-making, brick-laying, the prosperity
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of John Shakespeare or his trade in wool, fables
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of William, etc. etc.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The passage is clear enough and it's quite
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; early on, and quite obvious that Alexander
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Brome selected to leave out the name of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Shakespeare in this humble inventory.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Nothing personal, and thanks for the offer to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; quibble with you, but it's a wasteful exercise
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and tiresome, I know the drill.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Thanks for replying.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I've been known to quibble, but not in this case. To me it appears to
&gt; be
&gt;&gt;&gt; the crux of the issue. The original quote starts with the sentence
...

&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;And were not already the Antients too much trod on, we could name
&gt;&gt;&gt; famous wits who seerved far meaner Masters than Ben Johnson.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt; ... and all the examples are of people who served as apprentices or
&gt; slaves
&gt;&gt;&gt; and who performed manual labor.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I notice, belatedly, that other than Jonson himself (who as Richard
&gt;&gt; Brome's
&gt;&gt;&gt; master was the contemporary exemplar) all the examples are from
&gt; antiquity
&gt;&gt; as
&gt;&gt;&gt; well.

&gt;&gt;&gt; We have absolutely no evidence that Shakespeare ever lifted a finger
in
&gt;&gt;&gt; labor or ever served another man (unless you count his adult service
to
&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt;&gt; likes of the Lord Chamberlain and King James). It's not out of the
&gt; realm
&gt;&gt; of
&gt;&gt;&gt; possibility that he did so, but there's no evidence. Some of the
&gt;&gt; anecdotal
&gt;&gt;&gt; stories have him a butcher's apprentice or &quot;holding horses&quot; at the
&gt;&gt; theaters,
&gt;&gt;&gt; but these have no more credibility than the schoolmaster tale. You
can
&gt;&gt; take
&gt;&gt;&gt; your pick from them or ignore them all, but you can't hang a syllogism
&gt; on
&gt;&gt;&gt; them. I can't recall any, even apocryphal, stories that have him
&gt; handling
&gt;&gt;&gt; sheep (there is the one about him slaughtering a calf ... ).

&gt;&gt;&gt; Alexander Brome's failure to include Shakespeare would argue against,
&gt; not
&gt;&gt;&gt; for, the apprentice anecdotes ... except of course that he was not
&gt; citing
&gt;&gt;&gt; contemporary examples.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I think it's quite clear that Shakespeare of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Stratford might well be mentioned in the same
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; breath of Jonson, regarding status. That's the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; opinion of all Strat scholars. Alexander
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Brome either overlooked this very obvious
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; comparison, or had no use for it.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Jonson handled a trowel before turning to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; poetry, Shakespeare handled sheep. Neither
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; man was a slave, and I think you're
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; introducing a quibble to the question.

Great, Mark. Measure For Measure is one of my favourite plays also.

We'll try to get there that last weekend before Labour Day. Remind me about
a month before and I'll try to get tickets online. It works out very well
for me, as I'm doing workshops the week before that and am perfectly free
that week, but my husband will be wanting to get ready for his new class at
school, so he'll need some persuading. ;)

Anyone else for Stratford?

There is train service from Toronto. But one cannot rely on it to get one to
Stratford in time for a performance.

bb, there is a train that goes from New York City to Toronto, stopping at
many places along the way including Albany and Rochester. I've taken it many
times on my way to or from Western Massachusetts.

There might be a connection to Stratford from Niagara Falls or elsewhere,
but the tea you would get would be barely eatable. Good ole Via Rail. ;)

For those who are really wealthy, there's always the Stratford Express:

Yes, Letoy's advice to his actors is absolutely like Hamlet.
The scene starts off with the actors quibbling about their costumes
behind the scenes:

Quote:
&quot;Letoy:
Go fetch them, while I prepare my actors.
(Servants, within:
a. This is my beard and hair.
2. My lod appointed it for my part.
3. No, this is for you; and this is yours, this grey one.
4. Where be the foils and targets for the women?
1. Here, can't you see
2. You must not waear that coat and hat.
3. Who told you so? I must...in my first scene, and you must
wear that robe.

Unquote

Later on comes a comment on &quot;barbarism on stage&quot;

Quote:
&quot;Byplay:
That is a way, my lord, has been allow'd
On elder stages to move mirth and laughter.

Letoy:
Yes, in the days of Tarleton and Kempe,
Before the stage was purg'd from barbarism.
And brought to the perfection it now shines with.
Then fools and jesters spent their wits, because
The poets were wise enough to save their own
For profitabler uses.&quot;

I took that train from Toronto to Calgary and back the last summer it ran.
The air conditioning failed when the temperature was over a hundred, the
train hit a van and sliced it in half, and the conductor was anti-semitic,
but apart from those trifling problems it was a fine ride.

Lynne

Alleyn is supposed to have been the rival of Richard Burbage at
Shakespeare's Globe, and surely did act some of Marlowe's noted
characters at the Rose; but what plays in the Shakespeare canon did he
act in? Which characters did Marlowe create for Alleyn, then, who was
some 7' tall?

I would have thought that Alleyn's financial success, based on his
popularity as an actor, then also theater manager, would be proof of
an Elizabethan actor's ability to rise to independent fortune--a
desert anti-Strats are fain to allow Stratman except by conspiracy.

You guys are probably right. As a group, actors are no more thoughtful than
anyone else. My hope was that among such a large group of classical actors
there might be a few who had given the subject deeper thought - e.g., are
there things in the plays which might indicate a truly intimate knowledge of
the theater surroundings, the lesser actors, etc? Of course these would not
constitute proof, since the possibility (probability) of playhouse revision
is always there, but it could be interesting.

Being an actor has little relevance. It's easy
enough to make millions from being a
'theatrical entrepreneur' -- investing in the
shows that pack the houses -- or buying
the theatres. There are plenty around who
still manage it today.

BUT . . . err . . . the kind of guy that does that
is a businessman, who focuses intensely

the impression that poets (and OUR poet, in

Oxford directed his interests in areas apart from the theater? But of
course he was &quot;that kind of person&quot; himself, if he did despise it. As
I copy from The Elizabethan Review,

(quote)
Throughout the 1580s, De Vere maintained a band of tumblers as well as
two theater companies, Oxford's Boys and Oxford's Men. The former
company played at the Blackfriars Theater in London, the lease of
which Oxford purchased and transferred to playwright and novelist John
Lyly, his secretary for more than 15 years, and at Paul's Church,
until it was closed in 1590. Oxford's Men was a troupe of actors which
mostly toured the provinces.

Yes indeed. Whilst *Tamburlaine* (part one) was probably
not written with him in mind, there is little doubt that
the second part was, given &quot;the general welcomes&quot; his
performance in the first part received, and that the
leading roles in *The Jew of Malta* (Barabas) and *Doctor
Faustus*, as well as The Duke of Guise in *The Massacre
at Paris*, were written with him in mind too.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; but what plays in the Shakespeare canon did he act in?

"/>

None that I am sure of, although I suspect he may have
played Talbot in *1 Henry VI*, Richard Duke of York
(perhaps doubling Clarence?) in *2 Henry VI*, and the
title role in *Titus Andronicus*. But is this relevant?
I was simply disputing your claim that Marlowe (as
Marlowe) would not &quot;have had the familiarity with key
actors to dial in characters specifically for them&quot;. I
think he did, and in fact see no reason why any play-
wright could not have done so after having seen a
few performances by the actors in question.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Which characters did Marlowe create for Alleyn, then,
&gt; who was some 7' tall?

"/>

Ah yes. I seem to recall someone working that out from
size of the ring shown in his portrait (the one I used to
pass by every day in the Lower Hall at school, in fact).
Don't know how reliable the calculation is, but he was
certainly a big fellow, and those parts which he played
would have benefited from that, and even more from
his particular style of acting, I guess.

If you mean that anti-Strats think that William Shakespeare

We have little idea as to the nature of these
'enterprises', nor the extent to which Oxford
took part in their management. Players were
required by law to act under the patronage
of a member of the nobility. In any case, it
would have been out of the question for the
nobles concerned to emulate Edward Alleyn
and make money from the activities of the
theatre companies bearing their name.

But of
| &gt; course he was &quot;that kind of person&quot; himself, if he did despise it.
As
| &gt; I copy from The Elizabethan Review,
| &gt;
| &gt; (quote)
| &gt; Throughout the 1580s, De Vere maintained a band of tumblers as
well as
| &gt; two theater companies, Oxford's Boys and Oxford's Men. The former
| &gt; company played at the Blackfriars Theater in London, the lease of
| &gt; which Oxford purchased and transferred to playwright and novelist
John
| &gt; Lyly, his secretary for more than 15 years, and at Paul's Church,
| &gt; until it was closed in 1590. Oxford's Men was a troupe of actors
which
| &gt; mostly toured the provinces.
| &gt; (unquote)
|
| We have little idea as to the nature of these
| 'enterprises', nor the extent to which Oxford
| took part in their management. Players were
| required by law to act under the patronage
| of a member of the nobility. In any case, it
| would have been out of the question for the
| nobles concerned to emulate Edward Alleyn
| and make money from the activities of the
| theatre companies bearing their name.
|
|
| Paul.

Evidently at least one noble, Bacon, wanted to get ahold of Alleyn's
college endowment money and used his official office to try to
confiscate it for use of Oxford and Cambridge lecture fees. But
Oxford could have put rewarding theater company activities in someone
else's name, as he in fact did in the case of his secretary, Lyly,
above. I think you might investigate the activities of the &quot;group of
tumblers&quot; Oxford supported. What in the world motivated him to do
that? bookburn

He was their patron. That does not imply any

I thought the tumblers might represent a crass attempt to double the
actors in perhaps a side-show, the kind of thing a profit-oriented
manager might do. After all, Alleyn combined bear baiting with
theater performances, and bears are known to have been brought on
stage at the Globe. Wrestling and boxing matches are still the
occasion for some Shakespeare productions. The complaint of &quot;stink&quot;
is in the canon.

Just wondering what Oxford's motives were if not self-aggrandizing or
overtly literary. Seems a bit odd for him to allow theater people to
use his name, but not use one of them as his author-puppet where he
would have had direct oversight. bb

This is really interesting because I have to guess the school might be
the one Alleyn founded, described glowingly as follows, at:

and where his portrait is mentioned as being at the college.

(quote)
Dulwich College was founded by Edward Alleyn on June 21st 1619, with
letters patent from King James I: a splendid document with the Great
Seal of England still survives. Alleyn (who lived from 1566 to 1626,
and whose name should be pronounced Allen) was an actor and an
entrepreneur in the world of Elizabethan and Jacobean entertainment, a
colourful and famous figure of his day.

At the age of forty-seven in 1605 Alleyn bought the manorial estate of
Dulwich for £35,000 from Sir Francis Calton who was in financial
difficulties. The Dulwich estate extended, as it does today from
Denmark Hill to what are now the Crystal Palace grounds on Sydenham
Hill, in between the 'Lordships' Lane (indicating the manorial
boundary) on the east and Croxted (meaning 'crooked street') on the
west. This pleasant valley of fields, common and wooded hillside was
to be frequented by William Blake and by his disciple Samuel Palmer,
who called it 'the Gate into the world of vision'; even in this
century it was capable of sustaining the suburban paradisal vision of
P G Wodehouse, the happy schoolboy, who named it 'Valley Fields' in
his books and spoke of it as the setting of 'six years of unbroken
bliss' at the College.

Alleyn first thought of founding a Hospital (presumably on account of
the Plague) but next proposed to commemorate himself by a Foundation
to be called 'Alleyn's College of God's Gift'. This foundation was to
be in two parts, one charitable (or 'eleemosynary') and the other
educational, on one site, and sharing a chapel. Twelve poor scholars,
aged between six and eighteen, were to be educated by resident
Fellows. The Foundation was not formally constituted until June 21st
1619 (on which anniversary we still commemorate Founder's Day), when
James I signed the letters patent.

Foundation Document

Shortly before he died Alleyn dictated, on September 29 1626,
elaborate statutes for the smooth running of the College. Among many
items these laid down the uniform for the scholars - an uppercoat of
'good cloth of sad colour' and black caps; arrangements for laundry;
the hiring of a ploughboy. The diet was to consist of loaves, boiled
beef, cheese, fish, with apple and pear pies; all of this was to be
increased on 'gawdy daies', and on three days a week the poor scholars
were to have 'beere without stint'.
(unquote)

I suspect that the bit about &quot;beere without stint&quot; on &quot;gawdy daies&quot; is
still a matter of discussion, especially by the &quot;scholars.&quot; A fun
assignment would be to surmise what the author of the canon would have
as his idea of a university.

Someone should do a Crown and Country-type documentary on Alleyn,
