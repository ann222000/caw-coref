My Father Who Art in Heaven: A Deist Without Knowing It

By Dr. Gerry Lower
Created Feb 19 2007 - 11:14am

My father, Gerald Sr., was born in Ontario, Wisconsin on George Washington's
birthday (February 22nd) in 1917 to German American parents of a rather
"atheistic" persuasion. His great grand parents (my great great
grandparents) had immigrated to rural southwestern Wisconsin during the late
1850s from Ontario County in New York.

The family had lived in New York state for nearly a century, moving to
America from southern Germany in the 1760s, just in time for the American
Revolution. Several family members fought in the Revolutionary War and they
gave their children names like "Madison" and "Jefferson". My family has been
American since before there was a democracy in America.

My father's father's father, Madison Lower, became the first blacksmith in
the new town of Ontario (1857) in the new State of Wisconsin (1851). My
father's father, Clyde, became the first banker (1920s) in Ontario, nestled
on the banks of the Kickapoo River in a land of developing dairy farms and
apple orchards. He was a highly principled man and a banker in the highest
sense, a man who would take many losses and never contemplate foreclosure on
friends and members of the community, not even during the Great Depression.

Both my grandfather and father were progressive Republicans following the
leadership of Wisconsin's own Senator Robert ("Fighting Bob") La Follette.
It was a pleasure to be my grandfather's grandson, because I was so often
reminded by area farmers how they would not have made it through the
Depression without my grandfather Clyde's compassion.

As a result of my father's upbringing, he was likewise "atheistic" in the
sense that he never accepted anything supernatural or paranormal. He simply
had no time for spooks and ghosts, being an open admirer of Harry Houdini
for devoting himself to exposing hocus pocus and supernatural coercion. He
only believed in what was honestly human and decent, hence his admiration of
Science and nascent Christianity.

He married my mother, Luella, in 1942, a woman of Norwegian Lutheran
heritage. In order to accommodate her views, my father became an active
member of our church in Ontario and for decades enjoyed the role of lay
minister, greeting churchgoers at the front door on Sunday morning, lighting
the altar candles, taking up collection in wooden plates and well-wishing
everyone on their departure.

He saw it all as a marvelous opportunity to socialize with the people, his
friends, and to feast to one's delight at church socials and bazaars. All of
this church involvement and it is quite certain that he never believed a
word of supernatural religion. What ever did that have to do with Christian
values?

Given that atheism has a negative connotation in religious circles, I have
to admit that I have always been a son in admiration of his father. During
my entire childhood and youth, I never once saw my father drink alcohol,
never once saw him smoke tobacco and only on occasion did I ever hear him
use foul language. The exception, of course, was when he had accidentally
hurt himself and was actually cussing himself out, and doing a pretty good
job of it.

I never heard my father tell a lie. In fact, the quickest way out of trouble
with him was to fearlessly tell the truth and deal with the consequences,
simple as that. I have seen tears roll down his cheeks at the thought of
others with troubles. His most certain traits as a father were honesty and
compassion.

Never once, when I happened into trouble as a boy, did he lay a religious
trip on me, never once did he attempt to make me feel guilty before the gods
and their laws. He did, however, make sure that I knew precisely what I had
done and the ramifications of my actions. He did make sure that I could see
the errors of thought in my actions and the lesson to be learned. He taught
me self-respect as the basis for respecting others, as the basis for
respecting Life on the whole.

It was easy to tell that teaching me these lessons was as hard on him as it
was on me in learning them. He always made sure, however, before bedtime
came along, to let me know that love prevailed. His unspoken philosophy was
self-evident, to "Never let the sun set angry, never see the sun rise sad."

He encouraged me into higher education with his urging that Science is the
only true source of honest and useful knowledge and wisdom. My father did
not live in the JudeoRoman world of things. He lived in the world of ideas.
So, in my interest, he subscribed to Scientific American, Popular Science
and Popular Mechanics magazines.

The value priorities of JudeoRomanism, e.g., Catholicism, are "God, Country
and Family," in that order. My father taught me as a very young man that
this prioritization is a load of religious rot. He simply turned it all
around to state "Family, Country and God," in that order. His argument was
basically this: if one wants an honest God and an honest Country, one best
start by raising honest individuals in honest families, where all learning
begins.

My father never lectured me with laws and the punishments that follow should
they be broken. Rules were dynamic and a function of how one was seeing the
world. To see the world more clearly was to change the rules for the better.
There always had to be, therefore, room to change the rules. We call that
choice "freedom."

Doors were to keep out the weather not to keep out friends and family. Doors
were never locked. If something were to turn up missing from an unlocked
garage (and it never did), then he would have claimed that someone must have
needed the item more than he did. My father was never afraid to shed a tear
in front of me, in showing me his true feelings and sincerity. I love him
for that.

By allowing himself to be fully human, he made himself fully a man. He was a
true romantic, believing that there was far more masculinity and manhood in
loving one woman for 50 years than in loving 50 women for one year, the
latter only an example of not knowing what one wants in life and not knowing
how to get it or keep it.

From philosophical perspectives, I used to see my father as an atheist in
thought and a Christian in action. Having had decades to learn and mull it
over, it is now clear that my father was a Deist in thought and action. He
did not, to my knowledge, even have a name for the belief system he acquired
via his Revolutionary family's roots. He (like his father and his father's
father before him) just practiced what they believed in, an honest,
down-to-earth world.

Five generations after the American Revolution, and five more generations
after moving to Wisconsin, the values of Jefferson and his spiritual world
view still lived in my father.

It has been over two centuries since the flintlock days when my family
members fought for human rights in a new America. Since the glory days of
the Declaration and the Revolution, it has been downhill the entire way for
Jefferson's Democracy with its basis in the human rights of Enlightenment
Christianity. Someone has had to keep the real stuff alive (even if they
didn't have a name for it anymore).

My father died on February 12, 2007, just 10 days before his 90th birthday.
I am more than willing to give him the benefit of the doubt and claim that
he lived to be 90 years old. I have met many people with more educatIon and
more money. have yet to meet anyone who is more of a man. I will be damned
to see him die. He will live again in Jefferson's world because Jefferson's
world view is all that America has left and, under the Bush administration,
America has nowhere to go but up (1).
