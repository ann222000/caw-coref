Eh, maybe.  But bicycling and skateboarding and roller blading and
radio controlled cars, etc, are probably prohibited in the park...
they're definitely prohibited on the sidewalks (if any) on the way to
the park, not to mention the danger of allowing young children to
travel to, or hang out at the park, or beyond shouting distance of

Kids play in the street in front of their homes.  Deal with it.

&gt; Extending courtesy to other drivers requires paying attention - a

&gt; In the retelling of my story to friends, I learned of other similar,
&gt; recent accidents that have occurred, including a dog that was hit and
&gt; left in the street near the park.

&gt; There was significant damage to the car my son was in, but other than
&gt; shaken by the experience, he is alright. Both parties spent the day
&gt; doing things very different than what they had planned. Driving too
&gt; fast and thinking of other things in no way saved anyone, at any time.
&gt; The neighborhood is full of children out and about. Lots of people
&gt; walking dogs and enjoying the sidewalks and outdoors. Maybe it's not
&gt; so obvious when you enter the neighborhood, but you're not on the main
&gt; street anymore. The speed limit drops significantly as the activities
&gt; around increase.

&gt; My plea to you, my neighbors and fellow residents, is to take driving
&gt; seriously and to remind your teens of the heavy responsibility that
&gt; goes along with the privilege of driving.

Children do not belong in the street.  Now if there happens to BE children
in the street, it is a driver's responsibility to avoid squashing them.  But
that should only happen on -extremely rare- occasions where parents are too
fricking stupid to keep their children out of the street.

Funny how people who seem to advocate public roads as playgrounds have the
exact opposite opinion when it comes to dogs.  If a dog gets squashed by a
car/minivan/SUV, the universal opinion is that the dog owner should have
kept the dog leashed, or fenced, or in some way kept the dog out of the
road.  But if a child is playing in the street and gets squashed, suddenly
the burden is on the driver to prove innocence.

So it's a GOOD thing to keep dogs off the road, but it's a GOOD thing to
encourage children to play in the road.  (?!?!?)  -Dave

A pedestrian only has the right to be on the street when he or she is
crossing the street at a marked crosswalk, or an unmarked crosswalk at
an intersection.  Pedestrians don't have the right to play on the
street.  Similarly, a driver doesn't have the right to drive their car

IMO, the shared space concept is a flawed one.  Unlike pedestrians,
motorized vehicles cannot stop or change direction &quot;instantaneously.&quot;
This is due to the mass and inertia inherent to a motor vehicle at a
given velocity.  This is also the case for bicyclists.

This is the reason why a set of rules regarding right-of-way are in
place for motor vehicles and other road users when their paths could
possibly cross each other.  Also, pedestrians have plenty of area to
enjoy themselves in.  They're free to run, jog, stroll, or walk however
they please when they're not on the road.  But, in the interest of
safety, they have to follow the rules of the road when they prepare to
cross one.

Addressing points brought up in the Wikipedia article you cited:

1. &quot;User behavior becomes influenced and controlled by natural human
interactions rather than by artificial regulation.&quot;

This only works at walking speeds.  You can't rely on &quot;natural human
interaction&quot; when driving even at 15 mph to avoid collisions.  Also,
this type of interaction requires one not to be insulated from their
surroundings like one would be in a motor vehicle.  Even if one is
riding a bicycle or motorcycle, their speed and reduced maneuverability
relative to pedestrians makes &quot;natural human interaction&quot; an inadequate
measure to prevent collisions.

2. &quot; ... [R]oad rules strip motorists of the ability to be considerate.&quot;

Why is it that we have to rely on motorists being considerate?  Why
can't pedestrians be considerate and wait to cross the road until
vehicular traffic has passed?  Inconsiderate pedestrians are the ones
who step out less than 50 feet in front of a moving vehicle when there
are no other vehicles behind it.  Considerate pedestrians are the ones
who wait for the vehicle to pass.

I believe the main problem is that certain people or groups want to
abrogate the responsibility of pedestrians to watch out for themselves
when they interact with motor vehicle traffic.  Pedestrians have the
duty to make sure that they don't put themselves in a position where
they could get hit by a vehicle.  That requires that they act in a
predictable manner when they're on the road and when they're preparing
to cross the road.  It's no different when driving a motor vehicle (or
riding a bicycle) and preparing to pull out onto the main road from a
side road.  Drivers or riders in that situation aren't going to rely on
&quot;natural human interaction&quot; with drivers of vehicles comprising
traffic on the main road to avoid a collision.  They're going to rely on
the established rules defining right-of-way in those situations.  The
same concept applies to pedestrians.

You do not have the right of way until somebody yields it to you.
Hitting a child with your vehicle in a residential neighborhood out of

To elaborate, children who do not follow the rules of the road when

they have less rights as compared to say a pedestrian or other road user
who is following the rules of the road.

I am unable to find any official rules of the road that apply to
children playing in a residential neighborhood.  References, please.

As a child, I played on residential streets and I expected vehicles to
drive slowly enough to never hit a child and to allow children time to
safely move out of the way. I suspect you did too. This is how children
act everywhere in the world and have done so for centuries (even dating
back to when there were no motorized vheicles, only horse-drawn
carriages). Your Usenet postings is not going to change that.  You might
as well demand that dogs stop barking.  If children on the street are
holding you up so you are late for your destination, plan ahead and
start your trip sooner!

As a child, I learned proper hand signals and right-of-way rules in
school (pertaining to riding a bike on the road).  I was also taught to
look both ways before crossing the street.  My parents would not let me
play in the middle of the street with good reason.

that cars use the street: to get from point A to point B, just
eliminating the distinction between sidewalk and street. And next time,
when you reference an article like that, post a link instead of
expecting us to do the work of looking it up.

By the rationale of your arguements that I have read (that children have
some kind of &quot;right,&quot; to play in the streets), then I should have the
right to drive my car (or ride my bike) through the parks and
playgrounds if it suits my need to get where I am going. Are you
advocating that too or are you just simply being another MFFY hypocrite?

And before you say it, yes, I and my friends used to play in the street
when we wer kids save for the fact that when a car approached, we were
considerate and got out of the road untill the car passed.

The problem with your interpetation is that any arsehole who wants to

this doesn't work, because selfish people would cause a breakdown of the

By saying who must yield, the law assigns who has right of way. There is
no choice to yield it, the law is clear and determines who has right of

to grant or give right of way in this interpetation. Thusly this can

A driver who does strike a pedestrian outside of a crosswalk can be
cited under 21954(b) if s/he did not exercise due care for the safety
of the pedestrian on the roadway.

For the actual California law on the subject:

http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/waisgate?WAISdocID=97744024865+0+0+...

Some relevant sections (21954 seems most likely to apply to a
typical &quot;children playing in the street&quot; scenario):

21950.  (a) The driver of a vehicle shall yield the right-of-way to
a pedestrian crossing the roadway within any marked crosswalk or
within any unmarked crosswalk at an intersection, except as otherwise
provided in this chapter.
(b) This section does not relieve a pedestrian from the duty of
using due care for his or her safety.  No pedestrian may suddenly
leave a curb or other place of safety and walk or run into the path
of a vehicle that is so close as to constitute an immediate hazard.
No pedestrian may unnecessarily stop or delay traffic while in a
marked or unmarked crosswalk.
(c) The driver of a vehicle approaching a pedestrian within any
marked or unmarked crosswalk shall exercise all due care and shall
reduce the speed of the vehicle or take any other action relating to
the operation of the vehicle as necessary to safeguard the safety of
the pedestrian.
(d) Subdivision (b) does not relieve a driver of a vehicle from
the duty of exercising due care for the safety of any pedestrian
within any marked crosswalk or within any unmarked crosswalk at an
intersection.

21954.  (a) Every pedestrian upon a roadway at any point other than
within a marked crosswalk or within an unmarked crosswalk at an
intersection shall yield the right-of-way to all vehicles upon the
roadway so near as to constitute an immediate hazard.
(b) The provisions of this section shall not relieve the driver of
a vehicle from the duty to exercise due care for the safety of any
pedestrian upon a roadway.

21955.  Between adjacent intersections controlled by traffic control
signal devices or by police officers, pedestrians shall not cross
the roadway at any place except in a crosswalk.

Which does not support your claim.  The code only covers situations
where the right-of-way is contested.  If I'm driving down the highway
and there's no one I'm required to yield the right-of-way to, I have
the right of way.

Pennsylvania statutes sometimes specify who has the right of way, as
well as who yields it.

But the section of the vehicle code that you conveniently left off from
Mr. Lee's post does deal with kids playing in the street:

&quot;21954.  (a) Every pedestrian upon a roadway at any point other than
within a marked crosswalk or within an unmarked crosswalk at an

roadway so near as to constitute an immediate hazard.

(b) The provisions of this section shall not relieve the driver of

pedestrian upon a roadway.&quot;

In other words, kids that are playing on the street need to vacate the
street when a vehicle approaches (something that my friends and I
automatically did when we played on our neighborhood street back in the
'70's) but the driver of a vehicle must still exercise due care for the
safety of the kids on the street.

Also note that section 21954(a) implies that it is o.k. for pedestrians
(i.e. kids) to be on the street as long as they yield the right-of-way
when a vehicle approaches.

This is exactly what used to happen when I was a kid and we played on
the street.  The vehicles would approach slowly and cautiously, giving
us enough time to clear the way for them. When they had passed, we would
resume our play activities on the street.  So they looked out for our
safety, and we were happy to yield the right-of-way to them.

We kids we clearly had a better understanding of the rights and

overly aggressive adults seem to in this discussion!

A convention for who yields the right-of-way does not imply any greater
or lesser right to use the road; it simply provides a mechanism for
allowing both kids' play and traffic flow to proceed.  Kids are supposed
to yield not because they have fewer rights, but rather, because kids
tend to stay in the same area while motorists tend to want to get
somewhere else. Whoever needs to get somewhere else will need a path
along which he can travel.  This has everything to do with common sense
and nothing to do with &quot;rights&quot;.

Convention doesn't, but at least in California, DMV regulations do.

&gt;You're wrong. Be a man and admit it.

You need to get yourself a threaded newsreader, so you don't entirely
lose sight of the context of any discussion. In this particular case,
the original claim from &quot;Dave&quot; was:

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Children in the street is NOT a hazard that a driver should have to
&gt;face, EVER.  Children do not belong in the street...
">

&quot;Dave&quot; and his supporters have been shown to be wrong many times over.
No further discussion should be needed.

Perhaps they read the posting in this thread according to which kids
should not be on the street EVER; and gently and non-violently, through
civil disobedience, they are trying to educate arrogant motorists.
