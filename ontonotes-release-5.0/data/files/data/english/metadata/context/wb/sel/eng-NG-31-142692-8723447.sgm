As someone who once sunk a shrimp boat as an act of civil
disobedience,
Diane Wilson was disappointed when two big environmental groups opted
for
a less-than risky alternative to blocking a new coal-burning power
plant
that's poised to blaze in her community of Calhoun County, Texas.

If she had the time and resources, Wilson, a fourth generation
fisherman
and leader of the lonely environmental group Calhoun County Resource
Watch, says she would have tried to &quot;stop [the plant] dead in its
tracks.&quot;

Instead, the Sustainable Energy and Economic Development (SEED)
Coalition
in Texas and the national watchdog organization Public Citizen ended
their
opposition to the plant this month. The groups agreed to drop their
permit
challenge of the 303-megawatt coal plant in exchange for NuCoastal
Power
Corporation's commitment to offset 100 percent of its mercury and
carbon
dioxide emissions. The proposed plant, which will burn petroleum coke,
will be located in Point Comfort, Texas.

Although Wilson is frustrated, she told me she had &quot;no hard feelings&quot;
toward the environmental groups, saying only theirs was a &quot;different
strategy.&quot;

But Wilson is being generous. It seems like our increasingly dull-
toothed
environmental organizations are suffering from another case of
capitulation.

The massive plan for coal plant expansion in the United States just as
climate change barrels forth with ferocity is as ridiculous and
dangerous
as a triple-bypass patient eating another Whopper. Equally treacherous
is
the doctor who orders the burger, or in this case, the environmental
groups who give a nod to the coal plant.

Texas is not a painless place to rein in polluting industries, and
battles
fought in court can be insanely expensive, with victories far from
guaranteed. I'm not suggesting that stopping mighty coal is another
easy
day in the office. But giving coal the green light should never be
done,
even on the hardest terrain. No new coal means no new coal, regardless
of
the corporations' concessions.

In this case, the concessions seem grand. NuCoastal has agreed to
offset
100 percent of its mercury reductions by reducing emissions by 80
percent
and purchasing mercury emissions credits. The corporation has also
promised to offset 100 percent of its carbon dioxide emissions through
a
variety of credible-sounding avenues: funding energy efficiency
programs,
shutting down a comparable source of emissions, building wind
turbines, or
investing in carbon sequestration equipment.

&quot;I've been told that this is a good thing,&quot; Wilson says.

But good things don't always come in suavely wrapped packages.
&quot;Offsets&quot;
and &quot;emissions credits&quot; are just pretty terms for a dirty reality:
NuCoastal's coal plant will still be polluting, and the people of
Calhoun
County will still be suffering. It looks like Calhoun County's Lavaca
Bay
has been greenwashed.

Kevin Smith, a researcher for UK's Carbon Trade Watch, says, &quot;The fact
is,
with the magnitude of the threat of climate change, you can't be doing
one
kind of climate-friendly project in order to justify fossil fuel
emissions
elsewhere.&quot;

Seems like that's straight out of chapter one of an environmentalist'
s
primer. So why are so many groups using a strategy written by
corporate
polluters? I realize that environmentalists, often backed into a
corner,
have few cards to play. But when will compromises like offsets get
tossed
out of the deck?

Brianna Cayo Cotter, communications manager of the Rainforest Action
Network, is as strict as a schoolmarm when it comes to coal. She told
me
in an email, &quot;There should absolutely be an immediate and binding
moratorium on coal expansion. Even one coal plant is too many and if
the
proposed 150 coal-plant-expansio n plan (which is just for the U.S.)
were
to become actualized, we would be in a point of no return climate
wise.
The greenhouse gas emissions would be staggering at a moment where
everyone is saying our only chance at this point is huge emissions
reductions. There cannot be anymore coal development.&quot;

Besides allowing polluters to wriggle off the hook with ease, offsets
are
harmful because they send a message that the community housing the
coal
plant isn't worth much. It's all well and good that NuCoastal may
curtail
emissions elsewhere, or trade mercury emissions credits, but that does
nothing to safeguard the community where the actual power plant
belches
out toxins.

Of course, Calhoun County's currency depreciates even further given
that
over 16 percent of the population lives below the poverty line and 40
percent of residents are of Latino origin, according to the 2000
Census,
and that the County is already the site of a Superfund.

The SEED Coalition has admitted the dangers of this power plant. On
their
website, the Coalition predicts ominous results, saying that
&quot;emissions
from this plant would risk human health and adversely impact fish and
wildlife&quot; and that &quot;there would be risks of spills in the bay.&quot; The
group
also says, &quot;Burning Pet Coke is still experimental.&quot;

Not much changes just because NuCoastal is offsetting emissions.
Perhaps a
few of these risks are minimized, but the effects of mercury and
carbon
dioxide are still present, even if there's less of it.

In a press release earlier this month, Karen Hadden, executive
director of
the SEED Coalition, said, &quot;Exposure to mercury, a toxic heavy metal,
can
lead to neurological damage, and children are especially at risk.
NuCoastal deserves credit for reducing its mercury emissions
significantly.&quot;

Credit for &quot;reducing&quot; emissions of a toxin that harms children's brain
function, while still releasing it into the air? We might as well
applaud
the Bush administration for deploying smart bombs that supposedly
&quot;reduce&quot;
the number of civilians killed in air strikes.

And it's the applause that's disconcerting. Rather than admitting
defeat-because a new coal plant, no matter the scrubber, is a loss-
Public
Citizen and the SEED Coalition's language about the agreement sounds
as if
it was some sort of gain for the environmental movement.

The chipper press release from the groups announcing the NuCoastal
agreement says, &quot;Environmentalists applaud offsets of carbon dioxide
and
mercury emissions,&quot; and that the agreement is &quot;precedent-setting.&quot;

This press release might as well have been written by Tony Snow for
the
way it obfuscates the truth about the situation. We need honesty from
our
leading environmental groups if we really plan to go toe-to-toe with
Big
Coal, not some letter from camp telling Mom everything's fine despite
a
daily beating from a bully.

If we are to make any real effort at minimizing climate change, the
default, mainstream approach from environmentalists has to be keeping
fossil fuels in the ground, not burning them with an asterisk. But as
long
as our leading environmental groups continue touting offsets and
emissions
reductions like they're viable solutions to our predicament, we'll
never
move to a truly sustainable way of living.

In the same press release, Hadden said, &quot;I don't know of any other
utility
that has made this mercury commitment, and hopefully others will
follow
NuCoastal's lead.&quot;

Actually, let's hope not.

I think information on coal industry  really cleaning itself up has not been
proven. There have been all sorts of articles suggesting what might happen,
often 20 years down the line together with articles suggesting that those
same variables  to faciliate change are not economically or technologicaly
feasible . One thing is known now, the people who have felt its affects
together with high traffic are totally ignored on the east coast. The powers
of energy companies to do what it wants is evident my Americas increasing
particulate pollution threat which is killing the competitiveness and health
of the US in order to protect energy companies. We are going about a insane
policy without care of the consequences. I suffer the consequences, studies
have shown cause of concern for air quality and global warming, yet the
puffed up news media , ripe with coroporate dollars ignores all negative
implications. People in this day and age are responsible to take care of
themselves and find true causes of pollution and its affects and then take
action. Take it from someone who has lived in those conditions.. I was
poisoned and suffer the consequences and yet have no where to turn to remedy
the situation or sue the polluters and this slow poison goes on today while
particulate pollution , a very lethal mixe of certain gasses increases in
number of days  it sickens peopole and  its intensity while its ignored by
politicians and press. So to sum up. don't trust the people who make this
energy until they prove its damages are really mitigated and thats
substaniated.
