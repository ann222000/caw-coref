&lt; http://www.cosatu.org.za/affiliates/affisamwu.htm &gt; 1.1 Investigation alleged deaths electricity workers

Mthandeki Nhlapo, Ntohae Theledi, 22 October 2007

The South African Municipal Worker's Union (SAMWU) is shocked and horrified that five municipal workers were severely burnt when a huge explosion took place at an electricity substation in Cape Town yesterday.

SAMWU heard this morning that two of the workers have since died. We have been unable to verify this despite making numerous phone calls.

The union has decided to immediately send our own team to investigate the cause of the explosion. According to research SAMWU carried out in 2005 and 2006 into the conditions of workers at various departments, including the electricity department, many municipalities seriously neglect the health and safety of a large part of its workforce.

The union will leave no stone unturned in getting to the bottom of how this tragedy occurred. Gone are the apartheid days when workers used to die on the job on a regular basis.

SAMWU will be holding a Central Executive Committee (CEC) meeting this week. We are aware that the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) is about to embark on a national strike around health and safety issues - the first such strike of its kind. At our CEC this week, SAMWU will discuss ways of joining hands with NUM.

SAMWU sends its sincere sympathies to the families of those injured and deceased, if it is indeed true that two workers have died.

&lt; http://www.cosatu.org.za/affiliates/affisafpu.htm &gt; 1.2 Comment on Torrealba and Sundowns

Elvis Sekgobela, 22 October 2007

The South African Football Players Union welcomes the decision of the Dispute Resolution Chamber (DRC) of the PSL after ruling against Sundowns in the dispute involving their former striker Jose Torrealba.

The former Sundowns striker accused the team for forging his signature when the club extended his contract in March this year. The union wants the Mamelodi Sundowns management to deal with this matter and dismiss the particular individual who has forged Torrealba's signature.

There have been such cases where club officials were involved in acts of forging player's contract without anything been done to them. SAPFU therefore call the PSL to investigate this matter and deal with the culprit accordingly.

According to the FIFA regulations, anyone found guilty of forgering a contract of a player should be expelled from football. The union strongly feels that there are many cases out there where player's signatures are imposed on their contracts and therefore appeal to all the players who suspect that they are affected by this to come forward and report the cases.

Sipho Ndzuzo, SAFPU General Secretary says that the union is happy that the player can now resume playing football.

Lastly, as SAFPU we want to urge the PSL to help the players who need the signature expects to determine if their contracts have been forged, because this exercise is very expensive to the players hence some of them don't come forward.

&lt; http://www.cosatu.org.za/affiliates/affisamwu.htm &gt; 1.3 NW Perspective on their 20th Anniversary Celebrations

Moshe Sedike, 22 October 2007

The Provincial leadership of SAMWU want to clarify events around the so called disruptions of their provincial 20th anniversary celebration that was held in Mafikeng on the 20th October 2007.

Firstly, there were some members who became disruptive when the Executive Mayor of Ngaka Modiri Molema District Municipality took to the podium to render a welcoming speech to all guests.

As protocol dictates, the Executive Mayor, Themba Gwabeni was invited to the occasion in his capacity and was further requested by ANC North West Provincial Secretary to represent their Provincial Executive Committee.

To indicate the political vibrancy within the province, some members then became agitated on political grounds. This confirms the mood towards the ANC's Limpopo congress and there is nothing wrong with this because we are workers and active ANC members from our communities.

&quot;This nearly ruined the day for us. We managed to calm the situation but the matter nearly worsened when uniformed members of the South African Police Services were called for the security of the Executive Mayor. We still wonder who called the police during our celebration&quot; said Moshe Sedike, SAMWU Provincial Secretary

&quot;Police were called without liaison with the union's event organisers. Police members were unnecessarily ready for shooting at workers who were celebrating their twenty years of unity. We believe visible policing was needed somewhere else and state resources were misused by viewing the safety of the Executive Mayor over and above of communities who are in constant fear of criminals. As hosts to the Mayor, his security and safety concerns remained our priority, there was no need for the Executive Mayor to have pressed panic buttons of fear to workers on the day, and we are still meeting with him as municipal workers on daily basis,&quot; said Sedike.  There is no truth in Motsweding FM reports that the Executive Mayor could only proceed after the intervention of the police. This is biased reporting.

SAMWU also believes that the Executive Mayor should not have used the platform to justify privatisation of services. Privatisation leads to job losses and maximum profit-making by individuals in the disguise of BEE and job creation. For the Mayor to speak about this was provoking and agitating workers. The Executive Mayor was not tactical in handling the issue, the privatisation of municipal services justification was irrelevant to the celebration.

In all fairness, our event went well as planned, though it was the first of its nature in 20 years of our existence.

&lt; http://www.denosa.org.za/ &gt; 1.4 Key decisions taken by the DENOSA NEC

Asanda Fongqo, 22 October 2007

The National Executive Committee of the Democratic Nursing Organisation of South Africa met over the weekend of the 19th to the 21st October 2007 to discuss crucial issues in the nursing profession and health sector in general.

The recruitment of nurses from India by the Private sector

*       Research has proved that South Africa is not producing/training sufficient nurses to deal with its health needs. The NEC had an in debt debate on this aspect, noting also that the recruitment of nurses from India or any other country should be a short-term solution. The health sector should work on long-term solutions, the NEC agreed. The NEC also noted that South African nurses who are working abroad are exploited, so as Denosa we do not want a similar situation happening to Nurses from India that are being recruited into the country.
*       The NEC also noted the critical failure of the South African Nursing Council (SANC) to register qualified nurses on time. It was noted that, this failure does not do the nursing profession- that is confronting gross-staff shortages any favours. It was also emphasised that, the prevalent gross staff shortages of nurse's impact directly to efficient service delivery in the health sector.

Unsafe working environments

*       The NEC is very concerned and worried about the unsafe environment that is existing in hospitals across the country. The recent brutal shooting and killing of four hospital Managers in Seshego hospital in Limpopo, which is not in isolation just qualifies that indeed work environments in the health sector are not safe.
*       The NEC is extremely shocked about these unsafe environments because naturally hospitals have never been unsafe, so surely there is a need to strengthen security.
*       It was suggested that access controls and minimum service security systems should be implemented in hospitals.
*       The NEC also noted with concern the inefficient management of health services across the country.

2008 Budget.

*       The NEC approved the 2008 Budget

&lt; http://www.cosatu.org.za/ &gt; 2.1 Response to Terror Lekota

Patrick Craven, 22 October 2007

The Congress of South African Trade Unions condemns ANC national chairperson, Terror Lekota, for one-sidedly calling for T-Shirts in support of ANC Deputy president Jacob Zuma to be banned from party gatherings, while at the same time defending the wearing of T-Shirts with President Thabo Mbeki's image on it.

His comment raise an issue which is symptomatic of the poisoned atmosphere which is developing around the ANC succession contest - the way in which supporters of different candidates are promoting their favoured candidates in the run-up to the 52nd National Conference.

While many of those raising the issues of the T-shirts are advancing their own political agenda rather than making a point of principle, there are genuine problems about the growing and alarming trend to focus on individuals rather than the organisation and its policies.

It should be pointed out however that the T-shirts and posters with such slogans as '100 percent JZ' or 'Jacob Zuma, Zulu Boy', were produced two years ago at the start of the trials of the ANC Deputy President. They were printed by some of his grass-roots supporters who genuinely believed that he was the victim of a politically inspired campaign to discredit him and wanted this to be publicly exposed. Any leader did not sanction them.

They were also a response to the emails allegedly sent by Saki Macozoma and others, discrediting Jacob Zuma by using derogatory terms such as 'stupid Zulu boy'. There is still no credible way of checking whether these emails were genuine or, whether - as claimed mainly by those suspected of having been behind them - as hoaxes.

The outcome of the ANC's process to investigate these emails is still not known, since its report was dismissed on a technicality, and so there is still a huge cloud of doubt as to whether such emails ever really existed. The whole email saga was also symptomatic of the serious factional divisions, which now exist within the ANC, and it fuelled them still further.

The T-shirts do raise important questions about the use of tribalism, which even if it was done in response to provocative emails, could ignite dangerous tribalist sentiments that we know exist, and play into the hands of Jacob Zuma's opponents who want to portray him as essentially tribalist.

COSATU believes however that, aside from these particular T-shirts, there are legitimate grounds for concern at the growing culture of using portraits of individual leaders in the ANC leadership contest, particularly as the ANC logo appears to be getting smaller and smaller, as the faces of individuals grow bigger and bigger on T-shirts, posters and pamphlets.

The big danger is that if we allow this tendency to take root it will implant in the minds of the masses the idea that the leaders are more important than the organisation. It will create a dangerous culture of fear and sycophancy towards leaders, discourage people from objecting even when leaders make mistakes, strengthen leaders' factional hegemony, weaken organisational coherence and make rational discussion of issues more difficult.

If more and more images of a current and serving leader are printed, and that image is seen more and more in TV coverage, this promotes the hegemony of that leader even more, and he or she starts to believe they are more important than the organisation. This can become particularly dangerous if that leader begins to blunder and becomes discredited. Does it not then lead to the organisation itself also become discredited?

Should we not be promoting the ANC logo on T-shirts, rather than pictures of Thabo Mbeki, Jacob Zuma or Tokyo Sexwale?

COSATU is concerned at the growth of a foreign American culture, in which individuals campaign purely for themselves. No one in the ANC is not guilty of encouraging this invasive alien culture. Terror Lekota has hinted at this issue but raised it in a completely one-sided way, which does nothing to resolve the underlying problem.

Should we not be returning to the traditions of the ANC, which always put the interests of the organisation and the masses before those of any individual leader?

&lt; http://www.ycl.org.za/ &gt; 2.2 Statement on 'Lekota Blasts Zuma T - Shirts'.

Castro Ngobese, 22 October 2007

The Young Communist League [YCL] notes with utter disgust the despicable comments made during the weekend by ANC National Chairperson, Mosioua Lekota, regarding the adorning of T - shirts embodying the face of the African National Congress [ANC] Deputy President Jacob Zuma.

It is clear that Lekota is on a political offensive to speak malice against the Deputy President of the African National Congress [ANC], and further project both the Deputy President of the ANC and those sympathetic towards him as tribal chauvinist.

As the Young Communist League [YCL], we view these comments by the National Chairperson of the African National Congress [ANC] as a mere act of desperation on his part [Mosioua Lekota] for political recognition. This is further an ill - conceived political lobbying strategy on his part as we approach the Elective National Conference of the African National Congress [ANC] to converge in Limpopo, December 2007.

The African National Congress [ANC] leadership collective, which includes the ANC Deputy President Jacob Zuma, needs to reprimand Lekota in the strongest possible terms. His comments are undermining the unity and cohesion of the movement and further are deepening the political crisis as it relates to matters affecting the Deputy President of the ANC.

His comments further underscores the resolutions of the ANC National General Council [NGC] as it relates to the political support for the ANC Deputy President.
