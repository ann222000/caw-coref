I am executor-designate for my mother's estate.  In (preliminary)
discussions among the beneficiaries, there are some who want one brother
to get certain things that the will does not appear to call for.  Eg:
the will says only that he should get certain &quot;real property&quot;; they want
him to also get the contents of that property.  Again, the will says
that the remaining assets should be divided equally; they want him to
also get the car.

I'm not thrilled with this, but I'm willing to accept it.  It's not a
large portion of the total estate, and there's enough bitterness
already.  However, I do wonder just how far we can deviate from the
language of the will.  Are there any rules of thumb?

If we do it this way, and everyone signs something saying that they know
what they're doing, would that protect me from future liability?

(We do have an attorney, but I'm a little unsure how much to trust her:
it seems like either what the will says is just what my mother intended,
or the attorney didn't address what seem like very basic questions.)

TIA,
George

It's not clear whether all the beneficiaries have agreed to enrich one
brother at their own expense.  If so, why not have those beneficiaries
either disclaim their inheritance or take it and then gift it?

Have them make their swaps after the estate is settled if it's really
bugging you and the amounts aren't that great (as you post).

In general if everyone agrees, the court will go along.  If none of the
other beneficiaries have children, they can execute qualified
disclaimers, and anything they disclaim will go to the brother.  If not
it will be considered a gift to him - which they are certainly legally
able to do.

There is nothing preventing the beneficiaries from making gifts or
barter after the distribution of the estate.  This might have tax
consequences, though.  For example, my father died, everything went
to my mother, although there was agreement that since she didn't
drive, she didn't need the car, and of the (grown) children, I
needed the car most (having the crappiest car).  So she gave it to
me.  The value of the car was not enough to invoke gift taxes.

George,

The heirs to your mother's will want to divide the estate differently
from the way she specified in her will. You are the executor, and you
wonder how far to go in &quot;deviating&quot; from the language.

I'm not a lawyer, but my answer is: not by a hairsbreadth. If people
are all agreed now but later are unhappy or change their minds, any
deviation will come back to bite you in the ass.

Fortunately, you can keep everyone happy *and* keep yourself legally
in the clear. Simply distribute everything according to the terms of
the will, and let the heirs make gifts to each other as they choose.
They can do this without involving you in any way, just as any adult
can give personal property to any other adult. If they are truly all
in agreement as you say, this will be quite routine, and there should
be no tax consequences unless the gifts are much larger than you
imply.

legal on the net, always verify it on your own, in light of your
particular circumstances. You may also need to consult a lawyer.

If they submit a statement to the probate court that they agree with
the distribution, then why would it come back to the PR??

I asked a similar question on this list not long back and received some
excellent information and advice. (Thanks again all)

The one complication we had was the previous individuals in secession had
died and their estates had not been probated.  Due to Katrina we did not
have legal copies of their wells.

In the end we gave the problem to a lawyer who worked out the paperwork for
all concerned and managed to find a title company to cover the unlikely
event that a will would show up and not be in accordance with what we wanted
done.

All we're waiting for now is permsiion to rebulid.

As usual, the authoritative answer is  &quot;insufficient detail&quot;.  &lt;wry grin&gt;

*IF* the language of the will consists of two sections;
1) a list of 'specific bequests',
2) directions as the division of the 'unspecified' property.

Things specified in the first section _must_ be distributed as specified,
unlesss the beneficiary has predeceased the testator.

That which is covered by the second section is a somewhat more complex
issue.  Since nothing is specifically named, nor has an explicitly
assigned value -- there is no easy way determine, other than by 'selling
on the open market' (generally construed to be 'at auction'), all those items,
and dividing  the proceeds of that sale as specified.

However, *IF* _all_ the beneficiaries under that second section of the
will execute documents agreeing to a particular valuation assigned to
specific assets of the estate, then those ojects _themselves_ can be
distributed to beneficiaries as part of their 'share' of the 'proceeds'
of the estate.

Note: such a 'mutually agreed' valuation can be above or _below_ the 'fair
market value' of the item.  As long as _everybody_ with a possible 'interest'
in  the item signs off on the value, that *is* the value for estate
distribution purposes.

If _everbody_ involved wants to go this route, your attorney should be
ablde to trivially produce the appropriate paperwork.

They will blame him later -- &quot;you made us sign that statement&quot;. No,
it's not logical. It's human nature.

Well, that is how it's structured.  I assume your &quot;_must_&quot; does allow
the named beneficiary to decline the bequest?  (That's a separate
potential complication.)

It looks like it will go something like that.  Except for the things not
everyone can agree on.

Thanks to all who replied.
