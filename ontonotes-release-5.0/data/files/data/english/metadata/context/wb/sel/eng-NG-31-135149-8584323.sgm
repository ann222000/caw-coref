Pismo kernal panics and other mishaps

Hello everyone. I picked up a used 400MHz Pismo a month and a half
ago. For as long as I've had it (and likely several months
beforehand), it's had issues with seemingly random kernal panics.
Sometimes, it runs for hours or days without issues, and others, it
won't make it a few minutes without one. I have reseated the
processor/RAM daughtercard enough times to break off the plastic pull-
out tab, yet it still happens.

Occasionally, like the most recent event, I get numerous beeps when
trying to start it back up, along with a flashing status light.
Others, upon attempting to restart, the chime sounds extremely
distorted. Yesterday, after one KP incident, the computer started up
normally, but the screen was totally dead! It wasn't until several
hours and switching back to a creased screen I'd replaced before it
started working again on it's own.

Sometimes, jarring the computer seems to trigger it; other times,
it's sitting all but completely still when it happens. The fan
doesn't kick on, so I don't think it's truly overheating, but who
knows. Any ideas? I'd like to turn this into a completely reliable
laptop, since it's otherwise an excellent performer. Thanks in advance!

A damaged ram module can cause this sort of erratic behaviour.

The numerous beeps in my experience is associated with bad or incorrect RAM.  It could mean other things as well, but that is the most common problem.  The distorted chime could be from an improperly seated processor/daughter card.  i have experienced that as well.

Before you do anything else, try some different memory.  I know first hand that if you keep monkeying with the processor, you'll eventually put some stress on the logic board, and you'll begin having issues with it.  Sounds like that might be happening now since jarring the computer may trigger the issue. Bad memory will cause all kinds of issues and drive you out of your mind.

Best of luck!

The Pismo has 576MB of RAM in it; 64MB is from the original Apple
module which came with the machine, and the 512MB is from an Edge
brand 512MB module.Should I just go ahead and replace both of them
with a pair of 512MB OWC modules? I don't think I have anything
capable of fitting this machine which isn't already there, unless the
modules out of a Lombard will work...

What is the best way to reseat the daughterboard? I have tried

can take the sort of force which would make it seem as if the logic

the simple thing would be to sell ur prismo on ebay and buy a windows laptop
for the same price that will probs be double the spec.

Those beeps indicate that the rom'd self-test failed.

I think these are the right codes for the Pismo (not 100% sure tho):

* 1 beep  = No RAM has been detected.
* 2 beeps = The RAM is incompatible with your Mac.
* 3 beeps = None of the RAM banks passed the memory tests.
* 4 beeps = Bad checksum for the remainder of the boot ROM.
* 5 beeps = Bad checksum for the ROM boot block.

To diagnose this further, since you've already tried reseating
things, try installing AppleJack and the included Memtest.  Try
running Memtest overnight, from Single User mode (boot holding down
cmd-S).

&lt; http://www.versiontracker.com/dyn/moreinfo/macosx/19596 &gt;

The command to run Memtest is:

/usr/local/sbin/memtest all 5 -L

The 5 is for 5 passes; hit ^C to end it.  The -L makes it create a
log.  By running it overnight, it might be able to pinpoint which
stick of memory is causing the problem.

Good to know. The beep codes didn't return the next time I tried to
boot it up (which was successful), but I'll keep it in mind for the
next time that it occurs. It was definitely more than one beep, and
seemed like more than three.

Quick update: installed AppleJack, and attempted to run memtest using
the parameters. Unfortunately, it gave me an error saying that there
was no such directory. I checked, and indeed, there is no /local/
within /usr/. I checked /usr/sbin/, and no sign of memtest. Could use
some clarification.

I simply went through with the default install. Didn't know that it
was an additional option. Still, I figured that the /usr/local/sbin/
directory would at least be there to begin with, as Dan had stated.

Yet another update: The MemTest got through the first pass with
flying colors, then midway through the Solid Bits segment of the
second pass (at step 35 of 64), it appears to have gotten stuck. It
has been sitting there for hours, stuck on that one step. For awhile,
the CPU fan was running audibly, but now the unit seems to be making
nary a sound, perhaps a slight whirring from the HD or another fan. I
tried Control^C, with no effect. I just hope it isn't dead...

Bought myself a new kingston 512mb Micro SD except after about ten minutes
of using it i am no longer able to write to the card as it is write
protected, i cannot delete files or paste new ones or even format the card,
yet the files already written to it read fine i know its not a switch that
ive flicked up because i dont use the SD adapter im using a micro SD to usb
adapter and nothing will format it, i have tried Mac OSX, Windows XP,
Windows Vista, and a Samsung D900 Mobile phone none of which could format it
what is up with this card and how do i fix it.

thanks in advance
Ryan

If what I'm about to ask seems redundant or has already been addressed, then please forgive me.  Do you have OS 9 installed as well?  I'm curious as to whether it is acting up under OS 9 as well. OS 10 tends to be very picky about RAM, and OS 9 tends to not care what you have for RAM.  I have had kernel panics on a B&amp;W G3 under OS 10 due to incompatible RAM, but when running OS 9 on the same RAM, it was fine with no issues.  Just another thought.

Have you tried taking all the ram out and just running on the system ram?

Also if you decide to open it up, Im sure you already know this, but
Whatever you do try not to touch the motherboard too mutch,  i have broken
two ibooks from doing this for some reason just touching them seems to cause
them to break.

After they were completely broken all they would do is turn fan, cpu, ram
and LED's on.  The LCD didnt come on

It hadn't actually been addressed, no. I don't have OS 9 installed on
it. Whoever had it before me simply installed OS 10.4. According to
the panic log, it's been having these episodes since February, at the
least. I may install 9.2.2 from one of my other Macs to see if it
runs better that way.

I will note this: after it'd been frozen up so long during the second
MemTest pass, the CPU plate and heatsink were HOT! Probably would've
gotten a burn had I touched them for long enough. Are they supposed
to get that warm? Would bad RAM cause the CPU to heat up like that?

Sorry 'bout that, forgot it's not part of the default install.

As you discovered, the /usr/local tree isn't created until someone
actually needs it.  I guess Apple did this to keep the overhead down.

yuk.  Intermittant problems.  Sounds like it's happening in the

I's definitely something dastardly. The error occurred without the
computer being moved around at all. I just left it running, and found
it stuck, then checked later, and found it stuck with the fans going,
and later found it just plain stuck.

What do you mean by system RAM? I don't recall hearing that the Pismo
had any RAM on the motherboard, as iBooks do. This thing has an Edge
512MB stick in the top slot, and the stock 64MB stick in the bottom
slot, near that damned connector. Would single-user mode be able to
operate with just the 64MB stick installed?

Not sure what each stick is off-hand; where would this be listed? The
64MB one is stock, and the 512MB stick is much newer, so who knows.

When you're in single-user mode, all bets are off.  I don't think all
the heat sensing stuff is running.

The two sticks of memory.

I think 64 MB is too small.

Try running memtest with the 512 MB stick only, in the 64 MB stick's
slot.  If it fails, then you need to replace that stick of memory.
If it passes, then you know the stick is ok, but that other slot is
suspect - rerun the test with the dimm in the suspect slot, to make
sure it's not just a seating issue.

&gt; Try running memtest with the 512 MB stick only, in the 64 MB stick's

I will try that tonight. I hope the solution to this issue is simple,

It's a possibility.  Add a fan, to keep the room air
circulating ... see if that makes a diff.
My belief/instinct tho, is that it's a memory problem.
Hopefully not the slot itself; just a dying stick.  And I would
suspect the 3rd party stick (edge 512) before the one that came with
the machine because the new stick has been handled more -- static
risk, etc.
Not sure what each stick is

yea.  I just get confused between models.  Some use all
SO-DIMMs.  Some use a regular DIMM, laid flat, then use a SO-DIMM
in the 2nd slot.

An update: Things aren't looking good. Swapped the 512MB stick into
the bottom slot as requested, and reinstalled the daughtercard as
best as I could. Powered it up, and got a sequence of four beeps.
Turned it off, tried to reseat the daughtercard again, pressed the
power button yet again, and got...silence. No chime, no beeps, just
the whirring of the hard drive. That's all I've gotten since. No
matter how I reseat that daughtercard, or regardless of how much RAM
is installed, I get nothing but silence thus far. I hope I haven't
killed the damn thing... :(

just for purposes of diagnosis, unplug the pram battery for these tests... a
bad pram battery can cause problems, but removing it from the loops erases
them.  I had a pismo with a discharged pram battery, unplugged it, and it
booted fine wheras it did nothing before.  then i plugged it in so the pram
battery could charge and it now works fine.  so just for diagnosing what
these beeps mean, unplug the pram.

Tried that just now. No change in the condition whatsoever. Almost
seems to be something rattling around within the case. All in all,
this doesn't look very good at all...

why are you recommending windows on a mac problem forum? a 400mhz mac
processor goes much faster than a 400mhz windows processor, its been
proven look it up on google. And selling a laptop with issues already
means it will sell cheaper, meaning he probably won't have that much
money left over to buy a windows laptop matching those specs.

&gt; &gt;Date: Fri, 27 Jul 2007 12:49:14 -0400

&gt; &gt;Thanks for the suggestions so far!

&gt; &gt; &gt; The numerous beeps in my experience is associated with bad or
&gt; &gt; &gt; incorrect RAM.  It could mean other things as well, but that is the
&gt; &gt; &gt; most common problem.  The distorted chime could be from an
&gt; &gt; &gt; improperly seated processor/daughter card.  i have experienced that
&gt; &gt; &gt; as well.

&gt; &gt;The Pismo has 576MB of RAM in it; 64MB is from the original Apple
&gt; &gt;module which came with the machine, and the 512MB is from an Edge
&gt; &gt;brand 512MB module.Should I just go ahead and replace both of them
&gt; &gt;with a pair of 512MB OWC modules? I don't think I have anything
&gt; &gt;capable of fitting this machine which isn't already there, unless the
&gt; &gt;modules out of a Lombard will work...

&gt; &gt; &gt; Before you do anything else, try some different memory.  I know
&gt; &gt; &gt; first hand that if you keep monkeying with the processor, you'll
&gt; &gt; &gt; eventually put some stress on the logic board, and you'll begin
&gt; &gt; &gt; having issues with it.  Sounds like that might be happening now
&gt; &gt; &gt; since jarring the computer may trigger the issue. Bad memory will
&gt; &gt; &gt; cause all kinds of issues and drive you out of your mind.

&gt; &gt;What is the best way to reseat the daughterboard? I have tried
&gt; &gt;pressing it in with all of my might, and tapping the connector points
&gt; &gt;with a rubber screwdriver handle, all to no avail. I've heard that it
&gt; &gt;can take the sort of force which would make it seem as if the logic
&gt; &gt;board is about to snap; perhaps some sort of C-clamp is in order? I
&gt; &gt;would appreciate some suggestions.

I actually have a Windows laptop with better specs; I bought this
Pismo because it is a Mac, and one with fairly good specs for the
price. I prefer to use one of my many Macs whenever possible.
Unfortunately, I haven't had very good luck with PowerBooks in
general; I was hoping this Pismo would be different, but it's
actually taken several turns for the worst.

Getting back to the topic at hand, what is the most likely cause of
this issue, the processor/RAM daughtercard, or the logic board? I'd
rather not buy both unless I absolutely have to, but since this thing
seems completely dead, and I don't have any way of trying a swap, I
just can't be sure what the issue could possibly be. Since the
processor got so hot, I have a feeling that it might've just been
some sort of progressive failure within the CPU itself, but I can't
tell for myself.

Thanks for all the advice thus far, and I appreciate your responses
in the future.
-Adam

maybe you could get it repaired by someone else, it will cost more than
replacing the broken part yourself, but probably less than replacing a bunch
of parts because you don't know what is broken.

Figured I'd follow up on my earlier tale(s) of woe. After talking to
the eBay seller from whom I bought a replacement screen for this
Pismo, I decided to try and replace the CPU/RAM daughercard first
(since the logic board would be a whole lot harder to remove, and the
original CPU definitely took some abuse during the RAM test). Two
weeks and $34 later, the computer now chimes and boots as it should,
and hasn't frozen yet! (knock on wood) Thanks for all the advice.
