Warnings Added to Provigil Label

Warnings about the potential for serious rashes and psychiatric
symptoms have been added to the prescribing information for the
wakefulness-promoting agent Provigil (modafinil), the FDA has
announced.

Although rare, serious rashes -- including Stevens-Johnson syndrome,
toxic epidermal necrolysis, and rash with eosinophilia and systemic
symptoms -- have been reported in children and adults on the drug. In
addition, multiorgan hypersensitivity reactions have occurred.

Some patients also report experiencing anxiety, mania, hallucinations,
and suicidality on the drug. Thus, &quot;caution should be exercised when
Provigil is given to patients with a history of psychosis, depression,
or mania,&quot; the label states.

Finally, the label reminds providers that Provigil is not approved for
use in children for any indication.
