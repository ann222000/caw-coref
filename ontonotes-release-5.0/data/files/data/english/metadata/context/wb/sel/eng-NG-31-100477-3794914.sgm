I have a 2003 TL and while using an inverter for my laptop the fuse blew.
Does anyone know where
the fuse for the Accessory sockets are located?  Everything in the car works
except the accessory socket
and I have checked all the fuses listed in the owners manual.
Thanks

I'm not absolutely sure, but there might be a fuse in the line directly
behind the socket - try pulling it and see.

Ok there is a front and rear accessory socket in the 03 3.2 TL.  Both
are on the same 20A fuse (Fuse 9 in the Passengers underdash fuse box)
but they share the circuit with the radio.  The box is hidden to where
the average customer can't find it (another reason for you to come back
to Acura and give us you money) but if you open the pass. front door
and gently pull up on the plastic piece on the floor where the door
closes.  Then pull the weather stripping away from the front of the
door jam  Next the Plastic piece on the right side of the car under
your glove box can be gently pulled away and the fuse box is behind it.
Sorry I don't have a picture and Im not the best with directions but I
hope you have luck with it.  Feel free to post any questions and I'll
try to get back to them soon.
Also there is no fuse anywhere else in the circuit according to the
factory electrical schematic.
