'Hidden costs raise' US war price

The US wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are costing nearly double the
amount previously thought, according to a report by Democrats in the
US Congress.
They say &quot;hidden costs&quot; have pushed the total to about $1.5 trillion -
nearly twice the requested $804bn (£402bn).

Higher oil prices, treating wounded veterans, and the cost to the
economy of pulling reservists away from their jobs have been taken
into account.

The White House has called the report politically motivated.

&quot;This report was put out by Democrats on Capitol Hill,&quot; White House
press secretary Dana Perino was quoted by the Associated Press as
saying. &quot;This committee is known for being partisan and political.&quot;
&quot;They did not consult or co-operate with the Republicans on the
committee, and so I think it is an attempt to muddy the waters on what
has been some positive developments being reported out of Iraq.&quot;

And some of the figures the report contains were labelled speculative
by funding experts, the Washington Post newspaper reported.

'Lost earnings'

The report was written by Democratic members of Congress's Joint
Economic Committee (JEC).

The cost of the war... is becoming the first thing the people mention
after the loss of life when they are opposed to this war
Chuck Schumer
JEC chairman

The BBC's Justin Webb in Washington says it was designed to shock
Americans into stronger opposition to the war in Iraq.

The Democrats calculate that between 2002 and 2008 the campaigns in
Iraq and Afghanistan will have cost the average US family of four
about $20,900.

The report adds that the amount could rise to $46,400 over the next
decade.

It cites costs such as interest payments on money borrowed from abroad
to pay for the wars, lost investment in US businesses, and the cost of
oil market disruptions.

Oil prices have surged since the start of the war in Iraq, from about
$37 a barrel to more than $90 a barrel in recent weeks. The report
says the rise has hit US consumers.

'Unacceptable price'

The chairman of the JEC, Democratic Senator Chuck Schumer, said the
&quot;backbreaking cost&quot; of the war was becoming an unbearable burden for
American families.

&quot;What this report makes crystal clear is that the cost to our country
in lives lost and dollars spent is tragically unacceptable.&quot;

He said: &quot;The cost of the war... is becoming the first thing the
people mention after the loss of life when they are opposed to this
war and the people who mention it, many of them are not people who
were against the war in the past.&quot;

The report estimates that both wars could cost a total of $3.5
trillion over the next decade.

The Democratic authors estimated that treating veterans could add more
than $30bn to costs, including disability payments and lost earnings
for veterans affected by post-traumatic stress disorder.

This is so unfair to Baby Bush; look at what the this war has
ACHIEVED! The picture of the boy posing like a soldier is PRICELESS.
Cheney's 3,000% profit on his Haliburton stock is certainly a SUCCESS.
The doom &amp; gloom crowd cannot deny this fact: aside from the obscene
amount of money, unnecessary deaths, &amp; added years &amp; strength to al
Qaeda, Bush's war is WORTH IT.*
