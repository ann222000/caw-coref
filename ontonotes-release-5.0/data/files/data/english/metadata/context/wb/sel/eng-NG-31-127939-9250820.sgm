(II Eng)
Now the LORD said unto Abram: 'Get thee out of thy country, and from
thy kindred, and from thy father's house, unto the land

that I will show thee. And I will make of thee a great nation, and I
will bless thee, and make thy name great; and be thou a

blessing. And I will bless them that bless thee, and him that curseth
thee will I curse; and in thee shall all the families

of the earth be blessed.' So Abram went, as the LORD had spoken unto
him; and Lot went with him; and Abram was seventy and

five years old when he departed out of Haran. And Abram took Sarai his
wife, and Lot his brother's son, and all their

substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had gotten
in Haran; and they went forth to go into the land of

Canaan; and into the land of Canaan they came. And Abram passed
through the land unto the place of Shechem, unto the

terebinth of Moreh. And the Canaanite was then in the land. And the
LORD appeared unto Abram, and said: 'Unto thy seed will I

give this land'; and he builded there an altar unto the LORD, who
appeared unto him. And he removed from thence unto the

mountain on the east of Beth-el, and pitched his tent, having Beth-el
on the west, and Ai on the east; and he builded there

an altar unto the LORD, and called upon the name of the LORD. And
Abram journeyed, going on still toward the South. And there

was a famine in the land; and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn
there; for the famine was sore in the land. And it came

to pass, when he was come near to enter into Egypt, that he said unto
Sarai his wife: 'Behold now, I know that thou art a

fair woman to look upon. And it will come to pass, when the Egyptians
shall see thee, that they will say: This is his wife;

and they will kill me, but thee they will keep alive. Say, I pray
thee, thou art my sister; that it may be well with me for

thy sake, and that my soul may live because of thee.' And it came to
pass, that, when Abram was come into Egypt, the

Egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair. And the princes of
Pharaoh saw her, and praised her to Pharaoh; and the

woman was taken into Pharaoh's house. And he dealt well with Abram for
her sake; and he had sheep, and oxen, and he-asses,

and men-servants, and maid-servants, and she-asses, and camels. And
the LORD plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues

because of Sarai Abram's wife. And Pharaoh called Abram, and said:
'What is this that thou hast done unto me? why didst thou

not tell me that she was thy wife? Why saidst thou: She is my sister?
so that I took her to be my wife; now therefore behold

thy wife, take her, and go thy way.' And Pharaoh gave men charge
concerning him; and they brought him on the way, and his

wife, and all that he had. And Abram went up out of Egypt, he, and his
wife, and all that he had, and Lot with him, into the

South. And Abram was very rich in cattle, in silver, and in gold. And
he went on his journeys from the South even to Beth-el,

unto the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Beth-
el and Ai; unto the place of the altar, which he had

made there at the first; and Abram called there on the name of the
LORD. And Lot also, who went with Abram, had flocks, and

herds, and tents. And the land was not able to bear them, that they
might dwell together; for their substance was great, so

that they could not dwell together. And there was a strife between the
herdmen of Abram's cattle and the herdmen of Lot's

cattle. And the Canaanite and the Perizzite dwelt then in the land.
And Abram said unto Lot: 'Let there be no strife, I pray

thee, between me and thee, and between my herdmen and thy herdmen; for
we are brethren. Is not the whole land before thee?

separate thyself, I pray thee, from me; if thou wilt take the left
hand, then I will go to the right; or if thou take the

right hand, then I will go to the left.' And Lot lifted up his eyes,
and beheld all the plain of the Jordan, that it was well

watered every where, before the LORD destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah,
like the garden of the LORD, like the land of Egypt, as

thou goest unto Zoar. So Lot chose him all the plain of the Jordan;
and Lot journeyed east; and they separated themselves the

one from the other. Abram dwelt in the land of Canaan, and Lot dwelt
in the cities of the Plain, and moved his tent as far as

Sodom. Now the men of Sodom were wicked and sinners against the LORD
exceedingly. And the LORD said unto Abram, after that

Lot was separated from him: 'Lift up now thine eyes, and look from the
place where thou art, northward and southward and

eastward and westward; for all the land which thou seest, to thee will
I give it, and to thy seed for ever. And I will make

thy seed as the dust of the earth; so that if a man can number the
dust of the earth, then shall thy seed also be numbered.

Arise, walk through the land in the length of it and in the breadth of
it; for unto thee will I give it.' And Abram moved his

tent, and came and dwelt by the terebinths of Mamre, which are in
Hebron, and built there an altar unto the LORD. And it came

to pass in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar, Arioch king of
Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of Goiim,

that they made war with Bera king of Sodom, and with Birsha king of
Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, and Shemeber king of

Zeboiim, and the king of Bela - the same is Zoar. All these came as
allies unto the vale of Siddim - the same is the Salt

Sea. Twelve years they served Chedorlaomer, and in the thirteenth year
they rebelled. And in the fourteenth year came

Chedorlaomer and the kings that were with him, and smote the Rephaim
in Ashteroth- karnaim, and the Zuzim in Ham, and the

Emim in Shaveh-kiriathaim, and the Horites in their mount Seir, unto
El-paran, which is by the wilderness. And they turned

back, and came to En-mishpat - the same is Kadesh - and smote all the
country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites, that

dwelt in Hazazon-tamar. And there went out the king of Sodom, and the
king of Gomorrah, and the king of Admah, and the king

of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela - the same is Zoar; and they set the
battle in array against them in the vale of Siddim;

against Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of Goiim, and
Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar; four

kings against the five. Now the vale of Siddim was full of slime pits;
and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, and they

fell there, and they that remained fled to the mountain. And they took
all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their

victuals, and went their way. And they took Lot, Abram's brother's
son, who dwelt in Sodom, and his goods, and departed. And

there came one that had escaped, and told Abram the Hebrew - now he
dwelt by the terebinths of Mamre the Amorite, brother of

Eshcol, and brother of Aner; and these were confederate with Abram.
And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive,

he led forth his trained men, born in his house, three hundred and
eighteen, and pursued as far as Dan. And he divided

himself against them by night, he and his servants, and smote them,
and pursued them unto Hobah, which is on the left hand of

Damascus. And he brought back all the goods, and also brought back his
brother Lot, and his goods, and the women also, and

the people. And the king of Sodom went out to meet him, after his
return from the slaughter of Chedorlaomer and the kings

that were with him, at the vale of Shaveh - the same is the King's
Vale. And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread

and wine; and he was priest of God the Most High. And he blessed him,
and said: 'Blessed be Abram of God Most High, Maker of

heaven and earth; and blessed be God the Most High, who hath delivered
thine enemies into thy hand.' And he gave him a tenth

of all. And the king of Sodom said unto Abram: 'Give me the persons,
and take the goods to thyself.' And Abram said to the

king of Sodom: 'I have lifted up my hand unto the LORD, God Most High,
Maker of heaven and earth, that I will not take a

thread nor a shoe-latchet nor aught that is thine, lest thou shouldest
say: I have made Abram rich; save only that which the

young men have eaten, and the portion of the men which went with me,
Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre, let them take their portion.'

After these things the word of the LORD came unto Abram in a vision,
saying: 'Fear not, Abram, I am thy shield, thy reward

shall be exceeding great.' And Abram said: 'O Lord GOD, what wilt Thou
give me, seeing I go hence childless, and he that

shall be possessor of my house is Eliezer of Damascus?' And Abram
said: 'Behold, to me Thou hast given no seed, and, lo, one

born in my house is to be mine heir.' And, behold, the word of the
LORD came unto him, saying: 'This man shall not be thine

heir; but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be
thine heir.' And He brought him forth abroad, and said:

'Look now toward heaven, and count the stars, if thou be able to count
them'; and He said unto him: 'So shall thy seed be.'

And he believed in the LORD; and He counted it to him for
righteousness. And He said unto him: 'I am the LORD that brought

thee out of Ur of the Chaldees, to give thee this land to inherit it.'
And he said: 'O Lord GOD, whereby shall I know that I

shall inherit it?' And He said unto him: 'Take Me a heifer of three
years old, and a she-goat of three years old, and a ram

of three years old, and a turtle-dove, and a young pigeon.' And he
took him all these, and divided them in the midst, and

laid each half over against the other; but the birds divided he not.
And the birds of prey came down upon the carcasses, and

Abram drove them away. And it came to pass, that, when the sun was
going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram; and, lo, a

dread, even a great darkness, fell upon him. And He said unto Abram:
'Know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a

land that is not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict
them four hundred years; and also that nation, whom

they shall serve, will I judge; and afterward shall they come out with
great substance. But thou shalt go to thy fathers in

peace; thou shalt be buried in a good old age. And in the fourth
generation they shall come back hither; for the iniquity of

the Amorite is not yet full.' And it came to pass, that, when the sun
went down, and there was thick darkness, behold a

smoking furnace, and a flaming torch that passed between these pieces.
In that day the LORD made a covenant with Abram,

saying: 'Unto thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt
unto the great river, the river Euphrates; the Kenite,

and the Kenizzite, and the Kadmonite, and the Hittite, and the
Perizzite, and the Rephaim, and the Amorite, and the

Canaanite, and the Girgashite, and the Jebusite.' Now Sarai Abram's
wife bore him no children; and she had a handmaid, an

Egyptian, whose name was Hagar. And Sarai said unto Abram: 'Behold
now, the LORD hath restrained me from bearing; go in, I

pray thee, unto my handmaid; it may be that I shall be builded up
through her.' And Abram hearkened to the voice of Sarai.

And Sarai Abram's wife took Hagar the Egyptian, her handmaid, after
Abram had dwelt ten years in the land of Canaan, and gave

her to Abram her husband to be his wife. And he went in unto Hagar,
and she conceived; and when she saw that she had

conceived, her mistress was despised in her eyes. And Sarai said unto
Abram: 'My wrong be upon thee: I gave my handmaid into

thy bosom; and when she saw that she had conceived, I was despised in
her eyes: the LORD judge between me and thee.' But

Abram said unto Sarai: 'Behold, thy maid is in thy hand; do to her
that which is good in thine eyes.' And Sarai dealt harshly

with her, and she fled from her face. And the angel of the LORD found
her by a fountain of water in the wilderness, by the

fountain in the way to Shur. And he said: 'Hagar, Sarai's handmaid,
whence camest thou? and whither goest thou?' And she

said: 'I flee from the face of my mistress Sarai.' And the angel of
the LORD said unto her: 'Return to thy mistress, and

submit thyself under her hands.' And the angel of the LORD said unto
her: 'I will greatly multiply thy seed, that it shall

not be numbered for multitude. And the angel of the LORD said unto
her: 'Behold, thou art with child, and shalt bear a son;

and thou shalt call his name Ishmael, because the LORD hath heard thy
affliction. And he shall be a wild ass of a man: his

hand shall be against every man, and every man's hand against him; and
he shall dwell in the face of all his brethren.' And

she called the name of the LORD that spoke unto her, Thou art a God of
seeing; for she said: 'Have I even here seen Him that

seeth Me?' Wherefore the well was called 'Beer-lahai-roi; behold, it
is between Kadesh and Bered. And Hagar bore Abram a son;

and Abram called the name of his son, whom Hagar bore, Ishmael. And
Abram was fourscore and six years old, when Hagar bore

Ishmael to Abram. And when Abram was ninety years old and nine, the
LORD appeared to Abram, and said unto him: 'I am God

Almighty; walk before Me, and be thou wholehearted. And I will make My
covenant between Me and thee, and will multiply thee

exceedingly.' And Abram fell on his face; and God talked with him,
saying: 'As for Me, behold, My covenant is with thee, and

thou shalt be the father of a multitude of nations. Neither shall thy
name any more be called Abram, but thy name shall be

Abraham; for the father of a multitude of nations have I made thee.
And I will make thee exceeding fruitful, and I will make

nations of thee, and kings shall come out of thee. And I will
establish My covenant between Me and thee and thy seed after

thee throughout their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be a
God unto thee and to thy seed after thee. And I will

give unto thee, and to thy seed after thee, the land of thy
sojournings, all the land of Canaan, for an everlasting

possession; and I will be their God.' And God said unto Abraham: 'And
as for thee, thou shalt keep My covenant, thou, and thy

seed after thee throughout their generations. This is My covenant,
which ye shall keep, between Me and you and thy seed after

thee: every male among you shall be circumcised. And ye shall be
circumcised in the flesh of your foreskin; and it shall be a

token of a covenant betwixt Me and you. And he that is eight days old
shall be circumcised among you, every male throughout

your generations, he that is born in the house, or bought with money
of any foreigner, that is not of thy seed. He that is

born in thy house, and he that is bought with thy money, must needs be
circumcised; and My covenant shall be in your flesh

for an everlasting covenant. And the uncircumcised male who is not
circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin, that soul shall

be cut off from his people; he hath broken My covenant.' And God said
unto Abraham: 'As for Sarai thy wife, thou shalt not

call her name Sarai, but Sarah shall her name be. And I will bless
her, and moreover I will give thee a son of her; yea, I

will bless her, and she shall be a mother of nations; kings of peoples
shall be of her.' Then Abraham fell upon his face, and

laughed, and said in his heart: 'Shall a child be born unto him that
is a hundred years old? and shall Sarah, that is ninety

years old, bear?' And Abraham said unto God: 'Oh that Ishmael might
live before Thee!' And God said: &quot;Nay, but Sarah thy wife

shall bear thee a son; and thou shalt call his name Isaac; and I will
establish My covenant with him for an everlasting

covenant for his seed after him. And as for Ishmael, I have heard
thee; behold, I have blessed him, and will make him

fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly; twelve princes shall he
beget, and I will make him a great nation. But My

covenant will I establish with Isaac, whom Sarah shall bear unto thee
at this set time in the next year.' And He left off

talking with him, and God went up from Abraham. And Abraham took
Ishmael his son, and all that were born in his house, and

all that were bought with his money, every male among the men of
Abraham's house, and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin

in the selfsame day, as God had said unto him. And Abraham was ninety
years old and nine, when he was circumcised in the

flesh of his foreskin. And Ishmael his son was thirteen years old,
when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin. In

the selfsame day was Abraham circumcised, and Ishmael his son. And all
the men of his house, those born in the house, and

those bought with money of a foreigner, were circumcised with him.

(II) Haftarah Eng
Why sayest thou, O Jacob, and speakest, O Israel: 'My way is hid from
the LORD, and my right is passed over from my God'?

Hast thou not known? hast thou not heard that the everlasting God, the
LORD, the Creator of the ends of the earth, fainteth

not, neither is weary? His discernment is past searching out. He
giveth power to the faint; and to him that hath no might He

increaseth strength. Even the youths shall faint and be weary, and the
young men shall utterly fall; But they that wait for

the LORD shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings as
eagles; they shall run, and not be weary; they shall

walk, and not faint. Keep silence before Me, O islands, and let the
peoples renew their strength; let them draw near, then

let them speak; let us come near together to judgment. Who hath raised
up one from the east, at whose steps victory

attendeth? He giveth nations before him, and maketh him rule over
kings; his sword maketh them as the dust, his bow as the

driven stubble. He pursueth them, and passeth on safely; the way with
his feet he treadeth not. Who hath wrought and done it?

He that called the generations from the beginning. I, the LORD, who am
the first, and with the last am the same. The isles

saw, and feared; the ends of the earth trembled; they drew near, and
came. They helped every one his neighbour; and every one

said to his brother: 'Be of good courage.' So the carpenter encouraged
the goldsmith, and he that smootheth with the hammer

him that smiteth the anvil, saying of the soldering: 'It is good'; and
he fastened it with nails, that it should not be

moved. But thou, Israel, My servant, Jacob whom I have chosen, the
seed of Abraham My friend; Thou whom I have taken hold of

from the ends of the earth, and called thee from the uttermost parts
thereof, and said unto thee: 'Thou art My servant, I

have chosen thee and not cast thee away'; Fear thou not, for I am with
thee, be not dismayed, for I am thy God; I strengthen

thee, yea, I help thee; yea, I uphold thee with My victorious right
hand. Behold, all they that were incensed against thee

shall be ashamed and confounded; they that strove with thee shall be
as nothing, and shall perish. Thou shalt seek them, and

shalt not find them, even them that contended with thee; they that
warred against thee shall be as nothing, and as a thing of

nought. For I the LORD thy God hold thy right hand, who say unto thee:
'Fear not, I help thee.' Fear not, thou worm Jacob,

and ye men of Israel; I help thee, saith the LORD, and thy Redeemer,
the Holy One of Israel. Behold, I make thee a new

threshing-sledge having sharp teeth; thou shalt thresh the mountains,
and beat them small, and shalt make the hills as chaff.

Thou shalt fan them, and the wind shall carry them away, and the
whirlwind shall scatter them; and thou shalt rejoice in the

LORD, thou shalt glory in the Holy One of Israel.
(Isaiah 40:27-41:16)
