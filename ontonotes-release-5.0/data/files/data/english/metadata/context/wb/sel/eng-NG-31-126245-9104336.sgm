In the description of volatilization of organic soils in a self-cleaning
oven, there is a statement that, under conditions of heating, the light,
volatile substances and liquid substances are broken down and gasified
sequentially, followed by 最終的には重炭素質化（褐色化）する.

A Google search of &quot;重炭素質化&quot; comes back with zero hits.  I am tempted to
go with &quot;carbonization,&quot; which I have heard used to describe the blackening
phenomenon when food burns, but I have a hunch that the term is entirely
inaccurate, and only used by those of us who are ignorant of what is
actually happening.  (When things burn, isn't the carbon oxidized into
carbon dioxide, leaving only NON-carbon materials?) If I am correct that
this is a misnomer in English, is this an equivalent misnomer in Japanese?

At any rate, is anybody familiar with this term, &quot;重炭素質化&quot;?

Thanks.

***********************************************
Where to start...
The short answer (for those who don't want a chemistry lesson) is that I would translate 重炭素質化 as &quot;charring&quot;, or &quot;heavy carbonization&quot; if you want to go chokuyaku.  I've not seen 重炭素質化 before, but that's what I would use.
As you have probably figure out, 褐色化 is usually rendered as &quot;browning&quot;, but I would use &quot;caramelization&quot; (sometimes spelled &quot;carmelization&quot;) in this context.

What exactly are &quot;organic soils&quot;?  Is that a term for food residues and other kinds of junk?
When organic things burn, much of the carbon is indeed combined with oxygen and volatilized as carbon dioxide or carbon monoxide.  Depending on the structure of the initial substrate, temperature, moisture, oxygen availability and efficiency in flushing away the volatile products produced, the material might be completely burned to yield only CO2 and CO; alternatively, varying amounts of residue might be left behind, where this residue (the &quot;char&quot;) cannot burn effectively under the given conditions.  One reason for this is that a tightly networked structure is formed on the surface (the result of polymerization, condensation, oxidation, and similar kinds of reactions) and no more oxygen can permeate into the bulk to participate in combustion.  Sometimes this is good, as when designing fabics or household or automotive materials that should be combustion resistant.
These residues have complex polymeric structures, but generally have a very low hydrogen/carbon ratio.  The name of this &quot;carbonization&quot; process (also called &quot;charring&quot;, a word derived from the same roots) reflects this greater preponderance of carbon over hydrogen.  The less hydrogen, the less readily flammable.  Compare a lump of coal with 100 mL of gasoline.
In Japanese, I most often see チャー for &quot;char&quot;, which is obviously a loan.  If I were to design a native Japanese equivalent of &quot;charring&quot;, 重炭素質化 would do nicely, but as you say there are no googits for this version.  &quot;Heavy carbonization&quot; does pull down some googits, mainly in the materials science field.  If it were me, since the context is oven cleaning, I would use &quot;charring&quot; and put &quot;heavy carbonization&quot; in a note as an alternative.

Wow! Thank you, Mr. Schlecht for an amazingly thorough and helpful answer.

In answer to your question, the &quot;soil&quot; (and &quot;soiling&quot;) is an attempt to
translate that difficult word &quot;汚れ.&quot; (I am not entirely happy with &quot;soil,&quot;
but I felt better about it than the alternatives I have used in other cases,
such as contaminant, grime, filth, dirt, stain, crud, and pollutant.)

Just to make sure -- if I went chokuyaku with this word, &quot;heavy&quot; suits your
chemically-savvy sensibilities better than &quot;double&quot; or &quot;multiple&quot; or
something along the line of the other common meaning for &quot;重&quot;?

Thanks.

Warren

Funny...

I am such a poor copy editor that I noticed neither of these typos when I
read your response. (I wish I knew how to develop better editing skills....)

I see the problem with 汚れ.  How about &quot;waste&quot;, &quot;organic waste&quot; or &quot;waste residue&quot;?  &quot;Food residue&quot; would be what an English-speaking technical author would write, but that is adding a lot to the Japanese.
&quot;Heavy&quot; is the only reading for 重 that works for me in the phrase 重炭素質化; &quot;double&quot; or &quot;multiple&quot; would be nonsense.

Thank you again for the confirmation about &quot;heavy.&quot;

&quot;Waste&quot; doesn't quite ring true to my ear, as it sounds almost like an
intentional byproduct. Reading descriptions of oven cleaners on the web, I
see the words &quot;grime&quot; and &quot;spatter&quot; used a lot. I worry though that &quot;grime&quot;
would imply greasy food residue so strongly as to exclude, for example,
hardened baked-on cheese. (I think of &quot;grime&quot; as being soft and gritty, not
hardened...) &quot;Spatter&quot; has the problem of implying the process by which the
food residue got onto the oven wall... perhaps excluding drips and spills on
the oven floor.... I like &quot;food residue,&quot; but, as this is a patent for
litigation, I am hesitant to deviate quite so far from the Japanese.

So for the time being, I think I will go with &quot;soil&quot; -- unless somebody has
a better word that doesn't deviate from &quot;choku&quot; too terribly.

&quot;organic soil&quot; went against my instincts too, but dr. google shows
that the oven industry uses this term.
