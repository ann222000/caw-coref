The contributions of Islamic scientists and technologists in the varied
fields of knowledge were fascinating and are discussed in the various
histories of science[2]. These contributions, using mainly the medium of
Arabic, were made by a wide variety of individuals - Muslim and non-Muslim -
living in a multi­national and multiracial society.

The universal religion of Islam provided the matrix within which the
multiracial and multicultural Islamic society could subscribe to a universal
science. The ethnic and cultural diversity of the Islamic world was a source
of strength and creativity to the movement of scientists, ideas and
products.

The introduction of efficient and extensive means of transportation
fa­cilitated the expansion of trade and the movement of people and ideas.
These advances in transport and trade gave force to the universal precepts
of Islam by facilitating the transfer of knowledge within the Islamic world;
and also to the widely different cultures of India, China and Europe.

The locus of scientific creativity in the Muslim world was not fixed.
Centres of considerable scientific activity flourished at different times
and were generally closely associated with the seat of power. During the
Umayyad and Abbasid periods, the capitals of the Islamic world attracted
scholars and scientists. In modern parlance, there was a brain drain to
Damascus and Baghdad. Once the centres of power moved to Cairo, Spain,
Persia (Mongolian period) and Istanbul, the flow of scientists followed
there.

During the first centuries of Islam, the rulers pursued policies which
promoted rationality, communications, trade and economic prosperity. These
policies increased the demand for science and technology. Almost every
aspect of life - from agriculture to health and prayers - depended on some
scientific or technical activity.

The decline, which set in after a combination of internal and external
circumstances and conditions, caused a decrease in the demand for science
and technology.

Science Thrives Only in Affluent Societies

The Thesis of Ibn Khaldun

The challenging question that is always asked is: what were the causes of
the decline of scientific work in Islam, and why did the gap in modern
science and technology become so great between the West and Islam from the
end of the sixteenth century? This is a complex question which cannot be
dealt with fully in this paper, but we shall venture to discuss some aspects
of the decline which, it is hoped, will stimulate further research into this
question.

At the time when scientific communities in Europe were on the increase, all
the regions of Islam were witnessing the decline of science and of
scientific communities. This phenomenon is discussed by Ibn Khaldun in more
than one chapter in his Introduction (al-Muqaddima).[3] He discusses the
factors which are essential to the flourishing of the sciences and the other
professions, and the factors which lead to their decline. One chapter
carries the title: `That the Professions are Perfected and Become Plenty
when the Demand for them Increases.' [4] He says that if a profession is in
great demand, people will try to learn it, whereas if there is no demand for
a profession it will be neglected and will disappear. `There is here another
secret, and it is that the professions and their perfection are demanded by
the state, which is the greatest marketplace for the professions', and the
needs of the state are so great that the demands of private individuals are
too small in comparison, which means that when the state declines all
professions decline as well. Another chapter carries the title: `That
Regions which Approach a Ruinous State will Become Devoid of the
Professions.' [5] When a region becomes weakened, loses its affluence, and
its population decreases, the professions will diminish, because they can no
longer be afforded, until they finally disappear. He devotes a special
chapter to the sciences under the title: `That the Sciences Increase with
the Increase in Prosperity and with the Greatness of Civilization in a
Region.' [6] After a dis­cussion of his theory he says: `Let us consider
what we have known about conditions in Baghdad, Cordoba, al-Qairawan,
al-Basra, and al-Kufa. When these cities became populous and prosperous in
the first centuries of Islam and civilization became established in them,
the seas of science rose and overflowed and scientists marvelled in the
terminology and the technicalities of learning and of the various sciences,
and in devising various problems and theories until they excelled over the
ancients and surpassed those who came after. But when the prosperity of
these cities and their civilization decreased and when their population was
dispersed, that carpet, with all that was on it, was completely folded and
science and learning were lost in them and moved to other regions of Islam.'
In discussing the rational sciences, Ibn Khaldun gives the same analysis,
and he remarks that when the empire became established, and when Islamic
civilization surpassed all others, Muslims studied eagerly the rational
sciences of the ancients until they excelled over them. He remarks that
during his time (the second half of the fourteenth century), the rational
sci­ences in the Maghrib and in al-Andalus were diminishing because
prosperity in these regions was at a low level, whereas in the Eastern
regions of Islam, especially in Persia and beyond to Transoxania, the
rational sciences were flourishing because of the prosperity of these
regions and the stability of their civilization. Ibn Khaldun was aware also
that during his time, the rational sciences in Rome, and in Europe in
general, were in great demand, and that there existed in these countries
active scientific communities. [7]

The ideas of Ibn Khaldun are repeated by modern scholars. Thus Bernal in his
book Science in History  [8] repeats in a similar argument that `Science's
flourishing periods are found to coincide with economic activity and
technical advance. The track science had followed - from Egypt and
Mesopotamia to Greece, from Islamic Spain to Renaissance Italy, thence to
the Low Countries and France, and then to Scotland and England of the
Industrial Revolution - is the same as that of commerce and industry.
Between the bursts of activity there have been quiet times, sometimes
periods of degeneration. These co­incide with periods when the organization
of society was stagnant or deca­dent.'

Stagnation of Medieval Science and the Need for a  Revolution

The above discussion helps to explain why the Scientific Revolution did not
take place in Islam. Until the end of the fifteenth century, scientific
knowledge was dominated by few major systems which became dogmatic and
static. The main ones were Aristotelian physics, Ptolemaic astronomy,
Galenic medicine, and Jabirian alchemy. Science had reached a point where
further progress became extremely difficult or even impossible.[9] This
explains the scarcity of important scientific progress both in Islam and in
medieval Europe between the thirteenth and the fifteenth centuries. To
achieve major breakthroughs in science, it was necessary to overthrow the
old dominant systems. In other words, a revolution in science was necessary.
Such a revolution requires the existence of a large community of scientists
who are working diligently within a flourishing economy and a stable
atmosphere over a long period of time. Contrary to the world of Islam, this
community existed in Europe after the fifteenth century and it continued on
the rise with the increase of European wealth and population, and the
domination by Europe of other parts of the world.

Islam and Science

The Wrong Diagnosis - I - The Theologians

From the nineteenth century, some writers have suggested that the decline of
science in Islam was caused by the negative attitude of Muslim theologians.
Thus Sachau says, `The fourth century (Islamic calendar) is the turning
point in the history of the spirit of Islam. But for al-Ash`ari and
al-Ghazali, the Arabs might have been a nation of Galileos, Keplers, and
Newtons  [10] Speaking about al-Ash`ari, E.G. Browne compared the
destructiveness of his influence to that of Jenghiz Khan and Hulagu. [11]  A
similar point of view is adopted by George Sarton, who labels the views of
al-Ash`ari and al-Ghazali as scholasticism, which 'were obstacles to the
progress of science in the Middle Ages.[12]. Sarton says that until the
sixteenth century, developments in science were taking place both in the
East and the West, but after that time Western science began to grow at an
accelerated pace, while Eastern civilization remained at a standstill, or
even deteriorated. He concludes that the essential difference between East
and West is that the latter overcame scholasticism, while the former did
not.

It is true that the divergence between Islam and the West in science
continued to increase after the sixteenth century, but the assumption that
the opposition of theologians to science was the cause of this, cannot be
sup­ported. The real causes are both political and economic, as was
demonstrated by Ibn Khaldun; the decrease of interest in the rational
sciences and the continued interest in the study of the religious sciences
are unrelated. The former was a symptom of the economic weakness of the
Islamic states and of their decreasing political power. Had there been a
need for science and tech­nology, as was the case during the Golden Age of
the Islamic Empire, the rational sciences would have continued to progress
without interruption. In Islam, there was no single religious authority that
controlled the whole educational system, and this left the system free and
not dominated by orthodoxy. The rise of scientists and the flourishing of
the rational sciences in the Golden Age reflected the prosperity of the
empire and its strength, and the large number of mathematicians,
astronomers, physicians, engineers and other kinds of scientists was in
response to the needs of society and of the empire in that period. It
conformed to the law of supply and demand.

It is not our purpose here to defend the theologians. It should be pointed
out, however, that the debate which took place between them and the
phi­losophers was not over the rational sciences. From the beginning, the
study of mathematics, astronomy, medicine, alchemy and the other sciences
was greatly encouraged, and it was mostly undertaken by scholars who were
non-philosophers and non-theologians themselves. The Golden Age of science
took place at the same time as the debate between theologians and
philoso­phers was taking place. The study of the rational sciences was not
affected by such a debate, since the pursuit of these sciences was
independent from both the theological and the philosophical studies. To
illustrate our statement, let us take the reigns of al-Ma'mun and of
al-Mutawakkil. Al-Ma'mun (813-833) was a staunch supporter of the
Mu`tazilites and the rational sciences flourished during his reign. Contrary
to him, al-Mutawakkil (847-861) was, according to one orientalist, [13] `of
the strictest orthodoxy and fanatical in his orthodoxy...'. During his time
`the forces of orthodoxy began to gather momentum', and the orthodox
theologians , whose front was led shortly later by al-Ash`ari,put up an
organized front against the Muctazilites  But, with his `orthodoxy and
fanaticism',, al-Mutawakkil like al-Ma'mun `was a patron of science and
scholarship and reopened the Dar al-Hikma, granting it fresh endowments. The
best work of translation was done during his reign... He was a generous
patron of scientific research... The best work of Dar al-Hikma was done
under him, for by that time experience told, and Hunayn was surrounded by
well-trained pupils.'

The Wrong Diagnosis - II -The Madrasa System

In a similar line of thinking, the decline of the rational sciences in Islam
is attributed by some writers to the fact that the madrasa system which
flourished after the founding of the Nizamiyya Madrasa in Baghdad by Nizam
al-Mulk. in 459/1067 favoured the study of theology and law.[14] But the
study of the rational sciences in Islam was always undertaken independently,
and the theological studies were not usually undertaken under the same
teachers or at the same institutions. Astronomy and mathematics were pursued
mostly in the observatories, within a community of mathematicians and
astronomers, where a specialized library was available and observational
instruments were in constant use. The medical sciences were studied, as they
should be, in the medical school of a bimaristan (hospital). The other
sciences were studied under individual renowned scientists, most often
patronized by the rulers, to whom students travelled from the far realms of
Islam. The existence of these individual renowned teachers constituted what
may be called a college of professors within a certain large city or a
region. Let us not forget also the libraries and the academies, like Dar
al-Hikma in Baghdad, which were devoted to research and to the study of the
rational sciences. Most of the madrasas, on the other hand, were established
by persons in power or by pious and wealthy individuals who endowed a part
of their wealth to a waqf which supported the school. The purpose was always
religious, and the studies were naturally mainly those of law and theology.
It can be said therefore that the madrasa was mainly a college of theology
and law, and it was, according to recent studies, the forerunner of the
college system in Western universities.[15] But the universities which
appeared in the West and which comprised several colleges for theology, law,
arts and sciences, and medicine, did not develop in Islam in the same
period. This is due to the fact that the madrasas which were supported by
the waqf system, and with them the study of law and theology, continued to
exist without interruption, whereas the centres for the study of the
rational sciences, which were dependent on the strength and the prosperity
of the state, deteriorated and ceased to exist with the decline of the
Islamic states, and for this reason scientific knowledge did not keep in
line with the quick advances of science in Europe after the Scientific
Revolution. In the period preceding this revolution it was possible to speak
about the achievements of Muslim scientists and compare them to those of
medieval Europe. Advances in both areas were parallel and there was not a
significant difference between them. But after the new discoveries of
Copernicus, Galileo and Newton and the fall of the old systems of knowledge,
the university in the West became the centre of the new scientific
activities. For the Scientific Revolution which took place in Europe to have
happened in Islam at the same time, there would have to have been in
existence at that time in history an efficient system of communications
between members of the scientific communities in both cultural areas. But
such a system did not exist; there were no Islamic universities which
comprised all branches of knowledge, and the Islamic scientific community
was almost non-existent. It was only in modern times that universities on
the model of the European ones started to appear in the Islamic countries.
Some of the older universities, such as al-Azhar, which followed the madrasa
system and were devoted to the study of Islamic law and theology, have only
recently introduced science, engineering and medicine into their curricula.

Having thus established the link between the decline of Islamic science and
the decline of the Islamic lands both in political power and material
wealth, the question which remains to be answered is: what are the factors
behind the decline of the Islamic lands? And although the discussion of this
subject lies in the domain of political and economic history, and not in the
scope of the history of science, yet we shall summarize what we think are
the major factors in the decline.

Factors behind the Decline of Muslim Power and Prosperity

The Nature of the Land

Most of the core Islamic countries, or the lands of the Islamic Middle East,
are composed of arid or semi-arid lands with some scattered inhabited lands
and large uncultivated or desert areas.[16] Taking the lands of the early
Islamic empire, excluding Spain, the inhabited area did not exceed one
quarter of the total, the rest being barren or desert lands. Even the
inhabited areas are mostly dependent on irrigation for their cultivation,
since the rainfall in most of the areas is not sufficient to support
agriculture. This ecology of the Middle East meant that its most productive
agriculture was confined mainly to the basins of the great rivers of the
Nile, the Euphrates and the Tigris. But the harnessing or utilization of the
waters of these rivers could not be attempted by individuals, and this job
had been undertaken since the days of the ancient civilizations of Egypt and
Babylonia by the strong central governments. Also in the first centuries of
the Islamic empire, during the Umayyads and the Abbasids, the caliphs and
the governors of the provinces gave great attention to the construction and
the maintenance of the irrigation systems. And it is well known that an
agricultural revolution took place in the first centuries of the Islamic
empire. When the central government was weakened or disappeared, the
irrigation works were neglected, and when, in addition, these works were
destroyed by the Mongol invasions, as had happened in Iraq in the thirteenth
century, agricultural lands became arid or turned into marshes and the whole
economy and civilization of the region were destroyed.

Some changes in climate and in the rate of rainfall contributed also to the
conversion of agricultural lands into arid. At the beginning of the Islamic
period and until the middle of the thirteenth century, the area east of
Antioch in Syria was one of high rainfall, and it saw the founding of many
cities and much farming was taking place. Yet within a few centuries, the
territory be­came arid.

The important consequence of this ecology is that the area is considered a
poor one from an agricultural point of view. It cannot depend only on
agriculture for its prosperity and for the development of its civilization.

The Nomads

Another result of the ecology of the Middle East is that the semi-arid
nature of the region, and the decline and the destruction of its irrigation
systems, resulted in a phenomenon which is also peculiar to it. There
existed throughout the history of the civilizations of the area, nomadic
tribes who utilized the peripheral lands as pastures for animal breeding.
The nomadic tribes always affected the stability of the central government
and the economy of the region. When the central government was strong and
the economy was prosperous, the nomads were usually kept under control.
Whenever the central government was weakened, the nomadic tribes would
prevail and influence or dominate the various individual governments in the
region causing further disorder and anarchy. With the destruction of the
irrigation works and the transformation of irrigated lands into pastures or
marshes, the nomads increased the areas under their immediate control, and
thus the decline of civilization was further accelerated. This process of
the conversion of irrigated lands into arid or marsh lands and the
encroachment of nomads into previously settled areas led also to the
depopulation of Iraq and Syria from the thirteenth century until the modern
era.

Natural Disasters

Another important phenomenon in the social and economic history of Egypt,
Syria and Iraq in the Middle Ages was the drastic depopulation caused by
natural disasters.[17] In 968, the low level of the Nile caused a terrible
famine which resulted in the death of about 600,000 people. Similar famines
followed. One terrible famine, which was caused also by a low level of the
Nile, lasted seven years between 1066 and 1072. Peasants deserted their
villages and agricultural production was diminished severely. These famines
heralded the beginning of a series of natural disasters which resulted in
the depopulation of Egypt. In 1201 and 1202 a terrible famine was followed
by plague and large numbers of people died. In many villages only empty
houses remained; and in some quarters in Cairo all the inhabitants died.
This was one of the major demographic disasters which befell Egypt in the
Middle Ages.

However, the greatest catastrophe in the Middle Ages was the plague of 1347,
1348 and 1349, which was known in Europe as the Black Death and which swept
across the Islamic world and Europe. Thousands died every day, and the
population of Egypt, Syria and Iraq was diminished by one third. The Black
Death was followed by a series of plagues which continued into the
nineteenth century. It was estimated that between 1363 and 1515 alone,
six­teen epidemics occurred in Egypt and fifteen in Syria.

These recurring famines and plagues were instrumental in diminishing
agricultural production. Death wiped out a large proportion of peasants and
domestic animals. Industry collapsed with the deaths of great numbers of
skilled workers. This also had adverse effects on the administration and the
government. The Mamelukes no longer had sufficient resources to maintain
their military organization. This led to instability, corruption and
oppression which helped further to accelerate the economic decay.

The Geographical Location and the Geography of the Region

The geographical factor made Iraq, Syria and Egypt the targets of continuous
external attacks, aggression or intervention from the First Crusade in AD
1006 until modern times. Geographical location gave a prime strategic asset
to some countries such as Japan and the British Isles, since their insular
location offered protection from overland invasion. The geography of Europe
and its location in the west protected it also from similar invasions.
Europe's landscape was much more fractured, with mountain ranges and large
forests separating the scattered population centres in the valleys, and its
climate varied considerably. This had minimized the possibility that the
continent could be overrun by an external force like the Mongol hordes.[18]
In contrast, Iraq, Syria and Egypt were central between East and West and
their flat geography made them vulnerable to external invasions from both
sides.

The Crusades

Between 1096 and their final defeat in 1291 no fewer than seven Crusades
were mounted against the Arab lands; one Crusade was mounted against
Constantinople. The first three (1096, 1147, 1189) focused on Syria,
including Palestine. The Fourth Crusade (1204) pillaged Constantinople,
while the Fifth, Sixth and Seventh Crusades (1218, 1244, 1250) were directed
against Egypt. The last one (1270) was directed against Tunisia.

Palestine, especially Jerusalem, was considered holy for the three
re­ligions of Judaism, Christianity and Islam. The declared object of the
Crusades was to occupy the Holy Land, especially Jerusalem, and to replace
the native Muslim population by a Latin one. During the conquest, the Muslim
popu­lation of the captured Syrian towns was annihilated by mass slaughter,
and was replaced by the members of the invading armies and those who
accompanied them, such as adventurers, merchants and pilgrims.

There were also other motives behind these wars. Around AD 1000, the
population of Europe was growing, whereas that of the Islamic world was on
the decline. The population of Europe was estimated at 38.5 million while
that of the Islamic lands did not exceed 12.5. Some historians are of the
opinion that `the Crusades were essentially an early experiment in
expansionist im­perialism, motivated by material considerations with
religion as a psychological catalyst.' [19]

The period of the Crusades was one of growth on all fronts in Western
Europe. There was a growth in population and in production. The growth in
profits led to the accumulation of capital and this stimulated all who
engaged in trade, notably the members of the Italian commercial and banking
houses.[20] The Crusades offered huge opportunities for the expansion of the
great maritime cities of northern Italy - Venice, Pisa and Genoa. The
conquest, and the concessions given to these cities, allowed the
establishment of Italian co­lonies in the towns of the Syrian coast.[21]
These colonies flourished under the Crusaders' rule, and they survived under
the Muslim re-conquest and devel­oped a considerable trade both for export
and import. They were instrumental in the transfer of the manufacturing
technologies of some Near Eastern in­dustries and the establishment of these
industries in Italy. There came a time when the process was reversed and the
Italian products of these industries started to be exported to the Near
East. This was probably the chief perma­nent effect of the Crusades in the
Near East.[22]

The efforts to confront and oust the Crusaders, which lasted for two
centuries, sapped the local economies and weakened the Arab urban centres.
This enormous task required formidable military strength which could not be
provided by Syria alone, with its limited human and economic resources. It
was only through the unity of Syria and Egypt under the Ayyubids and the,
Mamelukes, and through the military system that was adopted, that the
Crusaders were finally defeated and expelled.

The Mongols

In the middle of the thirteenth century, and while the core Islamic lands
were still busy with the expulsion of the Crusaders, another terrible
invasion came from the East. Genghis Khan united the nomadic tribes of
Mongolia and launched a devastating assault against the Eastern Islamic
lands. By 1220­/1221 Samarkand, Bukhara and Khwarizm fell into their hands
and were cruelly devastated. In 1221, they crossed the Oxus River and
entered Persia. Genghis Khan died in 1227. In the middle of the century, a
new plan to conquer all the lands of Islam as far as Egypt was entrusted to
Hulagu, who marched with an army numbering 200,000 men according some Arabic
sources. [23] In February 1258 Baghdad fell into their hands. The Abbasid
caliph al-Musta`sim was killed and the caliphate was abolished. This marked
the end of a remarkable era in Islamic civilization.

The most disastrous effect of the Mongol invasion was depopulation. The
capture of Baghdad and several towns was followed by horrible mas­sacres.
The number of inhabitants who were slaughtered in Baghdad after its conquest
according to Arabic sources ranged between 800,000 and 2 million; non-Arabic
sources give lower figures, but it probably exceeded 100,000. [24] There
were massacres in every other city. It is beyond doubt that the conquest of
Iraq by the Mongols was a demographic catastrophe. Many towns remained
desolate, and there was carnage in the countryside too. According to Rashid
al-Din, most of the towns on both sides of the Euphrates were devastated and
destroyed.[25]

Under the Ilkhanids, there was a general and progressive decline of Iraq's
population [26] The decrease of the population of Iraq and the consequences
of the Mongol conquest were so catastrophic that Hamd Allah al-Qazwini
ob­served that `there can be no doubt that even if for 1,000 years to come
no evil befall the country, yet it will not be possible completely to repair
the damage and bring back the land to the state in which it was
formerly.[27] Modern research has revealed that the population of the
province of Diyala, including Baghdad, had declined from 870,000 in AD 800
to 60,000 after 1258.

Immediately after the fall of Baghdad, the Mongols continued their march and
overtook Syria and according to their plan, they were heading towards Egypt
which was threatened also with annihilation and destruction. The Mamelukes
realized the immensity of this danger, and they stood up to the challenge.
In the battle of `Ayn Jalut in Palestine, in 1259, the Mongols were defeated
decisively, and their tide was checked. The Mamelukes gradually wrested all
of Syria from Hulagu and his successors. The last encounter in this era
between the Mongols and the Mamelukes took place in 1304 when Ghazan,

who was already converted to Islam, was defeated. The final expulsion of
both the Crusaders and the Mongols from Syria was achieved at the same time.

Timur (Tamerlane, ruled 1370-1405) followed in the footsteps of Genghis Khan
in ruthlessness, and in conducting worldwide conquests. Although he was a
Muslim and claimed that his campaigns were made in the name of Islam, yet
they inflicted all the horrors of barbarian devastation on the Islamic
world. In 1400-1401 he invaded Iraq and Syria and sacked and pil­laged
Baghdad, Aleppo and Damascus. His spoils from Damascus included the learned
men and the artisans whom he took back with him to his capital in Central
Asia. This was a further blow to the civilization of the region.

The Loss of International Trade

The economy of the core Islamic lands during the Golden Age of Islam was a
commercial and a monetary one which could quite easily have continued to
match that of Europe had it not been beset by various adverse factors. A
main element in the prosperity of the Islamic economy was international
trade. The strategic location of the Islamic lands between East and West and
their military strength enabled them to be the masters of international
trade until the end of the fifteenth century.

It is not a mere coincidence that the year 1492 witnessed the fall of
Granada, and the expedition of Columbus in an effort to find a route to
India which could bypass the Islamic lands where Ottoman power was on the
rise. Thus Columbus discovered the New World and Spain established its
authority on the greater part of the newly discovered continent. In this
same period, the Portuguese were seeking also to bypass the Islamic lands to
reach the East and bring its riches directly to Lisbon. The Portuguese
discovered the route around Africa. There was virtually no Islamic naval
power in the Indian Ocean, and they were able to occupy all the important
Islamic trading posts in the East and to establish their colonies.

The Portuguese' presence in the East enabled them to establish direct trade
with Europe, and to levy taxes on Muslim merchants and Muslim ships, but the
supply of the Islamic lands with Eastern goods remained in Muslim hands.

The situation changed at the end of the sixteenth century with the rise of
Holland, England and France as the dominant forces in world trade. These
countries enjoyed uninterrupted political stability and economic,
technological and scientific progress. Each of them established a worldwide
commercial empire based on advanced gunnery and sailing techniques, in
addition to utter ruthlessness in the pursuit of profits.

The discovery of the New World and the new routes to the East brought untold
riches to Europe, which prospered on the captured gold, silver, spices and
other products. The distribution of wealth between Europe and the Islamic
lands had changed dramatically, and the centre of international trade had
shifted from the Mediterranean and the Indian Ocean to the Baltic and the
Atlantic.

The rise of the commercial empires created a system of exploitation in which
Europe became the supplier of high-value manufactured products and the
colonized or dominated countries, including the Islamic lands, produced raw
materials.[28]

The Capitulations

The core Islamic lands did not encounter a frontal military assault from the
West similar to that of the Crusades until the nineteenth century. But
during the intervening period, they were penetrated and invaded economically
in an indirect and a more insidious and damaging manner. Even when the
Muslims were victorious following the expulsion of the Crusaders, the
Italian maritime cities which established their presence during the
Crusaders occupation of the Syrian coast continued their presence and
activities in Egypt and Syria under the Mamelukes, with damaging economic
effects for both Egypt and Syria. The Ottoman sultans adopted even more
harmful policies. Immediately after the capture of Constantinople in 1453,
the Genoese in that city were given trading privileges. These privileges and
immunities, which were given to foreign non-Muslim trading communities
living in Muslim cities, came to be known as the Capitulations. The word
means submission, surrender and subordination, which is contrary to
sovereignty and independence. The Ottoman sultans thought that these
concessions to foreigners would benefit the empire's economy. In 1535, the
French secured commercial concessions in the empire, in addition to other
important privileges. The English Levant Company acquired comparable
privileges in 1580.[29]  In Persia, Shah Abbas I, who was a powerful ruler,
acted in a similar manner. He granted the English East India Company similar
commercial concessions. These concessions granted by Muslim rulers gave
Europeans the opportunity to gain control over a large share of the economic
life of Islam.

With the declining power of the Ottoman Empire, the Capitulations were
confirmed and extended to give foreign powers non-commercial concessions as
well, such as the right of foreigners to have their own consular courts, and
the right to guard Christian holy places. In the Levant, France was granted
the right to protect all native Latin Catholics. Russia and Britain claimed
similar protective rights over other sectors of the native population.

The nineteenth century witnessed the rise of European imperialism led by
Britain. Although British goods were invading the Ottoman Empire, yet
Britain exerted powerful pressure on the Ottoman Empire and forced it to
abolish the system of state monopolies. In 1838, an Anglo-Turkish treaty was
signed giving Britain and the European powers the right to trade in the
empire in return for a duty of 3 per cent only.[30] This treaty, known as
the Commercial Code, deprived the Ottoman government of its revenue from
state mono­polies. It opened the door for the foreign economic domination of
the empire. Cheaper European goods invaded the markets, and the local
industries were virtually destroyed. The Ottoman economy declined into that
of a satellite in its relationship with Europe, supplying it with raw
materials which were Manufactured in Europe and then sold back in the
empire.[31]

Western Military Intervention to Thwart Modernization [32]

In the nineteenth century, some Muslim rulers realized the weakness of their
economies and became aware of the urgent need to introduce reforms and to
modernize. These attempts took place in the Ottoman Empire, in Egypt, and in
Tunisia, and all of them were thwarted by direct or indirect intervention by
European powers.

The story of Mohammad Ali is an example of direct military intervention by
Western powers to foil the attempt to modernize by a Muslim ruler. Mohammad
Ali, who was described by Brockelmann [33] as the most im­portant man in the
history of modern Islam, came to power in Egypt in 1805. He realized from
the start wherein lay the power of Western Europe. So he spent his lifetime
in an attempt to modernize and to build the economy of Egypt. He realized
that military strength does not lie in the number of men in the armed forces
or the amount of amassed imported military equipment, but in the possession
and control of the means of production and not being de­pendent on Europe.
So he undertook a massive programme of modernization and industrialization.

He started by abolishing the Mameluke military system and establishing a
modern army of about 180,000, in which the sons of the Egyptian peasants
were recruited. He introduced a land reform in which he abolished the iqtá
system and consolidated the agricultural lands as state property, and
allotted them to the peasants. He encouraged agriculture and introduced the
cultiva­tion of cotton into Egypt as an export crop for securing the foreign
exchange which was much needed for his reforms. He made foreign trade a
state monopoly and refused to apply the Commercial Code which was imposed by
Western powers on the Ottoman Empire, because he believed that it would
destroy the economy of Egypt.

Mohammad Ali built many industrial factories to produce a wide range of
products which were needed for the country as a whole and for the army and
the navy. These included textiles, clothing, paper, dyes, sugar, chemicals,
leather, glass, machine tools, pumps, guns and am­munition, and many other
products. He even built naval vessels in Alexandria. The number of
industrial workers reached about 400,000. He sent workers to Europe to be
trained in European factories and hired foreign technicians for some
industries. Missions of Egyptian students were sent annually to Europe to
study and specialize. Many modern schools were built for the first time in
Egypt, such as the schools for medicine, veterinary medicine, engineering,
languages, secretarial services, infantry and artillery. At one time, the
number of students in these schools reached 10,000, all of whom were
supplied with lodging, food and stipends. The aim was to create the cadres
needed to run and supervise a modern government and a modern economy, and to
provide the army with the needed trained manpower.

Muhammad Ali created a united Arab state which included Egypt, Greater
Syria, Hijaz and the Sudan all of which were neighbours. Syria in particular
was of immense importance as was evident to him from the history of Egypt
and Syria during the previous Islamic periods.

The major Western powers became increasingly concerned and alarmed by the
threat that this rising Islamic power posed to their interests. Britain in
particular regarded Muhammad Ali as a dangerous menace to its interests.
Palmerston in an official correspondence to his ambassador in France wrote:
`I hate Muhammad Ali whom I consider him nothing better than a barbarian. I
believe that he is a great tyrant and oppressor.'  Britain was seriously
alarmed by the spread of Muhammad Ali's power along the whole eastern coast
of the Red Sea and along a part of the southern coast of Arabia in which
they saw a threat to their route to India and the East. All the major powers
saw in his economic policies and his expanding power a threat to their
interests and to their markets in the Islamic lands.

Britain set about organizing the five major powers of Europe, Britain,
France, Prussia, Austria and Russia, to join an alliance to oust Muhammad
Ali from Syria and to curtail his power. Even though these powers had
conflicting interests, yet in this case they agreed to unite against
Muhammad Ali. In 1840, the fleets of the allies led by the British,
assembled off the Syrian coast to attack Ibrahim (his son). They instigated
a local revolt exploiting the religious differ­ences among the population,
and then landed in Beirut. Ibrahim was obliged to retreat. Then Acre was
besieged, bombarded and captured. This was fol­lowed by the siege of
Alexandria. Muhammad Ali realized that he was beaten. His French allies
deserted him, and he could not fight the European powers alone.

Through the terms of the Treaty of London of 1841, Muhammad Ali was obliged
to leave Syria and Hijaz, and to reduce his forces to 18,000 only from
180,000 (or 250,000 according to some reports.) He had to acknowledge the
validity of the treaties concluded between the Ottoman Empire and the
foreign powers, including the Commercial Code.[34]

The Rise and Decline of the Ottoman Empire

Coping with Overextension, Sustained Crusade and the Cultural Barrier

When the Ottomans were on the rise, they were always keen to encourage
economic activities in the new areas which were added to their empire. In
the new cities, all the trades and crafts were established as an important
support for the military effort.[35] During the sixteenth century, the
Ottomans were the superior military power. Their artillery and armaments
were unchallenged.[36] The Ottoman and Islamic civilization in general
developed unaided until it reached the point where it could not develop any
longer without a great new advance or a revolution in science and
technology. The Ottomans were a great power as long as their gunpowder
technology was superior. Gunpowder technology was developed by the Islamic
civilization from the thirteenth century until the end of the sixteenth,
Nothing of significance in this technology was borrowed from the West. We
can even safely say that, in general, Islamic technology in the sixteenth
century represented the best that was known in that age. This is illustrated
in the mechanical engineering books of Taqì al- Din, who flourished at the
end of the sixteenth century in Istanbul, and who established also the
advanced Istanbul observatory which was the last one in Islam. In that same
age, an English traveller in Syria was studying why people in England were
under the impression that the Turks were superior to people in the West.[37]

How can we explain then the decline which followed, and why the West
overtook and then surpassed the Ottomans after the sixteenth century? We
have given above various factors which led to the decline of the Islamic
lands including the Ottoman Empire, notably the capitulations.

The Ottomans lost their advantage in military technology after the
six­teenth century, and their economy and their science and technology did
not advance beyond medieval standards. In Europe, things began to change
dra­matically. The sixteenth and seventeenth centuries saw the emergence of
a European economy on a large scale. The geographical discoveries brought to
Europe great riches from the New World and from the newly discovered trade
routes with India and the Far East. Other internal factors were behind the
economic progress of local trade and industry. The fertility of the land in
Europe and the growth of population were among the factors behind this
economic growth.

By about the middle of the nineteenth century, the population of the Ottoman
Empire was barely 17 million.[38] This included more than 5 million in the
European part which was more of a liability, 6 million in Anatolia and
Istanbul, 2-3 million in Egypt, about 1 million in each of Syria and Iraq,
and 2-3 million in North Africa. The population of Western Europe in this
same period was about 190 million which is more than 11 times the population
of the Ottoman Empire.[39] And with Russia and Eastern Europe the total was
274 million or more than 16 times the size of the Ottoman Empire. Each of
the following West European countries was larger than the Ottoman Empire in
population: Great Britain (28.9 million), France (36.5), Spain and Portugal
(19.7), Italy (23.9), Germany (31.7), and Austro-Hungary (31.3).

In face of this growing prosperity and power of Europe, the Ottoman Empire
was to falter, and to turn inward. The Ottoman army, however well
administered, became increasingly unable to maintain the lengthy frontiers
without enormous cost in men and money; and the Ottoman Empire, unlike that
of the Spanish, Dutch, and the British later, did not bring much in the way
of economic benefit. By the second half of the sixteenth century, the empire
was showing signs of strategic over-extension,[40] with a large army
stationed in central Europe, an expensive navy operation in the
Mediterranean, troops engaged against Persia, in North Africa, the Aegean,
Cyprus, and the Red Sea, and reinforcements needed to hold the Crimea
against a rising Russian power.

An important element in the decline was the cultural barrier which ex­isted
between Christian Europe and the Ottomans and which isolated the empire from
the revolutions which took place in science and technology. This resulted
also in a hostile relationship with Europe, which was considered as a
continuation of the Crusades and which sapped the energy of the empire.

The gap between the levels of development continued to increase, and when
the Ottomans realized in the nineteenth century the need to modernize, it
was not as much the forces of reaction which delayed the reforms, but the
obstacles which were created by the Western powers.

The Future of Islamic Science

After the Second World War, most Islamic lands became independent once
again, but the scars of long colonial rule remained. These are evident in
the further fragmentation of Islamic and Arabic countries into smaller
states, in the injustice and oppression inflicted against the Palestinians,
in the destructive invasion of Iraq, in the renewed activities to strengthen
the cultural barrier between the West and Islam and to distort the image of
Islam, in the current sectarian and ethnic feuds and devastating civil wars
within some countries. in the economic and political dominance of foreign
powers, and in the cultural domination exemplified in the use of foreign
rather than national languages in higher education.

But despite all the adversities and obstacles facing the Islamic lands, the
future holds hope and promise. These lands have been the cradle of some of
the richest civilizations ever known. Science appeared in the Nile Valley,
Syria and Mesopotamia. It continued uninterrupted over thousands of years,
reaching its peak during the Islamic period. It flowed on incessantly, and
the wide gap of today started only since the Industrial Revolution, less
than 200 years ago. Thus there is a solid substratum to the civilization of
the Muslim world, which has indigenous and inherent cultural traditions and
customs, deeply rooted in the peoples of the area. In addition, there are
the crafts and industrial skills inherited over thousands of years. These
inherited skills proved their importance in the wake of independence and
after the Second World War, when some Islamic countries started to
industrialize and thousands of work­shops and industrial plants were
established in all Muslim cities. Craftsmen in even the smallest machine
shops were able to manufacture the most delicate modern machinery, in no way
inferior to imported or imitated versions.

In approaching modern science and technology, we must remind our­selves of
those lessons of history that help us to look to the future. For history
shows that there is nothing in the content of any part of science, or indeed
of technologies high or low, that cannot be nurtured and developed by any
people of any type of culture. Almost no society or set of cultural
conditions is hostile: on the contrary, almost all the great groups of
mankind have throughout the ages made significant contributions to the
common heritage of knowledge and techniques. Among the foremost of them are
the peoples of Islam.

Once we realize that the content of science and technology finds no cultural
barriers, we arrive at another lesson of history. It has been established
that in the past, as now, science and scientists flourish in large
communities and linguistic groups rather than small, in affluent areas
better than in poor. During historic times, science has indeed flourished
only when an empire or a nation became mighty and rich, because it depends
on the infrastructure provided by the existence of affluence. This is amply
demonstrated through­out Islamic history.

The Islamic world is rich in human resources, and some areas are rich in
petroleum and other natural resources. This is fortunate because the future
of science in Islamic countries depends upon the successful utilization of a
combination of these two ingredients. Development in all fields within a
community depends significantly on the scientific size, which is itself
propor­tional to the size of the population and the gross national product.

Individually, most of the oil-rich countries are small in size. Each cannot
by itself create an effective science and technology, or an independent
in­dustrial economy. Similarly, those Muslim countries which are endowed
with human resources lack the capital essential for the development of
science and technology and, indeed, for their general development.

Though most individual Islamic states now realize the importance of science
and technology for their future development, and though some have achieved
considerable success along this road, future progress in all Muslim
countries, rich or poor, depends on the extent of economic co-operation and
integration among them on a regional basis.
