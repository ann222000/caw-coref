____________________________________________________

Bacon was an expert on seamanship who made detailed
observations from the deck on the effects of wind on the sails
of ships under various conditions and made recommendations
for maximizing the efficiency and safety of navigation.

Bacon printed a lengthy technical analysis (in 35 parts) of these
'experimental' (as opposed to theoretical) observations in
Motus Ventorum in velis navium or The Motion of Winds in the
Sails of Ships, the second part of his scientific treatise Historia
Ventorum or History of the Winds (1622).

URL: &lt;&gt;

Bacon wrote his scientific treatises in Latin and his translators wrote

their translations of his scientific treatises in Victorian English but
it is
nevertheless apparent that there is a relationship between part 33
of the Historia Ventorum and the scene in Act 1 of The Tempest in
which the seamen attempt to keep the ship from running aground in
the storm.

In heavy storms, they first lower the yards and take in the top
sails
and if necessary, all the others, even cutting down the masts
themselves.

The Motus Ventorum goes on like this for probably
a dozen pages but it and lines from the first part of the Historia
Ventorum that are found paraphrased in The Tempest qualify
Bacon for authorship of the play.
That and the Strachey report.

Cordially,

Well, I'm convinced: only Bacon could possibly have known that taking in the
topsail was the appropriate response to a storm at sea (that's why
shipwrecks were so frequent).

As Iago almost said: it speaks against him (WS), with the other proofs.

You've contradicted yourself, Groves. If shipwrecks were
so frequent because the topsails were taken in during
heavy storms then it must have been a general practice.

And what about the Boson who says 'yare, yare, take down the
topsail?'

And when are we going to see something more than the

&lt;&lt;Sir Edward Stanley (1562-1632) had a famous daughter, Venetia (born
1600), a great beauty and a bit of a tart, who finally married, in 1625,
Sir Kenelm Digby. Digby and she had been childhood playmates. Digby, a
friend of &quot;Sandy&quot; Napier - Dr Richard Napier of Lynford, who was given
to invoking favourable spirits by the practice of angel magic on a daily
basis - was a Rosicrucian, who managed to oscillate between
Protestantism and Catholicism with disconcerting frequency. His
Rosicrucian jewel was exhibited on occasion at meetings of the Societas
Rosicruciana in Anglia in the early years of this century. His close
friends included John Selden, Ben Jonson and, if we are to go by various
references in letters addressed to Father Mersenne, James Martin, the
eccentric eulogist of Robert Fludd. Venetia died unexpectedly in 1633.
Sir Anthony Vandyck painted a most moving death-bed portrait of her,
which now hangs in the Dulwich Gallery.
On her pillow lie faded rose PeTaLS. &gt;&gt;
------------------------------------------------------------------
ZUZU's PeTaLS
------------------------------------------------------------------
HYACINTH according to Grecian fable, was the son of Amyclas, a Spartan
king. The lad was beloved by Apollo and Zephyr, and as he preferred the
sun-god, Zephyr drove Apollo's quoit at his head, and killed him. The
blood became a flower, and the PeTaLS are inscribed with the boy's name.
(Virgil: Eclogues, iii. 106.)

Camoens: Lusiad, ix. &quot;The hyacinth bewrays the doleful `A I,
And culls the tribute of Apollo's sigh.
Still on its bloom the mournful flower retains
The lovely blue that dyed the STriPLing's veins.'

_MOBY DICK_ by Herman Melville
CHAPTER 71 The JEROBOAM's Story

But this did by no means prevent all communications. Preserving an
interval of some few yards between itself and the ship, the Jeroboam's boat
by the occasional use of its oars contrived to keep parallel to the Pequod,
as she heavily forged through the sea (for by this time it blew VERy fresh),
with her main-ToPSaiL aback; though, indeed, at times by the sudden onset of
a large rolling wave, the boat would be pushed some way ahead; but would
be soon skilfully brought to her proper bearings again. Subject to this, and
other the like interruptions now and then, a conversation was sustained
between the two parties; but at intervals not without still another
interruption of a VERy different sort.

The TemPeST Act 4, Scene 1

PROSPERO And, like the baseless fabric of this vision,
The cloud-capp'd towers, the gorgeous palaces,

[P]ost [L]ucem [S]pero [T]enebras
-------------------------------------------------------------
Thomas Shelton and Hamet Benengeli
by Francis Carr

THE FIRST EDITION OF &quot;DON QUIXOTE.&quot; 1605

&lt;&lt;We see a hooded falcon resting on the gloved hand of a man hidden
from view. Swirling shapes, possibly mist, on one side only, stress
the fact that the falconer is hidden, just out of sight. Around the
arm and the bird is the inscription:

[P]ost [L]ucem [S]pero [T]enebras
after darkness I HOPE for light.

Beneath the falcon a lion is keeping his eye on the bird.
It could be said that both the lion and the falcon HOPE for light
after the darkness, for the clear light of day after the dark
night, or a time of impaired vision. The lion could symbolise
England; the falcon could be Cervantes. Who is the falconer?

The inscription takes us to Chapter 68 of the Second Part
of Don Quixote, in which the knight tells Sancho Panza
that he too HOPEs for light:

O hard heart! oh ungodly Squire! oh ill given bread, and favours ill
placed which I bestowed, and thought to have more and more
conferred upon thee . . . for I [P]ost [L]ucem [S]pero [T]enebras
. I understand not that, said Sancho, only I know that
whitest I am sleeping, I neither feare nor HOPE,
have neither paine nor pleasure.

In Cervantes' text, Quixote follows the words in Latin with a
translation into the vernacular: &quot;after darkness I expect light&quot;.
Sancho, howEVER, still says &quot;I don't understand that&quot;.

Shelton's version makes sense. It seems that Cervantes' explanation has
been added to help the reader, but it is a mistake, as it makes Sancho's
reply incomprehensible. Was Cervantes' text a translation of Shelton?&gt;&gt;
------------------------------------------------------
Macbeth Act 1, Scene 7

LADY MACBETH Was the HOPE drunk
Wherein you dress'd yourself? hath it SLePT since?
And wakes it now, to look so GREEN and pale
At what it did so freely?
----------------------------------------------------------------
Twelfth Night Act 1, Scene 2

Captain: TRUE, madam: and, to comfort you with chance,
Assure yourself, after our ship did SPLiT,
When you and those poor number saved with you
Hung on our driving boat, I saw your brother,
Most provident in peril, bind himself,
Courage and HOPE both teaching him the practise,
To a strong mast that lived upon the sea;
Where, like Arion on the DOLPHIN's back,
I saw him hold acquaintance with the waves
So long as I could see.

How are ironies 'rare' if you've lined up three in a row? You are not
'convinced,' Bacon wasn't the 'only one,' but what threw me off was
'basic seacraft'--Orgel and Falconer seem to think that cutting down
the topsail is not 'basic' but 'expert' when the ship is running
aground--it is an attempt to 'turn the ship leeward.' How many corn
traders would know that, Groves?

I can visualize cutting down the topsail because seamen, ropes and
tackles cannot turn a topsail 60 feet long at the base (Bacon) if it's
being blasted by the force of a 60 mph wind. Imagine that force
hitting thousands of square feet of canvas as the beach comes straight
at you.
No wonder they just took a saw to the masts. As Bacon says, with the
topsail down, the ship would at least have a chance to go with the
current (which is better than capsizing)

Taking in the topsail in a storm is an obviously sensible proceeding --
'basic seacraft'. Where does the boatsawin say anything about cutting it
down? When he says &quot;Downe with the top-Mast: yare, lower, lower, bring her
to Try with Maine-course&quot; he's talking about lowering the main sail,
bringing it &quot;to try&quot;: if he wanted the mast chopped down he would need to be
a lot more explicit (something on the lines of &quot;Go get an axe and chop down
the top-mast -- yes, I know it sounds crazy, but just do it&quot;.

Ultimately the issue isn't that performing certain activities was basic or
advanced seamanship.

If Shakespeare wanted to write a (very short) scene that had realistic
dialog, he would have had no difficulty finding an experienced seaman in
London. &quot;Punch this up for me, will you? I'll give you an associate

Mark,

The problem is that Strats have made literally countless thousands of
these statements--all the actor would have had to do is ask someone or
read something--but of the countless Strat scholars and critics not
one has ever found a single piece of evidence that he did. It's all
pure speculation--in the rhetorical form of excuse-making--and that
works as long as you have the force majeur of a movement or have
control of lit departments world wide but the Oxfordians are organizing
a movement (that signals that Oxfordians don't have anything
either--people with evidence don't have to form movements to coerce
other people into believing their assertions) so sooner or later the
Oxfordians will be in a position to call the Strat bluff..

The record shows that the actor was busy hustling money in London and
in Stratford and if there is so much documentation about his really
sleazy pursuit of money and rank there ought to be one scrap of paper
with his handwriting on it showing that he did research to write the
incomparably erudite Shakespeare plays.

The Strat 'army of scholars' have overturned every British archive and
have never found anything because nothing is there. There is, however,
evidence that they destroyed, 'lost,' or suppressed Baconian
evidence..

Cordially,

Elizabeth

Elizabeth, last time I checked I was a writer, although some here might
argue otherwise, and I in most cases when I wanted to know something
about an obscure topic - bookbinding, say, or klezmer music, or the
layout of St. Paul, MN, in the 1890's - I failed to leave a paper
trail. I dare say that my fellow (and better) writers on hlas have had
like experiences.

It's all

&quot;The situation is this: The good frigate Ariel snapped her hawser in a
violent storm where she lay at anchor in the middle of a smallbay, and
would certainly be smashed into the docks unless quick action was
taken.

--The Captain joined Mister Cloud and Skivvy on the poop deck, measured
with his eye the course the mate was running, and yelled out, &quot;It's
a narrow way, Mister Cloud!&quot;

&quot;Aye, Captain. Ready to wear ship when you give the order.&quot;
&quot;The ship's yours, Mister Cloud.&quot;

Mister Cloud nodded and put a hand on Skivvy's shoulder. The next
maneuver called for fine judgement. Now they must bring the ship
around through the bottom of the bay. They must come very close to the
docks of New Liberty. The mate threw his eyes back and forth toward
the lights of shore. And then the moment came.

&quot;Ready to wear ship!&quot; the mate called to the crew, and then,
giving them a few moments to set themselves, he called out the order.
&quot;Wear ship! Helm alee, Skivvy!&quot;

Skivvy spun the wheel. The head sheets were let go, the jibs were
passed, the trysail was hauled aweather, and the Ariel was sideways to
the wind, the sails luffing. The ship seemingly must come to wreck on
the lee shore, and the mate yelled out again.

&quot;Mainsail haul!&quot;

The main yards were braced around, the jibs hauled over and sheeted
home, and the Ariel put her head toward the docks of New Liberty,
leaning hard on her starboard boards. She was pulling hard,paying off
on the port tack, the mainsails billowed out taut. The crew trimmed
sails and watched the docks of New Liberty reach out like the dark
fingers of a hand to clutch and crush them. It was going to be very
close. The sails bloomed, and Skivvy put the wheel down hard.....&quot;

Amy's Eyes p 173-74

This is at the point of the question underway, of imitating a trade or
skill he hasn't. Could a writer can speak nautically of sailing ships
without having sailed and worked such a ship. When I wrote the above
lines, I had been a deckhand on an ocean going ship, and been a
&quot;puller&quot; on a 50 foot drag boat out of Yaquina bay here at Newport,
but I'd not had any experience with sailing ships. I got in touch
with a friend who was still sailing the world in a four-master, a
yard-climbing deep sea sailor, and he told me the above on the
telephone after I recited the problem to him. I think I got it right,
and in any case the Ariel rounded through the bottom of the bay,
&quot;running free and safely toward the bottleneck of the bay and the
open sea.&quot;

And so the joke about learning about such matters over a few pints of
ale is not entirely a joke.

There are two kinds of evidence required to establish the facts; a
document in the author's hand and/or a credible witness with direct
knowledge.

Whether or not you accept Price's thesis, her raw data, at least, shows
that all the other Elizabethan playwrights and poets except
Marlowe--who was probably the actor's predecessor--left substantial
paper trails and witnesses.

The actor, who allegedly wrote 50,000 lines crammed with the most
erudite biblical, classical and Renaissance allusions, enough to keep
tens of thousands of Shakspeare critics busy for two hundred
years--there are over four milion articles on the Shakespeare works
including ninety thousand graduate theses on Hamlet alone--left nothing
but Strat biographers
willing to make endless excuses like 'he got it from sailors down at
the dock' or 'he certainly got it from a visiting Italian acting
company.'

Richard,

The question isn't 'who might have known' but 'who has evidence that
they did know.'

An authorship dispute requires evidence. You have proved that you got
your expertise in the same way that Bacon or the actor might have
gotten it, but the actor left no evidence on that or any other subject
of the thousands of subjects alluded to in the Shakespeare works.

Bacon left many pages of detailed observations and even statistics on
sails which allow us to visualize the shape of the sails he describes
in History of the Winds, not to speak of the topsail item that shares
some of the wording of the Boson's speech in The Tempest.

That alone wouldn't resolve the authorship question but with Bacon's
direct evidence and other circumstantial evidence it's more than what
the actor has and that is countless libraries of excuses invented by
Strat biographers whose idea of evidence descends from the romantic
novels of the 18th century, not science or law.

&gt; Mister Cloud nodded and put a hand on Skivvy's shoulder. The next

&gt;&quot;Wear ship! Helm alee, Skivvy!&quot;

&gt; This is at the point of the question underway, of imitating a trade or
&gt; skill he hasn't. Could a writer can speak nautically of sailing ships
&gt; without having sailed and worked such a ship. When I wrote the above
&gt; lines, I had been a deckhand on an ocean going ship, and been a
&gt;&quot;puller&quot; on a 50 foot drag boat out of Yaquina bay here at Newport,
&gt; but I'd not had any experience with sailing ships. I got in touch
&gt; with a friend who was still sailing the world in a four-master, a
&gt; yard-climbing deep sea sailor, and he told me the above on the
&gt; telephone after I recited the problem to him. I think I got it right,
&gt; and in any case the Ariel rounded through the bottom of the bay,
&gt;&quot;running free and safely toward the bottleneck of the bay and the
&gt; open sea.&quot;

&gt; And so the joke about learning about such matters over a few pints of
&gt; ale is not entirely a joke.

Groves,

I didn't think the mast was cut, I thought the seamen climbed up and
cut the ropes to the sails and let the sail drop--what are they going
to do? wind the sail around the beam in high winds?

My sense is that if there was not time to cut all the sails the crew
started sawing the masts to bring it all down. Maybe it's impossible
to climb the masts in some storms.

Here's some photos of the rigging of the reconstructed Godspeed.

&lt;&gt;

The original Godspeed took the First Charter (doomed) colonists to
Virginia in 1606 (not the Second or Third Charter colonists). These
are the sails Bacon
wrote about because I thought--how could a 17th c. ship be that wide?
he describes a topsail whose bottom beam is 60 feet wide and top beam
is 25 feet wide--the bigger sails had wider beams. I now see that the
beams were wider than the ship. I would think you'd really have to
know what you were doing to sail a 17th c. ship.
Cordially,

Elizabeth

&lt;&lt;Sir Edward Stanley (1562-1632) had a famous daughter, Venetia (born
1600), a great beauty and a bit of a tart, who finally married, in 1625,
Sir Kenelm Digby. Digby and she had been childhood playmates. Digby, a
friend of &quot;Sandy&quot; Napier - Dr Richard Napier of Lynford, who was given
to invoking favourable spirits by the practice of angel magic on a daily
basis - was a Rosicrucian, who managed to oscillate between
Protestantism and Catholicism with disconcerting frequency. His
Rosicrucian jewel was exhibited on occasion at meetings of the Societas
Rosicruciana in Anglia in the early years of this century. His close
friends included John Selden, Ben Jonson and, if we are to go by various
references in letters addressed to Father Mersenne, James Martin, the
eccentric eulogist of Robert Fludd. Venetia died unexpectedly in 1633.
Sir Anthony Vandyck painted a most moving death-bed portrait of her,
which now hangs in the Dulwich Gallery.
On her pillow lie faded rose PeTaLS. &gt;&gt;

HYACINTH according to Grecian fable, was the son of Amyclas, a Spartan
king. The lad was beloved by Apollo and Zephyr, and as he preferred the
sun-god, Zephyr drove Apollo's quoit at his head, and killed him. The
blood became a flower, and the PeTaLS are inscribed with the boy's name.
(Virgil: Eclogues, iii. 106.)

Camoens: Lusiad, ix. &quot;The hyacinth bewrays the doleful `A I,
And culls the tribute of Apollo's sigh.
Still on its bloom the mournful flower retains
The lovely blue that dyed the STriPLing's veins.'

CHAPTER 71 The JEROBOAM's Story

But this did by no means prevent all communications. Preserving an
interval of some few yards between itself and the ship, the Jeroboam's boat
by the occasional use of its oars contrived to keep parallel to the Pequod,
as she heavily forged through the sea (for by this time it blew VERy fresh),
with her main-ToPSaiL aback; though, indeed, at times by the sudden onset of
a large rolling wave, the boat would be pushed some way ahead; but would
be soon skilfully brought to her proper bearings again. Subject to this, and
other the like interruptions now and then, a conversation was sustained
between the two parties; but at intervals not without still another
interruption of a VERy different sort.

[P]ost [L]ucem [S]pero [T]enebras
-------------------------------------------------------------
Thomas Shelton and Hamet Benengeli
by Francis Carr

THE FIRST EDITION OF &quot;DON QUIXOTE.&quot; 1605

&lt;&lt;We see a hooded falcon resting on the gloved hand of a man hidden
from view. Swirling shapes, possibly mist, on one side only, stress
the fact that the falconer is hidden, just out of sight. Around the
arm and the bird is the inscription:

[P]ost [L]ucem [S]pero [T]enebras
after darkness I HOPE for light.

Beneath the falcon a lion is keeping his eye on the bird.
It could be said that both the lion and the falcon HOPE for light
after the darkness, for the clear light of day after the dark
night, or a time of impaired vision. The lion could symbolise
England; the falcon could be Cervantes. Who is the falconer?

The inscription takes us to Chapter 68 of the Second Part
of Don Quixote, in which the knight tells Sancho Panza
that he too HOPEs for light:

O hard heart! oh ungodly Squire! oh ill given bread, and favours ill
placed which I bestowed, and thought to have more and more
conferred upon thee . . . for I [P]ost [L]ucem [S]pero [T]enebras
. I understand not that, said Sancho, only I know that
whitest I am sleeping, I neither feare nor HOPE,
have neither paine nor pleasure.

In Cervantes' text, Quixote follows the words in Latin with a
translation into the vernacular: &quot;after darkness I expect light&quot;.
Sancho, howEVER, still says &quot;I don't understand that&quot;.

Shelton's version makes sense. It seems that Cervantes' explanation has
been added to help the reader, but it is a mistake, as it makes Sancho's
reply incomprehensible. Was Cervantes' text a translation of Shelton?&gt;&gt;
------------------------------------------------------
Macbeth Act 1, Scene 7

LADY MACBETH Was the HOPE drunk
Wherein you dress'd yourself? hath it SLePT since?
And wakes it now, to look so GREEN and pale
At what it did so freely?

Twelfth Night Act 1, Scene 2

Captain: TRUE, madam: and, to comfort you with chance,
Assure yourself, after our ship did SPLiT,
When you and those poor number saved with you
Hung on our driving boat, I saw your brother,
Most provident in peril, bind himself,
Courage and HOPE both teaching him the practise,
To a strong mast that lived upon the sea;
Where, like Arion on the DOLPHIN's back,
I saw him hold acquaintance with the waves
So long as I could see.

A quotation from &quot;Politics and the English Language&quot;. A very
interesting essay. Orwell's comment, &quot;The writer either has a meaning
and cannot express it, or he inadvertently says something else, or he
is almost indifferent as to whether his words mean anything or not&quot;
reminds me of Twain's criticisms of Cooper: &quot;When a person has a poor
ear for music he will flat and sharp right along without knowing it. He
keeps near the tune, but is not the tune. When a person has a poor ear
for words, the result is a literary flatting and sharping; you perceive
what he is intending to say, but you also perceive that he does not say
it.&quot;

This is also possibly a first for HLAS. Has anyone ever posted an
Orwell &quot;quotation&quot; before that could actually be found in Orwell's

On a square rigged ship its the yards which are stayed, not the sails which
hang from them. Cutting ropes at deck level will likely unstay the yards or
the mast itself. The idea of reducing /top/ sails is that the barky doesn't
keel over too much, and can right itself after shipping tons of water,
otherwise the next wave could poop the ship.

Its necessary to maintain some sort of canvass up there, [otherwise to run
directly away from the wind, with hardly any steerage possible and scud
under bare poles] even if its only a scrap of cloth in order to maintain
steerage, otherwise the ship goes side-on to the weather, and that is
usually disaster.

One would cut away all the rigging about a fallen mast, but cutting through
a mainmast some two feet thick with hand tools might take awhile :) and is
possibly a more suicidal act than running with full sails - since the mast
is not replaceable, except by a jury [temporary] mast, and fitting a mast at
sea [if you have a spare] is the most strenuous activity known to maritime
experience.

All of that would be known in the age of sail to anyone who lived by the
sea, or even in moderately damp locations. Anyone engaged in commerce would
know it, as well as of course all fishermen, smugglers, and every man jack
in the navy, or even reasonably alert passengers nipping across the channel.

There is no location in England more than 70 miles from the sea.

The statement is made thousands of times because, as someone pointed out in
another thread recently, *no one* could have been an expert in the hundreds
of topics the author is said to have shown expert knowledge of. It's clear
to me that, whoever he was, he was a world-class absorber of useless
information (i.e., a writer). If anyone took Bacon seriously enough, you
would be fending off similar attacks.

Your Tempest example is particularly weak because the passage is only a
couple pages long, and as far as I can see, there are only four sentences of
actual &quot;seafarin' talk&quot;. He wouldn't have had to ask someone - he could
have overheard in a bar, and saved himself that associate producer credit.

Of course, there is relatively good evidence that the author, whoever he
was, did consult experts - written ones - without leaving a paper trail. If
he consulted written ones, why not human ones?

There is &quot;so much&quot; documentation of his business activities? Only
relatively. Believe me, the scholarly community would love to have a lot
more evidence about his business life - it's all scraps and hints.

Thanks, Neil and Richard, for your input.

&gt; one has ever found a single piece of evidence that he did. It's all
&gt; pure speculation--in the rhetorical form of excuse-making--and that
&gt; works as long as you have the force majeur of a movement or have

&gt; other people into believing their assertions) so sooner or later the
&gt; Oxfordians will be in a position to call the Strat bluff..

&gt; The record shows that the actor was busy hustling money in London and
&gt; in Stratford and if there is so much documentation about his really
&gt; sleazy pursuit of money and rank there ought to be one scrap of paper
&gt; with his handwriting on it showing that he did research to write the
&gt; incomparably erudite Shakespeare plays.

&gt; The Strat 'army of scholars' have overturned every British archive and

The proof against your claim is in locked up, uncatalogued, in
the basement of the Folger Shakespeare library.

When he was a thirteen year old at Cambridge, Bacon stated
that he would 'take all knowledge to be his province' and he,
like the author of the Shakespeare works, came very close to
his goal.

Bacon owned literally thousands of books--he would annotate
them and have the marginalia and underlinings trascribed
by his scribes into commonplace books.

Three thousand of Bacon's books and commonplace books
were collected by one of his English biographers. At the
biographer's death his estate sold the collection to Folger.
For the past eighty years Bacon's books have been kept,
uncatalogued and locked up, in the basement of the Folger
Library if they haven't been destroyed.

Two of Bacon's annotated books escaped the lockup and
are at the University of London. One of them has notes
for Macbeth in the margins. One commonplace book in
Bacon's own handwriting is at the British Museum.
It contains a hundred and twelve notes for Romeo &amp; Juliet
that are dated in the same months the play was written.

Those books are just a part of Bacon's system of organizing
'all knowledge.' A 16th c. letter survives that describes how
Bacon would go into the working class districts and observe
tradesmen at work and (unpatronizingly, as the writer states)
interview the tradesman about the methods and materials
of his or her craft. It's probably not a coincidence that computers
show that the practical handbooks written by Bacon's friend
Gervase Markham were oddly written by 'Shakespeare.'

Another of Bacon's books was found in a bookstall in London
ca 1930 whose marginalia in Bacon's handwriting provides
clues to the mystery of the Double AA headpieces on the
Shakespeare works.

There is also a mystery attached to the disappearance of Bacon's
papers. The post I just wrote on Bacon's 'History of the Winds'
which contains nearly a hundred 'items' in the form of close
observation
of the pressure of wind on sails, --these would be first hand
observations
--is one of a few treatises out of a huge collection of notes and
treatises
that disappeared before the 18th century.

We know this because one of Bacon's correspondents who had
many of Bacon's papers--he published the Historia Ventorum and
other treatises on the Continent--wrote to Bacon's executor
Dr. Rawley stating that he was anxious to see
the 'Verulamian workshop' where apparently these papers were
being processed as a part of some project. My guess is
the first encyclopedia, which Bacon promoted but did not live
long enough to personally oversee, a project that may have been
disrupted by the English Civil War.

In addition there are Bacon's acknowledged works on classical myth,
history, rhetoric, science, law, philosophy, gardening, architecture,
theology, dueling; all containing striking parallels to passages found
in the Shakespeare works.

So yes, someone did collect and collate the ocean of facts that
underly the Shakespeare works but so far, having exhausted the
lives of uncounted researchers, Strats have only come up with
oceans of empty excuses.

Your point, that Bacon was remarkably learned, is very well taken, and if
there were any reason to think he wrote the plays, at least no one would be
questioning his having the requisite knowledge or being able to acquire it.
As I understand it, that is the main reason there is a Baconian Heresy in
the first place. I overstated my case and I concede the issue. That'll
teach me to post without thinking about it for a few hours first.

I do think the Tempest example is silly, though. The &quot;expertise&quot; isn't
enough to fill a Jeopardy category. It exemplifies my other point - that
the claimed expertise always turns out to be neither broad nor deep.

As for your other claims, I hope you'll forgive me if I remain skeptical.
Can you provide references that will let me investigate them independently?

&gt; as someone pointed out in

&gt; The proof against your claim is in locked up, uncatalogued, in
&gt; the basement of the Folger Shakespeare library.

&gt; When he was a thirteen year old at Cambridge, Bacon stated
&gt; that he would 'take all knowledge to be his province' and he,
&gt; like the author of the Shakespeare works, came very close to
&gt; his goal.

&gt; Bacon owned literally thousands of books--he would annotate
&gt; them and have the marginalia and underlinings trascribed
&gt; by his scribes into commonplace books.

&gt; Three thousand of Bacon's books and commonplace books
&gt; were collected by one of his English biographers. At the
&gt; biographer's death his estate sold the collection to Folger.
&gt; For the past eighty years Bacon's books have been kept,
&gt; uncatalogued and locked up, in the basement of the Folger
&gt; Library if they haven't been destroyed.

&gt; Two of Bacon's annotated books escaped the lockup and
&gt; are at the University of London. One of them has notes
&gt; for Macbeth in the margins. One commonplace book in
&gt; Bacon's own handwriting is at the British Museum.
&gt; It contains a hundred and twelve notes for Romeo &amp; Juliet
&gt; that are dated in the same months the play was written.

&gt; Those books are just a part of Bacon's system of organizing
&gt; 'all knowledge.' A 16th c. letter survives that describes how
&gt; Bacon would go into the working class districts and observe
&gt; tradesmen at work and (unpatronizingly, as the writer states)
&gt; interview the tradesman about the methods and materials
&gt; of his or her craft. It's probably not a coincidence that computers
&gt; show that the practical handbooks written by Bacon's friend
&gt; Gervase Markham were oddly written by 'Shakespeare.'

&gt; Another of Bacon's books was found in a bookstall in London
&gt; ca 1930 whose marginalia in Bacon's handwriting provides
&gt; clues to the mystery of the Double AA headpieces on the
&gt; Shakespeare works.

&gt; There is also a mystery attached to the disappearance of Bacon's

First, Faker is a treeclimber, not a canvasclimber -- at any rate, all

Phil,

I didn't think the topsail could be cut from the deck, but that seamen
would have to climb the mast to cut it per the ship's log I posted on.

As far as the authorship dispute is concerned, a 'proof' is a matter of
who can show evidence to support the facts, 'proof' is not ceaseless
Strat mewling, unsupported by facts, that the actor 'could have known.'

A witness in a murder trial doesn't testify to what he or
she 'could have known.'

I also dispute that 'anybody' in England could have known the facts you
post above. England was just coming into its own as a maritime nation
in the Stuart era because monopolies had dampened trade and Parliament
was not strong enough to fight the monopolies until ca 1616. The
excitement in England
about ships and sailing really came from the propaganda issued
by the Virginia Company. I doubt The Tempest was ever played for the
public. It was written as a propaganda pamphlet for the Stuart Court.

I'm going to post from A. F. Falconer's two pages on The Tempest
appended to Stephen Orgel's Oxford edition of The Tempest and you can
look that over and see what you think.

Cordially,

Elizabeth

What's being ignored is Shakespeare's empathic ability for ready
comprehension and memory of what people were saying. It may reflect
poorly on us, but many authors have remarked on the stultifying
effects of education on the literary gifted.

We all have some ability to &quot;read&quot; people and their speech, and
Shakespeare can be assumed to be a great reader-spectator of the
contemporary scene, especially marking oral nuances that he refers to
as music at times; e.g., &quot;mark the music.&quot; Must be his environment
was rich with conversations and interests reflecting all the trades,
crafts, and professions of burgeoning London, including that of
merchants and sailors from many countries.

So instead of, Where did Shakespeare get his technical information?
the question might be, Which is the best sort of exercise for a
budding narrative and dramatic author: reading and writing learned
essays or immersing in/digesting the ebb and flow of conversations at
common places? Compiling encyclopedic knowledge or discussing the
news at a tavern and listening to strangers talk about adventures?

I remember an exercise in Advanced Comp to write down what people were
saying, especially to pick up local color dialogue. I went around to
the hotel cafe/bus station late at night, and it was an experience
rich and strange. I can think of some authors who might have been
better off working as reporters instead of studying writing at a
college seminar with an editor or literary celebrity.

you are at a disadvantage arguing this with peter groves on this point, he,
who has probably read all of o'brian, a set of 20 novels comprising
significant detail of the sailing of wooden ships, and nothing invented, but
rather dramatised, sometimes in apocryphal fashion, yet with a wealth of
detail hardly paralledl in any writing. it is indeed hazardous to relieve
the sails during a storm, but barefooted seamen did it in every kind of
weather, from every culture and location, and in every bloody weather, since
time immemorable -the alternative was certain disaster

it is arguable to what degree landlubbers appreciated what it was to sail a
square rigged ship, or even their appreciation of how to row a dingy across
a pond, but...

your objection is a fair one, yet I think it can also be answered fairly in
this case. as o'brain remarks, even about the napoleonic-era admiralty [the
political side of it, rather than the naval] there are some people who do
not understand that ships sail entirely subject to wind and tide

what a belt-making apprentice in stratford, living away from the coast will
have understood from his school is probably very little, or worse than that;
nonsense.

however, immersion, so to speak, in the pool of London, in the intensely
busy port in elizabethan times [more so than even liverpool] where arrivals
and departures were the largest natural dramas to be held [apart from the
plague, and the evil smell of the river - a raw sewer] ... a person would
have to have been particularly isolated not to gain some sense of what it
was to drive a ship in a gale

and to take another step, inept in not finding expert opinion around him on
which to consult - i apologise for confronting your statement with my own,
and indeed i hedge it with a few qualifications, but offer the main view as
a contrast to your statement

yes. i must modified my opinion given above since, even 200 years later,
o'brian notes [often citing Aubrey de Vere, BTW] that many people are truly
dense, and dense particualry on naval matters, beyond any understanding.

but i contrast my reservation with the comment that one would have to be
particularly, even perversely abstracted, not to be able to access and
understand these common naval manoeuvers from relatively common and
accessible sources

Excuse my butting in however...

One should note that the authorship dispute is not at all like a typical
murder trial (or any kind of trial for that matter). The dispute
concerns events that took place 400 or so years ago. In such
circumstances it is to be expected that probative evidence will have,
with the passage of time, have been lost. As such no reliance can be
placed upon the usual forensic trial procedures- such as examination and
cross examination of witnesses, discovery and production of documents etc.

In the shakespeare authorship dispute resort must be had instead to the
historical record. The patchiness of that record cannot fairly be
considered to bear upon the 'stratmans case'- it is a matter of
historical contingency that some records have survived and some had not.
Needless to say it is grossly unfair to draw a negative inference (as
you seem to do) from the fact of a 'lack' of evidence -at least what you
consider a lack of evidence- (frankly the folio and the stratford
monument are about as good a prima facie case as can be made for
authorship and in my opinion trump anything i have seen for bacon or any
other candidate.)

I think the lack of evidence to support Stratman in Shakespeare
authorship attribution arguments has been fairly summed up in the
famous &quot;moot trial&quot; before three US Supreme Court Justices at the
Oxford Society conference in late '80s, where all the judges voted for
Stratman. Justice Brennan's concluding remarks note:

(quote)
The debate about the authorship of these plays, and indeed as well the
sonnets, I think, derives from a perception of the plays as reflecting
a vast knowledge in a number of areas--law, medicine, philosophy,
geography, and so forth --and a belief that William Shakespeare of
Stratford could never possibly have been exposed to the education and
experiences necessary to produce these models of learning and
erudition. Both of these impressions are, I think, inaccurate. For one
thing, the plays, brilliant,witty, and poetic as they undoubtedly
undeniably are, nevertheless are not factually perfect --they contain
a number of errors, amusingly documented by various scholars.
(unquote)

But like tenacious courtroom lawyers, some at h.l.a.s. in favor of
Oxford, Marlowe, or Bacon still argue the evidence or lack of in the
record and what they think is explainable there, including special
circumstances involving outside influences. Right now, it seems
Stratman adversaries are making common cause against him on the basis
of knowledge demonstrated in the text of Tempest that he didn't have.
While the dispute may not be like a murder trial, as you say, it seems
the arguments are having a considerable afterlife among armchair
members of the courtroom at h.l.a.s.

Speculation as to what someone 'could have known' is hearsay. Obviously

&gt; It's not 'grossly unfair' at all because the Strats are trying to

Strat evidence proceds from primary evidence (folio, monument) and

There is no evidence of fabrication of the monument or the folio, both

&gt; I found that only Bacon and the actor have evidence of Shakespeare

&gt; You may laugh but the actor's name is on the title pages, Bacon has the
&gt; manuscripts or what's left of them.
&gt; Bacon's father Sir Nicholas Bacon wrote a book under the name of
&gt; another man--and was evicted from Court for two years for writing the
&gt; book--the Queen didn't care about the mask. His grandfather, Sir

No, prima facie evidence stands until it is shown to be false. No

&gt; The First Folio is no stronger than the actor's name on the title page

No, it has written dedications to the author that identify (inter alia):
1) Persons that personally knew shakespeare
2) That shakespeare the actor was shakespeare the writer
3) that shakespeare was from stratford (sweet swan of avon)
4) that shakespeare was dead at the time the folio was printed

At to circumstantial evidence, that is the process of drawing logical
inferences from other facts. SO for instance we have circumstnatial
evidence that shakespeare went to the school in stratford, or
circumstantial evidence as to how he got his hot little hands on the
strachey letter or as to how he got to know anything at all about
sailing- all that is circumstantial... But the folio is not
circumstantial... it requires no inference from fact, it stand alone as
perfectly good evidence of shakespeare and his authorship.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Jonson is involved in the folio and implicated in the monument.

&gt; The problem for Strats is that Jonson was a professional parodist, on
&gt; record for hating the actor and satirized the actor in EMOHH. Jonson
&gt; makes a poor witness and the 'eulogy' in the FF can be read as a mock
&gt; encomium which were not unheard of in the Elizabethan era. There's
&gt; schoarship on this point.

There is no evidence that shakespeare 'hated' the actor. Nor is there
any sane reason to think that what jonson wrote in the folio was parody.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Jonson was Bacon's 'literary assistant' immediately before he began
&gt; editing the folio. There are entire new scenes and thousands of
&gt; emendations in the authorial hand--not Jonson's--eight new plays that
&gt; were unknown before the FF, fresh manuscripts that never appeared in
&gt; quarto, in other words Jonson had access to play scripts that Henslowe,
&gt; Burbage and the printers never saw and at the time he had access Jonson
&gt; was out at Gorhambury working in Bacon's library.

"/>

As i recall we have no knowledge of who edited the folio.

Nor do you know what Henslowe, Burbage et al did or did not see.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I don't think Bacon was behind the First Folio--Bacon was so old
&gt; fashioned he would have died rather than see his plays in print but
&gt; Bacon's cousin Pembroke was Jonson's patron and very fond of Jonson and
&gt; so those two, in my opinion, colluded to get Bacon's plays into print.
&gt; Bacon didn't even see them as literature--they were ephemera to people

&gt; On a square rigged ship its the yards which are stayed, not the sails which

&gt; otherwise the next wave could poop the ship.

&gt; Its necessary to maintain some sort of canvass up there, [otherwise to run

&gt; under bare poles] even if its only a scrap of cloth in order to maintain
&gt; steerage, otherwise the ship goes side-on to the weather, and that is

&gt; One would cut away all the rigging about a fallen mast, but cutting through
&gt; a mainmast some two feet thick with hand tools might take awhile :) and is
&gt; possibly a more suicidal act than running with full sails - since the mast
&gt; is not replaceable, except by a jury [temporary] mast, and fitting a mast at
&gt; sea [if you have a spare] is the most strenuous activity known to maritime
&gt; experience.

&gt; All of that would be known in the age of sail to anyone who lived by the
&gt; sea, or even in moderately damp locations. Anyone engaged in commerce would
&gt; know it, as well as of course all fishermen, smugglers, and every man jack
&gt; in the navy, or even reasonably alert passengers nipping across the channel.

&gt; There is no location in England more than 70 miles from the sea.

&quot;You've just tripped youself up. You say (and i paraphrase): Bacons
works
contain amazingly few historical errors. OTOH the plays are erudite but

full of errors&quot;

I said that Bacon's works, meaning scientific works, have a lot of
errors because Renaissance science did not yet have a grip on the
facts. Bacon's other works are pretty error-free, for example his
HIstorie of Henrie VII is not only correct as to the facts, Bacon as a
Court insider, included historical facts unavailable to later
historians who had no access to private letters, Tudor family history,
etc so Bacon's history is still cited by scholars.

The Shakespeare works have fewer errors than Bacon's scientific works
because science was just emerging (thanks largely to Bacon) but the
Shakespeare works have more errors than Bacon's Henry VII or
Advancement of Learning because the scope of the erudition in the plays
is as broad as the Renaissance and includes a lot of 'natural
history.' For example Hamlet supports Ptolemian astronomy, then
Copernican and back to Ptolemeian through the course of two quartos and
the First Folio.. That vacillation exactly corresponds with the same
waffling in Bacon's papers and letters written at the same time. Bacon
knew both Brahe and Galileo personally so he had a tough time deciding.
Bacon was also indecisive on a hot core or cold core of the earth and
whether stars were fire. Hamlet is indecisive in the same way. So
some of the 'mistakes' are evidence of Bacon's authorship of Hamlet.

There were two Henry IV fragments that were about a quarto page in
size, one with the margins trimmed. Both were found in the binding of
a late 16th c. copy of Homer. Waste paper was then used to stuff the
binding of books.

The newspaper reported on the 'pot of gold' scene which was
authenticated as Bacon's, photographed side by side with one of Bacon's
letters from approximately the same year but never put up for auction.
It immediately disappeared as far as we know. A second page was
photographed, identified as a sketch for a scene for Henry IV,
withdrawn from auction and privately sold to the Schoyen manuscript
collection in Norway. It is called the 'fourth Shakespeare manuscript'
meaning that there are three other fragments from the period, for
example a student copy of the V &amp; A, there is nothing in the author's
hand if the author is the actor. That page is now owned by the State of
Norway. Farey and Baker made a translation of the secretary hand in
the second manuscript but there were no explicit lines, just a general
sketch of the tavern scene with the gulling of one of the customers by
a character named 'Mr. George' thought to be George Peele. a rascal who
is thought to be one of the models for Falstaff.
That's as much as we know.

"/>

The evidence that we have from the First Folio and the
monument is in fact delightfully ambiguous. For example,
the First Folio was dedicated to the sons of the Countess
of Pembroke, about whom Samuel Daniel wrote:

No no my verse respects nor Thames nor Theaters,
Nor seekes it to be knowne vnto the Great:
But *Auon* rich in fame, though poore in waters,
Shall have my song, where *Delia* hath her seate.
*Auon* shall be my Thames, and she my Song;
Ile sound her name the Ryuer all along.

This is the river Avon that ran through their estate at
Wilton, not the Stratford one. So when they read Jonson's
words:

Sweet Swan of *Auon*! what a sight it were
To see thee in our waters yet appeare,
And make those flights upon the bankes of *Thames*,
That so did take *Eliza* and our *Iames*!

which Avon do you think would come to mind first?

Stratford-upon-Avon was not the only Stratford around
at that time, of course, so it cannot be certain that
the Stratford mentioned by Leonard Digges in his poem
in the First Folio was *necessarily* that one. Even if
we assume that it was, however, his words have another
ambiguity which is quite important:

... when that stone is rent,
And Time dissolues thy *Stratford* Moniment,

The word 'dissolve' could also mean 'to solve, resolve
a question, doubt, etc.'

And when we look at the words on the monument there,
we find that there are several of them which, if given
meanings which, while still acceptable, are different to
the ones we usually give them, a totally new and coherent
message is revealed, indicating that both Shakespeare
*and* Christopher Marlowe are being honoured in it.

Furthermore, these words (seven in all) possess a
feature which makes them distinguishable from virtually
all of the others, and the odds against this match
happening by chance are over a 1000 million to one.

The most common defence offered by orthodox believers,
when faced with this, is that because they just don't
understand statistics - or think that statistics can be
used to prove anything you want - this figure can be
safely ignored!

The use of the phrase 'a typical apple'
indicates a complete (and appalling)

as the phrase 'a typical murder trial' --
which indicates a complete and appalling

&gt;&gt; The 'pattern of survival' can be informative.

&gt; Sometimes, but there is no evidence that anyone ever went out of their

You are wrong. The Stratman's house was in
the possession of the family up to about 1665
-- long after he was famous. (In the 1630s a
group of scholars in Eton agreed that he was
superior to any of the great classical authors.)
There were plenty of antiquaries who were
collecting the papers of famous people (such
as those of John Dee). Libraries were being
established. IF there had been any manuscripts
of Shakespeare for sale, there would have been
a ready and substantial market.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; can be attached. Like everything else
&gt;&gt; concerning this issue, it tells us nothing
&gt;&gt; useful, and only raises more questions.

&gt; I see so, the fact that the folio says shakespeare was from stratford

It doesn't. Its hints in that direction are
of the vaguest nature.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; and that there is a monument to shakespeare in stratford is to be

Certainly not. The strangeness of the few
scraps we do see, and weirdness of the whole

manner of questions. The only satisfactory
answer is that they are all the products of a
fairly minimal but government-sponsored
cover-up.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; Nothing fits because you don;t want it to fit... really is that any way
&gt; to conduct historical research?

"/>

If you want to believe in absurd fantasy
then you are free to do so. The story
of the Stratman is just that. It would be
incredible if the greatest writer of all time
had illiterate parents and illiterate children,
and came from an almost wholly illiterate
small town, not leaving until he was in his
mid-twenties ('retiring' back there in his
mid-forties). We'd need some backing for
such a strange story, but we don't get any.
There are numerous records about the man
in that small town. Not one indicates that
he was even literate, although he was clearly
very proud to have achieved the title of
'gentleman' -- it's on nearly every record.
But that's it. No mention of his supposed
literary achievements. No mention of his
supposed twenty years as a member of the
Royal Household of Elizabeth and James.
No one, at any time, comes to Stratford to
pay his respects to the great man. Those
who do visit his house forget to say anything
about him. The Town Council says nothing
about him. They pay 'his' theatre company
NOT to perform in the town. His family say
nothing about him on their tombstones,
other than (the inevitable) that he was 'a
gentleman' -- and so on, and on.

A couple of vague hints (on the monument
and in the Folio) is not sufficient for any
serious investigator.

Farey,

I'd forgotten all about 'Weele.' I was thinking it was 'Peele.' I do
believe you're wrong about the fragment having nothing to do with Peele
or the tavern scene in Henry IV.

I've read the Merrie Conceited Jests of George Peele and the tavern
scene is strikingly similar to the malicious trickery that Peele would
pull in taverns--he may have had a university MA but he was a hard
bitten con artist. And Strats do believe that Peele was the model for
Falstaff.

Cordially,

Elizabeth

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; there is nothing in the author's

&gt; Norway. Farey and Baker made a translation [sic!] of the secretary hand

"/>

Elizabeth evidently thinks that secretary hand must be translated
rather than transcribed! That's scarcely surprising, since Elizabeth
routinely exhibits fundamental confusions suggesting that English is a
foreign tongue to her -- and an exotic one, at that.

Nigel appears to be relatively new to the newsgroup and to
Elizabeth's vivid (if often lurid) fantasies, so perhaps a little
newsgroup history is in order. Elizabeth has been hallucinating all
manner of bizarre things that nobody else sees in a wide variety of
documents. To take the present case as an example, Elizabeth
hallucinated the presence of the word &quot;Peele&quot; in a manuscript
transcribed by Peter Farey:

&quot;This MS has more going on in it that I suspected. I brought up the
Schoyen original [as opposed to Baker's dark and blurry facimile
[sic] in a picture editor and I could read a lot more of it. I
discovered that 'Mr. George' is George Peele. The first word in line
6 is 'Peele.' The line following addresses Mr. George. Peele
specialized in the kind of thing Rita describes--drinking and
fighting and conning the tavern owners. The page looks like a satire
of George Peele.

&quot;Now I'm wondering if Bacon used Peele as the model for Falstaff.&quot;

&lt;&gt;

Elizabeth continues volubly in the same vein through a good many posts:

&quot;I think the fragment may represent the birth of the character
Falstaff. The 'Peele' line appears just before the 'Mr. George'
line. [That means there are at least three characters in the script
since his boon companion calls him 'Peele' and the innkeeper
appropriately calls him 'Mr. George'].&quot;

&lt;&gt;

Here she addresses Peter Farey:

&quot;You and Baker were trying to decipher the dark and blurry
copier facimile Baker has on his website.

&quot;After you and Baker posted your transcription I discovered
the original Schoyen Henry IV page online and brought
it up in a picture editor magnified at high resolution.
The image of the original is quite crisp.

&quot;The word 'Peele' is close to the margin in line 6.

&quot;I was also able to read more words of the lines above and
below the cracked fold. I've already posted on this.
You've forgotten.&quot;

Perhaps funniest of all, Elizabeth exulted:

&quot;I discovered 'Peele' in the margin after Farey and Baker missed it.
Farey called me every kind of idiot, I supplied the MS line number
for 'Peele' and Farey ducked out.&quot;

&lt;&gt;

Peter Farey's temperate reply (slightly edited below) is right on
target, and exhibits admirable restraint:

&quot;An inability to read accurately, to comprehend what has been
read, and to make logical inferences are common failings among
the contributors to HLAS, and I am not averse to pointing this
out when appropriate. I do not recall, however, having on any
occasion called anyone 'every kind of idiot'

&quot;Far from 'ducking out', what I actually said (and it still
stands) was:

You are becoming even more sad, Elizabeth.

The words either say (as we claim):

'We'll pay thee when we do return again.'
'As you please, Mr. George.'

or (as you claim)

'Peele pay thee when we do return again.'
'As you please, Mr. George.'

Now, if you are able to explain to us all exactly
what 'Peele pay thee when we do return again.'
actually means, I will of course examine what you
have to say with some interest. Failing that, I fear
that at least one anti-Stratfordian will have to
join the serried ranks of those who regard most
of what you have to say as worthless.

I examined with some care the copy upon which you claimed to
have found the words 'let Peele' and found no such thing.
&lt;&gt;
It still says - with the original spelling, of course -
precisely what I claimed it says (above).

If you have indeed explained what you think these lines
actually say, then I fear I must have missed it. Please tell
us again, in your actual words if possible, as the links you
cite (such as the one about the 'MS line number' you gave
above) seldom say what you claim them to have done.&quot;

By all means, see Peter Farey's post at the URL below; it summarizes the
whole Weird comic contretemps admirably:

&lt;&gt;

But Elizabeth's hallucination of all sorts of bizarre (nonexistent)
content in all sorts of documents is by no means confined to this one
instance, hilarious though this one may be. One of the funniest is
Elizabeth's fabrication of quotations that she supposedly found in Dave
Kathman's essay on dating _The Tempest_ -- in at least *four posts*,
Elizabeth invented bizarre quotations that she attributed to Dave
Kathman. All her &quot;quotations&quot; ascribed to Richard Field the role of
deilvering the Strachey letter to Shakespeare -- yet Field is not
mentioned *at all* in Dave's essay. Matters being so, one must conclude
either that Elizabeth did not read Dave's essay or that she hallucinated
the &quot;quotations&quot; that she &quot;found&quot; therein.

Another amusing example of Elizabeth's hallucination of nonexistent
text is her attribution of complete nonsense to Wang, Dogariu, and
Kuzmich, physicists who performed a cesium cell superluminal light
propagation experiment a few years ago. Elizabeth, apparently actuated
by her purely ideological, obsessional anti-Einstein animus and
apparently fantasizing wishfully that the Wang-Dogariu-Kuzmich
experiment somehow refutes the special theory of relativity (of which
Elizabeth does not even possess the understanding of a bright middle
school student) and restores nineteenth century &quot;aether theory,&quot; claimed
that Wang, Dogariu, and Kuzmich had no explanation for their result and
that they were mystified by its outcome. Indeed, here is an excerpt
from Elizabeth's reply to a post of mine in which I quoted Elizabeth's
claim:

----------------------------------------------

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&quot;Did you read about the cesium cell experiment done at Princeton
&gt;    a year or so ago?  The Princeton physicists don't have a theory

"/>

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; They admit, like Stephanie, that
&gt;    'they're still loooooking.'

"/>

Their very words.
----------------------------------------------

Of course, Elizabeth never furnished any source whatever for &quot;their very
words&quot; (and incidentally, if Elizabeth imagines that Wang, Dogariu, and
Kuzmich wrote &quot;still loooooking&quot; or quoted Stephanie Caruana in the
scientific literature, then Elizabeth must be even more delusional than
is readily apparent). However, Elizabeth could have refuted her own
hallucinations by the simple expedient of visiting Arthur Dogariu's web
site, where one finds the following:

&quot;Our experiment is not at odds with Einstein¹s special relativity.
The experiment can be well explained using existing physics theories
that are consistent with Relativity. In fact, the experiment was
designed based on calculations using existing physics theories.&quot;

&lt;&gt;

Thus another Elizabeth Weird hallucination is dispelled -- but there are
MANY more: Akrigg, Poincaré, Hsu, etc.

Peter, you've been reading Elizabeth long enough to realize that that
innocuous phrase is *more* than enough for her -- see, for example, the
uproariously funny thread about Southampton wearing a theatrical wig.
After all, Elizabeth thinks that Shakespeare could not possibly have
depicted a nautical scene with any verisimilitude, because there were no
books published on seamanship at the time; by Elizabeth's &quot;logic,&quot; there
can have been no seamen then either, since there was no sailors'

&gt; We do *not* know that it has anything to do with George Peele.
&gt; Your phrase &quot;thought to be&quot; is a semantic trick which gets right

For someone who barely speaks any English, Elizabeth's mastery of the
use of the passive voice is indeed remarkable. She is forever dredging
up things &quot;thought&quot; by scholars, &quot;reported&quot; by experts, &quot;acknowledged&quot;
by Stratfordians, &quot;agreed&quot; upon by historians, &quot;authenticated&quot; by
specialists, etc. -- however, she is curiously at a loss when prompted

Some of this stuff is being scanned onto a CD. If I can get a copy
I'll post it. As I state, Kathman and Reedy use these literary
allusions as a substitute for direct evidence. I personally have not
seen two hundred allusions to 'Shakespeare'--I've seen probably fifty.
Strats and Baconians--turn of the last century--use the figure 'two
hundred' or other figures in that range. I think there are actually
more than two hundred, for example I just downloaded a journal article
by the Shakespeare critic Richard Levin who found a late 16th c,
ballad about an entertainer 'Shakerag' that fits the actor's m.o. and
has some elements that support the authorship theory.

That's correct. It is circumstantial evidence but it's the kind of
circumstantial evidence that other evidence can corroborate.

There's nothing wrong with a circumstantial case. It has the same
weight in law as direct evidence.

The printed quarto and folio title pages that Strats think 'proves'
their case are only circumstantial evidence. The references to 'echo,
ape, crow,' the overall record of a money-grubbing hustler in London
and Stratford and the total absence of personal literary evidence--the
list of objections is very long--essentially compel us to make
inferences about the title pages. And that's perfectly legitimate.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;One should note that the authorship dispute is not at all like a typical

&gt;&gt;&gt;I doubt if any trial lawyer would accept that

&gt;&gt;Similary I might say 'there is no such thing as a typical apple, some

&gt; The use of the phrase 'a typical apple'

The folio says that william shakespeare was an actor in the plays. There

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;and the stratford monument

&gt;&gt;&gt;The monument is to 'Shakespeare' -- with
&gt;&gt;&gt;no Christian name. It has one cryptic line
&gt;&gt;&gt;in Latin, to which no particular meaning
&gt;&gt;&gt;can be attached. Like everything else
&gt;&gt;&gt;concerning this issue, it tells us nothing
&gt;&gt;&gt;useful, and only raises more questions.

&gt;&gt;I see so, the fact that the folio says shakespeare was from stratford

&gt; It doesn't. Its hints in that direction are
&gt; of the vaguest nature.

ah, obsfucation. How droll!

Lets talk about reasonable inference rather than slight or mere
possibility, hmmm?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;and that there is a monument to shakespeare in stratford is to be
&gt;&gt;disregarded as illusory?

&gt; Certainly not. The strangeness of the few
&gt; scraps we do see, and weirdness of the whole
&gt; story that we are asked to believe, raise all
&gt; manner of questions. The only satisfactory
&gt; answer is that they are all the products of a
&gt; fairly minimal but government-sponsored
&gt; cover-up.

Sir, you speak with apodictic certainty of things you surely cannot have
but the slenderest knowledge of. Were shakespeares parents really
illiterate? Perhaps. Perhapos the evidence suggests they were. But there
certainly is no demonstrative proof of the fact. As for the town being
illiterate, i seem to recall that there was a school there. Are you
suggesting the schoolmasters were illiterate and taught the children to
be illiterate? Or is the school just a hoax foistered upon unsuspecting
dullards (such as myself, obviously), all in order that the grand
conspiracy to hide the good earls authorship could gain some sleight
currency

&gt; which Avon do you think would come to mind first?

"/>

The phrase ''sweet swan of avon'' has a clear referent. The preamble to
jonson's poem says: &quot;To the memory of my beloved, The Author Mr William
Shakespeare&quot;. Consider (1) Mr William Shakespeare was from stratford
(see inter alia Diggs in the folio, monument in stratford). (2) A river
called Avon flows through that place (see atlas). (3) A poet is
sometimes called a swan (OED, cf Vergil). (4) William Shakespeare wsa a
poet (by the contents of the folio).

The only *reasonable* inference to make on these facts is that the
referent of the phrase 'sweet swan of avon' is Mr William Shakespeare of
stratford (on avon).

What came into the minds of the sons of lady pembroke- well it matters
not at all.

The OED mentions use of dissolve in the sense of 'to solve, resolve

&gt;&gt;&gt;Sometimes, but there is no evidence that anyone ever went out of their

&gt;&gt; -- long after he was famous. (In the 1630s a

&gt;&gt; superior to any of the great classical authors.)
&gt;&gt; There were plenty of antiquaries who were
&gt;&gt; collecting the papers of famous people (such

I might mention that Queen Henrietta Maria
(wife of Charles II -- who had a personal and
much-perused copy of the Folio) stayed in
New Place for several days when passing
through in 1643. Don't you think she, or her
courtiers, might have picked up a few of the
Great Bard's drafts. Or left a note, or
something -- anything?

You believe that the Stratman was the
famous poet. What do you think is the
most likely cause of the complete absence
of any document from his hand? OR of
any document from any person who ever
met him?

The true reasons are that
(a) illiterate people don't usually produce
many written documents; and
(b) he had government 'minders' all his
life to ensure that he did not meet anyone
who might leave a revealing note.

Reasonable inference is that there is something
very strange going on. Even Strats agree with
that. The current fashionable theory is that the
poet was a Catholic, and that must be why he
kept such a low profile. (But somehow these
theorists don't seem to notice that 'he' put on
a lot of plays, and published a lot of stuff.)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; story that we are asked to believe, raise all
&gt;&gt; manner of questions. The only satisfactory
&gt;&gt; answer is that they are all the products of a
&gt;&gt; fairly minimal but government-sponsored

Most shut their minds to all questions,
or say that it's all God's doing and it's

All they had to do was to remove the

So it's probable that the greatest writer

of illiterates? It's probable that he would
bring his own children up as illiterates?
It's probable that he would never leave a

It's probable that he would never say a
word about his life? It's probable that no
one else would either? It's probable that
he would never write a word to anyone?
It's probable that he would never mention
a living soul in his works or in connection
with them (except for one 'dedication' to
Southampton)? And so on and on and
on . . .

Nope. It does not. And the 'picture' is a bust,

Everyone does. That was the official status

True. But no one went there to meet him while

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; That's correct. It is circumstantial evidence but it's the kind of
&gt; circumstantial evidence that other evidence can corroborate.

&gt; There's nothing wrong with a circumstantial case. It has the same
&gt; weight in law as direct evidence.

"/>

There's always a lot of loose talk on HLAS about evidence. Here are some
definitions from legal dictionary sites.

1)
&quot;CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE - Circumstantial evidence is best explained by
saying what it is not - it is not direct evidence from a witness who saw or
heard something. Circumstantial evidence is a fact that can be used to infer
another fact.&quot;
&quot;Indirect evidence that implies something occurred but doesn't directly
prove it; proof of one or more facts from which one can find another fact;
proof of a chain of facts and circumstances indicating that the person is
either guilty or not guilty.
&quot;E.g., If a man accused of embezzling money from his company had made
several big-ticket purchases in cash around the time of the alleged
embezzlement, that would be circumstantial evidence that he had stolen the
money. The law makes no distinction between the weight given to either
direct or circumstantial evidence.&quot;
&quot;E.g., X is suing his wife, Y, for a divorce, claiming she is having an
affair with Z. Z's fingerprints are found on a book in X and Y's bedroom. A
judge or jury may infer that Z was in the bedroom. The fingerprints are
circumstantial evidence of Z's presence in the bedroom. Circumstantial
evidence is usually not as good as direct evidence (an eyewitness saw Z in
the bedroom) because it is easy to make the wrong inference - Y may have
loaned Z the book and then carried it back to the bedroom herself after
getting it back.&quot;
&quot;Circumstantial evidence is generally admissible in court unless the
connection between the fact and the inference is too weak to be of help in
deciding the case. Many convictions for various crimes have rested largely
on circumstantial evidence.&quot;
&quot;DIRECT EVIDENCE - Evidence that stands on its own to prove an alleged
fact, such as testimony of a witness who says she saw a defendant pointing a
gun at a victim during a robbery. Direct proof of a fact, such as testimony
by a witness about what that witness personally saw or heard or did.&quot;

3)
&quot;circumstantial evidence&quot;
&quot;n. evidence in a trial which is not directly from an eyewitness or
participant and requires some reasoning to prove a fact. There is a public
perception that such evidence is weak (&quot;all they have is circumstantial
evidence&quot;), but the probable conclusion from the circumstances may be so
strong that there can be little doubt as to a vital fact (&quot;beyond a
reasonable doubt&quot; in a criminal case, and &quot;a preponderance of the evidence&quot;
in a civil case). Particularly in criminal cases, &quot;eyewitness&quot; (&quot;I saw
Frankie shoot Johnny&quot;) type evidence is often lacking and may be unreliable,
so circumstantial evidence becomes essential. Prior threats to the victim,
fingerprints found at the scene of the crime, ownership of the murder
weapon, and the accused being seen in the neighborhood, certainly point to
the suspect as being the killer, but each bit of evidence is
circumstantial.&quot;
&quot;direct evidence&quot;
&quot;n. real, tangible or clear evidence of a fact, happening or thing that
requires no thinking or consideration to prove its existence, as compared to
circumstantial evidence&quot;

The definitions confirm your statement: the law &quot;makes no distinction betwe
en the weight&quot; of the two types of evidence.

But they also make it clear that the *quality* of the evidence is what is
most important: &quot;Circumstantial evidence is usually not as good as direct
evidence&quot;, and circumstantial evidence is admissable &quot;unless the connection
between the fact and the inference is too weak to be of help in deciding the
case&quot;.

To say that &quot;Bacon had expert knowledge of seamanship&quot; is nice, but there's
no actual connection to the inference &quot;Therefore he wrote Tempest, Act I,
Scene 1&quot;. What you are missing is the intervening statement: &quot;Only Bacon
had this knowledge&quot;, which is contradicted by &quot;Anyone in London had access
to that information.&quot; and &quot;People who want to know about a subject
frequently research it&quot;. Please note: I am not introducing my rebuttal as
evidence that Shakespeare wrote the scene in question, but to demonstrate
that your evidence is weak. Perhaps admissible, but it certainly doesn't
make your case.

I'm not going to call you on saying that the title pages of the quartos are
circumstantial, although to me they look more like direct evidence - they
are direct statements that &quot;Shakespeare wrote these plays&quot;. They can be
mistaken or lies, but that's not how you distinguish between direct and
circumstantial evidence. For what it's worth, generally quarto title pages
from the era are accurate, but there are certainly many inaccuracies as
well, so for the moment we'll let this topic pass.

You can't dismiss the Folio so lightly. (For one thing, folios of collected
works from that period - issued as tributes or self-tributes - do not have
the same attribution problems as quartos.)

Personally, I would call the Folio &quot;direct evidence&quot;. Witnesses testify
that Shakespeare wrote the plays. There's no inference required. They
could be mistaken, or lying, of course, but again that isn't what makes
evidence &quot;circumstantial&quot;.

But....

No one said &quot;I sat and watched Will write Hamlet, from beginning to end&quot;, so
for argument's sake let's say that the Folio evidence is circumstantial.
Then, the *quality* of the evidence is what's important.
1) Hemmings, Condell, Jonson, and Digges (among others) are directly
stating that &quot;to my knowledge Shakespeare wrote these plays&quot;. They attached
their names to a publication, and in these four cases clearly identified
Shakespeare as the author. That's as close as we're going to get to
eye-witness testimony.
2) These four witnesses are very credible. They are not known liars, have
no known axe to grind, and were in a position to know the truth:
- Hemmings and Condell, having rehearsed and performed the plays
with Shakespeare over a period of many years, could not have failed to
discover it if he were not the real author.
- It is highly unlikely that Jonson could have been fooled about the
authorship, although I won't make this statement as strongly as the one
above.
- Digges's contribution is cloudier, but he knew Shakespeare and, as
a minor poet himself, was in a position to judge if Will was capable of
authorship.

Contrast this with &quot;Bacon knew enough about seamanship to write Tempest, Act
I, Scene 1&quot;. Just not the same thing, is it? These four can be lying, but
they are not mistaken. I think you have to find a way to discredit their
testimony, or all the (flimsy) circumstantial evidence that someone else
wrote the plays isn't going to help.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; The printed quarto and folio title pages that Strats think 'proves'

"/>

Note that the legal definitions above warn us about dismissing evidence as
&quot;only&quot; circumstantial. It's the quality of the evidence and the linkage
between the fact and the inference that's important. I'd also be careful
about throwing around the word &quot;proves&quot;. I've never said the primary
evidence &quot;proves&quot; Shakespeare's authorship (and I don't recall anyone else
saying so, except perhaps in a casual way). What I've always said is along
the lines of &quot;the evidence for Shakespeare's authorship far outweighs the
evidence against it.&quot;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; ape, crow,' the overall record of a money-grubbing hustler in London
&gt; and Stratford and the total absence of personal literary evidence--the

It does prove the case. Though i wouldn't call it circumstantial- people
actually say that Mr Will Shakespeare of stratford on avon was actor,
poet... does anyone actually say (without equivocation) that Sir Francis
Bacon was THE poet? I think not.

&quot;CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE - Circumstantial evidence is best explained by
saying what it is not - it is not direct evidence from a witness who saw
or heard something. Circumstantial evidence is a fact that can be used
to infer another fact.

Indirect evidence that implies something occurred but doesn't directly
prove it; proof of one or more facts from which one can find another
fact; proof of a chain of facts and circumstances indicating that the
person is either guilty or not guilty.&quot;

(From: The 'Lectric Law Library's Lexicon On
* Circumstances, Circumstantial Evidence *
) [not a very prestigous source, but
it shall do for present purposes...]:

So, the folio is direct evidence of shakespeare authorship, it is
evidence of what Jonson, Digges et al knew. It does not require an
inference to demonstrate that shakespeare was the author- these people
are saying, directly that shakespeare was the author of the works.

The case for Bacon OTOH is purely circumstantial, nobody actually says
that bacon was the author of the shakespeare works, instead reliance
must be placed on a chain of inferences in the manner of: (1) Bacon was
a very learned man; (2) will shakespeare of stratford on avon was not;
(3) the shakespeare works display incredible expertise over numerous
subjects; (4) Will shakespeare not being a learned man could never have
written such learned works.

Of course (2); (3) (arguably); and (4)(consequently) are all false.

Note that you cna question direct evidence, as for instance direct
evidence may be questioned in a court when a prosecution witness, having
been examined by the prosecution is cross examined by the defence. That
does njot however change the nature of the evidence.

Webb,

There's an economy in HLAS which you never fail to violate.

You introduce nothing, you post nothing of substance, you never start a
thread on any subject relevent to the HLAS charter, you violate the
Charter everytime you come into HLAS.

All you do is kibitz, kitbitz, bitch, bitch, bitch.

I'm working on a post that shows that several sections of the Historia
Ventorum directly respond to Falconer's treatise on the expertise of
seamanship in The Tempest.

The Baconians missed this because they took Bacon's observations
literally but if you rewrite it as a leeward wind as in The Tempest,
Bacon's observations on 'how not to drift leeward' are word for word
those in Falconer. Bacon even understand's Falconer's explanation of
the 'two points of the wind&quot;' as Bacon describes how of the thirty-two
points of the compass, the sixteen points of the compass 'on the
horizon' can be divided into two sections of points that, depending on
the 'points of the wind' (apparently seen by the angle of the wind as
it hits the sails) can be used to navigate away from the shore with a
combination of striking sails and setting sails when the helm and
rudder are useless. That, as Falconer shows, is in The Tempest.

If I were a Strat propping up the barely transparent racist imperialism
of Stratfordianism I could probably get this printed.

When I have time I will make a cut-and-past template of facts with
URLs to refute you everytime you cut-and-paste lies and half-lies.

Clarification: the fact that some people wrote behind masks ('it was not
unheard of') does not mean that it is open to advocate that an author
wrote being a mask without evidence of an author writing behind a mask.

As I say, there is no persuasive evidence that william shakespeare was a
'mask' for bacon or anybody else.

Evidence that you adduce for the purpose:
(1) Bacon was said to be a concealed poet. This could mean many things.
For instance, that bacon wrote poetry that was not published, that
bacons works were poetic (i.e. poetic in nature but not in form), etc.
It could also mean, as you claim, that bacon wrote behind a 'mask'.

There is however nothing in the letter on being a 'concealed poet' to
suggest that bacon was writing behind a 'mask' as shakespeare. In order
to reach the conclusion that Bacon was writing behind a 'mask' as
shakespeare, we are required to draw on circumstantial evidence such as
'expertise', 'coincidence' and the like.

SO putting hte best spin on your argument, what you have is evidence
that bacon was a concealed poet supported by circumstantial evidence
like 'expertise evident in the works supports bacons authoprship' (which
I think is false), 'there are passages almost identical in shakespeare
and bacon' (which BTW i consider false and trivial- many elizabethans
used similar conventions in their writings- see e,g, mentioned just
recently. jonson in first folio and daniels sonnets).

In other words you have direct evidence that Bacon is a concealed poet
(whatever that might mean) supported by dubious circumstantial evidence
of bacons authorship of the shakespeare canon. In constrast the strat
case has various instances of direct and indirect evidence that william
shakespeare of stratford on avon was a poet and actor (folio, monument,
etc) which *includes* attestations by the very people that he knew and
worked with. I know where my money lies.

I'm not suggesting that the fact that Bacon signed himself 'a concealed
poet' is 'proof' of authorship of the Shakespeare works. If I thought
that I'd still be an Oxfordian. It's only 'a fact' as part of a
circumstantial case.

In a circumstantial case it's only necessary to show that the evidence
is more probative or less probative of something offered as fact. The
letter is more
probative (than not) that Bacon was a poet and that he concealed his
poetry.

It's importance in the sense that it refutes the Strat claim that Bacon
was not a concealed poet. Abbott is the only Strat who accepted that
Bacon was a concealed poet on the basis of the letter to Sir John
Davies. I just posted
on Abbott's acknowledgment.

The Shakespeare authorship dispute is not a problem in logic.

It's news to Strats that any Elizabethans wrote behind masks.

While there is no evidence that his father and grandfather's experience
compelled Bacon to write behind masks, it establishes a precedence.

That they did only answers the question 'did the Bacon-Cooke family
have a tradition of writing behind masks?' It isn't direct proof that
Bacon wrote behind a mask but with other evidence, such as the
Northumberland MS which suggests that Bacon was writing as 'William
Shakespeare' then you can bring the antecedents into the argument.

As I wrote above, and in a post a couple of months ago, Edwin (Abbott
Abbott) Abbott wrote, in a sneering biography of Bacon calculated to
elevate, by comparison and on behalf of racist imperialist British
colonialism that icon of virile and viruous Anglo-Saxon genius the
actor, that Bacon's letter was adequate evidence to show that Bacon was
a concealed poet. That's from Abbott. One of the big three of the
19th century.

Greg wrote,

&quot;He wasn't that good of one, revealing his own concealment and all.&quot;

He'd saved Davies life--got clemency from Elizabeth for him--in the
aftermath of the Essex rebellion so Davies was hardly going to
blackmail Bacon.

When Bacon's letter was written, Davies was on his way to meet James VI
with Nosce Teipsum, the title of which appeared six or more years
earlier in Bacon's commonplace book. That may explain 'be good to
concealed poets.' The rest of Davies' poems are pretty crude by
comparison. Bacon had a great number of friends and poetry was then
currency at Court and contrary to Abbott and the rest of the
imperialist lackeys, Bacon was 'gentle' and 'sweet' and loved by many,
something that can't be said of the actor.

debate because her (your) witnesses contradicted themselves and each
other and my witnesses did not. Go look up the post.

I'm willing to go through your screed and straighten out the record but

Actually looking (quickly) at the phrase in the letter (which I had not
done) , I note (1) that the inference that bacon was one of the number
of concealed poets does not necessarily follow from the letter. Bacon
asks davies to be good to concealed poets. That is not an admission that
bacon was in fact a concealed poet. It is just a request that davies be
good to concealed poets. There is nothing in the phrase 'be good to
concealed poets' that suggests the person who wrote the phrase was in
fact a concealed poet (although it also does not exclude that as a
possibility).

(2) The phrase ''concealed poets'' is plural, if bacon was referring to
himself as a concealed poet, then why did he not say 'be good to a
concealed poet'. Are we to presume then that there were multiple
concealed poets? If so why should we assume that bacon and not one of
these other unknown concealed poets has a right to the authorship.

The phrase, because of its ambiguity, because it has no clear referent
possess little (as you like to say) probative value.

&gt;&gt; The evidence that we have from the First Folio and the
&gt;&gt; monument is in fact delightfully ambiguous. For example,
&gt;&gt; the First Folio was dedicated to the sons of the Countess
&gt;&gt; of Pembroke, about whom Samuel Daniel wrote:

&gt;&gt; No no my verse respects nor Thames nor Theaters,
&gt;&gt; Nor seekes it to be knowne vnto the Great:
&gt;&gt; But *Auon* rich in fame, though poore in waters,
&gt;&gt; Shall have my song, where *Delia* hath her seate.
&gt;&gt; *Auon* shall be my Thames, and she my Song;
&gt;&gt; Ile sound her name the Ryuer all along.

&gt;&gt; This is the river Avon that ran through their estate at
&gt;&gt; Wilton, not the Stratford one. So when they read Jonson's
&gt;&gt; words:

&gt;&gt; Sweet Swan of *Auon*! what a sight it were
&gt;&gt; To see thee in our waters yet appeare,
&gt;&gt; And make those flights upon the bankes of *Thames*,
&gt;&gt; That so did take *Eliza* and our *Iames*!

&gt;&gt; which Avon do you think would come to mind first?

&gt; The phrase ''sweet swan of avon'' has a clear referent.
&gt; The preamble to jonson's poem says: &quot;To the memory of
&gt; my beloved, The Author Mr William Shakespeare&quot;. Consider
&gt; (1) Mr William Shakespeare was from stratford (see inter
&gt; alia Diggs in the folio, monument in stratford). (2) A
&gt; river called Avon flows through that place (see atlas).
&gt; (3) A poet is sometimes called a swan (OED, cf Vergil).
&gt; (4) William Shakespeare wsa a poet (by the contents of
&gt; the folio).

&gt; The only *reasonable* inference to make on these facts
&gt; is that the referent of the phrase 'sweet swan of avon'
&gt; is Mr William Shakespeare of stratford (on avon).

&gt; What came into the minds of the sons of lady pembroke-
&gt; well it matters not at all.

"/>

Yes, Nigel, but I haven't said that it's not a &quot;reasonable
inference&quot; have I? I was arguing solely with your claim that
both the monument and the folio &quot;clearly and *unambiguously*
(my emphasis) identify the author of the shakespeare cannon
as william shakespeare of stratford&quot;. My claim is simply
that there is quite enough ambiguity there for Jonson and
Digges to have been playing games with us, had they so
wished.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Stratford-upon-Avon was not the only Stratford around
&gt;&gt; at that time, of course, so it cannot be certain that
&gt;&gt; the Stratford mentioned by Leonard Digges in his poem
&gt;&gt; in the First Folio was *necessarily* that one.

&gt; Are you suggesting that Digges is referring to another
&gt; stratford with another monument of shakespeare?

"/>

No, I am not. I am saying that, as this phrase does not
say Stratford-upon-Avon, it would have been *possible*
for Digges to have meant some other monument if he had
had a mind to.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; If so, where is your evidence or are you just asserting
&gt; nonsense without any evidence whatsoever?

"/>

As should be clear, I am assuming that Digges was in fact
referring to the monument in Stratford-upon-Avon, despite
the possible ambiguity I have indicated.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Even if
&gt;&gt; we assume that it was, however, his words have another
&gt;&gt; ambiguity which is quite important:

&gt;&gt; ... when that stone is rent,
&gt;&gt; And Time dissolues thy *Stratford* Moniment,

&gt;&gt; The word 'dissolve' could also mean 'to solve, resolve
&gt;&gt; a question, doubt, etc.'

&gt; The OED mentions use of dissolve in the sense of 'to solve,
&gt; resolve a question, doubt, etc.' only with reference to
&gt; immaterial objects such as questions, riddles etc.
&gt; Consequently I do not think (correct me if you can) it
&gt; was accepted use of dissolve to mean 'to solve, resolve
&gt; a question, doubt, etc.' in repect of a material object,
&gt; such as a monument.

"/>

This is a good point, and one that has, as far as I recall,
not been mentioned before. However, such a grammatical nicety
is unlikely to have prevented this usage had Digges wanted to
have fun with us, and knew that the monument's epigraph was
in fact a puzzle. I'm sure I could find a far worse solecism
than this in a known riddle.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; In any case you have no evidence, aside from your
&gt; *assertion* of the 'fact', that Digges meant dissolve in
&gt; that sense.

"/>

I suggest you go back and check my words, which had nothing
of the certainty you imply here.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; And when we look at the words on the monument there,
&gt;&gt; we find that there are several of them which, if given
&gt;&gt; meanings which, while still acceptable, are different to
&gt;&gt; the ones we usually give them, a totally new and coherent
&gt;&gt; message is revealed, indicating that both Shakespeare
&gt;&gt; *and* Christopher Marlowe are being honoured in it.

&gt; I see, so what evidence do you have for this aside from
&gt; your *assertion* of the 'fact'.

May I invite you - and anyone else who is interested and

it would be very difficult - probably almost impossible -
to find its presence indicated by a simple key to finding
it.

Notice that it is the *key* that is the important bit as
far as the Friedmans were concerned in determining the
probability of a message hidden in the form of a cipher
being valid. I have simply applied this approach to the
clue which I say leads to the message hidden in the
epigraph. This is what they say about the cryptanalyst's
task:

&lt;quote)

&quot;But if there is rhyme and reason about the way he has
reached the solution, if the system really is a rational
and consistent system, the keys really keys, and if when
they are rigorously applied they produce a plain text
which is really a text, he can begin to take himself
seriously. The point must be reached where he begins
to feel that the whole thing did not and could not
happen by accident. But it is not simply a matter of
his feeling this; the assessment can be far more rigorous.
The mathematical theory of probability can be applied,
and the chances calculated exactly. If the cryptanalyst
finds a certain key and (on the basis of the way it is
built up) he calculates that the chances of its appearing
by accident are one in one thousand million, his
confidence in the solution will be more than justified.&quot;

&gt; (2) The phrase ''concealed poets'' is plural, if bacon was referring to
&gt; himself as a concealed poet, then why did he not say 'be good to a
&gt; concealed poet'. Are we to presume then that there were multiple concealed
&gt; poets? If so why should we assume that bacon and not one of these other
&gt; unknown concealed poets has a right to the authorship.

"/>

Certainly others have considered multiple sources behind the Poet.

They have phrased it differently:-

Rowse suspected Bacon in particular for LLL, and that play is a mockery on
the subject of male fraternal orientation alone [such as Rosicrucianism, eg.
This point acknowledged by fellow 'Strat' Hughes].

Rowse even suspected Bacon to be the major contributor to LLL, but always
with Billy the Poet writing the front-end.

So, the distinction I make is that there might be, over time, many concealed
influences and persons making contributions to the plays, but the
significant value of William of Stratford was that /he/ was the poet who
could apply the words and the dramatic pace, pith and textural pattern to
the play, and as such /he/ was 'the mask' behind which many could otherwise
contribute to content.

Since this view of things makes greater explanation of all the anomalies
inherent in finding such a protean and singular genius in the person of any
one individual;-

and since it is not en-camped entirely here nor there;

and since Rowse also wrote that it would take Academe 50 years to catch up
with this commonplace non-partisan observation;

he seems to have erred only in the optimism of his prediction.

Truth is Truth
To the end of reckoning

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Sometimes, but there is no evidence that anyone ever went out of their
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;way to destroy any documents relating to shakespeare.

&gt;&gt;&gt;You are wrong. The Stratman's house was in
&gt;&gt;&gt;the possession of the family up to about 1665
&gt;&gt;&gt;-- long after he was famous. (In the 1630s a
&gt;&gt;&gt;group of scholars in Eton agreed that he was
&gt;&gt;&gt;superior to any of the great classical authors.)
&gt;&gt;&gt;There were plenty of antiquaries who were
&gt;&gt;&gt;collecting the papers of famous people (such
&gt;&gt;&gt;as those of John Dee). Libraries were being
&gt;&gt;&gt;established. IF there had been any manuscripts
&gt;&gt;&gt;of Shakespeare for sale, there would have been
&gt;&gt;&gt;a ready and substantial market.

&gt;&gt;There is still no evidence of wilful destruction.

&gt; I might mention that Queen Henrietta Maria
&gt; (wife of Charles II -- who had a personal and
&gt; much-perused copy of the Folio) stayed in
&gt; New Place for several days when passing
&gt; through in 1643. Don't you think she, or her
&gt; courtiers, might have picked up a few of the

&gt;&gt;Sir, you speak with apodictic certainty of things you surely cannot have

&gt; All they had to do was to remove the

Now, over 400 years later, we should, with
the benefit of hindsight, be able to make
reasonable guesses as to:

i) Who this person was (or persons were);
ii) His (or their) motives for concealment;
iii) The name or names under which he
(or they) published their work.

The last is probably the easiest course to
follow initially. What name of an otherwise
well-known poet has no known living person?
Or has the body of a wholly unfitting person
attached?

What otherwise well-known name is very
likely to be contrived -- one made up by
an Elizabethan poet?

The issue of the motives for concealment

It is fascinating, though, Dave. I'm surprised there isn't more interest in
this letter:

Mr. Davis,
Though you went on the sudden, yet you could not go before you had
spoken with yourself to the purpose which I will now write. And therefore I
know it shall be altogether needless, save that I meant to show you that I
am not asleep. Briefly, I commend myself to your love and to the well using
of my name, as well in repressing and answering for me, if there be any
biting or nibbling at it in that place, as in impressing a good conceit and
opinion of me, chiefly in the King (of whose favour I make myself
comfortable assurance), as otherwise in that court. And not only so, but
generally to perform to me all the good offices which the vivacity of your
wit can suggest to your mind to be performed to one, in whose affection you
have so great sympathy, and in whose fortune you have so great interest. So
desiring you to be good to concealed poets, I continue
Your very assured,
FR. BACON.
Gray's Inn, this
28th of March, 1603.

We could try to &quot;translate&quot; it the way we do the sonnets as the entire
text is rather enigmatic, perhaps in keeping with concealment. Since the
letter itself (except for the signature) is written by one of Bacon's men,
it is unlikely, as Greg says, that Bacon is naming himself as the concealed
poet, although it's possible. There is an interesting change of pronoun
also, from the &quot;I/me&quot; in the rest of the letter to &quot;one,&quot; which suggests to
me he is making a comparison: &quot;Please be as good to me as to he whom you
have such sympathy for and interest in.&quot; Then follows: &quot;I desire you to be
kind to--him? me?--the concealed poet.&quot; All very confusing, and I can see
that there are other possible interpretations, such as that everything that
follows &quot;can suggest to your mind to be performed...&quot; is about Bacon
himself. It may be that we will never be able to completely unravel the
meaning of the letter.

What it does tell us for sure though is that there was at least one
concealed poet in 1603, whether it was Bacon or someone else--an intriguing
piece of information, especially if &quot;Davis&quot; is really the Davies who wrote
&quot;To our English Terence,&quot; which at least some of us hold to be an ambiguous
piece of work.

Oh, please. Are we arguing about whether or not there was a successful
actor named William Shakespeare?

1) He's listed first in large type in the list of 26 &quot;principal players&quot; in
the Folio. In my opinion the prominence is due to the fact the book is
dedicated to him, not that he was a more important actor to the company
than, say, Burbage.

2) He's at the top of the first column in the &quot;principal comedians&quot; of
Jonson's &quot;Every Man in his Humour&quot;, as &quot;Will Shakespeare&quot;; &quot;Ric. Burbadge&quot;
is at the top of the second column. We don't know for sure what the billing
means. It's usually assumed to mean he played a major role, but you could
argue that it just implies prominence in the company, or gratitude for
Shakespeare's help in getting the play accepted by the company (if *that*
story is true). Be that as it may, the cast list has 10 names in it, and
&quot;Every Man ...&quot; has 17 speaking roles, as I recall, so Will was either
playing one major role or more than one secondary role.

3) He's at the top of the second column in the &quot;principal tragedians&quot; of
Jonson's &quot;Sejanus&quot; as &quot;Will. Shake-Speare&quot; (I wonder ... was Oxford
understudying for him?); &quot;Ric. Burbadge&quot; heads the first column. The
&quot;Sejanus&quot; cas list is only 8 names long and the play has over 30 speaking
roles; obviously even the significant bit players didn't rate a mention. So
again, Will must have been playing a single major role or doubling in
secondary ones. In my opinion the top of the second column business
(compare Burbage's position in &quot;Every Man ...&quot;) means he played a major role
but not the lead, but I wouldn't put much money on that proposition.

(For the record: Jonson's and the Folio list are, I believe, the ONLY cast
lists from the period of Shakespeare's probable acting career. Shakespeare
does not appear in the cast lists of Jonson's plays done by Shakespeare's
company after 1603; nor, naturally, does he appear in the cast lists of
Jonson's plays done by other companies.)

This amount of direct evidence is more than enough. But wait! There's
more!

Circumstantial, hearsay, and ambiguous evidence:

1) The reference in &quot;Groatsworth of Wit&quot; to an &quot;upstart crow beautified
with our feathers&quot; is usually thought to refer to Shakespeare as an actor.
Ambiguous but generally accepted, even by most non-Stratfordians, I believe.

2) There is credible anecdotal evidence that he played the Ghost in
&quot;Hamlet&quot; and Adam in &quot;As You Like It&quot;. If this is true, on this evidence
alone Shakespeare was at least a competent character actor. Adam is a minor
role, to be sure, but the successful presentation of the Ghost is critical
to a successful production of &quot;Hamlet&quot;; it is frequently given to a senior
member of a company. As I think I've said here before, if the audience is
laughing at the Ghost scenes, the whole production can go to hell in a
hurry.

3) John Davies's reference to his having &quot;played some kingly parts in
sport&quot; is usually taken to mean he played the kings who are secondary
characters (Burbadge would certainly have played the Richards and Macbeths).
The reference is ambiguous and has been disputed.

4) Richard Burbage and his brother Cuthbert (who was not, as far as I know,
a performer) put up the big money to form the Lord Chamberlain's Men. ALL
of the other shareholders appear to have been actors in the company. Even
those who are known to have done double duty (e.g., John Hemmings, &quot;business
manager&quot;) also acted.

I think there's more, but that's all I can dredge up at the moment.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;But such documents are not typical trial documents.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;They are as 'typical' as many trial documents.

&gt;&gt;&gt;and here i was thinking that you had expunged 'typical' from your
&gt;&gt;&gt;vocabulary.

&gt;&gt; I put it into quotes -- since it was your
&gt;&gt; word, and since its use is so commonly
&gt;&gt; abused, especially by you.

&gt; Yes, i am a notorious abuser of words and curse the day that sam johnson
&gt; decided to categorise and classify...

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Sometimes, but there is no evidence that anyone ever went out of their
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;way to destroy any documents relating to shakespeare.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;You are wrong. The Stratman's house was in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the possession of the family up to about 1665
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;-- long after he was famous. (In the 1630s a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;group of scholars in Eton agreed that he was
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;superior to any of the great classical authors.)
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;There were plenty of antiquaries who were
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;collecting the papers of famous people (such
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;as those of John Dee). Libraries were being
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;established. IF there had been any manuscripts
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;of Shakespeare for sale, there would have been
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;a ready and substantial market.

&gt;&gt;&gt;There is still no evidence of wilful destruction.

&gt;&gt; I might mention that Queen Henrietta Maria
&gt;&gt; (wife of Charles II -- who had a personal and
&gt;&gt; much-perused copy of the Folio) stayed in
&gt;&gt; New Place for several days when passing
&gt;&gt; through in 1643. Don't you think she, or her
&gt;&gt; courtiers, might have picked up a few of the
&gt;&gt; Great Bard's drafts. Or left a note, or
&gt;&gt; something -- anything?

&gt; I must confess ignorance on henrietta maria- perhaps some others can
&gt; shed some light... however i must ask- how do you know she did not leave
&gt; a note?

&gt;&gt; You believe that the Stratman was the
&gt;&gt; famous poet. What do you think is the
&gt;&gt; most likely cause of the complete absence
&gt;&gt; of any document from his hand?

&gt; Fire, plague, pestilance, time... although they do say that Sir Thomas
&gt; Moore is in his hand...

&gt;&gt; OR of
&gt;&gt; any document from any person who ever
&gt;&gt; met him?

&gt; Taht is not true the folio is from people who met him, the monument from
&gt; people who met him, folks like greene (who called him an upstart crow)
&gt; obviously knew of him...

&gt;&gt; The true reasons are that
&gt;&gt; (a) illiterate people don't usually produce
&gt;&gt; many written documents;

&gt; Yes, that is true, but you have no evidence that he was illiterate. It
&gt; is reasonable to conclude that will shakespeare went the school in
&gt; stratford.

&gt; and
&gt;&gt; (b) he had government 'minders' all his
&gt;&gt; life to ensure that he did not meet anyone
&gt;&gt; who might leave a revealing note.

&gt; He may also have been made of green cheese, but without evidence that
&gt; cannot be proven.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Who was from stratford and who was an actor.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;That's your belief.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Of course it is a belief- what else could it be?

&gt;&gt; You might have been stating what you
&gt;&gt; thought was a well-established fact.

&gt; A well established fact is still a belief.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The evidence for any part of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;it is (a) very thin; (b) flies in the face of masses
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;of contradictory evidence.

&gt;&gt;&gt;The folio says that william shakespeare was an actor in the plays.

&gt;&gt; No. It doesn't.

&gt; Does so...

&gt;&quot;The Workes of William Shakespeare,
&gt; containing all his Comedies, Histories, and
&gt; Tragedies: Truely set forth, according to their first

&gt; William Ecclestone.
&gt; Joseph Taylor.
&gt; Robert Benfield.
&gt; Robert Goughe.
&gt; Richard Robinson.
&gt; John Shancke.
&gt; John Rice.&quot;

&gt;&gt; In Ben_Jonson's Folio (of
&gt;&gt; his own complete works) he's listed at the
&gt;&gt; very top of a list of actors who are supposed
&gt;&gt; to have put on one play -- before Burbage,
&gt;&gt; etc. But that can only be a joke.

&gt; The play in jonsons folio in which shakespeare is listed first (every
&gt; man in his humour?) is a comedy. As i recall Burbage was a noted
&gt; tragedian, not comedian. In another play in jonsons folio, a tragedy,
&gt; burbage is listed first.

&gt;&gt;&gt;There is contemporary testimony to the fact.

&gt;&gt; No. There isn't.

&gt; There is I just cut and pasted it for you above (i have more if you like)

&gt;&gt;&gt;The only 'contradictory evidence' is the obsfucation of the antistrats
&gt;&gt;&gt;who would have us believe that up is down, that cats are dogs, that cold
&gt;&gt;&gt;is hot, that heaven is hell etc.

&gt;&gt; Sure. And that authors are raised by literate
&gt;&gt; parents (or guardians). What other author
&gt;&gt; (great or small) was brought up in a household
&gt;&gt; of illiterates? I ask this question regularly here,
&gt;&gt; and haven't had an answer yet.

&gt; Hesiod, Homer, Plautus (possibly- he was a slave and stage carpenter
&gt; before writing for the theatre), Caedmon (illiterate herdsman, inspired
&gt; by god to write verse), Chaucer (no evidence of schooling, born between
&gt; 1340-1344 and next heard of as a page)...

&gt; I am sure there are others too...

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I see so, the fact that the folio says shakespeare was from stratford

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;It doesn't. Its hints in that direction are
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;of the vaguest nature.

&gt;&gt;&gt;ah, obsfucation. How droll!

&gt;&gt; Where is the 'obfuscation'?

&gt; You are saying the folio is vague. I am saying tis not.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Lets talk about reasonable inference rather than slight or mere
&gt;&gt;&gt;possibility, hmmm?

&gt;&gt; Reasonable inference is

&gt;(snip)

&gt;&gt;At the end of a letter to John
&gt;&gt; Davies in 1603, Bacon signed off, &quot;so desiring you to be good to
&gt;&gt; concealed poets, I continue, Your very assured, Fr. Bacon&quot;. (You can
&gt;&gt; see a transcription of the whole letter at
&gt;&gt; http://fly.hiwaay.net/~paul/bacon/letters/davies.html  .) Baconians
&gt;&gt; assume that Bacon is referring to himself, but I don't think that's
&gt;&gt; necessarily so; he could be referring to other people who were
&gt;&gt;&quot;concealed poets&quot;. It's not a very straightforward sentence.
&gt;&gt; Dave Kathman
&gt;&gt; d ... @ix.netcom.com

&gt;It is fascinating, though, Dave. I'm surprised there isn't more interest in
&gt;this letter:

&gt;Mr. Davis,
&gt; Though you went on the sudden, yet you could not go before you had
&gt;spoken with yourself to the purpose which I will now write. And therefore I
&gt;know it shall be altogether needless, save that I meant to show you that I
&gt;am not asleep. Briefly, I commend myself to your love and to the well using
&gt;of my name, as well in repressing and answering for me, if there be any
&gt;biting or nibbling at it in that place, as in impressing a good conceit and
&gt;opinion of me, chiefly in the King (of whose favour I make myself
&gt;comfortable assurance), as otherwise in that court. And not only so, but
&gt;generally to perform to me all the good offices which the vivacity of your
&gt;wit can suggest to your mind to be performed to one, in whose affection you
&gt;have so great sympathy, and in whose fortune you have so great interest. So
&gt;desiring you to be good to concealed poets, I continue
&gt; Your very assured,
&gt; FR. BACON.
&gt; Gray's Inn, this
&gt; 28th of March, 1603.

&gt; We could try to &quot;translate&quot; it the way we do the sonnets as the entire
&gt;text is rather enigmatic, perhaps in keeping with concealment. Since the
&gt;letter itself (except for the signature) is written by one of Bacon's men,
&gt;it is unlikely, as Greg says, that Bacon is naming himself as the concealed
&gt;poet, although it's possible. There is an interesting change of pronoun
&gt;also, from the &quot;I/me&quot; in the rest of the letter to &quot;one,&quot; which suggests to
&gt;me he is making a comparison: &quot;Please be as good to me as to he whom you
&gt;have such sympathy for and interest in.&quot; Then follows: &quot;I desire you to be
&gt;kind to--him? me?--the concealed poet.&quot; All very confusing, and I can see
&gt;that there are other possible interpretations, such as that everything that
&gt;follows &quot;can suggest to your mind to be performed...&quot; is about Bacon
&gt;himself. It may be that we will never be able to completely unravel the
&gt;meaning of the letter.

&gt; What it does tell us for sure though is that there was at least one
&gt;concealed poet in 1603, whether it was Bacon or someone else--an intriguing
&gt;piece of information, especially if &quot;Davis&quot; is really the Davies who wrote
&gt;&quot;To our English Terence,&quot; which at least some of us hold to be an ambiguous
&gt;piece of work.

Consider: Tiberius was murdered (stabbed in the back) by Xeno at the
forum in broad daylight. AT least five people saw Xeno stab Tiberius
with a knife. It goes to trial. All five witnesses identify Xeno as the
killer. All attest to the fact. None are found to be visually impaired,
to have any grudge against Xeno or to be in any other way poor
witnesses. The the defence gets up: &quot;Your honour, i have circumstantial
evidence to the effect that Xeno was not in fact at the scene of the
murder at the time it was comitted. Yasmin, his neighbour thinks she may
have seen him scurrying down a dark alleyway at the time. Of course she
only saw him from behind, but he was wearing a toga, just like the toga
he usually wears.&quot; His Honour: Mr defence, we all wear togas similar in
style. Now if, you have no evidence of any substance let me put the
matter to the jury&quot;. Mr defence: &quot;Wait your honour, i also have
circumstantial evidence that Xeno is possessed of a temperament that is
at odds with him stabbing anyone&quot;. Mr Prosecution: &quot;With respect, thats
nonsense your honour, Xeno is a notoriously bad tempered brute. As you

It requires an unhealthy does of paranoia (as well as rather abysmal

questionable etiquette, perhaps reflecting on you. Not part of the

Where I live, a wolf howl is a fine thing, and with a full moon stage
light and maybe some aurora borealis for a curtain, the performance is
one to share. Bears seem to tollerate that. Requires some ability to
wonder about wolf singing without compulsion to bark at it. bookburn

Institutionalized in this world, yes indeed:

KING RICHARD: I have been studying how I may compare
This prison where I live unto the world: (Richard II, V.5)

I've been reading &quot;A Dead Man in Deptford&quot;, and Burgess portrays
Marlowe's sister Dorothy as mentally challenged. At the dinner table,
she keeps saying that God is the sun, apparently a heresy in those
days. In Rheims, after listening to a sermon, Marlowe decides that
Dorothy is probably right. She probably knows as much as anyone else
about it anyway.

She was wife of Charles I (not II) and

There is plenty of evidence that he was
illiterate: (a) the illiteracy of his parents
(obviously not 100% reliable -- but a
good indication)
(b) the illiteracy of his children (as
close to a 100% reliable indication as
you are likely to find).
c) the quality of his six 'signatures' --
the sum total of the writing we have
from his hand.
d) his inability to read the name on his
marriage licence -- it was re-issued with
the correct name the following day --
presumably after someone read it for
him.
e) the absence of a single document
from his hand, even though conditions
for such preservation were close to
ideal.
f) the absence of any of his letters
sent to anyone, in spite of the most
thorough search ever mounted in
respect of anyone.
g) the absence of books in his will, or
of any in anyone's possession at a
later date with an indication that he
had owned them.
h) the fact that he stayed in Statford
until he was into his early 20s (at least
-- in fact, he was probably there nearly
all the time, with only occasional trips

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Reasonable inference is that there is something

&gt;&gt; kept such a low profile. (But somehow these
&gt;&gt; theorists don't seem to notice that 'he' put on
&gt;&gt; a lot of plays, and published a lot of stuff.)

&gt; I recall that jonson was a catholic, was he not? It did not stop him
&gt; putting on plays and publishing.

Hey, it's not MY thesis. I'm only telling
you what's being said by Strats. I can
quote bits if you need.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Most shut their minds to all questions,
&gt;&gt; or say that it's all God's doing and it's

&gt;&gt; answers. That's the modern tradition of
&gt;&gt; western science. Strats have not yet
&gt;&gt; caught up with it, being still mired in
&gt;&gt; superstition.

&gt; If you can demonstrate that Digges, Jonson et al are a bunch of
&gt; dissembling curs, then lets hear it, if not then you are trying to
&gt; demolish a mountain wish a trowel.

"/>

They are certainly 'dissembling'. But
there is no reason to call them 'curs'.
Elizabeth was a marvellous dissembler
(as rulers often have to be). Would
you call her 'a cur'?

Jonson (and to a minor extent) Digges
were fulfilling her instructions -- and
those of James. They were usually
careful to avoid outright lies. That's
why the Folio introduction (and other
similar texts) are so curiously worded.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; All they had to do was to remove the
&gt;&gt; school's records from around 1574 (which
&gt;&gt; are -- strangely -- missing). Of course, no
&gt;&gt; one ever boasted about having taught the
&gt;&gt; great poet, nor of being at school with him.

&gt; No one boasted, at least so far as you know- but then
&gt; noone boasted about being buddies with oxford the
&gt; famous poet and writer of plays did they?

"/>

Insofar as they knew, they were expressly
forbidden to do so. That's why we get
such strange circumlocutions in letters
between Bacon and Davies mentioning
'concealed poets'.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; As for missing records, I believe that is the case with
&gt; many similar schools is it not?

"/>

It would not be a problem, except that, for
the Stratman, all useful or informative records
have disappeared.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;Oh, but we have plenty of backing for our 'strange little story',

&gt;&gt; I've scanned your post again, and somehow
&gt;&gt; I just can't see this 'backing'. Nor is it
&gt;&gt; present in any of the so-called 'biographies'.

The usual Bible-Thumping
Fundamentalist answer.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; It's probable that

&gt;&gt; a living soul in his works or in connection
&gt;&gt; with them (except for one 'dedication' to
&gt;&gt; Southampton)? And so on and on and
&gt;&gt; on . . .

&gt; Its probable that you need to look at the context of this whole dispuite
&gt; a bit more clearly- it was 400 years ago- do you expect that everything
&gt; survives 400 years perfectly intact? That time doesn't ravage things the
&gt; same way it ravages people?

Four hundred years is nothing. It was
yesterday. A mere 16 generations. It's

Well, it sounds like you want to talk about this. The novel is clearly
(very) stylized and exaggerated probably for effect, but Burgess (who
was British and not American) has Kit think the following:

&quot;The theological question is whether she has a soul to be saved. If
yes, then she shall burn for the heresy of saying God is the sun. If
no, she's dissolved into elements when she dies, like any beast of the
field.&quot; (p.39)

It does seem a bit far out, even for Marlowe who might have pondered
theological questions while he was at Cambridge, and common sense would
suggest that the girl did not know what she was saying so should not be
blamed for it (is that the same thing as saying that she doesn't have a
soul?), but the interest is in the thought process. Heresy in the
context of the above passage indicates what God will do to her when she
dies, not what the state would do, and people of the 16th century
certainly worried about salvation.

For example, isn't/wasn't there a belief that someone who is not
baptized might not be saved? I am not clear on the differences between
Catholic, Protestant, etc. on such issues during the Renaissance. Do
you have any references to recommend? It would help me to better
understand Faustus too.

&gt; Oh, please. Are we arguing about whether or not there was a successful
&gt; actor named William Shakespeare?

"/>

YES.

And TRY to get your head around the basics
of the opposition case. It's that there was a
government-sponsored cover-up.

The plays were initially written and produced
for the court (by an author who was always
careful to conceal his role), and many were
never performed in public. They needed to
be published (for obvious reasons) but the
link to the court and to the monarchy had
to be minimised. The plays and the poems
could not be published for what they were,
and needed to be put under the name of
some stooge.

The creation of a fake 'actor' was part of
the operation, and the 'evidence' within the
Folio was an integral part of this exercise.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; 1) He's listed first in large type in the list of 26 &quot;principal players&quot; in

It does not begin to register.

Anyone taken in by the name 'Will Shake-speare'
is a fool. It's manifestly the contrivance of an
Elizabethan poet -- being packed with puns,
mostly of a bawdy nature.

The probable sequence of events is that when
Richard Field was printing *Venus &amp; Adonis*
he remarked that he knew someone with a name
roughly like that of the author. The poet (and his
patron -- the Queen) thought that they needed
a living body as a cover. The illiterate fellow
agreed to cooperate, in return for being well paid.
They sent a young lawyer, Thomas Greene, to
Stratford to keep an eye on him. And then they
sent a young doctor, John Hall, as a back-up.
And that's pretty much it.

&quot;Protestant&quot; effectively means Western-but-not-Roman, and covers a world
of positions.

Christian intellectuals have a certain amount of difficulty with
&quot;Faustus&quot;, because it seems too Christian for Marlowe-the-atheist. But
assuming that Marlowe was thinking like a Christian, then:

O, I'll leap up to my God!--Who pulls me down?--
See, see, where Christ's blood streams in the firmament!
One drop would save my soul, half a drop: ah, my Christ!--

is only the flip side of:

Assume a virtue, if you have it not.
That monster, custom, who all sense doth eat,
Of habits devil, is angel yet in this,
That to the use of actions fair and good
He likewise gives a frock or livery,
That aptly is put on. Refrain to-night,
And that shall lend a kind of easiness
To the next abstinence: the next more easy;
For use almost can change the stamp of nature,
And either curb the devil, or throw him out
With wondrous potency.

Crowley,

The plays were not 'produced for the Court.' The plays were ephemera,
'toys,' written for patronage and were played first to private coteries
or at Gray's Inn. Greene makes the correct distinction between plays
written for the theatre and plays written for patronage in Groatsworth.

Some plays landed at Court, probably produced for the Queen by patrons
of the coteries like Essex and Southampton, later Pembroke for
James--but no plays were written for Elizabeth. She dismissed most of
the plays, probably because they celebrate the ancestors of Bacon's
Derby cousins (let's not forget that the actor was mysteriously
associated with Bacon's Stanley cousins well before before he arrived
in London carrying that masterpiece of university high English, the
Venus and Adonis, in his hand (according to some Strats).
Elizabeth was cousin to the Howards, not the Stanleys.
Cordially,

Elizabeth

&gt; Not an original expression, Reedy. It has a history in the
&gt; intersection of Freudian theory--or at least its dicovery by the
&gt; English middle class ca 1920--Looney discovered Freud and made the
&gt; 'psychological' Oxfordian theory--and the outburst of racist
&gt; imperialism in Britain at the time of the Shakespeare Tercentenary or
&gt; at least the Tercentenary of the First Folio. I guess the British
&gt; establishment couldn't wait another fifty years to beat dark people
&gt; over the head with a poet whose incomparable genius, not to speak of
&gt; virility and virtue (Charles Mills Gayley) derived from Anglo-Sacon
&gt; genetics (Coppelia Kahn).

&gt; Strats at Cambridge and Oxford were recruited by the British
&gt; establishment to promote the Anglo-Saxon Bard as a tool to intimidate
&gt; the colonials (Kahn)
&gt; and some were put into service to destroy the Baconians.

&gt; One couldn't have an Imperial Poet whose genius was made in an
&gt; extraordinary early childhood education on the theory of Asham's
&gt; pedagogy of 'teaching children with love.' That could give the dark
&gt; people ideas.

&gt; Quite the marriage of ideologies and it was deadly effective against
&gt; the Baconians.

&gt; So your rhetoric has historical antecedents, Reedy. Lee used it to call
&gt; Baconians 'psychopaths' and 'psychotics' in the London Times Literary
&gt; Supplement as part of the Strat campaign to destroy many distinguished
&gt; reputations.

&gt; Science has debunked Freudianism and racism but Strat racism
&gt; nevertheless lurks on in the brainless 'dimme light of nature'
&gt; assumption that an (Anglo-Saxon) genius simply acquired all knowledge
&gt; through his (genetically superior) pores.

&gt; So what's it like to be a lackey of imperialist colonialism, Reedy? I

He was married at 18 with children.

If he was going to scoot off to london and find employment then i
imagine he would have left anne at the altar.

But no, instead he decided to stay in stratford with his iwfe and
children. How incomparably boring... certainly not what we expect of our

&gt;&gt;It is reasonable to conclude that will shakespeare

&gt; No. It is not. Only a small fraction

&gt; Nearly all of them would have had
&gt; literate parents.

Interesting, seeing as the school records do not exist. You are able to
channel evidence into existence?

Shakespeares parents were reasonably well off- it is not unreasonable to
assume if they were not literate (and we don;t know that they were not)
that they desired something better for their son that they had for
themselves. Same thing happens today parents without education often
makes doubly sure that their children do get an education.

I note also that shakespeares brother was also an actor and that
literacy is a prerequisite for a successful actor.

As for your claim that nearly all the boys who went to the school in
stratford had literate parents consider that many boys who went there
had middle class backgrounds similar to shakespeare, see Kathman Here:

I don;t think a couple of 'minders' would be capable of stopping
somebody leaving a note. They would not have had to leave the note in
stratford- they could have left it anywhere.

I might add that nobody left a note revealing oxfords authorship either-
and considering that queen lizzy died 1603 and oxford 1604 well, i cna
see no reason why a revealing note should not have been left... the
major parties in the conspiracy lie dead. A new king is on the throne.

&gt;&gt;A well established fact is still a belief.

&gt; There is a difference. In one case we call

&gt; Those words function differently. The

Actually an often used definition of knoweldge (coined i think by plato)
is *justified true belief*.

So, on this account, belief is an element in knowledge.

She seems to be suggesting that stratfordianism is a racist imperialist
ideology because it supposes that the stratman, being a white anglo
saxon, learnt his art not by hard work, but by virtue of his (anglo)
genes. The fact that shakespeare was white was subsequently shoved down
coloured peoples throats as evidence of the white mans superior genetic
code (FN1).

Baconians on the other hand suppoose that bacon learnt his art not by
natures blessing, but an extraordinary education and a culture of lurve.

Strats are afraid that if it gets out that shakespeares (bacons) genius
was endowed by a culture of love, not genetics that it may give the
&quot;dark people ideas&quot; and lead, presumably, to a revolution that overturns
strat white supremecist racism.

Oh, and that you, as a representative of the strat man are covertly
representing the strat white supremecist agenda and that you, in trying
to bring her low (by questioning her theory and suggesting psychosis),
are trying to crush the life out of the last hope for humankind.

FN1:

She forgets, as usual, jonson in the folio:

Yet must I not give Nature all: Thy Art,
My gentle Shakespeare, must enjoy a part;
For though the Poets matter, Nature be,
His Art doth give the fashion. And, that he,
Who casts to write a living line, must sweat,
(Such as thine are) and strike the second heat
Upon the Muses anvile : turne the same,
(And himselfe with it) that he thinkes to frame;
Or for the lawrell, he may gaine a scorne,
For a good Poet's made, as well as borne.)

Why would the Stanleys object to that? All that toadying got them the
Derby title. The Stanleys impress me as being calculatingly detatched.
They were not committed to the Catholic party at Court, William
Stanley didn't want to be bothered with overthrowing the Queen even
when he was offered help from the Continent. William Stanley created a
bit of a stir by beating the daylights out of his wife, Oxford's eldest
daughter, for having an affair with Essex--he locked her in a dungeon
for a month-- but that was the chief excitement except for Fernado
Stanley's death for refusing to get involved with Arudel's cause. I
don't think the Stanleys would have minded the author's portrayal of
Thomas Stanley. Fernando was a friend of Bacon's until his death in
1595 so the Stanley's weren't mad.

So can you explain how the actor knew that Thomas Stanley was a
'pusillanimous time-server and toady?' Isn't that the kind of material
you get from strories your grandfather told from his time at the Court
of Henry VII? Bacon's Historie of Henry VII is still read by
historians because Bacon had much personal access to knowledge about
his subjects that doesn't appear in the record.

They're cutting the ground out from under your very feet. Shakespeare
critics (unless they're Bloom or Greenblatt) pay no attention to the
Strat bio and they don't even like your alleged author anymore. He's a
racist (Merchant), an anti-feminist (Othello) and a colonial
imperialist (The Tempest).

If they knew the author they would know that they have grossly misread
his texts because some of his best friends were Jews (Gondomar,
Florio), he wrote 'dower' into due rights because he cared about the
rights of women and he tried to prevent the imperialists from doing
what they did to North America because he saw it as the 'new eden' not

I found a possible interpretation of the sun heresy in Charles

Marlowe:

So maybe Burgess is making an oblique reference to Bruno, whom Marlowe
might have known.

&gt;&gt; context of the above passage indicates what God will do to her when
&gt;&gt; she dies, not what the state would do, and people of the 16th
&gt;&gt; century certainly worried about salvation.

&gt;&gt; For example, isn't/wasn't there a belief that someone who is not

&gt; At a minimum, someone who devoutly wishes to be baptized, but cannot
&gt; be, or someone who dies a martyr to Christ without having been
&gt; baptized, is saved.

&gt; And RCism has long maintained that virtuous pagans are saved from
&gt; Hell; their only &quot;punishment&quot; in Limbo being the knowledge that they

I had thought that Limbo was in Purgatory, but actually it is in Hell,

&gt; See, see, where Christ's blood streams in the firmament!
&gt; One drop would save my soul, half a drop: ah, my Christ!--

I looked in an archive and online and could find nothing so I am
probably wrong on that point.

&gt;&gt; It's the absence of every single such note,

He was not far off. Re-read what Ben Jonson
says. I've already referred to the famous debate
in the rooms of John Hales at Eton in the 1630s,
attended by John Suckling, Lord Falkland,
Roger Boyle and Thomas Stanley, respecting
the comparative merits of Shakespeare and the
classical poets when the decision was given
unanimously in Shakespeare's favour.

You can contrive whatever fanciful story

True -- a very suspicious tale there.
There's not a word about him being a

Then he dies, and suddenly he starts
to produce all kinds of works. That's
all in the gap after the name 'Will Shake-
speare' first appeared (in 1593), but
before it began to be attached to plays
(1598).

&gt;&gt; about the best that Strats can produce.

The other point is that Cooke -- a doctor from
Warwick, who had known John Hall and knew
the local apothecary -- somehow forgot to ask
if the Great Bard had left any papers or books.

It's not so much their absence from his will

&gt;&gt; all the time, with only occasional trips
&gt;&gt; to London). A literate person would
&gt;&gt; have found suitable employment --
&gt;&gt; probably elsewhere.

A person with the ability of a 15- or 16-

highly employable.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;It is reasonable to conclude that will shakespeare

&gt;&gt; No. It is not. Only a small fraction

&gt;&gt; Nearly all of them would have had
&gt;&gt; literate parents.

&gt; Interesting, seeing as the school records do not exist. You are able to

"/>

It's the simple facts of life. Illiterate parents
are rarely keen to send their kids to school
-- then, now, or at any other time. They never
needed that larning -- so why should the kids?
Literacy spreads SLOWLY. It's taken about
700 years to reach its present level at a very
slow steady rate. You've not fully mastered
capitals. Maybe your kids will. Or maybe
your grandchildren. These things take time.
They are not easily rushed.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Shakespeares parents were reasonably well off- it is not unreasonable to

Maybe -- it's just unlikely.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Not true. Someone once claimed to
have seen the 'evidence', but strangely
it disappeared. Like all these things,
it made a good story at the time.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; As for your claim that nearly all the boys who went to the school in
&gt; stratford had literate parents consider that many boys who went there
&gt; had middle class backgrounds similar to shakespeare, see Kathman

"/>

Like most Strats, Kathman does not
know how to use the term 'middle-
class'. It's hopelessly anachronistic
in this context. How many illiterate
middle-class people have you ever
met? Can you imagine such a person?
What job would he or she hold down?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;(b) he had government 'minders' all his

Eh? They stopped him meeting anyone
liable to leave a note. Then they also
made sure that no one printed anything.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I might add that nobody left a note revealing oxfords authorship either-

&gt;&gt; Are Strats so unaware of what's going on in Shakespeare criticism?
&gt;&gt; They're cutting the ground out from under your very feet. Shakespeare
&gt;&gt; critics (unless they're Bloom or Greenblatt) pay no attention to the

Haven't you read Elizabeth long enough to know the answer to that

She read it on an &quot;academic&quot; web site -- she will probably use her

the perishable internet and Wayback doesn't have a search function yet,
so asking Elizabeth for a source is futile.

Moreover, abundant experience shows that even on those exceedingly
rare occasions when Elizabeth actually furnishes a source, she hasn't
even read it, and it says nothing remotely like what she claimed.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I believe Gondomar was rumoured to be Jewish, but have never

Then I fear that you are barking up the wrong tree, Lynne. You

Why on Earth so complex and unbelievable an hypothesis?

The plain and obvious reading of the extract is that the &quot;mad priest of

Bruno was a heliocentrist, but he also believed (correctly) that the sun
was not the center of the universe either, but merely one star among
other stars.

And he was not a sun-worshiper in any sense. He was a Christian, though
an extremely heretical one. (Despite the claims of anti-Catholic writers

adherence to the ancient heresy of Docetism, the believe that Jesus did

Only &quot;fairly&quot; sure, Paul? This is a most welcome
step in the right direction. The ability to find such a
name within a seventy-word text is, however, what we
are actually talking about and, as I keep pointing out,
my stumbling on 'Christofer Marley' was neither
intentional nor particularly hard. The 'clue' only
started to become apparent after Terry had asked
me why the last two lines of the poem had larger
capitals at the beginning, and of course it leads to
far more than just the name.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; to find its presence indicated by a simple key to finding
&gt;&gt; it.

&gt; The 'key' you find for 'Chris Marlowe'
&gt; is not simple. It's a monstrosity.

"/>

What I found (within a coherent meaning for the poem
as a whole) was &quot;Christofer Marley&quot;. The clue consists
of seven words, each of which has an initial capital which
is of the 'wrong' size. To find the solution, one simply
assumes that the way those words are usually interpreted is
wrong, and that each of them needs to be looked at from a
rather different angle. It is the *answer* which you (and
others) find monstrous, Paul. Had it resulted in the name
*Edward de Vere*, you would have found the 'key' to it
quite brilliant - and so would I.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Other than the name itself and 'sieh all', the text for a

Only the meanings to be given to certain words were
different. The overall meaning was of course far from

&gt;&gt; supported the Copernican theory:

&gt;&gt;&gt;From Preface to Perimedes the Blacksmith, probably a reference to
&gt;&gt; Marlowe:

&gt;&gt;&quot;for that I could not make my verses jet upon the stage in tragical
&gt;&gt; buskins ..., daring God out of heaven with that atheist Tamburlan,

&gt;&gt; instances of intolerable poetry, such mad and scoffing poets that
&gt;&gt; have prophetical spirits as bred of Merlin's race.&quot; (p.203, 1995)

&gt;&gt; So maybe Burgess is making an oblique reference to Bruno, whom
Marlowe
&gt;&gt; might have known.

&gt; Why on Earth so complex and unbelievable an hypothesis?

&gt; The plain and obvious reading of the extract is that the &quot;mad priest
of
&gt; the sun&quot; is a character in a play.

"/>

I went back to Nicholl to better see his reasoning, and he discusses
Bruno for several pages. Bruno is actually a character in Faustus B,
which, when I saw your remark, is what I thought could be a
possibility, but Nicholl thinks that the scene with Bruno wasn't
written until 1600.

Nicholl's words: &quot;As far as I know, no one has found anything
in Tamburlaine, or in any other play current in 1588, to explain this
allusion.&quot;&quot;The 'mad priest of the sun' was not, I suggest, a
theatrical character.&quot; (p.206)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Bruno was a heliocentrist, but he also believed (correctly) that the
sun
&gt; was not the center of the universe either, but merely one star among
&gt; other stars.

"/>

Sounds interesting! Maybe a Renaissance Carl Sagan.
But wouldn't Renaissance thinkers be more preoccupied with the radical
idea of heliocentricity, which metaphorically makes the sun like a god?
They might not have taken at all seriously the multi-star theory
because it's so ahead of its time.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; And he was not a sun-worshiper in any sense. He was a Christian,
though
&gt; an extremely heretical one. (Despite the claims of anti-Catholic
writers
&gt; in search of a second Galileo, Bruno was in fact condemned for his
&gt; adherence to the ancient heresy of Docetism, the believe that Jesus
did
&gt; not have a physical body.)

"/>

Nicholl's interpretation of Bruno:

&quot;His version of heliocentricity was mystical, emblematic; the sun as
the divine light of truth and revelation towards which the magician
aspired. Copernicus had, in Bruno's view, only restated an ancient
magical truth. Other early Copernicans believed this too--Thomas Digges
referred to heliocentricity as a 'most ancient doctrine of the
Pythagoreans, lately revived by Copernicus' --but none expressed it
with such fervour as Bruno. He was a kind of evangelist for occultism,
and this symbolic reading of Copernican astronomy was at the core of
his message. As the great Bruno scholar Frances Yates puts it: 'the
sun-centred universe was a hieroglyph of Bruno's magical religion'.&quot;
(p.207)

He further discusses Bruno's relationship to Faustus and Marlowe in
that chapter, if you want to look into it more.

properly

<POSTDATE> 2005-01-28T12:00:00 </POSTDATE>

Mr Farey, there is nothing objective in your analysis. Consider:

From the monument you get: &quot;whose name doth deck this Tombe&quot; You take
Tombe to refer to the tombe with the inscription:

The tombe says:

&quot;Good friend for Jesus sake forbear
to dig the dust enclosed here:
Blessed be the man that spares these stones
and cursed be he that moves my bones.&quot;

Of this you say: There is only one obvious name that does 'deck' the
tomb - Jesus.

Now, it is not in fact true to say that the only name on the tombe is
jesus. If we take 'sake' from line 1 and 'spares' from line 3 and put
them together then we get: sakespare- which some could easily contend to
be a play on shakespeare.

Various anagrams of names can also be derived from the tombe. Also
consider that jesus might be taken to mean joshua etc. There are an
almost infinite variety of permutations that cna be applied to 'what
name appears on the tombe'.

SO, there is no reason to conclude that 'jesus is the only name on the
tomb.'

(There is nothing BTW in a name decking a tombe that requires it to be
'obvious'.)

You then proceed to add to your analysis of 'jesus' the lords' honorific
'christ' which does not, except by your intercession, appear on the
tombe. From here you go on to assert that 'christ' may be taken as a
reference to christofer etc.- eventually arriving at the name of your
author, chrisopher marlowe. However it is quite plain that the only
reason for adding 'christ' to 'jesus' in this context is to get to the
name 'christopher'. i.e it is circular reasoning. There is no objkective
basis in fact for adding the name 'christ' to the tombe unless it is for
the purpose of getting a particular reading out of the addition.

In summary: there is no objective basis for you to draw your conclusions
about the tomb/monument- you rely on speculative inferences that are
without any objective grounding in fact. Further you rely not just on
one speculative inference of fact, but a whole chain of them (e.g. this
word on the monument must mean this, this is capitalised, this is not,
there is no full stop here etc) such that when placed together to form
your conclusion they form a chain of inference so speculative that the
chances of the conclusion being true are close to nil.

You state in your page 'ABOUT MARLOWE AND ME' that you cannot refute the
theory that Marlowe survived deptford and wrote shakespeare etc FN1. I
suspect that your belief in this theory leads you to draw unfounded
conclusions in marlowes favour. Freud called this 'wish fulfilment'. A
starving man dreams of a succulent meal to sate his hunger, you dream
that the monument and tombe refer to Marlowe to sate your desire that
marlowe was in fact shakespeare.

Regards,

Frizer

FN1: though doubtless you cannot refute this theory because you prefer
possibilities over probabilities.

&gt;&gt;&gt; they are rigorously applied they produce a plain text
&gt;&gt;&gt; which is really a text,

&gt;&gt;The 'text' that you produce is far from
&gt;&gt;what the Friedmans would regard as
&gt;&gt;'plain text'.

&gt; Other than the name itself and 'sieh all', the text for a
&gt; Jacobean solver would have remained just as it was.
&gt; Only the meanings to be given to certain words were
&gt; different. The overall meaning was of course far from
&gt; 'plain', but if it had been any plainer it wouldn't have been
&gt; much of a puzzle, would it? Once solved, however, the
&gt; meaning is certainly clear enough to have satisfied the
&gt; Friedmans' requirements.

&gt;&gt;&gt; he can begin to take himself
&gt;&gt;&gt; seriously.

&gt;&gt;Sorry, but you have not reached this
&gt;&gt;stage. You should not take yourself
&gt;&gt;seriously.

&gt; Oh Lor. Coffee spluttered all over the monitor again.
&gt; You would think I'd know by now.

&gt;&gt;&gt; The point must be reached where he begins
&gt;&gt;&gt; to feel that the whole thing did not and could not
&gt;&gt;&gt; happen by accident.

&gt;&gt;I didn't read Terry Ross's posts about
&gt;&gt;your 'decryption' -- but I'm sure that
&gt;&gt;the Friedmans have covered the kinds
&gt;&gt;of methods of self-deception which
&gt;&gt;you have employed.

&gt; Maybe they have. Now all you have to do is to point
&gt; out a specific example of this 'self-deception' to me so
&gt; that we can check.

&gt;&gt;&gt; But it is not simply a matter of
&gt;&gt;&gt; his feeling this; the assessment can be far more rigorous.
&gt;&gt;&gt; The mathematical theory of probability can be applied,
&gt;&gt;&gt; and the chances calculated exactly. If the cryptanalyst
&gt;&gt;&gt; finds a certain key and (on the basis of the way it is
&gt;&gt;&gt; built up) he calculates that the chances of its appearing
&gt;&gt;&gt; by accident are one in one thousand million, his
&gt;&gt;&gt; confidence in the solution will be more than justified.&quot;

&gt;&gt;The maths are irrelevant when the
&gt;&gt;whole 'solution' is as contrived as
&gt;&gt;yours.

&gt; Cart before the horse, Paul. It is the *probability* of
&gt; the clue occurring by chance which determines whether
&gt; or not the solution *is* 'contrived'. Your opinion on
&gt; the subject is irrelevant.

&gt;&gt;Give this 'puzzle' to 1,000 cryptanalysts
&gt;&gt;at that place in Cheltenham. Tell them
&gt;&gt;that there's name in there somewhere.
&gt;&gt;How many 'solutions' would they come
&gt;&gt;up with that were at least as 'good' as
&gt;&gt;yours, and that weren't 'Chris Marlowe'?

&gt; I have no idea. Nor have you.
&gt; But it sounds like fun.

&gt; Mr Farey, there is nothing objective in your analysis. Consider:

&gt; The tombe says:

&gt;&quot;Good friend for Jesus sake forbear
&gt; to dig the dust enclosed here:
&gt; Blessed be the man that spares these stones
&gt; and cursed be he that moves my bones.&quot;

&gt; Of this you say: There is only one obvious name that does 'deck' the
&gt; tomb - Jesus.

&gt; Now, it is not in fact true to say that the only name on the tombe is
&gt; jesus. If we take 'sake' from line 1 and 'spares' from line 3 and put
&gt; them together then we get: sakespare- which some could easily contend to
&gt; be a play on shakespeare.

&gt; Various anagrams of names can also be derived from the tombe. Also
&gt; consider that jesus might be taken to mean joshua etc. There are an
&gt; almost infinite variety of permutations that cna be applied to 'what
&gt; name appears on the tombe'.

&gt; SO, there is no reason to conclude that 'jesus is the only name on the
&gt; tomb.'

&gt; (There is nothing BTW in a name decking a tombe that requires it to be
&gt; 'obvious'.)

&gt; You then proceed to add to your analysis of 'jesus' the lords' honorific
&gt; 'christ' which does not, except by your intercession, appear on the
&gt; tombe. From here you go on to assert that 'christ' may be taken as a
&gt; reference to christofer etc.- eventually arriving at the name of your
&gt; author, chrisopher marlowe. However it is quite plain that the only
&gt; reason for adding 'christ' to 'jesus' in this context is to get to the
&gt; name 'christopher'. i.e it is circular reasoning. There is no objkective
&gt; basis in fact for adding the name 'christ' to the tombe unless it is for
&gt; the purpose of getting a particular reading out of the addition.

&gt; In summary: there is no objective basis for you to draw your conclusions
&gt; about the tomb/monument- you rely on speculative inferences that are
&gt; without any objective grounding in fact. Further you rely not just on
&gt; one speculative inference of fact, but a whole chain of them (e.g. this
&gt; word on the monument must mean this, this is capitalised, this is not,
&gt; there is no full stop here etc) such that when placed together to form
&gt; your conclusion they form a chain of inference so speculative that the
&gt; chances of the conclusion being true are close to nil.

"/>

(I should clarify- i think that the probability of any of your
inferences, re: the tomb/monument, being true are close to nil. So when
all your arguments are placed together in a chain there is even less
chance of them all being true)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; You state in your page 'ABOUT MARLOWE AND ME' that you cannot refute the

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The fact that you said in another post &quot;It's about as
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; impressive as figuring the odds against your name being
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Bob Grumman instead of the millions of other names

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; you don't.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I'd be fairly sure that if you put in about
&gt;&gt;&gt; the same amount of work, you'd be able
&gt;&gt;&gt; to derive a roughly similar 'key' for &quot;Bob
&gt;&gt;&gt; Grumman&quot; -- or for any other fairly
&gt;&gt;&gt; straightforward name.

&gt;&gt; Only &quot;fairly&quot; sure, Paul? This is a most welcome
&gt;&gt; step in the right direction. The ability to find such a
&gt;&gt; name within a seventy-word text is, however, what we
&gt;&gt; are actually talking about and, as I keep pointing out,
&gt;&gt; my stumbling on 'Christofer Marley' was neither
&gt;&gt; intentional nor particularly hard. The 'clue' only
&gt;&gt; started to become apparent after Terry had asked
&gt;&gt; me why the last two lines of the poem had larger
&gt;&gt; capitals at the beginning, and of course it leads to
&gt;&gt; far more than just the name.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; What you must understand is that it is not the probability
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of the (or an) *answer* occurring that is being given here,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; but the probability of the occurrence of the *clue* to its
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; discovery. It would be *possible* to find the name Bob
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Grumman on every page of Shakespeare, for example, but
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; it would be very difficult - probably almost impossible -
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to find its presence indicated by a simple key to finding
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; it.

&gt;&gt;&gt; The 'key' you find for 'Chris Marlowe'
&gt;&gt;&gt; is not simple. It's a monstrosity.

&gt;&gt; What I found (within a coherent meaning for the poem
&gt;&gt; as a whole) was &quot;Christofer Marley&quot;. The clue consists
&gt;&gt; of seven words, each of which has an initial capital which
&gt;&gt; is of the 'wrong' size. To find the solution, one simply
&gt;&gt; assumes that the way those words are usually interpreted is
&gt;&gt; wrong, and that each of them needs to be looked at from a
&gt;&gt; rather different angle. It is the *answer* which you (and
&gt;&gt; others) find monstrous, Paul. Had it resulted in the name
&gt;&gt; *Edward de Vere*, you would have found the 'key' to it
&gt;&gt; quite brilliant - and so would I.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Notice that it is the *key* that is the important bit as
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; far as the Friedmans were concerned in determining the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; probability of a message hidden in the form of a cipher
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; being valid. I have simply applied this approach to the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; clue which I say leads to the message hidden in the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; epigraph. This is what they say about the cryptanalyst's
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; task:

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;quote)

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;But if there is rhyme and reason about the way he has
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; reached the solution, if the system really is a rational
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and consistent system

&gt;&gt;&gt; There is little rational and nothing
&gt;&gt;&gt; consistent about your 'system'.
&gt;&gt;&gt; It has no rhyme and little reason.

&gt;&gt; Thank you for your opinion. Any irrationality or inconsistency
&gt;&gt; you care to point out will be gratefully noted.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the keys really keys

&gt;&gt;&gt; Your 'keys' are not really keys.

&gt;&gt; It's a clue. And it works. As I said, see
&gt;&gt; http://www2.prestel.co.uk/rey/riddle.htm

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and if when
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; they are rigorously applied they produce a plain text
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; which is really a text,

&gt;&gt;&gt; The 'text' that you produce is far from

A statement which gives me a pretty clear idea of just
how 'objective' your comments upon it are likely to be!

The original essay on my site still includes much of how
I happened to stumble on the answer, but is not the way
in which I now think that the puzzle was meant to be
solved, which should obviously make use of what I call
the *clue* to its solution.

If they were desperate enough, I guess. But would you
call this an 'obvious name'? I wouldn't.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

"/>

No doubt. And how many of them would you describe as
'obvious'? 'Obvious' in the way that the name 'IESUS'
is, for example?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Also consider that jesus might be taken to mean joshua
&gt; etc.

"/>

Indeed. And if they had had Roget's Thesaurus handy, they
might also have found

&quot;God the Son, Jesus, Christ; The Messiah, The Anointed,
The Saviour, the Redeemer, The Mediator, The Intercessor,
The Advocate, The Judge; The Son of God, The Son of Man,
The Son of David; The Lamb of God, The Word; Logos;
Emmanuel; Immanuel; The King of Kings and Lord of Lords,
The King of Glory, The Prince of Peace, The Good Shepherd,
The Way, The Truth, The Life, The Bread of Life, The
Light of the World; The Lord, The Sun of Righteousness;
...The Incarnation, The Hypostatic Union.&quot;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; There are an almost infinite variety of permutations
&gt; that can be applied to 'what name appears on the tombe'.

"/>

What I said is as you quoted it, that &quot;There is only one
obvious name&quot;, and I'm sorry, but the only *obvious* name
is 'Jesus'. Where you are correct, however, is that there
are many possible answers to *whose* name that is - for
example those listed above.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; SO, there is no reason to conclude that 'jesus is the
&gt; only name on the tomb.'

Which is not, as I hope you now recognize, what I said.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; (There is nothing BTW in a name decking a tombe that
&gt; requires it to be 'obvious'.)

"/>

I see, so if you are right about it referring to the
*monument* then it could just as well mean some name
which is *hidden* there rather than the obvious one
&quot;Shakspeare&quot;. Interesting!

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; You then proceed to add to your analysis of 'jesus' the
&gt; lords' honorific 'christ' which does not, except by your
&gt; intercession, appear on the tombe.

"/>

Here's an example of a similar type of puzzle from the
same period (a dreadful one, but it will serve):

The enemy to the stomach and the word of disgrace
Is the name of the gentleman with a bold face.

The answer is &quot;Raleigh&quot; made up of the words 'raw' and
'lie'. You will notice, I am sure, that neither of
these words appear in it, and are only found by the
'intercession' of the solver. That's how such puzzles
work.

Another point worth making while we are talking about
this is that &quot;there are an almost infinite number of
permutations&quot; which could be found from this clue as
well. But this does not stop it being a genuine puzzle,
does it? In fact it is having to choose from among
such a variety that makes it a puzzle in the first
place.

Nor would it prove that it's not a puzzle if more than
one answer could be found (say &quot;Sackvile&quot; or &quot;Achely&quot;).
The trick is to find which answer best fits the clues,
not to establish that it is the only one possible.
On the other hand, *Christofer Marley* does happen
to be the only name that I have been able to derive from
the clause &quot;whose name, doth deck this Tombe, Far more,
then cost&quot;. If you can find another, please tell me.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; From here you go on to assert that 'christ' may be
&gt; taken as a reference to christofer etc.

"/>

If I 'assert' anything, it is that there are several
names beginning with the word 'Christ', of which
Christopher is but one. I listed all of those I could
think of. Did I miss any?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; - eventually arriving at the name of your author,
&gt; chrisopher marlowe. However it is quite plain that
&gt; the only reason for adding 'christ' to 'jesus' in
&gt; this context is to get to the name 'christopher'.
&gt; i.e it is circular reasoning. There is no objective
&gt; basis in fact for adding the name 'christ' to the
&gt; tombe unless it is for the purpose of getting a
&gt; particular reading out of the addition.

"/>

Forgive me, but you are wrong. The process is to keep
on trying until a name making some sort of sense is
found. I started with 'Christ' for two reasons. One,
because it is the word I (like Roget) most closely
associate with the name Jesus. Two, because, as you
say, I tend to have Marlowe more on my mind than most
people do. It would make no difference, however, if I
had started at the other end of that list, because I
do not believe that any of the others lead to a name
at all (other than the name Jesus itself, which Terry
Ross suggested) let alone one that might make some
sort of sense in this context. If I am wrong, then
please show me.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; In summary: there is no objective basis for you to
&gt; draw your conclusions about the tomb/monument- you
&gt; rely on speculative inferences that are without any
&gt; objective grounding in fact.

"/>

What I do is what people do when they solve puzzles
like this: they look at as many options as they can
find until they get a combination that appears to
provide an answer that the puzzle-setter would have
most probably intended.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Further you rely not just on one speculative infer-
&gt; ence of fact, but a whole chain of them (e.g. this
&gt; word on the monument must mean this, this is capit-
&gt; alised, this is not, there is no full stop here etc)
&gt; such that when placed together to form your conclusion
&gt; they form a chain of inference so speculative that the
&gt; chances of the conclusion being true are close to nil.

&gt; (I should clarify- i think that the probability of any
&gt; of your inferences, re: the tomb/monument, being true
&gt; are close to nil. So when all your arguments are
&gt; placed together in a chain there is even less chance
&gt; of them all being true)

On the contrary. It is the probability of the hidden
message having occurred by chance that is close to nil,
as my essay at

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; that you cannot refute the theory that Marlowe survived

&gt; fulfilment'. A starving man dreams of a succulent meal
&gt; to sate his hunger, you dream that the monument and
&gt; tombe refer to Marlowe to sate your desire that marlowe
&gt; was in fact shakespeare.

"/>

I am no less subject to this human characteristic than
anyone, I guess, although I reject your assumption that
I *want* Marlowe to be Shakespeare. What I want is to
know the truth behind the works. At the moment this
appears to me to be that Marlowe survived and played a
major part in writing them. But if the monument had
given me a different name as clearly as it has revealed
Marlowe, I would have been perfectly happy to rethink
my position.

What I would say is that, being fully aware that people
tend to see what they want to see, I probably work harder
than just about anyone posting here to overcome that
particular hazard.

One comment I would like to make on this line of argument,
however. Even if I were guilty of having set out to find
Marlowe's name in the monument (which I strongly deny,
but *if* I were) it need make no difference at all to the
validity of what I found. I have just been reading in Bill
Bryson's *A Short History of Just About Everything* of your
Aussie neighbor, Rev. Bob Evans, who is a world expert in
discovering supernovae. Does the fact that he is *looking*
for them mean that his discoveries are suspect? Sure it
does, which is why he must take steps to validate what he
has found - just as I have done. Odds of over a thousand
million to one tell me that I'm probably right.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Regards,

&gt; Frizer

&gt; FN1: though doubtless you cannot refute this theory
&gt; because you prefer possibilities over probabilities.

"/>

What a strange comment. I use both. Possibilities have
to be the starting point for solving puzzles like this,
probability has to be used in assessing the validity of
what is found. And there are few here who use the concept
of probability as much as I do in validating my theories,
I assure you.

Okay, I've now read your article, Peter. Was annoyed by your saying
that Jesus is the only sensible person &quot;whose name&quot; can refer to since
the only sensible person it can refer to is Shakespeare, the man in the
tomb the monument was part of, or thought by the author of the
inscription to be part of.

Found nothing new except the further ingenuity of 53 is 23, which only
demonstrates to me that given time, any clever message finder can make
anything in any text feed into his belief system. Oh, and your reading
of &quot;dissolves&quot; to bring Digges into your conspiracy theory. All these
clues that absolutely no one saw until you--and that no one could
conceivably have found unless he already &quot;knew&quot; . . . The Truth.

Now do the Latin, Peter. I suggest you consider who the THREE people
Shakespeare is said to be are. Marlowe, Shakespeare and the
go-between.

&gt; Nicholl's interpretation of Bruno:

&gt; referred to heliocentricity as a 'most ancient doctrine of the
&gt; Pythagoreans, lately revived by Copernicus' --but none expressed it
&gt; with such fervour as Bruno. He was a kind of evangelist for occultism,
&gt; and this symbolic reading of Copernican astronomy was at the core of
&gt; his message. As the great Bruno scholar Frances Yates puts it: 'the
&gt; sun-centred universe was a hieroglyph of Bruno's magical religion'.&quot;

&gt;&gt; Mr Farey, there is nothing objective in your analysis. Consider:

&gt;&gt; The tombe says:

&gt;&gt;&quot;Good friend for Jesus sake forbear

&gt;&gt; Of this you say: There is only one obvious name that does 'deck' the

&gt;&gt; Now, it is not in fact true to say that the only name on the tombe is
&gt;&gt; jesus. If we take 'sake' from line 1 and 'spares' from line 3 and put
&gt;&gt; them together then we get: sakespare- which some could easily contend to
&gt;&gt; be a play on shakespeare.

"/>

Good God, Frizer, talk about a stretch.

By the way, have you called yourself Frizer in memory of Marlowe?

Regards,
Lynne

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; Various anagrams of names can also be derived from the tombe. Also
&gt;&gt; consider that jesus might be taken to mean joshua etc. There are an
&gt;&gt; almost infinite variety of permutations that cna be applied to 'what
&gt;&gt; name appears on the tombe'.

&gt;&gt; SO, there is no reason to conclude that 'jesus is the only name on the
&gt;&gt; tomb.'

&gt;&gt; (There is nothing BTW in a name decking a tombe that requires it to be
&gt;&gt; 'obvious'.)

&gt;&gt; You then proceed to add to your analysis of 'jesus' the lords' honorific
&gt;&gt; 'christ' which does not, except by your intercession, appear on the
&gt;&gt; tombe. From here you go on to assert that 'christ' may be taken as a
&gt;&gt; reference to christofer etc.- eventually arriving at the name of your
&gt;&gt; author, chrisopher marlowe. However it is quite plain that the only
&gt;&gt; reason for adding 'christ' to 'jesus' in this context is to get to the
&gt;&gt; name 'christopher'. i.e it is circular reasoning. There is no objkective
&gt;&gt; basis in fact for adding the name 'christ' to the tombe unless it is for
&gt;&gt; the purpose of getting a particular reading out of the addition.

&gt;&gt; In summary: there is no objective basis for you to draw your conclusions
&gt;&gt; about the tomb/monument- you rely on speculative inferences that are
&gt;&gt; without any objective grounding in fact. Further you rely not just on
&gt;&gt; one speculative inference of fact, but a whole chain of them (e.g. this
&gt;&gt; word on the monument must mean this, this is capitalised, this is not,
&gt;&gt; there is no full stop here etc) such that when placed together to form
&gt;&gt; your conclusion they form a chain of inference so speculative that the
&gt;&gt; chances of the conclusion being true are close to nil.

&gt; (I should clarify- i think that the probability of any of your
&gt; inferences, re: the tomb/monument, being true are close to nil. So when
&gt; all your arguments are placed together in a chain there is even less
&gt; chance of them all being true)

&gt;&gt; You state in your page 'ABOUT MARLOWE AND ME' that you cannot refute the
&gt;&gt; theory that Marlowe survived deptford and wrote shakespeare etc FN1. I
&gt;&gt; suspect that your belief in this theory leads you to draw unfounded
&gt;&gt; conclusions in marlowes favour. Freud called this 'wish fulfilment'. A
&gt;&gt; starving man dreams of a succulent meal to sate his hunger, you dream
&gt;&gt; that the monument and tombe refer to Marlowe to sate your desire that
&gt;&gt; marlowe was in fact shakespeare.

&gt;&gt; Regards,

&gt;&gt; Frizer

&gt;&gt; FN1: though doubtless you cannot refute this theory because you prefer
&gt;&gt; possibilities over probabilities.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; impressive as figuring the odds against your name being
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Bob Grumman instead of the millions of other names

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; you don't.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I'd be fairly sure that if you put in about
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the same amount of work, you'd be able
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to derive a roughly similar 'key' for &quot;Bob
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Grumman&quot; -- or for any other fairly
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; straightforward name.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Only &quot;fairly&quot; sure, Paul? This is a most welcome
&gt;&gt;&gt; step in the right direction. The ability to find such a
&gt;&gt;&gt; name within a seventy-word text is, however, what we
&gt;&gt;&gt; are actually talking about and, as I keep pointing out,
&gt;&gt;&gt; my stumbling on 'Christofer Marley' was neither
&gt;&gt;&gt; intentional nor particularly hard. The 'clue' only
&gt;&gt;&gt; started to become apparent after Terry had asked
&gt;&gt;&gt; me why the last two lines of the poem had larger
&gt;&gt;&gt; capitals at the beginning, and of course it leads to
&gt;&gt;&gt; far more than just the name.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; What you must understand is that it is not the probability
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of the (or an) *answer* occurring that is being given here,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; but the probability of the occurrence of the *clue* to its
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; discovery. It would be *possible* to find the name Bob
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Grumman on every page of Shakespeare, for example, but
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; it would be very difficult - probably almost impossible -
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to find its presence indicated by a simple key to finding
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; it.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The 'key' you find for 'Chris Marlowe'
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; is not simple. It's a monstrosity.

&gt;&gt;&gt; What I found (within a coherent meaning for the poem
&gt;&gt;&gt; as a whole) was &quot;Christofer Marley&quot;. The clue consists
&gt;&gt;&gt; of seven words, each of which has an initial capital which
&gt;&gt;&gt; is of the 'wrong' size. To find the solution, one simply
&gt;&gt;&gt; assumes that the way those words are usually interpreted is
&gt;&gt;&gt; wrong, and that each of them needs to be looked at from a
&gt;&gt;&gt; rather different angle. It is the *answer* which you (and
&gt;&gt;&gt; others) find monstrous, Paul. Had it resulted in the name
&gt;&gt;&gt; *Edward de Vere*, you would have found the 'key' to it
&gt;&gt;&gt; quite brilliant - and so would I.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Notice that it is the *key* that is the important bit as
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; far as the Friedmans were concerned in determining the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; probability of a message hidden in the form of a cipher
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; being valid. I have simply applied this approach to the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; clue which I say leads to the message hidden in the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; epigraph. This is what they say about the cryptanalyst's
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; task:

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;quote)

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;But if there is rhyme and reason about the way he has
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; reached the solution, if the system really is a rational
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and consistent system

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; There is little rational and nothing
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; consistent about your 'system'.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It has no rhyme and little reason.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Thank you for your opinion. Any irrationality or inconsistency
&gt;&gt;&gt; you care to point out will be gratefully noted.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the keys really keys

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Your 'keys' are not really keys.

&gt;&gt;&gt; It's a clue. And it works. As I said, see
&gt;&gt;&gt; http://www2.prestel.co.uk/rey/riddle.htm

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and if when
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; they are rigorously applied they produce a plain text
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; which is really a text,

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The 'text' that you produce is far from
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; what the Friedmans would regard as
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 'plain text'.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Other than the name itself and 'sieh all', the text for a
&gt;&gt;&gt; Jacobean solver would have remained just as it was.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Only the meanings to be given to certain words were
&gt;&gt;&gt; different. The overall meaning was of course far from
&gt;&gt;&gt; 'plain', but if it had been any plainer it wouldn't have been
&gt;&gt;&gt; much of a puzzle, would it? Once solved, however, the
&gt;&gt;&gt; meaning is certainly clear enough to have satisfied the
&gt;&gt;&gt; Friedmans' requirements.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; he can begin to take himself
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; seriously.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Sorry, but you have not reached this
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; stage. You should not take yourself
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; seriously.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Oh Lor. Coffee spluttered all over the monitor again.
&gt;&gt;&gt; You would think I'd know by now.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The point must be reached where he begins
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to feel that the whole thing did not and could not
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; happen by accident.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I didn't read Terry Ross's posts about
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; your 'decryption' -- but I'm sure that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the Friedmans have covered the kinds
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of methods of self-deception which
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; you have employed.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Maybe they have. Now all you have to do is to point
&gt;&gt;&gt; out a specific example of this 'self-deception' to me so
&gt;&gt;&gt; that we can check.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; But it is not simply a matter of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; his feeling this; the assessment can be far more rigorous.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The mathematical theory of probability can be applied,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and the chances calculated exactly. If the cryptanalyst
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; finds a certain key and (on the basis of the way it is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; built up) he calculates that the chances of its appearing
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; by accident are one in one thousand million, his
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; confidence in the solution will be more than justified.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The maths are irrelevant when the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; whole 'solution' is as contrived as
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; yours.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Cart before the horse, Paul. It is the *probability* of
&gt;&gt;&gt; the clue occurring by chance which determines whether
&gt;&gt;&gt; or not the solution *is* 'contrived'. Your opinion on
&gt;&gt;&gt; the subject is irrelevant.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Give this 'puzzle' to 1,000 cryptanalysts
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; at that place in Cheltenham. Tell them
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that there's name in there somewhere.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; How many 'solutions' would they come
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; up with that were at least as 'good' as
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; yours, and that weren't 'Chris Marlowe'?

&gt;&gt;&gt;It's the absence of every single such note,
&gt;&gt;&gt;when there should have been thousands,
&gt;&gt;&gt;that is the problem.

&gt;&gt;Shakespeare wasn't the demigod in 1616 that he is today.

&gt; He was not far off. Re-read what Ben Jonson
&gt; says. I've already referred to the famous debate
&gt; in the rooms of John Hales at Eton in the 1630s,
&gt; attended by John Suckling, Lord Falkland,
&gt; Roger Boyle and Thomas Stanley, respecting
&gt; the comparative merits of Shakespeare and the
&gt; classical poets when the decision was given
&gt; unanimously in Shakespeare's favour.
&gt; (Gildon, Miscellany letters &amp; Essays, 1694, pp 85-86)

"/>

Shakespeare is said in the Gildon piece to have 'many enemies'. His
enemies criticised him for his failure to preserve the classicial forms.
Despite this failing his worked was judged superior to the classical
poets. This decision was made unanimously by the elected judges.

Note:
(1) This was a debate in the rooms of John Hales at Eton. This does not
suggest to me that shakespeare had a high profile among the common
population. It shows only that shakespeare had an esteemed profile
amonst a select group of scholars.

(2) Shakespeare is said to have many enemies. That is, he was not almost
universally acclaimed.

(3) decision was given unanimously by the judges, not by the participants

As to what Jonson says, how many others have had their praises sung only
to sink into obscurity?

In any case, I am not denying that shakespeare was not well esteemed by
some in england in 1630, what i am denying is that he was the subject of
the almost universal acclaim that he wins today. 400 odd years after his
death he is said to be the greatest writer who ever lived, the greatest
genius who ever lived, is taught in schools, his plays unlike almost any
other from his era are constantly revived and adapted to the screen.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;You believe that the Stratman was the

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;of any document from his hand?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Fire

&gt;&gt;&gt;New Place never had a fire.

&gt;&gt;Aye, but who says the documentrs were in new place? They could easily
&gt;&gt;have been taken by his friends to london and destroyed in the great fire.

&gt; You can contrive whatever fanciful story
&gt; you like. Keep on twisting and turning to
&gt; get it to fit the facts, as they are brought
&gt; up. Nothing can explain the absence of
&gt; records throughout the nation that should
&gt; exist -- in hundreds or thousands of
&gt; locations.

"/>

Mr Crowley I am not twisting or contriving anything. I am making the
point that not every historical document survives and that there are
many different reasons why that is so. Shakespeare is no different from
almost every other author of the period- kyd, marlowe, lyly etc.

If you required the same standard of proof of every other author that
you require of shakespeare then there would be no elizabethan authors
because we could not muster enough evidence for any of them.

There is plenty of documentation that shakespeare was from stratford
etc. It is just that you choose, groundlessly, to reject it.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;But they do cause people to die. When people die, then documents that
&gt;&gt;they considered valuable (such as eg shakespeare manuscripts) may not be
&gt;&gt;considered valuable by their next of kin and can be put on the fire or
&gt;&gt;used to line a cake tin or to wipe ones arse, as the case may be.

&gt; The name of 'Shakespeare' was famous
&gt; throughout the land. No one would have
&gt; thrown away a document with his name
&gt; on it. They could have sold it for good
&gt; money.

"/>

Assuming that they knew what the document was. Loss of document through
ignorance is not unheard of for instance one- of Marlowes lost plays was
used to line a baking tin. Same thing happens today (which is the
information age) with tapes of famous bands being thrown in the rubbish
or sold at grage sales for ridiculously cheap prices because the seller
doesn;t know what it is (i am thinking of a lost beatles tape).

&gt;&gt;&gt;There is no reason (under the Strat scenario)

&gt;&gt;But is there a reason why is *should* have been put in print?

&gt; Yes. It would have sold and made

His plays were put in print and sold as the folio. I am not sure what

&gt; to produce all kinds of works. That's

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;&gt;There is plenty of evidence that he was
&gt;&gt;&gt;illiterate: (a) the illiteracy of his parents
&gt;&gt;&gt;(obviously not 100% reliable -- but a
&gt;&gt;&gt;good indication)

&gt;&gt;Except there was a school in stratford that we cna reasonably infer that
&gt;&gt;he went to. As for the records of attendance being lost, that is not

&gt; There were schools and illiterate people
&gt; in most parts of the country. And the
&gt; same was true for the previous 300 years

But as i say the mere fact that there are no school records does not
mean that we cannot infer that shakespeare went to the school and that
he received there a good education- as is evidenced by the performance

previously noted).

&gt;&gt;&gt;Of this you say: There is only one obvious name that does 'deck' the
&gt;&gt;&gt;tomb - Jesus.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Now, it is not in fact true to say that the only name on the tombe is
&gt;&gt;&gt;jesus. If we take 'sake' from line 1 and 'spares' from line 3 and put
&gt;&gt;&gt;them together then we get: sakespare- which some could easily contend to
&gt;&gt;&gt;be a play on shakespeare.

&gt; Good God, Frizer, talk about a stretch.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Various anagrams of names can also be derived from the tombe. Also
&gt;&gt;&gt;consider that jesus might be taken to mean joshua etc. There are an
&gt;&gt;&gt;almost infinite variety of permutations that cna be applied to 'what
&gt;&gt;&gt;name appears on the tombe'.

&gt;&gt;&gt;SO, there is no reason to conclude that 'jesus is the only name on the
&gt;&gt;&gt;tomb.'

&gt;&gt;&gt;(There is nothing BTW in a name decking a tombe that requires it to be
&gt;&gt;&gt;'obvious'.)

&gt;&gt;&gt;You then proceed to add to your analysis of 'jesus' the lords' honorific
&gt;&gt;&gt;'christ' which does not, except by your intercession, appear on the
&gt;&gt;&gt;tombe. From here you go on to assert that 'christ' may be taken as a
&gt;&gt;&gt;reference to christofer etc.- eventually arriving at the name of your
&gt;&gt;&gt;author, chrisopher marlowe. However it is quite plain that the only
&gt;&gt;&gt;reason for adding 'christ' to 'jesus' in this context is to get to the
&gt;&gt;&gt;name 'christopher'. i.e it is circular reasoning. There is no objkective
&gt;&gt;&gt;basis in fact for adding the name 'christ' to the tombe unless it is for
&gt;&gt;&gt;the purpose of getting a particular reading out of the addition.

&gt;&gt;&gt;In summary: there is no objective basis for you to draw your conclusions
&gt;&gt;&gt;about the tomb/monument- you rely on speculative inferences that are
&gt;&gt;&gt;without any objective grounding in fact. Further you rely not just on
&gt;&gt;&gt;one speculative inference of fact, but a whole chain of them (e.g. this
&gt;&gt;&gt;word on the monument must mean this, this is capitalised, this is not,
&gt;&gt;&gt;there is no full stop here etc) such that when placed together to form
&gt;&gt;&gt;your conclusion they form a chain of inference so speculative that the
&gt;&gt;&gt;chances of the conclusion being true are close to nil.

&gt;&gt;(I should clarify- i think that the probability of any of your
&gt;&gt;inferences, re: the tomb/monument, being true are close to nil. So when
&gt;&gt;all your arguments are placed together in a chain there is even less
&gt;&gt;chance of them all being true)

&gt;&gt;&gt;You state in your page 'ABOUT MARLOWE AND ME' that you cannot refute the
&gt;&gt;&gt;theory that Marlowe survived deptford and wrote shakespeare etc FN1. I
&gt;&gt;&gt;suspect that your belief in this theory leads you to draw unfounded
&gt;&gt;&gt;conclusions in marlowes favour. Freud called this 'wish fulfilment'. A
&gt;&gt;&gt;starving man dreams of a succulent meal to sate his hunger, you dream
&gt;&gt;&gt;that the monument and tombe refer to Marlowe to sate your desire that
&gt;&gt;&gt;marlowe was in fact shakespeare.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Regards,

&gt;&gt;&gt;Frizer

&gt;&gt;&gt;FN1: though doubtless you cannot refute this theory because you prefer
&gt;&gt;&gt;possibilities over probabilities.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The fact that you said in another post &quot;It's about as
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;impressive as figuring the odds against your name being
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Bob Grumman instead of the millions of other names

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;you don't.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I'd be fairly sure that if you put in about
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the same amount of work, you'd be able
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;to derive a roughly similar 'key' for &quot;Bob
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Grumman&quot; -- or for any other fairly
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;straightforward name.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Only &quot;fairly&quot; sure, Paul? This is a most welcome
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;step in the right direction. The ability to find such a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;name within a seventy-word text is, however, what we
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;are actually talking about and, as I keep pointing out,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;my stumbling on 'Christofer Marley' was neither
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;intentional nor particularly hard. The 'clue' only
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;started to become apparent after Terry had asked
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;me why the last two lines of the poem had larger
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;capitals at the beginning, and of course it leads to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;far more than just the name.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;What you must understand is that it is not the probability
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;of the (or an) *answer* occurring that is being given here,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;but the probability of the occurrence of the *clue* to its
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;discovery. It would be *possible* to find the name Bob
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Grumman on every page of Shakespeare, for example, but
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;it would be very difficult - probably almost impossible -
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;to find its presence indicated by a simple key to finding
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;it.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The 'key' you find for 'Chris Marlowe'
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;is not simple. It's a monstrosity.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;What I found (within a coherent meaning for the poem
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;as a whole) was &quot;Christofer Marley&quot;. The clue consists
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;of seven words, each of which has an initial capital which
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;is of the 'wrong' size. To find the solution, one simply
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;assumes that the way those words are usually interpreted is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;wrong, and that each of them needs to be looked at from a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;rather different angle. It is the *answer* which you (and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;others) find monstrous, Paul. Had it resulted in the name
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;*Edward de Vere*, you would have found the 'key' to it
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;quite brilliant - and so would I.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Notice that it is the *key* that is the important bit as
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;far as the Friedmans were concerned in determining the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;probability of a message hidden in the form of a cipher
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;being valid. I have simply applied this approach to the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;clue which I say leads to the message hidden in the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;epigraph. This is what they say about the cryptanalyst's
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;task:

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;quote)

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;But if there is rhyme and reason about the way he has
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; reached the solution, if the system really is a rational
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and consistent system

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;There is little rational and nothing
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;consistent about your 'system'.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;It has no rhyme and little reason.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Thank you for your opinion. Any irrationality or inconsistency
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;you care to point out will be gratefully noted.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the keys really keys

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Your 'keys' are not really keys.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;It's a clue. And it works. As I said, see
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;http://www2.prestel.co.uk/rey/riddle.htm

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and if when
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; they are rigorously applied they produce a plain text
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; which is really a text,

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The 'text' that you produce is far from
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;what the Friedmans would regard as
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;'plain text'.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Other than the name itself and 'sieh all', the text for a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Jacobean solver would have remained just as it was.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Only the meanings to be given to certain words were
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;different. The overall meaning was of course far from
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;'plain', but if it had been any plainer it wouldn't have been
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;much of a puzzle, would it? Once solved, however, the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;meaning is certainly clear enough to have satisfied the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Friedmans' requirements.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; he can begin to take himself
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; seriously.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Sorry, but you have not reached this
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;stage. You should not take yourself
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;seriously.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Oh Lor. Coffee spluttered all over the monitor again.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;You would think I'd know by now.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The point must be reached where he begins
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to feel that the whole thing did not and could not
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; happen by accident.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I didn't read Terry Ross's posts about
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;your 'decryption' -- but I'm sure that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the Friedmans have covered the kinds
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;of methods of self-deception which
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;you have employed.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Maybe they have. Now all you have to do is to point
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;out a specific example of this 'self-deception' to me so
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;that we can check.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; But it is not simply a matter of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; his feeling this; the assessment can be far more rigorous.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The mathematical theory of probability can be applied,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and the chances calculated exactly. If the cryptanalyst
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; finds a certain key and (on the basis of the way it is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; built up) he calculates that the chances of its appearing
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; by accident are one in one thousand million, his
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; confidence in the solution will be more than justified.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The maths are irrelevant when the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;whole 'solution' is as contrived as
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;yours.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Cart before the horse, Paul. It is the *probability* of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the clue occurring by chance which determines whether
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;or not the solution *is* 'contrived'. Your opinion on
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the subject is irrelevant.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Give this 'puzzle' to 1,000 cryptanalysts
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;at that place in Cheltenham. Tell them
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;that there's name in there somewhere.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;How many 'solutions' would they come
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;up with that were at least as 'good' as

An interesting point in this is the similarity between Giovanni
Mocenigo's denunciation of Bruno and Richard Baines' denunciation of
Marlowe to the Privy Council - they are not only identical in mentality
and motivation but almost also in their contents. The difference is,
that while Bruno stood up in defending himself and going through the
ordeals of a process that inevitably led to his murder, the
denunciation of Marlowe led to his disappearance under the probable
cover of a tavern brawl surrounded by a mystery of uncountable
questions without a single possible answer except that he probably got
away. Bruno's denunciation was in 1592, Marlowe's in 1593. They were
very equal in character, judging from the plays we have in Marlowe's
name. The fact that Marlowe put Bruno in one of his plays adds
credibility to the possibility that he had met with Bruno in the circle
of Sir Philip Sidney.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I found a possible interpretation of the sun heresy in Charles
&gt;&gt;&gt; Nicholl's book The Reckoning. He guesses that the &quot;priest of the
&gt; sun&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt; mentioned by Greene is Giordano Bruno, one reason being that he
&gt;&gt;&gt; supported the Copernican theory:

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;From Preface to Perimedes the Blacksmith, probably a reference to
&gt;&gt;&gt; Marlowe:

&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;for that I could not make my verses jet upon the stage in
tragical
&gt;&gt;&gt; buskins ..., daring God out of heaven with that atheist
Tamburlan,
&gt; or
&gt;&gt;&gt; blaspheming with the mad priest of the sun.... such impious
&gt;&gt;&gt; instances of intolerable poetry, such mad and scoffing poets
that
&gt;&gt;&gt; have prophetical spirits as bred of Merlin's race.&quot; (p.203,
1995)

&gt;&gt;&gt; So maybe Burgess is making an oblique reference to Bruno, whom
&gt; Marlowe
&gt;&gt;&gt; might have known.

&gt;&gt; Why on Earth so complex and unbelievable an hypothesis?

&gt;&gt; The plain and obvious reading of the extract is that the &quot;mad
priest
&gt; of
&gt;&gt; the sun&quot; is a character in a play.

&gt; I went back to Nicholl to better see his reasoning, and he discusses
&gt; Bruno for several pages. Bruno is actually a character in Faustus B,
&gt; which, when I saw your remark, is what I thought could be a
&gt; possibility, but Nicholl thinks that the scene with Bruno wasn't
&gt; written until 1600.

&gt; Nicholl's words: &quot;As far as I know, no one has found anything
&gt; in Tamburlaine, or in any other play current in 1588, to explain this
&gt; allusion.&quot;&quot;The 'mad priest of the sun' was not, I suggest, a
&gt; theatrical character.&quot; (p.206)

&gt;&gt; Bruno was a heliocentrist, but he also believed (correctly) that
the
&gt; sun
&gt;&gt; was not the center of the universe either, but merely one star
among
&gt;&gt; other stars.

&gt; Sounds interesting! Maybe a Renaissance Carl Sagan.
&gt; But wouldn't Renaissance thinkers be more preoccupied with the
radical
&gt; idea of heliocentricity, which metaphorically makes the sun like a
god?
&gt; They might not have taken at all seriously the multi-star theory
&gt; because it's so ahead of its time.

&gt;&gt; And he was not a sun-worshiper in any sense. He was a Christian,
&gt; though
&gt;&gt; an extremely heretical one. (Despite the claims of anti-Catholic
&gt; writers
&gt;&gt; in search of a second Galileo, Bruno was in fact condemned for his
&gt;&gt; adherence to the ancient heresy of Docetism, the believe that Jesus
&gt; did
&gt;&gt; not have a physical body.)

&gt; Nicholl's interpretation of Bruno:

&gt;&quot;His version of heliocentricity was mystical, emblematic; the sun as
&gt; the divine light of truth and revelation towards which the magician
&gt; aspired. Copernicus had, in Bruno's view, only restated an ancient
&gt; magical truth. Other early Copernicans believed this too--Thomas
Digges
&gt; referred to heliocentricity as a 'most ancient doctrine of the
&gt; Pythagoreans, lately revived by Copernicus' --but none expressed it
&gt; with such fervour as Bruno. He was a kind of evangelist for
occultism,
&gt; and this symbolic reading of Copernican astronomy was at the core of
&gt; his message. As the great Bruno scholar Frances Yates puts it: 'the
&gt; sun-centred universe was a hieroglyph of Bruno's magical religion'.&quot;
&gt; (p.207)

&gt; He further discusses Bruno's relationship to Faustus and Marlowe in
&gt; that chapter, if you want to look into it more.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I had thought that Limbo was in Purgatory, but actually it is in
&gt; Hell,
&gt;&gt;&gt; at least according to Dante. Pretty harsh, though it is a
&gt; relatively
&gt;&gt;&gt; mild place.

&gt;&gt; Apart from the fact that Dante has not, to my knowledge, been
&gt; declared a
&gt;&gt;&quot;Doctor of the Church&quot;, his location of Limbo within the physical
&gt; bounds
&gt;&gt; of Hell is chiefly a convenient plot device to keep the story
&gt; properly
&gt;&gt; confined within its three cantiche (for Dante is the most
&gt; architectonic
&gt;&gt; of poets). At any rate, he shows no punishment there, save
exclusion
&gt;&gt; from Heaven. (Indeed, Dante's Limbo is a much nicer place than the
&gt;&gt; classical pagans hoped for themselves.)

&gt; Maybe also it was too controversial to put Limbo in Purgatory,
&gt; because then there is a possibility of moving from there to
&gt; Paradise.

&gt; C.Lariad

&gt;&gt;&gt; The heretics are also in Hell, at a lower level. See this
&gt;&gt;&gt; map:

&gt;&gt; In burning tombs. As far as I can recall offhand, every one is, to
&gt; use
&gt;&gt; the technical terms, guilty of formal, pertinacious heresy.

For crying out loud, Chris, what on earth are you playing
at? There is not a soul who has posted here for more than
a month or two who doesn't know perfectly well who you
are. What's this &quot;I suppose an anti-Stratfordian might
even say... &quot; crap. You ARE an anti-Stratfordian, as
you have made abundantly clear in almost every one
of the 600 or so posts you have treated us to hitherto.

The point here is that (a) the most obvious *name* which
'decks' the tomb is 'Jesus' and (b) the first word which
most 'Christians' (including you?) would associate with
Jesus is 'Christ'. Right?

Christ!

Hi, Peter Farey. It's nice to meet a celebrity like yourself.
I must apologize to Mr. Lanciai--I did not realize I was using
his initials, CL.

Actually, my first name does start with C, and Lariad is
supposed to sound like Ariadne. The L added a nice ring to it,
I thought.

I'm sure I don't know as much about this inscription as he does,
but the sake spares did indeed sound like a possibility to me,
but of course I hesitate to fully support either interpretation
because I don't know enough about probability theory. I believe
one has to take into account the fact that a letter such as &quot;e&quot;
would occur more often than other letters, etc.

some stuff about Gondomar for those interested...

The mercantile connections established by Marranos in the South-West
during the sixteenth century were maintained in the seventeenth and
form a direct link with the first known Jewish settlers in the
eighteenth.
In 1617, a Marrano, Antonio Dacosta Doliveira, was in Plymouth where
he acted commercially on behalf of the Spanish Ambassador to London,
Count Gondomar.
[Count Gondomar's letters from London were published as Documentos
ineditos para la Historia de Espana (Madrid, 1936). Mr Edgar Samuel
kindly supplied this reference.]

It appears that the Marranos in England made little secret of their
religious beliefs and further that some of them may have settled in
Exeter, as in 1600 the Bishop of Exeter complained of the prevalence of
'Jewism' in his diocese. [Roth, Jews in England, p. 149.] It is
possible, however, that the Bishop might have been referring to
heterodox beliefs held by some of his flock, and not to the presence of
Jews or pseudo-Jews. [See L. I. Newman, Jewish Influence on Christian
Reform Movements (New York, 1925), pp. 1-3, for the use of 'Judaizing'
and its synonymous forms in this sense.]

........................................................................... ........................................................................... ...................................

With Sir John Elliott, Professor Michael is involved in the Gondomar
Project of the Spanish State, which consists of cataloguing and
digitizing all the domestic correspondence of Diego Sarmiento de
Acuña, Spanish Ambassador to James VI &amp; I, preserved in the Royal
Library, Madrid. He has also attempted to foment cinema studies in the
Modern Languages Faculty, organizing the Spanish Film Event in 1998-99
and editing with Robin Fiddian the resulting volume of papers.

(quote, excerpts)

Middleton Thomas (1580-1627) English dramatist. He completed his
studies at Oxford. He started writing lines The Ghost of Lucrece but
his fame is due to his comedies and tragedies.

A Game at Chess was written in 1624. This comedy is structured like a
game at chess between two opposed formations called Black House
(Spanish Royal House) and White House (English Royal House). There are
two characters, unidentifiable with chess pieces, but assigned directly
to the two formations; Black Duke and White Duke.

Today the most accredited identification of the most important
historical characters is the following:

White King: King James I (1566-1625) of Stuart dynasty. He is Anglican.
Historically he is considered as absolutist and puritans persecutor.

White Queen: The Church of England.
White Knight: Prince Charles, King James' son.
White Duke: the Duke of Buchingham, G.Villiers (1592-1628). King
James' minister.
White King's Pawn: the Duke of Middlesex. King James' treasurer.

White Bishop: The Archbishop of Canterbury.

Black King: The Spanish King Philip IV (1605-1665).
Black Queen: The Church of Rome.
Black Knight: The Duke of Gondomar, Spanish ambassador at London.

Black Duke: The Earl of Olivares, first Spanish minister.
Black Bishop: The General Father of Jesuits (hierarchically he
represents the highest grade of the Company of Jesus).

The comedy had a clamorous success even though some of its aspects (the
comedy's approval by the master of the Revels, the trial against the
author and actors, the closing of the theatre where the play was
represented - the famous Globe - the direct intervention of James I)
have just been investigated till today and are considered a little
historical case. A game at Chess' work was certainly commissioned to
Middleton and was prepared in a very short time considering that Prince
Charles and the Duke of Buckingham came back from their Spanish mission
only on the 5th of October 1623 and the comedy was approved in order to
be represented on 12th of June 1624.

--------
I think you have it all lyra. These are only notes to contextualise yours.

It echos a previous work by Marco Girolamo Vida; a mock-heroic poem
&quot;Scacchia ludus&quot;, which appeared in about 40 printed editions between 1525
and 1616. Essentially that title and this are politcal satire.

Another chessic title appeared in 1612, La Scaccaide, by Salvio 'a traegedy
drawn from the game of chess.' Which I might call 'soap'.

One other similar title is from Arthur Saul &quot;Famous Game of Chesse-Play&quot;
1618, which was on the lines of a morality play, advancement and pawn
promotion themes.

Thomas Middleton drew on the Saul-Barbier book, an anti Spanish polemic,
which &quot;played to packed houses for nine days running&quot; an unprecedented
success at the time.

I have a plate of the cover which has below the title, 2 cartoons, one set
over the other, the top one has a bunch of character surrounding a chess
baord, and the bottow three men standing, a &quot;Fatte Bishop&quot;&quot;The Black
Knight&quot; and &quot;The White Knight.

To emulate the original typescript the title is:- [= superscript]
[[subscript]] all centered.

All the 'clues' you propose seem to me to
be chancy. And the words don't fit them.
As one example, the name of 'Jesus' does

&gt; I have no idea. Nor have you.
&gt; But it sounds like fun.

"/>

It's the task of the originator of a theory
to suggest how it might be disproved.
Or that's what's supposed to be the case
in science. It's a step often missed, and
you don't seem to have considered it.
How WOULD someone prove you wrong?
I suspect that there is no way -- and
certainly not one you would accept.

If so, then it is NOT a scientific hypothesis

On a more general point, I think you fail to see
the extent of the problem facing those who
devised the inscription. They had to satisfy
two major requirements (as I see it under my
scenario; yours will be a bit different but,
I think, roughly similar):
(a) Its principal function was to satisfy any
tourists or 'the curious' who came to Stratford
and would expect to see a monument in the
church to the local hero. They must see
something which fitted the story they'd
been told, or which did not clash with it too
much.
(b) Locals who read it (those who could and
who bothered) had to see it as referring to the
Stratman -- or IMHO more probably his father,
who'd been dead for about 20 years, being
over 70 when he died. They knew the status
of their illiterate local man, and would never
have conceived that he had anything to do
with the famous poet and playwright who,
quite coincidentally, had a similar name.
For these people, the inscription had to be
fairly vacuous

That poet's name really DID 'deck his tombe
for more than cost'. (And it sounds to me
that this was a complaint -- his real tomb
was something pathetic and disgraceful).
It was also indeed the case that 'all that he
hath writ leaves living art but page to serve
his wit'.

The circumstances of the cover-up DID place
these two hopelessly incongruent people
together in one 'monument' in a strange and
appalling manner. And you are correct to
point out the strangeness of the line:
&quot;. . death hath plast / with in this monument
Shakspeare . . &quot;
The gap between the 'with' and the 'in' is
significant. If it were a typo, it would be
a very rare one. 'Within' had long been a
distinct word and 'with in' was (and is) a
phrase with a quite different meaning.

The sense of 'in this monument' is
metaphorical, as I think you suggest.

When you allow for the complexity and the
delicacy of the task facing the compilers of
the inscription (IMHO Ben Jonson is the
most likely suspect) there is little room for the
kind of coded message that you find. It just
does not fit those circumstances. Nor can
I see Jonson (if it was him) contriving such
an inelegant, vague, crudely-worked and
desperately uncertain 'message'.

There MAY well be a coded message in
this text, but you have not found it.

Paul.

I give is that of finding that seven words 'flagged'
by the wrong-sized initial capitals are the *same*
seven words as those which, if given a different
meaning to the apparent one, result in a totally new
message (including that name) from a text which is
seventy words long.

To say that the name 'Jesus' decks the grave (in the

read into its use as applied to 'Shakspeare' on the

'Within' was certainly used more than 'With in'

Your probability ignores the fact that there are thousands of texts you
could use to find secret messages in, hundreds of arbitrary games you
could play with the words in those texts--besides the anagrams,
crossword synonyms, picture words, different-sized letters, and the
like that you have used here--and at least a thousand messages that
could be found that would qualify as a &quot;solution&quot; (especially if the
awkward, ambiguous message you have found here counts). I would say
that the odds are better than even that a person could come up with a
message &quot;proving&quot; his candidate wrote the plays of Shakespeare doing
what you did. That I'm right is verified by the plenitude of
differently-arrived-at secret messages that have indeed been found, and
seem as valid to their finders as your message seems to you.

Another problem is the insanity of someone's finding a way to insert a
message into this particular inscription and putting one in as stupid
as this one--even though no one would be able to read it except someone
who already knew it was there and what Great Secret if concerned, and
who bothered to come all the way to little Stratford just to see a
monument to a man for doing something the visitor knew he didn't do.

Doctor Faustus 1616 Text ,From Act III, Scene i.

FAUSTUS. Go, haste thee, gentle Mephostophilis,
Follow the cardinals to the consistory,
And as they turn their superstitious books,
Strike them with sloth and drowsy idleness,
And make them sleep so sound that in their shapes
Thyself and I may parley with this Pope,
This proud confronter of the Emperor,
And in despite of all his holiness
Restore this Bruno to his liberty
And bear him to the states of Germany.
MEPHOST. Faustus, I go.
FAUSTUS. Dispatch it soon.
The Pope shall curse that Faustus came to Rome.

....

BRUNO. Pope Adrian, let me have right of law.
I was elected by the Emperor.
POPE. We will depose the Emperor for that deed
And curse the people that submit to him.
Both he and thou shalt stand excommunicate
And interdict from church's privilege
And all society of holy men.
He grows too proud in his authority,
Lifting his lofty head ABOVE THE CLOUDS
And like a steeple overpeers the church.
But we'll pull down his haughty insolence,
And as Pope Alexander, our progenitor,
Trod on the neck of German Frederick,
Adding this golden sentence to our praise:
'That Peter's heirs should tread on emperors
And walk upon the dreadful adder's back,
Treading the LION and the DRAGON down
And fearless spurn the killing basilisk,'
So will we quell that haughty schismatic,
And by authority apostolical
Depose him from his regal government.

The Massacre at Paris, From Act I Scene i.

NAVARRE. But he that sits and rules ABOVE THE CLOUDS
Doth hear and see the prayers of the just,
And will revenge the blood of innocents,
That Guise hath slain by treason of his heart,
And brought by murder to their timeless ends.

Firstly that is not true. Secondly, my
point was that the use of this word in
either context is wrong -- it's especially
wrong as regards the Stratman's tomb.
We have to consider why the compiler
of this inscription DID use this word
here. He had plenty of other, much more
appropriate ones, especially IF he had
been saying what you think he was
saying.

'Deck' OED
&quot; 2. a. To clothe in rich or ornamental garments; to cover with
what beautifies; to array, attire, adorn. . .&quot;

The name of 'Jesus' in the lines of the
doggerel prayer is not an adornment.
(The verse is so appalling that, if anything,
it's the opposite.) That doggerel is there
for an entirely practical purpose -- as part
of a plea to leave his bones alone.
A dedication to the deceased or to a
religious figure might be regarded as
'decking'.

&quot;Good Friends, for Jesus' sake forbear,
To dig the bones enclosed here!
Blest be the man that spares these stones,
And curst be he that moves my bones.&quot;

Btw, some second thoughts here. It's
possible that the superb De Vere tomb

was ALSO -- or REALLY -- for the great
poet. It is (at least nominally) for Sir Francis
Vere -- Oxford's cousin who died in 1609 and
had fought in the Dutch wars. It is so
elaborate, and so well done in black marble,
that it must have been fearfully expensive.

(Who paid for it? Why did Sir Francis,
who was a worthy character, but no more,
get such a beautiful, prominent and
expensive tomb?)

It does, in fact, have a curious 'deck'.
I speculate that this strange statement on
the Stratford monument is not a complaint,
but a simple extension of the compliment
being paid to the poet.

So what? There is plentiful very strong, uncontra-

monument's speaking of &quot;all that he hath writ.&quot;
(16/08/01)

The allusions to him in the First Folio and on his

are many others as important. (26/12/01)

There IS direct evidence against it--such as the
First Folio, the monument, (13/01/02)

No, I don't assume; I KNOW that he is described as
a writer on his monument. (02/04/02)

From the point of view of direct evidence, Digges's
reference to Shakespeare the poet's STRATFORD
monument is much stronger evidence than anything
Jonson said. (02/04/02)

Is the statement on the monument to the William
Shakespeare of Stratford who died 23 April 1616
that speaks of all he wrote not direct evidence
that he wrote something? (28/09/02)

People who must have included at least some who had
known him, put up a monument to him that praised him
as a poet. Etc. (09/01/03)

The monument is direct evidence (26/04/03)

we have the testimony of the monument, which says
he wrote. (17/10/03)

The key to the identity of the author of the Shake-
speare works is such factually uncontradicted direct
evidence as the testimony of the title pages, the
Stratford monument, Shakespeare's will, various
other writers, etc. (05/10/03)

Do pay attention, Bob. The monument is to the *author*,

Thanks for this, Bob. Paul's post containing it
hasn't turned up on my server for some reason,
but I'll see if it's on Google when and if I can
summon the energy. However...

It seems to me that so far all of the attempts which
have been made to refute the message I claim to have
found hidden in the monument's epigraph, with the
possible exception of Terry's (i.e finding another
meaning for it), have been barking up the wrong
tree.

To me, there really is no point in arguing whether or
not the name 'Christofer Marley' is hidden there. It
is. And there is no point in arguing whether or not
it was put there deliberately. It was. Those odds
take care of both questions quite conclusively.

How I would argue against my current position would
therefore be to take those two things as read, but to
attack what the message is actually *saying* about him.
For me, the best bet is that the epigraph's author is
having a laugh at everyone's expense by - shades of
Mark Antony - pretending to praise Shakespeare but
in fact secretly saying that he thinks Marlowe was better.
(And is thus also giving Marlowe the monument that
he never had).

To get this interpretation, all remains much as I have
suggested up until the end of the name. Then, rather
than take SIEH to be 'he is returned', assume it to be
pronounced, as many rebuses require, in the way it
looks - SEE. The rest - &quot;all, that He hath writt, /
Leaves living art, but page, to serve his witt.&quot; has
more or less the same meaning as in the orthodox
version (whatever that may be!) with the exception of
the HE, which now, of course, refers to 'Christofer
Marley' and not Shakespeare.

What do you reckon?

You should be able to find out if reasonably

People enjoy puzzles. They often have to wait

get the (or 'a') result. Or get a local newspaper
to do a piece -- again offering a prize. They are
always short of material. Or try those attending
quiz-night in the local pub.

However YOU cannot be the final judge.
None of the results will be the one you expect.
You'll get far better 'solutions' (for other names)
than yours, so you'll need an umpire who is
independent -- and not your good self.

Or send it to GCHQ. This is exactly the sort
of material their recruits need for practice

(Help on hand for would-be spooks)

Jonson did not praise lightly (if at all to
towards anyone else). Nor did anyone
ever earn such praise.

&gt; Mr Crowley I am not twisting or contriving anything. I am making the

Except that you can't think of any good
reason for Shakespeare's.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Shakespeare is no different from

He is very different. He was head and shoulders
above all of them. And far more successful in
terms of a playwright.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; If you required the same standard of proof of every other author that

Total nonsense.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; There is plenty of documentation that shakespeare was from stratford

It's minimal -- and that little is manifestly
contrived.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; The name of 'Shakespeare' was famous
&gt;&gt; throughout the land. No one would have
&gt;&gt; thrown away a document with his name
&gt;&gt; on it. They could have sold it for good
&gt;&gt; money.

&gt; Assuming that they knew what the document was.

The man (under your scenario) did not die in
poverty or obscurity. There is no reason why
his documents should have been dispersed
or lost. They were all in plain English.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Yes. It would have sold and made
&gt;&gt; money.

&gt; His plays were put in print and sold as the folio. I am not sure what
&gt; other writing he had that could have been sold for profit.

Manuscripts of his would have had great
value. People collect relics of all sorts.
Ever heard of the 'True Cross'?

&gt; I said it was part of a tight factual matrix. I have indeed seen it. In
&gt; fact, here it is:

&gt;&quot;Yes trust them not: for there is an vpstart Crow, beautified with our

&gt; is as well able to bombast out a blanke verse as the best of you: and
&gt; beeing an absolute Iohannes fac totum, is in his owne conceit the onely
&gt; Shake-scene in a countrey.&quot;

&gt; A case of professional jealousy.

Of whom though? And do you know to
whom Greene was addressing this letter?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; The other point is that Cooke -- a doctor from
&gt;&gt; Warwick, who had known John Hall and knew
&gt;&gt; the local apothecary -- somehow forgot to ask
&gt;&gt; if the Great Bard had left any papers or books.
&gt;&gt; Nor did he mention Him in any respect at all
&gt;&gt; when writing up this story. There had clearly
&gt;&gt; been ever only one learned man living in that
&gt;&gt; house -- a Dr John Hall.

&gt; If he knew john hall, then how do you know he did not ask john hall
&gt; about books, papers etc?

Presumably he did not know John Hall was
going to die when he did.

&gt; Signatures can vary. No great surprise in that.

The man who wrote those 'signatures' had
had very little practise at writing.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Eh? They stopped him meeting anyone
&gt;&gt; liable to leave a note. Then they also
&gt;&gt; made sure that no one printed anything.

&gt; Of course you have no evidence for any of this. You are supposing it to
&gt; be so. But contrary to your supposition, we have evidence that
&gt; shakespeare left stratford and was an actor:

&gt; It is of course impossible for a couple of minders to prevent an actor

&gt; Impossible then that 'minders' could have 'stopped him [shakespeare]

The man was in Stratford nearly all the
time; as were his minders. I'm sure he
was accompanied by the same goverment

&gt;&gt;&gt;Charles Dickens- Parents were illiterate servants

&gt;&gt; That's strange, because I read that his father
&gt;&gt; became a journalist on the Morning Herald,
&gt;&gt; once he got out of debtor's prison -- when
&gt;&gt; Charles was ~15.

&gt; You are correct. My mistake.
&gt;&gt;&gt;Mahatma Gandhi- mother was illiterate, came from a village where average
&gt;&gt;&gt;education was grade 3. He was the first person in his family to graduate
&gt;&gt;&gt;high school. Completed London matriculation and bar exams

&gt;&gt; Sure. Indians have long had a tradition
&gt;&gt; of female illiteracy. We are talking about
&gt;&gt; the west.

&gt; I thought we were talking about people coming to prominence (and
&gt; excellence) after a severely disadvantaged childhood. East or west

&quot;Mohandas Karamchand was born on the 2nd October 1869 in Porbandar
in the state of Gujarat, India. He was the son of a wealthy family from the
caste of the traders, who again belonged to the group of the merchants
(Vaishyas). His father held the office of Prime Minister in the principality
of Rajkat. . . &quot;

Your information on Gandhi seemd to be up
to your usual standard -- entirely wrong.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Yeah, yeah -- it's the great detail that

If there was ever a case where the
