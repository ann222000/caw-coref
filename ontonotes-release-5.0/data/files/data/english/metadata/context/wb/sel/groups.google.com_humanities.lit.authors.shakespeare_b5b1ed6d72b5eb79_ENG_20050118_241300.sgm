Consider in this respect the following from Joseph
Campbell's Creative Mythology:

[The] Anglo-Saxon word wyrd has about it a sense of haunting doom that is
recaptured in Shakespeare's three Weird Sisters. These are transformations
into witches of the Norns of old Germanic myth, who (as described in the Old
Norse &quot;Wise Woman's Prophecy,&quot; Völuspó) dwell by Urth's well, from which
they water the roots of the World Ash. Shakespeare's trio, on a &quot;desert
heath,&quot; amid thunder, lightening, and rain, conjure from their witches'
cauldron prophecies that are heard as though from outside by Macbeth, yet
are of deeds already maturing in his heart. In Old Norse the Norns' three
names are given as Urth, Verthandi, and Skuld: &quot;Become, Becoming, and Shall
Be,&quot; Past, Present, and Future, which appear to be a late invention,
however, inspired perhaps (twelfth century A.D.?) by the model of the Greek
three Graces. For there seems to have been originally but one Norn: called
Urth in Old Norse, in Old High German Wurd, and in Anglo-Saxon Wyrd. The
word may be related to the German werden, &quot;to become, to grow,&quot; which would
suggest a sense of inward inherent destiny. . Another association is with
the Old High German wirt, wirtel, &quot;spindle,&quot; by which the idea is suggested
of a spinning and weaving of destiny. The classical triad of the Moirai may
have contributed to this image; namely of Clotho, the &quot;Spinner,&quot; who spins
the life thread; Lachesis, &quot;Disposer of Lots,&quot; determining its length; and
Atropos, &quot;Inflexible,&quot; who cuts it. And so the symbol of the spindle became
significant of destiny, and the woven web, of life.

Aphrodite was called Eldest of the Fates, Aphrodite Urania. In truth this
singular Fate is the complex character Aphrodite-Hermes, a.k.a. Draco,
Tityos, Metis-Coeus, Venus-Mercury, Eros - i.e. the hero in general, the
Green Woman coupled to the Green Man.

Although of the past, the duality Humphrey-Anna remains profoundly yet most
subtly coincident with the present. As such, this existential presence is
symbolized in terms of smallness, lowness, humbleness. The word humble
derives from the Latin humilis, &quot;low,&quot; and humus, &quot;earth,&quot; and is cognate
with the Greek chamai, &quot;on the ground,&quot; and chthon, as in the name Thunar,
i.e. Donar, Thor, a.k.a. Zeus, Jupiter. As we've noted, the name Anna is
linked to the Latin anus, &quot;ring,&quot; and annus, &quot;year,&quot; and is akin to the Old
Irish ánne, &quot;ring,&quot; the Sanskrit anna, &quot;food.,&quot; and the Greek ana, &quot;up,
back, again.&quot;

We've recognized this extremely discreet and providential male-female
presence immediate to the White-Red constellation Osiris-Orion: the star
Sirius, the &quot;Dog Star,&quot; original underdog. Indeed the dog, wolf, fox and
coyote are especially popular symbols of this subtle, old and eternal power.
In each version of the Hamlet myth, for instance, a dog or wolf is involved
with the hero. In Norse myth Fenrir the wolf-son of Loki corresponds to Ursa
Minor and especially to Polaris. Ragnarök, the terminal battle of the
current cosmic cycle, begins when Fenrir breaks the magic cord that
otherwise binds him. Holmberg writes (as reported by Santillana and von
Dechend in their Hamlet's Mill):

The Siberian Kirghis call the three stars of the Little Bear nearest the
Pole star, which form an arch, a &quot;rope&quot; to which the two larger stars of the
same constellation, the two horses, are fastened. One of the horses is
white, the other bluish-grey. The seven stars of the Great Bear they call
the seven watchmen, whose duty it is to guard the horses from the lurking
wolf. When once the wolf succeeds in killing the horses the end of the world
will come.

The Cherokee, note Santillana and von Dechend, call the Milky Way &quot;Where the
dog ran.&quot; A certain dog, the story goes, habitually stole meal from a corn
mill owned by the &quot;people of the South&quot; and ran with it to the North,
dropping meal as he went and thus creating the Milky Way. (Reverse these
directions and the story fits my understanding of proto-mythology.)
Santillana and von Dechend furthermore point out &quot;the preference of the very
many mythical dogs, foxes, coyotes - and even of the 'way-opening' Fenek in
West Sudan - for meal and all sorts of grain - more correctly 'the eight
kinds of grain.&quot; Recall that the Hermes-like &quot;Opener of the Way&quot; in Egyptian
mythology, guide to the mysterious Duat (seemingly the afterworld), is
jackal-headed Upuat - the Greek Anoubis, this name from the Egyptian Anpu,
which latter name stems from the word inpw, which word is related to the
English word emperor, which word derives from the Latin in + parare, &quot;to
prepare, order,&quot; as in the Parcae, spinners of Fate. Likewise Odysseus upon
returning home during the 20th year of his absence is greeted by his old dog
Argos; which then immediately dies. The ancient Celtic word meaning &quot;fox&quot; is
lovernius, which can be interpreted literally as &quot;hill spring gatherer,&quot; or
&quot;gatherer about the hilltop spring.&quot; This name and its meaning are
strikingly reminiscent of Aquarius. Athens' famous Lyceum, the gymnasium
where Aristotle taught, was literally the &quot;Gathering Place (or Den) of
Wolves.&quot; Ancient Mediterranean soldiers typically wore dog-skin caps, these
being akin to the aforementioned bear-skin caps of the Germanic warrior
elite.

Recognizing the equivalency between the dog/wolf/fox/coyote and the bear,
recall that Arcadia, located on the Peloponnesian peninsula, is named after
Arcas, son of Zeus and Callisto. Hera turned Arcas and Callisto into bears.
Zeus then set them in the stars as Ursa Minor and Ursa Major, respectively.
In Arcadia there remained a proto-mythological cult of the wolf. That cult
referred to Zeus as Zeus lykaos, meaning &quot;Zeus-the-wolf&quot; or
&quot;Zeus-the-shining&quot; - the latter as in the name Phoenix - and indeed
practiced human sacrifice and cannibalism. Inevitably the re-invented Zeus
of the Great Reversal, sent the famous 9-day deluge to destroy this last
bastion of proto-mythological Greek culture. Zeus's son Apollo, whose twin
sister is Artemis, was likewise referred to as Apollo lykaos. Apollo was
furthermore considered the &quot;god of distant archery.&quot; The English word arrow
stems from the Latin arcus, meaning &quot;bow, arc, arch.&quot; Santillana and von
Dechend recount the Lapp belief that when the star Arcturus (located in
Bootes) shoots the &quot;North Nail&quot; with his arrow on the last day, heaven will
fall, crushing the Earth and setting fire to all. They also report that the
Babylonians called Polaris the &quot;Arrow Star&quot;; that the Babylonian New Year
ritual recognized the Arrow Star as the star &quot;who measures the depth of the
sea&quot;; and that the Avesta refers to, &quot;Tishtriya [&quot;the Arrow&quot;], by whom the
waters count.&quot; Jacob Grimm recounts the medieval Dutch poem of Brandaen:
&quot;Brandaen met on the sea a man of thumb size, floating upon a leaf, holding
in his right hand a small bowl, in the left hand a stylus; the stylus he
kept dipping into the sea and letting the water drip from it into the bowl;
when the bowl was full, he emptied it out, and began filling it again. It
was imposed on him, he said, to measure the sea until Judgment day.&quot; The
Finnish Kalevala describes a Great Oak and the very special man whose
stature is inversely proportional to both the size of the ocean from whence
he comes and the height of the magnificent tree which he addresses:

And the summit rose to heaven
And its leaves in air expanded,
In their course the clouds it hindered,
And the driving clouds impeded,
And it hid the shining sunlight,
And the gleaming of the moonlight.

The aged Vainamoinen,
Pondered deeply and reflected,
&quot;Is there none to fell the oak-tree,
And o'erthrow the tree majestic?
Sad is now the life of mortals,
And for fish to swim is dismal,
Since the air is void of sunlight,
And the gleaming of the moonlight.&quot;

Then a man arose from the ocean
From the wave a hero started,
Not the hugest of the hugest,
Not the smallest of the smallest.
As a man's thumb was his stature;
Lofty as the span of woman.

This same extremely humble figure was also able to kill the great ox which
all other potential heroes fled from in fear. Tom Thumb, Tiny Tim, John
Barleycorn (a &quot;barleycorn&quot; being the unit equal to 1/360 of a meter; the
name is linked to the Sumerian se, pronounced &quot;shay,&quot; and to the Cretan
deai, both meaning &quot;barley, grain,&quot; the latter being a basis of the name
Demeter): they all correspond to Humphrey-Anna, to the dog/wolf/fox/coyote,
to the high priest, to Upuat, to Hermes, to Polaris, to Aquarius, to the
mill/harvest, to the New Year, to the end/beginning of the cosmic cycle
(i.e. the &quot;world&quot;).

This analysis suggests that the foregoing association of Apollo with Delphi
is surely more than an artifact of the Great Reversal. The very word
melissai, &quot;bees,&quot; referring to the priestesses of the temple at Delphi,
seems to resonate not only with the Greek word meaning &quot;honey,&quot; meli, but
also with the famous Homeric term lyssa (the Attic lytta, as in Hippolytta,
queen of the Amazons), meaning &quot;martial fury&quot; and &quot;rabies&quot; and being closely
related to lykaos. In fact, the harlot-priestesses of Inanna's temple in
Mesopotamia were known as lukur-priestesses, &quot;wolf-priestesses&quot;; and the
Latin word lupa - literally &quot;she-wolf&quot; - also means &quot;prostitute.&quot; (A
she-wolf, recall, nurses Remus and Romulus.) Proto-mythology seems to
consider bees honey-wolves, just as it considers bears bee-wolfs (as in the
name Beowulf). Bees and bears are in this sense equivalent, and both are
equivalent to wolves; moreover each is equivalent to the great guide and,
similarly, to the sacrificed Father.

Many myths alternatively feature a hare, a serpent, or a salmon to represent
Humphrey-Anna. Other such symbols are the color orange (as in the
orange-fleshed, orange-skinned salmon), orange fruit, cheese, carrots (which
are domesticated Queen Anne's Lace), and the pearl. Oddly enough the word
pearl stems from the Latin perna, &quot;upper leg.&quot; Mythical heroes typically
carry a wound in the upper leg or hip, which wound adumbrates their their
destined sacrifice, their inevitable reduction, as it were, to godly status.
Odysseus as a young man was wounded just above the knee by a boar's tusk.
When following the Trojan War and his famous subsequent misadventures
Odysseus returns home disguised as a beggar, his old nurse (a she-wolf of
sorts, and á la his dog Argos) recognizes him by this scar. Scars are pearls
of sorts. Likewise, Odysseus's chief patron is the goddess Athena - whose
famously grey eyes are akin to pearls. The word pearl is furthermore related
to the Greek pterne, meaning &quot;heel of a shoe,&quot; and ptelos, &quot;wild boar.&quot;
Hunting dogs, of course, are trained to follow at their master's heel.
Odysseus returns home following 19 full years of absence and is recognized
by his dog, who has effectively remained at Odysseus's heel all along. The
ancient Egyptian system of proportion is based on a column or row of 19
squares; but curiously the Egyptian gods tend to be depicted only 18 squares
tall yet standing upon a pedestal (from the Latin pes, &quot;foot&quot;) which is 1 of
these units tall and which is the symbol of the fraction ½. That pedestal
and likewise that fraction - which fraction represents the primordial
instant of creation/sacrifice (Kronos castrating Ouranos, for instance) -
are heels of sorts. Likewise what chiefly connects Achilles to his father
Peleus - i.e. to death, to mortality, to Father Dis (god of the
underworld) - is his weak heel. Remember in this respect that the P-I-E
prefix per- means &quot;to strike.&quot; We examined this prefix in relation to the
Biblical and Akkadian names for the Euphrates, i.e. the river of death:
Perath or Parat, and Purattu, respectively. Similarly the thunder god of the
Slavs is named Perun; the Lithuanian god of lightning and thunder is
Perkunas; and the Hawaiin volcano goddess is Pele. In Sanskrit, púr- means
&quot;fortified stronghold made of earth.&quot; Other cognates include the Greek
perdix,/i&gt;&quot;partridge&quot; (sacred to Aphrodite; the male hobbles during his
mating dance, á la Aphrodite's husband Hephaistos), parthenos, &quot;virgin&quot; (as
in the Parthenon, i.e. the Doric temple of virign Athena); the Greek
geranos, &quot;crane&quot;; the Germanic ger, meaning &quot;spear&quot; and &quot;true,&quot; as in the
German gitriuwi, &quot;faithful,&quot; and likewise as in names of Hamlet's mother
Gertude and Odysseus's wife Pe(r)nelope; the Sanskrit grhá, &quot;enclosure,&quot; the
Lithuanian gardas, &quot;pen&quot; or &quot;fold,&quot; the Albanian garth, &quot;hedge,&quot; the Avestan
g?r??a-, &quot;cave,&quot; and the Russian górod, &quot;city,&quot; all of which derive from the
P-I-E ghordo; and similarly the Norse Hel, goddess of the underworld, she
being akin to Persephone as well as to Helen and to Helen's essentially
sacrificed (in this case cuckolded) husband, the red-haired Menelaos.

Thus it is that dogs, nurses, scars, pearls, heels, creation/sacrifice,
lightning, thunder, volcanoes, goddesses/mothers/wives, cranes, and
castles/forts/groves/caves/grottos/pens/homes/cathedrals/cities/tombs are
closely related.

The number 19 represents the White/Apollonian, the physical, the essential,
the boundary - i.e. &quot;being,&quot; as I (following Einstein) call it. Boundary is
nothingness in contrast to Red/Dionysian reality, i.e. in contrast to monads
(which quanta Sartre referred to as &quot;being&quot;). By his wife Hecabe (&quot;100&quot;; who
nevertheless represents the triple-Goddess, eg. Hecate) Troy's King Priam
had precisely 19 sons, although he had 50 children total - including 12
daughters. Precisely 19 rectilinear pieces comprise the border of the famous
Tunc page of the Book of Kells. In connection with Egyptian art we've noted
that White/Apollonian 19 involves a nevertheless superior, godly,
Red/Dionysian 18. Likewise, perhaps, Mayan art is based on an 18 x 19 grid.
More generally speaking, the 18:19 ratio (0.9474) is almost exactly that of
the length from the apex of a pentagon to its base compared to the length
from the pentagon's left upper point to its right upper point. The
proportions of a pentagon are strictly related to Phi, the Golden Mean. For
instance, a pentagon inscribed within a circle of radius 1 measures exactly
Phi/2 from the center to the base. The 18:19 ratio is moreover almost
precisely that of the 5th musical chord, the semitone, which is the sound
produced by a plucked string being held at the point 243/256 = 0.9492 of its
length. Curiously, every 18th number - and only every 18th number - of the
Fibonacci series (the most obvious symmetries of which are 5-fold, 12-fold
and 60-fold) has 19 as a factor. Moreover, the hexagonal numbers 1, 6, and
12 (a single hexagon can be surrounded by 6 others, which can then be
surrounded by yet 12 more) sum to 19. Indeed, the number 19 is akin to the
Fibonacci structure, to the Sign of Solomon (the Star of David), to the
number 9, and to the cube, all of which resonate with the Golden/Legal
tension between White/Apollonian 12 and Red/Dionysian 5 or 6.

Saint Brigit's shrine in Kildare, Ireland, was maintained by 19 nuns in turn
over the course of 19 days. On the 20th day the shrine was supposedly
attended by the saint herself. In 432 BCE the astronomer Meton pointed up
the &quot;Grand Cycle of 19 Years&quot;: the new Moon (or rather, dark Moon) coincides
with the new Sun of the winter solstice (i.e. the most southerly rising and
setting of the Sun; the longest night of the year) every 19 years, a
coincidence which is called the &quot;Meeting of the Sun and Moon.&quot; Odysseus, the
Moon, returns to meet Penelope, the Sun. We recognized such coincidence in
regard to the courts of Sumer: The full Moon - and especially the orange,
Harvest Moon, the rising of which coincides temporally with yet is spatially
opposite to the setting of the Sun - represents the completed king, i.e. the
king upon his moment of sacrifice, of regicide, at which moment he at last
corresponds to the Sun, i.e. he at last becomes dominantly Red/Dionysian and
thus virtually female, all but identical to his queen or queens. Perhaps
this periodic coincidence is why the Babylonians considered the 19th day of
a month taboo and counted 19 as 20 minus 1. According to the Great Reversal,
on the other hand, the king (eg. Odysseus) is not sacrificed but rules unto
wizened senescence. The number 19 is likewise related to the phenomenon
called nutation (which word stems from the Latin nutare, &quot;to nod&quot;).
Concomitant of planetary and lunar motion the chief precessional motion of
the Earth's axis is embellished, so to speak, with small elliptical motions.
These embellishments are the nutations. The primary nutation periods are
13.66 days (half the period of the Moon's orbit around the Earth), 1/2 year
(i.e. half the period of the Earth's orbit around the Sun), 9.3 years
(rotation period of the Moon's perigee) and 18.6 years (concomitant of the
18.6-year oscillation of the plane of the Moon's orbit around the Earth
relative to the plane of the Earth's orbit around the Sun; i.e. the period
of the Moon's &quot;nodes,&quot; these being the points where the orbit of the Moon
intersects the plane of the ecliptic, i.e. the plane of the Earth's orbit
about the Sun). The 18.6-year nutation - marked by an amplitude of 9.2
seconds of arc - is the most obvious. Yet nutation itself was not discovered
until 1728, by the English astronomer James Bradley; and it went unexplained
for another 20 years. Nevertheless many ancient astronomical observatories,
including Stonehenge, accurately record the 18.6-year cycle of the Moon's
nodes. That cycle can be considered to represent the important resonance
between the numbers 18 and 19. A more precise match to the more godly of the
pair, the number 18, is the fact that each eclipse of the Sun by the Moon
can be said to repeat itself (in terms of its non-negligible qualities as
observed by the naked eye on Earth: completeness, location in the sky,
apparent size of the disc) at a different place on the Earth every 223
synodic months (a.k.a. lunations), i.e. 223 x 29.5305882 = 6585.3211 days =
18.029 years (on average, the synodic month varying from 29.2 days to 29.8
days), this 18.029-year duration being a so-called &quot;saros&quot; period. These
immediate repetitions occur at different places on Earth, so to say, because
the saros period is not a whole number; rather it is off by 0.3211 days.
Consequently 54 years and 34 days pass before such repetition occurs (i.e.
is focused) at virtually the same place on Earth. That the fraction 0.3211
is so importantly linked to the number 54 will prove to be very interesting
to us. The number 1132 is Joyce's favorite symbol in the Wake, and he
occasionally therein he does use 3211 instead. His usage of these symbols
remains an extreme mystery. Moreover, his next favorite symbol in the Wake
is the nearly as mysterious number 432, which equals 54 x 8. As we will see,
the numbers 54 and 432 and 8 are extremely significant in relation to the
universal clock. And since relative to a single human lifespan eclipse
repetitions - meetings of the Sun and the Moon, i.e. of the female and the
male - are perhaps the most important ticks of that clock, Joyce may have
used the symbol 1132 to indicate the extreme mythological importance of the
coincidence of the Sun and the Moon. The transposition from 3211 to 1132, it
would therefore seem, indicates proto-mythological, &quot;counter&quot;-clockwise
motion, a sort of reversal of time (or a reversal of the Great Reversal).
Similarly, if you read 3211 backwards you get 1123: the initial 4 numbers of
the Fibonacci series. Curiously, I might add, the initial 6 Fibonacci
numbers sum to 18 (or 3 x 2 x 1 x 1 x 3), while the initial 8 Fibonacci
numbers sum to 54 (or 3 x 2 x 1 x 1 x 3 x 3). We should further recall in
regard to the Joycean symbols 1132 and 3211 that the Sun's mean apparent
diameter - virtually equal to that of the Moon, a coincidence requisite for
the further coincidence which is a total eclipse of the Sun - spans 32
minutes and 2 seconds of arc. The 11 in 3211 or in 1132 could be thought to
indicate these 2 seconds, these 2 ticks. Moreover, as I earlier noted and
later will explain, the number 32 (as in 3200 BCE?) is quite generally
significant of the precise moment of falling, i.e. of the tip of the
pyramid, the proto-mythological New Year, the star Polaris, the end of a
cosmic cycle, quantum gravity, the suspended/mediate nature of every monad
and of the essence of existence in general (eg, Hermes, Odin on the tree,
mistletoe in the tree, the golden bough, the Holy Grail, the Fibonacci
structure, etc.). And insofar as the number 32 represents falling/unity, the
number 23 - i.e. 32 in reverse - represents rising/plurality.

We've seen that the number 19 is related to the root pe-, especially as
that root expresses boundedness. Another pe- word noteworthy in this respect
is peasant. According to the Great Reversal, peasants are natural slaves
rather than potential warriors, kings, priests or representatives of the
Black/Baroque. The word peasant is nevertheless cognate with a tremendously
rich collection of mythologically important characters, words, and
phenomena. Sure, the Latin pagus merely means &quot;district&quot;; but the Greek pege
means &quot;spring (of water).&quot; Here we are back in the primordial garden, the
mythological moment, the moment of gravity. Indeed, it is from the primeval
garden's central spring that the name of the chief celestial ramification of
said garden derives: the Pegasus Square. With a blow of his hoof, the winged
horse Pegasus - i.e. the Phoenix - causes the Hippocrene stream to spring
forth from Mount Helicon. The name Pegasus stems from the aforenoted pege
coupled to sus,&quot;up, sweet.&quot; Mount Helicon goes by many names, including
Haran, Ararat, and Tara (the latter perhaps from téa múr, &quot;Téa's wall).

Abutting said mountain's location on the northern face of the universal
clock is the constellation Ursa Major, which corresponds to the Titan
Iapetus (or Io-Petus) - note the pe- root - and his consort Themis
(&quot;order&quot;), she who accepted from Gaia responsibility for Delphi. This pair
further corresponds to the following famous and equivalent dualities:
Iseult-Tristan, Guinevere-Lancelot, Grainne-Diarmuid, Isis-Osiris, the
Asvins (a.k.a. the Nasatya), Freya-Frey, Ariadne-Theseus, Aphrodite-Adonis,
Ishtar-Tammuz, Inanna-Dummuzi, Cybele-Attis (i.e. Isabelle-Attis),
Astarte-Attis, Artemis-Apollo, etc. Which is to say, Ursa Major corresponds
to the happy state of the hero prior to his sacrifice. Homer in the Iliad
points up this correspondence as he describes the shield which Hephaistos
fashions for Achilles:

Five welded layers composed the body of the shield. The maker used all his
art adorning this expanse. He pictured on it earth, heaven, and sea,
unwearied sun, moon waxing, all the stars that heaven bears for garland:
Pleiades, Hyades, Orion in his might, the Great Bear, too, that some have
called the Wain, pivoting there, attentive to Orion, and unbathed ever in
the Ocean stream.

Bathing in the Ocean stream means sacrifice followed by burial in/upon
water, i.e. in/upon the river of death (Eridanus, Euphrates, Styx, etc.),
which river corresponds to the stretch of the northern face of the universal
clock running from Cepheus to Hercules and coincident with the Milky Way,
a.k.a. Brown Street.

A &quot;wain&quot; is a chariot. In Ursa Major we have the true stellar equivalent of
the charioteer Phaethon (whose name means &quot;Shining,&quot; as in Stephen King's
famous novel and Kubrick's film adaptation of it). The son of Helios (a.k.a.
Phoebus, the &quot;shining one&quot;; considerably equivalent to Apollo, son of Zeus)
and Clymene (daughter of Oceanos), Phaethon questions whether Helios is in
fact his real father. To demonstrate the strength of his paternal bond,
Helios promises to fulfill any single wish Phaethon puts to him. Phaethon
responds by asking permission to drive the Sun-chariot, with its 4 white
horses, through the heavens for a day. Helios reluctantly honors the wish.
Young Phaethon, however, quickly loses control of the vehicle. Initially he
turns too far from the Earth and therefore the Earth grows very cold. Then
he turns too close and is about to burn up the Earth. Zeus intervenes by
striking the chariot with a lightning bolt, sending Phaethon plummeting into
the river Eridanus. Zeus moreover floods the Earth to reduce the planet's
temperature. Phaethon's friend Cygnus grieves so hard that Zeus turns him
into a swan; and Phaethon's sisters, the Heliades, grieve so much that Zeus
turns them into alder trees, their tears becoming amber. The fall of
Phaethon, the Greeks say, marked the end of the Golden Age. I think it
likewise corresponds to the advent of the Great Reversal and especially to
the aforenoted comet impact in the Mediterranean Sea c. 3200 BCE.

Helios's chariot is equivalent to the chariot driven by the mother goddess
of Asia Minor: Cybele. This goddess was chiefly associated with the Earth,
with eminences, and especially with a black stone enshrined at Pergamum. In
Phrygia she was perhaps originally called Kubaba, &quot;Lady of the Cube,&quot; for
she is associated with a goddess of that name whose shrines were likewise
situated in caves or grottoes and who was worshipped at Carchemish - the
town, recall, that I mentioned in connection with Haran, Haran being located
where the ancient road north from Damascus intersected (i.e. coincided with)
the ancient east-west road from Nineveh to Carchemish. Note the resonance
between Cybele and the Ka'aba (the &quot;Cube&quot;) - the most sacred shrine of
Islam, containing in its southeast corner the Black Stone of Islam. Likewise
note her resonance with Humbaba of the Gilgamesh epic - which epic I will
interpret in the next chapter, uncovering the equivalency of Humbaba, the
cube, the Yule log, and Ulysses. Virgil (70-19 BCE) in his Aeneid says that
the Trojans and hence the Romans considered Cybele their mother goddess.

Midsea great Jove's great island Crete, lies southward. There's Mount Ida,
there the cradle of our people [the Romans]. . There was the origin of Mount
Cybelus' Mother goddess [Cybele, the &quot;Lady of Ida&quot;], with her Corybantes'
brazen ringing cups, her grove on Ida; there her mysteries, devoutly kept,
and the yoked lions of Our Lady's car.

That lady and that car and those lions are the proto-mythological Sun.
According to Greek myth, the lions are the transformed heroic couple
Atalanta (&quot;balanced&quot;) and Melanion (&quot;black Moon&quot;). Yet Virgil here is
expressing what is perhaps the chief proto-mythological, non-Greek (or at
least non-Athenian) legend about the founding of Troy, according to which
Troy was founded by the 1/3 of Crete's population who fled that island
nation under pressure of famine and led by a Prince Scamander (whose name
was subsequently given to the Phrygian river Xanthus). Upon reaching a
certain Phrygian beach, they made camp in the shadow of a tall mountain,
which they named Ida after the Cretan mount considered home to Zeus. Apollo
had suggested they settle where they happen to be attacked at night by
Earth-born enemies. To my mind such enemies represent dreams (especially
nightmares), &quot;giants&quot;; but according to legend the enemies in this instance
were mice, for Scamander's initial camp was attacked at night by a horde of
field mice, and Scamander hence dedicated a shrine there to Sminthian Apollo
(&quot;Mouse Apollo,&quot; a favorite Cretan god) and married the nymph Idaea.
Eventually the Phrygian king Dardanus welcomed these Cretans, now called
Teucrians after Scamander's son - by Idaea - and successor, Teucer, and went
so far as to give his daughter in marriage to Teucer and to refer to his own
subjects as Teucrians. The Athenians, contrariwise, say that Teucer had
emigrated to Phrygia from Athens and that Dardanus, son of Zeus by the
Pleiad Electra (daughter of Atlas), arrived shortly thereafter from the
Arcadian kingdom founded by Atlas, where he fathered by a daughter of Teucer
the boys Erichthonius and Ilus (i.e. Oïleus) and that later he married
Chryse, the daughter of Pallas, and fathered by her a pair of sons, Idaeus
and Deimas. The historical Troy referred to by Homer seems to have been the
7th of 10 successive city-states built upon the same hillock. As was common
in those Bronze Age times, this particular Troy seems to have been the
capital of a federation of 3 peoples. In this case the tribes were likely
the Trojans (White?), the Ilians (Red?), and the Dardanians (Black?).

Now, the aforementioned Pallas is an extremely interesting figure. She was
the childhood &quot;playmate&quot; of Athena. The 3 goat-skin-clad nymphs of Libya had
found the infant Athena on the shore of that land's great salt lake
Tritonis. The child Athena accidentally killed her peer Pallas (&quot;maiden,
youth&quot;) while they were playing at combat with a spear and shield. Aggrieved
at this loss, Athena asked to be called Pallas Athena and eventually
emigrated to Greece via Crete.. One way or the other, the aforementioned
Ilus, son of Dardanus, emerges in Phrygia, where he is instructed by the
local king (or else by Apollo) to follow the wanderings of a certain spotted
cow and to found a city wherever the beast initially lies down. Heeding this
instruction, Ilus follows the cow to the small hill of Ate, where it finally
lies down. This resting place is precisely where Dardanus had determined to
build a city, a project Dardanus aborted when an oracle of Phrygian Apollo
warned him that misfortune would always befall the site's inhabitants. Ilus,
despite this warning, proceeds to build the city of Ilium (which is
eventually named Troy). Having layed out the city boundary, Ilus prays to
Zeus for a sign. Exiting his tent the next morning, Ilus stumbles upon a
half-buried wooden object which proves to be the representation of Pallas
which Athena had carved in memory of the dead Libyan playmate. The idol is
legless yet life-sized, standing 3 cubits tall, wrapped around the breasts
by the aegis (&quot;goat-skin&quot; girdle, a shield of sorts), holding a spear in her
right hand and a distaff and spindle in her left. Regarding the Palladium,
Apollo Smintheus (i.e. Apollo the Mouse God, whom we will meet later and who
is credited with benefiting the Cretan foundation of Troy) advises Ilus:
&quot;Preserve the Goddess who fell from the skies and you will preserve your
city. Wherever she goes she carries empire!&quot;

Initially Athena had erected this idol on Olympus, where it attracted great
honor. But when the Pleiad Electra, Ilus's grandmother, was &quot;raped&quot; by Zeus
and in turn touched the idol, Athena considered it defiled and therefore
cast the idol and Electra (&quot;Amber&quot;) down to Earth. This is to say, Pallas
and Electra are identical, Pallas representing the chief member of the
college of nymph priestesses - alias the Pleiades, the Krittika (the
ultimate critics, you might say), Joyce's St. Bride's Academy - who
according to proto-mythology initiate the execution of the king when his
virility significantly declines. The Palladium's spear symbolizes this
execution, while her distaff and spindle symbolize the concomitant
matrilinearity and, moreover, fate in general. The Palladium and Electra
correspond to the missing 7th Pleiad and likewise to the leap year (or &quot;leap
tear,&quot; as Joyce referred to it) and especially to its 29 February and the
number 366 - i.e. to the utter mystery of existence, White-Red-Black
existence. What's more, they correspond to the black stone sacred to Cybele.
In 204 BCE - and surely in light of Apollo Smintheus's aforementioned
oracle - Romans brought Cybele's black stone to Rome, another oracle having
prophecied that if this stone were housed in Rome then Cybele would aid the
Romans in their war against the Carthaginians. Need I add that the Palladium
and the black stone of Cybele are equivalent to the Black Stone of Islam -
and that these are also equivalent to the Statue of Liberty!?! Yes, Lady
Liberty - who, like the Black Stone of Islam, faces southeast - is Lady
Libya is Joyce's Livia is Pallas is Electra is Andromeda (purportedly
chained or tied by the hair to a corner of the Pegasus Square, the corner at
once nearest the Pleiades and Polaris, which corner is the star Alpheratz,
&quot;Broken Down,&quot; alias Sirrah, from the Arabic Al Surrat al Faras, &quot;The Navel
of the Horse&quot;): chiefly the middle, Red/Dionysian, nymph aspect of the
(White-Red-Black, Black/Baroque) triple-Goddess, which aspect has been
specifically oppressed by the Great Reversal. Chances are that the Black
Stone of Islam is a tektite; but more likely still, it was originally
considered an especially dark peice of amber, a teardrop of the
triple-Goddess.

Robert Graves, from his Greek Myths:

The Palladium, which the Vestal Virgins [a reduced manifestation of the
college of nymphs] guarded at Rome, as the luck of the city, held immense
importance for Italian mythographers; they claimed that it had been rescued
from Troy by Aeneas and brought to Italy. It was perhaps made of
porpoise-ivory. 'Palladium' means a stone or other cult-object [typically
phallic/serpent/herm-like in its nature, akin to the illicit items contained
in the Gorgon-faced aegis bag/wallet/basket - the name Paris means &quot;wallet,&quot;
and as an infant Trojan Paris was carried in a wallet after being abandoned
on Mount Ida - such as were carried thus in Athens's ancient Thesmophoria
procession of pseudo-harlot-priestesses; Pallas = Paris = phallus] around
which the girls of a particular clan danced [hence the words ballad, ball,
and ballet, where a b has simply replaced the p], as at Thespiae [and as
around the maypole], or young men leaped, pallas being used indiscriminately
for both sexes. The Roman College of Salii was a society of leaping priests.
When such cult-objects became identified with tribal prosperity and were
carefully guarded against theft or mutilation, palladia was read as meaning
palta, 'things hurled from heaven'. Palta might not be hidden from the sky;
thus the sacred thunder-stone of Terminus at Rome stood under a hole in the
roof of Jupiter's temple - which accounts for the similar opening at Troy.

Worship of meteorites was easily extended to ancient monoliths, the funerary
origin of which had been forgotten; then from monolith to stone image, and
from stone image to wooden or ivory image is a short step. But the falling
of a shield from heaven - Mars's ancile [as in the Latin ancilla, &quot;female
servant&quot;] is the best known instance - needs more explanation. At first,
meteorites, as the only genuine palta, were taken to be the origin of
lightning, which splits forest trees. Next, neolithic stone axes, such as
the one recently found in the Mycenaean sanctuary of Asine, and early Bronze
Age celts or pestles, such as Cybele's pestle at Ephesus, were mistaken for
thunderbolts. [Said double-headed axe was called a labrys, which word, as I
will explain, is related to the word labyrinth, to Janus, and to Achilles.]
But the shield was also a thunder instrument. Pre-Hellenic rain-makers
summoned storms by whirling bull-roarers [rhomboi] to imitate the sound of
rising wind and, for thunder, beat on huge, tightly-stretched ox-hide
shields, with double-headed drum-sticks like those carried by the Salian
priests in the Anagi relief. The only way to keep a bull-roarer sounding
continuously is to whirl it in a figure-of-eight, as boys do with toy
windmills, and since torches, used to imitate lightning, were, it seems,
whirled in the same pattern, the rain-making shield was cut to form a
figure-of-eight, and the double drum-stick beat continuously on both sides.
This is why surviving Cretan icons show the Thunder-spirit descending as a
figure-of-eight shield; and why therefore ancient shields were eventually
worshipped as palta. [I wonder whether a comet descending into Earth's
atmosphere would be shielded, as it were, by an obvious figure-8 shape.] A
painted limestone tablet from the Acropolis at Mycenae proves, by the colour
of the flesh, that the Thunder-spirit was a goddess, rather than a god; on a
gold ring found near by, the sex of the descending shield is not indicated.

The figure-8 shield certainly smacks of the symbol - suggestive of the
Meeting of the Sun and the Moon - that graced the wandering cow which
determined for Cadmus the site where he should settle and hence where the
Greek city of Thebes would occur.

That story is almost perfectly paralleled in the legend of Ilus's founding
of Ilium and hence of Troy. Moreover, Greek Thebes - whose symbol is a lion,
as in the lion of dawn, the lion of the desert, the lion of the Sun, and the
lions of Cybele - resonates with Egyptian Thebes, with the Siwa oasis near
Libya, and with Greek Dodona. At Egyptian Thebes there was a colossal yet
hollow black statue of a seated stone figure. When the initial rays of
sunrise heated the statue's interior and made the air therein rush through
the narrow throat, the statue made a sound like that of a breaking
lyre-string. The Greeks considered this statue a representation of of Memnon
the Ethiopian, son of Priam's half-brother Tithonus (governor of Persia for
Priam's overlord Teutamus, king of Assyria) and of Cissia, &quot;Ivy,&quot; or Eos,
&quot;Dawn.&quot; Priam bribed Tithonus with a golden vine, i.e. a golden bough, so
that Memnon (&quot;Resolute,&quot; as in Agamemnon, &quot;Very Resolute&quot;) would aid the
Trojans against the Greeks. (Likewise Zeus compensated Tros with a golden
vine for the rape of Ganymede.) Initially Ajax attacked Memnon, but Achilles
took over the job from Ajax and killed the ebony warrior. Eos then asked
Zeus to grant Memnon immortality. Robert Graves:

A number of phantom hen-birds, called Memnonides, were consequently formed
from the embers and smoke of his pyre, and rising into the air, flew three
times around it. At the fourth circuit they divided into two flocks, fought
with claws and beaks, and fell down upon his ashes as a funeral sacrifice.
Memnonides still fight and fall at his tomb when the Sun has run through all
the signs of the Zodiac.

According to another tradition, these birds are Memnon's girl companions,
who lamented for him so excessively that the gods, in pity, metamorphosed
them into birds. They make an annual visit to his tomb, where they weep and
lacerate themselves until some of them fall dead.

Egyptian Thebes, Siwa, and Dodona were the 3 prime ancient centers for the
worship of proto-mythological Zeus/Amen - i.e. the 3-Man, the Green Man -
and hence of the triple-Goddess. Long ago, recall, 2 black doves flew from
this Thebes, one to Siwa and the other to Dodona, each dove alighting on an
oak tree and proclaiming the tree oracular. The priestesses at Dodona were
called peleiades, &quot;doves&quot;; they were born of Atlas and Pleione, the Oceanid
daughter of the Titans Oceanus and Tethys. Robert Graves suggests that
Memnon has in this legend been confused with Mnemon, a title of Artaxerxes
the Assyrian, and with Amenophis, the Pharoah in whose honor the singing
black statue was constructed. I think the situation more deep and complex.
Mnemon primarily signifies Mnemosyne, &quot;Memory,&quot; mother by Zeus of the 3 (or
9) Muses and, we may infer, of the yet more antique Sirens, also 3 in
number. Likewise the prefix Mne- points to the P-I-E high priest Manu. As
such, both the name Memnon and the singing black statue represent the Green
Man and the Green Woman and especially the college of Siren-like,
Pallas-like nymphs who initiated the execution of the king (eg. Ganymede,
Memnon, Hylas, etc.). Pausanias: &quot;Swans sing before they die.&quot; Graves:
&quot;[T]he sacred king's soul departs to the sound of music.&quot; Stones and
especially singing stones seem to be closely associated with the sacrifice
of the king and with rain-making, as in the names/titles Cepheus and Peter,
each meaning &quot;The Rock.&quot; The Finnish Kalevala describes joy-stones,
music-boulders, and song-stones, which a rune singer would sit on while
singing and playing the kantele, a 5-stringed harp-like instrument
originally made of pike bone as explained in that epic's &quot;Runo 40.&quot; The
Finns and Lapps - as in lapidary, meaning &quot;stone,&quot; and the Latin lapis,
meaning &quot;stupid&quot; - are especially proto-mythological peoples, speaking as
they do Finno-Ugrian, i.e. non-P-I-E, languages.

It seems likely that proto-mythologists equated meteorites and especially
comets (both of which are literally planets of sorts, &quot;wanderers&quot;) with cows
or lions. Sure enough, the Greeks called the Pleiades constellation - as in
Electra/Pallas - the kometes, &quot;the long-haired,&quot; thus associating comets
with the oracular dove-priestesses of Dodona and with the wandering
cows/lions that founded, as it were, the oracular Egyptian city of Thebes
(and in turn Siwa and Dodona), Greek Thebes, Troy, and, I might add,
Antioch. In Old English, Old German, Czech, Hungarian, and Russian the
Pleiades are called the &quot;hen and chicks,&quot; as in the Memnonides. Thus the
Pleiades are further connected with the dawn of a new day (or year or age;
i.e. the crowing of the implicit cock, a symbol of Kronos), with the black
statue at Egyptian Thebes, and with Mnemosyne, the Muses, and the Sirens.

In the next chapter I will show that the aegis corresponds to the northern
face of the universal clock (and hence to the universe in general), its
contents corresponding to the constellation Draco, i.e. Metis-Coeus,
Eve-Adam, Aphrodite-Hermes, Iseult-Tristan, etc.

Shortly after Auguste Bartholdi granted to Victor Hugo a sneak-preview of
the Statue of Liberty, which project the great writer had long encouraged,
Hugo wrote the artist approvingly: &quot;To the sculptor form is everything and
is nothing; it is nothing without the spirit - with the idea it is
everything.&quot;

Apart from stone (especially black stone), the lion, the desert, the Sun,
and the Earth, other prime symbols of Cybele include a mirror, a
pomegranate, and a key. The key in general is associated with the
climax/peak, hurdle, and golden bough - i.e. with the general passage of the
complete proto-mythological hero - and likewise with Atlantean Clito and
with Greek Clio (Muse of history, as in the Greek klimba, &quot;ladder&quot;) and
likely, too, with Kolyo/Kalypso, and furthermore with glory, as in Herakles,
&quot;Hera's Glory.&quot; Indeed, the chief myth associated with Cybele concerns her
vengeance upon Attis for his infidelity. She causes him to go insane and
thus to castrate himself. Likewise Hera causes Hercules to go insane and
kill his wife. (And in fact the name Attis seems cognate with Gadirus, which
character of the Atlantis legend we recognized as a proto-Hercules, his name
meaning &quot;gate&quot; and &quot;cat,&quot; as in the Pillars of Hercules, Cadiz, Leo the
lion, and the lion or lions of Cybele. A cat, recall, has 9 lives.) These
motifs seem to be post-Reversal embellishments of the proto-mythological
notion that the wife or wives of the king must determine when he should be
sacrificed, this determination being made relative to his virility, which
virility was believed to be directly proportional to the health of the tribe
and of the cosmos in general.

The Great Reversal inverted the proto-mythological understanding of the
cosmos, placing the White/Apollonian (eg. male, horse, Greek) over the
Red/Dionysian (eg. female, lion, Trojan) and inasmuch all but eliminating
sacrifice - and with it multeity-in-unity, beauty. Hence another, contrary
inversion was called for. On the grand scale this return toward
proto-mythology could only be accomplished by a likewise grand sacrifice of
the White/Apollonian. But the White/Apollonian is not wont to execute such a
sacrifice upon itself, and in the midst of the Great Reversal it is not
inclined to allow the Red/Dionysian to execute a grand sacrifice upon it.
Therefore what was called for is a grand White/Apollonian, Adonis-like
character to sacrifice himself and reverse the Great Reversal, i.e. to
re-turn the Golden/Legal philosophy to its chiefly proto-mythological state.
This is precisely what Jesus of Nazareth did. In offering himself up for
sacrifice at the hands of the Red/Dionysian Pontius Pilate - note the Po-
and Pi- prefixes, akin to Pe- - of the Red/Dionysian Roman Empire (a
continuation of Troy, i.e. of Mesopotamia, Atlantis), Jesus became at once
identical to Kronos and to Ouranos, the self-sacrificing god. His death upon
the cross was not a mere representation of the original sacrifice/creation;
it was a true recreation of the cosmos.

Jesus of Nazareth's extremely White-Red, complex, beautiful, Galahad-like,
Aeneas-like, Castor-Polydeuces-like, Ganymede/Aquarius-like, Pelops-like,
Hercules-like, Hermes-like nature - i.e. of the mediate type who is both
born on Earth and borne up to eternal Heaven - is emphasized in the sense
that he is declared the only son of God. An only son is at once youngest and
eldest, White and Red. Likewise &quot;red-golden-haired&quot; Odysseus, Odysseus's son
Telemachus, and Odysseus's father Laertes (son of Arkeisios) are each the
only son of their respective fathers. In their predominate yet merely
White/Apollonian aspect each of these characters is akin to Apollo (he who
refuses to bind himself in marriage), Ursa Major, the Wain, Phaethon:
White/Apollonian yet imminently Red/Dionysian. Each represents that
extremely special type - which type is really every monad, every soul - who
does not truly die upon sacrifice. Such, too, is the nature of Odin, Hermes,
Ares/Mars, Attis, Hercules, to name just a few. From the 5th century BCE
Apollo became increasingly identified with Helios, the Sun - the
&quot;Unconquered Sun.&quot; Which is to say, Apollo became increasingly complex,
Red/Dionysian, ripe for sacrifice. Concomitantly solar monotheism became the
most popular form of paganism. When the Moon and the Sun meet, the Moon is
sacrificed and becomes the Sun: White/Apollonian becomes Red/Dionysian, male
becomes female.

Eventually Constantine equated Jesus with both Mars and the Unconquered Sun.
Constantine - whose own title of Emperor, cognate with the Egyptian inpw,
labeled him as being extremely akin to Mars (as does the title President) -
believed that Jesus Christ could determine victory in battle. It is said
that Constantine received instruction via a dream to place the &quot;Chi-Rho&quot; (as
in Kronos, the great emasculator) monogram on his standards and shields.

This sign, considered a monogram for Christ, also appears on Constantine's
coins from 315 CE. James Joyce likely considered the Chi-Rho a monogram for
Anna Livia Plurabelle, as well as for Christ: the lower half of the &quot;X&quot; may
be considered a pyramid akin to the &quot;A&quot; in Anna; the upper half may be
considered the &quot;L&quot; of Livia; and the &quot;P&quot; may be considered the &quot;P&quot; of
Plurabelle. Thus we have Black, White, Red. The nexus represents the
present, the moment of multeity-in-unity, of sacrifice, of gravity - of the
hero's ascent, if you will, to Heaven, i.e. eternity, completion, fully
self-aware existence. The sword-in-the-stone motif of the Arthur legend
likewise corresponds to the Chi-Rho monogram.

Returning our attention to Iapetus and Themis, note that the pair is said to
produce 3 offspring: Atlas, Prometheus, and Epimetheus. But Atlas is also
said to be the son of Poseidon and Clito. In this confusion we can recognize
a deep identity between Iapetus and Poseidon/Neptune/Neptno/Nehushtan/
Yahweh/Sila and between Themis and Clito/Kolyo/Kalypso/Leto/Leda/etc.
Likewise Prometheus seems to be an extremely complex,
Odin/Hermes/Ares/Mars/Attis/Hercules/Pelops/Ganymede/
Castor-Polydeuces/Aneas/Jesus/Galahad-like character. Cleverest of the
Titans, Prometheus tends to betray Zeus. For one, he tricks Zeus and the
rest of the gods such that they get the worst parts of any animal
sacrificed, the best parts going to the humans. He also steals the sacred
fire from Zeus and brings it to humanity. Epimetheus, on the other hand,
seems to be an all too simple, preternaturally White/Apollonian character.
The name Epimetheus means &quot;afterthought.&quot; Delegated by Zeus to help
Prometheus create humankind, Epimetheus is a fool who accepts Pandora as his
wife (i.e. he indiscriminately accepts everything) and thus brings ills and
sorrows to humanity. As for Prometheus, Zeus punishes him by chaining him to
a rock (á la Andromeda) and sending an eagle to eat his liver. The organ
regenerates overnight, however, and therefore the eagle returns day after
day to eat it. Zeus releases Prometheus after Prometheus informs him that
the sea nymph Thetis, whom both Zeus and Poseidon are lusting after, will
give birth to a son more powerful than whoever will be the boy's father.
Hence Zeus causes Thetis to marry a mortal: Peleus. (Yet another pe- name!)
Thetis nevertheless obsesses about bearing an immortal child. She therefore
gives birth to a series of children, each time perfunctorily throwing the
inevitably mortal child into her fire or boiling cauldron. Of course the
infants cannot survive this treatment. Upon the 7th such birth, however,
Peleus insists that the killing must cease. Thetis therefore pinches the
child, Achilles, by a heel and dips him in the river Styx, the river of
death, which river, according to Pausanias, bounds Tartarus's western side.
This is to say, Thetis baptizes the boy. Thus Achilles is rendered all but
immortal, invincible everywhere but at said point on his heel. In this sense
Achilles begins life as a Red/Dionysian, sacrificed character, a
proto-mythological, Ares-like warrior - precisely as his &quot;red-and-golden
hair&quot; and &quot;shaggy breast&quot; further attest. Indeed Achilles was worshipped as
a sea-god in many of the Greek colonies on the Black Sea. Achilles is a
Neptune, a Poseidon, an Erichthonios, an Hephaistos. Note that Achilles'
heel shot through with Paris's (i.e. Apollo's) arrow corresponds to the
Arrow Star of the Babylonians, i.e. to Polaris, the &quot;North Nail.&quot;

That pinch/arrow/nail corresponds to the pin which stoppers the single vein
of Talos, the bull-headed bronze man given to Minos by Zeus to guard Crete.
Talos is also the name of Daedalus's so-called apprentice, whom Daedulus
pushes off the roof of Athene's temple on the Acropolis out of jealousy over
the boy's great skill and out of disgust over the boy's supposed incest with
his mother Polycaste (&quot;much tin&quot; or &quot;extremely pure&quot;). (Athena had taught
Daedalus his craft.) This is why Daedalus is exiled and ends up in Crete,
where he builds for Minos's wife the hollow cow so she can have sexual
relations with Poseidon's beautiful white bull from the sea (which Minos
decided not to sacrifice, offering to Poseidon a surrogate instead) and in
turn, for Minos, the labyrinth so Minos and his cuckolding wife and her
offspring the Minotaur can live in humiliated seclusion. By some accounts
the human Talos - whose soul flew away as a partridge, Aphrodite's sacred
bird - is Hephaistos's father by Hera. In this sense Talos is not Daedalus's
student but his teacher. Indeed, the fall of Talos seems to correspond both
to the Great Reversal and to the proto-mythological sacrifice of the king.
The name Talos means both &quot;suffering&quot; and &quot;ankle, anklebone.&quot;
Proto-mythological, Aphrodite-like Medea killed the bronze Talos by pulling
out said pin; and some say that the Argonaut Poeas did the job by shooting
him in the ankle with a poison arrow. Similarly, Laius snatched his infant
son Oedipus at birth and pierced the boy's feet with a nail. Clearly Talos
resonates with Hephaistos, Oedipus and Achilles (among many other heros who
are poignantly wounded in the ankle or heel). The name Oedipus means
&quot;swollen foot,&quot; and it may derive from the Greek oedipais, &quot;son of the
swollen sea,&quot; i.e. &quot;son of Poseidon,&quot;&quot;son of Proteus ('the first man')&quot;; in
other words, he who, like Tristan, arrives by sea and returns (or is
returned to) the sea. The name Laius, I might add, smacks of the name
Claudius, which means &quot;lame,&quot; Claudius being Hamlet's evil uncle. Consider
the following germane commentary from Robert Graves' Greek Myths:

Talos's single vein belongs to the mystery of early bronze casting by the
cire-perdue method. First, the smith made a beeswax image which he coated
with a layer of clay, and laid in an oven. As soon as the clay had been well
baked he pierced the spot between heel and ankle, so that the hot wax ran
out and left a mould, into which molten bronze could be poured. When he had
filled this, and the metal inside had cooled, he broke the clay, leaving a
bronze image of the same shape as the original wax one.

Recall that the initial temple at Delphi is said to have been made of
beeswax, as in apiary and Apis and the Nile River god Hp (of Hap or Hapi)
and hippos &quot;horse,&quot; the horse being a prime symbol of Demeter and Poseidon.
The replacement of beeswax with bronze corresponds to the replacement of
Gaia with Apollo, of Poseidon with Zeus, of Talos with Daedalus or
Hephaistos, of Aphrodite with Athena - i.e. it corresponds to the Great
Reversal.

The name Achilles (Akhilles, Akhilleus, Aiákidês), said to mean &quot;he with no
lips,&quot; seems cognate with quelle, Germanic for &quot;well, spring,&quot; the Greek
pege. Likewise the name seems cognate with Lilith, ululate, and Ulysses. The
Greek akhos - synonymous, in fact, with the Greek penthos, as in penalty and
Penelope - means &quot;grief&quot; and &quot;song of grief.&quot; Homer's Iliad is a song of
grief. The title refers to the founder of Troy, Ilus the son of Tros, whose
name, too, seems cognate with quelle, Lilith, ululate, Ulysses, Achilles,
kill, kite (from the Middle High German kuze, &quot;owl&quot;), and kith (from the Old
English kuth, &quot;known,&quot; as in Athena, goddess of knowledge and war, whose
symbol is the owl; and as in the English word uncouth).

In the present light consider the prophecy concerning Aeneas, greatest
survivor of Troy and destined patriarch of the Romans, as told by Virgil in
his eponymous Aeneid:

In Italy he will fight a massive war,
Beat down fierce armies, then for the people there
Establish city walls and a way of life.
When the Rutulians are subdued he'll pass
Three summers of command in Latium,
Three years of winter quarters. But the boy [Aeneas's son],
Ascanius, to whom the name of Iulus
Now is added - Ilus while Ilium stood -
Will hold power for all of thirty years,
Great rings of wheeling months. He will transfer
His capital from Lavinium and make
A fortress, Alba Longa. Three full centuries
That kingdom will be ruled by Hector's race,
Until the queen and priestess, Ilia,
Pregnant by Mars, will bear twin sons to him.
Afterward, happy in the tawny pelt
His nurse, the she-wolf, wears, young Romulus
Will take the leadership, build walls of Mars,
And call by his own name his people Romans. .
The Trojan Caesar comes, to circumscribe
Empire with Ocean, fame with heaven's stars.
Julius his name, from Iulus handed down:
All tranquil shall you take him heavenward.

Julius Caesar, you see, was a
Hermes/Mars/Attis/Hercules/Pelops/Ganymede/Aeneas type - a Christ type!

Achilles stands in considerable contrast, as a more simple character,
prematurely Red/Dionysian. He is, recall, the chief character of the Iliad.
The whole conflict between Greece and Troy is traced to the wedding of
Achilles' parents Thetis and Peleus. The couple did not invite Ares' sister
Eris, the goddess of discord. Thus offended, Eris tossed into the wedding
feast a golden apple labeled &quot;For the fairest.&quot; Among the wedding guests
were Hera, Athena, and Aphrodite. Each of these 3 goddesses considered
herself the fairest and therefore laid claim to the golden apple. Zeus
proposed to settle the issue by letting the most beautiful of mortal man,
Ganymede-like Paris of Troy, judge which of the 3 goddesses is the greatest
beauty. Each of them bribe Paris: Hera promises him power; Athena promises
him wealth; and Aphrodite promises him the love of the most beautiful woman
in the world, Helen. Paris opts for Aphrodite and thus for Helen. Hera is
especially offended. She therefore develops a hatred for the Trojans.
Virgil, recall, writes of Hera - whose symbol is a &quot;proud warhorse's head,&quot;
just as Demeter's symbol is a mare's head - and of Aeneas's arrival at Dido'
s Carthage, which city Hera &quot;cared for more than any walled city on Earth&quot;
but of which she heard tell &quot;that generations born of Trojan blood [i.e. the
Romans] would one day overthrow her Tyrian walls&quot;: &quot;[T]he origins of that
anger, that suffering, still rankled: deep within her, hidden away, the
judgement Paris gave, snubbing her loveliness; the race she hated; the
honors given ravished Ganymede ..&quot;

Also woven into the Iliad is the story of Pelops (&quot;muddy face,&quot;&quot;Cronian
One&quot;), which is closely linked to the Greek Flood story and to the story of
Phaethon. Pelops is a beautiful boy dismembered by his father Tantalus -
whose own father Tmolus is described as wreathed with oak - and presented by
him to the Olympian gods as food, this supposedly to test the gods'
omniscience. According to the chief legend here, only Demeter, or else the
sea-goddess Thetis, partakes of the feast, consuming a piece of Pelops' left
shoulder. Zeus then damns Tantalus to Tartarus and resurrects Pelops, giving
the young man a new, ivory shoulder. Poseidon promptly whisks Pelops to
Olympus to be his personal cup-bearer, as Zeus later does with the Trojan
Ganymede. Eventually returned to Earth, Pelops becomes a champion
charioteer, akin to and aided by Poseidon. But to defeat King Oenomaus of
Elis in a chariot race and thus win princess Hippodameia's hand and with it
the kingdom of Elis, Pelops either needs to enlist the aid of Oenomaus's
chariot-keeper and sometimes charioteer Myrtilus, a son of Hermes.
Hippodameia (&quot;horse-tamer&quot;) has indeed fallen in love with Pelops. Yet
Myrtilus, too, has (bashfully) expressed a love for Hippodameia. Therefore
Pelops promises to Myrtilus both the sole company of Hippodameia on the
night of victory and half the kingdom of Elis. Myrtilus goes along with the
plan and therefore removes the lynch-pins from the axles of Oenomaus's
chariot, replacing them with replicas made of wax. Consequently as Oenomaus,
who had given Pelops a head start, is about to catch him and, according to
the rules of the (proto-mythological) contest, spear him in the back (that
spear, along with Oenomaus's pair of wind-begotten mares, being old gifts
from Ares, Oenomaus's father), the wax axles finally fail and Oenomaus is
dragged to death - but not before discerning the betrayal and cursing
Myrtilus to a death at the hands of Pelops. The victors Pelops, Hippodameia
and Myrtilus celebrate with an evening drive across the sea, yet when
Myrtilus's attempts to claim his prize of a night with Hippodameia, Pelops
casts him into the sea. But as Myrtilus drowns, he lays a curse on Pelops
and on the heirs thereof. Pelops drives on to the western stream of Oceanus,
where Hephaistos purifies him of guilt. Returning to Pisa in Elis and
assuming there the throne of Oenomaus, Pelops procees to conquer the whole
of Apia - as in bees, Apis, Hp, Poseidon - and renames it the Peloponnese,
&quot;Pelop's Island.&quot; Graves: &quot;Descent remained matrilinear in the Peloponnese,
which assured the goodwill of the conservative peasantry.&quot;

The curse leveled by Myrtilus upon the house of Pelops especially affects
the house of Atreus, who is Pelops' eldest son, the father of Agamemnon and
Menelaos, and is said to be the first astronomer to correctly predict using
mathematics an eclipse of the Sun by the Moon. Famously Agamemnon in his
turn fails to honor the aid which the Myrmidon Achilles gives to him. This
slight motivates Achilles to abstain from the fight against Troy. Clearly
the name Myrtilus and the title Myrmidon are related. The former is closely
linked to myrtle, &quot;ever green,&quot; as in the Green Man. The latter is said to
mean &quot;ant-person,&quot; i.e. bee-person, dog-person, wolf-person, Tom Thumb, John
Barleycorn - generally the dead/sacrificed yet immanent father. The prefix
myr- is, in fact, remarkable. In Russian myr- means both &quot;peace&quot; and
&quot;world.&quot; The English word peace derives from the Latin pax or pas, and
these are closely linked to the name Poseidon and to the words post,
passion, and, I might say, code (from the Latin caudix, codex, meaning &quot;tree
trunk,&quot; and equivalent to the title Co-Deus or Coeus, the Titan of
intelligence, paired with Metis and equivalent to the serpent of Delphi,
Draco, Aphrodite-Hermes, Eve-Adam, the serpent of the Tree of Knowledge).
Indeed, myr- in the form of mer- and mare- indicates &quot;sea,&quot;&quot;female horse,&quot;
&quot;merchant,&quot; Mars/Ares, and Hermes. Which is to say, myr- points to the apex,
the bee-hive, Apis, Hp, Poseidon, Aphrodite, Haran - generally to the moment
of sacrifice, of muleity-in-unity, represented by the god-goddess who
emerges from the sea, i.e. the Beast, the existential, proto-mythological,
tri-une figure, the Tree Man and Tree Woman, who symbolizes the real state
existence, the state of suspension, as it were, between the mere idealities
which are Heaven and Hell, this state being celebrated and indeed
apotheosized by proto-mythology and likewise by the somewhat more general
Golden/Legal philosophy but discounted and denigrated by the advocates of
the Great Reversal, which today include the neo-Zoroastrian, merely
White/Apollonian groups known as Christian evangelicals and militant Islam,
these seemingly contradictory movements actually depending chiefly on each
other for their power. Note: White/Apollonianism is elemental to
proto-mythology and especially to the Golden/Legal philosophy, but insofar
as it is not subsumed in and subservient to this paradigm and philosophy,
respectively, it is monstrous, tending via its disjunction from reality
toward an extreme unity, i.e. an extremely simple unity, ultimately
identical to solipsism and in this sense merely ideal. Permit me to add that
I voted for John Kerry but I think that George W. Bush and his close
company, though pandering to the Christian right, are trying to act
precisely according to the Golden/Legal philosophy, which philosophy is
clearly in fact the basis and essence of the United States government. This
is now the chief problem of the Democratic political party in the United
States: relative to the Repbublican party the Democratic party has become
perceived as the lesser advocate of proto-mythological, Golden/Legal
multeity-in-unity, which paradigm and philosophy, respectively (if you will
allow the distinction), and especially the former, the common person (and
thus the electorate) naturally conserves. The Democrats' increased advocacy
of what may be usefully if not altogether fairly called simple,
White/Apollonian freedoms (i.e. freedoms for the sake of mere freedom)
relative to complex, Red/Dionysian ligatures (i.e. legacies, legalities,
legends, etc.) has cost it the trust of the people. Of course I will explain
this opinion further..

Pearl, pedestal, Perath, pentagon, period, peasant, Pegasus, Penelope,
penthos, Iapetus, Peleus, Pelops. - The root pe- just won't stop. Likewise
Joyce in the Wake offers ubiquitous, pointed references to Perse, Parnell,
Purcell, Percival (Parsifal), Persephone (Proserpine), Perseus, etc. Let's
presently consider these latter 3, mythological persons (which word, I
should add, stems from the Etruscan phersu as well as from the Greek
prosopon, both meaning &quot;mask&quot;).

Lowly, naïve, simple Percival strikes out from his mother's house - which
house is absent adult men - and straightaway encounters and kills the Red
Knight, taking his red armor (like Hector takes the armor of Achilles from
the dead body of Patroklos) and inasmuch becoming the Red Knight. Percival,
owing to his extreme simplicity, eventually attains a glimpse of the Holy
Grail; but unlike the extremely complex, yet simple, and inasmuch extremely
pure, extremely beautiful Galahad (á la the Trojans Ganymede/Aquarius,
Aeneas, and, it's fair to say, Julius Caesar), Percival is not able to touch
the Grail and therefore does not ascend with it to heaven with it as does
Galahad (á la Ganymede/Aquarius, cup bearer of the gods; or Aeneas, bearer
of the golden bough). Note in this connection that the Holy Grail and the
golden bough (mistletoe or not) are essentially the same thing: passports to
eternity, held by the most complete, complex, dual, Hermes-like type; i.e.
they are symbols of such type, which type every monad really is. Which is to
say, the Holy Grail, the golden bough, mistletoe: all are outstanding
symbols of Existentialism. And as I've suggested, the single best such
symbol is the Fibonacci structure, its meta-symbol being the Golden Mean.

Persephone (Proserpine), daughter of Demeter (a.k.a. Ceres; note the De-
prefix; the name is perhaps cognate with the Cretan deai, &quot;barley,&quot; which is
akin to beer and bear and which Homer describes as &quot;white&quot; in contrast to
&quot;red&quot; wheat, which latter word, however, means &quot;white&quot;), spends the wintry
1/3 (or ½) of the year in the underworld with Zeus's youngest brother Hades
(i.e. Aï-Des; their middle brother, by most accounts, being Poseidon), who
has abducted her. The couple Hades and Persephone is akin to the Menelaos
and Helen.

And then there's Perseus, he of the winged shoes (or winged heels). His
mother is Danae, princess of Argos, which is located in the Pelopennese. She
had been imprisoned by her father Acrisius in a bronze tower, for according
to prophecy the 1st son of Danae would kill Acrisius. Zeus, however, visited
the imprisoned Danae as a shower of golden rain and thus fathered Perseus.
King Acrisius banished Danae and young Perseus, but eventually Perseus did
kill Acrisius - by accident, with a discus throw. Perseus beheads the Gorgon
Medusa and carries her head nailed to his shield. That head is winged, and
it brandishes wild boar's tusks. One direct look from Medusa's eyes will
turn a man (but not, as Camille Paglia points up, a woman) to stone - i.e.
it will petrify him. Medusa, whose name means &quot;the Queen,&quot; is equivalent to
Kolyo, whose posterior aspect, recall, writhes with snakes and worms. Every
creature is ultimately bound to Kolyo by a snare about a foot or a noose
about the neck, or simply by their intestines. Likewise Medusa is further
equivalent to the Sphinx, from the Greek sphiggo, &quot;to strangle.&quot; Born of the
incest between the half-serpent Echidna and Echidna's dog-son Orthus, the
Sphinx has a woman's head, a griffin's wings, and a lion's claws and rump.

Returning home with the head of Medusa, Perseus saves Andromeda, daughter of
Cassiope and Cepheus. Cassiope had bragged that Andromeda is more beautiful
than the Nereids, who in turn complained to Poseidon. Poseidon therefore
caused a great flood and sent the sea-serpent Cetus to destroy Cepheus's
kingdom. Cassiope and Cepheus therefore chained Andromeda to the Pegasus
Square, as a sacrifice to Poseidon. The scene of Andromeda's rescue by
Perseus is said to be near Lydda, precisely where St. George rescued his
king's daughter by capturing the red dragon to whom she was about to be
sacrificed. Both Andromeda and the princess in the St. George story are
equivalent to Core/Persephone. (Hence the name Perseus.) Precisely as
Andromeda and the princess women have been sacrificed, Core has been
abducted by Hades. Andromeda/princess/Persephone is the Nymph aspect of
Kolyo/Kali - i.e. the proto-mythological triple-Goddess - rendered scapegoat
in accord with the Great Reversal. Her trial represents the reduction of the
Maiden-Nymph-Crone (Core-Aphrodite-Demeter, White-Red-Black) to the
Maiden-Crone (Core-Demeter, White-Black). The flood sent by Poseidon
corresponds to the 4-black-horse chariot driven into the Earth by Hades
(bearing Core), the 4-white-horse chariot - which horses I'm sure were
originally black-white-red, like the color of the unicorn's horn, and like
Zeus-as-bull who carried off Europa from Phoenicia to Crete, and like Minos'
s heifer, and like Io the (Sun-)cow - being a symbol of Poseidon. Indeed,
the Red/Dionysian Poseidon's White/Apollonian horses were surely lunar bulls
according to proto-mythology, the horse being domesticated after the bull
(wild aurochs), and the New, extremely crescent Moon of the western-evening
sky being considered the source of all water; likewise Demeter's animal
symbol is proto-mythologically the cow rather than the horse. Said flood and
chariot are both remembrances of the cataclysmic comet and/or meteor
impact(s) which seem to have been the chief cause of the Great Reversal and
for which the essentially feminine priestly class (which class of course
included both male and female members) was blamed. As
Andromeda/princess/Core was sacrificed to the
sea?serpent/4-bovine-charioteer, that Red/Dionysian &quot;monster&quot; was himself
sacrificed by the powers of the Great Reversal. White/Apollonian Zeus and
Black/Baroque Hades carried the day, Zoroastrian style, Good-versus-Evil
style, moo-cow style. The complex, 3-pronged hero was all but destroyed.

This coup against the Red/Dionysian is retold from the perspective of Hera,
the female power of the Great Reversal. She causes the Titans (i.e. the
sea-serpent/dragon/Poseidon noted above) to kill, dismember and eat
Zagreus-Dionysus (i.e. the original Dionysus, who is the son of
Core/Andromeda/princess by Zeus-in-the-form-of-a-snake and is the male
equivalent of the Nymph or more generally of the triple-Goddess, i.e. he is
the triple-God, the 3 Man, the Tree Man, the Green Man). You see, almost
immediately upon his birth Zagreus-Dionysus had clambered atop his father
Zeus's throne and played at throwing thunderbolts (i.e. wielding the
sacrificial, double-headed axe). Zeus soon decided that Zagreus-Dionysus
should indeed rule the world. Hera, wife of Zeus, was strongly opposed to
the idea - presumably because, after the fashion of the Great Reversal, she
doesn't want her husband to give up power. The Titans, to perform their
dirty deed against the infant, whiten their (red) faces with chalk. And
while Zagreus-Dionysus is looking at himself in a mirror (which is among the
several &quot;toys&quot; the Titans distract him with, including a cone, a
bull-roarer, golden apples, a knuckle-bone, and a tuft of wool, erion), the
Titans set upon him with knives. The child evades them by transforming
intially into Zeus-in-a-goat-skin, then Kronos-making-rain, then a lion,
then a horse, then a horned serpent, then a tiger, and finally a bull: 7
forms in all. It is this bull form of Zagreus-Dionysus that the Titans at
last cut to pieces and devour raw. Enraged at this transgression, Zeus
blasts the Titans to ashes with his thunderbolt (i.e. with his double-sided
axe). Thus Hera realizes a political coup that she certainly determined to
happen: she has used the Titans to eliminate - or, more accurately, reduce -
the threat which is Zagreus-Dionysus, and she has done so knowing that the
further prime consequence will be the destruction of the Titans (i.e. the
proto-mythological people of the world). From the ashes of the Titans arise
the initial &quot;humans&quot; - i.e. people living under the mantle of the Great
Reversal, as slaves of sorts, like Hera's handmaiden Iris, messenger goddess
of the wind and of the (7-colored) rainbow, who is a Nymph and thus
equivalent to Zagreus-Dionysus as well as to Hermes. Hera is that simple
aspect of Woman which is (naturally and otherwise) in complicity with the
Great Reversal (and with any such reversal). She is not complete; she is
White-Black, Maiden-Crone, rather than White-Red-Black, Maiden-Nymph-Crone.

Her most famous reduction of the triple-God is her reduction of the hero
Hercules. This is the deep sense in which Hercules/Herakles is named: &quot;Hera'
s Glory.&quot;

Frazer reports that versions of the St. George-versus-the-dragon story &quot;have
been found from Japan and Annam in the East to Senegambia, Scandinavia, and
Scotland in the West.&quot; Indeed, the picture of Andromeda chained to the
Pegasus Square recalls the Aztec virgin mother Chimalman who dies giving
birth to Quetzalcoatl and who is now in the heavens as &quot;the Precious Stone
of Sacrifice.&quot; The Pegasus Square constellation at bottom of the World Tree,
is also the sacred place for childbirth, the mother's vagina corresponding
to the well, the sacred spring containing the fish/serpent, the little
Achilles/Erichthonios/Hephaistos. A mother dying in childbirth dies upon the
sacred altar, as a proper sacrifice. As such, every proto-mythological human
sacrifice was made precisely where the person initially entered the world,
or at least upon a precise analog of that place. Natural abortions were
brought here as well, for burial beneath the sacred tree. Of course the most
premature of these abortions evidenced the fact that people originally have
gills, that we are fish of sorts. (Ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny.) This
fact corresponds to the practice of planting fish (recall the Pisces
constellation, which surrounds the Pegasus Square) to fertilize domesticated
seeds. A fish-man - like the founders of Gilgamesh's Uruk - represents the
full ontogeny of a human being as well as the full spectrum of
proto-mythological sacrifice. We can trace this spectrum forward in time,
from the Zodiacal age of Gemini (man-man, i.e. twins), to Taurus (bull-man),
to Aries (ram-man), to Pisces (fish-man), thus charting the Great Reversal
as well as the concomitant demise of sacrifice and likewise the
infantilization, the White/Apollonianization of humanity, a process which
completes itself in the Zodiacal age of Pisces, the age that nevertheless
contains the Christian reversal of the Great Reversal (hence the famous fish
symbol of Christians) and terminates in the age of Aquarius, Cepheus atop
the World Tree.

The name Cepheus, recall, derives from the Aramaic Qepha (&quot;Cephas&quot;), meaning
&quot;rock.&quot; This was the nickname of the apostle Simon - son of Jonah, and
initial bishop of Rome, i.e. initial pope, initial &quot;papa&quot; of the Christians.
Hence Simon's Greek name is Peter, from the Greek petra, meaning &quot;rock.&quot;
(Cepheus is also known as the &quot;gardener,&quot; i.e. the Green Man.) Cepheus's
wife Cassiope - i.e. Cassiopeia, Cass-Io-Pe - corresponds to Quetzalcoatl's
&quot;sister,&quot; Quetzalpetlatl, just as Hera is at once Zeus's wife and sister.
This correspondence further suggests the aforenoted cognacy between the
Aztec Quetzal-, &quot;feathered,&quot; and the Indo European castle. The word castle
is in fact cognate with the name Cassiope. As I said earlier, a castle is a
sort of eagle's nest and is linked to the word castrate, as in Zeus's father
Kronos castrating his own father Ouranos. The ultimate mythological castle
is that atop the World Tree. King Cepheus and Queen Cassiope occupy this
castle-in-the-air, this Olympus, which is akin to Rome's Vatican Hill (from
the Latin vates, &quot;seer, prophet,&quot; linked to the Old Irish faith, &quot;seer,
poet&quot;).

The rock-like, eagle-like, Phoenix-like, priestly nature of Cepheus and of
Peter resonates in terms of their equivalency with Aquarius the water
gatherer, he of the water-fire duality. Aquarius, you see, doesn't just
gather water for drinking; he is also the rain-maker/gatherer, Zeus the
&quot;storm god.&quot; As such Aquarius is akin to a great mountain, mountains clearly
being gatherers of clouds and rain. Recall that Perseus is conceived when
Zeus visits Danae - who is imprisoned in a stone tower - as a shower of
golden rain. Perseus later carries the head of Medusa, whose gaze turns men
to stone. Throughout mythology, rock and stone are intimately connected not
only with fire but also with rain, just as storms feature lightning (i.e.
fire), thunder (i.e. rock-like rumbling), and rain. Again, Sir George
Frazer, from his Golden Bough:

Stones are often supposed to possess the property of bringing on rain,
provided they be dipped in water or sprinkled with it, or treated in some
other appropriate manner. In a Samoan village a certain stone was carefully
housed as the representative of the rain-making god, and in time of drought
his priests carried the stone in procession and dipped it in a stream..
Among some tribes of Northwestern Australia the rain-maker repairs to a
piece of ground which is set apart for the purpose of rain-making. There he
builds a heap of stones or sand, places on the top of it a magic stone, and
walks or dances round the pile chanting his incantations for hours, till
sheer exhaustion obliges him to desist, when his place is taken by an
assistant. Water is sprinkled on the stone and huge fires are kindled.. In
Manipur, on a lofty hill to the east of the capital, there is a stone which
the popular imagination likens to an umbrella. When rain is wanted, the
rajah fetches water from a spring below and sprinkles it on the stone. At
Sagami in Japan there is a stone which draws down rain whenever water is
poured on it. When the Wakondyo, a tribe of Central Africa, desire rain,
they send to the Wawamba, who dwell at the foot of snowy mountains, and are
the happy possessors of a &quot;rain-stone.&quot; In consideration of a proper
payment, the Wawamba wash the precious stone, anoint it with oil, and put it
in a pot full of water. After that the rain cannot fail to come. In the arid
wastes of Arizona and New Mexico the Apaches sought to make rain by carrying
water from a certain spring and throwing it on a particular point high up on
a rock; after that they imagined that the clouds would soon gather, and that
rain would begin to fall.

. On Snowdon there is a lonely tarn called Dulyn, or the Black Lake, lying
&quot;in a dismal dingle surrounded by high and dangerous rocks.&quot; A row of
stepping-stones runs out into the lake, and if any one steps on the stones
and throws water so as to wet the farthest stone, which is called the Red
Altar, &quot;it is but a chance that you do not get rain before night, even when
it is hot weather.&quot; [Llyn Dulyn is thought to be an extinct and fathomless
volcano. Shepherds in the area liked to say that the appearance of a dove
near the lake signaled the descent of a beautiful but wicked woman's soul to
the underworld.]

. At various places in France it is, or used till lately to be, the practice
to dip the image of a saint in water as a means of procuring rain. Thus,
beside the old priory of Commagny, there is a spring of St. Gervais, whither
the inhabitants go in procession to obtain rain or fine weather according to
the needs of the crops. In time of great drought they throw into the basin
of the fountain an ancient stone image of the saint that stands in a sort of
niche from which the fountain flows. At Collobrières and Carpentras a
similar practice was observed with the image of St. Pons and St. Gens
respectively. In several villages of Navarre prayers for rain used to be
offered to St. Peter, and by way of enforcing them the villagers carried the
image of the saint in procession to the river, where they thrice invited him
to reconsider his resolution and to grant their prayers; then, if he was
still obstinate, they plunged him into the water ..

The people of Crannon in Thessaly had a bronze chariot which they kept in a
temple. When they desired a shower they shook the chariot and the shower
fell. [Auriga/Erichthonios/Hephaistos is supposed to have invented the
chariot to compensate for his lameness (or his snake-tail; i.e. his
sacrificed, fish-like nature).] Probably the rattling of the chariot was
meant to imitate thunder; we have already seen that mock thunder and
lightning form part of a rain-charm in Russia and Japan. [Recall that the
name Auriga means &quot;ear,&quot; as in Earwicker.] The legendary Salmoneus, King of
Elis, made mock thunder by dragging bronze kettles behind his chariot, or by
driving over a bronze bridge, from which he hurled blazing torches in
imitation of lightning. It was his impious wish to mimic the thundering car
of Zeus as it rolled across the vault of heaven.. Near a temple of Mars,
outside the walls of Rome, there was kept a certain stone known as the lapis
manalis. In time of drought the stoned was dragged into Rome, and this was
supposed to bring down rain immediately.

. Rain-making chiefs always build their villages on the slopes of a fairly
high hill, as they no doubt know that the hills attract the clouds ..

. Similarly speaking of the South African tribes in general, Dr. Moffat says
that &quot;the rain-maker is in the estimation of the people no mean personage,
possessing an influence over the minds of the people superior even to that
of the king, who is likewise compelled to yield to the dictates of this
arch-official.&quot;

In the present light, the following collection of pe- words is worth
surveying: peacock (sacred to Iris, messenger goddess, goddess of the
rainbow); perd (P-I-E for &quot;fart&quot;); petroleum (from the Latin petr + oleum
oil); petit; pelt; pelvis; pendulum (from the Latin pendere, &quot;to hang&quot;);
pesto (from the Latin pinsere, meaning &quot;to pound&quot;); penis (from the Latin
for &quot;tail&quot;; the penis rises and falls, just like the Phoenix); peculiar
(from the Latin pecus, &quot;cattle&quot;); pecuniary (from the Latin pecunia,
&quot;money&quot;); penny (from the Old High German pfennig, &quot;coin&quot;); penta (&quot;five&quot;);
pensive (from the Middle French penser, &quot;to think,&quot; and the Latin pendere,
&quot;to weigh&quot;); Penatës (&quot;inner ones&quot;, dieties of the storeroom; such as those
Rachel steals from Laban, and such as those Aeneas carries from Troy),
peripatetic and peregrination (from the Latin noun peregrinus, which
derisively means &quot;a person who wanders through the countryside&quot;:
per-agrinus, from per or par meaning &quot;equal,&quot; and ager, meaning &quot;field,
territory, district&quot;; but recall from the Odyssey: &quot;All wanderers and
beggars come from Zeus&quot;); and let's not forget pen (as in &quot;pig pen,&quot; or &quot;pig
sty,&quot; or &quot;writing utensil,&quot;&quot;stylus&quot;; the Welsh noun pen meaning &quot;head&quot;).
Note that the word stylus is closely related to the name Styx. Vico: &quot;All
gods swore by the river Styx, which was the source of all springs.&quot; The ink
of a pen is equivalent to the waters of the Styx. Joyce considered himself
&quot;Shem the Penman.&quot; Some of the earliest writing pens were feathers. Indeed,
the word pen derives from the Latin penna, meaning &quot;feather,&quot; and is related
to the Greek petesthai, &quot;to fly,&quot; as well as pteron, &quot;wing,&quot; and piptein,
&quot;to fall,&quot; as well as to the aforenoted Latin pes, &quot;foot,&quot; - which is why
godly wings are attached to feet, specifically to heels. Thetis dipping
Achilles in the Styx is akin to a writer dipping her pen in ink - or
pressing her fingers on a keyboard!

Earlier I spoke of pens in relation to Ptah/Hephaistos, peasants, slaves,
and boundedness in general. The Romans called the persons whom they captured
and enslaved vernae. Therefore the languages of these peoples were called
vernaculars. A slave born in a master's house was called a verna. This word
is linked to the Hittite weriya, &quot;to call, name,&quot; and likewise to the Latin
verbum and the English word. Similarly verna is linked to the English
world - from the Old English wer, &quot;man,&quot; and eald, &quot;old&quot; - as well as to the
aforementioned Anglo Saxon wyrd, the Latin vertere, &quot;to turn,&quot; and hence to
the English virile, verve, virgin, vertex, vortex, verge, verdict and of
course vernal. Recall the Sanskrit verbal root vr-, &quot;to cover, encompass&quot;;
it implies liquidity as well as circularity and burial and is of course
closely related to Kolyo. This root was employed to refer to ponds and
marshes, to greenness - hence the Latin viridis, &quot;green,&quot; and the English
verdure and verdant - and especially to the springs of the high providential
forest groves. As such, vr- is also the root in the name of the Indian god
Varuna, lord of the cosmic structure: dharma, me, etc. Likewise vr serves in
the name of the Iranian god V?r??ra?na, whose is represented - like
Ares/Mars and like Medusa - as an aggressive wild boar with sharp fangs and
tusks.

King and peasant, like father and son, are both bound in terms of the cosmic
structure. In Greek this structure is called Logos, meaning &quot;word,&quot;&quot;idea,&quot;
and &quot;thing.&quot; The Hebrew word for &quot;word&quot; - translated into the Greek logos
and into the Latin verbum - also means &quot;deed.&quot; Similarly the Sumerian me
means &quot;cosmic order&quot; as well as &quot;to act, behave,&quot;&quot;to be, say, tell,&quot;
&quot;battle,&quot; and &quot;ideal, norm, function, office, responsibility, oracle,
decree.&quot; In ancient Egypt the lord of the cosmic structure is Thoth. In fact
the 1st month of the ancient Egyptian year - which month is equivalent to
our September, the proto-mythological springtime (i.e. the ver, verge, New
Year) - is called Thoth. The cosmic structure - Logos, dharma, me, maat,
moira, tao, call it what you may - is focused chiefly on the autumn season,
the season of sacrifice. Maat, measurer and scribe in one, Thoth is
typically portrayed as an Ibis - a bird famed for its ability to catch fish
and snakes in marshes and in ponds - who holds a stylus. The chief center
for the worship of Thoth in Egypt was Hermopolis, originally known as &quot;City
of the Group 8,&quot; i.e. City of the Ogdoad. Thoth is called &quot;Master of the
City of the Ogdoad.&quot; As the Greek name Hermopolis attests, the Greeks
identified Thoth with Hermes. Likewise Thoth is equivalent to Upuat, Osiris,
Hercules, Pelops, Ganymede/Aquarius, Aeneas, Attis, Jesus, Caesar, and
Galahad. The Ogdoad are the 8 gods - 4 male and 4 female - primal to
Hermopolitan theology: Nun-Naunet (the primeval Abyss), Huh-Hauhet
(formlessness, chaos), Kuh-Kauket (darkness), Amen-Amaunet (the hidden).
This city marked the boundary between upper and lower Egypt, Shemau and
To-Mehu, south and north, respectively.

The Egyptians represented the difference between structure and order in
terms of the difference between Thoth and Ptah. Douglas Hofstadter, in his
Pulitzer Prize-winning and truly luminous Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal
Golden Braid, draws such distinction in terms of an &quot;Inviolate Level&quot; and a
&quot;Tangled Hierarchy.&quot; Sartre, in Being and Nothingness, draws a similar
distinction in terms of water: &quot;Troubled water remains water; it preserves
the fluidity and the essential characteristics of water; but its
translucency is 'troubled' by an inapprehensible presence which makes one
with it, which is everywhere and nowhere and which is given as a clogging of
the water by itself.&quot; Likewise Saussure places the categories &quot;langue&quot; and
&quot;parole&quot; at bottom of his theory. Schelling described the pith of every
moment as a &quot;rotating movement&quot; between 2 poles: a &quot;first potential,&quot; in
which a contractive, &quot;gravitational,&quot;&quot;pronominal,&quot; intensifying force
predominates, leading toward unity (i.e., toward Seyn; Schelling employing
this spelling rather than the typical Sein); and a &quot;second potential,&quot; in
which an expansive, &quot;predicative,&quot; extensifying force dominates, leading
toward plurality (Seyendes). And Leibniz referred to experience in general
as &quot;derivative&quot; in contrast to &quot;primitive.&quot; The various differentiations
between potential and actual, eg. between potential energy and kinetic
energy, are also akin to the difference between structure and order.

The god Ptah - whose name is cognate with Peter - is the Red/Dionysian,
creator/created aspect of God. He is equivalent to Hephaistos, Erichthonios,
Achilles, Yahweh, Nehushtan, Lucifer, Poseidon, Shiva, Adam, and Noah, among
many others. Ptah is typically depicted as bound, for he can only create his
order in terms of the cosmic structure. The chief center for the worship of
Ptah was Memphis, near Heliopolis (On) at the Nile's delta. This location
corresponds to the fallen state of God, but likewise and moreover it
corresponds to the moment of resurrection; which is to say it corresponds to
the constellation Hercules on the universal clock. This Earthly location
especially contrasts with the intermediate, suspended, Golden location of
Hermopolis, which location corresponds to the more rarefied character which
is Thoth (Hercules/Pelops/Ganymede/Aeneas/Jesus/Caesar/Galahad). It also
contrasts with the high location of Thebes, chief center for the worship of
the hidden/absent aspect of God: Amen, Jupiter (sometimes called Dictë
Jupiter, as in Father Dis and the P-I-E Dyeus), Zeus. In a fundamental sense
this extreme meets the other; i.e. the source of the Nile meets its delta,
closing the circle, with the intermediate Hermopolis corresponding to the
true, complex pith of every monad, every moment, i.e. to Polaris.

The Egyptians nonetheless emphasized the similarity between Thoth and Ptah.
Not only did they represent Thoth as an Ibis, a famed fish-catcher; the
hieroglyph for their primal sea-serpent Kneph (a.k.a. Cnuphis) was identical
to the hieroglyph for Thoth. From the mouth of Kneph issues an egg
containing Ptah. (Which is to say, the Egyptians put the chicken before the
egg.) This myth calls to mind the 2 eggs birthed by Leda, each containing
twins fathered by Zeus in the form of a swan. The name and character Kneph
is of course cognate with the P-I-E Neptno, the Hebrew Nehushtan, the Latin
Neptune, and the Celtic Nechtan.

We'll do well to consider some further occurrences of the prefix ne- and its
cognates kne-, cnu-, nu-, no- and the like. A nexus, for instance, is a
place where things come together. Likewise we have the P-I-E nemeton,
meaning &quot;sanctuary,&quot; and the P-I-E -no, meaning &quot;known as,&quot; which is linked
to the aforementioned verna (etc.) as well as to the aforementioned the
Middle High German kuze, &quot;owl,&quot; and Old English kuth, &quot;known,&quot; as in
Athena - patroness of Odysseus (a.k.a. Noman, who akin to Naamen, i.e.
Adonis, Attis), goddess of knowledge and war - whose symbol is the owl.
Among the other close cognates are nectar, noose, knot, knuckle, note,
knowledge, gnosis, nous, numen, nose, neo, new, neck, necro, negative, no,
needle, nettle, net, nether, nest, nut, nuptial, nerve, nefarious, knell,
need, nine (9), night, and knight. Some cognate names are the Nereids,
Nerthus (the Teutonic Earth goddess), Nessa, Nestor, Nemi (as in the &quot;King&quot;
of the Wood at Nemi; see the beginning of Frazer's Golden Bough), the Nemean
lion, Nephthys, Nefertiti, Nemesis, Mnemosyne (&quot;Memory&quot;; by Zeus, Mnemosyne
gives birth to the 9 Muses: Clio, Euterpe, Thalia, Melpomene, Terpsichore,
Erato, Polyhymnia, Urania and Calliope), Nessus (the centaur who effectively
kills Hercules), Noah, Núadu, Nodens (the Fisher King, keeper of the Holy
Grail), Noman, Nun, Nut, Nonoalco (the mountain on which Quetzalcoatl's
sister dwells), November, and Joyce's Nolan.

In this light note that the initial and greatest of the famous 12 labors
with which Hera burdens Hercules - her husband Zeus's son by Alceme, the
queen of Thebes, which queen and city-state represent the
(proto-mythological) triple-Goddess - is the job of killing the Nemean lion.
Hera, recall, is queen of the Great Reversal. The emblem of this Thebes,
recall, is a lion; and Hera is this White-Red-Black lion-queen reduced to
the White-Black queen of the Great Reversal. Hera's aim is to maintain the
status quo - especially the power of the reigning king, namely her husband
Zeus. Thus she attempts to enslave the rest of society, especially Zeus's
greatest son Hercules, who in a sense is the greatest threat to Zeus's
power. Zeus, the myth says, had fathered Hercules because he needed a mortal
hero to help him battle the Giants. Zeus intended for Hercules to become the
ruler of Mycenae or Tiryns. Knowing, however, that Hera would feel severely
threatened by the boy's existence, Zeus tried to mollify her by naming
naming Herakles, &quot;Hera's Glory.&quot; Hera was not amused. She eventually caused
Hercules to go temporarily insane (á la Attis), during which spell he
murdered his own wife Megara and their 3 sons (rather than emasculating
himself, as Attis did). The Delphic Oracle instructed Hercules that to pay
for this crime Hercules had to indenture himself to a lesser man whom had
already been promoted over him by Hera: King Eurystheus. Thus the 12 labors
put to Hercules by Eurystheus.

Hercules eventually died at the hands of his 2nd wife, Deianira - for whom
he had had to battle the river god Achelous. Shortly after the pair married
they needed to cross a river. The centaur Nessus - again, note the Ne-
prefix - offered to help. But in so doing, Nessus tried to rape Deianira.
Infuriated, Hercules mortally wounded the centaur, who as he was dying
instructed Deianira that if ever she wanted to be sure of Hercules' love she
should now gather together his spilled, centaurian blood and semen and save
this poisonous mixture for the occasion. When á la Cybele and á la Hera she
eventually did suspect Hercules of an affair, she soaked a favorite shirt of
his in the poison. Donning the shirt, Hercules soon experienced the
agonizing pangs of impending and ineluctable death. On further advice of the
Delphic Oracle (considered the medium of Apollo), the hero ordered a pyre
built so that he could quickly thereupon end his suffering. But Hercules did
not actually die atop the pyre, for Zeus directly granted the hero
immortality, transporting him to Olympus just like he eventually did with
Ganymede and, later, with Aeneas. Indeed, the now immortal Hercules married
Hebe, cup bearer of the gods, who upon this marriage was replaced with
Ganymede/Aquarius. Clearly Hercules is more of a Thoth/Hermes character than
a Ptah/Hephaistos character.

The Nemean lion, initial victim of Hera's machinations, is the son of Typhon
(Python, Tityos, Set) and Echidna (half woman, half serpent); alternatively
he is the son of Zeus and Selene (supposedly the Moon goddess, but more
truly the Sun goddess, eg. P-I-E Swel, Phrygian Cybele, Latin Sol, German
Sonne). This beast is said to have set the Nemean forest ablaze by spewing
forth fire from its huge jaws. When Hercules kills the lion, he dons its
impenetrable skin as a suit of armor (similar to those produced by
Hephaistos) and eventually drapes that skin over his left arm and presents
it to Apollo. The Nemean lion represents the proto-mythological mother
goddess, who is reduced by the Great Reversal to the White/Apollonian
Hera/Juno. Indeed, each of the 12 Herculean labors targets a certain primary
symbol of proto-mythology. After killing the Nemean lion, Hercules is sent
by Eurystheus to fight Hydra, a snake with 9 heads (1 of them immortal).
Succeeding in this 2nd labor, the otherwise Golden hero is then sent to
capture the Ceryneian hind, a stag sacred to the goddess Artemis. Succeeding
again, his next task is to capture the Erymanthian wild boar, which he does
using a net. He is then compelled to clean the dung from the horse stables
of Augeus, son of the Sun god. Next he is dispatched to remove the
Stymphalian birds (note the Sty- prefix) from the Peloponnese. Following
this 6th labor he is sent to capture the bull which Minos had failed to
sacrifice to Poseidon and which in turn sired the Minotaur. Following this
victory he is ordered to subdue the man-eating mares of Diomedes. Succeeding
again, he is sent to fetch the girdle (belt or necklace) of Hippolyta, queen
of the Amazons. (This girdle recalls those of Anath, of Artemis, of and the
mother goddesses of India and Mexico, which are festooned with severed
heads.) Of course he again succeeds. Subsequently he is dispatched to
capture the red cattle of the supposedly predatory Geryon, who has 3 heads,
3 bodies and 6 hands and rules a western isle. This success is met with yet
a penultimate order: to confiscate the golden apples of the Hesperides,
female guardians of the fruit which Gaia gave to Hera when Hera became
married to Zeus. Succeeding again, Hercules is lastly sent to capture the
3-headed hound Cerberus, guardian of the underworld.

Speaking of labors, a peasant's day's worth of labor is called an opera,
this from Ops, the Sabine (i.e. pre-Roman) goddess of sowing, abundance,
wealth, harvest, etc. Ops (equivalent to the Greek Rhea) is the wife of
Saturn (Kronos). These are the parents of Jupiter (Zeus) and Juno (Hera).
Hence, too, we have the term aristocrat, for the Greek equivalent of the
Latin optimus is aristos. The op- prefix is identical to the English ob-,
which means &quot;around, on, against, resistance.&quot; Both are related to the
snake, as in Ophiuchus (the serpent bearer) and Erichthonios (the
snake-tailed boy, i.e. the lame initial king of Athens), and Shakespeare's
Ophelia (who drowns herself).

This brings us back to Hephaistos, the lame (i.e. bow-legged) divine smith,
equivalent to the Egyptian Ptah. The Latin equivalent is Vulcan, whose
smithy is located under Mt. Aetna on Sicily; the Cretan equivalent is
Velchanus, which older name is more obviously cognate with Bel and Anu.
Vulcan is widely associated with Maia and Vesta (Cybele and Hestia),
goddesses of the hearth. The Siberian equivalent is the shaman. Santillana
and von Dechend write in their Hamlet's Mill: &quot;The Yakuts claim: 'Smiths and
shamans come from the same nest,' and they add: 'the Smith is the older
brother of the Shaman.' &quot; (Bruce Chatwin presents the initial part of this
quote in one of his remarkable books.) These authors further note that &quot;the
many iron pieces which belong to the costume of a shaman can be forged only
by a blacksmith of the 9th generation, i.e. 8 of his direct ancestors must
have been in the profession. A smith who dared forge a shamanistic outfit
without having those ancestors would be torn by bird-spirits.&quot; Bruce
Chatwin: &quot;In nomadic society the smith was not the underprivileged artisan
of civilization; for the Mongols he was a hero and a free knight. Shamanism
has always been connected with mastery over fire; metallurgical secrets are
handed down within a closed circle associated with magic and sorcery.&quot; In
fact Vulcan was celebrated by the Romans every 23 August - i.e. at the
beginning of the proto-mythological New Year season. We know next to nothing
about this Volcanalia, save that people drove animals into a fire, seemingly
as substitutes for human sacrifices. Similarly yet in marked contrast the
chief festival of Ops - the Opeconsiva, &quot;Wealth from Planting&quot; - was
celebrated on 25 August; but only her priests and the Vestal virgins
participated, the officiating priest wearing a white veil.

Coincidentally, St. Patrick-the-Elder is said to have died on 24 August 465
CE. Likewise the death of St. Patrick of Nevers, whose relics are stored at
Glastonbury, is celebrated on this day. St. Patrick-the-Younger, on the
other hand, who supposedly arrived in Ireland in 432 CE and whose famous day
of honor is 17 March, has been identified with Palladius, a deacon from the
leading family in Auxerre, who in 429 CE prompted Pope Celestine I to send
an envoy to Britain to counter the spread of Pelagianism. Stemming from the
British monk Pelagius, this proto-mythological theology pointedly countered
Augustinianism by emphasizing the value of free will and likewise the
individual's natural ...
