Not even a week had passed since we
had to put our little Terrier, Daisy, to sleep.
We were both in such despair over
the ordeal that it was hard to even function. Even though we had three
other girls to watch over and who depended on us for everything, we
still missed Daisy so much.
One night our doorbell rang. A lady
from down the street stood there holding what appeared to be a very
frightened little brown dog. She asked if he happened to belong to us.
&quot;No,&quot; we said, and we had not seen
him around in our neighborhood before. She said she would keep him until
she could find the rightful owner. But, the next morning he was seen
running between our house and the neighbor's house across the street. It
was obvious the poor little guy was scared to death.
We tried to get close to him, but he
darted off. I had to get to work, so I told my neighbor that if they
caught him, they could put him in our dog pen in the backyard so he
would be somewhat safe and would not get run over.
I came home at noon, and lo and
behold, there he was looking at me with fear in his eyes. I put a bowl
of fresh water out and tied the gate shut so he couldn't escape and went
back to work.
I thought to myself, this is NOT
what I need right now. I had enough to deal with after having lost one
of our dogs.
I got home and fed the other three
and put a dish of food out in the pen for our little visitor, which he
immediately devoured like he hadn't had anything to eat for days. I
couldn't leave him out in that pen all night, so into the house he came.
The other three sniffed him and wondered who we had dragged into their
house. (I had done dog sitting for other people when they were away, so
the crew was used to new animals visiting from time to time.) Everyone
seemed to settle down after a bit and found their own space.
I had taken a picture of him that
first day, and had made up flyers to take to all the vet offices in
town, hoping to find his owner. I contacted the police and the radio
stations.
Days went by and there was no reply
from any of my contacts. I began to think someone may have just dumped
him. He was such a sweet little guy and got along fine with the other
dogs and caused no trouble. He was perfectly house trained and loved to
sit in the chair in the evening and be close to someone.
I had myself convinced that we could
not keep him. But a week went by and watching him, he reminded me in so
many ways of Daisy with his actions and antics. Daisy had been blind and
deaf. But in so many ways this dog acted exactly like Daisy would have
if she could see and hear.
Finally, one day I asked my husband
if we could keep him. I told him I felt it was like Daisy had sent him
to us from the Rainbow Bridge because she knew we would give him a good
home.
Surprisingly, he said he had thought
the same thing. Could it be that our little girl had come back to us in
the form of this little dog? Is there such a thing as destiny? I don't
really know, but you would be hard pressed to make me believe otherwise
considering what had transpired over the course of only two weeks.
We named him Charlie, and we are
amazed every day how much he is our Daisy brought back to life, at least
to us.
We still miss our little girl and
always will, but Charlie keeps amazing us with his new tricks. No one
came forth to claim him, so I know in my heart that he was sent to us.
By chance? I don't think so.
Believe what you will, but we know
what we believe.
