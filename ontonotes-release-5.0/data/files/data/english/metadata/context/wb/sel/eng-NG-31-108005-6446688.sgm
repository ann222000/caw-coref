I made a nice pot of soup today; it's chilling and waiting for tomorrow.
Meanwhile, please help me.  I added a can of original Rotel which I assumed
(yes, I know) was not as hot as the others.  Mercy.  Wonder what I can add
to the soup to absorb some of that heat?  Potatoes?  Rice?  some cotton
batting?  I need help.  Polly

Could you use this batch as a base for other dishes and
freeze it in small portions?  Then use SOME as a base for
other soups or maybe pasta sauces.

Polly,
Just bring that nasty ol' soup to me. LOL. I was raised in Texas and
lived most of my life in Phoenix and I have a taste for hot and then
some. But, if you want to take some of the heat out, add
starch.Probably wont' make a whole lot of difference unless you can
increase the volume a significant amount (without adding any more of
those "mild" Rotel cans. And, like most things cooked with hot stuff,
it's likely to get hotter as it sits.

Good luck, and try eating it with some good cornbread while drinking
lots of cold milk.

Hugs,
Sunny

I think I just heard this on a cooking show or read it in a magazine.  Add
sugar!  Sounds so obvious, doesn't it?  I don't think my brain would have
gone there all by itself though!

Polly,
No help with the "hot" situation, but wanted to share a project our
DS1 has been involved with for a couple of years.
He lives in Boston and is single.  One of his friends organized a
-soup swap-.  There were 10 people involved last year.
Each person made 6 quarts of homemade soup.  Not chili or the common
kinds unless it had a special twist or seasoning.
Freeze all 6 quarts individually in containers.
The host has snack foods ready and all spent a short time visiting and
then drew names for the first, second etc. choices of soups.
All went home with 6 quarts of 6 different soups they would probably
never have tried otherwise.  They included the recipes.
One person was a Russian immigrant and she brought borscht (sp?).  It
was a great hit.
There was a prize for first soup gone and last to be chosen.  A wooden
spoon.
There are 8 swaps planned this year in 5 different cities.

Sort of sounds healthier than cookie swaps.

Piggy backing cause I just had a thought.  Dairy.  Dairy will absorb that
heat, so maybe a little milk or plain yogurt or sour cream.  Or have a big
glass of milk next to you while you are eating that soup.

Turn in into a big batch of soup by doubling everything else.

My mom swears plain tomatoes helps - I dunno her food it HOT

Dairy - serve the soup with cheese/sour cream on top.

This gives an entirely new meaning to the expression 'soup base'.  I put
half of the hot soup in the freezer, added sugar and other good stuff to the
rest.  If none of that works, I guess I can just hunt for a Texan or a black

A dollop of sour cream on each serving might help.
I use Rotel MILD ... it did nicely in the soup I made
last week. I think I need to make a soup today. Does
anyone have a FANTASTIC soup recipe that is low fat??

Most soups that are not cream-based, such as good old vegetable beef,
are pretty low fat. I don't have my vegetable beef soup recipe on the
computer; I'll try to send it later. Here are a couple others that I
make. The potato soup is a favorite that I have been making for years.
The Black Bean is a newcomer to my recipe files.

Potato Soup

Amount  Measure       Ingredient
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
1/4           cup  oil
2               cups  chopped onions
1                cup  diced carrots
1                cup  chopped celery
6             medium  potatoes -- diced
1              quart  stock
2          teaspoons  salt
1           teaspoon  marjoram
1           teaspoon  dill seed
1/2      teaspoon  paprika
1           teaspoon  caraway seeds
2               cups  instant dry milk

Heat the oil in a large soup pot; saute the onions, carrots, celery, and
potatoes until the onions are transparent.

Add the stock, salt, and spices (not the milk powder). Bring to a boil,
cover, and cook until the potatoes are very tender but don't fall apart.

Remove 1-1/2 to 2 cups of the soup liquid from the pot. Stir the milk
powder into this liquid, using a wire whisk. Return the mixture to the
pot and simmer about 1 minute.

This recipe came from a vegetarian cook book, so they called for
vegetable stock. I have always used chicken broth. For variety, I
sometimes cut up a ring of smoked sausage; stir into the soup and heat
through.

Howdy!

From the peppercorn/hot chiles site:

The "heat" in chili peppers is created by an alkaloid compound called
capsaicin. This heat is best "put out" with a rich dairy product such as
whole milk, sour cream, or ice cream.
http://www.bulkpeppercorns.com/chili_peppers

S-i-l drinks milk w/ her hot chiles, f-i-l sprinkles sugar on too-hot
peppers.   Neither has (yet) been consumed by flames.   &lt;g&gt;

Good luck!

You could try the potatoes, I know for sure they absorb extra salt. But
it shouldn't effect the taste even if it doesn't absorb the hot part.
Don't eat it after though. Let us know what you tried and if it worked.

Not food related but: Dr had me to mix  Capzasin creme with Eucerin creme to
put on my aching hip (tendonitis) since nothing else helps (put on plastic
gloves and use a cotton ball to apply so you don't get it on your hands and
into your eyes.--she gave me a couple of gloves.) I'm out the $ for the
creme. Just made the hip hot but didn't cut the pain...so it's back to the
Pain Dr and asking for cortisone shots...this has been going on since Nov.
Not constant but whenever I "do" . Need to break the pain cycle now that the
back has settled down.YAY!
Can't eat hot forever and a day so I can't help with the food part.

I wish I was headed your way so I could take that soup off your hands.  I
add Rotel to soup and stew a lot of times just to spice it up some.  It is
hard to find something that is too hot for DH &amp; I.  We are the people buying
the hot Pace Picante Sauce, lol.  We usually have to settle for the medium
because sometimes the store doesn't carry it.  Could you just dilute it with
water or a can of regular diced tomatoes?

Ah, yes indeed, the original does vary.  I've been cooking with it for
years - but they must have had a gang of partying Texans doing the mixing
the day the can I used in the soup was peppered.  Yeeeowwww!  I did take
half of it to the freezer and add mild things to the rest.  Maybe I better
go check and see if the frozen soup has eaten the freezer shelf away.  That
is a potent concoction.  Polly

Yep.  I usually end up with sour cream on a lot of things because DH
likes food a lot spicier than I do. Even though I am a born and raised
in AZ gal I don't like food to be too spicy, and the older I get the
more sensitive to the "heat" I seem to get. The sour cream cools it
down, and pineapple juice helps cut the oils in your mouth too. (and
tastes good with the chilies. &lt;G&gt; )
Adding rice or potatoes will help by adding bulk which will "spread the
heat out" sort of.  And freezing usually increases the heat factor.
You may want to essentially make your soup batch considerably larger to
cool it off.
Good luck.

I make a good onion soup, but not necessarily low fat &lt;G&gt;.
If you use powdered milk to make your "cream" soups they are much lower
in fat.
I love potato soup.
Cook cubed potatoes and chopped onions (you can also add other
vegetables if you wish like carrots/celery/??) in a minimum of water
until tender. Drain and save the liquid. In large pot make a roux with
oil/butter/margarine, flour and seasonings. Stir milk powder into the
cooking liquid and add water to make enough for your soup.  Add liquid
to roux, stirring or whisking as you go.  Liquid should thicken very
quickly. Add Vegetable mix and any other additives you wish.  (Chicken,
smoked sausage, frozen green peas or corn, well drained sourkraut, or
what ever you wish.)  Heat through and serve with a dab of butter in
each bowl.

You can also make a "clear" potato soup. Use a good stock as a base,
lots of potatoes and other vegetables. Works very well as a "meatless"
dish if you want one.

There is a company based in northern Arizona that makes soup "mixes".
These have good, quality ingredients, freeze dried so that all you have
to do is add water, sometimes a bit of milk too, and perhaps some
additional meat to make a meal. They are good. I added some rice to one,
and over estimated the amount to add. It ended up almost like a goulash
but it was very good.

My latest everyone-asks-for-the-recipe soup is a lentil / chicken sausage
soup.

Take a couple of pieces of chicken sausage (spicy is good), chop it up fine,
and brown it at the bottom of your soup pot in a teaspoon of oil. (Chicken
sausage usually doesn't have enough fat to brown without the oil.) While
that's browning, finely dice an onion, two carrots, and four stalks of
celery. (exact proportions don't matter). Pop them into the pot and cook
over medium heat until the onion is translucent.

Once the onion is cooked, dump in 8 cups of vegetable broth, a 16 ounce can
of diced tomatoes, a cup of red wine, and three cups of brown lentils. I
usually add some herbs like a bay leaf and basil, too. Fennel is also nice.
Cook 30-40 minutes. Salt before serving. (I can never tell how much salt
until the lentils are cooked.)

This soup freezes very well, and is an excellent vegan soup if you omit the
chicken sausage. If you like a "creamy" soup, use the boat motor (ie stick
mixer) on it for a couple of minutes. I'm usually too lazy to bother, and
besides, I like the whole lentils.

I don't use it often, but I know people who do. IM(NS)HO, it all depends on
the kind of cooking you do. :)

Mine was a gift, and probably in the $35 range -- if there's an advantage to
the fancy ones, I haven't heard about it, and I watch all the really geeky
cooking shows. Mine has worked great for years (ten plus?), but then I only
use it a couple of times a year. I do like that it's easy to use and easy to
clean, which are two musts in my kitchen.

We had one which my youngest son used to mix his milk shakes and
smoothies. He took it with him to his new home. It did a great job on
his drinks but I could never figure out how to dismantle it to wash it
properly. Just ran it in some sudsy water and rinsed it. He never died
from any bugs on the blades so I guess it is OK. My major method of
cooking is to remove something from the freezer and put it in the
microwave. This technique does not require a mixer of any type. The
son who still lives at home has a large stand mixer which he uses
often and enjoys. My second method for cooking is to take leftovers he
has prepared and warm them in the microwave. Some ask why we allow our
30 year old son to live at home. He doesn't pay rent. Instead he buys
all the groceries and does 75% of the cooking. Who would want a
personal chef to move? No, he didn't learn to cook from me. He tells
people he had to learn because I never cooked. This is a stretch but I
certainly never cooked from scratch like he does. He learned most of
it by watching the cooking shows on TV.

That's exactly my method of cleaning it. If you do it right away, it's a

I love mine -Braun, cost 20 euros which at the time (3 years ago) was about
$25. I like to puree soups, and transferring hot liquid to a blender or
processor was always mad, bad and dangerous. And waiting for the soup to
cool seemed just too slow. The blade part comes off and can go in the

I have a stick mixer and I don't use it as much as I thought I would. My DH
likes his soup chunkless, so I always blend his up and leave mine chunky. I
don't like how it does mashed potatoes - too whipped for my taste. I
wouldn't spend any more then the minimum amount for one. I got mine at BB
and Beyond with a 20% off coupon.

Here's the cauliflower soup we like...

Creamy Cauliflower Soup

4 C chicken broth
1 head cauliflower - washed and sliced thinly; about 4 cups
1 medium potato peeled and diced
1 medium onion diced
salt and white pepper to taste
grated cheddar cheese

Combine vegetables and broth in a large pot.  Bring to a boil and then
reduce to simmer.  Cook until the vegetables are soft (20-30 minutes).
Puree in blender or food processor.  Season to taste and stir in cheese.

&gt; We had one which my youngest son used to mix his milk shakes and
&gt; smoothies. He took it with him to his new home. It did a great job on
&gt; his drinks but I could never figure out how to dismantle it to wash it
&gt; properly. Just ran it in some sudsy water and rinsed it. He never died
&gt; from any bugs on the blades so I guess it is OK. My major method of
&gt; cooking is to remove something from the freezer and put it in the
&gt; microwave. This technique does not require a mixer of any type. The
&gt; son who still lives at home has a large stand mixer which he uses
&gt; often and enjoys. My second method for cooking is to take leftovers he
&gt; has prepared and warm them in the microwave. Some ask why we allow our
&gt; 30 year old son to live at home. He doesn't pay rent. Instead he buys
&gt; all the groceries and does 75% of the cooking. Who would want a
&gt; personal chef to move? No, he didn't learn to cook from me. He tells
&gt; people he had to learn because I never cooked. This is a stretch but I
&gt; certainly never cooked from scratch like he does. He learned most of
&gt; it by watching the cooking shows on TV.

I've seen several in the kitchens of various friends.  Only one was
outside of it's original box, and it was used for making soap, not

That's so funny Debra.  DD was at Costco with me one day and
convinced me we should buy one.   We did and nearly a year later
it is still in the box.  Maybe I'll pull the darned thing out
and use it for Kathy's recipe.

I used mine for soap too :)  Other than that, gravy, cranberry sause,
instant drink mixes (ie liquid lunch meal replacemnt things)  anything that
requires mixing really like sauces and salad dressing.  Mine is small...
just a stick with a cord on it... of all the weird things I won, that is the
least cluttery  lol..  The cheap $35 one should be fine... mine lived
through a whole tonn of soap making and it still works just fine.

I use mine a lot - for soup - easier than the liquidiser where I have to
do it in batches. They are really a liquidiser, but you put them into
the container of lumpy liquid to be smoothed, rather than pouring the
lumpy liquid into a liquidiser which can get messy. They aren't (or mine
isn't anyway) intended to chop up dry food like a food processor.

When my original cheap stick broke after about 7 years, DH bought the
replacement. I had asked him just to get another basic one, but it now
came with a mini food-processor. You just unscrew the stick blade-end
(like you do to wash it) and slot the motor end of the handle into the
top of the little processor. Makes small amount of breadcrumbs, wizzes
up parsley, chops onions - the same thing as the big processor but just
for small quantities that the big machine sneers at. I thought I would
never use it, but it is so useful for quantities which are too small for
any other gadget. The blades of this little add on are slightly
different shape to the stick end.

The only thing with the stick is - keep it towards the bottom of the
pan/bowl. If you don't its like leaving the lid off a liquidiser - you
and your kitchen will not look pretty!

ah well, My kids dont like it chunky for some reason.  So I make the
cranberry sauce, and once all of them have popped, I use it to make them
smoother.  But this is for the homemade sauce, not the stuff in a can...
cause that might just be considered weird  lol
