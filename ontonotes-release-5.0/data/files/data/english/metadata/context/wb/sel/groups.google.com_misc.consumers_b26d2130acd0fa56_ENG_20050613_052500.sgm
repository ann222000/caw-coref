Excerpts from
http://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/13/business/13consuming.html

Among all the hurdles faced by General Motors, the biggest threat to
their marketing plans may be the unforgiving nature of consumer
behavior.

However objective we imagine ourselves to be, most of us do not judge
a product solely on its merits. Instead, we are easily influenced by
the people around us. And there is nothing wrong with this. It is
probably a smarter way to make decisions than relying on only our own
opinions.

But it does make life hard for struggling companies. They thrash about
in a feedback loop, where the collective wisdom about their problems
can overwhelm the chances of any single new product. No matter how
good it is, the 2006 Pontiac Solstice will not start as a blank slate.
Car buyers will be thinking about it in the context of everything they
and their friends know about GM vehicles.

The reputations of GM and Ford have fallen so far that one-third of
their sales go to employees, the friends or relatives of employees, or
rental-car companies, all at almost no profit.
