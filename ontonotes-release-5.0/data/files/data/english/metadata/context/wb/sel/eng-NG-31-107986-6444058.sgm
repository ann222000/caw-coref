Hello,

I have read many guides on extract brewing and have come up with
different answers each time (suprise suprise):
1) Brew and follow the kit with approx 1kg of corn sugar (glucose)
2) Brew with 2 cans of extract (3 lbs) and no corn sugar
3) Brew with 1 can and 1kg of dry malt extract (DME)

I do understand that each will produce a different flavour and the
correct answer is "what do you prefer?"; however, I am curious if
anybody has any experience with the real differences in flavour each
will impart?

I ask because I have started down the road of doing some testing.   In
10 L batches I have/am planning on brewing the following:

1) Coopers Dark with Glucose  (In the fermeneter)
2) Coopers Dark with molasses (Conditioning in bottles)
3) Coopers Dark with DME (thinking)
4) Coopers Dark with Coopers Dark (thinking)

My problem is simple, I only have 1 can of coopers dark left.   Now, in
10L batches I could make 2 batches using a sugar additive (corn, DME,
etc) or 1 batch of #4 (double LME).  But I cannot do both #3 and #4.
So I was thinking that maybe this forum would have my answers for me.

Thanks
Lance

P.S.  Has anybody tried the non-concentrated extracts created locally
around here?  E.g.
Magnotta's http://www.festabrew.com/
http://www.thebrewhouse.com/
Others?

Maybe locally made concentrated LME cans such as:
vineco's cans:

Others?

Those numbers sound more like a full 18 L

Using the sugar will thin out your brew adding alcohol with out body.
Doubling up on the Coopers dark will make a dark brew with more body.
Substituting 1kg DME will give you results similar to two cans. The
difference would be a slightly lighter color and body if it is Light or
Extra Light DME.

One other difference could be increased bitterness of the brew when using 2
cans if the cans are prehopped.

Thank you for your response.  You are right, the numbers were for full
batches, not the 1/2 batches.

Given that the kits all (mostly) recommend using sugar, have they
already taken into account the thinning effect of that sugar to create
their desired style?  Would it be a good idea to take that information
into account when making beers?  Eg, when using a "light" can it is
good to use sugar to place emphasis on the light, but when making a
dark or a stout, using DME, or 2 cans would place emphasis on the dark?

Really here is where my questions come from.   I like good beer.  I am
new to homebrewing, so I'll liken it to baking bread (of which I do a
lot of).

When making a loaf of bread, you have a vast range of choices in
starting ingredients.  For example, I can use all-purpose flour or
bread flour.  The difference is in flavour, texture, and colour of the
bread.  So similar to our choice in sugar with beer.   I choose
all-purpose flour simply because it is MUCH cheaper than bread flour
while the improvement in flavour with bread flour is somewhat
diminished (IMO).

I am trying to determine these limits for myself.   Corn sugar is MUCH
cheaper than DME or LME, but would DME/LME produce a much better beer?

So I suppose in short, my question is not so much about qualifying the
difference between sugars, but quantifying the difference.

Thanks again, your post did clear up a lot.

Well,

I have decided to go ahead and answer my own questions.   I have three
10L batches going starting with the Coopers Dark LME  cans (1/2 can per
batch).

1) 500 ml of molasses
2) 500 grams of corn sugar
3) 500 grams of light DME

In a few (several?) weeks when they are all bottled and conditioned, if
people want to hear my tasting notes, just shoot me an email/response.
Otherwise you can see the progress on my beer-notes webpage:
http://www.risstech.com/doku.php?id=recipes:beerstart
You would be looking at batch #8, #9, and #11.

Also if you want to know my tasting notes for different priming sugars,
look up batch #3

Lastly, note, I am not a beer judge.  I do have a fair bit of
wine-tasting experience, but beer is a fairly different beast, so I am
still learning.  You should ignore my rating column though as this will
include my personal taste/desires for beer styles including the quality
of beer.

Enjoy and thanks for all the help.

Lance

I'd say you made the right choice and I think you'll find you have three
very different beers. There is no better way of finding what the differences
are than to taste it yourself. Molasses adds it's own flavor to a brew but
with choice 2 and 3 you'll get a good example of the difference between an
all malt brew and one that has been brewed with sugar.

Each will be different.  There's not "right" or "wrong".

1) Will produce a beer with more alcohol than 2, and be drier than 3.
2) Will produce a beer with less alcohol than 1 and 3.
3) Will produce a beer with more alcohol than 2, but be sweeter than 1.

Alot of it has to do with what extract you're using.  Some extracts are
designed to be used with sugar, other's are designed to be used with
DME.

Definitely.  Or, at least make sure you understand what will happen if
you decide to not follow the recipe.  IE, it's OK to deviate from what
they say, but it's best to understand the implications so that you can
come up with a successful recipe on your own.

It's not really about light/dark but rather about the amount of body,
maltiness, and residual sweetness balanced against the hops.

If you're new, then experimenting may lead to better beer than the original
recipe, or it may lead to mistakes.  It's up to you whether you'd rather
do that or follow their recipe.  If you have an idea of what you're aiming
for, it may help.  IE, what did you think about their recipe if you've
followed the instructions before.  Would you want something drier or
sweeter than it made?

Corn sugar and DME/LME are entirely different things.  Corn/cane sugar
will ferment out nearly 100%, leaving alcohol but not much flavor.  The
DME/LME is where the flavor/body of the beer comes from.  You can use
them in any combination you want to achieve the type of beer you are
aiming for, but corn sugar is not a direct replacement for extract,  It
serves a different purpose.
