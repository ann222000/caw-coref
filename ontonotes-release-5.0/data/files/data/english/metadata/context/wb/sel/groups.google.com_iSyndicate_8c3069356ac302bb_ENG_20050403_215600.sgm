The fact is, living the internet lifestyle can be accomplished. You
really can get all of that bling bling that the heavy hitters tell you
about. It's all here for the taking.

You know what I'm talking about when I say internet bling bling, right?

A guy figured out the formula to online success and is out in his villa
in Mexico, drinking Mai Tai's and smoking a Monte Cristo while he works
on a laptop.

A woman's e-zine took off, and with the release of her new book, she is
out in the Aspens with her husband and some champagne.

A college kid is playing around on eBay and stumbles across a goldmine,
then buys a brand new Mercedes from money he made with his computer.

A former pizza delivery guy just raked in $33 Grand over the weekend by
sending out an e-mail to a few people that wanted to hear what he had
to say.

It's happening all around you. People are cashing in on all of this
bandwidth, and they are doing it easier than they ever expected. Once
you know the formula to this thing, the profits are almost automatic.
Really, it's kind of a guilty pleasure.

Millions of people are sitting in their cars as you read this letter,
either trying to get home from work, or on their way to work. They're
dealing with 25 MPH traffic and a bunch of car fumes. I think that the
most tragic part is that this goes on every single day for countless
years!

Meanwhile, we're sitting back watching numbers being added to our bank
accounts. I say numbers because that's what we see when we get paid.
It's like punching in numbers on a calculator, with the only difference
being that our numbers are spendable income!

HAVE A GREAT DAY !
