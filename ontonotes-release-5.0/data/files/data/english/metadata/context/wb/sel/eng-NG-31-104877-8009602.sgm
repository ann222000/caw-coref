Kalki - The Last Avatar of Vishnu

Kalki - The Last Avatar of Vishnu The Kalki Avatar is the only avatar
of Vishnu that is set in the future. It is an episode of speculative
prediction more than anything else, a validation of the ancient belief
of mankind that things are going to the dogs! The Kalki avatar is
supposed to do all the typical things an avatar does - beat up the bad
guys, restore cosmic balance and so on. There are however no adventure
stories to relate about him, his freedom of action is unrestricted
even if his mission is not.

The Kalki Avatar is a consequence of a belief that mankind is going
from bad to worse in this most degenerate of Yugas called the Kali
Yuga or Dark Iron Age. This is not a particularly original belief,
ancient Greece having the identical classification.

Many other cultures have minor variations on these four ages of human
mythical history. The Kali Yuga is going forward at full throttle now
but this apparently is not as bad as it gets. It is going to get much
worse before it is all over.

Kalki is the means of this cosmic clean up act.

...he will mount a white horse, brandish a flaming sword and wipe out
the bad guys and restore dharma. That is the agenda as set down in the
Vishnu Purana.Many people have noticed the similarity between Kalki
and the horseman of the Apocalypse

The Appearance of Kalki Avatar

(August 17, 1999)

On this day of the Sravana month sukla 6 (August 17), the appearance
day of Lord Kalki is observed according to the Pancaratra texts.
Famous as the last of the ten major avatara-s of Lord Vishnu, He has
yet to make His appearance in this cycle of time, a time so dangerous
that we are encouraged in the Srimad Bhagavatam to worship Him for
protection:

(According to some, He appears on Vaisakha sukla 12.)

kalkiH kaleH kAla-malAt prapAtu
dharmAvanAyoru-kRtAvatAraH

&quot;May Kalki-deva, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who appeared as
an incarnation to protect religious principles, protect me from the
dirt of the age of Kali.&quot;

This prayer becomes more and more relevant as the age of Kali and its
degradation progresses. In fact we are now approaching the 51st
Centennial of the Age of Kali in early 1999, which promises to be
interesting if one is inclined to believe astrological predications.
Regardless of the details, each and every year is a gradual step into
darkness and chaos.  Only the recitation of the name and pastimes of
the Lord Kalki and His incarnations can free us from the shackles of
the Age of Kali.

Although described elaborately in the Brahmanda-purana, the Bhagavatam
describes Lord Kalki's pastimes briefly:

.... At the end of Kali-yuga, when there exist no topics on the
subject of God, even at the residences of so-called saints and
respectable gentlemen of the three higher castes, and when the power
of governement is transferred to the hands of ministers elected from
the low-born sudra class or those less than them, and when nothing is
known about the  techniques of sacrifice, even  by word, at that time
the Lord will appear as the supreme chastiser.

Lord Kalki, the Lord of the universe, will mount His swift horse
Devadatta and, sword in hand, travel over the earth exhibiting His
eight mystic opulences and eight special qualities of Godhead.
Displaying His unequaled effulgence and riding with great speed, He
will kill by the millions those thieves who have dared dress as kings.

After all the imposter kings have been killed, the residents of the
cities and towns will feel the breezes carrying the most sacred
fragrance of the sandalwood paste and oher decorations of Lord
Vasudeva, and their minds will thereby become transcendentally pure.
When Lord Vasudeva, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, appears in
their hearts in His  transcendental form of goodness, the remaining
citizens will abundantly repopulate the earth. When the Supreme Lord
has appeared on earth as Kalki, the maintainer of religion, Saya-yuga
will begin, and human society will bring forth progeny in the mode of
goodness.

When the moon, the sun and Brhaspati are together in the constellation
Karkata, and all three enter simulatenously into the lunar mansion
Pusya--at that exact moment the age of Satya, or Krta, will begin.

Speaking of Kalki - and intimations of Kali Ma and the Kali Yuga, a

Dangling by our toenails 'oer a thousand-foot ledge
We're just cliff-hanging fools
Doing pirouettes on the razor's edge.

(quote, excerpts)

^^^^^^^^^

Kalki

In Hindu traditions, Kalki (Sanskrit:      ; also rendered by some as
Kalkin and Kalaki)

is the tenth and final Maha Avatara (great incarnation) of Vishnu the
Preserver, who will come to end the Kali Yuga, (The Age of Darkness
and Destruction).

The name Kalki is often a metaphor for &quot;Eternity&quot; or &quot;Time&quot;. The
origins of the name probably lie in the word Kalka which refers to
&quot;dirt&quot;, &quot;filth&quot; or &quot;foulness&quot; and hence denotes the &quot;Destroyer of
Foulness&quot;, &quot;Destroyer of Confusion&quot;, &quot;Destroyer of Darkness&quot;, or &quot;The
Annihilator of Ignorance&quot;.

Other similar and divergent interpretations based on varying
etymological derivations from the ancient Sanskrit language, including
one simply meaning &quot;White Horse&quot;, have been made.[1]

In the Buddhist Kalachakra tradition, some 25 rulers of the legendary
Shambhala Kingdom have the title of Kalki, Kulika or Kali-king.[2]

^^^^^^^^^

Maha Avatara

Hindu traditions permit numerous interpretations of what Avatars are
and to what purpose they act. Avatara means &quot;descent&quot;, and indicates a
descent of the divine awareness into manifestations of the mundane
form. Prominent religious leaders like Ramakrishna and Swami
Vivekananda are considered avatars by some, but in most Hindu
traditions there are only 10 Maha Avataras (Great Avatars), though the
identities of the most recent are sometimes disputed (i.e. Buddha and
Balarama). The Bhagavata Purana has a list of 25 Great Avatars.

All Hindu traditions declare all people to be manifestations of the
divine essence, the Atman, and Avatars to be individuals who are far
more acutely and extensively aware of this fact and its implications
than most, and who have entered the mortal realms voluntarily to teach
important truths to humanity, and who usually have extraordinary
abilities to aid in these roles.

^^^^^^^^^

Kalki's Appearance and the End of Days Prophecy

As with the prophecies of many traditions there is some debate within
Hinduism regarding the time of the appearance of the Kalki Avatar, as
well as the Divine purpose that this appearance will signify.

Popular images of the Avatar depict him riding a white horse with
wings known as Devadatta (God-given).

^^^^^^^^^

Modern variations of the Kalki prophecy

Theosophy and Christianity

Some Theosophists and New Age speculators have declared the Kalki
prophecies and those of the Maitreya Buddha of Buddhism, might
actually refer to one and the same individual,

and they and others have noted similarities of the Kalki prophecy to
the Rider on the White Horse in the Christian book of Revelation who
defeats the Antichrist. (Rev 19:11)

In such interpretations the sword of Kalki is equated to the two-edged
sword that proceeds from the mouth of this apocalyptic figure, and is
often symbolically interpreted to be the swordlike effectiveness of
words of truth against all manner of lies and deceptions.

Kalki is also said to war with the twin demons Koka and Vikoka,
similar to Gog and Magog who will attack the utopia established by the
rider on the white horse at the end of his thousand year reign on
earth. (Rev 20:7-8) Despite the similarities, the Kalki Purana states
Koka and Vikoka are simultaneously killed by Kalki (as well as their
master) long before the beginning of his thousand year reign as the
king of Shambhala.[5]

^^^^^^^^^

Origins of the Kalki prophecy

Copper engraving of Kalki from the late 18th century.
Copper engraving of Kalki from the late 18th century.

One of the earliest mentions of Kalki is in the Vishnu Purana, which
is dated generally to be after the Gupta Empire around the 7th Century
A.D.[3]

Vishnu is the Preserver, the sustainer of life in the Hindu trinity,
balancing the processes of Creation and Destruction.

Kalki is also mentioned in another of the 18 major Purana, the Agni
Purana. Agni is the god of Fire in the Hindu pantheon, and
symbolically represents the spiritual fire of life and the processes
of transformation. It is one of the earliest works declaring Gautama
Buddha to have been a manifestation of Vishnu, and seems to draw upon
the Vishnu Purana in its mention of Kalki.

A later work, the Kalki Purana, a minor Purana, is an extensive
exposition of expectations and predictions of when, where, and why it
is said he will come, and what he is expected to do. It has a very
militant perspective, and celebrates the defeat of traditions that are
deemed heretical for not adhering closely enough to the traditions of
the Vedas, such as Buddhism and Jainism. A few other minor Purana also
mention him.

It has been theorized that the Kalki Purana may have been written as a
Hindu response to the Buddhist prophecies within the Kalachakra Tantra
of many leaders with the name or title of Kalki.[citation needed]

Followers of Tibetan Buddhism have preserved the Kalachakra Tantra,
which forms a prominent part of the Tibetan traditions. In the
Kalachakra Tantra Kalkin is a title of 25 rulers of the mystical realm
of Shambhala. The aims and actions of some of these are prophesied in
portions of the work. The 25th Kalkin as an emanation of Manjushri is
said to brings about world-wide spiritual change. &quot;At that time, all
the families of men on the earth shall be fulfilled with dharma,
pleasure and wealth. Grain shall grow in the wild and the trees shall
bow with fruit - these things will occur.&quot;[4]

^^^^^^^^^

Claims of being Kalki

In the last few decades several leaders of relatively small religious
movements in India, and a few outside of it, including some women,
have at times claimed to be the Kalki Avatar of Hinduism, or their
followers have declared them to be Kalki.

* Some adherents of the Bahá'í Faith have interpreted the
prophecies as having referred to their messenger Bahá'u'lláh as the
Kalki Avatar.[6]

* The extreme right leader of Argentine, Alejandro Biondini, has
proclaimed he is Kalki. Many Nazi groups of LatinAmerica follow him.
Also the Ph.D. Harrell Rhome, spokesman of several USA Aryan groups,
supports that Biondini is The Kalki.[7]

* Gohar Shahi while at the same time claiming to be Jesus, Imam
Mahdi, and Maitreya Bodhistattva.[8]

I have many names, and none of them matter.
Names are not important.
To speak is to name names, but to speak is not important.

A thing happens once that has never happened before.
Seeing it, a man looks upon reality.
He cannot tell others what he has seen.
Others wish to know, however, so they question him saying,
`What is it like, this thing you have seen?'
So he tries to tell them.

Perhaps he has seen the very first fire in the world.
He tells them, `It is red, like a poppy,
but through it dance other colors.
It has no form, like water, flowing everywhere.
It is warm, like the sun of summer, only warmer.
It exists for a time upon a piece of wood,
and then the wood is gone, as though it were eaten,
leaving behind that which is black and can be sifted like sand.
When the wood is gone, it too is gone.'

Therefore, the hearers must think reality is like a poppy,
like water, like the sun, like that which eats and excretes.
They think it is like to anything that they are told it is like
by the man who has known it.
But they have not looked upon fire.
They cannot really know it.
They can only know of it.

But fire comes again into the world, many times.
More men look upon fire.
After a time, fire is as common as grass and clouds
and the air they breathe.
They see that, while it is like a poppy, it is not a poppy,
while it is like water, it is not water,
while it is like the sun, it is not the sun,
and while it is like that which eats and passes waste,
it is not that which eats and passes waste,
but something different from each of these apart
or all of these together.

So they look upon this new thing
and they make a new word to call it.
They call it `fire.'
If they come upon one who still has not seen it
and they speak to him of fire,
he does not know what they mean.
So they, in turn, fall back upon telling him
what fire is like.

As they do so, they know from their own experience
that what they are telling him is not the truth,
but only a part of it.
They know that this man will never know reality from their words,
though all the words in the world are theirs to use.
He must look upon the fire,
smell of it, warm his hands by it, stare into its heart,
or remain forever ignorant.

Therefore, `fire' does not matter,
`earth' and `air' and `water' do not matter.
`I' do not matter.
No word matters.
But man forgets reality and remembers words.
The more words he remembers, the cleverer do his fellows esteem him.
He looks upon the great transformations of the world,
but he does not see them as they were seen
when man looked upon reality for the first time.
Their names come to his lips
and he smiles as he tastes them,
thinking he knows them in the naming.

The thing that has never happened before is still happening.
It is a miracle.
The great burning blossom squats, flowing, upon the limb of the world,
excreting the ash of the world,
and being none of these things I have named
and at the same time all of them,
and this is reality, the Nameless.

Therefore, I charge you, forget the names you bear,
forget the words I speak as soon as they are uttered.
Look, rather, upon the nameless within yourselves,
which arises as I address it.
It harkens not to my words,
but to the reality within me, of which it is part.
This is the atman, which hears me rather than my words.
All else is unreal.
To define is to lose.
The essence of all things is the Nameless.
The Nameless is unknowable, mightier even than Brahma.

Things pass, but the essence remains.
You sit, therefore, in the midst of a dream.
Essence dreams it a dream of form.
Forms pass, but the essence remains, dreaming new dreams.
Man names these dreams and thinks to have captured the essence,
not knowing that he invokes the unreal.
These stones, these walls, these bodies you see seated about you
are poppies and water and the sun.
They are the dreams of the Nameless.
They are fire, if you like.

The world is so negative, Lyra, that even if the omnipotent,

they can do is collect a relatively small number of disciples, and

As I understand it, the legend of Kalki concerns Vishnu.  Vishnu is
one of the three lower Gods.  Incidentally, Christopher Marlowe
mentioned these three lower stages, also.  Vishnu would be interested
in &quot;reforming,&quot; the world, more than taking souls to the True Home.
Vishnu is at the level of the third stage (Causal Plane.)
Guruavatars, such as Christ, Shakespeare, Socrates, etc., are sent
from the fifth stage.  You and I came from the fifth stage, Lyra.

MM:
Reformers are sent, just as the Saviours are sent.  They do their
respective jobs.  Eventually, no reforming will stop the degeneration
of Kal Yuga.  That's interesting that Greeks believed in it, and now
you've pointed out the connection to Revelations, in the Bible.

Christophe Marlowe mentioned the &quot;dissolution.&quot;  All Saints have.
This is when the lower creation becomes so evil, that God decides to
just wipe it out and start over.  This is not due to happen for
426,000 more years, according to Hindu Chronology, as Kal Yuga is
generally considered to have started only 6,000 years ago.

In the Bronze age, just preceding Kal Yuga, Hindus say that man could
live 1,000 years.  This is corroborated to some extent in the Old
Testament.

Good message, Lyra.

&gt; The Appearance of Kalki Avatar

&gt; (August 17, 1999)

&gt; On this day of the Sravana month sukla 6 (August 17), the appearance
&gt; day of Lord Kalki is observed according to the Pancaratra texts.
&gt; Famous as the last of the ten major avatara-s of Lord Vishnu, He has
&gt; yet to make His appearance in this cycle of time, a time so dangerous
&gt; that we are encouraged in the Srimad Bhagavatam to worship Him for
&gt; protection:

&gt; (According to some, He appears on Vaisakha sukla 12.)

&gt; kalkiH kaleH kAla-malAt prapAtu
&gt; dharmAvanAyoru-kRtAvatAraH

&gt; &quot;May Kalki-deva, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who appeared as
&gt; an incarnation to protect religious principles, protect me from the
&gt; dirt of the age of Kali.&quot;

&gt; This prayer becomes more and more relevant as the age of Kali and its
&gt; degradation progresses. In fact we are now approaching the 51st
&gt; Centennial of the Age of Kali in early 1999, which promises to be
&gt; interesting if one is inclined to believe astrological predications.
&gt; Regardless of the details, each and every year is a gradual step into
&gt; darkness and chaos.  Only the recitation of the name and pastimes of
&gt; the Lord Kalki and His incarnations can free us from the shackles of
&gt; the Age of Kali.
">

MM:
It mentions the 51st Centennial of the Age of Kali.  That would mean
5,100 years since the beginning of Kal Yuga.  That's close to the
6,000 years figures that I mentioned.  Yes, the degeneration is
continuing, and it is inevitable.  We are like lost souls, shipwrecked
on an island.  We are in a state of confusion, and don't know what to
do.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Although described elaborately in the Brahmanda-purana, the Bhagavatam
&gt; describes Lord Kalki's pastimes briefly:

&gt; .... At the end of Kali-yuga, when there exist no topics on the

&gt; respectable gentlemen of the three higher castes, and when the power
&gt; of governement is transferred to the hands of ministers elected from
&gt; the low-born sudra class or those less than them, and when nothing is
&gt; known about the  techniques of sacrifice, even  by word, at that time
&gt; the Lord will appear as the supreme chastiser.

&gt; will kill by the millions those thieves who have dared dress as kings.

&gt; After all the imposter kings have been killed, the residents of the
&gt; cities and towns will feel the breezes carrying the most sacred

&gt; Kalki

&gt; In Hindu traditions, Kalki (Sanskrit:      ; also rendered by some as
&gt; Kalkin and Kalaki)

&gt;  is the tenth and final Maha Avatara (great incarnation) of Vishnu the
&gt; Preserver, who will come to end the Kali Yuga, (The Age of Darkness
&gt; and Destruction).

&gt; The name Kalki is often a metaphor for &quot;Eternity&quot; or &quot;Time&quot;. The
&gt; origins of the name probably lie in the word Kalka which refers to
&gt; &quot;dirt&quot;, &quot;filth&quot; or &quot;foulness&quot; and hence denotes the &quot;Destroyer of
&gt; Foulness&quot;, &quot;Destroyer of Confusion&quot;, &quot;Destroyer of Darkness&quot;, or &quot;The
&gt; Annihilator of Ignorance&quot;.
">

MM:
This is interesting, because Shakespeare often referred to Satan as
Time.  Vishnu is just another name for Satan, or Universal Mind.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Other similar and divergent interpretations based on varying
&gt; etymological derivations from the ancient Sanskrit language, including
&gt; one simply meaning &quot;White Horse&quot;, have been made.[1]
">

MM:
I've seen those white horses in the Causal Plane.  They are very
beautiful, and they will gallop across the sky.  It really means
Universal Mind.  They are aspects of Universal Mind.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; In the Buddhist Kalachakra tradition, some 25 rulers of the legendary
&gt; Shambhala Kingdom have the title of Kalki, Kulika or Kali-king.[2]

&gt; Maha Avatara

&gt; Hindu traditions permit numerous interpretations of what Avatars are
&gt; and to what purpose they act. Avatara means &quot;descent&quot;, and indicates a
&gt; descent of the divine awareness into manifestations of the mundane
&gt; form. Prominent religious leaders like Ramakrishna and Swami
&gt; Vivekananda are considered avatars by some, but in most Hindu
&gt; traditions there are only 10 Maha Avataras (Great Avatars), though the
&gt; identities of the most recent are sometimes disputed (i.e. Buddha and
&gt; Balarama). The Bhagavata Purana has a list of 25 Great Avatars.

MM:
Yes, these Avatars can come in the form of Divine Masculine or Divine
Feminine.  Due to God's grace, both forms are with us now.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; All Hindu traditions declare all people to be manifestations of the
&gt; divine essence, the Atman, and Avatars to be individuals who are far
&gt; more acutely and extensively aware of this fact and its implications
&gt; than most, and who have entered the mortal realms voluntarily to teach
&gt; important truths to humanity, and who usually have extraordinary
&gt; abilities to aid in these roles.

Exactly.

&gt; Kalki's Appearance and the End of Days Prophecy

&gt; As with the prophecies of many traditions there is some debate within
&gt; Hinduism regarding the time of the appearance of the Kalki Avatar, as
&gt; well as the Divine purpose that this appearance will signify.

&gt; Popular images of the Avatar depict him riding a white horse with
&gt; wings known as Devadatta (God-given).

&gt; Modern variations of the Kalki prophecy

&gt;  Theosophy and Christianity

&gt; prophecies and those of the Maitreya Buddha of Buddhism, might
&gt; actually refer to one and the same individual,

MM:
They might be confused.  Vishnu is from the third stage.  I suppose
Maitreya would descend from the fifth stage.  I don't know if anyone
will believe me, but Shakespeare was Buddha, also.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; and they and others have noted similarities of the Kalki prophecy to
&gt; the Rider on the White Horse in the Christian book of Revelation who
&gt; defeats the Antichrist. (Rev 19:11)
">

MM:
During a lower dissolution, Universal Mind is drawn back into the Holy
Spirit, which is its source.  You can call that defeating the Anti-
Christ.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; In such interpretations the sword of Kalki is equated to the two-edged
&gt; sword that proceeds from the mouth of this apocalyptic figure, and is
&gt; often symbolically interpreted to be the swordlike effectiveness of
&gt; words of truth against all manner of lies and deceptions.

&gt; Kalki is also said to war with the twin demons Koka and Vikoka,
&gt; similar to Gog and Magog who will attack the utopia established by the
&gt; rider on the white horse at the end of his thousand year reign on
&gt; earth. (Rev 20:7-8) Despite the similarities, the Kalki Purana states
&gt; Koka and Vikoka are simultaneously killed by Kalki (as well as their
&gt; master) long before the beginning of his thousand year reign as the
&gt; king of Shambhala.[5]

MM:
This is just a general period of time.  It means that even if a
reformer is sent, that the continued decline will occur.  It is
inevitable, but it could be delayed by 1000 years, as a general
figure.

&gt; ^^^^^^^^^

&gt; Origins of the Kalki prophecy

&gt; Copper engraving of Kalki from the late 18th century.
&gt; Copper engraving of Kalki from the late 18th century.

&gt; One of the earliest mentions of Kalki is in the Vishnu Purana, which
&gt; is dated generally to be after the Gupta Empire around the 7th Century
&gt; A.D.[3]

&gt; Vishnu is the Preserver, the sustainer of life in the Hindu trinity,
&gt; balancing the processes of Creation and Destruction.

&gt; Kalki is also mentioned in another of the 18 major Purana, the Agni
&gt; Purana. Agni is the god of Fire in the Hindu pantheon, and
&gt; symbolically represents the spiritual fire of life and the processes
&gt; of transformation. It is one of the earliest works declaring Gautama
&gt; Buddha to have been a manifestation of Vishnu, and seems to draw upon
&gt; the Vishnu Purana in its mention of Kalki.

&gt; A later work, the Kalki Purana, a minor Purana, is an extensive
&gt; exposition of expectations and predictions of when, where, and why it
&gt; is said he will come, and what he is expected to do. It has a very
&gt; militant perspective, and celebrates the defeat of traditions that are
&gt; deemed heretical for not adhering closely enough to the traditions of
&gt; the Vedas, such as Buddhism and Jainism. A few other minor Purana also
&gt; mention him.

&gt; It has been theorized that the Kalki Purana may have been written as a
&gt; Hindu response to the Buddhist prophecies within the Kalachakra Tantra
&gt; of many leaders with the name or title of Kalki.[citation needed]

&gt; Followers of Tibetan Buddhism have preserved the Kalachakra Tantra,
&gt; which forms a prominent part of the Tibetan traditions. In the
&gt; Kalachakra Tantra Kalkin is a title of 25 rulers of the mystical realm
&gt; of Shambhala. The aims and actions of some of these are prophesied in
&gt; portions of the work. The 25th Kalkin as an emanation of Manjushri is
&gt; said to brings about world-wide spiritual change. &quot;At that time, all
&gt; the families of men on the earth shall be fulfilled with dharma,
&gt; pleasure and wealth. Grain shall grow in the wild and the trees shall
&gt; bow with fruit - these things will occur.&quot;[4]

&gt; ^^^^^^^^^

&gt; Claims of being Kalki

&gt; In the last few decades several leaders of relatively small religious
&gt; movements in India, and a few outside of it, including some women,
&gt; have at times claimed to be the Kalki Avatar of Hinduism, or their
&gt; followers have declared them to be Kalki.

&gt;     * Some adherents of the Bah '  Faith have interpreted the
&gt; prophecies as having referred to their messenger Bah 'u'll h as the
&gt; Kalki Avatar.[6]

&gt;     * The extreme right leader of Argentine, Alejandro Biondini, has
&gt; proclaimed he is Kalki. Many Nazi groups of LatinAmerica follow him.
&gt; Also the Ph.D. Harrell Rhome, spokesman of several USA Aryan groups,
&gt; supports that Biondini is The Kalki.[7]

&gt;     * Gohar Shahi while at the same time claiming to be Jesus, Imam
&gt; Mahdi, and Maitreya Bodhistattva.[8]

&gt; I have many names, and none of them matter.
&gt; Names are not important.
&gt; To speak is to name names, but to speak is not important.

&gt; A thing happens once that has never happened before.
&gt; Seeing it, a man looks upon reality.
&gt; He cannot tell others what he has seen.
&gt; Others wish to know, however, so they question him saying,
&gt; `What is it like, this thing you have seen?'
&gt; So he tries to tell them.

&gt; Perhaps he has seen the very first fire in the world.
&gt; He tells them, `It is red, like a poppy,
&gt; but through it dance other colors.
&gt; It has no form, like water, flowing everywhere.
&gt; It is warm, like the sun of summer, only warmer.
&gt; It exists for a time upon a piece of wood,
&gt; and then the wood is gone, as though it were eaten,
&gt; leaving behind that which is black and can be sifted like sand.
&gt; When the wood is gone, it too is gone.'

&gt; Therefore, the hearers must think reality is like a poppy,
&gt; like water, like the sun, like that which eats and excretes.
&gt; They think it is like to anything that they are told it is like
&gt; by the man who has known it.
&gt; But they have not looked upon fire.
&gt; They cannot really know it.
&gt; They can only know of it.

&gt; But fire comes again into the world, many times.
&gt; More men look upon fire.
&gt; After a time, fire is as common as grass and clouds
&gt; and the air they breathe.
&gt; They see that, while it is like a poppy, it is not a poppy,
&gt; while it is like water, it is not water,
&gt; while it is like the sun, it is not the sun,
&gt; and while it is like that which eats and passes waste,
&gt; it is not that which eats and passes waste,
&gt; but something different from each of these apart
&gt; or all of these together.

&gt; So they look upon this new thing
&gt; and they make a new word to call it.
&gt; They call it `fire.'
&gt; If they come upon one who still has not seen it
&gt; and they speak to him of fire,
&gt; he does not know what they mean.
&gt; So they, in turn, fall back upon telling him
&gt; what fire is like.

&gt; As they do so, they know from their own experience
&gt; that what they are telling him is not the truth,
&gt; but only a part of it.
&gt; They know that this man will never know reality from their words,
&gt; though all the words in the world are theirs to use.
&gt; He must look upon the fire,
&gt; smell of it, warm his hands by it, stare into its heart,
&gt; or remain forever ignorant.

&gt; Therefore, `fire' does not matter,
&gt; `earth' and `air' and `water' do not matter.
&gt; `I' do not matter.
&gt; No word matters.
&gt; But man forgets reality and remembers words.
&gt; The more words he remembers, the cleverer do his fellows esteem him.
&gt; He looks upon the great transformations of the world,
&gt; but he does not see them as they were seen
&gt; when man looked upon reality for the first time.
&gt; Their names come to his lips
&gt; and he smiles as he tastes them,
&gt; thinking he knows them in the naming.

&gt; The thing that has never happened before is still happening.
&gt; It is a miracle.
&gt; The great burning blossom squats, flowing, upon the limb of the world,
&gt; excreting the ash of the world,
&gt; and being none of these things I have named
&gt; and at the same time all of them,
&gt; and this is reality, the Nameless.

&gt; Therefore, I charge you, forget the names you bear,
&gt; forget the words I speak as soon as they are uttered.
&gt; Look, rather, upon the nameless within yourselves,
&gt; which arises as I address it.
&gt; It harkens not to my words,
&gt; but to the reality within me, of which it is part.
&gt; This is the atman, which hears me rather than my words.
&gt; All else is unreal.
&gt; To define is to lose.
&gt; The essence of all things is the Nameless.
&gt; The Nameless is unknowable, mightier even than Brahma.

&gt; Things pass, but the essence remains.
&gt; You sit, therefore, in the midst of a dream.
&gt; Essence dreams it a dream of form.
&gt; Forms pass, but the essence remains, dreaming new dreams.
&gt; Man names these dreams and thinks to have captured the essence,
&gt; not knowing that he invokes the unreal.
&gt; These stones, these walls, these bodies you see seated about you
&gt; are poppies and water and the sun.
&gt; They are the dreams of the Nameless.
&gt; They are fire, if you like.

MM:
Very beautiful  Fantastic, Nessus.  The Nameless has been called
&quot;Anami Desh, meaning Nameless Country, or &quot;Anami Lok,&quot; meaning
Nameless Place.  No adjectives can do it justice.
