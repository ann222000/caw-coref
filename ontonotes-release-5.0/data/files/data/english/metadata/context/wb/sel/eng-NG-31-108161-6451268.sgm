I am looking for a program, costing less than $100, that will permit
me to be able to burn a DVD holding a series of pictures that could be
displayed in sequence, the display timing controlled by the use of the
DVD remote control.

I haven't noticed a commercial product that would provide
such a functional capability to a DVD, being played in a
standalone DVD player.  It can be done, using the
VM (Virtual Machine) Command Set, that is part of the
DVD Specifications.  This will require some understanding
of rudimentary programming concepts and practices.

There are a set of registers that can be used to setup/
manipulate timing within command loops (as opposed to
a simple timing loop, but that would work also).

http://www.dvd-replica.com/ Has the info to provide a
start.  If you are familiar with programming principles you
should have little trouble implementing what you describe.

The DVD authoring programs usually limit your ability to
directly apply the VM Commands, to varying degrees.
DVD Lab Pro provides some access as I remember, and
the free DVD Author project does also.  Then there are
the programs that let you manipulate a DVD structure
after it is made like PgcEdit or DVD ReMake.

I can't say for sure if the 'control by dvd remote' part is included,
but go take a look at DVD-Lab
http://www.mediachance.com/dvdlab/

I do recall that it has a slideshow function built in but do not recall
its ins and outs. (I peeked at the web site and now, it really dosen't.
You have lots of control over the timing of the slides, but can't do
them manually unless you create each slide in its own slideshow and set
it as a menu item. So, there is a clunky workaround.)

I have create a slide shows with Pinnacle Studio 9 using two different
methods.

The 1st is rather simple, but you must have a DVD player that allows you
to pause the DVD and step forward/backward a frame at a time.  A lot of
players do not have this function, and some only allow you to step
forward (but you cannot go back).

Using this method, you first copy all the photos into a new folder.
Adjust the setting in Studio to make the pictures 1 frame long, then you
drag all the pictures in the folder to the timeline.  From there you add
a menu and a few chapter stops.

The 2nd method is a little more complicated but will work on any DVD
player.   It also has the advantage of direct access to any picture.
Again, copy all the pictures into a single folder.  I then use Windows
to get a thumbnail view of all the pictures in the folder.  Set the
width of the form to have 5 pictures across.  Use the "Print Scrn"
button on the keyboard to paste the screen into any picture editing
software.  Trim the picture so that it contains only the 1st 20 pictures
(5 across and 4 down).  Next resize the picture so that it is 620x480
pixels (if you live in the US).  Save this picture using any name you
want.

Now in Studio, you use the picture you just created as the menu for the
first 20 pictures.  Place a button by each of the 20 pictures on the
menu.  Adjust Studio to make the pictures in the folder 3 seconds long.
Drag the 1st 20 pictures to the timeline and add a chapter stop at the
start of each picture.  When you play the disc, you can just let it play
thru to view all pictures, press pause for a longer view, or press the
chapter button to quickly skip to the next picture.  Or you can jump
directly to any single picture from the 20 on the menu.

Of course, you will want more than 20 pictures on a DVD, so you just
repeat the process for the next 20 pictures.  You will also have to
create a main menu that allows you to jump to each group of 20 pictures.

This is the exact process that I use.   However, I actually combine both
methods on the same disc.  That way, the disc will be playable, one way
or another, on any DVD player.  Also, the 1st method is best if you want
to view all the pictures, and the 2nd is useful if you are trying to
locate a particular picture.

DVD players I have seen can take a Kodak CD and play it as a slideshow.

You can try the software DVD Slideshow Builder which is very popular
now, many friends and I like it very much. It's very easy to create a
customized DVD with photos and videos, and we can add music,
transitions, and motion effects and make beautiful DVD menus. Also, we
can create .mp4, .wmv, .avi, .3gp slideshows for our iPod, Zune and
3GP Cell Phones, Youtube .etc.

You can download it free here

A specific tutorial which guides you use it step by step is here
