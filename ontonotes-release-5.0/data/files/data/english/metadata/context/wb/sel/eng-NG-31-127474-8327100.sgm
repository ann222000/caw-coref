Let me publicly apologize to Dev who may or may
not be Tim of 5-99 years of age who wants to kill
theists ,for flaming posts at him a lot more then I
would have if I had not been stirred to anger.
In retrospect it was quite unnecessary to the standards
I try and don't always live up to. What he said doesn't matter
as its what I did that counts as the canadian looney( buck)
stops here.
Tomorrow I shall probably go and make more mistakes.

I've heard this one before. I'm sure a few people will fall for it. I,
on the other hand, know you're just trying make yourself look superior
and haven't had any kind of &quot;change of heart&quot; at all. Just because
someone apologizes doesn't mean I have to buy it.

No of course not. Interesting that you have trust
issues as well. And of course there is no
concept of forgiveness included in not believing in god.

My point proven--this is not about you being nice to me at all. Nobody
who wasn't a moron couldn't see that you were just trying to make
yourself look more righteous than me--that's all. There's nothing
noble about that, asshole.

I thought about I what I had been posting for a day
and came  now to say that I was wrong. That I spoke
in anger to wound the best I could. That I had good reason
is irrelevant    I have cleared my part
in this as after all its a chat group not a beating I've laid on
you and what you do after that is about you not me.

Well I apologize for your mother being on crack. I guess that makes me
the righteous one now.

Your last post proved your true intentions to anyone who had any doubt
that you first one implied them, jackass. Quit being such a phony.

This must be what its like for the AA people having
to apologize for those who  they've wronged.
Have you ever flamed people in anger Dev and said things
you regretted later?

A sincere apology is not supposed to an sincere, veiled attack
designed to make you look better than the other person. If you had
ever given one you'd know that. But I think you are incapable of being
a human anyway so whatever--you can't be reasoned with.

You should never, ever, under any circumstances apologize to Dev.  It
drives him crazy.

As an aside, I wonder why the only apologies I see on AvC are directed
to Dev?

See? You know an apology is transparently insincere--even insultingly
insincere, even insulting in ways other than its very insincerity--
when even SEARCHER sees through it. It is obvious that this thread was
intended to be more of an insult than an apology. Mike L. is just a
maniac who refuses to acknowledge it because he's in his own little
distorted world.

So you were simply using apology in the _first_ sense of the word--as
a justification--while masquerading it as the second. Okay. I believe
that. But don't say you weren't pretending to express regret. Just
admit you were being dishonest in your insult directed towards me.

I am one of those who apologized to Dev after I had gotten into a
little flame war with him.  It was intended as an acknowledgement that
I had blown it and wanted to clear the air and start over.  I don't
personally have an issue with admitting I was wrong.  But I do
understand that some of the back-handed apologies that are seen here,
while admitting to failure, also blame the other for causing the
failure.  And that's really not much of an apology.

OldMan is either stupider than SEARCHER or he saw exactly what Mike
L.'s true intentions were--to make dishonest insults towards me in the
guise of self-righteousness. He just made that remark about how I hate
&quot;apologies&quot; to enable Mike L.'s bullshit. OldMan isn't an honest or
smart person after all. He never really learns anything and if you
push him he isn't really any different than Liam or Geloso or Keith or
the rest of the bullshitters. He's just as phony and has just as much
interest in a reasonable conversation.

that OldMan described.

To be fair, it's the sort of apology I make to my kids a lot:(

&quot;Look kids, I overreacted this morning when we were getting ready to
go to school and I spent ten full minutes screaming at you. However,
if you actually did as you were told and we didn't have to look for
shoes when we're supposed to walking out of the door and you put your
protractor away instead of leaving it in the bloody fridge...(etc.
etc)...then I wouldn't be a screaming harridan.&quot;

I have no doubt he was being a smartass--but read between the lines.
Use your understanding of why people post certain things and sometimes
its obvious what they're trying to do even if they don't state it
outright. You have an understanding of how this works and so does
OldMan--I think you just want to give him the benefit of the doubt
because he can be a likable guy sometimes. All reasonably intelligent
people can distort the truth without outright lying, even OldMan. I
disagree a lot with the idea that just because I believe that
evolution is a scientific fact I deserve to go to Hell, and that The
Bible is completely literal. I disagree with a lot of what that liar
OldMan says.

Now look at those last three sentences. Did I lie? All three
statements were true. You were tempted to maybe explain that OldMan
isn't entirely anti-evolution, weren't you? Or that he has stated that
he doesn't believe that The Bible is factually true? I never said
either. Maybe you did catch on to me--I've played this trick before.
But you see my point, don't you? &quot;Lying&quot; in the way that can be proven
semantically just really crappy deception. Good deception never has
any lies involved.

But just because you're good at it doesn't make it right. OldMan's
dishonesty should be judged based on its motives and intentions, not
merely semantics. I think he is really trying to distort where I'm
coming from and he knows it, and that tells me I have given him way
too much credit.

There are more blatant analogies I have made for stupider people, of
course. Mike L.'s apology, like many of the other apologies I have
received here, can be likened to &quot;I'm sorry for fucking your mother&quot;.
Now, if someone walked up to you and said &quot;I'm sorry your kids are
inbred retards&quot; and you got pissed and a lot of people around you
started bitching at you and saying &quot;you callous bitch, why can't you
accept an apology&quot;--well, you know. Some people on this group act like
that, and frankly I don't feel the need to be polite to them. That's
why I'm the evil one.

I _know_ he gets where I'm coming from. That's what bothers me.
Really, I wasn't talking specifically about this thread regarding
Oldie. OldMan has pulled this same shit, after our months of
discussions, where he knew better but made comments like that that he
knew were deliberately deceptive. It's always about shit we've been
over already so he always knows exactly what he's doing. He'd rather
pull this shit than have a real discussion, but yet bitches about me
being insulting because I'm an easier target--being _honest_ about
what you're saying always makes you an easier target. OldMan is a
fucking snake. It would be different if he was just trying to &quot;get my
goat&quot;, but a bunch of idiots clearly buy into his bullshit. More proof
that idiocy loves company, and dishonesty demands it.

&gt; &gt; &gt; they suddenly realise they don't look too good rathere than because
&gt; &gt; &gt; they're actually sorry. This may be an unfair generalisation; it's
&gt; &gt; &gt; based on Geloso (see below)

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As an aside, I wonder why the only apologies I see on AvC are directed
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to Dev?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;proudly&gt; Actually, I got one from Geloso once. He didn't mean it, as
&gt; &gt; &gt; he subsequently made quite clear, and he withdrew it, but I *did* get
&gt; &gt; &gt; one. And I seem to remember a thread title something like &quot;Apology to
&gt; &gt; &gt; cathyb&quot; but I can't remember who by or what for and I'm too lazy to
&gt; &gt; &gt; check.

&gt; &gt; &gt; I'm not up there with Dev, but I too can lay claim to apparently being
&gt; &gt; &gt; able to piss people off so much that they end up having to apologise,
&gt; &gt; &gt; too, sincerely or otherwise.

&gt; &gt; &gt; My parents would be so proud:)- Hide quoted text -
