I once drank 30 (approx. - there was approx. a litre of vodka present
too, possibly more) in one night and was only violently, violently ill
for a couple of days and really tired for a couple more.

I'd guess that the answer would be "more than that".

Incredibly dumb. If you combine alcohol and caffeine, you don't
actually feel particularly drunk. The drinks were on offer and I *am*
an alcoholic, so...

It was only an hour or so later - once I was home, that I hit the
floor like a sack of shit. I don't think I even moved for the next 16
hours, judging by the vomit and urine surrounding me. The scent of RB
was coming out through my skin for the rest of the day, I was shaking
like a leaf and there seemed to be virtually no fluid left to piss out
of my body (that which did flow forth stank of RB).

That is probably the closest I have ever come to accidentally killing
myself.

I can't even look at Red Bull now without feeling nauseous.

I'm still an alcoholic - I just haven't had a drink for coming up to
two years... ;)

Do you still get the urge to drink when bad shit happens?

Drink never, ever made things better. I never found the answer to my
problems at the bottom of a bottle - though I spent far too long
looking. Still, the temptation is there on occasion, in times of
stress. I have to fight it - it would be so easy to start off with all
that "I'll just get drunk this once, just to unwind and take my mind
off it" shit.

I wasn't attempting to 'yank' you. I've had a tough week with various
boring real life stuff.
