I have an antique sword (sabre) with which I have taken great pains to
remove the rust (which was extensive). Although the rust is all removed (I
used Naval Jelly), and the blade is smooth and unpitted (except near the
tip), there are black stains remaining where the rust was. Does anyone know
if these can be removed, and if so, how? Also, now that the rust is
removed, I would like to protect the blade. I am considering a light
coating of oil or perhaps petroleum jelly, but I am concerned that these may
damage the leather scabbard, which is in very good shape but showing its
age. Any thoughts?

The sword was used by one of my ancestors in the Crimean War (1853-56),
though it almost certainly was made before that. It is engraved with the
emblem of the &quot;Honorable Artillery Company&quot; which is the oldest regiment in
Britain. The Royal Insignia on the sword is &quot;GR&quot;, so it must predate the
Crimean War, which occured during the reign of Queen Victoria. Otherwise
the Royal Insignia would read &quot;VR&quot;. I am assuming the sword was fashioned
during the reign of one of the Georges preceding Victoria.

Dear Nora, I don't think a light coat of oil will do the scabbard any harm. I
would stay away from the petroleum jelly idea though. ;) You will want to
repeat this light oiling on a regualar basis, perhaps as infrequently as once
or twice a year, unless you happen to live in an extremely humid climate.
