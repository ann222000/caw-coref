Stop saving files as MP3. Use a player that handles a lossless format,
and put up with the reduced playing capacity (still way better than a
CD). Check Stereophile reviews for players that give reasonable results
with good earphones. The original iPod Shuffle gave good results from
the earphone connector (not much between DAC and socket).

A Hyundia will get you across town just as quick and easily as a Rolls
Royce.

Well, it's worth remembering that the iPod Nano, not that the OP mentions
their type of MP3 player, does support a lossless compression method.
The file size isn't that good, but at least it's lossless, and I'd
expect the sound quality to be equivalent to that of a CD player;
no reason why it shouldn't be. Presumably all modern iPods offer this option.
Trouble is, as I said, my iPod Nano is the 4GB model, and at 40-odd MB (IIRC)
per song with lossless compression, you don't get much on there.

You're still stuck with D/A converters and headphone preamps crammed into
a tiny little box and designed to operate with as low power consumption as
possible.  I have trouble imagining that somethng that can operate off a
couple NiCd cells is going to sound as good as the Prism converter and Krell
headphone amp, which probably take a total of 500W to run.  Of course, you
can't carry them on the bus, but that's another issue.

No.  Input current on the Prism is about two amps.  It gets pretty warm while
in normal use.  I think the idle input current on the 5W Krell amp is something
in the two-amp range as well.  That's about typical.  I'm assuming 110V power
here.

You have no concept of mp3 compression.  It is completely different than
analog audio compression.

If you put a digital audio stream through a lossless mp3 compression algorithm,
it is indeed totally lossless.  The digital data coming out is *exactly* the
same as the data going in.

Remember that in the eyes of an analog bigot, 24/96 is "lossy" compared to
the "infinite resolution" and "infinite bandwidth" of analog.  Back in the

resoluation of analog is very much less than that of good digital, even the
"lowly" of the CD.

The iPod is nowhere near a "high end" solution, nor is it that great
for everyday use as it is no substitute for a PDA, as it should be
given its storage space and CPU power. For docked use it would be much
better if it offered a digital output, copper or optical. Getting good
headroom from something with that small a battery is asking way too
much.

I would prefer a device a little larger that accepts a user-accessible
standard battery and has a small screen like that of a Palm OS PDA. But
Apple didn't ask me, and as much as I hate Steve Jobs-I hope his cancer

I always knew Crazy Robert Morein was, well, "crazy". A crackpot. A
nutbasket. Two burgers short of a Big Mac. Fudged in the head. You know,
"cuckoo" &lt;insert ring around the ear gesture&gt;. Ever since Crazy Bob turned
into Mark David Chapman and started believing he was me, and signing his
messages with my name, I became convinced this guy was a "lunatic among
lunatics" on Usenet, never mind just RAO!

http://photosbysylvan.fotopic.net/c1070076.html
http://photosbysylvan.fotopic.net/c1070076.html
http://photosbysylvan.fotopic.net/c1070076.html

Then, I didn't understand how a 7phd degreed physicist, audio engineer, film
director, member of SAG and the IEEE, could possibly have the time to spend
every waking moment of every waking day, turning his entire life into one
long mad "soundhaspriority" obsession campaign. Of course, by the same
token, I couldn't understand how Robert and others can believe that Dr.
Richard Graham, a London psychiatrist for adolescent behaviour, family man
and mathematics professor, who has announced that he's too busy to edit his
own newsletters and does not post on usenet, could possibly be me, posting
all these messages on RAO every day. But apparently, Robert and Ludovic
Mirabel and Shovels and Walt and Steven Sullivan and Powell can all somehow
understand this, and find Crazy Bob quite credible in his assumption that I
must be Graham, simply because we both used the phrase "soundhaspriority"
(along with a few thousand other people in the world... but who's
counting?).

Given the fact that I was always able to predict that Robert Morein would
jump on nearly every one of my messages within minutes of me posting it, no
matter what time of day or night, its clear this crazy usenet freak did not
have an actual job (if this crackpot doesn't respond to this message within
24 hours, call a mortician. Because it can only mean he's dead). I guess
when you're living in a mental institution as Crazy Bob must be, time is
basically all you have.

I received a letter from his old friend Brian McCarty today (reprinted
below), and what he says about Robert is a lot more credible than
anything Crazy Bob has ever said about him, me or anything, really.
Considering Robert Morein's obsessive agenda to libel and defame an
innocent man (Richard Graham) who has never posted here, it is Crazy
Bob himself who I find personifies "purposeless evil", as he calls it.
So now, the tale of "Crazy Bob Morein" is even clearer. As pathological
liars go, Morein makes Arny look like Mother Teresa. Morein is the
biggest bull****ter I've ever seen in the history of this newsgroup. He
doesn't know the meaning of sincerity or integrity. He does however,
know the meaning of "mad obsessive net stalker and delusional usenet
career troll". (How do you define a "career troll"? 7 years straight of
Crazy Bob obsessively netstalking people, with a promise of at least 7
more, pretty much does it).

THE BACKGROUND on Crazy Bob's (Robert Morein) Pathology:

Mark David Chapman, for those unaware, is the obsessive madman
responsible for shooting and killing John Lennon, who was a popular
figure who courted not an insignificant amount of controversy in his
public life. Chapman started out liking Lennon and The Beatles, but
later felt Lennon was a "phony", and sold out his ideals. He felt that
by killing Lennon, it would allow him to take Lennon's place.

Morein started out liking me, but now feels that I am a "phony", and a
sell-out. I've also been informed that Morein recently acquired a gun
license, and a handgun. Should I be worried that Crazy Bob will fly to
London to shoot Dr. Richard Graham (who he thinks is me), in order to
become Dr. Graham? Robert took a public vow recently to harass me
wherever I post on Usenet. As we have seen previous to that, Robert has
publicly admitted harassing the real Dr. Graham's colleagues at his
places of work at NHS and Priory, and as I have learned, our Crazy Bob
also harassed and threatened Graham's wife and Graham himself, at
around 3 in the morning, a couple of weeks ago.

It's disturbing enough that Robert Morein thinks he's me and posts under my
identity, but apart from hawking "morphic green *** cream", Crazy Bob has
now taken to signing his messages "Love, SHP". I'm worried that if Crazy Bob
is not physically on his way to London to shoot and kill Dr. Graham, a
completely innocent party to all of this, he's already half way there
'mentally'. It didn't take much to get Chapman on a plane from Hawaii to NY,
after all. If I ever find out that Crazy Bob Morein bought a copy of Catcher
In The Rye, then I'll be afraid for Dr. Graham's life and will definitely be
taking action against this crazy crackpot that you've got on your group!

The truth behind Robert Morein's crazy bulldoody:

You should be aware that the vast bulk of "incidents" cited by Morein
in his email to you (below) are either fictional, or were done by
Morein himself, I don't really know. At least some of the harassment
of others on usenet was done in order to justify his attacks on me, and
the email bombing and other internet harassment techniques he cites
were also done to me at the same time he was doing it to others.
Funnily, he tried his telephone schtick on my closest friends in LA,
who laughed in his face. He soon stopped that tactic. Virtually every
"fact" he posts about me is false, from my height and size to my
location and history.

The "fake endorsement" items he talks about ARE true, and putting them
up on a website kept him occupied for months trying to chase down every
item and "warn" these people. Chick Corea's manager and I are old
friends, and we had a good laugh about it - Morein left literally two
dozen messages at his office, insisting that he needed to personally
discuss the matter with Chick Corea! His grasp of fantasy vs reality is
so poor, you can get him to dance like a chimp with just a little
creative thinking. His major downfall is the internet, which for him
is his only reality, not understanding that it has little reflection on
reality. His letters to the Australian business regulators go into
their Robert Morein "crackpot" file, which I asked them to keep so that
Australian immigration can deny him a visitor's visa should he ever ask
for one. He's on the same kind of "watch" list as all terrorists.

It is notable that his stalking is confined to those overseas, who he
apparently believes won't go to Pennsylvania and kick his ass -
assuming that anyone even cares. I wish he was actually part of the
pro audio community, he'd then be at conferences with me like the AES
in Paris next month, and be easy to hunt down. Stories he tells about
"doing business with proxies" are just hot air - this is a guy that has
accomplished nothing in his life including business, where a modicum of
sanity is generally a prerequisite. His parents should be ashamed of
themselves for not kicking him out of their palatial home long ago.
Perhaps they knew he was incapable of coping in the real world, and
thought they were doing him a favor.

If the DACs and pre-amps are increasingly small surface mount devices,
then what additional problem does a tiny little box make? In particular,
if a larger box is likely to solve a problem, then what is this problem?
The major problem I see at the moment is that the headphone socket is
now too large for the rest of the device (hearing aids point to one
solution for that).

Typical headphones are producing well over 100 dB per mW, so there is
little problem with using batteries. Except the obvious one of ear
damage via excessive SPL. Indeed, there is a setting in iPods to help
prevent that. The 10-20 hour working life between battery charges seems
to indicate that neither sound levels nor battery capacity are problems.
So who needs to be restricted to a noisy mains power supply?

Anyone asking about an MP3 player is certainly asking about portability.
If you are at home, you can use a computer as a source, and use a
headphone amplifier if you like, or even a custom external DAC.

If using the portable player while travelling, sound quality is going to
be compromised in any case. Planes, trains and automobiles are noisy
environments, totally unlike a well designed listening room. If walking,
there is traffic noise. It is probably no coincidence that popular music
now seems to have as little as 6 dB between the average sound level and
the peaks. It is used under lousy listening circumstances. I don't
bother to try to listen to classical music on a portable player -
traffic drowns the quiet passages (unless you have the volume right up).
Popular music suits portable players a lot better in typical use.

Looking at Apple comments on iTunes, it seems to me that there is now
more mention of using Lossless sound formats. The Macintosh internal
support is there for 24 bit operation at higher frequencies than CD.
Doing your own conversion of LPs and CDs may be the only options
available now, while SACD and DVD-A do not permit copies. However
mastering on a computer lets you choose not to work at 16 bit 44.1kHz.

I wonder what people will be complaining about when the top portable
players accept 24 bit sound, and have 24 bit DACs?

Not at all.

Here's a spec sheet for what I believe is Dolby's most recent SR hardware:

http://www.dolby.com/assets/pdf/tech_library/131_pa_sp_0403_740_Spec.pdf

Rudy, your challenge is to document your implicit claim of more than 96 dB
unweighted dynamic range, Frequency response 5-20 KHz +/- 0.1 dB or better,
nonlinear distortion better than 96 dB down, and level tracking within 0.1
dB or better.

What the spec sheet does say is that improvement in single bands of up to 12
dB are possible.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; even consumer Teac's, with dbx onboard, using metal tape,
&gt; did over a 100 dB dynamic range with over 30 kHz bw.

Those would be highly-weighted numbers, achieved over relatively narrow
frequency bands, with relatively poor level tracking and order-of-magnitude
poorer control over frequency response in the ranges where the ear is most
sensitive, or senitive at all.

See the above specs for the CD format and compare to what you can achieve
with companded analog tape.  Companded analog tape can't offer unweighted
dynamic ranage, the lack of coloration and level tracking that we take for
granted with the CD format.

Have you listened to Apple's Lossless format

The Lossless files are obviously bigger than 256
kbps AAC, so your battery life will be reduced.

Personally, 256 kbps is an acceptable compromise
between file size and audio quality.  For serious
listening sessions at home, I prefer to listen to
the original CD on a proper hi-fi.

You need to replace the standard iPOD earphones

Trouble is that the boxes are getting so tiny. The one thing that has to fit
in the box that is a constant battle is the battery.

IME analog devices running at really low current levels and really low
voltages tend to be noisy and nonlinear.  By modern standards 5 volts and 1
mA is huge.

Cell phones are currently being implemented with "headphone amps" that are
really crappy by audio standards, to keep the power levels way down.

Convenience, and a engineering law I've never seen documented. This

One problem here is that ear damage is a function of bout loudness and time.
An audiophile listening to wide dynamic range music with occasional very
short peaks of 110 dB and average levels of 80 dB is probably not going to

so-called music that is endemic today at a steady 110 dB, is going to hurt

Even highly portable mass storage is getting to be cheap and small.   Right

I'm seeing 8 GB devices around $100.   1 GB can hold about 25 songs, so 8 GB
can hold 200. That seems to be enough for maybe a weeks worth of listening.
Based on past experience with MP3 CDs, I'd say that 200 songs can provide a

AFAIK both PCs and Macs support just about any format of audio data storage
you can comprehend. 32 bit floating point offers just under 1,000 dB dynamic

First of all, you are now _stuck_ using these increasingly small surface

&gt;damage via excessive SPL. Indeed, there is a setting in iPods to help
&gt;prevent that. The 10-20 hour working life between battery charges seems
&gt;to indicate that neither sound levels nor battery capacity are problems.
&gt;So who needs to be restricted to a noisy mains power supply?

Yes, but the sound quality suffers.  Yes, you can get amazingly good
efficiency using those little class-D amplifiers.  The only problem
is that they don't sound good.  Now, if you're on the subway, they may
be completely acceptable, but that's the difference between gear designed
for critical listening and gear intended for use on the subway.
