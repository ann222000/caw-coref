Hey, That's None Of My Business!

Has God asked you to do a certain task and yet you have not done it? What
are you waiting for? Do you realize that to neglect your duty is sin? You
see a need and yet you will do nothing about it. The God who reads and
knows the hearts of all men knows whether or not your excuses are
credible.

"Neglect of known duty is sin."
"...knowledge without practice is imputed to a man as great and
presumptuous sin."
"Nothing more injures the soul than wasted impressions. Feelings exhaust
themselves and evaporate, if not embodied in practice."
- the above quotes are from the Jamieson, Fausset & Brown Commentary

"If you know how to do the right and yet do it not the sin is greater on
account of your knowledge."
- The People's New Testament

"Unused knowledge of one's duty is sin, the sin of omission."
- Robertson's Word Pictures

"...that the ability to do good in any case imposes an obligation to do
it."
- Cotton Mather

"It is universally true that if a man knows what is right, and does not
do it, he is guilty of sin."
- Barnes' Notes

"The omission of a known duty, as well as the commission of a known sin,
is criminal."
- John Gill's Exposition Of The Entire Bible

In Proverbs 24:12, King Solomon had this to say - "If thou sayest,
Behold, we knew it not; doth not He that pondereth the heart consider it?
and He that keepeth thy soul, doth not He know it? and shall not He
render to every man according to his works?"
In James 4:17, the Apostle said this - "Therefore to him that knoweth to
do good, and doeth it not, to him it is sin."

When we couple these verses together, this is what the Holy Spirit is
saying to His church today - "Don't say that you didn't know...it is none
of your business...or you don't have the money, resources, or strength to
help or bless another. I can read minds. I know your thoughts. I know and
judge your motives. I am not impressed with your excuses. If you don't do
what you know is right according to my Word, then you are guilty of sin.
You know what I require of you and yet you fail to do it. This is evil in
My sight."

God won't accept any frivolous excuses for neglect of duty. He simply
can't. The reason being is that He "ponders the heart" and "keeps the
soul." What that means is that He searches the heart...weighs every
thought...and knows perfectly well what regard a man has for the welfare
of another. He knows and "considers" all the inward motions, thoughts,
affections, purposes, and inclinations. The most secret thoughts and
intents are naked and open before Him. He can easily detect any
unwillingness to help the distressed or any lack of love for one's
neighbor.

Hence, let all frivolous pleas be silenced before the Almighty. What He
told you to do, you are obligated to carry out.

If you have the means of doing good to others and don't do it - it is
sin!
If by your name, influence, and wealth, you can promote a good cause and
you don't do it - it is sin!
If you can relieve the distressed, poor, prisoner, and oppressed and
don't do it - it is sin!
If you can send the Gospel to other lands and don't do it, it is sin!
If you can support a Ministry that is "feeding your soul" and you don't
do it, it is sin!
If you can wipe away the tears of the mourner and don't do it - it is
sin!
If you can alleviate someone's sorrow...instruct the ignorant...raise up
those who are bowed down...deliver the wronged and oppressed...guide the
deceived or lost into the way of truth...and supply the wants of the
needy and yet don't do it - it is sin!

If you fail to do your God-given duty - what is required of you based on
the Word of God - because of laziness...love of money... selfishness...
or the dread of the loss of popularity - you are guilty of sin!

If you sin, what does that make you? A sinner! And where do sinners end
up for all of eternity? Hell! This is serious, wouldn't you agree?

Remember - God "ponders the heart" and "keeps the soul." Therefore, He
will not accept weak excuses for any disobedience or neglect of duty.

You may say - "Hey, that's none of my business!" But the important
question to ask is this - What does God say?

"...shall not He render to every man according to his works?"

It's time like never before to act up to your convictions. It's time to
use the talents that God gave you for the purposes that He ordained.

Someone is watching you! And that Someone will not let you off the hook
easily.

Never forget - Nothing deceives the Keeper of your soul! Nothing!

May God Bless His Word.
