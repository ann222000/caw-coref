- Eat Your Beans[image: GotSmiley for FREE! Click
Here]&lt;&gt; Eat
your beans! Nutrient compounds called 'flavonoids' have been found to be
effective antioxidants that help protect against heart disease and cancer.
These flavonoids are found in the coating of such beans as navy, pintos,
kidney, great northern and black beans

&lt;Top&gt;&lt;&gt;
- Don't Try to be Perfect[image: GotSmiley for FREE! Click
Here]&lt;&gt; Most
dieters try to be perfect. Alas, no one is perfect. Result? They fail, and
give up dieting in disgust. Wake up to the truth! Trying to be perfect is
one of the quickest ways to fail.

A better approach[image: GotSmiley for FREE! Click
Here]&lt;&gt;
Aim to improve your eating habits gradually. This makes it easier to succeed
And success makes it MUCH easier to carry on.

&lt;Top&gt;&lt;&gt;
- You are only as healthy as your blood[image: GotSmiley for FREE! Click
Here] &lt;&gt; If your blood is
purified and cleansed you can reverse the damage of an unhealthy lifestyle
and greatly improve your current weight and health condition, whatever that
may be. If your blood is healthy, it is carrying all the necessary nutrients
to every part of your body.
If your arteries are open and clear then your blood has no problem doing its
life supplying, nutrient carrying job.
Natural eating will help you get your arteries clear and your blood
purified. Fat loss will naturally and quickly follow, automatically.
&lt;&gt;&lt;Top&gt;&lt;&gt;
- Do an exercise that motivates you[image: GotSmiley for FREE! Click
Here]&lt;&gt; It
is not so much the type of exercise that you do, but that you do something
with desire and enthusiasm. If you love to swim and have a place to do it,
then swim. Boredom is what many times turns us away from exercise. If we
become bored we are most likely going to find a reason not to exercise.
This is why it is so important to change your workouts periodically. If you
are not enthusiastic about it any longer, try something different every so
often. Go to a lake and paddle a kayak for an hour. Go for hiking or
cycling. Just make sure to do something.

&lt;&gt;&lt;Top&gt;&lt;&gt;
- Fit After 40-s[image: GotSmiley for FREE! Click
Here]&lt;&gt; The
problem some women have is that they are hesitant to use free weights and do
exercises such as squats. Aerobics are great but ALL women should be working
with free weights. You won't become muscle bound because you will be using
much lighter weights.

&lt;&gt;&lt;Top&gt;&lt;&gt;
- Get Lazy[image: GotSmiley for FREE! Click
Here]&lt;&gt; One
of the reasons why you are not fat is probably because of the muscle that
you have. Your Metabolism must work harder to maintain the skeletal muscle,
and increases your daily resting metabolic rate. If you lose the muscle,
your body will not have to work as hard. The way to lose muscle is not to
use your muscles. If you did lose some muscle, you'd have to adjust your
diet and consume less calories to compensate for the muscle loss (lower RMR)

&lt;&gt;&lt;Top&gt;&lt;&gt;
- Low Crab...Not[image: GotSmiley for FREE! Click
Here]&lt;&gt; Whatever
you do - don't skimp on the right crabs. Your body needs them too! A
properly balanced meal should consist of 3 parts - 1 part protein, 1 part
crab, and ideally 1 part veggies for vitamins (usually about 2-3 portions
per day - more isn't bad for you). A potion is usually the size of your
closed fist. Some 'good' crabs are yogurt, brown rice, regular and
especially sweet potatoes, and fruit.

&lt;&gt;&lt;Top&gt;&lt;&gt;
- Bacteria And Your Beauty Products[image: GotSmiley for FREE! Click
Here]&lt;&gt; By
dipping your fingers into a jar of cream or cleanser, you automatically
transfer bacteria from your fingers to the product itself. Instead, purchase
a product that has a pump dispenser. The product will stay pure far longer
than that in a jar

&lt;&gt;&lt;Top&gt;&lt;&gt;
- Bananas And Your Leg Cramps[image: GotSmiley for FREE! Click
Here]&lt;&gt; Apparently
the potassium that can be found in bananas can help treat leg cramps. If you
find yourself waking up with aching legs, try a breakfast including a banana
and see how much better you feel.

&lt;Top&gt;&lt;&gt;
- Blood Shot Eyes[image: GotSmiley for FREE! Click
Here]&lt;&gt; An
easy way to reduce the redness is to scoop cold water into your hands and
splash it on your closed eyes. This should be enough to reduce the
capillaries. If this isn't enough, mild drops that can be found at your
local drug store may be required. Also be certain that the cause of the
redness is not attributed to an irritation to your eye shadow or mascara.

&lt;&gt;&lt;Top&gt;&lt;&gt;
- Caring For Athlete's Feet[image: GotSmiley for FREE! Click
Here]&lt;&gt; There
are a few things you need to do on a daily basis to control Athlete's Foot

- Wash your feet every day and carefully dry them.
- Wear cotton socks to absorb the sweat. Your feet have to stay dry.
- Change your socks every day and more often if they seem damp.

at the same time.
- Until this is cleared up, use a separate towel to avoid spreading germs.

&lt;Top&gt;&lt;&gt;
- Coffee Consumption[image: GotSmiley for FREE! Click

diuretic and will drain your body of water. To counteract the effects, for
every cup of coffee that you drink, you need to consume four glasses of
water to replace the water that your body loses

- Get Out the Yogurt Have you tried applying a little cold plain yogurt to
your face? You will really like how it tightens those pores. Apply and leave

calcium to 1500 mg per day. If you manage one 8 oz glass a day you are

calcium and these include yogurt, cheese, bran muffins, soybeans, salmon
with the bones, broccoli, oranges and cottage cheese.

- Smoking and Facial Hair Did you know that women who smoke at least one
pack of cigarettes a day have a 50% chance of growing more facial hair. This
was discovered at the Medical College of Wisconsin. It apparently has
something to do with the effects of smoking on the ovaries and the
production of hormones.
