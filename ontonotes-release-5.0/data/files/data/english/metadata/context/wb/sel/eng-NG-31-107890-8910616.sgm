I was doing some, um, after-hours shopping in the dumpster behind the
neighborhood elementary school tonight, and I found three wall clocks.
I have two hiding at the scene, and the third is outside in my car.
The one in the car has four wires coming from the back. Two are white,
one is red, and the last one is black. My guess is that the two wires
are for the 120 vac, and that the other two wires are for receiving
synchronization information from a master clock at the school system
headquarters and sharing that information with the other clocks in the
school.

It has a Telechron-looking motor, but nowhere on the face of the clock
does the word &quot;Telechron&quot; appear. The brand name of the clock is
Standard.

I'm not about to plug them in until I know what's what. Does anyone
have some thoughts to share about those wires?

Thanks.

Where I work they install school clocks.  I need to
verify it with a tech but I think the white ones are
power, others data+ and data-.

Are there two motors?  The old Standard clocks were 24 VAC.  One motor
drove the clock mechanism, and the second motor was used to synchronize
all the clocks in the system

But the classic Carl &amp; Jerry story about school clocks (and the mystery

Actually, I don't think it didn't really indicate any special wiring,

My understanding was that they used a solenoid to reset the hands. But I've
seen the clocks run at high speed, so perhaps something else was happening,
or that there was more than one sync system.

I was about to mention the Carl &amp; Jerry story! The timing problem was much
more pronounced when it rained. Turned out that the custodian's vacuum
cleaner injected much more electrical garbage onto the power line when it
sucked up water, and this junk forced the clocks to reset.

Yes.  Unfortunately, it's not among the stories someone has put
online at
http://home.gwi.net/~jdebell/pe/cj/cnjindex.htm
(he claims he has permission, I'm not sure if that's true.  I do
know that someone has recently gotten the rights to republish the
stories in book form).

Sometimes those stories form a really good introduction to a topic.
The one on &quot;wired wireless&quot; (the campus radio station that feeds
its signal over the AC line, and is experiencing a &quot;jammer&quot;), always
struck me as a good behind the scenes coverage of the issue of
broadcasting over power lines.

But while the clock one was interesting, I'm not sure it gave
as many details as some of the other stories.

I have the one from the car sitting right here now.

Yes, there are two motors. I can see the logo on one, &quot;SYNCHRON,&quot; and
the other is probably the same. One motor gets one white wire and the
red wire, and the other motor get the other white wire and the black
wire. There's a stamp on the framework that holds the motors that says
&quot;GRC-120VAC.&quot; Oh, you can set the hands by hand. There's a gear you
can reach with your fingertip. Above it are the instructions, &quot;to set
hands, turn gear in this direction,&quot; with an arrow pointing in one
direction. You can advance the hands, but you cannot turn them in
reverse. They move quickly; a small motion with the fingertip sends
them forward an hour.

The clock was tested in November 1968. It was made by the Standard
Electric Time Corp., 89 Logan Street, Springfield, Massachusetts. No
ZIP code for some reason. What do you want to bet that the replacement
clock is made in China?

They used to build Rolls-Royces in Springfield, didn't they?

These clocks look as if they'd be right at home in faked footage of an
alien autopsy. Either that, or you can relive the elementary school
hell of counting down the minutes waiting for three o'clock to roll
around. Finally.

Thanks.

The red wire should be the motor to sync it to the master clock.  At
least, that was the color the sync wiring in the school buildings. The
clocks were synced by speeding the clock up, if it was out of sync.  I
think this was done at midnight, but I do know it was done when the
buildings were generally empty.

I worked for a TV shop 35 years ago, where the owner was an
independent Standard Electric Time servicer. I saw hundreds of those
clocks go through the shop that needed a complete rebuild. He had a
small master clock on one bench to test them with, after he completed
the repairs.

The biggest failure on these clocks was the motors.  He used to buy
them by the hundred, until they hit $90 each.

Other than the fact that Carl &amp; Jerry was fiction, and that there
were at least four different master clock systems, I have worked with
Standard Electric Time Clocks.  IBM stepped their clocks once a minute
with a solenoid, and another brand used a solenoid to sync their single
motor clocks.  The boss mentioned another weird brand that he couldn't
find parts for.

My high school had clocks that did that.  After a while we figured out
that the begin class- end of class bells were tied to the same system,
and that the bell would go off about 20 seconds after the last advance
of the clock hands to the end of class time.

Years later when I visited the school, the school's system must have had
a meltdown before, as all the clocks were gone.  Probably would have
been something easily fixed by any one of us in this newsgroup, but...

Even 35 years ago, an annual service call could run thousands of
dollars, and take several days to a week to repair all the bad clocks on
a high school campus. He spent all of summer break doing clocks, and was
on call the rest of the year for fire alarms and failed master clocks or
bells.  A lot of schools had a few spare clocks, and would swap them
out, till they ran out of spares.  Then UPS would show up with a bunch
of poorly packed boxes full of broken glass and bent metal frames. I
never could figure out HOW they expected to ship 12 clocks in one box
with no packing material. :(

BTW, 'Standard' is now owned by 'Johnson Controls'.

In the 1950-1960's there were 120 volt clocks with miniature thyratron
tubes. An audible tone was sent in the power line a few minutes before the
hour to trigger the thyratron and minute hand. Maybe it was once a day and
did the hour hand as well, I don't recall. The tone was easily heard in the
building, so at the school radio station, if we were going to record a
commercial, we would wait until we heard the tone, before starting the
recorder. The tone generator must have been a big tube amplifier, but I
never saw it.

I seem to remember clocks in the schools that I went to that were completely
solenoid driven from a master clock in the office. When the time was off far
enough, they would reset the hands to 12:00 and you would hear them
ker-chunking along until they got to the correct time. And of course you
would hear the ker-chunk each minute as the hands advanced in real time..
Don't remember the brand, though... Simplex, maybe?

When I went to school in the 90s, the clocks did the rapid hand movement
thing, I distinctly remember hearing a click and looking over to see the
minute hand going around about as rapidly as the second hand if not faster.
They moved smoothly rather than clicking steps.

They were a series that ran in &quot;Popular Electronics&quot; from 1954 to 1964.
It was fiction, and while they had real adventures, the real intent was
to convey some theory about something electronic (or peripheral topic)
Each was a standalone short story.  Carl &amp; Jerry started out has high
school students, and eventually went off to university, continuing
their adventures until someone got tired (I have no clue whether it
was the author's decision to stop writing them, or the magazine decided
to stop publishing them).

So they often were a good introduction to something electronic, and
sometimes they covered esoteric or new things.  So there was a story
about making a magnetometer and finding what turned out to be useless
junk on an old farm.  There was a story about the pair getting trapped
in a car and using the ignition system to send spark signals in the hopes
of catching someone's attention (it worked).  Another one, they get locked
in a backroom by burglars holding up a gas station (or maybe that was the one
with the plot to kidnap or kill an official), and they use their knowledge
of what's inside a phone (I think it was hashed out at the beginning of
the story when they sat around discussing the topic) to dial out even
though they didn't have an actual phone.

They weren't deeply technical, but they often did present a good
introduction to a topic.  For the magazine readers, on some level they
provided content to the beginner who might not yet have the knowledge
to understand the construction articles.

Like I said, some of them have been availalbe for years online
at http://home.gwi.net/~jdebell/pe/cj/cnjindex.htm

So now I've taken the time to find the other source, and it's
Jeff Duntemann who has gotten the rights to the stories and is
reprinting them in book form:
http://www.copperwood.com/carlandjerry.htm
He has a bunch of blog entries about the stories here:
http://jeff-duntemann.livejournal.com/tag/carl+&amp;+jerry

The author of the stories, John T. Frye, later had a similar
series of fictional stories that conveyed some technical knowledge.
It was set in a tv repair shop, and was called something like
&quot;Mac's Repair Shop&quot;.

Which they did very well. John Frye did a very good job of explaining
something about electronics without getting caught up in a lot of detail.

The latter was good at explaining how pulse telephones work.

My favorite was the one in which they deliberately subjected the principal
to extremely high-voltage AC (60Hz, not Tesla coil). He didn't die, but
considering what they did to him, he should have.

My least-favorite -- because of its lack of verisimilitude -- was one in
which they attached a tiny transmitter to a big dog so that a government
agent could eavesdrop on criminals. It wasn't believable that the FBI
couldn't provide such technology.

The original cartoony illustrations -- done by the author, IIRC -- are much
preferable to the later polished-but-bland pictures.

Brenda Ann -

I have 3 of these solenoid clocks that I rescued from an old mill.
Across the face, they are labeled &quot;International&quot;. The tag inside says
&quot;International Business Machines&quot;. I would normally think that they were
used on the same system, but as I recall, two of them operated on 24
VDC pulses, and one on 48 VDC (or was it 12 volts and 24 volts?) And I
believe that 2 of them had a single solenoid, and 1 had two solenoids.
So perhaps the mill had different systems at different times - or two
systems in different parts of the mill.

I have a school clock made by Simplex. It uses a 110 VAC motor for the
main drive and a 110 VAC solenoid which rachets the hand a minute at a
time. This is the only way to set the clock other than waiting for the
time to be the same as what's currently on the clock and then plugging
it in.

When I attended school, The Portland Public School system used a similar
clock system. Whenever a reset was required, the hands would advance
about 10 or 15 minutes every minute and you could hear the ker-chunk of
the solenoid repeatedly. I suspect that this gradual process was
designed to avoid exceeding the duty cycle of the solenoid.

I don't think there was any way for the system to read what a particular
clock was set to. I suspect that they were all initially calibrated with
the same time and the assumption thereafter was that all of them would
display the same time.

&gt;    The red wire should be the motor to sync it to the master clock.  At
&gt; least, that was the color the sync wiring in the school buildings. The
&gt; clocks were synced by speeding the clock up, if it was out of sync.  I
&gt; think this was done at midnight, but I do know it was done when the

The motors I have seen on these industrial clocks are awesome. They look
like they could withstand years, if not decades, of continuous service.
most telechron motors (which IMHO are one of the finest consumer
mechanisms ever made) look wimpy by comparison.

I have another simplex, a stand-alone unit in my office that I liberated
from a 1967-era building that was being torn down on our corporate
campus. I'm almost certain that it was first installed when the building
was built and never unplugged during that whole time. It's still quiet
and perfect, 40 years later. The motor in it is HUGE compared to most
consumer clocks.

That would make sense.  Floppy drives do the same sort of thing, you
can step the head, in or out, but there is no absolute indication of where
the head is.  You have to keep track of the steps, and the direction, and
you need to reset to track zero (which does get an indicator), in order
to have a starting reference point.

The schools weren't air conditioned back then, and the extra heat had
to dry out the lubricant a lot faster.

There was a fair amount of brass in the motors he repalced, and I
scrapped piles of them he was tossing out. The shfts were worn, and most
had chewed up the brass gears.

Once again, not everyone sees the messages at the same time.  Hence
six people could reply with the very same answer because they haven't
seen the other replies yet.

But it's more than that, because it's a discussion about the clocks.
And there is a tangent about the Carl &amp; Jerry clock story, and then
a tangent about the Carl &amp; Jerry stories in general.

All those add up.

Now you've added your's, and gotten two replies so far.

I recall that particular story (with the one guy trapped in the car and the
other one hurt - using the ignition to send morse code - of course  now, no
one knows the code, so you might as well just lie there and die --- or just
use a cell phone.

I have an old IBM 24 hour clock that appears to have been used in a
radio station-it has red markings denoting the 15th and 45th minute of
every hour. Built like a tank, it is.

But at the time, they were &quot;saved&quot; because some kid was learning the morse
code to get a ham license, so when he started seeing interruption on the
tv set, he not only grasped that it wasn't some random interference, but
was morse code, and was able to decode it.

&gt;I was doing some, um, after-hours shopping in the dumpster behind the
&gt; neighborhood elementary school tonight, and I found three wall clocks.
&gt; I have two hiding at the scene, and the third is outside in my car.
&gt; The one in the car has four wires coming from the back. Two are white,
&gt; one is red, and the last one is black. My guess is that the two wires
&gt; are for the 120 vac, and that the other two wires are for receiving
&gt; synchronization information from a master clock at the school system
&gt; headquarters and sharing that information with the other clocks in the
&gt; school.

&gt; It has a Telechron-looking motor, but nowhere on the face of the clock
&gt; does the word &quot;Telechron&quot; appear. The brand name of the clock is
&gt; Standard.

&gt; I'm not about to plug them in until I know what's what. Does anyone
&gt; have some thoughts to share about those wires?

&gt; Thanks.
">

I had a Simplex wall clock from and old mill. It had a single solenoid to
advance the minute hand and three wires.  At minute 59, a cam would trip a
microswitch so the top of the hour pulse came in on the third wire.  Minute
58 consisted of 60 pulses to the second wire so wherever the minute hand was
set, it would ratchet up to 59 and wait for the top of the hour pulse.  I
didn't see any way to sync the hour hand which was on a slip clutch.  I
didn't have the controller so I used an old motor operated timer with a
small power supply to give once per minute pulses.  I made the mistake of
taking it to work and some monkey fingered idiot destroyed it trying to
figure out how to set it when the time changed in the spring.

I wanted to hang the clock on my office wall, without any wires dangling
from it - this is 20 years ago. I used a perf board to build a little
battery-powered xtal oscillator, followed by a CMOS divider to get to
one pulse per minute. That pulse turned on a Darlington-pair transistor,
which pulsed the solenoid. It worked well, except that the pulse had to
be about 1 second long. Even at that low duty cycle, I needed some
pretty hefty dry cells to get a reasonable life out of the thing. The
divider chain was pretty power-hungry, too.

If you don't mind a line cord dangling from the clock, this approach
works well.
