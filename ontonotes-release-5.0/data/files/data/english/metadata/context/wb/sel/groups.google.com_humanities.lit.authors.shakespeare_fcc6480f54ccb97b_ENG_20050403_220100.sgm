Hamlet, (Q1) Act 2, Scene 1

Cor. You shall do very well Montano, to say thus,
I knew the gentleman, or know his father,
To inquire the manner of his life,
As thus; being amongst his acquaintance,
You may say, you saw him at such a time, marke you mee,
At game, or drincking, swearing, or drabbing,

You may go so farre.

Mon. My lord, that will impeach his reputation.

Now happely hee closeth with you in the consequence,
As you may bridle it not disparage him a iote.

Cor. I, you say right, he closeth with him thus,
This will hee say, let mee see what hee will say,

Or then, or at such time, a dicing,
Or at Tennis, I or drincking drunke, or entring
Of a howse of lightnes viz. brothell,
Thus sir do wee that know the world, being men of reach,
By indirections, finde directions forth,
And so shall you my sonne; you ha me, ha you not?

Hamlet, (Q2) Act 2, Scene 1

Pol. And in part him, but you may say, not well,
But y'ft be he I meane, hee's very wilde,
Adicted so and so, and there put on him
What forgeries you please, marry none so ranck
As may dishonour him, take heede of that,
But sir, such wanton, wild, and vsuall slips,
As are companions noted and most knowne
To youth and libertie.

Rey. As gaming my Lord.

Pol. I, or drinking, fencing, swearing,
Quarrelling, drabbing, you may goe so far.
Rey. My Lord, that would dishonour him.

Pol. Fayth as you may season it in the charge.]
You must not put another scandell on him,
That he is open to incontinencie,
That's not my meaning, but breath his faults so quently
That they may seeme the taints of libertie,
The flash and out-breake of a fierie mind,
A sauagenes in vnreclamed blood,
Of generall assault.

Rey. But my good Lord.

Pol. Wherefore should you doe this?

Rey. I my Lord, I would know that.

Pol. Marry sir, heer's my drift,
And I belieue it is a fetch of wit,
You laying these slight sallies on my sonne
As t'were a thing a little soyld with working,
Marke you, your partie in conuerse, him you would sound
Hauing euer seene in the prenominat crimes
The youth you breath of guiltie, be assur'd
He closes with you in this consequence,
Good sir, (or so,) or friend, or gentleman,
According to the phrase, or the addistion
Of man and country.

Rey. Very good my Lord.

Pol. And then sir doos a this, a doos, what was I about to say?
By the masse I was about to say something,
Where did I leaue?

Rey. At closes in the consequence.

Pol. At closes in the consequence, I marry,
He closes thus, I know the gentleman,
I saw him yesterday, or th'other day,
Or then, or then, with such or such, and as you say,
There was a gaming there, or tooke in's rowse,
There falling out at Tennis, or perchance
I saw him enter such a house of sale,
Videlizet, a brothell, or so foorth, see you now,
Your bait of falshood take this carpe of truth,
And thus doe we of wisedome, and of reach,
With windlesses, and with assaies of bias,
By indirections find directions out,
So by my former lecture and aduise
Shall you my sonne; you haue me, haue you not?

Rey. My Lord, I haue.

Pol. God buy ye, far ye well.

Rey. Good my Lord.

Pol. Obserue his inclination in your selfe.

Rey. I shall my Lord.

Pol. And let him ply his musique.

Rey. Well my Lord. Exit Rey.

Hamlet, (Folio) Act 2, Scene 1

Polon. Faith no, as you may season it in the charge;
You must not put another scandall on him,
That hee is open to INCONTINENCIE;
That's not my meaning: but breath his faults so quaintly,
That they may seeme the taints of liberty;
The flash and out-breake of a fiery minde,
A sauagenes in vnreclaim'd bloud of generall assault.

Incontinence, INCONTINENCY, n. [L. incontinentia: cf. F. incontinence.]

1. Incapacity to hold; hence, incapacity to hold back or restrain;
the quality or state of being incontinent; lack of continence; failure
to restrain the passions or appetites; indulgence of lust; lewdness.

From the rash hand of bold incontinence. --Milton.
----------------------------------------------------------------
1 Corinthians (GENEVA) Chapter 7, Verse 5

1 Entreating here of marriage, 4 which is remedy against fornication,

1 Now concerning the things whereof ye wrote unto me, It were good for
a man not to touch a woman. Nevertheless, to avoid fornication, let
EVERy man have his wife, and let EVERy woman have her own husband. Let
the husband give unto the wife due benevolence, and likewise also the
wife unto the husband. The wife hath not the power of her own body, but
the husband; and likewise also the husband hath not the power of his own
body, but the wife. Defraud not one another, except it be with consent
for a time, that ye may give yourselves to fasting and prayer, and again
come together, that Satan tempt you not for your INCONTINENCY.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
1 Corinthians Chapter 7, Verse 5

405 Vulgate: Nolite fraudare invicem nisi forte ex consensu ad tempus ut
vacetis orationi et iterum revertimini in id ipsum ne temptet vos
Satanas propter incontinentiam vestram

1395 Wyclif: Nyle ye defraude eche to othere, but perauenture of consent
to a tyme, that ye yyue tent to preier; and eft turne ye ayen to the
same thing, lest Sathanas tempte you for youre vncontynence.

1526 Tyndale: Withdrawe not youre selves one from another excepte it be
with consent for a tyme for to geve youre selves to fastynge and
prayer.
And afterwarde come agayne to the same thynge
lest Satan tempt you for youre INCONTINENCYe.

1611 King James: Defraud ye not one the other, except it be with consent
for a time, that ye may give yourselves to fasting and prayer; and come
together again, that Satan tempt you not for your INCONTINENCY.

Cymbeline Act 2, Scene 4

POSTHUMUS LEONATUS: Hark you, he swears; by Jupiter he swears.
'Tis TRUE:--nay, keep the ring--'tis TRUE: I am sure
She would not lose it: her attendants are
All sworn and honourable:--they induced to steal it!
And by a stranger!--No, he hath enjoyed her:
The cognizance of her INCONTINENCY
Is this: she hath bought the name of whore thus dearly.
There, take thy hire; and all the fiends of hell
Divide themselves between you!

Act 3, Scene 4

IMOGEN I false! Thy conscience witness: Iachimo,
Thou didst accuse him of INCONTINENCY;
Thou then look'dst like a villain; now methinks
Thy favour's good enough. Some jay of Italy
Whose mother was her painting, hath betray'd him:
Poor I am stale, a garment out of fashion;
And, for I am richer than to hang by the walls,
I must be ripp'd:--to pieces with me!--O,
Men's vows are women's traitors! All good seeming,
By thy revolt, O husband, shall be thought
Put on for villany; not born where't grows,
But worn a bait for ladies.
----------------------------------------------------
Brewer Dictionary of Phrase and Fable. 1898.

Messali?na.

Wife of the Emperor Claudius of Rome. Her name has become
a byword for lasciviousness and incontinency.

Polinesso (in Orlando Furioso).

Duke of Albany, who falsely accused Geneu?ra of incontinency,
and was slain in single combat by Ariodants.

XXI
&quot;This Polinesso many times had heard
From me (for such the Scottish baron's name)
Well warranted by sight as well as word,
How ill his love was cherished by the dame.
To see another to himself preferred
Not only quenched the haughty warrior's flame,
But the fond love, which in his bosom burned
Into despiteful rage and hatred turned.

XXII
&quot;Between Geneura and her faithful knight
Such discord and ill will he schemed to shed,
And put betwixt the pair such foul despite.
No time should heal the quarrel he had bred;
Bringing such scandal on that damsel bright,
The stain should cleave to her, alive or dead:
Nor, bent to wreck her on this fatal shelf,
Counselled with me, or other but himself.

XXXVI
&quot;When Ariodantes had, with honest mind,
Told what reward he hoped should quit his pain,
False Polinesso, who before designed
To make Geneura hateful to her swain,
Began -- `Alas! you yet are far behind
My hopes, and shall confess your own are vain;
And say, as I the root shall manifest
Of my good fortune, I alone am blest.
-----------------------------------------------------------

&lt;&lt;More than 100 operas owe their plots to Lodovico Ariosto?s 1516
soap-opera?like episodic saga, Orlando Furioso. It took twenty-seven
years for this poet to complete the work, which he created in honor of
his benefactor, a descendent of the Lombard-related duchy of Este.
Ariosto interwove some seven centuries of history (and an international
cast of characters) with myth and fantasy (including such legendary
characters as Merlin). His subplots go as far back as Charlemagne?s
Crusade-like journey east, and right up through what would have been
contemporary Crusaders and Saracens of the early 1500s. Although Ariosto
used Orlando Furioso as a platform for his own strong views about war
and religion, he was also playful, teasing his reades by abruptly
dropping discussion of one set of characters when they were tied to the
tracks, so to speak (or gone mad, or been sentenced to death...), to
take up another unrelated subplot for a while; or allowing an occasional
slapstick quality to add a little humor to violent or emotionally
turbulent proceedings.

Because of the episodic nature of the work, it was easy for librettists
to dip into only a small section (or connect interrupted sections) to
create full-length operas concerned with only a few characters or
incidents. Many of these operas are about the knight Orlando
(Charlemagne?s nephew), or else spin off such characters as Rinaldo
(Orlando?s cousin), Alcina (an evil sorceress), Ariodante (the Duke
of Albany), or Ruggiero (son of the African king of Reggio).

Handel?s 1735 Alcina seizes upon the eponymous seductress?s habit
of magically transforming knights who came a-courting, into her own
private menagerie. Bradamante, fiancée of the still-human but otherwise
bewitched knight Ruggiero, disguises herself as a man and sets out in
search of her lover. Coincidentally, her boat becomes shipwrecked
upon Alcina?s very island, where not only does Alcina?s daffy sister,
Morgana, fall in love with Bradamante, not knowing she is really a
woman; but her own spellbound fiancé mistakenly believes she (in male
disguise) is a rival to his romance with the enchantress. These
dilemmas are eventually resolved, Alcina stripped of her powers,
and all the transformed knights returned to human form.

Gary Schmigdall wrote in his book Literature as Opera, &quot;The worlds of
Ariosto and of the opera seria were dazzlingly illusionistic, so it is
no wonder that, for instance, the Ginevra-Ariodante episode was set to
music no fewer than twelve times between 1708 and 1753.&quot; Handel?s
Ariodante, dating like Alcina from 1735, is probably the only one of
those twelve regularly performed in our own time. The plot: Ariodante
is engaged to Ginevra, daughter of the king of Scotland. The jealous
Polinesso, who is the Duke of Albany, circulates false evidence that
Ginevra is not chaste -- a crime punishable by execution. Ariodante
disappears but comes back just when Polinesso confesses that
he made it all up, and so Ariodante may marry Ginevra after all.

As for Handel?s 1733 Orlando, this opera of intricately tangled love
affairs not only traces back to Ariosto?s liftings from the famous
Chanson de Roland, but also reminds us that Orlando Furioso is actually
a sequel to another poem, Boiardo?s unfinished Orlando Innamorata.
Before Handel approached this story, Vivaldi had already twice set
elements of the episode from Orlando Furioso as operas.

In the Handel version, in which a magician named Zoroastro pulls
everyone?s strings, the title character is in love with Angelica, the
queen of Cathay, who lives at the court of Charlemagne. She prefers
the knight Medoro, who is himself also loved by a shepherdess, Dorinda.
Dorinda tells Orlando that Medoro is planning to leave with Angelica,
hoping that he will intervene so she will not lose Medoro. Not only does
Orlando intervene, but he goes virtually mad with jealousy and attack
Angelica, who is conveniently borne away on a cloud before he can harm
her. In his madness, Orlando experiences all manner of hallucinations.
First, he makes love to Dorinda and then attacks her, thinking he is in
mortal combat with an enemy; then Angelica reappears only to be attacked
by Orlando again, who now thinks her literally a monster. Zoroastro
finally restores Orlando?s sanity to him by sprinkling him with a
special potion; Orlando awakens from his nightmare so remorseful that
now he attempts suicide. Angelica prevents this, and finally he accepts
that she loves another and gives her his blessing to marry Medoro (and
what of Dorinda? ...
