He says it's hurting music.

Who gives a fuck!
Music is just one very small aspect of the internet, and this fudge packer
wants to shut the entire thing down.
What a looney!

Sounds like a 2 year old.

&quot;Gee, no one's going to buy my records if this keeps up!&quot;

Maybe if faggots like him would stop trying to be politicians and stick
to at least attempting to be entertainers as it used to be, they'd buy
music and appreciate it instead of stealing it, listening to it and
realizing that it's shit.

Hey, take it easy. I didn't know how in touch with Sir Elton you were. I
