Few things are as important to me as my Jewish identify.  Jewish
thought, loyalty and
concepts are integral to my being and actions.

I saw a Jewish group on the web, and in spite of having being on the
web since the 80s.
Prior to web sites and browsers, soc.culture.jewish floored me with
the anti-Semitism.
But, here I had found a Jewish moderated group.  A group where there
would be respect.
After a while I found myself attacked generally without mercy.  OK, my
ideas were not
mainstream, but the attacks were often mean spirited and self
centered.  They were as
if they held the center of what is Judaism, and no other thoughts were
worthy.

When the concept of using a Rabbinical source, it turned out it had to
be the right
Rabinical source.  After numerous attempts at joining the community,
being subject
to personal attack, I left, while on occasion viewing the exchanges.

What I found was, it was not me.   The personal attacks, the
intolerance was rampant.
There was no joining together as Jews.   Moderators did little to
prevent the personal
attacks, and people did little to oppose mean spirited attacks.   So I
left.

It saddened me, for as Jews we must have unity.

Perhaps we need to reconsider that WE were slaves to Pharoh in Egypt,
and we
are the Jewish peoples. And we are to be a light onto the world.
Disagreement
is fine, and a great learning experience, personal attacks, mean
sprits hardly
contribute to unity.  It seems the only time we unit as when attacked
by those
that seek to destroy us.

Perhaps we all can reach into our hearts and be Jewish and support on
another.
Express how and why we feel differently, but not with hostility,
antagonism and a self
absorbed view that one alone hold THE truth?

I wish us all the best and when the time comes we can be civil and
respectful,
I would love to participate, learn and contribute here.

You have/had your own ideas (such as vegetarianism) which are not based in
Judaism. No one cares what you eat, but you periodically post to SCJM
asserting that vegetarianism is *based on torah*, and every time you do
that, you are corrected. I can't recall some of the other things you've
posted, but the vast majority of what you post is your own worldview which
is not related to torah. No one here has an objection to your worldview. The
objection is when you incorrectly state that this or that is *Jewish
thought* and *based on torah* when it's simply your own ideas and often the
total opposite of what the torah says. The correction of incorrect ideas is
not a personal attack.

Yet, in the past (just as now) you have generated an ongoing series of posts
where you complain that people are being mean to you and hate you and that
we are all Jews and then you bring the Holocaust into the equation. Sorry,
but you cannot expect the people on this newsgroup to be intellectually
dishonest out of fear that someone is going to complain (yet again) that
everyone is being mean to him. Disputing your incorrect understanding of
what is Jewish thought versus what is secular politically correct thought is
not &quot;a mean-spirited attack&quot; and constantly complaining that people are
&quot;being mean&quot; in an effort to get them to shut up is a manipulative tool. My
11-year-old son has been using this manipulation for years. I'm truly sorry
that you or your relatives experienced the horrors of the Holocaust but
speeches about &quot;Jews need to be unified&quot;  and &quot;we need to support each
other&quot; doesn't obligate us to agree that the torah endorses vegetarianism
just to avoid having you generate yet another post where you tell us how
mean we all are.

----Cindy S.

You could practice what you preach to start with.  You have a number of
times attacked Hillel for being conservative/libertarian saying that wasn't
Jewish and he was displaying anti-semitism. He called you on it (using real
life examples) and you didn't have any sort of explanation. You can't expect
to attack someone and then complain when you are attacked.

-----------
I'm not sure exactly whom you are referring to. I know there is a person
named Hillel123 (or something like that) who sometimes posts to the
unmoderated group. But I will say this, in a general way:  Generally
speaking, traditional Judaism tends not to be very liberal or open-minded.
Some people have an issue with that, and that is their prerogative. The
problem comes in when a person starts insisting that the traditional Jewish
view is in fact &quot;not Judaism&quot; and a secular liberal world view is &quot;Judaism&quot;
and anyone who disagrees or holds the traditional view is mean-spirited and
an antisemite. The reality is that there are very specific views which may
be described as &quot;Jewish&quot; views, and other views which are not Jewish views.
A person is entitled to hold whatever view he wants, but what he is not
entitled to do is to describe his personal secular view as being a &quot;Jewish&quot;
view when the Jewish view is just the opposite. Judaism is not whatever we
want it to be, and the views of the Reform rabbi from temple XYZ do not
carry the same intellectual weight as Rashi (and I have no doubt that the
rabbi himself would be the first to say so).

That's all well and good, but the fact of the matter is not nor has there
even been one sole unified &quot;Jewish view.&quot; And that mythical unified Jewish
view is certainly not owned by a bunch of guys in Lakewood, or Baltimore,
or Williamsburg, or even Jerusalem.

For any given group of Jews that you might choose, you may well find a
consensus on certain issues. And divergence on others.

Just look at the differences between, say, Jacko and, I don't know,
whoever he argues with here. Can you categorize one as &quot;Jewish&quot; and other
other not? I don't think so.

There isn't even a single Jewish view on something as straightforward as
eating rice on Pesach, let alone more complex philosophical approaches to
life. As we've discussed previously here, I think you'll find that Micha's
&quot;Jewish view&quot; on certain issues diverges quite strongly from Moshe's, and
both of them are VERY distinct on certain issues from, I'd expect, Harry.

Which one is *the* Jewish view?

At the end of the day, if one Jew says it, then it's *a* Jewish view.
Beyond that, you need to qualify according to the group you're talking
about.

That is what basically Hillel said. In Judaism there is no one true way,
some will react differently than others. And I would think as a Sabra, he
has seen the whole gamut with the varying shades and hues from Beta Israel
to Romania.

However on simple issues such as &quot;thou shall not murder or covet&quot;, I would
think there would be a unity.

Simple issues?? I'm not even clear on what &quot;covet&quot; means exactly, are you?
And murder - what's murder? Is it murder to kill a guy and take his stuff?
What about if he took the stuff from you in the first place? What about a
guy who is holding a knife on you, is it murder to kill him? What about
killing a fetus, is that murder?

Simple? Hah!

There is differences between killing and murder. Let's keep it simple. Say
man x walked up to man y (who he doesn't know)  and shoots him. That is
murder. Although I am not sure that scenario is exclusive to just be wrong
in Judaism, as I can't think of any cultures off the top of my head, where
that would have been considered acceptable.

Meaningless. It's easy to come up with an example where one could fairly
say that the Jewish view is that murdering is endorsed by the Torah, as an
example. Catholics hold that abortion is murder. The Torah says that under
certain circumstances it is not only permitted by required to kill the
fetus. Thus, the Jewish view endorses murder.

The details are EVERYTHING.

What's your point? The Jewish view is that you can't walk up to a man you
don't know and shoot him. Unless he's an Amalekite, of course. Although
some would disagree with that. Oops! There goes that unified Jewish view
again!

There's no such thing.

&gt; Just look at the differences between, say, Jacko and, I don't know,
&gt; whoever he argues with here. Can you categorize one as &quot;Jewish&quot; and other
&gt; other not? I don't think so.

&gt; There isn't even a single Jewish view on something as straightforward as
&gt; eating rice on Pesach, let alone more complex philosophical approaches to
&gt; life. As we've discussed previously here, I think you'll find that Micha's
&gt; &quot;Jewish view&quot; on certain issues diverges quite strongly from Moshe's, and
&gt; both of them are VERY distinct on certain issues from, I'd expect, Harry.
">

--------
And my answer here is that Jacko, Micha, Moshe, and Harry all have solid
Jewish educations behind them. Even where they hold divergent views, their
views at the very least are based on legitimate scholarship and years of
study. And I think you'd find that these four would be in total agreement
regarding the vast majority of Jewish philosophy and observance. For
example, I can't imagine that any of these four would argue that Jews are
not obligated to keep kosher or observe shabbos.

This is quite different from a guy off the street who is completely lacking
in Jewish education who holds certain personal world views and then opens up
his English-translated tanakh, takes several verses out of context
(ostensibly to support his personal worldview on some secular issue), and
then asserts that his opinion is a legitimate *Jewish* view, *supported by
the torah*, equal in intellectual stature to Jacko's or Micha's or Moshe's
or Harry's opinions, each of whom has spent years in yeshiva learning
original source material in Hebrew and Aramaic and studying the commentaries
of generations of our sages. And kal v'chomer (how much more so), when the
person being disputed is not Jacko, Micha, Moshe, or Harry but rather Rashi,
R' Moshe Feinstein, or the Chofetz Chaim.

If you (the rhetorical you) want to dispute the Chofetz Chaim, please go
right ahead, but if you want to be taken seriously, you need to be on his
intellectual level. And if you're going to cite another sage with a
divergent view, the sage better be R' Moshe Feinstein and not Rabbi Reform
from Temple XYZ. But when someone points out that you are not on a level to
dispute the Chofetz Chaim, then please don't respond by complaining that
everyone is being so mean to you and Jews need to love each other because of
the Holocaust.

&gt;&gt;&gt; That is what basically Hillel said. In Judaism there is no one true way,
&gt;&gt;&gt; some will react differently than others. And I would think as a Sabra,
&gt;&gt;&gt; he
&gt;&gt;&gt; has seen the whole gamut with the varying shades and hues from Beta
&gt;&gt;&gt; Israel
&gt;&gt;&gt; to Romania.

&gt;&gt;&gt; However on simple issues such as &quot;thou shall not murder or covet&quot;, I
&gt;&gt;&gt; would
&gt;&gt;&gt; think there would be a unity.
&gt;&gt;--------
&gt;&gt;I agree. To the best of my knowledge, there is no *Jewish* view that
&gt;&gt;murdering and coveting are okay.

&gt; And, of course, it is the Jewish view that one should be good. And not be
&gt; bad.

Thugee. The devotees of Kali, goddess of death, used to kidnap children or
other vulnerable people, and murder them. Hence the English word, &quot;thug&quot;.

Well, I imagine that there are R Jews who would indeed argue not only
that consumption of pork products is perfectly acceptable, but that
this is a completely acceptable, Torah-based *Jewish view*

At the same time, I would expect quite a few responses to such a
statement, challenging the suggestion that it is a legitimate *Jewish*
view.

Both sides of such a debate would have the right to state their
opinions in this forum, and even to cast aspersions on the other's
arguments.  So long as they don't attack the person ... isn't that
what this group is about?

Right, but that's also the Christian view, and the Muslim view, and the

So saying that is the Jewish view is meaningless.

I understand what you're trying to say, it's just that speaking of &quot;the
Jewish view&quot; simply doesn't get us anywhere, it doesn't mean anything. It
always needs to be qualified by reference to the specific Jews who's view
you're talking about. It's a question of being more precise. You can
certainly say that BeachRunner's views are not shared by the majority of O
Jews, that is, they aren't traditional O Jewish views, but you can't
simply say they aren't Jewish views as an absolute. It always has to be
qualified. Sometimes the qualification is implied, but not always.

Yes, and I believe that is what this poster is objecting to - that some of
us have cast aspersions on his arguments, and he anticipates a recurrence of
the same, so his introductory post IMHO was an attempt to pre-empt such
posts by asserting from the outset that he has been the poor victim of
mean-spirited personal attacks on this forum in the past.  The first time he
posted in this manner, I felt guilty. Then I saw that this was a pattern. I
have read these lengthy &quot;poor me&quot; posts on this forum on several occasions.
In my opinion, the goal of the introductory post was to elicit the sympathy
of at least some of the SCJMers in the hopes that he will now be able to
post his personal secular ideas as being torah-based alternate expressions
of Judaism without any challenge from the rest of us. BTW, his supposed
desire for love and brotherhood and unity of the Jewish people has
apparently not prevented him from posting completely unprovoked snide
remarks about torah-observant Jews in the past on this forum.

It needs to be qualified by whether or not it's based on torah since that is
the claim the poster is making - that his view is *based on torah* and he is
providing proofs for his views by citing pasukim (torah verses) which in
fact do not support his view at all. So, it's really incorrect to say that
the arguments focus on what is or isn't a &quot;Jewish&quot; view (as you correctly
point out, Jews have lots of views) but whether or not it is a *torah view,*
since that is what this poster has been arguing.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Yes, you are correct. And I believe I have now clarified.

The argument isn't about O views versus R views. If someone were to post
that the R view is that following halacha is optional, I would have no
dispute with this statement at all. But if someone were to post that
following halacha is optional and the torah supports this conclusion and the
proof for this assertion is pasuk A, B, and C, then I will object.

&gt;&gt; and divert the conversation away from the topic at hand [i.e., the messy
&gt;&gt; room] and to simultaneously preempt additional conversation regarding any
&gt;&gt; other neglected tasks. So, what begins as mom's legitimate complaint that
&gt;&gt; &quot;your room is a mess&quot; suddenly becomes &quot;Oh you poor thing that the kids
&gt;&gt; on the school bus were all so mean to you, and of course I will drop the

&gt;&gt; some cookies.&quot;

&gt;&gt; An hour later, the comforted and contented happy camper is now busily
&gt;&gt; playing computer games and munching on homemade cookies. The floor of the
&gt;&gt; room in question is still littered with laundry but all that seems so
&gt;&gt; insignificant relative to the big picture. Enter the older brother who
&gt;&gt; gently tells mom that she's been had. He assures mom that his younger
&gt;&gt; brother's account of his ordeal on the school bus has in fact been
&gt;&gt; grossly exaggerated and that the reality of the situation is that  little
&gt;&gt; brother has successfully evaded cleaning his room, has effectively

&gt; some would disagree with that. Oops! There goes that unified Jewish view
&gt; again!

&gt; There's no such thing.&lt;
">

There is, or should be, one point of unity that we ought to all be
able to agree upon: Jews are members of a tribe!
Our biblical epics say so, that we are of the remaining tribe of
Judah, hence the name &quot;Jew.&quot;  Now, like any other tribe, such as
Navajo indians, for example, we have tribal law. They are the ancient
laws that the tribe members are supposed to adhere to, and are dealt
with by the shamans, or rabbis, who are presumably the students and
arbiters of the law for the rest of us.
However, just as most Navajo indians no longer believe in their old
tribal religion, there are many Jews who don't believe in the religion
of the tribe of Judah anymore either. They still want to belong to the
tribe, but they don't want to be browbeaten by the tribal shamans.
Nonetheless, there are some MINIMAL criteria for tribal membership:
your mother had to have been a Jew when you were born, OR, you were
accepted into the tribe by our orthodox shamans after an exhaustive
process meant to keep you out. If you passed their rigorous tests, you
are part of the tribe.
But there are many points of cultural interest that Jews might find
common interests in.Obviously, there is the religion itself. But for
those for whom religion no longer holds much appeal, there is a common
history, a common language, a homeland (zionism), a body of
literature, and other cultural commonalities.
In the 21st century -  a scientific century - religion alone will no
longer hold the tribe together. In the past, it had to. It was all we
had of  our own.That is no longer the case. We have our land. WE have
a body of literature and science and music and art and many other
things that Jews have been involved with for quite a while now. But
Jewish law, as well as lore, still has a role to play. it's still a
great body of literature incorporating a great deal of wisdom, and not
to be totally dismissed.. But being a Jew is a multidimensional
experience today, and shouldn't be narrowed down to a single vision of
how a Jew is supposed to be.

The Torah makes it clear that manslaughter is not

manslaughter is by no means a clear matter.
The Torah view is that at least under certain
circumstances, in which an abortion is not wanted,
causing one is punishable by monetary compensation.

It would be better to state that the Torah commands eating

It does not say that the cooking method must be one of those

No, when the crops have been devoured, one could turn to the new
plentiful supply, the locusts that destroyed the crops.

If locusts come to eat the crop it is bad news. With modern transport
systems and financial arrangements, all it means for the Israeli farmer is a
big red figure on his bank statement. But for those not so fortunate it
means hunger.
However by collecting as many locusts as you can, you will alleviate the
problem to some extent.
That's probably why locusts, uniquely amongst insects, are kosher.

Cindy refuses to eat locusts on the grounds that the species cannot be
reliably identifed.
The various instars are morphologically quite different, and the gregarious
and solitary types look different too, although they are in fact the same
species.  Then there are different species of locust - Wikipedia list 9-11
in Africa and the Middle East, two of which you'd probably call
&quot;grasshoppers&quot;. However Ancient Israelites probably wouldn't have known all
these details, hence a certain amount of confusion.
Personally (disclaimer, I am not certified by any other authority) I would
say that when the locusts descend on the fields, those are the ones you may
eat. However you are not meant to go into the fields on locust-hunting
expeditions to pick out the non-swarming forms.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Bob, this post of yours generated many responses. The main argument
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; with your posts, as I understood from this thread was that you had a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; habit of conflating any idea you had, with &quot;Torah&quot; and &quot;Judaism&quot;.
&gt;&gt;&gt; --------
&gt;&gt;&gt; And employing the device of what we've dubbed in my house &quot;the eternal
&gt;&gt;&gt; victim&quot; speech, which is sort of like &quot;You're so mean for yelling at me
&gt;&gt;&gt; about my messy room because [I neglected to mention until now that] I was
&gt;&gt;&gt; bullied on the school bus yesterday.&quot;

In our family there is a large age difference. My oldest daughter

You are only poster who has said that she will not eat locusts on halachic
grounds. Others imagine that they might dislike them, but that's not the
same reason. Of course I don't mean to imply that there are no other Jews
who share that view. There are also locust-eating Jews, who are in a quite
different position to pork or lobster-eating Jews (athough apparently
locusts taste like lobster and the English word is derived from the same
Latin root).
Since locusts are an explicitly permitted food, the reason for the
prohibition is that the species cannot be known with certainty, which you
mentioned. You could offer a &quot;my rabbis is always correct and never gives
reasons&quot; type argument, but that wasn't what you said, and in fact
authorities who forbid locusts do give those grounds.

That would be interesting. The locust would be the only animal that is
kosher during a certain stage of its lifecycle. I suspect that this is in
fact the case, when the locusts descended on the crops the matter was not
weighed to a nicety. The peasants ran into the fields and gathered as many

Every torah observant Jew shares this view (with the exception of the

Why would I say that? This is the type of anti-Judaism argument typically
