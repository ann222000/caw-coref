Idiot.

Let me ask you a question. If CV needs 400 genes to create a basic
cell. And he may not succeed, How is it that you beleive the first
cell, had 1 gene?

If you beleive it had more than 1, Please do tell. If you think it had
1, please show a viable sequence!

It starts wrong because it states &quot;In the beginning there was
nothing&quot; and as I have attempted to explain before:-

a) there never was and never has been a nothing

- and -

b) given the infinite nature of everything (which precludes a nothing
from ever existing) there never was and never could be a
beginning.....

... which rules out creation altogether.

Transformation via decay and rebirth into another form (YES).

Creation of a something from a nothing (NO)

The &quot;transformation via decay and rebirth into another form&quot;
manifests itself in variou forms including entropy.

There was a cosmologist on the radio the other day explaing how &quot;the
universe&quot; (as we perceive it - and I emphasise as we perceive it) is
expanding at an exponential rate and that the &quot;unfortunate&quot; fact is
that &quot;the universe&quot; of the future won't be very exciting at all as
nothing much will be happening (or being perceived to be happening).

All he is saying is that &quot;the Universe&quot; of our perception is in a
state of decay and will eventually wither into the everythingness from
which it first arose.

It's all amazingly simple (to me at least).

However everythingness has demonstrated that it does decay and
transform and that as our universe withers into the universality of
everythingness other peceivable universes will and probably do at this
moment occur

(using the word &quot;occur&quot; following the logic of several of our senses
of perception)

No, I prefer to leave the evidence of your idiocy
there on the floor where you dropped it in front of
everyone. Genes are specialized information encoding
mechanisms, not something necessary _at all_ for
abiogenesis (and lipid bilayers form just fine
abiotically, so the first living organism doesn't
need a gene telling it how to make one, it can just
colonize the ones already in existence).

But I'm sure in your mind you've redefined &quot;gene&quot;
to mean something no one else in the world thinks
it means, and expect to win your argument based
on your phony definition.

Drool on, spintronic, your reputation is as lost as
your argument, and your strawman about &quot;1 gene&quot; is
going to die unmourned, of the dry rot it caught in
the dangerous experiment of being for even a moment
in your shriveled rotting creationist brain.

of religion pointed out in the cartoon at the beginning of the post.
Because to me your follow-up post looks like someone desperately
trying to avoid the basic question raised by the cartoon; is religion
based on a conscious decision to avoid real answers?
Or don't you like looking into the motives and thoguhts of the origins
of religion?  Not willing to discuss this?  How about the observed

Let me jump in here: The phrase &quot;the first cell&quot; is meaningless.
There was almost surely a very long spectrum of transitional forms
from something that wasn't at all like a cell
(perhaps clay crystals in a pond fed by a creek,
or freefloating auto-catalytic mix of chemicals circulating in a
convection cell around an undersea volcanic vent)
through various sorta-cell thingies
(such as spontaneously-formed lipid bubbles that accidently
trapped some auto-catalytic sets then burst when the chemicals grew
too large,
and lipid bubbles that were maintained over long spans of time by
the replicators within them, including synthesizing new lipid
molecules which self-incorporated into the bubbles, but stretched
by shear forces in the water until it spontaneously thins in the
middle and breaks apart and the loose ends spontaneously re-seal
after a while)
until finally we got something that could definitely be called a
basic cell per current-day expectations
(deliberate interally-invoked mechanism for cell fission, by
either girdle-tightening or bifurcating-wall-growth).
There was most definitely no point at which nonliving
nonreplicating material spontaneously formed into a cell.

My estimate is that the first lipid bubble contained somewhere
between five and twenty independent replicators, no genes at all,
not even one gene, while the first true genes evolved gradually
within the stretching-lipid-bubble form of life, and by the time
these systems evolved a way to *deliberately* and *controlably*
undergo cell fission hence reaching the benchmark of the first
&quot;basic cell&quot;, there must have already been at least fifty different
genes, including the genes that code for transcription and genetic
code, for chemosynthesis, for detoxification of some toxic
chemicals including surplus of chemicals synthesized, for lipid or
other cell-wall-material synthesis, for explicit replication of
genome, for growing in the direction of or swimming toward or
adjusting buoyancy to reach better environmental conditions such as
food or temperature, and for grabbing hold of some protruding
surface so that the cell can be washed by nutrients flowing past it
rather than drift with an already-depleted pocket of food. Up to
that point there must have been huge cells which had many copies of
their genomes stretched through something like hyphae which grew
toward better conditions while the tail end mostly just shut down
and decayed if it starved too much to survive on nutrients that
diffused through the cell from the feeding end.

It's not the form that's important, it's the role it plays in a
living system. The basic idea of a &quot;gene&quot; is that it codes for
something else that runs the biochemical pathways (enzymes etc.),
while it itself simply gets replicated (via anti-copying of DNA or
RNA bases at present, but something else might have been the first
replicating mechanism). For example, computer viruses consist of
binary patterns in an arbitrary storage medium, and code for
machine instructions, which together comprise a program for probing
other computers and attempting to infect them by performing an
abstract data copying operation to that remote computer, the
physical medium of storage in that other computer isn't important,
only the bit pattern and operating system.

The first life surely didn't have anything that got replicated and
transcribed to something else that did the actual work. The first
life *was* something that directly synthesized itself (per the J.
Random auto-catalytic set of chemicals hypothesis), or was abstract
patterns in a specific kind of substrate (per the clay-crystal
dislocation-patterns hypothesis), etc. In the case of
clay-crystals, the &quot;living system&quot; was merely an abstract pattern
riding on the purely-abiotic crystal-growth-and-splitting
mechanism. In that case in a sense it took zero genes to grow and
split clay crystals, and the dislocation patterns that got
replicated merely influenced stability and other chemical
properties as a second-order effect.

Indeed. One of my speculations is that lipids were a waste product
of one of the early independent replicators, and after so much
waste product had accumulated in the ocean they spontaneously
started forming bubbles that accidently trapped subsets of the
various replicators, and when a viable subset including lipid-maker
got so trapped that was the first &quot;cell&quot;.

Idiot. A gene is a unit of &quot;hereditary&quot; information.

For the very thick (NAMELY YOU),  hereditary inplies a &quot;before&quot; and

Cells (as they exist today) require lipid bilayers. Lipid bilayers can
be created abiotically. Therefore it is not a requirement that the first
cell be able to create its own lipid bilayers, since it could colonize
an existing abiotic one.

This isn't saying that the first cell *didn't* create its own lipid
bilayers, just that it didn't have to (although if it didn't have to, it
probably didn't).

Because &quot;obviously&quot; the &quot;first living cell&quot; must be composed of

A hint for SpinDH.  The cell membranes don't replicate on their own.
Even in modern cells.  Which should tell you, that on their own, the
membranes aren't alive.  And they do form on thier own without
replicators helping.  How is that significantly different from water?
Much like proteins.

&gt; &gt; Water forms abiotically, too. Does that mean the first living cell can't
&gt; &gt; use water?

&gt; Nar, it just means that water isn't alive! Gee your as fucked up as he
&gt; is!

If the first cell mated with water, the result would be a wet T-shirt

_What_ subject or context, fool? This thread is
about a cartoon showing robots inventing the concept
of &quot;god&quot; out of sheer laziness.

Your private, &quot;for idiots only&quot; agenda about how
many genes it takes to support a cell with a cell
wall is not on the table and never was.

No one with a brain thinks that living entities
started right out of the box at abiogenesis with
anything as complex as separate genes or as a cell
with a cell wall.

No one with a grasp of chemistry thinks that closed
wall lipid &quot;bags&quot; needed living things to create
them before living things could put them to use;
lipid sacks form spontaneously from lipid molecules
via their hydrophobic and hydrophilic ends matching
themselves up without the least bit of intervention
by living entities.

Thus no person with a grasp of biological evolution
thinks that the first life form with a cell wall had
to have sufficient genes to create that cell wall
itself.

Instead, a likely order of life evolving is:

- living entities, no genes, just naked molecules or
mutually autocatalyzing collections of molecules
floating free or attached to abiotic substrates

- living entities, no genes, still naked molecules,
accidentally or by act of evolved molecular form,
colonizing abiotically self-assembling lipid sacks
(or other such sacks, nothing says the first sacks
have to be anything like the ones seen today,
evolution has been busy in between) that already
exist in the environment independent entirely of
those living entities

[for a current model of a living entity
dependent on a home it doesn't construct
itself, think: hermit crab]

- living entities, still no genes, now evolved into
emitting lipid waste products which self-assemble
to make even more lipid sacks than would naturally
occur abiotically, but sacks not associated
particularly with offspring of the living entities
whose waste products they are; lots of
&quot;cell-looking&quot; lifeforms, but cell walls not
&quot;living&quot; and not directly constructed by their
living contents

- living entities, now adapted to colonize and
inhabit lipid sacks, perhaps no longer ever
existing outside such lipid sacks, which sacks
expand due to lipid waste products being highly
concentrated in their interiors, then split and
thus multiply due purely to forces of nature, not
due to the explicit actions of the living entities
within them, genes now can begin evolving to
control at least part of the phenotype of those
living entities as a way to support additional
complexity, genes still not involved in creating
self-assembling lipid sacks, but lots of lipid
sacks because lots of lipid waste products from
that plethora of living entities emitting them,
which sacks then self-assemble and get colonized

- living entities, genes entirely controlling their
phenotype, whose capabilities now include
assembling the lipid sacks in which they exist
from lipid molecules those living entities
specialize in creating, but that lipid sack
self-assembly not requiring particularly complex
gene encoding, since it happens spontaneously
anyway; living entities become molecularly
co-extensive with the sacks they inhabit, internal
mechanisms continue to evolve and grow complex

- living entities now definitely living cells,
continue to evolve ever more specialized cell
walls, now much more than simple lipid sacks, with
specialized pores, specialized supporting
structures, specialized cell wall inward and
outward molecule transport mechanisms, specialized
cell wall manipulation mechanisms that make the
entities mobile in interacting with their
environment, all in response to the forces of
evolution acting now via that part of their
chemistry specialized into a genome, genes,
replication, decoding, and assembly mechanisms

Experts in the field can do a much better job than I
did above, but compared to your abuse of your right
to be both stupid and ignorant, that's a fairly good
start.

I know that's all much too difficult for you to
comprehend, and that you'd rather argue against your
strawman verion of reality than against a version of
reality that has some chance of ever having been
real, but don't worry, the akamai onlookers can use
that model to debunk your neverending idiocy in real
time just fine, will-thee-nil-thee, while your
coterie of specialists in abject stupidity beat
themselves to death trying to make it go away by
smashing ignorace against it furiously but injuring
only themselves and their reputations instead.

So your alcohol sodden brain skipped the track
again, as happens most often when you follow up some
challenge for which you have no valid response? And
this is supposed to impress the audience, just how,
one more time? That it will dissuade others by your
horrible example of ethanol-derived demented
behavior not to become drunkards is I suppose some
useful outcome, but there are better ways to
accomplish that goal.

Too, too sad.

because you falsely believe it lends support to some
one of your idiot's agendae, constantly insulting

meaningless mantras in content free postings,
trolling to start inter-newsgroup conflicts,
spamming your talentless anagrams where they have no
audience, lying endlessly, posting non sequiturs as

enough to adopt them would lead to global war, and
you do it because the voice of your non-existent god

The **phrase** you used is meaningless. Accordingly there's not

Unless and until you precisely define what you mean by some

Yeah. Some lipid chemical is a waste product of some replicator, so
it just keeps accumulating in the vicinity of that replicator. If
the replicator has already been trapped in a lipid bubble, then the
molecules released by the replicator will diffuse through the
interior until they reach the membrane, then they will be
spontaeously incorporated into it, making it slightly larger, which
effectively defends it against occasional loss of a lipid molecule.
So long as the replicator is replicating, it's producing lipid
molecules, and the lipid bubble is maintained, perhaps for millions
of years.

&gt; Were these perpetual motion replicators?

No. Per the J.Random auto-catalytic-set hypothesis for abiogenesis,
the Sun fuses hydrogen to produce helium, releasing lots of energy
including ultraviolet photons, some of which travel to Earth and
trigger chemical reactions. Heat leaking from the interior of the
Earth is released in undersea volcanic vents, in the form of
super-heated water and hydrogen sulfide etc., which also trigger
chemical reactions. The replicators are simply combinations of
chemical reactions which use one of these sources of energy, or
some other source such as radioactivity from asteroid/comet
crashes, etc., to make more of themselves.

&gt; Or did they have their own dilithium crystals?

Is there any such thing as dilithium?? If so, why do you think it
would be of any value (as energy source) during the era of abiogenesis?

&gt; So now these &quot;perpetual replicators&quot; can synthesise lipid
&gt; molecules as well?

They're not perpetual, they're just autotrophic.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; which self-incorporated into the bubbles,
&gt; Tell me, after being synthesised, were these &quot;molecules&quot;
&gt; transported somehow?
">

No, they just diffused through the interior of the pre-cell.
Think of it as a random walk with walls in all directions.
There's a 100% chance of eventually striking one of the walls.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; You do understand, that the act of &quot;replication&quot; transfers units
&gt; of hereditary information, right?
">

What do you mean by &quot;transfer&quot;? If you transfer money from your
checking account to your savings account, it's no longer in your
checking account. Nothing like that happens with replication.
Replicate means copy, i.e. the original is still there, but a copy
is now present also now. In the case of a simple catalytic cycle as
the replcator, only part of the catalytic cycle is produced at each
step. For example, consider A -&gt; B -&gt; C -&gt; A, a simple three-step
catalytic cycle. Suppose we start with this set of molecules:
A  B  A  A  C  B  C  B  A  C  C  B  A  A  A  C  A  C  B  A  A  C  A  B
1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24
Now suppose molecule number 16, which is a C, catalyzes the
production of a molecule of A. Now we have ne more molecule of A,
but the same number of B's and C's as before.

It would be reasonable to say that the quantity of genetic
information has been increased, in the sense of more copies of A,
although the non-redundant information hasn't increased since the
new A molecule is identical to each of the old A's. How is that a
&quot;transfer&quot;? Inquiring minds want to understand what you are trying to say.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; A selfreplicator such as a simple ribozyme is its own genome.
">

In an artificial environment with all the chemicals necessary for
ribozyme replication, indeed a ribozyme can catalyze production of
more copies of itself. In this case there's just one molecule in
the auto-catalytic set, so we can speak of an event where the
entire replicator, that one molecule, is increased in quantity,
number of copies.

However IMO that's a completely unreasoable hypothesis for abiogenesis.

And I'm not sure the word &quot;genome&quot; properly applies in such a case.
I guess it depends on how far you wish to extend the usual definition.
What is the &quot;genome&quot; of the hypothetical A -&gt; B -&gt; C -&gt; A cycle?
