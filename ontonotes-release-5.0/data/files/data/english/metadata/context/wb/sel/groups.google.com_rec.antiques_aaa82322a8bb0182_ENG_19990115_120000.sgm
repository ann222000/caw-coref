[  Tattoo.txt  ]
But results vary.

A recent post by Lydia, collector of rat ephemera (and with whom I share an
affection for rodents, though mine are furrier and dumber), once again set an
old ditty running 'round my brain. The song, slightly risqué, concerns &quot;Lydia,
Dear Lydia, Lydia the Tattooed Lady.&quot; I saw Groucho Marx perform it on an
old Dick Cavett segment; I'm sure I could stop humming the tune if I learned the
words. Tracy? Someone else? Help! It's likely vaudeville era, so ought to be
on topic. Sort of.

And Lydia, Dear Lydia, really. No slight intended to your very proper Victorian
self.

Mary

"/> Hi, Mary!

Ask and ye shall receive... The lyrics to Lydia (God help us all!)

===========

Lydia The Tattooed Lady
-----------------------

Oh Lydia, oh Lydia, say, have you met Lydia?
Lydia The Tattooed Lady.
She has eyes that folks adore so,
Lydia, oh Lydia, that encyclo-pidia.
Oh Lydia The Queen of Tattoo.
On her back is The Battle of Waterloo.
Beside it, The Wreck of the Hesperus too.
And proudly above waves the red, white, and blue.
You can learn a lot from Lydia!

La-la-la...la-la-la.
La-la-la...la-la-la.

When her robe is unfurled she will show you the world,
if you step up and tell her where.
For a dime you can see Kankakee or Paree,
or Washington crossing The Delaware.

La-la-la...la-la-la.
La-la-la...la-la-la.

Oh Lydia, oh Lydia, say, have you met Lydia?
Lydia The Tattooed Lady.
When her muscles start relaxin',
up the hill comes Andrew Jackson.
Lydia, oh Lydia, that encyclo-pidia.
Oh Lydia The Queen of them all.
For two bits she will do a mazurka in jazz,
with a view of Niagara that nobody has.
And on a clear day you can see Alcatraz.
You can learn a lot from Lydia!

La-la-la...la-la-la.
La-la-la...la-la-la.

Come along and see Buffalo Bill with his lasso.
Just a little classic by Mendel Picasso.
Here is Captain Spaulding exploring the Amazon.
Here's Godiva, but with her pajamas on.

La-la-la...la-la-la.
La-la-la...la-la-la.

Here is Grover Whelan unveilin' The Trilon.
Over on the west coast we have Treasure Isle-on.
Here's Nijinsky a-doin' the rhumba.
Here's her social security numba.

La-la-la...la-la-la.
La-la-la...la-la-la.

Lydia, oh Lydia, that encyclo-pidia.
Oh Lydia The Champ of them all.
She once swept an Admiral clear off his feet.
The ships on her hips made his heart skip a beat.
And now the old boy's in command of the fleet,
for he went and married Lydia!

I said Lydia...
(He said Lydia...)
They said Lydia...
We said Lydia, la, la!
=============

Blatently plagarized from &lt;http://www.cs.nmt.edu/~jefu/lydia.html&gt;. You
can download an audio file of the song in MP2 or Windows wav format at:
&lt;http://mems.ee.cornell.edu/~mbw/lydia.html&gt;

I must add that this song was written by none other than master
songsmith Harold Arlen. He is perhaps (and hopefully) better known for
these hits:
It's Only a Paper Moon
Come Rain or Come Shine
That Old Black Magic
Ac-Cent-Tchu-Ate The Positive
Stormy Weather

He also wrote numerous show and film scores, including &quot;The Wizard of
Oz.&quot; Yes, he also wrote &quot;Somewhere Over the Rainbow.&quot; From his ASCAP bio:

&quot;Born Buffalo, NY, Feb. 15, 1905. Choir boy in youth; at 15 became
professional pianist in clubs and on lake steamers. Pianist, singer and
arranger for popular orch. From 1930 wrote series of Cotton Club review songs.&quot;

Arlen died in 1986.

But you didn't really care about that, did you?

RAGards,

Tracy

"/> Oops! We're missing a line, Rhiannon! I think this would be part of the
original. I think I accidentally deleted it when I was reformatting -
had to remove a lot of indents. Sorry. Mea culpa.

And darned this thread anyway - I downloaded that silly recording
yesterday and can't stop playing it! Sheesh - 50 pokes with a fresh
tattoo needle, Mary! I, too, suffer from the same syndrome as you.
Therefore, I am unsympathetic.

RAGards,

Tracy

A character in one of my favorite movies, &quot;The Philadelphia Story&quot; sings it.
I love highbrow entertainment!
