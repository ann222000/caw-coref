Osoogun: Village Ajayi Crowther left at 12 as a slave - To which he never
returned

Osoogun, a popular village in Iseyin Local Government area of Oyo State is
synonymous with Bishop Ajayi Crowther, a renowned slave boy turned
clergyman. But in spite of the international status of the Bishop, the
people still live in the stone age with the community lacking basic
amenities of Life. *Olu Osunde *and *Taiwo Olanrewaju* visited the community
recently and report.

Mere mentioning Osoogun, the birth place of a religious legend and the first
Bishop of Anglican Church in Africa, Bishop Samuel Ajayi Crowther could
spark off an adventurous spirit in anyone, any time. The big name behind
this tiny community of about 15,000 people on the northern side of Ibadan
city in Iseyin Local Government council of Oyo State, on the way out to
Badagry and Sokoto, attracts a lot of visitors from different parts of the
world. Unfortunately, although the religious influence of the legendary
Bishop pervades the community as traditional medicine and divination have no
bearing on the people, the entire community with its adjoining villages are
in a sorry state.

Despite its long period of existence which is put at about 200 years and the
present level of technological development, the inhabitants of Osoogun are
still strapped to the old way of life bereft of an iota of civilisation.
Apart from the change from thatched roofs by most of the houses which now
carry corrugated iron, the community in terms of facilities is dead. The
people who are farmers live in tattered shelters with the rust corrugated
iron roofs also suspended by decaying woods. Most of the living houses are
mud and until recently, the people depended on a stream for their daily
water needs. When Sunday Tribune visited recently, the journey to the
historical community was smooth and interesting. Apart from stopping at
check-points to ask for directions, there was nothing too unusual about the
road.

As the Sunday Tribune crew chatted in the car, driving on the well-tarred
Badagry-Sokoto expressway with curiosity looking for a tourism sign post
with information about the place, one of the crew members spotted the name,
Bishop Ajayi Crowther, inscripted in blue ink on a mould and quickly asked
that the car be stopped. In obedience, the driver reversed the vehicle and
veered into the untarred road. Behold! That was the turning to Osoogun. But
for the eagle-eye of the reporter, the crew would have missed its way. It is
unthinkable, that there is no sign-post to herald visitors and tourists to
the birthplace of the first African Bishop, the Late Bishop Samuel Ajayi
Crowther. The inscription that our reporter saw was even the signposts of
the primary and secondary schools in the village. The inscription read thus:
Bishop Ajayi Crowther Memorial High School, Osoogun. Founded: September
1980. Motto: Aspiration with humility. Donated by: JSS III Students
2003/2004 set. While on the right was another inscription, written in green
ink—Bishop Ajayi Crowther Memorial School. St. Mary Anglican School,
Osoogun. A block of 3 classrooms constructed by Oyo State Primary Education
Board.

The first information gathered from our host as we alighted from the vehicle
was that on Friday, 31st August, 2007, four white men from the United States
of America, in company with the Bishop of the Ajayi Crowther Missionary
Diocese, Rt. Revd. O.O.Oduntan, visited the historical village. The august
visitors couldn't have been less disappointed with the rate of development
in the village than the ST crew was. The untarred road to Osoogun is
sandwiched between farmlands while the major means of transportation in the
village is the Okada (motorcycle). Built at the entrance to the village is
the moderately furnished high school while not too far away from it, on the
same left side, is Bishop Ajayi Crowther Memorial Hospital. The ST gathered
that the first two buildings, painted in light blue colour, were the nursing
hostels of the staff who worked at the hospital when it was commissioned in
1970.

Further up was the main hospital building, which has five rooms. The staff
room and examination room were locked up while the ward's key was in the key
hole. The ST crew opened the door to discover five ordinary empty iron beds
without matresses. The crew was trying the handle of the door of the
examination room when two men—one elderly and the other middle aged—jolted
them with greetings. Having explained the crew's mission, the elderly man,
who doubles as the hospital's gardener cum security, said the hospital,
built by Christians, was for some time maintained by the Oyo State
government. According to him, the hospital, now abandoned, used to have a
doctor and eight nurses plus a giant generator, adding that the hospital's
matresses and other equipment were locked up for safe-keeping. He explained
that the hospital, which now has no doctor and nurses, is currently being
managed by the Iseyin Local Government, while the staff comprises a ward
maid, a gardener and a head, who is a professional in community health.

At the back of the main hospital building is the children's ward and
dispensary, now dilapidated and overgrown with bush. Lending credence to
ST's view, the middle-aged man, said that the hospital, which used to be the
glory of Osoogun, providing medical services for her people and those in the
neighbouring villages, is now a shadow of itself. He said that the people of
Osoogun now seek medical services at a private hospital in far away Eruwa,
about 25 kilometers to the community, where they pay through their noses.
&quot;Yesterday, I took a woman to Eruwa for child delivery. She gave birth to
female twins and paid N6,500,&quot; added the Okada rider. The elderly man, who
said he had been working in the hospital since 1976, said the other members
of staff were not around because of the on-going strike in the state. On
source of water, the hospital relies solely on rain water which is stored in
a reservoir. While another reservoir, built during the late Chief Bola Ige's
administration, is used to store well water brought by tankers from Eruwa or
by cyclists from neighbouring villages.

The well, also dug behind the main hospital building is not functional
because rather than get to water during the digging process, a substance
like chalk, powdery form surfaced and the substance is said to be in
abundance in Kainkain, a neighbouring village. A pointer to the fact that a
deposit, which could be useful, is in Osoogun. At the first Anglican Church
built in 1912, the vicar-in-charge, Revd. Emmanuel A. Ajulo, explaining the
pain of having a dead medical centre said, there was a time a man died of a
snake bite before he could be rushed to Eruwa for treatment. According to
the Basorun of Osoogun, Chief Bola Bambi, some foreigners who visited the
village while the hospital was still under construction, doled out £50,000
with which the hospital was completed. Chief Bambi also attested to the fact
that the hospital was well equipped on completion, saying that it had two
ambulances, donated to it by the missionaries and the Oyo State government.
The ambulances, he said had since been withdrawn by the state government.

He also added that the giant generator, which is presently non-functional,
only needs servicing and replacement of its heavy battery. Today, though one
could access information on Osoogun on the internet through the efforts of
its Bishop, Rt. Revd. Oduntan, it is however pitiable that the town is in
total darkness as it lacks electricity. Although there are electricity poles
erected in some places in the village, the termination of the administration
of Governor Lam Adesina, who the villagers said, made effort to ensure the
supply of electricity to the community killed the project. Basorun Bambi
recollected that the committee set up to look into the electrification of
the village went to Ibadan during the regime of Governor Rasheed Ladoja to
see the transformer meant for the village and in the process also met with
the contractor assigned to handle the project, who promised to complete it
by December 2006.

Again, the committee was said to have met with Governor Alao-Akala and the
contractor assigned to the project, adding that Chief Lamidi Adedibu and
Governor Akala, visited Osoogun during the last election campaign with a
promise to look into the problems of the villagers. Also were it not for the
magnanimity of the late Dr. Simi Johnson, a grandson of Bishop Crowther, who
provided a borehole facility, one of our hosts said, the community of over
10,000 people would have still been depending on well or stream water or
both for their day to day activities. Chief Bambi who took the Sunday
Tribune crew round Osoogun community said the second borehole, sunk for them
by the DFFRI, was faulty, while he explained that the functional borehole
was initially powered by solar energy before the local government got it
repaired and changed it to manual. He also informed the crew on what
prompted the DFFRI boss to donate a borehole to the community. The Senior
Chief said when the market, which now holds at Maya village, used to hold at
Osoogun, the DFFRI boss had a stopover on a market day and he, Chief Bambi
entertained him. The DFFRI boss then, perhaps as a result of the
hospitality, asked if there was a borehole facility in the village, to which
the Basorun replied in the negative. The DFFRI boss then promised that the
following Monday, a borehole would be sunk in the village. That was how the
community got the borehole which is now faulty.

Chief Bambi said but for the community's bad and untarred road, the market,
which holds every five days and boasts of traders from all over the nation,
would still be holding in Osoogun. Going down memory lane, Chief Bola Bambi
said it was Papa Alabi Olakoilo, who reestablished Osoogun village on 16th
January, 1912 with the permission of the Alaafin of Oyo. That was after the
war in which Bishop Ajayi Crowther was captured as a slave. Osoogun, the
historical community, which is four miles in circumference is 45 kilometres
to Iseyin, the seat of the Anglican Diocese and the local government
headquarters. It is bordered by about 70 other villages like Igbo-Ilasa,
Araromi, Akinlabi, Onikainkain, Akipopo, Adegbola and Moyaoke among others.
The major occupation of Osoogun male indigenes is farming. They deal in
produce like cocoa, cassava, oranges, pepper, yam and tomatoes. The women,
however, delight in making garri and also breed sheep and goats.

There is no gainsaying that Bishop Crowther's values are firmly entrenched
in Osoogun as the village boasts of only two religions—Christianity and
Islam, with the former in the larger percentage. The Christian denomination
in the village include the Anglican Church, Christ Apostolic Church,
Cherubim and Seraphim Church and the Gospel Church. Although it has no
central palace, the community has a king, who rules from his personal
building. The king, Chief M. Oyebamiji Olalere, the Olosoogun of Osoogun,
was installed on 13th September, 2003. Chief Olalere, who said he was
working in Lagos before he was brought home to be made king, appealed to the
government to provide all necessary facilities in Osoogun, in order to
enable investors site their companies in the village. &quot;Immediately after
their secondary education, our children leave the village for Ibadan and
Lagos but if there is a higher institution here and a company where they can
work, they will stay around and contribute to the development of their
birthplace,&quot; the monarch stated.

He also used the opportunity to appeal to the Anglican Communion, which he
commended so much for its interest in the development of Osoogun, to site
satellite campus of the Bishop Ajayi Crowther University in Osoogun. &quot;We
have accommodation for the students and we also have spacious land,&quot; the
king added. To the Oyo State government, the monarch appealed that a new
local government be carved out of the present Iseyin local government, to
comprise Ado-Awaye and her 40 neighbouring villages and Osoogun and her 70
neighbouring villages, with Osoogun as the headquarters of the local
government.

While proposing Bishop Ajayi Crowther Local Government as the name of the
council, the monarch posited that that gesture would help to hasten the
development of the village. Corroborating the king, Basorun Bambi said, it
was a pity that the Western people of the country do not honour Crowther as
the Easterners. &quot;Well, a king is without honour in his hometown,&quot; he added.
&quot;If you go to Onitsha and Lokoja, you will see the big Cathedral named after
him with his photographs placed there, while another Anglican Theological
College is named after him at Lokoja,&quot; he said. While moving round the
village, Chief Bambi pointed out to the crew the first house built with
corrugated iron sheet in 1959; the spot on which the first house in the
village, which has since been demolished, was also built.

Another important place was the Pastor Samuel Ajayi Crowther Memorial
Tourist Centre, Osoogun. There one unexpetedly need to squint his or her
eyes to be able to read the sign post which inscriptions have faded out. The
spot contained the house Crowther lived with his siblings and parents before
he was captured and sold to slavery. Sunday Tribune crew was also shown the
giant Ose tree, to which Crowther was tied after he was captured. If Osoogun
is developed to a standard tourist centre with all enabling facilities,
Sunday Tribune crew noted that the lives of the people and the purse of the
government would be the better for it. And if not that the crew went on the
journey in a car, it would have had to sleep at Osoogun till 8.a.m the
following morning when the vehicle which plies Ibadan to the village gets
there.

Sunday Tribune gathered that on a daily basis, the vehicle leaves Oritamerin
in Ibadan at 6 a.m and gets to Osoogun at 8 a.m

Bishop ajayi Crowther

12-year-old Ajayi was captured in the same war in which his father, was
captured and nothing has been heard about his father since then. At Badagry,
where the slaves were taken enroute their destination, the elderly man
looking after them was said to have been favourably disposed to Ajayi. He
sent him on errands and had wanted to keep him in Badagry but for the sudden
arrival of the Portuguese slave traders.

BISHOP Samuel Adjai (Ajayi) Crowther (C. 1809 - December 31, 1891) was a
linguist and the first African Anglican Bishop in Nigeria. Born in Osoogun,
Yorubaland, in today's Iseyin Local Government, Oyo State, Nigeria, Rev, Dr.
Samuel Ajayi Crowther was a member of the Yoruba ethnic group but was also a
Sierra Leone Liberated African.

Ajayi was captured by Fulani slave raiders in 1821 and sold to Portuguese
slave traders. Before leaving port, his ship was borded by the British Navy,
and Crowther was taken to Freetown, Sierra Leone and released. While there,
Crowther was cared for by the Anglican Church Missionary Society, who taught
him English.

He converted to Christianity, was baptized by Rev. John Raban, and took the
name Samuel Crowther in 1825 after his master. While in Freetown, Crowther
became interested in languages. In 1826 he was taken to England to attend
Islington Parish School. He returned to Freetown in 1827 and attended the
newly opened Fourah Bay College, an Anglican missionary school, where his
interest in language found him studying Latin and Greek but also Temne.

After completing his studies he began teaching at the school. He also
married Asano Susan, a school mistress, who was also on the Portuguese slave
ship that originally brought Crowther to Sierra Leone and the union was
blessed with three children, two females and male.

In 1841, Crowther was selected to accompany the missionary J.J. Schon, on an
expedition along the Niger River. Together with Schon, he was expected to
learn Hausa for use on the expedition. The goal of the expedition was to
spread commerce, teach agricultural techniques, spread Christianity, and
help end the slave trade. Following the expedition, Crowther was recalled to
England, where he was trained as a minister and ordained by the Bishop of
London.

Rev. Dr. Crowther began translating the Bible into the Yoruba language and
compiling a Yoruba dictionary. In 1843, a grammar book which he started
working on during the Niger expedition was published, and a Yoruba version
of the Anglican Book of Common Prayer followed later. H also began codifying
other language. Following the British Niger Expeditions of 1854 and 1857,
Crowther produced a primer for the Igbo language in 1857, another for the
Nupe language in 1860, and a full grammar and vocabulary of Nupe in 1864. In
1864, Crowther was ordained as the first African Bishop of the Anglican
Church.

That same year he also received a Doctor of Divinity from Oxford University,
Bishop Dr. Crowther's attention was directed more and more to languages
other than Yoruba, but he continued to supervise the translation of the
Yoruba Bible (Bibeli Mimo), which was completed in the mid 1880's, a few
year before he death in 1891, Crowther suffered a stroke and died the last
day of that year.
