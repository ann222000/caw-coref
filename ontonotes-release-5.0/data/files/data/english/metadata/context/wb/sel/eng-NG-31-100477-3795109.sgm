Go ahead then.  Get it plugged.  Drive fast and hard on it.

It beats the crap out of me why anyone would ask a question like this.

Don't you *want* to be confident that your tires are going to maintain
their integrity while you're speeding along and maybe hitting the
inevitable little pothole or two?

Sheesh.  Get over it.  Buy a new tire.

It seems to me that if the puncture is within the TREAD(3/4" in from edge
of tread seems OK to me) that the tire is patchable.

Find another shop.

I'm no expert on this, but I also suspect that 3/4 inch into the tread is
patchable. A second opinion makes sense. If they agree, then it's time to
bite the bullet.

That should be repairable.  If the sidewall is damaged, they usually don't
try to fix them, but punctures in the tread are usually OK to repair.  How
much tread does it have remaining?

This is silly.  There is no risk to patching a tire with a screw in the
tread area.  Especially one this new.  It's dangerous if the puncture is in
the sidewall, but not an inch into the tread.  You must be made of money.

Well,tire stores are primarily in business to -sell- new tires.
Patching tires is a sideline for them.

As in any business,Good stores will help you with repairs as much as
possible,and in YOUR best interests,in order to bring them new business
when you really need new tires,and also for recommendations to others.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I'm inclined to agree. Chrissakes fella, buy a new tire and get on with

&gt;&gt;&gt;Goodyear fixed my tire for $10.

&gt;&gt;And 'Discount Tire' fixed one on my car and one on my wife's Lexus both
&gt;&gt;for nothing. I also get free rotations every 5k miles and free rebalance
&gt;&gt;at each rotation. They even offered to pick up &amp; deliver the wife's car.
&gt;&gt;Of course the fact that I've done all my tire business with them for the
&gt;&gt;past 18 years may have something to do with that.

&gt; And I assume you have had no problems with the plugged tires?

Before we became loyal Discount Tire customers we went to Cobre Tire in
Phoenix. They patched and repatched a tire we had maybe four times before
they got the patch to stay on. Hmm. Discount Tire never had that problem
with any of the punctures we took there.

In the last year or so the local Discount Tire has plugged the holes, and I
can do that. I've plugged maybe a half dozen holes over the years, mostly in
the boondocks or early in the morning when I wanted to get to work, and
never had a problem.

You should never plug a tire.  The repair is to boot or patch from the
inside.  If the hole is close to the sidewall and not on the tread, you
should write it off as the repair will be unreliable.

I've been plugging them with the $2 string kit since the '60s and have yet
to ever have a leak or failure on any size or speed tire.

When I got my new Infiniti, I heard about this and took it to the dealer
thinking they would do the more elaborate "recommended" method.  They used
the same string plug I could have bought at Wal-Mart for $2 (but charged
$17).  The only places I have ever encountered that do anything else are
Discount Tire and NTB.

I think this "never plug a tire" deal is another of those car repair urban
legends that gains popularity simply by virtue of each successive advocate
screaming a little louder about it.

Tell me - how many of you out there have ever actually experienced a tire
failure due to a plug?

While I agree with what they say, I have never found it to be an issue.  OK,
the manufacturer no longer supports a plugged tire's original speed rating.
When is the last time you ran your tire up to the original rated speed (130
MPH for an "H" rated tire)?

Since the vast majority of tire shops and dealers (at least the ones around
here) appear to ignore this and use string plugs anyway, it can't really be
that big a deal.

Good for you.  You are a man of conviction. Far be it for me to change your
mind. My experience with reputable tire stores is, however, otherwise as the
"boot" repair that includes checking the tire out is preferred.  In fact,
the stores I have dealt with won't do it any other way.  And, the repair
usually runs around $20-25 which includes balancing.  If you are on your
second set of tires, many stores will also throw in repair free as a part of
the road hazard warranty.  I run an 01 Prelude on the highway a lot, and
while I certainly have never taken the car to its 140 max, I do run around
80 or so.  I like to have to best repair possible on a tire in such
circumstances -- in fact under any circumstances given the cost.

As you say, if you bought the road hazard warranty, free repairs are usually
included.  Around here, only Discount Tire and NTB do the "recommended"

service, do it free even if you didn't buy the tires from them. The problem
is that neither of them can balance a tire to save their lives, so you end
up with a properly patched tire that bounces around like a rock, until you
take it somewhere else and pay to have it re-balanced.

The term 'balancing' itself is subjective since there's several ways to do
it. Off the car, vs. spin-balanced on the car, vs spin-balanced on the car
while UNDER LOAD. Not many shops can do the latter, although some tire
experts will swear 'under load' is the only true way to accurately balance
a tire and will also result in the quietest operation at highway speeds.

The shop I deal with uses the latest Hunter Force balancing equipment.  The
under load balancing is the way to go I believe.

Most of the time it probably doesn't make a difference - I've been happy
with the balance on most of the tires I've had. But I recently got a new
F350 Super Duty truck at work and took it back to Ford because when I hit
even small bumps on the freeway the truck shook violently for a couple
seconds. They replaced all 4 tires. I was skeptical, but that cured the
problem. Huh. A couple of people who had followed me on the freeway said the
left rear tire was constantly flexing, so maybe it was a defect... or maybe
it was a weird balance problem.

I've heard good things about the Hunter equipment - that it will identify
problems that go undetected otherwise. There are sure enough weird tire
problems to make the equipment worthwhile.

My experience says the equipment is irrelevant.  Some places insist their
techs take the time to do it right and some don't.  If you watch the techs
in action, you can usually tell at a glance how its going to turn out by how
irreverently they are throwing the tire around on the machine and pounding
weights all over the wheel.

HUNTER brand tire machines have been used in tire shops for about as many
years as I've been driving, which dates back to the '60s. Obviously they
manufacture all varieties of tire servicing equipment, from old fashioned
manual mallet &amp; prybar breakdown fixtures on up to the latest state of the
art GPS9700 Road Force balancing system (about $28k so I was told)

http://www.hunter.com/pub/product/balancer/4159T/index.htm

Find a tire shop with one of these and you've found "your" tire shop.

I have always had tires patched. However the last flat I had  the tire was
plugged. Never failed but did have a slight leak or so it seems. I check the
air in my tires every other week and that particular tire always seemed to
be a pound or two light.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I have a screw in my tire. I have been told that the tire cannot be
&gt;&gt;&gt; repaired because the hole is so close to the sidewall. It's about 3/4
&gt;&gt;&gt; of an inch from the side, right after the first row of thread. I would
&gt;&gt;&gt; appreciate your opinion / advice.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Cheers!

&gt;&gt;&gt; --
&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;I refuse to answer that question on the grounds
&gt;&gt;&gt; that I don't know the answer.&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt; - Douglas Adams

&gt;&gt; You should never plug a tire.  The repair is to boot or patch from the
&gt;&gt; inside.  If the hole is close to the sidewall and not on the tread, you
&gt;&gt; should write it off as the repair will be unreliable.

&gt; I've been plugging them with the $2 string kit since the '60s and have yet
&gt; to ever have a leak or failure on any size or speed tire.

&gt; When I got my new Infiniti, I heard about this and took it to the dealer
&gt; thinking they would do the more elaborate &quot;recommended&quot; method.  They used
&gt; the same string plug I could have bought at Wal-Mart for $2 (but charged
&gt; $17).  The only places I have ever encountered that do anything else are
&gt; Discount Tire and NTB.

&gt; I think this &quot;never plug a tire&quot; deal is another of those car repair urban
&gt; legends that gains popularity simply by virtue of each successive advocate
&gt; screaming a little louder about it.

&gt; Tell me - how many of you out there have ever actually experienced a tire
&gt; failure due to a plug?

I like the "boot" repair idea.
I'll now check around for who does that repair in my area and have it noted
in the event I ever need it and hopefully near them when needed.

&gt;&gt; &gt; Read the following at this site at Tire Rack --

&gt; http://www.tirerack.com/tires/tiretech/techpage.jsp?techid=77&amp;current...

&gt;&gt; While I agree with what they say, I have never found it to be an issue.
&gt; OK,
&gt;&gt; the manufacturer no longer supports a plugged tire's original speed
&gt; rating.
&gt;&gt; When is the last time you ran your tire up to the original rated speed
&gt; (130
&gt;&gt; MPH for an &quot;H&quot; rated tire)?

&gt;&gt; Since the vast majority of tire shops and dealers (at least the ones
&gt; around
&gt;&gt; here) appear to ignore this and use string plugs anyway, it can't really
&gt; be
&gt;&gt; that big a deal.

&gt; Good for you.  You are a man of conviction. Far be it for me to change
&gt; your
&gt; mind. My experience with reputable tire stores is, however, otherwise as
&gt; the
&gt; &quot;boot&quot; repair that includes checking the tire out is preferred.  In fact,
&gt; the stores I have dealt with won't do it any other way.  And, the repair
&gt; usually runs around $20-25 which includes balancing.  If you are on your
&gt; second set of tires, many stores will also throw in repair free as a part
&gt; of
&gt; the road hazard warranty.  I run an 01 Prelude on the highway a lot, and
&gt; while I certainly have never taken the car to its 140 max, I do run around
&gt; 80 or so.  I like to have to best repair possible on a tire in such
&gt; circumstances -- in fact under any circumstances given the cost.
