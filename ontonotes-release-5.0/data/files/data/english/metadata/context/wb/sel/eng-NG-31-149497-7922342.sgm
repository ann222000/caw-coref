Christian's you seem to be forgettingthat what is written in
the 'bible' is theonly 'truth' in the world. That meansthere were no
dinosaurs, because thefirst animals were pigs, chickens, etc.Either
that or mammals and life as weknow it today came before dinosaurs.It
cannot be changed, it cannot beobfuscated with psuedoscience. What
iswritten their is written their. If itis the book of truth there are
noother meanings and there is only oneinterpretation of it. Yes, there
maybe a god or gods but not in the matterwe know it. I tend to be on
the sideof deism. Science does not have all theanswers but a few
hundred years agothe things we know today would have beenuncompresible
to scientists then. Thereis many other things as well, if yourreligion
is one of love then why isit that there is so much murder inthe Old
Testament? In the bible, if youtwits actually read it that it is
saidthat King David kidnapped a women forhis wife, impregnated her,
killed herhusband and then his punishment was the death of an innocent
child. In genesis 19:30 it reads that a man(Lot) was drunken by his
daughters and over a period of two nights impregnated them. Moses told
men to kill all male children, all women who had laid with men before
and then keep the female children alive for themselves. A man was also
struck down for not impregnating his wife in the bible. In these days
of sin why do God not reveal himself. I'd love to believe in God, I
prayed to him to reveal himself to me, I said if he did so I'd give my
life to christianity and I meant it. But he did not. There are also
proofs of reincarnation as well as NDE so thus what do you believe?
Proof of ghosts too? See it's all stupid, there is no true proof! Also
everybody agrees on what heaven is but not hell? Look at this way,
after your already recieving the worse imaginable punishment you have
nothing else to lose, that means in theory, your invincible. After a
1000 years you should get into the groove of it eh? It would make no
difference to you after so long, you'd have nothing worse that could
happen to you. I happen to know that depression is far worse then hell,
living all your mistakes in life would be the worse hell. The bible
also goes against intellectual pursuits, no eating from the tree of
knowledge, lucifer who questioned things was condemned and deamed evil?
Plus demons are far more evil then mortals, so shouldn't hell punish
them too? Shouldn't the devil be punished instead of having to punish
others. What does he care anyway? Shouldn't he let us run wild in hell?
I mean it would be a place of utter archary(pardon my spelling). Also
if scientific truths(an atom is an atom whether your in iraq or canada)
are universal shouldn't religion be too? That means there should be one
religion. Why doesn't god reveal himself to save the heathens, I mean
hell he could save the world that way. Judgement day is not near, all
throughout history people have said times of demise, 2000 came and
went. We'll destroy ourselfs. No science doesn't have all the answers,
but nether those God. After all, could god make a rock so heavy he
could not lift it? If god is all forgiving why does he stop in the
afterlife, it would be better to work towards heaven after death
instead of condeming you to fire. Why does god permit evil, or why is
there evil? Why did he make us imperfect? Why did he give us a curious
nature, so we'd get kicked out of eden. There are many more questions
to ask, unanswered ones. Don't try to convert me, I'd rather burn in
your hell and paradise is living life to the fulliest.PS: Hitler was a
satantist, he was also into the occult, look into it ;).visit

atheism.I have an interesting article on my site here:

Also, if adam, eve, cain and abel were the first people on earth how
did we repopulate? Incest anyone? Incest is as common in the bible as
murder. Stone to death anyone of any other religion, kill 'witches'. By
witches that means people who practise wicca today, if you look into
it, that it would really mean kill pagans. That is why demons have
horns, because of the god Pan. What for another hundred years, science
will have answers for NDEs, OBEs, ghosts, gods, big bangs, etc. Hell,
give it another ten years. Why is it that god as human qualities? It is
written in the bible it does so do not say god could just be a glowing
orb. In addition to this most religion dates back to pagan beliefs,
egpytian belief, summerian belief or something to boost moral of
people. We have the advantage of god for example while they have no god
so we will win. In the bible it says if one comes face to face with god
he will die but moses faces him and lives. If you eat forbidden fruit
you die it says but later it says that adam and eve were expelled from
eden. If your religion is one of love why are homosexuals codemned, why
are those who practise sex not for making babies codemned? Sexual
repression ends up in tragdety, like priests molesting children. We are
sexual beings accept it, no matter what you cannot fully supress
sexuality. Humans are not perfect thus no human shall make it to
heaven, belief or not.
