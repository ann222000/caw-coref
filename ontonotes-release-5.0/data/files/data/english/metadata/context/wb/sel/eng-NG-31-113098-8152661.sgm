Brown's Iranian dilemma

The prime minister wants to stay close to the US, but backing military
action against Iran would cost him dearly.

David Mepham

The first two months of Gordon Brown's premiership have seen a welcome
change of tone in British foreign policy. But stylistic change is not
enough. There are critical foreign policy challenges facing the UK
that require Brown to make a substantive break with the approach of
his predecessor.

Nowhere is this more necessary than in relation to Iran. In his final
year in Downing Street, Tony Blair dramatically escalated his rhetoric
on Iran, echoing the Bush administration in asserting that the regime
in Tehran was the main obstacle to peace in the Middle East and needed
to be confronted. He also refused to rule out military action against
Iran. If Blair was still in office there is little doubt that he would
have supported yesterday's announcement by the US administration that
it will designate the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps as a global
terrorist organisation. As Simon Tisdall noted in his comment piece
yesterday, this is largely symbolic, but is designed by Washington to
further tighten the screws on Tehran.

As an alternative, Gordon Brown's government should be pursuing a more
creative and calibrated policy towards Iran, that offers a realistic
prospect of de-escalating the current crisis, not least by trying to
try to influence the thinking of the US administration before it is
too late.

There is real evidence that the &quot;hawks&quot;, most notably Dick Cheney, are
winning the argument with George Bush on Iran. For them it is simply
unacceptable that Iran should go nuclear under any circumstances and
they believe that military force should be used to prevent this
outcome. There is now a distinct possibility that military strikes
will happen before the end of the Bush presidency.

It would obviously be extremely undesirable for Iran to acquire a
nuclear weapons capability. Any increase in the number of states with
nuclear weapons weakens the Non-Proliferation Treaty and the existing
international norm against the acquisition of nuclear capabilities,
and heightens the risks of their use. In the case of Iran, there are
additional concerns about the nature of the Iranian regime, anxieties
heightened by Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's offensive and inflammatory remarks
about Israel. An Iranian bomb could also trigger a process of nuclear
proliferation across the Middle East as a whole.

But military action against Iran would make a dangerous and volatile
situation immeasurably worse. If the Iranians are serious about
acquiring nuclear weapons, then it is impossible to believe that they
won't have taken measures to conceal their fledgling programme. The
idea that there are some obvious targets that can be easily
neutralised through strategic bombing is foolish. But a bombing
strategy would inevitably produce civilian casualties. If nuclear
material is hit there is a danger of widespread contamination and
large-scale fatalities. In a highly nationalistic country, that would
be likely to rally public opinion behind the existing regime.

Moreover, the Iranians are well placed to hit back at the west, most
obviously in Iraq and Afghanistan, but also in Syria, Lebanon and
Palestine. And although the Iranians are predominantly Shia and al-
Qaida is a Sunni movement, it is highly likely that a military attack
on Iran would provide a further stimulus to global Islamic radicalism
and to anti-western Islamic terrorism. Oil prices would go through the
roof, with severe consequences for the global economy.

None of this means that we should be remotely na√Øve about Iran's
current leadership or lessen our determination to deny it a nuclear
bomb. But it does mean facing up to the disastrous consequences of
military action and exploring more assiduously some of the saner
alternatives.

The UK should continue to back UN sanctions on Iran. In July,
international pressure appeared to have produced a limited
breakthrough, with a deal between the International Atomic Energy
Agency and the Iranians allowing new inspections and safeguards at key
nuclear facilities. However Tehran continues to enrich uranium, in
defiance of the UN Security Council. This is a critical sticking point
between the west and Iran and it is not addressed in the latest
agreement. If the Iranians persist in ignoring the will of the UN
Security Council, a Brown government should be prepared to support
further sanctions.

However, economic pressure alone is unlikely to be sufficient to
resolve this crisis. As yesterday's Guardian leader rightly pointed
out, if the Iranian regime is to be persuaded to forgo the development
of a nuclear weapons capability, it is going to want some kind of
concrete guarantee that the US and others will not launch a military
attack on Iran or otherwise seek to bring down the regime. In return,
western governments would clearly want to see a shift in Iranian
policy towards Hamas and Hizbullah and in relation to Iraq. What has
been described as a &quot;grand bargain&quot; will be extremely hard to pull
off, but it represents the most plausible strategy for de-escalating
this crisis and bringing a greater degree of stability to the region.

Working with others, Brown's government should use its diplomatic
influence very actively in support of such a policy and to help
persuade the Americans and the Israelis of the acute perils of the
military option. The US should also be urged by the UK and others to
open unconditional talks with the Iranian leadership.

Gordon Brown has made it plain that he wants to stay close to the US
and to the Bush administration during its remaining years in office.
But he must also know the political price he would pay were Britain to
line up once again with the Americans in backing military action
against Iran. How Brown handles this issue over the next year or so
could be as defining for his foreign policy and his premiership as was
Blair's ill-fated decision to back George Bush in going to war with
Iraq.
