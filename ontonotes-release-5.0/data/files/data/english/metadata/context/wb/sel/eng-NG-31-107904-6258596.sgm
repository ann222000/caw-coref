Through lane backed up about 1/2 mile at the light..
Left turn only lane full of assholes who run up to the light and then
try to cut in front of the line..

If it were a cop, I'd camp out at this intersection and ticket every
asshole who cut into the line instead of turning left as directed by
the arrows.

Alternatives:
1.  Stand between the lanes with a steel-framed sign on an 8-foot
length of 3/4" pipe.  The sign says: " If you cut into the line, I'll
smack your car with this sign!".

2. Stand nearby with my camera, telephoto lens.  Photograph the face
of each line cutter and show a sign that says "Line cutters: See
yourself on www.AtlantaAssholes.com "  (available domain name..)

3. Stand by the intersection with a screw gun and and a collection of
screws threaded through heavy metal washers, stamped with the text:
"This is for being a line-jumping asshole"  Run up to each car as it
cuts into the line and screw a disk into a tire sidewall, creating a
severe imbalance (reminder to replace the tire.)

4. Nail &amp; glue spike strips between the lanes late at night.

5. Shoot them. (Unfortunately, this would  clog up the through lane
even more than the line cutting does, so it's not a viable option.)

There is a similar situation on my commute home each day. The right turn
lane backs up into the right lane... ok, np, just drive in the left lane.
Except someone decides to use the left lane to pass those that are queued
up and then tries to cut in front of as many drivers as he can, usually
blocking both straight lanes at least in part after clearing the first
part of the backup.

How about just accelerating briskly when one attempts to cut in front of
you?  If everyone did this, they'd catch on right quick.

That just opens up a space behind me, which they jump into.  If I
match speed with them, they just stay put, and I end up blocking the
through lane.

I used to do something similar--but I would actually turn left (on
arrow), make a U turn, and turn left again. Amazingly, it was
significantly faster than going straight.

Yup.  The town I used to live in, you could NOT turn left on the main drag
without waiting for a half hour or more.  But you could -immediately- turn
right, left into parking lot, U-turn in parking lot, then right out of
parking lot...   :)  I must have done that at least once or twice a
ek.   -Dave

Last time I ran into that situation, I turned onto a side street, then
took the next through street parallel to the main drag.  It made a good
bypass.  The situation was the run at the gas pumps on the afternoon of
11 Sept. '01, and I was headed home from work.  I needed gas, but
decided to wait a couple of hours.  By 1900 hours I just had to wait
for one motorist at the pump.  Kirksville was one of the very few
places in MO that day that did not use the event as an excuse to gouge
the drivers.

It's simple.  Walk up to them and tell them to get out of the car, you're
going to kick their ass for cutting in.

Then do it.

Caution, only do this if you can.  If you can't, just sit back there and
stew like you're doing.

That's because you don't really drive.  I know this, because if you are
as dumb as you post, you'd be dead by now if you actually drove.

I've done that. A series of *LEGAL* movements that accomplished the same
end. Nothing wrong with it because it doesn't impact anyone else.

I love it at the big car races in Las Vegas, like NASCAR.  Highway patrol
does camp out there, and grab everyone who goes outside the lines and passes
on the shoulder.  They then have them pull to an area where they have to
wait to get a ticket.  Usual time, thirty minutes.  They are then sent back
on the freeway in the opposite direction and have to go back to the next
exit, and get in line again.

You would think these people would get it by now.  But they don't, and NHP
writes a ton of tickets every race.

I love it when everyone else who DID wait in line passes the ticket queue
and waves and points and honks and shouts comments.

Priceless.
