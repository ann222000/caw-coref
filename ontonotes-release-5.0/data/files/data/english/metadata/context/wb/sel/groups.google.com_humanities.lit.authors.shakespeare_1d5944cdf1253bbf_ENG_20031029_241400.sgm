Further Into the Depths of Satan in C.S. Lewis' Chronicles of Narnia
Dionysus, Bacchus, Silenus and the Maenads by Mary Van Nattan

&lt;&lt;[C.S. Lewis] portrayed Dionysus (Bacchus), Silenus
and the MAENADS as good characters in his stories!

Now, note here that Lewis actually names the MAENADS and describes them
as &quot;FIERCE&quot;. He adds the flutes &amp; cymbals, and animals are brought in,
though their fate at the hands of the MAENADS is carefully excluded.

He also describes them going down a hill into town where they found
a girls' school. The girls were dressed in ugly tight collars, thick
stockings and tight hair-dos. The teacher &amp; class all fled in terror
except one girl. Aslan called her &quot;SWEETHEART&quot; and asked her to
join his wild crowd, which she did. She was instantly dancing
with the MAENADS who helped her take off some of
her &quot;unnecessary&quot; and uncomfortable clothes!

We have already determined that the real identity of Aslan in The
Chronicles of Narnia is actually the sun god, but Lewis allowed and
promoted the notion that this was an allegory of Biblical truth and
that Aslan was indeed a picture of Christ Jesus - God in the flesh.

On page 170 of _The Last Battle_ Lewis has Digory saying,

&quot;It's all in Plato, all in Plato.&quot;

Lewis calls Plato &quot;an overwhelming theological genius&quot;&gt;&gt;
------------------------------------------------------------------
(1939) Encyclopedia Britannica on &quot;Drama&quot;

HERODOTUS had a lot to say
about TRAGEDY (i.e., a goat-song) being
a PATHOS (i.e., the violent death of Dionysus/Osiris
by &quot;SPARAGMOS&quot; or dismemberment):

&lt;&lt;. . .we have the express testimony of HERODOTUS that the ritual
worship of Dionysus (the god of Drama) was the same as the ritual
worship of Osiris such that it involved a &quot;sparagmos&quot;
(dismemberment), mourning, search, discovery and resurrection.&gt;&gt;

However, HERODOTUS avoided directly mentioning
Dionysus OR Osiris in this regard:

&quot;When the Egyptians lament the god
whom I may not name in this connection&quot;
&quot;They lament but whom they lament I must not say&quot; -- HERODOTUS

For in the manner of ancient religion, it was always necessary
that Dionysus or Osiris be represented by some surrogate.

In fact, ALL TRAGIC HEROS are simply surrogates of Dionysus/Osiris:

&lt;&lt;We find a frequent sparagmos of beings who have committed some sin:

Pentheus by MAENADS
Orpheus by MAENADS
Lycurgus by horses
HYPPOLYTUS by horses
Dirce by a bull
Actaeon by hounds. . .

This use of a surrogate was made easier by the fact that both
at Eleusis and in the Osiris rite the myth was conveyed
by *tableaux* (i.e., 'things shown') rather than by words.

Thus the death of Pentheus, wearing Dionysiac dress,
would be shown by exactly the same tableau as that of Dionysus.

THE TRUTH COULD BE SHOWN TO THE WISE
AND AT THE SAME TIME VEILED FROM *THE UNKNOWING*

Such facts help to explain the charge of
&quot;profaning the mysteries&quot; brought against AESCHYLUS.&gt;&gt;

Legends of the Argolid by: David Lindsey

Commentary

In the Classical Era, the Northern Peloponesus was dominated by three
powerful cities: Argos, Tiryns, and Mycenae. The myths of Argos are
some of the oldest in Greek lore, and are some of the most confused. A
lot of this confusion stems from the attempts to merge the sea and earth
worshiping local religions with the myths of a powerful sky-god brought
into Greece by later invaders. The legends of Argos, though not
complete, stretch from the beginnings of human existence
to the time of the Trojan War.

The First Man, the Founding of Phoroneia

Argos achieved prominence in the theater of Greek mythology by claiming
its roots. According to its legends, it was along the banks of the
mighty river Inachus that man first appeared. The god of the river,
along with his consort, Melia, fathered Phoroneus, the first man, and
Io, whose importance to the local legend will be seen later. Phoroneus
was said to have first sacrificed to the goddess, Hera, and to have made
the goddess a suit of armor. For this reverence, the goddess rewarded
Phoroneus with kingship among the early Argives. Phoroneus founded the
fledgling city of Phoroneia on the future site of Argos. The gods were
so enchanted by the new city that they vied for its stewardship. When
Phoroneus chose Hera over Poseidon as the city-god, Poseidon angrily
dried up all of the streams and rivers of the region, even slowing
the mighty Inachus to a trickle. Hera, on the other hand, located
her chief shrine there, and on the hill known as the Heraeum,
she was worshiped in historical times.

The Family of Phoroneus

Phoroneus was credited by the Argives with the discovery of fire, a
contrast to the usual story of Prometheus. He had illicit relations
with a nymph by the name of Teledice (who was also admired by Zeus), and
fathered a son, Apis (or Serapis), and a daughter, Niobe. Apis went on
to become the king of Aetolus. By his wife, Cerdo, whose origins are
unclear, Phoroneus was the father of Car, the founder Megara. Niobe
fell into the clutches of Zeus, and was his first mortal lover.
She bore a son Argus, who succeeded Phoroneus, and gave Phoroneia
its historical name. The line after Argus is unclear
until the time of Danaus.

The Beginnings of the Line of Danaus

Zeus's discretion soon gave way again, and he wooed Io, the aunt of
Niobe. Ovid tells the story of how Zeus was almost caught romancing
her, when Hera was detained in her pursuit by Echo, who was subsequently
punished. Knowing that his jealous wife was near, Zeus changed Io into a
white cow, and presented her as a gift to Hera. Suspicious, Hera ordered
Argus Panoptes, a hundred-eyed brigand, to guard Io. Zeus, still eager
to consummate the romance, sent Hermes to retrieve her. When the
unsleeping giant proved unrelenting, Hermes bored Argus to sleep with
stories, and killed him. Io may have been freed, but her trials were
far from over. Hera, aware of the trick, and angry at Io, sent a
gadfly named Brize to sting her. Other sources relate that Io was also
tormented by the Furies. Driven into a frenzy, Io wandered all around
the world. In Egypt, Zeus restored her, and finally had his way with
her. AESCHYLUS tells of an encounter between Io and Prometheus
in which he predicts that a descendant of hers will release him.

The Story of Epaphus

Io bore Epaphus to Zeus in Africa. Some say that Io was impregnated
with only a touch from Zeus. This is why her son was named Epaphus,
which means &quot;he of the touch.&quot; Hera, still jealous, took away Io's
young son, causing her to roam the earth in search of him. Only the
persuasion of Zeus made Hera relent. At last, Epaphus was found in
Syria, and was brought back to Egypt. Epaphus took Memphis, the
daughter of the god of the Nile River, as his bride. In her honor, he
built the Egyptian city of Memphis. Epaphus is sometimes associated
with Apis, the Egyptian bull-god. Ovid tells how it was Epaphus who
goaded Phaethon into proving his parentage by attempting to ride the
sun-chariot. Io is sometimes identified with Isis, another Egyptian
deity. In her wanderings, Io was said to have brought
the image of Demeter to Egypt.

More Migrations

Epaphus was the father of Libya and Lysianassa. Libya was the mother of
twins, Agenor and Belus, by Poseidon. Agenor migrated to Phoenician
lands and there established a dynasty. His son, Phoenix, gave his name
to the people of the region, but two of his other offspring, Cadmus
and Europa, have significant myths as well. Cadmus was the founder of
the city of Thebes, in Boeotia, and Europa was the mother of important
Cretan characters. Belus stayed in Egypt, and took Ancinoe as his wife.

The Return of Danaus

Now, Belus had two sons, Aegyptus and Danaus, who did not get along. In
hopes of reconciling, Aegyptus asked that his fifty sons might marry the
fifty daughters of Danaus. Danaus opposed the match. With the help of
Athena, he built a ship, and fled back to Argos. As thanks for the
goddess's help, Danaus dedicated a statue to her when he put in at
Rhodes on the way across the sea. In Argos, he found that Gelanor
was king, and asserted his right to the throne, being of the family
of Phoroneus. Gelanor, himself a descendant of Phoroneus, was first
opposed to turning over his kingdom, but was swayed by an omen he
observed. Among his herds, he saw a wolf come into the field and kill
the lead bull. He took this omen on face, and relinquished the throne.

Death of the Sons of Aegyptus

Soon Aegyptus came to Argos, following his brother, and Danaus seemingly
gave in to his pleas. Secretly, he outfitted his daughters with
daggers, and ordered them to kill their new husbands on their wedding
night. Forty-nine of the Danaids did as their father demanded, bringing
the severed heads of their husbands to their father as proof. The heads
of the forty-nine victims were buried on the Larisa, but the headless
trunks of their bodies were carried off to Lerna for burial. Only
Hypermnestra did not obey her father's orders. For she favored her
husband, Lynceus, who had respected her virginity. Initially, she was
imprisoned for this disobedience, but Danaus eventually gave his
approval to the match, and chose Abas, the son of Lynceus and
Hypermnestra as his heir (though some say Lynceus, himself,
succeeded Danaus, and was, in turn, succeeded by his own son).

Other Deeds of the Danaids

On the orders of Zeus, the Danaids were purified by Hermes and Athena.
They were later punished in the underworld for their sins. Danaus, now
king of Argos, established the worship of Apollo in the region,
dedicating the temple of Apollo Lykeios, the wolf-god, recalling the
omen that had brought him to power. After the fiasco of their first
weddings, Danaus had trouble giving his daughters as brides to the local
people. To stimulate interest, he offered them as prizes to winners
of footraces, and gave shields as a dowry to his new sons-in-law.

The Story Told in The Suppliants

AESCHYLUS, in the only extant play in a trilogy on the fate of the
Danaids, told a different story of Danaus's arrival into Argos. In The
Suppliants, the Danaids and their father come to Argos and beg king
Pelasgus for protection from Aegyptus. While the details of the
sequel are lost, the play reflects a second and different tradition.

Poseidon Relents in his Drought

Poseidon had persisted in ravishing the land with a severe drought for
several generations, because of his anger over not receiving stewardship
of the city of Argos. However, an encounter he had with a Danaid
softened his heart. Danaus sent his daughter, Amymone, out to find
water. While wandering about the countryside, Amymone was attacked by a
satyr, or goat-man. Poseidon nobly saved her, chasing the lustful satyr
away, but was captivated by the girls beauty. The god wooed her
himself. After enjoying her affections, Poseidon struck the ground with
his trident, and produced the Lernean spring by which the girl was
remembered. Amymone gave birth to a son, Nauplius, who was an adept
sailor, and founded the Argive port of Nauplia, which was
soon populated with Egyptian followers of Danaus.

The Family of Perseus

Sometime after the death of Danaus, Abas, son of Hypermnestra and
Lynceus, assumed the throne. By Agleia, Abas was the father of twins,
Proetus and Acrisius, who did not get along, quarreling even in their
mother's womb. Acrisius chased Proetus out of Argos, and took over the
kingship in due course. Proetus fled to Lycia, where he befriended king
Iobates, significant in the legend of Bellerophon. Iobates gave Proetus
his daughter, Stheneboea, and helped him make an attack on Argos to
reclaim his share of the kingdom. Acrisius allowed Proetus to establish
his own capital near Argos, and the city of Tiryns was founded.
The Greeks believed that the Cyclopes themselves
built the strong walls of the city.

The Birth of Perseus

Acrisius was warned by an oracle that his grandson would one day kill
him. Accordingly, he locked his daughter, Danae in a bronze tower.
There, the lonely girl was visited by Zeus, who made his entrance
as a shower of gold. Danae acquiesced to the gods advances,
and was the mother of a child she named Perseus. For four years,
she kept the boy a secret, but he was finally discovered.

Growing up on Seriphos

Fearful of the oracle, Acrisius placed both mother and child in a chest,
and set it adrift on the sea. When the chest floated ashore on the isle
of Seriphos, the fisherman, Dictys, saved them, and released them from
the chest. Polydectes, brother of Dictys, was the king, and eyed Danae
with amorous intentions. However, he was restrained from making his
move by the presence of the boy. Time passed, and Perseus grew strong.
Once, Perseus was required to pay a fee of a horse to enter a party held
by the king. Perseus boasted that he could just as easily have gotten
the head of Medusa as a price. Eager to get the boy out of the way,
Polydectes took him to task on his claims, in hopes that Perseus would
not return. Other accounts relate that Perseus was too poor to provide
the horse, and offered to bring Polydectes anything else that he
required. The king then ordered him to retrieve Medusa's head.

Perseus Takes Up the Quest

Fetching the head of the Gorgon, Perseus then realized, was a daunting
task. He would first have to travel to a remote land, and then he would
face the Gorgons, whose gaze was so hideous that one look could turn a
man to stone. Perseus wandered off from the crowd, troubled by the quest
he had been given, but the gods were on his side. Athena and Hermes
come to his aid. They told him to visit the Graeae, the daughters of
Phorcys and Ceto, and the cousins of the Gorgons. They were a sad
threesome of old ladies, who shared only one eye, and one tooth among
themselves. Under duress, he could learn from them the location of a
special group of nymphs. These nymphs would help Perseus in his quest.

Perseus Secures his Tools

The Graeae proved unwilling to give Perseus any help, but were convinced
when the hero took their eye, and tooth. He held these objects for
ransom until they provided him with the directions. According to some
accounts, Perseus then discarded the items, but some say he graciously
returned them. The nymphs proved helpful indeed, outfitting Perseus
with a number of objects to help him in his quest. They gave him a cap
of darkness, winged sandals, and a kibisis (or leather wallet, to put
the monster's head in). Hermes also visited Perseus,
and provided him with a scimitar (a type of sword).

Perseus Kills Medusa

The details of Perseus's travels to the realm of the Gorgons are
apparently inconsequential, as they are not emphasized in the legend.
One area of debate among the ancients was the precise location of the
Gorgon's Lair. Some said they lived in Africa, among the Ethiopian
peoples, while others said that they stayed to the west near the waters
of Ocean. Still others placed them to the north among the Hyperboreans,
a charmed people, blessed by the gods. At any rate, the winged sandals
bore Perseus to their lair, and the task of putting Medusa to death lay
before him. The standard account of the encounter has Perseus gazing
only at the monster's reflection in his bronze shield as he slew her,
cutting off her head with the scimitar. He placed the head in the
kibisis, and set out for Seriphos. To hide himself from the other
Gorgons, he wore the cap of darkness. When Medusa's sisters found her
dead, they moaned and wailed so harmoniously that Athena fashioned the
flute to imitate the sounds. However, the goddess quickly gave up the
instrument because playing it distorted her beautiful face.

The Offspring of Medusa

The full, sad story of Medusa has not been told. The Gorgons were the
daughters of Phorcys and Ceto, who were among a family of sea divinities
descended from Ge. Their sister's the Greaae play a role in this legend,
and their brother, Ladon figures prominently in the story of Heracles.
Of the Gorgons, only Medusa was mortal. Unlike her sisters, she was a
beautiful creature, and the object of Poseidon's desire. He raped her
in a precinct sacred to Athens, and the goddess angrily disfigured
Medusa, making snakes grow from her head where hair had once grown.
Medusa was pregnant with the offspring of Poseidon when she met her
death at the hands of Perseus. From her decapitated body sprang the
winged horse, Pegasus and Chrysaor (whose name means &quot;He of the Golden
Sword&quot;). Pegasus plays a role in the Corinthian legends
of Bellerophon, and Chrysaor fathered a family of monsters.

Perseus Get a Wife the Hard Way

Most sources next took Perseus to the coastal land of Joppa, in modern
day Israel. There Cepheus ruled with his wife, Cassiopeia. Cassiopeia
had once bragged that her daughter, Andromeda, was more beautiful than
the NeREIDs. For her offense, Poseidon sent grave floods and a sea
monster to ravage the country. The oracle of Zeus revealed that the god
demanded a sacrifice before the torture would end. He demanded that
Andromeda, herself, be bound to a rock overlooking the sea, and left to
the dealt with by the horrible monster. Reluctantly, Cepheus complied,
and the girl was chained to the high rocks above the sea. This was when
Perseus, who was flying over, saw the maiden. He inquired of the king
of her situation and offered to save her in exchange for her hand in
marriage. Cepheus added a dowry of heirship to his kingdom.

Further Stories from Joppa

True to his word, Perseus saved Andromeda, killing the monster with the
scimitar of Hermes as it swam up to eat Andromeda. As he struggled with
the monster, Perseus set the head of Medusa down among some seaweed, and
it turned into coral. Andromeda's uncle, Phineas, who had previously
been engaged to Andromeda, tried to disrupt the wedding feast, but was
turned to stone by Perseus with the Gorgon's head. Perseus and Andromeda
had a son, Perses, whom Perseus left as heir to the throne when
he and Andromeda set out for Seriphos some time later.

North African Stories

Other myths, connected with Perseus's adventures are placed variously in
the chronology of his journey. At some point, he flew over Libya, where
some blood from Medusa's head dripped out of the kibisis. This gave rise
to poisonous snakes of various kinds that inhabit the lands. Also in
northern Africa, he encountered the second generation Titan, Atlas, who
had been forced by Zeus to hold the sky on his shoulders. This was a
punishment for his opposition to Zeus in the Titanomachy. Atlas begged
Perseus to put an end to his suffering, and use Medusa's head to turn
him to stone. Perseus complied, changing the god, Atlas, into the north
African Atlas mountain range. The story of Atlas's petrification,
however, does not agree with the stories of Perseus's grandson,
Heracles. He reputedly sought the god's help in performing one of his
labors - taking the burden of the sky while Atlas undertook the task.

Triumphant Return

Upon returning to Seriphos, Perseus found his mother and Dictys in
hiding, as Polydectes's reign of terror had worsened. At an assembly,
he produced the Gorgon's head, and turned the king to stone. Placing
Dictys on the throne, Perseus took his wife and mother and headed back
to Argos, hoping to at last meet Acrisius on friendly terms. It is at
this juncture in the story that most mythologians say Hermes retained
the objects which Perseus had taken on his quest, and Athena took the
head of Medusa to place on her aegis. However, various myths have
Perseus using the Gorgon's head later.

The Death of Acrisius

Perseus was disappointed to find that Acrisius was not in Argos upon his
return. For Proetus, the exiled brother of Acrisius, had grown powerful
at Tiryns, and finally came in force to chase his brother out of Argos.
Some say that Perseus used the head of Medusa to deal with Proetus,
although the story becomes somewhat diverse from this point. Perseus
followed Acrisius to Larisa, where he was in exile, hoping to make
amends with him. At a local javelin competition, Perseus was overly
ambitious, and his javelin flew into the crowd, where it killed the
elderly Acrisius. At last the prophecy had come true,
but under unexpected circumstances.

Perseus Gets a New Kingdom

Fearing his homeland, and needing to be purified for the death of his
grandfather, Perseus went to Tiryns, where Megapenthes, son of Proetus
was king. Perseus and Megapenthes made a deal whereby Megapenthes would
take Argos, and Perseus would take Tiryns. Apparently in this version of
the story, Argos had not fallen to Proetus. For a time, Perseus ruled
in Tiryns, also founding the city of Mycenae, whose reign fell to his
sons. Some sources maintain that Megapenthes later killed Perseus over
the petrification of Proetus. Although the chronology is questionable,
some sources state that Abas killed a man by the name of Megapenthes
to avenge Lynceus. Whether it be the son of Proetus, or some other
Megapenthes is not clear, as the details of the encounter
were never laid down by ancient sources.

The Great Seer, Melampus

It is at this point that the seer, Melampus, enters into the saga. But
before telling of his role, it is appropriate to discuss his earlier
life. Melampus, and his brother, Bias, were the sons of Amythaon, son
of Cretheus, and Idomene. Melampus received the gift of prophecy in
two ways. First, he earned it by respecting the bodies of a pair of
snakes killed by the servants of king Polyphontes, whom Melampus
served. He honorably burned the bodies, and raised their young. In
appreciation, the young snakes licked his ears while he was sleeping.
This enabled him to understand the chatter of animals, especially
birds. He was double blessed with foresight when he befriended the god,
Apollo, and endeared himself to Dionysus by spreading the god's worship.

An Indecent Proposal

Bias approached Melampus one day with a request. For Bias had fallen in
love with Pero, daughter of king Neleus of Pylos, and the king demanded
the cattle of Phylacus as a bride-price. Bias asked his brother to go
steal the cattle for him. Melampus reluctantly agreed to attempt the
task, knowing that he would be caught. The unsleeping hound that guarded
the cattle alerted the servants of Phylacus to Melampus's presence.
The king sentenced him to a year in prison, perhaps sympathizing
with Meleager for his brotherly courage.

Clairvoyance at Phylace

Sitting in his cell one evening, Melampus heard worms talking amongst
themselves, saying that the cell would soon collapse. For that they had
chewed the beam supporting his ceiling and tonight, it would be
completely severed. So the seer adamantly demanded that he be moved.
Humoring him, the guards relocated Melampus. Just as the worms had
said, the cell fell that night. Hearing of these events, Phylacus
released Melampus, offering the cattle if he could cure the king's son,
Iphiclus, of sterility. Melampus promptly slaughtered two bulls, and
listened to the chatter of the birds who came to eat the remains. He
learned from an old vulture the details of a disturbing incident in the
boy's past. When he was young, Iphiclus had seen Phylacus castrating
rams. Horrified, he had screamed, prompting Phylacus to approach him,
still wielding the bloody knife. Iphiclus, now terrified of his father,
had run from him. In pursuit, Phylacus had stuck the knife into a tree,
which had since grown around the knife handle. Melampus relocated the
knife, and mixed rust scrapings from its blade into the boy's drink for
ten days. This worked, and Iphiclus eventually fathered two sons,
Podarces and Protesilaus. True to his word, Phylacus gave the cattle
to Melampus. In turn, the seer gave them to his brother,
Bias, who used them to claim his bride.

The Daughters of Proteus

Meanwhile, the god, Dionysus, had come to spread his worship to Tiryns.
Either because they had offended Hera, or because they had refused the
worship of Dionysus, the daughters of Proetus were driven to madness.
Desperate for a cure, Proetus appealed to Melampus, but was reluctant to
pay his price of one third of the kingdom. However, when the madness
spread to more of the Argive women, the king accepted Melampus's request
for two-thirds of the kingdom. Melampus purified them in a rite which
mimicked the driving of cattle. Although one girl, Iphinoe, was killed
accidentally in the purification rite, the other two daughters of
Proetus were saved. Proetus gave them to Melampus and Bias (whose wife
Pero had disappeared), and the brothers took equal shares of the
kingdom. The subsequent history of Argos is dominated by their
descendants.

The First Generation

The rule of Argos and the surrounding areas again came into dispute
among the descendants of Melampus and Bias. For the son of Bias,
Talaus, was killed by Amphiarus, a descendant of Melampus, who claimed a
stronger right to the throne. Adrastus, the son of Talaus, then fled to
Sicyon, where he was protected by his father-in-law, Polybus. Adrastus
succeeded Polybus at Sicyon, but was reconciled to Amphiarus when his
sister, Eriphyle, married the seer. Adrastus eventually returned to
Argos and assumed the throne.

A Lion and a Bear

An oracle had once told Adrastus to marry his daughters to a lion and a
bear. He interpreted this to mean Tydeus and Polynices, and gave the
girls to them. For Tydeus had come to Argos as an exile from Calydon,
and Polynices had come as an exile from Thebes. When the two quarreled,
they began to fight, Tydeus in a bearskin, and Polynices in a lion
skin. Adrastus stopped the fight and made them his sons-in-law. It
was the expedition of the Seven Against Thebes that consumed the next
generation of noblemen, with only Adrastus surviving. Adrastus ruled
in Argos until the time of the attack of the Epigoni on Thebes,
after which he died in grief for his slain son, Aegialeus.

The Reign of Diomedes

Upon the death of Adrastus, Diomedes was given the throne of Argos. It
was he who led a great Argive contingent to Troy. It was the wound that
Diomedes inflicted on Aphrodite at Troy, and the encouragement of
Nauplius, that made Diomedes's wife Aegialia unfaithful. She chose as
her lover, Cometes, son of Sthenelus, and grandson of the warrior,
Capeneus. Diomedes left Argos, and the throne fell eventually to
Cometes's brother Cylarabes, who reunited the disjoined lands
of the Argolid under one king.

The Fate of Diomedes

Vergil recounted how Diomedes, finally settled in Italy, had refused to
take part in the war between the forces of Turnus, and the newly arrived
Aeneas, but the tale of his life in Italy has not been fully told.
Wandering through southern Italy, Diomedes founded a number of cities,
including Beneventum (originally called Maleventum), and the city of
Venusia, named in honor of the goddess of love. However, Aphrodite was
not appeased, and she turned Diomedes's followers into birds. When
Diomedes was buried on one of a chain of islands bearing his name, his
followers flew about his grave, giving protection to his resting place.
