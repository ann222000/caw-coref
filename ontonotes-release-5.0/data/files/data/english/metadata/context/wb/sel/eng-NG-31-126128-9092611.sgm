Would someone please explain the virtues of Justin Timberlake? They
escape me.

An 80-Year-Old Poet for the MTV Generation
By MELENA RYZIK

MtvU, the subsidiary of MTV Networks that is broadcast only on college
campuses, will announce today that it has selected its first poet
laureate. No, he doesn't rap. And it's not Bob Dylan, or even Justin
Timberlake.

It is John Ashbery, the prolific 80-year-old poet and frequent award
winner known for his dense, postmodern style and playful language. One
of the most celebrated living poets, Mr. Ashbery has won MacArthur
Foundation and Guggenheim fellowships and was awarded a Pulitzer Prize
in 1976 for his collection &quot;Self-Portrait in a Convex Mirror.&quot;

Excerpts of his poems will appear in 18 short promotional spots - like
commercials for verse - on the channel and its Web site (mtvu.com,
which will also feature the full text of the poems). In another first,
mtvU will help sponsor a poetry contest for college students. The
winner, chosen by the Pulitzer Prize-winning poet Yusef Komunyakaa,
will have a book published next year by HarperCollins as part of the
National Poetry Series.

&quot;We hope that we'll help discover the next great poet that we'll be
talking about for years to come,&quot; said Stephen K. Friedman, the
general manager of mtvU, which broadcasts at 750 campuses nationwide.

The idea of the laureate program was not to create more English
majors, but simply to whet an appetite, said Mr. Friedman, a poetry
aficionado since he majored in literature, philosophy and history at
Wesleyan. Mr. Ashbery, he added, was the No. 1 choice to inaugurate
the position. &quot;He resonates with college students that we've talked
with,&quot; he said.

And Mr. Ashbery, who was the poet laureate of New York State from 2001
to 2003, was immediately receptive. &quot;It seemed like it would be a
chance to broaden the audience for poetry,&quot; he said.

The poems used in the campaign span his career, and the spots are
simple: on a white background, black text floats in to a sound like a
crashing wave, appears on the screen for a minute, then floats away.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;From &quot;Retro&quot; (2005): &quot;It's really quite a thrill/When the moon rises
">

over the hill/and you've gotten over someone/salty and mercurial, the
only person you've ever loved.&quot; From &quot;Soonest Mended&quot; (2000): &quot;Barely
tolerated, living on the margin/In our technological society, we are
always having to be rescued.&quot;

The excerpts were chosen by David Kermani, Mr. Ashbery's business
manager, and two interns and an employee, all in their early 20s, in
his office.

&quot;We were just trying to pick lines that were catchy and sort of
meaningful in some way, something that would appeal to what we thought
younger people would be interested in,&quot; Mr. Kermani said. These young
people picked &quot;things that had sort of raunchy references,&quot; he added.
&quot;They thought it was sort of a hoot.&quot;

Mr. Ashbery too was pleased by their choices, particularly because
they reminded him of what was in his own canon. &quot;I have a lot poems,
so there are a lot of them that I don't really think of very much,&quot; he
said. (Mr. Ashbery published &quot;A Worldly Country: New Poems&quot; in
February, and an anthology, &quot;Notes From the Air: Selected Later
Poems,&quot; is due out in November.)

But will droves of young people respond?

&quot;It's our hope that we will interest college kids in poetry in a new
way, make it hip for them,&quot; said Daniel Halpern, the publisher of Ecco
Press, an imprint of HarperCollins that has published Mr. Ashbery's
work. But, Mr. Halpern admitted, &quot;it's very hard to tell what exactly
is going to come of all this.&quot;

Though his roots are in 1950s bohemia, Mr. Ashbery is perhaps not the
most obvious choice for the iPod generation. He works on a typewriter
and doesn't listen to popular music, with the exception of a chance
encounter with the Peaches &amp; Herb song &quot;Reunited&quot; in a cab in the
1980s; it inspired his poem &quot;The Songs We Know Best.&quot; (&quot;Just like a
shadow in an empty room/Like a breeze that's pointed from beyond the
tomb/Just like a project of which no one tells-/Or didja really think
that I was somebody else?&quot;)

But Mr. Friedman is optimistic that verse will find its new audience,
and mtvU plans to continue the program with other laureates after Mr.
Ashbery's one-year tenure is up.

&quot;I don't think there's such a big leap from the artists we're playing
to the poetry that John is creating,&quot; Mr. Friedman said. &quot;Some of the
music we play, Bright Eyes and the Decemberists, they're phenomenal
poets. I feel like there's a connection there.&quot;

Though he has not been offered the job, Mr. Ashbery has said that he
wouldn't necessarily be interested in being the United States poet
laureate.

&quot;There is a great deal of responsibility that comes with it,&quot; he said.
&quot;You have to spend part of the time in Washington. It's really a
public post.&quot;

But the mtvU gig - which is unpaid - came with few strings attached,
and was not very demanding of his time, he said.

&quot;I don't have any specific duties,&quot; he said. &quot;They're going to
publicize my poetry and maybe people will get interested in it and
other poets will benefit. That's about as much work or responsibility
as I would want.&quot;

After a 50-year career and nearly as many published volumes, is Mr.
Ashbery finally slacking off? He laughed. No, he said. &quot;I'd rather
keep the effort for writing poetry.&quot;

Agreed!

Here are two of her poems:

I Go Back to May 1937 (from The Gold Cell)

I see them standing at the formal gates of their colleges,
I see my father strolling out
under the ochre sandstone arch, the
red tiles glinting like bent
plates of blood behind his head, I
see my mother with a few light books at her hip
standing at the pillar made of tiny bricks with the
wrought-iron gate still open behind her, its
sword-tips black in the May air,
they are about to graduate, they are about to get married,
they are kids, they are dumb, all they know is they are
innocent, they would never hurt anybody.
I want to go up to them and say Stop,
don't do it--she's the wrong woman,
he's the wrong man, you are going to do things
you cannot imagine you would ever do,
you are going to do bad things to children,
you are going to suffer in ways you never heard of,
you are going to want to die. I want to go
up to them there in the late May sunlight and say it,
her hungry pretty blank face turning to me,
her pitiful beautiful untouched body,
his arrogant handsome blind face turning to me,
his pitiful beautiful untouched body,
but I don't do it. I want to live. I
take them up like the male and female
paper dolls and bang them together
at the hips like chips of flint as if to
strike sparks from them, I say
Do what you are going to do, and I will tell about it.

High School Senior (from The Wellspring)

For seventeen years, her breath in the house
at night, puff, puff, like summer
cumulus above her bed,
and her scalp smelling of apricots
--this being who had formed within me,
squatted like a bright tree-frog in the dark,
like an eohippus she had come out of history
slowly, through me, into the daylight,
I had the daily sight of her,
like food or air she was there, like a mother.
I say &quot;college,&quot; but I feel as if I cannot tell
the difference between her leaving for college
and our parting forever--I try to see
this house without her, without her pure
depth of feeling, without her creek-brown
hair, her daedal hands with their tapered
fingers, her pupils dark as the mourning cloak's
wing, but I can't. Seventeen years
ago, in this room, she moved inside me,
I looked at the river, I could not imagine
my life with her. I gazed across the street,
and saw, in the icy winter sun,
a column of steam rush up away from the earth.
There are creatures whose children float away
at birth, and those who throat-feed their young
for weeks and never see them again. My daughter
is free and she is in me--no, my love
of her is in me, moving in my heart,
changing chambers, like something poured
from hand to hand, to be weighed and then reweighed.
