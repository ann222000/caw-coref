One of the advantages of the Blackfriar's district was that it was a
liberty and not under the direction supervision or ready
surveillance/interference of city authorities. Not everyone who lived in this
fashionable district was inclined toward Catholicism but the French and I
believe Spanish Ambassadors had residences there which often served as havens
for English Catholics. Not every building in this district had notoriety
stemming from Catholic associations but this specific building did.

And that is why Ian Wilson in opposition to Rowse, Schoenbaum, and Wells:
If this was merely an investment property, why given all the proporties he
could have chosen within London, why did the Stratford man (keeping in mind the
pattern of evidence about his parents' Catholic biases) happen to pick this
particular building?

And as I have asked: Why in the name of God take steps to buy such a
notorious property when your supposed dramas are or have been just featured at
the first royal wedding in 70 years with strong Protestant connections...the
marriage alliance linking King James to the leader of the German Protestants?
This is all mind-boggling for the senior royal dramatist of the King's Men to
buy this property especially at that moment...perhaps explaining why John
Heminge (Hemmings?) bugged out on the trusteeship. On the other hand, a secret
Roman Catholic grain merchant with no literary aspirations and fame from South
Warwickshire might have done this with no contradiction.

Pete, why would a man hiding his Catholicism buy a house that everyone knew
only a Catholic would buy?

There was in fact no risk on the surface for the Strat man in this
purchase. As long as he was an outwardly conforming Church Papist when living
in his hometown in the Midlands and as long as he had the advantage of an
exemption obtained via living with Hugenots in London, he ran no risks if some
in London suspected that he was a secret Catholic. However, if the real Bard,
long connected to the court through the King's Men was living in 1613 and
bought such a property and also repeatedly failued to attend Anglican services
year after year, that man would have been in political trouble.

Because it was a whorehouse. When the Puritans got
sufficient clout they closed the theatres and the whorehouses
attached to the theatres. All the theatres were surrounded
by houses of prostitution, the Blackfriars was an &quot;inn&quot; and
the Puritans seized it from Susannah Hall.

It may have coincidently been a Jesuit hideout but it was
also the main source of the Stratford Panderer's &quot;thousand
pounds a year.&quot;

The bawdy houses, as I have shown (&quot;Base Trade:
Theatre As Prostitution, Lenz, ELH 60.4 (1993) 833-855)
was where the real money was made by theatre owners,
not from producing plays which wasn't that profitable:

In the mid-1580s Philip Henslowe established the place
of the stage on common ground with the brothel, and
demonstrated in the process that those who traded in
theatrical entertainment also traded in whores. (p. 834).

Parenthetically, I don't think there was the slightest

because communion was not a requirement of conformity
so it was obvious to everyone who was taking it
[Anglicans] and who wasn't [Catholics].

Henslowe didn't start out with a theatre and a bawdy
house, he made his way up by pawn brokering, buying
and selling costumes, brokering plays, money
lending, and working various schemes inside the theatres
including pimping. When he got enough cash he went
where the real money was and built whorehouses
literally next door to the theatres. He left an astronomical
£30,000 fortune in his will.

Of course the Stratford Panderer's career in London
was much briefer than Henslowes but he retired
&quot;rich&quot; to Stratford and that kind of money doesn't
accrue from selling plays. Since he wasn't a gentleman
and he could hustle for money like Henslowe,
he eventually got enough to buy shares in prostitution.

Add the Stratford Pimp's mysterious sources of
income to the fact that Susannah Hall's Blackfriar's
Inn was seized by Parliament and you have the source
of the family fortune.

The Stratford man and Prostitution. As Elizabeth says, with the help
of a scholarly quotation, it's quite possible that the man &quot;held
whores&quot; outside the theaters, and stayed in the trade, for he was a
shrewd man with a shilling, and, judging from his other transactions,
to be a whore-master would not have bothered him. The &quot;pimping Billy&quot;
suggestion rubs the Strats most backwardly, might be more truth than
friction to the text, and here it is again:
-----------------------------------------------

Here's something from John Mitchell's &quot;Who Wrote Shakespeare&quot; 1996.
It puts the doubts about Shakespeare's identity back to 1786. This
selection has to do with my idea that the Stratford man was &quot;holding
whores&quot; outside the theaters when he came to town, and he got rich
that way, rich enough to buy New Place in Stratford, a forgotten
whore-master turned at last to an honest trade, a high burgher of low
practice. But however this story might be interpreted, any competent
deduction would be that the identity of the great poet was in doubt.

MITCHELL, p. 61.

&quot;The Story of the Learned Pig&quot; (1786) by an unknown ‘Officer of the
Royal Navy' is a fantastic tale of a soul passing through a succession
of bodies, including Romulus, Brutus, a cat and a fly, and ending as a
performing pig in a London theatre. In the Elizabethan age it was
incarnated as a rascally Londoner, Pimping Billy, who looked after
horses for playgoers and was an agent for prostitutes. He made
friends with Shakespere who, it appeared, was exiled from Stratford,
not because he stole the local magistrate's deer but for being caught
in dalliance with his wife. The plays attributed to Shakespeare were
written by Pimping Billy himself. Shakspere merely posed as the
author; but when everyone from the queen downwards hailed him as a
dramatic genius, Billy was cut out of the profits and died in a fit of
jealous rage.&quot;

A fantastic tale to be sure, but in such a fantasy as this, or fable
you might call it, there are items of truth. How, for example, did
the man from Stratford and the poet Shakespeare find their way into a
story that features a pimp?

Here is why Shakespeare is the author of the works attributed to him:

His name on over forty title pages; his monument in Stratford,
which quite clearly states that he is a writer, and compares
his art to Virgil:

IVDICIO PYLIVM, GENIO SOCRATEM, ARTE MARONEM,
TERRA TEGIT, POPVLVS MAERET, OLYMPVS HABET.
(&quot;In judgement a Nestor, in wit a Socrates, in
art a Virgil; the earth buries him, the people
mourn him, Olympus possesses him&quot;)

STAY PASSENGER, WHY GOEST THOV BY SO FAST,
READ IF THOV GANST, WHOM ENVIOVS DEATH HATH PLAST
WITH IN THIS MONVMENT SHAKSPEARE: WITH WHOME,
QVICK NATVRE DIDE WHOSE NAME, DOTH DECK YS TOMBE,
FAR MORE, THEN COST: SIEH ALL, YT HE HATH WRITT,
LEAVES LIVING ART, BVT PAGE, TO SERVE HIS WITT.

(&quot;SIEH&quot; is a typo for &quot;Sith&quot;)

Robert Greene's attack on Shakespeare in Greene's Groatsworth
of Wit (1592), where he paraphrases a play by Shakespeare while
referring to &quot;Shake-scene&quot;, a clear pun on his name; the
Parnassus plays (1598-1601), where Shakespeare is mentioned by name
and Venus and Adonis and Romeo &amp; Juliet are parodied, and
where Shakespeare is said to have &quot;put them [university playwrights]
all down, aye, and Ben Jonson too&quot;; Gabriel Harvey (nlt 1603), who said
&quot;The younger sort takes much delight in Shakespeares Venus, &amp;
Adonis: but his Lucrece, &amp; his tragedie of Hamlet, Prince of
Denmarke, have it in them, to please the wiser sort,&quot; and who
called Shakespeare &quot;one of our florishing metricians;&quot; and
Francis Meres (1598), who said &quot;...so the English tongue is mightily
enriched, and gorgeously invested in rare ornaments and
resplendent abiliments by sir Philip Sidney, Spencer, Daniel,
Drayton, Warner, Shakespeare, Marlow and Chapman....&quot;
[notice that he distinguishes between Marlowe and Shakespeare
and mentions Oxenforde separately in another section as well]
and who also said that Shakespeare was one of England's
&quot;best Lyrick Poets&quot; and &quot;our best for tragedie&quot; and among the
&quot;best Poets for Comedy&quot; and &quot;the most passionate among us
to bewaile and bemoane the perplexities of Love;&quot; and
Francis Beaumont (1608), who said &quot;...here I would let slippe/
(If I had any in mee) schollershippe,/ And from all Learning keepe
these lines as cleere/ as Shakespeare's best are, which our
heires shall heare/ Preachers apte to their auditors to showe/
how farre sometimes a mortall man may goe/ by the dimme
light of Nature...;&quot;

In 1604 appeared Antony Scolloker's &quot;Diaphantus; or, the
Passions of Love.&quot; In his preface, telling us what an epistle
to the reader should be, Scolloker writes: &quot;It should be like
the Never-too-well read Arcadia, where the Prose and verce
(Matters and Words) are like his Mistresses eyes, one still
excelling another and without Co-rivall: or to come home to
the vulgars Element, like Friendly Shakespeare's Tragedies,
where the Commedian rides, when the Tragedian stands on
tip-toe: Faith it should please all, like Prince Hamlet.
It's difficult to see how Scolloker could refer to Shakespeare as
&quot;friendly&quot; unless he knew him personally.

&quot;a letter survives in the hand of Leonard Digges, who in 1613
compared the sonnets of Lope de Vega to those of &quot;our Will Shakespeare&quot;
- notice the use of the familiar &quot;Will&quot; by a close neighbor of Shakespeare's
in both Aldermarston and in London....Leonard Digges was the step-son
(from 1603) of Thomas Russell, a man who was not only a neighbor of
Shakespeare's both in London and in Stratford, but whom Shakespeare
remembered in his will, and indeed appointed one of the two overseers of
his will.&quot;

In addition:

That Jonson was acquainted with Shakespeare
personally is indisputable: Shakespeare's name
appears on the list of players who acted in
&quot;Every Man in His Humour&quot;, and Jonson's
extended comments upon Shakespeare in his
&quot;Timber&quot; (see below) are proof of that: he
says that Shakespeare was &quot;(indeed) honest,
and of an open, and free nature:&quot; and that
he &quot;loved the man&quot;. Jonson, moreover, was
familiar with many of the nobility and gentleman
of his time due to his close associations with
the court of King James, and would certainly
have heard any rumours involving the Earl
of Oxenforde if there had been any related
to playwrighting.
Jonson's comments on his contemporaries were
typically a mix of praise and censure. Here
are some examples from &quot;Conversations with
William Drummond&quot;:

&quot;Samuel Daniel was a good honest man, had no
children: but no poet.&quot;

&quot;That Michael Drayton's Poly-Olbion (if he had
performed what he promised to write, the deeds
of all the worthies) had been excellent: his
long verses pleased him not.&quot;

&quot;He esteemeth John Donne the first poet in the
world, in some things: his verses of the lost
chain he hath by heart; and that passage of
'The Calm', that dust and feathers do not stir,
all was so quiet. Affirmeth Donne to have written
all his best pieces ere he was twenty-five
years old.&quot;

And many more. His comment on Shakespeare in
these conversations is quite typical:

&quot;Shakespeare, in a play, brought in a number of men
saying they had suffered shipwreck in Bohemia, where there
is no sea near by some 100 miles.&quot;

In &quot;Timber: or Discoveries&quot;, Jonson again mixes
criticism with praise:

&quot;De Shakespeare Nostrat

I remember, the players have often
mentioned it as an honour to Shakespeare, that
in his writing (whatsoever he penned) he never
blotted out line. My answer hath been, would
he had blotted a thousand. Which they thought
a malevolent speech. I had not told posterity
this, but for their ignorance, who choose that
circumstance to commend their friend by,
wherein he most faulted. And to justify mine
own candour (for I loved the man, and do honour
his memory - on this side idolatry - as
much as any). He was (indeed) honest, and of
an open, and free nature: had an excellent
fancy; brave notions, and gentle expressions:
wherein he flowed with that facility, that
sometime it was necessary he should be
stopped: sufflaminandus erat; as Augustus said
of Haterius. His wit was in his own power;
would the rule of it had been so too. Many
times he fell into those things, could not escape
laughter: as when he said in the person of
Caesar, one speaking to him; &quot;Caesar, thou
dost me wrong'. He replied: 'Caesar did never
wrong, but with just cause': and such like;
which were ridiculous. But he redeemed his
vices, with his virtues. There was ever more in
him to be praised, than to be pardoned.&quot;

Jonson clearly doesn't feel that the portrait
in the Folio does Shakespeare any justice
as far as portraying his wit, as his little poem
shows:

&quot;This Figure, that thou here seest put,
It was for gentle Shakespeare cut,
Wherein the Graver had a strife
with Nature, to out-doo the life :
O, could he but have drawne his wit
As well in brasse, as he hath hit
His face ; the Print would then surpasse
All, that was ever writ in brasse.
But, since he cannot, Reader, looke
Not on his Picture, but his Booke.&quot;

And finally, Jonson's masterful eulogy
for Shakespeare, where he seems to be
quite convinced that the man who acted in
his plays was a better playwright than
Marlowe, and worthy of Euripides and
Sophocles. Notice that he calls Shakespeare
the &quot;sweet swan of Avon&quot;, not the &quot;tempestuous
tin-miner of tuxbury&quot; or some such:

&quot;TO THE MEMORY OF MY BELOVED THE AUTHOR,
MR. WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE, AND WHAT HE
HATH LEFT US.

To draw no envy, Shakespeare, on thy name,
Am I thus ample to thy book and fame;
While I confess thy writings to be such
As neither man nor muse can praise too much;
'Tis true, and all men's suffrage. But these ways
Were not the paths I meant unto thy praise;
For seeliest ignorance on these may light,
Which, when it sounds at best, but echoes right;
Or blind affection, which doth ne'er advance
The truth, but gropes, and urgeth all by chance;
Or crafty malice might pretend this praise,
And think to ruin, where it seem'd to raise.
These are, as some infamous bawd or whore
Should praise a matron; what could hurt her more?
But thou art proof against them, and indeed,
Above th' ill fortune of them, or the need.
I therefore will begin. Soul of the age!
The applause, delight, the wonder of our stage!
My Shakespeare, rise! I will not lodge thee by
Chaucer, or Spenser, or bid Beaumont lie
A little further, to make thee a room:
Thou art a monument without a tomb,
And art alive still while thy book doth live
And we have wits to read and praise to give.
That I not mix thee so, my brain excuses,
I mean with great, but disproportion'd Muses,
For if I thought my judgment were of years,
I should commit thee surely with thy peers,
And tell how far thou didst our Lyly outshine,
Or sporting Kyd, or Marlowe's mighty line.
And though thou hadst small Latin and less Greek,
From thence to honour thee, I would not seek
For names; but call forth thund'ring Aeschylus,
Euripides and Sophocles to us;
Pacuvius, Accius, him of Cordova dead,
To life again, to hear thy buskin tread,
And shake a stage; or, when thy socks were on,
Leave thee alone for the comparison
Of all that insolent Greece or haughty Rome
Sent forth, or since did from their ashes come.
Triumph, my Britain, thou hast one to show
To whom all scenes of Europe homage owe.
He was not of an age but for all time!
And all the Muses still were in their prime,
When, like Apollo, he came forth to warm
Our ears, or like a Mercury to charm!
Nature herself was proud of his designs
And joy'd to wear the dressing of his lines,
Which were so richly spun, and woven so fit,
As, since, she will vouchsafe no other wit.
The merry Greek, tart Aristophanes,
Neat Terence, witty Plautus, now not please,
But antiquated and deserted lie,
As they were not of Nature's family.
Yet must I not give Nature all: thy art,
My gentle Shakespeare, must enjoy a part.
For though the poet's matter nature be,
His art doth give the fashion; and, that he
Who casts to write a living line, must sweat,
(Such as thine are) and strike the second heat
Upon the Muses' anvil; turn the same ...

A more likely scenario was that he was dodging the draft. It
occurred to me that Willy, a Catholic, could not fight on the
side of the English during the Spanish invasion. The Anglo-Spanish
war was going to be primarily a land war. The plan was to
destroy the miniscule British navy and sail up the Thames
to Tilbury where the only really loyal earl--Leicester--was
waiting with an untrained army. Philip had 44,000 Spanish
troops--the Red Ants--on his galleasses.

Willy was under the papal anathema of
Regnans in Excelsis, Pius V's papal bull that would sent
English Catholics to Hell if they defended the heretical queen
against Spain. This is the reason Oxford ran from his post.
Oxford wasn't a coward in a battle. He was afraid of the Pope.
Practically it amounted to the same thing, however. It
cost him the Garter and a place at Court.

Sir Thomas Lucy was a Puritan who had arbitrary authority
to conscript for petty crimes like poaching so Poaching Willy
had to run to keep from getting drafted into an army defending
Elizabeth. Willy had no cash so once in London he scrambled
to make a living the only way he was taught--by trade. (All the
Stratford sibs were engaged in one trade or another according
to Fripps). Trading in old plays, pawn brokage, money lending
when he accumulated cash and rough trade, pandering.

The record shows that nothing much changed when Willy
returned to Stratford. He was born to the trades, was a trader
in London and returned to Stratford to be a trader.

I can make a circumstantial case for the draft-dodging
although I'm sympathetic to young William because
Sir Thomas Lucy was such an viscious Puritan inquisitor
that his personal persecution of Catholics was known across
England. Lucy's crimes against Catholics are immortalized
by the Bacon in the Shakespeare plays. Bacon kept his
Catholic friends for life because his tolerance was
centuries ahead of its time.

I agree. I didn't see the connection between prostitution
and the theatres until I found Lenz' article. You might
want to look it up.

&gt;&gt;&gt; One of the advantages of the Blackfriar's district was that it was a
&gt;&gt;&gt; liberty and not under the direction supervision or ready
&gt;&gt;&gt; surveillance/interference of city authorities.
&gt;&gt; [ . . .]

&gt;&gt;&gt; And as I have asked: Why in the name of God take steps to buy such a
&gt;&gt;&gt; notorious property

&gt;&gt; Because it was a whorehouse. When the Puritans got
&gt;&gt; sufficient clout they closed the theatres and the whorehouses
&gt;&gt; attached to the theatres. All the theatres were surrounded
&gt;&gt; by houses of prostitution, the Blackfriars was an &quot;inn&quot; and
&gt;&gt; the Puritans seized it from Susannah Hall.

&gt;&gt; It may have coincidently been a Jesuit hideout but it was
&gt;&gt; also the main source of the Stratford Panderer's &quot;thousand
&gt;&gt; pounds a year.&quot;

&gt;&gt; The bawdy houses, as I have shown (&quot;Base Trade:
&gt;&gt; Theatre As Prostitution, Lenz, ELH 60.4 (1993) 833-855)
&gt;&gt; was where the real money was made by theatre owners,
&gt;&gt; not from producing plays which wasn't that profitable:

&gt;&gt; In the mid-1580s Philip Henslowe established the place
&gt;&gt; of the stage on common ground with the brothel, and
&gt;&gt; demonstrated in the process that those who traded in
&gt;&gt; theatrical entertainment also traded in whores. (p. 834).

&gt;&gt; [ . . .]

&gt;&gt;&gt; This is all mind-boggling for the senior royal dramatist of the King's Men to
&gt;&gt;&gt; buy this property especially at that moment...perhaps explaining why John
&gt;&gt;&gt; Heminge (Hemmings?) bugged out on the trusteeship. On the other hand, a secret
&gt;&gt;&gt; Roman Catholic grain merchant with no literary aspirations and fame from South
&gt;&gt;&gt; Warwickshire might have done this with no contradiction.

&gt;&gt; Parenthetically, I don't think there was the slightest
&gt;&gt; secret about the Stratford Panderer's Catholicism
&gt;&gt; because communion was not a requirement of conformity
&gt;&gt; so it was obvious to everyone who was taking it
&gt;&gt; [Anglicans] and who wasn't [Catholics].

&gt;&gt; Henslowe didn't start out with a theatre and a bawdy
&gt;&gt; house, he made his way up by pawn brokering, buying
&gt;&gt; and selling costumes, brokering plays, money
&gt;&gt; lending, and working various schemes inside the theatres
&gt;&gt; including pimping. When he got enough cash he went
&gt;&gt; where the real money was and built whorehouses
&gt;&gt; literally next door to the theatres. He left an astronomical
&gt;&gt; £30,000 fortune in his will.

&gt;&gt; Of course the Stratford Panderer's career in London
&gt;&gt; was much briefer than Henslowes but he retired
&gt;&gt;&quot;rich&quot; to Stratford and that kind of money doesn't
&gt;&gt; accrue from selling plays. Since he wasn't a gentleman
&gt;&gt; and he could hustle for money like Henslowe,
&gt;&gt; he eventually got enough to buy shares in prostitution.

&gt;&gt; Add the Stratford Pimp's mysterious sources of
&gt;&gt; income to the fact that Susannah Hall's Blackfriar's
&gt;&gt; Inn was seized by Parliament and you have the source
&gt;&gt; of the family fortune.

&gt; Here is why Shakespeare is the author of the works attributed to him:

&gt; His name on over forty title pages; his monument in Stratford,
&gt; which quite clearly states that he is a writer, and compares
&gt; his art to Virgil:

&gt; IVDICIO PYLIVM, GENIO SOCRATEM, ARTE MARONEM,
&gt; TERRA TEGIT, POPVLVS MAERET, OLYMPVS HABET.
&gt; (&quot;In judgement a Nestor, in wit a Socrates, in

&gt; FAR MORE, THEN COST: SIEH ALL, YT HE HATH WRITT,
&gt; LEAVES LIVING ART, BVT PAGE, TO SERVE HIS WITT.

&gt; (&quot;SIEH&quot; is a typo for &quot;Sith&quot;)

&gt; Robert Greene's attack on Shakespeare in Greene's Groatsworth
&gt; of Wit (1592), where he paraphrases a play by Shakespeare while
&gt; referring to &quot;Shake-scene&quot;, a clear pun on his name; the
&gt; Parnassus plays (1598-1601), where Shakespeare is mentioned by name
&gt; and Venus and Adonis and Romeo &amp; Juliet are parodied, and
&gt; where Shakespeare is said to have &quot;put them [university playwrights]
&gt; all down, aye, and Ben Jonson too&quot;; Gabriel Harvey (nlt 1603), who said
&gt;&quot;The younger sort takes much delight in Shakespeares Venus, &amp;
&gt; Adonis: but his Lucrece, &amp; his tragedie of Hamlet, Prince of
&gt; Denmarke, have it in them, to please the wiser sort,&quot; and who
&gt; called Shakespeare &quot;one of our florishing metricians;&quot; and
&gt; Francis Meres (1598), who said &quot;...so the English tongue is mightily
&gt; enriched, and gorgeously invested in rare ornaments and
&gt; resplendent abiliments by sir Philip Sidney, Spencer, Daniel,
&gt; Drayton, Warner, Shakespeare, Marlow and Chapman....&quot;
&gt; [notice that he distinguishes between Marlowe and Shakespeare
&gt; and mentions Oxenforde separately in another section as well]
&gt; and who also said that Shakespeare was one of England's
&gt;&quot;best Lyrick Poets&quot; and &quot;our best for tragedie&quot; and among the
&gt;&quot;best Poets for Comedy&quot; and &quot;the most passionate among us
&gt; to bewaile and bemoane the perplexities of Love;&quot; and
&gt; Francis Beaumont (1608), who said &quot;...here I would let slippe/
&gt; (If I had any in mee) schollershippe,/ And from all Learning keepe
&gt; these lines as cleere/ as Shakespeare's best are, which our
&gt; heires shall heare/ Preachers apte to their auditors to showe/
&gt; how farre sometimes a mortall man may goe/ by the dimme
&gt; light of Nature...;&quot;

&gt; In 1604 appeared Antony Scolloker's &quot;Diaphantus; or, the
&gt; Passions of Love.&quot; In his preface, telling us what an epistle
&gt; to the reader should be, Scolloker writes: &quot;It should be like
&gt; the Never-too-well read Arcadia, where the Prose and verce
&gt; (Matters and Words) are like his Mistresses eyes, one still
&gt; excelling another and without Co-rivall: or to come home to
&gt; the vulgars Element, like Friendly Shakespeare's Tragedies,
&gt; where the Commedian rides, when the Tragedian stands on
&gt; tip-toe: Faith it should please all, like Prince Hamlet.
&gt; It's difficult to see how Scolloker could refer to Shakespeare as
&gt;&quot;friendly&quot; unless he knew him personally.

&gt; http://socrates.berkeley.edu/~ahnelson/price.html:
&gt;&quot;a letter survives in the hand of Leonard Digges, who in 1613
&gt; compared the sonnets of Lope de Vega to those of &quot;our Will Shakespeare&quot;
&gt; - notice the use of the familiar &quot;Will&quot; by a close neighbor of Shakespeare's
&gt; in both Aldermarston and in London....Leonard Digges was the step-son
&gt; (from 1603) of Thomas Russell, a man who was not only a neighbor of
&gt; Shakespeare's both in London and in Stratford, but whom Shakespeare
&gt; remembered in his will, and indeed appointed one of the two overseers of
&gt; his will.&quot;

&gt; In addition:

&gt; That Jonson was acquainted with Shakespeare
&gt; personally is indisputable: Shakespeare's name
&gt; appears on the list of players who acted in
&gt;&quot;Every Man in His Humour&quot;, and Jonson's
&gt; extended comments upon Shakespeare in his
&gt;&quot;Timber&quot; (see below) are proof of that: he
&gt; says that Shakespeare was &quot;(indeed) honest,
&gt; and of an open, and free nature:&quot; and that
&gt; he &quot;loved the man&quot;. Jonson, moreover, was
&gt; familiar with many of the nobility and gentleman
&gt; of his time due to his close associations with
&gt; the court of King James, and would certainly
&gt; have heard any rumours involving the Earl
&gt; of Oxenforde if there had been any related
&gt; to playwrighting.
&gt; Jonson's comments on his contemporaries were
&gt; typically a mix of praise and censure. Here
&gt; are some examples from &quot;Conversations with
&gt; William Drummond&quot;:

&gt;&quot;Samuel Daniel was a good honest man, had no
&gt; children: but no poet.&quot;

&gt;&quot;That Michael Drayton's Poly-Olbion (if he had
&gt; performed what he promised to write, the deeds
&gt; of all the worthies) had been excellent: his
&gt; long verses pleased him not.&quot;

&gt;&quot;He esteemeth John Donne the first poet in the
&gt; world, in some things: his verses of the lost
&gt; chain he hath by heart; and that passage of
&gt; 'The Calm', that dust and feathers do not stir,
&gt; all was so quiet. Affirmeth Donne to have written
&gt; all his best pieces ere he was twenty-five
&gt; years old.&quot;

&gt; And many more. His comment on Shakespeare in
&gt; these conversations is quite typical:

&gt;&quot;Shakespeare, in a play, brought in a number of men
&gt; saying they had suffered shipwreck in Bohemia, where there
&gt; is no sea near by some 100 miles.&quot;

&gt; In &quot;Timber: or Discoveries&quot;, Jonson again mixes
&gt; criticism with praise:

&gt;&quot;De Shakespeare Nostrat

&gt; I remember, the players have often
&gt; mentioned it as an honour to Shakespeare, that
&gt; in his writing (whatsoever he penned) he never
&gt; blotted out line. My answer hath been, would
&gt; he had blotted a thousand. Which they thought
&gt; a malevolent speech. I had not told posterity
&gt; this, but for their ignorance, who choose that
&gt; circumstance to commend their friend by,
&gt; wherein he most faulted. And to justify mine
&gt; own candour (for I loved the man, and do honour
&gt; his memory - on this side idolatry - as
&gt; much as any). He was (indeed) honest, and of
&gt; an open, and free nature: had an excellent
&gt; fancy; brave notions, and gentle expressions:
&gt; wherein he flowed with that facility, that
&gt; sometime it was necessary he should be
&gt; stopped: sufflaminandus erat; as Augustus said
&gt; of Haterius. His wit was in his own power;
&gt; would the rule of it had been so too. Many
&gt; times he fell into those things, could not escape
&gt; laughter: as when he said in the person of
&gt; Caesar, one speaking to him; &quot;Caesar, thou
&gt; dost me wrong'. He replied: 'Caesar did never
&gt; wrong, but with just cause': and such like;
&gt; which were ridiculous. But he redeemed his
&gt; vices, with his virtues. There was ever more in
&gt; him to be praised, than to be pardoned.&quot;

&gt; Jonson clearly doesn't feel that the portrait
&gt; in the Folio does Shakespeare any justice
&gt; as far as portraying his wit, as his little poem
&gt; shows:

&gt;&quot;This Figure, that thou here seest put,
&gt; It was for gentle Shakespeare cut,
&gt; Wherein the Graver had a strife
&gt; with Nature, to out-doo the life :
&gt; O, could he but have drawne his wit
&gt; As well in brasse, as he hath hit
&gt; His face ; the Print would then surpasse
&gt; All, that was ever writ in brasse.
&gt; But, since he cannot, Reader, looke
&gt; Not on his Picture, but his Booke.&quot;

&gt; And finally, Jonson's masterful eulogy
&gt; for Shakespeare, where he seems to be
&gt; quite convinced that the man who acted in
&gt; his plays was a better playwright than
&gt; Marlowe, and worthy of Euripides and
&gt; Sophocles. Notice that he calls Shakespeare
&gt; the &quot;sweet swan of Avon&quot;, not the &quot;tempestuous
&gt; tin-miner of tuxbury&quot; or some such:

&gt;&quot;TO THE MEMORY OF MY BELOVED THE AUTHOR,
&gt; MR. WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE, AND WHAT HE
&gt; HATH LEFT US.

&gt; To draw no envy, Shakespeare, on thy name,
&gt; Am I thus ample to thy book and fame;
&gt; While I confess thy writings to be such
&gt; As neither man nor muse can praise too much;
&gt; 'Tis true, and all men's suffrage. But these ways
&gt; Were not the paths I meant unto thy praise;
&gt; For seeliest ignorance on these may light,
&gt; Which, when it sounds at best, but echoes right;
&gt; Or blind affection, which doth ne'er advance
&gt; The truth, but gropes, and urgeth all by chance;
&gt; Or crafty malice might pretend this praise,
&gt; And think to ruin, where it seem'd to raise.
&gt; These are, as some infamous bawd or whore
&gt; Should praise a matron; what could hurt her more?
&gt; But thou art proof against them, and indeed,
&gt; Above th' ill fortune of them, or the need.
&gt; I therefore will begin. Soul of the age!
&gt; The applause, delight, the wonder of our stage!
&gt; My Shakespeare, rise! I will not lodge thee by
&gt; Chaucer, or Spenser, or bid Beaumont lie
&gt; A little further, to make thee a room:
&gt; Thou art a monument without a tomb,
&gt; And art alive still while thy book doth live
&gt; And we have wits to read and praise to give.
&gt; That I not mix thee so, my brain excuses,
&gt; I mean with great, but disproportion'd Muses,
&gt; For if I thought my judgment were of years,
&gt; I should commit thee surely with thy peers,
&gt; And tell how far thou didst our Lyly outshine,
&gt; Or sporting Kyd, or Marlowe's mighty line.
&gt; And though thou hadst small Latin and less Greek,
&gt; From thence to honour thee, I would not seek
&gt; For names; but call forth thund'ring Aeschylus,
&gt; Euripides and Sophocles to us;
&gt; Pacuvius, Accius, him of Cordova dead,
&gt; To life again, to hear thy buskin tread,
&gt; And shake a stage; or, when thy socks were on,
&gt; Leave thee alone for the comparison
&gt; Of all that insolent Greece or haughty Rome
&gt; Sent forth, or since did from their ashes come.
&gt; Triumph, my Britain, thou hast one to show
&gt; To whom all scenes of Europe homage owe.
&gt; He was not of an age but for all time!
&gt; And all the Muses still were in their prime,
&gt; When, like Apollo, he came forth to warm
&gt; Our ears, or like a Mercury to charm!

This overstates what a liberty was. Shorter Oxford: &quot;a district within
the limits of a county, but exempt from the jurisdiction of the
sheriff, and having a separate commission of the peace&quot;. There was
somebody with authority there, but he might be a long way away (like
Winchester) and mainly preoccupied with other things. It was
convenient for a debtor to move to such a jurisdiction, where a
warrant issued by the (geographically) nearest Justice could not be
executed.

It might well make it harder to collect fines for not going to church
on a Sunday. That was an offence, though not a major one, but it was
not limited to Catholics. There was no offence of 'being a Catholic'
and nobody could be charged with it.

After the excommunication of 1570, though, Catholics were in special
danger of being charged with high treason, which was an offence and a
half. It is simply not believable that local divisions of jurisdiction
were any serious obstacle to prosecuting that.

&gt; This overstates what a liberty was. Shorter Oxford: &quot;a district within
&gt; the limits of a county, but exempt from the jurisdiction of the
&gt; sheriff, and having a separate commission of the peace&quot;. There was
&gt; somebody with authority there, but he might be a long way away (like
&gt; Winchester) and mainly preoccupied with other things. It was
&gt; convenient for a debtor to move to such a jurisdiction, where a
&gt; warrant issued by the (geographically) nearest Justice could not be
&gt; executed.

&gt; It might well make it harder to collect fines for not going to church
&gt; on a Sunday. That was an offence, though not a major one, but it was
&gt; not limited to Catholics. There was no offence of 'being a Catholic'
&gt; and nobody could be charged with it.

&gt; After the excommunication of 1570, though, Catholics were in special
&gt; danger of being charged with high treason, which was an offence and a
&gt; half. It is simply not believable that local divisions of jurisdiction
&gt; were any serious obstacle to prosecuting that.

Yes. Even an ambassador's residence could be raided on occasion, as
was the Portuguese ambassador's by William Fleetwood, Recorder of
London. So I can't really see that after the Gunpowder Plot there
could be any building within the city walls which Catholics could
simply use with brazen impunity.

It is clear though that because the old conventual buildings were so
extensive and contained so many large rooms and 'void grounds', that
as well as providing 'mansions' for the rich they became used for
shops and businesses, including fence schools, dancing schools, a
tennis court (kitchen yard), a theatre (the frater) and even a bowling
alley (the cloisters). Apparently a fair amount of infill building
also took place in the sixty years between the Dissolution and
Shakespeare's purchase. So it would be a tricky area to raid.

Also some of the business residents seem to be of foreign origin,
judging by the names - Bonetti, Hosier, Gobert, Borangea - so a fair
amount of non-Anglican worship may well have been practised, not all
of it Catholic.

There was a dispute (1556) about the status of the church on site, St
Anne's, which some residents claimed was a parish church but others
said wasn't. This book doesn't say when/if/how it was resolved.
Confusion over whether you were or weren't in a particular parish
might be useful to non-conformists.

An inquiry to help settle a lawsuit about the ownership of a
particular house was heard by the Lord Mayor and Aldermen sitting at
the Guildhall, so they clearly had some involvement at Blackfriars.

Shakespeare must have been familiar with Blackfriars from early on,
since Lord Hunsdon had houses there, Vautrollier/Field's shop was in
the old Square Tower and the Burbages had extensive property
investment there.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; So my idea is superceded by Mitchell. I've never read Mitchell
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (although I think it's a possibility that John Bede is Mitchell).
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Pimping Billy. Now we have the label I've been struggling to find.

&gt;&gt;&gt; That was MY suggestion quite a while back, when Bede first showed up.
&gt;&gt;&gt; It's &quot;Michell,&quot; by the way.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Anyway, I agree that the similarity of &quot;horse&quot; to &quot;whore&quot; in an
&gt;&gt;&gt; anecdote is very persuasive evidence that Shakespeare had SOMEthing to
&gt;&gt;&gt; do with prostitution, and is certainly stronger than forty title-pages
&gt;&gt;&gt; with his name in them and his picture accompanying one that he had
&gt;&gt;&gt; anything to do with the stage.

&gt;&gt; Anybody can sell his surname.

&gt; Hey, the wack doesn't know that he just admitted that the man from
&gt; Stratford's surname was spelled &quot;Shakespeare!&quot;

That's pretty exciting, Bob. And please don't call me a &quot;he.&quot;

I closely cited the arcticle by Joseph Lenz, author of
Base Trade: The Theatre as Prostitution.

Lenz, not I, established that Alleyn and Henslowe
retired filthy rich from the profits from bawdy houses.

The theatres were constructed to draw the &quot;rough trade&quot;
to the bawdy houses from the point of the investors.

I didn't know at the time I posted on Lenz that Susanna Hall's
bawdy house was seized by the Puritan Parliament.

That fact alone proves that Pimping Willy was not
getting his wealth from his theatre shares.

Yes, and there may have been religious animosities at work too. Sir
Thomas was granted part of the conventual buildings under Edward VI,
and apparently pulled down the roof of St Anne's church. In Mary's
time when he was in disgrace the residents petitioned for restoration,
but he said St Anne's had never been a *parish* church, and if they
wanted one they could club together and pay for it themselves.
Evidently they reached some sort of compromise.

I have to admit I don't understand if the Lord Mayor was hearing the
case formally and had power to decide it, or was helping out. The
claimants seem to have agreed to put their case to the arbitration of
Anthony, Viscount Montague and John Apsley. The Lord Mayor and
Aldermen were listening to the testimony of examinants who had come
forward freely to tell what they knew of the disputed house's history.
(The house is repeatedly identified by reference to a window in it
painted with 'chalices and singing cakes': I was utterly bemused by
these cakes, which turn out to have been communion wafers.)

Looking at the old records is fascinating, but as usual I'm left
feeling I need to be better instructed in the historical context.

Lenz didn't do anything like that and in fact,
