Hello, all.

I've got a footage with an Alpha Channel in PAL 4:3, 25 fps in QT
format . Is there any way I can convert it into NTSC 16:9, 29.97 fps
and keep the Alpha Channel? The problem is that when I import it into
my FCP sequence, it &quot;flickers&quot;/skips even after I render it. I realize
the problem is the different number of frames, however I don't know
how to correct it technically. Any advice is greately appreciated.

Thanks,

Dmitriy

Hi, Dimitri.
I just did a small test with some alfa Pal footage I have here and it worked for me, I hope it works for you too.
Import the PAL footage in a PAL sequence, Go FILE----EXPORT----QUICKTIME MOVIE-----from the pop up CURRENT SETTINGS window specify DV NTSC 48Khz-ANAMORPHIC-----SAVE,  FCP will prompt you whether you want to TRASCODE the footage, say YES and HOPE it works.
Let me know what happen.

I used the Nattress Standards Conversion Plug-in for FCP. It works
well, it's cheap, but I've never tried it with a quicktime with alpha.
Check it out:

Hi, Dimitry
I am sorry, I forgot one small thing.
You are going to stretch the horizontal aspect ratio when converting  3:4 footage to 16:9 anamorphic.
Unless you want to letter box it.

Hi, Kamen.
I tried to do what you suggested. I followed all the steps and the
file was converted successfully, but the alpha channel was gone:( Can
you tell me the sequence settings you have for PAL, what type of
compression you choose in your sequence settings? Every time I tried
your steps, I lost the Alpha Channel.

But I found the easier way to convert from PAL to NTSC and to keep an
Alpha Chanel. You just open you PAL Alpha footage in QT then FILE --&gt;
EXPORT. From the pop up Export window specify  &quot;Movie to Quick Time
Movie&quot; then press OPTIONS button: specify such settings: compression
type TIFF, frame rate 29.97, depth MILLIONS OF COLORS+, in SIZE
dementions field - type the dimentions you need ( i n my case it is
CUSTOM: 853x480) and press SAVE. It did work for me! Try it! I'll be
glad to hear your opinion.

Thanks once again:)

Have a good weekend!

Dmitriy
