David Kathman and the &quot;Historical Record&quot;
A Reply to David Kathman's Selective Critique
Copyright Â© 2000 by The Vere Company
by Joseph Sobran

&lt;&lt;David Kathman, editor of a website on the Shakespeare authorship
question, offers many criticisms of those who deny that William of
Stratford was the Bard, reserving special scorn for those of us who
think the real Bard was Edward de Vere, Earl of Oxford. He calls me a
&quot;non-scholar,&quot; in contrast to the genuine &quot;scholars&quot; who hold the
traditional view.

Some of Kathman's specific criticisms of Oxfordians (including me) are
warranted. He is an able and well-informed advocate for William and he
is skillful at catching his opponents' factual errors and
overstatements.

Unfortunately, Kathman himself writes not like a scholar, but like a
lawyer; his goal is not truth, but victory. Far from writing with
impartial detachment, he spares his own &quot;side&quot; the scathing criticisms
he inflicts on Oxfordians. He treats the Oxfordian Charlton Ogburn as a
fool, but overlooks the egregious vulnerabilities of the eccentric
Stratfordian Alan Nelson, since Nelson is on his &quot;side.&quot; Kathman seems
to feel that the Stratfordian &quot;side&quot; can't afford to make the slightest
concession to the heretics. He won't allow that any Oxfordian has ever
raised a legitimate objection or found a real weakness in Stratfordian
scholarship.

Though Oxfordians obviously reject the authority of academic
Shakespeare scholars, Kathman constantly appeals to the shared opinions
of those scholars as if this could decide the authorship controversy: he
assures us that &quot;the majority of Shakespeare scholars today doubt&quot; one
proposition, another is &quot;not very widely accepted today among
Shakespeare scholars,&quot; a third is &quot;shared by essentially all Shakespeare
scholars you could ask,&quot;&quot;most scholars today believe&quot; yet another, &quot;the
majority of Shakespeare scholars today doubt&quot; a fifth, and so on.

Kathman is intelligent enough to realize that citing Stratfordian
scholars to prove the Stratfordian position is circular reasoning, but
he is eager to show that the traditional view is held by all the Best
People. Being more partisan than scholar, he seeks a polemical victory
in discrediting those he considers his opponents. Never does he give an
Oxfordian credit for making a sound point; never does he criticize a
fellow Stratfordian for fatuity. He maintains a loyal silence even when
Nelson, trying to explain why the poet of the Sonnets seems much older
than the youth, absurdly surmises that William &quot;felt old&quot; because he was
&quot;prematurely balding.&quot;

But Kathman reveals an even more serious flaw. Consider his positive
case for William's authorship, in his own words:

How do we know that Shakespeare wrote Shakespeare? We know because the
historical record tells us so, strongly and unequivocally.... The most
obvious evidence that William Shakespeare wrote the works attributed to
him is that everyone at the time said he did.... All the historical
evidence ties William Shakespeare of Stratford to the plays bearing his
name.... [The] evidence for Shakespeare's authorship is abundant and
wide-ranging for the era in which he lived, much more abundant than the
comparable evidence for most other contemporary playwrights.... It's
true that no one single document states categorically that William
Shakespeare of Stratford-upon-Avon wrote Hamlet and King Lear, but then
no such document exists for any other playwright of the time either....
[There] is no indication in the historical record that anybody ever
suspected [&quot;Shakespeare&quot;] of being a pseudonym or said that anybody
other than William Shakespeare was the author.... No Elizabethan ever
suggested that Shakespeare's plays and poems were written by someone
else, or that Shakespeare the player was not Shakespeare the author, or
that Shakespeare the Globe-sharer was not Shakespeare of Stratford....
[His] contemporaries knew who he was, and there was never any doubt in
the minds of those who knew him.... [No] person of the Elizabethan and
Jacobean eras ever doubted the attribution [of these works to William.]&quot;
(My emphases.)

This argument displays a hopelessly naive view of history and the
&quot;historical record.&quot; Kathman is really telling us only what we already
know and what no Oxfordian doubts: that William was identified as the
Bard in his own time and that no record of anyone denying this has
survived. But this means much less than he wants it to mean.

Anyone who has ever investigated any historical problem knows how
fragmentary and ambiguous our records of the past are. Witnesses may
lie, be deceived, exaggerate, fudge, repeat hearsay, shield their
friends, or inflate their own certainty. They may even collude to
conceal the truth.

Moreover, our records of the past are a minute fraction of the full,
irretrievable reality of the past. As C.S. Lewis once put it, we may
think of the past as a huge library that has burned down, and of
recorded history as a single line in a single book that happened to
survive the fire. That is roughly the proportion between the past and
what we actually know of it.

It's ingenuous to suppose that the &quot;historical record&quot; is complete,
reliable, unambiguous, and transparent. &quot;But what will history say?&quot;
asks Major Swindon in Bernard Shaw's The Devil's Disciple; to which
General Burgoyne replies: &quot;History, sir, will tell lies, as usual.&quot; We
needn't be quite as cynical as Burgoyne; but Swindon's question
certainly represents a common assumption that &quot;history&quot; speaks with
simple finality and utters verdicts beyond appeal, rather like a
documentary narrated by Walter Cronkite.

Kathman likewise assumes that the &quot;historical record&quot; is exhaustive
when he assures us that &quot;everyone&quot; in Elizabethan England thought one
thing, or that &quot;nobody&quot; - &quot;ever&quot;! - doubted another. How can he, or
anyone else, possibly know this?

Just for openers, most gossip that contradicts the official version of
events is never recorded. We have no way of knowing what was really in
the &quot;minds&quot; of &quot;all&quot; Elizabethans, or even &quot;all&quot; of William's
acquaintances; we can only guess at what they &quot;ever suspected.&quot; And it
may be that we have better testimony of William's authorship than of,
say, Thomas Kyd's; but that doesn't mean that the testimony for either
is sufficient, let alone incontrovertible. It's even possible that the
meager testimony for Kyd is sounder than the more abundant testimony for
William; volume isn't decisive.

Kathman writes as if the &quot;historical record&quot; were a neat set of
notarized statements, scrupulously set down for posterity. In actual
fact, it's a bizarre miscellany of things, many of which were recorded
less by design than by accident. It permits boundless variety of
interpretation and fairly little in the way of certainty. And, of
course, we never know how much is missing from the record.

Aristotle cautions us against demanding more certitude than the nature
of the subject admits; there is no mathematical exactitude in history.
The Anglican bishop Richard Whately summed it up in a profound aphorism:
&quot;He who is unaware of his ignorance will be only misled by his
knowledge.&quot; When a man presumes to say what &quot;everyone&quot; thought, in any
period, he calls his own judgment into question. Such grandiose claims
are anything but &quot;scholarly.&quot;

Notice that Kathman tacitly rules out the Bard's works as part of the
&quot;historical record&quot; - even for purposes of determining the Bard's
identity! He parenthetically admits that he thinks the Sonnets refer to
real people and events, but he leaves it at that. He doesn't treat the
Sonnets as pertinent &quot;evidence&quot; for the question of authorship, though
the poet writes in the first person and seems to make some intimate
disclosures about himself. After all, it says &quot;Shakespeare&quot; wrote them,
doesn't it? What more proof do we need? For Kathman the title page of
the Sonnets counts as the &quot;historical record,&quot; but the Sonnets
themselves don't! What the poet says about himself actually seems to
count for less, in his mind, than what the Folio tributes say about him.

I, on the other hand, think the Sonnets give us some of the most
crucial evidence we have, and I think they point to Oxford. Kathman
calls my reading of the Sonnets &quot;subjective&quot;; in fact he is addicted to
the word subjective, like a first-year philosophy student who has just
added it to his vocabulary and snatches every opportunity to use it. (He
also repeats the phrase notoriously subjective several times.)

It's not clear what he means by this, except that to his way of
thinking the &quot;subjective&quot; is the polar opposite of the &quot;historical
record.&quot; Allow me to expose the inner workings of my subjectivity.

The poet of the Sonnets says that he is &quot;old,&quot; and he calls the youth a
&quot;youth,&quot; to whom he is as a &quot;decrepit father&quot;; from such details I infer
that the poet is a generation older than the youth, just as Oxford was a
generation older than the Earl of Southampton. The poet says he is
&quot;lame,&quot; the same word Oxford several times used to describe himself. The
poet constantly laments his &quot;disgrace,&quot;&quot;shames,&quot;&quot;blots,&quot;&quot;vulgar
scandal,&quot; et cetera; Oxford led a scandalous life and fell into
disgrace. The poet uses fifty of the same legal terms we find in
Oxford's letters, as well as many of the specific words, images, and
themes Oxford uses in his 1573 letter to Thomas Bedingfield. The poet
hopes his &quot;name&quot; will be &quot;buried&quot; and &quot;forgotten,&quot; which accords
perfectly with Oxford's authorship but is baffling if we posit
William's. The poet, with his &quot;two loves,&quot; male and female, seems to be
bisexual; Oxford not only had an amour resulting in a bastard son, but
was accused of &quot;buggering boys.&quot;

These are only a few of the reasons the Sonnets provide for thinking
Oxford was the poet. There is another one, of course. Kathman quibbles
over whether the youth was really ...

Thanks for posting, I hadn't seen that.

It is odd that people who do not agree with Strats get psychological
labels. From Kathman:

I too have a friend who worked at Globe Education (had been an actor,

going over The First Folio together, discussing this and that. He is
a passionate Stratfordian, and thinks the case conclusive, and is
dismissive of other views. Yet he has only spoken of Mark Rylance
with respect. From Kathman we get a casual unattributed slander --
his contribution to the modern historical record. So when Sobran
labels him &quot;partisan&quot;, as opposed to scholarly, I cannot help but
agree.

I see that The Marlowe Society here (despite its keenness to
get rid of the anti-Stratfordian image it acquired under the
influence of Dolly Wraight), now has Mark Rylance as its
President. The Vice-Presidents now include such luminaries
as G.R.Batho and Park Honan. The latter is apparently working
on a biography of Marlowe, so it was interesting to see his
defence of the notorious &quot;?1593&quot; in Poets' Corner on the
Society's website recently.

Given Sobran's take on the Sonnets, I wonder what meaning he
would give to those last two lines of Sonnet 112 we have been
discussing - saying as they do that the poet is thought to be
dead, and (according to Sonnet 74) &quot;The coward conquest of a
wretches knife, to base of thee to be remembred&quot;.

A small correction. Plus a second remark: what is not odd at all is
the way anti-Stratfordians avoid engaging Dave Kathman's essays at his
and Terry Ross's website to key on his offhand negative remarks about
. . . people like Mark Rylance.

That's unfair to the Baconians who have material evidence
of Bacon's authorship.

There is no material evidence to support the abundance of
superstitions of the sort you listed and I would put Oxfordianism
and Marlovianism in that category since neither has material
evidence of authorship.

Strats have a limited amount of material evidence described
by a wrong theory.

&gt; From the Mike Rubbo documentary, &quot;Much Ado About Something,&quot; it was not
&gt; _too_ difficult to see how some might consider Mark Rylance &quot;mad,&quot; though to
&gt; my perception he was no more &quot;mad&quot; than many other actors. If I remember
&gt; correctly, Dave was replying to my question about the exhibit, which I'd
&gt; seen in May or June 2000 (several months before I popped in to hlas). I
&gt; didn't see a booklet.

&gt; I thought perhaps &quot;putting fruit under pyramids&quot; was supposed to be sexual.

&gt; As for Sobran, having read only a handful of things he's written, all I
&gt; think on the web, I wonder whether he's ever read anyone he's thought
&gt; _wasn't_ &quot;partisan.&quot;

&gt; I looked at the article Lynne linked to the other day and decided it
&gt; probably made more sense attached to &quot;Alias Shakespeare,&quot; which is the first
&gt; reference cited, but I can only get it by Inter-Library Loan, so I probably
&gt; won't be just glancing at it casually.

Which article is that, Janice? I've linked to a few, I think and am
not sure which one you're referring to. And by the way, I don't link
to anything of Sobran's as a matter of principle.

Best wishes,
Lynne

No, it's not. Kathman doesn't really cite
'Stratfordian scholars'. Kathman cites scholars whose area

of these scholars think William Shakespeare of Stratford
wrote the works. It's an important point that is worth
bringing out.

If that was the total substance of Nelson's
argument, perhaps it could be described as absurd. But I
would like to see the complete context before agreeing that
was the total substance of Nelson's argument.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; But Kathman reveals an even more serious flaw. Consider his positive
&gt;case for William's authorship, in his own words:

&gt; How do we know that Shakespeare wrote Shakespeare? We know because the
&gt;historical record tells us so, strongly and unequivocally.... The most
&gt;obvious evidence that William Shakespeare wrote the works attributed to
&gt;him is that everyone at the time said he did.... All the historical
&gt;evidence ties William Shakespeare of Stratford to the plays bearing his
&gt;name.... [The] evidence for Shakespeare's authorship is abundant and
&gt;wide-ranging for the era in which he lived, much more abundant than the
&gt;comparable evidence for most other contemporary playwrights.... It's
&gt;true that no one single document states categorically that William
&gt;Shakespeare of Stratford-upon-Avon wrote Hamlet and King Lear, but then
&gt;no such document exists for any other playwright of the time either....
&gt;[There] is no indication in the historical record that anybody ever
&gt;suspected [&quot;Shakespeare&quot;] of being a pseudonym or said that anybody
&gt;other than William Shakespeare was the author.... No Elizabethan ever
&gt;suggested that Shakespeare's plays and poems were written by someone
&gt;else, or that Shakespeare the player was not Shakespeare the author, or
&gt;that Shakespeare the Globe-sharer was not Shakespeare of Stratford....
&gt;[His] contemporaries knew who he was, and there was never any doubt in
&gt;the minds of those who knew him.... [No] person of the Elizabethan and
&gt;Jacobean eras ever doubted the attribution [of these works to William.]&quot;
&gt;(My emphases.)

&gt; This argument displays a hopelessly naive view of history and the
&gt;&quot;historical record.&quot;

"/>

No, it displays a very good summary of the arguments
and details that are contained at the Kathman/Ross website -
details and arguments that not addressed in this essay by
Sobran.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Kathman is really telling us only what we already
&gt;know and what no Oxfordian doubts: that William was identified as the
&gt;Bard in his own time and that no record of anyone denying this has
&gt;survived. But this means much less than he wants it to mean.

"/>

Sobran should spend some time at hlas. There are
those here who claim, with a straight face, that Shakespeare
couldn't even read or write. How could such an &quot;illiterate
bumpkin&quot; be identified as the Bard in his own time?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Anyone who has ever investigated any historical problem knows how

&gt;conceal the truth.

"/>

This is quite true. And yet, the historical record
is the main thing we have in examing history.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Moreover, our records of the past are a minute fraction of the full,

&gt;recorded history as a single line in a single book that happened to
&gt;survive the fire. That is roughly the proportion between the past and
&gt;what we actually know of it.

I think C.S. Lewis may be exagerrating a bit. But
he's making a good point.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; It's ingenuous to suppose that the &quot;historical record&quot; is complete,

"/>

Where does Kathman say that in the quote which is
provided by Sobran? I think what Kathman is saying is that
the evidence which we have all points to William Shakespeare
of Stratford being the author. And he's right.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&quot;But what will history say?&quot;
&gt;asks Major Swindon in Bernard Shaw's The Devil's Disciple; to which
&gt;General Burgoyne replies: &quot;History, sir, will tell lies, as usual.&quot; We
&gt;needn't be quite as cynical as Burgoyne; but Swindon's question
&gt;certainly represents a common assumption that &quot;history&quot; speaks with
&gt;simple finality and utters verdicts beyond appeal, rather like a
&gt;documentary narrated by Walter Cronkite.

"/>

Okay, that's it then! Let's throw out all the
historical records we have - they're all nonsense and lies!

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Kathman likewise assumes that the &quot;historical record&quot; is exhaustive
&gt;when he assures us that &quot;everyone&quot; in Elizabethan England thought one
&gt;thing, or that &quot;nobody&quot; - &quot;ever&quot;! - doubted another. How can he, or
&gt;anyone else, possibly know this?

"/>

That's not what he's saying. What he's saying is
that all the evidence *which we have* indicates that no-one
questioned the authorship of William Shakespeare of
Stratford. If Joseph Sobran has some evidence to the
contrary, I'm sure Dave Kathman and a lot of other people
would enjoy seeing it.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Just for openers, most gossip that contradicts the official version of
&gt;events is never recorded. We have no way of knowing what was really in
&gt;the &quot;minds&quot; of &quot;all&quot; Elizabethans,

True. But what does this have to do with anything
Dave Kathman has written?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

"/>

True. But what does this have to do with anything
Dave Kathman has written?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;we can only guess at what they &quot;ever suspected.&quot;

"/>

I suppose we can, if we want to. But what does this
have to do with anything Dave Kathman has written? In the
quoted passage above, Kathman says (with my emphasis):
&quot;[There] is no indication IN THE HISTORICAL RECORD that
anybody ever suspected [&quot;Shakespeare&quot;] of being a
pseudonym...&quot;. And he's right.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;And it
&gt;may be that we have better testimony of William's authorship than of,
&gt;say, Thomas Kyd's; but that doesn't mean that the testimony for either
&gt;is sufficient, let alone incontrovertible. It's even possible that the
&gt;meager testimony for Kyd is sounder than the more abundant testimony for
&gt;William; volume isn't decisive.

"/>

Fair point. So try explaining that to some of the
anti-Strats around here, who keep yapping about the paucity
of evidence we have for William Shakespeare.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Kathman writes as if the &quot;historical record&quot; were a neat set of
&gt;notarized statements, scrupulously set down for posterity. In actual
&gt;fact, it's a bizarre miscellany of things, many of which were recorded
&gt;less by design than by accident. It permits boundless variety of
&gt;interpretation and fairly little in the way of certainty. And, of
&gt;course, we never know how much is missing from the record.

&gt;&gt;&gt; As for Sobran, having read only a handful of things he's written, all I
&gt;&gt;&gt; think on the web, I wonder whether he's ever read anyone he's thought
&gt;&gt;&gt; _wasn't_ &quot;partisan.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt; I looked at the article Lynne linked to the other day and decided it
&gt;&gt;&gt; probably made more sense attached to &quot;Alias Shakespeare,&quot; which is the first
&gt;&gt;&gt; reference cited, but I can only get it by Inter-Library Loan, so I probably
&gt;&gt;&gt; won't be just glancing at it casually.

&gt;&gt;&gt; -- Janice

&gt;&gt; Which article is that, Janice? I've linked to a few, I think and am
&gt;&gt; not sure which one you're referring to. And by the way, I don't link
&gt;&gt; to anything of Sobran's as a matter of principle.

&gt; The Altschuler article, &quot;Searching for Shakespeare in the Stars.&quot;
&gt; Unfortunately, not everybody who thinks of Sobran thinks, first, of his
&gt; white-supremacist writings; and in any event, I am not aware of why,
&gt; exactly, Sobran should be thought of _primarily_ in light of those writings,
&gt; when others (with a similar range of interests and similar political
&gt; positions) are not.

&gt; It's also my impression, at the moment, that books are better sources than
&gt; essays, especially online essays. Which is why I suspect Sobran's
&gt; full-length published book would be more worth reading than any web site,
&gt; from whatever point of view. I could be wrong, but my experience so far
&gt; with both books and shorter pieces inclines me in that direction. Of
&gt; course, whether any book makes sense or not depends on a lot of assumptions
&gt; -- for me, it's easier to see what those assumptions are, in a book.

&gt; -- Janice

"/>

Thanks, Janice. I tend to agree that reading a book is usually better
than looking at a website. In fact, Sobran was the first author I read
on the authorship question, before I found out about his less
salubrious beliefs. If there are any others with such beliefs who are
famous for authorship question writing (with the exception of Raeto
West, who I already know aboout), I'd be happy to hear about them.
Then I'll likely cross them off my list too.

Unfortunately, to take up one of your other points, some material is
not yet available in book form, and when I'm making an argument and
people on hlas ask me for proof, sometimes the only material I can
refer them to is either on a website or in someone's article online.
There's a tremendous amount of research going on, both Strat and
non-Strat, and little of it is yet in books.

Best wishes,
Lynne

I'm surprised that Sobran &quot;replied&quot; to Kathman. I note that he seems
not to reply to the substance of what Kathman said, though.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; David Kathman and the &quot;Historical Record&quot;
&gt;&gt; A Reply to David Kathman's Selective Critique
&gt;&gt; Copyright Â© 2000 by The Vere Company
&gt;&gt; by Joseph Sobran

&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;David Kathman, editor of a website on the Shakespeare authorship
&gt;&gt;question, offers many criticisms of those who deny that William of
&gt;&gt;Stratford was the Bard,

&gt; Criticisms of their arguments, mainly.

&gt;&gt;reserving special scorn for those of us who
&gt;&gt;think the real Bard was Edward de Vere, Earl of Oxford. He calls me a
&gt;&gt;&quot;non-scholar,&quot; in contrast to the genuine &quot;scholars&quot; who hold the
&gt;&gt;traditional view.

&gt;&gt; Some of Kathman's specific criticisms of Oxfordians (including me) are
&gt;&gt;warranted.

&gt; There's still hope.

&gt;&gt;He is an able and well-informed advocate for William and he
&gt;&gt;is skillful at catching his opponents' factual errors and
&gt;&gt;overstatements.

&gt; Yes, he is.

"/>

Note the propagandistic and essentially empty nature of Sobran's
compliment. He is clearly trying to set himself up as a good guy who
can manfully accept criticism, and acknowledge the worth of his
opponent. He doesn't say anything about Kathman's catching his
opponents' incredibly misconceived arguments, only his opponents'
factual errors and overstatements.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Unfortunately, Kathman himself writes not like a scholar, but like a
&gt;&gt;lawyer; his goal is not truth, but victory.

&gt; I think Kathman's intended audience for the website
&gt; is a non-academic one. He writes like someone who wants to
&gt; set the record straight.

"/>

Right. I've read Sobran's articles and his book. He is describing
himself.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;Far from writing with
&gt;&gt;impartial detachment, he spares his own &quot;side&quot; the scathing criticisms
&gt;&gt;he inflicts on Oxfordians. He treats the Oxfordian Charlton Ogburn as a
&gt;&gt;fool, but overlooks the egregious vulnerabilities of the eccentric
&gt;&gt;Stratfordian Alan Nelson,

"/>

Such as?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; since Nelson is on his &quot;side.&quot; Kathman seems
&gt;&gt;to feel that the Stratfordian &quot;side&quot; can't afford to make the slightest
&gt;&gt;concession to the heretics. He won't allow that any Oxfordian has ever
&gt;&gt;raised a legitimate objection or found a real weakness in Stratfordian
&gt;&gt;scholarship.

"/>

So far, nothing from Joe but ad hominemry.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Which legitimate objections, or real weaknesses
&gt; would those be?

&gt;&gt; Though Oxfordians obviously reject the authority of academic
&gt;&gt;Shakespeare scholars, Kathman constantly appeals to the shared opinions
&gt;&gt;of those scholars as if this could decide the authorship controversy: he
&gt;&gt;assures us that &quot;the majority of Shakespeare scholars today doubt&quot; one
&gt;&gt;proposition, another is &quot;not very widely accepted today among
&gt;&gt;Shakespeare scholars,&quot; a third is &quot;shared by essentially all Shakespeare
&gt;&gt;scholars you could ask,&quot;&quot;most scholars today believe&quot; yet another, &quot;the
&gt;&gt;majority of Shakespeare scholars today doubt&quot; a fifth, and so on.

&gt;&gt; Kathman is intelligent enough to realize that citing Stratfordian
&gt;&gt;scholars to prove the Stratfordian position is circular reasoning,

&gt; No, it's not. Kathman doesn't really cite
&gt; 'Stratfordian scholars'. Kathman cites scholars whose area
&gt; of expertise include Shakespeare. The overwelming majority
&gt; of these scholars think William Shakespeare of Stratford
&gt; wrote the works. It's an important point that is worth
&gt; bringing out.

"/>

He mainly cites authorities, as we all must, not (I think) to show
they support his belief that Shakespeare was Shakespeare but to show
the falsity of certain claims of Shakespeare-rejecters about facts,
such as the fact that books were available in Stratford in
Shakespeare's time, which some Shakespeare-rejecters deny. (I don't
know if this was something Dave discussed in his essay, which I've
read but am too lazy to check, but it is an example of what he uses
authorities for.)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;but
&gt;&gt;he is eager to show that the traditional view is held by all the Best
&gt;&gt;People. Being more partisan than scholar, he seeks a polemical victory
&gt;&gt;in discrediting those he considers his opponents. Never does he give an
&gt;&gt;Oxfordian credit for making a sound point;

&gt; Which sound points were those again?

&gt;&gt;never does he criticize a
&gt;&gt;fellow Stratfordian for fatuity.

&gt; That's not the purpose of his website.

&gt;&gt;He maintains a loyal silence even when
&gt;&gt;Nelson, trying to explain why the poet of the Sonnets seems much older
&gt;&gt;than the youth, absurdly surmises that William &quot;felt old&quot; because he was
&gt;&gt;&quot;prematurely balding.&quot;

&gt; If that was the total substance of Nelson's
&gt; argument, perhaps it could be described as absurd.

"/>

Not if you talk to someone like me, who went bald at 25. Or to an
athlete in his twenties who has been seriously injured.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; But I would like to see the complete context before agreeing that
&gt; was the total substance of Nelson's argument.

That a man in his thirties might refer to himself as &quot;old&quot;&amp;c.when in love
with a boy in his teens doesn't seem the least bit improbable to me.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ...
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; As for Sobran, having read only a handful of things he's written, all
I
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; think on the web, I wonder whether he's ever read anyone he's thought
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; _wasn't_ &quot;partisan.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I looked at the article Lynne linked to the other day and decided it
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; probably made more sense attached to &quot;Alias Shakespeare,&quot; which is
the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; first
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; reference cited, but I can only get it by Inter-Library Loan, so I
probably
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; won't be just glancing at it casually.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; -- Janice

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Which article is that, Janice? I've linked to a few, I think and am
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; not sure which one you're referring to. And by the way, I don't link
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to anything of Sobran's as a matter of principle.

&gt;&gt;&gt; The Altschuler article, &quot;Searching for Shakespeare in the Stars.&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Unfortunately, not everybody who thinks of Sobran thinks, first, of his
&gt;&gt;&gt; white-supremacist writings; and in any event, I am not aware of why,
&gt;&gt;&gt; exactly, Sobran should be thought of _primarily_ in light of those
writings,
&gt;&gt;&gt; when others (with a similar range of interests and similar political
&gt;&gt;&gt; positions) are not.

&gt;&gt;&gt; It's also my impression, at the moment, that books are better sources
than
&gt;&gt;&gt; essays, especially online essays. Which is why I suspect Sobran's
&gt;&gt;&gt; full-length published book would be more worth reading than any web
site,
&gt;&gt;&gt; from whatever point of view. I could be wrong, but my experience so
far
&gt;&gt;&gt; with both books and shorter pieces inclines me in that direction. Of
&gt;&gt;&gt; course, whether any book makes sense or not depends on a lot of
assumptions
&gt;&gt;&gt; -- for me, it's easier to see what those assumptions are, in a book.

&gt;&gt;&gt; -- Janice

&gt;&gt; Thanks, Janice. I tend to agree that reading a book is usually better
&gt;&gt; than looking at a website. In fact, Sobran was the first author I read
&gt;&gt; on the authorship question, before I found out about his less
&gt;&gt; salubrious beliefs. If there are any others with such beliefs who are
&gt;&gt; famous for authorship question writing (with the exception of Raeto
&gt;&gt; West, who I already know aboout), I'd be happy to hear about them.
&gt;&gt; Then I'll likely cross them off my list too.

&gt;&gt; Unfortunately, to take up one of your other points, some material is
&gt;&gt; not yet available in book form, and when I'm making an argument and
&gt;&gt; people on hlas ask me for proof, sometimes the only material I can
&gt;&gt; refer them to is either on a website or in someone's article online.
&gt;&gt; There's a tremendous amount of research going on, both Strat and
&gt;&gt; non-Strat, and little of it is yet in books.

&gt;&gt; Best wishes,
&gt;&gt; Lynne

&gt; Thank you for the advice, Lynne.

&gt; I must say you have settled in here much quicker than anyone ever has, in
&gt; the three years I've been participating here. You really are making a
hit.
&gt; I don't think anyone else has attracted the amount and quality of response
&gt; from the regulars that you have, not to mention the respect, not so
quickly.

Thanks, Janice. That's very kind, and it's also one of the nicest things
anyone has ever said to me. :)

We know few facts about the lives of either Oxford or the Stratman.

What facts we do know are remarkably similar.

I suggest that a good portion of the riddle on the Stratford monument:

&quot;Read if thou canst&quot;

involves recognizing this similarity.

Actually Webb claims to be a skeptic himself in that he is open to any
BETTER theory on who might have written the works of Shakespeare. Catch 22
is that all theories MUST be based upon a literal interpretation of the
historical record. Hence, if it wasn't William Shakespeare then it had to be
someone with the same name.
