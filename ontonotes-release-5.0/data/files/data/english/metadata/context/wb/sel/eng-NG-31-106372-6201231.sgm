How to get medical records revised or sealed

I had a hospital stay a few years ago after serious accident, and at
least a few of the treating physicians made inappropriate entries in my
medical records, ones that have seriously biased other physicians I've
visited since.  I'm also concerned because these records could
potentially impact the care I'll receive if I am hospitalized again.

What can I do?  The hospital has offered me the opportunity to enter a
statement in the record, explaining my position on the comments.
However, this doesn't seem terribly helpful, as the comments of an M.D.
always carry a great deal of weight, far more than those of a patient.

There are also some highly damaging remarks from two physicians at
family practice clinics. I have no idea what my rights are concerning
these records, and those clinics are not going to allow me to enter any
kind of statement.

What, if anything, can I do?  I don't want anyone to see these
records... ever. Any ideas would be appreciated.

You can't control if the records are seen by another provider (or
billing) at the establishment where you say you had the misinformation
entered. You can, of course, refuse to permit other providers to see
those records by not signing a release of those records to the new
provider.

If you wish to expunge the record, that's another whole kettle of fish
and one not easily boiled. If so post back that you do.

Also if the information you say is erroneous demands disclosure, you
can't do anything about that disclosure. For example, I am mandated in
some of my work to report if I *suspect* child abuse or if I *suspect*
that there may be an act of violence.

Your post lacks sufficient detail to give a firm response.

Whitewater,

You have sought medical care and treatment. As a part of this care you
were seen by physicians who made notes about their opinions of you, a
diagnosis, and a plan of treatment. These notes are a part of your medical
record. You feel that some of these opinions were "inappropriate" but offer
no explanation. You do indicate that several physicians have done this to
you. You have been offered the opportunity to record a statement explaining
your feelings about these opinions but you have rejected that. You ask for
advice.
You can always change doctors and hospitals. Inform the new physicians
that you wish them to start new records and forbid them to consult the old
records. It's possible that they will refuse your business. It's also
possible that the new physicians will reach the same opinions independently
thus putting you back to the beginning.
I don't see that you have a right to edit, delete, change, et c the
opinions of the experts whom you hired to give these opinions. It's possible
under some circumstances, I suppose, and if you have the money to waste you
may wish to consult an attorney.

Good luck,
Dave M.

"Highly Damaging Remarks" ?
That's a serious allegation.

At a minimum, you should take the hospital up on their offer to allow you to
add your own comments to the doctor's notes.

To the best of my knowledge, these aren't court documents and you can't get
your medical records sealed.

Without knowing what the doctors wrote, its impossible to judge if their
remarks are "inappropriate".   If you feel strongly that the remarks are
inappropriate and or misleading, then you could always find a physician who
is not affiliated with the family practice clinic to examine you and review
your medical records.  Ask him for his opinion. If he agrees that the
remarks were inappropriate and prejudicial then you can add his comment to
your medical records. If he agrees with the other doctors, then I would
suggest you drop the issue and move on with your life.

Just to play devil's advocate here...

Who says the remarks are "inappropriate"?  If you are not a medical
professional, you have no basis to say what should or should not be in
your medical record.  If you're not a doctor, you have no basis to say
that their opinions are incorrect.  You might have a basis to say that
events the doctors recorded transpired differently (or not at all), but
that doesn't let you delete the parts you disagree with.  It might give
you a basis to supplement the record, though.

BTW, what do you mean by "biased"?

There is nothing you can do to change the record without the hospital's
cooperation -- unless your state's law says so.  Generally, you have no
right to modify a medical record unless you are the person who created
it (even if you are the subject of the record).

I have to tell you how skeptical I am that at least five doctors on (at

I should if the comments do not apply to *ME*.  Here, I am throwing

medical identity theft.  If my medical record has become a hodgepodge

And that would be a red flag to the second doctor.
If I were the doctor and I had a patient who had a history of a medical
problem and they wouldn't let me see those records, I would probably refuse
to see them.

Unless its a medical emergency, a doctor can refuse to provide treatment.

Gordon,

You raise the specter of identity theft in regard to Whitewater's post
about :"inappropriate" findings in his medical record.
I saw  nothing in his post that raised even the suspicion of identity
theft. Further he did not suggest that lab results or other bits of someone
else's medical records had been incorrectly placed in his record. He seemed
to be objecting to records about himself.
Medical records do get mixed up occasionally and identity theft has
happened. I would think that hospitals and doctor's offices recognize and
have procedures to deal with this. I don't believe that is the issue here

Except, of course, for marketing purposes....

HIPAA, per the attorneys I've asked, does more to allow than prevent
trafficing in medical data.

(Besides, if the case is going to court, I'd rather fight the other

better lawyers.)

You raise a good point.  The patient/claimant must decide whether to
release the records or forfeit insurance benefits and/or a liability
claim to pay the medical expenses.  But life is full of trade-offs, and
he has the option of maintaining his privacy.  Surrender of privacy (or
a portion of it) is the price of having someone else pay the freight.

">

We had a detailed thread on this topic here on MLM several years ago
IIRC, so if you look for archived posts in your favorite search engine
you may get quite a bit of  opinion on the subject.   IIRC the main
upshot of those discussions was that the actual medical records, i.e.
the physical paper and/or hard drives etc. they are printed on and the
data that is in them, is the property of the medical provider who made
the records, but that HIPAA gives you the patient certain rights as to
the conditions under which the information in those records can be
shared with other people.

So, no, I don't think you have any right to actually destroy and/or
modify the original records and any modification or addition that the
provider does permit you to make will become part of the record along
with, but not in place of,  the original, allegedly "inappropriate"
record.

I have a hard time pinning down just what you are talking about as
"inappropriate"; do you mean medically incorrect (a misdiagnosis), or
do you mean the records include matters that you feel are medically
irrelevant and embarrassing/harmful (talking about a mental health
issue or an abortion or a drug habit or STDs in a simple whiplash case,
e.g.).

If it's the latter, I'm not surprised if it's the OTHER GUY's insurance
company you're talking about, since they routinely hire "hired gun"
doctors to examine the claimant and tell the jury that there's really
nothing wrong with her, that she's making it up for "secondary gain"
(i.e. to help her win more money in the lawsuit), that she's crazy in
the head, or blurting out other irrelevant but embarrassing facts about
your medical history that have nothing to do with your injuries from
the accident but which are brought up simply to make the jury less
likely to award in your favor, or to award as large an amount, as they
would have if the scurrilous facts had not been brought out.

Keep in mind that these "defense medical examiners" are NOT acting as
_your_ treating doctor when they do this, so they are not bound by
doctor-patient confidentiality (if your state even recognizes such a
thing) and they are being paid by the other guy's insurance company in
your accident case, expressly to SCREW you (ruin your case, that is).
They routinely write reports that include all kinds of heinous lies and
misinformation and share that info with the other guy's insurance
company and, if it comes to trial, with the jury, unless your own
attorney is diligent in filing motions to keep such irrelevant and
prejudicial stuff _out_ of the hearing of the jury (and even then, the
defense will finagle to let some of it get into evidence one way or
another).   If it's a defense medical exam and report you're talking
about, YES you may have rights to have such reports sealed and not be
used except by further court order (which a court, unfortunately, IS
likely to permit, if you get involved in _another_ accident case and
claim personal bodily injury).

You probably don't want to post details here out of privacy concerns,
of course, but if this really matters to you, you should consult an
actual, live lawyer locally who can hear all your facts in confidence,
keep your secrets for you, but can still advise you on how best to
proceed.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I'm also concerned because these records could

">

No sensible doctor will want to treat you these days without checking
your relevant prior medical history first.   If this stuff you're
complaining about is truly irrelevant (your lawyer can advise you if it
is or not), you simply don't have to tell the new doctor about it when
he asks for your relevant medical history.   If it is something the
other side's insurance company will have access to in the event of a
later accident, however, your lawyer for the second accident BETTER
know about it, which means you will have to tell HIM and follow his
advice on who else you should tell.

Keep in mind that the insurance companies all share access to a massive
database called simply the "insurance index" and will routinely do an
"index search" on EVERY new claimant to find out all they can about ANY
prior claims you have ever made with ANY insurance co.   So, that
information IS out there, and there may not be anything you can do
about getting it sealed and hidden even if you DID have a legal right
to do so; at least, to the extent you may be a plaintiff or claimant in
a case arising from a later accident.   For personal injury claimants,
EVERYTHING in your past medical history is legally "relevant" at least
for "discovery" purposes, meaning the other side has a right to find
out about them even if it may not be "admissible" into evidence at
trial, so long as their request to obtain such information before trial
is "reasonably calculated" to _possibly_ lead to the discovery of
admissible evidence.   The pre-trial discovery rules, once a case is in
suit, are pretty broad and liberal about what they allow an
information-seeking opponent to find out about.

That depends.   I don't see how anyone can even give you an opinion
agreeing or disagreeing with that statement except in the broadest and
least useful sense, since we have no idea what the facts are that you

previous doctors included in their reports.

Um, how _can_ they do that, even if they want to?  Prevent you from
making a statement, that is?  Your "record" at that clinic should
include EVERYTHING they have in their files about you, and as a general
principle they should keep in your files everthing they GET from or
about you, including correspondence.  So, if you (or your attorney)
simply write them a letter stating your concerns, send it certified
mail so that YOU have a record it was received, and include language in
the letter asking that it be kept with your file, the clinic would have
to think long and hard about THEIR potential liabilities if they simply
ignored your letter and tossed it in the wastebasket.

For real advice, see a local lawyer in private confidence.  But chances

records, even though there may be some ways you can _limit_ access to
them.  Good luck,

First of all, a finding that someone is "fully liable" for your medical
expenses is a complex conclusion after all the evidence is in, not a
simple prior given that is known before you go to trial.  "Full
liability" means not only that the defendant's conduct was found to be
negligent (and also that you were _not_ found to be in any way
negligent, in most states using the comparative negligence rule), it
also means that the defendant's negligence was proven to be the legally
responsible (i.e. "proximate") cause of the specific injury you claim.

If someone runs a red light and T-bones your car, but you then claim
that the crash caused you to suffer, say, lung cancer, the insurer (and
juries) may be a bit skeptical and want to know about your past medical
history to try to refute that claim.  They'd want to know, for
instance, if you were a smoker, and if you ever worked with asbestos,
and if you ever worked around chemicals, and if you had a history of
emphysema or bronchitis, etc.  A claim that the crash caused you a
broken arm is a lot less likely to need corroborating proof of
causation, since it is fairly obvious that you were not already driving
along with bones sticking out of your arm and that the doctors put a
cast on you at the ER.   In the more common kinds of "soft-tissue-only"
injury claims, however, insurers and defense lawyers almost always do
challenge claims that their crash caused your injury, since it is quite
possible you were already experiencing aches and pains from some prior
incident before you got into the crash involving their insured driver.
They want to look for evidence to support a defense argument that it
was this prior condition, not the "light love tap" you received in the
crash at issue, that (at least in part) is responsible for your present
complaints and symptoms.   Often the defense will hire a medical expert
to examine you, review your prior records, and testify at trial to
support such arguments.

You're right IF what you mean is, that's all you have to prove (along
with some evidence of causation, if causation is not obvious from the
circumstances) in order to put on a prima facie tort case of damages in
a personal injury case.  But all that does is get you past a motion to
dismiss filed before the other side even has to put on any evidence.

That is not the same thing as saying you don't have to share your prior
medical records with the other side.   The defense is allowed to put on
a case too, and often, especially in cases of clear liability for the
crash itself, the defense effort focuses on _their_ medical experts'
claims (far fetched or otherwise) that it was not the crash that caused
the injury you are claiming, but rather some prior medical condition of
the victim for which the tortfeasor is not legally responsible.   That
argument often resonates with juries, unfortunately, even when it is
smoke and mirrors, and so as a practical matter, the plaintiff who
actually wants to WIN must do far more than the bare minimum required
to make a prima facie case.

So, before trial, the full range of plaintiff's prior medical history
is legally discoverable, subject only to the discretion of the court if
the plaintiff can convince the court to enter a protective order that
the particular material being sought is too remotely related to the
condition complained of to be of any possible relevance at trial and
thus is not "reasonably calculated to lead to discovery of admissible
evidence".

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; If his
&gt; insurance company won't defend or reimburse him unless I cooperate,
&gt; that's not my problem.
">

The insurer's refusal to pay (denial of your claim) in such a
circumstance just means they aren't willing to buy the pig in a poke
you are offering them.  If you want voluntary compensation paid before
filing suit, you still have to come up with the kind of evidence the
defense would like to see and would be legally entitled to ask for in
discovery after filing suit but before trial.  It is not an unfair
claim practice for them to do so; to the contrary, they have a duty to
their shareholders not to throw money away willy-nilly on potentially
frivolous claims where the claimant is not willing to provide
supporting evidence to prove the injury was not due to a prior medical
condition.  So it is very much your problem.

This is very different from an insurer's refusal to defend or to
reimburse their insured after you go all the way to trial and win a
verdict, and despite your use of those words I don't think that is what
you really had in mind.  Denial of a plaintiff's claim on factual
grounds relating to your particular claim is _not_ the same thing as
denial of any coverage at all for the insured defendant even if you
win.  A plaintiff claimant's refusal to cooperate provides no grounds
for a denial of _coverage_ since that would put control of whether or
not the defendant's insurance actually gave him any financial
protection in the hands of his opponent (you the plaintiff), an absurd
result.

But if you have forced the process to move to suit because you failed
to provide evidence of your prior medical history to defendant's
insurer voluntarily before suit, and if you likewise refuse to
cooperate in discovery with defendant's attorney after suit is filed,
chances are you will never get to the trial stage at all, since your
case is subject to being dismissed on the defense's motion as a
sanction for failure to provide discovery.

And if you do get to trial, you are frankly less than likely to
convince a jury to actually award you money, if the defense does raise
a medical causation issue and you choose not to actively refute it.
Doing so properly would require you to discuss your prior medical
history with the jury to show why you (and your medical expert
witnesses) claim that your history is NOT relevant to the proffered
lack-of-causation defense.   Either way, you have a choice: produce the
information, or lose the chance to get compensation for that part of
your claim even if the defendant's liability for the crash itself is
otherwise clear.

No one is every "fully" liable for your medical expenses.  An insurer
may be liable to the extent detailed in the policy.  A tortfeasor may
be liable for the results of the damages he causes.  But not for all of
your medical problems.

It is the right of the person responsible to have the actual amount
they owe reasonably determined.  If you don't give them access to any
of your medical information, that can't be done.

You forget that there are these disclosure and discovery rules in
civil cases.  If you refuse to provide the records under discovery,
the judge may apply sanctions, including:
. Not allowing you to testify about your injuries, because you are
suppressing relevant "hard" evidence, or even
. Directed verdict for the defendant.

I wrote "expenses" not "problems".

More detail of the hypothetical: I'm sitting in my own living room,
reading a book.  A car crashes through my wall and hits me, breaking
my legs.  I get medical treatment for the broken legs.

I claim that the driver is fully responsible for the costs of the
medical treatment for my broken legs.  He can get records of that
treatment, copies of the x-rays of my legs, etc.  I don't see any
reason he should be able to get medical records of my shoulder surgery
from 5 years ago, or my childhood measles, or anything else not
related to the treatment he's responsible for paying for.

I shouldn't even have to provide records from my knee problems in
college, even though my current medical costs might be higher than
someone else's (if he didn't have similar knee problems) would be; the
driver takes his victim (me) as he finds him, and if he didn't want to
pay for treatment of someone with knee problems, he should have hit
someone else.

Seth, you're missing the point that Stuart, more consisely than I, made
yesterday: how does the defendant's insurer, and then, the judge and/or
jury, determine which of your claimed expenses were actually due to the
injury caused by the accident?   This is called the "causation" issue.
None of those deciders is going to just take your word for it, unless,
as in your example below (and in my post yesterday), the causation is
clear and obvious, as with a broken bone.  For almost any other type of
claimed injury, they are going to want to look at your past medical
history, and the insurer's idea of what is relevant may be a lot
broader than yours.   Your remedy for that dispute is to seek a
protective order from the judge after your case is in suit if the other
side in fact requests production in discovery of materials you feel are
not sufficiently related to the issues in the suit to warrant
disclosure.   Just hiding those facts in the face of a facially
legitimate discovery request, in hopes the other side won't find out
about them, is a Very  Bad Idea since as several others have stated,
the other side may already know about them and your failure of
discovery could get your injury case dismissed or severely limited in
what the judge will allow you to claim.

Causation for a cleanly broken bone from a substantial impact trauma is
pretty obvious.   How about if it was only a hairline fracture, and you
indeed had that history of college football?   Wouldn't the defense be
entitled to look at your old leg injury records to see if there is
anything in them supporting the possibility of an undiagnosed hairline
fracture earlier?   And in soft tissue, sprain-strain injuries, where
sometimes the only evidence of injury is the victim's complaints of
pain and the fact of the impact, it is quite possible that some of the
pain claimed could be either faked, or due to a pre-existing condition.
Defendants are allowed to find that out too.

If they do ask for that stuff, you ask the judge for a protective
order, which he will either grant or not.   There is no hard and fast
rule; it is all very fact-specific to each case.

That is a true statement of the legal maxim, but the issue is, does it
apply to your case?   It is also true that, in the event he injures
someone like you with a pre-existing medical condition, the defendant
is only responsible for the ADDITIONAL pain and disability that he
caused over and above whatever you were still experiencing from your
earlier injury.   You claim you had zero residual pain and disability
from your football injuries?   Again, defense is not likely to take
that proffer at face value, and they are fully entitled by law to
inquire further, to see whether you are lying or exaggerating.   You
seem to be quite miffed that the other side in a lawsuit is not
required by law to believe everything you say without even a chance to
find possible cross-examination material.   In that case they might as
well not even show up for trial, and the judge can just award you
"fair" compensation based on your own testimony without the other side
ever having a chance to present contrary evidence.   I know you know
that is not how our adversary system works.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Although (at the end of a hard fought trial, in which your own advocate
will have to overcome the rocks thrown at your case by the defense
advocate) you _may_ wind up with the guy that hit you having to pay for
every bit of your claimed medical expense, plus an additional award for
your pain and suffering, you are putting the cart before the horse if
you say the defense is not even allowed to inquire into the possibility
of refuting these claims before trial.   That is what discovery is all
about.   After they look thru your prior meds and agree with you that
your college knee injury had nothing to do with the current symptoms,
they will probably settle, as happens more often than not.   But not
until you give them what they need to make sure they are not paying for
a false or exaggerated claim.
