Looks like Dave Haynie gets a nice two pager on Commodore demise on
ArsTechnica (aka Geek News for those of a technical bent..)

Looks like it might turn into a melodrama some time soon..

The article's writer took direct quotations from Dave's video,
&quot;The Deathbed Vigil&quot;.  In fact, the writer described the entire
beginning of the Deathbed Vigil; it looks as if he watched it.  The
Deathbed Vigil has been around for several years, is sold by Dave, and
was viewed at CommVEx v2.

I havent had the opportunity, but Commodore's demise still stuns me even
today. I cannot believe just how bad their marketing was. They had
products light-years ahead, and yet noone knew about them.

Commodore marketing should definitely be in the list of top ten failures

They had marketing?

At some point in the company's last years, I happened to flip past a
sailboat race on TV, and was amazed to see one of the sails printed with the
giant logo of their sponsor -- Commodore.  I had *no* idea the company still
existed!

I think the problem, on the face of it, was that CBM went from
golden-parachute CEOs to simple vampires, sitting in their boxes of native
earth down in the Bahamas, sucking the last of the juice out of the
corporate husk.  Why that happened is another question.

Someone from Marketing once chided me that now that they had the Amiga it
would practically sell itself, not like the C128.  I pictured them with
their feet kicked up on the desk just waiting for the sales to roll in
because after all, it had looked easy in Jack's era to those that didn't
appreciate how much work went into getting the name out there.

I saw only one Commodore commercial for the Amiga and that was near the end.
We saw a preview of the famous &quot;baby on a stick&quot; commercial and didn't
understand it and we KNEW what the commercial was supposed to be about.

The only time I saw Marketing for the C128 was the billboard in Vegas, and
teh thosands of flyers, proclaiming that the C128 was expandable to 512mb
(My boss had canned the MMU that supported this so wwe had to do it with DMA
after the fact) and I once read an article where they intervviewed Tom Dow
(they called him Tony Dow in the artcile) who shared that he was teh C128
project manager.  Only problem was I had never heard of him.  I promptly
went over and introduced myself figuriong that if he was running my project
I should at least take his measure.

Marketing?  Not reallyw hen I was there... better International, no school,
little consumer.

I still think it was more a lack of products than lack of marketting.
In 1993/1994, what products did CBM have to sell?

C64/C128? 8 Bit age was over.
AGA Amiga? It wasn't the killer machine from 1986 anymore. Every
lousy 386 with VGA card was better.

Sorry, but you HAD to go IBM PC at that time, because Amiga/CBM was
going nowhere.

According to the book, &quot;On the Edge: The Rise and Fall of
Commodore&quot;, the CD32 was a good seller in the winter of 1993.  If CBM
had sold 300,000 units instead of the 125,0000 they had manufactured,
those sales might have saved the company from bankruptcy.

Largely, yes... The C128 probably could have sold better than it did given
better marketing, though.  The Apple IIGS was having the same problem -- it
seemed rather uninteresting relative to Macs by that point -- but they were
still selling plenty o fthem.

Amigas really were still competitive when Commodore declared bankruptcy in
1994, but of course at that point it was clearly time to start looking
elsewhere.

I kept my Amiga 3000 until around 1996, by which point I was able to afford a
Pentium-based PC and had found Windows 95 to be not *too* awful. :-)

The CD32 isn't anything else than an A1200 with CD-ROM attached. And
at that time CD-ROM simply meant: &quot;boring annoying movie sequences&quot;
and &quot;stupid movie based games without much interaction&quot;. Other than
that, it just offered A500 games with more colors. Not too impressive.

And in 1995 with the launch of the Sony PS it would have died anyway.
The PS offered a number of cool new features (like rendering textured
polygons in hardware) which the CD32 didn't.

Uhm no the performance of the A1200 was really horrible compared to
a 386. You will never see Doom on an A1200 without turbo card. And
when the first usable turbo cards for A1200 appeared, PC people
already had 486's and were laughing about Amiga slowness again.

I remember in 1993 that I saw lot's of things on IBM PCs which were
simply impossible on Amiga. In 1986 when the A1000 was released it
was a killer machine easily 4 years ahead of all others, but then
CBM did nothing to keep up for 7 years. And when the A1200 came out,
it could not even compete with an average IBM PC (which got much
cheaper in the meantime).

I'm not talking Windows vs AmigaOS. It's the games which sell the
machine to the masses. And there is no way you get a 486 performance
Doom or Duke Nukem 3D on an Amiga. Even a 68060 card is way slower
than an average 486 PC when it comes to games.

And don't forget the horrible bitplane architecture of the Amiga.
Pixel based rendering with bitplanes is a thing you don't want to
do.

The FMV module wasn't standard, it was an add-on. Akiko was just the CD-ROM

itself especially since there was precious bugger all software to take

No battle, the PSX obliterated the CD32 in every possible way.
If 20 million C64/C128 sales could barely keep C= afloat then certainly the

I see your point, but remember that the company (by that stage) was
already suffering from a long history of poor marketing and the resulting
cash flow problems. Had they marketed properly throughout the history of
the company, then I have no doubt they would have had the resources for
R&amp;D in order to compete.

I remember several ads in the early 80s for the c64 here. I cant remember
any ads for the 128, much less the amiga based products.

As someone else pointed out, FMV was only optional.

And as for the Akiko: It only was there because AGA still had this
flaw of being planar. On a 386 PC you simply didn't need a
chunky to planar converter, because VGA is chunky in the first
place.

Oh and not to forget: Akiko ofcourse works from chipmem to chipmem,
so it used a hell lot of memory bandwidth at the weakest point
of the A1200: chipmem. I suppose a CPU based chunky to planar which
works from fastmem to chipmem is twice as fast (and still needs a
lot of bandwidth which you normally wouldnt want to waste).

Well, if you buy an A1200 in 1994, you SHOULD have been able to
play state-of-the-art games of 1994-1996. That's why I took the
PS1 vs CD32 into this discussion aswell, since the PS1 was offering
much much more than even an expanded A1200/CD32 did.

But there also was 386 PCs around, and everything was moving towards 3D
games the previous years already. Remember these games:

Comanche (1992)
Ultima Underworld (1992)
Wolfenstein 3D (1992)
Doom (1993)
Magic Carpet (1994)
Descent (1995)
Duke Nukem 3D (1996)
Tomb Raider (1996)

Some of these games even pre-date the release of the A1200 by years. And
those are only &quot;textured games&quot; examples. There was other 3D games using
flat shading which easily showed much greater performance on PC before,

One problem many of the turbo board designers didn't take serious:
A fast memory is WAY more important than fast CPU calculations for games.

If you are drawing textured polygons, 99% what you do is simply move
bytes from a texture to the framebuffer. The calculation speed does not
matter so much here.

And that's also basically the reason why all 68060 boards for the A1200
suck so bigtime. When you do plain calculations (like raytracing or
fractal stuff) the 68060 is easily faster than a Pentium 1 at the
same clock speed. But once you need to do lot's of memory accesses,
the P1 is several times faster.

But then again CBM and companies like Phase5 weren't alone with their
&quot;we need fast cpu, we dont care for memory speed&quot; philosophy. For
example, the Archimedes also suffered heavily from this problem of
having a fast CPU but not being able to do anything with it due to
slow memory.

It didn't make a whole lot of difference because most 386's only had ISA
slots which impeded throughput anyway. I did a lot of experimentation in the
day and performance was mostly affected by processing speed and memory
subsystem performance.

That changed with the 486 where VL-BUS graphics cards improved performance a
great deal over ISA.

It's both - depending at which particular time slot you look. Amiga

In 1994 the Amiga was quickly aging hardware-wise - although OS-wise it

Sorry - it took several years for meny people to HAVE to go pc boxes. It
would be incredibly stupid to dump a good Amiga in 1993 for a
DOS/Windows 3 pc box with ISA bus.

As to answer the whys above: there was no unique products because the
money earnt on the 64 and the Amigas was spent elsewhere (some people
here may even know at least partially where) but not on the development
of the platform they had in control, where nobody could compete with due
to IPRs.

To sum this up - on one side practically complete lack of marketing
throughout the all Amiga years, including the times when she was a real
killer. On the other hand very limited development of the platform. I
still remember how many F-words we used after the release of A600 when
we were impatiently waiting for another Dave's and Bill's new killer
hardware arch. This in fact led to the situation where in the
mid-nineties there was actually nothing more to market except the OS,
which also started to show its age and ran only on the proprietary
hardware, while at the same time mEHDI and Co. still insisting on
spending maney elsewhere and possibly grabbing as much as they can from
the sinking ship - what result can come out of such situation other than
what actually happened??

So what exactly did Quake innovate other than having true
3D? Let's look at gameplay differences towards Doom:

In Quake you can but you can't in Doom:

- look up and down
- jump over stuff
- have multiple levels over each other
- sloped floors/ceilings

Wow how innovative. Duke Nukem 3D had all of this before
Quake came out, and it did only need a Doom-like engine to
do that stuff.

In fact, DN3D had some things which Quake did not allow.
For example, it could easily modify the entire level while
in Quake/Doom the level was highly static (due to the BSP
tree which didn't allow any changes).
