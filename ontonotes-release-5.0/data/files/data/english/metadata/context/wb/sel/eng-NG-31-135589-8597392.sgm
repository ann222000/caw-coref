The subject says it all -
Does one wait for completion of the external process and
the other not ?

The manual does not comment on the 2 different names for
virtually the same function.

FSPAWN creates a subthread while FSYSTEM starts a new process.

Whether either is asynchronous on an MS OS is OS-dependent I believe.

If want/need control the CreateProcess API directly may be the method of
choice...

The OW forum might elicit more specific responses -- I have used Watcom
extensively in the past, but it is getting to be more and more distant
past.  I found the above from the printed doc's for V11 (altho to best
of my knowledge the same info is what is online, I don't think there's
been much, if any updating of content).

Look at http://www.scitechsoft.com/ftp/watcom/manuals/fuguide.pdf; it
seems like they both wait, and FSPAWN is deprecated for some reason.

You could try an experiment -- output something, call one of those
functions to run a program that just waits 20 seconds and exits, output
something else, and see if there's a 20-second delay between bursts of
output.

The original Microsoft SPAWN and SYSTEM interfaces were written in C
language and so, when an include to these function interfaces was
inserted at the beginning of a program, these fusnctions then became
available if linked with the CEXEC.lib C function library at link
time.

Now &quot;SYSTEM&quot; called DOS services in those early days (still does).
But &quot;SPAWN&quot; had an additional third parameter, (other than path and
application name), to define whether the daughter task should run
independenetly and then stop, or return to the calling program, and if
the two should run together by time-slicing or the parent would wait
tille th daughter task completed (four options).

I am guessing these F-prefixed facilities mentioned are similar, but
different. :o)&gt;
