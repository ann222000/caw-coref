my brake line leaked brake fluid onto a brake pad over the course of a few
days.  Brake line is fixed, *but* should the pad always be questioned after
coming in contact with brake fluid????
thanks!

Yes... brake pads are porous (though the glaze that forms on them reduces
this attribute) and any fluid with little or no surface tension can leech
into the material.

"Back in the day" we could restore life to asbestos linings by heating the
material with a torch... While we could never remove all of the
contamination, the reuslts were quite acceptable for early braking systems.

Now, with the changes in lining materials, swept surface finishes and the
possibility of inappropriate ABS function, I prefer to replace suspect brake
linings... We are, after all, discussing brakes.... If we can't stop safely
the first time, we rarely get a second chance at it....
