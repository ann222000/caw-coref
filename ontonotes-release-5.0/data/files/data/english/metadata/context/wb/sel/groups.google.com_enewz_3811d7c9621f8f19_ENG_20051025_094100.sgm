Earth-shaking tenets, the very essence of Vaasthu

By S BS Surendran

The surface of the earth, according to traditional cosmology, was divided
into two parts, the East and the West on the basis of sunrise and sunset and
into North and South on the basis of the magnetic poles. If you can
visualise a grid encompassing these four points you will get a square, known
as the mandala.

The Earth's tilt on its axis, the flow of magnetic lines that envelope the
surface of the Earth, the effect of sunlight and moonlight collectively, all
have an effect on our existence. One cannot deny the fact that the human
body reacts to environmental factors like wind, water, temperature and
energy lines.

The word 'Vaasthu' is now well known world-wide and along with its growing
popularity, has drawn sceptics and those who pass it off as a mere 'mumbo
jumbo'. Today, there are many who have adopted Vaasthu in their building
constructions and there are scores of consultants offering solutions and
designs as per Vaasthu.

Most often, Vaasthu has been perceived by many as a religious practice. This
is due to the lack of a proper traditional interpretation of the
science-base of technological matter, that one meets with a Vaasthu
treatise. Vaasthu is a technical subject and with a proper understanding of
the interpretations and logical reasoning, many confusions and
contradictions can be overcome.

The word Vaasthu is a Sanskrit word meaning 'Place of dwelling' and
originates from the Vedas. The Principles of Vaasthu have semblance with the
principles of Quantum Physics, emphasising that 'everything vibrates and
pulsates'. It also asserts the notion through Vedic Philosophy, that
'everything is interconnected.&quot;

Vastu

Vaasthu had a great impact in the design of ancient temples and architecture
in early civilisations and its influence is still prevalent in modern times.
Veda meaning knowledge is an essential part of all existence. Vaasthu Shilpa
Shastra originated from the Sthapatya Veda and it deals with Vastu and
Vaasthu, that is energy and matter respectively. Vastu in simple terms also
stands for the materials used for a Vaasthu, that metamorphoses into Vaastu.

The Vaasthu shastras address the energy contained in the Earth as, Vaasthu
Purusha, where purusha means subtle energy that permeates the Earth and
Vaasthu is the material body of the Earth, evolved out of the energy.

Hence Earth energy is considered as embodied energy. All animate objects
including human beings are tied to the Earth, with no scope for escape, and
therefore they should try to live in harmony with its subtle and physical
qualities. Vaasthu science establishes an emotional integration, between man
and the Earth and finally between man and the built-up space. The
integration was therefore felt indispensable for a peaceful life on earth
and in built-up environments.

Past practices

Back in the olden times, there were many unique yet effective methods
adapted by Vaasthu scholars in identifying a suitable place for dwellings,
solely based on the availability of a perennial water resource, quality of
soil to ensure cultivation and levels of the plot to offer protection from
the forces of nature.

Some of the interesting and unique methods adapted were digging of a three
feet deep pit, filling it with water and throwing flowers into it, to
observe the direction in which they move. The movement of the water current
in the clockwise direction was a indication of perennial water.

Smelling the soil, or floating four wicks of light in a plate in the water
inside the pit was a method adopted to understand the toxic nature of the
soil. This helped in deciding the nature of the soil and the quality of
obnoxious gases in and around the site. Lands containing impurities, dead
animal bones, charred wood or charcoal, lignite were all considered impure
and in modern day terminology 'cancerous'.

The fact that Earth must be kept free of 'man made' impurities has been
dealt elaborately in Vaasthu science under the title Bhugarbha and it also
cautions of long term association with bad earth which would be harmful to
the physical and spiritual well being.

Orientation of a building is also an important aspect of building design.
This is a skill which positions the building with respect to the cardinal
directions of the magnetic fields. This concept was arrived at with respect
to the Sun's position to the Earth's movement.

The Sun is directly opposite and closer to the Earth's surface on March 21,
on which day the flow of energy from the Sun to the Earth would be maximum
and, the days and nights equal. From that day on, the Sun moves upwards and
later downward at fixed intervals towards the Northward path (Uttarayana -
upward movement) and the Southward path (dhakshinayana - downward movement).

How it works

The man-made globe used in astronomical laboratories have longitudes and
latitudes. Although these are imaginary lines they are quite significant
from the Vaasthu point of view. The longitudes or dirkha rekha and the
latitudes or aksha rekha, having uniform space between lines and
intersecting each other at right angles, create a kind of energy grid over
the Earth's surface that has great significance.

Accordingly Vaasthu turns layout plans into a grid consisting of 9 x 9 = 81
squares and when such a grid pattern is oriented to the cardinal directions
or is placed parallel to cardinal directions of the Earthly grid, the plan
of the house is said to lie exactly over the Earthly grid. Any distortion,
deviation or deflection of the grid lines of the proposed building-grid from
that of Earth's grid is said to be in disharmony.

When we speak of energy and its influence we need to understand that Earth
itself is swathed with magnetic bands of energy, known as the Van Allen
Belts. These result in many kinds of currents in the atmosphere and ocean
although some of them are governed by poles, gravity and moon phases. People
often say that 'they have free minds and that they can do what they want
to'. In reality these magnetic and cosmic fields have a great influence on
our behaviour patterns.

The human body is akin to a compass and does have its own in-built
biological compass needle. Haemoglobin in the blood cells of every human
body contain, at the center, a trace of iron. We have all observed that when
iron filings are put on a paper and a magnet is placed close to it, the iron
filings move around and follow the magnetic pole. Similarly our body gets
influenced due to the energy emanating from the magnetic belts and
establishes our balance in the energy field surrounding us.

Energy &amp; Equilibrium

The band of magnetic energy would be different at different locations. So,
whenever you move from one location to another, travel long distances or
even move into new premises, you will feel the change. What one needs to
understand is the fact that energy keeps changing constantly and varies not
just due to the environment and interiors of the building, but also due to
other extraneous influences too.

A piece of land without any structure on it allows unhindered flow of energy
through and over the plot. When a structure is put up on a plot we first dig
the earth, put up walls and fix doors, windows etc. This in simple terms
would amount to creating an imbalance in the equilibrium for the movement of
energy in that piece of plot.

Vaasthu or feng shui are tools to restore this imbalance in equilibrium
through proper orientation of the structure, layout, setbacks, placement of
doors and windows, the garden and levels of the plot. In feng shui one goes
a lot more deeper by organising the interiors , the decor, colours, lights
etc thereby help channelise the energy into the building more effectively.
Adopting Vaasthu or feng shui provides one, a space that is comfortable and
supportive with an unhindered flow of energy, creating a perfectly balanced
environment that ensures enhanced wealth, health and prosperity.
