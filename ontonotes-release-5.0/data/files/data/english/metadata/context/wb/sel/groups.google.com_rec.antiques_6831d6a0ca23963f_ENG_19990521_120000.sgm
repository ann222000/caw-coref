I am battling to find books on Royal Doulton Lambeth and Stoneware
with reference to backstamp dates. And in particular teapots. Any
assistance would be appreciated. Are there any good agents in the
north of England who specalise in Lambeth ware. I have recently
purchased a small bowl and the back stamp does not show the crown, but
the assistant told me that it was dated 1905. I would have thought
without the crown it would have been before this date ?

My son bought a small teapot in Liverpool for Â£120 which I believe to
be quite a rare find. It is quite small and of a dark green glaze,
with small daisies on it, in perfect condition.

"/> In 1901 the company was authorized by King Edward VII to market its
products as Royal Doulton, the royal mark appeared in 1902. The
Lambeth works closed in 1956, while the Burslem works continued.

For marks, 'Encyclopaedia of British Pottery and Porcelain Marks' by
G.A. Godden, 1964 ... commonly known as the &quot;Bible&quot; If you search this
for example ...  http://800go.com/800go.html  .. you should turn up all
you need on Doulton.

"/> De-lurking to Thank Ronnie . .

Thank you for the mention of the &quot;Bible&quot; Ronnie. I read this thread
early Saturday morning and on Saturday afternoon I spotted the book in
an antique store just round the corner from my house! The owner
wanted $30 CDN (that's just under 13 UKP) and a pleasant chat followed
during which he told me he didn,t know much about the Internet but a
friend of his had just put and item on E-Bay for him.

I have spent an instuctive Saturday evening checking the marks on my
English china. I did find most of them but I am left with two
puzzles.

I could not find any match for the mark on the bottom of an old beaker
advertising Ovaltine and made in England. The mark looks like an AW
combined. Could be some other letter instead of A but it is definitely
a W. Does anyone know the answer? These Ovaltine beakers are not
uncommon I have seen others.

Also I have a blue and white plate with a version of the pattern with
the basket of flowers in the centre (an antecedent of the well known
blue and white plate found at Jefferson's home Montecello, and which
is reproduced for the tourists)

The word Delph appears on the reverse of my plate with Wood &amp; Sons. I
am assuming Delph is the pattern name. Godden says Wood &amp; Sons
appeared after 1907 (previously only one son) however there is no
England mark which Godden states was required after 1891. Was the
mark only required if the china was for domestic and export markets? I
bought the plate in the UK.

Any suggestions or insight into the above questions would be
appreciated.

BTW If anyone else is now looking for their own second-hand copy of
Godden it is a large fat book with a bright yellow dust jacket (if it
still has a dust jacket) so it was quite easy to spot.

"/> Hey, Libby, 13 quid sounds like a good deal to me, if it's the big
full blown version ... you ripped that poor guy off. ;-)))

Sorry I can't input on the other questions, maybe Charleen or Jane can
help, or someone else.

Never worry, one good deal a day sweet Jesus ... eh wot! :&gt;)

Another book to look for is Godden's Guide to European Porcelain, Cross River
Press, 1993. This book gives wonderful information on 19th century
porcelains and illustrates with both black and white and color photographs of
porcelain and some marks. Very important is it shows photographs of
reproductions of Meissen, Sevres, and Chelsea porcelains. An entire chapter is
devoted to fakes, forgeries, and reproductions.
