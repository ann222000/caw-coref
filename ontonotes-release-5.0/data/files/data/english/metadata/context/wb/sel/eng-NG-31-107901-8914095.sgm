THE RELIGION OF THE WEST

You, who are now reading these lines, and I are strangers. I have no
means of knowing whether you are a Christian or an atheist. That,
however, will not matter, so long as we talk about facts and not
wishes.

The observed and verifiable facts of the world about us are not
affected by religious faith or the lack of faith. Christians and
atheists must find themselves in perfect agreement when they affirm
that lead is more malleable than steel, that the earth is an oblate
spheroid rotating on its axis, that whales are mammals, that Germany
was defeated and devastated by the many nations allied against her in
1945, and that the Chinese are Mongolians. About such matters there
can be no dispute among Western men, who instinctively accept the
reality of the world about us and cannot believe, as do many
Orientals, that it is merely an illusion in the mind of a dreamer.

If we would salvage and restore our civilization-the Occidental
culture that is peculiarly our own and that now seems to be
disintegrating and rotting before our very eyes-we must do so as
Western men, by observing reality objectively and by reasoning from it
dispassionately. And when we try to compute what resources remain to
us, we need first of all to determine the actual strength of the
Christian tradition at the present time.

It is a fact, which Christians will regard with satisfaction and some
atheists may deplore, that Western civilization, for about half of its
recorded history, has been a Christian civilization in the sense that
the great majority of the people belonging to it (though never, at any
time, all of them) believed implicitly in the truth of the Christian
revelation. That religious unanimity was for a long time so nearly
complete that, after the fall of the Roman Empire and the evanescence
of hopes for its restoration, we of the West regarded our religion as
the bond that united us and distinguished us from the rest of the
human species. During the Middle Ages, our ancestors occupied the
greater part of Europe, and, until they discovered the American
continents, they lived only in Europe, but despite that geographical
unity, they did not generally refer to themselves as the Europeans.
For all practical purposes, furthermore, our ancestors belonged to the
same division of the white race: they, like the true Greeks and the
true Romans before them, were all members of the great race that we
now call Indo-European or Aryan, but they had in their languages no
word to designate their blood relationship and biological unity. Thus,
when they referred to the unity of which they were always conscious as
something transcending the constantly shifting territorial and
political divisions of Europe, they called themselves Christendom. And
for many centuries that word was adequate and misled no one.

For many centuries the West was Christendom and its civilization was
indubitably Christian: that, whether you like it or not, is an
historical fact. There is a complementary historical fact that was
less obvious at the time and that even thoughtful men overlooked or
tried to ignore until the events of the past two decades made it
indubitable: Christianity is a religion of the West, and, for all
practical purposes, only of the West. It is not, as its polemical
adversaries so often charge, a Semitic cult, for it has never
commanded the adhesion of any considerable number of Semites, and it
is not, as Christians once generally believed, a universal religion,
for experience has proved that it cannot be successfully exported to
populations that are not Indo-European.

Experience has also proved that it does not do the slightest good to
deny ascertained facts. The men of Classical antiquity knew, of
course, that the earth is spherical, and Eratosthenes in the third
century B.C. calculated its circumference as 24,663 miles. But the
early Fathers of the Church, living in the age of growing ignorance
that shrouded the last century of the Roman Empire, decided, on the
basis of some statements in the Old Testament, that the earth ought to
be flat or, at least, no more curved than a shield. Lactantius was the
most eloquent and probably, therefore, the most influential of the
many who assiduously demanded that the earth be flat and so imposed on
their contemporaries the conviction that it was. In the Middle Ages,
to be sure, there were some learned men, such as Buridan, who knew
that the globe is a globe, but they, like learned men today, who all
know very well that talk about the equality of races is utter
nonsense, usually refrained from publicly denouncing fashionable
delusions. It was not until the Fifteenth Century that the truth
became again inescapable, but when it did, the Christians, being men
of the West, who do not deny the lessons of experience, surrendered
the comfortable error in which they had once generally believed; and
since that time, no rational Christian has doubted that the earth is
spherical.

Today, as in the Fifteenth Century, Western men have had to discard a
congenial assumption to bring their conception of the world into
conformity with observed reality. So long as we of the West held
unquestioned dominion over the whole earth, we permitted ourselves to
assume that our civilization in general, and our religion in
particular, could be exported and made universal. We did not
sufficiently observed that talent for mimicry is common to all human
beings and indeed to all anthropoids; that all human beings stand in
awe of those who have power over them; and that a genius for
dissimulation and hypocrisy is hereditary in the most intelligent
Orientals. Even with these oversights, the evidence against our
assumption was fairly clear, but in the pride of our power we felt
that we could indulge an assumption that was so congenial to the
romantic generosity that is a peculiarity of our race. But the events
of half a century, and especially of the last two decades, have shown
us, beyond peradventure of doubt, the shape of the world in which we
live. We now know what our prolonged missionary effort, cultural as
well as religious, accomplished-and how its visible effects were
produced.

When Cortés and his small but valiant band of iron men conquered the
teeming empire of the Aztecs, he was immediately followed by a train
of earnest missionaries, chiefly Franciscans, who began to preach the
Gospel to the natives and soon sent home, with naïve enthusiasm,
glowing accounts of the conversions they had effected. Their pious
sincerity and innocent joy still lives in the pages of Father Sahagun,
Father Torquemada, and many others. For their sake I am glad that the
poor Franciscans never suspected how small a part they played in the
religious conversions that gave them such happiness. Far, far more
persuasive than their sermons and their book had been the Spanish
cannon that breached and shattered the Aztec defenses, and the
ruthless Spanish soldiers who slew the Aztec priests at their own
altars and toppled the Aztec idols from the sacrificial pyramids. The
Aztecs, Tepanecs, and other natives accepted Christianity, not because
their hearts were touched by alien and incomprehensible doctrines of
love and mercy, but because it was the religion of the white men whose
bronze cannon and mail-clad warriors were invincible.

That was early in the Sixteenth Century and even then there were not
wanting indications that should have given pause to a critical mind,
but we of the West went on repeating that fond mistake for four
centuries, as the missionaries whom we sent to all parts of the world
wrote home glowing reports of the number of &quot;hearts&quot; they had &quot;won for
Christ.&quot; It was only after our enemies' campaign of &quot;anti-colonialism&quot;
really got under way that most of us realized that what had won all
those hearts was primarily the discipline of British regiments and the
manifest power of the white man.

We now know what happened. On many a shore of Africa, for example,
missionaries eager to &quot;win souls for Christ&quot; ventured to land alone,
and the aborigines, after mutilating and torturing them for a good
communal laugh, ate them, cooked or raw according to the custom of the
local cuisine. Usually, a few weeks or a few months later, a British
cruiser hove to off shore and lobbed half a dozen 4.5 shells into the
native village, and, if not pressed for time, landed half a company of
marines to beat the bushes and drag out a dozen or so savages to hang
on convenient trees. Consequently the tribe, if not very obtuse, took
the hint and respected the next bevy of missionaries as somehow
representing the god of thunder and lightning. And if the men of God
distributed enough free rice and medical care with their sermons, they
were able to make &quot;converts,&quot; as the natives learned to utter the
words that Christians like to hear.

That is, in essence, the whole history of &quot;winning souls&quot; among the
savages. There were, of course, many local variations. If the first
missionaries were preceded by troops or white settlers, the blacks had
already been convinced of the virtues of Christian rifles and had
learned that white men should not be regarded as esculent comestibles.
It often happened, however, that the natives, even after many years of
preaching and conversion, rejected the white man's odd rites very
emphatically, and a fresh supply of missionaries was needed. In 1905,
for example, the Maji-Maji conspiracy in Tanganyika murdered all the
missionaries and almost all

Although he is right in denouncing Covington as a menace, the author, whoever he is, is, or professes to be, a superstitious fool. Satan is as mythical as his counterpart, Yahweh-Jesus, and as impotent to do anything for the fools who believe in him and the occult rubbish that goes with the myth. He is also so stupid that he imagines that the authors of fiction believe what they right about. I never met Lovecraft, but I exchanged two or three letters with him, corresponded with August Derleth and had some personal acquaintance with Robert Howard, both of whom were Lovecraft's close friends. He was an atheist. No man who writes brilliantly about the supernatural can believe in it. A talented believer could, no doubt, match Lovecraft's English prose, but he could not show the originality of plausible plots and characterization. I seem to remember that Lovecraft said so in the little book in which he surveyed historically the writing of &quot;supernatural horror&quot; in English literature.&quot;&lt;&lt;- RP Oliver, 1994.

Hey Bret,

Keep that &quot;private&quot; correspondence private.  Or better yet, start your own
blog somewhere else.

This stuff doesn't belong on R.A.T.   You and Andre have shit the bed, and I
am beginning to agree with Sander . . .  It's time to move on.

Bret, why not try your luck on R.A.O?  That cesspool is full of fools
spouting foolish, egotistical crap.   I think you'd be looked up to there .
. . you could certainly make &quot;meaningful&quot; contributions in the style of
Arnie or Middius . . .

And if you go there, take your asshole buddy Andre with you.

Jon

It wasn't with me.

We have gotten off the subject. Why don't you post some good stuff.
maybe why you went to all that effort just to build what is still a
stinky ole ST70, with the subpar transformers? And use a tube rectfier
which is actually an impediment to sound most of the time? Surely the
EL34s can stand another 50-60 volts B+?

I'll bet you kept the stupid old Biaset resistor too.

I know how you feel about Dyna iron, and frankly, I am surprised that you
held your tongue this long.  Admittedly, the trannies aren't the world's
best, but they aren't the worst by any means.

The ST70 was a hobby project.  I wanted to get everything that the amp was
capable of - to &quot;hot rod&quot; it.   I'm sure you think this the equivalent of
hot-rodding a Pinto . . . .  and maybe it is.

You are someone who gets pleasure out of hot-rodding transmission pans,
toasters, ashtrays, etc.  Personally, I feel that installing good iron and
tubes on top of something that is going to look like shit (but maybe sound
good) when you are done is kinda foolish.  At the end of the day I might
have something that someone else might want to own.  Different aesthetics;
different values.

In that same vein I really admired Fred Nachbaur's efforts to make the
lowest cost amplifier(s) using available parts.  His goal was not trying to
make the best-sound amp.  Great sounding and low cost are hard to achieve
together.

The B+ on the ST-70 is pretty high.  Yes, the 6CA7s could take a higher B+,
but the caps are limited to about 500 volts. I don't think the possible
benefits are worth the risks, or the trouble.

I tried a Weber &quot;Coppertop&quot; 5AR4 replacement vs. a glass 5AR4.  The Weber
product has a dropping resistor to keep the B+ in line.  Each one sounded
different, i.e. It seemed like there was more available bass with the SS
rectifier.  But sonically, I liked the 5AR4, and I also like the slow
warm-up of a real 5AR4 'cause those Mullard tubes are valuable.

No, I didn't keep the original bias-set resistors.  Welbourne has a
zener-regulated circuit that has a multi-turn trimpot that does a nice job
of dialing in the bias.

The bottom line is that my ST-70 sounds great.  I'll post some pics when I
get a minute.  Why don't you do the same re: one of your &quot;Power Glide&quot;
amplifiers.  Or would that be &quot;Astro Glide&quot;?
