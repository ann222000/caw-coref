Hi all,
I am one of the &quot;unlucky&quot; guy having bought a notebook carrying win
vista installed. I have installed slackware since version 8.0 and this
is the first time having this kind of problem. Basically, the
installation goes fine until the installation of lilo on the mbr.
Afterthat, linux boot normally but vista does not. Gooogling around it
seems that the new microsoft product does not like write the mbr.
People is suggesting to write lilo in the root dir and then use
easybcd software in order to manage both OS. Friends of mine did not
have problem with ubuntu with another notebook but ubuntu uses grub.
Any help in order to use lilo on mbr along with vista?
Thanks in advance,

spirix

I am not using vista. But you should be a little more verbose. What's
your /etc/lilo.conf? what happens when you run lilo and what happens
exactly when you try to boot Vista?

If you say that it works with grub and Ubuntu; I guess the problem is
not that Vista does like change to the mbr (because grub do the same).
(it is possible to install lilo on the root partition and make this
partition active; provided the mbr is the standard one).

You can use grub on Slackware (it is present in extra, and there is even
a configuration utility). You can try to see how it is configured on
Ubuntu and do the same for Slackware.

Good to know: you can uninstall lilo and put a standard mbr with the
command:
lilo -M /dev/hda mbr
(where /dev/hda denote your main disk, it could also be /dev/sda).

You can install grub, its in &quot;extra&quot; packages.

I *think* that Vista boots like XP, add an entry similar to XP.

no help to offer, but i can say that my work machine has vista, and
(although i'm having trouble installing slack 12.0), i've been able to
install slackware 11 with the 2.4 kernel and lilo in the mbr, and vista
still boots.

so it's probably not vista that's causing the problem, or at least not
vista alone. but in order for anyone here to be able to help you, you'll
need to tell us a bit more. what is your lilo.conf, what is your disk
configuration (e.g. provide the output of fdisk -l), what happens when you
try to boot vista, etc.

Hi all,
thanks for the hints.  Basically, I have parted my sda by using
gparted live (great tool) and installed slacware on the sda3 partion
(sda1 is recovery and sda2 is vista).  Then I have added the vista
mount in the fstab (done automatically by slackware during the
installation) and installed lilo on the mbr as usual using the
standard options. I rebooted and slackware was running. The next
reboot, I tried vista *but* it could not boot for some reason. I
thought that the problem was lilo so I *fixed* the mbr cleaning it by
using vista tool. No solution. So I recovered vista by the recovery
partition. I rebooted by dvd mounting the sda3 in order to read the
previous dmesg and I noticed some serious problem about ntfs
filesystem mounting.
so what I have done is to remove the mount for vista in fstab at the
boot and re-installed lilo in the mbr by lilo -v. no error at all
(only warning about lba32). surprisingly, this time vista was booting
in perfect agreement with your opinion. So, the problem was at the
first linux-boot  mounting the vista partion, probably corrupting the
ntfs-vista filesystem (I guess). so the problem was not lilo but the
mount of vista. I don't why.

A silly question: I have 2Gb of ram. Do I need to create a swap of 2Gb
or 1Gb it is enough? Thinking about the hybernation issue ...

Thanks to all,

Regards

the safe way is to have swap bigger at least 1 byte than ram,
on the other hand,
if you don't worry about crashes, with 2gb of ram
512mb are sufficent

I just bought a new computer a couple months ago with Vista - no issues
at all dual booting with SW 12.0.  I didn't do anything different from when
I used to have Win95 on the 'puter way back when.  I used the MBR with
Lilo.

The only hard part was splitting the hard drive.  Even though Vista comes
with a built in repartitioning capability, the OS likes to plop all sorts of
unmoveable crap at the very end of my 300 GB drive.  I had to use a special
defrag program to move it.

Hi,

I bet it is more hardware related, or at leat I had similar problems with
XP. If this os what i think, your help would be &quot;man lilo.conf&quot; and
&quot;boot-as&quot; option.

Hope it will help

take care

The &quot;boot-as&quot; was very convenient on DOS based OS's. The NT variants
don't need this help.

I fing ity a lot easier to install lilo on the root when I have a
combination of MS and various distros.

Smart Boot Manager works great or you can even add Slack to NTLDR by
first installing lilo on the root. In my case Slack11 is /dev/hde17.

From...

http://jaeger.morpheus.net/linux/ntldr.php

You might have to use a live CD or a SBM floppy.

chdir to a convenient spot. Issue...

dd if=/dev/hde17 of=bootsect.lnx bs=512 count=1

Copy the file bootsect.lnx to the root of 2000 or XP.

Add this line to the bottom of c:\boot.ini and not it loos like...

[boot loader]
timeout=15
default=multi(0)disk(0)rdisk(0)partition(1)\WINDOWS
[operating systems]
multi(0)disk(0)rdisk(0)partition(1)\WINDOWS=&quot;Microsoft Windows 2000 Professional&quot; /fastdetect
C:\=MS-DOS
C:\bootsect.lnx=&quot;Slack11&quot;

Now you can boot Slack using NTLDR and lilo never sees the MBR.

You are wrong which proves my two week ago experience with Win XP. Anyway
the box had two physical disks with Xp on hdb and XP had problems with
booting while Slackware and lilo was installed on hda.

If you read man you would know it is BIOS and how it presents disks
problem.

I would suspect XP (Xrta Problems). If it was installed on primary drive
and later relegated to secondary position.
The reading of man pages I did few years ago when playing with lilo to
boot (on two hard drives) few installs of DOS'es (MS; DR and free all
with win3.11) and Windows98's (English; Hebrew and Greek)
Lilo did it's work including hiding and unhiding partitions according to
menu choices.
It was a challenge resulting from reading the man pages suggesting that
it &quot;can be done!&quot;
So it did it.

What happens when you try to boot Vista?

I have a Dell Inspiron booting both Vista (which came pre-installed with
the machine) and Slackware 12 with lilo as the bootloader installed on
MBR without any issues.
