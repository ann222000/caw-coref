Some days ago I have post a question about this topic, but due to the fact
that I did not make the question clear enough in that post I did not get
much input except Mac User suggested me to read more about experimental
design to get a fundamental understanding.

I have a very general idea about experimental design before but did not
understand the some principles of it. I spent few days read more books and
try to learn the basics of it and found that is not a task can be finished
in few days.

But I am short in time and my experiment is waiting for this design file
anxiously.

So I 'd like to put my question in this group again and in some details so
that some one might help.

Problem:

I have 8 variables, among them 4 are ordinal(can be thought as factors too)
and 4 factor variables, with levels 2x3x3x3x4x4x4x4. I am interested to
measure all main effects and 3 interactions between variable V1:v2, V5:V6
and variable V7:V8.

I have a design table(J.E.B.M Steenkamp,?) at hand which I can look up for
pre-constructed plans for profiles but I did not find the particular
combination of my variables. So I turned to use software that can generate
design files such as
spss(which gives only main effect design, of what I know), statgraphics and
AlgDesign package in R. Based on some search in forums, I inclined to draw
the conclusion that  there maybe no small enough fractional factorial design
for this variable combination.

Question:

1. I 'd like to know if there exists such a fractional factorial design can
measure those effects and how to find/generate it?
2. If there is not such design, what would be the work around, change the
variables' levels to fit the table or turn to a piece of software to
calculate a FF or optimal design?
3. if I use a optimal design, is there a rule of thumb to decide under what
efficiency that a design can be safely applied in practice?
4. I tried R to generate optimal designs, with D-efficiency of 0.49 and
G-effi 0.59 for 64 profiles, D-effi 0.80 and G-effi 0.82 for 128 profiles,
how do I check whether this design is able to measure the effects that I am
interested in? And is 0.5/0.8 D-efficiency sufficient in practice use?

I hope this somehow gives more information about my question, if further
elaboration needed, I will provide more details.

Thanks in advance. And nice weekend.

I don't think your use of &quot;ordinal&quot; and &quot;factor&quot; are correct. All 8
are factors. 4 are ordinal, meaning the other four are either nominal
or continuous.

The three variables with 3 levels can be fractionated. The four
variables at 4 levels can be fractionated independently of the
fraction chose for the 3 levels.

So, create a fraction of the 3x3x3. Combine this with a fraction of
the 4x4x4x4. Combine this with a 2 level variable. I do not know if
the software you mention can produce fractions of a 4x4x4x4; I believe
SAS can create this fraction but I haven't actually tried.

Changing variables is one solution. Accepting a design that is not
orthogonal is another solution.

You can compare the optimal design to an orthogonal design. As far as
rules of thumb, I am not aware of any. Someone please jump in if there
is one. I am skeptical of rules of thumb anyone, they purport to apply
everywhere, when in fact they cannot be universally applicable, in my
opinion.

Some software will report the correlation between the estimates. At
that point, you have to decide if that correlation is too high for
your purposes or not.

I am not quite clear here. First, combine means outter product/combinatory
combination here? and if I make fraction for 3x3x3 and 4x4x4x4 seperately
and combine them later, can I still keep those interactions estimatable?

From the table I have, 4^4 fraction can be 64 treatments with 3 interactions
and all main effects estimatable and 3^3 either 9 treatments with only main
effects or 27 treatments with all interactions. One interaction I am
interested in is c1:v2  which are 2 and 3 levels accordingly.

the final design will be too big 2x9(27)x64 treatments, and doesn't futher
dividing it into blocks will comfound some effects(I want to keep
interactions) with blocks?  I am not sure if I understand this correctly.

You don't get anything for free. Yes, dividing it into blocks will

Personally, I don't have any qualms about creating a non-orthogonal
experiment if there are no other choices, especially if you can find a
design that is close to orthogonal. Nevertheless, with proper
statistical care, a non-orthogonal design is still a useful design.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

I believe the software that I use (SAS) computes an &quot;efficiency&quot;
number for the design that compare the design to an orthogonal design.
That way, you can see how close your optimal design is to the
orthogonal design. Of course, the scale is non-intuitive for me (and
I'm guessing for most people), meaning I know an efficiency of 100 is
perfect (that's orthogonal), but just how bad is a design with an
efficiency of 90? That's where judgment comes in, plus you can request
the software to show the correlations between the predictors, and you
can examine these correlations to see if any correlations between
predictors are &quot;too high&quot; (again a judgment call).

The bottom line is many experiments is that you have to create a
design that gives you the statistical benefits you want and isn't so
big that you can't run it. Usually, you compromise, and many time, the
size of the design is the deciding factor that makes you give up some
of the statistical benefits you were hoping for.

&gt; the software to show the correlations between the predictors, and you
&gt; can examine these correlations to see if any correlations between
&gt; predictors are &quot;too high&quot; (again a judgment call).

&gt; The bottom line is many experiments is that you have to create a
&gt; design that gives you the statistical benefits you want and isn't so
&gt; big that you can't run it. Usually, you compromise, and many time, the
&gt; size of the design is the deciding factor that makes you give up some
&gt; of the statistical benefits you were hoping for.

Thanks very much for your comments and suggestions, Paige, it is of enormous
help for me.
I searched in some text books trying to find a quick answer about making
such kind of decision (trade offs) but finding no much useful information in
this respect.

One more question about the general idea in designs, if I have to use
non-orthogonal design generated by SAS or R/AlgDesign,  I can either

1.  choose to use a design with large number of profiles and high
D-efficiency, and blocking into many small blocks later, e.g. 128 profiles
with D-effi = 0.8 (8 variables, 2x3x3x3x4x4x4x4)
or

2. choose a design with relatively small number of  profiles but
lower(comparitive)  D-efficiecy, which can use less blocks,( more replicates
under same sample size). e.g. 64 profiles with Dea = 0.5 (8 vars as above)

which choice would be better?

If I were you, I would like to think carefully the purpose of this
experiment.  For example, I'll priotize the effects that your customer
(or boss) would like to know definitely (certainly, the main effects),
effects that could be beneficial but not necessary, etc.

I sense that your question is beyond the statistical efficiency.

Hope this helps.

&gt; &gt;&gt; I am not quite clear here. First, combine means outter
&gt; &gt;&gt; product/combinatory
&gt; &gt;&gt; combination here? and if I make fraction for 3x3x3 and 4x4x4x4 seperately
&gt; &gt;&gt; and combine them later, can I still keep those interactions estimatable?

&gt; &gt; Outer product, yes. (Also called Cartesian join)

&gt; &gt;&gt; From the table I have, 4^4 fraction can be 64 treatments with 3
&gt; &gt;&gt; interactions
&gt; &gt;&gt; and all main effects estimatable and 3^3 either 9 treatments with only
&gt; &gt;&gt; main
&gt; &gt;&gt; effects or 27 treatments with all interactions. One interaction I am
&gt; &gt;&gt; interested in is c1:v2  which are 2 and 3 levels accordingly.

&gt; &gt; When you combine fractions of 3x3x3 with fractions of 4x4x4x4, any
&gt; &gt; interaction between a three-level variable and a 4-level variable is
&gt; &gt; estimable. When you combine one 2 level variable with a fraction of
&gt; &gt; the 3x3x3, the interaction between the two-level variable and any
&gt; &gt; three-level variable is estimable.

&gt; &gt;&gt; the final design will be too big 2x9(27)x64 treatments, and doesn't
&gt; &gt;&gt; futher
&gt; &gt;&gt; dividing it into blocks will comfound some effects(I want to keep
&gt; &gt;&gt; interactions) with blocks?  I am not sure if I understand this correctly.

&gt; &gt; You don't get anything for free. Yes, dividing it into blocks will
&gt; &gt; cause you to lose interactions. Sad, but true. You may be able to find
&gt; &gt; a way to block the experiment further without confounding the
&gt; &gt; interactions you are interested in estimate; you may not be able to
&gt; &gt; find such a blocking.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Changing variables is one solution. Accepting a design that is not
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; orthogonal is another solution.

&gt; &gt;&gt; this is really hard to decide.

&gt; &gt; Personally, I don't have any qualms about creating a non-orthogonal
&gt; &gt; experiment if there are no other choices, especially if you can find a
&gt; &gt; design that is close to orthogonal. Nevertheless, with proper
&gt; &gt; statistical care, a non-orthogonal design is still a useful design.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; You can compare the optimal design to an orthogonal design. As far as

&gt; &gt;&gt; compare to a full factorial design?

&gt; &gt; I believe the software that I use (SAS) computes an &quot;efficiency&quot;
&gt; &gt; number for the design that compare the design to an orthogonal design.
&gt; &gt; That way, you can see how close your optimal design is to the
&gt; &gt; orthogonal design. Of course, the scale is non-intuitive for me (and
&gt; &gt; I'm guessing for most people), meaning I know an efficiency of 100 is
&gt; &gt; perfect (that's orthogonal), but just how bad is a design with an
&gt; &gt; efficiency of 90? That's where judgment comes in, plus you can request
&gt; &gt; the software to show the correlations between the predictors, and you
&gt; &gt; can examine these correlations to see if any correlations between
&gt; &gt; predictors are &quot;too high&quot; (again a judgment call).

Only you can make the tradeoffs here. I can't know your situation as
well as you do.

Thanks for the input. Sure it is a bit off topic now. The situation is
simply that I can not find a good solution to satisfy all the requirements,
I have to accept one of those designs with either big number of
profiles(high efficiency), or small number of profiles with low efficiency,
or a very huge orthogonal design(which has been almost ruled out now). It is
more about aquiring some practical experience of others who have done such
cases before to give some hints about the strategies of dealing this kind of
trade offs.

Thanks again Sangdon and Paige for your patience. I am going to take a final
look at the generated design and make up my mind and cross my fingers.

Kind regards,
Sun

I just read a paper from Kuhfeld in Journal of marketing research with title
&quot;efficient experimental design with marketing research applications&quot;, 1994.
It tackled many aspects of strategies of choosing a particular design under
your requirement. Truly helpful. Thanks for the link.
