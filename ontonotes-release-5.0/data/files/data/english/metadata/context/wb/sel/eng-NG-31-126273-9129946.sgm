Subject: THE MASONS SEPARATE THEMSELVES FROM THE ILLUMINATI
Title: The New World Order Files
Author: David Allen Rivera

In 1826, Captain William Morgan, a journalist and stonemason from
Batavia, New York, who was a high degree mason in a local Masonic lodge,
wrote an expose' of the Masonic Order in a book called _Illustrations of
Masonry_, which revealed many of their secrets concerning the first
three degrees. Shortly afterward, he was arrested and charged with
stealing and indebtedness, and put in jail. The Illuminati tried him in
absentia, convicted him of treason, and ordered five men, led by Richard
Howard, an English Illuminist, to execute him. When he was released from
jail, he was warned about the plot, and he attempted to flee to Canada.
Howard caught him at the border, and took him to Fort Niagara, where he
was held for a couple of days. The Freemasons that accompanied Howard,
carried him off in a boat, and drowned him in the Niagara River.

This event was verified by the sworn statement of Avery Allen (said to
be on file at the New York City Archives), who heard Howard give a
report of the incident at a meeting of the Knights Templar at St. John's
Hall in New York City. One of the three men who carried out the
assassination, confessed on his deathbed in 1848.

Masonic leaders refused to cooperate with the lengthy investigation,
which didn't get anywhere, since many of the police officers were
Masons. The general consensus was that Morgan drowned himself in Lake
Ontario. However, the press, religious leaders, temperance and
anti-slavery groups, united to condemn the apparent murder. The murder
caused over half of the Masons in the northeastern United States to
break off their alignment with the Illuminati. The incident led to the
creation of the country's first third party movement, the Anti-Masonic
Party (1826-33) in New York. They wanted to stop the aristocratic
conspiracy, and prevent all members of Masonic organizations from public
service. Anti-Masonic candidates were elected to the New York Assembly
in 1827.

A State Convention in Massachusetts in 1828 saw the establishment of a
committee &quot;to inquire how far Freemasonry and French Illuminism are
connected.&quot; The Committee reported at a meeting at Faneuil Hall in
Boston (December 30, 31, and January 1, 1829), and passed the following
resolution: &quot;Resolved, on the report of the Committee appointed to
inquire how far Freemasonry and French Illuminism are connected, that
there is evidence of an intimate connection between the high orders of
Masonry and French Illuminism.&quot;

A National Convention was held in 1830 in Philadelphia, and another in
Baltimore in 1831, where they nominated William Wirt, former U.S.
Attorney General (under Monroe and John Quincy Adams, 1817-1829), as a
Presidential candidate. They were represented by 116 Anti-Masonic
delegates from 13 states. The movement caught on mainly in New England
and the Mid-Atlantic states. Even though they won quite a few
Congressional seats in 1832, Wirt only carried the State of Vermont,
while Andrew Jackson, a Mason, won big.

The Party was phased out in 1836, because the anti-slavery movement
began to overshadow their activities. They merged with the Whig Party
(1834-60) in 1838. The Whig Party later assimilated themselves into the
Democratic Party, the Liberty Party (1840-48),/ /the Free Soil Party
(1848-54),/ /and the Republican Party.

Fifty years after Morgan's disappearance, Thurlow Weed (1797-1882),
owner of the _Rochester Telegraph_, and Editor of the influential
_Albany Evening Journal_ (from 1830-1863), who helped found the
Anti-Masonic Party, published information about Morgan's death. His
grave was discovered in 1881 at Pembroke, in Batavia County, in New
York. In the grave was a piece of paper that had the name John Brown
written on it. Brown was said to be one of the people involved in the
killing. A statue was erected in memory of Morgan in Batavia in 1882.
