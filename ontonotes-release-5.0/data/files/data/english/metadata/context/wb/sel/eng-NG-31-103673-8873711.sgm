The key to extraordinary muscle growth is inhibiting the gene that expresses
myostatin, which blocks the growth of skeletal muscle. And now there's a
race among a group of drug developers to bring a new therapy to market that
can do just that--helping people who suffer from muscle loss for a broad
range of reasons, including aging and muscular dystrophy. Wyeth

Cambridge, MA. Acceleron has made headlines for its work with the Belgian

e/2007-07-16?utm_medium=nl&amp;utm_source=internal].

The science in these new programs dates to a discovery by Se-Jin Lee at
Johns Hopkins that muscle-bound mice lacked the myostatin gene. Since then,
other proteins have been linked to the same process, and Acceleron is
advancing a fusion molecule that apparently works on more than one level in
blocking the body's natural obstacles to muscle growth. In animal studies
completed by Acceleron, mice injected with the fusion molecule experienced
muscle growth of 30 percent to 60 percent.

Scientists at Manchester University have grown new peripheral nerves by
using stem cells extracted from fat, and they are suggesting that the new
therapy may be available to patients in as little as four years. Their study
in Experimental Neurology demonstrates how the researchers took fat cells
from rats and coaxed them to develop into nerve cells, or neurons. Now they
plan to duplicate the experiment in humans, using a biodegradable sheath for
the new nerve. The scientists say that the approach is particularly
promising for people with damaged nerves in the arms or legs. In the UK, the
therapy could apply to one in every 50,000 residents.

%2Dused%2Das%2Dnonhormonal%2Dcontraceptive%2F2007%2D10%2D23]

A group of researchers at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston are focused
on developing a new, nonhormonal contraceptive that uses RNAi technology to
silence the ZP3 gene, which is required to fertilize an egg during
ovulation. As the new therapy would only act on the most developed eggs, it
would theoretically have no affect on other eggs, which could be used later
for fertilization. The advantage would be an end to the kind of often harsh
side effects some women suffer from contraceptives, including higher blood
pressure. The team of scientists are working now to bring up the efficiency
of the contraceptive to 100 percent, and expect to use a patch or vaginal
suppository in order to skirt stomach acids.

&quot;What we are trying to do is to think about contraception in a new way.
Obviously there are going to be big hurdles and it is going to take a lot of
time, but the need is there and we think it can be achieved. Using RNAi to
target ZP3 is attractive because the gene is active only in growing eggs,&quot;
researcher Zev Williams told The Times of London.

Gene mutations in the A beta protein are assisting these proteins in
clumping together, which in turn is promoting Alzheimer's, according to a
scientific team at UCLA. The researchers say that a new drug that can block
the formation of A beta and prevent it from sticking together in clumps
could prevent the disease from ever occurring. And their work may help
developers take the right approach. The principal investigator is David
Teplow, professor of neurology at the David Geffen School of Medicine at
UCLA. The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences published the
findings in its Oct. 10 online early edition.

controlling%2Dstress%2F2007%2D10%2D23]

A molecular mechanism at work during periods of stress may shed light on
developing new therapies for post-traumatic stress disorder and other
conditions. Researchers at UT Southwestern Medical Center say that mice
which are vulnerable to stress experience an increase of nerve activity that
requires dopamine. Less vulnerable mice express molecules that prevent the
release of dopamine. The challenge will be developing new therapies without
injuring the patient, which benefits from dopamine in one part of the brain
while being injured by it in another.
