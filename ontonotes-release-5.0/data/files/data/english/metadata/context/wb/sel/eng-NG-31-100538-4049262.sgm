Hi.

If a front caliper is seized "on" on the front passenger side, would car pull to that side or to the drivers side?

Cheers, TIA

It'll pull to the passenger side, remember that it'll also pull that way
because of the camber on the road in the UK. The best way to diagnose a
sticking caliper is to check the wheel temperatures after a short journey,
if one wheel (or brake disk) is hotter then that brake is likely to be
sticking. Don't let it get to the too hot to touch stage!
