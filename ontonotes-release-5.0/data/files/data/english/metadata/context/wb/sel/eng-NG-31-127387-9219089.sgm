Hi,

It is well known that the CRLB gives a good lower bound to the
variance of an MLE. In principle, however, cases may arise (if the MLE
is biased, for example), where there may be concerns about how well
the CRLB models the true estimator's variance (even when the sample
size becomes large). (For example, saying Var(X) &gt; 0.001 doesn't
necessarily tell me a lot about the Var of X!)

Thus, the purpose of my question is to inquire as to whether anybody
has ever worked out a decent Â upper bound for the variance of an MLE.
It would seem that even a very loose upper bound could be of use in
some instances.Any reference or papers you could provide me would be
of interest.

TIA,

Matt
