&gt; This is right. The method of eating wheat grass is the same as for
&gt; all animals which seek its benefit, Chi, it needs be grazed (a word
&gt; we have euphemistically replaced with ‘fresh‘ whatever that now
&gt; means?).!

&gt; Chi in this case would be negative charge. Alkalinity depends on
&gt; negative charge. As the Chinese did not have a working knowlage of
&gt; electricity at the time, yet they knew it had an effect, which they
&gt; called it Chi!
&gt; Chi can be obtained from many fruits (exceptions do exist) and
&gt; vegetables.
&gt; Generally one can say it is the juice of something, indeed it may
&gt; be the juices of meat as well, yet NOT the meat fabric. It is the
&gt; meat-as-fabric which is positively charged (reference Monks broth‘s
&gt; for restorative alkaline (invalid) meat juices). Most fruit is the
&gt; storage of juice surrounding the seed. Many a plant uses the
&gt; deification by animals method of self distribution, some plants
&gt; even flirt to be ingested, so they are GOOD to eat.
&gt; A lot of plant’s can be eaten as the growing young shoot stage is
&gt; in progress. Kind of veal in veg. and fruit world.
&gt; Modern science and dietary observation often do not tie up or
&gt; concur on sources of known benefits. This may be due to the
&gt; inherent corruption within the administration of our food systems!

&gt;&gt; April 22, 2005
&gt;&gt; Wheatgrass madness
&gt;&gt; I was at the Jamba Juice looking at their menu. Some people are
&gt;&gt; apparently big on wheatgrass. I wonder why. Perhaps it’s:

&gt;&gt; …due largely to its chlorophyll content (chlorophyll is the
&gt;&gt; pigment that gives plants their green color. It absorbs sunlight
&gt;&gt; necessary for photosynthesis, hence the term &quot;liquid sunshine&quot;).
&gt;&gt; But according to the DeKalb Medical Center:
&gt;&gt; Only cud-chewing animals with multiple stomachs can properly
&gt;&gt; digest grass to absorb its nutrients. Even though we can decide to
&gt;&gt; liquefy wheatgrass into a juice we still can not benefit from it.
&gt;&gt; (My bold.)
&gt;&gt; Humans can’t digest grass: you need multiple stomachs like a cow.
&gt;&gt; Can’t be that then. Perhaps it’s the:
&gt;&gt; … enzymes wheatgrass juice delivers. Enzymes are complex protein
&gt;&gt; compounds produced by living cells that speed up biochemical
&gt;&gt; reactions required for proper and normal functioning of every
&gt;&gt; organ system and have also been found to aid digestion!
&gt;&gt; Enzymes have been found to aid digestion? Well, of course they
&gt;&gt; have – but not the enzymes in stuff you eat! From theNational
&gt;&gt; Council Against Health Fraud:
&gt;&gt; Enzymes are complex protein molecules produced by living organisms
&gt;&gt; exclusively for their own use in promoting chemical reactions.
&gt;&gt; Orally ingested enzymes are digested in the stomach and have no
&gt;&gt; enzymatic activity in the eater.
&gt;&gt; (My bold.)
&gt;&gt; The plant produces enzymes to help it (the plant) digest the
&gt;&gt; nutrients it needs. The human body produces enzymes to help it(the
&gt;&gt; human body) digest the nutrients it needs. But they are not the
&gt;&gt; same enzymes – they’re different molecules! Plant enzymes in stuff
&gt;&gt; you eat do not aid your digestion.
&gt;&gt; Perhaps it’s all the other stuff it contains, for example
&gt;&gt; …all amino acids … essential fatty acids, vitamins and minerals,
&gt;&gt; vitamins A, C and Bs… iron and vitamin K.
&gt;&gt; But according to Jamba Juice’s own nutrition facts table, a 2oz
&gt;&gt; shot only has 15% of the daily requirement of vitamin C and 20% of
&gt;&gt; iron, with no mention of vitamin K, etc (0% vitamin A - not even a
&gt;&gt; rounding error). Can’t be that then. You could eat a banana, drink
&gt;&gt; some orange juice and get more benefit. They taste better too. (Oh
&gt;&gt; yeah, it can’t be the taste either.)
&gt;&gt; Getting even deeper into the woo woo:
&gt;&gt; It is said a shot of wheatgrass juice can help cleanse the blood
&gt;&gt; and other tissues
&gt;&gt; I’m sure it has been said. It’s still complete crap. Also:
&gt;&gt; wheatgrass proponent Piter U. Caizer, known as the &quot;wheat grass
&gt;&gt; messiah,&quot; argues that there is literally an energy, a life force
&gt;&gt; eastern healers call &quot;chi,&quot; present in fresh-squeezed wheatgrass
&gt;&gt; Of course! It’s the “chi”. It contains something no scientific
&gt;&gt; instrument has even been able to detect. Wow!  How do they know?
&gt;&gt; I’m convinced.
&gt;&gt; Anyway, I found one thing that Jamba Juice and the National
&gt;&gt; Council Against Health Fraud do agree on. First (all emphasis
&gt;&gt; mine) the National Council Against Health Fraud
&gt;&gt; …it is conceivable that enzymes present in rectally-administered
&gt;&gt; wheatgrass juice could have chemical activity
&gt;&gt; And Jamba Juice:
&gt;&gt; For the more dedicated enthusiast, wheat grass can be taken as an
&gt;&gt; enema!
&gt;&gt; So it’s official. For all the good this stuff does, you might as
&gt;&gt; well stick it up your ass.

&gt;&gt; Derek's information (although he doesn't cite it) seems to be
&gt;&gt; taken from a commercial website, http://www.juiceitup.com/ that
&gt;&gt; sells lots of juice products at franchise stores in the South and
&gt;&gt; Southwest.  This is not a very solid resource since it comes with
&gt;&gt; the obvious bias of marketing its products and is full of
&gt;&gt; information that has no authoritative basis.

&gt;&gt; After looking around for an objective resource about the
&gt;&gt; nutritional value of wheat grass, or its juice, I finally came up
&gt;&gt; with this article at
&gt;&gt; http://www.dolenutrition.com/articleDetails.aspx?RecId=215
&gt;&gt; from Dole Nutrition Institute which concludes that wheat grass has
&gt;&gt; not been shown to have any significant benefits.  The chart that
&gt;&gt; compares spinach juice to wheat grass juice is very interesting.
&gt;&gt; The Dole Nutrition Institute might be said to have a bias, too,
&gt;&gt; since it is obviously affiliated with Dole, the world's largest
&gt;&gt; producer and marketer of fresh fruit and vegetables.  However, its
&gt;&gt; mission statement seems to establish its bona fides.  See section
&gt;&gt; titled Dole Nutrition Institute --
&gt;&gt; http://www.dolenutrition.com/about.aspx

&gt;&gt; I think it important to consider why information needs to be
&gt;&gt; objective.  There needs to be a sound, documented basis for
&gt;&gt; recommending a product, a basis that is not self-serving.   In his
&gt;&gt; post, Derek mentions at least three people as experts on wheat
&gt;&gt; grass.  All three seem to have had financial interests in selling
&gt;&gt; wheat grass products. Dr. Jensen was a chiropractor, a specialty
&gt;&gt; whose course of education is not known as one requiring
&gt;&gt; nutritional expertise.  Dr. Birscher is always referred to as a
&gt;&gt; research scientist, but of what we are not told, nor anything
&gt;&gt; about his/her background or education and experience.  Dr.
&gt;&gt; Birscher seems to be mentioned only at sites where merchandise is
&gt;&gt; being sold.  Ann Wigmore sold many products including ones made
&gt;&gt; from wheat grass.  The Ann Wigmore Institute in Puerto Rico
&gt;&gt; continues to sell products and offer educational programs that are
&gt;&gt; quite expensive.  See www.annwigmore.com She used the title Dr.
&gt;&gt; but was actually a naturopath and not a graduate of a post-
&gt;&gt; graduate medical degree program.  See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
&gt;&gt; Naturopathic_medicine for more information about naturopathic
&gt;&gt; practitioners.  These people are not objective information givers!

&gt;&gt; Any one of us can post anything we want to this list.  That's a
&gt;&gt; great freedom, but it does come with a certain amount of
&gt;&gt; obligation, I think, to be responsible.  There does not seem to be
&gt;&gt; any supported objective basis for recommending wheat grass to list
&gt;&gt; members. It's probably not worse than drinking water but it's not
&gt;&gt; any better, or healthier.  It troubles me to read *testimonials*
&gt;&gt; made as if they are based on scientifically established facts when
&gt;&gt; actually what's happening is much closer to multi-level marketing
&gt;&gt; techniques.

&gt; This could be my own set up a few years back when I went crazy

&gt; I also like other raw juice‘s as well. Juice made and drunk like

Wendy,

I hate wheatgrass but I can't knock the alkalizing power of it.  I am alkaline and MRI's show that I no longer have cyst growth.  I had wheatgrass at Jamba and just about freaked when I came home and could see the clock on the microwave from my favorite chair.  I can never see that.  It does have something special to it.  I didn't continue.  It isn't worth the taste to me.  But it was nice to see the clock and feel better that day.

As for the energy we and everything around us are only made of energy, atoms in constant motion.  I can buy that foods have different energies or at least their atoms are vibrating at different levels.  Seems possible.

I loved this article.  Thank you Wendy for taking the time to pull it up for us.  I really appreciated it and your take on it also -Love Sheryl

Any one of us can post anything we want to this list.  That's a great freedom, but it does come with a certain amount of obligation, I think, to be responsible.  There does not seem to be any supported objective basis for recommending wheat grass to list members. It's probably not worse than drinking water but it's not any better, or healthier.  It troubles me to read *testimonials* made as if they are based on scientifically established facts when actually what's happening is much closer to multi-level marketing techniques.

9 Chlorophyll (wheatgrass) rebuilds the bloodstream. Studies of
various animals have shown chlorophyll to be free of any toxic
reaction. The red cell count was returned to normal within 4 to 5 days
of the administration of chlorophyll, even in those animals which were
known to be extremely anemic or low in red cell count.

The above statement was the one of that grabbed my attention the most
being that I am on dialysis and receiving Epogen during dialysis.  If
this is true then and I was to drink wheatgrass daily then Epogen
would eventually not be needed.  I would have to do more research on
this but testing this would be pretty easy for me.

My blood is tested weekly and every month or so, depending on how I am
doing, I get Epogen.  Sometimes, I don't get it until next blood draw
because I am doing ok.  So, if I drink wheatgrass and I don't need
Epogen for a long time or anymore then the claims are accurate.  The
question is do I want to drink wheatgrass?  I hear is pretty nasty.

JC

&gt;&gt; This could be my own set up a few years back when I went crazy
&gt;&gt; drinking the stuff (still do it in the summer). Great. Got no
&gt;&gt; problems with it.
&gt;&gt; I also like other raw juice‘s as well. Juice made and drunk like
&gt;&gt; this, as in cut turned to juice and drunk, not stored, is
&gt;&gt; incredibly energising (own testament here).
&gt;&gt; Not sure it is a panacea for all that ails us with PKD/PLD, yet it

This is the one thing that fresh pressed juices will do; they will
swing you toward the alkaline, especially any that are green and
contain leaf vegetable. I down wheatgrass like a shot of tequila then
bite into a fresh orange (provided by jamba juice and raebock's
juiceries) akin to taking a bite into a fresh lime.

There is another book that speaks about enzymes in foods. This book is
called Nourishing Traditions. It is written by Sally Fallon from the
price pottenger foundation. I met the two authors of this book awhile
back. The second author is a nutritionist and has written a book about
healthy fats or omega 3's.
A little background:::
Price was a gentlemen who went around the world photographing
different tribes trying to discover the cause for dental caries, or
dental disease or cavities. He discovered that as long as tribes ate
their traditional foods, their teeth health was amazing without
disease. Once they made the switch to an industrialized diet omitting
their natural grains, their vegetables, and traded these for processed
flour, sugar, etc. the teeth in children became too crowded for the
mouth and the incidence of dental disease rose, hence the photographs.
Pottenger has come to be known as the cat man
http://www.for-petes-sake.com/Pottenger.pdf
He wished to determine the effects of heated food on animals vs raw
food.
Here is a quote from another article on Dr. Pottenger:
&quot;Studies have shown that before heating, milk is a living food rich in
colloidal minerals and enzymes necessary for the absorption and
utilization of the sugars, fats and minerals in the milk. For example,
milk has an enzyme called phosphatase that allows the body to absorb
the calcium from the milk. Lactase is an enzyme that allows for the
digestion of lactose.
Butterfat has a cortisone-like factor which is heat sensitive
(destroyed by heat) that prevents stiffness in the joints. Raw milk
contains beneficial bacteria as well as lactic acids that allow these
beneficial bacteria to implant in the intestines. All of these
qualities are destroyed during pasteurization. Once heated, milk
becomes rotten, with precipitated minerals that can't be absorbed
(hence osteoporosis), with sugars that can't be digested (hence
allergies), and with fats that are toxic.&quot;

The book Nourishing Traditions is filled with information on enzymes
in foods as well as recipes. This is where I learned about the special
handling that needs to take place of plant proteins such as grains and
legumes. My friend in Australia for years had difficulties with
absorbing the nutrients from her breads and homegrown vegetables and
fruits. She now faithfully follows the practices outlined in
Nourishing Traditions.  Her bread making process uses sprouted grains
or soaked grains. The bread baking is without yeast and takes at least
24 hours for the slow rise to occur. She uses lots of natural
occurring plant enzymes by making sauerkraut simply with raw homegrown
organic cabbage, shredded and soaked in Himalayan pink crystal salt.

She went from unable to conceive a child (her husband had a low sperm
count and she had previously had her tubes tied) to now expecting her
second child. She does not have kidney disease, but is in my opinion
an excellent excellent baker. I am trying to woo her into making a
video on bread baking non yeasted bread.

A few more notes on Nourishing Traditions. It is not geared
specifically to PKD; vegetarianism; nor is it a book to make you
healthy. It contains many meat recipes but those traditionally made
that were used by tribes containing yogurts and ferments that might be
useful to some. The recipes and the writing are observations for each
to see if they work for you or not. When I met the two authors, I had
to say, I think there were both not in optimal health. I suspect the
reasons might be that they both had some kind of allergies going or
perhaps they are simply human and do not always their own
recommendations in Nourishing Traditions. In speaking with the one
author, she recommended to me that I take fish oil. I explained to her
very softly that this was a fat that really caused my liver to ache
and even flax seed oil did the same. The one oil I could use was
hempseed oil. And milk and dairy were both foods that activated my
liver cyst growth and I suspect kidney cyst growth.

&gt;&gt; Chi in this case would be negative charge. Alkalinity depends on
&gt;&gt; negative charge. As the Chinese did not have a working knowlage of
&gt;&gt; electricity at the time, yet they knew it had an effect, which they
&gt;&gt; called it Chi!
&gt;&gt; Chi can be obtained from many fruits (exceptions do exist) and
&gt;&gt; vegetables.
&gt;&gt; Generally one can say it is the juice of something, indeed it may
&gt;&gt; be the juices of meat as well, yet NOT the meat fabric. It is the
&gt;&gt; meat-as-fabric which is positively charged (reference Monks broth‘s
&gt;&gt; for restorative alkaline (invalid) meat juices). Most fruit is the
&gt;&gt; storage of juice surrounding the seed. Many a plant uses the
&gt;&gt; deification by animals method of self distribution, some plants
&gt;&gt; even flirt to be ingested, so they are GOOD to eat.
&gt;&gt; A lot of plant’s can be eaten as the growing young shoot stage is
&gt;&gt; in progress. Kind of veal in veg. and fruit world.
&gt;&gt; Modern science and dietary observation often do not tie up or

&gt;&gt;&gt; Wheatgrass madness
&gt;&gt;&gt; I was at the Jamba Juice looking at their menu. Some people are
&gt;&gt;&gt; apparently big on wheatgrass. I wonder why. Perhaps it’s:
&gt;&gt;&gt; …due largely to its chlorophyll content (chlorophyll is the
&gt;&gt;&gt; pigment that gives plants their green color. It absorbs sunlight
&gt;&gt;&gt; necessary for photosynthesis, hence the term &quot;liquid sunshine&quot;).
&gt;&gt;&gt; But according to the DeKalb Medical Center:
&gt;&gt;&gt; Only cud-chewing animals with multiple stomachs can properly
&gt;&gt;&gt; digest grass to absorb its nutrients. Even though we can decide to
&gt;&gt;&gt; liquefy wheatgrass into a juice we still can not benefit from it.
&gt;&gt;&gt; (My bold.)
&gt;&gt;&gt; Humans can’t digest grass: you need multiple stomachs like a cow.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Can’t be that then. Perhaps it’s the:
&gt;&gt;&gt; … enzymes wheatgrass juice delivers. Enzymes are complex protein
&gt;&gt;&gt; compounds produced by living cells that speed up biochemical
&gt;&gt;&gt; reactions required for proper and normal functioning of every
&gt;&gt;&gt; organ system and have also been found to aid digestion!
&gt;&gt;&gt; Enzymes have been found to aid digestion? Well, of course they
&gt;&gt;&gt; have – but not the enzymes in stuff you eat! From theNational
&gt;&gt;&gt; Council Against Health Fraud:
&gt;&gt;&gt; Enzymes are complex protein molecules produced by living organisms
&gt;&gt;&gt; exclusively for their own use in promoting chemical reactions.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Orally ingested enzymes are digested in the stomach and have no
&gt;&gt;&gt; enzymatic activity in the eater.
&gt;&gt;&gt; (My bold.)
&gt;&gt;&gt; The plant produces enzymes to help it (the plant) digest the
&gt;&gt;&gt; nutrients it needs. The human body produces enzymes to help it(the
&gt;&gt;&gt; human body) digest the nutrients it needs. But they are not the
&gt;&gt;&gt; same enzymes – they’re different molecules! Plant enzymes in stuff
&gt;&gt;&gt; you eat do not aid your digestion.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Perhaps it’s all the other stuff it contains, for example
&gt;&gt;&gt; …all amino acids … essential fatty acids, vitamins and minerals,
&gt;&gt;&gt; vitamins A, C and Bs… iron and vitamin K.
&gt;&gt;&gt; But according to Jamba Juice’s own nutrition facts table, a 2oz
&gt;&gt;&gt; shot only has 15% of the daily requirement of vitamin C and 20% of
&gt;&gt;&gt; iron, with no mention of vitamin K, etc (0% vitamin A - not even a
&gt;&gt;&gt; rounding error). Can’t be that then. You could eat a banana, drink
&gt;&gt;&gt; some orange juice and get more benefit. They taste better too. (Oh
&gt;&gt;&gt; yeah, it can’t be the taste either.)
&gt;&gt;&gt; Getting even deeper into the woo woo:
&gt;&gt;&gt; It is said a shot of wheatgrass juice can help cleanse the blood
&gt;&gt;&gt; and other tissues
&gt;&gt;&gt; I’m sure it has been said. It’s still complete crap. Also:
&gt;&gt;&gt; wheatgrass proponent Piter U. Caizer, known as the &quot;wheat grass
&gt;&gt;&gt; messiah,&quot; argues that there is literally an energy, a life force
&gt;&gt;&gt; eastern healers call &quot;chi,&quot; present in fresh-squeezed wheatgrass
&gt;&gt;&gt; Of course! It’s the “chi”. It contains something no scientific
&gt;&gt;&gt; instrument has even been able to detect. Wow!  How do they know?

The quote about raw milk was taken from:
http://www.realmilk.com/raw.html

&quot;. . . with fats that are toxic.
Raw milk has been used as a therapy in folk medicine — and even in the
Mayo Clinic — for centuries. It has been used in the pre-insulin days
to treat diabetes (I've tried it — it works), as well as eczema,
intestinal worms, allergies, and arthritis, all for reasons which can
be understood when we realize just what is in milk — such as the
cortisone-like factor for allergies and eczema.&quot;

~Diane

Raw milk has its side effects. For years it was a vehicle for
tuberculosis spread. . . but now a days the raw milk farmers must
subject their cows to restricter health practices than the pasteurized
milk herds. Raw milk has not been a source for TB for many many years.
It is transmitted by passengers flying from one country to another
unsuspecting that they might harbor TB.
