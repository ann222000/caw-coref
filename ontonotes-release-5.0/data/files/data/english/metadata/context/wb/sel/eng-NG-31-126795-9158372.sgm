V SUNDARAM

Even while refusing to stay the 'comical' and 'whimsical' BANDH
called by the DMK and its allies on 1 October, 2007 on the Sethusamudram
issue which
is pending before the Supreme Court of India for final adjudication, the
Madras High Court imposed certain stringent and inviolable conditions on the
Government
of Tamilnadu to ensure that normal life is not in any way disrupted or
dislocated on that day in letter and spirit. In its interim order on the
writ petitions
filed by the AIADMK and Dr Subramanian Swamy, Janata Party President and
others, the Madras High Court directed the Government of Tamilnadu to ensure
that
all forms of public transport including civil aviation function smoothly on
that day. The court also ordered to publicise through all print and
electronic
media the steps taken by the Government of Tamilnadu to ensure normal life.
The Government of Tamilnadu through its Advocate General gave a categorical
undertaking before the Madras High Court to the following effect:

a) Government will ensure that there is no disruption of essential
services like tele-communication, water and power, milk distribution, fire
services,
newspapers and hospitals on the day of DMK-sponsored Bandh. Full police
protection will be given for the uninterrupted provision/supply of such
essential
public services.

b) Adequate protection will be given to vital installations such as
Power Stations/Grids, Sub Stations, Government Buildings, Courts,
Tele-communications,
and Bridges, Oil Installations, Railway Bridges, etc.

c) All Police Control Rooms will be fully activated.

d) Open-line patrol will be arranged.

e) Effective and stringent action will be taken against anti-social
elements indulging in violence and vandalism on the day of Bandh.

f) Visible bandobust will be provided outside Railway Stations, Bus
Depots, main roads, main junctions, hospitals, courts, schools and colleges.

g) Necessary police protection will be given to markets and business
places on the day of bandh.

h) Director General of Police, District Collectors and Commissioners
of Police will be directed to inform the Chief Secretary's Control Room
about
any ugly or unseemly incident of Law and Order.

Dr Subramanian Swamy
Chief Justice A P Shah
M Karunanidhi

All the common citizens of Tamilnadu have welcomed the
people-oriented order of the Madras High Court imposing very stringent
conditions upon the
Government of Tamilnadu for ensuring normal flow of life in every sphere of
activity on the day of bandh. The common people are very happy that the
Madras
High Court has rejected the State Government's claim that the DMK and its
allies have only called for a General Strike on 1 October, 2007 and not a
'Bandh'.
The First Bench, comprising Chief Justice A P Shah and Justice P Jyothimani
declared: ?We find prima facie substance in the contention of the
petitioners
(AIADMK, Dr Subramanian Swamy, and others) that the DPA had called for a
bandh and not a strike or hartal. We therefore admit the petition.? The High
Court
ordered the issue of notice to State Government, the DMK, the PMK, Congress,
The CPI, and CPI (M) to file their counter. The Bench adjourned further
hearing
to 24 October.

I spoke to Dr Subramanian Swamy and asked for his reaction and
comment on the Glorious Pro-Common People Verdict of the Madras High Court.
He said:
?I whole-heartedly welcome the judiciously wholesome sage-like verdict of
the Madras High Court to protect the interests of the common people on the
day
of the unconstitutional and uncalled for Bandh. Karunanidhi and his allies
should bear in mind the fact that they cannot treat the stringent conditions
imposed by the Madras High Court on Tamilnadu Government with contempt. IF
THEY OBSERVE ALL THE CONDITIONS IMPOSED BY THE MADRAS HIGH COURT, THEN THE
PROPOSED
BANDH WILL BE A TOTAL FLOP. IF THEY DO NOT OBSERVE THE CONDITIONS, THEY WILL
BE GUILTY OF CONTEMPT OF THE ORDERS OF MADRAS HIGH COURT. If they violate
the conditions, then they will have to face me again in the Madras High
Court on 24 October, 2007. Karunanidhi has got his first instruction on
democracy
and has been taught that institutions and Laws are above whims and fancies
of unscrupulous political parties and politicians?.

The historic order of the Madras High Court is both a legal and
moral victory for Dr Subramanian Swamy and the AIADMK. In this context I
would like
to invite the kind attention of the public to the following brilliant points
which Dr Subramanian Swamy had raised in his petition before the Madras High
Court on this issue:

1. Dr. Swamy said that he was filing the present Writ Petition in
public interest to issue a Writ of Declaration to declare the call of
?bandh?
by the DMK and its allies in the UPA on 1 October 2007 to demand speedy
implementation of Sethu Samudhram Project as unconstitutional and
consequently
to direct the respondents to ensure normal life and to maintain law and
order in the State of Tamil Nadu on 1 October 2007 or any subsequent days.

2. Dr Swamy said that he was filing his writ petition to question
the Bandh called by the respondent political parties on 1 October 2007 as
unconstitutional
since a call for 'Bandh' has been declared to be unconstitutional by the
Hon'ble Supreme Court. If the Bandh called by the respondents is conducted
on
1 October 2007, the public of Tamilnadu will suffer inconvenience and
irreparable loss and there will be a serious law and order problem.

3. Dr Swamy submitted that the third respondent (DMK) is a ruling
party in Tamilnadu and the Chief Minister himself has called for a Bandh
when
3rd respondent is also part of the Central Government.

4. Dr Swamy informed the High Court that he had filed two Writ
Petitions before the Hon'ble Madras High Court in public interest for a Writ
of Mandamus
to direct the implementations of the Ram Sethu Project without affecting the
Rama Sethu in any manner and also for a Writ of Mandamus to declare the Rama
Sethu as monument of national importance. These Writ Petitions were admitted
and notice was issued to the respondent and thereafter by order on 17 July
2007. It was later transferred to the file of the Hon'ble Supreme Court to
be heard along with the other cases and was renumbered as TCC Nos.26 and 27
of 2007 and both are now pending in the Hon'ble Supreme Court. The Hon'ble
Supreme Court at his instance passed an order dated 31 October 2007
directing
that the Rama Setu Bridge shall not be damaged in any manner. Thereafter on
14 September 2007 the Supreme Court directed that the dredging activity may
be carried and the Ram Sethu shall not be damaged in any manner. Dr Swamy
filed the copies of the above orders along with his Writ Petition before the
Hon'ble Madras High Court.

Keeping the above facts and factors in view, Dr Swamy categorically
submitted that the Bandh now called by the political parties on an issue
which
is a subject matter of the petition filed by him in the Hon'ble Supreme
Court, was clearly unconstitutional and the political parties, especially
the ruling
party, cannot be allowed to deviate from the process of law. He submitted
that the Bandh called for by the political parties is nothing but
interference
in the judicial process and thus means contempt of the Highest Judiciary of
this country. Finally, to cap it all, Dr Swamy said that the position is
made
peculiar in view of the fact that the Chief Minister himself as leader of
the 3rd respondent political party had chaired the meeting and had taken the
decision to organize a Bandh on 1 October 2007. Political parties are bound
by the laws of this country and cannot undermine the Constitution and the
Judiciary.

The people of Tamilnadu hope against hope that Karunanidhi would
some day learn that there is no virtue in evasion; no courage in
prejudice?either
linguistic or communal?and that there is no salvation in rational ignorance.

Judicial thought without action is sterile; judicial thought without
feeling is empty. The common people of Tamilnadu offer their reverential
salutations
to the Hon'ble Justice Sri A P Shah, the Chief Justice of the Madras High
Court of Judicature, for protecting their natural rights as innocent law
abiding
citizens by imposing reasonable and fair conditions?though stern in letter,
intent and spirit?upon the Government of Tamilnadu for strict observance on
the day of Bandh on 1 October, 2007. Thus, the Madras High Court has clearly
indicated that the written letter and spirit of Law will always prevail over
the unwritten Laws of Lawless politics!

To conclude the words of Vayuputhra, ?Judgment of the Madras High
Court reminds us of the great spinners in the cricketing field such as Lock
&amp;
Laker of Australia, Grimmet &amp; Oreilly of England, Lance Gibbs of West
Indies, Muralitharan of Sri Lanka, Gupte &amp; Gulam Mohammed, Bedi &amp; Prasanna,
Venkat
&amp; Chandra and Kumble &amp; Harbhajan of India, who were too good in bowling the
googly &amp; doosra. If the CM decides to 'leave' the ball, that is remaining in
the present stand, he will be 'clean bowled'; if he decides to take
'back-foot', that is withdrawing the Bandh call he will 'hit the wicket'; if
he decides
to 'play forward' and misses it, that is declaring holiday for the State
then he will be 'stumped'; if he 'hits the ball', that is the DPA
(Democratic
Progressive Alliance) cadres indulging in violence on the instigation &amp;
instruction of some Ministers, Mayors or MLAs he will be 'caught' at the
long-on.
The Chief Minister is in a 'catch-22', or rather, 'Face-Googly' situation,
where the fact of 'out &amp; defeat' is inevitable. The '2-J Bench' of the
Madras
High Court has played the game like

Dear All,

The article is quite interesting!

BTW, the matter was referred to Supreme Court.

The Special Bench heard the Case on Sunday, the 30th September and Stayed the Bandh all together.

This is a Victory for the Common Man, while MK threatens to sit on Hunger Strike on the 1st October.

I wish MK goes for  an indefinite Hunger Strike  and reaches his right destination!

Thanks,

J.N.Mahanty

Dear all:

I too wish to send MK to his right destination. But I know, at the age of
84, some leaders will jump in with a glass of orange juice. MK will break
his fast with in no time.

The High Court Judgement was more interesting than Supreme court. Last time
he  managed with a Bandh for reservation issue. This time taught a lesson.
Mk will lose his job, if he plans for a state sponsored Bandh.

Thanks
