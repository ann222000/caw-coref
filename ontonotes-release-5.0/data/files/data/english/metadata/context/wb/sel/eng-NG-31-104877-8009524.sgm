SECTION I

CONCISE HISTORY OF THE SEPHARDIM.

When the Roman Legions overran the Jewish nation, much of the Jewish
population was sent into exile throughout the Roman Empire. Many were
sent to the IBERIAN peninsula. The area became known by the Hebrew
word SEPHARD meaning &quot;far away&quot;. The JEWS in SPAIN and PORTUGAL became
known as SEPHARDIM or SEPHARDI, and those things associated with the
SEPHARDIM including names, customs, genealogy and religious rites,
became known as SEPHARDIC.

Sephardic names were well developed in Aragon by the year 1213.  (Note
reference 22, below.) Many of the names were of Hebrew derivation.   A
much lesser number were composed of a first name and a geographic
location, many times the result of conversion.

The Jewish nation in Iberia, numbering approximately 750,000 in the
year 1492, were banished from Spain by royal decree of Ferdinand and
Isabella. (Ferdinand's grandmother was Jewish.) (For a description of
the 1492 expulsion as written in 1495, see the link in Section IV,
Lore) The Jews of Portugal, were banished by royal decree several
years later. Relief from the banishment decrees and restoration of
civil rights was promised to those Jews who remained and converted to
Catholicism.

These converts were called CONVERSOS or MARRANOS (converts or pigs in
Spanish) and ANUSIM (forced ones in Hebrew). Some of the Jewish
population converted in name only, other converted by choice. All of
the Jews, whether those who left the country with their Jewish
religious beliefs intact, and those that were converted are described
as being SEPHARDIM or being of SEPHARDIC heritage. Many of the
SEPHARDIM left Spain after conversion because life as a &quot;new
Christian&quot; or Marrano was not as promised. &quot;Clean Blood&quot; laws were
established to deny the &quot;new Christian&quot; the same civil rights as the
&quot;old Christian&quot;. Many left the Iberian peninsula where some reverted,
and others did not.

The converted population that remained under the influence of Spanish
or Portuguese control or the control of countries heavily influenced
by the Catholic Church could not openly revert to Judaism for fear of
punishment inflicted by the inquisition. The punishment for reversion
or secret adherence varied from humiliation to death by fire. Many
Hispanics today practice Jewish customs without knowing the source.
Many are still secret Jews.

The names listed on this site have been identified as Sephardic by
civil and religious records and creditable authors. These names have
been used by Spanish and Portuguese Jews and conversos and many are
found today, world wide in Hispanic and Sephardic communities and
references.  Some names may no longer exist in their old form.

While not an expert in patronymics, some names, such as ABRAVANEL are
unmistakably of Hebrew origin. Other names, such as IBN YAHIA, appear
to be of Arabic origin. Still other names such as CASTRO and FRANCO
appear to be of Hispanic origin, the vast majority of these names
belonged to Jews at the time of expulsion. Still other names
(conversion names or Christian names) were assigned to Jews at
conversion, such as DE SEVILLA and SANTA MARIA. Many of these names
were the family names of the Christian &quot;sponsors&quot;.

Many of the names have been changed in the course of migration from
one country to another, such as Pena to Penha. Other names have
incorporated a prefix such as D', Da, De, or Do, with the surname, so
that D'Avila could be spelled DAVILA. Other names normally found with
a prefix, may be listed with or without the prefix. For example, d'
ANDRADE, da ANDRADE, de ANDRADE, may be listed as ANDRADE or ANDRADE
'D. The following prefixes may sometime be interchangeable; Aben, Ibn,
Aven, Avin and Ben. These prefixes may be found separated or attached
to the stem name. It would be prudent to search for names both with
and without prefixes.

One should check for variations in spelling.  For example, the names
Sejas, Cejas, Aceijas, Seixas, Aseixas, Acejas, Acezas, Asexas,
Azeixas, and Xexas are considered variants of the same name. It should
also be noted that many Sephardim who left the Iberian Peninsula and
practiced Judaism, changed their names and used aliases to protect
their families who remained in Spain and Portugal.

Some individuals insist that all names ending in ez in Spain and es
(meaning son of) elsewhere, denote Sephardic heritage. This is may or
may not be the case.

Not all individuals bearing these names may be SEPHARDIM, or of
SEPHARDIC origin, nor are they necessarily Jewish or secret Jews. The
authors of references from which names were extracted have identified
the names as Jewish at one time. No inference is made that Hispanics
carrying the names found below are Jewish. We have added a DNA
capability to explore the ethnic origin of Anusim/Sephardic/Jewish
names. The names on this site are provided only as an aid to
genealogical research. Many of the references listed on this site can
be obtained through your municipal public library system or through
the Inter-library Loan program or purchased from a commercial firm on
this site.

Many Sephardic families were ennobled as Conversos after 1492 - 1497,
so that some crests will contain Christian symbology.  Families can
have more than one crest for a variety of reasons.  Crests provided
are registered.  Many of the family crest descriptions also contain
information about family origin.  Heraldry may or may not be borne
only by the descendants of the individual to whom they were granted.
If you wish to display these crests, best read the rules.

^^^^^^^^^

Well, to me it doesn't matter, since I still suspect he wasn't the
Marlowes' own child...

but I DON'T believe he was the Queen's, like someone or other thinks
(a Russian?).

^^^^^^

The theory is Jean Jofen's,

she is Jewish herself,

I'm looking for the page...

this is it...

Dr. Jean Jofen has a Ph. D. in Languages and Literature from Columbia
University and is a certified psychologist.

During the last 20 years, she has been working on the Shakespearean
opus. Her theory is that three people were involved in it, all three
belonging to forbidden religions in England: Christopher Marlowe ---
whose mother she believed was a Marrano Jew, Francis Bacon --- whose
mother was a Calvinist, and the Earl of
Oxford --- whose father was a Catholic. These three religions were
forbidden in Elizabethan England.

Part V

What do we know about Marlowe's maternal family? His first name
&quot;Christopher&quot; could possibly be a link to Spanish Jews who converted
to Christianity. &quot;Marranos&quot; was the name given to them in Spain, which
means &quot;pigs,&quot; because they hated by both Christians and Jews. Other
scholars believe that this name was given to them because they refused
to eat &quot;pork.&quot; The Jews hated them because they had become Christians,
and the Christians suspected them of still holding on to the Jewish
religion. They did not like to be called &quot;Marranos&quot; and referred to
themselves as &quot;Retaliados&quot; or &quot;Convertites.&quot; Professor Yeruchalmi
reports that &quot;The New Christian&quot; was called &quot;Jew&quot; by his Iberian
adversaries. Thus a &quot;Jew&quot; was really a covert in contrast to a &quot;Hebrew
Jew,&quot; one who had never converted.

(etc.)

These converts of Spain took Saint Christopher as their special saint
and accepted the name &quot;Christopher&quot; for themselves and their children.

We know that the maiden name of Marlowe's mother was &quot;Katherine
Arthur,&quot; and that her grandfather's name was &quot;Christopher Arthur,&quot;
thus Marlowe was named &quot;Christopher&quot; after his maternal grandfather
&quot;Christopher Arthur,&quot; not &quot;John&quot; after his father. His brother, who
was born five years later (August 20, 1569), was named John Marlowe.

Urry reports that Katherine came from the Arthur family of Dover,
&quot;close to the harbour front under the castle cliffs.&quot; This adds to my
suspicion that the family had migrated (possiblly from Spain or
Portugal), since Dover was a coastal city, and someone coming from
Europe would have to come to Dover first.

(etc.)

^^^^^^^^^

If Marlowe proved to be Merovingian, though...

would that make him a Jew? - maybe not in a cultural way,
since a descent from Jesus would be one from a rebel...
