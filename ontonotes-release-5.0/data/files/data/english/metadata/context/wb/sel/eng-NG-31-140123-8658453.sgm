He's nothing but smoke, mirrors and *potential.* Sure, he doesn't torture
and mutilate animals, but he's worth less than nothing as an NFL QB. If Hass
gets hurt we're done. Holmgren let the best backup we've had in years get
away (Hamdan) because of his man-crush on Wallace and the CFL waiver-wire
quality Greene. We have the worst backups in the league.

I wouldn't lay this one at Wallace's door.  When he wasn't running
for his life (and failing,) his teammates were dropping passes
and blowing run-blocks.

He can win us a game in a pinch as he did last year.   No sense
bemoaning the fact that our backup isn't all-star quality.  That's
a rare luxury.  We have bigger fish to fry - our lack of depth at
tackle.
