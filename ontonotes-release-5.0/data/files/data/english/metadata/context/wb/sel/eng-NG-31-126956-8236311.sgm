THIS DAY IN HISTORY: RING OF HONOR CROWNS THEIR FIRST CHAMPION, FIRST
'SMACKDOWN ONLY' WWE PPV AIRS, STAN HANSEN WINS TITLES TWO YEARS APART
AND MORE
by Buck Woodward @ 8:00:00 AM on 7/27/2007

July 27th

On this day in history in ....

1945 - Buddy Rogers defeats Dave Levin to win the Texas Heavyweight
Title in Houston.

1956 - Duke Keomuka &amp; Tony Martin defeat Mike DiBiase &amp; Danny Plechas
to win the Texas Tag Team Title in Houston, ending DiBiase &amp; Plechas'
second reign.

1978 - During a New Japan Show at Budokan Hall in Tokyo, WWWF World
Champion Bob Backlund wrestled Antonio Inoki to a one-hour draw in a
three fall match. Inoki won the first fall twenty minutes into the
match, and Backlund won the second at the 36 minute mark, before they
went the distance.

1988 - Stan Hansen defeats Genichiro Tenryu in Nagano, Japan to win
the PWF World Heavyweight and NWA United National Heavyweight Titles,
which would later become part of the All Japan Triple Crown.

1990 - Stan Hansen defeats Mitsuharu Misawa in Matsudo, Japan to win
the vacant All Japan Triple Crown (NWA International, NWA United
National and Pacific Wrestling Federation World Titles). The title had
been declared vacant when previous champion Terry Gordy was
hospitalized.

1996 - Dr. Wagner Jr. defeats Aquarius (Yoshihiro Tajiri) to win the
CMLL World Light-Heavyweight Title in Sapporo, Japan. Wagner had lost
the title to Aquarius eight days earlier, and neither of these title
changes (which took place on Big Japan cards) were authorized by EMLL,
who control the title.

1991 - Steve Simpson &amp; Chris Walker defeat Scott Anthony (Raven) &amp; Rip
Rogers in the tournament final to win the Global Wrestling Federation
Tag Team Champions in Dallas, Texas.

2001 - Pro Wrestling Noah celebrated their 1st anniversary as a
promotion with an event at Budokan Hall in Tokyo. The main event of
the show saw Jun Akiyama defeat Mitsuharu Misawa to win the Noah
Global Honored Crown, becoming the second man to hold the title.

2001 - Kayo Noumi defeats Miho Wakizawa to win the All Japan Women's
Singles Title in a tournament final in Tokyo.

2002 - Low Ki defeats Spanky, Christopher Daniels &amp; Doug Williams in a
60-minute Iron Man match to become the first Ring Of Honor Champion in
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

2003 - WWE held their Vengeance Pay-per-view, the first ever Smackdown
brand-only event, in Denver Colorado at the Pepsi Arena. Here is Tim
Whitehead's original report on the event:

Vengeance, WWE's first ever Smackdown brand PPV, was a big success. It
was easily the best PPV since WrestleMania, and it highlighted how
much stronger the Smackdown brand is when it comes to in-ring action.
The show benefited from great heat from the live crowd in Denver.
Commentary was also strong from Tazz &amp; Michael Cole. Tazz has the
ability to be funny without being silly and distracting from the
seriousness of the matches. There were three terrific matches on the
show. There were also three gimmick matches, two of which were better
than expected. Only one was truly bad, and it was short. Some might
question the booking for a couple of the matches, but any booking
quirks were more than overridden by the strong match quality on the
show.

EDDIE GUERRERO defeated CHRIS BENOIT in the finals of the U.S. Title
tournament in 22:12. They need fewer titles, not more, and this one is
supposedly the revived WCW version of the U.S. belt which traces its
lineage back to the Mid-Atlantic area. They at least had two awesome
competitors for the finals. They started out trading fast mat spots.
Guerrero went on offense, and got a babyface reaction. He wasn't the
only supposed heel to get a face reaction on this show. Guerrero used
a kick to win a test of strength. He hit a huracanrana on Benoit and
they traded twos as each kept reversing the pin attempt. Benoit bailed
out for a while. Guerrero locked on a headlock. They traded tombstone
piledriver attempts, with Benoit eventually nailing Guerrero with a
shoulderbreaker and hooking the crossface. Guerrero made the ropes.
Guerrero went to the floor and Benoit caught him with a tope. Guerrero
did a huracanrana off the top. Guerrero scored some twos until Benoit
came back with a high backdrop and a superplex. Benoit scored a two.
Benoit hit two German suplexes but Guerrero blocked a third. Benoit
hooked the crossface again. The crowd popped big for the crossfaces,
as that hold is over big time. Guerrero made the ropes once again.
Guerrero hit some suplexes and a high superplex. He went for the frog
splash but Benoit rolled clear. Benoit hooked yet another crossface,
with Guerrero again making the ropes. There was a ref bump. Guerrero
got the title belt and laid Benoit out. He then hit the frog splash
but the revived ref only counted two before Benoit kicked out.
Guerrero then hit the ref with the belt and tried to set it up to look
like Benoit did it. The ref stayed down forever, and Guerrero became
frustrated when he wouldn't revive. Meanwhile, Benoit revived and
hooked the crossface. Guerrero tapped but the KO'ed ref didn't see it.
Benoit tried to revive the ref. Guerrero tried to use the tite belt
again. Benoit ducked and caught Guerrero with a suplex. Benoit went
for the diving headbutt but hit the ref when Guerrero moved. The ref
stuff was starting to get old and it hurt the match a little. At this
point, Rhyno ran in and turned on Benoit, nailing him with a gore.
This turn had been building off and on for weeks, but as of the most
recent TV Rhyno was fully in Benoit's corner. Anyway, Guerrero hit the
frog splash on the gored Benoit as the ref finally revived and counted
the pin. The ending was way overbooked but the match was a great
opener.

Vince McMahon gave daughter Stephanie a small bouquet of artificial
flowers. He had a huge bouquet of real flowers for Sable. Steph didn't
appreciate the size difference. Vince also reported that he'll appear
on RAW on Monday to confront Kane over his attack on Linda.

JAMIE NOBLE beat BILLY GUNN in 4:59. The stipulation here was that
Noble would get to &quot;sleep&quot; with Torrie Wilson on Smackdown if he won
the match. He came out with a briefcase, saying it was full of sex
toys. Gunn kicked the case into Noble's face. He opened it and looked
inside. The cameras only caught a glimpse but it appeared to be a lot
of lotions and various &quot;objects&quot;. Noble gave Gunn a plancha and
pounded him on the floor. Nidia came out, jealous because Noble wants
to have sex with Torrie. Gunn went on offense and scored some twos.
Noble hit Gunn with a DDT, but when he went for the pin, Nidia put
Gunn's foot on the rope to break the count. Noble went out and
confronted her and ended up getting his face slapped by both Nidia and
Torrie. Noble, by the way, was another supposed heel treated by the
fans as a face. The finish saw Gunn almost collide with Torrie, which
allowed Noble to roll him up and score the pin with a handful of
tights. Noble got a big babyface pop from the crowd. Torrie acted
horrified that she will now have to have sex with Noble on Smackdown,
but of course it'll be a lame screwjob (no pun intended), since
technically she promised to &quot;sleep&quot; with him. Guess she'll show up
with a bottle of Sominex and take a nap. Noble was later shown
drooling over a well &quot;used&quot; copy of the Torrie Playboy issue. This was
an okay short match.

BRADSHAW won a barroom brawl in 4:32. They had a fake barroom set up,
and the rules were that the last man left standing would win. The
other participants were (and forgive me if I miss someone here, as
they didn't do intros for most of the guys) Faarooq, Spanky, Nunzio,
Chuck Palumbo, Johnny Stamboli, Matt Hardy, Shannon Moore, the Basham
Brothers, Kanyon, Sean O'Hair, Funaki, Orlando Jordan, Brooklyn
Brawler, Doink the Clown, Brother Love, and some guy dressed as the
Easter Bunny. Brother Love asked everyone to bow their heads for a pre-
fight prayer, but then sneak attacked someone with a bar stool. They
just sort of brawled around using beer bottles, bar stools, and
assorted other objects as weapons. It was a mess. One guy after
another went down and stayed down. Funaki just sat and drank beer. It
came down to Bradshaw, Brother Love, and Funaki. Bradshaw broke a beer
bottle over Love's head and he went down. Funaki then passed out
drunk. Bradshaw was declared the winner. Faarooq was standing there,
too, but I guess he went down at some point. It was pretty bad.

CHARLIE HAAS &amp; SHELTON BENJAMIN defeated REY MYSTERIO JR. &amp; BILLY
KIDMAN in 14:53 to retain the Smackdown World Tag Titles. Let me start
off by saying the Haas &amp; Benjamin are improving at an amazing rate.
WWE needs to start building some regular tag teams who stay together
long term. And by long term I mean years and years and years. Haas &amp;
Benjamin are good enough that I'm afraid there are already plans to
break them up. As for Mysterio &amp; Kidman, they were off the charts
here. Mysterio started off against Benjamin. Mysterio hit a spinning
headscissors. Kidman hit a dropkick and another spinning headscissors.
Haas came in and was caught by Mysterio with a springboard legdrop.
Haas gave Mysterio a sit-down slam and a powerslam. Haas vaulted
Mysterio high for a huge bump. Mysterio kept kicking out of pin
attempts at two. Benjamin came back in and did a great roll through on
a huracanrana, but Mysterio then caught him with a dropkick out of
nowhere. Benjamin evaded a 619 but Mysterio still caught him with a
springboard splash to the floor. The Denver altitude certainly didn't
hurt anyone in this match. Kidman did a shooting star press to the
floor onto both opponents. Haas recovered and posted Kidman, who got
worked over for a while. Kidman made the tag but the ref disallowed it
since he didn't see it. They doubled on Kidman some more until he
finally made the hot tag. Mysterio hit a somersault springboard
dropkick on Benjamin. He then kicked Haas from the ring. Benjamin
tried for a suplex but Mysterio reversed it into a DDT. Mysterio hit
Haas with the 619 and went for the West Coast Pop. It ended up as more
of a springboard Thesz press, leading to a near fall. Kidman vaulted
Mysterio up and he gave Haas a huracanrana off the top. They've been
teasing a Kidman turn but I'm glad they didn't do it here. The finish
saw Haas hoist Mysterio on his shoulders, allowing Benamin, who made a
blind tag, to crossbody him off to the mat for a clean pin. Excellent
match with great heat!

They aired a great SummerSlam promo. It was a takeoff on the movie
&quot;Jaws&quot;, with everyone on a beach running from a shark. But Brock
Lesnar ran into the water and gave the shark an F5.

SABLE beat STEPHANIE McMAHON in 6:25. This was billed as a no-countout
catfight. Steph attacked Sable on the ramp. Sable fled into the crowd,
with Steph chasing her down and throwing her back across the barrier.
Sable came back and stomped Steph through the mat. Sable kicked and
bitch slapped Steph. Steph got a chair but the ref took it from her.
They fought some on the floor to tease the no-countout stips. This
wasn't good, but it wasn't nearly as bad as one would expect. It was
actually passable. Steph tore off Sable's top and the ref took his
shirt off to cover her up. While this was going on, A-Train ran in and
gave Steph a lariat. I guess they needed to find something for A-Train
to do. Sable crawled on top of Steph and got the pin on the boss'
daughter. Steph had to be helped to the back afterward, selling it as
a rib injury even though A-Train gave her a lariat.

UNDERTAKER defeated JOHN CENA in 16:01. Undertaker manhandled Cena for
the first few minutes. He unceremoniously kicked Cena out to the
floor. Cena got mauled on the floor by UT's methodical offense. UT did
the legdrop on the apron and the old school rope walk. He chokeslammed
Cena, but pulled him up at the two count to inflict more punishment.
UT went for the last ride but Cena blocked it and hit a DDT. Cena
removed the padding from a turnbuckle and UT hit the exposed steel on
a charge. Cena went on offense. which included bumping UT off the
apron onto the ring barrier. UT began coughing up blood, and it was
sold that he had internal injuries. Cena kept it up, stomping on UT's
rib area. Cena scored a bunch of twos. The pace slowed as they were
out there a long time in the Denver thin air. UT came back with a
lariat and went for the tombstone, but Cena blocked it. UT blocked the
FU. UT caught Cena with a boot to the face for a near fall. Cena hit
UT with UT's bike chain. Cena hit the FU but UT kicked out at two.
Cena, by the way, was yet one more heel who got his fair share of
cheers. Cena backed UT into the corner with punches but UT lifted him
up and nailed him with the last ride for the pin. It was a little
long, but an okay match. A good case could be made that Cena should
have gone over here, but if they do a follow-up at SummerSlam with
Cena winning, this will turn out okay, as UT did sell it big as if he
had been through a war at the end.

VINCE McMAHON defeated ZACH GOWEN in 14:00. You didn't think two
McMahons would job on this show, did you? Vince looks totally freakish
for a man his age. He toyed with Gowen, who got a fair number of boos,
for the first half of the match. He kept bodyslamming Zach and kicking
his one leg out from under him. Yes, Vince also strutted and smirked.
Vince lariated the hell out of Zach. Zach made a comeback when Vince
bumped out to the floor. He hit the Asai moonsault on Vince. Vince
grew enraged and went after Zach's one leg. He hooked a crab hold, and
Zach nearly tapped. In fact, he did a spot where he pounded his fist
on the mat to gain strength, and it looked like a tap, but wasn't.
Zach made the ropes. Zach hit a dropkick and crotched Vince on the
post. He also wrapped Vince's leg around the post. Vince came up
limping and was hit with a missile kick. Vince got his foot on the
rope to keep from being pinned. Vince got a chair, but as he fought
with the ref over it, Zach dropkicked it into Vince's face. It
appeared to cut Vince hardway, as he juiced a major gusher. I mean,
seriously, Vince was spouting blood like a fountain. Blood was all
over the mat. Zach went up for a moonsault off the top, but Vince
rolled clear and scored the pin when Zach crashed to the mat. Vince
limped out with blood all over his face, but victorious. Zach got a
standing ovation for his loss. This one was good for a gimmick match,
and everyone worked hard. The crowd liked it.

KURT ANGLE defeated BROCK LESNAR and BIG SHOW in a three way no-DQ
match to capture the WWE World Title in 17:29. Lesnar and Angle
attacked Big Show to start things off. Show shook them off, hurling
Angle out to the floor and chokeslamming Lesnar. Angle broke Show's
pin attempt up. They've done a real good job rehabbing Show after he
was reduced to a gimmick jobber on RAW. He didn't look out of place at
all in this match. Show overpowered Angle, including using his ass as
a weapon. Show blocked an Angle ankle lock attempt. Show legdropped
Angle, with Lesnar stopping the pin. Show scored two on Lesnar with a
neckbreaker. Angle and Lesnar used garbage can lids on Show. Show
suplexed them both. They came back and chokeslammed Show. Lesnar
covered Show for the pin but Angle broke it up. Angle and Lesnar then
went at it. Lesnar gave Angle an F5, but on the bump Angle rolled out
to the floor, saving him from being pinned. Lesnar went back after
Show and gave him an F5. Angle recovered enough to pull the ref out of
the ring to stop his three count when Lesnar went for a pin. Lesnar
rammed Angle into the stairs and posted him. Angle juiced. Show tried
to superplex Lesnar but Lesnar, in an amazing move, gave Show a
running powerbomb. Angle stopped Lesnar's pin with two chairshots, the
second of which busted Lesnar open and he juiced. Show recovered and
laid Angle out on the floor. Show cleared the Spanish broadcast desk
and was preparing to smash Angle through it. But Angle recovered and
Olympic slammed Show through the desk. By this point, the altitude was
getting to Show and this KO'ed him long enough to get some rest. Angle
and Lesnar brawled, both in the ring and on the floor. Angle gave
Lesnar two German suplexes, the second one flipping Lesnar all the way
over when released. Lesnar hit a spinebuster for a near fall. Lesnar
hooked a choke submission hold on Angle but Show recovered and
legdropped them both. He then chokeslammed both but only scored twos
when trying to pin them. Angle put the ankle lock on Lesnar. Show
broke it up and got Olympic slammed by Angle. Angle then Olympic
slammed Lesnar and got the surprise three count to win the title. The
thinking was that they put Show in to do the job for either other guy
but it didn't come down like that, and it was better that the title
changed with a pin on the champ. A great main event to cap off a hot
show.
