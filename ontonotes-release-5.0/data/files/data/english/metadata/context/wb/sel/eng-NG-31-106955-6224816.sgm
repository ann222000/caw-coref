Rick Grant, sadly died when Radio Hauraki got its own
frequency (he drowned)

George Balani, did talkback for ZB in Chch for a while,
I think he works for a TV channel there now

Ross Goodwin, corporate voice for Mai FM

Bob Leahy, reads the news occasionally, for Radio Live,
I think

Prime recently

Hi,
The only one's I know personally from the list you give are:

John Dicks: Last I heard of John he was doing computer programming and
occasionally voicing narrations for Instructions Manuals here in
Christchurch. John still has fond memories of his time on the boat.

Wayne Douglas: Wayne worked for Radio Rhema as their announcer trainer
for a few years after leaving Radio Avon, prior to Rhema relocating to
Auckland. Not sure where he is now.

While we are on the subject - and assuming some of you listen to
Hauraki's
breakfast show - Does Willy DeWitt drive you insane with his attempts
at
humour? I put up with him because the playlist on Hauraki is easily
better
than any other station, I might listen to zm but I find that XXX XXXX
Gillespie even more irritating than DeWitt and she talks four times as
much.

Wow. Ross Goodwin reduced to 'just' a corporate voice.

Mike Baker has been running 'The Flea' - a local Devonport LPFM
station, thats just leaped to the net. Listen:

Paddy O'Donnell is/was at 93.5 Beach FM - Paraparaumu/ Kapiti Coast.

Fred Botica does breakfast at 94.5 Mix FM - http://www.945fm . com.au
in Perth. After Hauraki he came down to 1XX along with Brian Strong,
"The Unreal" Lee Hanner and Paul "Mayday Mayday" Lineham as part
of the original 1XX team in June 1971. Fred went back to Hauraki in
1973.

Paul Lineham is with the Air force in Australia I think (Queensland)

Mike Jack has passed away (he was at 1XX starting in late 1971
For a few years in the 70's and again early 90's - we are still
playing one of his ads from the 90's for a local client).

Check the 1XX Online History page and check out THE 1970's AT 1XX
and the ONE DOUBLE eX STAFF pages - www.1xx.co.nz for the Hauraki/1XX

connection.

Mike Jack's passed away? I worked with him at Counties Radio in
Manukau / Papatoetoe in 1989 / 90. He initially did breakfast and I
did mornings, then we were switched over. Mike left after a few months
and I lost track of him. I still remember the posters that went up
with a B&amp;W pic of Mike and "Jack's Back". Where'd he go after that? I
don't think he was any older than late 40s when I worked with him, so
it's tragic to hear he's died young.

Ian Magan has been a concert promoter for many years, hasn't he?

There's Something Special in the Air from pirate Radio Hauraki +
WIN!!!!!

Over the past few months, you've seen our Radio Hauraki 40th
Anniversary pages
at www.radioheritage.net or maybe entered competitions to win CD's
and books
celebrating the famous New Zealand pirate radio station from
1966-1970.

As a thank you, we'd like to let you in on something very special.
We're not
going to post this information on our website, and it's only the
people who
read this email who will know.......there's also a new competition
later on
that only you'll know about......

Hauraki Exhibition is Awesome Experience!

I recently visited the Radio Hauraki 40th Anniversary Exhibition at
the
Maritime museum in Auckland [NZ] and was blown away by what I saw and
heard.
The replica studio, the original memorabilia from the Tiri, the
video, the
audio...it was a totally awesome experience....and the good news is
that the
exhibition is so popular that parts of it will probably become
permanent
exhibits....so whenever you're in Auckland...make sure you check it
out.....

Keep reading! Here comes great news!

Whilst in Auckland, I was handed a small package by The Good Guys.
Inside, were
44 tickets to the Radio Hauraki 40th Anniversary Reunion Party...the
by
invitation only party, the staff only party.....that was held on
November 11
2006...and the front of the ticket has a beautiful reprint of the
original red
Radio Hauraki Top of Your Dial 1480 'The Summer Sound - All Year
Round' car
sticker that used to be given to members of the 1480 Club!

40 Anniversary Souvenir Packages!

So, these were the tickets all the ex-Good Guys needed to get into
the 40th
Anniversary party....and we've decided to make 40 of them available
on a first
come first served basis only to friends and supporters of pirate
Radio Hauraki
1966-1970 who respond to this email and buy one of just 40 pirate
