As a note, it's naturally possible that ATL variants of the
various armaments are different from OTL, but they're giving
here as useful references, just to highlight capabilities.
Aircraft range is especially important here. I also use the
best known names of various arms projects (eg. V-1 instead
of Flak Zielgerät 76) as a measure of convenience.

1940 In the US presidential elections, Dewey wins narrowly
against Roosevelt. Young president is seen as one finally
capable of truly tackling depression and the increasing
economic competition.

1941 Start of atomic energy (and bomb) projects in France, UK,
Soviet Union, Japan and Germany.

US Navy starts the secret &quot;Manhattan&quot; project, aiming to give
atomic propulsion for submarines and surface ships. Theoretical
studies on atomic bomb started, research on special atomic
bomb equipped submarine starts. (a la original November-class)

German Army orders the V2 -rocket to be developed as tactical
weapon capable of dismantling strongest enemy bunkers.
Sufficient accuracy is expected via new radiotechnical
guidance systems. Operational readiness is expected by
late 1940's.

Luftwaffe orders development of a series of new stand-off
weapons, Fritz-X and Hs-293. A command guidance is sought
after first, to be improved by rapidly improving television
and in the future, perhaps by radar. Follow-on model to V-1
under development is ordered to have a 1000km range, 1000km/h
speed and 1000kg warhead. Studies for a possible radar
guidance system starts.

1942 Wide-scale public unrest in India, resulting in augmentation
of British troops. Communist-nationalist insurgencies in
French Indochina and Indonesia start. In Western Europe there
are strikes to support &quot;Quit Imperialism&quot; movement, as ordered
by the Soviet Union.

At the same time, Japan starts studies of various national
suicide options. War in China is going even more badly than
OTL and none of the extra-Asian powers is distracted by
European situation. Oil can be bought in limited amounts
from Mexico, but it has to be paid for.

However, Japanese leadership trust that various insurgencies
and the domestic resistance to colonial wars mean that Europe
is not really committed to an Asian Empire. Americans are
wimps, and can be scared away by decimating their fleet.
To put it simply, one push by Iron Will and the house of
cards will crumble.

On June 22 1942 the Japanese National Suicide begins, as
Japanese Fleet makes a surprise attack on US Navy and
simultaneously lands in French Indochina. Dewey declares the
June 22 to be the Day of Infamy and nationalistic and
rasistic fervor sweeps the United States.

Hitler is stunned by the Japanese move, but sees the
possibilities. He has considered the Japan as an possible
ally, but sees there's no real chance for Japanese effort.
Now there's a chance to align with the Britain, as well
as to support China as an possible future ally. In a
Sportspalast speech he declares war on Japan, members of an
inferior race. He reminds the public of the Boxer Rebellion,
when forces of civilization put down the anarchy. Just a few
days afterwards Mussolini declares war on Japan too, mostly
not to look so bad.

The British, French and the US are cautious of German and
Italian offers but have really no chance but accepting them.
Germany starts to build an expeditionary force for China
along with increased deliveries. A small naval task force
is sent to the Far East too, mostly to gain experience and
to do reconnaissance on Western navies.

The Soviet Union decides to do a volte-face and starts to
supply Japan; more time and effort wasted against Japan is
good for Soviet Union. Communist trade unions are ordered
to protest against this imperialistic war.

In India, the &quot;Quit India&quot; movement starts as members of
the National Congress decide not to support the war. A
compromise is reached in which India is promised Dominion
status after the end of the war, as only practical mean
to allow Britain to commit herself significantly to the
Pacific War.

Japanese naval forces proved to be tougher than expected, thus
by the end of 1942 Japan controls roughly the same perimeter
sans Burma as it did in OTL. Effectiveness of carriers and aircraft
against naval ships proves to be a rude surprise for the Western
Alliance powers. Japanese technology shock is also larger than OTL.

However, by the end of 1942 the Japanese, though not yet defeated in
any major battle, have a horde of enemies against them. German
expeditionary force is reaching China, and to replace the ship losses
of USN the French and British navies along with Italian and German
contingents are establishing themselves in Australia and Ceylon.

Dewey would have grave difficulty in beating FDR.

Also, it is very possible that if there is no war
crisis, FDR will will retire. That factor seems
to have been important to his decision to run again.

If a Republican does win in 1940, the U.S. will be
much more isolationist than OTL. The Republicans
were the isolationist party: though there were some
internationalist Republicans, the party base was
isolationist.

It is possible that Dewey would be obliged to declare
the U.S. neutral in any Japanese-British or -French
war. It would not be popular to support a colonial
power, even against a rival colonialist.

Highly unlikely. The U.S. might start a nuclear
research program - but in the absence of war, there
is no sense of urgency and very little funding. Even
in OTL, the Manhattan Project ran on a shoestring
for years. During the construction of the Fermi pile
in Chicago, certain of the Project scientists were
prized for their talent at &quot;requisitioning&quot; needed parts
and supplies from the U of Chicago's labs.

The U.S. scientific establishment was interested in
atomic science, especially as they feared the Nazis
could get there first.

But that fear would be diminished if no war.

And atomic bomb or power research was extremely
&quot;blue sky&quot;. The US Navy was not ultra-conservative,

Not the Japanese, but the leadership of Japan. What are the options for
the Japanese really? There is the war in China, a negotiated settlement
for which is perhaps not possible and any way a loss of face against
inferior race. The almost inevitable border clashes with USSR (should have
included them in writing) and good code information show that the Soviet
forces are too strong, and Soviet Far East cannot provide enough oil.

The only options are for military leadership to lose face and perhaps
surrender the Japan for evils of democracy or communism, or to make the
one final effort after which everything is different.

One thing when criticizing decisions of Japanese OTL leadership is almost
always forgotten; The Second World War had not been fought yet. Most of
the wars were finished with negotiated settlements. So the basic Japanese
premise is that if the inflicted casualties on Western Powers are large
enough, there will be a lack of will to continue. One should also remember
that in this ATL the Second World War has not started yet; there is no
rhetoric about the final fight between Good (democracy and communism) and
Evil (Fascism).

There has to be logic for every weapon system, and A4 in OTL was partially

development the accuracy might be improved to a sufficient level. Compared
to superheavy guns, even tactical missiles show more promise.

Well, the results will be somewhat similar as it's highly possible that
the USN will get beaten in it's first encounters. I don't think the
Japanese can afford to let the Philippines out of the conflict, it's too
much of a flank threat for their efforts, and is bound to get stronger
over time. The best course of action is a surprise attack against enemy
main fleet, the US fleet, so that there is no chance of reinforcements and
flank threat for the Japanese main conquests. In SEA, the Japanese land
based airpower can largely substitute for carriers, as in OTL.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Remember that this is not the Second World War yet, but a war in Asia to
defend colonies with internal disorder. In OTL the Pacific War was a part
of the ultimate deathmatch between good and evil, a sideshow, though. UK
and France will pour money into military build-up, but this cannot be
compared to WW II level buildup. Thus any help is needed to combat Japan,
which is pouring all of its national resources into the fight.

Thus any offer for supplies and manpower has to be taken seriously. German
demands in return for help are likely to be quite moderate. Hitler has
been yet the Fascist with a Human Face, the moderate dictator in
comparison to Mussolini, Stalin and Japanese leaderships.

Raw materials, supplies and oil, in case of OTL the USSR was able to build

reasonable. On the other hand, as air transport is slightly more developed

Ah, left that out. Naturally the conquest of Indochina, Malaya and
Singapore has to include some losses for French and the British, but let's
left them unspecified. Say, Prince of Wales &amp; Repulse style loss for the
French, and due to unpredecented efficiency of Japanese air power the
French and the British cannot risk their fleets yet. The technological
shock by the Japanese will be even greater than OTL due to the fact that
Japanese have armed like in OTL, while the British and French armament and
r&amp;d process has been somewhat slower, without the advantage of two years
of combat experience.

Umm, as far as I know the radar received a huge competitive development
boost during late 1930's due to rearmament and in 1939-1942 due to combat
experience. While the theoretical base is still there in 1942 (and
probably more dilluted due to peacetime scientific publications, a factor
important also for atomic projects). Moreover, due to lack of combat
experience the full importance of radar probably is not appreciated yet.

The same thing goes for Western (and German) fighter aircraft, the
development will probably be slightly, but not very much, slower, due to
longer (but more comprehensive) R&amp;D cycle.

Thus, in rough terms, I'd think USN of 1942 would probably have Brewsters
as main fighter, and USAAC (when was it USAAF?) would probably have the
P-40 as the logical outgrowth of P-35. Japanese development would have no
such inhibitions.

Yes, 1938 building program for USN would be probably fairly similar as in
OTL, but from 1940 onwards the developments will be different. After all,
IIRC, USN building program in 1940 was influenced by the possible need of
fighting all of Europe and Japan.

For Army aircraft, the schedule will be somewhat different than OTL.
For example, B-29 project (or equivalent) would be probably started as a
low level design study but might get on to a full swing only after start
of the war. B-36 would probably start only as a response for corresponding
British or German projects.

Just withdraw to Manchuria. It's not like the Chinese, who will
immediately get back to work on their civil war, are going to be able
to do anything to threaten Japan. Heck, just do what they can to keep
the two sides fighting: Mao would probably accept armaments from the
devil himself to keep afloat.

A bad blow to the prestige of the military, but frankly - is the
Japanese leadership insane enough to imagine this would, say, bring
about a coummunist revolution? And Japan somehow managed to be a
fairly democratic society in the 20's without collapsing. The only
thing at stake here is the ego of military men, which I will admit is
a powerful force.

In any event, why is this necessary in the first place? There's no oil
embargo, and it's peacetime: why can't the Japanese buy enough oil to
meet their (limited - Japanese industries run on coal) needs?

The Japanese economy was in no immediate danger of collapse OTL 1941:
why can't they afford to buy oil ATL?

Why is the war going worse in China? Is the UK doing a major effort to
build up the Chinese? Are the Soviets? OTL the British were initially
pretty neutral re the Japanese invasion: with no Japanese-German
alliance, will they bother to change this?

It seems to me you're &quot;stacking the deck&quot; to get Japan into the war.

&gt;The almost inevitable border clashes with USSR (should have
&gt; included them in writing) and good code information show that the Soviet

&gt; The only options are for military leadership to lose face and perhaps
&gt; surrender the Japan for evils of democracy or communism, or to make the
&gt; one final effort after which everything is different.

Yes, because they will _lose_. Why do they assume the British and
French - who recently showed themselves able to fight a war with
millions of casualties - would be pushovers? Plus the US. Possibly
plus the USSR. Just keep the war in China going at a low boil, and
hope something turns up...but no, you've decreed that the war in China
is going worse (for unspecified reasons) and that the Japanese economy
is in such poor shape that they can't buy oil (again, for unspecified
reasons.)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
Against far str
&gt; One thing when criticizing decisions of Japanese OTL leadership is almost
&gt; always forgotten; The Second World War had not been fought yet. Most of
&gt; the wars were finished with negotiated settlements.

Which wars are you talking about? WWI wasn't exactly a very promising
example for those planning to expand through military means. Or are
you saying that the Japanese expect things will go as in 1905?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;So the basic Japanese
&gt; premise is that if the inflicted casualties on Western Powers are large
&gt; enough, there will be a lack of will to continue. One should also remember
&gt; that in this ATL the Second World War has not started yet; there is no
&gt; rhetoric about the final fight between Good (democracy and communism) and
&gt; Evil (Fascism).

But this isn't a _limited_ war: this is a massive effort to grab a
self-supporting resource base, which even if won will leave it's
enemies homelands untouched and pissed off (the Japanese could hope
OTL that the USSR would soon be out of the equation, France allready
was, and the UK even if unconquered would have to keep too close an
eye on the Reich to get involved seriously. The US was the _only_
serious problem).

Brewster was already getting the rep of bad QC and over promised

bomber. Without war pressure, they will be out of the Picture.

For your late 1942 airwing, would be Wildcats being phased out
by the Alt-Hellcat and alt-Corsair, TBD Devastators replaced by
Avengers and the Vought Seawolf(OTL sidelined for Corsair
Production) and for DiveBombers the SBD was to be replaced
by the Curtiss SB2C Helldiver or Douglas SB2D, both troubled
aircraft, so as OTL, a lot of SBDs around.

Army Fighters, P-35 &gt; P-41&gt; P-43(R-2600) &gt;P-44(R-2800) &gt;P-47
from Republic.

Bell P-39 &gt; P-39E &gt; P-63

Curtiss P-40C &gt; P-46 &gt; P-53 &gt; P-40D &gt;  P-60 &gt; P-40K &gt;  P-40N &gt; P-40Q
the prototype P-46/53/60 were closer to the Mustang, but Curtiss
never got permission to slow P-40 production to make them

Due to delays in turbochargers, Curtiss and Bell had their designs
crippled to a singlestage supercharger. No War in 1939, and
more development to that, allowing a Turbo before the Republic P-44.

Other than the P-40K onwards, those were all 1941 designs,
and IMO  the P-43 would be the main fighter from Republic,
the P-46 or P-53 from Curtiss, and P-63 from Bell for USAAF
fighters.

1937 trade deficit 607,000,000  1938 trade deficit 427,00000,
from drop in imports. At this point, material to puppet Manchuria
was used to cook the books, to make financial picture look better,
but like most colonies, was a money sink.

1939 budget Y10,360,000,000   64% for military
new loans Y5,400,000,000 ontop of Y3,600,000,000 from '38,
with new taxes. Inflation there was around 16%

Gold reserves 842,500,000 Y thats  about 2,106,250,000 USD,
One Dollar was worth about 4 Yen

Japan sent $85,227,000 USD in gold  $2,587,000 Silver

Japan imported $96,290,000 from USA  $50,242,000 in return.
Commonwealth was next in line for Japanese exports, but can't find
the value, and Peru was 5th, but no figures. Germany 1/10th of that
USA figure, not in top 10.

After the Panay, and all other things going on in China,
Commercial treaty of 1911 (kind of a MFN status) ended by USA,
cut off of loans/credit, and run up high tariffs
Trade with the USA, normally the largest trading partner, plummeted,
as did Commonwealth, after Japan put a Seige/Blockade on Tientsin
and Canton River

Things didn't get any better, with the cutoff of scrap Iron
and Oil sales, and  frozen US Bank accounts.

You can't run a country for long with 60%+ of your GNP
going to the Army and Navy, even without the bad news
above, signing on to the Axis just sealed fate.

After 1938, the Japanese did seem to be stuck on crazy.
I really feel that the the UK and and France not at War,
would not stop them from doing stupid things in China

Yes, ultimately for the Western powers it would be a limited war. It's not

For example, in this case I doubt the British would introduce
conscription, but rather would use various levies, primarily the Indian

have interesting post-war effects.

The US mobilization would probably also be much less intensive than OTL WW

You are about 40 years too soon. The Japanese were known for their
junk exports, the use of a place called Usa to make labels (Made in
USA) and the basically tin tanks they tried against the Soviets at
Nomonhon. Only after an American, W. E. Deming had spent 15 years
teaching Japanese industry about quality did they catch on.

the 1938 Naval buildup alone was one Billion USD, and following
years spending was approx 1.8B, 500M for mostly USAAC,
since Navy got the big prize last time.
The US Economy was near idle, coming out from a small
recession, economy had been deflating since '29, despite
all those three letter agencies FDR cooked up,and increased
Military spending: Inflation for 1938 was like -.7%.
This Defence budget was more than what the Japanese
spent, but was only 3% of the total spending

1940 Defence Budget was 9B, if my math was right, almost 5X
the earlier requests, and dwarfing what the Japanese were spending,
and was to get worse for the 1941 spending.

The Japanese GNP was running as hot as it would, near maxxed
since '37, while US increased 7% for '38, 8% for '39 and 14%
for 1940. The US never maxed, but throttled back in '44 as the
War was to won, but the US had increased over 45% since
'38 without going to total War economy

This spending was not secret, but the Axis nations couldn't see
what that steamroller was going to do to them.

'Razorblades and Refrigerators' scoffed Fat Hermann, on hearing
of US coming out of the Depression and rearming

Even had the US stayed at 1939 Defence spending, was more
than what the Japanese could hope to spend. IIRC, the Pacific
War portion took about 30% of what the US did.

&gt;&gt; to have been important to his decision to run again.

&gt;Agree, and IMO Henry Wallace, with FDRs support in 1940,
&gt;would have beat most any of the plausible R candidates
">

Wallace as the 1940 D nominee is ASB territory.

OTL FDR had to lean hard on the convention to
get him as VP nominee. He was an ex-Republican,
had never run for office, and was known as an
&quot;egghead&quot;.

More likely candidates are McNutt, Wheeler,
and Garner.

The other side of the Pacific is very far from
the U.S. A very large proportion of Americans
in this period saw no interest of the U.S. whatever
in such matters. The reaction to the apparent
folly of intervention in WW I was still very
strong.

Any U.S. politician who proposed to send U.S.
forces to fight (and die!) for British control
of Malaya, French control of Vietnam, or Dutch
control of Indonesia would be destroyed.

U.S. support of China was more popular, but
few Americans truly cared what happened among
&quot;gooks&quot;. It was not as though China was any
sort of stable or democratic society without
Japan.

As for control of all east Asia being a
perceived threat to the U.S. - again, very
far away, inhabited only by &quot;natives&quot;,
devoid of industry. Europe in 1940 dominated
the world.

Yes, but there's the other side of this. Now, I don't know if theres as
much truth to this as in Polish Cavalry Charges, but most popular accounts
cite heavy surprise upon Allied leadership when actually confronted by
Japanese military. After all, they were supposed to be inferior in
tactical and technical sense by all leading racial biologists, a science
surprisingly popular until the end of the Second World War.

This underestimation might well lead into self-assuming confrontation in
this ATL, even quite isolationist US leadership might confront Japan on
rough basis of  1) Those inferiors won't dare to confront a White power
2) Even if they do, they will get creamed in very short time, in a war
resembling more Spanish-American war on steroids than the Second World
War.

In 1940, the U.S. Army numbered only around 250,000
men; the OTL expansion was due to the perceived
threat of Nazi Germany.

Without serious military expansion, the U.S. cannot
intervene in Asia. That expansion won't happen
unless the U.S. feels threatened, and that race
factor pretty much eliminates Japan as a perceived
threat. Germany not being aggressive takes out the
other possible threat.

Well, it had to be losing another 50-odd million $ somewhere to get

believe trade terms will be more favorable with them than with the US:
what do they have that the Germans need?

That trade deficit definitely looks like a killer - if they need
imported raw materials to keep their war going, and they're spending
currency faster than they're importing it, it's not sustainable in the

Well, I'm not arguing that they wouldn't get into China: OTL 1937,
WWII was just a wee little dark cloud on the far horizon.

But having what you expected to be a Short Victorious War turn into a

Now, attacking the US OTL was fairly crazy, yes.

Attacking the US and two other Great Powers while you also have an

Paying for Oil, mostly. They were trying to build up a strategic

Esp when those powers were the very same who your major trading
partners were.

OTL they planned a short War, where the decadent westerners
would cave with one swift kick.

But they didn't plan on any real trade past 'Loot All' never gave a
though
on that all the US/UK/Dutch Tankers wouldn't carry Crude Oil,
and even if all the Allies disappeared from the Planet, they didn't
have the Merchant Marine to carry the free loot back to Japan
to get the Japanese economy back to normal

The 'planning' they did OTL was as bad as the underwear Gnomes
from South Park

Phase 1. Attack all your Neighbors

Phase 2  to be determined later

Phase 3. Win!  the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere
will be above the cowardly Westerners

Moreover, with more support is there are reason for Nationalists to seek
peace, really? China is the country with staying power, after the
situation has settled it is clear that they probably will have more to
gain by protracted war than Japan. Support from the outside will mean
stronger Nationalist Forces to be used against the Communists after the
Sino-Japanese war stops.

Gnomes had a long term strategy which did not involve overt provocation of
their victims :) But roughly, many wars are fought with Gnomes business
plan... When thinking about AH cases we are &quot;victims&quot; of the post-WW-II
thought which thinks that land grabs aren't that great an idea, and
colonies may well cost more than they are producing. The AH's are based
too many times on statistics and not enough on irrational logics. I mean,
if someone was writing an AH 1990's-2000's I wonder if anyone would
include dotcom boom?
