Sabra Shatila massacre recalled

Twenty-five years after surviving the massacre at the Sabra and
Shatila refugee camps in Beirut, Jamila Khalife still mourns family
members who were killed at the hands of Phalangist Lebanese forces.

Her life since then, she says, has been a daily reminder of the
horrors she witnessed as a 16-year-old Palestinian refugee from Jaffa
living in the camps at the height of the 1975-90 Lebanese Civil War.

&quot;This was my father,&quot; said Khalife, pointing to a black and white
photo of a man lying face down in a narrow street.

&quot;They shot him in the head.&quot;

Three of her relatives were also killed.

&quot;After it was over, on the way to find my mother at the nearby
hospital, I saw a woman on the street, her intestines were spilling
out. She died holding her baby,&quot; Khalife recounted as her own
daughter, Ghram (Arabic for Love), sat on her lap.

Dusk massacre

In September 1982, Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) fighters,

evacuated from their Beirut barracks and the Israeli army, surrounded
the refugee camps.

On the afternoon of September 16, Israeli forces allowed members of
the Lebanese Forces (LF) -an offshoot of the Phalange Party- into the
camps allegedly to search for suspects in the slaying of Lebanese
President Bashir Gemayel.

Gemayel, who also headed the LF, had been killed by a car bomb outside
his office a day earlier, angering many of his supporters and plunging
war-torn Lebanon into further chaos. Palestinian forces quickly
distanced themselves from Gemayel's death but it did not save the
camps from reprisals.

Khalife says she remembers seeing both Israelis and Phalange Party
members inside the camps that day.

&quot;The Israelis were wearing military uniforms. The Phalange wore jeans,
normal clothes and military arm bands. They swore at us in Lebanese
Arabic,&quot; she said.

Most aid organisations working in the camps in 1982 say around 2,000
civilians were killed over the course of three days.

Feigning death

Nabil Mohammad, a Palestinian refugee who lost all but one of his six
siblings, said: &quot;The Israeli military were bombing the camps and the
worst case scenario was that the Israelis would come in and collect
the young men so my uncle sent me away, thinking it would be safer.&quot;

Mohammad, his cousin and his cousin's wife dodged snipers as they made
their way to a retirement home where his aunt worked. When the
fighting had subsided and they returned to their home, they discovered
that five of his siblings and his mother had been executed.

His younger brother Munir survived by feigning his death a few feet
away from his mother's body.

Mohammad was only 19 when the killings took place but every year since
then he tries to keep the memories of his loved ones alive by
returning to the camps, now home to 45,000 Lebanese, Palestinians and
Syrians.

He remains bitter that fellow Arabs would commit what he called
atrocities.

But a former LF fighter, who spoke to Al Jazeera on the condition of
anonymity, insisted that the Israeli military, and not the Lebanese,
should shoulder full responsibility for the killings.

He said: &quot;After Bashir Gemayel was killed, Lebanon was at a boiling
state. We were angry, we were lost. We knew that something was going
to happen but didn't know what.

He admitted that the LF was angered by the assassination of Gemayel
but had no idea what was planned at Sabra and Shatila. The soldier,
who began fighting with the LF when he was 13 in 1979, said his unit
had been confined to barracks at the Beirut airport and not allowed to
leave after Gemayel's murder until they were deployed around Sabra and
Shatila.

&quot;It was not the LF [who were responsible for the killings]. It was the
Israeli soldiers who went inside those camps,&quot; he said.

Palestinians in Lebanon are determined to keep the history of the
camps alive, at least for their community.

Kassem Aina, a coordinator for the 'Never forget Sabra and Shatila'
campaign, told Al Jazeera: &quot;We tell the children not only about the
massacre of Sabra and Shatila. We tell them about all massacres from
Deir Yassin to Tel Zaatar to Sabra and Shatila. I feel sad we have so
many massacres in our history.&quot;

'Never forget Sabra and Shatila' was founded by Stefano Chiarini, an
Italian journalist and activist, who passed away last February.

To mark the 25th anniversary this year, delegations from Italy,
France, Spain and other nations will join Palestinian and Lebanese
memorials planned for the week.

Seeking justice

The memorials mark the events at the camps but also push for bringing
perpetrators to justice.

To this day, there has been no direct accountability for the killings.

Ariel Sharon was forced to resign as defence minister after he was
found both 'indirectly' and 'personally' responsible by the 1982
Kahane Commission of inquiry which investigated Israeli culpability in
Sabra and Shatila.

LF commander Elie Hobeika, who led the incursion into the camps,
received amnesty like all militia leaders following the Lebanese civil
war, and went on to become a member of Parliament.

He claimed he had evidence that would prove his innocence and directly
implicate the Israelis, but was killed one month before he was to
testify against Sharon in a case brought by camp survivors in Belgium
in 2001.

This weekend, the streets of Sabra and Shatila remain densely packed
with people struggling to live normally at the scene of one of
Lebanon's worst modern tragedies.

Legal resolution may arrive later but on this year's anniversary the
families of the victims are working to balance memories of their loved
ones with the ability to move beyond the tragedy.

How many moderate Muslims gave money to victims of Islamic terrorism?
Exactly the same number of moderate Nazis gave money to victims of
Holocaust. When American Muslim named Kamal Nawash tried to organize
anti-terrorism rally in Washington, DC., Islamic organizations
condemned the rally. About 50 people showed up, mostly Jews and
Christians. Arabic proverb says &quot;first comes Saturday, then Sunday.&quot;
It means that Arabs are going to exterminate Jews before they
exterminate Christians. It also means that Israel is the first line of
defense against Islam. Our media, our politicians, and our
universities are terrorized by Muslim immigrants and corrupted by
Saudi petrodollars. Muslim terrorists have not corrupted Islam, Islam
has corrupted them. Muslim immigrants could not care less about their
host countries because they have pledged exclusive allegiance to an
Arab-dominated, Muslim nation called Ummah. Islam is a heinous form of
Arabic imperialism disguised as a religion. It must be eradicated to
prevent another world war. Can you imagine Churchill or Roosevelt
praising &quot;moderate Nazis&quot;? Alas, we do not have a true statesman who
understands the heinous nature of Islam. Muslims use this fact to
prove that the West is decadent and powerless.

23-year old French Jew, Ilan Halimi was abducted by Muslim immigrants
and tortured for three weeks in a basement of an apartment building in
a southeastern suburb of Paris. Some Muslim neighbors came to the
basement to watch the torture and to participate in the torture. About
30 Muslim immigrants living in the building heard the screams of the
tortured Jew for three weeks, but none of them called the police. The
Jew was later found tied to a tree near a railway track. Cigarettes
were burned into his skin. He had multiple stab wounds. One ear and
one toe was severed. 80% of his skin was burned. He died on his way to
a hospital. While the Jew was held hostage, his torturers called his
family on the phone many times. They made ransom demands and quoted
Koran while tortured Jew's screaming was heard in the background. The
French police refused to trace the phone calls claiming that they had
technical problems. The police also claimed that there was &quot;no anti-
Semitism involved.&quot; The Jew's mother, Ruth Halimi was not happy with
the way the police handled the case. She said: &quot;We told the police
that there had been at least three other attempted abductions of young
Jews, but they persisted in considering the motives purely criminal
because they are afraid of reviving a clash with the Muslims.&quot; The
French interior minister, Nicolas Sarkozy, described the abduction,
torture and killing of the Jew as an anti-Semitic crime.

Two years earlier another Jew named Sebastien Sellam was savagely
killed in the eastern part of Paris by a Muslim. The Muslim cut off
the Jew's head and took out his eyeballs with a fork. He came home a
few minutes later saying to his family: &quot;Now, I can go to paradise. I
killed my Jew.&quot; The Muslim was sent to jail, then to an insane asylum,
and declared cured two years later.

THE ORIGIN OF ISLAM (sources: http://www.historyofjihad.org/

The birthplace of Islam, Arabia was afflicted with a harsh environment
unsuitable for agriculture. Bedouins inhabited this harsh environment.
They were wandering in search of pastures and supplemented their
meager livelihood with brigandage, which meant raiding other tribes
and commercial caravans. Though it was sheer looting, it assured them
solace, security and survival, and, therefore, it was not looked down
upon as sinful but a source of power, pleasure and prestige. This
institution of brigandage known as ghazwa (razzia) had existed long
before the advent of prophet Muhammad, the greatest Arab national
hero. The Umayyad poet al-Qutami has alluded to this custom in his two
verses: &quot;Our business is to make raids on the enemy, on our neighbor
and on our own brother, in case we find none to raid but a brother.&quot;
Brigandage was a compulsive trait of the Arab national character and
this is the reason that it was not considered an act of impiety but a
mark of honor and manliness.

The chief deity of pre-Islamic Mecca was the moon-god called Hubal or
al-ilah (god), which was shortened to Allah in pre-Islamic times.
Mohammed dropped the name Hubal but retained the generic Allah. Pre-
Islamic Arabs worshipped the moon-god by bowing in prayer toward Mecca
several times a day. They also made pilgrimages to Mecca, walked
around the Kaaba seven times and threw stones at the devil. And they
fasted for one month, which began with the appearance of the crescent
moon and ended when the crescent moon reappeared. These same rites
form the core of Islam today: Muslims bow in prayer toward Mecca, make
pilgrimages to Mecca, walk around the Kaaba seven times, and they
still throw stones at the devil. They also observe the fast of
Ramadan, which begins and ends with the crescent moon.

The word Islam is not derived from the word &quot;Salam&quot; which means peace,
but from the word &quot;al-silm&quot; which means submission or surrender. The
Kaaba is actually a meteorite which fascinated the ancient tribal
Arabs who were awe-struck by its flaming rush from the skies before it
landed in Mecca.

Mohammed (yimach shmo ve-zichro - may his name and memory be
obliterated) was a murderer, a pedophile and a scoundrel of the worst
kind. Epileptic fits created hallucinations that a god was talking to
him. His first converts were his wife Khadija, his slave Zaid, and
hardened criminals who wanted to loot a harried and defeated enemy.
Having lost his father, the posthumous orphan Mohammed wanted to
perpetuate his father's memory. His father's name Abdallah was derived
from Abd-Allah which translates as &quot;Slave of Allah.&quot; This is the
reason why Mohammed chose Allah among the many pre-Islamic Arab
deities to be the only deity to be worshipped by the Muslims.

After normal marriage with Khadija, he started his spree of marriages
with his marriage of Aisha who was the daughter of his follower Abu
Bakr. Aisha was just seven years old when Mohammed married her and she
was only nine years old when he consumed this marriage! This is the
inspiration for the Arabs of today to pick up child brides.

Realizing the significance of brigandage, Mohammed converted this
institution into a religious doctrine called jihad i.e., the holy War
against the infidels. At his core, Mohammed was nothing more than a
power grabber, who slyly used religion to promote himself. And the
people of Mecca as well as those of Medina saw through that. Some
inhabitants of Medina supported him because he advocated war against
their competitors: the Jews and the Quraish tribe of Mecca. Mohammed
drilled into his followers the fantasy that if they died in a jihad,
they would reach heaven (Jann'at) where they would be served by 72
virgins (Houris) and by pearly eyed boys for the perverts among his
followers.

Two communities lived in Medina (Yathrib): the pagan, polytheistic
Arabs and the Jews. They were often on the warpath. The Arabs were
more numerous, but the Jews by virtue of being traders were more
prosperous and better organized, they also had built fortresses within
and around Medina to defend themselves during their internecine fights
with the pre-Islamic Arab tribes around Yathrib (Medina). The Jews
were usually victorious in the battles against the Arabs. The Arabs of
Medina decided to outwit the Jews by becoming Mohammed's followers and
seek his help in defeating the Jews. This is why the Arabs of Medina
(Yathrib) welcomed Mohammed, in whom they saw an opportunity to break
the trade monopoly of the Jews and also to defeat their other rivals,
the Meccans.

Islam was conceived as a political ploy of Arabs living in Medina
against Jews and Mecca, and it was marketed by Mohammed to his first
converts in Medina as a political alliance rather than as a lofty
religion. Mohammed organized them to take his first revenge on the
Meccans, and he started regularly raiding the caravans of the Meccans
that passed by Medina. He organized 64 such raids from 622 to 630, of
which he personally led 27 raids. These raids were called Ghazawats or
Razzias. The Meccans finally got fed up with Mohammed's antics and
attacked him in Medina. This led to the first major battle in
Mohammed's life - the battle of Badr. The Meccan army was led by Abu
Jahal. In this battle, he realized that the far stronger Meccan army
could only be defeated by guile. He ordered all the water springs
outside Medina to be sanded-up, so that the attacking Meccans would be
without any water. This was a legitimate tactic in war, but a true
messenger of god would not destroy water supply of his own clan. The
Meccans decided to outwit Mohammed and attack Medina during a
cloudburst, to obviate the need for

Sabra Shatila massacre recalled
Al-Jazeera (summarized)

Twenty-five years after surviving the massacre at the Sabra and
Shatila refugee camps in Beirut, Jamila Khalife still mourns family
members who were killed at the hands of Phalangist Lebanese forces.

Her life since then, she says, has been a daily reminder of the
horrors she witnessed as a 16-year-old Palestinian refugee from Jaffa
living in the camps at the height of the 1975-90 Lebanese Civil War.

&quot;This was my father,&quot; said Khalife, pointing to a black and white
photo of a man lying face down in a narrow street.

&quot;They shot him in the head.&quot;

Three of her relatives were also killed.

&quot;After it was over, on the way to find my mother at the nearby
hospital, I saw a woman on the street, her intestines were spilling
out. She died holding her baby,&quot; Khalife recounted as her own
daughter, Ghram (Arabic for Love), sat on her lap.

Dusk massacre

In September 1982, Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) fighters,

evacuated from their Beirut barracks and the Israeli army, surrounded
the refugee camps.

On the afternoon of September 16, Israeli forces allowed members of
the Lebanese Forces (LF) -an offshoot of the Phalange Party- into the
camps allegedly to search for suspects in the slaying of Lebanese
President Bashir Gemayel.

Gemayel, who also headed the LF, had been killed by a car bomb outside
his office a day earlier, angering many of his supporters and plunging
war-torn Lebanon into further chaos. Palestinian forces quickly
distanced themselves from Gemayel's death but it did not save the
camps from reprisals.

Khalife says she remembers seeing both Israelis and Phalange Party
members inside the camps that day.

&quot;The Israelis were wearing military uniforms. The Phalange wore jeans,
normal clothes and military arm bands. They swore at us in Lebanese
Arabic,&quot; she said.

Most aid organisations working in the camps in 1982 say around 2,000
civilians were killed over the course of three days.

Feigning death

Nabil Mohammad, a Palestinian refugee who lost all but one of his six
siblings, said: &quot;The Israeli military were bombing the camps and the
worst case scenario was that the Israelis would come in and collect
the young men so my uncle sent me away, thinking it would be safer.&quot;

Mohammad, his cousin and his cousin's wife dodged snipers as they made
their way to a retirement home where his aunt worked. When the
fighting had subsided and they returned to their home, they discovered
that five of his siblings and his mother had been executed.

His younger brother Munir survived by feigning his death a few feet
away from his mother's body.

Mohammad was only 19 when the killings took place but every year since
then he tries to keep the memories of his loved ones alive by
returning to the camps, now home to 45,000 Lebanese, Palestinians and
Syrians.

He remains bitter that fellow Arabs would commit what he called
atrocities.

But a former LF fighter, who spoke to Al Jazeera on the condition of
anonymity, insisted that the Israeli military, and not the Lebanese,
should shoulder full responsibility for the killings.

He said: &quot;After Bashir Gemayel was killed, Lebanon was at a boiling
state. We were angry, we were lost. We knew that something was going
to happen but didn't know what.

He admitted that the LF was angered by the assassination of Gemayel
but had no idea what was planned at Sabra and Shatila. The soldier,
who began fighting with the LF when he was 13 in 1979, said his unit
had been confined to barracks at the Beirut airport and not allowed to
leave after Gemayel's murder until they were deployed around Sabra and
Shatila.

&quot;It was not the LF [who were responsible for the killings]. It was the
Israeli soldiers who went inside those camps,&quot; he said.

Palestinians in Lebanon are determined to keep the history of the
camps alive, at least for their community.

Kassem Aina, a coordinator for the 'Never forget Sabra and Shatila'
campaign, told Al Jazeera: &quot;We tell the children not only about the
massacre of Sabra and Shatila. We tell them about all massacres from
Deir Yassin to Tel Zaatar to Sabra and Shatila. I feel sad we have so
many massacres in our history.&quot;

'Never forget Sabra and Shatila' was founded by Stefano Chiarini, an
Italian journalist and activist, who passed away last February.

To mark the 25th anniversary this year, delegations from Italy,
France, Spain and other nations will join Palestinian and Lebanese
memorials planned for the week.

Seeking justice

The memorials mark the events at the camps but also push for bringing
perpetrators to justice.

To this day, there has been no direct accountability for the killings.

Ariel Sharon was forced to resign as defence minister after he was
found both 'indirectly' and 'personally' responsible by the 1982
Kahane Commission of inquiry which investigated Israeli culpability in
Sabra and Shatila.

LF commander Elie Hobeika, who led the incursion into the camps,
received amnesty like all militia leaders following the Lebanese civil
war, and went on to become a member of Parliament.

He claimed he had evidence that would prove his innocence and directly
implicate the Israelis, but was killed one month before he was to
testify against Sharon in a case brought by camp survivors in Belgium
in 2001.

This weekend, the streets of Sabra and Shatila remain densely packed
with people struggling to live normally at the scene of one of
Lebanon's worst modern tragedies.

Legal resolution may arrive later but on this year's anniversary the
families of the victims are working to balance memories of their loved
ones with the ability to move beyond the tragedy.
