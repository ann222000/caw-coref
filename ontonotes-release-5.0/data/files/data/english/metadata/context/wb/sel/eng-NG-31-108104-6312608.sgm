I just read an article in the local paper (complete with a photo which
horrified me)...about the little high school biology class's
dissection project, each student dissected a cat.

I am completely outraged about this, but I can't separate exactly what
I'm outraged about. Who supplies the cats? How do *they* get them.
Maybe they are shelter cats who are going to be euthanized. I wonder
how they're treated before/during euthanasia.

I wonder if the students really even learn anything worthwhile from
this. I have to believe this is extremely disturbing/traumatic for any
catlovers in the class. I am not science-oriented. Other people
probably see this differently than I do. I wonder. I do know the only
thing I ever dissected in class was an earthworm and later a frog,
which I could barely stand to do even back then.

It just made me so sad to see the picture. Labs don't raise cats
strictly to sell to classrooms, do they?

Thanks for listening.

I've never heard of that being done at a high school.  That was one of the
projects for one of my daughter's college biology classes, however.  They
obtained the already euthanized cats from the shelter.  Frankly, I don't
know how she did it, because she's so much an animal lover she won't read a
book if she knows that anything bad happens to an animal in it.  I guess the
fact that they were already dead, and would have been anyway, helped her get
through it.  She was a biology major, so it made sense.  I don't like the
idea of doing it in high school.  When I took high school biology, we
dissected frogs - except that I was sick that day.

horrified &gt;me)...about the little high school biology &gt;class's

When my sister was in high school she took a science elective-anatomy
where they dissected a cat. I remember discussing it with her back then,
she was mean(knowing I loved my cats) and even described the markings of
the cat...I cried. They got them from some supply company...the same
place the frogs and other dissection animals came from. Students knew a
cat disection was required for the class so since it was an elective you
could choose another science instead...I took chemistry.

I took the required biology but wouldn't touch the dissection animal we
were suppose to dissect. Luckily the teacher understood and had us in
groups of 3 so only one of the group actually had to cut into the
creature the other just took the notes. I remember we did a frog and a
crayfish. An idiot boy in class thought it was funny to rub his crayfsh
covered hand in some of the girls hair(mine included). It was
disgusting. I know I learned nothing practical from the dissections.  I
can't imagine the dissection of a cat being a practical experience for
most of the students.  p

Thanks, Joy. That's at least a better thought as to the origin of the
poor cat. I really had no idea, not having kids in school anymore. I
just wish the local paper hadn't put that picture in. It was just so
sad. And this might sound stupid, but so undignified.

No the cats aren't raised for this.  Yes they are shelter cats that would be
euthanized in any case.  Yes, an effort is made not to use cats that are
likely to be former pets.

They are preserved in formaldehyde.

And yes there is a great deal of value in this.

When I was is high school, in advanced biology, we dissected cats.  One cat
for every two students.  Most of the students in that class were headed for
pre-med and scientific college educations.  The cats were always treated
with respect.  We separated and labeled each and every muscle and memorized
its name.  I really don't think there is any substitute for dissection in
learning anatomy.

My lab partner is now a respected surgeon.

Yes some of the students learned that they weren't cut out for medicine.
Better to learn it in twelfth grade that wait until you are in med school.

An honors biology class, or first-year college level class makes more
sense to me. This was 10th grade Biology I kids if I understood the
article correctly. I still have doubts whether *any* of them would
come away from the experience having learned anything that would ever
be useful to them. But who knows. At least the teenaged boys in your
class proved themselves useful!  :-)

I hate to have to say that there are facilities that breed cats just for
research. I've seen ads for them in scientific research journals.

They use cats for research at the University of Minnesota. Now that the
statute of limitations has run out, I can say I... er... liberated one
of them, a beautiful long haired black female, and found a good home for
her. I couldn't save the other nine though :-(

My bet would be that the cats are euthanized at a local kill shelter,
and then sold, or given to the school to use in the classroom.

Buying them from a research breeder would be very expensive.

Somebody should start a petition; this is completely out of line for a
high school biology class. The level of anatomy for high school does not
require a higher vertebrate like a cat. Frogs are the norm for high
school dissection.

When I was in college, we used rats in the lower level class, and then
fetal pigs in the upper level anatomy class for dissection.

I simply can't imagine anyone using cats.

At the University of Minnesota, they use a lot of cats and dogs for
education (in the Medical School) and research, but while I personally
hate it, it's a way higher level of institution than a high school
biology class.

They come from Carolina Biological Supply Company in Burlington, NC -
the only embalmed cat supplier in the US.  They cost roughly 30-60
bucks a piece.  They are purchased from Class B animal dealers (some
of whom obtain animals under false pretenses) and from pounds, alive,
and killed on-site.  The veins and arteries are sometimes  injected
with colored latex just after death.  Carolina got busted for inhumane
killing of cats not too long ago but the case was thrown out of
court.

I have dissected these animals more than once - once in HS biology and
twice in college.  It was a waste of time and not necessary.  I did
not learn a thing that I couldn't have learned through the use of
models, simulations and software.

When I was at school, we dissected rats &amp; locusts at age 14/15. The
dissection was a powerful learning tool. It really is much, much more
effective than from drawings in a book.

And as much as I am a cat lover; the local crazy cat lady, I have to ask
myself why should cats be 'different' than any other animal and not be used?
Surely that's down to personal preference and cultural mores. In some
countries, eating beef is unethical. In some, eating horsemeat? In some
places they eat dog. We are simply placing our own cultural standards &amp;
ethics on a situation when in some other place it's our ethics which would
be seen as the wrong choice to make.

As much as it sucks, I am at least a little happy that the cat's death was
not *entirely* in vain. Just euthanising them because there is too many is
such a horrid and pointless waste. Finding at least *some* use for their
poor unwanted bodies is better (although not *alot* better, mind) than just
throwing the bodies in the trash, and would be cheaper than raising rats for
that specific purpose (as my highschool did). I'd also hazard a guess the
school pays a nominal fee for the bodies, which would also go back to the
shelter to help feed and vet the cats that do survive. It is also morally
superior (IMHO) than using lab rats: the cats would be euthanised anyway,
but unlike rats, were not raised for the specific purpose of vivesection.

Not an ideal solution of course, but means that the deaths are not just
totally pointless, as abhorrant as the thought is.

In school I did crickets, frogs, and fetal pigs.  Fetal pigs didn't
bother me because living on a pig farm I had to bury dead piglets all
the time, so I was used to handling them.

I don't think I could do a cat.

I'm biased as hell, I know it.  I could eat pretty much anything else,
including dog or monkey, but I could not eat cat.  I know this is
hypocritical.

If they're going to euthanize cats at a shelter anyway, they might as
well use the bodies for scientific purposes.  In Ontario, shelter cats
are sometimes given to research instead of euthanized.  Dylan once
worked in a lab and I think the hardest thing for him was seeing those
cats and then going home to ours and wondering why ours were "special"
and those ones "weren't".  It was behind that lab that he found Kumani
and Tyche in the trashpile and we wonder, were they kittens of a lab
cat.

You could just call the school and ask the teacher. I'm sure they would talk
to you.
Wow. All we did was frogs and I barely remember it. I'm not quite sure the
value of dissection in high school for the most part. Maybe in higher level
courses where it is clear the students are moving on to fields where it is
applicable.

Definitely I think they should avoid live animal work whenever possible.

You have seen off and on in the news the surgeon in Loma Linda that does
heart transplants on newborns.  He uses donor hearts from newborns born with
fatal brain abnormalities to replace hearts in newborns that are also
fatally defective.  I grew up with his wife so I've followed his career for
a long time.

Before he ever performed surgery on the first child he worked on the
procedure with dogs.  They would work with two dogs at a time, trading the
hearts between them.  Ideally you end up with two healthy alive dogs.

Yes its gruesome in a way, but it is also an invaluable learning tool.

Yes, I agree Karen. It's not like they are pre-med, or even serious
biology students. High School Biology I is a requirement, for cripe's
sake. They're not even there because they chose to be. I seriously
doubt *one* of them is going to have some epiphany from the experience
and become a surgeon, LOL. I don't remember anything that's ever been
useful from my frog either. All I remember about the experience is how
I disliked it. I would not have dissected a companion animal. NO way.
I 'd have taken a zero first. But that's just me, and I never had any
inclination toward a career in the sciences.

If I come across as annoyed or upset, a lot of the time I am.  But not with
you.  Just general life conditions.

So I apologize for my tone.

I know I don't always express myself well.  If dissection of cats is
required for a basic required biology course I think they are way out of
line as well.  And with the computer models that are available today it
hardly seems like something that is needed at all at the high school level.

Other considerations aside, you would think the school would have better
thing to spend the money on and to devote the facilities to.  It is
expensive and messy and requires secure storage.  I'd much rather see the
schools find the money for music and arts programs.

I agree with you for routine learning.  Computers and models are good and
getting better.

I just don't think they would be enough for someone learning physically how
to transplant a heart in a infant.  You would want to learn exactly what to
cut, what to suture, what not to miss, what to avoid.  What type of sutures
worked best etc.  How to complete the job quickly, etc.

After the first research and before the first babies were involved, there
had to be some intermediary steps to be sure it could work.

I was impressed that they made a point of doing the work in such a way that
the dogs lived.

When I first read about his work, it had some overtones of "mad scientist"
but I changed my mind when I saw the pictures of him staying up all night to
rock the babies when they were recovering from surgery.

I don't feel that dissecting animals is necessary unless it is part of
a subject directly related to medicine, veterinary science or surgery.
When at high school we watched our teacher dissect a rat and that was
it.

At university as part of my science degree I dissected a couple rats
and an earthworm. I would refuse to do that now, especially the rats.
The primary reason I left my previous job was because I was going to
be put into a position where I would need to kill the animals used for
these science classes at university.

Personally I felt participating or watching the dissections never
benefited my learning. I think the quality of the training and the
quality of the students would not be affected by the cessation of
dissecting animals in the undergraduate science units and at most
definitely at high school. Fortunately at my last university, no
students can be failed for refusing to dissect or even be present
during the dissection in your average biology or physiology class.

Like you, what these school students were allowed to do bothers me. I
guess I can take some small comfort that I seriously doubt cats or
dogs would be dissected at high school in Australia. There seems to be
a general move to minimise or eradicate all animal dissections at high
school. Most high school students aren't serious enough to benefit
from the dissection, and because of this it really it is a waste of
time. Heck, first year university students aren't even serious enough.

&gt; No the cats aren't raised for this.  Yes they are shelter cats that

&gt; cats that are likely to be former pets.

&gt; They are preserved in formaldehyde.

&gt; And yes there is a great deal of value in this.

&gt; When I was is high school, in advanced biology, we dissected cats.
&gt; One cat for every two students.  Most of the students in that class
&gt; were headed for pre-med and scientific college educations.  The cats
&gt; were always treated with respect.  We separated and labeled each and
&gt; every muscle and memorized its name.  I really don't think there is
&gt; any substitute for dissection in learning anatomy.

&gt; My lab partner is now a respected surgeon.

&gt; Yes some of the students learned that they weren't cut out for
&gt; medicine. Better to learn it in twelfth grade that wait until you are
&gt; in med school.

I did this in 9th grade with two classmates (girls).  It was offered as
extra credit and there was only 1 per class.  Everyone else was doing
fetal pigs.  We had to remove the brain and spinal cord to get an A+ for
the year.  We came close enough to get the grade.  The cat was in
formaldehyde.  I appreciated the experience and the two girls
participated pretty well even though it was a bit rougher on them than
me.  I had actually dissected a frog when I was in 4th grade.  I did it
at home with my older brother because I loved science.  I have a better
understanding of where the parts are today when I talk to the vet.  This
was almost 40 years ago.

There is not the slightest reason to raise cats for student dissection.
Do you know how much that would cost?  Consider how many healthy cats are
euthenized every year.  If anyone raises cats for medical research which
I guess they must it should be for very specific and I hope very rare
projects.  When I did the dissection in 9th grade we three were very
respectful of what we were doing at the time.  I guess we all wondered if
this cat had people at some time in its life.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Maybe they are shelter cats who are going to be euthanized. I wonder
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; how they're treated before/during euthanasia.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I wonder if the students really even learn anything worthwhile from
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; this. I have to believe this is extremely disturbing/traumatic for
&gt; any
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; catlovers in the class. I am not science-oriented. Other people
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; probably see this differently than I do. I wonder. I do know the
&gt; only
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; thing I ever dissected in class was an earthworm and later a frog,
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; which I could barely stand to do even back then.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; It just made me so sad to see the picture. Labs don't raise cats

I still am mulling this over and have a done just a little research.

Then we get into the question over how humanely the cats are treated

cats were stolen in Mexico for shipment to US labs.  Or the
allegations that Class B dealers stoop low enough to answer "free" ads

Is this just urban myth? I don't know. I know you can't believe
everything you read on the web or the newspapers ... but there's an
awful lot of controversy shrouding Class B dealers.
And if *one cat* is abused or mistreated, or suffers just because a
high-school teacher doesn't have the guts to buck tradition or the
ability to adequately teach her grade level without using a cat, that
$50 of MY tax dollars where spent to purchase, there needs to be

I actually have a serious problem with this. Our high school students
are lucky if they get to see a disection of A mouse or A rat, and even
then it has to be really justified before it goes ahead. The most they
may do in their final year of high school is a pig heart from the
slaughetr house. There is plenty of software out there that simulates
the real thing - I know because I use it at least 3 times a month.

Vet students at the Royal college of veterinary students are issued ONE
cat and ONE dog at the beginning of their 5 year course. They keep it
for the entire length of their university course. Those animals come
from the US in barrels of embalming fluid, and they *ARE* euthanaised
ex-shelter animals. Which I find very sad, but try to reconcile with the
fact that they are not dying in vain because their bodies are helping
the animal doctors of tomorrow.

As for high school students doing a disection of a cat though, no child
of mine would be allowed as I really don't see the benefit, and I'm
training to be a high school biology teacher!

I don't know for sure where the animals come from either.  Some others
here seemed pretty knowledgeable about it and don't paint a pretty image.
As for the dissection practice itself, my experience was almost 40 years
ago and a lot has changed since then so it is hard to judge.  For me the
biggest problem is the attitude of the teaching agent.  If a dissection
is done it needs to be done in an atmosphere of respect what ever the
creature.  I hate to be the one to limit experience knowing how advanced
I was at that young age but the moral side of education seems, to me at
least, to be more of an issue today that the subject matter.  And by the
way, the cat lady is a time honored figure in our society be one with
pride! :)

Having done this back in junior high school (back in the stone age) I
can't fully agree.  I do feel I got value out of it.  It WAS an elective
project and only a few of us more advanced students were allowed to even
do it AND at that time computer models did not exist so maybe things are
different today but I DID get value.

I'm not sure why the newspaper felt it necessary to run a story like that
with pictures no less.  When I was 15 (I'm now 61) we disected a cows eye,
frog and fetal pig in biology class.  Back then there weren't the
computerized help aides that are available today.  Not sure I could have
handled a cat though.  I don't see the value in this type of offering at the
high school level.  My nephew is a Vet Tech, studing to be be a Vet and for
him the hands on training at the  college level was invaluable.  Medical
students work with cadavers and I'm grateful since I wouldn't want a surgeon
working on me who only used computer images to learn from.  Likewise, if my
kitty needed surgery I would want my Vet to be very well trained.

I think what I'm hearing is how the animals are obtained.  Any animal bred
purely for the purpose of killing it is sickening......likewise animals being
stolen and mistreated just to send to "labs" for profit is a travesty.  As
much as it hurts me that any animal has to be euthanized because there's no
place for it to be loved and cared for......if it didn't give up it's fragile
life in vain, then to me it becomes a hero.

Thanks for the info., Helen. You make a very valid point about the
poor bodies helping tomorrow's cats. Forgive me for dragging this out;
I know other people are probably sick of hearing about it.
But I'm having a hard time wrapping my brain around shelter-euthanized
animals going to labs. I'm sure the labs don't want diseased cats. And
I'm sure some kind of preparation must be made before the cats are
preserved. So the staff must be trained as to preparation. Are those
shelters who supply Class B dealers themselves?
Those issues are why I couldn't imagine already-euthanized shelter
animals going to labs. I admit my world is pretty small (and getting
smaller!!) /And again, I'm not trying to stir controversy, and  I have
NO problem with dissection if the students are at least ON THE WAY to
that kind of career.
It's a "where do they come from, how are they euth'd, how much do they
suffer" for the sake of science. And could THAT be improved.
I called the school, and was promised the science teacher would return
my call when she was not in class. She never did.
Sigh. I promise I'll stop whining about this soon.

Oh, exactly so. Very much more than the practice itself. I do question
the youth &amp; level of the students. I would not question that at all if
they were older and doing coursework toward their chosen career.
Plus, it *is* my tax dollars being spent! Our schools have been crying
about budget lately and always threaten to cut band/music funding.
This burns me up also, and the fact that sophomores are being provided
expensive lab animals kind of fuels that too. I guess the whole thing
disburbs me on a whole bunch of different levels.

&gt;I agree with you for routine learning.  Computers and models are good and
&gt;getting better.

&gt;I just don't think they would be enough for someone learning physically how
&gt;to transplant a heart in a infant.  You would want to learn exactly what to
&gt;cut, what to suture, what not to miss, what to avoid.  What type of sutures
&gt;worked best etc.  How to complete the job quickly, etc.

&gt;After the first research and before the first babies were involved, there
&gt;had to be some intermediary steps to be sure it could work.

&gt;I was impressed that they made a point of doing the work in such a way that
&gt;the dogs lived.

&gt;When I first read about his work, it had some overtones of &quot;mad scientist&quot;
&gt;but I changed my mind when I saw the pictures of him staying up all night to
&gt;rock the babies when they were recovering from surgery.

When I was a freshman in college, I helped repair a human skeleton
which had been stolen from a biology lab and taken to a party, then
returned with several of the connecting wires broken and a few finger
bones missing.  I strung the bones back together, and even (at my
teacher's request) made a few faux bones from clay, fired them in a
pottery kiln, then used them to substitute for the missing fingers.

(In case you are wondering, I wasn't involved with the theft, but was
taking a pottery-making class at the time).

Some of my friends were horrified at the idea of my working with human
remains, and one even asked me, "Wasn't I afraid I would be haunted by
the ghost?".  However, I was fascinated by learning just how complex
the bone structure of the human hand and wrist is, and didn't
encounter any ghostly visitations.

I ended up as a computer programmer, not a doctor or biologist, but I
am glad I had the experience.
