*********************** ARTICLE START ***********************
Always ask for proof of what national breeder registry your Chihuahua breeder is listed with. A good Chihuahua breeder will have an ongoing interest in the health of your dog so ask questions about their support after the sale. Ask your vet for breeder advice as well. Any good Chihuahua breeder is going to have a policy that allows owners to return pets rather than abandon them.

When you start looking for a Chihuahua breeder to get your dog from then you are going to want to find out all the important things about that breeder before you do business with them. To do this you need to know what to ask a prospective Chihuahua breeder so that you can tell if they are reputable and if they know the business of properly raising and breeding Chihuahuas as well. Make sure you ask any questions you have, as a reputable breeder will expect questions.

The very first thing you want to know is what national breeder registry the breeder is listed with. A listing with a breeder registry means that the breeder understands and uses the practices of good breeding and that is something you absolutely want. If they are reputable they will have something to show you that lets you know what registry they are listed with.

A Chihuahua breeder that is worth doing business with understands that the relationship with the owner does not end when the transaction is over. Talk with your breeder about the support and advice they offer after the sale. Your relationship with your breeder will go on for many years after you bring the pup home so if your breeder indicates that they may not offer ongoing consultation then you may want to avoid that breeder.

A great source for any information you might need to know about your new pet can come from your vet. You will need a vet when you get a new pup so if you haven't picked a vet out yet then do so and discuss prospective breeders with your vet to find out what they think of the breeders you are considering. Your vet will steer you in the right direction and make sure that you deal with a breeder that you will be happy with.

As painful as it may be, any good Chihuahua breeder will have a policy where they will take back the pet at any stage of its life if the owner can no longer care for it, to avoid having the dog be abandoned. The breeder will not offer a cash refund but they will offer the dog a second chance at a new owner and offer the old owner a chance to do the right thing and not leave their little pet abandoned to die.

Deciding on a Chihuahua breeder is important so be ready to ask a lot of questions before you settle on one. A good breeder will be expecting a lot of questions so don't think you are doing anything new and many reputable breeders will insist that you ask as many questions as you can think of because to a good breeder a solid relationship with the owner is just as important as any other part of the dog's life.
