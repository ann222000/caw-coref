car 1:  2002 2.0tdci, 115k on the clock, gets 42 ish mpg according to
nerdy fuel receipts spreadsheet.

car 2: 2006 2.2tdci 18k on the clock, gets 47 - 50 + mpg according to
the onboard computer thing.

Both cars are driven sensibly (neither of us are boy racers). Owner of
car 2 takes the mick out of mine (car1) - he says he gets 42 when
towing his caravan.

I tell him his computer thing is not calibrated corrrectly.

Do these figures ring true?

I have one of these. I got 40 mpg before using an Inforad camera detector,
and now get 50 mpg.

The onboard computer is going to be more accurate than doing a
spreadsheet but unless the same driver is driving the both cars over
the same journey at the same time, there's going to be a variance.

And then there's the power to weight ratio and higher gearing of larger
engines. You get a sweet spot where a larger engine is able to move the
car easier and is more frugal at cruising speeds due to the higher
gearing. Smaller engine doesn't always equal more economical in the
same car. On my Capri, a 2L engine is 10% more economical than a 1.6.
I've found on older petrol Mondeos that the 1.8 is more economical than
the 1.6 or 2L.

I have to disagree there; onboard computers are usually inaccurate at
this calculation. This is because they measure flow rates, not the
actual volume of fuel going into the engine. I've had them in a Saab and
in an Omega and both were on the optimistic side.

Fuel calculations by brimming the tank are not always accurate in the
short term, but long-term they are far more accurate. I used to do it;
can't be bothered any more.

The only way to settle the OP's question is for both to brim their
tanks, then again after as many miles as possible, and calculate the mpg
for each (this is after all the method used in economy runs). I suspect
the 2.2 is more economical because it is running well inside its
capability.

I'm usually suspicious of the accuracy of measurements, so am wondering
about the following:

- Presumably the litres figure displayed on petrol station pumps is pretty
accurate (less than 1% error), because if they over-read they might be
prosecuted, but any degree of under-reading hits the (reportedly slim)
profit margin.
- I don't know how modern cars measure fuel flow. If it's a gizmo inserted
in the pipe between the tank and the engine, then I would expect the error
to be greater than 2%. If the flow measurement is done by the fancy fuel
pump that modern diesels have, I guess that could be more accurate.
- How accurate are car odometers? They probably have an error of at least 2%
once things like tyre wear are taken into account.

So is the difference reported between the 2 cars significant?

The one in my XM was fairly accurate - but certainly nowhere near as good

They don't just measure flow rate - because with a modern injected car, so

calculate based on the opening times of the injectors, so the actual fuel

OK, a few theories:

You got the wrong conversion value for litres -&gt; gallons, and are working in
US gallons (that would give you 50 mpUKg).

You do more motorway miles than he does. (our 1.4TDCi Fester does 60 around
town, 50 with mostly motorway.  Our 2.0DTi Signum does 45-48 on mostly
motorway)

He drives like a grandad, you drive it like you nicked it (although I would
expect 46-48 from both).

I've checked the *internal* speed sensor against GPS. (You turn the ignition
off, press the trip button, and then turn the ignition key, and it puts the
dashboard into test mode. If you then press the trip button, you get all
sorts of diagnostics.

One of them is road speed (resolution of 0.1mph). This matches up, at 50mph,
on a straight, flat road (50mph bit of the A55 east of Llandudno) with my
sat-nav, so whatever the ECU thinks the speed is, it agrees with the sat
nav.

So, as part of the test sequence, the computer controlled speedo needle can
accurately point to the &quot;Max&quot; point on the display (which means the computer
can accurately control the needle). The computer knows exactly how fast it's
going, but it *still* manages to over-read by 8% on the speedo. I recon it's
deliberate myself.

I have to disagree here. The Mondeo TDCI trip computer is &quot;known&quot; to be
accurate to only +/- 10%. Some cars it's spot on. Some it shows 10 over,
some it shows 10 under.

Mine shows about 5 over. When I did a shown 63mpg on a trip, I'd done 58.
The same trip showing 60mpg, I actually got 55.

They're usually consistent though. One that shows 5 now tends to show 5
always.

..by so little as to be completely insignificant. On a lorry I once
took in for a tacho calibration test, it was 0.5MPH out at 56MPH and
only because the tyre was half worn. If a 22&quot; tyre with a 20mm or so
tread depth only produces an inaccuracy of 1% when half worn, a car
tyre will priduce far less.

By law a speedo can't under read, but the tolerance for over reading is
quite high, so it's far safer for the manufacturers to verge on the side of
caution, although Ford do seem to take it a bit further than most.

&gt;&gt; There is an element of luck then because the EEC can't compensate for
&gt;&gt; tyre pressures or tyre wear, both of which will effect your speedo
&gt;&gt; reading.

&gt; ..by so little as to be completely insignificant. On a lorry I once
&gt; took in for a tacho calibration test, it was 0.5MPH out at 56MPH and
&gt; only because the tyre was half worn. If a 22&quot; tyre with a 20mm or so
&gt; tread depth only produces an inaccuracy of 1% when half worn, a car
&gt; tyre will priduce far less.

From old to new tyre on mine using the sat nav as a baseline, I got 2mph
variance at 70mph.  Each mm of tread gives a greater % of circumferance
change on a smaller wheel.

My Scorpio, according to sat-nav is very close to being accurate. 70mph on
the sat-nav is 71 on the speedo.

My Golf, at 70 on the sat-nav is reading 76 on the speedo

The Range Rover at sat-nav 70 indicates 72 - but it's got oversize tyres
(235s instead of 205)
