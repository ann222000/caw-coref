Tried something different, and seems like it actually worked rather well,
which surprised me.

Normally, I record the just-me-talking parts of my show separately,
compress them a piece at a time, add music, record another piece, compress
that, add music, and so on, just compressing the talking parts.

This last one, 28, I combined all the talk and all the music, compressed
everything at once, and put that in the MP3.  Only part I didn't compress
en masse was the intro -- and I'm thinking about redoing the intro, but
that's another story.

So, any opinions on that?  Wanna give it a listen and tell me if it sounds
as good that way as I think it does?  Did I misunderstand, that that's a
universally bad idea, compressing everything at once?

Music will be compressed in a wide variety of ways according to the dynamic
range desired. Background music for vocals is usually fairly compressed, as
a wide dynamic range will stand out and be distracting.

Vocals should always be compressed, especially if going over music.
Increasing overall volume while decreasing dynamic range gives an overall
impression of loudness and helps assure quieter parts of the vocal are not
lost in the music bed.

Compressed vocals are mixed over the compressed music. The relative volumes
are adjusted (either on track bounce or when laying the vocal onto the music
track) so that the music is the desired volume below the vocal. Usually
music is turned down a decent amount (anywhere from -4dB to -12dB) and vox
are turned down a touch (-1dB or so) to allow for harmonics when vocals
combine with music to create clipped peaks. Very rarely would either
compressed vox or music be turned UP during this mixing process.

Then the whole thing is usually normalized -- that is, the volume is brought
up by a few dB, compressed a tad more. Most sound engineers will add some EQ
here, expecially on the 4K range or so (if I remember correctly) to add what
they call &quot;sparkle&quot;). For the most part this is overkill for podcasters, but
it certainly doesn't hurt to normalize the whole thing by a dB or two.

If you put uncompressed vox over uncompressed music, you enormously limit
the bandwidth range you can select to work on (where musical information
shares bandwidth with voice) and the dynamic range you can adjust (you can't
make the vox louder without making the background music louder). The best
you can do is EQ tweaking and a sort of mastering-level final normalizing.

Mine is just, me talking, play music for a while, me talking, and so on.
Not voice over music.  So maybe it's okay, just because they're pretty
much separate anyway.

On my show I never compress the music that we've chosen to play on the
program.  Most music now is already OVERCOMPRESSED.  These kids who
record their own material and then hear their favorite records on K-Rock
from their favorite artists, and want their stuff to play as loudly as
the radio, and the squeeze the snot out of their mixes.  Even music from
the major labels is over-compressed, but the difference is the tools the
big studios have to compress music keeps the big label stuff somewhat
listenable.

Anyway, I only compress the talk part of my show, and leave the music
we've chosen exactly as it was when we found it.

Robust progressive conversation shared over a bottle of good wine,
tempered with humor and independent music.
