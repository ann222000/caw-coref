Sherlock Holmes, THE CREEPING MAN

...the TRUE history of this curious case remained entombed in the
TIN BOX which contains so many records of my friend's adventures.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

CHAPTER VI. PAWNING THE ISLE OF MAN

Lady Mary de Waldefeof married William de Montacute,
Earl of Salisbury, the grandson of Sir Simon de Montacute
&amp; Alfrida (daughter of King Olaf the Black). In 1344 A.D.,
Earl &amp; Countess of Salisbury were crowned King &amp; Queen of Man,

in the Cathedral of ST. GERMAIN's, in Peel Castle.

The Salisbury family set but little store on their insular throne,
for in 1393 A.D. the chronicles inform us that the Earl of Salisbury,
son of the one who married Mary de Waldefeof, sold the Isle of Man
to William de Scroop, afterwards Earl of Wiltshire, along with the
title of King, and the right of being crowned with a golden crown.
At this period the golden crown appears to have brought anything but
good fortune, for the Earl of Wiltshire got into serious trouble,
and was beheaded in 1399 A.D. for high treason against Henry IV,
who bestowed the little kingdom on Henry Percy, Earl of
Northumberland; but he in his turn got into disgrace, and was
attainted and banished by King Henry, who made another grant
of the Isle of Man, in 1406 A.D., to Sir John Stanley-

' to him and his heirs for ever; to be held from the Kings of
England, subject to AN ANNUAL TRIBUTE OF A CAST OF FALCONS.'

&quot;the days of old KING DERBY&quot;
----------------------------------------------------------------
INTRODUCTORY TO &quot;THE SCARLET LETTER&quot; by Nathaniel Hawthorne

&lt;&lt;It is a little remarkable, that--though disinclined to talk overmuch
of myself and my affairs at the fireside, and to my personal friends--an
autobiographical impulse should twice in my life have taken possession
of me, in addressing the public. The first time was three or four years
since, when I favoured the reader--inexcusably, and for no earthly
reason that either the indulgent reader or the intrusive author could
imagine--with a description of my way of life in the deep quietude of an
Old Manse. And now--because, beyond my deserts, I was happy enough to
find a listener or two on the former occasion--I again seize the public
by the button, and talk of my three years' experience in a Custom-House.
The example of the famous &quot;P. P. , Clerk of this Parish,&quot; was never more
faithfully followed. The TRUTH seems to be, however, that when he casts
his leaves forth upon the wind, the author addresses, not the many who
will fling aside his volume, or never take it up, but the few who will
understand him better than most of his schoolmates or lifemates. Some
authors, indeed, do far more than this, and indulge themselves in such
confidential depths of revelation as could fittingly be addressed only
and exclusively to the one heart and mind of perfect sympathy; as if the
printed book, thrown at large on the wide world, were certain to find
out the divided segment of the writer's own nature, and complete his
circle of existence by bringing him into communion with it. It is
scarcely decorous, however, to speak all, even where we speak
impersonally. But, as thoughts are frozen and utterance benumbed, unless
the speaker stand in some TRUE relation with his audience, it may be
pardonable to imagine that a friend, a kind and apprehensive, though not
the closest friend, is listening to our talk; and then, a native resERVE
being THAWED by this genial consciousness, we may prate of the
circumstances that lie around us, and even of ourself, but still keep
the inmost Me behind its VEIL. To this extent, and within these limits,
an author, methinks, may be autobiographical, without violating either
the reader's rights or his own.

It will be seen, likewise, that this Custom-House sketch has a certain
propriety, of a kind always recognised in literature, as explaining how
a large portion of the following pages came into my possession, and as
offering proofs of the authenticity of a narrative therein contained.
This, in fact--a desire to put myself in my TRUE position as editor, or
very little more, of the most prolix among the tales that make up my
volume--this, and no other, is my TRUE reason for assuming a personal
relation with the public. In accomplishing the main purpose, it has
appeared allowable, by a few extra touches, to give a faint
representation of a mode of life not heretofore described, together with
some of the characters that move in it, among whom the author happened
to make one.

In my native town of Salem, at the head of what, half a century ago, in
the days of old KING DERBY, was a bustling wharf--but which is now
burdened with decayed wooden warehouses, and exhibits few or no symptoms
of commercial life; except, perhaps, a bark or brig, half-way down its
melancholy length, discharging hides; or, nearer at hand, a Nova Scotia
schooner, pitching out her cargo of firewood--at the head, I say, of
this dilapidated wharf, which the tide often overflows, and along which,
at the base and in the rear of the row of buildings, the track of many
languid years is seen in a border of unthrifty grass--here, with a view
from its front windows adown this not very enlivening prospect, and
thence across the harbour, stands a spacious edifice of brick. From the
loftiest point of its roof, during precisely three and a half hours of
each forenoon, floats or droops, in breeze or calm, the banner of the
republic; but with the thirteen stripes turned vertically, instead of
horizontally, and thus indicating that a civil, and not a military, post
of Uncle Sam's government is here established. Its front is ornamented
with a portico of half-a-dozen wooden pillars, supporting a balcony,
beneath which a flight of wide granite steps descends towards the street
Over the entrance hovers an enormous specimen of the American eagle,
with outspread wings, a shield before her breast, and, if I recollect
aright, a bunch of intermingled thunder- bolts and barbed arrows in each
claw. With the customary infirmity of temper that characterizes this
unhappy fowl, she appears by the fierceness of her beak and eye, and the
general truculency of her attitude, to threaten mischief to the
inoffensive community; and especially to warn all citizens careful of
their safety against intruding on the premises which she overshadows
with her wings. Nevertheless, vixenly as she looks, many people are
seeking at this very moment to shelter themselves under the wing of the
federal eagle; imagining, I presume, that her bosom has all the softness
and snugness of an eiderdown pillow. But she has no great tenderness
even in her best of moods, and, sooner or later--oftener soon than
late--is apt to fling off her nestlings with a scratch of her claw, a
dab of her beak, or a rankling wound from her BARBED ARROWS.

The pavement round about the above-described edifice--which we may as
well name at once as the Custom-House of the port--has grass enough
growing in its chinks to show that it has not, of late days, been worn
by any multitudinous resort of business. In some months of the year,
however, there often chances a forenoon when affairs move onward with a
livelier tread. Such occasions might remind the elderly citizen of that
period, before the last war with England, when Salem was a port by
itself; not scorned, as she is now, by her own merchants and
ship-owners, who permit her wharves to crumble to ruin while their
ventures go to swell, needlessly and imperceptibly, the mighty flood of
commerce at New York or Boston. On some such morning, when three or four
vessels happen to have arrived at once usually from Africa or South
America--or to be on the verge of their departure thitherward, there is
a sound of frequent feet passing briskly up and down the granite steps.
Here, before his own wife has greeted him, you may greet the sea-flushed
ship-master, just in port, with his vessel's papers under his arm in a
tarnished TIN box. Here, too, comes his owner, cheerful, sombre,
gracious or in the sulks, accordingly as his scheme of the now
accomplished voyage has been realized in merchandise that will readily
be turned to gold, or has buried him under a bulk of inCOMMODITIES such
as nobody will care to rid him of. Here, likewise--the germ of the
wrinkle-browed, grizzly-bearded, careworn merchant--we have the smart
young clerk, who gets the taste of traffic as a wolf-cub does of blood,
and already sends adventures in his master's ships, when he had better
be sailing mimic boats upon a mill-pond. Another figure in the scene is
the outward-bound sailor, in quest of a protection; or the recently
arrived one, pale and FEEBLE, seeking a passport to the hospital. Nor
must we forget the captains of the rusty little schooners that bring
firewood from the British provinces; a rough-looking set of tarpaulins,
without the alertness of the Yankee aspect, but contributing an item of
no slight importance to our decaying trade.

Cluster all these individuals together, as they sometimes were, with
other miscellaneous ones to diversify the group, and, for the time
being, it made the Custom-House a stirring scene. More frequently,
however, on ascending the steps, you would discern -- in the entry if it
were summer time, or in their appropriate rooms if wintry or inclement
weathers row of venerable figures, sitting in old-fashioned chairs,
which were tipped on their hind legs back against the wall. Oftentimes
they were asleep, but occasionally might be heard talking together, ill
voices between a speech and a snore, and with that lack of energy that
distinguishes the occupants of alms-houses, and all other human beings
who depend for subsistence on charity, on monopolized labour, or
anything else but their own independent exertions. These old gentlemen
-- seated, like Matthew at the receipt of custom, but not very liable to
be summoned thence, like him, for apostolic errands--were Custom-House
officers.

Furthermore, on the left hand as you enter the front door, is a certain
room or office, about fifteen feet square, and of a lofty height, with
two of its arched windows commanding a view of the aforesaid dilapidated
wharf, and the third looking across a narrow lane, and along a portion
of DERBY Street. All three give glimpses of the shops of grocers,
block-makers, slop-sellers, and ship-chandlers, around the doors of
which are generally to be seen, laughing and gossiping, clusters of old
salts, and such other wharf-rats as haunt the Wapping of a seaport. The
room itself is cobwebbed, and dingy with old paint; its floor is strewn
with grey sand, in a fashion that has elsewhere fallen into long disuse;
and it is easy to conclude, from the general slovenliness of the place,
that this is a sanctuary into which womankind, with her tools of magic,
the broom and mop, has very infrequent access. In the way of furniture,
there is a stove with a voluminous funnel; an old pine desk with a
three-legged stool beside it; two or three wooden-bottom chairs,
exceedingly decrepit and infirm; and--not to forget the library--on some
shelves, a score or two of volumes of the Acts of Congress, and a bulky
Digest of the Revenue laws. A TIN pipe ascends through the ceiling, and
forms a medium of vocal communication with other parts of be edifice.
And here, some six months ago--pacing from corner to corner, or lounging
on the long-legged tool, with his ELBOW ON THE DESK, and his eyes
wandering up and down the COLUMNS of the morning newspaper--you might
have recognised, honoured reader, the same individual who welcomed you
into his cheery little study, where the sunshine glimmered so pleasantly
through the WILLOW branches on the western side of the Old Manse. But
now, should you go thither to seek him, you would inquire in vain for
the Locofoco Surveyor. The besom of reform hath swept him out of office,
and a worthier successor wears his dignity and pockets his emoluments.

This old town of Salem--my native place, though I have dwelt much away
from it both in boyhood and maturer years--possesses, or did possess, a
hold on my affection, the force of which I have never realized during my
seasons of actual residence here. Indeed, so far as its physical aspect
is concerned, with its flat, unvaried surface, coVEREd chiefly with
wooden houses, few or none of which pretend to architectural beauty--its
irregularity, which is neither picturesque nor quaint, but only
tame--its long and lazy street, lounging wearisomely through the whole
extent of be peninsula, with Gallows Hill and New Guinea at one end, and
a view of the alms-house at the other--such being the features of my
native town, it would be quite as reasonable to form a sentimental
attachment to a disarranged checker-board. And yet, though invariably
happiest elsewhere, there is within me a feeling for Old Salem, which,
in lack of a better phrase, I must be content to call affection. The
sentiment is probably assignable to the deep and aged roots which my
family has stuck into the soil. It is now nearly two centuries and a
quarter since the original Briton, the earliest emigrant of my name,
made his appearance in the wild and forest--bordered settlement which
has since become a city. And here his descendants have been born and
died, and have mingled their earthly substance with the soil, until no
small portion of it must necessarily be akin to the mortal frame
wherewith, for a little while, I walk the streets. In part, therefore,
the attachment which I speak of is the mere sensuous sympathy of dust
for dust. Few of my countrymen can know what it is; nor, as frequent
transplantation is perhaps better for the stock, need they consider it
desirable to know.

But the sentiment has likewise its moral quality. The figure of that
first ancestor, invested by family tradition with a dim and dusky
grandeur, was present to my boyish imagination as far back as I can
remember. It still haunts me, and induces a sort of home-feeling with
the past, which I scarcely claim in reference to the present phase of
the town. I seem to have a stronger claim to a residence here on account
of this grave, bearded, sable-cloaked, and steeple-crowned
progenitor-who came so early, with his Bible and his sword, and trode
the unworn street with such a stately port, and made so large a figure,
as a man of war and peace--a stronger claim than for myself, whose name
is seldom heard and my face hardly known. He was a soldier, legislator,
judge; he was a ruler in the Church; he had all the Puritanic traits,
both good and evil. He was likewise a bitter persecutor; as witness the
Quakers, who have remembered him in their histories, and relate an
incident of his hard severity towards a woman of their sect, which will
last longer, it is to be feared, than any record of his better deeds,
although these were many. His son, too, inherited the persecuting
spirit, and made himself so conspicuous in the martyrdom of the witches,
that their blood may fairly be said to have left a stain upon him. So
deep a stain, indeed, that his dry old bones, in the Charter-street
burial-ground, must still retain it, if they have not crumbled utterly
to dust I know not whether these ancestors of mine bethought themselves
to repent, and ask pardon of Heaven for their cruelties; or whether they
are now groaning under the heavy consequences of them in another state
of being. At all events, I, the present writer, as their representative,
hereby take shame upon myself for their sakes, and pray that any curse
incurred by them--as I have heard, and as the dreary and unprosperous
condition of the race, for many a long year back, would argue to
exist--may be now and henceforth removed.

Doubtless, however, either of these stern and black-browed Puritans
would have thought it quite a sufficient retribution for his sins that,
after so long a lapse of years, the old trunk of the family tree, with
so much venerable moss upon it, should have borne, as its topmost bough,
an idler like myself. No aim that I have EVER cherished would they
recognise as laudable; no success of mine--if my life, beyond its
domestic scope, had EVER been brightened by success--would they deem
otherwise than worthless, if not positively disgraceful. &quot;What is he?&quot;
murmurs one grey shadow of my forefathers to the other. &quot;A writer of
story books! What kind of business in life--what mode of glorifying God,
or being serviceable to mankind in his day and generation--may that be?
Why, the degenerate fellow might as well have been a fiddler!&quot; Such are
the compliments bandied between my great grandsires and myself, across
the gulf of time And yet, let them scorn me as they will, strong traits
of their nature have intertwined themselves with mine.&gt;&gt;

SCARLET Letter - Hawthorne
THE LEECH AND HIS PATIENT

&lt;&lt;. . . daily receiving the old physician in his study, or visiting the
laboratory, and, for recreation's sake, watching the processes by which
WEEDS were converted into drugs of potency. One day, leaning his
FOREHEAD ON HIS HAND, and his ELBOW ON the sill of the open window, that
looked towards the grave-yard, he talked with Roger Chillingworth, while
the old man was examining a bundle of unsightly plants. &quot;Where,&quot; asked
he, with a look askance at them--for it was the clergyman's peculiarity
that he seldom, now-a-days, looked straight forth at any object, whether
human or inanimate, &quot;where, my kind doctor, did you gather those herbs,
with such a dark, flabby leaf?&quot;

&quot;Even in the graveyard here at hand,&quot; answered the physician,
continuing his employment. &quot;They are new to me. I found them growing on
a grave, which bore NO TOMBSTONE, no other memorial of the dead man,
save these ugly WEEDS, that have taken upon themselves to keep him IN
REMEMBRANCE. They grew out of his heart, and typify, it may be, some
HIDEOUS SECRET that was buried with him, and which he had done better to
confess during his lifetime.&quot;

&quot;That, good sir, is but a phantasy of yours,&quot; replied the minister.
&quot;There can be, if I forbode aright, no power, short of the Divine mercy,
to disclose, whether by uttered words, or by type or emblem, the secrets
that may be buried in the human heart. The heart, making itself guilty
of such secrets, must perforce hold them, until the day when all hidden
things shall be revealed. Nor have I so read or interpreted Holy Writ,
as to understand that the disclosure of human thoughts and deeds, then
to be made, is intended as a part of the retribution. That, surely, were
a shallow view of it. No; these revelations, unless I greatly err, are
meant merely to promote the intellectual satisfaction of all intelligent
beings, who will stand waiting, on that day, to see the dark problem of
this life made plain. A knowledge of men's hearts will be needful to the
completest solution of that problem. And, I conceive moreover, that the
hearts holding such miserable secrets as you speak of, will yield them
up, at that last day, not with reluctance, but with a joy unutterable.&quot;

&quot;Then why not reveal it here?&quot; asked Roger Chillingworth, glancing
quietly aside at the minister. &quot;Why should not the guilty ones sooner
avail themselves of
this unutterable solace?&quot;&quot;They mostly do,&quot; said the clergyman, griping
hard at his breast, as if afflicted with an importunate throb of pain.
&quot;Many, many a poor soul hath given its confidence to me, not only on the
death-bed, but while strong in life, and fair in reputation. And ever,
after such an outpouring, oh, what a relief have I witnessed in those
sinful brethren! even as in one who at last draws free air, after a long
stifling with his own polluted breath. How can it be otherwise? Why
should a wretched man--guilty, we will say, of murder--prefer to keep
the dead corpse buried in his own heart, rather than fling it forth at
once, and let the universe take care of it!&quot;&quot;Yet some men bury their
secrets thus,&quot; observed the calm physician.

&quot;TRUE; there are such men,&quot; answered Mr. Dimmesdale. &quot;But not to
suggest more obvious reasons, it may be that they are kept silent by the
very constitution of their nature. Or--can we not suppose it?--guilty as
they may be, retaining, nevertheless, a zeal for God's glory and man's
welfare, they shrink from displaying themselves black and filthy in the
view of men; because, thenceforward, no good can be achieved by them; no
evil of the past be redeemed by better service. So, to their own
unutterable torment, they go about among their fellow-creatures, looking
pure as new-fallen snow, while their hearts are all speckled and spotted
with iniquity of which they cannot rid themselves.&quot;

&quot;These men deceive themselves,&quot; said Roger Chillingworth, with
somewhat more emphasis than usual, and making a slight gesture with his
forefinger. &quot;They fear to take up the shame that rightfully belongs to
them. Their love for man, their zeal for God's service--these holy
impulses may or may not coexist in their hearts with the evil inmates to
which their guilt has unbarred the door, and which must needs propagate
a hellish breed within them. But, if they seek to glorify God, let them
not lift heavenward their unclean hands! If they would serve their
fellowmen, let them do it by making manifest the power and reality of
conscience, in constraining them to penitential self-abasement! Would
thou have me to believe, O wise and pious friend, that a false show can
be better--can be more for God's glory, or man' welfare--than God's own
TRUTH? Trust me, such men deceive themselves!&quot;&gt;&gt;

What, lofty Shakespeare, art again REVIVED,
And VIRBIUS-like now show'st thyself twice lived?
'Tis Benson's love that thus to thee is shown,
The labour's his, the GLORY still thine own. -- John Warren
------------------------------------------------------------------
§ 1. Diana &amp; VIRBIUS/HYPPOLYTUS

&lt;&lt;The other of the minor deities at Nemi was VIRBIUS. Legend had it
that VIRBIUS was the young Greek hero HYPPOLYTUS, chaste and fair, who
learned the art of venery from the centaur Chiron, and spent all his
days in the greenwood chasing wild beasts with the virgin huntress
Artemis (the Greek counterpart of Diana) for his only comrade. Proud of
her divine society, he spurned the love of women, and this proved his
bane. For Aphrodite, stung by his scorn, inspired his stepmother Phaedra
with love of him; and when he disdained her wicked advances she falsely
accused him to his father Theseus. The slander was believed, &amp; Theseus
prayed to his sire Poseidon to avenge the imagined wrong. So while
HYPPOLYTUS drove in a chariot by the shore of the Saronic Gulf, the
sea-god sent a fierce bull forth from the waves. The terrified horses
bolted, threw HYPPOLYTUS from the chariot, and dragged him at their
hoofs to death. But Diana, for the love she bore HYPPOLYTUS, persuaded
the LEECH Aesculapius to bring her fair young hunter back to life by his
simples. Jupiter, indignant that a mortal man should return from the
gates of death, thrust down the meddling leech himself to Hades. But
Diana hid her favourite from the angry god in a thick CLOUD, disguised
his features by adding years to his life, and then bore him far away to
the dells of Nemi, where she entrusted him to the nymph Egeria, to live
there, UNKNOWN &amp; SOLITARY, under the name of VIRBIUS, in the depth of
the Italian forest. There he reigned a king, and there he dedicated
a precinct to Diana. He had a comely son, VIRBIUS, who, undaunted by
his father's fate, drove a team of fiery steeds to join the Latins
in the war against Aeneas and the Trojans. VIRBIUS was worshipped
as a god not only at Nemi but elsewhere; for in Campania we hear of
a special priest devoted to his service. Horses were excluded from
the Arician grove &amp; sanctuary because horses had killed HYPPOLYTUS.
It was unlawful to touch his image.&gt;&gt;
