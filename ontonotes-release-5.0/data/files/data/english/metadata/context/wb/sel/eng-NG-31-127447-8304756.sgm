There was a discussion in the recent post on operation &quot;snow white&quot;
about a movie about LRH.  A few years
back at the time of the Lisa McPherson case they shot a movie in St.
Petersburg that was a thinly disguised story of scientology.  I belive
it was backed by Bob Minton.  At the time the CoS managed to get a
worldwide injunction against it due to it's potential to poison the
jury pool.  The website for the picture had a message from the law
firm representing the producers saying that since the case was history
the ban was to be lifted and the film would soon be released.  Anyone
heard what happened after that?  I assume the CoS is still fitting its
release.

Within hours of being notified by Luke Lirot (attorney for THE PROFIT)
that
CoS had finally withdrawn their Injunction against the movie, the
producers
were notified by Mr. Lirot that Bob Minton, a partner in Courage
Productions, LLC
(the partnership that owns the movie) had started a legal action
preventing
the release and distribution of the film. It appears that Bob Minton is
still
working with CoS in order extend their grip on the film.

Generally, the person who supplied the funding, i.e., either the
majority stockholder or the majority creditor, calls the shots, like it
or not.  Minton is entirely within his rights if he qualifies as either
of majority stockholder or majority creditor to demand corporate action.

Minton might well be working for himself. TFC might have made a major
error at the onset of the deal.

Why, by the way, do you remain their ARS contact point?

Nobody

The
Profit

Nobody

About
the
Minton
Wars.

I've seen 'The Profit'; it would be good if it was available as a
'historical document', but otherwise, it's already irrelevant and
even for the time-period, it's less relevant than 'The Bridge' was
for its.

The only people who *care* about 'The Profit' and 'Bob Minton' as
controversies are OSA and obsessed whack-jobs.

I'm not quit sure what an &quot;OSA whack job&quot; is, but my interest in the
movie was more about freedom of speech and the CoSs' ability to keep
it from being shown.
As far as Mr. Minton is concerned I'm sure it was not his idea to stop
distribution of the film.  Everyone realizes that he was compromised
by the CoS and no longer acts as a free agent in these matters.
As far as his corporate position goes he also has a fiduciary
responsibility to the corporation and if it can be shown that he is
acting under duress against the best interests of the corporation the
other board members can override his objections.   In any case I will
continue to make up my own mind about what I do and  do not care
about.

The letter is a standard power of attorney.  It means that Mr. Minton
has turned over any authority he has in the corporation to Mr. McGowan
and, in effect, the CoS.
Basicly, it means the movie will not be released anytime soon, if
ever.  This answers my original question. Thanks.

It doesn't even have to be under duress.  He can not act against
the best interests of the partnership.  The best interests would be
to get the film shown.  It was made to be shown, not hidden or

So you have an understanding of intent, in regard to how any and all
decisions being made (and representations) , in fact may not be coming
from the person who relinquished all &quot;things&quot; in relation to both CP
LLC and the movie itself?

The cult know who to manipulate for an 'apparency'. And the
'apparency' is that the aforementioned Minton is directly behind
attempts to stop any showing or distribution of said film, when it is
clearly McGowen exercising his POA that *only* applies to CC and the
movie.

The last 3 lines of the POA are quite clear that now and forever said
POA will never apply to anythying beyond CC and the movie itself, no
matter *what*.

Both the POA and 'letter of demand' are quite &quot;odd&quot; in several
aspects.

&gt; As far as Mr. Minton is concerned I'm sure it was not his idea to stop

&gt; As far as his corporate position goes he also has a fiduciary

It's an LLC not a corp. No board of directors. The next step is
arbitration because Peter Alexander won on Appeal to get that. It's
been years now but with the CoS injunction out of the way, Alexander
's lawyer Lirot apparently has not been able to get anywhere with
Minton or his POA voluntarily going to arbitration as the Appeals
court ruled was the process their contract requires. I guess that
Alexander will now have to compel Minton or his POA to court by
subpoena to get the issue of Minton's opposition to Arbitration back
in the lower court view. Alexander will then have to use the lower
court to compel Minton to complete the process of resolving their
differences and settling accounts via arbitration.

Minton was subpoenaed to by CoS via Marin County CA court recently, as
was Gerry Armstrong and The Lisa McPherson Trust, which is
nonexistent? Not sure. I am curious to see what happens there. Perhaps
we'll hear soon.

&gt; Q &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;

The facts are that Minton already had an injunction from years ago on
Alexander distributing the film and that injunction is still in place
because the court order on that has never been recinded.

Minton won his case against Alexander  but Alexander won his appeal
that the LLC contract between them required arbitration services, not
court by jury, which is usually more costly.

It all started when Minton as a partner, sued Alexander as a partner
in the production company for access to all the accounting information
to get a final balance if any and to find out where his investment was
spent and on what. In the lower court case, Minton won the case
requiring the court to intervene and order the books be turned over by
Alexander to Minton for review. But on appeal of this case, Alexander
won on the point of having to use arbitration to resolve all the legal
matters between them.

The matter has been sitting for several years now, and seems that some
had hoped that, after CoS took off their injunction against the film
and the LMT, Minton would then be free to settle things with
Alexander.
It did not work out that way and my guess is because Minton wants the
matter on public record and probably does not trust using the
arbitration format since some of the 'Alexander et al' gang are kind
of cozy with some of the arbitrators on the Hillsborough County list.

Besides, Alexander would have to pay for lawyers to go back to court
to force the arbitration and since he's had years to do this and
didn't, he must have good reasons for not. But by not forcing Minton
to arbitration via the courts, Alexander does not have to reveal all
the records Minton wants to see, nor pay for expensive legal services
to defend his wishes.

So where things stand now, the movie is stalled, Minton's injunction
against the movie is still in place but the financial issues are not
going to done through civil court as Minton wanted.

Minton wanted the company financial records fully disclosed so that
the financial concerns he had about how his money was spent could be
resolved.

I have the documents in pdf format if anyone would like to post them
online.

THIS IS A CROCK. The books and records were delivered to the Judge
and since Minton/CoS only were interested in getting the NAMES of the
cast and crew, the Judge allowed the books to be given to Minton with
the NAMES redacted from the records. Minton/CoS didn't like that and
demanded the names---even though they were offerred the full set of
books and records. It was at that time it was pointed out that the LLC
partnership agreement required ARBITRATION and it moved to an
APPEALS court.

OH RIGHT!  The all powerful, omnipotent Gypsy Queen controls

Yeah and you forgot to mention that if Minton wanted the records, he
could've
obtained them from the Judge all those years ago. What Minton wanted was
information of the names of the cast and crew so that the C of S could
do their
harassment of the them.

If he wanted ANY legitimate information he would've gone through
arbitration
---not the corrupt Pinellas County courts.

How can I make it any clearer to you Mary.  Minton was OFFERED the
records
but with the names of the cast and crew redacted.  He refused!  He
wanted
the names too!  Why would Minton refuse to look at the books without the
names of the cast and crew?

Oh ya, there's that RFW site.  They seem to use &quot;documents&quot; to spin

&gt;&gt;&gt; Patty
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Q
&gt;&gt; You comment about facts.  So, what are the facts?  Can you post the
&gt;&gt; contract in question?

&gt;&gt; Q &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;

&gt; The facts are that Minton already had an injunction from years ago on
&gt; Alexander distributing the film and that injunction is still in place
&gt; because the court order on that has never been recinded.

&gt; Minton won his case against Alexander  but Alexander won his appeal
&gt; that the LLC contract between them required arbitration services, not
&gt; court by jury, which is usually more costly.

&gt; It all started when Minton as a partner, sued Alexander as a partner
&gt; in the production company for access to all the accounting information
&gt; to get a final balance if any and to find out where his investment was
&gt; spent and on what. In the lower court case, Minton won the case
&gt; requiring the court to intervene and order the books be turned over by
&gt; Alexander to Minton for review. But on appeal of this case, Alexander
&gt; won on the point of having to use arbitration to resolve all the legal
&gt; matters between them.

&gt; The matter has been sitting for several years now, and seems that some
&gt; had hoped that, after CoS took off their injunction against the film
&gt; and the LMT, Minton would then be free to settle things with
&gt; Alexander.
&gt; It did not work out that way and my guess is because Minton wants the
&gt; matter on public record and probably does not trust using the
&gt; arbitration format since some of the 'Alexander et al' gang are kind
&gt; of cozy with some of the arbitrators on the Hillsborough County list.

&gt; Besides, Alexander would have to pay for lawyers to go back to court
&gt; to force the arbitration and since he's had years to do this and
&gt; didn't, he must have good reasons for not. But by not forcing Minton
&gt; to arbitration via the courts, Alexander does not have to reveal all
&gt; the records Minton wants to see, nor pay for expensive legal services
&gt; to defend his wishes.

&gt; So where things stand now, the movie is stalled, Minton's injunction
&gt; against the movie is still in place but the financial issues are not
&gt; going to done through civil court as Minton wanted.

&gt; Minton wanted the company financial records fully disclosed so that
&gt; the financial concerns he had about how his money was spent could be
&gt; resolved.

&gt; I have the documents in pdf format if anyone would like to post them
&gt; online.

Sure, that is the Shore Story for ARS.  Where is the actual contract to
validate &quot;what we have been told&quot;?  If you have the contract among the
participants in the Profit corp, whatever it is, post it here.

Otherwise, I posit that you are being handled by TFCVP.

&gt; That's a CROCK. Minton has never, to this day, gotten an injunction
&gt; against  the film. Ms. Mary Knowitall should post it if she has it, but
&gt; she
&gt; doesn't, so she  won't.

&gt;&gt; Minton won his case against Alexander  but Alexander won his appeal
&gt;&gt; that the LLC contract between them required arbitration services, not

&gt;&gt; Alexander to Minton for review. But on appeal of this case, Alexander
&gt;&gt; won on the point of having to use arbitration to resolve all the legal
&gt;&gt; matters between them.

&gt; THIS IS A CROCK. The books and records were delivered to the Judge
&gt; and since Minton/CoS only were interested in getting the NAMES of the
&gt; cast and crew, the Judge allowed the books to be given to Minton with
&gt; the NAMES redacted from the records. Minton/CoS didn't like that and
&gt; demanded the names---even though they were offerred the full set of
&gt; books and records. It was at that time it was pointed out that the LLC
&gt; partnership agreement required ARBITRATION and it moved to an
&gt; APPEALS court.

&gt;&gt; The matter has been sitting for several years now, and seems that some
&gt;&gt; had hoped that, after CoS took off their injunction against the film
&gt;&gt; and the LMT, Minton would then be free to settle things with
&gt;&gt; Alexander.
&gt;&gt; It did not work out that way and my guess is because Minton wants the
&gt;&gt; matter on public record and probably does not trust using the
&gt;&gt; arbitration format since some of the 'Alexander et al' gang are kind
&gt;&gt; of cozy with some of the arbitrators on the Hillsborough County list.

&gt; OH RIGHT!  The all powerful, omnipotent Gypsy Queen controls
&gt; the entire arbitration system in a county the size of Hillsborough.
&gt; Ya, sure.  Good story. Ever thought of writing spy novels instead of
&gt; posting bullshit on a Usenet forum?

&gt; Who is your source of information on this?  OSA?  or one
&gt; of their &quot;critics&quot; who is fed their bullshit and passes it on as
&gt; the &quot;truth&quot;.

&gt;&gt; Besides, Alexander would have to pay for lawyers to go back to court
&gt;&gt; to force the arbitration and since he's had years to do this and
&gt;&gt; didn't, he must have good reasons for not. But by not forcing Minton
&gt;&gt; to arbitration via the courts, Alexander does not have to reveal all
&gt;&gt; the records Minton wants to see, nor pay for expensive legal services

&gt;&gt; So where things stand now, the movie is stalled, Minton's injunction
&gt;&gt; against the movie is still in place but the financial issues are not
&gt;&gt; going to done through civil court as Minton wanted.

&gt;&gt; Minton wanted the company financial records fully disclosed so that
&gt;&gt; the financial concerns he had about how his money was spent could be
&gt;&gt; resolved.

&gt; Yeah and you forgot to mention that if Minton wanted the records, he
&gt; could've
&gt; obtained them from the Judge all those years ago. What Minton wanted was
&gt; information of the names of the cast and crew so that the C of S could
&gt; do their
&gt; harassment of the them.

&gt; If he wanted ANY legitimate information he would've gone through
&gt; arbitration
&gt; ---not the corrupt Pinellas County courts.

&gt; How can I make it any clearer to you Mary.  Minton was OFFERED the
&gt; records
&gt; but with the names of the cast and crew redacted.  He refused!  He
&gt; wanted
&gt; the names too!  Why would Minton refuse to look at the books without the
&gt; names of the cast and crew?

&gt; Why do you keep omitting this FACT?

&gt; I don't understand why you are promoting this bullshit Mary.  What is
&gt; your
&gt; reason for distorting the facts?

&gt;&gt; I have the documents in pdf format if anyone would like to post them
&gt;&gt; online.

&gt; Nice spin job there. Please show your pdfs so we can all see how you
&gt; used
&gt; just enough of the factual documents that allowed you weave your
&gt; Scientologically-styled conspiracy theories around it to come up with
&gt; this CRAP.

&gt; Let's see....who ELSE does this....?

&gt; Oh ya, there's that RFW site.  They seem to use &quot;documents&quot; to spin
&gt; things
&gt; against Scn critics as well.  They only tell half the story.  They omit
&gt; information
&gt; that will give the entire picture.

Holy BatMan! So Pattie from Boston, hows abouts your posting the REAL
CONTRACT between Minton and TFC?  You can shout and scream, but until
and unless you post the contract(s) between Minton and TFC, then your
shouting is simple confirmation that TFCVP is paying you by the word for

That link is nothing more nor less than a red herring, designed by TFCVP
to deflect those who might ask the salient questions.  The site is the
maximum effort that TFCVP can accomplish since she is a party, legally,
to the gagged settlement agreement between the parties in the Lisa suit.

I believe that every word from TFC, or TFCVP, that appears on that site
is a strictly measured response that will not violate the settlement
agreement, whatever that is.

Others, myself included, remain adamant that Dandar and Company,

I simply object to the handling, which to me has been, and remains, obvious.

There was a low budget movie made a few years ago.  But its in lawsuit
hell and not likely to be released anytime soon or have many movie
house show it even if it is.  It would just end up on a few sites as a
DVD for sale or on U Tube.

Its time to let the movie and the Minton mess go already.  I am
hopeing someone will make a real movie based on the evil of
scientology.  That could fill seats if its done right and put out
right.

&gt; &gt; The facts are that Minton already had an injunction from years ago on
&gt; &gt; Alexander distributing the film and that injunction is still in place
&gt; &gt; because the court order on that has never been recinded.

&gt; That's a CROCK. Minton has never, to this day, gotten an injunction
&gt; against  the film. Ms. Mary Knowitall should post it if she has it, but
&gt; she
&gt; doesn't, so she  won't.

&gt; &gt; Minton won his case against Alexander  but Alexander won his appeal
&gt; &gt; that the LLC contract between them required arbitration services, not
&gt; &gt; court by jury, which is usually more costly.

&gt; &gt; It all started when Minton as a partner, sued Alexander as a partner
&gt; &gt; in the production company for access to all the accounting information
&gt; &gt; to get a final balance if any and to find out where his investment was
&gt; &gt; spent and on what. In the lower court case, Minton won the case
&gt; &gt; requiring the court to intervene and order the books be turned over by
&gt; &gt; Alexander to Minton for review. But on appeal of this case, Alexander
&gt; &gt; won on the point of having to use arbitration to resolve all the legal
&gt; &gt; matters between them.

&gt; THIS IS A CROCK. The books and records were delivered to the Judge
&gt; and since Minton/CoS only were interested in getting the NAMES of the
&gt; cast and crew, the Judge allowed the books to be given to Minton with
&gt; the NAMES redacted from the records. Minton/CoS didn't like that and
&gt; demanded the names---even though they were offerred the full set of
&gt; books and records. It was at that time it was pointed out that the LLC
&gt; partnership agreement required ARBITRATION and it moved to an
&gt; APPEALS court.

&gt; &gt; The matter has been sitting for several years now, and seems that some
&gt; &gt; had hoped that, after CoS took off their injunction against the film
&gt; &gt; and the LMT, Minton would then be free to settle things with
&gt; &gt; Alexander.
&gt; &gt; It did not work out that way and my guess is because Minton wants the
&gt; &gt; matter on public record and probably does not trust using the
&gt; &gt; arbitration format since some of the 'Alexander et al' gang are kind
&gt; &gt; of cozy with some of the arbitrators on the Hillsborough County list.

&gt; OH RIGHT!  The all powerful, omnipotent Gypsy Queen controls
&gt; the entire arbitration system in a county the size of Hillsborough.
&gt; Ya, sure.  Good story. Ever thought of writing spy novels instead of
&gt; posting bullshit on a Usenet forum?

&gt; Who is your source of information on this?  OSA?  or one
&gt; of their &quot;critics&quot; who is fed their bullshit and passes it on as
&gt; the &quot;truth&quot;.

&gt; &gt; Besides, Alexander would have to pay for lawyers to go back to court
&gt; &gt; to force the arbitration and since he's had years to do this and
&gt; &gt; didn't, he must have good reasons for not. But by not forcing Minton
&gt; &gt; to arbitration via the courts, Alexander does not have to reveal all
&gt; &gt; the records Minton wants to see, nor pay for expensive legal services
&gt; &gt; to defend his wishes.

&gt; &gt; So where things stand now, the movie is stalled, Minton's injunction
&gt; &gt; against the movie is still in place but the financial issues are not
&gt; &gt; going to done through civil court as Minton wanted.

&gt; &gt; Minton wanted the company financial records fully disclosed so that
&gt; &gt; the financial concerns he had about how his money was spent could be
&gt; &gt; resolved.

&gt; Yeah and you forgot to mention that if Minton wanted the records, he
&gt; could've
&gt; obtained them from the Judge all those years ago. What Minton wanted was
&gt; information of the names of the cast and crew so that the C of S could
&gt; do their
&gt; harassment of the them.

&gt; If he wanted ANY legitimate information he would've gone through
&gt; arbitration
&gt; ---not the corrupt Pinellas County courts.

&gt; How can I make it any clearer to you Mary.  Minton was OFFERED the
&gt; records
&gt; but with the names of the cast and crew redacted.  He refused!  He
&gt; wanted
&gt; the names too!  Why would Minton refuse to look at the books without the
&gt; names of the cast and crew?

&gt; Why do you keep omitting this FACT?

&gt; I don't understand why you are promoting this bullshit Mary.  What is
&gt; your
&gt; reason for distorting the facts?

&gt; &gt; I have the documents in pdf format if anyone would like to post them
&gt; &gt; online.

&gt; Nice spin job there. Please show your pdfs so we can all see how you
&gt; used
&gt; just enough of the factual documents that allowed you weave your
&gt; Scientologically-styled conspiracy theories around it to come up with
&gt; this CRAP.

&gt; Let's see....who ELSE does this....?

&gt; Oh ya, there's that RFW site.  They seem to use &quot;documents&quot; to spin
&gt; things
&gt; against Scn critics as well.  They only tell half the story.  They omit
&gt; information
&gt; that will give the entire picture.

Patty, I don't know why you have not been informed about this
injunction Minton won in freezing the assets ( The Profit being one of
them) until all matters are resolved. It's public record, the
information has been posted before and it's one of the reasons why the
film is not out allowed to be made public.

I don't have time today to get into the rest of your post but I hope
you will read the following and go look at the documents first before
replying here, it would make things easier for both of us.

Below is the information on the injunction. The  part stating:

'MANDATE REVERSING &amp; REMANDING OR12878PG0554-006' comes from
Alexander's Appeal for compelling arbitration instead of the courts
regarding the records issue. You can see the complete Appeal ruling
after the case information on the Injunction case below.

I can email you the 4 pdf files of each page of the Injunction and the
complete Appeal order or you can view them all and save the pdf's

Petitioner Peter Alexander seeks a writ of certiorari to compel

agreement under which they formed a company to develop a feature-
length motion picture. Because the trial court's nonfinal order denies
a claim of entitlement to arbitration, we deem this a 1 Section
608.4101(2), Florida Statutes (2002), also provides this right: A
limited liability company shall provide members and their agents and
attorneys access to its records at the limited liability company's
principal office or other reasonable locations specified in the
operating agreement. . . . The right
of access provides the opportunity to inspect and copyrecords during

&gt; Petitioner Peter Alexander seeks a writ of certiorari to compel

&gt; with Respondent Robert Minton based on a contract, the operating

&gt; nonfinal appeal pursuant to Florida Rule of Appellate Procedure
&gt; 9.130(a)(3)(C)(iv), rather than a petition for certiorari. Finding
&gt; merit in Mr. Alexander's arguments, we reverse.

&gt; In February 2000, Mr. Alexander and Mr. Minton formed a company called
&gt; Courage Productions, LLC, to develop, produce, market, and distribute
&gt; a motion picture tentatively titled &quot;The Profit.&quot; Based on his
&gt; experience in the motion picture industry, Mr. Alexander was generally
&gt; to provide the &quot;know-how&quot; for the limited liability company (the LLC)
&gt; and Mr. Minton was to provide the financing, although during the life
&gt; of the
&gt; company Mr. Alexander apparently invested substantial sums of money in
&gt; the project, too. The motion picture was to be part of Mr. Minton's
&gt; continuing efforts to discredit the Church of Scientology. To the
&gt; surprise of many, in April 2002, Mr. Minton announced his intention to
&gt; resolve all his differences with the Church. Soon thereafter, invoking
&gt; his rights under the operating agreement, he petitioned for an
&gt; injunction and other equitable relief against Mr. Alexander and sought
&gt; to restrain him from alienating, assigning, or hiding the assets of
&gt; the company, directly or indirectly, until an accounting could be
&gt; conducted and the assets of the LLC equitably divided. Section 8.2 of
&gt; the agreement provides that each party has the right, upon reasonable
&gt; request, &quot;for purposes reasonably related to the interest of that
&gt; [party],&quot; to inspect and copy any of the
&gt; company's books and records, and any party may require a review and or
&gt; audit.1
&gt; - 3 -
&gt; Concluding that Mr. Minton's new-found friendly attitude toward the
&gt; Church provided an ulterior motive for the litigation, Mr. Alexander
&gt; feared the motion picture would never see the light of day, or of a
&gt; film projector, thereby destroying his substantial personal investment
&gt; of time, effort, and money in the project. As soon as practicable
&gt; after being served with suit, Mr. Alexander moved to compel
&gt; arbitration, but his motion was ultimately denied. Mr. Minton advances
&gt; a variety of arguments to support the circuit court's denial of
&gt; arbitration, none of which has merit. When a court is presented with a
&gt; motion to compel arbitration, three questions must be answered: Is
&gt; there in existence a valid, written agreement containing an
&gt; arbitration clause? Does an arbitrable issue exist? Has the right to
&gt; arbitration been waived? Pulte Home Corp. v. Smith, 823 So. 2d 305
&gt; (Fla. 2d DCA 2002). The LLC's operating agreement is the contract
&gt; between these parties and has a broad and clearly stated arbitration
&gt; clause, which affirmatively answers the first question. Section 11.5
&gt; provides: &quot;Any controversy or dispute arising out of or relating to
&gt; this Agreement or the breach thereof, shall be settled by binding
&gt; arbitration in Hillsborough County, Florida, conducted in accordance
&gt; with the rules existing at the date thereof of the AFMA [American Film
&gt; Marketing Association].&quot;

&gt; Neither party disputes that the contract to form and operate the LLC
&gt; was validly entered into and is currently in effect. As to whether
&gt; there is an arbitrable issue, the operating agreement gives each party
&gt; to the agreement the right to inspect the books and records of the
&gt; company,
&gt; but Mr. Alexander has raised numerous defenses to Mr. Minton's
&gt; unfettered access.
&gt; Primarily, Mr. Alexander claims that Mr. Minton's actions are inimical
&gt; to the LLC's best interests and to his duty and loyalty to the company
&gt; required by section 608.4225,Florida Statutes (2002), because he has
&gt; now aligned himself with the adversary. We
&gt; - 4 -
&gt; conclude that an arbitrable issue exists in the unfettered access to
&gt; the LLC's records and sole asset, the motion picture itself, and
&gt; therefore is &quot;related to&quot; the operating agreement. See § 682.02, Fla.
&gt; Stat. (2002) (providing that agreement or provision to arbitrate shall
&gt; be valid, enforceable, and irrevocable without regard to the
&gt; justiciable character of the controversy).

&gt; Mr. Minton counters that his statutory right to such access in an LLC,
&gt; provided him by section 608.423, trumps the contract and, in effect,
&gt; nullifies the existence of the arbitrable issue. We cannot agree.
&gt; Section 608.423 merely states that no operating agreement of any LLC
&gt; may &quot;unreasonably restrict the right to information or access to
&gt; records&quot; of the LLC. The operating agreement at issue here does not
&gt; unreasonably restrict such access. Moreover, Florida favors
&gt; arbitration to settle disputes outside the courtroom. Healthcomp
&gt; Evaluation Servs. Corp. v. O'Donnell, 817 So. 2d 1095 (Fla. 2d DCA
&gt; 2002). To accede to Mr. Minton's argument would abrogate this public
&gt; policy in the context of LLCs, which are wholly creatures
