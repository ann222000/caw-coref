ES330 is gone...

My 2004 ES330 is gone... had one too many close calls with the hesitating
tranny...  Another left turn, tried to hit the gas, and the car rolls SLOWLY
into the intersection, only to surge and spin the tires in last second...
the ES was a nice car, but it's an unsafe car. Originally bought it for my
wife, but she was so afraid of driving it, she used my 4runner while I got
stuck with the ES...

Please do notify the feds and Lexus and your state attorney general. Perhaps
this is really some sort of terrorist activity in the Lexus plants? Hmmm ....

What I first read this, I thought that you might have totaled it.

So, I gather you're saying you intend to sell it.  Any chance you'll
calm down and change your mind?  What would you buy instead?  Does you
wife want to get rid of it, too?

I've gotten so used to the ES's quirky tranny that I don't even notice
it anymore.  I have a pretty light foot anyway, so I've learned to
tickle the throttle rather than to poke it.  It's much more responsive
when you touch it slightly until it engages and then push it once you
feel it's engaged.  Ironically, this "intelligent" tranny has "trained"
me rather than the other way around!

I went in for my (free) 5,000 mile service today.  I asked the service
rep if there's any fix planned for the hesitating tranny.  He said no
and that Lexus says it's operating as designed.  I gave him a "yeah
right" look and he shrugged his shoulders.

Do you mind my asking:

(a) What year was it, how many miles did it have and how much did you
get for it (I'm curious to about the resale value) and what type of
buyer did you sell it to (private owner, new car dealer, used car
dealer, etc.)?, and

(b)  what kind of car did you, or will you, get instead?

This is embarrassing... but I got a 2005 Sienna -- named the Lexus of Mini
vans.. Since I can now get my 4 runner (2003) from my wife, she can have the
sienna... It's AWD, loaded. I bought the Lexus (2004) for $35,000 - dealer
gave me 29k for it, and took $3600 of the MSRP on the Sienna. The lexus had
4500 miles on it when I sold it. Sienna has the navigation, dvd player, etc.
It feels like the lexus in terms of quality, plus with the kids, it's easier
to put a 2 year old in the car seat.  I am also aware that the sienna has
the fly by wire acceleration, but I asked everyone, scanned news groups, and
the problems are not there. I think that the ES330 acceleration issue can be
fixed with software and I have not lost faith in Lexus. I will be looking at
the LS430 in about 5 years. Or maybe the GX...

In Outlook Express 6 (and maybe v5) you can also select said message, goto
'Message' then 'Block Sender' and click yes, then ok. This will delete all
the posts made by the poster's email address.

I will print this off and send it to the Atty Gen's office in SC. If enough of
us do this, it will get acted on even when Bush cancels the investigation at
the Federal Level.

This is a SAFETY ISSUE that Lexus has ignored for too long.  They don't
even seem to want to address the problem or admit that it's there.  A
hefty class-action lawsuit will eventually get their attention.  They
will eventually address this issue when it hits them in the
pocketbook....when no body wants to buy their defective cars anymore
because of this issue.

Can the attorney general really do something about it? Maybe everybody
who bought a Lexus in NY should complain. I bet Spitzer would do
something.
