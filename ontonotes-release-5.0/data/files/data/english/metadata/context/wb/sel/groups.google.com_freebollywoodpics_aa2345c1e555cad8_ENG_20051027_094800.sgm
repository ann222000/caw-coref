Welcome to Buffalosjokes and Thank You for joining us. My
name is Buffalo and I have the watch.

I have been watching the Sonic ads recently especially the one for a:

Tuscan Grilled Chicken Sandwich

For a unique taste with a little Italian flair, try the
new Tuscan Grilled Chicken sandwich. A tender, grilled
chicken breast with asiago cheese, crisp lettuce, ripe
tomato and savory pesto mayonnaise served on our new
toasted ciabatta bread. Enjoy a little old world flavor.

To the Italians in the herd this is probably all familiar
ingredients but frankly I am still trying to get used to
the Jumbo Jack having Monterey Jack cheese in it and now
I am supposed to embrace a whole new cheese. Whatever
happened to the good old days when the only white cheese
was Swiss and Italian cheese came in a green shaker.

Pesto I understand, basil, garlic, pine nuts, olive oil,
and parmesan cheese, all ground up into a sauce. But mix it
with mayo? All my senses say stay away from green mayo.

Last but not least was the Ciabatta Bread which I found out
is Italian for slipper from the shape. I can't tell if that
is a biga Ciabatta which is a hard roll or a poolish Ciabatta
which is a softer spongier bread but from the picture it is
round like a hamburger bun not long like a slipper or the French
Baguette that I familiarized myself with sampling the cuisine
at Arby's 2.99 French Dip sale.

I won't stop at just picking on Sonic for coming out with all
the new food terms, let's talk about subway. Last year they
came out with a Southwestern Chipotle steak sandwich which was
delicious but I didn't have a clue what a chipotle was and knowing
what chips are I wasn't sure whether I wanted to ask but curiosity
got the best of me and I looked it up. A chipotle is a smoked,
dried, jalapeno pepper. The Chipotle has been around since before the
Aztecs. (  )

That concludes today's lesson in gourmet dining and you all
passed the test . Enjoy the chipotles I mean chips

Wife Chips
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

(Some of the males in the herd can probably relate to many of these)

SOMETHING ABOUT WIVES. .

My wife dresses to kill. She also cooks the same way.
-Henny Youngman

My wife and I were happy for twenty years. Then we met. -Rodney
Dangerfield

A good wife always forgives her husband when she's wrong. -Milton Berle

I bought my wife a new car. She called and said, &quot;There's water in the
carburetor.&quot; I asked her, &quot;Where's the car?&quot; She replied, &quot;In the lake.&quot;
-Henny Youngman

The secret of a happy marriage remains a secret.
-Henny Youngman

After a quarrel, a wife said to her husband,
&quot;You know, I was a fool when I married you.&quot;
The husband replies,
&quot;Yes, dear, but I was in love and didn't notice.&quot;

Wives are hard to figure out. They love lingerie. They love going to
gargae sales. But they sure don't seem to like getting garage-sale
lingerie as a gift.

When a man steals your wife, there is no better revenge than to let him
keep her.

I haven't spoken to my wife in 18 months - I don't like to interrupt
her.

My girlfriend told me I should be more affectionate. So I went and got
myself two girlfriends.

A man said his credit card was stolen but he decided not to report it
since the thief was spending much less than his wife did.

Man is incomplete until he is married. Then he is finished.

I found the neatest way to make my wife a more careful and defensive
driver. I pointed out to her that if she's ever in an accident, the
paper's gonna print her real age.

I've been in love with the same woman for48 years. If my wife ever finds
out, she'll kill me.

I asked my wife where she wanted to go for our anniversary. She said,

&quot;Somewhere I have never been!&quot;

I told her, &quot;How about the kitchen?&quot;

All my wife does is shop--once she was sick for a week and three stores
went under.

My wife was at the beauty shop for two hours. And that was only for the
estimate!

I came home, the car was in the dining room.

&quot;How did you get the car in here?&quot; I asked.

&quot;I took a left at the kitchen.,&quot; she replied.

Code Chips
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Having just completed my training as the hospital's switchboard
operator, I was reasonably confident that I knew all the codes for
emergencies:

Code Blue for cardiac arrest, Code Red for fire, etc.

My first night on the job alone, however, a nurse phoned and asked me to
page a &quot;Code Brown, Room 214.&quot;

I had no idea what that was.

I called the page, then searched frantically through my emergency
manual, but I couldn't find any description of it anywhere.

Stumped, I finally called the nurse back and asked her about it.

&quot;Relax,&quot; laughed the nurse. &quot;Code Brown is what us nurses page when a
patient is discharged and leaves behind an unfinished box of
chocolates!&quot;

A husband went to buy a birthday gift for his wife. Some friends had
been
invited over that night to celebrate her fortieth, and he wanted to get
something special. At the store he spotted some cute little music boxes.
One blue one was playing &quot;Happy Birthday.&quot;
Thinking they were all the same, he chose a red one and had it
gift-wrapped.
Later, at dinner, he gave it to his wife and asked her to open it. When
she
lifted the lid, out came the tune to &quot;The Old Gray Mare, She Ain't What
She
Used to Be!&quot;

~~~

I was trying to get my seventh-grade history class to understand how the
Indians must
have felt when they first encountered the Spanish explorers. &quot;How would
you
feel,&quot; I
asked, &quot;if someone showed up on your doorstep who looked very different,
spoke a
strange language and wore unusual clothes? Wouldn't you be a bit
scared?&quot;
&quot;Nah,&quot; one boy answered, &quot;I'd just figure it was my sister's date.&quot;

~~~~~

A guy gets shipwrecked. When he wakes up, he`s on a beach. The sand is
purple. He
can`t believe it. The sky is purple. He walks around a bit and sees that
there is
purple grass, purple birds and purple fruit on the purple trees. He`s
shocked when he
finds that his skin is starting to turn purple too.
&quot;Oh no!!&quot; he says, &quot;I think I`ve been marooned!!&quot;

CHOIR PROFICIENCY TEST

In order to measure your level of proficiency as a choir member, the
following test has been carefully developed by experts. Read and
reflect on each situation and then select the option that will enhance
the quality of the performance.

1. You are entering the choir loft on Sunday morning and suddenly trip
and fall down. You should:
a. Assume a kneeling position and break into fervent prayer.
b. Pretend that you've had a heart attack.
c. Crawl into the nearest chair.
d. Begin speaking in tongues.

2. You are a soprano and count incorrectly. As a result you boom out
a high &quot;C&quot; one measure too soon. You should:
a. Slide into an inspired &quot;O For a Thousand Tongues to Sing.&quot;
b. Look triumphant and hold on to the note.
c. Stop abruptly in mid squawk but keep your lips moving.
d. Sink to the floor in shame.

3. After all those long hard choir rehearsals, you show up twenty
minutes late for the Christmas musical. You should:
a. Climb into the back row of the choir from the baptistery.
b. Enter pretending to be a soundman checking cables and then
suddenly slip yourself into the choir.
c. Turn the lights out in the church and slip into the choir
during the blackout.
d. Read M. Stephen's pamphlet &quot;Techniques for Tardy
Appearances.&quot;

4. While singing, you discover you have only one page of a two page
hymn. You should:
a. Hum for your life.
b. Sing &quot;watermelon, watermelon, watermelon.&quot;
c. Try to get another hymnal out of the choir rack with your
feet.
d. Sing the first page over again.

5. Inevitably that dreaded big sneeze occurs toward the end of the
choir special. You should:
a. As you sneeze, come down hard on your neighbor's foot to
create a diversion.
b. Try to make it harmonize.
c. Sneeze into the hair of the choir member in front of you to
muffle the noise.
d. Sink to the floor in shame.

Count the number of A's, B's, C's, and D's you checked and find your
proficiency rating below:

4 or more A's...there is nothing more you need to know to be a first
rate choir member.
4 or more B's...your church choir reflexes are fully developed and you
should do well in choir.
4 or more C's...your church choral experience is spotty but your team
spirit is on target. You will be an asset to most any choir.
4 or more D's...it is recommended you take soccer or group therapy
counseling.

Seasick Chips
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Bernie had never been on a deep-sea fishing boat before,
and he was now thinking it was the stupidest thing he'd
ever done in his life. Who would ever have believed that
seasickness could be this awful?

With every pitch and roll, Bernie wondered how he was
going to survive the remaining two hours of the trip.

One of the deckhands came up to him and said, &quot;Don't worry,
young fella. Nobody ever died of seasickness.&quot;

&quot;Oh noooo!!&quot; Bernie wailed... &quot;You've just taken away my
last hope for relief!&quot;

The first graders were attending their first music lesson. The teacher
was
trying to begin at the beginning. She drew a musical staff on the
blackboard and asked a little girl to come up and write a note on it.
The little girl went to the blackboard, looked thoughtful for a minute
and
wrote, &quot;Dear Aunt Emma, just a short note to tell you I'm fine.&quot;

~~~~~

I remember when I got married.
I remember where I got married.
But for the life of me,
I can't remember why I got married.

~~~

Senior Moments happen to men too. My girlfriend, a beautician, had three
customers from the same family at the same time. One day when they were
all
there, the dad, the mom, and the daughter, the old man was finished
first.
He said he'd just go out and sit in the car until his wife and daughter
were
done. &quot;Aren't you going to take him out to the car?&quot; the daughter asked
her
mom when the old man started out the door.
&quot;No, I'm not,&quot; the mom replied. &quot;He can certainly get into the car by
himself!&quot; It was true. When the two women came out, he was in the back
seat of the car..the wrong car!

Two truck drivers, Ralph and Cletus, who
drove as a team, were interviewing for a job
at a new trucking company. Many questions
were asked, and answered, with Ralph doing
most of the talking as Cletus never had much
to say.

The interview was coming to a close with one
more question. &quot;Ralph, you're driving in the
mountains in Colorado. You're going down a
very steep grade with a very sharp curve at the
bottom. All of a sudden, your brakes quit. What
do you do?&quot;

Ralph scratched his chin for a bit, then said,
&quot;I'd wake up Cletus.&quot;

The interviewer was puzzled and asked &quot;Why
wake up Cletus?&quot;

Ralph replied, &quot;Because he ain't never seen a
wreck like we're fixin to have!&quot;

It's time to tell Congress to stop hurting your healthcare
Did you know that your family's healthcare is in jeopardy and it's up to
you to ProtectYourHealthcare   ?
Right now, Congress is creating a 'new' kind of health insurance - with
no protections, no guarantees and no limits on prices. Under
Washington's plan, insurers won't be required to keep money in the bank
to pay your claims, but they will be able to raise your rates when you
get sick - or whenever they want. Worst of all, insurers will also take
away every single health protection you have in your state, from direct
access to your OB/GYN to your right to appeal. Visit
and tell Congress to stop hurting
your healthcare now!

In promulgating your esoteric cogitations or articulating your
superficial
sentimentalities, and amicable philosophical or psychological
observations,
beware of platitudinous ponderosity.
Let your conversational communications possess a compacted
conciseness, a
clarified comprehensibility, a coalescent cogency, and a
concatenated
consistency.

Eschew obfuscation and all conglomeration of flatulent
garrulity, jejune
babblement, and asinine affectations.

Let your extemporaneous descanting and unpremeditated
expatiations have
intelligibility and voracious vivacity without rodomontade or
thrasonical
bombast.

Sedulously avoid all polysyllabic profundity, pompous
prolificacy, and vain
vapid verbosity.

In short: &quot;Be brief and don't use big words.&quot;

Winters are fierce in the north of Scotland where the Laird lives, so as
owner of the estate he felt he was doing a good deed when he bought
earmuffs
for his outdoors foreman. However, after a week or so he noticed that
the
foreman wasn't wearing the earmuffs even
on the bitterest day, so the Laird asked, &quot;Did ye not like the ear-muffs
I gave ye?&quot;

The Foreman said, &quot;Aye, Sir, they're a thing of both utility and
beauty.&quot;

&quot;Why do ye not wear 'em then, Mon?&quot;

The Foreman explained, &quot;I was wearing 'em the fust day, Sir, and a

I bet ya' didn't know
The crocodile attack to claim the most human lives took place on
February 19, 1945, when an Imperial Japanese Army unit guarding a
stronghold on the Burmese island of Ramree was outflanked by a
British naval force. The soldiers were forced to cross 16 km
(10 miles) of mangrove swamps to rejoin a larger battalion of the
Japanese infantry. The swamps were home to thousands of 4.6-m
(15-ft) saltwater crocodiles. Come the next morning, only 20 of
the 1,000 Japanese soldiers had survived.

BJ: Everyone into the UFO/Time Machine!

Diana: What about Rudy?

BJ: We will hover and pick him up. If we don't take off we will get
crushed.

The UFO takes off and BJ flys back to the end of the herd where
Rudy is riding on the back of a White Buffalo.

BJ: Rudy get your tail in here.

Rudy: I am having a great time Dad.

BJ: Things are going to get wild really fast.

Rudy: Why?

BJ: I see some buffalo hunters on the ridge and once things start,
there will be a stampede and you will be gone for maybe 20 miles
before you stop. So jump and jump now.

Rudy: Oh all right!

With a leap he is in the UFO.

A volley of shots and the buffalo start to fall. Rudy watches the
slaughter.... tears form in his eyes.

Rudy: Why Dad? Why? They are killing more than they can eat.

BJ: People are not logical at times Rudy. I wish I had a better
explanation. Let's turn this to Texas.

To be continued
