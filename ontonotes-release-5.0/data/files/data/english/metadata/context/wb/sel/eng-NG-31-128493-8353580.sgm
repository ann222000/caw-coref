He stuck a loaded pistol in the face of a soldier sick  with malaria
in a military hospital, and then knocked him across the room.  Didn't
feel he was sick enough, apparently.  Definitely, a Bush-Cheney kind

Curious, how he was removed from his command for this kind of
incident, and, ultimately, had an unexplained, &quot;freak accident&quot;
resulting in his death.  Could history repeat itself?  Definitely, a
Bush-Cheney kind of guy...

Really?  When and where did Patton serve in an area with malaria?

Let me guess - you think that the portrayal of Patton in the movie was
accurate, right?

Private Paul G. Bennett was a simple 21-year-old farm boy from South
Carolina. He had enlisted in the Regular Army before Pearl Harbor, and had
served with impersonal distinction in the 105th Field Artillery Battalion in
North Africa and Sicily. When his wife gave birth to their first baby he
became restless, and when she sent him a picture of her and the baby he
began to show symptoms of acute nervouse tension. A front-line psychiatrist
diagnosed his condition as a case of anxiety neurosis - &quot;a passing
disturbance of his mind regarding some uncertain event&quot; - probably caused by
&quot;fear that he would not be able to see his newborn baby before he died.&quot;
Bennett's condition became aggravated on August 6, 1943, when his best buddy
in C Battery was wounded in action at his side. He could not sleep that
night because, as he put it, the shells going over had &quot;bothered&quot; him. &quot;I
keep thinking they're going to land on me,&quot; he kept saying. On August 7th he
became increasingly tense and showed morbid concern for his wounded friend.
An aid man then sent him to the rear echelon, where he was given some
sedative. But it did not seem to do him any good as he remained badly
disturbed.

On the morning of August 10th, a medical officer ordered him to the 93rd
Evacuation Hospital, even though &quot;Bennett begged not to be evacuated because
he did not want to leave his unit.&quot; It would be a tragic coincidence that
Bennett would arrive at the 93rd just a few minutes before the arrival of
the commander of the U.S. Seventh Army, General George S. Patton, Jr.

For Patton, the first 17 days of August 1943, were among the most difficult
and stressful of his Army career. It was during this time that his Seventh
Army was making its advance from Palermo to Messina in his unofficial race
with British General Montgomery.

The trouble began on August 1st, when the U.S. 1st Infantry Division pushed
boldly into a barren depression between Cerami and Troina. The day before
Patton had issued his directive for the major attack. II Corps under General
Omar Bradley, with the 1st, 3rd and 9th Divisions and supporting units, was
to make the main effort along highways 113 and 120 from the line San
Stefano-Mistretta-Nicosia. On the south flank, the 1st Division quickly
captured Cerami and advanced to within five miles of Troina, which was the
pivot of German resistance. A German counterattack then threw the Big Red
One back to its line of depature. Though Bradley defended the division's
commander, General Terry Allen, Patton was becoming increasingly frustrated
by Allen's own rugged individualism and this was just the beginning of a
crises that would see Allen relieved of his command before the 1st Division
would get to Messina.

There was more bad news. General Troy Middleton's 45th Division was stalled
before San Stefano. The air support Patton's ground troops were getting was
spotty, and only too often the American planes were bombing their own
troops. Worst of all, virtually every one of his divisions was painfully
reduced in strength. Then came the big air raid by the Germans and Italians
on Palermo.

On the 2nd the news continued to be bad. The advance of the 3rd Division
under Lucian Truscott was slowed by mines and demolitions. Allen's 1st
failed to envelop Troina due to stiff German resistance. On the 3rd Patton
left Palermo and established his new headquarters behind Cerami where Allen
had his 1st Division CP. In front of Troina, as he mingled with Big Red One
troops, even his most inspired butt-kicking did not seem to work. A veteran
of two campaigns, the division had become tempermental, and even
insubordinate. Casualties had left gaping holes in the line and Patton was
told that an increasing number of the men had gone to the hospital with
nothing but combat fatigue, a form of neurosis for which he had neither
understanding nor sympathy.

On his way back from Troina to his headquarters, Patton decided to stop for
a visit at the 15th Evacuation Hospital. Whenever he felt the need to
bolster his own morale, Patton would visit the nearest hospital, because he
gained solace and inspiration from the sight of men whose badge of courage
was their wounds. It was at the 15th Evac that the first of the slapping
incidents occured. Coming across Private Charles Herman Kuhl, who appeared
to have no wounds, Patton asked him what was the matter. When Kuhl replied,
&quot;I guess I can't take it,&quot; Patton lost control of his anger. He slapped the
soldier, kicked him in the pants and cussed him. It was only after this
incident that Kuhl was found to have a temperature of 102.2º in addition to
chronic diarrhea.

Over the next few days the campaign continued to move slowly. The 1st
Division finally entered Troina on the 6th, but only because the Germans had
deserted the city. The Big Red One was then stopped cold after advancing
about a mile east of Troina. On the 8th there was some good news. A
battalion of the 30th Infantry Regiment from Truscott's 3rd Division made an
amphibious landing two miles east of Sant' Agata. By four a.m. the battalion
was firmly established 12 miles closer to Messina. Due to the success of the
landing, Patton planned a repeat performance for the morning of August 11th
at Brolo.

The 9th was another day of bad news. On August 10th Bradley called Patton
and pleaded for him to postpone the landing at Brolo because Truscott's
division was not advancing fast enough towards Brolo to be able to link up
with the battalion that would land there in a timely manner. Bradley's call
left Patton fuming and he decided to make a visit to the II Corps command
post. It was on the way that he saw a sign for the 93rd Evac. He directed
his driver to take him there.

Uh, North Africa, Sicily and Italy have swamps with Malaria in them.
Patton served in all three.  We're not talking about the Battle of the

No.  The film portrayal by George C. Scott was highly idealized.  He
was scum.  A good general, but scum.

If you think that the film 'idealized' Patton - then you obviously
never read any biographies about the man.
