US-Made Censorware Used To Oppress Burma

&quot;The Christian Science Monitor is reporting that US-made censorware is
being used to oppress the people in many countries, including Burma.
That in itself may not be surprising, but a more interesting point is
that according to lawyers interviewed by the CS Monitor it appears to
be legal â€” in spite of all the economic sanctions against the country,
and even though people know it will be used to hush up any mention of
things like attacks on peaceful protesters.&quot;

Since it's totally legal, and Burma has no monopoly on Internet access -
where's the beef?
