Think about it.  Astro-Robots don't have "love triangles".  They don't
get arrested.  They don't end up being the subject of mug shots that
make them talk show fodder.  They don't end up charged with crimes,
requiring the services of high-paid attorneys.

They don't spread gossip.  They don't become jealous.  They don't
cheat.  They have no worries or cares or needs or feelings of any
kind.

They don't die.

They don't require years of training.  They can use smaller, cheaper
rockets and spacecraft than their flawed human counterparts because
they don't breath, or eat, or drink, or think, and they don't need, or
want, to return.

They just explore.

Your argument is then, that robots are better because
they are not human?

I would have even agreed with you in another context. I
am not for human spaceflight. But using this tragedy
to remind us that robots are better is below any
measure of tasteless.

By the way, robots make better spammers, and would have done a
better job than you.

Imagine how much more Lunar/Martian exploration the U.S. could

I don't, but that is NASA's announced main purpose for its *human*
exploration program.  Mike Griffin wrote about "a new focus for the
manned space program: to go out beyond Earth orbit for purposes
of human exploration and scientific discovery."

I believe that national prestige is the main reason for government
human space programs, but I'm beginning to wonder, quite frankly,
if NASA's human astronauts are adding, or detracting, from our
national prestige.

Oops, sorry about previous post. Yes Steve, usually we disagree about
issues, political or otherwise, but on this one I must agree. We
cannot expect that astronauts not be humans. I mean we are not robots
and are fallible, vulnerable and have emotions that sometimes get the
best of us. I don't wished this happened but dammit it did. We can't
fault NASA or try and claim that it could have been prevented with
better screening , etc. It is a shame that it happened to anyone, be
they astronaut or otherwise. When people snap they snap. It could
happen to anyone. I  feel for the women's family. I'm sure that they
are taking this very hard.

Indeed, I'd love to see a space mission (especially an extended one,
like a several-month stay on a lunar base) done as a reality TV show,
where the participants are chosen not *just* for their skills (assuming
there will be plenty of skilled applicants), but also for their
photogenicity and their interpersonal dynamics.  Who's sleeping with
whom is a question just as valid off Earth as it is on it, and if it
helps gets the public to watch the show that pays for the mission, then
I'm all for it.

Best,

As Stephen Hawking pointed out, it's to prevent us putting all our eggs
in the one basket of planet Earth.  We now know we live in an unsafe
neighborhood--comets and meteorites can fall on us.  The dinosaurs got
wiped out that way, which is something nobody knew when Yuri Gagarin
first flew into space.  If humans colonize the Moon and Mars, then even
an asteroid impact that wipes out humanity on Earth won't completely
destroy our species.

When used properly, under remote human supervision,
robots can provide the same breathtaking results as an
artist's brush or a musician's instrument.

For example, humans have taken to the following photo
snapped by Mars Exploration Rover "Spirit", of a
Martian sunset.
" http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/gallery/press/spirit/20050610a/
sunset_a489_gamma_2sub_800_br.jpg"

Robert Ballard didn't discover Titantic - a remote controlled
camera sled suspended at the end of a miles-long cable
did.  But human eyes saw the transmitted images.  Initally
of unending mud, then strange debris, then china and shoes,
and finally boilers and steel plates.  Still the world credits
a human - Mr. Ballard - for the discovery.

It could be the same in space.

Two replies to your post have already mentioned "escape" from the risk
of disaster on the Earth, natural or man-made.

This is a purpose of a space program that requires human spaceflight.
Escape isn't perhaps the right word - for most of us, the only escape
is solving the problems we face here on Earth. But to ensure that even
if the problems are unmanageable - which is always a possibility -
humanity will survive has value.

To ensure freedom will survive even if a dictator establishes global
dominion in a world that grows smaller every day also has value.

Others have noted that robotic systems can fail. And they have
limitations. So it does make sense to send people to Mars for truly in-
depth study.

But there are other items not mentioned.

As has become increasingly acknowledged of late, the purpose of the
Apollo program which led to its being funded was to impress people. To
show that the future lay with the United States - not the Soviet
Union, which could boast that its schools didn't mess around with
Intelligent Design.

Who knows, maybe Apollo did prevent India from going Communist. (I
don't think it had a chance of being decisive in too many other
cases.)

Sending people to other bodies in our Solar System facilitates
colonization as opposed to exploration. Colonization, in contrast to
exploration, implies _economic productivity_. A community of humans,
supporting themselves from asteroidal and cometary materials, growing
larger, has the ability to provide resources to Earth.

Could it get to the point where all heavy industrial activity pollutes
only outer space, and Earth becomes one big national park?

Human beings, like rats, and unlike many other animal species, are
present in all corners of the Earth. They didn't avoid crossing the
Sinai peninsula to leave Africa and colonize Eurasia. They didn't
avoid crossing the Bering isthmus (when it was an isthmus) and
colonizing the Americas. It is not in their nature to turn their backs
on space when the opportunity exists to add it to human habitat.

Not just Cold War politics, but a profound emotional response,
motivates sending the first human to set foot on another planet. Not
just asteroidal iridium, or sending a few lucky colonists to survive
global warming, but an ancient biological pattern motivates us to set
sail on "this new ocean" to find new islands on which to live.

None of this is, in itself, an argument for not going more slowly. For
exploring the Solar System primarily with robots, and sending humans
much later, when it becomes cheaper with the advance of technology.

But America doesn't exist in a vacuum. If it doesn't send people to
Mars, or to an L5 colony about the Moon, it isn't necessarily France,
or Britain, or Canada, or Australia that will do it instead. These
countries, after all, are just as solicitous about taxpaying voters as
the much larger United States of America.

Do we really want the Solar System to belong to mainland China - or
North Korea? Or even Iran? It's countries like *those* that are now
old-fashioned enough to seek the prestige that manned spaceflight is
felt to provide.

In the final analysis, manned spaceflight is a way to say that what we
are is important. That we believe ourselves to represent what is best
in humanity, what is most important to survive into the future. It's
an expression of faith in ourselves, faith in freedom, liberty, and
democracy.

That is not an argument against a more balanced level of space
funding, since automated missions can produce greater scientific
return less expensively - and the new scientific knowledge is going to
be very valuable in *facilitating* other endeavours which pursue our
other goals. But it explains why manned spaceflight is important in
ways that automated missions are not.

I seriously doubt that the Earth is going to benefit from resources in

Actually, NASA is already *trying* your idea.

Most Hubble Space Telescope photos are taken as part of scientific
projects and belong - for a year - to their "principal investigators".
Only a small fraction are done as general projects getting data made
immediately available to all astronomers.

There are valid reasons why the *big* automated space projects aren't
done that way.

In any event, John Glenn and Albert Einstein basked in different kinds
of glory. Stroking some scientists' egos is not necessarily going to
cause them to become inspirations to the general public. Having
glamorous heroes is not really the "missing ingredient" that manned
spaceflight supplies - even if it might be a small part of it.

Otherwise, Hollywood could substitute for a space program.

I'm not talking about escape from an *actual* disaster - a Battlestar

That we already have. So it would only be far-sighted in the positive

My personal bias would be to dismiss the nay-saying about Apollo as

get shaken out of Congress, and few Congressmen thought like Arthur C.

You're right. Even if we did find the humblest microbes on Mars, their
"average Joe" impact would be limited.

What we aren't going to find, but we wish we could, is a stairway
leading down into the Face on Mars to an ancient library containing
the technological secrets of a long-vanished civilization, including
the key to building a fleet of FTL spacecraft so that we can all fly
to Alpha Centauri and beyond, and get away from those pesky Muslims
and/or Chinese.

On the other hand, Robert Zubrin is right that Mars is the most
practical place in the Solar System to plant a human colony with a
small investment from Earth. It *is* easier to dig a hole in the
ground - even in permafrost (which is, on Earth, rather a nasty thing
to try and dig holes in, and which is apparently the condition of the
Martian ground)  - than it is to build an O'Neill space habitat.

Mars is, however, apparently quite short of nitrogen. Extracting that
from the atmosphere would perhaps be a pre-occupation of Martian
colonists similar to how obtaining moisture was critical to farming
operations on Tattooine. So instead of shooting aluminum bars into
space, space operations involving cometary materials would become
important to Martian expansion, sooner rather than later.

Of course, I can't take credit for that one. That was Gerard O'Neill's

our local gravity well, I think that the Earth is not going to be

the right direction along the way.

My point wasn't that there wasn't enough for all.

If they go, and we don't - and, soon enough, that will become they go,
and we can't - then the result is a Universe in which 99.9% of
humanity came from North Korea - and the United States of America, one
country on one planet called Earth, even if it still existed, would be
just a historical footnote - like the Yanomamo Indians of Brazil.

But that was what my next paragraph was about:

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; In the final analysis, manned spaceflight is a way to say that what we
&gt; &gt; are is important. That we believe ourselves to represent what is best
&gt; &gt; in humanity, what is most important to survive into the future. It's
&gt; &gt; an expression of faith in ourselves, faith in freedom, liberty, and
&gt; &gt; democracy.

&gt; Well said.

&gt; &gt; That is not an argument against a more balanced level of space
&gt; &gt; funding, since automated missions can produce greater scientific
&gt; &gt; return less expensively - and the new scientific knowledge is going to
&gt; &gt; be very valuable in *facilitating* other endeavours which pursue our
&gt; &gt; other goals. But it explains why manned spaceflight is important in
&gt; &gt; ways that automated missions are not.

&gt; Yes, I have likened unmanned spaceflight to pure science which is
&gt; necessary and useful. But there is something about manned spaceflight
&gt; that is pure art and in a sense beyond mere necessity.
">

Oh, yes. Manned spaceflight does have an element that is like art -
although more in the spiritual realm than the aesthetic.

But it also relates to practical necessity.

If we *did* have magic FTL spaceships, that could be churned out in
quantity, the way Detroit makes cars, then space would serve as a
direct outlet for population pressure.

The Basques or the Armenians or the Tibetans or the Parsees or the
Maronites or the Copts could fly off to find, in a distant galaxy, an
Earth-like planet of their very own, on which they could grow to be a
nation of a hundred million people, and preserve their language and
culture forever by establishing an economic infrastructure all their
own sufficient to support making their own Hollywood-quality movies in
their own language, and writing software for an operating system
designed for their language, and so on and so forth.

On Earth as it is now, there's just no other continent to sail for
that doesn't have other people with modern guns on it. Earth is full,
and those peoples who don't have enough land to become strong
independent nations can't get it without stealing it from someone
else.

What the terrorists don't seem to realize is that however
unrepresentative they may be of the world's Muslims, in a world the
way it is now, too many people are just itching to find some excuse to
declare a big chunk of the world - such as that on which the world's
one billion Muslims reside - officially vacant so that it can be
parcelled out to solve problems, like those of the Tamils in Sri
Lanka, the East Indians in Fiji, the Ibos in Nigeria, and so on and so
forth. So we can make amends to the Hopi and the Hawaiians by letting
them join in doing to the Muslims what we once did to their ancestors.

Between things like global warming on the one hand, and the bleak
prospect of a world chasing its own tail in a cycle of terror and
genocide, getting some people off the Earth seems to be a priority,
not an extremely far-sighted ambition. If we're *lucky*, instead of a
few dozen colonists establishing the Human Race Mark II, we might
survive long enough to be able to usefully receive help from their
descendants.

Thank you for the compliment.

I should note that while I do think, for many reasons, that we *are*
on the brink of... some unpleasantness... it may well be that we will
be fortunate enough that not only won't it be the end of the world, it
may even be a "damp squib" compared to World War II, just like the
recession of the seventies was a damp squib compared to the Great
Depression.

But World War II, even if it wasn't the end of the world, came close
enough for an awful lot of people. I think we're headed belatedly for
something that could at least be called in retrospect World War III.
Maybe the postwar boom after that will be the time to go into space,
but before it starts, it's still a toss-up as to how big it will be.

It could be painful but relatively small. Or it could be big. Let's
have that Mars colony started, just in case.

I know about the Ipuwer papyrus and Charles Dickens' introductory
words to "A Tale of Two Cities". But then, I also know about the story
of the frog in the boiling water, and I know there was a 1939 World's
Fair.

We may not be DOOMED, but we do live in interesting times; that is our
curse. Chaos theory says the Kondriateff wave can come late - and you
know what happens when you just clamp down a pressure cooker. As the
Atom Bomb - and the bad name that Adolph and company gave to genocide
- have been doing for the last little while.

Right now, my gut feeling says this world is like a stick of dynamite
with a lit fuse. But demographic forces aren't as quantifiable as
fissionable isotopes strewn in the planet's core - and I have neither
a son nor a Kansas on a world orbiting a distant star of a different
color to send him to.

What is wrong with the unmanned space program? Cleary our recent

WRT Saturn. Likewise, though we have a a few schedule slips, aren't
the earth observing missions continuing to proved needed earth science

&gt; What is wrong with the unmanned space program? Cleary our recent
&gt; missions to Mars are an ongoing success. I believe that the failures
&gt; of the early 1990s have been eclipsed and are no longer the painful
&gt; losses given the recent successes. Cassini is providing good science
&gt; WRT Saturn. Likewise, though we have a a few schedule slips, aren't
&gt; the earth observing missions continuing to proved needed earth science
&gt; to the scientific community at large? Also, space telescopes, given
&gt; the success of Hubble after its initial debacle, should continue,
&gt; right?

&gt; I understand the concern of manned spaceflight after the Columbia
&gt; disaster and the ISS cost overruns, but ALL of spaceflight?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The issue isn't whether I'm &quot;better&quot; or worse.  I have my opinions
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; about why we should have a space program, but they don't really
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; matter, since they're only my opinions.  I can't demand that the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; taxpayer fund my personal interests.  Or at least I don't.  Though
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; many do.  The issue will have to be decided in a public poltical
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; debate, and it won't happen on Usenet.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Fine, avoid the issue. I'm surprised though as you tend to like giving
&gt;&gt;&gt; your opinion about a lot of other things like the war, etc.
&gt;&gt; I've offered my opinions on that subject many times, for many years.
&gt;&gt; It''s not my fault that every day is a new day to you.

&gt; Everyday being new is a wonderful thing, you should try it sometime,

If I could interject a serious comment into your clusterf**k:

The main purpose of the space program was national prestige;
specifically, a demonstration of the relative power of American rocket
and missile technology, relative to those of our potential adversaries
and competitors.

It was a cultural sublimation of the militarization of space.  Back in
the 1950's, the Air Force had the lead in America's nascent space
efforts.  But their interest was largely military, of course.  Giving
the new NASA agency the lead in space put a more humanistic face on
America's space efforts.

IIRC, back in 1960, rocket thrust and the alleged "missile gap" were
actually discussed in the Kennedy-Nixon presidential debates.  It hasn't
been an issue of national concern like that lately.  These days, we tend
to measure national prestige by other yardsticks, especially economic
productivity, and advances in computers and electronics.

Rand is basically a pompous know-it-all that refuses to listen to
others unless he deems them fit to be listen to.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

To keep up with the Russians, yes, but to also not fall behind as the
Russians were clearly leading in space via Sputnik and Gagarin.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Yet, the Russians were first. We had to catch up and keep up until we
could take the lead with Apollo.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Though Eisenhower clearly asked for NASA to be non-military. In
addition, you must look at the space program as both manned and
unmanned for a better understanding how NASA works.

Totally a non-NASA thing. Do not confuse NASA with a branch of the
DOD, it'll only make you like a right-wing Republican. :)

Which are all hollow, IMO. Sure we lead economically but computers and
electronics is no longer strictly ours as the rest of the world has
jumped on board and found their niches.

We should lead by finding alternative sources of energy other than
oil. That way we could get out of the Middle East in a big way and let
the rest of the world come to us for our new technology related to
that energy.

P.S. Don't mind Rand. He and I get into these debates and he resorts
to name calling at the drop of the hat.

My expectation is that robots will build a lunar base, mine ice, lay
down an accelerator, build a lunar chemical factory, load the
accelerator with pellets, fuel landers with hydrogen and oxygen, move
the landers into a shelter,  etc. These robots (including backhoe
diggers, pile drivers, bull dozers, dump trucks, forklift trucks etc)
will be part autonomous, part remote controlled from Earth.

But humans will be there to fix them. And occasionally to turn a
screw, tie a knot, re-point an antenna, and anything else the robots
can't do. The robots will, power permitting, work full time, guided by
shift worker on Earth.

The astronauts will be the most glorified mechanics ever (with the
occasional geologist and doctor). NASA will need to tear up its
recruitment policies and scour the world for the best mechanics who
can fix the robots blindfolded and work 12 hours a day.
