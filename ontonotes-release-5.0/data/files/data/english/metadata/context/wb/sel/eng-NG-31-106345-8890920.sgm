Gee, maybe capitalism isn't the solution for everything, and maybe people should be regarded as more than mere &quot;resources&quot; or &quot;products&quot;.

The problem here as I see it is twofold.

First, you've set up capitalism in your mind with an expectation of
perfection. If it doesn't reach that level in actuality, then it gets
roundly criticized with the implication that other forms of economy
are therefore better than capitalism. Meanwhile Capitalism is merely
excellent, not perfect. It's imperfection does NOT make socialism or
socialized medicine a better solution.

Btw, if you don't want to pay someone to take care of you when you're
ill, expect no one to show up on most occasions.

Second, I cured myself of Stage 4 cancer for about $10 nine years ago.
The reason this method isn't widely available isn't due to capitalism,
but due to the over regulation of the practice of medicine.

Socializing medicine would not improve the situation. Rather it would
ossify the regulation that's already in place.

I heard something just last night that gave me a new angle. The
concept that anything that evolves (devolves?) into an orthodoxy is
ultimately doomed. That applies to every human endeavour. Religions,
political views, science, whatever ... as soon as it decides on a set
of &quot;fundamental&quot; rules, it is then locked into them. No room allowed
to adapt to changing circumstances. To suggest different would be...
well, heretical. Over time problems change and even solutions to
problems change and inevitably come into conflict with the rules in
place. Any entity that attains a strict orthodoxy closes off any
dissent, debate, or reinterpretation ceases to progress and ultimately
stagnates as the world around it changes.

That may be what some people do, however not everyone. I don't expect a
capitalistic system to be perfect but I also don't expect it to be the
best solution for the distribution of all products/services.

Personally, I look at the cost differences to the community that uses a
more capitalistic system vs one that uses a more socialistic system (in
this case countries.) All of the industrialized nations in the world
(for example the G8 nations) have adequate health care systems, yet the
most capitalistic system spends the most per capita on its system (by
far.)

Thing is, &quot;orthodox capitalism&quot; goes a lot farther towards identifying
that as a problem. What's kind of lousy is when people identify
non-capitalist compromises (or outright abuses) as an inherent part of
capitalism. It's not.

Medicine was doled out pay-as-you-go forever. It was kind of
heartless, too - the &quot;red shoes&quot; story from Loretta Lynn :
http://www.seeklyrics.com/lyrics/Loretta-Lynn/Little-Red-Shoes.html
is rather foreign to us, now. It wasn't unusual at all.

Please remember - the people who started the &quot;cold heartless
capitalist&quot; meme, other than outright Marxists, were largely
capitalists of a different stripe. Anybody says Hearst
wasn't a capitalist....

The Marxists were wrong, but they couldn't have known that
easily.

But when people overtly reject capitalist solutions to
problems, they're left with the problem of what to replace
them with. It's harder than it looks. Effectively, it
involves what a person who understands capitalism would
refer to as a subsidy. That, bby the way, is how we got
into this mess to begin with.

It's not that common. SFAIK, capitalism is not an easy
factor to show as a cause of mental illness. I just
suspect that when people attack capitalism, they're
really attacking reason. I can relate to that, but it's
always something that's hard to defend.

&quot;Science&quot; didn't say that. That would be my point. Science is
a method; a process. It allows for rejection of current dogma
in favor of new and exciting dogma-to-be.

The parts that do not allow for that are not science.

&gt; &gt; &gt; I heard something just last night that gave me a new angle. The
&gt; &gt; &gt; concept that anything that evolves (devolves?) into an orthodoxy is
&gt; &gt; &gt; ultimately doomed. That applies to every human endeavour. Religions,
&gt; &gt; &gt; political views, science, whatever ... as soon as it decides on a set
&gt; &gt; &gt; of &quot;fundamental&quot; rules, it is then locked into them. No room allowed
&gt; &gt; &gt; to adapt to changing circumstances. To suggest different would be...
&gt; &gt; &gt; well, heretical. Over time problems change and even solutions to
&gt; &gt; &gt; problems change and inevitably come into conflict with the rules in
&gt; &gt; &gt; place. Any entity that attains a strict orthodoxy closes off any
&gt; &gt; &gt; dissent, debate, or reinterpretation ceases to progress and ultimately
&gt; &gt; &gt; stagnates as the world around it changes.

&gt; &gt; If 1) capitalism depends on economics as its intellectual skeleton ( and
&gt; &gt; I don't see how it cannot ) and economics is a science, then capitalism
&gt; &gt; can never be an orthodoxy. Them's big ifs, but if it's not an
&gt; &gt; empirically defensible postion, then that's a Problem.

&gt; &gt; Political movements that embrace capitalism *can* be orthodoxies, but
&gt; &gt; that's a separate problem.

Nonsense. From early on when the atom was discovered system were

Which all sciences do. What people who are not scientist do not
understand is that there are standards. So, the guy who just says
travel beyond light speed is possible is not looked at seriously. The
guy who takes time to study the question and produce a model showing
that travel beyond light speed is listened if the science is sound. It
moves forward when it is empirically tested.

For instance, people say they have seen big foot. Science wants the
ability to say where and be able to go there and see it too. This has
yet to be done. So science doesn't say bigfoot exist or it doesn't
exist. It is silent because there is no proof. A scientist may very
well say he does not BELIEVE bigfoot exist because of the years of
stories and no evidence. He is not making a scientific judgment. A
scientific judgment would say the evidence indicates bigfoot doesn't
exist. Things like the inability to find remains, or to go back to a
site and see it again, or even ideas about if the area could produce
the right food supply for such a creature may seem to indicate
something does not exist. That is much more scientific.

Carl Sagan once stated (on his 1980s &quot;Cosmos&quot; TV series) that the
first known &quot;Earth-is-round&quot; insight and size calculation
occurred in ancient Persia, or somewhere around there.  And that
it involved measuring the distance between two cities, and
comparing the shadows from sticks in the ground, at the same time
of day.  Which suggested that the sun was shining from different
angles in different places, and that the surface of the Earth was
curved.

And, as I understand it, by the late 15th century, most of the
educated people in Europe were aware of the situation.  While
many lower-class folks still assumed that Earth was flat.

Anyway, ISTR that Columbus had an initial rejection of funding
due to differing calculations.

His estimate was that the Earth was much smaller than the true
circumference.  So he believed that the westward distance from
Europe to India was much shorter, and therefore a viable trip.

Whereas, a better calculation indicated how far it really is.
And the rejection was based on the idea that Columbus and
crew would die long before covering the needed distance. Not by
falling off the Earth, but, rather, by
starvation/dehydration/exhaustion, or by accident (more time
sailing means more chance of encountering a bad storm on the
trip), or whatever regular dangers of long-distance travel.
Since there wasn't any reason to assume any land mass (I.e. the
Americas.)  And for all anybody knew, it might just be continuous
ocean all the way to India.

Magellan's later circumnavigation did actually have his crew in
serious danger of starvation and heavy vitamin deficiency.

At least one source I read said that Columbus continued believing
that he had landed in India, almost until his death.  So latched
onto the need to be right about something, that he was blinded to
real situation.  Almost tragic, actually.

&gt;&gt; which seems to be fairly common these days.

&gt;The problem here as I see it is twofold.

&gt;First, you've set up capitalism in your mind with an expectation of
&gt;perfection. If it doesn't reach that level in actuality, then it gets
&gt;roundly criticized with the implication that other forms of economy
&gt;are therefore better than capitalism. Meanwhile Capitalism is merely
&gt;excellent, not perfect. It's imperfection does NOT make socialism or
&gt;socialized medicine a better solution.

&gt;Btw, if you don't want to pay someone to take care of you when you're
&gt;ill, expect no one to show up on most occasions.

&gt;Second, I cured myself of Stage 4 cancer for about $10 nine years ago.
&gt;The reason this method isn't widely available isn't due to capitalism,
&gt;but due to the over regulation of the practice of medicine.

&gt;Socializing medicine would not improve the situation. Rather it would
&gt;ossify the regulation that's already in place.
">

Issues to think about with health-care (by the way, Capitalism is not
to be confused with free markets):
- Large hospitals will not likely be allowed to go bankrupt, they represent
too much value. If they go bankrupt, the value stored in them is so
great that private management will get away clean if not with a profit
from selling parts. In the end it is usually the tax payer that will pay
the bill of the buy-out. You do not close a major hospital, not unless
you are disintegrating the Nation already.
- Small health care operations can be allowed to go bankrupt. They are
run by people with a strong interest in their continued existence,
they will be hit badly by a bankruptcy. This keeps them going.
- When patients are allowed to pick and choose their hospital, this will
cause good hospitals to get more patients, hence job security there.
Even if the money to pay for services does not come in through the
wallet of the patient, but through the wallet of the Government based
on the number of (cured) patients, it still works as market pressure.
- Larger hospitals are practically never run by the people who set it up.
They are, if in private hands, run by people who just happened to sign
the right documents and flesh out sufficient funds. It is speculative
that this is good choice mechanism for a hospital management. There may
be a far superior method of attracting a capable management to a hospital,
for instance through a form of democracy based on either the general
public, the patients, the employees, or a mix of all three. Democracy
by those having a stake in good health-care in that particular hospital.
- Some patients can't ever pay for the expensive service they receive,
this requires an insurance system.
- But cheap health care services would respond to market pressures better
if patients were to pay.
- However, patients that avoid health-care in the early stages of disease
to save a little money can often end up with a much more serious illness
that is much more costly to repair.
- Health care is a complicated industry. It is constantly on the bleeding
edge (as it were) of modern science and understanding, connects with
everything, and doesn't easily and completely fit in any obvious
industrial category such as `free trade' or `nationalized.' If you take
bakeries, dump them in the markets and you never have to look at them
again from a economic system perspective. If you take water
pipes: you can only have one system therefore no competition, they
shouldn't leak and the water should be potable. Check the bank
statements once a year and you rarely have to look at it.

I think therefore that health-care is unlike any other industry.
Most industry can be privatized fully, with sufficient competition.
Some industry needs to be nationalized fully, such as infrastructure
and business finance. Some industry is simple enough that with a
few ideas it can be somewhere half-way or half in both, I think
education perhaps. Education has aspects that do well under private
control and free markets, and public schools have benefits too. If
you have both, that would again be market-pressures, some fiddling
with financial infrastructure around it, and it would be more or
less obvious how it works and that it works. Education is a rather
simple matter of teachers and pupils, some books, etc.

Nothing about health care seems simple. To think it is simple is
probably to ignore major issues and ending up with a sub-optimal
system like dumping it all in the free markets and let the Poeple and
taxes take the hit if it goes wrong. Putting it all under national
Government is probably the better of the two if it had to be either or,
but small independent free market health-care businesses can do quite
well in principle, so why remove that.  It may be easiest to allow
for a free markets segment and have the big hospital centers be under
a regime that allows patient free choice to go to any hospital while
these hospitals themselves have a management flowing from Government
democracy and reporting to it, or flowing from employee democracy and
reporting and being financed by the democratic Government. That latest
is probably better, because of the democratic prinicple, and because the
complexity requires a more knowledgeable management - unless the
employees are too rude to handle democracy effectively. The financial
structure could then be taxation for everything except &quot;luxury
medicine,&quot; the Government paying the hospitals according to their needs
and market-share. Nationalized health-care insurance is bureaucratically
simpler then all kinds of privatized insurance with their overhead
of marketing and profit, when overseen by Government it would be more
cost effective.

In Holland they seem to get everything wrong lately: put health-care
from nationalized insurance into the private finance sector, which made
it more expensive for everyone. They put the power of patient-choice
in the hand of the insurer and not in the hand of the patient, which
breaks the market pressure connection between to provider and receiver
of the service, and they put the management of hospitals in private
hands (IIRC). They call this `privatization' for the sake of market
pressure. I doubt that it actually will deliver, it already seems that
it doesn't.

I agree totally... just pointing out, I guess, that even the much

&gt; All of 'em. That's the perfect response - a sort of

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; goes bananas and shoots up his or her school which seems to be
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; fairly common these days.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I heard something just last night that gave me a new angle. The
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; concept that anything that evolves (devolves?) into an orthodoxy
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; is ultimately doomed. That applies to every human endeavour.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Religions, political views, science, whatever ... as soon as it
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; decides on a set of &quot;fundamental&quot; rules, it is then locked into
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; them. No room allowed to adapt to changing circumstances. To
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; suggest different would be... well, heretical. Over time problems
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; change and even solutions to problems change and inevitably come
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; into conflict with the rules in place. Any entity that attains a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; strict orthodoxy closes off any dissent, debate, or
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; reinterpretation ceases to progress and ultimately stagnates as
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the world around it changes.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If 1) capitalism depends on economics as its intellectual skeleton
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ( and I don't see how it cannot ) and economics is a science, then
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; capitalism can never be an orthodoxy. Them's big ifs, but if it's
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; not an empirically defensible postion, then that's a Problem.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Political movements that embrace capitalism *can*
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; be orthodoxies, but that's a separate problem.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Any science, even economic science has also been prone to retain
&gt;&gt;&gt; current dogma. Remember, science once said the Earth was flat,
&gt;&gt; No it didnt, that was just the rabble doing that.
&gt;&gt;&gt; that man would never break the sound barrier,
&gt;&gt; No it didnt, that was just a few fools.
&gt;&gt;&gt; travel into space,
&gt;&gt; 'science' never said anything like that.
&gt;&gt;&gt; split the atom,
&gt;&gt; Or that.
&gt;&gt;&gt; etc. For a system to improve, it must it must allow some dissent.
&gt;&gt; Science works by requiring evidence to support particular assertions.
&gt; Science works by building on the best hypothesis until it can be disproved.

Its more complicated than that, particularly with the proposed hypotheses.

Most obviously with infectious diseases and vaccination.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; At one time the best hypothesis was a flat earth.

Nope, that was always just the most superficial hypothesis that always
flew in the face of the basic evidence, like what happens when a boat

&gt;&gt;&gt; ingored convention, and accomplished the &quot;impossible.&quot;

&gt;&gt; Not so much; no. Most truly groundbreaking

&gt; You're arguing fine points and ignoring the message.

&gt;&gt; We're largely, in my opinion, victims of the Einstein/Mozart

&gt;&gt; really people like Darwin who found revolutions - people who
&gt;&gt; spend an inordinate amount of time simply cataloging
&gt;&gt; differences.

&gt; Agreed... but your kinda making my broader point. Darwin's theory was
&gt; not well recieved. Still not considered good science in some circles.

&gt;&gt;&gt; And I think I'm
&gt;&gt;&gt; suggesting that for any system to progress and evolve, it must
&gt;&gt;&gt; question it's own dogma. Science and the scientific method are much
&gt;&gt;&gt; better than most in re-evauting itself while,

&gt;&gt; Mmmm.... I can actually refute that directly.

&gt; What? I thought you were just asserting that before.

&gt;&gt; Here: http://www.anthropic-principle.com/

&gt;&gt; This is emerging, but it's got SCADS of potential to
&gt;&gt; revolutionize things. Anthropocentric and anthropomorphic
&gt;&gt; bias is a huge noise factor in things.

&gt;&gt;  &gt; others, like religions

&gt;&gt;&gt; and political &quot;-isms&quot;, are far less tolerant to change. I'ts amazing
&gt;&gt;&gt; to me how many people derive their personal and moral codes from
&gt;&gt;&gt; 2000+ year old rules.

&gt;&gt; People don't want to do the heavy lifting to *understand* 2000 year

Its a cause, so many prefer to have a simple set of rules to obey, its so

&gt; The problem here as I see it is twofold.

&gt; First, you've set up capitalism in your mind with an expectation of

&gt; roundly criticized with the implication that other forms of economy
&gt; are therefore better than capitalism. Meanwhile Capitalism is merely

I don't think it's that great a leap. But it's never clear
until you can understand the speciation boundaries and that
wasn't understandable ... yet? Aristotle had a &quot;chicken

it was too hard.

My understanding now is that upright bipedal locomotion is
the great leap, anyway. A chicken has *MUCH* more distance from
a protozoan than a human has from a chicken. And chickens
vary significantly based on human meddling, in a very observable
fashion, and did so centuries ago.

No real scramble, there is only one viable explanation, that the atom can be split.

U.S. Health System Receives Low Scores in International
Comparisons

May 15, 2007 - Despite having the most costly health system
in the world, the United States consistently underperforms
on most dimensions of performance. An updated Fund report
finds the U.S. health care system ranks last compared with
five other nations on measures of quality, access,
efficiency, equity, and outcomes
The US ranks last or near the bottom on quality, access,
efficiency, equity and healthy lives, according to a report
in May 2007 from the Commonwealth Fund, which studies
healthcare.

And that particular debate is irrelevant anyway. I am more than willing
to accept that the US Health care system is adequate. That doesn't
justify spending 30-50% more per capita than any other industrialized
nation.

It is up to the US system's supporters to justify its excessive cost, so
far no such justification has been presented. The burden of proof is on
you Rod.

I thought you meant the non US systems in that comment.

These comments are no surprise at all.
