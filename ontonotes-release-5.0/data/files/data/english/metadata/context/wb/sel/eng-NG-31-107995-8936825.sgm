Sorry for the off topic post, but this came in the mail today and I kind
of like it.

Jay Cups

&quot;We the sensible people of the United States, in an
attempt to help everyone get along, restore some semblance of justice,
avoid more riots, keep our nation safe, promote positive behavior, and
secure the blessings of debt-free liberty to ourselves and our
great-great-great-grandchildren, hereby try one more time to ordain
and establish some common sense guidelines for the terminally whiny,
guilt ridden, delusional, and other liberal bed-wetters. We hold these
truths to be self evident: that a whole lot of people are confused by
the Bill of Rights and are so dim they require a Bill of NON-Rights.&quot;

ARTICLE I: You do not have the right to a new car, big
screen TV, or any other form of wealth. More power to you if you can
legally acquire them, but no one is guaranteeing anything.

ARTICLE II: You do not have the right to never be
offended This country is based on freedom, and that means freedom for
everyone -- not just you! You may leave the room, turn the channel,
express a different opinion, etc.; but the world is full of idiots,
and probably always will be.

ARTICLE III: You do not have the right to be free from
harm. If you stick a screwdriver in your eye, learn to be more
careful; do not expect the tool manufacturer to make you and all your
relatives independently wealthy.

ARTICLE IV: You do not have the right to free food and
housing. Americans are the most charitable people to be found, and
will gladly help anyone in need, but we are quickly growing weary of
subsidizing generation after generation of professional couch potatoes
who achieve nothing more than the creation of another generation of
professional couch potatoes. (This one is my pet peeve...get an
education and go to work....don't expect everyone else to take care of
you!)

ARTICLE V: You do not have the right to free health care.
That would be nice, but from the looks of public housing, we're just
not interested in public health care.

ARTICLE VI: You do not have the right to physically harm
other people. If you kidnap, rape, intentionally maim, or kill
someone, don't be surprised if the rest of us want to see you fry in
the electric chair.

ARTICLE VII: You do not have the right to the possessions
of others. If you rob, cheat, or coerce away the goods or services of
other citizens, don't be surprised if the rest of us get together and
lock you away in a place where you still won't have the right to a big
screen color TV or a life of leisure.

ARTICLE VIII: You do not have the right to a job. All of
us sure want you to have a job, and will gladly help you along in hard
times, but we expect you to take advantage of the opportunities of
education and vocational training laid before you to make yourself
useful.

ARTICLE IX: You do not have the right to happiness. Being
an American means that you have the right to PURSUE happiness, which
by the way, is a lot easier if you are unencumbered by an over
abundance of idiotic laws created by those of you who were confused by
the Bill of Rights.

ARTICLE X: This is an English speaking country. We don't
care where you are from, English is our language. Learn it or go back
to wherever you came from! (Lastly....)

ARTICLE XI: You do not have the right to change our
country's history or heritage. This country was founded on the belief
in one true God. And yet, you are given the freedom to believe in any
religion, any faith, or no faith at all; with no fear of persecution.
The phrase IN GOD WE TRUST is part of our heritage and history, and if
you are uncomfortable with it, TOUGH!

If you agree, share this with a friend. No, you don't
have to, and nothing tragic will befall you if you don't. I just think
it's about time common sense is allowed to flourish. Sensible people
of the United States speak out because if you do not, who will?

Interesting, and well-taken, but it misses a very important feature of
the often-ignored (especially that pesky number 10) Bill of Rights: they
limit government.

Yeah, that's no &quot;bill of rights.&quot; It's a manifesto for jingoistic

So in other words... you didn't actually read it.

Perhaps you should, before you criticize it.

Yep, It's a great big, &quot;I've made it so Fuck you!&quot;  And conform to my

The last 2 articles are particularly disgusting.

The part of this country where I grew up was largely settled by the

English ones, but both are and were America.

As far as forcing your religion on me, try it.  My Bill of rights gives

Of course. For example, the dyspeptic idiot who wrote that &quot;bill of rights,&quot;
laying out what he believes should be denied to everyone else.

That one's a loser, Doug. It's not because those aren't expressions of
common annoyances -- most of us feel some of that at different times -- but
because the moron has an upside-down view of what rights are all about. It's
a little Orwellian: love is hate, war is peace, and so on.

No, Ed, the upside-down view of rights is the idea that people *are* entitled

Yeah, I read it. I think the difference is that Stuart and I read what it
actually said.

For example, it says this is a bill of NON-rights, because everyone except
the writer's ilk are too dim to understand. He's smarter than the dim ones,
it appears, so he's out to tell people what they CAN'T demand. For example,
they can't demand that other people stop being offensive. They damned well
can demand that, although they aren't likely to get anywhere with it.

Sure he said they should be denied. He says &quot;you do not have the right...&quot;
He denies them freedom from being offended. We may agree with the basic
idea, but it's none of his God-damned business what people demand.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

What's upside-down is declaring what other people may or may not demand,
expect, etc. There are lots of people who say absolutely you have no right
to own firearms, or to engage in &quot;hate speech,&quot; and so on. Now we have
somebody who says you have no right to a job, or a place to live, or health
care. In other words, if you have a string of bad luck, bub, that's too bad.
You die. Maybe we really wouldn't let you die, but we're within our &quot;rights&quot;
to let you croak. It's a matter of attitude, and underlying that whole list
is something that I see as a bad attitude.

You may object because you think some people are working from the wrong list
of rights. I object because some people think they can tell me what rights I
can demand.

There is no magical or God-given list of &quot;rights.&quot; Rights are what people
decide they are, through the political process. You can argue legitimately
what those rights should be. You cannot argue legitimately that someone
can't demand a right. If they get political agreement about what constitutes
a right (the right for women to vote, for example, or the right to be
treated equally regardless of one's race -- both &quot;rights&quot; that came along
many, many years after the Bill of Rights), then that's the way it goes.

Again, that list strikes a chord with most of us, and, as a social
commentary in the form of a joke (which it appears to be), it's funny and
there's nothing wrong with it. But taking it seriously, or posturing behind
it, requires a certain dystopic attitude and a bit of jingoism. What do you
mean, &quot;this is an English speaking country...learn it or go back where you
came from&quot;? Why? If somebody can hold a job and even thrive without English,
as many thousands of people do in Miami, then what the hell business of
YOURS is it what language they speak?

That's all I have to say about it. I'll laugh along with it, but it's
nothing more than a joke.

&gt;&gt;I started, but it was so full of &quot;thou shalt nots&quot; that it seems exaclty

Ah, I see. I got hung up on the &quot;You do not have the right...&quot;

Well, no human has any &quot;right&quot; to take the fruits of another's labor;
but this is still a constraint on citizens - it's the government that
needs to be constrained. Instead of saying &quot;You do not have the right...&quot;,
what we need to do is stop the socialists from stealing the working
stiff's money to hand it out to others. It's human nature to accept
&quot;free&quot; stuff.

These limits are supposed to already be covered. What we really need to do
is reinstate the Constitution and real Bill of Rights the way the Founding
Fathers wrote it.

In other words, there never should have been a need for such a thing.

What we need to do is stop electing socialists and nazis.

Well, there is, but the real Bill of Rights only delineates a small
subset of them (presumably deemed &quot;most important&quot;), that the
government is expressly forbidden to infringe; the real Bill of Rights
is intended to ensure that people have the ability and means to secure
the rest of their rights to themselves.

I'll let you have the last word on this, Doug, after one last response.

If you read carefully you'll see that the ENTIRE POINT of the piece was not
that there are not God-given rights, but that there are no things to which
one is entitled. I don't know what the author thinks about the source of
rights, God, magic, or otherwise, because he doesn't say, but it doesn't
matter.

Without arguing about what rights are or not (it's a historical question
about where those principles come from, and you won't find the kind of
consistency among the Framers that some people claim), it's fair to say that
the most universal idea of rights today is closer to the UN's Universal
Declaration of Human Rights than it is to the US Bill of Rights. For
example, here's what Ronald Reagan had to say about the UDHR:

&quot;For people of good will around the world, that document is more than just
words: It's a global testament of humanity, a standard by which any humble
person on Earth can stand in judgment of any government on Earth.&quot;

Assuming that Reagan actually read it, you might be surprised to know what
it was that he praised as this standard of judgment for governments: Article
23: Everyone has the right to work, to free choice of employment, to just
and favourable conditions of work and to protection against
unemployment...Everyone who works has the right to just and favourable
remuneration ensuring for himself and his family an existence worthy of
human dignity, and supplemented, if necessary, by other means of social
protection. Article 25: Everyone has the right to a standard of living
adequate for the health and well-being of himself and of his family,
including food, clothing, housing and medical care and necessary social
services, and the right to security in the event of unemployment, sickness,
disability, widowhood, old age or other lack of livelihood in circumstances
beyond his control. Article 26: Everyone has the right to education.
Education shall be free, at least in the elementary and fundamental stages.

That's good ol' conservative Ronnie Reagan's idea of what government is
responsible for. Most people in the world would agree with him. They,
probably including most Americans, woud say that a government that can't be
construed to provide these things isn't worth the powder to blow it to hell.

Obviously, this is not your average libertarian's idea of &quot;rights,&quot; but your
average libertarian would go screaming into the sunset if he actually got
what it is he thinks he wants. He's certainly never experienced it because
we've lived for generations with a much more extensive idea of what it takes
to make a civil society. It's easy to prescribe extreme self-reliance when
you know you have a safety net under you, that you can always go to the
emergency room if things get rough.

And that's the basic problem with the list of &quot;NON rights&quot; that we're
talking about here. His attitude is one of incivility. In other words, he's
a selfish prick who's pumped up with self-righteousness. That wouldn't even
be too bad if he didn't give himself away with the comments about English.
That's a subject you have to think about carefully to avoid being foolish on
one hand or to be a jingoistic xenophobe on the other. He doesn't pass the
test. It's none of his damned business what language someone else speaks.
Switzerland gets along fine with three official and four national languages.
To say you have to speak mine, or get out, regardless of whether you're
self-sufficient and successful (like thousands of people in Miami, to give
just one example) is nothing like a libertarian, or a conservative
principle. It's just mean-spirited self-congratulation and dismissiveness
toward anyone who isn't like you. Which, of course, is what that whole &quot;Bill
on NON-rights&quot; is all about.

I'm done. It's all yours.

Well, the simple way to say it is that too many people talk about
entitlements as if they're &quot;rights.&quot;

But the problem there isn't the people - people will always accept
something for &quot;nothing&quot; - the problem is, and always, has been the
government stealing money from the working stiff, and handing it
out to the poor (democrats) or the rich (republicans).

Where is the absolute definition of a &quot;right,&quot; Rich? It's one thing to say
that people should be responsible to take care of their own health care, for
example. It's another thing to say they have no right to life-saving
emergency care unless they have a way to pay for it.

No it doesn't. The Bill of Rights was a political document written to
satisfy the states with anti-Federalist tendencies that the federal
government would not intrude on the *states'* rights to decide what each
states' people could do. It was a collection of promises that the Federal
government would not intrude beyond the powers granted to it under the
Constitution. Period. End of story. See Barron v. Baltimore, USSC, 1833.

What else ya' got?

Of course the problem *is* the people -- who do you suppose keeps electing

Anyone who says that rights and entitlements are different things, and that

It's a niggardly definition of &quot;rights&quot; with roots in the Enlightenment and
the American idea of limited government, but I don't know of any
Enlightenment thinker who would have bought it. Neither, in all likelihood,
was it universal among our founders.

Are you kidding? Just look at the original list of NON-Rights, Article V:
&quot;You do not have the right to free health care.&quot; An awful lot of people
claim they agree with that list, right? Or non-right?

Does the author qualify that? Do you think that Rich (not to pick on him,
but he's as close to a purebred libertarian as we have right now) believes
people have a right to free health care? Or do you think that he might say,
sure, he'd grant emergency health care to someone out of the goodness of his
heart, but don't tell me it's a right?

So where are the strawmen? It looks like most messages in this thread say
*exactly* what I said about freedoms from, versus entitlements to get, and
that those who feel that way do not believe that people have a right to free
health care even if they need it. Right? Or non-right? d8-)

Hey, Doug, YOU'RE the one who said &quot;He never wrote that he believes that
those things should be *denied* to everyone else -- just that there's no
inherent *right* to have them at someone else's expense.&quot;

Well, getting emergency medical care is getting &quot;health care&quot; at someone
else's expense. Unless you're re-drawing the lines, that distinction,
between rights and entitlements, is exactly what the subject of this thread
was, until we got off track here.

I'm taking you and the purebred libertarians at your word -- that you
believe &quot;there's no inherent *right* to have them (health care, housing,
jobs, and the rest of the original poster's list) at someone else's
expense.&quot;

Are you now saying there IS a right to have some things at someone else's
expense? Like, emergency health care?

Please clarify. I thought we had the distinction nailed down, but now it
looks like the bright line is moving around.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The strawman is your claim that &quot;libertarians and rightwingers&quot; would deny
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; life-saving emergency medical treatment to the indigent, when you are
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; unable to cite _even_one_ instance of anyone actually saying that.

&gt;&gt;&gt;I SAID NO SUCH THING! Once again, you seem to have a reading problem. Take
&gt;&gt;&gt;a look again at what I said. It's right at the top of this post.

&gt;&gt; Yes, you did.

&gt;&gt; In Message-ID: &lt;xEpQi.6132$lE2.2 ... @newssvr22.news.prodigy.net&gt;
&gt;&gt; I asked:

&gt;&gt; Who ever contended that the indigent &quot;have no right to life-saving
&gt;&gt; emergency care&quot;?

&gt;&gt; And in Message-ID: &lt;HWpQi.1567$Yo3. ... @newsfe12.lga&gt;
&gt;&gt; you answered:

&gt;&gt; Anyone who says that rights and entitlements are different things, and
&gt;&gt; that
&gt;&gt; all rights are *freedoms* from some particular thing, never entitlements
&gt;&gt; to
&gt;&gt; *get* something. That is to say, purebred libertarians and most right
&gt;&gt; wingers, plus the occassional crank anarchist.

&gt;Hey, Doug, YOU'RE the one who said &quot;He never wrote that he believes that
&gt;those things should be *denied* to everyone else -- just that there's no
&gt;inherent *right* to have them at someone else's expense.&quot;
">

OK, I get it -- make a false statement, get called on it, change the subject.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Well, getting emergency medical care is getting &quot;health care&quot; at someone
&gt;else's expense. Unless you're re-drawing the lines, that distinction,
&gt;between rights and entitlements, is exactly what the subject of this thread
&gt;was, until we got off track here.

&gt;I'm taking you and the purebred libertarians at your word -- that you
&gt;believe &quot;there's no inherent *right* to have them (health care, housing,
&gt;jobs, and the rest of the original poster's list) at someone else's
&gt;expense.&quot;

&gt;Are you now saying there IS a right to have some things at someone else's
&gt;expense? Like, emergency health care?

&gt;Please clarify. I thought we had the distinction nailed down, but now it
&gt;looks like the bright line is moving around.
">

I'm still waiting for you to produce _even_one_ actual citation of _even_one_
actual libertarian or right-winger saying that the indigent should be denied
life-saving emergency medical treatment -- which is exactly the claim you
made.

This claim is, of course, a cariacature of the libertarian/conservative
position, and a strawman of your making -- but you *did* make the claim.

Substantiate it, or retract it.

Hey Doug, your refusal to read what I actually SAID is just a notch away
from getting me pissed off.

Before we get nasty, let's see if we can get down to the original question:
Do you believe that people have a RIGHT to emergency health care in
life-threatening situations? I'm not asking if you would provide such care,
or if all your buddies would do the same. I'm asking if you think it's a
HUMAN RIGHT.

Please, for comity's sake, just answer yes or no, OK?

&gt; What are you talking about? I read what you said -- even quoted it back to
&gt; you
&gt; after you denied saying it.
">

Yeah, you quoted it back, but you never paid attention to what I SAID.

Here's the quote you're talking about:

&quot;Where is the absolute definition of a &quot;right,&quot; Rich? It's one thing to say
that people should be responsible to take care of their own health care, for
example. It's another thing to say they have no right to life-saving
emergency care unless they have a way to pay for it.&quot;

You went off on that, saying: &quot;Who ever contended that the indigent &quot;have no
right to life-saving emergency care&quot;?

And I replied, anyone who says that entitlements are not &quot;rights.&quot; Like Rich
(sorry, Rich, not picking on you), if he's consistent with his statement,
&quot;Well, the simple way to say it is that too many people talk about
entitlements as if they're &quot;rights.&quot;

So I'm here trying to clear up whether there are any &quot;entitlements&quot; that the
right wing and the libertarians might also consider &quot;rights,&quot; and I give
this example, which clearly is not in the Bill of Rights or any definition
of &quot;rights&quot; that is explained as &quot;freedoms from,&quot; the term we see here from
time to time. And I posed the hypothetical of a &quot;right&quot; to life-saving
emergency care, which clearly is not a freedom from government interference,
but can only be described as an &quot;entitlement.&quot;

Here's another point from you:

&quot;He never wrote that he believes that those things should be *denied* to
everyone else -- just that there's no
inherent *right* to have them at someone else's expense.&quot;

And I never suggested that a right-winger, or a libertarian, or anyone else
would deny emergency health care. You keep saying I did, but then you keep
pasting my quote in which I made clear I was talking about whether they feel
it is a &quot;right,&quot; not how you might behave in a given situation. I even used
the word &quot;right.&quot; I only pointed out that you might not treat it as a
&quot;right,&quot; because this right clearly is had at someone else's expense, and
that's the distinction YOU made yourself. Many others here agree with that
general position, and it's been repeated here many times, over many years.

Now, are there any more &quot;entitlements&quot; that you include in the list of
&quot;human rights,&quot; or does it end here? That's the thing I was curious about
from the beginning, before we got off on this tack.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

OK, I'd be curious how many other self-described conservatives or

If you read my quote, which I pasted above, you'll see clearly that I never
said any such thing. All I did was say they would not consider it a &quot;right,&quot;
as in HUMAN RIGHTS. OK?

I suppose that if you have a RIGHT to emergency health care in
life-threatening situations and you are wandering around in the bush
trying to make friends with a grizzly bear and he bites your arm off
and you bleed to death your relatives can sue because you were
deprived of your rights?

Or if, after having imbibed sufficient Coors to bluster your courage
you pick a fight with a guy that looks like a shaved gorilla and get
hammered into the ground like a tent peg you got a RIGHT for someone
else to come along and run the gorilla off?

&gt;&gt;I dont.

&gt;&gt;Gunner, fanning the flames

&gt;I suppose that if you have a RIGHT to emergency health care in
&gt;life-threatening situations and you are wandering around in the bush
&gt;trying to make friends with a grizzly bear and he bites your arm off
&gt;and you bleed to death your relatives can sue because you were
&gt;deprived of your rights?

&gt;Or if, after having imbibed sufficient Coors to bluster your courage
&gt;you pick a fight with a guy that looks like a shaved gorilla and get
&gt;hammered into the ground like a tent peg you got a RIGHT for someone
&gt;else to come along and run the gorilla off?

&gt;This is another one of these stupid questions like, &quot;when did you stop
&gt;beating your wife?&quot;

I dont see any place in Natural Law, or the Constitution where anyone
has a Right to have someone else take care of them.

Not even in the &quot;promote the general welfare&quot; parts.

Having someone take care of you, is an intitlement.  But hardly a
Right.  You do have the right to camp with bloody pork chops in your
sleeping bag, in griz country....but you dont have the Right to force
someone to either pick up your remains, sort though bear shit for your
car keys, or fix you up if the griz chokes to death on your wallet
before finishing you off.

Our society, and current civiization (for the most part) has made that
an ingrediant of responsiblities to its members....but its hardly a
Right.

Why would anyone think it was a Right?

Sorry Gunner, I should have been a bit more specific in my first
example.

In the U.S. one has RIGHTS - can't get fired because you're too old,
too blind, wrong sex, wrong color, etc. If you do get fired you sue
because you were deprived of your &quot;Rights&quot;.

Now assuming that something gives you the RIGHT to emergency health
care in life-threatening situations and the Grizzly gets you, who do
you sue for being deprived of your rights? The Great Grizzly Nation?
The Forest Service? Gunner Ashe, up there in Bakersfield? The
President? Don't want to have to sue no po' folks!

First we gotta figger out who we're gonna sue then we decide on the
RIGHTS!

Sorta like the Mexicans who sneak across the border. First you get
here and then you rally for your rights as an Illegal Immigrant.
