My wife bought a pair of boots in Priceless Shoes (Metro Centre, Gateshead)
today for £30 and has found that they don't tuck into her jeans like she had
thought (i don't fully understand !), anyway she is not happy. She has also
lost the receipt !. Question is, where does she stand (pardon the pun) ?.
Will she be within her right for a refund / or credit voucher from them ?

Many Thanks
Andrew

"/> Andrew,
You would probably get a better answer calling the store than asking a
bunch of strangers, most of whom are not in GB.

"/> Possibly.

Did she pay with a credit card?

Sometimes stores can swipe the card and find a record of the
transaction in their database. Sometimes they will accept the fact
that their store appears on your monthly credit card statement with an
amount matching the item you purchased as prima facie evidence of your
purchase. Similarly, if she paid by check, a copy of the cancelled
check may suffice.

And some stores will simply take your wife's word for it.

"/> Stores don't have to take back merchandise AT ALL unless it's
defective or in accordance with the advertised refund policy in
effect at the time you bought it. (It doesn't sound like the boots
above were defective. Also, &quot;wrong size&quot; isn't defective unless
it was mismarked as to size.) And they don't have to take back
merchandise unless you can prove you bought it there (so they demand
a receipt).

Actually enforcing these policies may make customers very reluctant
to buy anything, so many stores have much more liberal return
policies (although according to the local news in Texas, some stores
are cracking down on people who return a lot of stuff. I wonder
how some of them get away with this: if the return policy didn't
at the time they sold it say that you could only return three items
in a calendar month and you had to return items within 14 days of
purchase or not at all, I don't see how they can change the rules
now.)
