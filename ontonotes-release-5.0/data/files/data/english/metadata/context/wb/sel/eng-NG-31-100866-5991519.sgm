I'm not a trainer and my experience is limited to my
two dogs, so take it for what it's worth. As someone
who had to deal with a puppy who had his own ideas
about what was and what wasn't "proper behavior", I
was very happy to find The Amazing Puppy Wizard's
dog training method.

It is a method that is gentle to the dog, very easy
to apply and it has been working wonderfully with
both my dogs, giving practically instant results.

It was as if I had been given the "key" to understanding
and controlling my puppy's behavior: suddenly, he was
istening to me, doing what I was asking him to do, instead
of constantly opposing me.

It also worked with some issues my older dog had, too -
her fear of thunder, her barking and her aggression
towards another female dog.

Don't let either the first impression about the "weirdness"
of The Amazing Puppy Wizard, or the regulars' negative
opinion of him (there's a long history behind it) deter you
from at least reading the manual and deciding for yourself
if you want to try it or not.

I wish all the best to you and your dog.

Well, for what it's worth, I am praising without physical
contact and she does seem to listen better than when I
would praise with it.  I agree that it is a distraction.

Anyway, no more aggressive behaviors from her since I
started the Witts End.

Dear Jerry,

It's Kay here. I don't know who these people are that
maligning you and your training manual but tell them
from me that it does work.

Hunter is just doing so well even the people who
advocated putting him down are impressed with him.

I even started using it with the neighbor's dog. I went over
there to help her cut his nails. She started yelling at him
for growling at me. I told her to tell him what a good boy he
is instead. Lo and behold he stopped growling and I could
do his nails. All 4 feet.

My dog Hunter was trained with the old jerk and pull method
and my other dog was trained with treats. Hunter has gotten
his enthusiasm back for his training and I couldn't be more
pleased.

He even tried to kiss a child the other day.

Major break through.

This is the dog that a few months ago tried to eat the kids
through the fence. I can now take him in the car with me
again without him trying to chase cars through the windshield.

So Jerry tell these people that the first rule of dog training
is Do No Harm.

The 2nd rule is whatever works without breaking the first rule.

Aggressive dogs don't need to be put down. Hunter was
diagnosed aggressive and he is going to stay alive and
by my side where he belongs.

Thank you so much.

Hi Jerry,
Just an update to let you know how things are going. Hunter
is doing really great thanks to you and your training manual.

I cancelled the appointment with the new vet to get him re-
evaluated for aggression. all weekend long I had kids run by
the fence to try and make him bark. He didn't! Tonight we
are going to PetsMart to work on his dog aggresion but even
that is going good for him.

I have less and less of a problem with him in my vehicle. He
doesn't try so hard to protect it from the four wheeled monsters
that go by.

I think soon I'll be able to leave his window open when we go
down the road and he won't try to jump out at the cars that go by.

I have shared the manual with several dog owners that I know
and even a group of dog trainers.

Thank you again.
Kay

I have been trying for the last 18 months to help my
dog who became fear aggressive at 18 month of age.
I do not know what started the problem but he came
aggressive first with dogs and then began lunging and
snapping at people. Until this time he loved everyone
and could play with any dog. He was well socialized
ad I took him with me everywhere.

At 13 months he passed the Canine Good Citizens
Test except he could let me leave him. I had used
clicker training to teach him manners and tricks but
it was not working on his aggression problem.

I took him to vets who suggested a low protein diet,
trainers who charged $800 to only make him worse.
They tried to use a prong collar and he froze, urinated
and tried to climb on my head to help him. they then
suggested a shock collar I knew this approach was not
working as he was becoming more aggressive.

I took him to an animal behaviorist with Ph. D. 400 miles
away who told me to "KEEP HIM SAFE" and read a book
on the fearful canine. I tried another trainer who tried to
use a nylon chock collar but it only made him worse.

I read hundreds of books,"CULTURE CLASH", "DOG
ARE FROM NEPTUNE", "THE OTHER END OF THE
LEASH", ETC looking for help. We finally went to Purdue
University Small Animal Behavior Clinic and they said he
had fear aggression, punishment would not work, use the
gentle leader and when out walking and he got stressed
have the people stop until he could get in control using
treats, and work on clicker training.

At that point I knew more about clicker training and using
the gentle leader than they did! Nothing was working--he
would not come when I called him and would run away when
I tried to catch him. I was afraid to walk him even in the
neighborhood as we had become that "mean dog and women who
hasn't trained her dog"

I went to four trainers in both Michigan and Florida who
were trainer/specialists in aggression and the last two
were so afraid of him they could not approach him. No one
said I should give up on him and kill him but they would
say "You have to realize he is dangerous and you are
responsible for him."

*(You got LUCKY, Linda... They coulda got Sunshine
DEAD on us. Damned near did... too.)

As last resort I tried the internet again--I had had on
going discussions with trainers from Triple Crown and Dr
Meister with out any help-and I found the ad to Doggy Do
Right and messaged Jerry to ask if this might help my dog.
He said solving the aggression problem was EZ but I could
not believe him even when I downloaded the manual.

The name of the method was right I was at my Wits End.
I had been working for 18 months!

Using the can sound three time he came, and still comes
from anywhere with the command-"comegoodboy" Next
I tried the can when walking him--when he saw a dog three
blocks away he went off-lunging and snapping-I used the
can sound and he looked at me like uhn?

I used it three more times and we got to the other dog-
-the looked at me wagging his tail--the other person
looked at me like why are shaking that can but just walked
on by.

When ever I try to explain about the sound people look at
me like "you must be out of your mind"

The results can make a believer!!!

Three weeks since beginning the Wits End Training
Manual program I walked him without the gentle leader
in a busy shopping area with many dogs.

He just seemed to not notice any one.

When people talked to him or ask his name he would
look at then and wag his tail and let then pet him.

I still can not believe the change in him--we can now
enjoy life out in public.

If I had not found the Wits End method I know there
was no hope for him and he would have hurt someone
Through all this he never growled at me, guarded his
toys or food or showed any sign of aggression with me.

My goal is to get the message out to

&gt; Hi. Can anyone help?

&gt; Then he started:

&gt; Getting aggressive with dogs on leads - he'd go up with tail wagging,

&gt; Then getting aggressive if HE was on a lead and another dog came up to
&gt; him.

&gt; Then getting aggressive with dogs he met around the place we walk most
&gt; regularly, around our horses' stables. For a while it was fine, he'd go
&gt; up, they'd sniff and then play. Then he'd suddenly turn aggressive and
&gt; once bit one badly. Now if I let him off the lead (which I can't if
&gt; there's any chance there'll be another dog around) he will rush
&gt; straight up barking to see them off.

&gt; For a while despite this he was fine if he was on unknown territory but
&gt; now he is doing the same behaviour elsewhere as well. I have to keep

&gt; collie has to get off the lead and run. If the JR gets in a scrap, the
&gt; collie would join in to stick up for him, then all hell breaks loose
&gt; (the collie is fine otherwise).

&gt; In the house he seems a sweet, cuddly, soppy dog; and his basic

I had a dog that was fear aggressive to everyone--males, females and
people.  I now know that I taught him to be fearful and aggressive.

When someone would approach I pulled him back so he would not
jump on them--he thought I was afraid of the person or dog so he
became fearful and aggressive to keep them away.

I truly believe all aggression is caused by improper handling.
Violence
produces violent aggressive behavior but just my pulling on his leash
made him fearful of strange people and dogs so he became aggressive
to protect us both--then I pulled on his leash more to correct him so
he
got moreaggressive since he thought we were in real "danger".

Jerry's Wit End Training avoids violence and gives you a way to
correct the dog without physical control which only increases stress
in the dog--ie more aggression.

RTFM is age-old computer lingo.... It stands for "Read The
F***ing Manual" ;-) I used the manual and it works very good!

But it is a long text to read (76 pages printed on A4-size
paper) My lab is 1year old now, and teaching him something
new takes about 30minutes  (depending on what to teach
offcourse)

My other dog (a 7year old staffordshire terrier-mix) is a bit
slower in learning, but he is used to me calling him a "bad
dog"whenever he did something i didn't want him to do, or
it might be the age.

Sometimes it looks like Sam (the lab) WANTS to learn
something new: he wants me to bring along the can
filled with washers whenever we go for a walk. It is a
very "humane" way of teaching: the dog is allways a
"good dog", and never a "bad dog"

There is nu punishment or prong-collars involved.

For a fact i tought him to heel in 15min's without
beeing on a leach at-all !!! When he spotted a dog,
he used to run towards it, but now i tought him to "ask
permission" first, and to my surprise it worked!

My dogs never went to puppy-training (lucky for them),
maybe this helped too.

Thanks for your analysis of my dogs fear aggression.  I wonder why you
question my comments on visiting behaviorists for help with my dog's
aggression.  Yes, aggression has many forms and many activities can
contribute to aggression.

In my case it was started by the mishandling of the leash and since
I did not know what to do at the time I made the problem worse as
aggression become a habit or way of reacting.

Aggression is very frightening and many people give up on the dog
since they are told aggression can not be cured only controlled.

The reason for my post was to share my experience and hopefully
prevent the original posters dog going from over excitment to
aggression.

No one ever thinks they would have an aggressive dog--Ihave had dogs
all my life and this is the first one that has had an aggression
problem,
and if I can help anyone prevent the development of aggression I will
try.

The Sincerely Incredibly Freakin Insanely Simply Amazing

frail old coward who doesn't even like the idea of HURTIN
and INTIMIDATIN dogs and PRETENDING THAT'S
NORMAL, to PROVE HE'S a real man.

LIKE THIS:

"I have heard advice stating that you should pre-load
your dog for Bitter Apple for it to work as efficiently
as possible. What  does this mean?

When you bring home the Bitter Apple for the first time,
spray one squirt directly into the dog's mouth and walk
away. The dog won't be too thrilled with this but just
ignore him and continue your normal behavior."

Dear Jerry,

It's Kay here. I don't know who these people are that
maligning you and your training manual but tell them
from me that it does work.

Hunter is just doing so well even the people who advocated
putting him down are impressed with him.

I even started using it with the neighbor's dog. I went over
there to help her cut his nails. She started yelling at him
for growling at me. I told her to tell him what a good boy he
is instead. Lo and behold he stopped growling and I could
do his nails. All 4 feet.

My dog Hunter was trained with the old jerk and pull method
and my other dog was trained with treats. Hunter has gotten
his enthusiasm back for his training and I couldn't be more
pleased.

He even tried to kiss a child the other day.

Major break through.

This is the dog that a few months ago tried to eat the kids
through the fence. I can now take him in the car with me
again without him trying to chase cars through the windshield.

So Jerry tell these people that the first rule of dog training is
Do No Harm.

The 2nd rule is whatever works without breaking the first rule.

Aggressive dogs don't need to be put down. Hunter was
diagnosed aggressive and he is going to stay alive and
by my side where he belongs.

Thank you so much.

Kay

Hi Valerie,

It's  kind of you to adopt an unwanted dog. I hope it works out .

This is not something you can tackle alone. This dog has issues. It
must
be completely over whelming for a dog to be in a kennels for two years
and
then suddenly have to live in a society where she has forgotten the
rules.

She needs re-hab like prisoners do.

Go back to the shelter and ask for help and advice.

Find out why the dog was there in the first place.

Ask your vet to give the dog a health check in case the dog is in pain
.

Some illnesses or the thyroid can cause aggression.

Call in a behaviourist and ask him or her to come to the house.

Until you get professional help back off from the dog and don't put
her
in stressful situationa and don' t let children and strangers near her.

Don't force issues or confrontation. The best thing to do for now is
to
withdraw  from her . She will feel more comfortable if you don' t make
to much of a fuss.

Don't look or stare at her. Tell your family to ignore her.

This sounds like you are snubbing her and it's hard to do but it's a
natural
action in the dog world. It helps her relax and relieves pressure

Do a search on the web about dog behaviour or get some books from the
library.

http://www.canismajor.com/dog/aggres1.html
http://www.infopet.co.uk/ .

I've added this link about thyroid  incase other people are intersted
in
reading it

Subject:    one Cat's aggression/fear-solved

Date:  Mon, Jul 10 2006 8:55 pm
Email:   "starrk ... @aol.com" &lt;starrk ... @aol.com&gt;

Hi everyone,

I'd like to tell you all of an encouraging experience I had with a
wheelchair bound lady and her "aggressive" cat.

The lovely kitty is generally high strung, very protective of the lady
and fearful of unknown people and noises. And after biting and
scratching people who worked helping her, the owner was convinced she
would not be able to keep the cat, as much as that upset her.

I heard of the kitty and contacted the shelter for the owner to see if
they would take her and they couldn't say yes no knowing why the cat
had bites. If aggression was a personality trait for the cat they might

not be able to take her.

I spoke to the lady about trying to change the behavior before she
makes a choice on giving up the cat. She was all for it. So I took my
Doggy Do Right box over there and set it up for her. The owner kept it
on the second setting for a few days then switched to the third setting

for the next week or so.

When I called to check on them the owner said, "ya know, that thing
really works!"

Her cat is now allowing strangers in the apartment without threatening
them, or batting them with her paw. She said kitty calmly checks out
the new people and then goes to lay down the floor. She is so happy:-)
now she wants her own DDR.

This is a kitty a lot of different people were telling the owner was
too much for her to deal with. She's only had the machine for about 3
weeks and the kitty is doing great:-)

I'm so happy this worked out and had to let you all know again what a
great tool the DDR is.

The machine could help many more animals become "adoptable" or be able
to remain in their homes. Everyone in animal care should give it an
honest try.

Crystal
