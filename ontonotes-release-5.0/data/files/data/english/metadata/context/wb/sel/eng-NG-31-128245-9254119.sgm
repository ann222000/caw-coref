STARTING POINT

Yehuda's Attitude towards Eir and Onan - by Rabbi Amnon Bazak, Yeshivat Har
Etzion

The affair of Yehuda and Tamar begins with his meeting her, after he had first
neglected her and hinted that she was responsible for the deaths of his sons,
and ends with Yehuda's repentance for his acts (&quot;She is right, I am responsible&quot;
[Bereishit 38:26]). However, in the beginning of the passage there is another
issue that should also be studied.

After Eir, Yehuda's firstborn, dies without having any children, his brother
Onan does not want to have children in his brother's name, thus refusing to
observe the custom of &quot;yibbum,&quot; which already existed at the time (see Ramban).
Why did Onan refuse to fulfill his obligation? This can evidently be seen in the
verses which precede the account of his refusal. In the description of the
births of Yehuda's children, it is written that after Yehuda married the
daughter of Shua, &quot;She became pregnant and gave birth to a son, and he called
him Eir. And she became pregnant again and gave birth to a son, and she called
him Onan. And she once more became pregnant and gave birth to a son, and she
called him Shaila.&quot; [38:3-5]. Why did Yehuda give a name to his son Eir, while
his wife named his two other sons? Ramban noted this distinction, but he writes,
&quot;the Torah does not tell us why.&quot; Perhaps it implies that Yehuda had a special
relationship with his firstborn and that he therefore showed a strong interest
in him and gave him a name. His close feeling towards his firstborn is notable
in comparison with his attitude towards the other two sons.

The same phenomenon then continues as the children grow. &quot;Yehuda took a wife for
his firstborn son Eir, and her name was Tamar&quot; [38:6]. Yehuda shows that he
cares about his son's marriage and even finds him his bride. But the Torah tells
us that in spite of - or perhaps because of - this preferred attitude that
Yehuda gave his son, &quot;Eir, Yehuda's firstborn, was evil in the eyes of G-d, and
He put him to death&quot; [38:7]. And after Eir dies Yehuda continues to be involved
with his son's memory, and he turns to his younger brother. &quot;So Yehuda said to
Onan, go to your brother's wife and take her for a wife in his place, in order
to continue your brother's seed&quot; [38:8]. The repeated reference that Onan must
do something for his brother is a direct continuation of Yehuda's special
relationship with his firstborn son.

However, Onan refuses to cooperate and makes sure &quot;not to provide seed for his
brother&quot; [38:9]. He is not described as his brother was, &quot;bad in G-d's eyes,&quot;
but rather more specifically - &quot;And what he had done was bad in G-d's eyes&quot;
[38:10]. It is not unreasonable to suppose that Yehuda's attitude is what led to
Onan's behavior. In general, he might have been a better person than Eir, but
his feeling of being deprived led to the sin for which he lost his life.

It is most ironic that this affair is described in close proximity to the story
of Yosef. Those events also took place at least partially because of the
preference that Yaacov showed for Yosef, as is written by the sages: &quot;A man
should never give one son preference over his other sons. For a double weight of
wool that Yaacov gave to Yosef... one event followed another and our forefathers
were forced to descend to Egypt &quot; [Shabbat 10b]. If our approach is right,
Yehuda, who was a central figure in the controversy between the brothers that
was caused by preferential treatment, did not learn the lesson from his own
experience - and he then paid the price for his own similar mistake.

POINT OF VIEW

The Right Belongs to the Youth - by Rabbi Yisrael Rozen, Dean of Zomet Institute

Meeting of the Weak with the Weaker Still

At first I considered writing an article this week speculating what results
there might be from the &quot;Annapolis Conference&quot; that is taking place this week.
At the time that I am writing this article, the events of the conference and its
results can only be guessed. For you, by the time you read it, the meeting is
history. But I have decided not to get involved in speculation, idle prophecy,
or my own longing. Rather, I will take a general look at the &quot;process&quot; and at
our role in the international &quot;game&quot; that is being forced on us.

The media and the analysts - left, right, or from the center - all define this
as a meeting between two &quot;weak leaders,&quot; one from Jerusalem and the other from
Ramallah. Some see the producer of this event from Washington as another &quot;weak&quot;
leader, since his time is almost up, and he is about to start his last year in
office.

Looking out from my position next to the furnace in our &quot;shteibel&quot; - the
provincial synagogue where we live - I will take the opportunity to give advice
to the leaders of the world. I cry out: This is wrong! There is no symmetry
here! The weakness of one is very different from the weakness of the other. One
is so weak that he cannot give up a single dot over any of the &quot;i's&quot; in his
demands, while the other is so weak that he strives to give up as much as
possible, hoping that this will strengthen him! As far as our &quot;weak man&quot; is
concerned, the way to gain popularity in the polls is to increase the amount of
surrender, &quot;good will&quot; gestures, and declarations, all adding up to one giveaway
after another.

There is also another conspicuous asymmetry that is even more important: On our
side, unrestricted surrender to our enemy, one gesture on the heels of another,
&quot;disengagements,&quot; retreats, and expulsions - all of these are a tried and true
recipe for escaping the wheels of justice, fleeing from the fear of being put on
trial. Just the opposite is true of the other side: surrender to the &quot;Zionist
enemy,&quot; appeasement, and an agreement to accept less than their full demands are
liable to bring the leader to a prison or even a firing squad!

Another point about the asymmetry is also very much to our detriment. In our
enemy's lair, there are fanatic fundamentalist movements which &quot;must be
considered&quot; in any process. If the Palestinians will agree to give up on their
demands for &quot;the right of return&quot; or for every inch of the areas before 1967,
these elements will riot! But on our side, the political right can be expected
to accept any decision with the equanimity of a Hindu monk.

Rightist Compulsion

It is quite possible that the State of Israel would not have come into being if
not for the organizations of the Etzel and the Lechi, which &quot;rioted&quot; and &quot;acted
badly,&quot; in a threatening way, not always following the strict letter of the law.
None of the settlements in Yesha would have come about if not for an avant-garde
and as it were &quot;misbehaving&quot; group - Gush Emunim - that skirted the limits of
public law and order, thereby forcing the others to take this group into
account.

Since the days of the expulsion in Gush Katif, the right has become more sober
about its expectations and there is also a phenomenon of a deep coma., On the
other side of the political spectrum, other beliefs are also no longer as
prevalent as before. People are more sober about the messianic faith that our
enemies will bow down in acceptance in return for our gesture of expulsion and
invite us to join a grandiose new peace. People are more sober about blind trust
in the false declaration that the expulsion would improve our security. People
are more sober about the defeatist belief that the decisions at the time of the
expulsion were carried out in a democratic fashion, perhaps on the borderline
but at least democratic in nature. As far as I can tell, nobody really believes
in these &quot;truths&quot; anymore. Will they return in full force at Annapolis ?

On the other hand, and this is one of my main points in this article, the
political right has fallen into a deep coma. The satanic action succeeded, and
the uprooting of the area of Azza was able to uproot much of the motivation and
the energies of the rightist side of the political realm. Many reasons can be
suggested for this, but they do not change the result: there is total asymmetry
in current events!

Here is what is needed, as far as I can see: It is time for a &quot;new right&quot; to
arise, in the aftermath of the expulsion from Katif, with a different pattern of
thought. How can this be done? The answer is that the right must belong to the
youth!

Should Fanaticism Be Spurned or Desired?

Was the fanaticism shown by Shimon and Levi in Shechem, which we read about last
week, a worthy act? Yaacov did not like it, at least within the framework of
international reactions. &quot;You have made me look ugly among the inhabitants of
the land... but I am few in number&quot; [Bereishit 34:30]. They continued their
fanaticism in advising to throw Yosef into the pit (Shimon and Levi are brothers
- agreeing on the matters of Shechem and about Yosef&quot; [Rashi, 49:5, in the Torah
portion of Vayechi]. Yaacov scolded them with a curse before he died (see
Yayechi for details). Is there any benefit to be obtained from fanaticism? Can
any good be expected from it? In a remarkable Midrash, the sages give us an
analysis of fanaticism, differentiating between the consistency of Levi and the
poor performance of Shimon.

&quot;'Shimon and Levi are brothers, their possessions are corrupt tools' [49:5].
This can be compared to two people who took a loan from a king. One of them paid
his debt and even gave the king a loan. The other not only didn't repay his
debt, he even took out another loan. The same is true of Shimon and Levi. They
both took out a loan in the events of Shechem. Levi paid his debt, as is
written, &quot;And Moshe stood in the gate of the camp and said, 'Let those who are
for G-d come to me! And all of the children of Levi gathered around him.'
[Shemot 32:26]. And Levi even made another loan to G-d, as is written, 'Pinchas
Ben Elazar, son of Aharon the Priest eased my anger by appeasing my jealousy'
[Bamidbar 25:11]. Shimon not only did not repay the loan, he borrowed more, as
is written, 'And the name of the man of Yisrael who was struck was Zimri Ben
Sallu, the head of a family in the tribe of Shimon&quot; [25:14].&quot; [Sifri, Beracha
33:8].

There are fanatics whose anger flares up for a short time and then subsides, and
their fanaticism is false and improper. There are other fanatics whose actions
remain consistent and can lead to peace (Pinchas was given &quot;a covenant of peace&quot;
[Bamidbar 25:12], see also Yehosua 22:30-33, where Pinchas helped bring peace
among the tribes). The fanatics of the House of the Chashmona'im were fashioned
from the same priestly mold.

TO SEE G-D'S GOODNESS

Biological Asymmetry - by Rabbi Yehoshua Shapira, Rosh Yeshivat Ramat Gan

Question: Are men and women intrinsically different or not?

Answer: Every person's face has not only many elements of symmetry but also
significant asymmetry. This phenomenon was once demonstrated with a picture of
President Kennedy, who was considered a very handsome man. Three versions of his
picture were printed alongside each other. People who looked at the pictures
were able to identify Kennedy immediately, but they felt some discomfort which
they could not pin down. The middle picture was normal. The two other pictures,
one on each side, were very similar to Kennedy but had a &quot;Mongolian&quot; appearance.

The middle picture was indeed an untouched image. In the other two pictures,
alongside, only half the face was reproduced in correct proportions. The other
half of the picture was either wider or narrower than the original. Thus,
neither of the pictures on the side had the same appearance as the original or
in fact looked like a normal person.

The same is true about material reality. It is not a mathematical concept but
rather a biological one. Mathematically speaking, the distance between &quot;one&quot; and
&quot;two&quot; is the same as the distance between &quot;two&quot; and &quot;three.&quot; In life, on the
other hand, when an amoeba divides into two there is always some difference, no
matter how slight. Two amoebas are created that are not exactly the same, and
neither one is exactly half of the original. In real life no two objects are
exactly the same, everything has one-time meaning, everything is unique. Divine
wisdom is expressed in the details of all the creatures and this gives every
single individual an absolute and eternal importance.

The same is also true about man and woman. The two parts of the human home are
indeed symmetric, and the two sexes therefore have equality. Under certain
circumstances, our sages tell us that &quot;the Torah equates men and women,&quot; in line
with the words of the Torah with respect to the creation of man: &quot;And He called
them 'man' on the day that He created them&quot; [Bereishit 5:2]. The creation of man
is based as much on the female as on the male, and neither sex has an innate
advantage over the other one. But it is wrong to ignore what preceded this verse
about the differences between the two creatures. Woman was created in a way that
is very different from how Adam was created - he was created completely alone,
while she was fashioned from part of his body.

Placing too much emphasis on the differences between man and woman does not
leave room for harmony and a proper mutual relationship between them. But the
immature attempt to give equality of the sexes supreme importance leads to a
superficial view which sees the world in two-dimensional images, with no
suspense or creativity. When everything is forced into exactly the same mold the
unique value of every individual is lost, along with the many different shades
of character. A mature point of view is one that can enjoy the harmony and the
inner relationship between creatures who are similar but not identical.

Modern feminism has passed beyond the stage of a strict demand for absolute
equality. In the past, this was expressed in various ways, such as in the army,
insisting that women must be given combat roles which had been considered as
strictly suitable for men. More recently, this movement has begun to demand the
exact opposite, centering the attention on the image of a female as she is,
without any contact with male roots. This has led to recent objections to
various scientific axioms by claiming that they were developed by men and are
based on male concepts and a male outlook.

It should be clear that neither of the above approaches corresponds to the
teachings of the Torah or to the reality of nature. Both absolute equality and
total conflict, when taken by themselves, lead to a built-in distortion of the
image of the world. The simple harmony that should be present in a home is built
up from a framework of giving equal respect and importance to the personality of
each side and to his or her contribution - based on unique skills and ability -
to the joint enterprise. Each one must realize that he or she represents only
one side of the complete home and needs the other side for its contribution.

A LESSON FOR THE CHILDREN

Who Won the Debate? - by Rabbi Yikhat Rozen, Merkaz Neria, Kiryat Malachi

(In memory of Rabbi Neria, on the twelfth anniversary of his death.)

We were in the eleventh grade, students at Yeshivat Kefar Haroeh, headed by
Rabbi Moshe Tzvi Neria. During the years when we were together, we learned a lot
about Torah and the fear of heaven, and also about such subjects as Torah and
labor, Torah and Zionism, and Torah and Eretz Yisrael. We also learned a lot
from our teacher about listening to those who were different from us and
learning even from people whose opinions were very far from our own.

One day one of the students suggested that we organize a symposium, a public
debate. The rest of us accepted the idea enthusiastically and began to plan the
event. We wanted to have a meeting in front of all the students between Rabbi
Neria and a &quot;thinking person&quot; from the political left. The idea was to invite a
man who would present nonreligious and secular ideas on important subjects
related to current events. Rabbi Neria would reply to all of the claims and
explain the position of the Torah.

It did not take long to find a suitable speaker, named Abba Kovner. He was a
very famous man who lived on a kibbutz near the yeshiva, and he had fought
together with the partisans in Europe. He had the reputation of being a good
speaker who could explain his opinions very clearly. We all gathered in the
dining room, quite excited. We sat, eager for Rabbi Neria to &quot;win&quot; the debate.
And then the symposium began. Abba Kovner was excellent. He spoke clearly and
enthusiastically, presenting good reasons for his opinions. Anybody who would
have left the room at that point might well have been convinced by the secular
arguments of Abba Kovner. We all waited to hear how Rabbi Neria would respond in
language that was as strong as that of his opponent. But to our shock and
consternation, Rabbi Neria was &quot;weak.&quot; He smiled, he spoke quietly and in a mild
tone. He spoke about the subjects that had been brought up but only in a general
way, in principle, without any of the fighting spirit we all wanted to hear.

We returned to class deeply disappointed. We had been eager to win, and we felt
defeat instead. Soon afterward, we were told to gather together to meet Rabbi
Neria. We all came, without knowing why he wanted to see us. The rabbi came to
the point immediately: &quot;I have been told that some of the students are
disappointed, that they wanted to see a victory.&quot; And then he added a sentence
that I was only able to understand years later: &quot;But he was our guest, and it is
necessary to be nice to a guest!&quot; At first I could not believe what I had heard.
What did this have to do with anything? As a guest, give him a glass of tea, but
win the argument anyway! And then Rabbi Neria continued, &quot;After all, here is
what we could have told him...&quot; And to my amazement the rabbi repeated from
memory all of the claims made by Abba Kovner against the Torah and against our
approach to Judiasm, and showed how to demolish each and every one of them. We
were all glued to our seats, drinking in every word of his. We were left with
our mouths wide open, and we saw how all of Kovner's arguments were meaningless
as compared to the eternal truth that the rabbi showed us. But now I was
thoroughly confused. Rabbi Neria had such good replies, why didn't he say them
in the debate? Just because Abba Kovner was our guest?

It was only years later that I understood the words of Rabbi Neria. One should
not meet another Jew only in order to have a conquest. No good can come from
such an approach, and it will certainly not convince anybody or bring him closer
to our beliefs. We are not ashamed of our way, but we want to meet other people
and hear their outlook, not only to hear loud applause for what we say in reply.
Victory is not measured by success in a debate but rather at a level of
eternity. We must ask: In what I did, have I helped the nation of Yisrael to get
closer to our final destiny? And as far as this was concerned, I understood that
Rabbi Neria and his approach had scored a great victory indeed.

LAND OF MY BIRTH

The First Accident in the Little Town of Tel Aviv - by Zev Wallack

The &quot;first Hebrew city,&quot; established in 1909 as a neighborhood named &quot;Achuzat
Bayit,&quot; was planned from the very beginning as a modern city. The streets were
wide and properly laid out according to the standards of the times, and all the
streets had sidewalks. Yosef Eliyahu Shalush was the contractor who paved the
streets and set the pavement on the sidewalks.

The most impressive route could be seen on Rothschild Avenue , which had four
lanes, separated by rows of trees. At first it was called the &quot;Boulevard,&quot; using
the French word for a row of trees. The original intention was not to build such
a wide road, but before the construction was started a deep wadi divided the new
neighborhood into two parts. In order to transform the entire area into a single
flat surface a huge amount of sand was brought to fill the wadi. But it was soon
discovered that no houses could be built on such a crumbly base, so it was
decided to plant trees instead. Black and white pictures from that time show
that Herzl Street was also quite broad. In the picture, the Herzliya Gymnasium
(today the site of Migdal Shalom) can be seen at one end of the street, and a
peaceful camel rests in the middle.

But this peace and quiet did not last for long. The volume of traffic in the
burgeoning city grew, such that in the beginning of 5682 (1921) the local
government published an &quot;important announcement&quot; as follows:

&quot;In line with the declaration by the (British) government, we hereby serve
notice to all the owners of carriages, automobiles, bicycles, wagons, etc, that
they must be provided with brakes, so that all the vehicles can stop whenever
necessary, in order to avoid accidents caused by excessive speed. This decree
must be fulfilled within seven days of this proclamation, and those who violate
it will be punished as severely as the law permits.&quot;

The efforts of the municipal government and the drivers prevented any lethal
accidents for the first three years, but to everybody's dismay the first serious
accident took place in 5685 (1925). A young pedestrian was killed because of
reckless driving at too high a speed. The inhabitants were in great shock, and
the local authorities published an &quot;announcement and a warning&quot; as follows:

&quot;The traffic in the main streets has grown so much recently, in terms of cars,
wagons, carriages, and camels, that there is a constant danger for all
pedestrians, because of the great speed of the cars. The result was the terrible
tragedy that occurred to the child Devorah Bat Shmuel Gross, whom we mourn
deeply, and we want to console her parents. In order to prevent similar cases in
the future, the local authorities have decided as follows:

&quot;(1) All pedestrian traffic on the sidewalks or in the streets must be only on
the right side. (2) All movement of cars, carriages, wagons, camels, donkeys,
and horses must also be only on the right of the road. (3) Cars may not be
driven within the boundaries of Tel Aviv at a speed greater than ten kilometers
per hour (the speed limit was emphasized in bold print in the original
announcement). (4) It is forbidden to move camels or donkeys in the streets
unless they are tied to each other. Not more than four camels or five donkeys
may be tied together. (5) Drivers of cars and carriages and bicycle riders must
blow their horns in order to warn the passersby at the corners of the streets
and whenever they are about to turn.&quot;

Since that time, the Yarkon River has witnessed much activity, and the young
city has become a metropolis. The narrow streets have been replaced by busy
intersections through which tens of thousands of modern vehicles pass every day.
However, traffic accidents have not stopped, they are on the increase. Our only
wish for Tel Aviv as it approaches its hundredth year is that it will continue
to progress in the realm of road safety, in order to decrease the number of
unnecessary traffic victims.

MEN OF YISRAEL

&quot;He Sent Him from the Chevron Valley &quot; - by Rabbi Uri Dasberg, Machon Zomet

This week's subject wrote a full eighteen-volume encyclopedia on his own,
covering the entire range of halacha. The Shavei Chevron yeshiva which occupies
Beit Romano in Chevron was not the first yeshiva to be situated in this
building. It was preceded by the yeshiva that was established by this week's
subject, and it was there that he finished writing his Talmudic encyclopedia.
The name of the yeshiva was the same as his book. There were people who objected
to the book's name because they felt that it included a form of G-d's name. They
therefore printed the cover with vowels, to ensure that the name would be
pronounced correctly.

The encyclopedia has several sections: (1) The general principles of the Talmud
and the rules for halachic decisions, organized alphabetically. (2) &quot;Collected
laws,&quot; also in alphabetical sequence. Another volume was added, &quot;Michtav
L'Chizkiyahu,&quot; in the sequence that appears in the Talmud, and in addition
responsa, named &quot;Or Li.&quot; Other matters were also discussed, such as the name of
the encyclopedia.

Wherever our subject served as a rabbi, including the community in the Karim
peninsula in Russia , he was also admired by the local Gentiles. In Chevron, the
Arabs wanted to move his body from the Jewish cemetery to the local mosque, and
the Jewish community was forced to appoint guards to watch the grave.

The Chabad Chassidic dynasty admired the &quot;Chacham&quot; very much (that is not a
Hebrew word but rather an abbreviation - see below), and they printed his
encyclopedia with a detailed index which makes it very easy to find specific
subjects. The Jewish community consisted of both Sephardim and Ashkenazim, and
the latter included the community of Chabad. The Sephardi community decided to
establish a library - &quot;a collection which will satisfy all the needs for
literature, newspapers, and books on the history of Yisrael.&quot; After some
hesitation, the &quot;Chacham&quot; joined Chabad in violently opposing this library. This
is similar to what happened with the idea of establishing an Alliance school in
Chevron. After agreeing to the proposal, our subject opposed the idea, following
the lead of the rabbis of Jerusalem.

Who is Our Subject?

This week's subject is Rabbi Chaim Chizkiya Medini (&quot;Chacham&quot;), the author of
the &quot;Sdei Chemed.&quot; He passed away the day before Chanukah, 24 Kislev 5665
(1904). He was the rabbi of the city Karaso on the Karim peninsula and served as
rabbi of Chevron for the last four years of his life. We wrote about the
controversy surrounding the name of his book in this bulletin exactly one year
ago, bulletin number 1148.

Words of Torah by our Subject:

Can oil which is not kosher be used on Chanukah (for example, if it is made from
pig fat)? There is a general rule that only material that can be put into our
mouths can be used in the service of G-d, which would imply that oil made from a
nonkosher animal cannot be used. However, it is written in the Talmud that oil
which cannot be used on Shabbat, including &quot;Kik&quot; oil, can be used for Chanukah
(Shabbat 21a). But the Talmud explains that this oil is made from a bird which
is listed in Chulin 63a as not being kosher.

Much has been written about this subject. See what is brought in Sdei Chemed
(Collection of Laws, Chanukah, 14 - which takes up about thirty columns in the
book). He writes with respect to the question of &quot;Kik&quot; oil that the prohibition
against using nonkosher material applies only when the mitzva requires using a
substance made from an animal. However, a Chanukah candle can be made from an
inanimate material, such as wax, and the restriction therefore does not apply.
He used the same principle to explain other issues, such as the use of an
elephant for the wall of a Succah and a talit made of silk (a product made from
a worm).

THE WOMAN IN THE TENT

Without a Father - by Mrs. Rivka Shimon, Pisgat Zeev

The poet Rachel sang, &quot;If only I had a son, a little boy,&quot; thus expressing the
urge of a woman to have children. Women are intimately linked to the Divine will
of continuing the natural growth of humanity in G-d's world. And that is the
reason that a woman is not obligated by the commandment to have children, women
do not need a formal command.

Recently, the question of an unmarried woman conceiving using donated sperm has
again arisen. In the end, this was halachically prohibited. In this article we
will try to understand why this is so.

The main point is that a child born from donated sperm is a child who lacks the
identity of a father. An orphan or a child whose parents are divorced knows who
his father is. He or she knows his family details. There will be pictures, there
are relatives, there are stories about the family. No matter how tragic the
death of a parent or a divorce is, a father figure exists with whom it is
possible to hold a conversation, at least in the privacy of one's own soul.

A person will typically travel to the ends of the earth in order to find a clue
to his father's identity. In 1995 Julie Shels directed a documentary movie named
&quot;Baba-Luba,&quot; where she followed the journey of the singer Danny Bassan in his
search for his roots, traveling to his homeland, Brazil , in order to find his
biological father. It was a very touching film.

Everybody is aware that when his father and mother were linked together, at the
very moment that he or she was created, there was a moment of desire, love, or
at least fondness - a natural human bond between a man and a woman. The soul of
the child developing in the womb was able to sense the intimate emotions between
mother and father during pregnancy. This is not true when an unmarried woman is
impregnated without any contact with a man. When a child reaches maturity, he or
she up will understand the difference.

Rabbi Yuval Sharlo recently described the many problems of young couples who
consult him. He said that in our generation there are cases of coupling without
sexuality, parenthood without sex, and more. The case of Yehuda and Tamar in
this week's Torah portion is not a permitted option, even though the sages had
praise for Tamar: &quot;'And she sat at Petach Einayim' [Bereishit 38:14] - Rabbi Ami
said, we searched the entire Tanach and we could not find a place named Petach
Einayim. What does it mean? It teaches us that she set her eyes on the opening
that all the eyes depend on, and she prayed, to G-d that she would not leave her
house empty.&quot; [Bereishit Rabba 85]. This event did not include marriage, and in
her strong desire to have a child from the tribe of Yehuda, Tamar did not think
about herself at all. She was willing to put her life and her honor in danger.
The Almighty pressed the &quot;angel in charge of lust&quot; into service, caused the
widower Yehuda to stray from the proper path, heard her prayer, and gave her
royal and messianic offspring.

This entire story is not one to be emulated, and it does not imply that it is
legitimate to have a child outside of a marriage. No rabbi within the Jewish
consensus will ever recommend to a single girl to act as Tamar did, engaging in
elicit sex. I might add that men these days tend not to take responsibility for
their actions, which might be one of the reasons that they are not in a hurry to
get married. Who knows if they would ever have the courage to admit to being a
father to such a child, as Yehuda did?

What should a woman do if she wants a child? There is always the option of
marrying, even if the man is not perfect. After all, the woman is not really
perfect either. So there will not be a love story as in the movies. Even in the
affair of Tamar and Yehuda there was no love, enchanted bonding, or intimate
link. Judaism is not Catholicism, and there is always a possibility of a divorce
after some children are born and the option of marriage has been tried.

As a society in a welfare state, we have social and economic responsibility for
every woman who is an unmarried single parent. It would have been much better if
we had invested the same economic resources in teaching about proper family life
between a man and a woman. Let us invest our money and our efforts in convincing
people to marry, to invest in the institution of marriage. In this way, they
will make sure that the children of the next generation will be whole in their
souls.

A CHASSIDIC THREAD

Life as in a Movie, from the Sidelines - by Rabbi Shlomo Shok, teacher in
Yeshivat Siach and Nokdim Prep-school

Even though this week's Torah portion is called &quot;Vayeishev,&quot; meaning to be
settled, it is difficult to accept it in a calm atmosphere, considering all the
exciting events that occur in it. The portion describes complex affairs of the
type in which the evil inclination attempts - and often succeeds - to play a
major role. We are sometimes required to meet the challenge of very similar
stories in our own lives, and the Torah presents them to us so that we will
study them and learn the appropriate lessons.

Yosef is called &quot;a righteous man who is at the foundation of the world&quot; [Mishlei
10:25]. He receives this illustrious title because of his ability to overcome
the challenges which surround him, especially the test with Potiphar's wife,
which could have destroyed his personality. It is possible that Yosef's eventual
success became possible as a result of his long forced stay in a dark pit and in
prison.

After the fact, it is clear that Yosef's stay in prison gave him an opportunity
to see life while looking in from the outside. The forlorn and limited state in
which a prisoner finds himself lets him look at life in an unusual way, not from
the normal and familiar point of view. In effect, he looks at life from the
sidelines. He is not a full participant in the events taking place beyond the
walls of his confinement, and he can look at life as if he were watching a
movie.

Based on his experience as a prisoner, Yosef first learns himself and then
teaches us how to keep our distance. From the external viewpoint he lives as an
Egyptian, but internally he remains a Hebrew. He overcomes difficult challenges
because he can look at life from afar without getting directly involved.

It is not necessary to be in jail in order to look at the complexities of life
from an external point of view. When we find that we are swayed by a whirlwind
of emotions and feelings, we must begin to look at ourselves from the outside.
We must free ourselves from ourselves, dismantling the general cluster of
lustful events within us, and try to disengage and restrain whatever threatens
to throw us into a maelstrom of inclinations and desires.

For example: When we feel anger, we must take a step back and try to look at the
events which surround us from the outside. Perhaps we will not be able to curb
our anger immediately, but we should at least be able to stop identifying with
it. At this stage, we might well appear in our own eyes to be laughable.

Our inclinations and desires can put us into prison or a deep pit. But because
of our lack of attachment and the distance, this is just the place from which we
can look at ourselves from far away and emerge from our troubles in an honorable
way.

HALACHA FROM THE SOURCE

The Essence of the Prohibition of &quot;Borair&quot; - by Rabbi Yosef Tzvi Rimon, Rabbi of
Southern Alon Shevut and a teacher in Yeshivat Har Etzion

The prohibition of &quot;borair&quot; - selection - does not appear to follow the general
pattern of the thirty-nine categories of labor prohibited on Shabbat. In
general, any labor whose product is not needed by the person is permitted. But
borair does not seem to fit this definition, since the whole point of the work
is that we don't want to keep the waste material that we remove from the food.

According to the Baal Hamoaor (Shabbat 106a), this is indeed a labor whose
product is not needed, but the Torah specifically prohibits it anyway. &quot;With
respect to all thirty-nine categories of labor that existed in the building of
the Tabernacle, the products of them all were needed, except for 'zoreh' -
winnowing - and 'borair'.&quot;

The Ramban, on the other hand, seems to feel that this is considered labor whose
product is needed, because its main purpose is to prepare the food which remains
behind (Yeshuat Yaacov, quoted in Biur Halacha 319:3). Is there any practical
difference between these two definitions (removing waste or preparing the food
for use)?

According to the Talmud Yerushalmi, it is possible for a person to make
selections during the entire day of Shabbat and not violate the prohibition of
borair, while there are other times when one violates the command after a very
short time (Shabbat 7:2). How is this possible? A person who begins to select
from a large pile but does not reach the end of the pile is exempt from any
punishment. On the other hand, one who finishes the selection, even though only
a small amount of food was initially present, has desecrated the Shabbat. This
implies that the reason for the prohibition of borair is to avoid preparing the
food for eating. Thus, if the preparation of all the food is not complete
because there is still waste mixed in with at least some of it the Shabbat has
not been desecrated.

Rabbi Akiva Eiger writes in his Responsa (20) that the Babylonian Talmud
disagrees with this reasoning and considers the violation to have taken place
even if not all the food has been treated. Perhaps the Babylonian Talmud feels
that the basis for the prohibition is waste removal.

There may be other practical differences between the two approaches. The TAZ
writes that if a fly falls into a drink it may be removed with a small amount of
liquid (319:13). The Mishna Berura accepts this ruling of the TAZ (61), and
expands it. He writes that it is always permitted to remove waste if there is a
small amount of food together with it. The Chazon Ish strongly disagrees with
this reasoning (53; 54:4). He insists that one who removes a bone with a small
amount of meat on it has violated the prohibition of borair, since &quot;he is not
interested in the meat but in cleaning out his plate.&quot;

It seems that the basis of the argument between the Mishna Berura and the Chazon
Ish is the above question of the reason for the prohibition of borair. If what
is prohibited is removing the waste, then if a bit of food is included with the
waste we are not removing it only, and the action is not one of separating the
waste from the food. However, if the basis for the prohibition is the act of
preparing the food for use, then taking a small amount of food together with the
waste does not help, since we would still be preparing the remaining food for
use.

In summary: We have seen that there are two ways to understand the main
prohibition of borair: (1) Removal of the waste; (2) Preparing the food for
eating. There are many practical differences between the two approaches, and we
will continue this discussion in further articles.
