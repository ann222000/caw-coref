Quite easily.  The difficult part was obtaining the pictures.

Why not? What "confusion and theories" are you referring to? No theory
(no credible one, anyway) denies that atoms are physical things, with
physical properties that can be measured. An atomic force microscope is
a device that measures some of these properties, and does so on a
mechanical scale small enough to resolve individual atoms.

OK, OK, but /what/ am I /looking/ /at/ in the referenced photograph?

AFAIK none of the theories says that an atom resembles a cotton ball.
My simple understanding is of a compact nucleus with a quite high
probability that electrons exist at various energy levels -- orbitals
-- surrounding the nucleus in a sphere, and a much smaller, but
non-zero, probability of finding those electron on the other side of
the universe; the electrons are a mathematical abstraction, or so I'm
told -- until we look at them. When we examine the atom (with an
atomic-force microscope, e.g.) the probably smeared-out electrons take
definite positions for the instant of observation and are real, not
just abstractions. Look away, and they become a probability again, no?
I'm asking you, not trying to tell you...

So what is the microscope "seeing?" Physical bumps (atoms) in the
surface of the material being probed? Tiny forces, the topology of
which is defined by the limit of the outermost orbital? Cotton balls?

It is reacting to the average electromagnetic forces of the atoms. As the
article says they can now distinguish atoms of different types, which
didn't used to be the case. It doesn't have sufficent time resolution by a
long way to notice the electrons as individual particles. (If it did it
would of course interfere considerably with the energy of the system).
Variations of these instruments can also move individual atoms around. I
recall a few years ago that an IBM lab carried out a stunt writing the
initials IBM with individual atoms this way.

At a low level, what the microscope is "seeing" is a force between its
sensor tip and the underlying atoms, most likely caused by the Casimir
effect or the van der Waals force. These mechanically deflect the tip
(or attempt to do so, against a feedback force) in a measurable way. To
a microscope like this, atoms essentially look spherical- presumably
because a time-averaged atom is isotropic in terms of how it interacts
with other matter. In structures like this, interatomic distances are
huge compared to nucleus dimensions, so I assume you are correct that we
are basically seeing the electron orbitals.

What's new about this microscope (as compared to other AFMs that have
been around for 20 years) is the ability to determine the type of atom
under the probe.

At a high level, what we're seeing is obviously a computer synthesized
image. What's not clear is how "raw" this image is with respect to the
stylus signal. Obviously, the color is added; I don't know how much
other stuff is synthesized as well. You can see what appears to be the
physical scan pattern, and it seems like fairly low resolution compared
to the detail in the atom images.

What you are saying it seems to me is a convoluted response or agreement
that in fact there
is very little information as to what is really there.  Maybe this, maybe
that.  It is funny that
the picture conforms to our standard model of atoms. Irrespective that they
can be wave like or
particle like.  But one thing is certain, atoms are distinct entities of
sumpin. Sumpin that is neither solid
nor pure energy.

All important entities in Nature wear makeup to cover their true Natures. Women for one. You are seeing
an image of the interaction between the atomic forces and the micropscope.
That interactional image changes as the atomic forces change

I'm guessing you're referring to the fuzzy nature of the various disks.
Quantum Mechanics clearly states that the electron clouds surrounding
the nucleus of any atom is going to be "fuzzy" because you can't pin
down the location of the electron.  So the best you can determine is a
plot of its probably location, which will wind up looking like a fuzzy
cloud around the atom.

Even the fact that the various disks aren't symmetrical is predicted by
the theory.

So what you're looking at, if you want the short answer, the the fuzzy
electron clouds surrounding each atom.

Yes it is obvious, Mick.  I have been extremely active in this group for
YEARS. . .with more than 2000 posts and responses.  I have also been
published in Rod Mollises publication and have had some of my "Top 5 Signs"
posts from way back "borrowed" and published on other websites.  I started
out as "Starstuffed" and changed years ago when I decided it may appear
that I was trying to disguise my identity as you do continually, MICK.

As for the professional help, did you ever seek it for your viscous attacks
on Kathy years ago?  (surely you remember. . .John Steinberg finally shut
you down there by threatening to find you).  How about for your posts in
that other forum where you stated that you were looking for a big woman to
dominate you? (it didn't take much tracing to find a little posting history
on you in all the WRONG places).

Just a hint, Micko.  You apparently haven't figured out that information in
your header gives your true identity away, everytime.  Do you have the
brains to spot the relevant info?

How is Medicine Hat this time of year?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; With all the confusion and theories about what atoms are or aren't,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; how
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; can
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; pictures like this be taken and be referred to as actual atoms?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; My goodness, Mick!  It looks like this troll really is catching the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; fish.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You are counting the responses, aren't you?  Do you have a little
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; notepad
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in which you keep a record how many bites you got with the bait you
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; used?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The OP is anything but a troll question. Who let you out of the house?

&gt;&gt;&gt; It is OT.  It is from Mick.  It is a troll.  You should lurk longer before
&gt;&gt;&gt; you shoot your mouth off.

&gt;&gt; It's obvious who the lurker is here MR Howell.  You should seek professional
&gt;&gt; help.

&gt; Yes it is obvious, Mick.  I have been extremely active in this group for
&gt; YEARS. . .with more than 2000 posts and responses.  I have also been
&gt; published in Rod Mollises publication and have had some of my &quot;Top 5 Signs&quot;
&gt; posts from way back &quot;borrowed&quot; and published on other websites.  I started
&gt; out as &quot;Starstuffed&quot; and changed years ago when I decided it may appear
&gt; that I was trying to disguise my identity as you do continually, MICK.

&gt; As for the professional help, did you ever seek it for your viscous attacks
&gt; on Kathy years ago?  (surely you remember. . .John Steinberg finally shut
&gt; you down there by threatening to find you).  How about for your posts in
&gt; that other forum where you stated that you were looking for a big woman to
&gt; dominate you? (it didn't take much tracing to find a little posting history
&gt; on you in all the WRONG places).

&gt; Just a hint, Micko.  You apparently haven't figured out that information in
&gt; your header gives your true identity away, everytime.  Do you have the
&gt; brains to spot the relevant info?

&gt; How is Medicine Hat this time of year?

Oops, silly me!  I forgot to mention that I also was responsible for the
SAA Mugshot page (when Gareth Slee let it go) complete with audio clip
capability.  I am thinking about putting that site back up. . .my expense,
of course -- not yours or anybody elses.  You are clearly outnumberd in
every department, Mr. Mick.  Go away.

In my best valley girl imitation (which is not very good, actually):

"Uh... ye-ah-uh"

Sorry Martin but I think you will have to consider yourself trolled.
And that goes for the lot of you.

Too bad real people never ask interesting questions here.  But then, why
on earth would they?

That's the best you could come up with Mick?  I'm dyin' laughing here!

Has it ever occurred to you that your behavior on this newsgroup isn't
normal?  I mean, normal people would just find a book or ask a serious
question on a serious forum... but you have this bizarre need to try to
fool everyone and be a dick.  Fascinating behavior, really.

You forgot the "purge" part binge-purge studying.  I had my last
orgasmic chemistry class in '87 and have been blissfully ignorant of the
subject since a day or so after my last final.  :-)
All you need to remember for organic in H=1, O=2, N=3, and C=4
Biochem's a different story.  Had to know that for work.

That is not a picture of individual atoms.  It is an out-of-focus close-
up of a LiteBrite(TM).
