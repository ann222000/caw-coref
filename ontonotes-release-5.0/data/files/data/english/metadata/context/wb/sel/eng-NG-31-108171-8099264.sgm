No mention of networking functions, but at least it shows the platform isn't
dead.

Interestingly enough though, the TiVo press release refers to the 2nd
generation units as Series2 for the first time that I can recall.  Most of
us refer to them that way anyhow, but now TiVo acknowledges them as such.
Wonder when DirecTV will also refer to them by their &quot;common&quot; name too.

My HR10-250 has had &quot;Platform: Series2&quot; in the System Information screen

Would someome please explain what this press release means?  Which
upgrades are they referring and which DVR(s) do these upgrades apply?

And at the end of the day, will DirecTV still not have an decent HD DVR
option?

Did you read the press release?  It spelled out exactly which upgrades
they are referering to.  And they are referring to the DirecTiVo boxes
which have USB ports.

Depends.  They have the HR10-250 which many people think kicks ass.  And
assuming this box qualifies for the new software, will only get better.

This press release does not impact their home-grown HD DVR.

I'm confused - I had always assumed that the arrival of junk like the R15
and slightly-less-crappy HR20, was because Directv had decided to cut Tivo
out of the loop, and make all its own DVRs.  Moreover, I've not seen any
Directv Tivo product on sale recently.  So does the reference to 2010 just
mean Tivo will support the already-installed Directv Tivo boxes until then,
but won't make any more?  If so, I wonder why they are bothering with
updates.

I don't know how much cheaper it is to develop in-house compared to paying a
license fee to Tivo, but it certainly can't be helping customer loyalty.
Maybe we'll just have to wait until Directv comes to the conclusion that it
should concentrate on its core competencies and scraps its in-house program.

The former is just what it sounds like - a folder of recently deleted
shows.

Overlap protection allows you to record two shows that overlap up to 5
minutes - the lower priority show gets truncated.

When the 622 first came out, there were reliability issues.  These
issues have been resolved for quite some time now.  The CNET review
discusses these issues in depth.

You pay a $50 activation fee.  If you accept an 18-month commitment,
they rebate you the $50 on your monthly bill.  If you go month-to-month,
there's no rebate.  So ,essentially you pay $50 to avoid the commitment.

Also, there's no upfront fee for the 622 and they give you $20 off your
bill for 10 months (=$200) just for signing up.

Well, here's my dilemma.  My wife and I have been talking about buying
a widescreen HD set, a big one, by the end of the year.  I can wait
past that for DTV to supply the extra HD channels it's been talking
about, but the absence of an appropriate TiVo to record HD from the
satellite is another matter entirely.  This lack is a problem for me.
If Dish is offering something more suited to my needs, it would be

True,

In particular, I disliked the need to press the GUIDE button twice to
actually get the guide to show up. Apparently one of those upgrades
&quot;fixed&quot; that as there is now an option, and once set, I go directly to
the guide with one click.
Many of the other little glitches that I used to see are also now
gone. The interface is still not as nice as that on my HR10, but it's
a perfectly usable DVR.

Hi Dr P

Well where do I start? I bought a rear projection HD 1080 and am happy
as heck.  The pictures are so much clearer, even those not HD and I
have the HR 20-700, I think that is correct as I just got it a couple
of months ago! The quality in the playbacks are just great.  While I
do agree there is not a lot of channels for the fee I still get enough
to almost justify the 9.99 expenditure even though I would like more
at the same cost.  Lucky for us we have several of our local stations
now broadcasting in HD or at least I think it is HD and we just love
it.  I have a JVC 56&quot; and the picture quality is great and I assume
that it is not only the set but the quality of the signal being sent.

Thanks, Lee.  I'm grateful you shared your opinion, especially as I'm
sorta wandering around in the dark on this.

I took a look at reviews of the HR20 a little earlier today.  CNET, for
example, seems to like it better than its readers do, although some of
what the thumbs-downers talking about (premature cutoff of recordings)
seems to have been corrected, according to Bob Nielsen.  I could live
with a non-TiVo DVR if it performed -- well, maybe not perfectly, but
better than adequately.

Thanks again.

I have the HR20-700 plugged into a 50&quot; plasma, and to be quite frank it is
amazing when on an HD channel, either &quot;live&quot; or a recording.

As to the recorder I am very happy with it the only thing I would add would be
the ability to go to an exact part of a recording, this can only be done by
fast forwarding through. A similar box I had in the UK you could pick a time
for example x number of minutes from the start and I've missed this a few
times, but it isn't a big problem.

Hi again.  Well I went to the store and compared TV's and the picture
versus each that they had on the floor.  Then I looked at my wallet
and then made the decision that &quot;to me&quot; there was not all that much
difference (old eyes) so that is why I bought the rear projection TV.
So far I have had no problems and it is over a year and the insurance
I bought on it was only $69 for 3 years which you can't beat.  So I
have 4 years of insurance.  The projection lamp runs about $200 to
$400 per the sales person.  As far as DTV goes I have had zero
problems.  They deliver what they say.  I just dropped HBO as all the
programs I liked died out, Sopranos, Rome and Deadwood.  But I still
get around 10 channels of HD and the rest make my old 19&quot; RCA look
like a Flint Stone I am almost ready to get another TV like maybe LCD
that is at the low end to replace it.  BTW if you have the old sets
the transmissions don't improve the signal but with a HD set they are
absolutely the best.  They have a nature program on something like
Sunrise or something similar that would take y our breath away if you
are a nature buff.

Oh well, best of luck in your choices whatever they are.  BTW the wife
prior to &quot;my&quot; purchase of the TV did not think it worthwhile as far
as the cost but I notice she does not try to use the old set which is
in my computer room (grin)  So I assume she likes it also!

I can't speak to the HR20 but I can tell you that the software updates have
not corrected the premature cutoff of recordings on the R15!  If they've
really fixed the HR20 I wish that they'd get off their duffs and fix the
R15, too!

Occasionally, I think my two DirecTV SD DVR units aren't that bad.  Then

The DirecTV DVRs are unstable, inflexible, and annoying as all get out.  To

I've been using the DirecTV DVR now for two weeks. I've been a TiVo user for
many years, within a year of when they first came out.

While I don't like the interface of the DVR as much as TiVo's, I've not had
any problems with it shorting shows, missing recordings and the like. The
only problem was more of a weather related on with some high winds, rain and
lightning. Other than that, the unit performs well.

I've gradually getting used to it. I've been able to program my Harmony 880
remote for what I need with it quite well.

Right now the DVR is &quot;different&quot; than TiVo, not &quot;substantially worse.&quot; Don't
get me wrong, I preferred TiVo but this is doable and it works as I need it.

Well I've used a non TiVo DVR since the beginning, I went with Replay
TV, then with the Dish 625 which was an excelent machine and I wish I
could get one like it for Direc.. Had other issues with Dish though.

Now I have an  R15....  I also have a vacuum cleaner.  Both suck,
However with the Vacuum it's supposed to.

Things I do not like about the R-15
Missed recordings
Truncated recording and truncated playback
Only one output.  Why give it two inputs if you only have one output
(yes, I know there are multiple output jacks but they are ALL THE SAME)
No ability to watch program save by that single output channel.
99 item limit on the &quot;To Do&quot; list, if you use what I call &quot;Themed&quot;
recordings (Season Pass since they are a sports oriented outfit) You
fill that up right quick so you can't program in movies and the like.

Things I do like: Single satellite source means less expensive external
hardware on the RV, and the advertised price is much closer to the
delivered price (not as many excuses to tack on an additional five bucks
here and there like Dish does)

Direc tells me that once I'm back to a spot with a view of the sky they
can upgrade my software (I had the latest a short time ago) and
re-format the drive and that will fix many of the problems.....

I suspect... It won't.  The box has far too many &quot;Known issues&quot; I did
not sign up to be a beta tester and I'm not sure it's ready for Beta yet.

Just wait.  The most basic functions are okay, but the DirecTV DVR is truly
abysmal at anything that you haven't already used.

How do you switch tuners?  LiveTV on the DTivo, or info and a down arrow.
You can do a dance of discovery on the DirecTV DVR, but it involves
recording shows that you don't want to keep, just so you can manipulate the
tuners.

What happens when there is a conflict coming up on the next hour and you
are watching live TV?  It's difficult to figure out what it wants to do, and
I sometimes find that it is recording the same show on two different
channels.  I &quot;stop&quot; one of them, and lose both.  If I'm not actually live,
but back somewhere in the buffer, I am going to lose that, unless I record.

Where is a wishlist?  If I wanted to record some baseball games, I might be
able to enter an auto-record for &quot;giants at&quot; which shows up in the listing
as &quot;Giants @&quot; and catches only the away games, but &quot;at giants&quot; doesn't find
the home games.  The Tivo will catch both with an &quot;at giants&quot; wishlist.

The first few days with a DirecTV DVR are hard to get used to.
You know the Tivo interface, and the DirecTV DVR has a difficult interface
to grasp, even from no previous mindset.  Then you get used to it.
Later, you will get frustrated when the things that don't happen every day
come into play.  The DirecTV DVR was developed with no experience, very
little common sense, and hasn't been updated.

I am a hard core TIVO fan so in moving to DISH with the 622 I was a bit
apprehensive, But so far the box is a decent piece of equipment. I do miss
the &quot;wish list&quot; of Tivo, and I find the UI of the 622 a bit less intuitive,
but the biggest issue I have is if I am sitting watching TV1 I MUST watch
what tuner one is doing, If I wish to watch another channel I must go to TV
2.

Regarding the on demand feature. Where does it store the movies, On the HD

&gt; &gt; It would semm to me that if you are watching TV1 that means you are

&gt; My direct Tivo R10 allowed me to switch to the other tuner at any time. If

&gt; &gt;&gt; I've been using the DirecTV DVR now for two weeks. I've been a TiVo user

&gt; &gt; Just wait.  The most basic functions are okay, but the DirecTV DVR is truly
&gt; &gt; abysmal at anything that you haven't already used.

&gt; &gt; How do you switch tuners?  LiveTV on the DTivo, or info and a down arrow.
&gt; &gt; You can do a dance of discovery on the DirecTV DVR, but it involves
&gt; &gt; recording shows that you don't want to keep, just so you can manipulate the
&gt; &gt; tuners.

&gt; &gt; What happens when there is a conflict coming up on the next hour and you
&gt; &gt; are watching live TV?  It's difficult to figure out what it wants to do, and
&gt; &gt; I sometimes find that it is recording the same show on two different
&gt; &gt; channels.  I &quot;stop&quot; one of them, and lose both.  If I'm not actually live,
&gt; &gt; but back somewhere in the buffer, I am going to lose that, unless I record.

&gt; &gt; Where is a wishlist?  If I wanted to record some baseball games, I might be
&gt; &gt; able to enter an auto-record for &quot;giants at&quot; which shows up in the listing
&gt; &gt; as &quot;Giants @&quot; and catches only the away games, but &quot;at giants&quot; doesn't find
&gt; &gt; the home games.  The Tivo will catch both with an &quot;at giants&quot; wishlist.

&gt; &gt; The first few days with a DirecTV DVR are hard to get used to.
&gt; &gt; You know the Tivo interface, and the DirecTV DVR has a difficult interface
&gt; &gt; to grasp, even from no previous mindset.  Then you get used to it.
&gt; &gt; Later, you will get frustrated when the things that don't happen every day
&gt; &gt; come into play.  The DirecTV DVR was developed with no experience, very
&gt; &gt; little common sense, and hasn't been updated.

&gt; I don't think I'll ever get used to the limits like the lack of a wish
&gt; list (Replay had it, Dish had it, I'm sure TiVo has it) or the 99 item
&gt; lmit in the &quot;To Do&quot; list.   I'm tracking a couple of R-10's though
">

Thanks you all for your opinions, and for relating your experiences
with these various machines.  It's been very helpful to me, and I
appreciate it.

&gt;&gt; &gt;What are &quot;Recently Deleted Folder&quot; and &quot;Overlap Protection(TM)?&quot;

&gt;&gt; The former is just what it sounds like - a folder of recently deleted

&gt;&gt; Overlap protection allows you to record two shows that overlap up to 5
&gt;&gt; minutes - the lower priority show gets truncated.

&gt;OK, thanks for the info.

&gt;&gt; &gt;Which they no longer offer to new customers or HD upgraders.

&gt;&gt; You can still buy one from a 3rd party and activate it.

&gt;Why would I pay $200 to $250 or whatever for an obsolete box (no MPEG4,
&gt;right?) when I can sign up for Dish TV and get the top-rated ViP622,
&gt;more HD channels, better picture quality, no upfront fee and no
&gt;commitment?

The Dish box has it's own problems. HDMI inputs are one, so if that's

That problem was solved long ago.

The fact is that both DISH and DirecTV have had some problems with
receivers.

Read the newsgroups dealing with both satellite providers and you'll
discover that they both have their critics.

Dish receiver is a non-starter for me because it only has one ATSC
tuner. Directv receiver has two, so I can record 2 HD programs at the
same time.

Obviously you are not very familiar with DISH receivers.

Some DISH receivers do have only one tuner--as is the case with some DirecTV
receivers.

But others--like my VIP 622--have two.

Little,

He was talking about ATSC (for OTA digital stations) tuners and he is
correct.  NONE of the DISH receivers have more than one.  Some of the
DirecTV HD receivers have two (and two satellite tuners).

For me, it is a non-issue with my ViP622 since I watch very little
network TV.  I can't ever remember wanting to record two OTA HD programs
at the same time.

Yep, the HR10-250 can record FOUR things at once, two from OTA ATSC and two
more from DirecTV SD satellite.

About the only things we record OTA are off PBS and Lost off ABC.

Since when?  While I don't use the OTA functionailty, all the docs I have
read state you can only record 2 things at once, regardless of how many
tuners you currently have functional.

No, it cannot.  The HR10-250 has two logical tuners (aka &quot;tuner chains&quot;).
Each logical tuner can do either OTA ATSC or DirecTV SD+HD satellite;
one or the other but not both.

I do agree: With Dish, they nickel and dime you (Add five dollars a
month for this, and for that and for other things) Direc is more honest
in their pricing.  With Dish I also need to point to two birds to get
all my programming (This is indeed a problem) with Direc only one
(Standard TV in both cases)  However with Dish, up to the end, I never
had a hardware problem.  With Direc...  Well, as I have said, I don't
think the R-15 is ready for beta testing yet, it's still  &quot;Alpha&quot; level
in my book.   Of course Direc says &quot;Those are known issues you cite and
we can fix it&quot; (SURE they can)

I have a bid in on a pair of R-10s

What's more is that while the Direc boxes have a single set of outputs
(Many outputs, all tied together though so you can only watch shows one
at a time) DISH has dual outputs (ONE HD one Standard on the HD units)
so you and your significant other can each watch the shows of your
choice on different sets at the same time.

To me that is a big difference... If I'd known before I cancelled Dish I
might have toughed it out with them.

Uh, no it can't, it can record two things at once by selecting from any
of the four possible inputs. So you can...

Record 2 OTA simultaneously
Record 1 Sat and 1 OTA simultaneously
Record 2 SAT simultaneously

If you don't beleive, try scheduling three recordings at the same time.
