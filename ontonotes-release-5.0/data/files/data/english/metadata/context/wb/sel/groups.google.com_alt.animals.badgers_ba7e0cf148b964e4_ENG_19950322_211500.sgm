&gt; Please take it from me it will be very hard to find.

Hey, how about BRONZED badgers? Surely someone's taken that up as a
sport, right? Do you mean cotton/polyester stuffing or local taxidermy
specialties?
Just wondering.

My Mum had a stuffed badger ontop of the TV. She found a dead one by the
road, took it to a taxidermist, and then plopped it on the TV.

Trouble was, she sold it before I got to see it, but I think if I was
going to get one stuffed if I found a dead one, I would have it in a
position where it was holding a tin of beer and growling.

That'd be cool.
