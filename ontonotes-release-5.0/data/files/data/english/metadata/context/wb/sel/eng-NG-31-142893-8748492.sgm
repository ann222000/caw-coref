<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; You are lying as usual.  I did not twist words.  I quoted what Carl
&gt; said and showed what the quote that Carl used said.
">

Please note &quot;Bible Bob&quot; only gave a partial quote and took it out of
context. This has been documented. Typical &quot;Bible Bob&quot; dishonesty (TM). Now
&quot;Bible Bob&quot; denies it even though his attempt at deception is duly
documented. Typical &quot;Bible Bob&quot; dishonesty (TM).

&quot;Here is what Carl wrote:

I and other Christians have rejected Glenn's heresies and even though he has
been corrected by many Christians he still refuses to correct his errors
which leads we Christians to have nothing further to do with him (Romans
16:17; 1 Cor. 5:4-13;...&quot; [Please note &quot;Bible Bob&quot; neglected to present my
COMPLETE quote. Again please refer to the entry entitled &quot;A series showing
intentional and admitted deception by &quot;Bible Bob&quot;&quot; and note that he leaves
off several passages I cite, the common theme being instructions to
Christians to have nothing to do with heretics and their heresies. &quot;Bible
Bob&quot; is resorting to misquoting and taking the partial quote out of context
to try to slander me.]

A series showing intentional and admitted deception by &quot;Bible Bob&quot;

1) On July 27th, a Usenet poster using the nick ®andy posted an entry in
which he entitled &quot;There is no Biblical fellowship with someone who worships
a different God&quot;

2) On August 3, 2007 @ 12:13pm I responded to ®andy's post. In it I cited
seven passages from the Bible that have the common theme teaching that
Christians are to stay away from heretics and their heresies (Romans 16:17;
1 Cor. 5:4-13; 2 Thess 3:6, 14; 2 Tim. 3:5; Titus 3:10,11; 2 John 10).

3) At 9:40pm of August 3, 2007 &quot;Bible Bob&quot; responded but rather than address
all seven passages, he prooftexts 1 Cor. 5:4-13 to try to support his
attempted slander in a thread he began also at 9:40pm which he entitled
&quot;Carl McCaskey Accuses Glenn of Having Sex With His Own Mother&quot; which in of
itself is a false accusation on &quot;Bible Bob&quot;'s part. So &quot;Bible Bob&quot;
intentionally left off the context. A clear dishonest tactic. Also at the
very beginning of this thread, &quot;Bible Bob&quot; intentionally misrepresents again
when he wrote, &quot;But this time in his attempt to deceive readers in his post
titled &quot;There is no Biblical fellowship with someone who worships a
different God&quot;, Carl went way to far.&quot; As documented, the thread entitled
&quot;There is no Biblical fellowship with someone who worships a different God&quot;
was begun by ®andy, not myself. This is clear yet &quot;Bible Bob&quot; attempts to
mislead.

4) On August 4, 2007 @ 1:03pm I point out &quot;Bible Bob&quot;'s error where he
wrongly attributes the origin of the thread &quot;There is no Biblical fellowship
with someone who worships a different God&quot; with the following: &quot;If &quot;Bible
Bob&quot; wasn't so blinded with hatred he would have noticed the &quot;Re:&quot; in front
of the title indicating that I was responding to a thread started by someone
else.&quot;

5) However at 8:17pm of the same date, &quot;Bible Bob&quot; admits he recognized the
indicator but chose to ignore it. &quot;I noticed the &quot;Re&quot; when I went to cut and
paste the subject into the post but chose not to use it.&quot; This shows &quot;Bible
Bob&quot; knew it was a thread started by someone else, admitted he did noticed
the &quot;Re:&quot; but chose to intentionally discard it. This shows clear motive to
deceive.

Documented lies and heresies from &quot;Bible Bob&quot; Sowle

[Updated: August 19, 2007 - 12:53pm Eastern U.S. Time]

August 18, 2007

&quot;You [Carl] would agree with the devil (and have been agreeing with the
devil tonight) so long as they speak against me so that you can sporing
[sic] board off their comment into a bunch of your lies.&quot; [Once again &quot;Bible
Bob&quot; attacks me and others for warning people of &quot;Bible Bob&quot; heresies. As
usual, he uses his typical smear tactics.]

&quot;Did you notice that chuck, like you, does what so many fakes do; made an
assertion with nothing to back it up.  A nonspecific assertion at that.  Not
even stating what essential Christian belief it is that I deny.  The trinity
is not an essential belief according to the Scriptures.  That is a tradition
of men a pharisitical belief of unlearned hyperreligious fundamentalists.&quot;
[And here we have &quot;Bible Bob&quot; admitting he denies the essential Biblical
doctrine of the Trinity and in the process intentionally misrepresenting
what the Bible teaches.]

&quot;So far tonight, you a trinitarian have banded with a Oneness person you
hate because of his religion and now with a woman whose lifestyle you hate
all so that you can manifest hate towards me.  Another indicator of the
spirit that motivates you.&quot; [Again &quot;Bible Bob&quot; is intentionally
misrepresenting. I pointed out that &quot;Bible Bob&quot; is a heretic according to
the false teachings he espouses. Just because &quot;a Oneness person&quot; and another
also see that fact does not mean I agree with them on all things.
Furthermore, &quot;Bible Bob&quot; once again tries to portray me as filled with hate.
In this response by &quot;Bible Bob&quot; he accuses me of hating &quot;a Oneness person&quot;
and a woman and also &quot;Bible Bob.&quot; I hate none of these people regardless of
whether I agree with them or not. Nothing in my words are of a hateful
nature. What I do hate is &quot;Bible Bob&quot;'s false doctrines, slander, lies and
malice all of which are unGodly and abhorrent in God's eyes. We are taught
to hate the sin and not the sinner and that's exactly what I have been doing
and continue to do. I actually pray for &quot;Bible Bob.&quot;]

&quot;I was not joking and I was not being mean when I told you that you needed
to get honest with God.  Look how low you have stooped since those days.&quot;
[This response by &quot;Bible Bob&quot; was aimed at someone else but notice how
appropriate the advice is for &quot;Bible Bob&quot; to take. He needs to get &quot;honest
with God&quot; because he teaches false doctrine and his words &amp; deeds are of a
decidedly unchristian nature according to scriptures. As documented in this
text file, &quot;Bible Bob&quot; has indeed stooped low in his words and deeds
attacking others with deceit, malice, arrogance, etc.]

&quot;Yes, I reversed the verses, for the sake of emphasizing that the reason you
are foolish laden with sins is because your form of godliness is a
counterfeit [sic].&quot; [Interesting that &quot;Bible Bob&quot; accuses someone else of
having a counterfeit form of &quot;godliness&quot; {please note &quot;Bible Bob&quot;
intentionally using a lower case spelling} when his exhibitions on Usenet
show a counterfeit form of Godliness. He attempts to put on a show of
Godliness a la the Pharisees but his words and deeds expose him as an
ungodly individual posing as a righteous Christian. God warned us that false
teachers like &quot;Bible Bob&quot; would try to disguise themselves in sheep's
clothing but inward are actually ravenous wolves. I urge my Christian
brethren to take heed of the evidence within this text file of &quot;Bible Bob&quot;'s
words and deeds and take note that he is no man of God but a heretic
attempting to lead even the elect astray.]

&quot;I do not belong to any religious group.  None as in zero.&quot; [And since
&quot;Bible Bob&quot; denies several essential Christian doctrines and teaches falsely
he does not belong to Christianity either. &quot;Bible Bob&quot; is the founder, sole
member and chief priest of the &quot;Church of 'Bible Bob'&quot; TM. In his church, he
is the sole authority according to &quot;Bible Bob&quot; and if anyone exposes his
errors, they will be attacked, smeared and lied about. According to &quot;Bible
Bob&quot; his teachings are better than anyone else and all other teachers are
wrong. That is the church of &quot;Bible Bob&quot;, a church without the one true God,
a church without Jesus Christ (God manifest in flesh, the second person of
the Trinity), a church without the Holy Spirit (who is the third person of
the Trinity). Beware of the &quot;Church of 'Bible Bob'&quot; TM my Christian brethren
for it is antichrist.]

&quot;You just proved that your hatred for me is stronger than you love for God
or even your denomination.&quot; [Again &quot;Bible Bob&quot; falsely accuses me of hating
him. It must make him feel more important if he accuses others of hating him
regardless of whether they do or not. In my case, I do not nor ever have
hated &quot;Bible Bob&quot; and his accusations of hatred are false. False accusations
are one of the staples of &quot;Bible Bob&quot;'s posts and are an unGodly practice
that God abhors.]

&quot;Ain't it grand when a pretender exposes himself to the whole world as a
hatemonger and a deceiver?&quot; [Interesting how self-descriptive &quot;Bible Bob&quot;'s
words can be. Also note the prideful arrogance exhibited by &quot;Bible Bob&quot; in
the way he worded this.]

&quot;Take you [Carl] and some of the other fundamentalists that post to the
group. You [Carl] preach the oral traditions you have been taught and are
loyal to those traditions.  Pharisees were oral traditionalists, just like
you are.&quot; [And here we see &quot;Bible Bob&quot; using the strawman fallacy form of
argument. He creates something that is not there and tears it down trying to
support his position. This is a logical error and shows a lack of substance
in &quot;Bible Bob&quot;'s point. &quot;Bible Bob&quot; redefines fundamentalist Christianity
into something that it is not. He does this knowingly and in a disingenuous
fashion thereby proving more words of deceit.]

&quot;How many times have you [Carl] been asked to prove your views from the
Scriptures?  Many times.  You cannot so do not.&quot; [Actually I have as well as
numerous other Christians but &quot;Bible Bob&quot; can only respond with denials of
documented fact. Please check Google { http://groups.google.com/ } which has
documented the numerous refutations of &quot;Bible Bob&quot;'s heresies by Christians
throughout the years.]

&quot;Do you now you think yourself as a mini-god able to order others about?
Your order &quot;Pray for them&quot; is an indicator that you think yourself above
everyone else.&quot; [Now &quot;Bible Bob&quot; attempts to smear by accusing me falsely of
thinking myself a &quot;mini-god&quot; when I have never done so. When I said &quot;Pray
for them&quot; I was making a request that is Biblically based and justified by
God's commands. Is &quot;Bible Bob&quot; now opposing God's instruction for us to pray
for others? It certainly sounds like it.]

&quot;You are busted in another lie, worker of iniquity.  There is only one Jesus
Christ.&quot; [There is indeed only one Jesus Christ but since &quot;Bible Bob&quot;
teaches a Jesus that is not divine, &quot;Bible Bob&quot; teaches a false Jesus and
not the Jesus Christ of the Bible. &quot;Bible Bob&quot; denies the deity of Jesus
Christ therefore &quot;Bible Bob&quot;s Jesus is not the one and true Jesus Christ,
our Lord and Savior. This is another essential doctrine of Christianity that
&quot;Bible Bob&quot; opposes with heresy. Please also note that &quot;Bible Bob&quot; attempts
to smear once again by falsely calling me a &quot;worker of iniquity.&quot;]

I challenged you to prove your lies; not document my truths which you
present as lies.&quot; [Actually, as documented, &quot;Bible Bob&quot; challenged me to
show where he lied. This he challenged me on multiple occasions so I began
compiling and documenting his lies and deceptions into this text file which
I have been updating periodically with &quot;Bible Bob&quot;'s own words.]

&quot;I see, you think there is more than one Jesus Christ.&quot; [Typical
misrepresentation by &quot;Bible Bob.&quot; I believe in the Jesus Christ of the Bible
who is God manifest in flesh, the second person of the Trinity. &quot;Bible Bob&quot;
on the other hand denies the deity of Jesus Christ and has referred to Jesus
Christ as &quot;a god.&quot; This shows that &quot;Bible Bob&quot;'s Jesus is a false Jesus.]

&quot;Once again Kelly deliberately misinterprets.  Here is what the post said:&quot;
[It's quite hypocritical and equally as telling to witness &quot;Bible Bob&quot;
claiming someone &quot;deliberately misinterprets&quot; when &quot;Bible Bob&quot; does it
routinely. Does &quot;Bible Bob&quot; find it acceptable to do what he finds
objectionable by others? Seems that way.]

&quot;You are lying as usual.  I did not twist words.  I quoted what Carl said
and showed what the quote that Carl used said.&quot; [Actually &quot;Bible Bob&quot; lies
in this claim. &quot;Bible Bob&quot; to use his own words) &quot;deliberately
misinterprets&quot; and did so when he used only a PARTIAL quote and not the
COMPLETE quote plus he too the PARTIAL quote OUT OF CONTEXT and then
attempted to twist its meaning into a deceptive pretzel. Typical &quot;Bible Bob&quot;
dishonesty.]

August 17, 2007

&quot;Now let's talk about your repeated line

'Documented lies and heresies from &quot;Bible Bob&quot; Sowle'

Which is, of course, a lie because you haven't shown one lie or heresy from
that wonderful child of God, Bible Bob.  You ahve [sic] used that line in at
least a dozen posts which means you are responsible for at least a dozen
lies not to mention the many others you have told in other posts.&quot; [A very
weak attempt at deception by &quot;Bible Bob&quot; since this text file documents
dozens of lies from &quot;Bible Bob.&quot; Google ( http://groups.google.com/ )
effectively documents the numerous refutations of &quot;Bible Bob&quot;'s heresies by
Christians throughout the years. So once again, &quot;Bible Bob&quot; proves to be a
liar and false accuser.]

&quot;Do the Baptists or the Methodists teach you to lie so much?  Who taught you
how to lie the best, Baptists or Mthodists [sic]?  Who pays you the most to
lie?  Baptists or Methodists?&quot; [More smear attempts by &quot;Bible Bob.&quot; Since he
cannot handle nor address documented truth he chooses instead to conjure up
this conspiratorial theory out of whole cloth.]

&quot;Carl, you are not documenting anything that contains lies or heresy other
than your own lies and heresy?&quot; [Interesting that &quot;Bible Bob&quot; would
improperly put a question mark on the end of his statement. However improper
grammar aside, this text file effectively documents dozens of &quot;Bible Bob&quot;
lies, smear attempts, slander, and other dishonest deeds of &quot;Bible Bob&quot;
Sowle. Detailed documentations of the numerous refutations of &quot;Bible Bob&quot;'s
heresies can be found via Google's newsgroups search engine
( http://groups.google.com/ ).]

&quot;I'm the gut [sic] you won't wear down or scare off.  I know how Satan works
through hyperreligious fundamentalists hypocrites such as yourself.  I am
not ignorant of his devices and I able to spot his workers by what they
write in their posts.  As long as you are working with Satan, you are
working against God, the Lord Jesus Christ, and the body of Christ which
makes you antichrist.&quot; [Here &quot;Bible Bob&quot; flatters himself and strokes his
own ego since I am neither attempting to wear him down nor scare off. He
challenged me to document his lies and I took him up on his challenge and
created this growing text file of &quot;Bible Bob&quot;'s own words as well as
rebuttal and exposés of his slanders and deceptions. Please note &quot;Bible Bob&quot;
falsely accusing me of &quot;working with Satan,&quot; &quot;working against God,&quot; and
being antichrist - none of which is true. My posts bear this out and my
conscience is clear on this (1 Peter 3:16). Being attacked in such a manner
by a heretic like &quot;Bible Bob&quot; is nothing new. In fact, God warned us
Christians that we would be persecuted for standing up to heretics and
rightly dividing the Word of God properly. Overall, &quot;Bible Bob&quot; hates it
that his own words condemn him so he lashes out as usual with malice, hate,
slander and deception. God abhors all of that and teaches Christians should
not engage in any of them. Yet &quot;Bible Bob&quot; calls himself Christian yet
willfully and repeatedly puts forth words of malice, hate, slander and
deception some of which are documented accurately in this text file.]

&quot;You have made it clear that you do not know the Scriptures.  You have been
unable to post a decent rightly divided word of God post since you have been
posting to the f.c group.&quot; [Actually in the over 15 years of posting to
Usenet Christian newsgroups I have shown that I indeed rightly divide
scripture and also the sermons, lessons, and articles I post also rightly
divide scripture. &quot;Bible Bob&quot; has been exposed as promoting heretical
doctrine and opposing essential Christian doctrines. So this is merely
another intentional misrepresentation on &quot;Bible Bob&quot;'s part.]

&quot;All you have been able to put together are articles written by the men you
worship and obey in lieu of God and the Lord Jesus Christ.  Those men who
are your gods are not real gods.  You are dilusional [sic] for thinking that
they are and that is a symptom of schizophrenia.&quot; [More smear attempts by
&quot;Bible Bob.&quot; I never have worshipped men nor are men my gods. This is a lie
&quot;Bible Bob&quot; throws out in a very weak attempt to discredit me and also
discredit the Biblically based sermons, lessons, and articles that I have
cites and posted. Furthermore, it's interesting that &quot;Bible Bob&quot; puts forth
a psychological evaluation even though he is not qualified to do so. He's
wrong on that point as well but what are facts when one can spew forth a
nice slander like &quot;Bible Bob&quot; did here?]

&quot;The darkness in you is not of God.  It is the fruit of your obedience to
your gods.  Flee spiritual fornication, run to the Father and confess your
sins, and then begin telling teh truth and being honest and worshipping the
right God.&quot; [There is no darkness is my heart. The Holy Spirit lives in my
heart and drove out darkness long ago. The God I worship is the one true and
living God (Exodus 20:2,3, Deuteronomy 4:35) who exists as the Father
(Ephesians 4:6), the Son (Titus 2:13; John 1:1-14, 20:28) and the Holy
Spirit (Acts 5:3-4), and that He is worthy of all honor, praise and glory as
the Creator, Sustainer, and Beginning and End of all things (Revelation
4:11;5:9,10; Isaiah 43:1,7,21). And no lie of &quot;Bible Bob&quot; can contradict
that.]

The following is a portion of a response &quot;Bible Bob&quot; made to someone else
but is a highly revealing and hypocritical accusation at the same time.

&quot;Smart of you to snip out the parts the [sic] proved you wrong.&quot; [If one
takes a look at &quot;Bible Bob&quot;'s plethora of posts in response to others who
have proven him wrong on several items of note, one will discover that
&quot;Bible Bob&quot; regularly will &quot;snip out the parts the [sic] proved [&quot;Bible
Bob&quot;] wrong&quot;. In fact, &quot;Bible Bob&quot; has been shown (several examples
documented in this text file) to &quot;snip out&quot; selectively people's posts to
intentionally misrepresent what they originally did post. Fortunately this
is exposed by searching Google or reading the thread in context. So in
&quot;Bible Bob&quot;'s mind it is objectionable when someone snips out part of his
reply but perfectly acceptable for &quot;Bible Bob&quot; to &quot;snip out&quot; and selectively
edit replies to him. Is this not the epitome of hypocrisy? Is this not an
example of a &quot;Bible Bob&quot; double-standard? The answer to both questions is a
resounding &quot;yes.&quot;]

August 16, 2007

&quot;Let's see, [John] Wesley, wasn't he the Methodist who wanted to replace
God's function of renewing the mind with works of the flesh.&quot; [No, &quot;Bible
Bob&quot; he wasn't but &quot;Bible Bob&quot; enjoys slandering those who oppose &quot;Bible
Bob&quot;'s false doctrine.]

&quot;What do you think about his theological stance promoting division in the
body of Christ; the I'm better and holier than you are form of religion that
came to be know [sic] as Methodist?&quot; [Again &quot;Bible Bob&quot; shows either a
complete ignorance of history and theology of Methodism or &quot;Bible Bob&quot; is
intentionally misrepresenting it. Knowing &quot;Bible Bob&quot;'s history, it's
probably a combination of both although a higher percentage being the latter
rather than the former.]

&quot;What you are doing is called sin rationalization.  You look for other
people's approval of your behavior and if you find something that you mind
can twist to ease your conscience, you will use it.  I am sure from your
prospective that you as 100% in harmony with whatever this guy says below.
I'm not going to waste my time reading it to compare you to it.&quot; [Another
blatantly dishonest misrepresentation from &quot;Bible Bob.&quot; It's typical.]

&quot;Your statement above says more than anything I can say because it proves
you to be a self centered self rightious [sic] fraud who lives only for the
approval of men.  Man worship is not good for you.  You should repent and
worship the One True God and His Son Jesus Christ.  Then you can learn what
love is and how to do it.  Your political correctness sense of self worth
will defeat you.&quot; [More attempts to smear and slander from &quot;Bible Bob.&quot; Once
again &quot;Bible Bob&quot; fraudulently accuses me of &quot;man worship&quot; which is
something I never have done. &quot;Bible Bob&quot; throws it out as a weapon (a rather
dull and ineffective weapon) against me but I am of good conscience and know
that I worship the one true and living God (Exodus 20:2,3, Deuteronomy 4:35)
who exists as the Father (Ephesians 4:6), the Son (Titus 2:13; John 1:1-14,
20:28) and the Holy Spirit (Acts 5:3-4), and that He is worthy of all honor,
praise and glory as the Creator, Sustainer, and Beginning and End of all
things (Revelation 4:11;5:9,10; Isaiah 43:1,7,21). Nothing &quot;Bible Bob&quot; can
do or say changes that fact. &quot;Bible Bob&quot;'s words here were in response to a
sermon by Ray Stedman that I posted entitled &quot;Love And Hate&quot; and &quot;Bible
Bob&quot;s
words show a marked amount of hatred on his part.]

&quot;Why does quoting the word of God make you [Carl] go bonkers?&quot; [It doesn't,
but this is another example of the &quot;Bible Bob&quot; smear campaign in action.]

&quot;Why is it that you never respond with the word of God; only your foolish
childishness and statements that reveal your real motive and nature?&quot;
[Never? Well, a simple Google search will prove conclusively that to be
another false accusation by &quot;Bible Bob.&quot; I've refuted several of his
heresies with the Word of God. The sermons, lessons, articles, etc. I have
posted and cited ALL have as their central source of information the Word of
God. This is yet another example of the lies &quot;Bible Bob&quot; will throw out in
his desperation.]

&quot;You really do need to repent of wrong behavior; for your sake and the sake
of your family; for the sake of the body of Christ, and most important for
God sake.  You are not impressing God with your lies and immaturity.&quot; [Let's
see, &quot;Bible Bob&quot; demanded that I document what I consider his lies and
examples of his deception. I go about it in a methodical and accurate manner
and &quot;Bible Bob&quot; pitches hissy fits like this falsely accusing me of &quot;lies
and immaturity&quot; in response. Warning others of a heretic like &quot;Bible Bob&quot;
with his own words is not &quot;wrong behavior.&quot; Warning others of heretics is
actually Biblically sound instruction as found in 1 Timothy and elsewhere in
scriptures.]

&quot;At some point in time the trinity lie will die.  The death of all false
doctrines is inevitable.  It's just a matter of time when those who have
believed false doctrines and spoke about them as true doctrines will have to
face judgment.  Before that happens, while they are alive, they will suffer
consequences for their wrong beliefs and the wrong behavior that wrong
beliefs produce.&quot; [First off, let's establish the fact that &quot;Bible Bob&quot;
denies the Biblically taught doctrine of the Trinity. As with all deniers,
they have to resort to dishonesty to support their denials. &quot;Bible Bob&quot; is
no exception and his dishonesty is well documented. Secondly, with all
Biblically taught doctrine, it will endure forever. It will never die. The
Trinity was taught by early church fathers as far back as the middle of the
1st century A.D. and has been an essential doctrine of the Christian faith
even before then and certainly since then. And with essentials of
Christianity, it comes under attack by heretics over the centuries. Arians,
Modalists, etc. - all teaching heresies in contradiction to sound Biblical
doctrine. &quot;Bible Bob&quot; is merely another heretic in a long time of them. A
Christian seminary professor recently told me that heretics like &quot;Bible Bob&quot;
&quot;are a dime a dozen. Knock this one down, and you have a million more to
go.&quot; True.]

&quot;The first chapter of the book we incorrectly call the Gospel of John is
often used as a tool to deceive people into believing something that the
book does not teach.  Either men are liars or God, Jesus Christ, and John
are less intelligent than those who preach lies about them.&quot; [Actually, the
Gospel of John does teach the Trinity but &quot;Bible Bob&quot;'s denials have all
been thoroughly refuted by many Christians over the years. As documented,
the liar in this case is &quot;Bible Bob.&quot;]

&quot;That is a good example of a reprobate mind.  It is okay for him to demand
that Glenn be killed and make fale [sic] accusation [sic] against Glenn,
myself and others; but by God one better not misspell [sic] his name.  It
doesn't matter who started the thread.  What matters is what Carl wrote in
the thread.  What he wrote was vile and evil.  He accused me of prooftexting
(which is what he does) when what I did was quote what he said followed by
the verses he cited.  Carl is the prooftexter that uses material out of
context, as above, to weasle [sic] out of situations he gets himself into.&quot;
[Once again, &quot;Bible Bob&quot; attempts to smear by falsely accusing me of
demanding someone be killed. Never happened. But truth and facts don't sway
&quot;Bible Bob&quot; from what he perceives as being a good smear campaign. Secondly,
it does matter who started the thread because on more than one occasion he
made it a point to make it appear that I started it when I did not and
proved it with headers. &quot;Bible Bob&quot; acknowledged the header and admitted
that he ignored it and kept false attributing the thread to me. This proves
conclusively once again that &quot;Bible Bob&quot; intentionally deceives and is a
liar which is an abomination in God's eyes. Thirdly, as evidenced in this
text file, &quot;Bible Bob&quot; does indeed prooftext as well as misquote,
selectively partial quote, edits quotes and takes quotes out of context all
with malicious and dishonest intent. This is also proven conclusively by
materials within this text document. Once again, &quot;Bible Bob&quot; goes against
God and shows rotten fruit rather than the fruit of the Spirit. Finally, if
you read my quote below, I gave &quot;Bible Bob&quot; the benefit of the doubt on the
misspelling of my name since he is not a perfect speller. It was a non-issue
and I treated it as such. However &quot;Bible Bob&quot; treats it as is I pitched a
hissy fit over it. Fact is, I could not care less if he or anyone else
misspells my name. It doesn't bother me. I just find it interesting that he
continued to do so over a lengthy period of time. I question his motives.
Once again, &quot;Bible Bob&quot; shows beyond a shadow of a doubt that his heart is
wicked and darkened. The evidence as provided herein proves it. My Christian
brethren need to save this text file for future reference in regards to the
heretic and deceiver known on Usenet as &quot;Bible Bob&quot; Sowle.]

&quot;The requirement to believe in the trinity or lose your salvation is a work.
The requirement to believe in the trinity of [sic] burn in hell is a work.&quot;
[Once again &quot;Bible Bob&quot; attempts to put words in my posts that were never
there. I have said all along and have proven it from the Holy Scriptures as
well as historical record that the Trinity is taught in the Bible. It
remains an essential doctrine. Here &quot;Bible Bob&quot; attempts to put his own
heretical spin by misdefining &quot;work.&quot; Furthermore, as &quot;Bible Bob&quot; attempted
to claim, neither the Baptist denomination nor the Methodist denomination
teach nor believe in a salvation by works doctrine. &quot;Bible Bob&quot;'s claim is a
lie and clearly a smear tactic.]

&quot;All you [Carl] are doing by your present conduct is proving  yourself to be
a raving delusional [sic] lunatic who hates others and wants his own petty
ways about everything in life.&quot; [More malice and lies from &quot;Bible Bob&quot; as
well as more ad hominem.]

&quot;But go ahead and keep on attacking me and making your false accusations
against me.&quot; [No attacking. Just quoting what &quot;Bible Bob&quot; has posted as
evidence that he requested some months ago. I include the dates &quot;Bible
Bob&quot;'s
comments were posted so anyone may do a Google search on Usenet newsgroups
( http://groups.google.com/ ) to verify that &quot;Bible Bob&quot; actually made the
comments which I document in this text file. This text file is in response
to &quot;Bible Bob&quot;'s repeated claims to prove he made the statements I claim he
made as well as documentation of the unbiblical nature in which &quot;Bible Bob&quot;
posts. Furthermore, this text file documents the malice, deceit, slander and
other ungodly posts from &quot;Bible Bob&quot; which proves from a Biblical standpoint
the evil and wickedness that is within &quot;Bible Bob.&quot; It is the malice,
deceit, slander and unGodly words from &quot;Bible Bob&quot; that make him unclean,
indicate a depraved mind and expose a hardened heart.]

&quot;The sad thing is that all I have been trying to do is help you turn from
sin, repent, confesses [sic] your sins to the father, and start behing [sic]
like a real Christian.&quot; [Obviously another lie from &quot;Bible Bob&quot;, a heretic
who denies the essential doctrines of the Christian faith. &quot;Bible Bob&quot; has
been shown to be a ravenous wolf pretending to be one of the flock of Jesus
Christ yet his heresies, his malice, his vitriolic attacks expose him as an
unrepentant heretic.]

A person known as Vernono O wrote the following to me:

&quot;You will only receive hate in any conversation with Bible Bob.&quot;

I responded lightheartedly with:

&quot;I kind of figured that out. :-)&quot;

Not surprisingly, &quot;Bible Bob&quot; responded with his usual malice and deception:

&quot;Carl,

In other words both you and Vernon do not know the difference between

love and hate.  Refusal to worship you is not hate; that's love.&quot;

[Please note, I never requested, demanded, implied, required, asked (or
anything similarly) that I be worshipped. This is yet another clearcut and
irrefutable evidence of &quot;Bible Bob&quot;'s dishonesty. Secondly, as I have well
documented, &quot;Bible Bob&quot;'s malicious slanders, smears and lies are also clear
cut and irrefutable evidence of &quot;Bible Bob&quot;'s hatred. No reasonable
individual can deny this after reading all the examples I proved in this
text document as well as a simple Google search of Usenet newsgroups
( http://groups.google.com/ -- keyphrase search &quot;Bible Bob&quot;).]

&quot;Fact.  You quoted a section of Scripture which deals with turning a person
over to Satan for the destruction of the flesh.  Hence, you were preaching
that Glenn should be killed.  The reason the person was to be turned over to
Satan was because he lusted after his fathers wife.  Hence, since you were
talking about Glenn and citing those verses about Glenn you accusded [sic]
Glenn of sex with his fathers wife and declared Glenn worthy of death.&quot;
[Fiction. Actually a smear attempt by &quot;Bible Bob.&quot; Reference the entry
entitled &quot;A series showing intentional and admitted deception by &quot;Bible
Bob&quot;&quot; which explains in detail how &quot;Bible Bob&quot; is attempting to mislead.]

&quot;Carl McCasky [sic] has proven himself to be a deceiver on numerous
occassions [sic].  But this time in his attempt to deceive readers in his
post titled &quot;There is no Biblical fellowship with someone who worships a
different God&quot;, Carl went way to far.&quot; [Please refer to the entry entitled
&quot;A series showing intentional and admitted deception by &quot;Bible Bob&quot;&quot; which
shows that the entry &quot;Bible Bob&quot; refers to was started by a person known on
Usenet as ®andy and that &quot;Bible Bob&quot; has recognized and admitted this fact
yet intentionally chooses to misrepresent it. Also it is interesting that
&quot;Bible Bob&quot; has started undertaking the misspelling of my name. It's not the
easiest one to remember how it is spelled so I will give him the benefit of
a doubt since his spelling is not perfect.]

&quot;He [Carl] accused Glenn of committing fornication with his own mother, his
father's wife.&quot; [This is a fabrication by &quot;Bible Bob&quot; in a repeat of the
attempt he made before. Please refer to the entry entitled &quot;A series showing
intentional and admitted deception by &quot;Bible Bob&quot;&quot; to see again why this is
a false accusation.]

&quot;Here is what Carl wrote:

I and other Christians have rejected Glenn's heresies and even though he has
been corrected by many Christians he still refuses to correct his errors
which leads we Christians to have nothing further to do with him (Romans
16:17; 1 Cor. 5:4-13;...&quot; [Please note &quot;Bible Bob&quot; neglected to present my
COMPLETE quote. Again please refer to the entry entitled &quot;A series showing
intentional and admitted deception by &quot;Bible Bob&quot;&quot; and note that he leaves
off several passages I cite, the common theme being instructions to
Christians to have nothing to do with heretics and their heresies. &quot;Bible
Bob&quot; is resorting to misquoting and taking the partial quote out of context
to try to slander me.]

&quot;Carl demands that Christians deliver Glenn to Satan for the destruction of
the flesh.  Why?  According to the context it is because Glenn had sex with
his father's wife.

What kind of &quot;Christian&quot; would make such a charge against another man? Would
any of you men charge another man with screwing his own mother? That is not
a &quot;man&quot; thing to do because normal men do not even think that way.  And I
can't think of one woman who would do such a thing either.&quot; [I never made
any such demand. &quot;Bible Bob&quot; had to prooftext and take out all the other
Bible passages I cited where the common theme making my point is the
instruction to Christians not to have anything to do with heretics and their
heresies. The fact that he refuses to include the remaining passages shows a
marked lack of honesty and a serious intent of malice on his part.]

&quot;Carl owes Glenn and all of us an apology.  For Carl to demand Glenn's death
at the hand of Satan for fornication with his own mother is not an exercise
of free speech.  It is a demon exercising Carl.&quot; [Since I never made any
such demand and since &quot;Bible Bob&quot; is misrepresenting what I posted, I do not
owe Glenn an apology. Actually for this evil exercise in deception from
&quot;Bible Bob&quot; he needs to beg for forgiveness.]

&quot;You, yourself, Carl McCasky [sic], believe that works are necessary for
salvation and you are the Baptist Methodist cult I was specifically talking
about.&quot; [Another misrepresentation by &quot;Bible Bob&quot; since I do not nor ever
have believed that works are necessary for salvation. If anyone cares to
check, please do a Google search for my posts concerning salvation and you
will see that I espouse the Biblical teaching that salvation is by faith in
Jesus Christ as one's Lord and Savior and it is by God's grace that we
receive that salvation.]

August 10, 2007

After pointing out that &quot;Bible Bob&quot; really only cares about himself, &quot;Bible
Bob&quot; responds with &quot;Nah, I care about rescuing you from the consequences
[sic] of sin.&quot; [Interesting wording. Is &quot;Bible Bob&quot; implying that he can
rescue me from the consequences of sin? Sure seems that way. But that's
something only Jesus Christ did for us when He was crucified for our sins.
Could this be a Freudian slip on &quot;Bible Bob&quot;'s part?]

Also on July 10, &quot;Bible Bob&quot; posted the following to me:

&quot;Showing your true colors again, I see.  Telling the big lies and sticking
to them in your best Third Reich style.  You learned Hitler's Goebbels &quot;tell
the big lie and stick to it well.&quot;  Now that you have that under your belt,
maybe you can find to study the word of God.&quot;

Then two paragraphs later he demands:

&quot;Prove one of your malicious slanderous claims, Carl.  You can't.  If you
could you would have posted the documentation fifty times.&quot;

[Reasonable individuals would consider accusing someone of being in the
&quot;Third Reich&quot; (a Nazi reference) is being quite malicious and slanderous as
well.]

---

August 10, 2007

&quot;You [Carl] are about as &quot;spiritual&quot; as a three year old; except the three
year old wouldn't be evil like you [Carl].&quot; [And &quot;Bible Bob&quot; doesn't
consider calling someone else evil not a malicious act when it is clearly
not true? I know I am sinful because I am not perfect but I am not evil.
Just another smear tactic by &quot;Bible Bob.&quot;]

&quot;When did I call a cult children of God?&quot; [&quot;Bible Bob&quot; referred to Jehovah's
Witnesses and their parent organization as &quot;children of God&quot; on multiple
occasions. &quot;Bible Bob&quot; referred to Mormons and their parent organization as
&quot;children of God&quot; on multiple occasions.]

&quot;Face it Carl, you are a hate monger and a messenger of Satan sent by Satan
to harm the children of God that you chose to speak evil of.&quot; [More
malicious slander from &quot;Bible Bob&quot; Sowle.]

August 9, 2007

&quot;Carl, you are joking aren't you?  If you aren't joking; what are you
smoking, or snorting, or shooting up, or inhaling, or drinking?  Your joking
right?  Please tell me you are joking or on drugs so I won't think you have
gone completely bonkers.&quot; [And right off, &quot;Bible Bob&quot; begins with the ad
hominem.]

&quot;What kind of ego would come up with &quot;The attempt to place the
responsibility on me for convincing you of the truth of the Biblical
doctrine of the Trinity that you already know, will not work.&quot; ?  I never
placed any responsibility on you.  Responsibility is delegated to those who
have the maturity, intellect, and stamina to handle the responsibility.  Why
would I place responsibility on you when you have proven yourself to be
immature, lacking in knowledge of the Scriptures, and without the stamina
necessary to complete the task I might assign you.&quot; [Continuing in the same
post, &quot;Bible Bob&quot; continues with his ad hominem and commits his first act of
attempted deception. On several occasions, &quot;Bible Bob&quot; demanded I prove his
errors and prove where he has lied. I did so at first yet all he could do
was respond with variations of &quot;you didn't prove anything.&quot; Therefore when
&quot;Bible Bob&quot; claims &quot;I never placed any responsibility on you&quot; he is lying.]

&quot;I have not said the hogwash you said I said.&quot; [Well, the &quot;hogwash&quot;
appropriately enough, is documented in this text file and further examples
can be seen through a simple Google search on Usenet newsgroups. Again
&quot;Bible Bob&quot; is attempting to deceive.]

&quot;I blame you for being arrogant, and hateful, and ignorant of the Scriptures
and for worshipping man gods.&quot; [More slander and attempted deception from
&quot;Bible Bob.&quot;]

&quot;I have been studing [sic] the trinity doctrine for thirty years and know it
better than you do which is why I am able to counter every one of your
wrongly divided presentations with truth from the word of God.&quot; [Actually
&quot;Bible Bob&quot; has only countered with prooftexting, erroneous definitions,
errors in Greek translations and grammar (some he made up himself that no
Greek scholars use) and intentional misrepresentations. He has denied many
essential doctrines of Biblical Christianity including, the Trinity, the
deity of Christ, salvation by grace via faith in Jesus and others. After
researching &quot;Bible Bob&quot;'s history on Usenet I discovered that many
Christians corrected his errors yet &quot;Bible Bob&quot; countered with falsehoods
and false teachings. &quot;Bible Bob&quot;, as documented in this text file as well as
Usenet has been refuted numerous times yet pretends they never happened.
&quot;Bible Bob&quot; is in denial.]

&quot;When you post one of your Joseph Smith posts and I see it is wrong; the
next article by your Joseph Smith will be ignored because he lost
credibility [sic] the first time.&quot; [I never posted any article by &quot;Joseph
Smith.&quot; &quot;Bible Bob&quot; may be confusing an author I did reference to the
founder of the Mormon church.]

&quot;Every time I try to communicate with you, you repond [sic] with Pope so and
so says so and so.&quot; [Again a clear and intentional misrepresentation on
&quot;Bible Bob&quot;'s part. I initially felt it appropriate to respond to him
directly but he kept claiming that my knowledge wasn't up to his level so I
deferred to folks like John Ankerberg, John MacArthur, John Wesley, Arthur
Pink and many other men of God (all of whom base their teachings solely on
the Word of God) who I knew were more knowledgeable than I that had written
refutation of the tired old heresies &quot;Bible Bob&quot; kept espousing. In
response, rather than addressing the gentlemen's points, &quot;Bible Bob&quot; started
accusing me of &quot;man worship&quot; {now he refers to my &quot;worship of man gods&quot;}
which is patently absurd and untrue. So rather than address their points,
&quot;Bible Bob&quot; engages in fallacies.]

&quot;I know the word of God because I study the word of God rather than what men
say about the word of God.  I have been careful to set myself under those
men and women who really love God and prove to me that they know God and
know God's word by their behavior and by rightly dividing the word of
truth.&quot; [Actually &quot;Bible Bob&quot; let it be known on more than one occasion that
he is self-taught and is subject to no one. Now he is flip-flopping?]

&quot;You are blowing smoke, trying to be intellectual and philosophical so you
can look like a spiritual big shot.  What you are really doing is showing
your lack of spirituality and loyalty to the systems of the world which are
under the control of the god of this world who is Satan.' [What is so ironic
and telling is that in this slander by &quot;Bible Bob&quot; he is in essence,
describing himself accurately.]

&quot;All I want to do is learn and do the word of God and love God, the Lord
Jesus Christ, and God's people.  I'm not here to argue or debate you.
Debating is a sin.  Look it up.&quot; [&quot;Debating is a sin&quot;? If so, then why does
&quot;Bible Bob&quot; revel in it and attempt to lure others into vain and pointless
arguments? Is this an example of &quot;Bible Bob&quot;'s hypocrisy? He wants to learn?
Then why does he constantly exhibit an unteachable spirit? If he wants to do
the Word of God then why does he routinely engage in slander, malicious
words, vitriolic posts, ad hominem and other behaviors that clearly do not
represent the Word of God? I feel that he is, as he wrote in an earlier
paragraph, &quot;trying to be intellectual and philosophical so [he] can look
like a spiritual big shot.&quot;]

&quot;You just wannabe a big shot that people will worship they way you worship
your men gods.&quot; [More slanderous lies from &quot;Bible Bob.&quot;]

&quot;You were led down the wrong path by false teachers as you prove every time
you post one of their articles.&quot; [If one were to believe &quot;Bible Bob&quot; it is
&quot;Bible Bob&quot; and only &quot;Bible Bob&quot; that presents complete and total Biblical
truth and all others are false teachers. Remember &quot;Bible Bob&quot; keeps telling
people things like &quot;You would be better off reading and following my
teachings than the teachings of the sects because mine are more accurate.&quot;
{June 30, 2007} A partial list of Christians I have cited materials include
Adam Clarke, Flavius Josephus, A.B. Bruce, John Calvin, John Ankerberg, John
MacArthur, John Wesley, James White, Walter Martin, Thomas Aquinas, Charles
Spurgeon, Arthur Pink, Ray Stedman, G.K. Chesterson, Jonathan Edwards,
Charles Finney, Matthew Henry, David Jeremiah, J. Vernon McGee, E.M. Bounds,
George Whitefield, Ron Rhodes, Robert Bowman Jr., John Bunyan, R.A. Torrey,
R.C. Sproul, Jerry Falwell, Ron Ritchie, John Weldon, Charles Stanley,
Oswald Chambers, Warren Doud, Scott Grant, Jay Hess, John Morehead, and
numerous others all of whom base their teachings solely on the Word of God.
However, &quot;Bible Bob&quot; declares all of them to be false teachers even though
he fails to show why they are false and he is true especially when what
&quot;Bible Bob&quot; teaches has been shown to be contrary to scripture.]

&quot;I learn very well from real teachers and from personal study and since I
have holy spirit in me it is possible to learn that way, too.&quot; [From &quot;Bible
Bob&quot;s own posts, the only real teacher according to &quot;Bible Bob&quot; is...&quot;Bible
Bob.&quot; As to his claim that the &quot;holy spirit&quot; {interesting that he keeps
using lower case} is in him, if it were truly the Holy Spirit, he wouldn't
be spreading slander and lies the way he does as documented here and
elsewhere.]

&quot;Thee [sic] is only one criterion for truth for me and that is the word of
God; not wrongly divided Bibles; but the word of God which you cannot relate
to because you don't know what it is. It's not the Bible, although the Bible
contains some of the word of God. Actually, it makes reference to all of it;
but twists the word of God into the doctrines of men.  I will be posting
something on that soon.&quot; [Now this is a telling paragraph from &quot;Bible Bob.&quot;
Here he is clearly claiming that the Bible contains only SOME of the word of
God. As he has claimed in the past, the translations we have today have been
twisted to support trinitarian doctrine. He keeps making this claim from
time to time with no proof whatsoever. This reminds me a lot of KJV-Only
extremists.]

&quot;Just because you are a false teacher does not mean that I can't learn from
you.  False teachers show me what not to learn and reveal the secrets behind
their false doctrines; not knowing that they are doing so.&quot; [Another
self-descriptive paragraph from &quot;Bible Bob.&quot; Through his attempt at slander,
he ends up accurately describing himself.]

&quot;Carl, you are the one who has made himself unteachable.  You have to
believe what your bosses tell you to believe; money and power is at stake.
I don't have to worry about that because my boss spent time on a stake.&quot;
[More slander from &quot;Bible Bob.&quot; It's also interesting that &quot;Bible Bob&quot;
rejects the Bible's teaching that Jesus was crucified on the cross and
embraces the Jehovah's Witnesses' claims that Jesus was killed on a stake.
Although &quot;Bible Bob&quot; denies being a Jehovah's Witness, he has supported just
about every false teaching a JW believes.]

&quot;You must do what you man gods tell you to do because that is the Third
Reich way.&quot; [Here's &quot;Bible Bob&quot; commits more ad hominem falsely accusing me
of not only worshiping &quot;man gods&quot; but also throws in a Nazi reference for
added emphasis. Does this give evidence of the &quot;holy spirit&quot; {as &quot;Bible Bob&quot;
references with lower case} within him? Perhaps if what the &quot;holy spirit&quot; he
has is not THE Holy Spirit of the Bible. Furthermore, does &quot;Bible Bob&quot;'s
words here give evidence of the fruit of the Spirit? No reasonable person
can answer any other way than with a resounding &quot;NO!&quot;]

&quot;You have exposed yourself as a fraud and an evil doer in this post and you
probably can't even see what you have done.  That's really sad because you
are wasting what God could use.&quot; [Another self-descriptive paragraph from
&quot;Bible Bob.&quot;]

&quot;Bible Bob has not denied the divine nature of Jesus Christ since the day he
was saved in 1976.&quot; [Interesting that &quot;Bible Bob&quot; refers to himself in the
third person in an arrogant manner. Anyway, here he lies again because he
has indeed denied the deity of Jesus Christ and in fact said the following
back in June about Jesus Christ: &quot;But He [Jesus Christ] is a god.&quot; Notice
&quot;Bible Bob&quot; is claming Jesus is &quot;a god&quot; not the one, true God manifest in
flesh as taught in the Bible. Even Thomas recognized and acknowledge the
deity of Jesus and Jesus commended him for it. So once again &quot;Bible Bob&quot; has
been caught in an attempt at deception.]

&quot;Not too smart.  You have not proof that I have ever denied the divine
nature of Jesus Christ.&quot; [Actually I have. In June, for example, &quot;Bible Bob&quot;
refers to Jesus Christ as &quot;a god&quot; and rejects the Biblically taught fact
that Jesus Christ is God manifest in flesh, the second person of the
Trinity. In short, &quot;Bible Bob&quot; rejects the deity of Jesus Christ.]

&quot;Satan is spirit and Jesus is still human; the man Jesus Christ the last
Adam with a human body animated by spirit rather than soul.&quot; [Where is this
taught in the Bible?]

&quot;Actually, the Holy Spirit is God (one of God's names or titles) and holy
spirit is the gift or agent of God.  The problem is that Bible editors added
&quot;the&quot; and capitalized holy and spirit to make the gift God so much that the
average reader doesn't know what a passage is talking about unless he cross
checks it with the Greek.  Here's the easy way to understand the difference.
The Holy Spirit has His habitation in the heavens while holy spirit is at
work on the earth in the ages.  The Holy Spirit is God the Giver while holy
spirit is the gift.  More often than not when the Bible says the Holy Ghost
(Spirit) (God the Giver)  the Greek reads (holy spirit) the gift (52 of 79
times, that's 58%).&quot; [&quot;Bible Bob&quot; is claiming two separate holy spirits? One
capitalized and one not? More ungodly heresy from &quot;Bible Bob.&quot; He's correct
when he says the &quot;Holy Spirit&quot; is God but in other posts he denies this
being part of the Trinity. This is an example of &quot;Bible Bob&quot; making claims
with no proof and exhibits poor understanding of Koine Greek.]

&quot;You need to fess up to being a man god worshipper and purveryor [sic] of
false doctrines, false charges, and hatred of others.&quot; [More slander and ad
hominen from &quot;Bible Bob.&quot;]

&quot;By other cult groups you must be referring to the Baptists and Methodists
who believe in being saved by works.&quot; [There is no Baptist nor Methodist
denomination that believes in salvation by works.]

---

August 5, 2007

&quot;I may think you [Carl] are a coward; but I did not say you [Carl] were a
coward.&quot; [Actually he has. For example on July 28, 2007 &quot;Bible Bob&quot; wrote &quot;I
suspect that Carl's post targets me in his usual cowardly way.&quot; June 24,
2007: &quot;You [Carl] have been to cowardly to try.&quot; There are other earlier
examples as well. However this shows another &quot;Bible Bob&quot; lie.]

&quot;Once again I catch you [Carl] in Third Reich mode imitating Adolph Hitler
and Joseph Goebell with your tell the big lie and stick to it behavior. You
[Carl] did not see any dishonesty from me.  The &quot;we&quot; in your [Carl] comment
must refer to a demon accomplice because no person in their right mind could
have saw what you [Carl] saw.&quot; [Now &quot;Bible Bob&quot; equates me with Nazism and
demonism as well. This is a desperation tactic common with people who have
lost the point.]

&quot;You religious money grabbers are too arrogant and prideful to take the time
to help the poor or the needy.  You want them big tithes and offerings and
have to use philosophy and intellect to woo your potential victims.&quot; [Here
&quot;Bible Bob&quot; makes a false accusation that I am desirous of money.]

A series showing intentional and admitted deception by &quot;Bible Bob&quot;

1) On July 27th, a Usenet poster using the nick ®andy posted an entry in
which he entitled &quot;There is no Biblical fellowship with someone who worships
a different God&quot;

2) On August 3, 2007 @ 12:13pm I responded to ®andy's post. In it I cited
seven passages from the Bible that have the common theme teaching that
Christians are to stay away from heretics and their heresies (Romans 16:17;
1 Cor. 5:4-13; 2 Thess 3:6, 14; 2 Tim. 3:5; Titus 3:10,11; 2 John 10).

3) At 9:40pm of August 3, 2007 &quot;Bible Bob&quot; responded but rather than address
all seven passages, he prooftexts 1 Cor. 5:4-13 to try to support his
attempted slander in a thread he began also at 9:40pm which he entitled
&quot;Carl McCaskey Accuses Glenn of Having Sex With His Own Mother&quot; which in of
itself is a false accusation on &quot;Bible Bob&quot;'s part. So &quot;Bible Bob&quot;
intentionally left off the context. A clear dishonest tactic. Also at the
very beginning of this thread, &quot;Bible Bob&quot; intentionally misrepresents again
when he wrote, &quot;But this time in his attempt to deceive readers in his post
titled &quot;There is no Biblical fellowship with someone who worships a
different God&quot;, Carl went way to far.&quot; As documented, the thread entitled
&quot;There is no Biblical fellowship with someone who worships a different God&quot;
was begun by ®andy, not myself. This is clear yet &quot;Bible Bob&quot; attempts to
mislead.

4) On August 4, 2007 @ 1:03pm I point out &quot;Bible Bob&quot;'s error where he
wrongly attributes the origin of the thread &quot;There is no Biblical fellowship
with someone who worships a different God&quot; with the following: &quot;If &quot;Bible
Bob&quot; wasn't so blinded with hatred he would have noticed the &quot;Re:&quot; in front
of the title indicating that I was responding to a thread started by someone
else.&quot;

5) However at 8:17pm of the same date, &quot;Bible Bob&quot; admits he recognized the
indicator but chose to ignore it. &quot;I noticed the &quot;Re&quot; when I went to cut and
paste the subject into the post but chose not to use it.&quot; This shows &quot;Bible
Bob&quot; knew it was a thread started by someone else, admitted he did noticed
the &quot;Re:&quot; but chose to intentionally discard it. This shows clear motive to
deceive.

July 14, 2007

&quot;You [Carl] have miserably failed to provide any scriptural evidence that
proves the Bible teaches the doctrine of the Trinity. You [Carl] have
provided, however, evidence that proves you [Carl] are a pagan who worships
the god people. Simply put - you [Carl] are a polytheist.&quot; [Once again
&quot;Bible Bob&quot; lies since I have provided clear evidence that the Bible teaches
the doctrine of the Trinity so &quot;Bible Bob&quot; can only lie about it and attempt
to smear me by falsely accusing me of being a polytheist implying that
Trinitarians are polytheists which is intellectually dishonest.]

&quot;Trinity doctrine is not found in the word of God.  Trinitarians did falsify
passages in the versions to make it look like a trinity exists.&quot; [&quot;Bible
Bob&quot; still denies the Trinity and then attempts to falsely claim that
Trinitarians falsified scripture to support it in a similar fashion as the
Watchtower Bible And Tract Society did to promote their heretical agenda.
However Trinitarians did not do as &quot;Bible Bob&quot; asserts. He provides no
evidence, just a smear attempt with no substantiation.]

In the same post I correctly say the following, &quot;The Bible also includes
many verses that show that Jesus is also God, and that the Holy Ghost is
also God.&quot;

&quot;Bible Bob&quot; responds with &quot;No it does not.  The Englist [sic] versions have
been infused with fallacies of accent to mislead people into believing
trinitarian doctrine.&quot; [Another false accusation with no evidence. &quot;Bible
Bob&quot; creates this out of whole cloth.]

How &quot;Bible Bob&quot; responds with a quote from the New King James Version:

&quot;Maybe if you stopped using a kiddie [sic] Bible&quot;

---

July 12, 2007

&quot;Carl is not man (or Christian enough) enough to answer me directly because
he knows he would be proven wrong&quot; [Actually &quot;Bible Bob&quot; is trying and has
been trying to lure me into vain arguments through provocative means. Since
Titus 3:9-11 teaches that I should not bother with heretics like &quot;Bible Bob&quot;
I'm not biting.]

---

July 11, 2007

&quot;It was trinitarians who came up with tdhe [sic] Giver and the gift
doctrine.&quot; [A clear falsehood from &quot;Bible Bob.&quot;]

&quot;Bible Bob&quot;'s opinion of John Wesley:

&quot;The late Mr [sic] Wesley sure had a problem with his scruples.&quot;

---

July 10, 2007

&quot;What a pathetic bunch of lies! Is this guy nuts? You are nuts for posting
such trash.&quot; [This in response to a post where I presented a sermon by a
Baptist minister. &quot;Bible Bob&quot; lacks the self-control and gentleness called
for by the Bible which he claims to follow.]

---

July 9, 2007

&quot;It is Trinitarians that think Jesus is an angel.&quot; [Again &quot;Bible Bob&quot;
perpetuates this intentional misrepresentation.]

---

July 8, 2007

&quot;There is no difference between a Baptist and a Jehovah's Witness&quot;
[Theologically speaking, there are plenty of differences between the Baptist
denomination and the Jehovah's Witnesses cult. &quot;Bible Bob&quot; is being
dishonest here as well.]

&quot;You and Carl are both false teachers as the false doctrines you preach
prove.  You and Carl attempt to deceive by saying that what I teach is false
doctrine.  But neither of you has substantiated from the word of God that
the doctrine I teach is false.  The best you can come up with is the
argument &quot;false teacher John MacArthur (or some other well known false
teacher from your cult) says such and such is true doctrine and since you
(BB) disagree with my (JW) man-god, you are a false teacher&quot;.  You cannot
document from the word of God that what I teach is false.  You rely on the
words of false teachers that you parrot for your authority.&quot; [What are the
&quot;false doctrines&quot; &quot;Bible Bob&quot; claims I teach? Salvation by the Grace of God
through faith in Jesus Christ. That Jesus Christ is God manifest in flesh.
That the Trinity is a Biblically sound doctrine. That Jesus always has been
and was not a created being. Please note the lack of the fruit of the Spirit
in the words of &quot;Bible Bob&quot; here. His insults and false accusations. I can
only speak for myself. I have substantiated all the doctrines I mentioned
earlier from the Word of God but &quot;Bible Bob&quot; summarily dismissed them all
with shoddy self-taught (as he has freely admitted) scholarship. A Google
search in Usenet groups will attest to this. As I rapidly discovered, &quot;Bible
Bob&quot; then began accusing me of having no formal Biblical training and not
knowing what I was talking about so I decided to present articles and
sermons from well-established Christian theologians and scholars who
presented the same orthodoxy that I had which effectively refuted &quot;Bible
Bob.&quot; And as you can see, rather than rebut what those people had written,
&quot;Bible Bob&quot; declares that I am &quot;worshipping men&quot; and that they are my &quot;man
gods.&quot; This is yet another example of how &quot;Bible Bob&quot; uses smear tactics
when his heresies have been thoroughly and effectively refuted.]

&quot;both of you say I teach false doctrine but never state what the doctrine is
that I teach&quot; [Again, this is yet a blatant lie. His denial of the Trinity,
his denial of the deity of Jesus, his unBiblical method of salvation, his
claim that Jesus was crucified on a stake and not the cross (a Jehovah's
Witness false doctrine as well) and merely some of the false doctrines that
I and several others have stated. This is yet another example of the denial
technique &quot;Bible Bob&quot; routinely utilizes. I and many others have addressed
specific false doctrines of &quot;Bible Bob&quot;'s yet &quot;Bible Bob&quot; denies anyone has.
This is &quot;Bible Bob&quot; being intentionally being obtuse and dishonest.]

&quot;You [Carl] promote hatred against the brethren in your antidenominational
posts.&quot; [I have never done any such thing. This is a &quot;Bible Bob&quot; smear
attempt.]

&quot;You [Carl] quote and promote your man gods.&quot;  [I have never done any such
thing. This is a &quot;Bible Bob&quot; smear attempt.]

&quot;It does not matter what you say Carl.&quot; [Now &quot;Bible Bob&quot; finally admits that
he rejects anything and everything I present.]

&quot;Flee spiritual fornication which is idolatry.&quot; [Another false accusation
from &quot;Bible Bob.&quot; Here he accuses me of &quot;spiritual fornication&quot; without
evidence and without merit.]

&quot;Stop worshipping yourself and your men gods and their doctrines and worship
the one true God and follow His Son Jesus Christ.&quot; [Here &quot;Bible Bob&quot; accuses
me of worshipping myself and &quot;men gods&quot; when I have done neither.
Furthermore he implies that I haven't been worshipping God when I have. Also
the wording of his accusation follows &quot;Bible Bob&quot;'s denial of the deity of
Jesus Christ which is Biblical doctrine.]

July 7, 2007

&quot;Trinitarians do teach that Jesus was an angel; so stop lying about it.&quot;
[This lie of &quot;Bible Bob&quot;'s is so patently absurd it becomes almost
laughable. It merely further proves &quot;Bible Bob&quot;'s intellectual dishonesty.]

&quot;True I am intelligent enough to reject the false doctrines of the trinity.&quot;
[&quot;Bible Bob&quot; admits to heresy.]

&quot;I am the guy that has been proving to you and others that Jesus Christ did
not exist until he was born except in the foreknowledge of God.&quot; [&quot;Bible
Bob&quot; admits that he denies Jesus Christ's infinite nature. Another heretical
stance.]

&quot;God says that I am right and that you are wrong.&quot; [&quot;Bible Bob&quot; claiming
divine knowledge? A new revelation? Jehovah God does not tell a heretic like
&quot;Bible Bob&quot; that he is right when &quot;Bible Bob&quot; denies Biblical truth.]

&quot;I am the Christian and you are the pretender.&quot; [&quot;Bible Bob&quot; now arrogantly
claims to know who is Christian and who isn't although &quot;Bible Bob&quot; has been
shown by his own words to teach heresy. Furthermore note how &quot;Bible Bob&quot;
refers to himself as &quot;the Christian&quot; not &quot;a Christian&quot; but &quot;THE Christian&quot;
as if he is the only one.]

&quot;You [Carl] are the one that manifests the most contempt for others and the
contempt and hatred that you [Carl] manifest in your posts makes your points
moot.&quot; [I have contempt for the lies and heresies from false teachers like,
and including, &quot;Bible Bob&quot; but I have presented nor have hatred towards
them. I feel pity for them. This is another &quot;Bible Bob&quot; lie.]

On July 1, 2007 I posted the following:

&quot;Why is it that so many people on Usenet, believers and unbelievers alike,
allege that you are arrogant and self centered and dishonest? Is it because
there is a conspiracy to destroy you and your ministry? Is it because
everybody is out to get you?  Or is it because both believers and
unbelievers &quot;see&quot; arrogance and self centeredness and dishonesty in what you
say and do?&quot;

A certain individual wrote this on Usenet in accusation of another. It's
amazing that is applied perfectly to himself. Can you guess who originally
wrote the words above?

On July 2, 2007 &quot;Bible Bob&quot; posted:

&quot;Nope.  Not me.&quot;

The words actually did come from &quot;Bible Bob&quot; in his attempt to smear someone
else. However when you read the comments:

&quot;Why is it that so many people on Usenet, believers and unbelievers alike,
allege that you are arrogant and self centered and dishonest? Is it because
there is a conspiracy to destroy you and your ministry? Is it because
everybody is out to get you?  Or is it because both believers and
unbelievers &quot;see&quot; arrogance and self centeredness and dishonesty in what you
say and do?&quot;

it is strikingly apt that it applies so strongly TO &quot;Bible Bob&quot; as evidenced
by his posts. And so many people, myself included, see so much arrogance,
self-centeredness and dishonesty in what &quot;Bible Bob&quot; says and does on
Usenet.

July 1, 2007

&quot;If memory serves me right it has been people like Jason Gastridge, John
Wolf, John Weatherly, Carl McCasky [sic], and checker - all hyperreligious
fundamentalist religionists - that post anti child of God posts under the
pretense of defending right doctrines [sic] which are really false
doctrines.&quot;

&quot;Why is it that members of the Baptist cult and the Methodist cult attack
the Jewhovah's [sic] Witness cult?&quot; [&quot;Bible Bob&quot; refers to Christian
denominations {Methodists and Baptists} as cults.]

&quot;What kind of fruit are they producing by attacking the children of God?&quot;
[NOTE: Here &quot;Bible Bob&quot; refers to Jehovah's Witnesses as &quot;children of God&quot;
yet earlier in the same post he calls them a &quot;cult.&quot;]

&quot;Of late I have been reading some of Carl's posts by some of his man gods.&quot;
[NOTE: &quot;man gods&quot;? &quot;Bible Bob&quot; false accuses me of worshipping man.]

---

June 30, 2007

&quot;You [Carl] make allegations, but are unable to provide the evidence to
support those allegations.&quot; [Actually I did and have provided specific proof
in the form of prior posts from &quot;Bible Bob&quot; and when confronted with them,
he either denied them or ignored them. So chalk this up as another lie of
&quot;Bible Bob&quot;'s.]

&quot;You [Carl] are a carnal follower of Christ.&quot; [A slanderous falsehood on
&quot;Bible Bob&quot;'s part and one that shows his lack of the fruit of the Spirit
within him.]

&quot;To date you [Carl] have not been able to find once false doctrine taught by
me [&quot;Bible Bob&quot;] that you can prove to be false.&quot; [Actually &quot;Bible Bob&quot; has
been proven to be teaching falsely on several items including, but not
limited to, the Trinity (which &quot;Bible Bob&quot; denies even though it is taught
in the Bible), the deity of Christ (which &quot;Bible Bob&quot; denies even though it
is taught in the Bible), the physical resurrection of Jesus Christ (which
&quot;Bible Bob&quot; denies even though it is taught in the Bible), the infinite
nature of Jesus Christ (which &quot;Bible Bob&quot; denies even though it is taught in
the Bible), and others. And I am not the only Christian who has proven
&quot;Bible Bob&quot; to be wrong and teaching falsely.]

&quot;You would be better off reading and following my teachings than the
teachings of the sects because mine are more accurate.&quot; [Ahhh...the &quot;Church
Of Bible Bob&quot; is, according to &quot;Bible Bob&quot; more accurate than denominations
that adhere to Biblical orthodoxy. No thanks. Heretics like &quot;Bible Bob&quot; tend
to exhibit such arrogant behavior.]

&quot;Jesus was crucified on a stake&quot; [This is an old WTBTS false teaching that
has been extensively refuted by Biblical evidence as well as archaeological,
historical and medical evidence yet here's &quot;Bible Bob&quot; proclaiming this
tired old heresy.]

&quot;Over half of your Baptist doctrines came from the Roman Catholic Church.&quot;
[An unfounded and historically false statement from &quot;Bible Bob.&quot;]

&quot;Everyone knows that Jesus Christ was not crucified on a cross and everyone
knows that church steeples are phallic symbles [sic] and that church bells
are used to wake up the gods from sleep.&quot; [&quot;Bible Bob&quot; comes up with the
most ridiculous heresies.]

&quot;Name the &quot;Christians&quot; that have found Bible Bob's teachings to be
unBiblical and then post one; just one, of those teachings that you say are
unBiblical.&quot; [&quot;Bible Bob&quot; made this demand while ignoring the numerous
Christian theologians I cited dating as far back at the early Church fathers
in the 1st century A.D. who taught the Trinity. He made this demand while
ignoring the numerous Christian theologians I cited dating as far back at
the early Church fathers in the 1st century A.D. who taught the deity of
Jesus Christ. He made this demand while ignoring the numerous theologians
who taught salvation by grace through faith and not by works. All three
doctrines denied by &quot;Bible Bob.&quot;]

June 26, 2007

&quot;Yes you [Carl] do worship men as you [sic] posts prove.&quot; [Here &quot;Bible Bob&quot;
accuses me of worshipping men rather than God. This is a lie on &quot;Bible
Bob&quot;'s part.]

---

June 13, 2007

&quot;I [&quot;Bible Bob&quot;] have lots of religious education.&quot; [Doubtful. To this day
&quot;Bible Bob&quot; has presented no verifiable documentation of such &quot;religious
education.&quot;]

---

June 28, 2007

&quot;Can you [Carl] name one Christian that Bible Bob has attacked&quot; [Myself for
one. But &quot;Bible Bob&quot; doesn't consider me a Christian since he arrogantly and
falsely labels me otherwise. However I don't have to prove myself to &quot;Bible
Bob&quot; and I know my faith is in Jesus Christ who is my Lord and Savior. I am
Christian and there's nothing &quot;Bible Bob&quot; nor anyone else can do about it.
However &quot;Bible Bob&quot; hates when he's proven wrong by Christians. Some other
better known Christians that &quot;Bible Bob&quot; has attacked: John Wesley - J.
Vernon McGee - David Jeremiah - Billy Graham - John MacArthur - Jerry
Falwell - Charles Spurgeon - C.S. Lewis - John MacArthur - Ray Stedman -
Charles Stanley - Arthur Pink - Adam Clarke - Falvius Josephus - John Owen -
R.C. Sproul - John Bunyan - Robert Jamieson - Charles Finney - Matthew
Henry - E.M. Bounds - George Whitefield - James Strong - Thomas Aquinas -
W.E. Vine - et al. Some lesser known Christians that &quot;Bible Bob&quot; has
attacked: Kevin Hall - Randy Ray - David Brooks - and millions upon millions
of Methodists and Baptists for &quot;Bible Bob&quot; has deemed them all nonChristians
and cultists. This is the arrogant hatred &quot;Bible Bob&quot; exhibits as well as
his dishonesty.]

&quot;Can you [Carl] provide evidence from the word of God that God has given you
authority to attack Christians who are members of the Jehovah's Witness
group that you do not know or who have not corresponded with you?&quot; [Please
note &quot;Bible Bob&quot; calls Methodists and Baptists cultists yet calls Jehovah's
Witnesses &quot;Christians.&quot; This shows the level of dishonesty and deceit from
&quot;Bible Bob&quot; that can only be considered satanic in nature. Furthermore I
have not attacked Jehovah's Witnesses. This is yet another proved &quot;Bible
Bob&quot; lie. What I have done is shown on several occasions the heresies, false
prophecies and false doctrines of the Watchtower Bible And Tract Society,
the Jehovah's Witnesses' parent organization. The WTBTS has deceived
countless people during their existence. I have shared information showing
the WTBTS' deceit.]

&quot;Carl, you are one who teaches salvation by works.&quot; [I have never taught
such a doctrine. &quot;Bible Bob&quot; lies.]

&quot;You [Carl] are an arrogant man worshipping hater of the chidlren [sic] of
God.&quot; [More &quot;Bible Bob&quot; lies. I do not nor ever have worshipped man and do
not hate children of God. However as shown from his own words, &quot;Bible Bob&quot;
routinely calls &quot;Christians&quot; cultists and nonChristians &quot;children of God.&quot;
This can only be taken as satanic deception on &quot;Bible Bob&quot;'s part.]

&quot;We are justified by the faith of Jesus Christ; not our faith.&quot; [Another
heresy from &quot;Bible Bob.&quot; He denies that we are saved by our faith in Jesus
Christ even though that's what the Bible, taken in totality, clearly
teaches. &quot;Bible Bob&quot; teaches that the faith OF Jesus Christ, whom &quot;Bible
Bob&quot; denies as being God and only a man CREATED by God, is what saves us.
That's not taught in the Bible but it is taught by the &quot;Church of Bible Bob&quot;
where heresies flourish. The Bible teaches that Jesus Christ was faithful
but &quot;Bible Bob&quot; twists it into something it's not.]

June 11, 2007

&quot;I do not respect your cowardly behavior of hiding behind the words of men
and elevating the words of men above the word of God.&quot; [I have never
elevated the words of men above the Word of God. This is a clear lie on
&quot;Bible Bob&quot;'s part and an attempt to slander me. What I have done is cite
various Christian theologians, ministers and other learned men of God in
refutation of &quot;Bible Bob&quot;'s heresies and in response, &quot;Bible Bob&quot; lies and
slanders. The Christian people I cited effectively and thoroughly refuted
&quot;Bible Bob&quot; time and time again using the Bible as the source. Therefore,
&quot;Bible Bob&quot; was refuted by the Word of God.]

&quot;You [Carl] are a fake and a fraud offering for Scripture the words and
doctrines of men.&quot; [I have never attempted to offer the words and doctrines
of men as a substitute for Holy Scripture. This is another slanderous lie by
&quot;Bible Bob&quot; that shows the lack of the fruit of the Holy Spirit in his
heart.]

&quot;I will not honor an honest attempt with sarcasm or criticism.&quot; [However
that's mostly what &quot;Bible Bob&quot; responds with: sarcasm and criticism. Another
&quot;Bible Bob&quot; lie.]

---

June 2, 2007

&quot;You [Carl] do NOT believe in the Trinity.&quot; [&quot;Bible Bob&quot; now tries to claim
I don't believe something even though I have publicly stated that I do and
even provided plenty of Biblical evidence. I even provided evidence as shown
by many Christian theologians.]

&quot;You [Carl] cannot prove from the rightly divided word of God that a Trinity
exists because you do NOT know how to search, understand, and expound the
Scriptures.&quot; [&quot;Bible Bob&quot; makes this patently false accusation after I did
prove from the rightly divided Word of God that the (not &quot;a&quot;) Trinity exists
and is taught in the Bible.]

&quot;I have simply asked you to provide proof of the Trinity in YOUR own words
from the Scriptures. You [Carl] have not been able to so [sic] so.&quot;
[Actually I have on several occasions and a simple Google search in Usenet
newsgroups proves that but &quot;Bible Bob&quot; takes his routine tact of denial.
&quot;Bible Bob&quot; was and is unable to refute the Biblical evidence as presented
by myself as well as dozens of other Christians so &quot;Bible Bob&quot; both denies
in a dishonest manner as well as twists scripture using his
pseudo-scholarship which also has been shown to be lacking. But although his
pseudo-scholarship is lacking and has been shown as such, &quot;Bible Bob&quot; keeps
denying that anyone has proven the Trinity to be Biblically sound doctrine
when the fact of the matter is that many people have. But the eyes, ears and
heart of the heretic (like &quot;Bible Bob&quot;) are closed to the truth of the
Scriptures.]

&quot;You [Carl] wouldn't make a good pimple on a disciples hindside.&quot; [&quot;Bible
Bob&quot; once again shows he is wont to throw out insults even though he claims
to be someone who knows Scripture better than anyone else. Interesting that
he regularly ignores what it teaches. This example of &quot;Bible Bob&quot;'s routine
usage of insults shows the lack of gentleness, kindness, peace,
self-control, etc. that God instructs Christians to exhibit. Insults are not
the fruit from a good tree. &quot;But you, man of God, flee from all this, and
pursue righteousness, godliness, faith, love, endurance and gentleness.&quot; (1
Timothy 6:11)]

&quot;Trinitarians edited the King James Version of the Bible.&quot; [Earlier in the
post this quote came from &quot;Bible Bob&quot; demands that I &quot;prove your statements&quot;
yet &quot;Bible Bob&quot; throws out this false statement as if it becomes true
because &quot;Bible Bob&quot; said so. He made this claim before and since always with
no substantiation even when pressed.]

&quot;Trinitarians have to believe [sic] the Trinity because it makes them
money.&quot; [Same post. Equally unfounded and ridiculous.]

&quot;Carl, get your head out of your butt&quot; [Same post. No gentleness as called
for by God.]

June 1, 2007

Recently &quot;Bible Bob&quot; wrote the following concerning the Biblical doctrine of
the Holy Trinity:

BB&gt; It is not mentioned in the Bible.  Trinitarians have added words

BB&gt; to the versions, mistranslated the versions, and twisted

BB&gt; passages from the versions but have not been able to document

BB&gt; a Trinity from the word of God.

[Please note &quot;Bible Bob&quot;'s accusations with no evidence.]

&quot;He [Carl] is far more loving and forgiving and tenderhearted than you are.
And he [Carl] doesn't present himself as impotent like you do. He [Carl]
does not present himself as an arrogant pride filled ignorant hate monger
like you do.&quot; [Interesting how &quot;Bible Bob&quot;'s opinion changes when one
exposes &quot;Bible Bob&quot;'s heresies. Admitedly the &quot;you&quot; in this missive is Steve
Winter so it's not hard to be more loving and forgiving than Steve Winter
but &quot;Bible Bob&quot; claims I have no love nor forgiveness within me. And now
&quot;Bible Bob&quot; claims I am arrogant and pride-filled. I haven't changed nor
have my posts. The only thing is that I have refuted &quot;Bible Bob&quot;'s heresies
and exposed &quot;Bible Bob&quot; as a heretic via his own words through proper
documentation as he challenged me to do. But even then &quot;Bible Bob&quot; was
showing his double-standards when in the same post he wrote the following:]

&quot;You are not a true preacher.  You are a false preacher, false teacher,

false pastor, a false manm, a false father, a false husband,  - do you

wear falsies in your bra?&quot; [Was the insult really necessary? Are insults an
example of the fruit of the Spirit? The answer to both questions is
obviously &quot;no.&quot; This shows what is lacking in &quot;Bible Bob&quot;'s heart.]

&quot;I'm not one of those drunks from the bar that you can lure out of the bar
and into the alley where you  can gut them for a few bucks for your crack
habit.&quot; [This one wasn't aimed at me but it deserved to be included to
illustrate the insulting, vitriolic and contemptible nature of &quot;Bible Bob.&quot;]

&quot;Over the years I have repeatedly proven you to be a mental eunuch in the
fields of science, history, philosophy, politics, religion, and common
sense.&quot; [Same post. More bile. And an incredible condescending arrogance.]

&quot;You are a mental midget in the arena of intellect and end up trodden under
my feet every time you enter the arena with me.&quot; [Same post. More grandiose
arrogance.]

&quot;You ought to be ashamed of yourself mommies boy.&quot; [Same post. Interesting
lack of maturity coming from someone who brags of having such an intellect.
His words like these lacking intellect contradict his claim of high
intellect.]

February 20, 2007

&quot;I posted it to the groups that Steve Winter's posts to cause I wanted to.&quot;

multiple-group postings with explanations like this one. &quot;Bible Bob&quot;'s
hypocrisy shows.]

May 13, 2006

&quot;I [&quot;Bible Bob&quot;] thought I [&quot;Bible Bob&quot;] was good at hyperbole&quot; [When &quot;Bible
Bob&quot; is caught in a lie, he tends to claim he was using &quot;hyperbole.&quot;]

February 6, 2006

&quot;I have never &quot;claimed&quot; to be a teacher.  I demonstrate what I am by my
words and by my deeds.  You can not find a post anywhere where I have
claimed to be anything.  I do not believe in using titles and you know that.
I have never claimed to be a teacher on a newsgroup.  I have and do teach;
but all believers are supposed to do that.&quot; [Actually, as I have found and
documented in this text file, &quot;Bible Bob&quot; has indeed claimed to be a
teacher.]

August 31, 2005

&quot;The only evidence of the trinity are the vain imaginations of men.&quot; [&quot;Bible
Bob&quot; ignores the Biblical evidence presented to him on numerous occasions.
To support his denials, he has to resort to very bad exegesis and
self-taught (as he freely admits) Greek which has been shown to be shoddy.
However when his errors are shown and corrected, &quot;Bible Bob&quot; resorts to ad
hominem attack and denials.]

&quot;You censored my comments by snipping the relevant context.  That is not
honest and leads one to believe that you have a controlling nature that
requires you to have your way regardless of whether you are right or wrong.&quot;
[This was not aimed at me but shows a huge amount of hypocrisy on &quot;Bible
Bob&quot;'s part because he has a long history of selectively editing others'
comments in his replies just as he is accusing another of doing. In fact, if
one does a Google search on Usenet of &quot;Bible Bob&quot;'s posts, one will discover
that &quot;Bible Bob&quot; has &quot;a controlling nature that requires [Bible Bob] to have
[his] way regardless of whether [he is] right or wrong.&quot; And when &quot;Bible
Bob&quot; is shown to be wrong, he gets extremely selective in his editing.]

&quot;First of all Paul was talking about the Jews who were peeping Toms; not
Christians.&quot; [This is &quot;Bible Bob&quot;'s response to Galatians 2:4. Peeping Toms?
I have never heard anyone other than &quot;Bible Bob&quot; claim that Galatians 2:4
(&quot;And that because of false brethren unawares brought in, who came in
privily to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus, that they
might bring us into bondage&quot;) refers to &quot;peeping Toms.&quot; Maybe &quot;Bible Bob&quot;
also believes the passage refers to sado-masochism because it refers to
&quot;bondage.&quot; Ridiculous. According to Strong's the Greek word used in the
passage &quot;kataskopeo&quot; (kat-as-kop-eh'-o) means to be a sentinel, i.e. to
inspect insidiously: and in the King James Bible is translated as &quot;to spy
out.&quot; {Source: New Exhaustive Strong's Numbers and Concordance with Expanded
Greek-Hebrew Dictionary}]

[An example of &quot;Bible Bob&quot;'s weak exegesis.]

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;This is NOT a Biblical assertion you
&gt;are making. The prrof [sic] DOES need to
&gt;be asserted.
&gt;1 Peter 3:15
&gt;but in your hearts regard Christ the
&gt;Lord as holy, always being prepared
&gt;to make a defense to anyone who asks
&gt;you for a reason for the hope that is
&gt;in you;
">

&quot;Aren't we having fun. Same word &quot;apologia;&quot; and if you read the verse it is
talking about an &quot;answer&quot; to someone who asks a question. And the question
is about the hope that is in you; not whether the word of God is truth.&quot;
[Webster's Dictionary defines &quot;apologia&quot; {from when we get the word
&quot;apologetics&quot;} as &quot;a defense especially of one's opinions, position, or
actions&quot; -- Strong's Greek Dictionary defines it as an &quot;answer (for self)&quot;
The person was trying to point out to &quot;Bible Bob&quot; that apologetics includes
defending the truth of the Scriptures while &quot;Bible Bob&quot; took an opposing
view. The defenses of Christianity by the primitive fathers are called
apologies {Adam Clarke's Commentary on 1 Peter 3:15} and their defenses of
the Christian religion were examples of early Christian apologetics (see
Acts 22:1) therefore &quot;Bible Bob&quot; is offbase on this point in claiming that 1
Peter 3:15 is limited in scope as he asserts.]

&quot;Are you saying that God should not be condoned because He is Polytheist?
Are you saying that Jesus Christ should not be condoned because he is
polytheist?&quot; [&quot;Bible Bob&quot; claiming God is polytheistic? &quot;Bible Bob&quot; claiming
Jesus is polytheistic? For those who don't know polytheism is the belief in
or worship of more than one god. In this statement &quot;Bible Bob&quot; is claiming
Jehovah God and Jesus Christ both believe in, or maintain a plurality of
gods. This is so patently absurd and unBiblical as to completely make &quot;Bible
Bob&quot;'s positions to be highly suspect to any rational, reasonable
Christian.]

&quot;The trinity is anti-Christian and pro-Satan. Well, isn't it? God says there
is only One True God and Satan says there are other One True God's.&quot; [&quot;Bible
Bob&quot; implies that Trinitarians believe that there are other gods when the
fact shows such an implication to be false. But &quot;Bible Bob&quot; routinely
intentionally misrepresents the beliefs of those who oppose his beliefs in
order to try to bolster his reputation and position. Unfortunately for
&quot;Bible Bob&quot; such intentional misrepresentations only prove a dishonest
nature on &quot;Bible Bob&quot;'s part.]

&quot;You can not prove the trinity from the Word of God (or Bible if correctly
translated and read in context).  Talk to your theologians, they will tell
you that I am right and you are wrong.&quot; [Same post. Many people have proven
the Trinity from the Word of God (correctly translated, taken in context AND
using the Bible in totality). Furthermore, thousands upon thousands of
Christian theologians over the centuries starting with the early Christian
church fathers who taught the Trinity and referenced the Trinity in their
writings as far back as the middle of the 1st century A.D. So the
overwhelming majority of Christian theologians {and the Bible} say &quot;Bible
Bob&quot; is wrong and the Trinity (and therefore Trinitarians) are right. But
&quot;Bible Bob&quot; will simply deny this {and has denied this} when the fact is
pointed out to him.]
