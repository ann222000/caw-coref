REVIEW &amp; OUTLOOK
Wall Street Journal
November 13, 2007; Page A24

If you've been listening to Mike Huckabee or John Edwards on the
Presidential trail, you may have heard that the U.S. is becoming a
nation of rising inequality and shrinking opportunity. We'd refer
those campaigns to a new study of income mobility by the Treasury
Department that exposes those claims as so much populist hokum.

OK, &quot;hokum&quot; is our word. The study, to be released today, is a
careful, detailed piece of research by professional economists that
avoids political judgments. But what it does do is show beyond doubt
that the U.S. remains a dynamic society marked by rapid and mostly
upward income mobility. Much as they always have, Americans on the
bottom rungs of the economic ladder continue to climb into the middle
and sometimes upper classes in remarkably short periods of time.

The Treasury study examined a huge sample of 96,700 income tax returns
from 1996 and 2005 for Americans over the age of 25. The study tracks
what happened to these tax filers over this 10-year period. One of the
notable, and reassuring, findings is that nearly 58% of filers who
were in the poorest income group in 1996 had moved into a higher
income category by 2005. Nearly 25% jumped into the middle or upper-
middle income groups, and 5.3% made it all the way to the highest
quintile.

Of those in the second lowest income quintile, nearly 50% moved into
the middle quintile or higher, and only 17% moved down. This is a
stunning show of upward mobility, meaning that more than half of all
lower-income Americans in 1996 had moved up the income scale in only
10 years.

Also encouraging is the fact that the after-inflation median income of
all tax filers increased by an impressive 24% over the same period.
Two of every three workers had a real income gain -- which contradicts
the Huckabee-Edwards-Lou Dobbs spin about stagnant incomes. This is
even more impressive when you consider that &quot;median&quot; income and wage
numbers are often skewed downward because the U.S. has had a huge
influx of young workers and immigrants in the last 20 years. They
start their work years with low wages, dragging down the averages.

Those who start at the bottom but hold full-time jobs nonetheless
enjoyed steady income gains. The Treasury study found that those tax
filers who were in the poorest income quintile in 1996 saw a near
doubling of their incomes (90.5%) over the subsequent decade. Those in
the highest quintile, on the other hand, saw only modest income gains
(10%). The nearby table tells the story, which is that the poorer an
individual or household was in 1996 the greater the percentage income
gain after 10 years.

Only one income group experienced an absolute decline in real income
-- the richest 1% in 1996. Those households lost 25.8% of their
income. Moreover, more than half (57.4%) of the richest 1% in 1996 had
dropped to a lower income group by 2005. Some of these people might
have been &quot;rich&quot; merely for one year, or perhaps for several, as they
hit their peak earning years or had some capital gains windfall.
Others may simply have not been able to keep up with new entrepreneurs
and wealth creators.

The key point is that the study shows that income mobility in the U.S.
works down as well as up -- another sign that opportunity and merit
continue to drive American success, not accidents of birth. The &quot;rich&quot;
are not the same people over time.

The study is also valuable because it shows that income mobility
remains little changed from what similar studies found in the 1970s
and 1980s. Some journalists and academics have cited selective
evidence to claim that income mobility has declined in recent years.

But the 58% of lowest-income earners who moved to a higher income
quintile in this study is roughly comparable to the percentages that
did so in several similar studies going back to the late 1960s. &quot;The
basic finding of this analysis,&quot; says the Treasury report, &quot;is that
relative income mobility is approximately the same in the last 10
years as it was in the previous decade.&quot;

All of this certainly helps to illuminate the current election-year
debate about income &quot;inequality&quot; in the U.S. The political left and
its media echoes are promoting the inequality story as a way to
justify a huge tax increase. But inequality is only a problem if it
reflects stagnant opportunity and a society stratified by more or less
permanent income differences. That kind of society can breed class
resentments and unrest. America isn't remotely such a society, thanks
in large part to the incentives that exist for risk-taking and wealth
creation.

The great irony is that, in the name of reducing inequality, some of
our politicians want to raise taxes and other government obstacles to
the kind of risk-taking and hard work that allow Americans to climb
the income ladder so rapidly. As the Treasury data show, we shouldn't
worry about inequality. We should worry about the people who use
inequality as a political club to promote policies that reduce
opportunity.

That is the trouble with being on top, or at the top of the game,
there is only one way to go.  What might be just as alarming is the
extent to whaich some of the CAO's are manipulating the capitalist
system to suit themselves. How many of these people seem to have the
ability to pay themselves a performance bonus even when the company
they work for is going under, and is leaving the employees out of
work, and their pension funds plundered.  There needs to be some
editing, as it  is now both the shareholders and the rank and
file.employees that are being robbed.  :It is important whne lookin at
tax information to consider the effect of what could be called bracket
creep, as a result of inflation.  As wages , and therefore taxable
incomes rise, the tax bracket may change, although the relative
wellbeing of the taxpayer has in fact fallen.  This is also a means by
which the government can collect more taxes,  yet claim that they have
maintained a tax freeze or even a reduction.
