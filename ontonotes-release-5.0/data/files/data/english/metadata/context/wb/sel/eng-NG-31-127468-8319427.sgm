http://anthrozine.com -- the zine proper
http://astore.amazon.com/anthrozine-20 -- The new ANTHRO Mall!
http://www.lulu.com/cubist -- ANTHRO Press: We got books!
http://www.zazzle.com/cubist* -- Graphic Descriptions: We got posters
and t-shirts, too!

This is Quentin 'Cubist' Long. Someday I'm going to have to master
this 'time management' deal... but that day is not now. For today is
the day that ANTHRO #12 was unveiled to a patiently-awaiting world!
And what do we have for the winners, Johnny?

Item: The ANTHRO Mall. Amazon.com carries a vast selection, over
and above the books it built its fame on. Many of these items are of
interest to the furry community, or at least they *would* be if you
could *find* the damn things... Enter: the ANTHRO Mall. I've gone
trawling for 'furry' in Amazon.com's ginormous 'sea', and what I
caught, I've put in the Mall for you to see, marvel at, and (if it
appeals to you) maybe even buy. And since Amazon's inventory ain't
exactly static, I will update the Mall from time to time, removing
items that aren't available any more and adding new stuff!

Item: Music. You recall that BROTHERS UNDER THE SKIN song by Tom
Smith, the tune that's only available to ANTHRO subscribers? Well, it
now has a whole page unto itself [ http://anthrozine.com/site/music.html
]! Now you can feast your eyes on the label of the mini-CD, as well as
tap your toes to the first verse of BROTHERS UNDER THE SKIN. Check it
out!

Item: This issue's interior art -- or, more accurately, the *lack*
thereof. I know, I know, you're probably thinking this is part of some
deep and devious scheme to gin up a little &quot;what's gonna be there
TOMORROW!?&quot; excitement for a site that normally updates once every two
months. Alas, the truth is a bit more embarrassing than that. What
happened was, it was getting *real* late, and I finally decided not to
bother about the missing art at all. Which is not to say that this
issue's stories are going to *stay* artless, mind you! I fully intend
to get them all decently illustrated as soon as I can manage it. So
regardless of the actual reasons, I guess I *am* going for that
&quot;what's gonna be there TOMORROW!?&quot; excitement. Go figure...

Item: The YARF! Reviews, aka &quot;the latest wing of ANTHRO's Library&quot;.
This puppy not includes all the reviews Fred Patten wrote for every
issue of YARF! up to #50! Since YARF!'s final issue was #69, does that
mean the next issue of ANTHRO will, as part of its updating, actually
*complete* the set? Could be... could be...

Item: Those of you who like ANTHRO's graphics can purchase some of
it for yourselves! I refer, here, to Graphic Descriptions, the online
storefront that peddles ANTHRO art in a variety of useful and
attractive forms. Feel free to check out the selection at
[ href=&quot; http://www.zazzle.com/Cubist* ]... and if you see something
you like, buy it! Remember, 75% of the profits from all sales will go
to the artist who created the image in question, and the rest will go
to ANTHRO.
Of course, you can also check out our list of recommended furry
books, more than 300 strong [ http://anthrozine.com/site/support.books.1.html
], or even donate or subscribe [ http://anthrozine.com/site/support.html
]. A subscription is only 50 cents (US money) per bimonthly issue, or
USD $3 a year, or the cost of a decent hamburger. Any money that comes
to ANTHRO will go to pay our writers and artists for their excellent
work; this, in turn, will encourage them all to keep on doing what
they do so well. Sounds like a &quot;win-win situation to *me*! If it
sounds like that to you, too, please consider supporting ANTHRO. Or if
you just can't spare the cash, just spread the word, and URL, to
anyone you know and think might find it interesting or enjoyable!
