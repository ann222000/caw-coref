1. NEW BIOMECHATRONICS CONFERENCE LAUNCHES IN ITALY
The first IEEE International Conference on Biomedical Robotics and
Biomechatronics aims to provide a forum for the study of biomedical
engineering and its impact on scientific technologies. The conference,
which will convene from 20 to 22 February in Pisa, Italy, will examine the
design and manufacture of high-performance bio-inspired machines and
systems, as well as the evolution of devices that can assist human beings
in need of medical assistance. Sessions will include discussions on
bionics, biomechatronic robot design, exoskeletons and augmenting devices.
The conference is sponsored by the IEEE Robotics and Automation and IEEE
Engineering in Medicine and Biology Societies. For more information, or to
register to attend, visit:

wearable robotic systems in the U.S., Europe, and Asia:

2. PROCEEDINGS OF THE IEEE LOOKS AT BLUE SKY ELECTRONICS
The October issue of Proceedings of the IEEE (v. 93, no. 10) centers around
the revolutionary impact of &quot;blue sky&quot; electronic devices on today's highly
evolving technologies. Papers in this issue examine the dimensions of blue
sky electronics, which allows for them to process large amounts of
information at rapid speeds, and discuss certain blue sky technologies that
have met increased dissemination in the marketplace, such as white light
bulbs, integrated electronic/biological devices and next-generation
technologies like q-dot photonic bandgap lasers and phasmonic devices.

3. DNA NANOTECHNOLOGY MAY DRASTICALLY REDUCE ELECTRONICS SIZE
DNA nanotechnology, in which metal ions are bound in the formation of
peptide nucleic acid (PNA) duplexes, has led to the construction of
three-dimensional nano-structures that can acquire magnetic and electrical
properties, according to researchers at Carnegie Mellon University. The
technology can lead to functional, three-dimensional nanosize structures
such as molecular-scale electronic circuits, researchers say, which could
reduce by thousands of times the size of common electronic devices.
Artificially manufactured PNAs are significantly more stable than DNA, and
should permit researchers to construct large structures useful for material
science applications. Read More:

4. RESEARCHERS ASSERT BELIEFS ON CREATING OPTICAL CIRCUIT PARTS
To go past the limits of conventional technology, engineers at the
University of Pennsylvania have devised a theoretical system for shrinking
electronics so devices could operate using light instead of electricity. In
a recent issue of Physical Review Letters, the theorists target familiar
optical circuit elements and show how they could be generated on the
nanoscale and be powered by infrared or visible light. As an example, they
explain how nanoscale particles of specific elements could operate as
circuit elements. Read more:

5. KEYNOTE SPEAKERS TO VISIT NANOELECTRONICS CONFERENCE IN CHINA
The 2006 IEEE Conference on Emerging Technologies- Nanoelectronics will
feature lectures by Prof. Mark S. Lundstrom from the School of Electrical
and Computer Engineering, Purdue University, and other well-known experts.
The conference, scheduled to take place 10 to 13 January in Singapore,
endeavors to draw world-wide nanoelectronics experts, educators, and
students into a single forum. The conference will examine design,
fabrication, metrology and commercialization aspects of the nanoelectronics
industry. To learn more, or to register to attend, visit:

7. COMMERCIALIZATION EYED FOR ROOM-TEMPERATURE TRANSISTOR LASER
In the September issue of the journal Applied Physics Letters, researchers
at the University of Illinois show that a heterojunction bipolar transistor
laser is capable of room-temperature operation, which posits the laser for
commercialization in the near future. The researchers said improving the
design could produce a higher speed laser operation, better performance and
a way to yield electronic-photonic integrated circuits. The significance of
room-temperature transistor lasers is the ability to generate faster signal
processing and pave the way for communications without barriers, according
to researcher Milton Feng. Read more:

8. PROCEEDINGS OF SOLID-STATE CIRCUITS CONFERENCE RELEASED
The proceedings of the 2005 IEEE International Symposium on Solid-State
Circuits (ISSSC), one of the leading forums for the presentation of
advances in solid-state circuits and systems-on-a-chip, are now available.
The event was themed &quot;Entering the Nano-Electronic Integrated-Circuit Era&quot;
and highlighted papers covering new circuit techniques and devices that
employ transistors, or other circuit elements, with nanometer dimensions.

9. RESEARCHERS TRANSFORM MATTER WITH &quot;QUANTUM DOTS&quot;
Physicists at the University of Pennsylvania say they have developed an
artificial solid that can be transformed from an insulator to a
semiconductor. The artificial solids researchers used in the experiments
are formed from closely packed nanoscale crystals, also called &quot;quantum
dots.&quot; By controlling the coupling of artificial atoms within the crystal,
researchers say they increased the electrical conductivity of the entire
crystal. The system may enable the creation of artificial solids that can
be switched through a variety of electronic phase transitions, according to
researchers, a key step towards the fabrication of functional
nanocrystal-based devices and circuits. Read more:
