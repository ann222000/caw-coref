I thought, I'll add a picture to my blog header.

I thought, I'll upload some mp3 files to go with the list of music that makes me grin which I posted while guesting on Boob Pencil here.

And then life began to resemble that song "There's a hole in my bucket".

Clearly step one is to convert the .wma or .m4a files I get when I rip tracks from CDs into mp3 files. Ah - this requires additional software. So I Google for free downloads of what I imagine would be a pretty basic utility kind of program. What part of "free" do these people not understand? So far, every "free" download has turned out only to convert part of each file until you pay $$$. Screw that. I shall ask around my musical friends who will undoubtedly have a converter I can copy. Free.

OK. Before I can upload mp3 files, or indeed before I can include images in my blog, I need a webspace. (Before you ask, the nice piccy in my profile is currently sitting on Clare's space - thank you Clare!). So I create a webspace, noting that my normal email userid isn't allowed because it contains an underscore. OK. Webspace created under new alias. Then I need to create pages on it. This seems to require either Microsoft Frontpage at about Â£150 a throw or a downloaded FTP client. And none of those seem to be free. I ended up getting a copy of cute_ftp (free for 30 days) which seems to have created something. And it's allowed me to upload my picture to an FTP server. But nowhere does it tell me simply at what address my picture is now located so I can quote it for inclusion on the blog. So that's a lot of help then. I now have to read many many many pages of online help for the webspace and many many many pages of online help for the FTP program before I have the vaguest clue what I'm supposed to be doing. It ain't gonna happen this week, that's for sure.

See, this is why I didn't want to get involved in blogging. Oh, they said, it's all easy with Blogger, they said. And so it is. But if you want to do even simple things, you end up submerging in a sea of not-quite-free software and html manuals (on order). I could come to hate this.

So, for now, you'll have to imagine the first four bars of Eine Kleine Nachtmusik (first violin part) as a graphic somewhere up there. And the music? Well, you'll have to hum.

In between all this I've been dodging in and out to watch the Edinburgh Live8 concert, which so far appears to have been wall-to-wall sh*te. Well, Youssou N'Dour and Neneh Cherry were OK, though "Seven Seconds" managed to feel like seven hours by the time they eventually finished it. Oh - Travis have just come on, and sound great by comparison with most of what I've heard so far.

Grump mump curmudgeonly mump. Bloody computers.

UPDATE: Graphic now sorted, as you will see if you look at the top of the page. Website managed, kind of, courtesy of Blueyonder's "Sitebuilder". More dragging of my head into the 21st century to follow. Thanks to Clare and Joe for advice and software, all of which will probably be used as I begin to mess around with this new toy.

Awh, don't be grumpy! Hee. Am glad its not just me that gets cranky at some of the blogger quirks and the difficulties of obtaining free stuff on the net to enable you to do stuff.

I am sitting hear mentally listening to EKN, humming furiously. Will that do?

Smile!

I've got an old FTP program I can copy for you, with instructions. Email me and I can pass it on, along with instructions.

Joe - can't find an email address on your profile. There's one on mine you can send to if you don't want to publicise yours.

Thanks.

Rob

I have some free ftp software. Let me find the web address to download from... OK, my software is called FTP Explorer, and it's from www.ftpx.com. I think it was free. If it wasn't, it was very cheap. But I'm sure it was free.

And what's this about creating pages? I've never had to create pages. Maybe that's cos it was already done for me on my webspace. I dunno.

Now, if you have uploaded something using FTP, I think I might be able to deduce the url for the uploaded stuff based on my own ftp set-up. Maybe. I tell you what, I'll tell you how mine works and you see if you can convert it into your set-up.

OK, here we go. My ftp host address is ftp.purpleocity.net. My user name is claresudbery@purpleocity.net. The url of all stuff I upload is www.claresudbery.purpleocity.net/[filename]. So the url is www.[first part of username].[ftp host address minus the "ftp" bit]

What do you reckon? Does that look familiar? Can you convert that into how your system works?

I honestly don't think you have to create pages on your ftp server (but I am generalising our from my own specific experience, which is hardly scientific). But you may want to create directories to store your bits and bobs in. FTP Explorer will allow you to do that.

Let me know how you go!

P.S. You know the way you linked to Boob Pencil and then told people to scroll down and find a post called 'blblblbl'? No need to do that.

In Blogger, at the bottom of each post you'll find the time of the post. If you right-click on the time and choose 'Properties' you'll find it is in fact a link to that post, so you can grab the url and use it as a way of linking to a specific post. That way you can link from your post to someone else's post (or indeed one of your own) and the link will always be valid; will always take readers to that specific post, rather than just linking to the blog containing it.
