Greece - the Most Admired Land on Earth
Saturday, 29 September 2007

Greece is widely regarded as the place where the western civilization
was born many centuries ago. It is widely acknowledged as the guiding
force that has driven the human civilization for over 2500 years now.
It is also the place where three continents, namely Europe, Asia and
Africa, and three varying climatic conditions submerge into one. These
enthralling shades make it one of the most visited places on earth
today. Roughly 16 million tourists walk on its soil every year, thus
allowing several hundred thousand Greek nationals to be employed by
its tourism industry. Located at the southeastern fringe of the
European peninsula, Greece is spoken of highly for its world class
beaches, lavish hotels and the level of hospitality it offers. Hotels
in Greece are an integral part of its tourism infrastructure, which
earns around 15% of the nation's entire GDP in revenues.

Rich visuals may be recalled; if one began examining how the events
of Greece had benefited the world we are part of. It was Greece that
first gave the idea of democratic governance almost 2500 years ago.
The word &quot;democracy&quot; itself stemmed out from the Greek language,
meaning the rule of the people. In spite of its initial doubts, the
Greek democracy survived on and was later followed by many other
states. Modern states are often seen mimicking the same federal
structure that Romans established around 2000 years ago. However, it
should be noted down for academic reasons that Romans were more of an
autocratic regime, as their later years suggest. Only parts in and
around Athens had democratically elected councils to look after their
people.

Greece also gets known for having gifted the world with Modern
Olympic Games. It was Athens in 1896, where the first Olympic Games
were organized after its modern-day revival. Olympic Games have since
become a rallying point for the players and athletes from all over the
world to compete and people from varying backgrounds to mingle with
each other. Remains of the ancient Olympia stadium were excavated and
restored in the middle of the 20th century. It is the same location
from where the Olympic Flame starts its journey and gets carried to
the game venues. These and many other exciting stories may suggest why
Greece has been admired for ages now.

The world loves visiting Greece in huge numbers as a result,
providing an immense boost to its tourism infrastructure. Its scenic
Mediterranean coastline and the yearlong pleasing weather make holiday
making fun and frolic. Athens, Peloponnese, Cyclades and Crete are
some known cities carrying immense historic significance, where most
travelers prefer heading on to. Hotels in Greece would be seen having
high occupancy rates throughout the year, in this process, and one
should plan their journeys in advance, for the same reason, to make
their trips hassle free. Travelers can buy both cheap and high end
accommodation from hotels in Greece, and also try to get best deals
from tour operators, which include last minute holidays.

There is enough online support available for those who might be
willing to book their accommodation from hotels in Greece. Sea-side
resorts and self-catering apartments should also be taken into
consideration apart from prime hotels in Greece for garnering
accommodation. Planning out in advance should make your Greek journey
memorable, since there were plenty of activities to be entertained
from apart from visiting the usual heritage sites.
