and more Death!

Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows delivers on what the series has
been threatening to do since Goblet of Fire and makes the leap to
young adult fiction.  This is no tale for third and fourth graders.
The Dobby scene alone...for the love of Merlin's left testicle was
that really necessary?  Slaughtering Harry's pet owl while she was
trapped in her cage didn't fulfill the death of innocent creatures
clause?

And from what dark cavernous mind, from what warped accursed keyboard
emerges a world wherein Draco Malfoy lives and Fred Weasley dies?
Sick.  The deaths are so rapid, no numerous they become gratuitous.
To paraphrase another teenaged hero in a supernatural world, &quot;We get
it already. Voldemort is evil.&quot;  Some characters, ancilliary
characters like Scrimgeour, seemed to have been invented simply for
the purpose of being whacked.  Methinks Rowling got tired of her too
big world and just started expediting the plot with slaughter.

She has the nerve to call Harry The Master of Death?  Over identify
with your character much, Jo?

To give her credit the ending managed to wrap up a few loose ends
pretty neatly, if not satisfactorily.  I enjoyed seeing Dumbledore's
dark side, I'll stop calling him Dimblewit now.  Snape was pretty well
vindicated, although I'm not sure I think he should have been.  He is,
after all, still the person who set Voldemort on his path o' death to
Potterville.  He is, after all, still the petty, ill-tempered teacher
who in a snit refused to teach Harry a skill he needed to keep himself
and his friends safe.  He is indirectly responsible for the death of
Sirius Black.  Let's just say Harry naming his son after Severus Snape-
orkian is a bit of a stretch.

I too have lingering unanswered questions:

If Harry's magical cloak was so rare, the real thing so to speak, how
could Mad Eye Moody see through it?  Why doesn't it fool dementors?

The Creevy brothers, more ancillary characters doomed to die young,
were Muggle born.  What were they doing at Hogwarts after the Death
Eaters took over?

The Patil twins, last we saw, were being escorted from the school no
longer deemed to be safe when Dumbledore was murdered.  Seeing Snape
in charge made their parents reassured their children would come to no
harm?

Dear Mum and Dad,

Having a blast in school.  Learning how to torture people in D.A.D.A.
Can't wait to try it out on friends and family at home.

Love,

Parvati

Who was the character who learned to do magic late in life?

What were the Potters jobs before they died?

Why was Lily's gift at Charms an issue?

And the ending, the much anticipated ending, wherein Snape finds a way
to save Harry.  Or Ginny finds a way to save Harry.  Or Neville finds
a way to save Harry.  Or, you know, Harry finds a way to save Harry,
ends with a lame Voldemort never learns moral.  Uh, Voldy, what part
of &quot;You can't kill Harry&quot; don't you understand?  Hello?  Knock, knock,
anyone at home in that reptilian brain?  (btw flying Voldemort will be
a cinematic wonder.  I imagine Rowling had that in mind.  Imagine
flying Thingy in 3D)  Yes, replayed for all of Hogwarts to see, Harry
and Voldemort face off once more, mano a freak of magical nature in,
&quot;Voldemort destroys self trying to kill Harry, Part 2.&quot;

I thought better of you Rowling.  I really did.  But worst of all, you
committed the gravest of all authorial errors.  You killed off the
comic relief.   You split the sunshine.  You halved the hilarity. You
destroyed the greatest wizarding comedy team in the history of
Hogwarts.  For that, I will never forgive you.

For you Fred, your evil grin stretches on in my imaginary eternity.  I
will never forget you, or the Canary Cremes, or the Spider Teddy, or
Puking Pastilles, or the Vanishing Cabinet, or Percy's pinhead prefect
badge.  You were clever and brave and good at making money, but best
of all Fred, you were funny.

That's kind of the point: in war, death is omnipresent, and it is often
random.  Examine Sirius's death—it should have been heroic, but instead he
just fell through a piece of fabric.  &quot;A cannonball don't pay no mind&quot;, and
Sirius was unlucky in that particular situation.  While some of the death
was, IMO, gratuitous—cases in point being Lupin and Tonks—I think most of it
just reinforces the basic moral that violence is bad.

I might point out that Fred was pretty well marked for the cut since

It's called being a writer.  Characters are invented for purposes.

And Sirius Black was indirectly responsible for Snape's joining the DEs.
The chain of causality goes back forever; the point is, someone has to
stop it.  Hence the scene at the station where the more aware parents
are trying to prevent the old enmities from surfacing again.

(I'm rather disappointed in young James, but then, neither Harry nor
Ginny had much experience of modern parenting.)

And of fallible people who learn better.  One by one the moral exemplars
are shown to have been creepy teenagers who learned better but who still
have to deal with the results of what they did when they were young jerks.
The wonder is that any of them survived their first year out of Hogwarts
when their old enemies were of age and free of official restrictions.

If they really think carefully (and Hermione no doubt took notes and
kept her old school notes somewhere), they may even notice that Snape's
taught them much of what they needed to know, including Harry's
&quot;signature&quot; spell, Expelliarmus.

Well, Colin was totally obsessed with loyalty to Harry, and he probably
was on the run anyway.  I'd forgotten about the heavy crackdown on
muggleborns.  Colin would have been one year younger than Harry, so
he would have been 16 and had already had his OWLs and been expecting
to start his NEWT training when the takeover happened.  I'm not too
surprised that Colin managed to get in.  He got into the village to
join the DA after all.  Dennis was a year or so younger but very
adventurous; he would have been on the run too, if not already captured.
The woods and caves must have been full of runaway muggleborn children.

You're probably right.
At a quick scan I can't find where it says anything like that, but the
scenes with Umbridge interrogating muggleborn adults would certainly
imply support for your belief.  I also can't recall whether any of the
students named as being at Hogwarts this time were muggleborns.

Well, the Fantastic Beasts book mentions that it has to be updated
every year, and it doesn't have all the information we learn from the
early books in the series.  No doubt the Quidditch book is out of date
too.  Flying without the aid of an object seems to be a new spell, and
not one that Voldemort spread around.  I'm surprised that Snape got to
learn it - I wonder whether Snape actually invented it.

Hmm, a method of flying that Harry didn't learn in the course of the
book.  Harry's new flying method involves riding a dragon, though not
commanding it (darn!).

I'm just annoyed that Snape's potions textbook was destroyed in the fire.
I hope Harry and Hermione manage to remember all the improvements he made
and submit them for publication.  It would be a shame to lose them.

I hope so too!  How different the story would have been if Snape took
his knowledge of potions and wrote a new text book.  He would have

When JKR made every reference to something a twin had done in the past
to hurt Ron, done by Fred.  Fred gave him the acid pop that burned through
his tongue. Fred changed the teddy into a huge spider and gave Ron a
lifelong phobia.  Fred killed Ron's pet puffskein - a soft, totally
harmless small animal - by deliberately hitting it with a quidditch bat
to practice hitting bludgers for quidditch.  It was Fred we saw using
mind-screwup methods on his own mother at the railway station.  It was
Fred who tried to get Ron to make an Unbreakable Vow.  Always Fred being
nasty.  Sometimes George was in on it, as with the testing of potions
on uninformed first-years, but always Fred.

When I was doing up rap sheets for various students, Fred's was much
worse than the others.  I figured it was JKR setting him up for a fall
by making him unlikeable.

&gt; And the ending, the much anticipated ending, wherein Snape finds a way

&gt; a way to save Harry.  Or, you know, Harry finds a way to save Harry,

&gt; &quot;Voldemort destroys self trying to kill Harry, Part 2.&quot;

&gt; I thought better of you Rowling.  I really did.  But worst of all, you

&gt; &gt;&gt; I might point out that Fred was pretty well marked for the cut since
&gt; &gt;&gt; book three, and the early signs are there in book one if you search
&gt; &gt;&gt; for them.

&gt; &gt;What?   Please explain what you mean by this.   Where/when was Fred's
&gt; &gt;death foreshadowed?

&gt; When JKR made every reference to something a twin had done in the past
&gt; to hurt Ron, done by Fred.  Fred gave him the acid pop that burned through
&gt; his tongue. Fred changed the teddy into a huge spider and gave Ron a
&gt; lifelong phobia.  Fred killed Ron's pet puffskein - a soft, totally
&gt; harmless small animal - by deliberately hitting it with a quidditch bat
&gt; to practice hitting bludgers for quidditch.  It was Fred we saw using
&gt; mind-screwup methods on his own mother at the railway station.  It was
&gt; Fred who tried to get Ron to make an Unbreakable Vow.  Always Fred being
&gt; nasty.  Sometimes George was in on it, as with the testing of potions
&gt; on uninformed first-years, but always Fred.

&gt; When I was doing up rap sheets for various students, Fred's was much
&gt; worse than the others.  I figured it was JKR setting him up for a fall
&gt; by making him unlikeable.
">

Okay, I am emerging from my grievous cloud of mourning to
say....Waaaa!  Haaa!  Haaaa!  *Sniff*...Pardon me, I've been quite
beside myself.  Yes, I agree that Fred was  (I wrote *was* and I am
NOT going to cry over it) rather ev..ev..evil, sometimes.  But, he was
also loyal and brave, always willing to come through when Harry really
needed him and a staunch defender of his family's honor.  I don't
think any of the things he did warranted his untimely and horribly
depressing death.  His good points by far outweighed the bad.  Let's
face it Ron is something of a git himself.  Even Luna Lovegood, who
doesn't always seem to have a firm basis in reality, has noticed that
he can be quite unkind.  Percy certainly (very much to my
dissapointment) turned out to be a moron who couldn't extricate
himself from the horrible mess he'd made until it was almost too
late.

To my point, being an imperfect person doesn't make a character
unlikeable.  It makes them human.  Fred livened up every grim moment.
He helped make Hogwarts fun.  He gave the students hope in the face of
Umbridges awful oppression.  He invented things that actually helped
Harry defeat Voldemort.  (For those who criticize Fred and George for
selling Instant Darkness powder to Malfoy, I say I strongly doubt that
Draco Malfoy had the testicles to walk into W.W.W. and buy anything.
It was probably sold by owl order.  Instant Darkness doesn't create
instant darkness, wizards do.)

I loved him.  No really, I loved him.  Seriously, I've been feeling a
little down.  I hate Rowling for making me love Fred and then killing
him.  I think I'll send her a package of Nosebleed Nougats.

:&gt;&gt;&gt;Eaters took over?
:&gt;&gt;
:&gt;&gt;I only saw Colin's body mentioned.  Where was Dennis mentioned?
:&gt;
:&gt;He wasn't... but if they were muggle born even Colin shouldn't have
:&gt;been there to be killed. How did he get to Hogwarts to fight and die??
:
: Well, Colin was totally obsessed with loyalty to Harry, and he probably
: was on the run anyway.  I'd forgotten about the heavy crackdown on
: muggleborns.  Colin would have been one year younger than Harry, so
: he would have been 16 and had already had his OWLs and been expecting

: The woods and caves must have been full of runaway muggleborn children.

Rowling indicated in a recent chat that Colin arrived at Hogwarts
with the exiled/adult DA members...he was not one of the students
already there.

:&gt;&gt;&gt;The Patil twins, last we saw, were being escorted from the school no

:&gt;&gt;Compulsory attendance, at least for half- and pure-bloods, and probably
:&gt;&gt;for muggle-borns solely to keep them where they could be grabbed easily,

Luna was a pureblood!

That quote comes from one of the OWL examiners, who was referring to things
Dumbledore did in his fifth year of school, or possibly his seventh (if the
same examiner presided over the NEWTs as well).  Either way, it's certain
that he didn't have the Elder Wand at that point.

Rowling has said that James likely sneaked the map from his father's
desk,and as the &quot;heir&quot; I suppose he got his namesake grandfather's cloak.

(In my mindfic where Harry's murdered for the wand,
his daughter gets the Stone out of the forest so
the killer can't trace it there and take it too).
