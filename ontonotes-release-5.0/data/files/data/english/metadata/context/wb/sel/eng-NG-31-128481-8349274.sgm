Welcome Chavez!
Hassan Haydar Al Hayat - 19/08/07//

Venezuelan friend Hugo Chavez has recently joined our circle. He
became one of the revolutionary republican leaders of our third world
(or less) who rise to power in the name of democracy and defense of
the underprivileged, the deprived, the working class and the anti-
tyrants. Soon thereafter, they turn against all of the above and
firmly hang on to their position because &quot;accomplishing the
revolutionary project&quot; requires this &quot;sacrifice&quot;.

We can now bestow upon him some of our nicknames including &quot;Chief&quot;, or
&quot;Mr. President&quot; or &quot;Leader,&quot; since he is keen on emulating us blindly
in a way, thereby making us bow our head in humility. We were not
aware that the charm of our &quot;Republican&quot; leaders has simply radiated
to Latin America. We also did not know that we will now have an ally
overseas who has the same ability as our leaders to subdue
parliaments, amend constitutions and extend mandates, and whose photos
we shall raise everywhere, not just in Beirut and Gaza District.

Just a few days ago, the Venezuelan President called on the
Parliament, filled with his adherents, to amend the constitution and
delete the provision that prohibits holding the reigns of the
presidency for more than two consecutive mandates. He said that, in
order to complete building socialism in his country, he needs to
assume power till 2021 at least, and maybe forever. It seems as though
socialism was devised for him and shaped according to him. Therefore,
no one else will be able to understand it or shoulder the
responsibility to implement or defend it.

As part of applying himself assiduously to socialism, he also called
for taking control of the foreign currencies reserve of the oil
country in accordance with the need to make theory and &quot;material&quot;
practice meet. He did not forget to confirm to his deputies whose
applause echoed throughout the Parliament, in a scene reminiscent of
the speeches of Saddam Hussein or other graduates of the &quot;Baath&quot;
school, that his endless tenure &quot;depends upon many developments.&quot;
Demonstrations may later on be launched to &quot;convince&quot; him of that.

Shavez was able to stir up the zeal of the Venezuelans when he
challenged the Americans. These are fit every label and have burned
their bridges with almost all countries of the world. Therefore, most
of his people stood by him. We were hoping that he wouldn't disappoint
them by considering that their salvation is contingent upon him and
not upon his ideas and stances he adopted. Thus, it is possible, as it
generally assumed in any democratic regime, for anyone else to proceed
with them. Instead, we were hoping that he would be a role model for
the other Latin American countries that endure dictatorship and are
called on by Shavez himself to change and move towards democracy. As
for our Middle Eastern region, Shavez thankfully stood against Israel
and its hostile practices and defended the Palestinians and Lebanese.
However, he chose to be the friend of Ahmedinejad. No sane Arab
believes that the latter's stances and policies, especially when he
overbids about &quot;eradicating the Zionist enemy,&quot; serves these two
countries and their actual interests. This is in addition to his new
Yemeni victim.

Poor Venezuelan people, they surely must reconsider their approach to
cooperation with the Arabs. They offered them in the past a terrorist
imprisoned in France. Here they are conferring upon them the project
of a dictator today. But we are lucky that he is geographically far,
or else he would have filled the &quot;void&quot; at our end with &quot;a
revolutionary army&quot; and missiles.
