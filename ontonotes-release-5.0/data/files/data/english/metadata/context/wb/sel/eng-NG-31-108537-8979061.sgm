The way the &quot;out of Africa&quot; theory has been presented to me, the flow
of genes is supposed to have always been one-way:  Homo Erectus leaves
Africa and learns to survive in a variety of different places, but we're
descended from any of *those* Homo Erecti.  Later, archaic Homo Sapiens
migrates out of Africa, but we're not descended from any of *those*
archaic Homo Sapiens, etc.  This never seemed right to me; if we were
capable of travelling all over the world before we were even human, then
why aren't we descended from some of those travelling pre-humans?  If
anything, natural selection should *favor* geographic mobility.  Then
I read about the Toba catastrophy hypothesis in Wikipedia.

Quoting from the wiki entry: &quot;genetic evidence suggests that all humans
alive today, despite their apparent variety, are descended from a very
small population, perhaps between 1,000 and 10,000 breeding pairs.&quot;
Let's leave aside for now the discussion of whether this is what
actually happened, and speculate that it did.  If the number was toward
the low end, I assume that these 1,000 or so breeding pairs had to be
close enough to each other geographically that their families could meet
up in time to save each other from the effects of inbreeding.  Now, my
question:  Would a bottleneck event like that erase all genetic evidence
of previous geographical distribution, and produce the &quot;Out of Africa&quot;
effect?  Of course all modern humans are descended from people who
migrated out of Africa 70,000 years ago--that's all that was left!  If
cosmopolitan, globe-trotting pre-humans had, in previous millenia,
occasionaly returned to woo the naive, provincial gals back home, would
there be any evidence for or against this in the post-bottleneck genome?

Of course, this hypothesis could be supported or debunked by *other*
sorts of evidence, like distribution of tool innovations, but that is
more a topic for sci.anthro.paleo.

We can only go with the data.  If populations outside of Africa
contributed to the gene pool they didn't contribute very much.

Most of the genetic variation in the human population is still in
Africa, but even that shows that there was a bottleneck where the
effective population size of humanity was pretty small.  I've seen
estimates of on the order of 1,000.  Several sub populations
apparently made it out of Africa after this bottle neck and show the
expected reduction in genetic variation of taking a part of a larger
population and moving it somewhere else.  The populations outside of
Africa do not show detectable mixing from populations of Homo that may
have been in the areas that they were moving into.  They mainly show a
part of the variation that exists in Africa.

If there was extensive mixing we would have to explain why the
populations outside of Africa do not show evidence of it.  We would
expect the previous populations of Homo to have genetic variation
different from that left in Africa after the bottleneck there because
these populations branched off before the bottleneck.  If you look at
humans we have about 1/5 the genetic variation as other species like
chimps or deer.  This is the evidence for a bottleneck.  Humans lost
quite a lot of their genetic diversity.  Mixing with other populations
outside of Africa should have increased the diversity of those
populations to include a lot of genetic diversity not found in Africa
instead of decreasing it to a subset of what was left in Africa.

No, I didn't mean that after the bottleneck, people moved out of
Africa and mixed with survivors elsewhere.  No, lettuce assume for
the moment that the bottleneck survivors where 1,000 people in Africa,
and everyone else on Earth died.  So of course, everyone alive today
shows the out-of-Africa genetic subset pattern that you describe in
the later text that I cut.  That makes perfect sense; what diversity
was left after the bottleneck spread through Africa, and subsets of
that emmigrated.

My question was the following:  Doesn't the bottleneck event destroy
genetic evidence of *previous* geographic wanderings?  Could some
of the Homo Erectus that went to Asia have had descendents who
wandered back west again, and re-mixed with the Homo Erectus gene
pool in Africa *long before modern humans emerged*?  Is it possible
that the 1,000 modern humans in Africa that survived the most recent
bottleneck event themselves had ancestors (if you went far enough
back) among those *earlier* populations of pre-humans that wandered
about?

Our ancestors seem to have been travelling all over the place long
before &quot;we&quot;, i.e., anatomically modern humans, existed.  When you
have a highly mobile species with a large, contiguous geographic
range, shouldn't there be mixing throughout the population?

Hi Paul,

I agree with your concern.  Genetic bottlenecks lead to lineage extinctions
which, like all kinds of biological extinction, takes away information that
might have been available to us.  This limits the kinds of inferences we can
try to draw from the residual available information.  The ancient
biogeographies of even extant lineages is not available to us in the genetic
data, in any case.  We can only assume that these lineages have always been
where we find them now, even if this seems highly unlikely.  In other words,
this is one area in which we tend to reach too far for inferences because we
are protected from criticism by the absence of data.

That is not a reasonable assumption -- as
you have stated it.  Better (scientifically if
not morally, nor politically correctly) is the
assumption that the ~1,000 started as one
small tribe, and in the process of a great
expansion, wiped out all the rest of the
species.  Perhaps it did this with superior
technology but, thinking about it now,
disease was probably a major 'weapon', as
it has been for Europeans in their roughly
similar expansion over the past 500 years.
This 'tribe' of ~1,000 had maybe domesticated
pigs, acquired diseases from them, become
immune to them, and then spread.

The taxon has the capacity to be mobile,
but it also dislikes strangers.  The first
occupants of a region will not allow
others to enter.

IMO both modern and ancient evidence
shows that there was little mixing.  Eastern
and Western Neanderthals are extremely
divergent.  There is the extraordinarily
wide range of fossil species in Africa, and
evidence of overlapping existence of
different species (or sub-species) --
showing that mixing was not occurring.

------------------- From a recent finding -------------------
http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/6937476.stm

Now, habilis and erectus are now thought to be sister species
that overlapped in time.

The new fossil evidence reveals an overlap of about 500,000 years
during which Homo habilis and Homo erectus must have co-existed
in the Turkana basin area, the region of East Africa where the fossils
were unearthed.

&quot;Their co-existence makes it unlikely that Homo erectus evolved
from Homo habilis,&quot; said co-author Professor Meave Leakey,
palaeontologist and co-director of the Koobi Fora Research Project.

The Toba catastrophe theory posits a supervolcano that caused severe
climate change for a few years.  True, not everyone else died out
*right away*, but survivors in other places may have been too sparse
to form vialble communities, and died out in a very small number of
generations.  Some of the displacement you describe may have happened,
but after a massive winnowing.  Oh, I should have said &quot;1,000 to
10,000 breeding pairs&quot;, not &quot;1,000 people&quot;.

The way the out of Africa model has been presented to me, new types
of hominids come out of Africa and replace those living outside of
Africa like new versions of Windows coming out of Redmond, Washington.
The gene flow is allegedly one-way only; Homo Erectus migrated out of
Africa to settle Asia, but we aren't descended from any of *those*
Homo Erectus, only from ones who stayed in Africa.  Later, archaic
Homo Sapiens migrates out of Africa, but we aren't descended from
any of *those* archaic Homo Sapiens, etc.  Finally, the modern Homo
Sapiens Sapiens who migrated out of Africa had no ancestors from
Asia or Europe, I am supposed to believe.

There is no remotely parallel bottleneck in
other species, nearly all of which would have
been exposed to these effects as much as
humans and other hominids.  In fact, the
latter were undoubtedly capable of exploiting
a much wider range of resources than most
other species and should have been much
less affected by that event.

Wild pigs are (were?) often captured by
tribesmen, fattened up and then
slaughtered.  This is not 'husbandry'
but may well have provided contact
close enough for the transmission of
disease.  Of course, there are numerous
other species which had long had a
close relationship with humans -- and
could have passed on their diseases..
How about the fishing otters of
Bangladesh? Or cats?   DNA shows
that they have been domesticated for
at least 100 kyr.

Yes, but if we had extant Homo erectus we might be able to tease out
whether they made it back into Africa and contributed.  We would need
genetic evidence, and since they are all dead and we can't seem to get
any DNA that old out of the fossils we have to resort to other means,
like trying to identify odd bits of the genome that may show evidence
of intermixing due to their patterns of DNA sequence variation.

Right now we can't rule out that there was migration back into
Africa.  The horse example where the ancestors of modern horses may
have come back to Asia from North America is such an example that we
seem to have fossils to demonstrate.  It used to be that the Homo
erectus skulls with the largest cranial capacity were found in Asia,
but I haven't kept up with the research in years.

I tend to agree with that analysis. So what are the best hypotheses
of what may have happened to our ancestors? For example, was there
a big war between our ancestors and some sister hominid species,
whereby our ancestors were nearly wiped out, and had to hole up in
some place inaccessible to the enemy for a while? Or did some
really wonderful new gene arise in one of our ancestors, and that
new gene swept through the population, giving great selective
advantage to those with it, but breeding with only a small number
of &quot;others&quot; up to a total wonderful-new-gene population of a few
thousand, after which our ancestors with that wonderful new gene
stopped breeding with the others (they didn't &quot;need&quot; to any longer
because enough of them existed that they could breed just amongst
themselves and get by fine, or a reproductive barrier arose)?

Or maybe something like the proposal of disease: A pandemic almost
drove our ancestors extinct, but a few happened to be immune, and
those few survived, infecting any remaining members of the
non-immune phenotype to finally wipe the last of them out.

&gt; Now, habilis and erectus are now thought to be sister species
&gt; that overlapped in time.
">

I agree that latter day habilis, shortly before they became
extinct, were very likely sister to middle day erectus that lived
at the same time. But unless we can find erectus fossils all the
way back to the earliest habilis fossils, there's a chance that the
earliest habilis are ancestral to both of those later sister
species. Perhaps a small group of habilis became isolated from the
main group, experienced rapid drift and/or adaption, which by
chance allowed them to expand in number to rival the remaining
descendents in the habilis main group. There may have been many
small isolated groups of habilis, all but one of which drifted to
extinction, but that one drifted to success. This is the usual
punctuated equilibrium hypothesis, that there were large numbers of
both the main habilis group all the way along, and of the later
clade of erectus after their numbers grew due to their successful
drift or adaption, leaving fossils we can see, but the h-&gt;e
founding population was too small to leave any fossils for us to
find, so we have no h-&gt;e transitionals. Maybe some day we'll find
one or two to clinch the case. Or maybe it'll remain unresolved. Or
maybe we'll find DNA from both major groups at various times, and a
cladogram will look like this (vertical postion represents time,
oldest at top, while horixontal position represents genetic
distance along shortest path from final of each major group):
H
H
E     H
E        H
E          H
E            H
E            H
E             H
E
E
E
Note the gross anatomical changes came first, to allow erectus to
employ a different survival strategy from habilis, to live in the
new habitat initially, and later to co-exist with habilis in
overlapping territory without competing too much for the very same
resources. Then later adjustments to other biological features such
as metabolism or mating behaviour etc. followed, driving the
cladogram further away from habilis without much affecting the
morphospecies we observe in the fossil record. Thus we see two
distinct narrowly-peaked morphospecies in the fossil record, but
will see (when we get the DNA) a spectrum with only a small gap in
the genome span.

I disagree. My cross-plot between time and genetic distance above
is entirely consistent with both co-existance and ancestry. If we
believe Gould's theory of punctuated equilibrium, we have to treat
my kind of scenerio as acutally quite likely, almost exactly what
we would expect. Too bad we don't have the DNA to test our
competing hypotheses.

&gt; From: nos ... @nospam.com (Paul Ciszek)
&gt; The way the out of Africa model has been presented to me, new types
&gt; of hominids come out of Africa and replace those living outside of
&gt; Africa like new versions of Windows coming out of Redmond, Washington.
&gt; The gene flow is allegedly one-way only; Homo Erectus migrated out of
&gt; Africa to settle Asia, but we aren't descended from any of *those*
&gt; Homo Erectus, only from ones who stayed in Africa.  Later, archaic
&gt; Homo Sapiens migrates out of Africa, but we aren't descended from
&gt; any of *those* archaic Homo Sapiens, etc.  Finally, the modern Homo
&gt; Sapiens Sapiens who migrated out of Africa had no ancestors from
&gt; Asia or Europe, I am supposed to believe.
">

Given reluctance of different sub-species to fully mate with each
other, it makes much sense to me. Here's how I see the logic:
First there were one clade of monkeys, then Pangea split, breaking
it into two clades, old world and new world monkeys.
Old world was bigger, so it had room to split further, spawning the
clade of apes from out of the larger clade of monkeys.
Apes were successful and spread between Africa and Borneo.
(I don't know where they started. Do you?)
The African apes were more successful and split further, first
Gorilla / ChiHomid, then Chimp/Homid.
The homids were most successul of them all, inhabiting virtually
all of Africa and spreading small clades outside.
Now here's the key part: Since the home of the homids was Africa,
and it was large enough to support many local populations, and
Africa was hospitable enough to support *large* local populations
almost everywhere, it evolved lots of variation. At first it had
*all* the variation of homids. When a small clade left Africa to
some other continent, *most* of the variation remained in Africa,
so of course with most of the starting points for further
evolution, Africa had the best chances each time to be the lucky
winner with the one new innovation that allowed another sub-clade
to both grow within Africa and expand out of Africa. This one lucky
winner was vastly superior to whatever had left Africa long ago, so
it simply replaced the native populations outside Africa, sometimes
quickly, sometimes it took more time as with Flores man. Within
Africa, because of the many starting points for further evolution,
several clades did almost as well as the *best* clade, able to hold
out against invasion, and persist to this very day. But outside
Africa, with only one starting point, there was no chance to keep
almost up with the latest version of African Windows NT. Each major
round of evolution brought lots of innovations within the surviving
populations in Africa, increasing the variety, until one of them
chanced to get yet another wonderful new innovation that swept its
local part of Africa and also spread unresited through the rest of
the Old world.

It's theoretically possible that just by very good luck the one (1)
small clade in the rest of the Old world might have chanced upon
the one innovation that alllowed them to return back to conquer
part of Africa, but in fact that didn't happen until a few hundred
years ago, and those periods of colonization (Arabs, then
Europeans) were due to advanced technology rather than bare
evolution. For close to a million years, the Africans had the
advantage of more starting points for evolution hence more chance
of the key new innovation, and by chance they held onto that
advantage. Not until agriculture did their dominion end, and not
until advanced technology did anyone else's dominion start.

That's an interesting philosophical point. Let's suppose a boy from
tribe A made whoopy with a girl from tribe B without permission of
either A/B tribal leaders. Furthermore suppose that girl of B got
pregnant, and the baby was obviously of mixed race, not her
husband's child, some *alien*'s fucker's child. What would that
husband most likely do to that child the moment the mother isn't
watching it?

&gt;&gt; There is no remotely parallel bottleneck in
&gt;&gt; other species, nearly all of which would have
&gt;&gt; been exposed to these effects as much as
&gt;&gt; humans and other hominids.  In fact, the
&gt;&gt; latter were undoubtedly capable of exploiting
&gt;&gt; a much wider range of resources than most
&gt;&gt; other species and should have been much
&gt;&gt; less affected by that event.

&gt; I tend to agree with that analysis. So what are the best hypotheses
&gt; of what may have happened to our ancestors? For example, was there
&gt; a big war between our ancestors and some sister hominid species,
&gt; whereby our ancestors were nearly wiped out, and had to hole up in
&gt; some place inaccessible to the enemy for a while? Or did some
&gt; really wonderful new gene arise in one of our ancestors, and that
&gt; new gene swept through the population, giving great selective
&gt; advantage to those with it, but breeding with only a small number
&gt; of &quot;others&quot; up to a total wonderful-new-gene population of a few
&gt; thousand, after which our ancestors with that wonderful new gene
&gt; stopped breeding with the others (they didn't &quot;need&quot; to any longer
&gt; because enough of them existed that they could breed just amongst
&gt; themselves and get by fine, or a reproductive barrier arose)?
">

I would suggest that over the past
6 million years or so, there have been
thousands of 'really wonderful new
genes' each initially spreading through
a small local population. When enough
of these 'new genes' had accumulated in
any one population (or 'sub-species')
that group would have expanded at the
expense of its neigbours (which it would
see as competitors) occasionally doing
so on a world-wide basis.

This is a VERY different model of gene-
dispersal from the usual one conceived,
and from that which applies to the great
bulk of mammalian (and other) species,
under which each gene effectively
spreads one at a time and only if it directly
benefits those individuals possessing it.
That model must certainly have applied to
the initial spread of each gene within the
local population, but the warring nature of
the hominid species, allied to its capacity
to form very large groups, enabled a much
faster 'group-selection' thereafter.

That sounds to me like a reasonable hypothesis. One
question/problem: How did more than one such gene get into a single
local population? Do you assume some limited amount of gene flow
between nearby local populations, which created *some* mixing of
the separately-originated genes, but by chance a major mixing event
happened somewhere, which mixed enough genes together to produce a
sub-population much more fit than the rest, which quickly replaced
the local population then spilled rapidly to displace other local
populations?

So what do you think of my argument that since the most genetic
variation was in the various locales within Africa, the most ways
that new genes could work cooperatively with old genes of various
types was in Africa too, so most of these successful new local
genes occurred in various places in Africa, so the odds were in
favor of your *big*mixing* happening there by chance too?

This is a complicated, and scary, scenerio to consider. It may very
well be correct. I hope our two resident experts, Wilkins and PiP
will make comments about it too. (And if Tom Hendricks uses this as
an excuse to claim that the environment, specifically the Sun
cycle, forced these wonderful new mutations, just ignore him!)

Once a species becomes technological,
starts to develop language, and evolve
group dynamics, huge opportunities
open up for all manner of new genes.

No.  I see each hominid 'tribe' as self-contained,
following the patterns we have seen in places

how big those 'tribes' were.

I find nearly all talk of 'new genes'
pointless, especially when 'chance' is
introduced.  We are not discussing
fruit-flies, but a new kind of species,
entering a whole new dimension --
bringing in reasoning, language, and
technology.  Each tiny stage probably
represented a huge leap, giving its
possessors potentially great advantages
over its neighbours.

Another factor which IMHO made a
difference were social hierarchies and
the almost conscious selection of 'new
genes' by its leaders. So a 'Leonardo da
Vinci' (and his family) would shoot up
in social rank and spread his genes
among the privileged, and then among
the rest of the tribe.  But it is more, in
that the 'new genes' would always
operate among the top levels of the
society first, and then spread into the
rest of the the society.  We can see
this in recent history, assuming that
there are genes for skills like reading.
Those who don't have them cannot
expect to prosper.
