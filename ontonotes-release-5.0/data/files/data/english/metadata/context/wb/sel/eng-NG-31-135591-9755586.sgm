Dear Friends,
using The Ruby how can I remove all the comments in my c program.
For example I have mentioned c program ,that may be ruby program
for your       purpose you assume.
I have tried to do using the regular expression.
But I was unable to find the anser for this.

Please any one tell me.

The most simple regexen would be %r(//.*$) to match single line comments
and %r(/\*.*?\*/)m to match multiline comments, but these will give you some
false positives - for example, when you use // or /* inside a string.
If you want something that works reliably, you would need to use a C-parser
rather than regular expressions.

It is actually possible to do this reliably using regular expressions,
but it's not straightforward.

i'd start with c's own preprocessor and go from there:

cfp:~ &gt; cat a.c
/* comment be gone */
main(){ printf(&quot;%i\n&quot;, (int)(0.55 * 100)); }

cfp:~ &gt; cpp a.c
# 1 &quot;a.c&quot;
# 1 &quot;&lt;built-in&gt;&quot;
# 1 &quot;&lt;command line&gt;&quot;
# 1 &quot;a.c&quot;

main(){ printf(&quot;%i\n&quot;, (int)(0.55 * 100)); }

cfp:~ &gt; cpp -P a.c
main(){ printf(&quot;%i\n&quot;, (int)(0.55 * 100)); }

it already knows how to strip comments.

Umm... That's illegal, by terms of the GPL. The GPL defines source code as
the preferred form for modification. Intentionally obfuscated code isn't
the preferred form for modification. So while it's technically &quot;source
code&quot;, it isn't according to the definition in the GPL, and thus they're
violating the license by doing that.

well, i had &quot;pleasure&quot; of having internship in company which policy was

If you HAVE to use GPL make sure your changes are not documented, and
you use variable names like a,b,c and function names like fa fb etc.

while it's illegal to obscure code that's covered by gpl, if you write
code that extends it, you can argue it's your programming style, code
like this even not technically obfuscated is useless.

GPL can't force you to write documentation or make sefl-documenting code.

Worshipping comments is an intermediate, not advanced, behavior.

Comments have plenty of legitimate reasons to disappear, not least of which
is comments written only to satisfy some perverse mandated code rules.

Some programmers seem to think that comments are an excuse for badly
written code. Well written code should be readable to a programmer
proficient in the language in question, this means that the need for
comments is reduced. People who insist on comments for everything tend
not to be good programmers. People who do not write any comments are
idiots no matter how advanced they are. There is always a need for
comments, it just depends on the degree.

As to idiomatic code, if you are an X programmer you should be familiar
with the idioms, if not learn some more. Also what is called idiomatic
depends on you background, ++x could be considered an idiom if your
background was perhaps COBOL, FORTRAN or LISP. Do you really expect such
code to be commented just in case someone isn't familiar with the 'idiom'?

The comments might be wrong! Comments tend not to be updated with the
same rigour as the code. It is sometimes better to throw the comments
out and make the programmer read the code to determine what it is doing
than be led astray by badly written comments. The code is the authority
as to what the program is doing, the comments are just commentary and
cannot affect the execution of the code. Of course the *best* course of
action is to completely rewrite the comments but if you can't do that
then I would recommend removing comments that serve only to confuse the
programmer.

Perhaps the original poster is going to run some custom code metrics

Perhaps the original poster is going to annotate the code in a

We're curious why you want to strip out comments, and whether it may
or may not be a good idea. I wanted to suggest to several others that
there are legitimate reasons, though a few of them might be slightly
misguided. Perhaps if you explained why you want to get rid of the
comments, it would clear up some of the messages in this thread.

I would say that if you had been open about your reasons for wanting to remove the comments from the C code then you would have got a better reception. You still haven't given a clear and open reason for doing this, instead you are hiding behind the &quot;I'm the wounded party here&quot; clause.

Be open and honest with the list and the list will help, if you try to hide things then the list will throw about allegations and accusations about your intent and you won't the help that you requested.

&gt; We're curious why you want to strip out comments, and whether it may
&gt; or may not be a good idea. I wanted to suggest to several others that
&gt; there are legitimate reasons, though a few of them might be slightly
&gt; misguided. Perhaps if you explained why you want to get rid of the
&gt; comments, it would clear up some of the messages in this thread.

Hello Friends,
I am also working in software company.
You ask know why are removing the comments in your c program.
For needness I want to remove all the comments and also I want to align
all the program coding lines.

people need to step back and realize that this is a religious issue
not really related to ruby itself.

i happen to think comments are a crutch in in any language.  here is
an excerpt from the last program i wrote:

#! /dmsp/reference/bin/ruby

require 'time'
require 'ostruct'
require 'alib'
require 'lockfile'
require 'dmsp'
require 'nrtlib'
require 'stpjob'

Main {

synopsis &quot;gen_night_file_from_dawn_dusk_orbit_pairs [options]+
descending_olspath [ascending_olspath]&quot;

default &quot;destination&quot; =&gt; &quot;/dmsp/nrt/data/incoming/
night_files_dawn_dusk&quot;
default &quot;window&quot;      =&gt; (42.minutes .. 62.minutes)

option &quot;--link&quot;                    , &quot;-l&quot; ,
&quot;link files to operate on - default(copy)&quot;

option &quot;--destination=destination&quot; , &quot;-d&quot; ,
&quot;specify output destination - default(#{ default 'destination' })&quot;

option &quot;--clobber&quot;                 , &quot;-c&quot; ,
&quot;force output to be clobbered iff it exists - default(false)&quot;

option &quot;--window=window&quot; ,           &quot;-w&quot; ,
&quot;specify time window in which to look for ascending mate -
default(#{ default('window').to_a.join ',' }s)&quot;

option &quot;--turd&quot;                    , &quot;-t&quot; ,
&quot;leave your things lying around default(false)&quot;

argument          &quot;descending_olspath&quot;

optional_argument &quot;ascending_olspath&quot;

def main
setup

tmpdir do |tmp|
atomically_download_input
generate_night_files
atomically_upload_output
exit! 42 if turd?
end

exit 0
end

...
...
...

i do not think comment can add any clarity to code that's written
like this and, yes, you can do the same in C.  that being said i'm
(literally) on crutches now and everyone needs them sometimes - they
are not evil - just crutches.  compilers are crutches for not being
able to write assembly code quickly enough.

Yes, it's nothing to do with ruby, religious issue? I don't think so.

Well, I don't think the HLL compiler/LLL assembler analogy is right or
elevant here.

I understand that well written code can really reduce the need for comments
and comments can sometimes get in the way of reading the flow of code. The
real judge of whether comments are useful is when someone else who hasn't
written the code has to read it. They may even be new to the problem domain
and programming so what seems obvious to those 'in the zone' might be a
complete mystery to someone else, so comments are helpful in those
circumstances. Then we consider the environment where the code is written.
You might be writing the code, but two years down the line, Sarah will be
trying to make sense of it. Sarah has been told to add some feature to the
code if it's not there already. She's been told it's probably there, but
feature 'x' didn't go live when it should have, so it may already have been
coded, or not. It may just need testing to make sure that feature works. Of
course, you've left the company and changed address and phone number. Worse
still, you quarrelled with your old project manager so aren't minded to
co-operate in helping Sarah know what state the code's in.

If nothing else comments can provide a way of tracing the history of code, a
way of identifying who did what and a way of annotation so that you know
that a particular section of code has been altered to suit a particular
change request or bugfix (&quot;Sarah, we've changed the database and object
model, please alter any code that was introduced for change request 66.9 to
reflect the new changes. Please check with whoever made those changes if you
can.&quot;).

So, I agree comments should be kept to a minimum. I don't agree that they
are a crutch - they are important for the working dynamic in an environment
where programmers aren't just developing for themselves. If you were working
in my team, you would be including comments - like it or not.

Paul
