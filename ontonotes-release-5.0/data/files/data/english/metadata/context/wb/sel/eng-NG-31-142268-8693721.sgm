I reissue this press release with corrections approved by Nancy Grant. I
erred in claiming she received 5 years probation, when she actually received
15 years.

I encourage everyone reading this to send a letter to your local newspaper
editor, chiding them for not picking up the story. Mainstream media,
including Fox News ignores stories like this because they don't involve
sports figures, murder, or sex abuse. Nancy Grant received a sentence of
virtual torture and bondage to the state for exercising her constitutional
right to tell others about the law and their constitutional rights. May God
have mercy on the evil men and women who practice iniquity under color of
law while not having valid loyalty oaths that would qualify them to perform
official acts.

Press Release - for Immediate Release and Broad Distribution

25 September 2007, revised 27 September 2007

Nancy Grant Freed with 15 Years Probation and $30,500 Fine.

Haworth Muzzles Grant - no more talking about the law.

Arcadia, Florida - With a slight smile and big feeling of relief, Nancy
Grant walked out of Chief Judge Lee Haworth's 12th Circuit courtroom in
Arcadia, free to go about her life almost as before her conviction on 19
counts of Unlicensed Practice of Law three weeks ago.

Almost.

According to Grant in an interview after her sentencing hearing this
morning, the judge heaped plenty of conditions upon her, including a fine of
$30,315.00 and 15 years of probation.  &quot;All I can do is breathe&quot; Grant said.
&quot;I can't file another paper for another person.  If I go to the courthouse
and file a paper for my son, I'll be put in jail.&quot;

In the hearing, Grant began by saying she wanted to fire her lawyer, but
judge refused to allow her to do it, according to Bob McMillian, one of
Grant's supporters.   &quot;Judge Haworth read into the record the transcript her
claim of numerous reasons why the court had no jurisdiction over her.  He
also read her synopsis as to where the mess started with the 1933
bankruptcy, the government borrowing money based on birth certificates, and
the resulting commercial obligations,&quot; McMillian explained.

&quot;After that, I told the judge that I'm a flesh and blood person and you
can't put me in jail, and the jury convicted a fictional person,&quot; Grant
said, referring to the upper case name under which the State Attorney
charged with crimes.

In the post-trial interview Grant alluded to the court's hypocrisy when she
commented:  &quot;They say 'we're not corporate or operating in commerce, but
they want thirty thousand dollars from me.&quot;

&quot;A lot will be coming from this,&quot; Grant explained.  &quot;The judge said a higher
court will have to deal with the matter the organic constitution and the
courts operating in commerce.&quot; I can't communicate with any inmates but my
son in the department of corrections.  I have to pay $30,315.00 in fines by
Monday, December 3, or my drivers license will be revoked until its paid.
I cannot file any civil actions in state court unless I am represented by a
Florida Bar attorney.  I can't do any of the things defined in the states
proposed special jury instructions for the specifics are deemed as the
'Practice of Law,' and I have until October 15th to remove myself as
president of the  non profit corporation known as the, Florida Pro Se Bar,
Inc.  The huge fine includes fees for the investigation and prosecution of
my case.  They've become emboldened in law-breaking.  There is no law to
them any more.

Hurt discovered Friday that the State Courts Administrator in Tallahassee
does not possess a loyalty oath for Haworth that complies with Florida
Statute 876.05.  &quot;According to the law, Haworth does not have valid
credentials to sit as judge or collect a paycheck,&quot; Hurt said.  The 1999
Prieto Bail Bonds v State of Texas ruling by the Texas Supreme Court for
criminal appeals corroborates Hurt's assertion.  That court overturned a
senior judge's ruling because his lack of a valid loyalty oath disqualified
him for office.  For that reason he had no authority to rule, and his
official acts became nullities.

Asked about her feelings about the fairness of the sentence, Grant replied
&quot;My family is glad I'm not in jail.  The state attorney wanted me in jail a
minimum of 5 years, and so did the Department of Probation/Corrections. I
received the Pre-sentence investigation report when I arrived in court just
5 minutes before the hearing began.  I was not allowed to have an
Allocution, which is time for me to speak about any objections involving my
case, even if it takes 3 hours. Judge Haworth cut me off interrupting me by
asking the state attorney, Donald Hartery questions that did not relate to
what I was talking about.&quot;

Grant believes the broad public support she received from members of We the
People of Florida and others around the nation helped bring about a more
humane sentence than she otherwise might have received.  &quot;Like my dad said,
I don't think they'll lock you up, look at the upheaval that has already
happened.&quot; Nancy said, &quot;I thank everyone for their support.&quot;

Grant has done her own part in publicizing the case by responding vibrantly
to interview requests, and by erecting a billboard near Arcadia.  &quot;My
billboard is up on highway 17 driving north, about 2 miles south of Nocatee,
Florida,&quot; Grant said.  &quot;It says..NancyGrant.info.. and that's it. My son has
already received numerous calls from friends who had have seen it.&quot;

Grant said, I don't want to reveal my immediate plans,&quot; she said, &quot;but the
war's not over yet, it's just begun, so expect some action in the near
future.&quot;
