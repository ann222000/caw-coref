I'm not sure that this is considered traditional, but we prefer our
pulled pork on hot dog buns instead of hamburger buns.  We eat ours with
a pretty heavy serving of sweet slaw and a topping of apple cider
vinegar mixed with Texas Pete and perhaps a little cayenne to give it
even more tang.  The vinegar and dressing on the slaw make the hamburger
buns really fall apart, where the hot dog ones seem to hold it all and
hang together.

I did a bunch of PP last weekend. Made a nice slaw too. Try some Thai sweet
chili sauce Nonny...it's good on PP.

Would you give 7 or 10 bucks, and 7 hours?  You can make it happen.
