According to my source, Bently, in Shakespeare: a Biographical
Handbook, of the 300 or so authors who contributed to Elizabethan
drama, there were &quot;professional playwrights who made their living by
keeping actors supplied with plays,&quot; which they prepared in close
cooperation with them, but &quot;only a few who were more fully involved in
theatrical affairs, (who) not only wrote plays but acted in them: the
actor-dramatists Thomas Heywood, William Rowley, Nathan Field, and
William Shakespeare.&quot;

Bently notes that Shakespeare was more &quot;theater-tainted&quot; than other
famous dramatists, such as Thomas Kyd, Christopher Marlowe, John Lyly,
Ben Jonson, George Chapman, John Webser, John Fletcher, and James
Shirley&quot; because he is the only one &quot;who is known to have been, over a
long period of years, a theater owner.&quot;

So Shakespeare was playwright, actor, acting company &quot;sharer,&quot; and
theater owner (housekeeper).

A heck of an actor if S as only a figurehead managed to work closely
with play troupes in successfully creating and producing box office
plays, much less standing in as a monument for the real Shakespeare.
Even so, the Bard got the money and the fame; so who upstaged who in
the fakeSpeare go-around?

I'm afraid there would be a point of diminishing returns and muse
failure for anyone laboriously ghost writing popular plays over the
years without recognition. In Sherlock Holmes mysteries you're
supposed to be able to figure out motive, aren't you? Bentley's
biographical handbook suggests that Stratman was a successful
businessman with a multi-faceted career. So what success or
motivation did any alternate candidate have besides monument building?
Is it an iconoclast like Professor Moriarty who steals someone's good
name and just deserts? bb

And acting the part would only be the beginning. He would also have to have
been a truly great literary critic if he was able to convince the 25
&quot;principal players&quot; he was the true author. He would have had to have known
the plays, cold, to give an explanation of difficult lines on the spot (and
do the occasional rewrite), and have been at least as familiar with the
sources as the True Author. How often could he say &quot;Um, I've got to go to
the privy&quot; and disappear for a day while he checked in with Derby? In fact,
the guy would have had to have been so fantastic, he might as well have been
... well, Shakespeare.

Couldn't be done. The 25 would have known, certainly; so would most of the
bit players, ticket sellers, etc., as well as their wives, pals, bartenders,
etc. It would have been a very poorly kept secret.

What sort of great purpose and accomplishment is this? Sounds to me like bard-envy as substitution for personal achievement. What did Oxenford ever really accomplish besides starting a library? Must have been disappointing to be just a spy and suffer mockery in the plays. Marlowe's career seems to have been terminated with prejudice, too. Hopefully, Oxford didn't do him in. Bacon took some deliberate public career hits that brought him down--how smart was that? Even Jonson fell out of favor with James I and had to flee, I understand. He probably knew where all the bones were buried, but as a defense had the foresight to chronicle everything in writing, as he did his own plays.

The real MONUMENT, of course, is probably Jonson's compilation of the First Folio as his did his own work. And there Jonson tells us not to look for Shakespeare in the facsimile of his likeness, as at the Monument, but in the canon. So Stratman is peeking and winking at us from between the lines. bb

The monument was vandalized in 1974, and
the opportunity was taken to refurbish the
whole thing. Before this, there was a question
mark after the word 'FAST', a colon after the
word 'DIDE', and the word you noticed was
indeed 'CANST' as one might have expected.
A very clear illustration of what it looked like
before 1974 is given in J.O. Halliwell-Phillipps
*Outlines of a Life of Shakespeare&quot; (1896),

It is just possible, I suppose, that the people
responsible for the refurbishment found it odd
to suggest that someone who was *already*
reading the epitaph would be unable to carry
on doing so. In this case they might have
thought it better to tell them to carry on if
they had already *begun* to read, which
'ganst' could (at a stretch) have meant. It
would be the 2nd person singular of the
word 'gan', as used for example, in *Venus
and Adonis*:

&quot;O pity,&quot; gan she cry, &quot;flint-hearted boy!
'Tis but a kiss I beg - why art thou coy?&quot;

Given that those responsible also managed to

put the two little cherubs (putti) back the

wrong way round (which it took three years

for anyone to notice!) however, I am more

inclined to think that it was just a mistake.

The problem here is that both of you have

professional company of actors.

It's based on next to nothing -- it's virtually

THAT, by-and-large, is it.

The phenomenon is astonishing -- and

IF there had been those 25 actors, as well
as all the bit players, ticket-sellers, etc.,
then you'd have a case. But there wasn't --
or we have little or no evidence that there
was a company regularly performing the
canonical plays to public audiences from
the early or mid-1590s onwards. Only 7
public performances plus one sequence
(15 of 1Henry6) are recorded. Some of
those records are uncertain and may be
forged.

In any case, the canonical plays were, by
that time, quite old. The actors would not
have expected to meet the playwright, any
more than their 20th century equivalents
would have expected to meet, say, Arthur
Miller in the late 1980s.

<POSTDATE> 2004-08-29T10:37:00 </POSTDATE>

Thanks, Buffalo. You beat me to the punch, and your reply was much more
succinct than mine probably would have been. So allow me to elaborate :)

It's true there's not MUCH evidence, Paul. But the published plays and
testimonials comprise more real, documentary, evidence than we have for any
English Renaissance playwright except, I suppose, Jonson. Renaissance lit
scholars would be in heaven if they had so much evidence for most
playwrights of the era.

I don't pretend that my speculation about the players' reaction to the
ignoramus posing as an author in their midst is evidence. It's a logical
inference, in the absence of evidence, based on your premise: If we accept
the theory that (insert candidate name here) wrote the plays, then certain
things (players discovering the hoax, candidate remaining silent for
decades) seem likely to have happened. Scholars use this all the time
(e.g., when trying to trace the sources of the plays), but it's the sort of
thing you use when you run out of real evidence.

Unless I'm mistaken, there's NO documentary evidence for the
anti-Stratfordian case. No contemporary attributions of the plays to
someone else; no complaints about Shakespeare usurping authorship; heck, no
one even even expresses doubts about Shakespeare's capability to write the
plays (don't let's start up with Greene again, okay? He's equivocal at
best, way-early, and a grouch to boot). Although it was not really my
intention to fight fire with fire, it's worth noting that my posts offer
some logical inference and circumstantial evidence on the pro-Stratford side
(there is much more, of course). Since your case is built entirely on this
sort of evidence, I should think you'd find it more persuasive.

This seems like a good place to point out that my comments in another thread
about the theatricality of the plays was in no way intended as serious
evidence. I refuted it myself (or attemped to, at any rate) in an unrelated
posting, when I said something like &quot;The author of the plays, whoever he
was, was a singular genius - who's to say what he was not capable of?&quot; If
we had evidence that Derby - my personal fave, he's dreamy - wrote the
plays, I'd dismiss my gabbling by waving Derby's First Folio under my nose.

It's fun to talk about all of this (I like a good conspiracy theory as much
as the next guy) and I enjoy arguing with you all. But I don't think we can
pretend that the basic cases are equal. If you want to have the
anti-Stratfordian case taken seriously, you'll need to come up with SOME
kind of documentary evidence of equal weight to the Stratfordian. As I
said, it's not much, but it weighs a lot more than nothing at all.
Meanwhile, enjoy the argument, but don't ask:

Okay, I'm outta here for a week. I don't think Stratford, Ontario, has any
internet cafes, and if they do, I'll keep out of them, so don't be
distressed if I don't get back to any replies for a while. Keep the
arguments warm while I'm gone.

There are very many phonetic ones,considerable amounts of them, not
exclusively:-

There is a clear precedent of GAN; from Chaucer, in the same sense of the
cit. below, meaning &quot;began&quot;.

After this stem~ word there are varieties of spelling, eg: GANE: (1) gone,
went [North], (2) to yawn, or gape [Palsgrave] and still used in
Lincolnshire, pronounced /gawn/. GANG: also means 'to go' [North] ... hence
GANGDAYS; rogation week, so-called because parish boundaries were generally
perambulated at that time. There is an old ref:

Thorow grace that He us 3eveth,
Where so we gange.
/MS. Cantab. Ff. ii. 38, f. 31.

GANSE: (1) thin, slender [Kent]. (2) merriment, hilarity [Sussex]
GANT: (1) to yawn (2) Lusty, hearty (3) a village fair or wake (4) scanty
[Moor's Suffolk Words, p. 143] (4) a gander, &quot;A gose and gant&quot; [Skelton, i.
111. Giraldus Cambrebsis calls it /auca/, the same as /anser/. In Pr. Parv.
/bistarda/ or the bustard according to Ducange. Douce says /gant/ is the
gannet, a bird about the size of a goose, mentioned by Ray as found in
Cornwall.]

GANZAS: geese [Span.]

GAUNT: (1) to yawn [Northumb.] (2) the old English name for Ghent.

GAUN: (1) a gallon measure (2) going, given [North]

GAWNE: gave; still in use in Essex circa 1850.
GAWL: gold [Somerset]

However, there is also a collection of phonetically similar words, all
meaning 'simpleton', GAWNEY, eg.

&gt; It's based on next to nothing -- it's virtually
&gt; all a product of Stratfordian imaginations

&gt; they came out, from 1594 (anonymously)
&gt; and from 1598 (with the name of 'W.Shake-

&gt; THAT, by-and-large, is it.

&gt; The phenomenon is astonishing -- and
&gt; cries out for explanation.

I have a little Penguin paperback called &quot;Tudor Interludes&quot;
with original spelling and frontspieces of, for example:

&quot;Thenterlude of youth&quot;, ca. 1528, with no authors name,
then:

&quot;A new Tragicall Comedie of Apius and Virginia (...) by R.B.&quot;

I think Marlowe's works were not all published with his name
blazing across the front, and not all during his lifetime, either,
or am I wrong.

On another topic, my paperback includes a play called
&quot;A pleasant Enterlude intituled Like will to Like quoth the
Devill to the Collier. Wherin is declared what punishments
followe those that will rather live licentiously then esteeme
and followe good Councell. And what benefits they receive that
apply themselves to vertuous living and good exercises.
Made by Ulpian Fulwel.&quot;

This Ulpian Fulwell was the son of a farmer, then rector of
Naunton in Gloucestershire from 1570 till his death in 1586,
during which time he married, had a family, and studied at
Oxford in 1578.
Haven't read the play yet, which starts with a Prologue and
ends with a Song, presumably all about the rewards of virtue.

We have these extraordinary plays, and
extraordinary poems. How do we explain
their existence? The only way to do so is
to create various theories (or scenarios)
attempting to match what little evidence
we have.

You present the traditional scenario, of the
sort indicated by films like 'Shakespeare in
Love' with the Stratman being an active actor /
writer/ director wandering around the theatre
on most days between ~l591 and ~1610.
That's fine -- and I will criticise it on its own
terms -- which are that there was no cover-up,
nothing to hide, and nothing specially out-of-
the-ordinary. The first issue we have to face
is whether or not that scenario works.

But you can NOT expect that other theories
assume that scenario as well. We do not
share it. We do not have Oxford (or Derby
or whoever) doing what you THINK the
Stratman was doing.

We say that almost everything in your
scenario is false. It is a wholly mistaken

What 'documentary evidence' on the

You are missing the main drift of the

using the same type of argument.

The Stratfordian case falls . . . on its own terms.
It does not make the grade. The documents,
supposedly supporting it, do not match up.
There are too many holes. We are asked to
believe that the greatest writer in the English
Language had illiterate parents and illiterate
children . . . and made such astonishing
progress that no one in his lifetime seems to
have even noticed it. This 'famous person'
around London in those decades turns into
a ghost. No one saw him. No one met him.
No one wrote to him, nor received letters from
him. There are no anecdotes, no awards, no
meeting with any aristocrats, nor with the
Queen or the King. He writes nothing on any
of the great occasions . . the death of Queen
Elizabeth, the accession of King James, the
death of the heir Prince Henry . . . and so on
and on and on . . . .

When the Stratfordian case falls, you then
start to ask 'who really . . . .?'

Well, no, normally we don't have to lay out multiple &quot;scenarios&quot; to explain
events. If you looked at the record of my work during the eighties you
would see my monthly reports, some tangible results (not many, alas; my
little project died aborning), some &quot;testimonials&quot; in the form of letters of
praise. Thank goodness I don't have to create a scenario to justify my
continued employment.

On the other hand, since I worked at NASA at the right time, for a former
Apollo data analyst whose skills had gone rusty, and had the skill-set to
manipulate databases (and cover up my manipulation!), you could easily
construct a scenario which had me involved in the faked moon landing
coverup. No, I was NOT involved in the original faked moon landings; I was
in high-school, for God's sake. Just the coverup :)

But just because the circumstances ALLOW for me to have been involved in a
coverup doesn't make it so. In order to link me in you should present,
first of all, some strong evidence contradicting the very normal set of
documentary evidence I have for my normal employment, building databases on
the Space Station project. By preference, this evidence should be
documentary, of about equal validity to my own evidence. Lacking that, you
would have to make a VERY strong circumstantial case.

This is what I mean by the playing field not being level. There is good,
direct, documentary evidence that Shakespeare wrote the plays; it's not
perfect - certainly we wish that the Entertainment Tonight interviews had
not been lost - but it is exactly the kind of evidence we use to demonstrate
authorship for other Renaissance plays. In fact, as I said, it's more than
we have for many worthy playwrights of the day.

In the absence of documentary evidence contradicting the documentary record
(i.e., showing either that Shakespeare didn't write the plays, or that
someone else did), you are obliged to develop a very strong circumstantial
case. Two weak circumstantial cases (that maybe Shakespeare mightn't have
written the plays, and maybe Derby might have) don't really add up to one
strong one.

In fact - given the plethora of &quot;plausible&quot; alternate candidates - I think
it's incumbant on you to develop the case against Shakespeare first. In
other words, you could build a case I worked on the moon landing coverup,
but first we'd have to agree it's plausible the landings were faked.

(And it seems from the comment at the end of your posting, that we DO agree
on this; I'm shocked)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

You are absolutely right in one respect - I freely grant that an alternate
scenario would not have to include aspects of the traditional one - in fact,
that was partly the point of my post. Obviously I didn't state my case well
and I apologize. The author of the plays COULD have been an aristocrat
rather than a professional of the theater. As I said, Shakespeare was, from
the evidence of his writings, a unique genius; it is plausible from that
evidence that he could have overcome a number of handicaps, including an
aristocratic background. (You wondered about the origin of the statement
&quot;who's to say what he was not capable of&quot;; it was somewhere that damned
interminable &quot;Shake-scene&quot; thread - I was responding to Elizabeth Weir's
assertion that Shakespeare would not have been able to overcome a thick
Warwickshire accent.)

So, if Shakespeare were shown to be the Earl of Derby, I would be very
surprised, but I'd get over it, and start filling bookshelves with all sorts
of interesting new books on the True Author.

My problem is that, to date, I haven't heard either a strong case that
Shakespeare didn't write the plays (strong enough to overcome the evidence
of the published plays, testimonials, etc.), or an alternative scenario that
is even mildly compelling for an alternate candidate.

You begin badly. I know you didn't mean to offer, as evidence, the complete
lack of evidence, but it appears so. I will point out that I find it
completely implausible that EVERY trace of evidence - from records both
public and secret; from the memories of contemporaries; from private
diaries - was wiped out. I don't count it as impossible, since records from
the Renaissance are spotty, but highly improbable. Let us admit that it
could have happened, each adopt our own view on how likely it is, and move
on.

Actually, to earlier posts in this thread (as well as to a subthread under

arguments are neither specifically relevant to this converstation, nor
particularly strong in themselves. But see below.

&gt;&gt; sort of evidence, I should think you'd find it more persuasive.

&gt; You've lost me. I do not know what
&gt; you are talking about.

"/>

Again, I did not make my case well; my apologies. More matter and less art:

1) There is documentary evidence that Shakespeare wrote the plays.

2) There is no documentary evidence that he did not.

3) There is no documentary evidence that someone else did.

4) Therefore the case against Shakespeare and for alternate candidates is
composed of circumstantial, inferential evidence.

5) A circumstantial, inferential case can be made for Shakespeare which is
at least as strong as that for any alternate candidate.

Point 4 is the one everyone argues about, and why not? It's fun, and it has
the potential to sharpen our wits.

Points 1, 2, and 3 tend to get ignored, since they are pretty much
indisputable, but you should recognize that these are the ones that count
among academics (and me, too), particularly in conjunction with point 5.

On point 5 ... I have pointed out, in the threads I've been contributing
to, some circumstantial evidence and inference favoring Shakespeare- not
that my inconsequential little dribbles should be taken for any more than
they are: 1) in this thread, that a successful conspiracy would have been
virtually impossible given the number of people party to it; 2) in
&quot;Shake-scene&quot;, that there is internal evidence in the plays that the author
was a man of the theater.

(Thus, given points 4 and 5, my weak joke that you should be more
sympathetic to the circumstantial evidence I offer.)

If you are looking for a strong circumstantial case FOR Shakespeare, you
have only to look at the enormous volume of traditional biographies written
over the past four centuries (we'll except for purposes of this discussion
the wilder speculative ones).

They are all based on the same slim set of hard evidence, then take off from
there. They draw from tons of contemporary records about theater, politics,
social life, etc., to develop, overall, a very convincing circumstantial
case. If we did not have the hard evidence we have, I submit that they

the opportunity was taken to refurbish the
whole thing. Before this, there was a question

indeed 'CANST' as one might have expected.
A very clear illustration of what it looked like

It is just possible, I suppose, that the people
responsible for the refurbishment found it odd
to suggest that someone who was *already*
reading the epitaph would be unable to carry
on doing so. In this case they might have
thought it better to tell them to carry on if
they had already *begun* to read, which
'GANST' could (at a stretch) have meant.
It would be the 2nd person singular of the

No, I think you're confusing our worship of Shakespeare with the attitude of

Matus does (Shakespeare, In Fact) - he seems to have been popular at court,

&gt; No. It's FAR, FAR more than that. You

&gt; IF there had been those 25 actors, as well

&gt; or we have little or no evidence that there

&gt; public performances plus one sequence
&gt; (15 of 1Henry6) are recorded. Some of
&gt; those records are uncertain and may be
&gt; forged.

&gt; In any case, the canonical plays were, by
&gt; that time, quite old. The actors would not
&gt; have expected to meet the playwright, any
&gt; more than their 20th century equivalents
&gt; would have expected to meet, say, Arthur
&gt; Miller in the late 1980s.

"/>

My very quick response ....

There's a list of 26 guys (including &quot;William Shakespeare&quot;) who performed
&quot;principal&quot; roles in them, whenever they were performed, most of whom can be
associated in other ways with the Lord Chamberlain's Men/King's Men (e.g.,
incorporation papers, Jonson's cast lists).

They would only &quot;not have expected to meet the playwright&quot; if they knew that
the actor William Shakespeare they were performing with was not the writer.
I conclude therefore they must have been in on the conspiracy. (Now we know
what the 1,000 pounds per year was for! Payoffs!)

As for the dates: The plays were popular enough to encourage publication
and piracy into the teens (which is circumstantial, but adds plausibility).
The record of performances (which I don't have to hand, so I'll accept your
numbers) &quot;may be forged&quot;, but absent evidence of this, it's what we have to
go on. (Actually, I'll question your numbers ... just looked this up:
There were three independent references to the performance of Henry the
Eighth in 1613. Were these included in your numbers?)

(For the record, I think Miller's still kickin', but I get your point.)

the subject. A small percentage of the world believes that the publications
are hard evidence, a perhaps smaller percentage believes they aren't. There
is, in addition, a problem with calling the publications hard evidence.
Which publications do you mean? There are publications, for example, that
originally had the name Shakespeare or Shake-speare on them and are now
generally regarded as being by a different author or authors. That muddies
the water somewhat.

And by the way, what &quot;testimonials&quot; you are alluding to? I didn't know there

People who hold opinions that differ from yours, John, are merely
disagreeing with your theory of authorship. They are not lying, which I
believe takes a conscious effort to deceive.

We know one of his daughters, Susanna, could sign her name. She may have
been literate but I understand she couldn't tell her own husband's
handwriting. The other daughter, Judith, did indeed sign with a mark. I
would like to see the &quot;many examples of other people whom we know to have
been literate who used a mark.&quot; When I last asked this, I was given one
example of some school governors who signed with a mark once and on one
document when they appear to have been in a hurry. It stayed in my mind
because it happened in Ashby, very close to where I used to live. Here is
the post on the matter from Robert Stonehouse:

This comes up now and again, and there seems to be an idea around that
nobody ever used a mark if they could write. That is not so - there
could be other reasons to use a mark. I can produce an example.

Levi Fox, 'A Country Grammar School' (Oxford for the Governors of the
Foundation, Ashby-de-la-Zouch, 1967) reprints the school accounts,
which include the resolutions authorising some of the items. One of 30
April 1616 ends:

In witness whereof wee have set our handes to this note of
remembraunce the yeare and day above-written
Arth; Hildersam; Thomas Sherwood
Rob; Bainbrigg Rob; Clerk
Rob; Newton Will; Ash
Nich; Hasky John Ash

(The columns are neat, but may well lose their neatness in
transmission!)

Another of 17 September 1616 ends without the 'in witness' bit:

Arth; Hildersam Robert Clark
Robert Bainbrigg John Ash
Robert Newton William ^ Ashes mark
Nicholas Haskey Thomas &amp; Sherwoods mark

(The &amp; is only an approximation to the complicated squiggle Sherwood
used.)

Plainly William Ashe and Thomas Sherwood could write, but in the
second case the secretary had to go and find them and get them to sign
out of order (the signatures are usually in strict order of seniority)
perhaps at some time or place where it was not at all convenient (in
the street? at the cattle-market?). So very likely they here used
marks because it was so much quicker and easier. Evidently their marks
were known - this will not have been the only time they used them.

This is very interesting, but I would be pleased to see other examples.

OK, Greg, I'm waiting for the onslaught. Please do not ROAR again. I have a

This matter has been discussed countless times in this forum, and as
as Dave Kathman, among others, has pointed out, it is well known to
those who are well informed concerning the social history of the period
in question that persons known to be literate from surviving documents
in other contexts did sometimes sign with a mark.

For example, I reproduce an excerpt from one of Dave's posts
furnishing &quot;Dr.&quot; Faker with a few examples, besides the one already
mentioned by Robert Stonehouse:
--------------------------
Lots of people in late-sixteenth-century England signed things with
a mark even though they could write. John Shakespeare's friend
Adrian Quiney signed several extant documents with a mark, but
we have letters written in his hand. Christopher Marlowe's
father John signed at least one document, the same one that
contains Christopher's only surviving signature, yet he
signed his own will with a mark.
---------------------------
&lt;&gt;

It is also well known that school children at the time learned to read
before learning to write, so whether a person signed with a mark implies
nothing definitive about whether he or she could read. From another
post of Dave Kathman's:

--------------------------
Aaaarghhh. We had several interminable threads on this issue, and I'm
not going to go over it all again. But very briefly:

Yes, it's true that Shakespeare's father signed with a mark. This
means that he probably could not write, though it's impossible to
be sure; literate people sometimes still signed with a mark in those
days. However, signing with a mark says nothing about whether or
not he could read. David Cressy, who is probably the leading authority
on Elizabethan education, wrote the following (quoted by Schoenbaum
in *William Shakespeare: A Compact Documentary Life*, p.321):

&quot;All the evidence from Elizabethan educational records suggests that
children learned to write only aftere they had mastered the primary
skill of reading. Thus, it is not very surprising that many people
of humble education, including the likes of John Shakespeare, were
unable to write their names, even though they could probably read.
In most cases a mark signifies incomplete literacy, or illiteracy.
In the mid-seventeenth century, where there is good evidence, some
70% of all English men could not sign their names. Their sisters
and wives were much worse, about 90% illiterate. These figures
represent an improvement over the mid-Tudor period. William
Shakespeare's generation was much more literate than his father's.
The Elizabethan educational revolution bore fruit in improving
literacy among all social classes.&quot;

As Cressy notes, the second half of the sixteenth century was a
period of tremendously improved educational opportunities, and
their were many, many literate men with illiterate fathers. I
believe Richard Field's father was illiterate, and Richard could
certainly read very well indeed.

Now, as for Shakespeare's children. Hamnet died at the age of eleven,
and we have no evidence of his schooling or literacy. Judith,
it is true, signed with a mark, but Susannah was able to sign her
name in a very clear italic hand. This allows us to assume with
some degree of confidence that she was literate; certainly she would
have been able to read, at least. Judith may well have been able
to read as well, since as Cressy notes, reading was taught before
writing, and many marksmen (and markswomen) could read. To say
that Shakespeare's children were illiterate, as Oxfordians constantly
do, is just a shameless attempt to distort the facts out of all
touch with reality.
-------------------------------------------
&lt;&gt;

And elsewhere:
---------------------
I can and do deny such categorial statements. You once again
state the Oxfordian holy writ that Shakespeare's children
were illiterate, when in fact his daughter Susanna signed
her name in a clear italic hand and was almost certainly
literate. A signature is very strong evidence of literacy,
and in fact, a mark is no certain evidence of illiteracy.
As I've pointed out many times, some people (especially women)
signed documents with a mark even though they could sign
their name, and a significant portion of the people who
couldn't write could still read, because reading was
taught before writing and given a higher priority. I've
cited evidence to this effect from David Cressy, who spent
many years studying literacy in Elizabethan England and wrote
two books on the subject, but of course it has no effect
on Oxfordians. I continue to do so for the benefit of
any lurkers who are still reading this.
---------------------
&lt;&gt;

Given that only a mark from Judith survives, it seems reasonably
likely (in view of the low priority accorded the education of women at
the time) that Judith was unable to read, and more likely that she was
unable to write (since the former skill was taught before the latter),
but this is only conjecture -- the evidence is not sufficient to say
anything with confidence.

However, as Dave notes, nothing one can say is apt to deter some
anti-Stratfordians, who continue spinning comforting tales in their own
private fantasy lands, without the slightest regard for the evidence or
lack thereof. I still chuckle to recall Stephanie Caruana's confident
assurance that the dowager Countess of Oxford remarried hastily after
her husband's death. When Dave pointed out to her that the only actual
*evidence* for this supposedly &quot;hasty&quot; remarriage was a reference
showing that she was remarried *four years*(!) later, Stephanie --
undettered as alwways -- rejoined:

&quot;I have put the question out, and so far the closest thing to an
answer is that there is a letter from the Countess of Oxford dated
I believe some time in 1563, where she states something to the
effect that 'Mr. Tyrell is [or is not] going to London.' A case
might be made from the context of the letter (which I have not seen
or do not recall) that she is referring to her husband, since that
is a not uncommon way that wives referred to their husbands in
correspondence at that time.&quot;

(How the dowager Countess would have referred to Tyrell had she *not*
been married to him at the time Stephanie does not disclose.) This is a
priceless example of the genre of Oxfordian fantasizing, although it is
merely one of many.

Diana Price replies on her website:

The sample page of Hall's journal here shows that such an excuse is without
foundation. Readers can clearly make out names (&quot;Hall&quot; on the top line, &quot;Mrs
Herbert&quot; at the line marked by the marginal no. &quot;20&quot;, &quot;Maria Wilsune&quot; in the
first line of the final paragraph), and ailments (such as &quot;colica&quot; in the
second and final lines of Susanna's paragraph).

-------------------------------

But don't take Diana's word. People should examine the examples for
themselves at

and draw their own conclusions. Numerous well-informed people have also
suggested that it was unlikely she was literate. There are well-informed
people on both sides of the argument. I take no position on her literacy or
lack of it.

&gt;&gt; Sure. But the question is: &quot;Who was this

&gt;&gt; that a hyphenated name of that nature was
&gt;&gt; almost certainly invented. It is a multi-

&gt; Those fools would include, I presume, the government spies who managed to
&gt; obliterate every other piece of evidence, while leaving a big fat hint on
&gt; the title page of some of the most popular books of the Renaissance.

"/>

Yes. You're getting there. Remember that
the name of 'Will Shake-speare' only came
into use to any significant extent in 1598.
(It had appeared only on the long poems
in 1593/4 before then.) The Queen knew
her reign was approaching its end. Both
she and her poet had almost total contempt
for the intelligence and percipience of the
great masses, and especially that of the
barely literate middle-classes. By then
they knew that they could put out almost
anything and have it believed. The name
'Will Shake-speare' was, in itself, an
outrageous joke. Pretending that there
was a real author with such a name was
putting icing on an already monstrous cake.

There was very little in the way of 'every
other piece of evidence' that needed to be
obliterated. The poet had, since he was a
(highly precocious) child, maintained a
tight rein on his identity as a literary figure.
He had almost always worked under the
names of others, or under pure pseudonyms.
Few courtiers knew much about his work,
and hardly any knew about the full range
of his literary activities. Many probably
suspected much, but knew little.

I doubt if the Queen or her poet expected
his pseudonymity to last long. But it's hard
to tell. They could see that there were more
and more 'John-Knox' types around, who
hated everything of that nature, and would
never understand any of it. All they really
knew was that the principal facts could not
be made known, as such, around 1600, nor
for the immediately foreseeable future.
However, they made the nature of their
cover-up manifestly transparent to any
who had eyes to see. They were fully
aware that, outside the aristocracy, almost
no such people existed, and there weren't
that many inside it either.

&gt; [snip]

&gt;&gt;&gt; Couldn't be done. The 25 would have known, certainly; so would most of
&gt; the
&gt;&gt;&gt; bit players, ticket sellers, etc., as well as their wives, pals,
&gt; bartenders,
&gt;&gt;&gt; etc. It would have been a very poorly kept secret.

&gt;&gt; IF there had been those 25 actors, as well
&gt;&gt; as all the bit players, ticket-sellers, etc.,
&gt;&gt; then you'd have a case. But there wasn't --
&gt;&gt; or we have little or no evidence that there
&gt;&gt; was a company regularly performing the
&gt;&gt; canonical plays to public audiences from
&gt;&gt; the early or mid-1590s onwards. Only 7
&gt;&gt; public performances plus one sequence
&gt;&gt; (15 of 1Henry6) are recorded. Some of
&gt;&gt; those records are uncertain and may be
&gt;&gt; forged.

&gt;&gt; In any case, the canonical plays were, by
&gt;&gt; that time, quite old. The actors would not
&gt;&gt; have expected to meet the playwright, any
&gt;&gt; more than their 20th century equivalents
&gt;&gt; would have expected to meet, say, Arthur
&gt;&gt; Miller in the late 1980s.

&gt; My very quick response ....

&gt; There's a list of 26 guys (including &quot;William Shakespeare&quot;) who performed
&gt;&quot;principal&quot; roles in them, whenever they were performed, most of whom can be
&gt; associated in other ways with the Lord Chamberlain's Men/King's Men (e.g.,
&gt; incorporation papers, Jonson's cast lists).

"/>

That list is obviously fake. The actor at
the top of the list did not perform in any
significant role -- and no one claims that
he did.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; They would only &quot;not have expected to meet the playwright&quot; if they knew that
&gt; the actor William Shakespeare they were performing with

"/>

Nope -- all a con, or a joke. If anyone
in the theatre world happened to ask
Ben Jonson about who this 'Will
Shakespeare' was, he'd have told them
that it was just a printer's screw-up.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; As for the dates: The plays were popular enough to encourage publication
&gt; and piracy into the teens (which is circumstantial, but adds plausibility).

"/>

You mean the PRINTED COPIES were
popular enough to justify such piracy.
Actually the main fact that conveys
is that the printers knew no one would
be chasing them for their takings. No
other playwright (or other author of
any kind) was so pirated.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; The record of performances (which I don't have to hand, so I'll accept your
&gt; numbers) &quot;may be forged&quot;, but absent evidence of this, it's what we have to
&gt; go on. (Actually, I'll question your numbers ... just looked this up:
&gt; There were three independent references to the performance of Henry the
&gt; Eighth in 1613. Were these included in your numbers?)

"/>

The reason it is well recorded was
that the theatre burnt down during
a performance. But was it the
canonical play? No one knows.

(For the record, I think Miller's still kickin', but I get your point.)

That's nice to know

There

Well, if you don't agree they're hard evidence, will you at least agree
they're pretty spectacular circumstantial evidence? :)

I was calling them (for the moment, let's talk only of the canonical plays
and poems, Meres and the Folio testimonials) &quot;hard evidence&quot; to distinquish
them from &quot;circumstantial evidence&quot;, though. To call them hard evidence is
not to say the evidence is indisputably correct - even sworn testimony can
be wrong, or lies. I simply meant it is printed evidence that people have
put their name to which states directly that &quot;William Shakespeare&quot; wrote the
plays. (Probably lawyers have a proper term for this sort of evidence.)
Doesn't mean &quot;WS&quot; isn't a pseudonym, but it does mean you have to show me
that it is.

And your being mostly right doesn't change my opinion that Paul was wrong
simply to dismiss it at a figment of my imagination :)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; is, in addition, a problem with calling the publications hard evidence.
&gt; Which publications do you mean? There are publications, for example, that
&gt; originally had the name Shakespeare or Shake-speare on them and are now

Yeah, it does, although I think the apocrypha are pretty much a wash for
both sides. They exist, independent of the canonical plays attributions,
regardless of who did the writing. Doesn't make us think the canonicals
were mis-attributed in the same way, does it?

(Aside: I'm not ignoring the numerous references to &quot;Shake-speare&quot;. I
think it's fascinating. Was Will putting on airs? Was it a printer's error
that got propogated? I don't know, but I'm pretty sure it wasn't a
pseudonym.)

I was not commenting on the availability of evidence on the two men. I was
suggesting that your Bardolatry is a little out of line with reality.
Marlowe and Jonson were great playwrights. Shakespeare (the Writer) was
greater but not fifty times as great; as if we can quantify these things.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; In fact, as I said, it's more than

&gt;&gt;&gt; a) Shakespeare was not just a 'worthy playwright';
&gt;&gt;&gt; b) He leaves FAR more unanswered than does
&gt;&gt;&gt; any remotely comparable contemporary.

&gt;&gt; No, I think you're confusing our worship of Shakespeare with the
attitude of
&gt;&gt; his contemporaries.

&gt; This is a Strat (and academic) dodge --
&gt; they were all so stupid at the time that

Y'know, Paul, you have a tendency to rewrite my mildest comments into the
most extreme distortions; you have misunderstood so many simple declarative
sentences - and believe me, it is painful to me to write a simple
declarative sentence - that I can only assume you are doing it on purpose;
and you simply delete things you don't want to respond to. I don't have a
problem with the content you present, but my problems with your style have
become overwhelming. Frankly, it's no fun to argue with you, so I hope
you'll forgive me if I turn my attentions elsewhere. You may dance your
victory dance.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; In fact, the quality of his work was
&gt; recognised as soon as it was seen.
&gt; There was a famous debate in the rooms
&gt; of John Hales at Eton in (I think) the
&gt; 1630s, attended by John Suckling, Lord
&gt; Falkland, Roger Boyle and Thomas
&gt; Stanley, respecting the comparative
&gt; merits of Shakespeare and the classical
&gt; poets when the decision was given
&gt; unanimously in Shakespeare's favour.
&gt; (Gildon, Miscellany letters &amp; Essays,
&gt; 1694, pp 85-86)

&gt;&gt; I think he was more highly regarded than, say, Irvin
&gt;&gt; Matus does (Shakespeare, In Fact) - he seems to have been popular at
court,
&gt;&gt; and Jonson praises him to the skies when he isn't drubbing him. But
Jonson
&gt;&gt; himself was clearly more highly regarded then

&gt; More highly regarded than what?

&gt; [..]
&gt;&gt;&gt; in his town (including his wife, daughter,
&gt;&gt;&gt; son-in-law, and granddaughter) never
&gt;&gt;&gt; mention that he had been the poet, nor
&gt;&gt;&gt; that he had been a servant of the Royal
&gt;&gt;&gt; Household for two decades?

&gt;&gt; Well, the monument is a pretty significant statement, of course.

&gt; Except that it does not say anything
&gt; significant or sensible, and says that in
&gt; Latin.

&gt;&gt; Where else would we see these comments?

&gt; Why not on gravestones? -- Where the
&gt; highest compliments are (a) he was a gent,
&gt; and (b) he left his money to his daughters.
&gt; (These were the most significant facts to
&gt; his family, at a time when the poet was
&gt; being praised for out-shining ALL the
&gt; classical authors of antiquity.)

&gt;&gt; Do we have Dr. Hall's diaries?

&gt; We have his detailed casenotes. But Drayton
&gt; lived nearby, as did Leonard Digges. There
&gt; were numerous other literary people of the
&gt; highest standing living in the area or with
&gt; local connections, like, for example, Fulke
&gt; Greville.

&gt;&gt;&gt; [..]
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 1) There is documentary evidence that Shakespeare wrote the plays.

&gt;&gt;&gt; There is good evidence that the name the
&gt;&gt;&gt; playwright used was 'Will Shake-speare'.
&gt;&gt;&gt; There's almost nothing linking them to the
&gt;&gt;&gt; Stratman.

&gt;&gt; Other than his name, you mean?

&gt; The Stratman's name bears a similarity to
&gt; the pseudonym of the poet. That was the
&gt; main reason he was chosen for the role
&gt; of stooge.

&gt;&gt; (And, there is good evidence that the name the author, and everyone else
in
&gt;&gt; Renaissance England, used came in multiple spellings, including, rarely,
&gt;&gt; with hypens.)

&gt; No -- hardly anyone used hyphens -- certainly
&gt; there was no one else with a name following
&gt; the pattern auxiliary_verb / verb / noun.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 2) There is no documentary evidence that he did not.

&gt;&gt;&gt; There is masses. There are 70+ records from
&gt;&gt;&gt; his town. Not one even indicates that he
&gt;&gt;&gt; could write, let alone that he was a famous
&gt;&gt;&gt; poet and playwright. That would be a
&gt;&gt;&gt; total impossibility IF he had been what you
&gt;&gt;&gt; think he was.

&gt;&gt; Come, come. I allowed that a 100% coverup was not a total
impossibility.
&gt;&gt; Anything is possible.

&gt; I don't see what you are saying here.
&gt; Your position is that there was no cover-up.
&gt; That all was more-or-less as we should
&gt; expect to find it. Yet why is there not a
&gt; single record from Stratford indicating that
&gt; the local man was even literate?

&gt;&gt; I hate to pull this old chestnut out, but &quot;absence of evidence ...&quot;. Do
you
&gt;&gt; think people would have gone back to his birth records, highlighted them
in
&gt;&gt; yellow and added &quot;noted playwright&quot;?

&gt; Yes -- that's pretty much exactly what
&gt; would have happened. That and a lot
&gt; more.

&gt;&gt; Yikes, they put up a monument to him,
&gt;&gt; isn't that enough? And, in any case, ss I said above, I think you are
&gt;&gt; confusing our high regard of STW with what people thought of him in
those
&gt;&gt; days.

&gt; They carefully (and often) recorded that he
&gt; was a 'gent'. Somehow they forgot to note
&gt; that he had been a servant of the Royal
&gt; Household to two great monarchs for the
&gt; best part of twenty years.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 2) in &quot;Shake-scene&quot;, that there is internal evidence in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the plays that the author was a man of the theater.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Eh? What are you on about? The whole 'Shake-
&gt;&gt;&gt; scene' stuff is a mark of Stratfordian desperation
&gt;&gt;&gt; to find SOME . . . ANY evidence. And, in fact,
&gt;&gt;&gt; it is disastrous for the Strat case.

&gt;&gt; ... because ...?

&gt; It needs a separate post -- which maybe I'll get
&gt; around to soon.

&gt;&gt; (and please note that from my original post on, I have been at great
pains
&gt;&gt; to point out that the &quot;evidence&quot; I introduced was not strong in itself;
I
&gt;&gt; simply think it's as strong as the stuff I've seen for the alternate
&gt;&gt; candidates.)

&gt; Which is where you miss the point.
&gt; IF there was no cover-up and IF
&gt; everything was normal and above-
&gt; board (as you say it was), then there
&gt; should be masses of evidence for the
&gt; Stratman.

&gt;&gt; Well, I think E.K. Chambers &quot;Study of Facts and Problems&quot; is considered
the
&gt;&gt; definitive factual modern biography, although it's now very old (no, I
&gt;&gt; haven't read it). Schoenbaum's various &quot;Documentary Life&quot;s are good and
&gt;&gt; keep pretty strictly to the facts, as far as I can see.

&gt; Not true -- it's full of the wildest
&gt; speculation, made in the usual
&gt; casual, unthinking manner.

&gt;&gt; My point was that if you read these with a critical but unbiased eye,
you
&gt;&gt; will see that they build a plausible circumstantial case for SOS being
the
&gt;&gt; author.

&gt; Nonsense. There are no 'circumstances'
&gt; that support the Stratman -- on the contrary
&gt; -- it's this absence of 'circumstances' that is
&gt; the main basis of the doubt about his
&gt; authorship. Strats rely on what they call
&gt; 'direct evidence' and there is very, very
&gt; little of that.

&gt;&gt; You don't need to agree, although I think it would be polite if you
&gt;&gt; did, or at least substantiate your claim that there is &quot;not a single
one&quot;
&gt;&gt; which is not wildly speculative.

&gt; How can I substantiate a nothing?
&gt; You tell me which you think make up
&gt; the best 10 pages of the best Stratfordian
&gt; 'biography' and I'll show you how it
&gt; presents almost nothing other than
&gt; speculation.

&gt; [..]
&gt;&gt; Illiterate parents: Everyone had illiterate parents in those days.

&gt; Nonsense. Every significant writer of that
&gt; time (and of every time) was brought up
&gt; in a literate household.

&gt;&gt; SOS at
&gt;&gt; least had an ambitious father who put himself in a position to send his
boys
&gt;&gt; to school.

&gt; Sure --- the evidence for that is the 'fact' that
&gt; his son became the famous playwright. And
&gt; the evidence that he was the famous playwright
&gt; is that he had a father who sent him to school.
&gt; Welcome to the wonderful world of Strat
&gt; circularity.

&gt;&gt; That he may have been illiterate himself (I think there is
&gt;&gt; evidence in both directions, isn't there?

&gt; No. No one claims the father was literate.

&gt;&gt; Seems he might have been able to
&gt;&gt; read but perhaps never learned to form the letters himself?)

&gt; Not true. He was illiterate -- like the great
&gt; bulk of the rural population.

&gt;&gt; I find
&gt;&gt; interesting but ultimately irrelevant. SOS pretty certainly went to
school,

&gt; Oh yeah? And your evidence for that?

&gt;&gt; had neighbors who were literate,

&gt; This is scraping the bottom of the barrel.

&gt;&gt; moved in literate crowds in London (I don't
&gt;&gt; think he was taught his roles aloud).

&gt; How do you know he was in London for
&gt; more than a few brief visits?

&gt;&gt; He got a good grounding in some of
&gt;&gt; the material he later uses in his plays. Why is his father's literacy
an
&gt;&gt; issue?

&gt; Because the whole story is manifestly
&gt; nonsense.

&gt; Yup, I recall the phrase, now that you bring it up. Being of a somewhat

&gt; think I understand.

&gt;&gt;&gt; We will not agree on this issue, and I don't ask you to adopt my

&gt;&gt;&gt; I ask only that you try to see that the rest of the world regards the
&gt;&gt;&gt; publications and testimonials as hard evidence. If you wish to
convince
&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt;&gt; rest of the world of your argument, you must successfully counter it.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Saying it's a figment of my imagination doesn't help if it's a figment
&gt; of
&gt;&gt;&gt; EVERYONE's imagination. I know MY imagination is full of figments (I
&gt;&gt;&gt; strongly disagree with certain aspects of quantum theory!), but it's
not
&gt;&gt; my
&gt;&gt;&gt; imagination we're talking about.

&gt;&gt; I must protest here. I am part of &quot;the rest of the world.&quot; I do not
regard
&gt;&gt; the publications as hard evidence. Evidence of a kind, sure. But hard
&gt;&gt; evidence, no, not at all. In addition, I think you'll find that most of
&gt;&gt; those who comprise &quot;the rest of the world&quot; don't have much of an opinion
&gt; on
&gt;&gt; the subject. A small percentage of the world believes that the
&gt; publications
&gt;&gt; are hard evidence, a perhaps smaller percentage believes they aren't.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I think we can agree Shakespeare is heads and shoulders above his
&gt;&gt;&gt; contemporaries, but ... &quot;one-fiftieth&quot;? Marlowe?

&gt;&gt; Marlowe was killed at an early age (under highly
&gt;&gt; suspicious circumstances), and other aspects of
&gt;&gt; his life are very strange.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Jonson?

&gt;&gt; We know what Jonson had for breakfast
&gt;&gt; on most days (metaphorically speaking).
&gt;&gt; Everyone met him and knew him and many
&gt;&gt; left a record. That's strikingly different
&gt;&gt; from his supposed contemporary.

&gt; You trimmed out your part of the conversation which preceded this. I was
&gt; replying to your comment

&gt;&gt; On the contrary. There is no other playwright,
&gt;&gt; whose achievements were one-fiftieth of
&gt;&gt; Shakespeare's, about whom we can ask so
&gt;&gt; many questions -- and not get answers.

&gt; I was not commenting on the availability of evidence on the two men.

"/>

It's integral to the whole discussion.
The similarity Shakespeare's work to
Marlowe's is often mentioned. I think
that they came (substantially) from the
same hand -- and that is a large part of
the reason for the strangeness and
obscurity of his life as a playwright
and a poet.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I was
&gt; suggesting that your Bardolatry is a little out of line with reality.
&gt; Marlowe and Jonson were great playwrights. Shakespeare (the Writer) was
&gt; greater but not fifty times as great; as if we can quantify these things.

"/>

Insofar as we can quantify these things,
I'd suggest that fifty is far too low a
number.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; In fact, as I said, it's more than
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; we have for many worthy playwrights of the day.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a) Shakespeare was not just a 'worthy playwright';
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; b) He leaves FAR more unanswered than does
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; any remotely comparable contemporary.

&gt;&gt;&gt; No, I think you're confusing our worship of Shakespeare with the
&gt; attitude of
&gt;&gt;&gt; his contemporaries.

&gt;&gt; This is a Strat (and academic) dodge --
&gt;&gt; they were all so stupid at the time that
&gt;&gt; no one could recognise the quality of
&gt;&gt; his work.

&gt; Y'know, Paul, you have a tendency to rewrite my mildest comments into the
&gt; most extreme distortions;

"/>

Sorry, but I've been down this road so often that
I anticipate not merely your next move but about
the next three. It IS part of your stance that the
plays were astounding achievements -- but were
not seen as such by the people of his day, and
even not seen as such by the playwright himself.
Of course, such a stance can easily be shown
to be ridiculous -- as well as factually wrong.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Say you have this book in your hand, and you don't know who wrote it. You

that X wrote it? (With a grin, as always.)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; I was calling them (for the moment, let's talk only of the canonical
plays
&gt;&gt; and poems, Meres and the Folio testimonials) &quot;hard evidence&quot; to
&gt; distinquish
&gt;&gt; them from &quot;circumstantial evidence&quot;, though.

&gt; I understand. Meres is considered reasonable evidence, but most

is
&gt; talking about. The Folio is of course after the death of WS of Stratford,
&gt; but it's the best evidence there is for the Stratfordian case, together
with
&gt; the monument.

"/>

What I'm going to suggest is that you look at this evidence in isolation
from everything else we know and think we know. The Folio, at least, was
published with a prominent attribution by people who can be linked to
Shakespeare of Stratford (SOS) by documentary evidence of good legal
standing - the King's license, etc. Jonson certainly knew SOS, who was in
two of his plays, so his testimonial at least is a direct statement of
attribution by a contemporary acquaintance. Meres likely wouldn't have
known SOS, but his catalog is a direct attrribution. As far as I know,
there is no direct unequivocal evidence against these documents, and in
themselves they provide no evidence that SOS was not Shakespeare the Writer
(STW).

So, the point I have been trying to make (which is getting obscured by all
the other points I'm trying to make) is that, of all the stuff we talk
about, this is evidence of a different quality. It is not as strong as
questioning Ben Jonson in person, but it is a lot stronger than, say, &quot;SOS
was an actor in the company which performed the plays of STW&quot;.

You are, of course, at liberty to disbelieve the evidence on any basis you
wish, but to get ME to question it, I'll have to see some pretty strong
stuff. The only thing I've seen which has the potential to call the
canonical publications into question *directly* is the hyphenation of the
name (although I'll give some more thought to your comment below on the
apocrypha). Some pseudonyms had hyphens; so did some proper names. A wash.

(Asides: What's the anti-Stratfordian explanation for the hyphenated name
in the cast list of Sejanus? Why would any author want his name, or even
his pseudonym, associated with the 1603 Hamlet quarto?)

There is no reason not to question the &quot;hard&quot; evidence - perjured and
mistaken testimony is common. But I do think the higher quality of the hard
evidence calls for a high quality of contrary evidence. The major response
that I've seen so far has been simply &quot;It's falsified&quot;, but this only
carries weight if you already believe the alternate candidate's case. To
accept the alternate case, you have to accept at least one of the two
strands of circumstantial evidence - that SOS could not have been STW, or
that the alternate candidate was clearly STW. (Re-reading, I see I haven't
dealt with the second strand at all; you'll be grateful to know that I'm
getting late for work, so I'll just say &quot;same as I said for the first
strand&quot;. Hard to believe I re-read this stuff before I send it, isn't it?)

I'm generally familiar with the case against SOS, and I find it
unpersuasive. Surely there are gaps in his biography, and there are some
items which call out for explanation. But explanations are available. They
are invariably &quot;circumstantial&quot; - we've already exhausted the hard evidence
above - but they seem to me to be at least as strong, and frequently
stronger, than the counter-case.

(I don't know how you feel about this issue; I'm not attributing any of the
following arguments to you.)

For example, an anti-Stratfordian might say &quot;SOS was uneducated&quot; (this is
circumstantial evidence; there is no RECORD of his having been educated).
The pro-Stratfordian will say &quot;He probably was educated&quot; (again,
circumstantial; the records for Stratford's school are not extant, so no
record could exist; John Shakespeare was in a position to send his boys to
school and seems like the kind of ambitious guy who would make sure they
did). For argument's sake we can call this a wash. Now we can bring in
&quot;tertiary&quot; evidence (&quot;SOS's daughters were illiterate&quot;&quot;No, they weren't&quot;).
At some point, we have to weigh the quality and quantity of the
circumstantial evidence on both sides and come to a conclusion, which will,
undoubtedly, be colored by our own prejudices.

I argue that what we know about theater and society in Renaissance England,
the spotty record-keeping, SOS's life, etc., etc., add up to a good
circumstantial case, consistent in itself, that SOS was STW. To my mind, it
is factually stronger and has the added benefit of &quot;feeling&quot; right to me.
You will disagree, but I hope you will see that it's not insane to hold my
position. Since reasonable people on both sides feel their circumstantial
cases are stronger, for the sake of argument, and only temporarily, let's
call them equal.

That leaves us with the hard evidence, and I submit that you must come up
with something better than &quot;my circumstantial case is stronger than yours,
so the hard evidence is obviously falsified&quot;. You should either discredit
the hard evidence directly, or build a circumstantial case so overwhelming
that the hard evidence cannot stand against it.

I think this is *possible*. The hard evidence about Marlowe's death is very
strong - coroner's report, sworn testimony, etc. - but I feel a sufficiently
strong case has been made that his death was suspicious, so I'm prepared to
believe he was murdered. I am intrigued, but not persuaded, by the
speculative theories about the reason for it.

But I simply don't think this strong a case has been made by the
anti-Stratfordians. (Or is it non-Stratfordians? What's the preferred
term?)

No, I would agree Meres probably didn't know SOS, from the context. There
is argument, I believe, that he was simply parroting someone else anyway.
So you're right; it would be even more convincing if it had been someone who
knew him. This is why I find Jonson's writings convincing - he clearly knew
him, and the quality of the material has the feel of reality, doesn't it?
He even took out time in his eulogy to slam him.

I've never been too clear on the &quot;during his lifetime&quot; issue. Do we have a
lot of &quot;living testimonials&quot; for others?

Professor Stritmatter and I responded in detail to the essay by Dr Kathman
and Mr. Reedy on this subject. You might like to read it. It should be in
the archives here. I would also suggest that there are two separate
questions with regard to authorship:

1) Did WS of Stratford write the canon?
2) If he didn't, who did?

I don't believe that we must know the answer to the second question to
respond &quot;no&quot; to the first. I say &quot;no&quot; to the first because I don't believe
that WS of Stratford could have had the right education, and because what we
know of him appears to me to be out of sync with the plays and sonnets. My
best guess is that Oxford was the author of the canon, particularly if he
wrote &quot;Women&quot; and &quot;My Mind To Me A Kingdom Is,&quot; and particularly because of
a few lines in the sonnets, but I don't live or die on that attribution.

to
&gt; believe he was murdered. I am intrigued, but not persuaded, by the

&gt;&gt;&gt; We know one of his daughters, Susanna, could sign her name. She may have

&gt;&gt; As numerous well-informed people have pointed out countless times,
&gt;&gt; the text in question was written in what amounted to a medical Latin
&gt;&gt; shorthand. From one of Dave Kathman's earlier posts:
&gt;&gt; ---------------------------
&gt;&gt; As I pointed out, the notes in question are written in an extremely
&gt;&gt; abbreviated form of medical Latin which is hard to decipher, almost
&gt;&gt; a kind of code. I can easily imagine Susanna not being familiar
&gt;&gt; with this special form of her husband's writing.

&gt; Diana Price replies on her website:

&gt; The sample page of Hall's journal here shows that such an excuse is without
&gt; foundation. Readers can clearly make out names (&quot;Hall&quot; on the top line, &quot;Mrs
&gt; Herbert&quot; at the line marked by the marginal no. &quot;20&quot;, &quot;Maria Wilsune&quot; in the
&gt; first line of the final paragraph), and ailments (such as &quot;colica&quot; in the
&gt; second and final lines of Susanna's paragraph).

From an old post I wrote in response to Pat Dooley:

--- start extract ---

James Cooke isn't too likely to have shown Susanna page 17. A fairer
test would have been a look at the manuscript cover or perhaps, the
first page. Maybe it clearly says on the cover, &quot;By Me, John Hall.&quot;

Taking Cooke's preface at face value, it seems likely that Susanna
believed the manuscript had been written by the man who practiced physic
with her husband. Even if she saw and recognized names and illnesses,
she could still have very easily believed that the book had been written
by the apothecary who worked with her husband.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; But don't take Diana's word. People should examine the examples for
&gt; themselves at

Obviously, Honan did not say that he thinks that Susanna was
probably illiterate.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Halliwell-Phillips: &quot;It is very possible, however, that the

- Another extract from an HLAS post I wrote -

Elizabethan literacy is a topic much better understood today than it
was some eighty or so years ago. I contacted Dr. David Cressy, (author of
_Education in Tudor and Stuart England_ and _Literacy and the Social Order
in Tudor &amp; Stuart England_) asked him what his opinion was about Susanna's
signature.

Cressy told me that he thinks that most of the women of Susanna's period
and status who could write their names were probably able to read. He also
said that most of them had few occasions to write, but that if they could
do as much as write their name, they could probably compose other words.

--- end extract ---

FWIW, Cressy seems to be a very reputable authority.

&lt;snip&gt;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; There were likely people taught to sign their names who could neither read

Yes. Some such may have existed. (As far as we know, the
percentage of the population that fell into that category
was very close to zero.)

IF that were the case, it would be very

printed in the same volumes as the name
'Shake-speare' and show how often they
appear with hyphens. The only ones
with them are made-up names, such as

'Will Shake-speare&quot; is so manifestly a

(quote)
From the introduction to the current 'Concise Oxford Dictionary':

Noun compounds: there are no hard-and-fast rules to determine the use
of one-word, two-word, or hyphenated forms (except when used to show
grammatical function: see below)... The evidence of modern English
indicates a tendency towards avoiding hyphenation in general, showing
a preference for 'airstream' rather than 'air-stream' and for 'air
raid' rather than 'air-raid'. There is an additional tendency for the
form to be one word in US English and two words in British English.

Grammatical function: ... When a noun compound made up of two separate
words (e.g. 'credit card') is placed before another noun and used to
modify it, the general rule is that the noun compound becomes
hyphenated, e.g. 'I used my credit card' but 'credit-card debt'. A
similar alternation is found in compound adjectives... 'he is not well
known' but 'a well-known painter'. A general rule governing verb
compounds means that, when a noun compound is two words (e.g. 'beta
test'), any verb derived from it is normally hyphenated ('to
beta-test').

Some other specific standardized uses of hyphens are discussed on the
Ask Oxford website at

Forms which are usually hyphenated include compound nouns and
adjectives formed with verbal participles ('weight-carrying',
'shark-fishing') unless they become so fixed as to become firmly
established as single words ('weightlifting'). One-word forms are
avoided if visual confusion might result ('hang-gliding', or possibly
'hang gliding', but never 'hanggliding').

As we all know, the use of that name
became highly controversial (a matter in

adopting the line (at some level -- maybe

Thanks for your support. As you imply,
it's possible to present an entirely false
picture of Elizabethan typography by
means of a few examples picked out from
the whole body of the literature of the
day. (That is especially the case when the
'picking' is done in a tendentious manner,
with names been taken from their use in
masques, or in humorous poems, or
from other occasions where the original
authors were very likely indulging in the
usual Elizabethan wordplay.)

Luckily we all now have ready access to
Elizabethan texts in their original form,
and can do computer searches, and no
longer have to depend on the 'scholars'
for their 'expert' assessments.

However, my main concern was to show
that John's statement was nonsense:

The insertion of a hyphen in a name like
'Shakespeare' was extremely unusual.
It would be easy enough to do a statistical
investigation, but without that, I'd reckon
that it happened less than one in 100 times.
What would your estimate be?

So, yet again, we have a large figure of
probability against the possibility that
the Stratford story is true. It happens
so often that you must get bored.

Still, how can mere facts have any
relevance in matters of religious belief?

&gt; (quote)
&gt; From the introduction to the current 'Concise Oxford Dictionary':

&gt; Noun compounds: there are no hard-and-fast rules to determine the use
&gt; of one-word, two-word, or hyphenated forms (except when used to show
&gt; grammatical function: see below)... The evidence of modern English
&gt; indicates a tendency towards avoiding hyphenation in general, showing
&gt; a preference for 'airstream' rather than 'air-stream' and for 'air
&gt; raid' rather than 'air-raid'. There is an additional tendency for the
&gt; form to be one word in US English and two words in British English.

&gt; Grammatical function: ... When a noun compound made up of two separate
&gt; words (e.g. 'credit card') is placed before another noun and used to
&gt; modify it, the general rule is that the noun compound becomes
&gt; hyphenated, e.g. 'I used my credit card' but 'credit-card debt'. A
&gt; similar alternation is found in compound adjectives... 'he is not well
&gt; known' but 'a well-known painter'. A general rule governing verb
&gt; compounds means that, when a noun compound is two words (e.g. 'beta
&gt; test'), any verb derived from it is normally hyphenated ('to
&gt; beta-test').

&gt; Some other specific standardized uses of hyphens are discussed on the
&gt; Ask Oxford website at

&gt; http://www.askoxford.com/asktheexperts/faq/aboutspelling/hyphen

&gt; Forms which are usually hyphenated include compound nouns and
&gt; adjectives formed with verbal participles ('weight-carrying',
&gt; 'shark-fishing') unless they become so fixed as to become firmly
&gt; established as single words ('weightlifting'). One-word forms are
&gt; avoided if visual confusion might result ('hang-gliding', or possibly
&gt; 'hang gliding', but never 'hanggliding').

"/>

Thanks. Clearly the basic rules have
changed little in four hundred years.

So we would never write &quot;Will Shake speare&quot;;
And while &quot;Will Shakespeare&quot; is acceptable,
it looks a little too much like a regular name
(although no one with a scrap of sense
would believe it was actually the name of a
real person . . . . would they?)

&quot;Will Shake-speare&quot; though is about right.
It conveys just what it should convey.

A good point. But ...

1) Accidentally picking the name of an implausible boob seems unlikely.
There was opportunity to correct the error by simply choosing a different

2) Deliberately choosing someone of the same name (particularly if he was
implausible) as a front brings in all the conspiracy issues I have a very

Others have referred to Kathman's essay

it, because while I was not losing sleep over the hyphen, I did find it an
intriguing piece of evidence. I still do - I think that if the rest of the
case against Shakespeare of Stratford or for an alternate candidate were
stronger, it could be brought in as supporting evidence. I think, however,
that Kathman's essay gives me the ground to say the hyphen does not cry out
for explanation. It was normal, if unusual - to hyphenate a &quot;compound&quot; name
in Renaissance England.

&gt; I have no idea whether he went to Grammar School. I do feel that a grammar

&gt; I agree; however, I have seen much material that suggests that the author
of
&gt; the canon needed far more than a grammar school education; that he must at
&gt; the very least have been able to speak some Greek and was well versed in
&gt; Legal French. The issue of WS's daughters' literacy is interesting, as
&gt; Shakespeare wrote such strong women into his plays, but of course not
&gt; conclusive with regard to authorship.

"/>

My introduction to Shakespeare's biography was primarily through
introductory material in various editions of the plays, lately the Ardens.
It was, I guess you would say, an extended literary biography. It was only
recently that I took a greater interest in the authorship debate. What I
found in reading those intros was a completely consistent story of how
Shakespeare of Stratford (SOS) COULD have written the plays, although I
didn't think of it that way at the time. In retrospect, it is the sound
circumstantial case I have been referring to. I don't think those intros
answered every question to my satisfaction. For example, I find the
attribution of a few of the sources based on a few similar phrases or a
small collection of common facts to be plausible but &quot;not proved&quot;.

(This is why I find some of the non-Shakespearean arguments - like &quot;Oxford
travelled in Italy&quot; - unconvincing in isolation; it's information SOS could
have picked up in a bar - or from Oxford. The cumulative effect of many of
these arguments *could* be convincing, although I haven't found it so to
date. I'll check out your site, particularly on the Greek and Law French
you mention, and get back to you )

But I did come away with the feeling that, even if the specific source is
unknown, it was likely that SOME source - lost plays, etc. - could explain
difficult-to-get knowledge. It's not evidence, certainly not hard evidence.
Just a recognition that the author was a guy who seemed to absorb
information about the world from everywhere. This includes includes some
sources - the lower classes - that I think an aristocrat wouldn't have much
contact with; he seems to know more about kitchens and gardening than I
would expect, for example. It's not that an aristocrat COULDN'T have known
this - &quot;who's to say what he was not capable of&quot; - just that I find it
plausible he could have been a middlin' educated kid from the middle
classes.

earlier part of this dialog). Can anyone point me to references? (The
suggestion was that the aprocrypha might represent Shakespeare of Stratford
trying to take credit for plays he didn't write.)

&gt;&gt; I'm generally familiar with the case against SOS, and I find it
&gt;&gt; unpersuasive.

&gt; I'm not sure what &quot;generally familiar&quot; means. Have you, for example, read
&gt; books on Oxford or other candidates, or against WS of Stratford? Or does
&gt;&quot;generally familiar&quot; mean you have read what other traditionalists have

Guilty.

I've read a few traditional biographies, but as I said elsewhere, much of my
biographical background comes from play intros, which naturally fixate on
the text; and from a few books of criticism, likewise text-oriented. Like
most people, I had a passing acquaintance with the authorship question, but
didn't pursue it.

My formal introduction to the authorship question was, I think, when I
picked up a cheap copy of H. N. Gibson's &quot;Shakespeare Claimants&quot; several
years ago. I found his growing exasperation with the non-Shakespeareans
amusing, and thought his arguments were (mostly) cogent. I also picked up a
used copy of Milward Martin's &quot;Was Shakespeare Shakespeare?&quot;; found him a
little too polemical for my taste, but cogent.

Then a couple years ago I picked up Diana Price's &quot;Shakespeare's Unorthodox
Biography&quot;. My bookmark is on page 62. I set it down one day and never
found reason to go back. I felt she was intellectually dishonest in
rehearsing old arguments without dealing explicitly with the responses that
have already been made to them; I also felt she was &quot;shading&quot; arguments
subtly - rather than more explicitly, like Gibson and Milward. It is
certainly unfair to have made this judgement on the basis of 62 pages, and
my judgement was certainly colored by my natural distaste for conspiracy
theory, but that's how it worked.

Although I find the argument in HLAS a little too angry for my taste, at
least it comes in smaller doses. I also like the fact that it allows for
reasonably complete give-and-take. No need to write furious notes in the
margin and get no response.

More recently, I've gone through Kathman and Reedy's web page fairly
thoroughly, and just finished Irvin Matus's &quot;Shakespeare, In Fact&quot;.

So I'll make you a deal. If you can recommend a good non-Stratfordian
starter book, I'll make an earnest effort to read it. If it's portable
enough, I'll even carry it around the Stratford Festival next week on my
return visit and see if I can raise any hackles.

I would say the two easiest and most portable (Oxfordian) starter books are
Richard Whalen's _Shakespeare--Who Was He?_ ,and though I hate to mention
it, Sobran's _Alias Shakespeare_. There is also a little young adult novel
you might like to pick up, _A Question of Will_. If you're in Stratford, I
believe the guys at Fundamentals still have a copy or two, but I'm not sure.
They certainly have some of Kositsky's other books. ;)

Best wishes,
Lynne

"/>

I've read all your posts of the last week or so, and it's obvious you mean
business, and like to do things thoroughly. So that's why I'm making a
lengthy response.

From what I've read it looks to me that you're as close to my position on
the authorship question as makes no difference - and I'm a
&quot;near-Stratfordian&quot;. I find the whole body of evidence for William (if
you're looking for a non-combative name, and dislike the anti-Strats'
&quot;Shaksper&quot;) to be a bit worrisome in the sense of being more skeletal than
it ought to be. But internally it holds up fairly well, and shows no signs
of any kind of put-up job. (Incidentally, I should point out to you what
some of your other posts suggest you do not know - namely, that all
anti-Strat theories, whatever candidate is being promoted, are based on
conspiracy. There are none based on accidental misattribution or anything of
that nature.)

Although it's of some interest to engage in newsgroup controversies, either
here or at the Shakespeare Fellowship, it's of limited value in terms of
learning anything. To get a grasp of anti-Strat theories, you have to read
the books. Those who write them are forced at least to try to make their
arguments cohere, so obviously it's where the contradictions come to light.
An example would be where Diana Price in one part of her book is trying to
make a case that the relationship between William and the Players had ended
in acrimony some time before 1610, owing to William's &quot;theft&quot; of plays,
costumes, etc - indeed her interpretation of the John Davies epigram of 1610
depends upon it. That's all very well, but obviously we are interested to
see how she will deal with the First Folio later on in the book, and with
Jonson's De Shakespeare Nostrati. Lines like &quot;I remember, the Players have
often mentioned it as an honour to Shakespeare,&quot; would be something of an
embarassment to any theory that previously promoted the idea that William
had been sent packing by the Players. It gets worse when Jonson says things
like &quot;...who choose that circumstance to commend their friend by, wherein he
most faulted&quot;. Had the Players kissed and made up with the Stratford
Sharper? She doesn't say.

But note it. It's the necessity of holding down contradictory theories,
which is bound to happen in a book-length polemic, that brings to light the
kind of scholarship that you've already called &quot;intellectually dishonest&quot;.
Stay alert and you'll find many more examples. On a newsgroup, you get
arguments about bits and pieces, never a theory that tries to cover the
whole case. And there are some Oxfordians who you might even suspect of
making a speciality of not covering the whole case. If you're going across
to the Shakespeare Fellowship, watch out for the pick-and-choose tacticians.
Yes, they've read Ogburn, but they do not necessarily agree with everything
in it, or in Price, or in Whalen, or in Sobran, as they are quick to tell
you, but they can make a big argument about this thing or that thing. It
makes them very difficult to pin down. A month later you might find them
arguing some point that is dependent on assumptions that are in complete
contradiction to the assumptions needed for the point they are making now.
How will you remember?

No, you've got to go for the books. And focus on the Oxfordians, not because
they have the best case (which they haven't), but because they have the most
popular candidate. Oxfordian books are written by the best Oxfordians, and
I do not mean best in the sense of having necessarily the most compelling
arguments, but the best in the sense of being able to string sentences and
paragraphs into a comprehensible polemic - which obviously saves you time.
You've already reached p 62 on Price's book, so I'd recommend keeping on
with that all the way to the end. Although she doesn't identify herself as
an Oxfordian, I suspect that she is. I would guess that her book is the
first of a projected pair, the first having the objective of demolishing
&quot;Shaksper's&quot; claims, and the second replacing him with Oxford. At the moment
she has the biggest reputation in the anti-Strat world, though I'm not quite
sure why. The general opinion is that her book is very well written, but it
didn't impress me in those terms. In fact, I found some parts of it clumsy
and amateurish. Sobran's Alias Shakespeare is more readable, slicker, and
has a tone that is more agreeable. Sobran is a bit unusual in not apparently
suffering from William-hatred, a disease that has both Price and Ogburn in a
continual fever. Their compulsive sniping at &quot;Shaksper&quot; becomes really
tiresome after a while, because it doesn't actually help their case, and
just makes you wonder about their psychological health. Sobran has nothing
against William as such, and doesn't try to belittle him at every turn. He
just doesn't think he's the author, that's all. But he writes better than
Price.

And so too, surprisingly, does Ogburn. He's the crankiest of them, but you
can forgive him quite a lot because it's obvious that it's been a lifetime's
work for him, and that his passion for Shakespeare and for English history
is genuine. In some places he's actually pretty good, especially when Oxford
is kept out of it. The Armada crisis is one example, where he builds quite
a vivid narrative. Also good on hawking, which is one of his own personal
interests.

But - important point - when reading the Oxfordians, you cannot take
anything on trust. However factual some fact appears to be, you must have
the means of checking. So keep at at least some Strat books close to hand.
If you can get it, E.K Chambers' Facts and Problems. He is the most
comprehensive cataloguer of the factual material, and also the most honest,
in my opinion.

Judging from what you've written so far, I wouldn't say that there is much
hope of your being swayed by anti-Strat theories. Someday someone will do a
study of anti-Stratfordianism as a phenomenon, or I hope they will, but I
would say that there is a certain percentage of people disposed by nature to
be attracted to it. If you are not one of those, and I don't think you are,
the final effect of all your reading will be nil.

What does that mean?
You have a good theory for the sonnets?
You know who the 'Fair Youth' was?
You know who the 'Rival Poets' were?
You can explain the 'vastly over-written' nature
of the plays -- how they are FAR above the level
of their supposed audiences . . .?
You can explain the non-commercial nature of many
of the plays -- (to whom was Measure for Measure
or Timon of Athens supposed to appeal) . . ?
You can explain the extreme bawdy of speeches
like the 'riding on the balls of mine' (in MoV) . . ?
You can explain the 'mistakes' . . the clocks in Rome . .?
You can explain how the playwright dealt with the
topics of enormous political sensitivity . . . yet was

Good point. I assumed Mark had got this, but

Fantasy. The great bulk of such books have
numerous contradictions and inconsistencies
(of which, about ~99% of the time, the author
is quite unaware). Of course, they are usually
far superior to Stratfordian books on Shake-
speare, where you'd be lucky to find two
consistent consecutive sentences.

This kind of forum is vastly better for
exposing inconsistencies. You can ask
questions, and see when you don't get
answers -- which, from Strats, is ALL
the time.

All Oxfordians are still, to a large extent,
quasi-Strat (and some very much so) in
that they have not got anywhere near an
internally-consistent or even a moderately
clear position. These things take time --
a lot of time. Stratfordian assumptions
pervade their work. They are like Galileo,
assuming (for no good reason) that the
planets must move in perfect circles, and
then finding that the observations don't
match.

Diana Price does not even claim to be
Oxfordian. In all the above, she has IMO
adopted wholly Stratfordian assumptions.

a complete mess.

Sure -- they know (if they have any honesty)
that they don't have all the answers. Nearly
all Oxfordians still go for the 'Fair Youth'
nonsense. That can only leave an adherent

become so for entirely the wrong reasons --
such as wholly mistaken conceptions of

Unfortunately, that applies to the whole of

Oddly enough, I find myself in agreement with Paul Crowley here. My style,

&gt;&gt;&gt; on the subject?

&gt;&gt; Guilty.

&gt;&gt; I've read a few traditional biographies, but as I said elsewhere, much of
&gt; my
&gt;&gt; biographical background comes from play intros, which naturally fixate on
&gt;&gt; the text; and from a few books of criticism, likewise text-oriented. Like
&gt;&gt; most people, I had a passing acquaintance with the authorship question,
&gt; but
&gt;&gt; didn't pursue it.

&gt;&gt; My formal introduction to the authorship question was, I think, when I
&gt;&gt; picked up a cheap copy of H. N. Gibson's &quot;Shakespeare Claimants&quot; several
&gt;&gt; years ago. I found his growing exasperation with the non-Shakespeareans
&gt;&gt; amusing, and thought his arguments were (mostly) cogent. I also picked up
&gt; a
&gt;&gt; used copy of Milward Martin's &quot;Was Shakespeare Shakespeare?&quot;; found him a
&gt;&gt; little too polemical for my taste, but cogent.

If you have read Gibson you know that he at least has the honesty
to admit,as did a few other intellectually honest Stratfordians before
him ,that both Joseph Hall and John Marston regarded Shakespeare as a
pseudonym by l598 to l599.Gibbes does not believe what they said ,very
good.But he does believe that they said it.
If Gibson had read a little further than he seems ever to have
done,he would have found that Stratfordian Richard Simpson writing in
the early l870's likewise found that Robert Greene did not believe (in
l587) the recent putative authorship claims being advanced on behalf
of William Shakspere.Simpson spent many long hours trying to prove
that William Shakspere did write that play,Faire Em,but failed to
convince anyone except Peter Farey and one other Marlovian who
preceeded him.Still Simpson had the intellectual honesty to admit that
Greene continued to state(however much Simpson disbelived him) the
William Shakspere was a front man for the rest of Greene's short life.
If Milward Martin's arguments seem cogent,he does not deserve the
credit,The book was ghost-written by an old acquaintance of mine,first
name Sheppard,who frequented the circles of that multi-talented New
York writer Ree Dragonette.If the Stratfordians were unable to fathom
an authorship hoax going on under their noses on behalf of one of
their own,how much less are they qualified to judge the credibility of
witnesses who wrote four hundred years ago and whose evidence they
almost invariably ignore?
If I had more time I would (may) comment further.
Diana Price made no errors on the points cited here. She just can
read better and reads a lot more Elizabethan documents than most
people writing here.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; Then a couple years ago I picked up Diana Price's &quot;Shakespeare's
&gt; Unorthodox
&gt;&gt; Biography&quot;. My bookmark is on page 62. I set it down one day and never
&gt;&gt; found reason to go back. I felt she was intellectually dishonest in
&gt;&gt; rehearsing old arguments without dealing explicitly with the responses
&gt; that
&gt;&gt; have already been made to them; I also felt she was &quot;shading&quot; arguments
&gt;&gt; subtly - rather than more explicitly, like Gibson and Milward. It is
&gt;&gt; certainly unfair to have made this judgement on the basis of 62 pages, and
&gt;&gt; my judgement was certainly colored by my natural distaste for conspiracy
&gt;&gt; theory, but that's how it worked.

&gt;&gt; Although I find the argument in HLAS a little too angry for my taste, at
&gt;&gt; least it comes in smaller doses. I also like the fact that it allows for
&gt;&gt; reasonably complete give-and-take. No need to write furious notes in the
&gt;&gt; margin and get no response.

&gt;&gt; More recently, I've gone through Kathman and Reedy's web page fairly
&gt;&gt; thoroughly, and just finished Irvin Matus's &quot;Shakespeare, In Fact&quot;.

&gt;&gt; So I'll make you a deal. If you can recommend a good non-Stratfordian
&gt;&gt; starter book, I'll make an earnest effort to read it. If it's portable
&gt;&gt; enough, I'll even carry it around the Stratford Festival next week on my
&gt;&gt; return visit and see if I can raise any hackles.

&gt; I've read all your posts of the last week or so, and it's obvious you mean
&gt; business, and like to do things thoroughly. So that's why I'm making a
&gt; lengthy response.

&gt; From what I've read it looks to me that you're as close to my position on
&gt; the authorship question as makes no difference - and I'm a
&gt;&quot;near-Stratfordian&quot;. I find the whole body of evidence for William (if
&gt; you're looking for a non-combative name, and dislike the anti-Strats'
&gt;&quot;Shaksper&quot;) to be a bit worrisome in the sense of being more skeletal than
&gt; it ought to be. But internally it holds up fairly well, and shows no signs
&gt; of any kind of put-up job. (Incidentally, I should point out to you what
&gt; some of your other posts suggest you do not know - namely, that all
&gt; anti-Strat theories, whatever candidate is being promoted, are based on
&gt; conspiracy. There are none based on accidental misattribution or anything of
&gt; that nature.)

&gt; Although it's of some interest to engage in newsgroup controversies, either
&gt; here or at the Shakespeare Fellowship, it's of limited value in terms of
&gt; learning anything. To get a grasp of anti-Strat theories, you have to read
&gt; the books. Those who write them are forced at least to try to make their
&gt; arguments cohere, so obviously it's where the contradictions come to light.
&gt; An example would be where Diana Price in one part of her book is trying to
&gt; make a case that the relationship between William and the Players had ended
&gt; in acrimony some time before 1610, owing to William's &quot;theft&quot; of plays,
&gt; costumes, etc - indeed her interpretation of the John Davies epigram of 1610
&gt; depends upon it. That's all very well, but obviously we are interested to
&gt; see how she will deal with the First Folio later on in the book, and with
&gt; Jonson's De Shakespeare Nostrati. Lines like &quot;I remember, the Players have
&gt; often mentioned it as an honour to Shakespeare,&quot; would be something of an
&gt; embarassment to any theory that previously promoted the idea that William
&gt; had been sent packing by the Players. It gets worse when Jonson says things
&gt; like &quot;...who choose that circumstance to commend their friend by, wherein he
&gt; most faulted&quot;. Had the Players kissed and made up with the Stratford
&gt; Sharper? She doesn't say.

&gt; But note it. It's the necessity of holding down contradictory theories,
&gt; which is bound to happen in a book-length polemic, that brings to light the
&gt; kind of scholarship that you've already called &quot;intellectually dishonest&quot;.
&gt; Stay alert and you'll find many more examples. On a newsgroup, you get
&gt; arguments about bits and pieces, never a theory that tries to cover the
&gt; whole case. And there are some Oxfordians who you might even suspect of
&gt; making a speciality of not covering the whole case. If you're going across
&gt; to the Shakespeare Fellowship, watch out for the pick-and-choose tacticians.
&gt; Yes, they've read Ogburn, but they do not necessarily agree with everything
&gt; in it, or in Price, or in Whalen, or in Sobran, as they are quick to tell
&gt; you, but they can make a big argument about this thing or that thing. It
&gt; makes them very difficult to pin down. A month later you might find them
&gt; arguing some point that is dependent on assumptions that are in complete
&gt; contradiction to the assumptions needed for the point they are making now.
&gt; How will you remember?

&gt; No, you've got to go for the books. And focus on the Oxfordians, not because
&gt; they have the best case (which they haven't), but because they have the most
&gt; popular candidate. Oxfordian books are written by the best Oxfordians, and
&gt; I do not mean best in the sense of having necessarily the most compelling
&gt; arguments, but the best in the sense of being able to string sentences and
&gt; paragraphs into a comprehensible polemic - which obviously saves you time.
&gt; You've already reached p 62 on Price's book, so I'd recommend keeping on
&gt; with that all the way to the end. Although she doesn't identify herself as
&gt; an Oxfordian, I suspect that she is. I would guess that her book is the
&gt; first of a projected pair, the first having the objective of demolishing
&gt;&quot;Shaksper's&quot; claims, and the second replacing him with Oxford. At the moment
&gt; she has the biggest reputation in the anti-Strat world, though I'm not quite
&gt; sure why. The general opinion is that her book is very well written, but it
&gt; didn't impress me in those terms. In fact, I found some parts of it clumsy
&gt; and amateurish. Sobran's Alias Shakespeare is more readable, slicker, and
&gt; has a tone that is more agreeable. Sobran is a bit unusual in not apparently
&gt; suffering from William-hatred, a disease that has both Price and Ogburn in a
&gt; continual fever. Their compulsive sniping at &quot;Shaksper&quot; becomes really
&gt; tiresome after a while, because it doesn't actually help their case, and
&gt; just makes you wonder about their psychological health. Sobran has nothing
&gt; against William as such, and doesn't try to belittle him at every turn. He
&gt; just doesn't think he's the author, that's

began to take on a hidden depth. Obviously those who already felt
Shakespeare was &quot;deep,&quot; also feeling confident about the correctness
of the &quot;Stratfordian&quot; biography, didn't feel any need for a change.
But they have not, it seems, been able to convince these Oxfordians

be interested in historical arguments at all -- though obviously they
know they have to refute the historical arguments that seem to run
counter to what they believe is true. Otherwise, they won't be able
to get their readings taken seriously.

That the plays became more resonant for Merilee certainly doesn't mean she
read them only shallowly before. I don't think I did either. And I believe
if you were a member of the Fellowship, Bianca, and could see the subscriber

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I'm generally familiar with the case against SOS, and I find it
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; unpersuasive.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I'm not sure what &quot;generally familiar&quot; means. Have you, for example,
&gt;&gt; read
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; books on Oxford or other candidates, or against WS of Stratford? Or

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;generally familiar&quot; mean you have read what other traditionalists

&gt;&gt; As an author, I'd have to say no to that. Many of my writing acquaintances

&gt; A good point. But ...

&gt; 1) Accidentally picking the name of an implausible boob seems unlikely.

"/>

You do not seem to understand ANYTHING here.
a) The name 'Will Shake-speare' is a multi-level
pun, in the best traditions of Elizabethan punning,
with bawdy, political, classical, martial and other
meanings. The poet contrived it early (around
1565?) and used it because he liked it.
b) Much later he published V&amp;A and Lucrece
over it.
c) The probable sequence then is that his printer,
Richard Field, remarked that he knew someone
with a name like that.
d) The authorities were looking for a way of
publishing these great works, under some
convenient name. That of an illiterate boob,
who agreed to stay in the country, keep silent
and lie low, was a great joke and was handy
enough.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; 2) Deliberately choosing someone of the same name (particularly if he was

The 'front' was a formality. No one knew him
or met him, or -- if they did -- conceived of
the Stratman as an author.

It would be very convenient for historians if
there had never been any conspiracies and
if no governments had ever engaged in any

absolutely honest all the time.

But, unfortunately, life is not like that.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Others have referred to Kathman's essay
&gt; ( http://shakespeareauthorship.com/name1.html ). I was glad when I first read
&gt; it, because while I was not losing sleep over the hyphen, I did find it an
&gt; intriguing piece of evidence. I still do - I think that if the rest of the
&gt; case against Shakespeare of Stratford or for an alternate candidate were
&gt; stronger, it could be brought in as supporting evidence. I think, however,
&gt; that Kathman's essay gives me the ground to say the hyphen does not cry out
&gt; for explanation. It was normal, if unusual - to hyphenate a &quot;compound&quot; name
&gt; in Renaissance England.

"/>

The question is 'how unusual?' And the
answer is VERY unusual. Those are (in
this respect) the ODDS AGAINST the
Stratford story being true. You can say,
'ok, strange things can happen' -- but you
can't keep on saying it, time after time, day
after day, week after week. But that's
what Strats have to do.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; What I
&gt; found in reading those intros was a completely consistent story of how
&gt; Shakespeare of Stratford (SOS) COULD have written the plays,

The 'argument' in such books is absurd.
Those who attended such schools did so
between the ages of 7 and 13. Good ones
then went on to university. The educational
standards were those we would expect for
those AGES. (And 13-year-old boys did not
have a different biological make-up then.)

Those who had illiterate parents were
handicapped in the same way and to the
same extent as are their equivalents today.

There comes a limit to what can be 'picked
up in a bar'. Authors don't usually write

He was, at one stage, a young kid wandering

political, and became part of the 'new
administration' when he was eight. He

quite a lot -- but able to demand attention

&gt; educated kid from the middle classes.

The term 'middle classes' is ahistorical
and wholly inappropriate. The Stratman's
people were yeomen. They were illiterate.
Have you ever met (or heard of -- even in
literature -- or can you conceive of) an
illiterate middle-class family?

The notion that a great writer is likely to
come from an illiterate family is far-fetched
(and quite absurd) today. It would have
been even more ludicrous then.

&gt;&gt; these Oxfordians, and after thinking of Oxford as Shakespeare, they
&gt;&gt; began to take on a hidden depth. Obviously those who already felt
&gt;&gt; Shakespeare was &quot;deep,&quot; also feeling confident about the
correctness
&gt;&gt; of the &quot;Stratfordian&quot; biography, didn't feel any need for a change.
&gt;&gt; But they have not, it seems, been able to convince these Oxfordians
&gt;&gt; that their own readings are meaningful. So I don't think they
would
&gt;&gt; be interested in historical arguments at all -- though obviously
they
&gt;&gt; know they have to refute the historical arguments that seem to run
&gt;&gt; counter to what they believe is true. Otherwise, they won't be
able
&gt;&gt; to get their readings taken seriously.

&gt; That the plays became more resonant for Merilee certainly doesn't mean she
&gt; read them only shallowly before. I don't think I did either.

Thank you for the correction, Lynne. I didn't mean to insult anyone.
If I'd realized the sentence could be read that way, I would have left
it out.

However, I do think Dr. Karr implied that although she had done well
in English literature studies, she didn't feel she had really
_understood_ Shakespeare on the basis of what she'd been taught in
university, but only on the basis of her subsequent study of the
Oxford biography. She was referring, in the part I remember best,
specifically to a performance of a play, I think.

Maybe I will join your group, someday. At the moment, your beliefs
don't match my own, to too great an extent.

Regardless, it seems to me that the bottom line for many &quot;Oxfordians&quot;
is their personal reading of the plays. It is difficult for me to
believe that the historical issues I see being hashed out and disputed
would be able to sustain what I see existing as &quot;Oxfordianism.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt; As an author, I'd have to say no to that. Many of my writing

&gt; You do not seem to understand ANYTHING here.

(I feel like I've wandered into a party. The guests are all nerds, so I
feel at home. Some seem to have had too much to drink and are growing
belligerent, but most are charming and intelligent. I DID get stuck sitting
next to this one guy. He nodded and smiled politely when I spoke, but it
became clear he wasn't listening; he was only waiting for me to shut up so
he could get back to his hobby-horses. He seemd basically inoffensive, but
he kept poking me in the chest while he went off on his rants. I excused
myself as politely as a could, determined to avoid him for the rest of the
evening, and I ... OH SHIT!)

&quot;Hmmm? What's that, Paul? ... Yes, very well done. You've got me there.
Would you excuse me? There's someone over there I have to say hello to.&quot;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; a) The name 'Will Shake-speare' is a multi-level
&gt; pun, in the best traditions of Elizabethan punning,
&gt; with bawdy, political, classical, martial and other
&gt; meanings. The poet contrived it early (around
&gt; 1565?) and used it because he liked it.
&gt; b) Much later he published V&amp;A and Lucrece
&gt; over it.
&gt; c) The probable sequence then is that his printer,
&gt; Richard Field, remarked that he knew someone
&gt; with a name like that.
&gt; d) The authorities were looking for a way of
&gt; publishing these great works, under some
&gt; convenient name. That of an illiterate boob,
&gt; who agreed to stay in the country, keep silent
&gt; and lie low, was a great joke and was handy
&gt; enough.

&gt;&gt; 2) Deliberately choosing someone of the same name (particularly if he
was
&gt;&gt; implausible) as a front

&gt; The 'front' was a formality. No one knew him
&gt; or met him, or -- if they did -- conceived of
&gt; the Stratman as an author.

&gt;&gt; brings in all the conspiracy issues I have a very
&gt;&gt; hard time buying into.

&gt; It would be very convenient for historians if
&gt; there had never been any conspiracies and
&gt; if no governments had ever engaged in any
&gt; plots, and if everyone in history has been
&gt; absolutely honest all the time.

&gt; But, unfortunately, life is not like that.

&gt;&gt; Others have referred to Kathman's essay
&gt;&gt; ( http://shakespeareauthorship.com/name1.html ). I was glad when I first
read
&gt;&gt; it, because while I was not losing sleep over the hyphen, I did find it
an
&gt;&gt; intriguing piece of evidence. I still do - I think that if the rest of
the
&gt;&gt; case against Shakespeare of Stratford or for an alternate candidate were
&gt;&gt; stronger, it could be brought in as supporting evidence. I think,
however,
&gt;&gt; that Kathman's essay gives me the ground to say the hyphen does not cry
out
&gt;&gt; for explanation. It was normal, if unusual - to hyphenate a &quot;compound&quot;
name
&gt;&gt; in Renaissance England.

&gt; The question is 'how unusual?' And the
&gt; answer is VERY unusual. Those are (in
&gt; this respect) the ODDS AGAINST the
&gt; Stratford story being true. You can say,
&gt; 'ok, strange things can happen' -- but you
&gt; can't keep on saying it, time after time, day
&gt; after day, week after week. But that's
&gt; what Strats have to do.

&gt;&gt; What I
&gt;&gt; found in reading those intros was a completely consistent story of how
&gt;&gt; Shakespeare of Stratford (SOS) COULD have written the plays,

&gt; The 'argument' in such books is absurd.
&gt; Those who attended such schools did so
&gt; between the ages of 7 and 13. Good ones
&gt; then went on to university. The educational
&gt; standards were those we would expect for
&gt; those AGES. (And 13-year-old boys did not
&gt; have a different biological make-up then.)

&gt; Those who had illiterate parents were
&gt; handicapped in the same way and to the
&gt; same extent as are their equivalents today.

&gt;&gt; (This is why I find some of the non-Shakespearean arguments - like
&quot;Oxford
&gt;&gt; travelled in Italy&quot; - unconvincing in isolation; it's information SOS
could
&gt;&gt; have picked up in a bar - or from Oxford.

&gt; There comes a limit to what can be 'picked
&gt; up in a bar'. Authors don't usually write
&gt; about things of that nature. They like to
&gt; have had personal experience.

&gt;&gt; Just a recognition that the author was a guy who seemed to absorb
&gt;&gt; information about the world from everywhere.

&gt; The is similar to the 'magic pen' argument.
&gt; This guy, according to you, had a magical
&gt; ability to learn anything.

&gt;&gt; This includes includes some
&gt;&gt; sources - the lower classes - that I think an aristocrat wouldn't have
much
&gt;&gt; contact with;

&gt; You're wrong then. The lower classes
&gt; are (or were) everywhere, and were
&gt; difficult to avoid.

&gt;&gt; he seems to know more about kitchens and gardening than I
&gt;&gt; would expect, for example.

&gt; He was, at one stage, a young kid wandering
&gt; about a large house with a garden and with
&gt; gardeners. His parents were both highly
&gt; political, and became part of the 'new
&gt; administration' when he was eight. He
&gt; would have been left to his own devices
&gt; quite a lot -- but able to demand attention
&gt; from whoever he wanted, and enough to
&gt; find out all he needed.

&gt;&gt; It's not that an aristocrat COULDN'T have known
&gt;&gt; this - &quot;who's to say what he was not capable of&quot; - just
&gt;&gt; that I find it plausible he could have been a middlin'
&gt;&gt; educated kid from the middle classes.

&gt; The term 'middle classes' is ahistorical
&gt; and wholly inappropriate. The Stratman's
&gt; people were yeomen. They were illiterate.
&gt; Have you ever met (or heard of -- even in
&gt; literature -- or can you conceive of) an
&gt; illiterate middle-class family?

&gt; The notion that a great writer is likely to
&gt; come from an illiterate family is far-fetched
&gt; (and quite absurd) today. It would have
&gt; been even more ludicrous then.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I'm generally familiar with the case against SOS, and I find it
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; unpersuasive.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I'm not sure what &quot;generally familiar&quot; means. Have you, for example,
&gt; read
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; books on Oxford or other candidates, or against WS of Stratford? Or
&gt; does
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;generally familiar&quot; mean you have read what other traditionalists
&gt; have
&gt; said
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; on the subject?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Guilty.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I've read a few traditional biographies, but as I said elsewhere, much
&gt; of
&gt; my
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; biographical background comes from play intros, which naturally fixate
&gt; on
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the text; and from a few books of criticism, likewise text-oriented.
&gt; Like
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; most people, I had a passing acquaintance with the authorship
&gt; question,
&gt; but
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; didn't pursue it.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; My formal introduction to the authorship question was, I think, when I
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; picked up a cheap copy of H. N. Gibson's &quot;Shakespeare Claimants&quot;
&gt; several
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; years ago. I found his growing exasperation with the
&gt; non-Shakespeareans
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; amusing, and thought his arguments were (mostly) cogent. I also
&gt; picked up
&gt; a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; used copy of Milward Martin's &quot;Was Shakespeare Shakespeare?&quot;; found
&gt; him a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; little too polemical for my taste, but cogent.

&gt;&gt; RNP
&gt;&gt; If you have read Gibson you know that he at least has the honesty
&gt;&gt; to admit,as did a few other intellectually honest Stratfordians before
&gt;&gt; him ,that both Joseph Hall and John Marston regarded Shakespeare as a
&gt;&gt; pseudonym by l598 to l599.Gibbes does not believe what they said ,very
&gt;&gt; good.But he does believe that they said it.
&gt;&gt; If Gibson had read a little further than he seems ever to have
&gt;&gt; done,he would have found that Stratfordian Richard Simpson writing in
&gt;&gt; the early l870's likewise found that Robert Greene did not believe (in
&gt;&gt; l587) the recent putative authorship claims being advanced on behalf
&gt;&gt; of William Shakspere.Simpson spent many long hours trying to prove
&gt;&gt; that William Shakspere did write that play,Faire Em,but failed to
&gt;&gt; convince anyone except Peter Farey and one other Marlovian who
&gt;&gt; preceeded him.Still Simpson had the intellectual honesty to admit that
&gt;&gt; Greene continued to state(however much Simpson disbelived him) the
&gt;&gt; William Shakspere was a front man for the rest of Greene's short life.
&gt;&gt; If Milward Martin's arguments seem cogent,he does not deserve the
&gt;&gt; credit,The book was ghost-written by an old acquaintance of mine,first
&gt;&gt; name Sheppard,who frequented the circles of that multi-talented New
&gt;&gt; York writer Ree Dragonette.
&gt; Buffalo:
&gt; Did Sheppard have a second name, or is it a secret? And was he the one who
&gt; told you he'd written Martin's book? I bet he had some tales to tell, that
&gt; Sheppard.

"/>

RNP
Sheppard had a second name just as you do, Buffalo, and ,like you,
he had a reason for concealing it. In his case there was the obvious
reason that he was paid and, so far as I know,has(if living) never
breached his employer's confidence.Enough has been said here to
identify him to the surviving members (and historians, if any)of the
Dragonete circle(I am editing her collected poems).

Sheppard ,Teller of tales? He was(may still be) the most
differential of men.Martin (who was an attorney for
Pepsi-Cola)launched his book with a major blast sponsered by his
company , hosted by Joan Crawford and followed by an authorship debate
with Charlton Ogburn,Jr.(the first and only occasion that I had a
private conversation with the younger Ogburn,and probably on the same
night if everyone could really have sobered up by such time).

I was very surprised to see Sheppard hanging around the back of the
auditorium.The next day or two I ran in to him again at the Stand
Bookstore(we had met ,off and on, for years at Dragonette's) and he
very earnestly inquired
if I didn't think Martin had won the debate.I couldn't honestly say
yes,but he seemed so,sadly, bothered by it that I really hated to say
no.He was an older man whom I respected and whom hadn't had the best
literary breaks. It developed that he did the rewrite job and ,in the
course thereof, learned about the authorship controversy for the first
time. He became a fervent but very quiet
Stratfordian and would have been very hurt(he never learned that
Dorothy Ogburn was a very old friend of mine)if I believed his labors
had come to naught.
Unfortunately,despite his general reliability,he lacked the
expertise to criticize Martin's historical assumptions and he had been
hired to verify an argument based upon highly selective critical
opinions which Sheppard accordingly expanded ,but which he would
never have been encouraged to challenge.If I had known in advance of
publication what they were up to,I could, and would,have gladly
supplied him with material that made a more presentable case than he
was given.For I actually think there are at least three or four
good,as well as many bad ,arguments to be made for the old faith.

As my acquaintance does not seem to have been mentioned in the
credits to the book and as he took rather great pride in it,it seems
to fit to mention it here and to explain why it was not a better
book(though within its stated limitations creditable)more
especially since the simple fact is that the Strats have not had a
reasonably good authorship book since Gibson(the least said about
R.Churchill's scholarship and Frank whatshisname's platitudes the more
merciful for all concerned) and the Oxfordian's have not produced a
comprehensive introductory book since that of Harriet Amphlett circa
l950.

In other words,Buffalo,authors concealed their names in the later
sixties(as I was paid to do myself on two quite lucrative occasions)
because they were so paid to do so by their patrons and as Greene
attests that he and Will Shakspere did in their time.Will was paid by
those above him and later did some paying to those financially
beneath(though possibly socially above) him.There was nothing
essentially dishonest about this.Greene and Buc despised him and John
Davis thought he was a great fellow.Marston and Hall,to name no more
Shakespeare deniers ,believed that Labeo should write cleanly and
should write alone.Was Will the guy whom they believed was smutting it
up? Or was he hiring, or being hired, by two other people? Or were
Marston and Hall completely on the wrong track as Gibson believed? I
had essentially this same conversation nearly forty years ago with
Charlton Ogburn and he promised to take it up, but lamentably he
never appears to have assimilated the materials then called to his
attention.

I would not presume ,Buffalo, to inquire why you choose to preserve
a pseudonym;
however,until you choose (or are compelled as in the unfortunate
case of K.Q. Knave) to lay your cards on the table,one might be rather
less censorious of the right of others,not excluding both William
Shakespeare and Will Shakspere, to do likewise.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;If the Stratfordians were unable to fathom
&gt;&gt; an authorship hoax going on under their noses on behalf of one of
&gt;&gt; their own,how much less are they qualified to judge the credibility of
&gt;&gt; witnesses who wrote four hundred years ago and whose evidence they
&gt;&gt; almost invariably ignore?
&gt; Buffalo:
&gt; They lacked your inside knowledge.

"/>

RNP:
They seem to lack a lot of knowledge that was available,at least
for short periods of time,to many in the late fifteen hundreds.(Greene
held up publication for fouor years.The Marston and Hall publications
were called in.Did they go on the Bishop's bonfire? Harvey and
Nashe,like Pasternak in the Soviet Union,were turned into non-persons
for the remainder of their lives.)

It would have been much easier to get information on open &quot;secrets&quot;
in the late sixties had anybody cared about a minor rehash of the
Stratfordian theory .My two pseudonymous collaborations,one of which
had extracts printed in a national magazine,were simply too ephemeral
in interest,however topical at the time,to merit further
curiosity.,thank God. I still get around ten letters a year about my
three thousand copy collaboration with Yanovsky and Levitin and my
three hundred copy limited edition from Cuala Press.
That kind of appreciation is far more satisfactory to some of us.
<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; Diana Price made no errors on the points cited here. She just can

Not a good analogy. There are no private
(or even semi-private) conversations around
here. Everything you say is shouted out to
the multitude. It's more like going into a very
rough bar, where you are liable to be punched
for anything you say by anyone at any time.
Likewise, silence is a dangerous behaviour,
when you are tackled after carelessly blurting
something out. One option is to stay silent
all the time; another is to leave. If you want
a private conversation with someone, use
email. If you want a better-regulated brawl,
try an uptown bar like SHAKSPER, but you

&gt;&gt; Buffalo:
&gt;&gt; Did Sheppard have a second name, or is it a secret? And was he the one
who
&gt;&gt; told you he'd written Martin's book? I bet he had some tales to tell,
that
&gt;&gt; Sheppard.
&gt; RNP
&gt; Sheppard had a second name just as you do, Buffalo, and ,like you,
&gt; he had a reason for concealing it.

"/>

Actually, I have no real reason for concealing mine. Anyone who really wants
to know who I am can find out easily enough just by following the trail from
one critical post, which one person on this group did with no apparent
difficulty. At any rate there are at least two people here who know my true
name. By the time I got round to considering dropping that
carelessly-adopted Buffalo moniker, I'd already built up a body of posts in
that name. So....

Google doesn't really tell me much about you except that you're interested
in magic, tarot cards, alchemy and other esoteric subjects. And all I can
find out about myself under my real name is that I'm interested in computer
programming. It seems to me that Roger Nyle Parisious is just as anonymous
as Buffalo. I could have called myself Clarence Baines Delahunty if my taste
swung that way.

I enquired about this ghost-writer's second name because a button-holing
sally like &quot;an old acquaintance of mine,first name Sheppard,who frequented
the circles of that multi-talented New York writer Ree Dragonette&quot; more or
less invited it. It seemed like name-dropping minus the name. Or else it
carried a suggestion that we ought to be familiar enough with Bohemian New
York of the post-war period to know already.

I don't have Diana Price's book in front of me, and don't recall anything

&quot;devastating shot&quot; she could come up with. And if it turned out that she had
conjured up something extra for Jonson to say (that all but five critics
have never heard of) it would have a kind of twisted justice. It would, you
might say, counterbalance her &quot;devastating shot&quot; of effectively erasing
three of the six stanzas that make up L'Envoye to Narcissus and treating it
as a three-stanza poem. I find myself reading commenting lines about this
poem like &quot;In the second stanza, with the reference to 'purple robes,'
Edwards became the first to imply that the poet of Venus and Adonis was an
aristocrat&quot;, and I am forced to write in the margins, &quot;she means, of course,
the fifth stanza&quot;. And then I have to do it over and over again as I work
through her commentary, scribbling the correct number, &quot;she means the fourth
stanza&quot;, &quot;that's the fifth stanza&quot;, etc, alongside the offending sentence. I
can see why she's doing it, of course, but correcting Price's tendentious

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I'm generally familiar with the case against SOS, and I find
&gt; it
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; unpersuasive.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I'm not sure what &quot;generally familiar&quot; means. Have you, for
&gt; example,
&gt; read
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; books on Oxford or other candidates, or against WS of Stratford?
&gt; Or
&gt; does
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;generally familiar&quot; mean you have read what other
&gt; traditionalists
&gt;&gt;&gt; have
&gt;&gt;&gt; said
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; on the subject?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Guilty.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I've read a few traditional biographies, but as I said elsewhere,
&gt; much
&gt;&gt;&gt; of
&gt;&gt;&gt; my
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; biographical background comes from play intros, which naturally
&gt; fixate
&gt; on
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the text; and from a few books of criticism, likewise
&gt; text-oriented.
&gt; Like
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; most people, I had a passing acquaintance with the authorship
&gt;&gt;&gt; question,
&gt;&gt;&gt; but
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; didn't pursue it.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; My formal introduction to the authorship question was, I think,
&gt; when I
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; picked up a cheap copy of H. N. Gibson's &quot;Shakespeare Claimants&quot;
&gt; several
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; years ago. I found his growing exasperation with the
&gt; non-Shakespeareans
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; amusing, and thought his arguments were (mostly) cogent. I also
&gt;&gt;&gt; picked up
&gt;&gt;&gt; a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; used copy of Milward Martin's &quot;Was Shakespeare Shakespeare?&quot;;
&gt; found
&gt; him a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; little too polemical for my taste, but cogent.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; RNP
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If you have read Gibson you know that he at least has the honesty
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to admit,as did a few other intellectually honest Stratfordians before
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; him ,that both Joseph Hall and John Marston regarded Shakespeare as a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; pseudonym by l598 to l599.Gibbes does not believe what they said ,very
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; good.But he does believe that they said it.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If Gibson had read a little further than he seems ever to have
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; done,he would have found that Stratfordian Richard Simpson writing in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the early l870's likewise found that Robert Greene did not believe (in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; l587) the recent putative authorship claims being advanced on behalf
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of William Shakspere.Simpson spent many long hours trying to prove
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that William Shakspere did write that play,Faire Em,but failed to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; convince anyone except Peter Farey and one other Marlovian who
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; preceeded him.Still Simpson had the intellectual honesty to admit that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Greene continued to state(however much Simpson disbelived him) the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; William Shakspere was a front man for the rest of Greene's short life.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If Milward Martin's arguments seem cogent,he does not deserve the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; credit,The book was ghost-written by an old acquaintance of mine,first
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; name Sheppard,who frequented the circles of that multi-talented New
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; York writer Ree Dragonette.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Buffalo:
&gt;&gt;&gt; Did Sheppard have a second name, or is it a secret? And was he the one
&gt; who
&gt;&gt;&gt; told you he'd written Martin's book? I bet he had some tales to tell,
&gt; that
&gt;&gt;&gt; Sheppard.
&gt;&gt; RNP

&gt;&gt; Sheppard had a second name just as you do, Buffalo, and ,like you,
&gt;&gt; he had a reason for concealing it.

"/>

Sheppard had a second name just as you do, Buffalo, and ,like
you,
he had a reason for concealing it. In his case there was the obvious
reason that he was paid and, so far as I know,has(if living) never
breached his employer's confidence.Enough has been said here to
identify him to the surviving members (and historians, if any)of the
Dragonete circle(I am editing her collected poems).

Sheppard ,Teller of tales? He was(may still be) the most
differential of men.Martin (who was an attorney for
Pepsi-Cola)launched his book with a major blast sponsered by his
company , hosted by Joan Crawford and followed by an authorship debate
with Charlton Ogburn,Jr.(the first and only occasion that I had a
private conversation with the younger Ogburn,and probably on the same
night if everyone could really have sobered up by such time).

I was very surprised to see Sheppard hanging around the back of the
auditorium.The next day or two I ran in to him again at the Stand
Bookstore(we had met ,off and on, for years at Dragonette's) and he
very earnestly inquired
if I didn't think Martin had won the debate.I couldn't honestly say
yes,but he seemed so,sadly, bothered by it that I really hated to say
no.He was an older man whom I respected and whom hadn't had the best
literary breaks. It developed that he did the rewrite job and ,in the
course thereof, learned about the authorship controversy for the first
time. He became a fervent but very quiet
Stratfordian and would have been very hurt(he never learned that
Dorothy Ogburn was a very old friend of mine)if I believed his labors
had come to naught.
Unfortunately,despite his general reliability,he lacked the
expertise to criticize Martin's historical assumptions and he had been
hired to verify an argument based upon highly selective critical
opinions which Sheppard accordingly expanded ,but which he would
never have been encouraged to challenge.If I had known in advance of
publication what they were up to,I could, and would,have gladly
supplied him with material that made a more presentable case than he
was given.For I actually think there are at least three or four
good,as well as many bad ,arguments to be made for the old faith.

As my acquaintance does not seem to have been mentioned in the
credits to the book and as he took rather great pride in it,it seems
to fit to mention it here and to explain why it was not a better
book(though within its stated limitations creditable)more
especially since the simple fact is that the Strats have not had a
reasonably good authorship book since Gibson(the least said about
R.Churchill's scholarship and Frank whatshisname's platitudes the more
merciful for all concerned) and the Oxfordian's have not produced a
comprehensive introductory book since that of Harriet Amphlett circa
l950.

In other words,Buffalo,authors concealed their names in the later
sixties(as I was paid to do myself on two quite lucrative occasions)
because they were so paid to do so by their patrons and as Greene
attests that he and Will Shakspere did in their time.Will was paid by
those above him and later did some paying to those financially
beneath(though possibly socially above) him.There was nothing
essentially dishonest about this.Greene and Buc despised him and John
Davis thought he was a great fellow.Marston and Hall,to name no more
Shakespeare deniers ,believed that Labeo should write cleanly and
should write alone.Was Will the guy whom they believed was smutting it
up? Or was he hiring, or being hired, by two other people? Or were
Marston and Hall completely on the wrong track as Gibson believed? I
had essentially this same conversation nearly forty years ago with
Charlton Ogburn and he promised to take it up, but lamentably he
never appears to have assimilated the materials then called to his
attention.

I would not presume ,Buffalo, to inquire why you choose to preserve
a pseudonym;

Just to re-inforce the point, I emailed Diana Price several months ago with
two queries, but didn't get a reply. I tried again yesterday, and got her
reply this morning. She had said in her book that Shakespeare was one of the
least cited actors in the extant cast lists. I asked her what cast lists she
was talking about, since the only cast lists I've ever heard of are those
attached to Jonson's published plays. I can't quote a private email
directly, but her one-sentence reply was that she didn't know of any others.
This was followed by several more sentences detailing other kinds of
evidence - allusions in poems, names appearing in stage directions,
theatrical wills, etc - none of which qualify as &quot;extant cast lists&quot;, of
course.

The second query was about her assertion that there was corrupt and
unauthorized version of 3 Henry VI that had been put on some time prior to
the publication of Groatsworth. I asked where and when this performance took
place, and how we know the text was corrupt and unauthorized. Her reply was
that, yes, there is a corrupt text; the play had been performed &quot;sundrie
times&quot; by Pembroke's men, according to the record (which we know already),
and that the play was obviously written by 1592, since a line from it is
quoted in Groatsworth (which we also know). And that's all. No text - and no
clue as to why she thinks it was either corrupt or unauthorized.

The point is that if false claims like these are made on newsgroups, they
will be shot down immediately. But when they appear in books they circulate
indefinitely, and are read and believed by much larger numbers of people.
They will be absorbed into anti-Strat dogma. And that's why, if you want to
get a grasp of the authorship debate, you really have to go for where this
stuff originates - the books. You just have to read Price, Sobran, Whalen,
Ogburn, etc, and make extensive notes as you go. And, as these examples
illustrate, you have to be alert. Hardly a page will go by without our
author trying to slip something through your guard.

As there happen to be literally hundreds of treatments of the Two

treat these two texts as both corrupt and unauthorized Miss Price and
the other readers have understandably regarded further comment

&gt;&gt;&gt; Thanks, Buffalo (and Lynne) for your thoughtful replies.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I've read all your posts of the last week or so,

&gt;&gt;&gt; Now *that* shows a serious lack of common sense. Don't know if I can
&gt;&gt; trust
&gt;&gt;&gt; your reply now. :)

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; William (if
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; you're looking for a non-combative name, and dislike the
anti-Strats'
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;Shaksper&quot;)

&gt;&gt;&gt; For the moment, I still find all the variations on the name either
fraught
&gt;&gt;&gt; with potential for confusion (&quot;William&quot;) or loaded (&quot;Shaksper&quot;). If
there
&gt;&gt;&gt; are any widely agreed upon, unambiguous, neutral terms (ha!), I'll
adopt
&gt;&gt;&gt; them. In the meantime, I'll continue to spell them out or abbreviate.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Thoughts from other readers?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Although it's of some interest to engage in newsgroup controversies,
&gt;&gt; either
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; here or at the Shakespeare Fellowship, it's of limited value in
terms of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; learning anything. To get a grasp of anti-Strat theories, you have
to
&gt;&gt; read

&gt;&gt;&gt; Oddly enough, I find myself in agreement with Paul Crowley here. My
&gt;&gt; style,
&gt;&gt;&gt; I guess, tends to be very detail-oriented, so the give and take on
&gt;&gt; detailed
&gt;&gt;&gt; issues, which sometimes comes to a point, appeals to me. Now that I'm
&gt;&gt;&gt; getting better armed with the detail arguments, however, I'll give the
&gt;&gt;&gt; full-length treatments another try.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Again, thanks for your thoughtful suggestions. I'm giving Price
another
&gt;&gt; go.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Also working up the substantiation for the &quot;intellectual dishonesty&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt; comment. Off to the library. (The same one Price used, by the way.)

&gt;&gt; Just to re-inforce the point, I emailed Diana Price several months ago
with
&gt;&gt; two queries, but didn't get a reply. I tried again yesterday, and got
her
&gt;&gt; reply this morning. She had said in her book that Shakespeare was one of
the
&gt;&gt; least cited actors in the extant cast lists. I asked her what cast lists
she
&gt;&gt; was talking about, since the only cast lists I've ever heard of are
those
&gt;&gt; attached to Jonson's published plays. I can't quote a private email
&gt;&gt; directly, but her one-sentence reply was that she didn't know of any
others.
&gt;&gt; This was followed by several more sentences detailing other kinds of
&gt;&gt; evidence - allusions in poems, names appearing in stage directions,
&gt;&gt; theatrical wills, etc - none of which qualify as &quot;extant cast lists&quot;, of
&gt;&gt; course.

&gt;&gt; The second query was about her assertion that there was corrupt and
&gt;&gt; unauthorized version of 3 Henry VI that had been put on some time prior
to
&gt;&gt; the publication of Groatsworth. I asked where and when this performance
took
&gt;&gt; place, and how we know the text was corrupt and unauthorized. Her reply
was
&gt;&gt; that, yes, there is a corrupt text; the play had been performed &quot;sundrie
&gt;&gt; times&quot; by Pembroke's men, according to the record (which we know
already),
&gt;&gt; and that the play was obviously written by 1592, since a line from it is
&gt;&gt; quoted in Groatsworth (which we also know). And that's all. No text -
and no
&gt;&gt; clue as to why she thinks it was either corrupt or unauthorized.

&gt; RNP
&gt; As there happen to be literally hundreds of treatments of the Two
&gt; Parts of the Contention since Malone's time and virtually all of them
&gt; treat these two texts as both corrupt and unauthorized Miss Price and
&gt; the other readers have understandably regarded further comment
&gt; superfluous.

"/>

&quot;Two Parts of the Contention &quot;? Unfortunately for you, there is no such
play. The First Part of the Contention appeared in print in 1594, and the
The Whole Contention appeared in 1619. Also unfortunately for you, Ms Price
was referring to performances that took place several years before either
publication appeared. What texts were used for those pre-Groatsworth
performances, whether they were inferior versions of an already existing
text, or the true version as written by Shakespeare, cannot be known.
Nor can it be known whether or not they were authorized. The 1600 quarto
of Henry VI Part 3 tells us the play was &quot;sundry times acted by the Right
Honourable the Earle of Pembrooke his seruantes'&quot;, and it would reasonable
to say that those performances at least were authorized. What other
performances there might have been that were not authorized, neither you nor
Ms Price is in any position to know.

Pretty good, coming from someone who has devoted several paragraphs in this
thread to basking in the reflected glow of more productive talents - &quot;my
friend Miss Dragonette...I am editing her collected poems...Dorothy Ogburn
was a very old friend of mine...an old acquaintance of mine...my three
thousand copy collaboration with Yanovsky and Levitin...&quot; Etc, etc. I
sympathise with you in your disappointed life, but such prodigious
name-dropping is the hallmark of the under-achiever, and gives a more
concentrated meaning to the phrase &quot;pretentious fakers&quot;.

Still, your post is at least a visual improvement on the appalling mess you
served up last time. Your next task is to start leaving spaces after commas.

Unfortunately for you there are two plays exactly as has been
generally stated for hundreds of consecutive years.If you &quot;think&quot; the
Whole Contention is a different
play then the two night production that Pembroke's men played prior
to Greene's
death,you stand virtually alone. Mss Price and the rest of the
readership will continue to believe otherwise unless you can produce
an argument which displays a higher level of erudition than you may
ever possibly possess.

Also ,fortunately for you, you have finally picked up on at least
one uncontested and uncontestable historicalA fact.But what can you do
with it?

It would be useless to try to sort all the ill digested
assumptions crowded into such a small space. Reasonable to say
&quot;Authorized&quot; - by who or when? Might or might not be reasonable.A text
was published referring to a company that had largely ceased
performing by l594.They sold most of these playbooks early.Not
necessarily reasonable to say the claim of the l600 published version
was correct.Certainly,as generally believed.There were many years to
correct the situation.
Everyone is in the same position to know or not to know.

Snipping from Buffalo plaigerizations of old HLAS dispatches. He
has little personality of his own. Perhaps that's why he likes to hide
and snap at the ankles.&gt; Just to re-inforce the point, I emailed Diana
Price several months ago with
<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;of
&gt; course.

&gt; Buffalo
&gt; The point is that if false claims like these are made on newsgroups, they
&gt; will be shot down immediately.
