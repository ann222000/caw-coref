Fokes, who amongst you will not admit he craves a taste of the ole
Yoke's love?  I do.  And I ain't alone.  It's the love that inspired
John (have you given the ole Revolution 9 a lissens lately?), it's the
love that produced Sean.  Give his record a lissen to, I ferget what's
it's called, "Into the Son" or sumfin.  Not bad either.  It ain't
zactly the Beatles but fokes I ask you:  Who is?  Sean's his own man.
Well, he's gots his own man, so say the rumorers, quite a happy
relationship even if still "in the closet" as they say.  Nuthin wrong
with the ole closet neither.  Anyways, Yoko's love inspired Sean, made
him into what he's become, and in a way made all of us.  To deny
Yoiko's love is like a conspiracy of sorts, like denyin the
Hollercops, or who shot KFJ.  Fokes it happened, I was there.  Well
not really "there" (Is anyone really here?), but I watched it on the
ole TV.  Trust me, it happened.  And to deny it is the biggest
conspiracy of all..

Guess I'm hitting pretty close to home for the anon forger to keep up his
ridiculus campaign.

Good.

I think I'm more ink-lined to explore Yoko's hate. Let it well over me, feel
it drip. I could soak in it like a hot bath and the tips of my fingers would
go all funny after staying in it so long.

That's about 200 letters, which means that if you divide that by *9* you get
22.22222222 which of course represents John and Yoko.

It's all the fucking numbers Jimbo it's all the fucking numbers.

The numbers, the numbers Jim. It's all in the numbers. YO was *really* into
numbers Jim. Like example:  Charlie has 7 letters.... and like that would
really mean something to the Bridge on the River Kwai lady. That's what I
was on about. It's humour. Y'know guffawing and all that. Having a laugh.
It's when yer make sort of shuddering movements with the shoulders, but not
wanking.
