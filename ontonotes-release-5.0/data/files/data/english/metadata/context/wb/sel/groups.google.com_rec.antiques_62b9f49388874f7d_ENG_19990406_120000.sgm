Hi, I hope someone can identify this item for me!

It is about 3 or 4 feet long, with trestle-type legs, and table-height.
It's made out of plank wood, wider at one end than the other, and there are
sides about 8&quot; to 10&quot; high.

It is tapered, and on the short end is an iron blade like on a paper cutter,
and a curved piece of iron going across the wooden contraption, I suppose as
a safety guard.

There is a name on the iron part that is worn, but looks like &quot;Whitte -
Moore&quot;, and the date is 1856.

I am told that it was used to cut sheaves of wheat. The wheat would be
inserted into the broader end and pushed down to the narrow end, and through,
and would be trimmed with the blade. I was also told it was used to make
broom heads.

Would love to know (1) what it's called, (2)how it was used, (3) what its
value might be.

If anyone can help or point me in the right direction I would really
appreciate it!

Thanks in advance!

Barb

"/>  If you consider how wheat is harvested, this use is not
realistic. Sheaves were made and stacked in the field, and not
trimmed up later.

"/>  More likely ... can make broom and then whack the straggling
strands off.
It could also have been used for chopping feed, like turnips,
potatos, corn ears, or even hay, for feeding young animals.

the best source for identifying these things is an OLD Sears
Catalog. Look in your library for a reproduction and check the
farm utensildin the front.

"/> We just sold one in our shop. Maybe not quite as large as yours, but
with the original red paint. We called it a silage cutter. The value
of yours *might* be wildly different from what we got for ours, which
was somewhat less than the standard $100.
