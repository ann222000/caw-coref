&gt; That's a Chevy SUV with some rounded corners.  There's absolutely
&gt; nothing new there.

&gt; It's about as retro as a pencil.

&gt; Looks like they got some PT Cruiser envy, but didn't have any money to
&gt; do the operation--so they took an existing small SUV and rounded the
&gt; corners.

&gt; Pretty ugly, actually.

That's what I was thinking...butt ugly, probably horrendously expensive
(given the 70k+ truck they based the front end on) and it's OBVIOUSLY a pale
imitation of the PT Cruiser.

Too bad...Chrysler beat out GM's design team with the Prowler (which they
promptly killed), Ford beat GM's Designers with the rebirth of a REAL
Mustang at JUST the right moment to catch the ceasing of production of the
Camaro in it's entirety...looks to me as though GM's either going to hell in
a handcart, or they're simply getting ready to go tits-up.

GM can't seem to get anything right these days, can they?!

Yep, GM is going down. And so is the "quality" of their car (if
it even could go lower). But
I agree, this new model is not my cup of tea either.

Keeping in mind GM is the largest auto manufacturer in the world, I
doubt they are "getting ready to go tits-up" just yet. That said, the
HHR is really ugly. I don't like SUVs in general, although there are
some good looking ones out there (X5, MDX for instance), but this one
rivals the Aztec...

And why is it that whenever a car manufacturer designs a completely ugly
and usually underperforming car they say the younger buyers are their
target audience? If I recall correctly, the Element, Echo, Aztec, HHR
and many others were all marketed as such. I'm a young buyer, and I
wouldn't pay money for ANY of these cars.

It's not the PT Cruiser so much as the return of the traditional fender.  In
style and fashion what's old eventually becomes new again.  Chrysler started
the fender craze with their full size trucks long before the PT came along,
and the classic Jeep never went away.  Chevy's SSR truck follows this as
does the Mazda RX-8 and to some extent the new Beetle.  There won't be a
wholesale return to fenders across all cars, but a few models (like the
Jeep) may hang around indefinitely.

The Camaro was canned, from what I understand, because they'd engineered it
out of competition.  The price inched up to compete with the Corvette and no
one bought them any more.  The new Mustang has cut a lot of corners (solid
rear axle, parts bin components) to keep the price down.

GM blew it big time on the bland import "GTO" while Chrysler hit sales home
runs with the Magnum and new 300.  The new Pontiac G6 might as well be
called AccordLite.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

I'm not one to defend GM and was horrified by a rental Cavalier just 6
months ago.  It's hard to describe how many ways it reeks.  It was weak
competition to Japanese cars in the 1980s, and they are just now killing it!
If GM continues on this course they'll keep withering away.

As a previous owner of a PT (wife's actually), I'll say that it would
be a step up on one if it had about 25% more room.  Which it doesn't
look like it does.

Nothing special, but again, the PT is nothing special at this point,
either.  A lot of hype when it came out, when we sold it, it was worth
nothing.  Good thing we bought it used.

Yawn!  Also noted that the article says that SSR is "languishing in the
lots."  At close to 40k a copy for something that looks all the world like a
1953 GMC truck one has to think the thing would have very limited appeal.

&gt;&gt; Thumbs up or Thumbs down?

&gt;Yawn!  Also noted that the article says that SSR is &quot;languishing in the
&gt;lots.&quot;  At close to 40k a copy for something that looks all the world like a
&gt;1953 GMC truck one has to think the thing would have very limited appeal.
&gt;It's the old lipstick on a pig theory -- slip a big V8 in anything and it
&gt;will sell.

One cruised past me yesterday and I was surprised how BIG it was.  If
nothing else, they need to have an "SS" SSr with a badass engine.  I
suspect lack of power also killed Ford's T-Bird effort.

It looks like a big PT cruiser except after it was squished sideways in
a crusher just enough to take the curves out of the fenders...and
without the retro-looking back end (this thing just looks like another
SUV from behind).  And whole package doesn't swoop rearward like a PT,
it's more like just a delevery van or Helm's Bakery truck.  Yuck.

Ya know...since there hasn't yet been ONE positive response to this post,
I'll put money on GM actually putting this one in production, and then
WONDERING why it didn't sell as well as they were sure it would...(Can you
say "AZTEK?"  I knew that ya could...  ;)

Well 3/5ths of the groups this was posted to were performance car
groups, the other two generic manufacturer groups so I would imagine
the target market isn't here.

Maybe something like alt.momscar-kidsmobile might be more
appropriate...

True, but this does not negate the fact that this is truly a butt-ugly
vehicle by anyone's standards.  God help me...I'd rather buy the damned
Chrysler than that monstrosity...and I've NEVER bought a Chrysler in my
life!!!

FTR:  The ONLY Chrysler that I had my interest in recent years was the
Prowler...and they killed that...so I'm sure that you already KNOW how much
I'm planning on buying my first Chrysler....
