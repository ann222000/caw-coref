&gt;   And you WONDER why that aspirin the nurse gave you during your overnight
&gt; stay at the hospital (after an intoxicated illegal alien driver crashed
&gt; into your car while you were stopped at a red light) represented a $170.00
&gt; charge on your hospital bill, or why they billed you $97.00 for that box of
&gt; tissues?

&gt;   While women such as the beloved supermarket employee whose tragic story
&gt; is recounted below DIE tragically, Mexico is boating (didn't you hear?)
&gt; that one of its own, billionaire Carlos Slim, has surpassed Bill Gates as
&gt; The World's Richest Human Being.

&gt;   And even on the very day that U.S. citizen Sandra Pearson would painfully
&gt; breathe her dying breath after being denied the same medical care that the
&gt; 25-30 million illegal aliens now inside the gates are entitled to, Señor
&gt; Slim and his Narcogovernment amigos shipped us yet another 3,000 of their
&gt; poorest, least-educated, most violent citizens.

&gt;   And did so again today, as well ...

&gt;             A George Washington Admirer
&gt; --------------------------------------------------------
&gt; A tragic lesson: Health care must be fixed

&gt; July 10, 2007

&gt;  It might be an exaggeration to say the nation's health-care system - or
&gt; lack thereof - killed Sandra Pearson. But it sure didn't do much to keep
&gt; her from dying.

&gt;  Pearson, who lived in the Town of Poughkeepsie, died June 30 - about five
&gt; months after she was diagnosed with a rare illness that had destroyed part
&gt; of her intestines.

&gt;  Pearson - everybody called her Sandy - lived for 52 years, and she had
&gt; full-time jobs for 35 of those years. She had a medical insurance policy
&gt; through her employer, A&amp;P Supermarkets, but it wasn't long after her
&gt; illness was diagnosed that she learned it was virtually worthless.

&gt;  The policy contained a raft of exclusions and thresholds and caveats, and
&gt; the bottom line was this: Before she could undergo surgery involving a
&gt; transplant of some of her intestines, she would have to qualify for
&gt; Medicaid. And in order to qualify for Medicaid, she would have to give the
&gt; state Medicaid system her life's savings.

&gt;  The red tape involved in applying and getting approved for Medicaid was
&gt; about as arduous and complicated as you'd expect, but with the help of a
&gt; social worker at Vassar Brothers Medical Center, Pearson finally did so
&gt; three months ago.

&gt;  The social worker, May Mamiya, called Pearson's case a textbook example of
&gt; what's wrong with the nation's health-care system: Here was a woman had who
&gt; worked and paid taxes all her life and had a job that included medical
&gt; insurance. But when she needed help - for the first time in her life - the
&gt; system failed her miserably.

&gt;  All the delays in dealing with her insurance carrier, and then Medicaid,
&gt; pushed Pearson farther down the waiting list for a donor for the transplant
&gt; operation.

&gt;  And on June 30, she ran out of time.

&gt;  Those who knew Pearson said she was a hard worker with a kind heart and a
&gt; wonderful sense of humor. But the ordeal of waiting for medical treatment
&gt; for a serious illness in the United States of America in 2007 clearly wore
&gt; her down.

&gt;  At the funeral Thursday morning at the Delehanty Funeral Home in
&gt; Wappingers Falls, Mary Jane Danko, a friend who works at the Mobil Foam and
&gt; Wash on Route 9 - where Pearson held a part-time job - approached the open
&gt; casket and placed a paper butterfly on Pearson's floral print dress.

&gt;  Danko said the two had spoken on the telephone on the afternoon of June 29
&gt; - and she sensed something was very wrong.

&gt;  &quot;Sandy's voice was different - the strength had gone out of it,&quot; she said.
&gt; &quot;I think she just gave up.&quot;

&gt;  A few minutes later, a flower-draped hearse delivered Sandy Pearson's
&gt; casket to Poughkeepsie Rural Cemetery. Her burial plot sits on a bluff
&gt; overlooking the Hudson River. It's a beautiful and peaceful spot. As
&gt; Pearson's friends and family members paused at the grave for a final
&gt; goodbye, a warm breeze stirred a stand of tall pine trees nearby.

&gt;  As Danko walked away, she said she would be angry for a long time about
&gt; what had happened to her friend.

&gt;  &quot;She was a wonderful person who worked hard all her life,&quot; she said.

&gt; &quot;How Eisenhower solved illegal border crossings from Mexico&quot;
&gt; By John Dillin http://www.csmonitor.com/2006/0706/p09s01-coop.html

&gt; Excerpt:

&gt;   &quot;General Eisenhower ... quoted a report in The New York Times,
&gt; highlighting one paragraph that said: 'The rise in illegal border-crossing
&gt; by Mexican 'wetbacks' to a current rate of more than
&gt; 1,000,000 cases a year has been accompanied by a curious relaxation
&gt; in ethical standards extending all the way from the farmer-exploiters
&gt; of this contraband labor to the highest levels of the Federal
&gt; Government ...&quot;

&gt;   &quot;Herbert Brownell Jr., Eisenhower's first attorney general, said the
&gt; president had a sense of urgency about illegal immigration when he took
&gt; office.

&gt;   &quot;America 'was faced with a breakdown in law enforcement on a very large
&gt; scale,' Mr. Brownell said. 'When I say large scale, I mean hundreds of
&gt; thousands were coming in from Mexico [every year] without restraint.'&quot;
&gt; --------------------------------------------------
&gt; Just two of MANY American cops murdered by illegals: www.DeputyDavidMarch.comwww.KrisEggle.org

&gt; &quot;Unfortunately, the majority of illegal aliens who are here are engaged in
&gt; criminal activity. Identity theft, use of fraudulent Social Security
&gt; numbers and green cards, tax evasion, driving without licenses represent
&gt; some of the crimes that are engaged in by the majority of illegal aliens on
&gt; a daily basis merely to maintain and hide their illegal status. In
&gt; addition, violent crime and drug distribution and possession is also
&gt; prevalent among illegal aliens. Over 25% of today's federal prison
&gt; population are illegal aliens. In some areas of the country, 12% of
&gt; felonies, 25% of burglaries and 34% of thefts are committed by illegal
&gt; aliens.&quot;

&gt;   -- Testimony of District Attorney John M. Morganelli before the House
&gt; Subcommittee on Immigration, Border, Security and Claims [Note: 99% of
&gt; warrants for murder in Los Angeles, California -- the USA's 2nd
&gt; most-populous city -- are for illegal aliens]

&gt; &quot;It does not take a majority to prevail, but rather an irate,
&gt; tireless minority keen on setting brushfires of freedom in the minds of
&gt; men.&quot;
&gt;    -- Samuel Adams

&gt; &quot;&quot;All great truths begin as heresies.&quot;

&gt;   -- Former Democrat Governor of Colorado Richard Lamm, official of
&gt;       Defend Colorado Now, a movement opposed to illegal immigration
&gt;       and public services for illegal aliens

Damn Timmy, what a blatant liar you are. So it's o.k. for you to copy

the subject being mentioned, but someone else who links to sites with
just as factual information as you paste is ridiculed. Did you even
read the two articles you listed out of the eight cited?

debt from treating &quot;Hispanic immigrants&quot; who couldn't pay that it had
to close. Let me clarify the term &quot;Hispanic immigrants&quot; for your
edification  Timmy, they are more commonly known as illegal aliens.

The second link had so much information and facts your tiny pea brain
must have become overwhelmed by them. Here's just one small sentence
from that article.
&quot;The central issue, though, remains in place--the hospital has had to
scale back health services to American citizens to treat illegals.&quot;
That's right Timmy, CITIZENS are suffering in order to help illegal
aliens. Do you understand that, or are you just too stupid?
You won't even take the time to read the other six articles because
you believe one isn't &quot;news.&quot; What are your reasons for brushing off
the other FIVE articles that aren't from FOX, Timmy?

As I've said before Timmy, you are a lying, racist scumbag. Your
stupidity knows no bounds and reading your idiotic drivel is getting
old. If you really do work at a hospital in finance like you've said
then you are either very stupid, or have your head so far up your own
rectum that absolutely nothing other than feces is what your daily
intake is. Geez you're DUMB!

&gt; &gt; &gt; Again, very little specifics. Mostly an anti-immigration editorial. Do
&gt; &gt; &gt; you have any facts?

&gt; &gt; &gt; fox news?  Buahahahahahahahahahaha that's not even worth responding
&gt; &gt; &gt; to. Let me guess, you're so dumb you think fox IS news.
&gt; &gt; &gt; bauiahjjahahahahahahaha

&gt; &gt; Damn Timmy, what a blatant liar you are. So it's o.k. for you to copy
&gt; &gt; and paste entire news articles that have absolutely nothing to do with
&gt; &gt; the subject being mentioned, but someone else who links to sites with
&gt; &gt; just as factual information as you paste is ridiculed. Did you even
&gt; &gt; read the two articles you listed out of the eight cited?
&gt; &gt; The first link provided told of one hospital that racked up so much
&gt; &gt; debt from treating &quot;Hispanic immigrants&quot; who couldn't pay that it had
&gt; &gt; to close. Let me clarify the term &quot;Hispanic immigrants&quot; for your
&gt; &gt; edification  Timmy, they are more commonly known as illegal aliens.

&gt; And you wonder why people call you a bigot.  There are far more legal
&gt; hispanic immigrants than illegal ones you racist piece of dog shit.

&gt; &gt; The second link had so much information and facts your tiny pea brain
&gt; &gt; must have become overwhelmed by them. Here's just one small sentence
&gt; &gt; from that article.
&gt; &gt; &quot;The central issue, though, remains in place--the hospital has had to
&gt; &gt; scale back health services to American citizens to treat illegals.&quot;
&gt; &gt; That's right Timmy, CITIZENS are suffering in order to help illegal
&gt; &gt; aliens. Do you understand that, or are you just too stupid?

&gt; Ohhh, I am so frightened.  Ohhhhhhh. hint: you don't scare Americans,
&gt; bitch.  I forgot more about the hospital business than you will ever
&gt; no. There is not a single hospital in all of the USA that you can
&gt; prove closed do to illegal immigration, not one.

&gt; &gt; You won't even take the time to read the other six articles because
&gt; &gt; you believe one isn't &quot;news.&quot; What are your reasons for brushing off
&gt; &gt; the other FIVE articles that aren't from FOX, Timmy?

&gt; It's bullshit. You can't point to any hospital in America that closed
&gt; do to ilegal immigration. You can't do it. You know you can't do it.
&gt; tha's why you trot out your little daffynition.

&gt; &gt; As I've said before Timmy, you are a lying, racist scumbag.

&gt; Yet you can't point to a single lie or racist thing I have ever said.
&gt; Just like you can't point out any hospital in America that closed due
&gt; to illegal immigration.   You're whole adgenda relies on fear, hate
&gt; and lies.

Timmy, it's from a HISPANIC website you moron. They aren't going to
call them &quot;illegal aliens.&quot;  Obviously you're too stupid to be scared.
Your statement: &quot;I forgot more about the hospital business than you
will ever no.&quot; proves what a dumbshit you are. You don't even KNOW the
difference between no and know. LOL, what a dumbass. Everything you
write is either a lie or racist Timmy. You won't even comment on the
other 5 articles cited. What a poor excuse for a human being you are
Timmy.
We should all feel sorry for you.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You lying spamming freak. You can't prove that any hospital has ever

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Nevermind, it's clear why you lie.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Geez you're dumb Timmy. Here's a few links, you lying racist coward.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; http://www.nshp.org/?q=node/717

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; No mention of illegal aliens causing it's closure.  In fact, it
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mentions instead the debt the hospital racked up. This hospital closed
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; due to bad business practices.

Nope  - You can pull web sites out of your ass all day long. What you
can't do, what you won't do is point to FACTS to support your claim
that ANY hospital in the USA closed due to illegal immigration.
Stick to spelling flames, bongo boy.
