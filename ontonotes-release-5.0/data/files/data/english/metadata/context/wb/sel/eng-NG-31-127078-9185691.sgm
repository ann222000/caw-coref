Islamic terrorists target Army base -- in Arizona
http://www.washingtontimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20071126/NA...

Fort Huachuca, the nation's largest intelligence-training center,
changed security measures in May after being warned that Islamist
terrorists, with the aid of Mexican drug cartels, were planning an
attack on the facility.

Fort officials changed security measures after sources warned that
possibly 60 Afghan and Iraqi terrorists were to be smuggled into the
U.S. through underground tunnels with high-powered weapons to attack the
Arizona Army base, according to multiple confidential law enforcement
documents obtained by The Washington Times.

&quot;A portion of the operatives were in the United States, with the
remainder not yet in the United States,&quot; according to one of the
documents, an FBI advisory that was distributed to the Defense
Intelligence Agency, the CIA, Customs and Border Protection and the
Justice Department, among several other law enforcement agencies
throughout the nation. &quot;The Afghanis and Iraqis shaved their beards so
as not to appear to be Middle Easterners.&quot;

According to the FBI advisory, each Middle Easterner paid Mexican drug
lords $20,000 &quot;or the equivalent in weapons&quot; for the cartel's assistance
in smuggling them and their weapons through tunnels along the border
into the U.S. The weapons would be sent through tunnels that supposedly
ended in Arizona and New Mexico, but the Islamist terrorists would be
smuggled through Laredo, Texas, and reclaim the weapons later.

A number of the Afghans and Iraqis are already in a safe house in Texas,
the FBI advisory said.

Fort Huachuca, which lies about 20 miles from the Mexican border, has
members of all four service branches training in intelligence and secret
operations. About 12,000 persons work at the fort and many have their
families on base.

Lt. Col. Matthew Garner, spokesman for Fort Huachuca, said details about
the current phase of the investigation or security changes on the post
&quot;will not be disclosed.&quot;

&quot;We are always taking precautions to ensure that soldiers, family
members and civilians that work and live on Fort Huachuca are safe,&quot;
Col. Garner said. &quot;With this specific threat, we did change some aspects
of our security that we did have in place.&quot;

According to the FBI report, some of the weapons associated with the
plot have been smuggled through a tunnel from Mexico to the U.S.

The FBI report is based on Drug Enforcement Administration sources,
including Mexican nationals with access to &quot;sub-sources&quot; in the drug
cartels. The report's assessment is that the DEA's Mexican contacts have
proven reliable in the past but the &quot;sub-source&quot; is of uncertain
reliability.

According to the source who spoke with DEA intelligence agents, the
weapons included two Milan anti-tank missiles, Soviet-made
surface-to-air missiles, grenade launchers, long guns and handguns.

&quot;FBI Comment: The surface-to-air missiles may in fact be RPGs,&quot; the
advisory stated, adding that the weapons stash in Mexico could include
two or three more Milan missiles.

The Milan, a French-German portable anti-tank weapon, was developed in
the 1970s and widely sold to militaries around the world, including
Saddam Hussein's Iraq. Insurgents in Iraq reportedly have used a Milan
missile in an attack on a British tank. Iraqi guerrillas also have shot
down U.S. helicopters using RPGs, or rocket-propelled grenades.

FBI spokesman Paul Bresson would not elaborate on the current
investigation regarding the threat, but said that many times the initial
reports are based on &quot;raw, uncorroborated information that has not been
completely vetted.&quot; He added that this report shows the extent to which
all law enforcement and intelligence agencies cooperate in terror
investigations.

&quot;If nothing else, it provides a good look at the inner working of the
law-enforcement and intelligence community and how they work together on
a daily basis to share and deal with threat information,&quot; Mr. Bresson
said. &quot;It also demonstrates the cross-pollination that frequently exists
between criminal and terrorist groups.&quot;

The connections between criminal enterprises, such as powerful drug
cartels, and terrorist organizations have become a serious concern for
intelligence agencies monitoring the U.S.-Mexico border.

&quot;Based upon the information provided by the DEA handling agent, the DEA
has classified the source as credible,&quot; stated a Department of Homeland
Security document, regarding the possibility of an attack on Fort
Huachuca. &quot;The identity of the sub-source has been established; however,
none of the information provided by the sub-source in the past has been
corroborated.&quot;

The FBI advisory stated the &quot;sub-source&quot; for the information &quot;is a
member of the Zetas,&quot; the military arm of one of Mexico's most dangerous
drug-trafficking organizations, the Gulf Cartel. The Gulf Cartel
controls the movement of narcotics from Nuevo Laredo, Mexico, into the
U.S. along the Laredo corridor.

However, the sub-source &quot;for this information is of unknown
reliability,&quot; the FBI advisory stated.

According to the DEA, the sub-source identified Mexico's Sinaloa cartel
as the drug lords who would assist the terrorists in their plot.

This led the DEA to caution the FBI that its information may be a Gulf
Cartel plant to bring the U.S. military in against its main rival. The
Sinaloa and Gulf cartels have fought bloody battles along the border for
control of shipping routes into the U.S.

&quot;It doesn't mean that there isn't truth to some of what this source
delivered to U.S. agents,&quot; said one law-enforcement intelligence agent,
on the condition of anonymity. &quot;The cartels have no loyalty to any
nation or person. It isn't surprising that for the right price they
would assist terrorists, knowingly or unknowingly.&quot;

&gt;&gt; &gt; Islamic terrorists target Army base -- in Arizona
&gt;&gt; &gt; http://www.washingtontimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20071126/NA...
&gt;&gt; &gt; 1260034/1001

&gt;&gt; &gt; Fort Huachuca, the nation's largest intelligence-training center, changed
&gt;&gt; &gt; security measures in May after being warned that Islamist terrorists, with
&gt;&gt; &gt; the aid of Mexican drug cartels, were planning an attack on the facility.

&gt;&gt; &gt; Fort officials changed security measures after sources warned that
&gt;&gt; &gt; possibly 60 Afghan and Iraqi terrorists were to be smuggled into the U.S.
&gt;&gt; &gt; through underground tunnels with high-powered weapons to attack the
&gt;&gt; &gt; Arizona Army base, according to multiple confidential law enforcement
&gt;&gt; &gt; documents obtained by The Washington Times.

&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;A portion of the operatives were in the United States, with the remainder
&gt;&gt; &gt; not yet in the United States,&quot; according to one of the documents, an FBI
&gt;&gt; &gt; advisory that was distributed to the Defense Intelligence Agency, the CIA,
&gt;&gt; &gt; Customs and Border Protection and the Justice Department, among several
&gt;&gt; &gt; other law enforcement agencies throughout the nation. &quot;The Afghanis and
&gt;&gt; &gt; Iraqis shaved their beards so as not to appear to be Middle Easterners.&quot;

&gt;&gt; &gt; According to the FBI advisory, each Middle Easterner paid Mexican drug
&gt;&gt; &gt; lords $20,000 &quot;or the equivalent in weapons&quot; for the cartel's assistance
&gt;&gt; &gt; in smuggling them and their weapons through tunnels along the border into
&gt;&gt; &gt; the U.S. The weapons would be sent through tunnels that supposedly ended
&gt;&gt; &gt; in Arizona and New Mexico, but the Islamist terrorists would be smuggled
&gt;&gt; &gt; through Laredo, Texas, and reclaim the weapons later.

&gt;&gt; &gt; A number of the Afghans and Iraqis are already in a safe house in Texas,
&gt;&gt; &gt; the FBI advisory said.

&gt;&gt; &gt; Fort Huachuca, which lies about 20 miles from the Mexican border, has
&gt;&gt; &gt; members of all four service branches training in intelligence and secret
&gt;&gt; &gt; operations. About 12,000 persons work at the fort and many have their
&gt;&gt; &gt; families on base.

&gt;&gt; &gt; Lt. Col. Matthew Garner, spokesman for Fort Huachuca, said details about
&gt;&gt; &gt; the current phase of the investigation or security changes on the post
&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;will not be disclosed.&quot;

&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;We are always taking precautions to ensure that soldiers, family members
&gt;&gt; &gt; and civilians that work and live on Fort Huachuca are safe,&quot; Col. Garner
&gt;&gt; &gt; said. &quot;With this specific threat, we did change some aspects of our
&gt;&gt; &gt; security that we did have in place.&quot;

&gt;&gt; &gt; According to the FBI report, some of the weapons associated with the plot
&gt;&gt; &gt; have been smuggled through a tunnel from Mexico to the U.S.

&gt;&gt; &gt; The FBI report is based on Drug Enforcement Administration sources,
&gt;&gt; &gt; including Mexican nationals with access to &quot;sub-sources&quot; in the drug
&gt;&gt; &gt; cartels. The report's assessment is that the DEA's Mexican contacts have
&gt;&gt; &gt; proven reliable in the past but the &quot;sub-source&quot; is of uncertain
&gt;&gt; &gt; reliability.

&gt;&gt; &gt; According to the source who spoke with DEA intelligence agents, the
&gt;&gt; &gt; weapons included two Milan anti-tank missiles, Soviet-made surface-to-air
&gt;&gt; &gt; missiles, grenade launchers, long guns and handguns.

&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;FBI Comment: The surface-to-air missiles may in fact be RPGs,&quot; the
&gt;&gt; &gt; advisory stated, adding that the weapons stash in Mexico could include two
&gt;&gt; &gt; or three more Milan missiles.

&gt;&gt; &gt; The Milan, a French-German portable anti-tank weapon, was developed in the
&gt;&gt; &gt; 1970s and widely sold to militaries around the world, including Saddam
&gt;&gt; &gt; Hussein's Iraq. Insurgents in Iraq reportedly have used a Milan missile in
&gt;&gt; &gt; an attack on a British tank. Iraqi guerrillas also have shot down U.S.
&gt;&gt; &gt; helicopters using RPGs, or rocket-propelled grenades.

&gt;&gt; &gt; FBI spokesman Paul Bresson would not elaborate on the current
&gt;&gt; &gt; investigation regarding the threat, but said that many times the initial
&gt;&gt; &gt; reports are based on &quot;raw, uncorroborated information that has not been
&gt;&gt; &gt; completely vetted.&quot; He added that this report shows the extent to which
&gt;&gt; &gt; all law enforcement and intelligence agencies cooperate in terror
&gt;&gt; &gt; investigations.

&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;If nothing else, it provides a good look at the inner working of the
&gt;&gt; &gt; law-enforcement and intelligence community and how they work together on a
&gt;&gt; &gt; daily basis to share and deal with threat information,&quot; Mr. Bresson said.
&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;It also demonstrates the cross-pollination that frequently exists between
&gt;&gt; &gt; criminal and terrorist groups.&quot;

&gt;&gt; &gt; The connections between criminal enterprises, such as powerful drug
&gt;&gt; &gt; cartels, and terrorist organizations have become a serious concern for
&gt;&gt; &gt; intelligence agencies monitoring the U.S.-Mexico border.

&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;Based upon the information provided by the DEA handling agent, the DEA
&gt;&gt; &gt; has classified the source as credible,&quot; stated a Department of Homeland
&gt;&gt; &gt; Security document, regarding the possibility of an attack on Fort
&gt;&gt; &gt; Huachuca. &quot;The identity of the sub-source has been established; however,
&gt;&gt; &gt; none of the information provided by the sub-source in the past has been
&gt;&gt; &gt; corroborated.&quot;

&gt;&gt; &gt; The FBI advisory stated the &quot;sub-source&quot; for the information &quot;is a member
&gt;&gt; &gt; of the Zetas,&quot; the military arm of one of Mexico's most dangerous
&gt;&gt; &gt; drug-trafficking organizations, the Gulf Cartel. The Gulf Cartel controls
&gt;&gt; &gt; the movement of narcotics from Nuevo Laredo, Mexico, into the U.S. along
&gt;&gt; &gt; the Laredo corridor.

&gt;&gt; &gt; However, the sub-source &quot;for this information is of unknown reliability,&quot;
&gt;&gt; &gt; the FBI advisory stated.

&gt;&gt; &gt; According to the DEA, the sub-source identified Mexico's Sinaloa cartel as
&gt;&gt; &gt; the drug lords who would assist the terrorists in their plot.

&gt;&gt; &gt; This led the DEA to caution the FBI that its information may be a Gulf
&gt;&gt; &gt; Cartel plant to bring the U.S. military in against its main rival. The
&gt;&gt; &gt; Sinaloa and Gulf cartels have fought bloody battles along the border for
&gt;&gt; &gt; control of shipping routes into the U.S.

&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;It doesn't mean that there isn't truth to some of what this source
&gt;&gt; &gt; delivered to U.S. agents,&quot; said one law-enforcement intelligence agent, on
&gt;&gt; &gt; the condition of anonymity. &quot;The cartels have no loyalty to any nation or
&gt;&gt; &gt; person. It isn't surprising that for the right price they would assist
&gt;&gt; &gt; terrorists, knowingly or unknowingly.&quot;

&gt;&gt; It's coming. There are so many of those creeps here now that as soon as the
&gt;&gt; word is given, this country will go down quicker than a French prostitute.

I think it is going to be hundreds, if not thousands, of high rise buildings
all coming down at the same time. I know of people that have taken jobs
working in high rise buildings as parking attendants. They have access to
some pretty good places to hide explosives and I believe they are planting
them as we speak and have been doing so for several years now. And, yes,
I've told the FBI of these people. Whether or not they are doing anything,
who knows?

Fox hypes shaky story on border tunnel jihadists
David Edwards and Nick Juliano
Published: Monday November 26, 2007

Print This  Email This

A report Monday on potential terrorist infiltration of the US was
based largely on &quot;raw, uncorroborated information&quot; from a source of
&quot;unknown reliability.&quot;

Given the opportunity to fear-monger, though, the folks at Fox &amp;
Friends ignored those caveats and painted a picture of weapon-wielding
terrorists who are plotting an attack on a US army base as we speak.

&quot;It was one base in particular ... Fort Huachuca, they have tunnels
that go right into it, they have 60 people ... Iraqis and Afghanis,
some of which made it through and are still here, coming through with
high-powered, lethal weapons to bomb out some of the 12,000 that are
housed at that fort,&quot; anchor Brian Kilmead warned in that ominous-yet-
cheerful tone that is a hallmark of the Fox News morning crew.

Of course, the idea that Mexican smugglers have tunnels that go &quot;right
into&quot; a fortified US Army base is ridiculous on its face, although
authorities have discovered more than 20 drug-smuggling tunnels
leading from Mexico into the US since Sept. 11, 2001.

Also unmentioned by the 'Fox friends' was the fact that the terror
warnings, which were reported Monday in the Washington Times, were
from May of this year -- six months ago, despite the urgency with
which the anchors drummed up the terror threat.

According to the reports, terrorists paid the drug cartels $20,000 per
person to smuggle them into the US. Fort Huachuca changed its security
procedures following the warnings from various law enforcement
agencies and does not appear to be in danger of an imminent attack.

The information on the terror smuggling came from a Drug Enforcement
Agency informant who had been reliable in the past, although that
informant apparently received his or her information from a &quot;sub
source&quot; within a Mexican drug cartel whose credibility could not be
verified.

The sub-source was affiliated with the Gulf Cartel, one of Mexico's
most dangerous drug-trafficking organizations, according to the Times
and is of &quot;unknown reliability,&quot; according to the FBI. The source
identified a rival cartel, the Sinaloa, as assisting the terrorist
smuggling.

&quot;This led the DEA to caution the FBI that its information may be a
Gulf Cartel plant to bring the U.S. military in against its main
rival,&quot; the Times noted in the penultimate paragraph of its article.
&quot;The Sinaloa and Gulf cartels have fought bloody battles along the
border for control of shipping routes into the U.S.&quot;

These details were conveniently omitted from Monday's Fox report.
