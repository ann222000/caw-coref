Just watch an interview with Frank Schaeffer, co author of AWOL: The
Unexcused Absence of America's Upper Classes from Military Service --
and How It Hurts Our Country. During the interview on CSPAN Schaeffer
said the draft was initially instituted in 1917 because too many
children of the rich were volunteering for service. IIRC this
parallels the British experience in the same war. Now the number of
Ivy leaguers in the military is less than 1%, and I would personally
bet the "safe" services, Air Force and Navy, have a large share of
that number.

WI the Vietnam War was as much a crusade as WWI and WWII? Where it was
considered a duty to serve your country rather than a sign of
stupidity?

Is there any POD that would make such dedication normal rather than a
sign of stupidity? Is there a way to get an Army that represents all
of the classes in America or are we letting the "volunteer" nature
serve as an excuse for our children avoiding service?

I ~think~ (but could be wrong) that to have military service not be
viewed as "stupid", you might need another Depression after the Second
World War, so that more kids would view the military as a viable
career because work is otherwise scarce.
It would entail there being less bounty and wealth as these kids were
growing up, I'd think.

What is 1% of what?

&lt;1% of serving military personnel are Ivy league graduates?

A large proportion of military personnel are too
young to be Ivy league graduates.

The Ivies graduate about 12,000 people a year,
not counting foreign students.

That's less than 1% of the ~4M Americans who
turn 21 each year, so it should be no surprise
at all that less than 1% of Americans in the
military are Ivy league graduates.

&lt;1% of Ivy league graduates are serving military personnel?

Could be.

Brown, Harvard, and Columbia don't even have ROTC programs.

But there are ~1.4M people in the services, and there
are 105M Americas age 20-44. Only about 1.4% of eligible
Americans are in the services.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Yes, and I would personally bet that the sun
will rise in the east tomorrow.

As of 6/30/2005, the Air Force and Navy had 717,000
personnel; the Army and Marine Corps had 673,000.

It is overwhelmingly likely that "a large share"
of any category of military personnel would be
in two services that are a majority of military
personnel.

However, if the question is where the scions of
wealthy families are to be found, the answer is:
primarily in combat arms. Working-class and under-
class youths may join the services for college money
and job skills. Upper-class youth don't have that
need. Anything the service could provide they already
have or can get elsewhere.

If they join up, it is to shoot big guns, jump
out of planes, drive tanks, fly jets, blow
things up, learn to kill with bare hands: to be
_warriors_.

I don't understand why this thread is entitled KILLING THE RICH.  It
might more properly be called WHY DON'T MORE PEOPLE SPEND SOME YEARS IN
THE MILITARY.

I expect commentators to air the same old responses that usually show up
in a STARSHIP TROOPERS thread  --- military service will be described as
a character building experience, good for all that ails a society.

I humbly suggest that there will be no shortage of patriots ready for
the ultimate sacrifice if there was a real danger to the  country. Poise
a multi-million man army group on the USA border and there will be a
near universal turn out by all Americans to defend this land.

=======================

An alt-- "1968 --- 300"

Southwestern desert, and the 300 hippies are surrounded. They are in a
tent enscribed with "LOVE" and "PEACE" signs and slogans. Around them
are tanks and armor and pyjama clad VC everywhere.

Oiled up and dedecked with gold chairs and ear rings is HO CHI MINH ---
very muscular for his age --- relaxed on his throne, which is at the top
of a long staircase atop a  gigantic sled, festooned with hammer and
sickles and red stars.

A SPOKESMAN (looks a lot like KIM JONG IL) is at the front of the pack,
and he faces hippy leader ABBIE  HOFFMAN, who stands outside the hippie
tent.

SPOKESMAN: Abby Hoffman, Ho Chi Minh, leader of the Communist Movement,
general in chief of the World Revolution, Master of the Enslavement of
Humanity, forgives you your many blasphemies. Ho is a merciful and kind
God, and will make you master of your fellow Americans if you will only
admit that Ho is the Master of All the Earth.

The hideous gimp, DICK CHENEY, is alongside the SPOKESMAN.

DICK CHENEY:  Be wise, Abbie, and sell out. Ho Chi Minh is the Man, and
he will give you more than you can ever make honestly.  I got six
deferments and I'm president of Halliburton, making billions without
competitive bids.

ABBIE:  Cheney, I hope you live forever.

CHENEY does not know what has happened. Has he been insulted?

NARRATOR (V.0): The bong is heavy in his hand.

ABBIE drops the bong.

NARRATOR (V.0):  He is stifing in his poncho.

ABBIE whips off his poncho and he has a mini cannon under it and he
knee;s in slow motion.

AND HO opens his mouth in surprise ---

AND the Hippies burst from the tent ---

AND ABBIE lets it fire in a burst ---

AND long haired JOHN WAYNE has gray hair down to his ass and is
attacking VC with a damned sword ---

AND ABBIE's machine gun is really smoking

AND HO's THRONE flips backwards and bullets pockmark the metal bottom of
the tyrant's seat.

AND the BAD GUYS are firing in massed waves ---

AND heroes die, dashing out of that tent --- BUTCH &amp; SUNDANCE --- TONY
MONTANA , JOAN BAEZ, FORREST GUMP, JAMES T. KIRK &amp; SPOCK , HOSS AND
LITTLE JOE CARTWRIGHT

NARRATOR (V.0): Abbie Hoffman's scream of defiance is heard by all and
will be recalled by all.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

How would you achieve this, Jack? The World Wars posed a clear threat
to the established order of powers. In the first case, belated
American entry had slightly more to do with submarines that the
Kaiser's designs for global dominion. The latter case, of course, was
an existential threat to the republic, like the Civil War.

Vietnam was a proxy war, like Iraq and Afghanistan; it didn't imperil
the republic directly nor threaten its survival. And if we want to win
on technical points, Vietnam wasn't a "war" to become a crusade in--it
was a vast overreach of executive branch power, a gradual escalation
of a half-hearted police-action into a clusterfuck, without a defined
enemy--"Communism" and "Dominoes" are not enemies, and the post-facto
creation of the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution to give ass-covering quality
to the already extant war, well...--or defined mission objective.

There's no crusade to effectively *win* in this case, and so it's hard
to mount one. A "Global Crusade Against Communism" would be just as
effective as other Wars on Abstract Nouns.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;  Where it was considered a duty to serve your country rather than a sign of

Jack, it is a duty to serve the republic. It is not a duty, however,
to serve the republic in a a travesty of a war, a mistake, and a lie.
It is only the duty to serve a dictatorship in those cases.

Free citizens do what they want; even within that frame, the Vietnam
War did include the draft, despite MacNamara's 200,000 Social Program.
Mind, the draft was less equitable than it had been during WWII, but
better than it was during the Civil War.

But America has a tradition of a relatively small standing military,
in proportion to population, compared to other uberpowers of the past.
The Founders and the first century or so of the Republic bequeathed,
in fact, a horror at a large standing army which remains central to
American political life 200+ years later. The late-coming of American
superpower status in a free, semi-universally voting republic
preempted the development of martial culture.

The Post-Vietnam Army wasn't really a Career Opportunity again until
the mid-1980s, once it got cleaned up--even then, low pay and
excruciatingly slow career advancement in peacetime do not make
regular enlistment economically appealing or sensible for most
Americans who go to the Ivies or the Little Ivies. [Additionally, the
increasingly jarring rightward shift of the American military makes it
a culturally unappealing organization for a lot of people on those
campuses.]

The all-volunteer era marks a time when many of the JCS and greater
numbers of the officers are not drawn from the service academies, but
from ROTC branches. The bitter legacy of Vietnam which led to the
removal of many ROTC and recruiters from upper tier university
campuses, has not been reversed, for a variety of reasons. In some,
though not all cases, this is a consequence of DADT, which has
increasingly been viewed as a discriminatory employment practice. This
reduces the interest of homosexuals in joining the armed forces, with
a ripple suppression on people who don't feel compelled to fight for a
republic that treats its citizens less than equitably. [Fair
disclosure: I'd have either applied to West Point or joined ROTC if I
didn't have a boyfriend; however, what would I be fighting for other
than homophobia and the destruction of my own rights as a
citizen?....I mean, hooray gay-bashing!] Likewise, the proliferation
of rape of women soldiers helps suppress female enrollment.

Let's condense: the army pays poorly, could get you killed, has
excellent (until 2001, hooray urine man!) health care, but is
wrenching on families. In a world in which both women and men serve,
but also women and men vote and women have  careers and professional
lives separate from their husbands, it makes the army a hard sell when
it is a homophobic, reactionary, misogynistic organization that either
would require both spouses to serve in the same branch in the hope of
similar post assignments, or to have a spouse (the wife) sacrifice
career ambitions to follow her husband post-to-post for a long time at
a relatively low income.

I'd have to look at the marriage numbers, but let's work with the
assumption that there's equity between the education and original
class of the husband and wife coming out of, say, Yale. It's highly
unlikely that you'll get a couple where either the wife or the husband
is willing to subsume their life and their education to be a wife on
base, for a cross-section of factors. It's just unappealing.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

A more militarized republic, probably, which would have so many other
impacts that this would be relatively pedestrian.

You would need either no Vietnam War or a wildly different outcome to
continue the draft, to forcibly make the US Army more equitable.

I also suspect that your strawman of "stupidity" is both a nasty
talking point and a little bit more than silly.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Is there a way to get an Army that represents all of the classes in America or
&gt; are we letting the &quot;volunteer&quot; nature serve as an excuse for our children avoiding &gt; service?
">

Well, to answer the first of essentially two questions, yeah, return
to the draft. No one wants that.

To answer the second question: that's crap! "We" aren't doing anything
in particular, just a whole mess of people making choices
independently of each other. There's sense to be made of this part,
Jack, other than as a sort of political temper tantrum.

"...excuse for our children avoiding the service" should set off a
string of alarm bells in anyone. The service hasn't been obligatory
for a while, so no one is "avoiding" anything; they're just making an
economic choice regarding their employer. Looking at 1972-August 2001,
Would you want a low-paying job with little chance of career
advancement over /years/ when you had obviously better opportunities
to start with, in an organization that is reactionary, macho,
homophobic, and misogynistic, if you could go work for Morgan Stanley,
Fleet Bank, JP Morgan, Random House, or go to graduate school instead?

There was a brief upsurge in commitment to military service following
Sept. 11. But the long twilight war with no bid contracts is not an
existential threat to the republic, and certainly not one that has
been managed competently; accordingly, it's underwhelming to people
who have other more viable options.

The all-volunteer army is not the most appealing employer in a
marketplace of employers who have incentives to treat and pay
employees better, in a society after third wave feminism. It doesn't
mean there aren't smart, honorably, dutiful people serving in the
army; it just means that it's a less appealing alternative with a BA
from Harvard, Williams, Stanford, or Northwestern.

You may see a slight shift following the abolition of DADT; that would
allow recruiters back to law schools, but it won't reopen a bunch of
ROTC chapters. You'd need the two to start seeing /an/ increase of any
sort from Harvard, Amherst, or Northwestern. Regardless, that increase
won't be /huge./

At least until Tehran and Damascus...

Of course, none of this takes into account things like Blackwater,
Ravenwood, and Triple Canopy.

I'd argue that among the wealthy those scions who felt a military
vocation would be inclined to apply for West Point and Annapolis in
preference to ROTC programs thus somewhat depressing their numbers
among Ivy League schools. I'd further argue that this would have been
the case pretty much throughout the post-WW2 era and that this would
pretty much have been the case Vietnam war or no Vietnam war. If
active service is what you want, West Point is one of the better ways
to get it.

The "Killing the rich" title was used because that is why the first
draft in WWI was instituted, the rich were volunteering and, like the
British, were being killed.

The number of presidents with military experience will get very small,
very soon. Unless one of the 120 or so serving Congresspeople decide
to run there will fewer and fewer.

"Moskos said that in his 1956 graduating class at Princeton, there
were 750 students, all male, and 450 went into the military. Last
June, there were 1,100 men and women in Princeton's graduating class,
and nine went into the military."

Draft days vs. volunteer days.

Well, you *could* get Vietnam to be seen as a more national effort if
there were some precipitating event besides the Gulf of Tonkin.  It
doesn't require too much handwaving for a PoD--just have, I dunno, a
contingent of U.S. troops in the wrong place at the wrong time (or
"right place at the right time" as it were") get attacked and possibly
overrun by NVA in a way that at least appears to the news viewer/
reader to be a case of blatant aggression.

OTOH, this still probably won't keep the Vietnam mess from becoming
OTL's goatf*ck, but it might make involvement a somewhat less
difficult sell for the government.

You're right, though, that the larger social trends underway in
America in particular and Western Civ in general are not going to be
changed by a Vietnam that seems more just.

In this area, I'd tend to disagree.  You're no more going to get
upper- and upper-middle-class people to be enthusiastic about being
soldiers than you're going to get them about being police officers,
fire-fighters, and other such professions.  A small number of people
who might normally be pro-military might be put off by such things,
but it seems more to me that the idea of military service as something
Those People do has less to do with ideological commitments one way or
the other than it does with a general hollowing out of the idea of
civic duty all across the social and political spectrum.

Likewise, the proliferation

The Women's War
By SARA CORBETT

On the morning of Monday, Jan. 9, 2006, a 21-year-old Army specialist
named Suzanne Swift went AWOL. Her unit, the 54th Military Police
Company, out of Fort Lewis, Wash., was two days away from leaving for
Iraq. Swift and her platoon had been home less than a year, having
completed one 12-month tour of duty in February 2005, and now the
rumor was that they were headed to Baghdad to run a detention center.
The footlockers were packed. The company's 130 soldiers had been
granted a weekend leave in order to go where they needed to go, to say
whatever goodbyes needed saying. When they reassembled at 7 a.m. that
Monday, uniformed and standing in immaculate rows, Specialist Swift,
who during the first deployment drove a Humvee on combat patrols near
Karbala, was not among them.

Swift would later say that she had every intention of going back to
Iraq. But in the weeks leading up to the departure date, she started
to feel increasingly anxious. She was irritable, had trouble sleeping
at night, picked fights with friends, drank heavily. ''I was having a
lot of little freakouts,'' she told me when I went to visit her in
Washington State last summer. ''But I was also ready to go. I was
like, 'O.K., I can do this.''' &lt;more, long story&gt;

On the side of making the war meaningful one of the constant
complaints from those who participated was that they wern,t allowed to
win (In the words of Rambo). No bombing real targets, no offenses
above a certain line, conducting "private" wars that seemed to be
intended to protect a heroin crop rather than defeat an enemy, backing
up overtly corrupt people of really awful character.

&gt; &gt; But America has a tradition of a relatively small standing military,

&gt; &gt; The Founders and the first century or so of the Republic bequeathed,
&gt; &gt; in fact, a horror at a large standing army which remains central to
&gt; &gt; American political life 200+ years later. The late-coming of American
&gt; &gt; superpower status in a free, semi-universally voting republic
&gt; &gt; preempted the development of martial culture.

&gt; &gt; The Post-Vietnam Army wasn't really a Career Opportunity again until
&gt; &gt; the mid-1980s, once it got cleaned up--even then, low pay and
&gt; &gt; excruciatingly slow career advancement in peacetime do not make
&gt; &gt; regular enlistment economically appealing or sensible for most
&gt; &gt; Americans who go to the Ivies or the Little Ivies. [Additionally, the

That's true; I was offering additional, amplifiers of this issue in
the post-Vietnam era. I suspect the central issue isn't precisely one
of class, but one related to America's relationship with the military
in general, which has tended to preclude a large military in
peacetime. OTOH, that sentence needs better qualification than the
adjectives I chose, and probably some better qualifiers.

Agreement here as well.

But the armed services are manifestly more conservative than they were
under Eisenhower. IIRC, ~53% of the officers were Republican under
Eisenhower. Now, it's rather more than simple majority. Are the
current Republicans in the army manifestly either more conservative
than the ones in the 1950's, or more conservative along the
contemporary political spectrum? I dunno; but something to consider if
you're selling service at Swarthmore.

&gt; Proliferation?
">

This is harder to determine, actually. I was thinking about the recent
Helen Benedict essay from Salon:

http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2007/03/07/women_in_military/index_...

Key paragraph:

"Rape, sexual assault and harassment are nothing new to the military.
They were a serious problem for the Women's Army Corps in Vietnam, and
the rapes and sexual hounding of Navy women at Tailhook in 1991 and of
Army women at Aberdeen in 1996 became national news. A 2003 survey of
female veterans from Vietnam through the first Gulf War found that 30
percent said they were raped in the military. A 2004 study of veterans
from Vietnam and all the wars since, who were seeking help for post-
traumatic stress disorder, found that 71 percent of the women said
they were sexually assaulted or raped while in the military. And in a
third study, conducted in 1992-93 with female veterans of the Gulf War
and earlier wars, 90 percent said they had been sexually harassed in
the military, which means anything from being pressured for sex to
being relentlessly teased and stared at."

The number of rapes and assaults reported in Iraq have surged in Iraq.
This may be either because more are being committed, or because the
DOD is working its way towards a more effective reporting system,
though the article is not convinced of the latter.

Of course, Gulf War II has a higher number of overall women as
soldiers--15%?--than prior wars, and more women in more combat roles
for the lack of the front lines.

Right; there were a fairly severe string of cases all through the
nineties, and then a very bad one relatively recently at AFA, which is
such an amazing mess across the board with its incestous relationship
with Dobson and cheating that that's sort of its own freak show. The
stats above suggest that the army hasn't quite integrated women
successfully; whether or not the reports coming in from Iraq represent
an actual increase in sheer numbers or better reporting, no one can
say; apparently, only active duty service members can file reports,
which rejiggers results, to a point.

Right; additionally, because of DADT, recruiters are banned from a

think UChicago, at least, has some deal in which students can join a
Navy ROTC Chapter at one of the city colleges or something--not sure
how popular that is.

Hmm, that'd be interesting. One option would be some sort of Great

In a broad viewing of "left-wing." Yale and Brown are blue-haired
hairy-legged liberal, then Cornell, Columbia, Harvard/UPenn probably
dead center, Princeton, Dartmouth. The problem is that's not a great

They are all, however, manifestly more liberal than Liberty

Agreed - Asst. Secretary of the Navy isn't what most of us think of as

&gt;Or, to put another way, every President from Kennedy to the elder Bush

I'd argue that's about as firm as FDR's.

&gt;&gt; certainly more US presidents have been military veterans than

&gt;Astoundingly no Canadian Prime Minister saw combat in WWII, admittedly
&gt;in large part to Trudeau (who got expelled from Canadian
&gt;officer-training school during WWII)'s lengthy tenure. The last
&gt;military veteran was Pearson (!), who fought in WWI.

&gt;&gt; It's within the BoP as to the extent Bush 43 served in the USAF
&gt;&gt; though I cannot recall any POTUS besides Bush 43 with USAF
&gt;&gt; experience.

&gt;Eisenhower had a pilot's license but the two Bushes are the only two
&gt;Presidents with military air-combat training and the elder is the only
&gt;one with air-combat experience.
">

Hmm. Didn't know that about Ike - obviously that doesn't make him a
non-Army man but it's useful to know about. Bush 41 of course played a
role at the Marianas and various other places with distinction.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; (Washington, Jackson, Grant, T Roosevelt, Truman and Ike all were
&gt;&gt; Army of course and I've doubtless missed several others.)

&gt;During the first half of the 19th century having active-duty military
&gt;service in the Revolution, War of 1812, Mexican War, or miscellaneous
&gt;Indian wars was always helpful in campaigning. During the post-Civil
&gt;War period, every President from Grant to McKinley except Cleveland
&gt;served in the Union Army.

&gt;Kennedy was the first active-duty naval officer to become President,
&gt;which is surprising (especially given the above-mentioned streak), but
&gt;perhaps not that much so. How many 19th-century naval officers
&gt;could've plausibly become President from a SHWI viewpoint? I can only
&gt;think of three: Oliver Hazard Perry, David Farragut, and George Dewey
&gt;(who saw a brief draft attempt for 1900).
">

I can't think of any others. However the switch in preferred services
for POTUS from the 19th to 20th centuries probably says more about the
fact that the USA had become a naval power in the 20th century while
post-WW2 none of the USA's land combats were remotely on the scale of
WW1/WW2 to make service in them pretty much mandatory for presidential
candidates. I'm not denigrating politicians with Vietnam service -
just saying there weren't as many of them as with the WW1 and WW2
cadres.

Churchill called himself 'Naval Person' and then
'Former Naval Person' in his private letters to
FDR.

Adlai Stevenson II was a Navy enlisted man in WW I.

Ed Muskie and Sargent Shriver were Navy Lieutenants.

Tom Eagleton enlisted in the U.S. Navy for two years.

So the "Navy streak" was even wider than it first
appears.

I beg to differ. Only pacifists and draft dodgers go to college,
instead of joining the military. The greatest sign of patriotism is
joining the armed forces, because it is a sign that you care about

How about reading the message that I posted in full and noticing that
I specified my comment on the country that _I_ was living in, you
fucking idiot? That, and noticing that I have a ".fi" at the end of my
adress, you dimwit?

An overwhelming majority of young men in this country fulfill their
national service, whether military or civil, at the age of eighteen to
twenty, _before_ they continue their studies. That's a fact, however
much you may "beg to differ". Period.

By the way, just to let you know, I have an academic degree, I've done
my time in the military like eight out of ten men in this country, and
also spent a few months doing civilian work for the armed forces
afterwards.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Does this include also those fellows whom I met in the service and who
were lining up in front of the garrison hospital faking sick every
bloody morning because, gosh, they just didn't feel like participating
in the march, the combat exercise, the camp or whatever else may have
been scheduled for that day?

No doubt they were dedicated patriots and loyal servicemen, as long as
being patriotic and wearing the uniform didn't require them to make
any physical efforts.

Maybe some kind of Pearl Harbor/9/11-style assault on the USA in the

I remember one of the first news reports after the real 9/11 showed many

No offense, but "my country, right or wrong" is only a _truely_ patrotic

Well, Jack, that's because, as anyone with an ounce of critical
thinking can tell you, that the current crop of ads aren't aimed at
the kids who are volunteering to go to war. They're a soft cushion for
the parents who were college-age-ish during the Vietnam War, and know
better about "volunteering" for a "war to save civilization" in some
foreign land.

The commercials suggest that the army is just a loan program to go to
college, will straighten out your troubled kid, whatever, to feed a
fun range of delusions that don't acknowledge that the kids are going
to be packed off to Karbala or something with no body armor and
possibly no rifles, to kill civilians and die for war profiteering and
lies.

This has been leftist soapbox, brought to you by the reality based
community.

Best
