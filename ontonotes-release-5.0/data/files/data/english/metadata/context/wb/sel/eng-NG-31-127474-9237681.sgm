Atheists and skeptics voice questions of the kind you quoted above,
with a view to sowing the seeds of doubt in the minds of believers.
If
we analyze those questions, we can see they are in fact nonsensical
ones based on absurd premises.

Consider the first question: &quot;Who created Allah?&quot;

The first premise underlying the question is that every thing (or
being) known to exist in the world was created. The second premise is
that Allah is known to exist in the world. So the conclusion is that
Allah also was created.

In fact, there are problems with the second premise as well as the
conclusion. The point is that Allah does not exist in the world
unlike
material objects or physical beings. Allah's existence transcends the
world of space and time, as it is He Who has created not only all the
objects and beings of the world, but also all the laws of space and
time governing material and temporal existence.

In other words, Allah is beyond the limits and constraints of space
and time and so He is not subject to the physical rules and norms
that
determine the nature of things and beings in the visible world.

We can view the issue from another angle. If everything in the
universe needs a cause, then Allah also needs a cause.

It is important to note here that everything in the universe has a
beginning; it is because of this that everything needs a cause,
whereas Allah does not have a beginning and He does not need a cause.

Einstein has shown that time is the fourth dimension contiguous with
space. In other words, we live in a world that is a space-time
continuum.

And as Allah is the Creator of time as well as space, He is not
limited either by space or time, so He has no beginning in time.
Therefore, He does not have a cause.

Also, there is enough evidence that the universe had a beginning.
This
can be shown from the laws of thermodynamics, the most fundamental
laws of the physical sciences.

Now the question is: Is it possible to have a universe with a
beginning, but without a cause?

The answer is obviously in the negative for the following reasons:

It is self-evident that things that begin have a cause. Indeed, no
science is possible without the law of cause and effect, and the
study
of history would not make sense if causes do not lead to effects.
What
is more is that we cannot hold the absurd logical position that the
universe created itself, because nothing comes out of nothing!

In short, to the question, &quot;Who created Allah?&quot; we can give this
answer: By definition, Allah is the First Cause and the Uncreated
Creator of all. For everything to exist or begin to be, a Ground of
Being is necessary, and Allah is the Ground of Being. So without
Allah, nothing can be, nothing is possible. So the question &quot;Who
created Allah?&quot; is nonsensical; it takes us nowhere; it is a
meaningless question somewhat like &quot;What is the color of music?&quot;

The second question you quoted is as illogical as the first one: &quot;Can
Allah create something He cannot destroy?&quot; Or, it can be put this
way:
&quot;Can Allah make a rock too big for Him to lift?&quot;

There are many variations to this question, but they all present the
same dilemma. If Allah cannot make a rock too big for Him to lift,
then it proves that Allah is not all-powerful because there is
something He cannot do. If Allah can create a rock that is too big
for
Him to lift, again it proves that He is not all-powerful because He
cannot lift the rock!

Or as you put it, if Allah cannot create something that He cannot
destroy, He is not Omnipotent. If He can create something that He
cannot destroy, then again He is not Omnipotent!

Indeed, the question here is one of logical impossibility: Can an
omnipotent God do anything and everything, including what is
logically
impossible?

Many religious people may think so; for them this is what omnipotence
amounts to. Some Christians may quote the Bible:

With God all things are possible. (Mark 10:27)

and they maintain that we should never say, &quot;God cannot do this or
that.&quot;

There are people who say that God could bring about even logical
impossibilities, such as creating a square circle. This alone is
enough for us to reject any view that implies an absurdity. For
example, can we assume at this moment, at this place that it is both
day and night at the same time?

If we say &quot;yes,&quot; obviously we are trashing logic and reason. We
should
be wise enough to accept the reliability of reason and logic here as
elsewhere. Proper understanding and communication rest on the
principle of non-contradiction - that no statement is both true and
false at the same time. What could it mean if we are told that not
only can God create logical impossibilities but also cannot create
them?

If we do not presuppose the principle of non-contradiction in our
discussions, it is difficult to understand what we were saying and
what we mean to say. Therefore, accepting the principle of non-
contradiction is crucial to any meaningful discussion. Further, it is
hard to make sense of a God to whom the principle of non-
contradiction
does not apply.

The question above represents what we may call a false dilemma. It is
based on a false premise, where people assume Allah's omnipotence to
mean that Allah can do anything. But as a matter of fact, since Allah
is Perfect there are things Allah cannot do because they imply some
sort of imperfection. For example, He cannot lie, err, sin, or die
because these actions are contrary to His nature. So, Allah will
never
act in a way that is contrary to who He is.

I disagree. My intent is not to change the minds of believers, but to
learn. Most often atheists are accused of not adequately understanding
the issues at hand when it comes to religion. I have a vested interest
in assuring that my beliefs are based in a good understanding of the
world around me.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Premises are generally statements from which conclusions are drawn.
Questions are not conclusions so I'm wary to say that they are based
on premises.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Consider the first question: &quot;Who created Allah?&quot;
">

I'm not sure that anyone asks this as a first question. Generally such
questions are asked in response to the &quot;first creator&quot; argument, that
everything we see was created by something else, which was created by
something else, which was created by something else, ad infinitum.
Theists remove the infinite regression by inserting God x years ago
(usually x is some arbitrary number). The question is an attempt to
resolve the apparent conflict. If everything must have a creator, then
what created the creator? The answer is that for some inexplicable
reason, God is exempt from this rule. They then fail to explain why
the universe itself cannot be exempt from this rule.

Exactly. But what you fail to acknowledge is that these premises (that
everything needs a cause) are brought to the table by the theists, not
the atheists.

Theists establish the premise that all things need a cause.
Theists establish the premise that God exists.
Theists establish the premise that God is the first cause and does not
need a cause himself.

Atheists simply ask questions to resolve conflicts that these premises
create. No atheist accepts these premises.

&gt; beginning; it is because of this that everything needs a cause,

Except that it is not known that everything has a beginning or needs a
cause. This is a premise put forth by theists.

This is fallacious reasoning. First, what is self-evident is not
necessarily true. Early natural philosophy was based largely on things
that were apparently &quot;self-evident&quot;.
The Earth was still and the sun revolved around it. Objects in motion
will naturally come to rest. The stars in the night sky were fixed.
They were taken as self-evident because of the axiom that the universe
is as it appears to be and we lacked, at the time, other ways to
determine the motion of the Earth, Sun, Stars and objects.

When we obtained more sophisticated methods and technologies, we
discovered that the Earth revolves around the sun, the solar system
around the galactic center, the galaxy around the center of gravity of
the local cluster, etc. We discovered that objects in motion will stay
in motion, but come to rest on Earth due to the force of gravity, we
discovered that stars are not fixed and move as we move. We discovered
that some of those &quot;stars&quot; are galaxies that are actually mostly
moving away from us.

So, just as it &quot;was&quot; self-evident that the universe is causal (that
is, deterministic) we now know, through the advent of quantum
mechanics, that at certain scales and under certain conditions, the
universe is *not* causal or deterministic. It so happens that these
scales and conditions dominate the early universe. Likewise we do see
that stuff can come from nothing under quantum mechanical conditions.

Indeed it is nonsensical because there is no reason or need to posit
the existence of an uncreated first cause because it is not known that
one is necessary to explain the existence of the universe and there
are no other observations that lead to the support of the existence of
one.

Dr _Not-so-cool,

In your particular reference to god, the actual truth you will
not wish to hear is, that he was copied from various religions
among them Arabic, Jewish and Christian, by some bloke
known to you as Mohammed. He was a roving salesman,
and he used to travel with his camel train around the
Mediteranian. That was way back in the 7th century.
Mum and Dad brought him up religiously, but when he
was about forty, being disatisfied with the state of the
morality of the day; he ups and decides he is going to
have a bash at changing things. He thought a completely
new doctrine was called for and the best way to get his
ideas across was to start preaching. Some might say a
laudable ambition. He extolled the idea of one absolute
god ruler, and judge of the world,. He denounced Idolatry
and infanticide. But for years he was a complete flop at
preaching; no-one took a blind bit of notice of him, so he
chucked it in Mecca and rushed off to Yathrib, later called
Medina, so he says to himself I know what will make the
bastards listen, I'll but me an army, round up the people
and make them listen. That was in 622 and he never
looked back from then on, but he bacame power-crazed
and started to  seek extention of his powers to surrounding
countries. The rest is more history you can read for yourself.
When he snuffed it; his teachings were assembled into
what we now know as the Koran, there are several spellings
of the name of the Islamic bible.
So your god, or your allah was invented by Mohammed who
pinched it from Jews and Christians who pinched the idea
of gods from ancient pagan history. Read all about it by
visiting my profile.

That was the origin of the creation of Allah by Lawrey. ;))
