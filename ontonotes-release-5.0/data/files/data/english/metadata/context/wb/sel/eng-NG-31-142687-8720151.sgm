WHY THE ACLU DOES WHAT IT DOES

The ACLU's goal is to destroy the USA and then usher in Marxism or
some form of radical Socialism.  Anything that hurts the USA, the ACLU
will support.
Some examples of how the ACLU operates...
The ACLU vigorously defends illegal aliens not because they care about
these illegal immigrants but because they view illegals as a
destructive &amp; financially draining force on the United States.  The
more illegals in the U.S. (and the more social freebies they get) is
all good news to the ACLU.  The more illegals = the faster the USA
will rot from within.
Also, anything that damages the social fabric of the U.S. will of
course weaken it.  This is why, for example, the ACLU attacks the boy
scouts as well as anything related to the nuclear family, church,
etc.  Also, the ACLU defends Islam and Muslims because Islam is a
negative force within the U.S. (Muslim culture and American culture
don't mix, to say the least).  The ACLU doesn't care one bit about
Muslims, they only see them as yet another tool to wreck this country
and cause it to rot from within.
Have you ever noticed that the ACLU constantly sues police departments
and other law enforcement agencies?  This is because the ACLU is
against law &amp; order.  Law &amp; order holds America together, so in order
to help cause the U.S. to rot, police must have their hands tied via
restrictions which keep them from doing their job.  Less law &amp; order =
more chaos which means the faster the U.S. will rot.  Along this line,
the ACLU defends violent street gangs whenever a city passes a gang
injunction.  Nothing causes social rot faster than a terrorizing
street gang, which is why the ACLU loves gangs... they see them as a
powerful weapon in bringing chaos to America's neighborhoods.  Again,
the ACLU's goal is to wreck the United States which, upon its
destruction, will pave the way for bringing about revolutionary
Marxism or some form of extreme Socialism.
Occasionally the ACLU will take a somewhat reasonable case, but this
is only to give their defenders ammunition to use against those
critical of the ACLU (ie. this is purely for PR purposes).
Make no mistake about it, the ACLU and similar groups like the
Southern Poverty Law Center and the National Lawyers Guild are
revolutionary Marxist organizations hell bent on overthrowing the
United States by using our laws against us with the cooperation of
radical leftist judges.
Finally, in light of the above, it should be noted that the ACLU was
founded by Roger Baldwin, a communist.

Law to Remedy the Distress of the People and the Empire
Der Reichstag hat das folgende Gesetz beschlossen, das mit Zustimmung des
Reichsrats hiermit verkündet wird, nachdem festgestellt ist, daß die
Erfordernisse verfassungsändernder Gesetzgebung erfüllt sind: The Reichstag
has enacted the following law, which is hereby proclaimed with the assent of
the Reichsrat, it having been established that the requirements for a
constitutional amendment have been fulfilled:
Artikel 1 Article 1
Reichsgesetze können außer in dem in der Reichsverfassung vorgesehenen
Verfahren auch durch die Reichsregierung beschlossen werden. Dies gilt auch
für die in den Artikeln 85 Abs. 2 und 87 der Reichsverfassung bezeichneten
Gesetze. In addition to the procedure prescribed by the constitution, laws
of the Reich may also be enacted by the government of the Reich. This
includes the laws referred to by Articles 85 Paragraph 2 and Article 87 of
the constitution.[1]
Artikel 2 Article 2
Die von der Reichsregierung beschlossenen Reichsgesetze können von der
Reichsverfassung abweichen, soweit sie nicht die Einrichtung des Reichstags
und des Reichsrats als solche zum Gegenstand haben. Die Rechte des
Reichspräsidenten bleiben unberührt. Laws enacted by the government of the
Reich may deviate from the constitution as long as they do not affect the
institutions of the Reichstag and the Reichsrat. The rights of the President
remain undisturbed.
Artikel 3 Article 3
Die von der Reichsregierung beschlossenen Reichsgesetze werden vom
Reichskanzler ausgefertigt und im Reichsgesetzblatt verkündet. Sie treten,
soweit sie nichts anderes bestimmen, mit dem auf die Verkündung folgenden

unless they prescribe a different date. Articles 68 to 77 of the
Constitution do not apply to laws enacted by the Reich government.[2]
Artikel 4 Article 4
Verträge des Reiches mit fremden Staaten, die sich auf Gegenstände der
Reichsgesetzgebung beziehen, bedürfen für die Dauer der Geltung dieser
Gesetze nicht der Zustimmung der an der Gesetzgebung beteiligten
Körperschaften. Die Reichsregierung erläßt die zur Durchführung dieser
Verträge erforderlichen Vorschriften. Treaties of the Reich with foreign
states which affect matters of Reich legislation shall not require the
approval of the bodies of the legislature. The government of the Reich shall
issue the regulations required for the execution of such treaties.
Artikel 5 Article 5
Dieses Gesetz tritt mit dem Tage seiner Verkündung in Kraft. Es tritt mit
dem 1. April 1937 außer Kraft, es tritt ferner außer Kraft, wenn die
gegenwärtige Reichsregierung durch eine andere abgelöst wird. This law takes
effect with the day of its proclamation. It loses force on 1 April 1937 or
if the present Reich government is replaced by another.

Baldwin was a pacifist.  Some of his other political affiliations changed
markedly during his lifetime: as a young man, he became involved in the
anarchist movement. In 1939 he was publicly denouncing the Soviets and in
the 1940's he attempted to purge Communist Party members from the ACLU.

Stuart, you are one of the most uniformed people I have ever encountered.

There is nothing to speculate about the idiot ACLU.

As usual, you are either lying or are a fucking moron.

Recent ACLU involvement in religious liberty cases include:

September 20, 2005: ACLU of New Jersey joins lawsuit supporting
second-grader's right to sing &quot;&quot;Awesome God&quot;&quot; at a talent show.

August 4, 2005: ACLU helps free a New Mexico street preacher from prison.

May 25, 2005: ACLU sues Wisconsin prison on behalf of a Muslim woman who was
forced to remove her headscarf in front of male guards and prisoners.

February 2005: ACLU of Pennsylvania successfully defends the right of an
African American Evangelical church to occupy a church building purchased in
a predominantly white parish.

If you gave hate America so much, you would understand that EVERYONE
in the USA has the right to free speech. Even scum like you and
NAMBLA.  In fact, the most important thing about this precious right
is that even the most vile speech, like your, is protected. Maybe if
you studied our system a little bit you wouldn't hate it so much.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; WHY THE ACLU DOES WHAT IT DOES

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; The ACLU's goal is to destroy the USA and then usher in Marxism or
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; some form of radical Socialism.  Anything that hurts the USA, the ACLU
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; will support.
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Some examples of how the ACLU operates...
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; The ACLU vigorously defends illegal aliens not because they care about
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; these illegal immigrants but because they view illegals as a
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; destructive &amp; financially draining force on the United States.  The
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; more illegals in the U.S. (and the more social freebies they get) is
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; all good news to the ACLU.  The more illegals = the faster the USA
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; will rot from within.
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Also, anything that damages the social fabric of the U.S. will of
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; course weaken it.  This is why, for example, the ACLU attacks the boy
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; scouts as well as anything related to the nuclear family, church,
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; etc.  Also, the ACLU defends Islam and Muslims because Islam is a
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; negative force within the U.S. (Muslim culture and American culture
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; don't mix, to say the least).  The ACLU doesn't care one bit about
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Muslims, they only see them as yet another tool to wreck this country
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; and cause it to rot from within.
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Have you ever noticed that the ACLU constantly sues police departments
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; and other law enforcement agencies?  This is because the ACLU is
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; against law &amp; order.  Law &amp; order holds America together, so in order
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; to help cause the U.S. to rot, police must have their hands tied via
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; restrictions which keep them from doing their job.  Less law &amp; order =
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; more chaos which means the faster the U.S. will rot.  Along this line,
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; the ACLU defends violent street gangs whenever a city passes a gang
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; injunction.  Nothing causes social rot faster than a terrorizing
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; street gang, which is why the ACLU loves gangs... they see them as a
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; powerful weapon in bringing chaos to America's neighborhoods.  Again,
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; the ACLU's goal is to wreck the United States which, upon its
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; destruction, will pave the way for bringing about revolutionary
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Marxism or some form of extreme Socialism.
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Occasionally the ACLU will take a somewhat reasonable case, but this
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; is only to give their defenders ammunition to use against those
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; critical of the ACLU (ie. this is purely for PR purposes).
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Make no mistake about it, the ACLU and similar groups like the
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Southern Poverty Law Center and the National Lawyers Guild are
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; revolutionary Marxist organizations hell bent on overthrowing the
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; United States by using our laws against us with the cooperation of
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; radical leftist judges.
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Finally, in light of the above, it should be noted that the ACLU was
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; founded by Roger Baldwin, a communist.
