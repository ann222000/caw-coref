More Drama for the world to witness!  :-)

Charile is now sending eMails about me to members of this
group such as Lilith. Please let me know if he does the same
to you, so all the evidence may be collected in one spot.

He's threatening to &quot;report me to immigration&quot; although my papers
are completely in order, I'm married to a US citizen for over five
years now, there's nothing whatsoever wrong with my Swiss
passport and my criminal record is squeaky clean.

I would love to give him the go ahead and say &quot;Please Do!&quot; right now,
but I'll first have to inquire with a lawyer if there would be a chance
for me to get something out of this farce.

I'm not the least interested  in seeing him prosecuted and fined for a
frivolous report, while the government gets all the money. I would want
to make sure that I could sue for compensational damages in return
and take him for whatever he's worth, which couldn't be a whole lot
but I would want my expenses covered and then some, before I
proceed on my own end.

So stay tuned for the next chapter of this travesty entitled
&quot;Wannabe 'celtic' role players running mad&quot; and make sure
not to miss the season closer!

When people go to civil court on such things the only people who gain
are the attorneys. When it's a criminal court however, then prison
terms and deportation can result. The facts are that people can only
remain in this country as long as their visas or green cards permit
them to be here. If they are here longer than that then they've
violated their visa and can be deported. If they've defaced or altered
their passports or other documents to stay here longer or to get some
other privilege only reserved to citizens then they are an illegal
immigrant. Admittedly, the U.S. government is very lax about
immigration, even nowadays. Illegal immigration is a real problem and
is getting worse all the time.

If we were to go to court over this matter, whether civil or criminal,
I will stand by what I've said about Dan's passport; about what he
said to me; what I saw in his passport when he showed me where he had
changed it; the details of our discussion relative to how he'd been
able to stay in the U.S. for such extended periods of time and other
matters. It's not my intention to get him deported or arrested about
his passport but it is my intention to call to his attention that
there are real matters and imagined ones. He'd best get back to
reality or his actions will cause him problems in court, in his
visitor status, perhaps in his marital status and his place of
residence.

I haven't turned him in and probably should have but that smacks too
much of police state Gestapo thinking and actions to me. All this talk
about law suits makes me think that the lawyers in Alabama and Nevada
will soon be wearing expensive new clothes if it is pursued and no one
will get anything else out of it. In the U.S. passports are maintained
for either 10 or 15 years (most likely 10 haven't looked lately) so
Dan's marked up passport may already have been officially retired by
the Swiss government if that's the case there like here. What won't go
away are the travel records of the airlines and the Customs officials.
Those are maintained in computer databases that can confirm when where
and how long a person who uses passports has been here. The visas
granted by the U.S. government are also maintained in government
databases. It would be a simple matter to cross check Dan's visas with
his entry and exit times from the U.S.  These would reveal if he had
overstayed his visa times in the past. If the passport were gone or
destroyed, Dan would still have to explain how he got through customs
with a passport that did not allow him to do so (if it was not
altered). I'm confident enough in the records databases and the
ability to check these records not to worry about whether Dan's
violations could be proven.

My major concern would be the outlay of money to lawyers over the year
or two it would take to resolve this matter in civil court and getting
reimbursed for their costs, court costs, travel and technical expenses
as well as other damages. We're talking perhaps a $100,000 in money
here on both sides just for costs and not even including damages.  I'm
willing to spend that amount of money to protect and defend myself
from Dan's actions because I'm confident that he's in the wrong here
and that I can prove it and also that I can recoup the expenses from
him. It'd work a real hardship on Dan's family to have to pay this
kind of money but that's his choice if he wants to initiate such
actions. If his lawyer is a good one and the least bit fair, I'm
certain that he or she will explain this to him.

I've had to o to court before to get people to stop stealing materials
from the Summerlands. In those cases, the costs were only a few
thousands of dollars because the matter was resolved outside of court.
I'm willing to spend what it takes to defend mine and ours from any
and all unscrupulous and misguided people. I've done it before and
will most likely have to do it again.

Noinden,

If you haven't altered your passport to be here illegally then you shouldn't
have anything to worry about. I saw wwhere Dan had altered his when he
showed it to me and described how he'd done it. ISTM that this all came up
when discussing a show I'd seen where another artist was drawing his own
money and paying for things with it. Folks would take his &quot;money&quot; because it
was such a novelty item (and the &quot;money&quot; really was a work of art). Dan
wanted to brag about how he could do something similar with his passport.
Beats me why he'd pull such a stunt. I didn't turn him in then and I'm not
doing it now, so I guess &quot;low&quot; is relative to the facts and the truth of the
matter. Is it low to expect people to abide by our immigration laws?

I'm going to have to inform you all these off-topic pronouncements
and allegations from the fantasy land in your head are now being
collected for possible evaluation by a *real* judge of a *real* court
according to *real* law.

This is ARD and my private life is of no concern here. You on the
other hand claim to be a &quot;Druid&quot; and an &quot;authority&quot; which makes
all responses to this claim as on-topic as it gets:

Mr. Charles Devane you are a liar, a cheat, a charlatan and the
biggest coward I've ever encountered in my whole life. Your
credentials are self assumed, this bastard religion you're trying
to push as authentic ancient &quot;celtic&quot; is completely phoney and
your repeated demonstrated inability to tell reality from wishful
thinking and fantasy is an indicator you're not right in the head.

Please do me the favour and do not stop here. I've got nothing
to hide, nothing to fear and the more alleged dirt you publish
about my private life, the deeper you dig yourself into the cesspool
which is your time-and-again demonstrated modus operandi.

Dan

&gt; Noinden,

&gt; If you haven't altered your passport to be here illegally then you
&gt; shouldn't have anything to worry about. I saw wwhere Dan had altered his
&gt; when he showed it to me and described how he'd done it. ISTM that this all
&gt; came up when discussing a show I'd seen where another artist was drawing
&gt; his own money and paying for things with it. Folks would take his &quot;money&quot;
&gt; because it was such a novelty item (and the &quot;money&quot; really was a work of
&gt; art). Dan wanted to brag about how he could do something similar with his
&gt; passport. Beats me why he'd pull such a stunt. I didn't turn him in then
&gt; and I'm not doing it now, so I guess &quot;low&quot; is relative to the facts and
&gt; the truth of the matter. Is it low to expect people to abide by our
&gt; immigration laws?

Dan!

Keep an archive of all the slander he has said about you and even myself.

The time may come when you shall be glad you did.

He is a stinking low life coward.

&gt; I'm going to have to inform you all these off-topic pronouncements
&gt; and allegations from the fantasy land in your head are now being
&gt; collected for possible evaluation by a *real* judge of a *real* court
&gt; according to *real* law.

&gt; This is ARD and my private life is of no concern here. You on the
&gt; other hand claim to be a &quot;Druid&quot; and an &quot;authority&quot; which makes
&gt; all responses to this claim as on-topic as it gets:

&gt; Mr. Charles Devane you are a liar, a cheat, a charlatan and the
&gt; biggest coward I've ever encountered in my whole life. Your
&gt; credentials are self assumed, this bastard religion you're trying
&gt; to push as authentic ancient &quot;celtic&quot; is completely phoney and
&gt; your repeated demonstrated inability to tell reality from wishful
&gt; thinking and fantasy is an indicator you're not right in the head.

&gt; Please do me the favour and do not stop here. I've got nothing
&gt; to hide, nothing to fear and the more alleged dirt you publish
&gt; about my private life, the deeper you dig yourself into the cesspool
&gt; which is your time-and-again demonstrated modus operandi.

Oh and point of order. As a Druid (neopagan or other) you really would
be honor bound to the people (American in this case as you are an
American Druid and seem to care about the people) to have turned him
in straight away.

I know the pair of you are at &quot;war&quot; blah blah blah, I got chastised
for my one with Daivd Lloyd Willarad (aka Talesin or the cunning
linguist) that lasted a Decaded, I get it. But come on, either do or
do not. Don't threaten and do your Dr Doom impersination (an oblique
reverence to the silver age version of the Villian who was all
menacing and  talk rather than action).

Oh and lay of the damn Greencard holders. to quote the White stripes
in Icky thump:

Well, Americans:
What, nothin' better to do?
Why don't you kick yourself out?
You're an immigrant too.

Who's usin' who?
What should we do?
Well you can't be a pimp
And a prostitute too
