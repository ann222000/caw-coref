Car Trivia (answers are later in this email)

1) A few years ago, Volkswagen got a lot of mileage out of the word
Fahvegnuegen. What does Fahvegnuegen mean?

2) The Formula 1 race at Indy last year was a farce. The F1 there this year
was once again won by Michael Schumacher (that's gonna change); now they are
talking about no more F1 races there after 2007. Once again, the U.S. will
be looking for someplace to run Formula 1. How many tracks in America have
hosted the F1? (More than I would have guessed.)

3) Every Car Guy can roll off names of people in their favorite area of the
car world, but how are you with Big Guys in the automotive world overall? Do
you know the full name of these car company giants? For example, Ford and
Ferrari are Henry Ford and Enzo Ferrari.
Company Builders:
Bentley
Benz
Bugatti
Buick
Chevrolet
Chrysler
Cooper
Delorean
Healey
Kaiser
McLaren
Oldsmobile

4) What meter was invented by C.C. Magee in 1935? It has affected us all,
not necessarily in a good way.

5) In the 1800's, what was seen as an end to the pollution problem in big
cities?

--- Retreads ---

These next three questions are from over two years ago. If you remember them
from before, consider this a memory test.

6) GM had a car celebrating its 50th birthday in 2003. The first model
sported a toothy grill on its rather blunt nose, round exposed wheel wells,
and came only in an open top with an automatic transmission. It got its name
from a Hoagie Carmichael song. What car is it?

7) What famous Formula 1 driver started his driving career with the name
A.N. Other?

8) We all know Ford's classic Thunderbird, but what is lovingly known as the
E-bird?

And the last two are from four years ago.

9) Where do the initials ACBC on the Lotus cars come from?

10) What was the original name of the Mustang?
(Heck, I didn't even know there WAS an original name.)

*Cars on DVD

Cars: The animated film about Cars, for Car Guys, by Car Guys. If you have
read anything about this film, you know it is full of neat stuff and great
voice choices for the characters of the film:

Paul Newman as Doc Hudson

They copied the Hudson color from a Hudson Mfg. paint chip.

Richard Petty as 'The King' a Plymouth Superbird

The car matches Petty's '70 NASCAR racer

Larry the Cable Guy as the tow truck, Mater

George Carlin as Filmore, the Hippy Dippy VW van

The Filmore was a theatre where many great bands of the 60's performed.

Cheech Marin as the '59 Chevy Impala Low Rider

Darrell Waltrip as the race announcer

Mario Andretti as his old Ford stock car.
Michael Schumacher as, you guessed it, a Ferrari.

Listen for other Car Guys, including Dale Earnhardt Jr. Humpy Wheeler, Jay
Leno and many more. You will hear Rascal Flatts (Life Is A Highway), Sheryl
Crow (Real gone), Brad Paisley (Behind The clouds), and a classic from The
Clouds (Sh-Boom).

The mountains in the background are a copy of Cadillac Ranch, you will
probably remember the guy that stuck ten Cadillacs nose down in the ground
with their tailfins jutting into the air. A '46 Willys CJ-2 A, a '49
Mercury, a Model T, and a '59 Fiat are just a few cars that you may
recognize. The tires on McQueen's car are Lightyear Buzzards in reference to
Goodyear Eagles. These are just a taste of the things you may notice
watching this film. .

It will be released November 7th. The retail price is 29.95. Our New Item
Price is 23.95. Pre-Order now and we will ship so you receive it November
7th, the first day available to the public.

The diecast collectors from our retail shop will remember the great Giovanni
cases we carried. They have all the diecast sizes from 1:64 to 1:18 and more
odd sizes than you can count. We still supply them for a few of our
customers. And we can do the same for you. Find the case you want on
Giovanni's website, contact us, and we will have it shipped directly to your

Formula 1

Michael Schumacher has finally decided to hang up his helmet. Or was he
pushed? Now, there is talk that he will stay with Ferrari, possibly for
testing. That's good; he was instrumental in making the Ferrari team what it
is today. And his communication with the team setting up the cars is
exceptional. The post race interviews will change drastically, as was
evident in the interview when he so eloquently said he was retiring, his
announcement was then followed by his replacement, Kimi, a good driver but
definitely not a good interview.

==================== ** ====================

This month, our 'MY FAVORITE CAR' story is by our friend, Bob O.

A Tale of Two Athens Natives (me and my King Midget)

A King Midget is a small two-seat roadster with semi-monocoque construction
and a rear-mounted 12-hp Kohler air-cooled engine driving the right rear
wheel through a two-speed automatic transmission using a pair of centrifugal
clutches. It's a street-legal car that was built in Athens, Ohio from
1946-1970. Many people remember their ads in Mechanics Illustrated, etc.
Strangely enough though, the cars were not sold within 50 miles of Athens,
to keep the production volume under control (roughly 30 cars per month or
so).

(Due to Spam Programs, we do not show pictures in our email newsletter. See
our newsletter on our web for pictures of Bob's King Midget.)

Although I was born and raised in Athens, and lived about a mile from where
they were built, I never actually saw a King Midget until I was 10 years
old. That was on a family vacation at the Pioneer Auto Museum in Murdo, SD.
I will never forget how exciting it was for me to see my hometown's name
stamped on that little nameplate. Apparently, the museum (now the Pioneer
Autoshow) still has a 1961 King Midget listed on their website.

I had casually thought about trying to find a King Midget of my own but
never really put any effort into it. When I discovered the International
King Midget Car Club website (IKMCC) and its classified ads, I began
thinking a bit more seriously about buying a car, but there always seemed to
be lots of people looking and nobody selling.

This spring, my mother-in-law emailed photos of three rusty King Midget
Model 3's that her car-collector neighbor had just trailered home. I then
heard that the 2006 Jamboree would be in Athens. Having never attended a
Jamboree or even heard a King Midget run before, I decided to go see if any
cars might be available.

A couple of weeks before the Jamboree, I found my car on the IKMCC site. It
is a red 1966 Model 3, serial K660392, which was once a part of the Hemmings
Motor News collection. The seller, Patrick Parent, bought the car from
Hemmings in 2004. It is just one of a string of collector vehicles he has
owned over the years, including a Rolls Royce and a pair of Cadillacs. His
father, Roland Parent, had been a King Midget rider agent in Maine during
the 1960's and once owned a cream-colored Model 3. Patrick told us his
memories of riding in that car and how the new cars were delivered in crates
that had to be returned to the factory.

The Hemmings logos are nicely sign-painted in two colors, with black or
brick-red "shadows" under the yellow letters. Someone at Hemmings was
supposed to remove the markings before they sold the car. But they were left
on because Patrick intended to return the car to its original cream color.
But Patrick decided to preserve the Hemmings paint scheme due to its
historical significance. Other than the paint, the car is almost entirely
original, including the top and the side curtains. The curtains and support
rods were found tucked away in a barn at Hemmings when they sold the car.

The car has a dash plaque from a 1987 Vermont auto show and a 2002 Vermont
inspection sticker on the windshield. A gentleman we met at the Jamboree was
kind enough to send us a 1991 Hemmings holiday card with a painting of the
car. I also found a beautiful color photo of it in The Hemmings Book of
Postwar American Independents.

(See this card on our web newsletter.)

To me, the car represents a piece of hometown history, as well as an
interesting artifact from a significant car collection. Bob Vahsholtz, who
publishes a King Midget newsletter, thinks it was probably built in May
1966, the same year and month that I was born. I recently took the car to NJ
to meet up with some guys from microcar.org and take a "microcar cruise".

(See a picture of the Microcars on our web newsletter.)

-- If you have fond memories of one of your fine machines and would like to
tell us about it, send us your story, and, when we use it, you will have
your pick of any item we have on our web.

* Bits and Pieces

Do not get rid of your VHS machines; there are many great automotive videos
that are available on VHS tape and not scheduled to be put on DVD. And for
those of you finding it difficult to find new blank tapes, we carry the
Maxell tapes.

Our friend, Greg, sent this note:

I have a Randy Owens piece "and Everyone Else" Number 100/135 (print 100 of
135). It is signed by Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost. I purchased it in 1989
at the Montreal GP. I would like to know the value. It is now in a simple
black frame and is matted. Thank you.

Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost were one of the greatest rivalries in Formula 1
history. To get both signatures on one poster is quite a feat. If you are
interested, send me an email, and I will forward it on to Greg.

At Amelia Island, Oscar Kovaleski told of when he had a competition Ferrari
with quite inadequate brakes. His mechanic, Jack Daren (sic) told him
'I can give you a brake light.'
'What the hell do I need a brake light for!?'
'Well, I will also give you a button to the brake light. When you come into
a corner, you keep the pedal floored and hit the brake light button, and all
the cars behind you will lift.'

***
Just Do It!
If you live in Virginia or any of the surrounding states, now is the time to
take a day-trip (or longer if you can swing it) to Skyline Drive. We just
spent a day there and can't wait to go back. And the next few weeks will be
even more stunning as the trees dress in their fall colors.

(See a current picture from one of the 75 overlooks on our web newsletter.)

Leave your problems behind for the day. This is a road begging to be driven,
it is in perfect condition, well marked, very few intersections, no traffic
lights, just 100 miles of graceful tree-lined curves. Stop at a few of the
scenic overlook areas. Take in the valleys below and mountains in the
distance. Many of the pull-offs are over 3000 feet up, views you normally
only see from a plane. Take your camera or at least your binoculars. There's
also something you city-dwellers may not recognize: Clear Air. Eat at one of
the historic lodges; be sure to get a seat by the huge panoramic windows.

But, of course, you are too busy, you have to clean out the garage, rake the
leaves, visit your in-laws, catch up at work, spend more time in the rat
race. Maybe next year. Or the next, yadda yadda yadda. Just go. If you don't
go this year, Skyline Drive won't miss you, but you will be missing it.

Car Trivia Answers

1) Fahvegnuegen means Driving Pleasure. They have put out quite a few
vehicles that would have people agreeing with that statement.

2) The American Formula 1 Grand Prix has run at the following tracks:
Dallas
Detroit
Las Vegas
Long Beach
Phoenix
Riverside
Roosevelt Raceway
San Francisco
Santa Monica
Savannah
Sebring
Watkins Glen
That's twelve tracks.
(From http://www.ddavid.com/formula1/story.htm )

3) The Company Builders' full names are:
Bentley, Walter O.
Benz, Karl
Bugatti, Ettore
Buick, David Dunbar
Chevrolet, Louis (Louis didn't actually start Chevrolet, he was a driver for
GM.)
Chrysler, Walter P.
Cooper, John
Delorean, John Z.
Healey, Donald
Kaiser, Henry J. (Now you know where the Henry J got its name.)
McLaren, Bruce
Oldsmobile, Ransom E. (Olds)
(Thanks to our friend, Ken G.)
That was fun; next issue, we will try famous drivers.

4) In 1935, C.C. Magee invented the Parking Meter.
(Thanks to Trivial Pursuit Genus I.)

5) The growing popularity of the automobile was seen as a godsend to rid big
cities of the pollution of the hundreds of horses fouling the streets every
day and night. It sounded like a good idea at the time.

--- Retreads ---

6) In 1953, Buick brought out its very popular and flashy Buick Skylark.
Hoagie Carmichael (Star Dust) and Johnny Mercer (Blues in the Night) got
together for the song Skylark.
(Thanks in part to AutoWeek for this one.)

7) After his older brother was seriously hurt in motor racing, Jackie
Stewart was told by his mother that he could no longer be running around
driving race cars. Obviously, that did not last long. Jackie had a job as a
team mechanic, and when he went from there to driving (a normal progression
then), he went by the name A.N. Other. As time went on and he became more
famous, he used his own name, but he and his mother never ever mentioned
what he did for a living. Years later, at the end of his long and prosperous
career as a driver, he told his mother that he had retired from driving, and
she said: "You're better off for it!" And the subject was never discussed
between them again.
(As told by Jackie at the Smithsonian Institute, June 17, 2003.)

8) The two-seat Thunderbird came with four different engines; they were
identified on their vehicle identification number by the first letter: C, D,
E, &amp; F. Among T-bird owners they are called:
C-bird 289 ci engine
D-bird 312 ci engine
E-bird 312 ci engine with two four-barrel carburetors
F-bird 312 ci engine with a supercharger
(Thanks to our friend, Leon Y., a true T-bird lover.)

9) The initials ACBC on the Lotus cars are for its founder, Anthony Colin
Brown Chapman. And I can think of at least four of you guys who knew this
one.
(Thanks to our friend, Jeff, for this one.)

10) What was the original name of the Mustang? Cougar. Now we know where
Mercury got it.
(Thanks to our friend, Ed, a true Ford Enthusiast, for this one.)
