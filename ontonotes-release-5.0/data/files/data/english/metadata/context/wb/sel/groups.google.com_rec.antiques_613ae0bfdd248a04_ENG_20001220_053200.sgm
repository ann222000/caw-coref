Does anyone know of a collector's guide for antique chocolate pot
sets? I've not been able to find one anywhere.

Chocolate sets are heavily reproduced and if I chanced to run across one,
the first place I'd check would be Castle Reproductions, where, as they
will cheerily inform you, you can buy this stuff by the truckload.

It can be tough finding a book on a collecting interest when you've no
idea what the title might be. I had quite a bit of trouble locating
a book on antique cameos as a Christmas gift for Mom. It would have been
even harder in the pre-Internet days, though.

You do have to have a business card and a resale #.
It's good to have just to see the quality and availability of the different
repro items.
It's scary how good some of the pictures look.
It will also remind you of a good many mall inventories?????

"/> Hi Charleen--

The Castle place really needs to be experienced with about a half day visit,
although I do remember something similar in the LA area but with much more
clever fakes and repros. But if you do go to the Castle they describe it
romantically-I thought it a depressing place where the kids from that area
found low wage employment as there is little other industry in the area; I
think it's last major use was as a stocking factory. If you've seen the mill
factories in places like Lowell (MA) you'll be able to get the image. The
surrounding countryside is very pretty. I used to hit it as a mental health
break after driving the length (maybe 300+ miles) of I-80 along the sparsely
populated north country of Pennsylvania. where you can often meet deer
standing in the middle of an Interstate off ramp and where some of these
exits have large signs warning &quot;No Services This Exit.&quot; and the big towns you
might see advertised have names like &quot;Snowshoe.&quot; These trips were usually to
sell trinkets, wampum and more than a few antiques at the big New York State
Fire Chief's Convention at the huge, old, but tired Concord Hotel smack in
the the Borsht Belt of the Catskills region. (It-the show- has since moved to
Syracuse) Great variety of meals in a full American Plan scheme, all Kosher,
all the time. One seating at dinner-where they could serve 6400 people if
pushed but our crowd was closer to 3500. (The tour of the kitchen system was
amazing) The adventures at the Concord will be for another rambling post when
there's no traffic on RA and people will read anything just to be comforted
they haven't been booted out of our little Pub.

Anyway, if you (or more likely lurkers) do go to the Castle, schedule enough
time to go south of there and hit &quot;Fred and Dottie's&quot; on Rte 422 between
Reading and Pottstown. Much smaller than the Castle but maybe a notch up on
the quality scale. Maybe Ashley has been there and can describe the
interesting machine in the basement; but maybe not. Be prepared to prove
you're from a real retail business they can be tough. Heading east on 422
See the &quot;Mary Merritt's Doll Museum&quot; and the folks there can direct you to
the Merritt's complex itself in Douglassville- just a few miles in a pretty
country area. Their main business used to be selling clocks and repair parts
since 1938 that's how I know them- but now have branched out into lots of
container loads of &quot;antiques&quot;-some good, much just scrubbed pine- plus things
brought to them from neighboring towns and hamlets. All in all this tour
could take two days and even more if you schedule it when the Renninger's or
Shupp's Grove shows are on nearby or in the Renninger's Extravaganza over in
Kutztown. That has to be experienced at least once, along with Brimfield and
Madison-Bouckville. I think you're not really a Northeastern Dealer until
you've done most of them in one year and lived to tell the stories over the
winter of our discontent. Might be easier just to move there. Did have one
spooky experience connected to Merritt's; I bought from them a nice tulip
style leather Fire Bucket from the western PA community of Uniontown with the
owner's name and a date of about 1830. Buckets have the owner's name as right
after the scary cry of &quot;Fire&quot; came the call &quot;Throw out your buckets&quot; as towns
with Bucket Brigades usually had an Ordinance that every householder had to
have at least two properly made and maintained fire buckets; so even if you
weren't up to the rigors of the Bucket Brigade you still stumbled down the
stairs and threw your buckets out into the street. No name on it? Your chance
of retrieving it was pretty slim, but someone stealing a labeled bucket was
treated about the same as a horse thief. BTW, the idea that the Brigade just
filled them at the village pond and tossed the water on the fire was outdated
by then; the problem was that most of the early hand pumpers didn't properly
draw water very well from ponds or cisterns so the the Brigade 's job was to
dump water into a tank on the pump so the fire laddies could work the hand
operated pump levers-often called &quot;Man Breaker's&quot; as it was vigorous aerobic
exercise with maybe 10 men on each side of the pump.

Anyway, I had a really nice book picker that worked on a 20% markup and our
deal was he would bring me any fire related book and with that price and we
would buy it with no quibbling. Win some- lose some. Once he was really
excited about a booklet he got in the wilds of rural Quebec. I thus ended up
buying back a copy of our own 1983 catalog for $4.80 but just smiled and
thanked him as usual. He died about 1992 at least 85 years old. And none of
the family had any clue where he dug up all these books but he would be gone
for weeks, sometimes with a grandchild, and come home with his station wagon
straining under the load. He had a wonderful life and everybody benefited
because nobody got greedy. Anyway, he would often leave boxes of things on
our back (covered) porch In Plymouth MI-about an hour from his Toledo OH home
or on the kitchen counter if the door was unlocked. When I came back from
this particular trip which was maybe 3 weeks long, there sitting on the
counter, was a copy of a privately printed book dated about 1850. It was the
history of the Uniontown Fire Company and prominently detailed was the major
role that my bucket owner played in starting this Volunteer Fire Company.

Segue and paragraph break-Subject hasn't changed so Strunk and White can
smite me hip and thigh but it was unwieldy. Maybe Marshall can write us a
Style Book. I didn't like starting sentences with &quot;And&quot; until the WSJ did it
for about 5 years. And I'd like to say I still have them (Bucket and book)
but Rule 1 established early on was not to collect what you sell. Otherwise
you can quickly violate the much broader rule #2- &quot;Don't fall in love with
anything-or anyone-that can't (or won't) love you back.&quot; We probably all
break both those rules from time to time-this coming from someone that has
owned as many as 8 operating fire engines-but in the long haul you probably
have to decide if you're a merchant or maybe a collector with a resale
license. There is the argument to be made for having a &quot;Reference Collection&quot;
where you can have representative samples of each variation of a maker's
output available for comparison but they probably should be booked and
insured as reference books and other items of that sort at replacement cost
and not as inventory. Don't know how Ronnie manages everything at Lough
Cottage. Around here if you have a cottage you have to go outside to change
your mind. Otherwise that often huge investment becomes a drag on your &quot;Turns
of Inventory&quot; if you ever decide to sell out and it drives your CPA crazy.
But then you also must consider the legal issues connected to divorce, plus
future estate and gift taxes. As a simple example if your father was a big
collector of Roseville and left it all to you, if it crept into your shop
inventory even though it was just for reference or even to taunt customers
with &quot;Neener-Neener I've got all this neat stuff and you don't&quot; in a
Community Property (sorry to include a Western US and Civil Law etc. legal
concept-next time I'll do one on the Napoleonic Code, and Redhibition to get
even ) State you've probably moved your sole property (supposedly valued at
the &quot;Stepped Up Basis&quot; as of the date of Dad's death) that is outside the
Community Property category into something your spouse can claim half of and
you'll have to give up real money or other liquid assets to get it back. We
probably have enough lawyers, tax experts and especially those that have
actually been dragged through the Divorce or Estate Tax machines that we can
devote a huge block of cyberspace to kick this subject around before year end
bites us all in the ass. Non-Usaians are especially invited to tell your good
or ugly stories. Those that don't want their personal lives exposed can get
grab a semi-secret account or pick on one of us you trust to e-mail your
story to and they can strip it of personal data and submit it. But if you
really don't want to be linked to the tale, watch your writing style; I've
(and lots of others) have been at this long enough that we can often spot who
the author is by structure, sentence length, phrasing, rhythm, and even the
placement of nouns vs. subject. If this was 40 years ago I would suggest that
you use Telegraph style (full stop) But probably 95 % of this list has never
even seen a Telegram except in a Museum or Presidential Library (full stop)

Hold on to those memories and photos
if you have any. It has been closed for a long time and in the process
of being demolished. Casinos are being talked about, who knows. The guy
that bought
it at tax sale is complaining the dumping fees of $40.00 Ton are too
much and he wants a special deal.
How about Christmas morning for your stories about the Concord?
Kutshers, Grossingers, Villa Roma? Have you been to them all? Kutshers
and Villa Roma are still open, who knows for how long, the others are
all closed.
Once I get the turkey in the oven, I'd
love to sit and read your stories.

HAPPY HOLIDAYS

Don't they know information should be free? &lt;insert wry grin&gt;

It's an 800 number to order the paper version, and unless they've figured
out the state of California has an online seller's permit verification
page, you could make one up. OTOH, it costs nothing to get a seller's
permit and you don't even need to go down to the Board of Equalization
to get it (like I did).

Probably not worth the trouble unless you already wanted one, though.

"/> Charley,
I could describe the machine in the basement, which you had to educate me on
but you would do a much better job. As I recall it was a large reclining piece
of equipment and the antique forerunner to vibrators. I could never do the
description justice.

For those of you who may go to the Castle and have a business resale number, be
sure to go upstairs where only dealers are allowed.

dictionary, and the time that a friend got booted from the library at
the sub base at New London, Conn., when he asked the prissy librarian
for a Funkin Wagnalls.

Much later, I did meddle with the NYT style book, but the paragraphy
was long established, and I never thought twice about it. What you
reminded me of, though, was a girl named Mary Singleton in
Christchurch, New Zealand (and no, Ronnie, it was not THAT Mary
Singleton ....)

We had just arrived in what turned out to be a several-month layover
on our way to Antarctica, and a couple of us sailors went to a dance,
looking for girls. From afar, it seemed to me that Mary was a hot
prospect, which will tell you just how dull was my eye for action.

Up close, Mary was a quite proper English teacher who invited me not
to shenannigans but to meet her mother and have tea and scones.
Something might have developed, but .... We did talk a lot and we
did correspond for a couple of years, but those were days when I
required cheap thrills.

Anyway, I've always thought that one of the nicest things Mary ever
said to me was: &quot;You paragraph better than anyone I've ever known.&quot;
