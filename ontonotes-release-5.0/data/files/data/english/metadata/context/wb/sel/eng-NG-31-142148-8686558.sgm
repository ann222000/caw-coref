PRESIDENT PAPADOPOULOS - TURKEY

Cyprus President Tassos Papadopoulos said if Turkey believes that its
occupation of the islands northern third is legal, then it can appeal
to the International Court of Justice in The Hague.

On Thursday, the Cypriot government issued a statement in reply to the
reactions of the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Turkish
Cypriot leadership to remarks by President Papadopoulos, who said in a
televised press conference on Tuesday that the Turkish army was an
enemy of Cyprus.

In statements before departing to London, on his way to New York to
address the UN General Assembly, the President said yesterdays
statement was made in response to the representative of the Turkish
Armed Forces and the Turkish Cypriot side that the occupation forces
are legally in Cyprus, based on the 1960 Treaty of Guarantee.

Our view is well known, the presence of the Turkish occupation forces
and the Turkish invasion, cannot be legally based on the Treaty of
Guarantee, and their presence in Cyprus, is, in any case, illegal. We
said that if Turkey believes otherwise, then it can appeal or agree to
appeal to the International Court of Justice in The Hague, the
President remarked.

However, he said it is also well know that Turkey does not recognize
the jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice, therefore to
make an appeal, an agreement should be made to note down the
differences between the two countries and the whole issue to be
referred to The Hague. Consequently, we cannot proceed with an appeal
before this agreement is reached, the President added.

President Papadopoulos also said that during his meeting with Turkish
Cypriot leader earlier this month, it was evident that Mehmet Ali Talat
was trying to evade from the 8 July Agreement.

We believe that the July 8 Agreement, just as it was set out to be
implemented based on the ideas of former Under-Secretary-General
Gambaris letter of 15 November 2006, contained many positive elements
for us, Papadopoulos remarked.

He said the most important of these positive elements is that the
overall settlement of the Cyprus problem should come from the
discussions of the working groups. And in our view, since then, Turkey
has been trying to deviate from this agreement, and this was Mr. Talats
apparent effort during our recent meeting.

Cyprus has been divided since 1974, when Turkey invaded and occupied
its northern third.

President Papadopoulos and Talat agreed on 8 July 2006, during a
meeting in Nicosia in the presence of Gambari, to begin a process of
bicommunal discussions on issues that affect the day-to-day life of the
people and concurrently those that concern substantive issues, both
contributing to a comprehensive settlement of the Cyprus problem.

In New York, President Papadopoulos will meet UN Secretary-General Ban
Ki-moon on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly. He will also hold
meetings with the Permanent Members of the UN Security Council and
other leaders.

Foreign Minister Erato Kozakou Markoullis will also travel to New York
for meetings with her counterparts.
