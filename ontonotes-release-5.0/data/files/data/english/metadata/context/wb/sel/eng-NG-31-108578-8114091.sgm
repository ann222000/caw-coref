How To Speak Hedgie
What hedge-fund managers mean when they talk about challenges.
By Daniel Gross
Posted Tuesday, Aug. 14, 2007, at 4:16 PM ET
--------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----

In these days of market volatility, hedge-fund managers and executives
at all types of money management firms have been forced to explain why
their funds are shutting down, losing money hand over fist, and
freezing investors' funds. When they do so, however, they frequently
lapse into a strange euphemistic dialect. And so we thought it would
be helpful to provide a handy Hedgie-English glossary.

Hedge-Fund Phrase: Challenging
Translation: Run for the hills!

Hedge-fund managers never piss away money. They just face challenges.
&quot;We sincerely appreciate your patience and understanding during this
challenging period,&quot; Jeffrey Larson, founder of Sowood Capital, told
investors last month, as he explained why the $3 billion hedge fund,
having lost half its capital, was selling off its remaining positions
and closing up shop. As two of its large hedge funds that invested in
mortgage-backed securities were going down, Bear Stearns CEO James
Cayne told investors that &quot;the sub-prime mortgage market has been
challenging for a number of months.&quot; More recently, Monday's Wall
Street Journal quoted giant asset manager Barclays as saying that
performance in its 32 Capital Fund had been &quot;challenging.&quot;

Hedge-Fund Phrase: Unprecedented, unique circumstances
Translation: Stuff happens. But we had no clue.

Anyone who read the best seller The Black Swan knows that random
geopolitical, financial, and economic events can cause the prices of
assets to move in ways that defy history and sophisticated computer
models. But it comes as a shock to the brightest minds on Wall Street,
especially those who run quantitative-based funds. &quot;Wednesday is the
type of day people will remember in quant-land for a very long time,&quot;
Matthew Rothman, head of quantitative equity strategies for Lehman
Brothers told the Wall Street Journal last week. &quot;Events that models
only predicted would happen once in 10,000 years happened every day
for three days.&quot; Strangely, these same models failed to predict the
once-in-10,000-year events that roiled the markets in 1997, 1998,
2001, and 2002.

Hedge-Fund Phrase: Market volatility has produced unfair, unrealistic
prices.
Translation: The market is efficient only when it works in our favor.

Several money managers blamed their temporary problems on investors'
irrational collective behavior. &quot;Investor fear has overtaken reason
and has induced a period in which most securities have simply ceased
to trade,&quot; said Sentinel Management, which sought to halt redemptions
of some of its funds this week. And such conditions make it &quot;virtually
impossible to properly price securities or to trade them.&quot; Goldman
Sachs CFO David Viniar noted that the firm's decision to inject $2
billion into its ailing Global Equity Opportunities fund &quot;reflects our
collective belief that the value of this fund is suffering from a
market dislocation that does not reflect the fundamental value of the
fund's positions.&quot; In other words, the losses shown by these funds
isn't the fault of the managers, it's the fault of a market that just
won't value assets properly. Ironically, you never hear fund managers
say that their gains have been unwarrantedly large due to the market's
failure to reflect stocks' fundamental value.

Hedge-Fund Phrase: Our results were affected by the selling behavior
of other firms.
Translation: We made the same dumb trades as everyone else.

&quot;We have been caught in what appears to be a large wave of de-
leveraging on the part of quantitative long/short hedge funds,'' James
Simons of Renaissance Technologies said in a letter to investors last
week, which sought to explain losses in his highly regarded hedge
fund. He also noted that the methodology used by his fund was
&quot;undoubtedly shared by a number of long/short hedge funds.&quot; Goldman
Sachs similarly blamed other funds' behavior for its own losses. Of
course, the premise of high-end money management is that you don't
simply mimic the same investment strategy of 30 other hedge funds.
That why Simons was paid $1.7 billion in 2006 (article purchase
required).

Hedge-Fund Phrase: We just want to protect investors.
Translation: We just want to cover our butts.

Declining performance frequently leads investors to withdraw their
funds, which can, in turn, force hedge funds to sell securities to
raise cash. To forestall the ensuing death spiral, funds sometimes
lock the door. French bank BNP Paribas last week froze redemptions of
three funds that held mortgage-backed securities. BNP said it was
limiting the liberté of its investors for the sake of protecting the
Gallic virtues of égalité and fraternité. Locking up the funds
temporarily is the best way &quot;to protect the interests and ensure the
equal treatment of our investors.&quot; Sentinel used the classic American
trope of aligning the interests of the owners with those of the
shareholders. &quot;We don't believe it is in anyone's best interest if a
run on Sentinel took place and we were in a forced liquidation mode.&quot;

Hedge-Fund Phrase: This isn't a rescue.
Translation: THIS IS TOTALLY A RESCUE!!!!!!!

Goldman Sachs' GEO fund lost 30 percent of its value in a week and was
leveraged at a rate of 6-to-1. But to hear Goldman tell it, the
cratering of its own fund simply presented an irresistible buying
opportunity. &quot;We are investing not because we have to, but because we
want to,&quot; said Viniar during a conference call. At another point, he
noted: &quot;No, let me just clarify. This is not a rescue.&quot; And if you
believe that, I've got some subprime debt I'd like to sell you.

Hedge-Fund Guy Atones for His Subprime Bond Sins
By Mark Gilbert

Aug. 16 (Bloomberg) -- Dear investor, we'd like to take this
opportunity to update you on the recent performance of our hedge fund,
Short-Term Capital Mismanagement LLP.

As you know, market selection for the entire fund is guided by a
proprietary investing tool we like to call ``a dartboard.'' Once the
asset classes are decided, individual security selections are
generated by digitizing our unique hexagonal cuboid models.

Unfortunately, it transpires that our hexagonal cuboids are not as
unique as we thought. Hundreds of other hedge funds possess identical
dice. The technical term for this is a ``crowded trade.'' You may also
see it referred to as ``climbing on a bandwagon already headed for the
wall.''

As our alpha generation collapses, our beta has turned negative, our
delta hedging has gone toxic and, trust me, you do not want to hear
about our gamma. We can't even find our epsilons in the dark with both
hands.

You will appreciate that accurate pricing is essential for evaluating
our investment strategies. This has proven to be extremely challenging
in recent days. Previously, we have relied on Bob, the sales guy at
Hokey-Cokey Bank. Bob assured us the securities were still worth 100
percent of face value, so everything was cool. Bob sold the
collateralized debt obligations to us in the first place, so he knows
what he's talking about.

Bob, however, appears to have had a nervous breakdown, judging by the
maniacal laughter that greeted our requests for price verification
this week. Our efforts to implement an in- house CDO valuation
framework, using a technique the ancients knew as ``making things
up,'' proved unsatisfactory.

Where's the Bid?

Currently, all of the portfolios we manage are undergoing a rigorous
screening known as ``crossing our fingers and praying that we don't
have to try and find a bid in the market.'' This is supplemented by a
cross-market statistical analysis originally developed by the U.S.
military called ``don't ask, don't tell.'' This ``unmarking-to-
unmarket'' procedure has been the benchmark for the hedge-fund
industry for the past, ooh, 72 hours.

We have, of course, been in touch with the rating companies to update
our default-probability scenarios, particularly on the AAA rated
investments we own. They recommended a forecasting method using
stochastics to regress the drift-to-downgrade timescales for the past
100 years and throw them forward for the next five minutes. The
technical term for this is ``induction,'' though those of you of a
less quantitative bent may know it as ``guessing.''

AAA or Toast?

We are pleased to report that, contrary to what current market prices
might suggest, all of our top-rated securities remain absolutely AAA.
Provided, that is, the future performance of the underlying collateral
is identical to its history. Otherwise, the rating companies say our
investments are likely to be reclassified as ``toast.''

We have also been checking our back-up credit lines with our friends
in the investment-banking world. As soon as they return our calls,
we'll be able to update you on our emergency liquidity position. We
are sure they are fine.

Some of you have written to us asking for your money back, citing
clauses in the fund documentation called redemption rights. Frankly,
we never expected you to actually read that prospectus, which came
prepackaged when we bought the Microsoft Hedge-Fund Guy software. We
certainly have no idea what all those long words mean.

We have filed your letters in a special drawer in the filing cabinet
marked ``trash'' for now. Do you have any idea how much trouble you
all would be in if we actually sold this stuff in the market today? At
these crazy prices? Fuhgeddaboudit. You'll thank us later.

Not a Rescue

Speaking of crazy prices, we know you'll be thrilled to learn that
we've invited a bunch of our rich pals into the fund to participate in
this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. But this is not a rescue. Do not
even think the word rescue. This is an opportunity. Not a rescue. An
opportunity.

In fact, we think this is such a fantastic opportunity, we've agreed
to forgo our usual management fee, and we'll only take half our usual
slice of the profits. Provided there are any profits to slice. You, of
course, are absolutely invited to participate in this offer by sending
us yet more of your money on exactly the same revised terms as our
rich pals.

Finally, a word for all of you who have been kind enough to inquire
about my personal financial situation. I am relieved to report that my
directors and officers insurance is fully paid up. Furthermore, my
Bentley Continental was paid out of the 2 percent fee we levied when
you wrote your first check to us, so I will still be able to trundle
into the parking lot each morning in an open-necked shirt to ignore
your telephone calls and e-mails. Yours, Hedge-Fund Guy.

Marilyn
