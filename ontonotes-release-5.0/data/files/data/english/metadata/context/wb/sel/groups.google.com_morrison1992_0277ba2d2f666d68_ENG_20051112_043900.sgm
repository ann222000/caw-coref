Hey guys and gals, since graduation with a 2.4 average, I attended
college, got tired of school, and joined the Army. The Army has been
the most favorite thing I have ever done besides getting married and
being a father. I highly recommend it for some people.

After the Army, I attended a Community College and then the University
of Tennesse. I took Business (waste) and Asian Studies. Had a 3.5
average there, go figure. BTW, a business degree is as worthless as the
paper it's written on, when it comes to starting your own business. I
know for a fact. I had a Pizza restaurant but it failed for lack of
business in that area, maybe I should've paid the school more money.

AAnywaays.. I started painting new construction housing which was not
too bad except for the weather when the paint freezes while I paint
porch rails in the 28 degrees. So, now I have a job in the computer
tech industry troubleshooting as peeps call in with their problems. I
like it, and this is where the future is.

I voted for George Bush, not the best candidate, but look at his
competition. Kerry would be wetting himself along with Al. The United
Nations are the cause for all the wars since WW1, not Bush. Plus the
Liberals were the first ones who wanted to take out Saddam because of
the election times for the senators. Now they renig, typical. My notes
on this war on terror: Terror will not stop as long as there are
muslims in the world. I say leave them alone until they bother the
Isralis, or any other western nation, then obliterate them. Abraham
should have waited a little longer. Now let's see if the Frogs
surrender to the muslim children, then it is only a matter of time
before the US sees our share of antidemocratic-capitalist uprisings.
Why are they in those countries in the first place? But, I digress.

I'm not a racist, but I believe the whole Tower of Babel thing is not
just there for our intertainment. I think I'll go to Bible School.

Ah Jason, it is good to hear that some things will always remain the
same. Knives, guns, zippo lighters, lazer sights, and teaching me how
to clean Mr. Seargant's swimming pool- your speech has brought back a
flood of memories.
Don't ever change buddy, and let me know when the South does rise again.
