This thread makes one realize the problem is individual
and varied. Makes me realize I didn't have it so bad.
(Gawd, Ann.  How rotten for you and Sligo!)

I'm grateful to have just found this ng when Mac was
traumatized by fireworks, because, unlike Solo,

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Thunderclaps set Solo off, and yet, he is
&gt; not afraid of very similar noises coming
&gt; from, say, construction sites. Fireworks
&gt; don't faze him.
">

he began to chain fears - fireworks to storms to hammering
to car doors slamming.  Because of this group I was able
to act immediately, which I think is important, and we
began to work our way back through them.

A big help was Jerry Howe's &quot;anchoring&quot; technique.

I chose Mac's mismatched flopped-over ear.  It's kind
of funny now. When he hears thunder or the kind of noise
that panicked him, his only response is to twitch that
ear himself.

Tracy,

What worked for me, in just one storm,
was to praise the dog after each clap
of thunder, telling him he's a Good Dog!

This is an almost 13 year old Doberman, BTW.

The next time it thundered, he did not even
react at all--you could not tell it was the same
dog as before.

There was more thunder just the other day,
and same thing, nada, nothing, zilch, no
cowering, whimpering, trying to hide at all,
it was that simple.

I got this idea from Jerry Howe, who might seem
to be a &quot;wild and crazy&quot; character, but his non-
abusive way of handling dogs WORKS.

Wonderfully.

Praise.

It's that simple.

It is a method that is gentle to the dog, very easy

both my dogs, giving practically instant results.

It was as if I had been given the &quot;key&quot; to understanding

istening to me, doing what I was asking him to do, instead
of constantly opposing me.

It also worked with some issues my older dog had, too -
her fear of thunder, her barking and her aggression
towards another female dog.

Don't let either the first impression about the &quot;weirdness&quot;

from at least reading the manual and deciding for yourself
if you want to try it or not.

Subj: Fear of Thunder
Date: 6/29/02 6:07:13 PM Eastern Daylight Time
From: Jraltman
To: Witsenddog

Dear Jerry,

I hope you'll be able to post this message so
more people who are at their wit's end will be
able to help their dogs.

To review:

Our puppy was uncomfortable during thunder
storms. At the beginning of the problem, she
paced restlessly from room to room. She
couldn't settle and sleep.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;From there the problem grew. She would run
">

to the far southeast corner of the house (which
makes sense because most storms here come
from the northwest) and she'd cower in the
corner of the couch and shake.

1st attempt to help her:

I'd pick her up, brush and massage her (call
me a nut - I've sung to her when I've done
her daily brushing since she was tiny so of
course I sang too) and when she relaxed,
I'd put her in her crate. She then slept and I
thought the problem was solved.

Traumatic event:

We were out in the park playing with one of her
doggy friends when it began to rain. On the way
home, there was the loudest, longest, thunder
clap I've ever heard.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;From that day on, the problem got worse and worse.
">

I couldn't calm her with singing and massage. The
fear spread. She wouldn't go out if it was raining.
No thunder, just gently summer rain, and she
wouldn't go out.

The solution:

I surfed the net and came across a free manual Wit's
End Dog Training Method and a product called Doggy
Do Right that seemed better than anything else I came
across.

A phone call to Jerry Howe, author of the manual and
Director of Research, Biosound Scientific, convince
me to try both the manual and the product.

Problem solved:

I followed Jerry's suggestions  (more phone calls - he
is most generous with his time and advice). The first
two thunder storms my puppy was restless but not
running around in a blind panic.

The third storm, she barked her deep, stranger
danger bark after each clap of thunder.

The fourth storm, she seemed uneasy at first. Soon
she was asleep at my feet and she napped through
the rest of the storm.

A miracle.

I am endlessly grateful to Jerry
for his manual and his machine.

A word about Doggy Do Right. It is odd to buy
a machine that emits a sound I cannot hear.

I took the chance because Jerry offered a full
refund including shipping. Though I heard
nothing, my puppy clearly did.

When I first turned on the machine, she got
the cutest, most quizzical look on her face.

She looked at me as if to say: &quot;What's that?

I never heard that before.&quot;

I have read the essay by Veterinarian D.F. Horwitz.
She should stick to working with disease and injury,
she would fail Psych 101.

The behaviorist THEORY of learning is that a conditional reflex is
formed when a behavior results in a positive
reinforcement, a reward.  However, too frequent a reward,
or too consistent a reward, or the absence of an expected
reward can result in deranged behavior.

As Breland and Breland stated in their classic essay,
THE MISBEHAVIOR OF ORGANISMS, you have to be guided by the
evolutionary history of the animal you are trying
to teach, the nature of its species, the personal history
of the animal, and you have to be very cautious in using
direct reinforcement.  If you are training a pig, you'd better include
rooting in the routine, if its a chicken include pecking and
scratching, or else.  If its a puppy then you must include pack
behavior, affection and pack loyalty.

NEGATIVE means NO!  Freshmen frequently make the error
that negative reinforcement is aversive reinforcement,
no, its NO reinforcement.

Aversive reinforcement includes choking, kicking,
biting, shocking, abrading, alpha rolling and other
sadistic behaviors.  AVERSIVE reinforcement always
deranges behavior.

Neither paramecia nor dogs ever forget.

I do strongly urge that the Vet read &quot;THE MISBEHAVIOR
OF ORGANISMS&quot; and the entire book SCHEDULES OF
REINFORCEMENT.

The most important rule that we learned from Pavlov's half a century
career, and that of his last student,
Sam Corson, is that love is not naive, but is the
basis of good training of all dogs.

Fondly,
George von Hilsheimer, Ph.D., F.R.S.H.
you may find my credentials in Who's Who in America,
as well as WW in Medicine and Health Care; in WW in
Science and Technology; and in WW in the World, all
Marquis publications, you can't buy your way in.

and I had hers.

Counterconditioning and Desensitization
Debra F. Horwitz DVM, Diplomate ACVB
Veterinary Behavior Consultations
St. Louis, Missouri

Counterconditioning and desensitization are the cornerstones to
treatment of fears and anxieties. Yet the treatment of these
conditions can be difficult. First, it is important to accurately
identify the fearful or anxiety producing stimulus. Then, it is
important to break the stimulus down into discrete units. Progress
with treatment may be slow and animals may not generalize from the
treatment sessions to real experiences. In order to be successful in
modifying behavior in dogs and cats a good understanding of learning,
reinforcers and punishers is necessary.

What is learning? Learning is the relationship between behavior and
consequence, between making a response and the outcome of that
behavior. The results obtained affect later behaviors by either
increasing or decreasing the likelihood of future similar responses.
What is important is to realize that behavior is something that occurs
all the time. Therefore, when you remove a behavior from an animal's
repertoire, it will be replaced with something else. The goal of
behavior therapy is to structure that replacement behavior in the
correct way.

Since behavior is the result of behavior-consequence relationships
understanding how they function is helpful. Generally speaking there
are four types of behavior-consequence relations. First, behavior can
result in positive consequences. This is positive reinforcement and
will produce an increase in the behavior that resulted in the positive
event. Second, behavior can result in negative consequences. This is
punishment, and should result in a decrease in the behavior that
caused it. Third, the behavior can result in the removal of something
unpleasant. This is negative reinforcement or escape and will increase
the likelihood that the preceding behavior will occur again. Lastly,
there are behaviors that result in the elimination of something
pleasant, and this is called omission. 1 Learning occurs best when
there is a clear relationship between the timing of the two events
(behavior and consequence) and the predictiveness of the consequences.

Learning principles and behavior modification techniques
The previous discussion showed that behavior is controlled by its
consequences-either pleasant ones or unpleasant ones.

Reinforcement is a positive relationship between behavior and outcome.
The more you do, the more you get, and what you get is good. In other
words, behavior will be repeated. There can be positive reinforcement,
often called a reward. Positive reinforcement and rewards are often
used synonymously, but that is not always true. It is easy to see a
food treat or a pat on the head as a reward for the dog. However, it
is often more difficult to determine why some behaviors still exist
because the reward is not clear. For example, what it the reward for a
dog when it barks at the mailperson? The reinforcement comes from the
mailperson leaving, and therefore the dog will continue to bark. The
dog has erroneously assumed that the barking behavior made the person
leave, and therefore will engage in the behavior again.

Negative reinforcement is the removal of something unpleasant that
increases the likelihood that a behavior will be repeated. In this
situation there is a negative relationship between behavior and
outcome. One way to look at this relationship is to realize the more
an animal engages in the behavior, the less negative outcome is
obtained. The easiest example of negative reinforcement to understand
is escape behavior. If an animal is anticipating an aversive outcome,
perhaps a reprimand from the owner, if the animal can escape, or not
be caught, then the aversive outcome will not occur.

Punishment is a situation where there is a positive relationship
between behavior and outcome, but the outcome is negative. In other
words, the more of a behavior an animal does, the more of a negative
outcome is obtained. This is a situation that should make behavior
decrease. This is an extremely important component of punishment. When
punishment is used to change behavior, there should be a decrease in
the target behavior in very few applications of the aversive event. If
not, then either the punishment is not being appropriately applied, or
applied to the incorrect behavior. Punishment also has the possibility
of causing anxiety, fear and aggression and is not the recommended
means of changing behavior.

Schedule of reinforcement
The way the both reinforcement and punishment are used can greatly
influence their effectiveness. This is often termed the &quot;schedule of
reinforcement&quot;. How behaviors are rewarded can be powerful
determinants of future behavior. Schedules of reinforcement can be
based either on time (intervals) or amount of work, or number of
responses (ratio). Schedules can be fixed, meaning that after so much
time or a set number of responses reinforcement is given.
Alternatively, behavior can be reinforced on a variable schedule,
meaning that a period of time or a number of responses must take
place, but that period varies from reinforcer to reinforcer, with an
average time or number of responses. Reinforcement given on a variable
schedule results in strong acquisition of the response. This means
that the rewards are given intermittently, and the animal is not
exactly sure when the reinforcement or the punishment will occur. The
outcome also must be closely associated in time with the behavior for
best results.

Extinction is a procedure used to end a behavior. Extinction occurs
when behavior is no longer reinforced. When this occurs, eventually
the behavior will stop. However, it is very common, especially if the
behavior has been maintained on a variable ratio of reinforcement, for
the behavior to temporarily increase and this is called an extinction
burst. When trying to get a behavior to extinguish it is extremely
important to identify ALL reinforcers and eliminate them.

Habituation is a process by which a stimulus no longer evokes a
response. Usually this occurs with repeated presentation of a stimulus
and the animal learning that it does not signal anything important.

Flooding is used to treat fears of harmless stimuli by forcing the
animal to stay in the presence of the stimuli until the fear is
extinguished.

Classical conditioning is the pairing of an unconditioned stimulus,
with a neutral stimulus that results in a conditioned stimulus and a
conditioned response. Classical conditioning can occur in both
positive and negative ways. The timing of the presentation of the
stimulus, the saliency of the stimulus and the predictability of the
stimulus and the reinforcement influence the conditioning process.

Conditioned emotional response refers to establishing fears through a
classical conditioning paradigm. This entails the association of a
fear-producing stimulus with a previously neutral object. This type of
learning can be very powerful and hard to extinguish.

Operant conditioning is learning how ones actions result in
consequences; i.e. the individual causes the results. This is a
stimulus-response/response-consequence relationship. In other words,
what the animal does is critical to what happens next and those
results dictate if the behavior will occur again. Behavior becomes
more likely if it is reinforced, less likely if it is punished.

Counterconditioning is teaching a behavior that is incompatible with
the previous response. An example is to teach a dog to sit and stay
instead of lunging. What is wanted is that the response be
behaviorally and physiologically different from the previous response.
Therefore, facial

The term &quot;reinforcement is used only tentatively
with &quot;aversion&quot; because aversive stimuli (aka
punishment) typically derange learning and are
not followed by clean learning curves equivalent
to those which follow reward or positive reinforcement;

Escape conditioning = dog has an aversive stimulus
applied without any dog related reason and when
behavior is emitted aversive stim is immediately
turned off .

There is some indication that Escape Conditioning
works in a manner closely approximating reward;
but, ear pinch? -- too aversive.

Scott, Jerry Howe forwarded me the letter below.
I'm glad that you referred negatively to Jerry's
habit of CAPITALIZING and HOWEING everything.

I personally hate this habit of his. I think it
is his way of diluting his authority - IME he is
a very modest fellow. However, contrary to your
sneer, he is very competent at living with dogs.

I thought I'd list a series of actions which I
found on the list, folk asking advice on what
to do about dogs doing this and that, for example:

whining,
humping, hunching,
pacing,
self mutilation - paw licking, side sucking,
spinning,
prolonged barking, barking at shadows,
overstimulated barking,
fighting, bullying other dogs,
compulsive digging,
compulsive scratching,
compulsive chewing,
frantic behavior,
chasing light, chasing shadow,
stealing food,
digging in garbage can,
loosing house (toilet) training.
inappropriate fearfulness
aggression.

The thing that is fascinating to me, as an ethologist who
graduated from college 50 years ago and has spent all
of the intervening time working with animals (including
the human animal), is that you never see any of these
behaviors in wild dingoes, jackals, coyotes or wolves,
you don't even see these behaviors in hyenas (who
aren't dog related).

You see these behaviors in human managed animals,
especially animals who live with neurotic hysterical
humans.

As Sam Corson (Pavlov's last student) demonstrated for
nearly 50 years at Ohio University (Oxford, O.) there
is no treatment more useful for dogs than tender loving
care.

Hi Buzzsaw

I am happy to tell you, I contacted Jerry at the email
addy I posted and he was so great! I wasn't following

Beau is doing sooooo well it is really a thrill working

This is something I can wholeheartedly support. However, there are
probably
times when &quot;tough love&quot; is indicated. My dog should know that I am not
going to inflict arbitrary pain or discomfort or even angry words, but
I
think he needs to know that he will be restrained or corrected if he
exceeds certain limits.

[snip long account of behaviorist theory that makes a LOT of sense]

&gt; Changing behavior takes a good history, a realistic treatment plan and
&gt; good supervision and cooperation between behaviorist and pet owner as
&gt; well as a complete understanding of learning and behavior modification
&gt; techniques.

I enjoyed reading this information. It is a lot to assimilate, and
proper
application is probably best left to a professional. But it helps me
to
understand behavior in a very logical way that makes sense to an
engineer.
Much of the theory parallels the principles of electronic control
theory,
which includes negative and positive feedback, system response time,
recognition of stimuli, etc. PID, acronym for Proportional, Integral,
and
Derivative, is a set of terms which are adjusted to produce optimal
system
control performance. Incorrect tuning to the behavior of the system
components can produce sluggish response, overshoots, oscillations,
and
instability, which have close cousins in psychological terms such as
depression, mania, and bipolar disorder.

Thanks for presenting that. (I removed crossposting because, well,

The Amazing Puppy Wizard is the cognomen of a dog behaviorist,
Jerry Howe, of Orlando, Fl.  Howe's primary teaching is that
dogs deserve unconditional love, respect, and attention and
that by providing these emotional needs dogs will regulate
their own behavior.

Howe is bombastically antagonistic to rewarders, but he is
aggressively hostile to punishers - he refers antagonists
to B.F. Skinner, Mary Cover Jones, and J.B. Watson and
especially to Samuel A. Corson when they mistakenly annunciate
behavioral principles to support their use of punishment.

Punishment always deranges behavior, says Skinner,
Jones, Watson, Corson and Jerry Howe!

Howe developed a sonic device which calms dogs and has
been broadly tested in a wide range of different situations.
The present author is a Who's Who recognized psychologist
who was asked to evaluate Howe's device by a former student.

Howe provided the author with a device, without
charge, and said device worked as reported.

Then cross reference to Jerry Howe, etc.

--------------

Jerry, the difficulty with these ignorant dog molesters
is that they cannot read.   Negative reinforcement is no
response by the trainer.

There is positive reinforcement, an action which is followed
by an increase in the targetted behavior (usually called
&quot;reward&quot; which is precisely and technically a misnomer),
negative reinforcement is the absence of any response.

Negative means 'No'.

Skinner's last book, &quot;CUMULATIVE RECORD&quot; reviews this
thoroughly. http://www.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/proj/nru/nr.html

Negative reinforcement is stopping an aversive reinforcement
according to this author.   Read it, they have a sense of humor!

There are four forms of systematic reinforcement:

do nothing (negative reinforcement)

reward the behavior (positive reinforcement)

punish the behavior (aversive reinforcement) after habituating
the subject to punishment,

stop punishing (relief of aversion, which is negative reinforcement).

Logically, failing to reward after habituating a reward
is also negative reinforcement.  Actually intermittent
rewards work better than consistent, invariable rewards,
so there is actually another two categories.  Invariable
reinforcement and random reinforcement (on varying schedules).

Punishment is AVERSIVE REINFORCEMENT.

Actions which cause the animal being trained to avoid,
avert, cringe away from. Pavlovians always responded
to American psychologist's inability to reproduce Pavlov's
results with dogs with the comment, &quot;American's don't LOVE
their dogs&quot;.  If you ever observed a Russian psychologist
working with a dog, you'd instantly see the difference.

American psychologists were wooden, robot-like,
wanted to be &quot;scientific&quot;.

This meant to them that they should display no
affection, or any other emotion with the subjects.

When a Pavlovian dog started to misbehave or fail to respond,
doggie was taken out of the equipment, and taken home for a
loving vacation, with much TLC.  Sam Corson, Pavlov's last
student, demonstrated the same relationships at Ohio State.

Interestingly the first page of results for Sam Corson,
dog behaviorist is loaded with Jerry Howe quoting Dr. Von.
heh heh heh

Oh, by the way, you once had a pompous fellow say that
Dr. Von was a figment of your imagination.  I don't

Dear Jerry,  I paged through some of the &quot;dog business&quot;
and was astonished at the low quality of opinions arising
from professors of behavior analysis.

I had the very great privilege of meeting Sam Corson
(Pavlov's last Ph.D. student) and his dogs at Ohio
University.  I even got to spend a night at Sam's house.

There is no question but that you are a spiritual brother
to Corson and to Pavlov, both of whom knew that the dog's
great capacity for love was the key to shaping doggie behavior.

Paradoxical reward and paradoxical fixing of attention
are both well documented Pavlovian techniques.  Even
so humorless a chap as B.F. Skinner taught students like
the Breland's whose &quot;The Misbehavior of Organisms&quot;

It's NOT as hard a habit for most
dogs to break as it seems to be!&quot;

his desire to come close to me and I wouldn't want
to trigger his opposition
