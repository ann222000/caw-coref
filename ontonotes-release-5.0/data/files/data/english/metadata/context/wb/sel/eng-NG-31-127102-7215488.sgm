I'm talking, of course, about the inexpensive digital thermometers sold
in drugstores, ect.  Before I report amazing temperatures to my doctor,
I'd like to know if I'm setting myself up for a big embarrassment.  No
doubt this topic has come up before, but I'm a relative newcomer and
couldn't find an archive.  Anybody know the hard facts ?...Brady T.

The cheap digital thermometers are very repeatable.  They will always
give the same reading for the same temperature.  They are much more
convenient than the mercury thermometers.  I have a digital
thermometer that reads about 1 degree low.  It always reads low.  The
others I have are spot on.  To find out if your thermometer is reading
accurately you can compare digital thermometers of different brands
and if they read the same they are probably right.  You can compare it
with a mercury thermometer.  Or the best solution is to bring it on
your next doctor visit and compare its reading to what the doctor
measures.

Keep in mind the average temperature of an adult male is 97.4 to 98.8.
For a female it is 97.7 to 99.1.  Temperature normally varies up to 2
degrees during a day.  Temperatures between 96 and 100 can be
considered normal.  I am usually somewhere between 96.5 to 97.8.  This
is my oral temperature at least an hour after eating or drinking.

What are your amazing temperatures?
