*Dear Mr Rai*
The first thing to know is that rabbit meat is good, although it takes to
get used to. It is a delicacy in Europe. Cooked without marinading can make
the meat smell awkwardly. But marinade with vinegar, wine, strong organic
garlic and ginger and it is good. So, the first solution is to use it as
food. I like rabbit meat.

Second, rabbit shit has highest % of N, P &amp; K of all domesticated animal
shit. Even better than Gobar. Catch these rabbits, keep them in pens, feed
them, collect the poop and feed it to earthworms [Eisenia foetida] to get
one of the best vermicompost you can imagine. And have free meat as well. I
am pasting below the values. Many of these webpages are no more available.
But I hope you recieve the tables in order.

I am sending this information in the hope that you will share it with
everyone.
These are part of my collection of around 30,000 research papers.

*best of luck with rabbits. If I were you, I'd also promote rabbit meat in
all the restaurents in Darjeeling especially European tourists flock, like
Glenaries.  *

Rabbit manure composition
In Table 3, manure includes both liquid and solid wastes.

Figures calculated from Kruger (unpublished) and Lebas et al. (1986).

The composition of the waste produced varies with the type and age of the
rabbit, and particularly with the diet. The figures in Table 4 from Lebas et
al. (1986) provide some guide for developing nutrient budgets.
*Table 4. Quantities and composition of excrement produced by rabbits*
Origin Weight per day (g) Content of fresh product (%) Nitrogen P2O5 *
Faeces:* Fattening young 40-50 1.5-1.7 2.0-5.0 Nursing doe 150-200 1.2-1.5
5.0-7.0 Resting adult 70-80 1.2-1.5 2.0-4.0 *Urine:* Fattening young 80-110
1.0-1.3 0.05 Nursing doe 250-300 1.0-1.3 &gt;0.02 Resting adult 100 1.0-1.3
0.08

In terms of volume of solid waste, on an annual basis, American literature
suggests that a doe and her 30-40 kittens will create a combined total of
0.2-0.25 cubic metres of manure annually. This figure relates to a
commercial situation where kittens are removed at approximately 12 weeks of
age.

Nutrient Chart
The accompanying chart lists the N-P-K levels of a number of manures. Fresh
manure can be spread and turned under immediately so their nutrients are
caught in the soil rather than being lost to the air while the pile waits
for other materials to arrive; just don't plant crops for at least a month
so the manure has a chance to break down. They can also be used to fortify a
compost pile.
