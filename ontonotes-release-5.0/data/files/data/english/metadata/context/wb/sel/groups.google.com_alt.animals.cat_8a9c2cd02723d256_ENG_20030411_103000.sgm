I went to Petco today and saw a plug-in device that emits a fragrance that
is supposed to keep cats mellow and a more general happiness. It cost thirty
dollars (give or take five bucks). I forgot the name, but was curious if
anyone else has seen this and if it works.

"/> You must be talking about the Feliway Comfort Zone. I have been using
two of these for a couple of months. They are about ready for a refill
which I have already purchased.

Do they work? I buy them because my cats might like them and doing nice
things for them makes me feel good. So, in that respect, they work very
well.

My cats are still cats and do things that I love and things that
irritate me. I don't know what part the Feliway or anything else plays
in this.
