I'd appreciate some advice. I've seen what I think to be a Lloyd Loom
bedside cabinet in a junk shop. It has a green fabric top, covered in glass
with chrome corners. It's green in colour with gold edges and has a curved
door. The weave is different from that of the Lloyd Loom I currently own as
it appears much finer.

My curiosity has got the better of me. Should I have bought it?

Hoping you can help.

April

'Lloyd Loom always has a label on it: if it does not have a label on it
saying Lloyd Loom then it is either (a) not Lloyd Loom or (b) damaged
because the label has been removed'

You neglected in your otherwise excellent description to say whether you
liked the cabinet or not. This is the only criteria for buying a piece.
Unless you are in the trade, that is, and you will have a drawer full of
Lloyd Loom labels to nail onto the back of any old broken down bit of
furniture.

&gt;Yes indeed. When is a Lloyd Loom, not a Lloyd Loom?

"/> Lloyd Loom is also made of tightly rolled paper, not cane. If there's
any wear on the piece, you can usually see this.

"/> Thanks to all those experts that replied to my mail and yes I had neglected
to say that I did like the piece of furniture. Oh well, I'll know what to
look for now!! Thanks again.
