At least three of my fifteen *love* corn on the cob, or fresh corn cooked
on the cob but cut off into a bowl.  They turn their noses up at cooked
frozen and canned corn, and ignore raw corn in any form.

I used to have a couple of cats who *loved* corn on the cob.  They made
worse pests of themselves when we were having corn than they did when we
cooked a turkey - and that's saying a lot.  We'd give them any ends we
trimmed off the cob, and then give them the cobs after we'd finished with
them.  They'd even nibble on those.

Maybe it's the butter?

(I use olive oil - maybe that's why my cats aren't interested?)

I don't use butter, or anything else, buy still several of mine go crazy
over it.

Caliban loves sweet corn out of a tin. Miranda also eats it once in a
while. Frank and Nikki used to love it, too. I'll have to see if I can
find any corn on the cob and try it on Caliban (as if I need to
introduce him to another food that I will then have to keep away from
him :P).

Louie likes canned mandarin oranges and fresh cantaloupe.  How strange
is that?

Miranda has been known to lick the rim of a carton of OJ on more than
one occasion. Caliban licks the rim of cartons of tomato passata. My two
never seem to have heard that cats hate citrus fruit and tomatoes.

Nor does my Bandit - marmalade sandwiches go down his throat pretty well.

Perhaps I should rename him Paddington?
