Ancient Mashed Grapes Found in Greece

March 16, 2007 â€” Either the ancient Greeks loved grape juice, or they
were making wine nearly 6,500 years ago, according to a new study that
describes what could be the world's earliest evidence of crushed
grapes.

If the charred 2,460 grape seeds and 300 empty grape skins were used
to make wine, as the researchers suspect, the remains might have
belonged to the second oldest known grape wine in the world, edged out
only by a residue-covered Iranian wine jug dating to the sixth
millennium B.C.

Since the Greeks influenced the Romans, who in turn influenced
virtually all of Europe, it is possible that a drink made in a humble,
post-framed house in eastern Macedonia influenced much of the world's
wine.

"For the Neolithic or the Bronze Age, we have no evidence for markets
and a market economy," lead author Tania Valamoti told Discovery News.

"Production was on a household or communal basis," added Valamoti, who
is a lecturer in the Department of Archaeology at Greece's Aristotle
University of Thessaloniki.

Valamoti and her team excavated four homes at a Neolithic site called
Dikili Tash. After discovering the grape remains in one residence,
they conducted charring experiments on fresh grapes, raisins and wine
pressings to see what would best match the ancient seeds and skins.
They determined the archaeological remains "morphologically resemble
wine pressings and could not have originated from charred grapes or
raisins."

Analysis of the grape remains determined they either were harvested
from wild plants or originated from a very early cultivar.

Findings are published in the current journal Antiquities.

The scientists also found two-handled clay cups and jars, which they
say suggest a use for decanting and consuming liquids. Charred figs
were also found near the grape remnants. The presence of figs likely
was not a coincidence, according to the researchers, who mentioned
that juice from wild grapes often has a bitter taste.

"Figs could have been added to the grape juice prior to fermentation
and the sugars contained in them would have entered the juice,"
explained Valamoti. "Or, they could have been added to the fermented
product after completion of the fermentation process. Honey could be
dealt with in the same way."

The world's oldest wine, a 9,000-year old rice wine from China, also
contained honey and fruits.

The ancient Greek grapes might change wine history, as experts
previously theorized grape wine-making could have first spread
throughout the Middle East.

Patrick McGovern, a senior research scientist at the University of
Pennsylvania, and one of the world's leading ancient wine experts, has
pointed out that "the wild grape never grew in ancient Egypt," yet
evidence for wine there dates back to at least 2,700 B.C. Red wine
residue was even found in King Tut's tomb.

He and his colleagues believe wine-making became established in Egypt
due to "early Bronze Age trade between Egypt and Palestine,
encompassing modern Israel, the West Bank and Gaza, and Jordan."

But since the Phoenicians and the Greeks largely controlled Egyptian
trade during much of the Pharaonic period, because many such
individuals had settled into the Delta, it is now possible that Greeks
brought wine into Egypt and into numerous other places, through
Greece's extensive trade routes.

Valamoti and her colleagues hope further studies can be conducted on
the Dikili Tash pottery, to determine whether tartaric acid, a
component of grapes and wine, was present in the cups.
