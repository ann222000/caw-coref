A previous poster asked Mark why his alleged wife did not assume Mark's last
name.
Mark responded that it was nobody's business.

The question remains unanswered, however, and I'd like to hear the answer to
that, too.

Methinks that perhaps Mark and Gav are not legally married in the sense that
a legal authority documented the joining. Instead, with their off-the-wall
leanings toward the Knights Of The Round Table and sixteenth century
leanings, I posit that Mark and Gav decided that 21st Century marriages are
not of their liking. It is not unlikely that the two of them stood under a
tree somewhere in the UP and exchanged &quot;vows&quot; with perhaps a few fellow
screwballs and a sheep or two in attendance.
Gav probably wore a period dress of her own design and held some freshly
picked wildflowers while Mark stood stupidly by like the weak-willed
follower he is.
He and she probably said, &quot;I marry you&quot; to each other and considered it a
done deal. Then Gave went back to her apartment and Mark went back to his
daddy's house. There was no Honeymoon and probably no culmination of the
joining by any sexual act. At least not together.

Then Mark, ever one to try to get something for free, posted a Wish List on
the Internet in hopes of obtaining some wedding gifts. Nobody responded,
save for one individual who &quot;outed&quot; Mark and exposed his greed.
Mark became enraged that this individual exposed his scam for a high dollar
wedding gift wish list and when no toaster ovens or bread making machines
(or anything else) were offered, Mark went ballistic and falsely accused the
individual of &quot;hacking&quot; his wish list and wrongly accused the man of
&quot;stealing&quot; Mark's credit card information.
Nobody stole anything, since Mark had posted this information on a web site
that anybody could access.
No credit card numbers were ever in jeopardy, and Mark overreacted and lied
as usual. Mark has been a crybaby since.

Back to the question. Why, Mark, does Gav not use your last name on QRZ.com?
Yet on one of the Jewish sites you claim to be Mark and Gav Morgan.
And, Mark, care to explain to us why Gav refuses to live with you at your
father's home?
Enquiring minds want to know.

I don't recall anyone here asking you where you were married or honeymooned.
Why do you feel the need to answer a question that wasn't addressed to you?
Guilty conscience?
