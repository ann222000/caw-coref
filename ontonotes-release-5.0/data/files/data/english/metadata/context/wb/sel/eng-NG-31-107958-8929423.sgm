I doubled my distiller capacity this morning from a find in a local
thrift shop I frequent.  This model sells at Sears for $99, on sale if
you'd like a great distiller at a good price.  I paid $9 for it with the
usual broken boiler seal.

The seals fail because they are made of linear seal material and
Waterwise, the actual manufacturer, cuts the material TOO SHORT every
time, then superglues the ends together to form what SHOULD have been an
O-ring, 1/4&quot; in thickness around the seal.

My solution costs, of course, nearly nothing.  1/4&quot; latex hose from Home
Depot, a lifetime supply of seals it's so long, is a couple of bucks and
when cut to the proper length, I use polyester 1/4&quot; water hose made for
your freezer's ice maker to make a 1&quot; interconnecting nipple to put the
ends together making the latex hose airtight and full of air.  When the
heat comes up on the boiler, the pressure inside the hose, of course,
increases, forming a very tight, steam-proof seal in the stainless steel
cover's groove.  Nothing escapes, even after 2 years of service, in my
other Waterwise distiller, a better model than this with a clock-timer
and computer which tracks the carbon filter hours.  The original seal is
long forgotten because Sears wanted $16 for a tiny length of door seal,
last time I checked a few years ago.  My seal works much better, once the
hose gets hot a few times so it conforms to the groove and stops binding
with the pot.  The longer it's used, the better it works.

Sears' price of $99 is VERY much more reasonable than Waterwise wants at
$469.00 for the one with the digital control in it!  Sears must be
closing them out as they didn't sell well over $100.  They didn't really
&quot;sell&quot; them, they stocked them with the chinzy carbon filters.

This stainless steel distill WILL turn seawater into distilled water at
about 2.8ppm total dissolved solids.  I've tried it with mine, just for
the hell of it.  Hell, creek or lake water leaves LESS residue in the pot
than Charleston city water!  Of course, seawater cakes the boiler with
solid salt after you boil the water off it, but it washes right off the
stainless steel this boiler is made from with a light plastic brush.
It'll make 4 gallons per day if you have shore power or a 2KW+ genset
running continuously.

Instead of buying the overly-expensive carbon filters that go in the top
of the carafes on both my distillers, I buy coffee filter paper made for
old-fashioned percolators that are just flat sheets that fold up around
the coffee with holes in them for the tube.  I fold at these holes and
push into the carafe's filter holder, fill with activated carbon from
WalMart's fish tank department (16 oz is $3, a lifetime supply), and fold
the paper neatly over it to seal the carbon granules inside while I put
it in the cover, upside down pushing up until it clicks.  Works great,
change it every 100 gallons or when the water starts tasting slightly
metallic, indicating the carbon has loaded up with benzene, which
distillers also distill out of the water.

An overall good day at the thrift shop.  The other day I bought a Netgear
MR814 v3 4-port + wireless router for $4 with the Netgear wall wart, no
book.  Luckily, thrift shop employees aren't well versed in data network
gear...(c;  It sells for $99, too!

What is the motivation to use a distiller if you have a city water
supply?

Also, is this unit really an option instead of a water-maker for
anchored sail-boats away from city water?
How does it compare at 4 gallons for 500 watts X 24 hours compared to
a water-maker?

Or is it really just for cleaning up the fresh water from your tank
before ingesting?

The reverse osmosis  water maker (admittedly not a new one) on my boat
makes about 1 gph using 5 amps at 12V, so this is about 60 WH/gal.

The one you bought is using 500 watts for 24 hours/4 gallons which is
3000 WH/gal.  It uses 50 times more energy.

My Spectra makes 8 gph at 8 amps.  That makes R/O a full order a

&gt;My personal motivation is to stop the KIDNEY STONES!  Charleston's
&gt;lakewater/riverwater public water supply is full of elemental dissolved
&gt;calcium, enough to make stalactites I think.  The whole inside of my
&gt;distillers are coated with it, like concrete.  It takes some exotic acid

Someone sent me an email looking for a comparison.  Of course, RO sellers
think RO is best and distiller sellers, like this guy, think distillation
is best.  I happen to agree with the latter for the reasons shown on:
http://www.qualitywatersystems.net/education.html
One of my distillers is 30 years old and, though not as efficient and
easy to use as these new countertop models I prefer now, works perfectly
at around 1.8 ppm total dissolved solids after carbon filtration....after
30 years of ABUSE.  If your RO membrane gets a pinhole in it, you'll
never know it....until someone gets sick, which is EXACTLY what I think
happens on RO-equipped cruise ships where massive gastrointestinal
outbreaks occurs.  All the people on the ship are drinking RO'd
seawater...the common element to everyone that's sick.

I looked but can't find the article I read about bacterial breakdown
against the RO membrane.  I suppose many RO interests don't want it on
the net.  It was about the bacteria breaking apart under the pressures RO
uses, then the toxins in the bacteria being released, passing right
through the filter membrane into the output side.  It was a scary report
I'm sure many would want BURIED....

About $1/gallon, some more (designer labels from exotic places).
Distilled water has NO minerals.  This is NOT harmful!  Water is the
CLEANER for body waste, not a source of nutrients.  Elemental molecules
in it simply make it less of a cleaner.  Case in point, water with
dissolved calcium or iron, etc., is BAD FOR YOU.  Your body doesn't get
iron from iron in the water or calcium for good bones from calcium.  The
body makes PAINFUL kidney stones filtering the calcium out!  I have many
first hand experiences!

The filter business lives to tell potential buyers how awful clean water
is for them...with no &quot;nutrients&quot; in it.  It's a TOTAL LIE.

Space is not a problem for an engine distiller.  We simply replace the
water-cooling exhaust system with a primary boiler to suck the heat out
of the exhaust gasses, cooling the exhaust like we're doing now, by
making STEAM, not heating seawater.  The same indirect engine cooling
system in use today, is replaced by a transmission oil primary loop
running at 300F, hot enough to heat a boiler to steam, and replace the
seawater cooling system with a seawater feedwater-to-steam plant,
complete with a backflush to wash out the salt when you shut it down.
The seawater steam condensor is simply a stainless steel version of the
freon condensor in any seawater cooled marine air condition you already
have on the boat.  Seawater condenses the steam into pure water in a
stainless, not copper, pipe for collection and use.  The heat transferred
to the seawater is dumped overboard or can be used to heat fresh water in
the water tank.  Because steam gives up its heat in condensation, there's
LOTS of heat coming out of it.....nearly, we hope, 100% of the heat you
put in if there's no leakage...which is impossible.  There's plenty of
hot seawater to heat the hot water tank on the way overboard.

A genset exhaust is also an excellent source for a seawater distiller
heat source....

Larry,

Explain that again in one syllable words for me :-)

As I understand what you are saying you mean to remove the present
water cooled exhaust manifold from the cooling system and replace it
with a heat exchanger device to heat what? Water to make steam or oil
to heat water to make steam? Or did I miss something there?

The reason I ask is because many years ago I maintained a distillation
plant that used exhaust heat to make steam. If I remember correctly
the primary power was a Perkins 4-108 diesel and it didn't make enough
exhaust heat to boil water at sea level atmospheric pressure. The
distillation vessel was heated as hot as possible using the exhaust
and then an engine driven vacuum pump dropped the pressure in the
still to create steam at temperatures lower then 212F.

Whether this was done to increase thruput or because exhaust heat
alone was not sufficient I do not recollect.

In any event, given the cost of reverse osmosis systems using engine
heat would seem rather attractive.

What Larry's talking about is using a liquid medium near the exhaust
that will transport the heat to the distiller, similar to what nuke
plants do, but I think they still use water for the transfer.
He mentioned trans fluid, and I'm not sure of its specific heat, but
there are &quot;better&quot; or more appropriate heat transfer mechanisms than
water, as seen in freon A/C.
In any case, though I'm far from an expert in this, I did operate
steam plants in the Navy and acquired but never used a Stationary
license, so I speaking with *some* experience.
As I said before, complexity and size are the impediments to what
Larry is after.  Science finds nothing magical in capturing and moving
heat.
But every time I've seen it done it involved sound materials selection
and engineering, bulky heat transfer vessels, and huge amounts of
insulation.

Probably both.  Since the purpose was to make water, they used a
combination that made the most water.  Engine exhaust is certainly
hot enough to boil water.  If the same engine was driving the vacuum
pump, that's good, because a diesel's designed purpose is to create
mechanical power.  No doubt you know all this, so I hope my talking
hasn't put you to sleep.

It would be good to see development and competition bring the initial
cost of RO units down.  I'm still interested in Larry's thoughts about
the &quot;bacteria&quot; issues he has seen in RO units. His thoughts on the
cruise boat ailments being related to the watermakers are very
interesting.
In the meantime, his stovetop distillers are working well for him, and
use heat in a time-tested and pretty efficient way, with almost direct
application of flame to water.

To BOIL, not heat, seawater into steam...while still flushing the
manifold with a tiny bit of seawater to carry the salt, biologicals and
pollutants overboard at 212F.  I want to turn the exhaust manifold into
an evaporator, just like the big ships USED to have before RO.  The water
in the exhaust heat exchanger would have a controlled flow of seawater
into it to A) maintain boiling temperature while B) flushing out the
remnants overboard, self flushing evaporator, which isn't new.

In addition, I want to replace the antifreeze in the water jacket with
transmission fluid, or any free fluid that has a higher boiling point
than water like transmission fluid, that must A) not boil, itself, other
than at the head like the antifreeze does, now...and B) transfer higher
than 300F heat to a secondary heat exchanger, another boiler heated by
the coolant, not exhaust gasses, to boil even more seawater in a
secondary self-flushing boiler.  Both these steam outputs would go to
one, or if necessary two, stainless steel condensors that look exactly
like the pipe-in-a-pipe freon condensors on a marine air conditioner,
which is very compact.  This condensor would have a seawater jacket
around the central stainless steel steam pipe it cools, dumping the heat
of condensation into the hot water tank heat exchanger before dumping
excess heat overboard.  The condensor only need be pulled apart far
enough so that gravity will drain the distilled water out of it at your
worst angle of heel so it doesn't vapor lock...and be mounted above the
engine far enough so only steam can reach it from the gas outlet of the
various boilers below.

A power boat wasting millions of Btu/day would sink from fresh water
flooding if this thing were left tanking it all.  Being as the distilled
water output from this contraption were HOT water, not cold as with RO,
you might even be able to just tank it for that hot shower, directly.
The water coming out of my steam condensor will burn you at 200F.  To get
a cold drink, you'd have to cool the engine distiller's water before
drinking it....maybe with further seawater cooling, which is plentiful.

There's so much great heat just going up the stacks and running out of
the boat from the seawater indirect cooling systems on these monsters
it's pitiful!  Heat is POWER!  All it needs is useful conversion.  I've
never figured out why a big power boat doesn't have a Stirling genset
running off its waste exhaust heat, alone!  God, it's certainly hot
enough with enough Btus.

It's not?  That's most interesting.  Maybe we should put the fluid
coolant heat exchanger AFTER the exhaust heat exchanger and use the
exhaust heat as a pre-heater if that's so.  Anyone who forgot to open
cooling water thruhull valve KNOWS how much heat and steam the water
jacket can make!  Hell, we're only using 30-35% of the energy in the fuel
we're paying $3.50/gallon for, now.  The rest of it goes overboard as
waste heat.

Pulling a vacuum on the boilers is also an excellent idea that's been
used since the 1800s, or maybe even before to reduce the boiling point.
I was trying to keep this as simple as possible and free running into
current water tankage.

I wonder why that system allowed all that water jacket heat that's so
hard to get rid of to boil even more seawater?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Whether this was done to increase thruput or because exhaust heat
&gt; alone was not sufficient I do not recollect.

&gt; In any event, given the cost of reverse osmosis systems using engine
&gt; heat would seem rather attractive.
">

And any RO uses more power which equals more fuel expense we can no
longer afford.  It's a shame to let so much heat just blow out the stacks
and be poured overboard as hot seawater when there are so many uses for
it....like distillation, heat engines driving gensets, etc.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

I love things like this.  When I was using my little 1KW Honda EU1000i
genset to power the service van, I noted that its tiny exhaust was
exiting separately from its air cooling exhaust.  So, I welded a pipe
nipple to the engine exhaust so I could pipe it where I wanted it.  The
exhaust gas and cooling air exhaust come out on the same end through some
plastic louvers.

The truck is cold in winter with only a small engine heater for the
driver.  The back was always cold to work in.  So, I moved the tiny
genset from its mount outside the rear door to inside the back of the
&quot;cabin&quot; and used some flexible natural gas pipe, stainless steel with
external ribs that would act as a radiator, made into a big loop behind a
cabinet where there was a void open to the cabin air.  The exhaust heated
the tubing, the tubing heated the air, what came out was really HOT air
wafting up from behind the cabinet.  The cooled exhaust gasses went
through a hole in the deck to be vented to atmosphere below the truck's
floor.  Exhaust gas is heavier than air, so it vents away from the cabin
and this also drains the water vapor that condenses in my heat
exchanger...it runs a full stream, suitable to fill my PortaPottie!  The
exhaust gas is about 75F coming out...a good exchange of heat.  Because
the genset is INSIDE the cabin, all of the waste heat coming out of its
air cooled engine is POURING out onto the deck of the cabin.  I'm
recovering around 98% of all waste heat.  When it's 30F outside the
poorly-insulated truck box, I can make it 80F inside in an hour!.....and
have up to 1KW of electrical power, 120VAC 60 Hz to power the shop.  The
noise was awful...so I built a foam cabinet out of 4&quot; thick foam packing
crate foam I got for free.  The cabin air intake to cool the engine goes
through a little foam muffler on the intake end.  The exhaust gas heat
exchanger and cooling air outlet goes through yet another foam muffler I
built onto the other end...making it amazingly more quiet.
Voila!...Gasoline heater and genset!  You wouldn't want to live with
it...but it sure is nice trying to work on a cold day in January where
it's WARM as Toast!...(c;  After all, old cars had exhaust gas heat
exchangers heating the cars back in the early part of the 20th
Century....not hot water heaters which came later.  1 gallon of gas
provides electrical power and cabin heat for all day....(c;

I don't own a stovetop distiller.  Mine are all electric, 1 commercial

from Waterwise in Florida.  I paid $9 for it at a thrift shop, hardly

http://www.waterwise.com/products/products.asp
One of my units is the 8800, but the Sears-branded model.  The newest one
looks like the 8800, but is a Sear-only unit that's much cheaper without
the computer/clock controls.  It resets by simply resetting the kettle
trip overtemp thermostat with a push button under the handle.  Sears
sells them for about $100.  Makes not quite a gallon.  The 8800 makes
over a gallon in 4 hours.  Both units work excellently with no steam
leakage and great convenience.

I buy Deer Park brand 3 litre polycarbonate bottled water from the
grocery store.  I'm not interested in the city water they bottle, just
the bottle itself.  These make excellent storage bottles for my output.
They have two dimples molded into the strong plastic for non-protruding
handles and a LARGE CAP to make it easier to fill.  I just dump the
product down the drain when I finally wear out one of my 6 bottles in
storage.  I used to distill into 5 gallon commercial water bottles.  I
have 3 real glass ones I can sanitize in the oven, not polycarb plastic.
I also have an Oasis bottled water cooler to put them in, making really
great, REALLY COLD water always available.  I paid $25 for the big
cooler, another thrift shop bargain....(c;  It plugs in, of course.

Have you sent Poland a &quot;Billy Bass&quot; plaque, yet?!  The novelty wears off
them really fast, too.  I see 10 a week at the local thrift shop
shelves....(c;

The parrots are very irritating, but so are all pets, sometimes.  But,
I'm typing this with my hand-raised Blue and Gold Macaw sitting on my
shoulder....on one foot.....asleep....leaning against my right ear.  I
can hear his little two-chambered, simple heart beating away through his
left wing.  I don't see how they live 100 years with it beating so hard,
even while asleep!  It's just thumping away.  His head is under his right
wing, where they store it while sleeping.  He snores and that one foot
he's balanced on sure has a strong grip if I move, even while he's
sleeping.  It grabs on right through my t-shirt into the skin...ouch!

I used to keep fish, but every time I took them out of the tank to teach
them to talk....they always died, so I switched to parrots.

I've had birds most of my life.  My first bird was a common crow that
fell out of a nest in my grandmother's front yard in upstate NY.  I hand
fed it from the information in a book I found at Powers' Library in our
little town that was 100 years old.  It lived outside in Summer and
inside in winter when it should have flown south.  When I was in
elementary school, school let out at 3PM.  That crow knew the time!  It
would wait for me to exit the building, then swoop down and land on my
head, and only my head, in the sea of children running out of the
building.  I think he liked me...(c;  When I was in the 8th grade, one
day, it never showed up again and was never seen again, much to my hurt
and dismay.  I'm glad I never found him dead.  I like to think he found
him a mate...(c;

Well, I think I'll put &quot;Roger-Roger&quot; (he says his name just like some
pilot on the radio) back in his cage and go get some dinner....He'll be
looking for me to put him over a garbage can to &quot;bomb&quot; as soon as I wake
him.  He's the best trained bird I ever had...POTTY TRAINED!  That took 3
years of patience before he got it right.  It's much better than the
skating around on bird skates my Yellow Nape, &quot;Zeke&quot;, can do.  He will
not poop on you unless he just can't help it.  Very hard to teach them.
Oh, the sequence is to put him over the can (with plastic bag, please!),
say &quot;Do your business.&quot;, to him.  He will then look at the can, probably
something to do with &quot;targeting&quot;, sometimes adding &quot;DROP IT!&quot; in a deep,
low voice if he remembers, then &quot;bombing the target&quot;....followed by
yelling, &quot;BOMBS AWAY!!&quot; VERY LOUDLY....to the delight of anyone who sees
it....(c;  I've only seen one other bird that duplicates this trick, but
have been told of many others.  Teaching them how to skate is really easy
in comparison....(c;

&quot;NO BITING!&quot;....MY favorite trick!

If you, a stranger, approach his cage and peer in at him, he's trained to
say, &quot;Oh-oh...Now what?!&quot;....(c;   Great fun, every time.

As I pass his cage in the dark on my way to my bedroom, he says, &quot;'Nite
Bird.&quot;, very quietly.....because that's what I used to say to him when he
was a chick.  When I got him he was 3 days out of the egg, hand feeding
every hour or so, 24/7.  He's about as long as a yardstick, now, when his
tailfeathers are new and in good condition.  He can cut a whole Brazil
nut in half, melting that beak through it like a knife through butter.
He can also pick up the thinnest grape without puncturing its thin skin,
put the point of that beak inside through the skin and use his tongue to
rotate his beak around inside that grape to root out the guts of it to
eat...leaving a skin so thin you can see through it on the floor.....so
delicate it's amazing.  If he wants to bite you, he could cut off your
wrist.  He can also take hold of your ear and stick that leathery tongue
into your ear canal...just to get a taste of you....OR TO FEED YOU WHAT'S
IN HIS CROP IF YOU LOOK LIKE YOU NEED FEEDING!...(C;.....Yecch!!

Larry, somehow the saying &quot;there ain't no such thing as a free lunch&quot;
kept popping into my head as I read your post.   It is my
understanding that phase change methods of water purification take
about an order of magnitude more energy than filtration systems to
convert sea water to drinkable water.  So, it seems to me that if you
are going to harness the &quot;excess&quot; heat or the excess velocity of the
exhaust gases to convert sea water to potable water you would be much
better off using R/0 in pure heat terms.   Doubtlessly I am missing
something obvious but perhaps I am not alone in this as most cruise
ships and municipalities that do seawater conversion use R/O even
though they tend to have lots of heat available from their diesel
generation systems.  Sorry to be dense about this. What am I missing?

&gt;&gt; As I understand what you are saying you mean to remove the present
&gt;&gt; water cooled exhaust manifold from the cooling system and replace it
&gt;&gt; with a heat exchanger device to heat what? Water to make steam or oil
&gt;&gt; to heat water to make steam? Or did I miss something there?

&gt;To BOIL, not heat, seawater into steam...while still flushing the

&gt;in the exhaust heat exchanger would have a controlled flow of seawater
&gt;into it to A) maintain boiling temperature while B) flushing out the
&gt;remnants overboard, self flushing evaporator, which isn't new.
">

In general I agree but practically I'm not sure how much heat you can
pump into the exhaust water jacket considering that we still want the
engine to do its primary job of pushing the boat and exhaust back
pressure effects horsepower output.

Having said that I suspect that there would be some lower limit on the
size of the engine below which the system is not going to produce
enough BTU's of heat to evaporate a usable amount of water.

If you are using a, say, 50 H.P. engine then a very small volume of
water keeps the engine cool while if we are using a 2,000 HP engine
then it requires a substantial amount of water to remove the heat.

In short, the difference between a small fire and a big one.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;In addition, I want to replace the antifreeze in the water jacket with
&gt;transmission fluid, or any free fluid that has a higher boiling point
&gt;than water like transmission fluid, that must A) not boil, itself, other
&gt;than at the head like the antifreeze does, now...and B) transfer higher
&gt;than 300F heat to a secondary heat exchanger, another boiler heated by
&gt;the coolant, not exhaust gasses, to boil even more seawater in a
&gt;secondary self-flushing boiler.  Both these steam outputs would go to
&gt;one, or if necessary two, stainless steel condensors that look exactly
&gt;like the pipe-in-a-pipe freon condensors on a marine air conditioner,
&gt;which is very compact.  This condensor would have a seawater jacket
&gt;around the central stainless steel steam pipe it cools, dumping the heat
&gt;of condensation into the hot water tank heat exchanger before dumping
&gt;excess heat overboard.  The condensor only need be pulled apart far
&gt;enough so that gravity will drain the distilled water out of it at your
&gt;worst angle of heel so it doesn't vapor lock...and be mounted above the
&gt;engine far enough so only steam can reach it from the gas outlet of the
&gt;various boilers below.
">

Again, the theory is good but I'm not sure about how it works in
practice.

I say this because every design engineer understands that heat is
energy and if it were practical internal combustion engines would be
running at much higher temperatures then they do now. I suspect that
higher temperature operation would be getting into the realm of exotic
materials, difference in expansions of various engine parts, etc. I
also suspect that lubrication would be a problem. Jet engine oil, for
example operates at much higher temperatures then internal combustion
engine oil but has far less lubricity (as a bunch of USAF folk learned
to their despair when we converted the APU's from internal combustion
power to turbine units).

&gt;A power boat wasting millions of Btu/day would sink from fresh water
&gt;flooding if this thing were left tanking it all.  Being as the distilled
&gt;water output from this contraption were HOT water, not cold as with RO,
&gt;you might even be able to just tank it for that hot shower, directly.
&gt;The water coming out of my steam condensor will burn you at 200F.  To get
&gt;a cold drink, you'd have to cool the engine distiller's water before
&gt;drinking it....maybe with further seawater cooling, which is plentiful.

&gt;There's so much great heat just going up the stacks and running out of
&gt;the boat from the seawater indirect cooling systems on these monsters
&gt;it's pitiful!  Heat is POWER!  All it needs is useful conversion.  I've
&gt;never figured out why a big power boat doesn't have a Stirling genset
&gt;running off its waste exhaust heat, alone!  God, it's certainly hot
&gt;enough with enough Btus.

&gt;&gt; The reason I ask is because many years ago I maintained a distillation
&gt;&gt; plant that used exhaust heat to make steam. If I remember correctly
&gt;&gt; the primary power was a Perkins 4-108 diesel and it didn't make enough
&gt;&gt; exhaust heat to boil water at sea level atmospheric pressure. The
&gt;&gt; distillation vessel was heated as hot as possible using the exhaust
&gt;&gt; and then an engine driven vacuum pump dropped the pressure in the
&gt;&gt; still to create steam at temperatures lower then 212F.

&gt;It's not?  That's most interesting.  Maybe we should put the fluid
&gt;coolant heat exchanger AFTER the exhaust heat exchanger and use the
&gt;exhaust heat as a pre-heater if that's so.  Anyone who forgot to open
&gt;cooling water thruhull valve KNOWS how much heat and steam the water
&gt;jacket can make!  Hell, we're only using 30-35% of the energy in the fuel
&gt;we're paying $3.50/gallon for, now.  The rest of it goes overboard as
&gt;waste heat.

&gt;Pulling a vacuum on the boilers is also an excellent idea that's been
&gt;used since the 1800s, or maybe even before to reduce the boiling point.
&gt;I was trying to keep this as simple as possible and free running into
&gt;current water tankage.

&gt;I wonder why that system allowed all that water jacket heat that's so
&gt;hard to get rid of to boil even more seawater?

&gt;&gt; Whether this was done to increase thruput or because exhaust heat
&gt;&gt; alone was not sufficient I do not recollect.

&gt;&gt; In any event, given the cost of reverse osmosis systems using engine
&gt;&gt; heat would seem rather attractive.

&gt;And any RO uses more power which equals more fuel expense we can no
&gt;longer afford.  It's a shame to let so much heat just blow out the stacks
&gt;and be poured overboard as hot seawater when there are so many uses for
&gt;it....like distillation, heat engines driving gensets, etc.

&gt;-----------------------------------------------------------------------

&gt;I love things like this.  When I was using my little 1KW Honda EU1000i
&gt;genset to power the service van, I noted that its tiny exhaust was
&gt;exiting separately from its air cooling exhaust.  So, I welded a pipe
&gt;nipple to the engine exhaust so I could pipe it where I wanted it.  The
&gt;exhaust gas and cooling air exhaust come out on the same end through some
&gt;plastic louvers.

&gt;The truck is cold in winter with only a small engine heater for the
&gt;driver.  The back was always cold to work in.  So, I moved the tiny
&gt;genset from its mount outside the rear door to inside the back of the
&gt;&quot;cabin&quot; and used some flexible natural gas pipe, stainless steel with
&gt;external ribs that would act as a radiator, made into a big loop behind a
&gt;cabinet where there was a void open to the cabin air.  The exhaust heated
&gt;the tubing, the tubing heated the air, what came out was really HOT air
&gt;wafting up from behind the cabinet.  The cooled exhaust gasses went
&gt;through a hole in the deck to be vented to atmosphere below the truck's
&gt;floor.  Exhaust gas is heavier than air, so it vents away from the cabin
&gt;and this also drains the water vapor that condenses in my heat
&gt;exchanger...it runs a full stream, suitable to fill my PortaPottie!  The
&gt;exhaust gas is about 75F coming out...a good exchange of heat.  Because
&gt;the genset is INSIDE the cabin, all of the waste heat coming out of its
&gt;air cooled engine is POURING out onto the deck of the cabin.  I'm
&gt;recovering around 98% of all waste heat.  When it's 30F outside the
&gt;poorly-insulated truck box, I can make it 80F inside in an hour!.....and
&gt;have up to 1KW of electrical power, 120VAC 60 Hz to power the shop.  The
&gt;noise was awful...so I built a foam cabinet out of 4&quot; thick foam packing
&gt;crate foam I got for free.  The cabin air intake to cool the engine goes
&gt;through a little foam muffler on the intake end.  The exhaust gas heat
&gt;exchanger and cooling air outlet goes through yet another foam muffler I
&gt;built onto the other end...making it amazingly more quiet.
&gt;Voila!...Gasoline heater and genset!  You wouldn't want to live with
&gt;it...but it sure is nice trying to work on a cold day in January where
&gt;it's WARM as Toast!...(c;  After all, old cars had exhaust gas heat
&gt;exchangers heating the cars back in the early part of the 20th
&gt;Century....not hot water heaters which came later.  1 gallon of gas

I doubt a cruise ship could produce enough distilled water from waste heat
to feed its hungry passengers.  But, in a situation of a private boat with
2 to 5 passengers aboard, I'm convinced they'll produce far more distilled
water than needed from the waste heat of the engines, in powerboats like
trawlers, motor yachts, bubbleboats.  Anything guzzling that kind of fuel
is making a LOT of waste heat and simply dumping it overboard.

Electricity is political where I live.  In Charleston, a corporation,
SCANA aka South Carolina Electric and Gas, supposedly controlled by the
state charges over 9c/KWh at the house, over 10c/KWh if you use over 750
KWh.  75 miles up the road, the City of Orangeburg, SC, same state,
couldn't get big corporations to wire the city way back when, so decided
to do it themselves like the water system.

http://www.orbgdpu.com/electric.htm
Click on RATES after seeing what they offer their customers.
They sell the SAME electricity, bought from the electrical grid as they
have no power plants except some HUGE gas turbine emergency plants, for
2.4c/KWh for the first 500 KWh...then the rate DROPS (ours rises,
dammit)...over that first 500 KWh, Orangeburg houses pay 1.9c/KWh....not
10.2c/KWh Charleston pays.  No bogus &quot;fuel cost adjustment charges&quot;,
either.

Here's our corporate thieves:

the electric rates.....dammit.

SCANA controls the state, not the other way around.  I discovered this
after my father died and I inherited his mobile home in a trailer park in
Orangeburg.  The city owned utility kept sending me bills for $35/month
so I ran up to see what was wrong with the air conditioning system I was
SURE I left running to prevent mildew inside.  It was still running.  $35
was &quot;normal&quot; for July in SC!  The base charge was $6....no funny charges
noone can explain, no city franchies fees or other bogus charges to raise
the cost 35%....$6!

And they say the government shouldn't be in the electric business....

I think I see.  I suppose this is just a matter of perspective, but we
often get 8-10 gallons of drinking water from the excess amps on the
solar array in a sunny anchorage using R/O.  That's a lot of water for
two people who are used to conserving.  It would be a good deal less
thrilling to get 0.8 of a gallon even if it was of fantastic quality.
But unlike your example boats we live on a very strict energy budget
when we're cruising.

Just playing devil's advocate, wouldn't it make more sense for the
bubble boat crowd to use their waste heat to R/O a lot of water to
shower, wash dishes, fill the jacuzzi and so on and then distill their
drinking water from the R/Oed water in one of Sear's finest counter

My understanding is that Larry simply prefers distilled water, and has
given reasons why.  Mineral content, and possible bacterial
contamination of RO water.
Though I am not well versed in this, and have not tested the waters.
distilled and RO are different, aren't they?
He never said distilling was more energy efficient than RO, but was
looking to capture engine waste heat to make distilling more efficient
than it is using conventional methods.
And if it could be done, it would be of benefit to sailboats too,
since they are often under power, and their engines waste many,
BTUs.  Capturing wasted BTUs is the most important issue.

Most bottled waters are lightly filtered &quot;city&quot; or well water. Perrier

You can probably get better water for FAR less by putting a simple

Most minerals won't be filtered out, but some of the &quot;gunk&quot; Larry's

You might be surprised. Friend had a 42' trawler that used about 1 gph

Oh, if that's all then I think it is a great idea.  I thought his
argument was that distilling using engine heat was more efficient and
was responding to his post of Sept 8 where he said:

&quot;And any RO uses more power which equals more fuel expense we can no
longer afford.  It's a shame to let so much heat just blow out the
stacks
and be poured overboard as hot seawater when there are so many uses
for
it....like distillation, heat engines driving gensets, etc. &quot;

This confused me because RO uses much LESS energy than steam
distillation.  So, basically the question I've been asking all along
is:  If the heat is available to do work then why not use it to make
RO water which will give you a lot more water for your work than
steam?   I gather from you that the answer is &quot;because I want steam
distilled water and I don't get any of that from RO.&quot;  I'm good with
that.  It was the &quot;more power&quot; thing that threw me.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;... Though I am not well versed in this, and have not tested the waters.
&gt; distilled and RO are different, aren't they?
">

Yes, Larry is right, there may be qualitative differences between
typical RO water and steam distilled water.  His preferences in this
seem defensible to me as long as we're talking about drinking water
and not washing or cooking water.  RO desalinated water is probably
better than the water that comes out of your taps at home if you don't
filter it.  It is good enough for drinking -- I'm a lot happier
drinking it than the water that gets used in most of the developing
world -- but for some things steam distilled could be better yet.
Steam distilled water is a luxury version of drinking water.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

I think Larry said he didn't think it would be practical for sailboats
(he used all those big letters), but it would be neat if it was

Well, it's pretty well established - I think - that Larry doesn't want
RO water.  He wants distilled water.  You have said, &quot;Steam distilled
water is a luxury version of drinking water.&quot;
IMO, Larry is not one bit averse to luxury.
At the same time, and perhaps in other threads, Larry has talked
about engine waste heat recovery as a separate issue.
And it is.
How the waste heat is used is a different matter entirely, though
Larry happened to be talking about distilling when it came up, or
maybe he was thinking about waste heat and distilling all at once.
Hell if I know.
But theoretically you may use the waste heat to generate electricity
to run RO, the TV, an A/C unit, etc, or to heat hot water for the
shower, or to distill.
The only one I see happening is heating the hot water tank, which
is closer to a distilling system than to a system that generates
electricity.
Hey, too bad they don't make thermal blankets/material that could
enclose an engine compartment and generate electricity from the heat.
I'm not up in physics, and don't know how solar cells work, whether
they use UV or IR, but they work.
I offer my apologies to Larry for butting in and making assumptions,
but figured he could use some time with his parrots anyway.

Because boiling seawater into steam from the waste heat off an engine is
about as simple a thing to do as you can get.  To make an RO run off waste
heat, you have to convert it to PRESSURE, probably to electricity to run
the RO's pump and computer, right?  I want to simply boil seawater into
steam in heat exchangers running off hot exhaust gasses and engine
coolant....making distilled water for NOTHING in fuel and very little in
maintenance.

Legionnair's disease is not caused by broken down anything, or by

Depends on whether your still is really effective or not.  If you're
only condensing *steam*, i.e. not water vapor but gaseous steam, you may
be correct.  However, unless your still is a multi-effect (doubtful) or
uses some form of cyclonic separation (doubtful), and uses some form of
demisting (also doubtful), you don't have quite the assurance you think
you do. Almost certainly any organisms will be inactivated, but you may
still have endotoxin carryover.

Well Larry, rail as you will about RO, but you can make Water for
Injection with double pass RO. That's injection, in your veins, and you
worry about drinking it? Granted, there's a further *sterilization*
step, but that has nothing to do with all the &quot;toxins&quot; you seem obsessed

&gt;&gt;I take it from the nasty ad hominem zinger that I'm being a pain.
&gt;&gt;Sorry about that.  Just for the record, there are many very desirable

&gt;&gt;to use steam distillation even in &quot;POWER boats with ENGINES running&quot;
&gt;&gt;when the same amount of heat differential would give you vastly more
&gt;&gt;fresh water if you used it to run R/O filtration?

&gt;My understanding is that Larry simply prefers distilled water, and has
&gt;given reasons why.  Mineral content, and possible bacterial
&gt;contamination of RO water.
&gt;Though I am not well versed in this, and have not tested the waters.
&gt;distilled and RO are different, aren't they?
&gt;He never said distilling was more energy efficient than RO, but was
&gt;looking to capture engine waste heat to make distilling more efficient
&gt;than it is using conventional methods.
&gt;And if it could be done, it would be of benefit to sailboats too,
&gt;since they are often under power, and their engines waste many,
&gt;BTUs.  Capturing wasted BTUs is the most important issue

Engine heat powered stills, in sizes suitable for yachts, were on the
market decades ago. RO killed the market for them.

&gt;Well, it's pretty well established - I think - that Larry doesn't want

&gt;water is a luxury version of drinking water.&quot;
&gt;IMO, Larry is not one bit averse to luxury.
&gt;At the same time, and perhaps in other threads, Larry has talked
&gt;about engine waste heat recovery as a separate issue.
&gt;And it is.
&gt;How the waste heat is used is a different matter entirely, though
&gt;Larry happened to be talking about distilling when it came up, or
&gt;maybe he was thinking about waste heat and distilling all at once.
&gt;Hell if I know.
&gt;But theoretically you may use the waste heat to generate electricity
">

The only really efficient way to convert fuel to shaft work is with a
diesel engine, and the small ones are nearly as good as very large
ones. Steam has to be huge to be efficient. I mean a cube 100 feet on
a side for the boiler. You could use the heat in the engine coolant to
boil propane, if you had cold water, 40F, say, that is. All engines
work on temperature differences. Heat moves from hot to cold, and you
can siphon off some of the energy as shaft work, if you are clever
enough.

This is on the market. Most engines are actually cooled by glycol,
which is, in turn, cooled by water. Fresh water or sea water, the

THAT boat would have enough excess heat to boil some water, though
still (couldn't resist) less than their demands.

BTW, though I don't believe a small engine such as ours could
practically boil much water --that last degree to flash to steam is a
killer-- it seems a good idea to distill water drawn from the hot water
tank, gaining a good bit of the required BTUs for free.

Uh, Larry: They don't *boil* the water in most restaurants, only get it
pretty hot.

Years ago, I worked at a shore hotel where they had a large metal bowl
that held the grounds atop the carafe. A tube led down to the bottom of
the carafe. Water started in the carafe, boiled up into the bowl, then
was vacuumed down when the assemblage was removed from the heat.

Shame I didn't drink coffee then, as I was told it was excellent.

There is no water vapor making its way out of the water trap in the top
of the boiler.  Water doesn't run well uphill with no pressure.  There's
a special trap in the top to prevent it.  I've never heard of endotoxin
vaporizing only the various ...enes like benzene, xylene, all carbon-
based that are trapped by the activated carbon filter the water coming
out passes ever so slowly through so these distillable petroleum products
attach themselves.  You can easily taste these in the un-carbon-treated
distilled water.  The taste is significantly different after carbon
filtration.

Another sign is my water will not conduct electricity, even at 2000 volts
from my megger.  Distilled water is an insulator uncontaminated.  ONE
grain of table salt just touching the water on the other side of a
container of it and ZOOM!....The current goes WAY up!  I cannot get my
polycarbonate containers to get the TDS below about 1.9 ppm.  I think the
containers themselves are being eaten by the really corrosive distilled
water, which causes a tiny leakage in the electrical test.

RO water has its place.  But, there ARE bad problems with RO if it is not
meticulously maintained.  And, it takes a lab test to see if it's safe
boaters don't have, placing WAY TOO MUCH FAITH in the integrity of that
membrane, I think.
