Hello,

I am computer scientist and usually really like fancy technology. But
I just had my first flight with a &quot;glass&quot; PFD (Avidyne) and must say I
am not impressed. In particular reading altitude and airpeed from
these scrolling bands requires a lot more attention than with regular
gauges, just like reading a digital clock takes longer than reading an
analog one. Glancing at it and checking against a known picture, like
&quot;speed at 3 o'clock is fine on final&quot; or &quot;altitude at 20 minutes past
midnight is minimum&quot;, just does not work anymore, instead I end up
reading the actual numbers every time I look. Does anyone feel the
same? Am I missing a particular technique?

I figure it's a conspiracy to make flying as much like a video game as
possible.  Pretty soon, all the pilots over 40 will be eradicated in
mid-airs and CFITs arising from display fixation, and the young'uns
will transition to simulations and never notice that they aren't
actually flying anywhere -- which will be good, because they couldn't
have afforded the fuel anyway.

These newsgroups will live on, of course.

Perhaps you should inform Avidyne of your less than satisfactory
experience with the ergonomics of their product.  It would be
interesting to see their response.  Who knows, you might be able to
motivate them to provide an 'analog gage' mode switch on future
versions.

I suppose you are making a joke, but there may be considerable truth in what
you say.

As computers enter many domains in which they had not previously been used,
the &quot;computer mindset&quot; also tends to pollute those domains, since the ergonomy
of computer software is often a function of the preferences of the developers
who build it.  I note that glass cockpits bear a suspicious resemblance to
PC-based interfaces, a likely sign that the developers knew a lot more about
PCs than they did about cockpit designs.  The glass cockpits drift towards an
interface that looks like something you'd see on a laptop computer, rather
than something you'd see in a traditional cockpit.  I don't think this is a
good thing.  Indeed, it is one of my objections to glass cockpits, especially
the highly integrated kind often installed in small aircraft (think G1000).

I am a fellow computer geek, and a student pilot.  I usually fly a
plane with steam gauges, but a couple of times now I have flown with
digital displays.  Like you, I found it a little hard to adjust to the
digital displays.  The digital displays I was using presented altitude
and tachometer values simply as numbers.  The analog displays I am
used to present these values as positions on a dial, showing the
current value in its context of a spectrum of values.  With the analog
displays, I am used to adjusting the position of the pointer.  With
the digital display, I need to simply set the correct numerical
value.  It's a little mental adjustment, and given that I am a newbie
to all this it is an extra distraction.

But, I do think that it is mostly a matter of what you are used to.
If you started out working with a digital display, and had to switch
to a steam gauge, I think it would be just as much of an adjustment.
I think that the human brain is a pretty flexible instrument, and I
suspect it wouldn't take long to get used to setting a numerical value
rather than the position of a needle on a dial.  Both are valid
methods of presenting the information.  Either way, it is simply a
feedback mechanism you use to make sure the airplane is doing what it
should.

Flying is a right hand brain activity. At least the handling portion is.
The right hand side of the brain dosn't do abstractions like numbers, at
least not until the left hand side (which can't fly worth a shit) sends
it over to the right side in a readily digestable form which enables the
right brain to chew it into a picture.

An analogue display cuts the left hand side out of the loop and enables
the calcualtion rate to increase the right sides &quot;frame rate&quot; so that
corrections can be made more frequently thus enabling the pilot to fly
the airplane more smooothly and with more authority.
Caorse rule of thumb math can be laid over this for descent angles,
interceptin angles and wo on, but generally, the fewer numbers involved,
the better.
People who prefer the numbers usualy don't fly very well at all.

You don't do trig while you're shooting pool and expect to win the game.

You'll get used to it... there is a transition time to go from round
dial to tapes, but once you get used to tapes you will find that they
do have certain advantages.  I worked on the 777 EFIS, which used the
tape format, and after several hours in the 777 simulator, the tapes
became as easy to read at a glance as the round dials.  It just takes
conditioning your mind to be able to rapidly scan them, and being able
to pick up trend information from the tape motion instead of needle
motion.  At least that was my experience.

A lot of human factors work went into the tape formats, and it was
with the understanding that training would be required for pilots to
adapt to them.

Many reviewers have mentioned this. It seems to be mostly a mater of
training. Also, setting the respective bugs to the desired value seems
to help most pilots.

I have never seen the system for the 777, but I did get a look at the low
end equipment at the LSA Expo in Sebring Florida, and felt that what I saw
was pure crap!

It is certainly possible to make a tape motion system that works well, and I
have seen some &quot;physical&quot; versions that I liked when I was an avionics tech
twenty years ago.  However, those have a moving needle which moved in
opposition to the moving tape and at a slower rate than the tape.  The
result was that the needle gave the coarse indication, at a glance, and the
tape gave the precise measurement when required--and, in the case of a
higher flying aircraft which would require a three needle altimeter, may
have been more intuitive to read.

However, on the implementations that I have seen, the representations of
needles were fixed and the numbers moved on a virtual card or tape.  In my
opinion, they were egregeous!

That's interesting. Do you have any reference of research comparing
various display methods? Tapes for speed and altitude in today's
cockpits are ubiquitous of course. So far I thought it was a case of
someone starting it and others just copying it.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I just had my first flight with a &quot;glass&quot; PFD (Avidyne) and must
say
&gt;&gt; I
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; am not impressed. In particular reading altitude and airpeed from
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; these scrolling bands requires a lot more attention than with
regular
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; gauges, just like reading a digital clock takes longer than reading
&gt;&gt; an
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; analog one. Glancing at it and checking against a known picture,
like
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;speed at 3 o'clock is fine on final&quot; or &quot;altitude at 20 minutes
past
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; midnight is minimum&quot;, just does not work anymore, instead I end up
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; reading the actual numbers every time I look. Does anyone feel the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; same? Am I missing a particular technique?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Arno

&gt;&gt;&gt; I am a fellow computer geek, and a student pilot.  I usually fly a
&gt;&gt;&gt; plane with steam gauges, but a couple of times now I have flown with
&gt;&gt;&gt; digital displays.  Like you, I found it a little hard to adjust to
the
&gt;&gt;&gt; digital displays.  The digital displays I was using presented
altitude
&gt;&gt;&gt; and tachometer values simply as numbers.  The analog displays I am
&gt;&gt;&gt; used to present these values as positions on a dial, showing the
&gt;&gt;&gt; current value in its context of a spectrum of values.  With the
analog
&gt;&gt;&gt; displays, I am used to adjusting the position of the pointer.  With
&gt;&gt;&gt; the digital display, I need to simply set the correct numerical
&gt;&gt;&gt; value.  It's a little mental adjustment, and given that I am a
newbie
&gt;&gt;&gt; to all this it is an extra distraction.

&gt;&gt;&gt; But, I do think that it is mostly a matter of what you are used to.

&gt;&gt; Flying is a right hand brain activity. At least the handling portion
is.
&gt;&gt; The right hand side of the brain dosn't do abstractions like numbers,
at
&gt;&gt; least not until the left hand side (which can't fly worth a shit)
sends
&gt;&gt; it over to the right side in a readily digestable form which enables
the
&gt;&gt; right brain to chew it into a picture.

&gt;&gt; An analogue display cuts the left hand side out of the loop and
enables
&gt;&gt; the calcualtion rate to increase the right sides &quot;frame rate&quot; so that
&gt;&gt; corrections can be made more frequently thus enabling the pilot to
fly
&gt;&gt; the airplane more smooothly and with more authority.
&gt;&gt; Caorse rule of thumb math can be laid over this for descent angles,

Dean,

I just noticed something interesting, looking at pictures of recent
Boeing and Airbus PFDs. For altitude, they are both pretty much the
same, but for the speed tape, Airbus does not have a big number at the
center of the tape but instead the number on top of the tape and just
a thin line at the center. After my experience today I like the Airbus
better because it is less conducive to reading the numbers rather than
&quot;get the picture&quot;:

&gt; You'll get used to it... there is a transition time to go from round
&gt; dial to tapes, but once you get used to tapes you will find that they
&gt; do have certain advantages.  I worked on the 777 EFIS, which used the
&gt; tape format, and after several hours in the 777 simulator, the tapes
&gt; became as easy to read at a glance as the round dials.  It just takes
&gt; conditioning your mind to be able to rapidly scan them, and being able
&gt; to pick up trend information from the tape motion instead of needle
&gt; motion.  At least that was my experience.

Hey Dean, the tape systems I've seen have the scale fixed on the display and
the tape that moves up and down the scale appropriately. That is not how the
Garmin system works from what I've seen. The G1000 in the local 182 actually
moves the scale in relation to a fixed pointer that is mid-scale on the
display, so you have to read numbers relative to a pointer instead of
judging a tape marker relative to a fixed scale. This is much more difficult
than the old fixed scale displays, but I don't see how they could cram as
much on the screen as they do if they still used fixed scale depictions.
Those old instruments used the barberpole concept very well and went right
along with the round gages for system monitoring where we would rotate the
gauges in the panel such that &quot;normal&quot; had all needles pointing the same
direction; no interpretation needed unless one of the needles wasn't
pointing like the rest.

In some ways technology has made the panel much less intuitive and more time
consuming. Think about traffic signals - Red means stop, but we could have
just as easily put up a digital display that said &quot;Cross traffic beginning&quot;.
Which would be easier for the driver to interpret most quickly?

've had a speed tape in front of me for years now and I still look right
past it to the ASI. It does have a useful function in that it flashes if I
get more than a few knots away from bug speed whilst hand flying, but
intuitive use of the ASI needle is al I have found I'd ever need.

As I understand it, the whole right-brain left-brain thing has pretty
much been discredited.  The more recent research shows that any
complex task engages both sides of the brain.  I don't think there
were too many neuroscientists who ever embraced the idea that one side
does &quot;art&quot; and the other side does &quot;math&quot; anyway.

I think the biggest difference between steam gauges and digital
displays is that steam gauges give you a value in context of a
spectrum of values.  When you look at a analog tachometer, you can see
the where the needle is compared to the minimum and maximum values.
If you are trying to set 75% power, it might be useful to have the
information presented that way, because you can see where 3/4 of the
range is.  Same with airspeed.  You can see how close you are to the
red arc, where you are in the green arc, etc.

On the other hand, why would you want to see altitude displayed with
needles?  If I want to fly at a specific altitude, I am looking for a
number, not a position in a range.  I think the traditional altimeter
was made the way it was because it was the easiest way to get a
mechanical instrument to display the information that way, not because
it was the easiest way to digest the information.

Ideally, every instrument should be designed to convey the appropriate
information in a way that is conducive to how that information is
going to be used.  If you just need a value, then a digital display of
a number make sense.  If you need to have a sense of where you are
relative to minimum and maximum, then a display showing relative
position in a range should be used.  The nice thing about a
computerized display is it can be set up to display the information
either way.

&gt; the where the needle is compared to the minimum and maximum values.
&gt; If you are trying to set 75% power, it might be useful to have the
&gt; information presented that way, because you can see where 3/4 of the
&gt; range is.  Same with airspeed.  You can see how close you are to the
&gt; red arc, where you are in the green arc, etc.

&gt; On the other hand, why would you want to see altitude displayed with
&gt; needles?  If I want to fly at a specific altitude, I am looking for a
&gt; number, not a position in a range.  I think the traditional altimeter

I agree with this statement. A needle is a graphical display of a
numerical value. A picture is worth a lot more than just the number.
By presenting just the numeric value you are taking away a lot of
useful information about neighboring values. Its like a GPS that shows
the lat-lon values instead of a moving map. The only exception I can
think of is the altimeter and VSI reading, where a numeric display may
be best.

I once saw a car that had a numeric RPM display. During accelerations
all digits were moving so fast you could not make anything from it.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Hello,

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I am computer scientist and usually really like fancy technology. But
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I just had my first flight with a &quot;glass&quot; PFD (Avidyne) and must say
&gt;&gt; I
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; am not impressed. In particular reading altitude and airpeed from
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; these scrolling bands requires a lot more attention than with regular
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; gauges, just like reading a digital clock takes longer than reading
&gt;&gt; an
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; analog one. Glancing at it and checking against a known picture, like
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;speed at 3 o'clock is fine on final&quot; or &quot;altitude at 20 minutes past
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; midnight is minimum&quot;, just does not work anymore, instead I end up
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; reading the actual numbers every time I look. Does anyone feel the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; same? Am I missing a particular technique?

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Arno

&gt;&gt; &gt; I am a fellow computer geek, and a student pilot.  I usually fly a
&gt;&gt; &gt; plane with steam gauges, but a couple of times now I have flown with
&gt;&gt; &gt; digital displays.  Like you, I found it a little hard to adjust to the
&gt;&gt; &gt; digital displays.  The digital displays I was using presented altitude
&gt;&gt; &gt; and tachometer values simply as numbers.  The analog displays I am
&gt;&gt; &gt; used to present these values as positions on a dial, showing the
&gt;&gt; &gt; current value in its context of a spectrum of values.  With the analog
&gt;&gt; &gt; displays, I am used to adjusting the position of the pointer.  With
&gt;&gt; &gt; the digital display, I need to simply set the correct numerical
&gt;&gt; &gt; value.  It's a little mental adjustment, and given that I am a newbie
&gt;&gt; &gt; to all this it is an extra distraction.

&gt;&gt; &gt; But, I do think that it is mostly a matter of what you are used to.

&gt;&gt; Flying is a right hand brain activity. At least the handling portion is.
&gt;&gt; The right hand side of the brain dosn't do abstractions like numbers, at
&gt;&gt; least not until the left hand side (which can't fly worth a shit) sends
&gt;&gt; it over to the right side in a readily digestable form which enables the
&gt;&gt; right brain to chew it into a picture.

&gt;&gt; An analogue display cuts the left hand side out of the loop and enables
&gt;&gt; the calcualtion rate to increase the right sides &quot;frame rate&quot; so that
&gt;&gt; corrections can be made more frequently thus enabling the pilot to fly
&gt;&gt; the airplane more smooothly and with more authority.
&gt;&gt; Caorse rule of thumb math can be laid over this for descent angles,
&gt;&gt; interceptin angles and wo on, but generally, the fewer numbers involved,
&gt;&gt; the better.
&gt;&gt; People who prefer the numbers usualy don't fly very well at all.

&gt;&gt; You don't do trig while you're shooting pool and expect to win the game.

&gt; As I understand it, the whole right-brain left-brain thing has pretty
&gt; much been discredited.  The more recent research shows that any
&gt; complex task engages both sides of the brain.  I don't think there
&gt; were too many neuroscientists who ever embraced the idea that one side
&gt; does &quot;art&quot; and the other side does &quot;math&quot; anyway.

Well, it's a simplification, but I have had cause to chat with some
neurosurgeons in the recent past over a protracted period and they still
seem to think it's pretty much still the way it works.

anyone who has ever known a stroke victim know that if the left side gets
zapped they can lose the power of speech altogether, for instance.

Yes, I agree and is pretty much what I was trying to say. Your brain picks
this up in the same language it's doing the flying job in. You don't have
to convert a bunch of numbers to a mental picture of what's going on, The
rate the needles move, their angle, the way they quiver and dance as they
pick up what's going on, all give subtle information in a form that's easy
to digest

Well, not in the things I fly! They pretty much give you what has been
decided for you.

One thing I positivley loath on some modern EFIS displays is the &quot;track
up&quot; option on the nav screen. For those not fmailiar, basicallly the DG
function puts our actual ground track on the lubber line and has a bug to
indicate your heading. This is the reverse of the traditional display where
the heading is on the lubber line and if you have some sort of RNAV
comouter giving info your track is displayed by a bug. It's OK when you are
motoring along enroute, but if you arent used to it, shooting an approach
is a nightmare. Adherents of track up say that it is actually easier, but
it isn't if you are used to the old way. doing an NDB appraoch, for
instance, all you need to do is put the track on the lubber line and the
ADF needle should stay glued to the inbound track, but if you have to
constantly remind yourself to do the oppostie of what you are used to it
can be an absolute nightmare to do by hand. If we did NDB appraoches every
day of the week it wouldn't be a problem, but I've done one in anger in the
last five years and the rest are all in the sim.
Even weirder, the newer airbusses use a speed reference system that uses
groundspeed on the approach. so, you set your Vref and the airplane
automatically raises it to accomodate a headwind by flying a constant
ground speed. (or advising you to fly faster by pushing the speed bug up)
It's simple, but interferes with the pilot's direct communications with the
wing. I suppose I'm trying to say it's translating for you and somethng is
always lost in the translation..

But don't mind me, I wish the 75 had flying wires so I could hear them sing

Phil,
The biggest difference between steam and digital is the amount of
information you can display is much greater with digital. Take the
speed tape for example, you get minimum and maximum values just like
steam, but you can also get flap speeds, manuvering speeds for each
flap setting, trend indications, trend vectoring, etc. You can display
much more information on a modern glass PFD and ND than you ever could
on an old school panel. This gives you SA at a glance where the old
school panel would have you reading and having to interprete several
different instruments. Some manufacturers are better than others, but
once you are used to these glass systems, you will find the hardest
thing is to fly an old school panel again.

Sorry, I wasn't very clear there.  What I meant was the designer of

either way.  The display can show simply a number, or it can show a
graphical representation of a range of values with a pointer to show

whatever the designer chose for you, but as EFIS becomes more common
and more sophisticated, it is very possible that it will be re-
configurable by the pilot.  I doubt that it will ever be completely
flexible where you can get it to display any way you want, but I can
imagine that there might be a selection of four or five different ways
to display an instrument, and you can pick which one you like.

That makes me wonder how the designers of EFIS displays choose their

personal preferences of the designer?  Hopefully there is some kind of
objective research used to choose a display pattern that is easiest to
use.  Of course, that raises the whole issue of testing displays.  Who
do you get to test them?  If you use pilots who have been flying
analog gauges for years, you are probably going to find that they want
EFIS displays that are like the analog instruments.  But those
displays may not actually be the optimal way for the brain to digest
the information.  It makes me think about the keyboard I am using to
type this.  It was designed back in the days of manual typewriters.
Because manual typewriters tended to jam if you tried to type too
fast, the keyboard was arranged to slow the typist down.  So we are
all using a keyboard that forces us to type more slowly than we could
with an optimal keyboard.  The Dvorak keyboard was designed to
eliminate this problem.  But hardly anyone uses it because we have all
been taught to type on the old QWERTY keyboard.

My guess is that the expensive commercial stuff in airliners is the product of
fairly extensive studies into ergonomy, whereas the inexpensive stuff sold for
small aircraft has not been subjected to that kind of study, since it's not
required for certification and it's very expensive.  That's why the
inexpensive stuff looks so much more like a video game and so much less like a

The most recent studies I've seen on the Dvorak indicate that it actually
isn't any faster than a QWERTY keyboard.  It turns out that the brain adapts
very well to whatever layout is used, and quickly gets up to speed.

Especially if it doesn't allow you to un-do anything.

This is a serious problem even in ordinary office automation software, but
it's much worse in safety-of-life software.

I recall a study done by Microsoft that showed that a great many people who
ask for new features for the Office product are actually asking for things
that are already there ... they just don't have any way of finding them in the
bloated mess that Office has become.

For this reason, I don't use Office--I spend more time trying to prevent it

It's extremely difficult and expensive to design such interfaces.  And often
the goal is simply to add features to encourage sales and upgrades, and nobody
really cares about the ergonomy.

As I've said, I see signs of this in the low-end glass cockpits.
Unfortunately it diminishes safety.

&gt; type this.  It was designed back in the days of manual typewriters.
&gt; Because manual typewriters tended to jam if you tried to type too
&gt; fast, the keyboard was arranged to slow the typist down.  So we are
&gt; all using a keyboard that forces us to type more slowly than we could
&gt; with an optimal keyboard.  The Dvorak keyboard was designed to
&gt; eliminate this problem.  But hardly anyone uses it because we have all
&gt; been taught to type on the old QWERTY keyboard.

&gt;&gt; Even weirder, the newer airbusses use a speed reference system that
&gt;&gt; uses groundspeed on the approach. so, you set your Vref and the
&gt;&gt; airplane automatically raises it to accomodate a headwind by flying a
&gt;&gt; constant ground speed. (or advising you to fly faster by pushing the
&gt;&gt; speed bug up) It's simple, but interferes with the pilot's direct
&gt;&gt; communications with the wing. I suppose I'm trying to say it's
&gt;&gt; translating for you and somethng is always lost in the translation..

&gt; I understand what you are saying.  In the software world, designers
&gt; try to make each new release more &quot;helpful&quot; than the last.  Sometimes
&gt; this is good, but mostly I just find it annoying.  The software tries
&gt; to guess what you intend to do, and do it for you.  If it guesses
&gt; right, that's fine.  But it seems like it mostly guesses wrong, and
&gt; then you just have to un-do what it did.  That's not an improvement.
&gt; I wish they would put more time into designing simple, intuitive user
&gt; interfaces so I can more easily tell the program what I want it to
&gt; do.  That way the program doesn't have to guess.

&gt;&gt; But don't mind me, I wish the 75 had flying wires so I could hear
&gt;&gt; them sing to me..

&gt; Maybe some EFIS designer can set up the option to have the airspeed
&gt; converted to a flying wire sound and played in your headset.  :-)

It's been done!

Well, almost. Some MD80 types have an engine noise generator to aid the
crew in hand flying approaches.

&gt;&gt; That makes me wonder how the designers of EFIS displays choose their
&gt;&gt; designs.  Are the designs based on research or are they just the
&gt;&gt; personal preferences of the designer?

&gt; My guess is that the expensive commercial stuff in airliners is the
&gt; product of fairly extensive studies into ergonomy, whereas the
&gt; inexpensive stuff sold for small aircraft has not been subjected to
&gt; that kind of study, since it's not required for certification and it's
&gt; very expensive.  That's why the inexpensive stuff looks so much more
&gt; like a video game and so much less like a cockpit.

&gt;&gt; So we are all using a keyboard that forces us to type more slowly
&gt;&gt; than we could with an optimal keyboard.  The Dvorak keyboard was
&gt;&gt; designed to eliminate this problem.  But hardly anyone uses it
&gt;&gt; because we have all been taught to type on the old QWERTY keyboard.

&gt; The most recent studies I've seen on the Dvorak indicate that it
&gt; actually isn't any faster than a QWERTY keyboard.  It turns out that
&gt; the brain adapts very well to whatever layout is used, and quickly
&gt; gets up to speed.

&gt; More evidence of this can be seen in the way some people type on their
&gt; Blackberries or cell phones.

&gt;&gt; I understand what you are saying.  In the software world, designers
&gt;&gt; try to make each new release more &quot;helpful&quot; than the last.  Sometimes
&gt;&gt; this is good, but mostly I just find it annoying.

&gt; The problem is that it can be deadly in aviation, and not just
&gt; annoying. Airbus is a classic example of the software-developer
&gt; syndrome.

&gt;&gt; The software tries
&gt;&gt; to guess what you intend to do, and do it for you.  If it guesses
&gt;&gt; right, that's fine.  But it seems like it mostly guesses wrong, and
&gt;&gt; then you just have to un-do what it did.  That's not an improvement.

&gt; Especially if it doesn't allow you to un-do anything.

&gt; This is a serious problem even in ordinary office automation software,
&gt; but it's much worse in safety-of-life software.

&gt; I recall a study done by Microsoft that showed that a great many
&gt; people who ask for new features for the Office product are actually
&gt; asking for things that are already there ... they just don't have any
&gt; way of finding them in the bloated mess that Office has become.

&gt; For this reason, I don't use Office--I spend more time trying to
&gt; prevent it from doing things I don't want it to do than I spend
&gt; accomplishing anything productive.

&gt;&gt; I wish they would put more time into designing simple, intuitive user
&gt;&gt; interfaces so I can more easily tell the program what I want it to
&gt;&gt; do.  That way the program doesn't have to guess.

&gt; It's extremely difficult and expensive to design such interfaces.  And
&gt; often the goal is simply to add features to encourage sales and
&gt; upgrades, and nobody really cares about the ergonomy.

&gt; As I've said, I see signs of this in the low-end glass cockpits.
&gt; Unfortunately it diminishes safety.

You have no idea what it does.
