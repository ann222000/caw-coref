And yet the Godnuts have seized upon this news with their usual

It would be much more surprising if habilis had suddenly become

It's telling that the Godnuts ramp up their dangerous foolishness
whenever human origins make the papers.  They just can't get over
their childish and anthropocentric view that we're somehow special and

I'm referring to the deniers' understanding of evolutionary theory - which
always seems to suffer a 50-year time lag, such that they're not even
arguing against the *current* misconceptions, but against the popular
misconceptions of 1957 or thereabouts.

I'm not (here) referring to the silly science vs religion war that hotted up
in the 19th century, and showed (and still shows) both the relevant
scientists and the relevant theologians in such a poor light.

Given that it's only intended to illustrate a principle, the only real
problem with it is that it doesn't show all the other branches of the simian

Right, I'm with you now.

The deniers aren't always that far back.  When the bacterial flagellum
evolution question came out a couple of years ago (by that time, the
IDers had finally got the idea that the human eye was no big deal), it
addressed a question that hadn't really been thought about by
scientists, because to them it was a moot problem.

When Michael Behe started rambling on about &quot;irreducible complexity&quot;
and pulling out the bacterial flagellum as a piece of evidence, the
rational community actually had to do some research to show that his
argument was bunk.  No-one had studied the comparative structure of
flagella before with the *evolution* of the structure in mind.  Of
course, as with the eye, it was pretty easy to demonstrate that
intermediate stages would be viable, even if not functioning as
flagella (eg as type III secretory systems).

This, to me, is the danger of Behe and his ilk - they get to choose
their battleground, and they want to choose the areas not yet
addressed by the scientific community.  And, of course, they have a
truly massive landscape to choose their battlefields from, and they
insist on a non-scientific, non-evidence-based approach.

Why is this dangerous?  Put a trained IDer and a scientist in front of
the TV cameras, and it will look to Joe Public as if the scientist is
the loser.  There are several reasons for this:

1. The IDer has picked a handful of cases, and researched them, and
it's his call which cases he picks.  He'll have what appears to a
layman as a cast-iron case.

2. The scientist has a limited field of specialisation, like any
scientist.  The IDer will completely avoid that area.  So, if a public
debate pits an IDer against a scientist working in the field of
neurology, the IDer will choose to argue about, say, bone generation
and Hox genes.  The reverse doesn't happen, because there is no case
to address in the reverse.

3. The ID representative  will be chosen as a proponent not just by
his understanding of a field (he doesn't really need to understand
much, just read the script) but more by his personality, debating
skills, looks and good-humoured charm.  Scientists become scientists
because they're intelligent and interested, not because they dress
snappily and look good on TV.  Public perception: &quot;why is that
scientist guy mumbling and wearing cheap jeans?  He must be wrong!&quot;

4. The IDer prepares his arguments in advance.  That's part of #2,
really, but it deserves mention.  In the debates I've watched, it's
pretty damned obvious to me that the IDer is unwilling to depart from
the script, and keeps returning to the &quot;yes, but what use is half a
flagellum?&quot; argument, not because it's so compelling, but because it's
the thing he vaguely knows about.

5.  The audience are largely fucking stupid, and don't understand the
basics of the scientific method, let alone why it's so valuable.  In
fact, I'd guess that 95% of the population couldn't even begin to
describe the basis of the method, and think the a hypothesis is a
magical creature in a Harry Potter book, evidence is a blood-stained
diaper, empirical is about the Raj, and peer review is when the House
of Lords gets in The Sun.

Here endeth today's rant.  Thank God for Richard Dawkins (isn't that
ironic?).

Evolutionary trees are fine if your intended audience can understand a
diagram that works in two dimensions without explicit labelling on
both axes.  Many people can't, and the concept is lost on them.  &quot;Why
are the reptiles on the left of the mammals, not the right?&quot; is a
common problem.

It's not helped by this sort of thing: http://tinyurl.com/y8yl6j (JPEG
from the University of Michigan), which places man at the very top,
higher even than chickens, monkeys, horses and yeast.  WTF?

Or how about this one: http://tinyurl.com/262msq from the Norwegian
University of Science and Technology (NTNU)?  See how BIG and
IMPORTANT mankind is?

Bad, confusing diagrams, especially since both come from seats of
learning.

&gt; Given that it's only intended to illustrate a principle, the only
&gt; real problem with it is that it doesn't show all the other
&gt; branches of the simian evolutionary tree and therefore allows
&gt; people to assume that there weren't any.

Often the levels in the cartoon are labeled, e.g. &quot;Homo habilis&quot;. And
the drawings are meant to reflect what those creatures looked like.
That's not really accurate.

And it certainly did a good job of shaping public opinion, despite

Those old guys had a lot of rethinking to do to understand that we
descended from other apes, and are technically apes ourselves.

It's hard for us to understand today what that must have been like,
similar to the old geocentric/heliocentric controversy - it seems to
damned obvious now, but we don't have the baggage of our own education
clawing us back into what Teacher and Daddy said.
