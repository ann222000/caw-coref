Plugging in DV Via Firewire Results In Error

When I plug in my DV camcorder via firewire, I get the following
message:  "Windows cannot find 'C:\Program'..."  If I click "OK" and
try to capture video via a capture program, I am able to communicate
with the camera and initiate capture but no video is captured on the
computer.  I can see it playing on the camera display however.  It's
almost like my registry is corrupt.  Oviously, when you plug in via
firewire, some sort of software is initiated but I'm not sure what
exactly it is.  My firewire port is on a Creative Sound Blaster Audigy
2 card.  I trie re-installing the drivers and even deleting the 1394
driver from the device manager but no luck.  Any help is appreciated.

Thanks,
Greg

Greg, can you actually see the full file name that Windows is looking for or
is the display message truncated as in your text below

What operation system (and sp) are yu running?

What editing software are you using? Have you tried Movie maker (if using XP
or Vista)

If you knew the name of the application that the system is trying to
launch when you plug in your camcorder, you could search the registry
for the exact name of the executable file and add quotation marks
around the full path to the file. This usually fixes problems like
this. It's usually caused by the use of a long file name, specifically
the blank in the path name.

Foe example, if the filename of the executable was CaptureDV.exe, for
example, and it was located in the CaptureIt subdirectory of the
Program Files directory, you would search the registry for
CaptureDV.exe and ensure that the path was coded with quotes as

"C:\Program Files\CaptureIt\CaptureDV.exe"

rather than without quotes as

C:\Program Files\CaptureIt\CaptureDV.exe

This simple change usually resolves problems of this type.

Plugging into a firewire port should not typically set some program to
run. What this suggests is that some bit of software you installed at
some point 'helpfully' decided it new best and did whatever behind the
scenes magic was necessary to glom onto your firewire port.

Who this fun little bit of code belongs to can be ferreted out through
the methods listed by other replies.

I am using XP Home.  It sounds to me like this I may be having two
separate problems.  One is that a program that I've probably de-
installed is trying to run when I plug in by DV camera.  The other is
the bigger problem which is why is no video being captured.   It
doesn't really matter what package I use...Nero, Movie Maker, etc.
The camera can be controlled but no video is captured.

The first problem (missing program) could very well be
causing the second one (no video).  Can you re-install
the missing program to eliminate that unknown? What
was it?

I suggest you try downloading filemon from
http://www.microsoft.com/technet/sysinternals/FileAndDisk/Filemon.mspx which
will allow you to see which files the system is trying to access when you
plug the DV in. I think I agree with Richard's later post which is that
these two problems are probably connected.

There is a corresponding utility called regmon which (as it's name implies)
allows you to monitor the registry. I use these in my "Day Job" and they
have helped me on many occasions.

Hey, thanks for the advice regarding regmon.  When I use it and turn
on the DV recorder and get my error I notice that a process called
ctfmon.exe is accessing the registry.  I'm still researching it but
this is apparently either a program installed by Microsoft for
alternative text input or a trojan horse.  I'm still trying to
determine if I can just kill and de-install this.  However, at least
I'm on the right track.

So I have disabled ctfmon and now there are no registry accesses when
I turn on the DV recorder.  I am now using filemon to see what is
going on but I'm not having much luck.
