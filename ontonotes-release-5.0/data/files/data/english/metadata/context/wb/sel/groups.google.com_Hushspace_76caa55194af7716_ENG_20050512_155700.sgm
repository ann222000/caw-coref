Calling someone a bugger wouldn't be considered a offensive phrase at
all here, despite its actual meaning. Children are often told they're
'little buggers' Speaking from my own experience anyway.

noun [U] FORMAL OR LEGAL
the sexual act of putting the penis into a man's or woman's anus

It's a bit different on the pond's west side. While we don't use those
phrases much(or at all), bugger is a specific anal act, while the recently
struck down (by the Supreme Court) &quot;sodomy laws&quot; could include a range of
acts including but not limited to anal, oral, animals, etc. It depended on
the individual state's laws. Just a bit of trivia.

Laws are used and bastardised to cover many things. tha Cambridge
dictionary
definition of sodomy is :

Definitionsodomy
noun [U] FORMAL OR LEGAL
the sexual act of putting the penis into a man's or woman's anus

I defy you to tell me how the phrase &quot;little shit&quot; is in any way sexist or
racist. It's a good description which covers a multitude of social
deficiencies and sums up any and all attitudinal problems perfectly.

Laws are used and bastardised to cover many things. tha Cambridge
dictionary
definition of sodomy is :

Definitionsodomy
noun [U] FORMAL OR LEGAL
the sexual act of putting the penis into a man's or woman's anus

Laws are used and bastardised to cover many things. tha Cambridge

definition of sodomy is :

Definitionsodomy
noun [U] FORMAL OR LEGAL
the sexual act of putting the penis into a man's or woman's anus

Hate to say it mate, but I have seen the racist card been waved by Asian
friends whilst at school after being referred to as little shits. When asked
they said they believed it was in reference to the colour of their skin.

But in principle I do agree.

I defy you to tell me how the phrase &quot;little shit&quot; is in any way sexist or
racist. It's a good description which covers a multitude of social
deficiencies and sums up any and all attitudinal problems perfectly.

It's a bit different on the pond's west side. While we don't use those
phrases much(or at all), bugger is a specific anal act, while the recently
struck down (by the Supreme Court) &quot;sodomy laws&quot; could include a range of
acts including but not limited to anal, oral, animals, etc. It depended on
the individual state's laws. Just a bit of trivia.

We would refer to that as a sort of dirty sod. Therefore, once the grass has
germinated, should it be called a dirty old sod?

No, the grass comes germinated already. Once you lay it on the ground it looks just like regular grass. Once the roots grow deep enough to catch we call it &quot;lawn&quot; or &quot;grass&quot;.

We would refer to that as a sort of dirty sod. Therefore, once the grass has
germinated, should it be called a dirty old sod?

Yeah, in Ohio sod is grass pre-packaged in dirt. It's like a carpet you lay
in your front yard. Lovely idea sod is.

I defy you to tell me how the phrase &quot;little shit&quot; is in any way sexist or
racist. It's a good description which covers a multitude of social
deficiencies and sums up any and all attitudinal problems perfectly.

It's a bit different on the pond's west side. While we don't use those
phrases much(or at all), bugger is a specific anal act, while the recently
struck down (by the Supreme Court) &quot;sodomy laws&quot; could include a range of
acts including but not limited to anal, oral, animals, etc. It depended on
the individual state's laws. Just a bit of trivia.

We call that turf. A sod can be a small clump of earth it is true, but in
the derogatory sense it is used when people call each other that it really does
derive from the word sodomite.

No, the grass comes germinated already. Once you lay it on the ground it
looks just like regular grass. Once the roots grow deep enough to catch we
call it &quot;lawn&quot; or &quot;grass&quot;.

We would refer to that as a sort of dirty sod. Therefore, once the grass
has
germinated, should it be called a dirty old sod?

I don't like to argue. I'm guessing you saw that coming right?

I do wanna point out though that I don't (always) just argue for the sake of
it, it just seems that way.

It's a bit different on the pond's west side. While we don't use those
phrases much(or at all), bugger is a specific anal act, while the
recently
struck down (by the Supreme Court) &quot;sodomy laws&quot; could include a range of
acts including but not limited to anal, oral, animals, etc. It depended
on
the individual state's laws. Just a bit of trivia.

We call that turf. A sod can be a small clump of earth it is true, but in the derogatory sense it is used when people call each other that it really does derive from the word sodomite.

No, the grass comes germinated already. Once you lay it on the ground it
looks just like regular grass. Once the roots grow deep enough to catch we
call it &quot;lawn&quot; or &quot;grass&quot;.

We would refer to that as a sort of dirty sod. Therefore, once the grass
has
germinated, should it be called a dirty old sod?

We call that astroturf. Turf is cultivated grass cut into strips for laying
as lawns and sporting pitches. The plural is turves

We call that turf. A sod can be a small clump of earth it is true, but in
the derogatory sense it is used when people call each other that it really does
derive from the word sodomite.

And I would never even joke that you would do otherwise. Unfortunately, what
you mean and what is construed by it are not always the same.

I have this nasty habit of saying things I don't mean to say. I was once
talking to an important client, who i had only met for the 1st time 3 hours
earlier, and he was telling me what he wanted to gain from some work I was
to perform, I made a point with which he strongly agreed, and I said &quot;I can
see i'm preaching to the perverted&quot;. Fortunately, he just looked at me and
said &quot;I'm guessing that's not what you meant to say right?&quot;.

That was at the point where I enjoyed my job and would have been worried
HadHad I lost it, now I'd hope he would assume I meant to say it! ;)

BTW - In case you're wondering, i'm not too sure why i told that story
either.

I defy you to tell me how the phrase &quot;little shit&quot; is in any way sexist or
racist. It's a good description which covers a multitude of social
deficiencies and sums up any and all attitudinal problems perfectly.

We call that turf. A sod can be a small clump of earth it is true, but in the derogatory sense it is used when people call each other that it really does derive from the word sodomite.

No, the grass comes germinated already. Once you lay it on the ground it
looks just like regular grass. Once the roots grow deep enough to catch we
call it &quot;lawn&quot; or &quot;grass&quot;.

We would refer to that as a sort of dirty sod. Therefore, once the grass

germinated, should it be called a dirty old sod?

No, the grass comes germinated already. Once you lay it on the ground it
looks just like regular grass. Once the roots grow deep enough to catch
we
call it &quot;lawn&quot; or &quot;grass&quot;.

We would refer to that as a sort of dirty sod. Therefore, once the
grass
has
germinated, should it be called a dirty old sod?

Sometimes that's the case. I'm much more like that in real life, but I play
it in somewhat more of a devils advocate sense.

It also depends on who else is involved.

It's a bit different on the pond's west side. While we don't use those
phrases much(or at all), bugger is a specific anal act, while the
recently
struck down (by the Supreme Court) &quot;sodomy laws&quot; could include a range
of
acts including but not limited to anal, oral, animals, etc. It depended
on
the individual state's laws. Just a bit of trivia.

Then what we need is some other people to host reference about HadHad on
their webspace and then spike a couple search engines. Wiki gets our
definition and the top 3 hits on yahoo all agree with it...and HadHad
becomes history.

We call that turf. A sod can be a small clump of earth it is true, but in the derogatory sense it is used when people call each other that it really does derive from the word sodomite.

It's a bit different on the pond's west side. While we don't use those
phrases much(or at all), bugger is a specific anal act, while the
recently
struck down (by the Supreme Court) &quot;sodomy laws&quot; could include a range
of
acts including but not limited to anal, oral, animals, etc. It depended
on
the individual state's laws. Just a bit of trivia.

No, the grass comes germinated already. Once you lay it on the ground it
looks just like regular grass. Once the roots grow deep enough to catch we
call it &quot;lawn&quot; or &quot;grass&quot;.

We would refer to that as a sort of dirty sod. Therefore, once the grass
has
germinated, should it be called a dirty old sod?

Yeah, in Ohio sod is grass pre-packaged in dirt. It's like a carpet you
lay
in your front yard. Lovely idea sod is.

Ah, but that's the point. Its not &quot;your language&quot;. It's American, a
dialect of the English (circa late 18th century when we became
independent) language. Generalizing about phase meanings for all
English dialects would be the wrong thing to do, hence my comments. So
bugger off. ;P

&gt; It's a bit different on the pond's west side. While we don't use those
&gt; phrases much(or at all), bugger is a specific anal act, while the recently
&gt; struck down (by the Supreme Court) &quot;sodomy laws&quot; could include a range of
&gt; acts including but not limited to anal, oral, animals, etc. It depended on
&gt; the individual state's laws. Just a bit of trivia.

A dialect is not the same as a language. A dialect is a branch variation of
a language, and since we started it we have first dibs on it. You lot just
fucked it up. You have the missing &quot;u&quot; in colour&quot;, the missing &quot;WMD&quot; in Iraq -
I could go on but I'm bored now.

Oh Martin Martin Martin, things just wouldn't be the same here without you.
You are just the right weight &amp; height for a good-sized punching bag! :)

ps. HAHA about your little anecdote!

&gt; I have this nasty habit of saying things I don't mean to say. I was once
&gt; talking to an important client, who i had only met for the 1st time 3
&gt; hours
&gt; earlier, and he was telling me what he wanted to gain from some work I was
&gt; to perform, I made a point with which he strongly agreed, and I said &quot;I
&gt; can
&gt; see i'm preaching to the perverted&quot;. Fortunately, he just looked at me and
&gt; said &quot;I'm guessing that's not what you meant to say right?&quot;.

&gt; That was at the point where I enjoyed my job and would have been worried
&gt; HadHad I lost it, now I'd hope he would assume I meant to say it! ;)

&gt; BTW - In case you're wondering, i'm not too sure why i told that story

&gt; I defy you to tell me how the phrase &quot;little shit&quot; is in any way sexist or
&gt; racist. It's a good description which covers a multitude of social

It's a bit different on the pond's west side. While we don't use
those
phrases much(or at all), bugger is a specific anal act, while the
recently

&gt; No, the grass comes germinated already. Once you lay it on the ground it
&gt; looks just like regular grass. Once the roots grow deep enough to catch
we
&gt; call it &quot;lawn&quot; or &quot;grass&quot;.

&gt; We would refer to that as a sort of dirty sod. Therefore, once the
grass

Ah, but that's the point. Its not &quot;your language&quot;. It's American, a
dialect of the English (circa late 18th century when we became
independent) language. Generalizing about phase meanings for all
English dialects would be the wrong thing to do, hence my comments. So
bugger off. ;P

&gt;
&gt; It's a bit different on the pond's west side. While we don't use those
&gt; phrases much(or at all), bugger is a specific anal act, while the
recently
&gt; struck down (by the Supreme Court) &quot;sodomy laws&quot; could include a range
of
&gt; acts including but not limited to anal, oral, animals, etc. It depended
on
&gt; the individual state's laws. Just a bit of trivia.

&gt;&gt; No, the grass comes germinated already. Once you lay it on the ground it
&gt;&gt; looks just like regular grass. Once the roots grow deep enough to catch
&gt; we
&gt;&gt; call it &quot;lawn&quot; or &quot;grass&quot;.

&gt;&gt; We would refer to that as a sort of dirty sod. Therefore, once the
&gt; grass
&gt;&gt; has
&gt;&gt; germinated, should it be called a dirty old sod?

&gt;&gt; Yeah, in Ohio sod is grass pre-packaged in dirt. It's like a carpet

A dialect is not the same as a language. A dialect is a branch variation of
a language, and since we started it we have first dibs on it. You lot just
fucked it up. You have the missing &quot;u&quot; in colour&quot;, the missing &quot;WMD&quot; in
Iraq -

Thanks for that Trekkie! I've not seen you say much here since I pissed you
off all that time ago. Sorry if you don't feel special anymore seeing as I
piss everyone off.

I am actually a bit too big for a punching bag, but y'all are welcome to
come and have a go if you think you're hard enough!

Oh Martin Martin Martin, things just wouldn't be the same here without you.
You are just the right weight &amp; height for a good-sized punching bag! :)

ps. HAHA about your little anecdote!

&gt; And I would never even joke that you would do otherwise. Unfortunately,
&gt; what
&gt; you mean and what is construed by it are not always the same.
&gt;
&gt; I have this nasty habit of saying things I don't mean to say. I was once
&gt; talking to an important client, who i had only met for the 1st time 3
&gt; hours
&gt; earlier, and he was telling me what he wanted to gain from some work I
was
&gt; to perform, I made a point with which he strongly agreed, and I said &quot;I
&gt; can
&gt; see i'm preaching to the perverted&quot;. Fortunately, he just looked at me
and
&gt; said &quot;I'm guessing that's not what you meant to say right?&quot;.
&gt;
&gt; That was at the point where I enjoyed my job and would have been worried
&gt; HadHad I lost it, now I'd hope he would assume I meant to say it! ;)
&gt;
&gt; BTW - In case you're wondering, i'm not too sure why i told that story
&gt; either.

&gt; I defy you to tell me how the phrase &quot;little shit&quot; is in any way sexist
or
&gt; racist. It's a good description which covers a multitude of social
&gt; deficiencies and sums up any and all attitudinal problems perfectly.

&gt; Ah, but that's the point. Its not &quot;your language&quot;. It's American, a
&gt; dialect of the English (circa late 18th century when we became
&gt; independent) language. Generalizing about phase meanings for all
&gt; English dialects would be the wrong thing to do, hence my comments. So
&gt; bugger off. ;P

&gt;&gt; Did you know that if you piss on grass, the ammonia in it causes
stinging
&gt;&gt; nettles to grow?

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; No, the grass comes germinated already. Once you lay it on the ground
it
&gt;&gt; looks just like regular grass. Once the roots grow deep enough to
catch
&gt; we
&gt;&gt; call it &quot;lawn&quot; or &quot;grass&quot;.

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; We would refer to that as a sort of dirty sod. Therefore, once the
&gt; grass
&gt;&gt; has
&gt;&gt; germinated, should it be called a dirty old sod?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I need a drink.

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Yeah, in Ohio sod is grass pre-packaged in dirt. It's like a carpet
&gt; you
&gt;&gt; lay
&gt;&gt; in your front yard. Lovely idea sod is.

&gt; Ah, but that's the point. Its not &quot;your language&quot;. It's American, a
&gt; dialect of the English (circa late 18th century when we became
&gt; independent) language. Generalizing about phase meanings for all
&gt; English dialects would be the wrong thing to do, hence my comments. So
&gt; bugger off. ;P

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; It's a bit different on the pond's west side. While we don't use
those
&gt;&gt; phrases much(or at all), bugger is a specific anal act, while the
&gt; recently
&gt;&gt; struck down (by the Supreme Court) &quot;sodomy laws&quot; could include a
range
&gt; of
&gt;&gt; acts including but not limited to anal, oral, animals, etc. It
depended
&gt; on
&gt;&gt; the individual state's laws. Just a bit of trivia.

we need HadHad.org or something. That's one of the most reliable ways
to get a high search placing.

Yeti (Big Furry From Behind A Tree Peeker):
It's a bit different on the pond's west side. While we don't use those
phrases much(or at all), bugger is a specific anal act, while the recently
struck down (by the Supreme Court) &quot;sodomy laws&quot; could include a range of
acts including but not limited to anal, oral, animals, etc. It depended on
the individual state's laws. Just a bit of trivia.

&gt;&gt; hours
&gt;&gt; earlier, and he was telling me what he wanted to gain from some work I
&gt; was
&gt;&gt; to perform, I made a point with which he strongly agreed, and I said &quot;I
&gt;&gt; can
&gt;&gt; see i'm preaching to the perverted&quot;. Fortunately, he just looked at me
&gt; and
&gt;&gt; said &quot;I'm guessing that's not what you meant to say right?&quot;.

&gt;&gt; That was at the point where I enjoyed my job and would have been worried
&gt;&gt; HadHad I lost it, now I'd hope he would assume I meant to say it! ;)

&gt;&gt; BTW - In case you're wondering, i'm not too sure why i told that story

&gt;&gt; I defy you to tell me how the phrase &quot;little shit&quot; is in any way sexist

&gt;&gt; I have this nasty habit of saying things I don't mean to say. I was
once
&gt;&gt; talking to an important client, who i had only met for the 1st time 3
&gt;&gt; hours
&gt;&gt; earlier, and he was telling me what he wanted to gain from some work I
&gt; was
&gt;&gt; to perform, I made a point with which he strongly agreed, and I said &quot;I
&gt;&gt; can
&gt;&gt; see i'm preaching to the perverted&quot;. Fortunately, he just looked at me
&gt; and
&gt;&gt; said &quot;I'm guessing that's not what you meant to say right?&quot;.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; That was at the point where I enjoyed my job and would have been
worried
&gt;&gt; HadHad I lost it, now I'd hope he would assume I meant to say it! ;)

&gt;&gt; I defy you to tell me how the phrase &quot;little shit&quot; is in any way sexist

We call that turf. A sod can be a small clump of earth it is true, but in the derogatory sense it is used when people call each other that it really does derive from the word sodomite.

It's astroturf everywhere, but thats the 1st I've heard turves. I would

It's a bit different on the pond's west side. While we don't use those
phrases much(or at all), bugger is a specific anal act, while the
recently
struck down (by the Supreme Court) &quot;sodomy laws&quot; could include a range
of
acts including but not limited to anal, oral, animals, etc. It depended
on
the individual state's laws. Just a bit of trivia.

It's a bit different on the pond's west side. While we don't use those
phrases much(or at all), bugger is a specific anal act, while the
recently
struck down (by the Supreme Court) &quot;sodomy laws&quot; could include a range
of
acts including but not limited to anal, oral, animals, etc. It depended

Yeah, Well I'm not getting into this &amp; this is the end of it on this
thread from me. But your so forgeting who your talking to here. Someone
whos been involved for years &amp; years. &amp; then on top of that, someone
whos done the research to the hilt for years &amp; years more after
strengthening myself enough to remove my subconciousness far the F
away from it all.
Like some things abound in the universe, rediculously, very hard to
prove &amp; disprove. But yet it *is* very much there my friend, sorry
&amp; so sad to say, but it is VERY much there. But the good thing is,
after talking to U for a good while now, I have a strong feeling
within the force that U've been raised right. And have a very strong
mind that is strong enough to shield yourself from the intellectual
garbage end of it.

Martin:
The problem is mate, that too many people actually believe that kinda shit.

And no, for the record, i don't have 666 on my forehead.

We call that astroturf. Turf is cultivated grass cut into strips for laying as lawns and sporting pitches. The plural is turves

We call that turf. A sod can be a small clump of earth it is true, but in the derogatory sense it is used when people call each other that it really does derive from the word sodomite.

haha, me a bully? Haven't been called one of them before. Have you
really seen a pattern of me trying to exert some kind of influence over
people in this group? I don't remember doing it. My point was that
people can have their own opinion, even if their wrong like Yeti or talk
crap like Martin :-) Freedom of Speech is one of my strong beliefs.

Now, just agree with me or else! lol

LOL - I like everyone here including Martin. Words R words. &amp; even
beyond words, I'm big enough, smart enough...And dog gone it...
people like me(SNL). I've left people in the dust b4, bigger ones.
I never start it or throw 1st, but I sure as hell finish it for them.
Definitly not tooting my own horn(not into it &amp; don't like it elswhere)

Andrew W:
So does that mean you don't like me either? Pah! You better watch your
back 'cuz you're going to pay big time now.

&gt; haha, me a bully? Haven't been called one of them before. Have you
&gt; really seen a pattern of me trying to exert some kind of influence over
&gt; people in this group? I don't remember doing it. My point was that
&gt; people can have their own opinion, even if their wrong like Yeti or talk
&gt; crap like Martin :-) Freedom of Speech is one of my strong beliefs.
&gt;
&gt; Now, just agree with me or else! lol

&gt;&gt;&gt; Ah, but that's the point. Its not &quot;your language&quot;. It's American, a
&gt;&gt;&gt; dialect of the English (circa late 18th century when we became
&gt;&gt;&gt; independent) language. Generalizing about phase meanings for all
&gt;&gt;&gt; English dialects would be the wrong thing to do, hence my comments. So
&gt;&gt;&gt; bugger off. ;P

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It's a bit different on the pond's west side. While we don't use
&gt;&gt; those
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; phrases much(or at all), bugger is a specific anal act, while the

&gt;&gt; range
&gt;&gt;&gt; of

Ok people, when I said shut him up, i meant for Jeri to comeback with some
factual stuff which he did, i just worded it badly.

And I kinda like you too Larr, but please don't refer to me as a bully, i
got that label when i was at school because i was bigger than everyone (i
was taller than the teachers when I was 9), yet all i was ever doing was
standing up (no that's not an intentional pun!) for myself.

I can probably guess the next reply to this one; &quot;Not trying to be...

&gt; Ah, but that's the point. Its not &quot;your language&quot;. It's American, a
&gt; dialect of the English (circa late 18th century when we became
&gt; independent) language. Generalizing about phase meanings for all
&gt; English dialects would be the wrong thing to do, hence my comments. So
&gt; bugger off. ;P

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; It's a bit different on the pond's west side. While we don't use
those
&gt;&gt; phrases much(or at all), bugger is a specific anal act, while the
&gt; recently
&gt;&gt; struck down (by the Supreme Court) &quot;sodomy laws&quot; could include a
range
&gt; of
&gt;&gt; acts including but not limited to anal, oral, animals, etc. It
depended
&gt; on
&gt;&gt; the individual state's laws. Just a bit of trivia.

It's a bit different on the pond's west side. While we don't use
those
phrases much(or at all), bugger is a specific anal act, while the
recently
struck down (by the Supreme Court) &quot;sodomy laws&quot; could include a
range
of
acts including but not limited to anal, oral, animals, etc. It
depended
on
the individual state's laws. Just a bit of trivia.

It may not seriously be your intention, but if U read back through
some of your replys U would def understand where I'm coming from.
It's OK Martin, there is a hell of a lot of us guilty of it
once in a while. Especially when life deals us hard blows at
certain times.
U only kind of like me? :(

BTW - We have a new one;
SIK = Sprite in Keyboard
I have a tall desk w/ shelves above my monitor that holds books
&amp; discs. My cat likes it up there &amp; theres a nice spot that he
lounges on thats cleared off for him. Something scared him into
jumping &amp; down came a couple of books knocking a big, full cup
sprite right onto my new keyboard! FUUUUUUUUUUCK!!! Hadhad to
drag out my old crappy one &amp; U should havehave seen my monitor
freek out for a bit while still connected. WTF??? Weird.

Martin:
Ok people, when I said shut him up, i meant for Jeri to comeback with some
factual stuff which he did, i just worded it badly.

And I kinda like you too Larr, but please don't refer to me as a bully, i
got that label when i was at school because i was bigger than everyone (i
was taller than the teachers when I was 9), yet all i was ever doing was
standing up (no that's not an intentional pun!) for myself.

&gt; Ah, but that's the point. Its not &quot;your language&quot;. It's American, a
&gt; dialect of the English (circa late 18th century when we became
&gt; independent) language. Generalizing about phase meanings for all
&gt; English dialects would be the wrong thing to do, hence my comments. So
&gt; bugger off. ;P

U only kind of like me? :(

And I kinda like you too Larr, but please don't refer to me as a bully, i
got that label when i was at school because i was bigger than everyone (i
was taller than the teachers when I was 9), yet all i was ever doing was
standing up (no that's not an intentional pun!) for myself.

&gt; Ah, but that's the point. Its not &quot;your language&quot;. It's American, a
&gt; dialect of the English (circa late 18th century when we became
&gt; independent) language. Generalizing about phase meanings for all

&gt;&gt; It's a bit different on the pond's west side. While we don't use
those
&gt;&gt; phrases much(or at all), bugger is a specific anal act, while the
&gt; recently
&gt;&gt; struck down (by the Supreme Court) &quot;sodomy laws&quot; could include a
range
&gt; of
&gt;&gt; acts including but not limited to anal, oral, animals, etc. It
depended
&gt; on
&gt;&gt; the individual state's laws. Just a bit of trivia.

I can understand what you're saying mate, but I'm not gonna agree with you,
because I know the intention I had when I said those things. My problem is
that I come across as very blunt, which is true to an extent, but people who
know me know that I am one of the nicest people around, who will do anything
for anyone and will look after someone I consider a friend if it's the last
thing I do.

Some people just don't know how to take me. A couple of my oldest friends
&quot;came out&quot; a few years back and I was the last person they told about it
because they didn't know what I'd say, but they knew whatever I said would
be the truth. Funnily enough, of all the people they told, i'm the only one
who still sees them.

And finally, I didn't want to tell everyone about our sordid love affair,
hence me saying i kinda like u. Damn, the secret's out. Too many people seem
to want me on these groups lately, unfortunately no women, and nobody who's
remotely near me :_(

I think you've been told this in another group m8 but what you think you are
saying isn't necessarily what other peolpe are reading. It might be clear in
your mind what you mean but if it isn't clear in your writing people can
misinterpret. It happens alot with your posts so I don't think it is a
coincidence. It has nothing to do with being blunt and everything to do with
phraseology.

It's not for everyone to constantly give you the benefit of the doubt m8.
It's for you to work out what you are doing that causes grief and sort it out.
Other members who have dropped into the same pit of errors as you have ended
up being banned from several groups. And before you chuck your toys out of
your pram that isn't a threat. No group wants to be the playground site of a
flamewar. Alot of us get into the banter and the tittle tattle but sometimes the
wrong thing said badly can start a real fight. Why would you want to take
the risk when it is easier to re-read what you are writing and think twice?

I think you've been told this in another group m8 but what you think you
are
saying isn't necessarily what other peolpe are reading. It might be clear in
your mind what you mean but if it isn't clear in your writing people can
misinterpret. It happens alot with your posts so I don't think it is a
coincidence. It has nothing to do with being blunt and everything to do with
phraseology.

Some people just don't know how to take me. A couple of my oldest friends
&quot;came out&quot; a few years back and I was the last person they told about it
because they didn't know what I'd say, but they knew whatever I said would
be the truth. Funnily enough, of all the people they told, i'm the only one
who still sees them.

And finally, I didn't want to tell everyone about our sordid love affair,
hence me saying i kinda like u. Damn, the secret's out. Too many people
seem
to want me on these groups lately, unfortunately no women, and nobody who's

It may not seriously be your intention, but if U read back through
some of your replys U would def understand where I'm coming from.
It's OK Martin, there is a hell of a lot of us guilty of it
once in a while. Especially when life deals us hard blows at
certain times.
U only kind of like me? :(

BTW - We have a new one;
SIK = Sprite in Keyboard
I have a tall desk w/ shelves above my monitor that holds books
&amp; discs. My cat likes it up there &amp; theres a nice spot that he
lounges on thats cleared off for him. Something scared him into
jumping &amp; down came a couple of books knocking a big, full cup
sprite right onto my new keyboard! FUUUUUUUUUUCK!!! Hadhad to
drag out my old crappy one &amp; U should havehave seen my monitor
freek out for a bit while still connected. WTF??? Weird.

And I kinda like you too Larr, but please don't refer to me as a bully, i
got that label when i was at school because i was bigger than everyone (i
was taller than the teachers when I was 9), yet all i was ever doing was

Point taken mate, it's not something I find easy to do, but it's something I
know about. Believe me, i'm a lot better now than I used to be. Every day,
in every way, i'm getting better and better! Oooh Betty.

And for the record, unlike a lot of people my age, I can take criticism, as
long as it's constructive, which yours is.

that I come across as very blunt, which is true to an extent, but people
who
know me know that I am one of the nicest people around, who will do
anything
for anyone and will look after someone I consider a friend if it's the
last
thing I do.

Some people just don't know how to take me. A couple of my oldest friends
&quot;came out&quot; a few years back and I was the last person they told about it
because they didn't know what I'd say, but they knew whatever I said would
be the truth. Funnily enough, of all the people they told, i'm the only
one
who still sees them.

And finally, I didn't want to tell everyone about our sordid love affair,
hence me saying i kinda like u. Damn, the secret's out. Too many people
seem
to want me on these groups lately, unfortunately no women, and nobody
who's
remotely near me :_(

It may not seriously be your intention, but if U read back through
some of your replys U would def understand where I'm coming from.
It's OK Martin, there is a hell of a lot of us guilty of it
once in a while. Especially when life deals us hard blows at
certain times.
U only kind of like me? :(

BTW - We have a new one;
SIK = Sprite in Keyboard
I have a tall desk w/ shelves above my monitor that holds books
&amp; discs. My cat likes it up there &amp; theres a nice spot that he
lounges on thats cleared off for him. Something scared him into
jumping &amp; down came a couple of books knocking a big, full cup
sprite right onto my new keyboard! FUUUUUUUUUUCK!!! Hadhad to
drag out my old crappy one &amp; U should havehave seen my monitor
freek out for a bit while still connected. WTF??? Weird.

Martin:
Ok people, when I said shut him up, i meant for Jeri to comeback with some
factual stuff which he did, i just worded it badly.

And I kinda like you too Larr, but please don't refer to me as a bully, i
got that label when i was at school because i was bigger than everyone (i
was taller than the teachers when I was 9), yet all i was ever doing was
standing up (no that's not an intentional pun!) for myself.

&gt;&gt; It's a bit different on the pond's west side. While we don't use
those
&gt;&gt; phrases much(or at all), bugger is a specific anal act, while the
&gt; recently
&gt;&gt; struck down (by the Supreme Court) &quot;sodomy laws&quot; could include a
range
&gt; of
&gt;&gt; acts including but not limited to anal, oral, animals, etc. It
depended
&gt; on
&gt;&gt; the individual state's laws. Just a bit of trivia.

It's not for everyone to constantly give you the benefit of the doubt m8.
It's for you to work out what you are doing that causes grief and sort it
out.
Other members who have dropped into the same pit of errors as you have
ended
up being banned from several groups. And before you chuck your toys out of
your pram that isn't a threat. No group wants to be the playground site of
a
flamewar. Alot of us get into the banter and the tittle tattle but
sometimes
the
wrong thing said badly can start a real fight. Why would you want to take
the risk when it is easier to re-read what you are writing and think
twice?

I think you've been told this in another group m8 but what you think you

in
your mind what you mean but if it isn't clear in your writing people can

No worries Martin. When I was your age, I promise U, I was seriously the same way. In fact everyone here here will probably say that they
see traces of it still. &amp; I'll be 1st to admit it. I like to think
I've grown &amp; learned &amp; all that good stuff &amp; figured out how to
deal w/ anger &amp; frustration &amp; concentrate it &amp; channel it into
more positive &amp; constructive things that I hope would help myself
instead of hinder over the years. People take me the wrong way a
good bit still...until they get to know me. The more I get to know
U, I see myself more &amp; more actually.
&amp; we really need to quit letting people know our secrets-LOL. ; )

Some people just don't know how to take me. A couple of my oldest friends

It may not seriously be your intention, but if U read back through
some of your replys U would def understand where I'm coming from.
It's OK Martin, there is a hell of a lot of us guilty of it
once in a while. Especially when life deals us hard blows at
certain times.
U only kind of like me? :(

BTW - We have a new one;
SIK = Sprite in Keyboard
I have a tall desk w/ shelves above my monitor that holds books
&amp; discs. My cat likes it up there &amp; theres a nice spot that he
lounges on thats cleared off for him. Something scared him into
jumping &amp; down came a couple of books knocking a big, full cup
sprite right onto my new keyboard! FUUUUUUUUUUCK!!! Hadhad to

got that label when i was at school because i was bigger than everyone (i

&gt;&gt; It's a bit different on the pond's west side. While we don't use
those
&gt;&gt; phrases much(or at all), bugger is a specific anal act, while the

Martin, thats something that I've really noticed about U, especially
since our 'lil flame war at the get go. Sure we have diff views on
some things &amp; very similar on others, just like most everyone else.
But I really have been meaning to commend U on growing right in front
of my eyes intelectually-so-to-speak. Your a good sport.

Martin:
Point taken mate, it's not something I find easy to do, but it's something I
know about. Believe me, i'm a lot better now than I used to be. Every day,
in every way, i'm getting better and better! Oooh Betty.

And for the record, unlike a lot of people my age, I can take criticism, as
long as it's constructive, which yours is.

It's not for everyone to constantly give you the benefit of the doubt m8.
It's for you to work out what you are doing that causes grief and sort it
out.
Other members who have dropped into the same pit of errors as you have ended
up being banned from several groups. And before you chuck your toys out of
your pram that isn't a threat. No group wants to be the playground site of
a
flamewar. Alot of us get into the banter and the tittle tattle but sometimes
the
wrong thing said badly can start a real fight. Why would you want to take
the risk when it is easier to re-read what you are writing and think twice?

I think you've been told this in another group m8 but what you think you

saying isn't necessarily what other peolpe are reading. It might be clear
in
your mind what you mean but if it isn't clear in your writing people can

Other members who have dropped into the same pit of errors as you have ended
up being banned from several groups. And before you chuck your toys out of
your pram that isn't a threat. No group wants to be the playground site of
a
flamewar. Alot of us get into the banter and the tittle tattle but sometimes
the
wrong thing said badly can start a real fight. Why would you want to take
the risk when it is easier to re-read what you are writing and think twice?

I think you've been told this in another group m8 but what you think you
are
saying isn't necessarily what other peolpe are reading. It might be clear
in
your mind what you mean but if it isn't clear in your writing people can
misinterpret. It happens alot with your posts so I don't think it is a
coincidence. It has nothing to do with being blunt and everything to do
with
phraseology.

know me know that I am one of the nicest people around, who will do
anything
for anyone and will look after someone I consider a friend if it's the
last
thing I do.

Some people just don't know how to take me. A couple of my oldest friends
&quot;came out&quot; a few years back and I was the last person they told about it
because they didn't know what I'd say, but they knew whatever I said would
be the truth. Funnily enough, of all the people they told, i'm the only
one
who still sees them.

And finally, I didn't want to tell everyone about our sordid love affair,
hence me saying i kinda like u. Damn, the secret's out. Too many people
seem
to want me on these groups lately, unfortunately no women, and nobody
who's

It may not seriously be your intention, but if U read back through
some of your replys U would def understand where I'm coming from.
It's OK Martin, there is a hell of a lot of us guilty of it
once in a while. Especially when life deals us hard blows at
certain times.
U only kind of like me? :(

BTW - We have a new one;
SIK = Sprite in Keyboard
I have a tall desk w/ shelves above my monitor that holds books
&amp; discs. My cat likes it up there &amp; theres a nice spot that he
lounges on thats cleared off for him. Something scared him into
jumping &amp; down came a couple of books knocking a big, full cup
sprite right onto my new keyboard! FUUUUUUUUUUCK!!! Hadhad to
drag out my old crappy one &amp; U should havehave seen my monitor
freek out for a bit while still connected. WTF??? Weird.

Martin:
Ok people, when I said shut him up, i meant for Jeri to comeback with some
factual stuff which he did, i just worded it badly.

And I kinda like you too Larr, but please don't refer to me as a bully, i
got that label when i was at school because i was bigger than everyone (i
was taller than the teachers when I was 9), yet all i was ever doing was
standing up (no that's not an intentional pun!) for myself.

&gt; Ah, but that's the point. Its not &quot;your language&quot;. It's American, a
&gt; dialect of the English (circa late 18th century when we became
&gt; independent) language. Generalizing about phase meanings for all

&gt;&gt; It's a bit different on the pond's west side. While we don't use
those
&gt;&gt; phrases much(or at all), bugger is a specific anal act, while the
&gt; recently
&gt;&gt; struck down (by the Supreme Court) &quot;sodomy laws&quot; could include a
range
&gt; of
&gt;&gt; acts including but not limited to anal, oral, animals, etc. It
depended
&gt; on
&gt;&gt; the individual state's laws. Just a bit of trivia.

And I kinda like you too Larr, but please don't refer to me as a bully, i
got that label when i was at school because i was bigger than everyone (i
was taller than the teachers when I was 9), yet all i was ever doing was
standing up (no that's not an intentional pun!) for myself.

&gt; Ah, but that's the point. Its not &quot;your language&quot;. It's American, a
&gt; dialect of the English (circa late 18th century when we became

&gt;&gt; It's a bit different on the pond's west side. While we don't use
those
&gt;&gt; phrases much(or at all), bugger is a specific anal act, while the

Don't compare me to you, eugh! lol

I don't have a load of pent up anger and frustration, but that seems to come
through to people when they try to analyse me. I let it out in my own way,
which generally works pretty well for me.

You and I are too deep dude, like totally deep maaaaaaan!

No worries Martin. When I was your age, I promise U, I was seriously the
same way. In fact everyone here here will probably say that they
see traces of it still. &amp; I'll be 1st to admit it. I like to think
I've grown &amp; learned &amp; all that good stuff &amp; figured out how to
deal w/ anger &amp; frustration &amp; concentrate it &amp; channel it into
more positive &amp; constructive things that I hope would help myself
instead of hinder over the years. People take me the wrong way a
good bit still...until they get to know me. The more I get to know
U, I see myself more &amp; more actually.
&amp; we really need to quit letting people know our secrets-LOL. ; )

Martin:
Yeah, I know. I tend to type as I think, which often comes across in a very
harsh way, but hopefully by now, you peeps know me better than that?

I think you've been told this in another group m8 but what you think you
are
saying isn't necessarily what other peolpe are reading. It might be clear in
your mind what you mean but if it isn't clear in your writing people can
misinterpret. It happens alot with your posts so I don't think it is a
coincidence. It has nothing to do with being blunt and everything to do with
phraseology.

Martin, thats something that I've really noticed about U, especially
since our 'lil flame war at the get go. Sure we have diff views on
some things &amp; very similar on others, just like most everyone else.
But I really have been meaning to commend U on growing right in front
of my eyes intelectually-so-to-speak. Your a good sport.

Martin:
Point taken mate, it's not something I find easy to do, but it's something I
know about. Believe me, i'm a lot better now than I used to be. Every day,
in every way, i'm getting better and better! Oooh Betty.

And for the record, unlike a lot of people my age, I can take criticism, as

It's not for everyone to constantly give you the benefit of the doubt m8.
It's for you to work out what you are doing that causes grief and sort it
out.
Other members who have dropped into the same pit of errors as you have ended
up being banned from several groups. And before you chuck your toys out of
your pram that isn't a threat. No group wants to be the playground site of
a
flamewar. Alot of us get into the banter and the tittle tattle but sometimes
the
wrong thing said badly can start a real fight. Why would you want to take
the risk when it is easier to re-read what you are writing and think twice?

was taller than the teachers when I was 9), yet all i was ever doing was
standing up (no that's not an intentional pun!) for myself.

It's not for everyone to constantly give you the benefit of the doubt m8.
It's for you to work out what you are doing that causes grief and sort it
out.
Other members who have dropped into the same pit of errors as you have
ended
up being banned from several groups. And before you chuck your toys out of
your pram that isn't a threat. No group wants to be the playground site of
a
flamewar. Alot of us get into the banter and the tittle tattle but
sometimes
the
wrong thing said badly can start a real fight. Why would you want to take
the risk when it is easier to re-read what you are writing and think
twice?

I think you've been told this in another group m8 but what you think you
are
saying isn't necessarily what other peolpe are reading. It might be clear
in
your mind what you mean but if it isn't clear in your writing people can

&gt;&gt; It's a bit different on the pond's west side. While we don't use
those
&gt;&gt; phrases much(or at all), bugger is a specific anal act, while the
&gt; recently
&gt;&gt; struck down (by the Supreme Court) &quot;sodomy laws&quot; could include a
range
&gt; of
&gt;&gt; acts including but not limited to anal, oral, animals, etc. It
depended
&gt; on
&gt;&gt; the individual state's laws. Just a bit of trivia.

It may not seriously be your intention, but if U read back through
some of your replys U would def understand where I'm coming from.
It's OK Martin, there is a hell of a lot of us guilty of it
once in a while. Especially when life deals us hard blows at
certain times.
U only kind of like me? :(

BTW - We have a new one;
SIK = Sprite in Keyboard
I have a tall desk w/ shelves above my monitor that holds books
&amp; discs. My cat likes it up there &amp; theres a nice spot that he
lounges on thats cleared off for him. Something scared him into
jumping &amp; down came a couple of books knocking a big, full cup
sprite right onto my new keyboard! FUUUUUUUUUUCK!!! Hadhad to
drag out my old crappy one &amp; U should havehave seen my monitor
freek out for a bit while still connected. WTF??? Weird.

Martin:
Ok people, when I said shut him up, i meant for Jeri to comeback with
some
factual stuff which he did, i just worded it badly.

And I kinda like you too Larr, but please don't refer to me as a bully, i
got that label when i was at school because i was bigger than everyone (i
was taller than the teachers when I was 9), yet all i was ever doing was
standing up (no that's not an intentional pun!) for myself.

LOL! &amp; quit trying to be such a bully. Dropping way down on my likable
scale w/ that crap. &amp; I'm sure I speak for many here w/ that one.
I can probably guess the next reply to this one; &quot;Not trying to be...
I am one&quot;. Well one good dragon punch counters w/ another M8. On a
lighter note...I really do like ya dude.

Andrew W:
Do you really want us to start 'shutting up' people who talk crap?
Think through the consequences Martin. Who d'ya think will be next? :-)

&gt; Ah, but that's the point. Its not &quot;your language&quot;. It's American, a
&gt; dialect of the English (circa late 18th century when we became
&gt; independent) language. Generalizing about phase meanings for all
&gt; English dialects would be the wrong thing to do, hence my comments. So
&gt; bugger off. ;P

Martin, thats something that I've really noticed about U, especially
since our 'lil flame war at the get go. Sure we have diff views on
some things &amp; very similar on others, just like most everyone else.
But I really have been meaning to commend U on growing right in front
of my eyes intelectually-so-to-speak. Your a good sport.

Martin:
Point taken mate, it's not something I find easy to do, but it's something
I

know about. Believe me, i'm a lot better now than I used to be. Every day,
in every way, i'm getting better and better! Oooh Betty.

And for the record, unlike a lot of people my age, I can take criticism, as
long as it's constructive, which yours is.

It's not for everyone to constantly give you the benefit of the doubt m8.
It's for you to work out what you are doing that causes grief and sort it
out.
Other members who have dropped into the same pit of errors as you have
ended
up being banned from several groups. And before you chuck your toys out of
your pram that isn't a threat. No group wants to be the playground site of
a
flamewar. Alot of us get into the banter and the tittle tattle but

wrong thing said badly can start a real fight. Why would you want to take
the risk when it is easier to re-read what you
