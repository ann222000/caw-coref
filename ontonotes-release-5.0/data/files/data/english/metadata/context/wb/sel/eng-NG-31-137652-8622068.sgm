*The Russian military have used nanotechnology in the development of a
new successfully tested weapon. The weapon, a bomb containing 7 tons of
explosives, has been called the &quot;father of all bombs&quot; and it is reportedly
around four times more powerful than its **U.S.** equivalent.*

&quot;The results of the trial of the newly created aviation bomb have shown that
its effectiveness and potential are comparable to a nuclear bomb,&quot; Colonel
General Aleksandr Rukshin, the deputy chief of Russia's armed forces said.
&quot;At the same time I particularly want to emphasize that this bomb does not
cause ecological or environmental pollution, in contrast to a nuclear bomb.&quot;

The basic technology behind the bomb is not new and has been used for at
least 40 years. It is technically known as a thermobaric device. Such a bomb
is filled with flammable liquid and uses a two charge system. When dropped
the initial charge releases and disperses the liquid. The second charge
ignites this fuel / air cloud resulting in a massive shock wave and very
high temperatures.

The new aspect of this bomb is shrouded in secrecy but it is believed the
Russians have used nanotechnology to increase the power of the device. It
stands to reason that they have developed a method for ensuring the
flammable cloud is composed of extremely small droplets thereby increasing
the speed and intensity of the explosive reaction.

bomb *

September 12, 2007, 7:28

*The Russian military says it has successfully tested the world's most
powerful non-nuclear bomb. The device is said to be as potent as an atomic
explosion, but without the radioactive fallout. Until now, the **U.S.** had
the most powerful vacuum bomb, which was tested in 2003 and christened the
&quot;mother of all bombs&quot;.*

It was tested in 2003 at Eglin Air Force Base &lt; http://www.eglin.af.mil/ &gt; in
Florida.

There's no information about where or when the Russian bomb was tested.

The Russian military has dubbed its version the &quot;father of all bombs&quot;.  It
is claimed the bomb is smaller and lighter, yet four times more powerful
than the U.S. version.

Senior military figures are pleased with the results of the trials.  **

*Have your say** *

*These are fuel-air explosives, designed to generate intense blast pressure
over a large area. It is reported that the Russian bomb is a so called
thermo baric bomb that produces both blast and heat. The Russian military
has been a pioneer in the development and use of these thermo baric weapons.
This would have to be one of the largest deliverable, droppable bombs in the
military history.*

John Pike, Director, Global Security Org.**

*&quot;Tests show its effectiveness and capabilities are comparable to nuclear
weapons. At the same time, use of this weapon doesn't damage or pollute the
environment, like a nuclear weapon would,&quot; *says General Colonel Aleksandr
Rukshin, Deputy Chief of Staff.

Also known as the vacuum bomb, it uses a fuel-air explosive more powerful
than TNT.

*&quot;It allows us to reduce accuracy requirements, which makes it cheaper. But
it's still a quality modern weapon,&quot; *said Yury Batylko, a head of
Department at the Defence Ministry Research Institute.

The bomb explodes in mid-air and its destructive power comes from extremely
high temperatures and aftershocks, which incinerate everything nearby.

Powerful fuel-air bombs scorch the earth over a wide area, leaving it
looking like the surface of the moon.

The Defence Ministry says its development does not break any of Russia's
international arms agreements. It also insists the development of the bomb
does not mean the start of a new arms race.
*
&quot;It will allow us to maintain the country's security and to confront
international terrorism in any setting and in any region,&quot; *said General
Colonel Rukshin.

According to the military, the new weapon will replace several smaller types
of nuclear bombs in its arsenal.

*&quot;Actually, the Soviet forces used vacuum bombs, the predecessor of this
one, on a smaller scale in **Afghanistan**. As a matter of fact, it turned
out to be some of the most effective ordnance against mujahideen when used
as a cave-buster,&quot; **Evgeny

Russian army 'tests the father of all bombs'
http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml;jsessionid=X4JYWILORQYGNQF...

By Adrian Blomfield in Moscow

Last Updated: 2:30am BST 13/09/2007

Russia has delivered a belligerent message of defiance to the West after
army generals claimed to have tested &quot;the father of all bombs&quot;.

Developed in secret, the unchristened bomb, a vacuum device capable of
emitting shockwaves as powerful as a nuclear weapon, was unveiled with great
theatre on state television's main evening broadcast.

[image: A mushroom cloud, Russian army 'tests the father of all

A mushroom cloud rises over a plain as Russia's military test their latest
weapon&lt; http://link.brightcove.com/services/link/bcpid1137942531/bclid1155327... &gt;

Boasting that the weapon had &quot;no match in the world,&quot; ORT First Channel
television showed a Tupolev Tu-160 strategic bomber dropping its payload
over a testing ground, followed by a massive explosion.

Pictures of what appeared to be crumpled multi-storey apartment blocks were
also broadcast.

Although there was no independent verification of the Russian military's
claim, the test is likely to cause further consternation in the West after a
series of bellicose statements by the president, Vladimir Putin.

According to Russian generals, the bomb is four times more powerful than the
American Massive Ordnance Air Blast Bomb or
MOAB&lt; http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml;jsessionid=XKPTYWCFB1TFHQF... &gt;
.

Better known as the Mother of All Bombs, the MOAB is a descendent of the
BLU-82 Daisy cutter used in Tora Bora during the war against the Taliban in
2001.

Although it has never been used, the US military says the MOAB is capable of
destroying nine city blocks in one strike.

According to Gen Alexander Rushkin, the Russian deputy chief of staff, the
new bomb is smaller than the MOAB but much deadlier because, due to
nanotechnology, the temperature at the epicentre of the blast is twice as
high.

&quot;Test results of the new airborne weapon have shown that its efficiency and
power is commensurate with a nuclear weapon,&quot; he said.

&quot;The main destruction is inflicted by an ultrasonic shockwave and an
incredibly high temperature,&quot; ORT added.

&quot;All that is alive merely evaporates.&quot;

Despite its destructive qualities, the bomb is environmentally friendly, Gen
Rushkin said.

The test comes after weeks of increasingly belligerent rhetoric from the
Kremlin.

Mr Putin has ordered his long-range nuclear
bombers&lt; http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml;jsessionid=XKPTYWCFB1TFHQF... &gt;to
mount patrols in international airspace for the first time since the
Cold
War.

Last week, Russian Tupolev bombers approached British airspace for the
fourth time in two months and sorties have also been flown close to US
military installations.

Since Mr Putin, an ex-KGB officer, came to power, Russia's annual defence
spending has been quadrupled.

In addition, the Kremlin has announced a £100 billion military modernisation
programme.

The new bomb is further proof that Russia's military has regained its
technological edge. New ground and sea launched nuclear missiles have also
been developed.

Russia has tested the world's most powerful vacuum bomb, which unleashes a
destructive shockwave with the power of a nuclear blast, the military said
on Tuesday, dubbing it the &quot;father of all bombs&quot;.

The bomb is the latest in a series of new Russian weapons and policy moves
as President Vladimir Putin tries to reassert Moscow's role on the
international stage.

&quot;Test results of the new airborne weapon have shown that its efficiency and
power is commensurate with a nuclear weapon,&quot; Alexander Rukshin, Russian
deputy armed forces chief of staff, told Russia's state ORT First Channel
television. The same report was later shown on the state-sponsored Vesti
channel.

&quot;You will now see it in action, the bomb which has no match in the world is
being tested at a military site.&quot;

It showed a Tupolev Tu-160 strategic bomber dropping the bomb over a testing
ground. A large explosion followed.

Pictures showed what looked like a flattened multi-storey block of flats
surrounded by scorched soil and boulders. &quot;The soil looks like a lunar
landscape,&quot; the report said.

&quot;The defence ministry stresses this military invention does not contradict a
single international treaty. Russia is not unleashing a new arms race.&quot;

Such devices generally detonate in two stages. First a small blast disperses
a main load of explosive material into a cloud, which then either
spontaneously ignites in air or is set off by a second charge.

This explosion generates a pressure wave that reaches much further than that
from a conventional explosive. The consumption of gases in the blast also
generates a partial vacuum that can compound damage and injuries caused by
the explosion itself.

&quot;The main destruction is inflicted by an ultrasonic shockwave and an
incredibly high temperature,&quot; the reports said.

&quot;All that is alive merely evaporates.&quot;

Rukshin said: &quot;At the same time, I want to stress that the action of this
weapon does not contaminate the environment, in contrast to a nuclear one.&quot;

&quot;FATHER OF ALL BOMBS&quot;

The Tu-160 supersonic bomber that dropped the bomb, widely known under its
NATO nickname of &quot;Blackjack&quot;, is the heaviest combat aircraft ever built.

Putin, who has overseen the roll-out of new tactical and anti-aircraft
missiles and combat aircraft, has ordered &quot;Blackjacks&quot; and the Tu-95 &quot;Bear&quot;
bombers to patrol around the world.

The report said the new bomb was much stronger than the U.S.-built Massive
Ordnance Air Blast bomb -- MOAB, also known under its name &quot;Mother of All
Bombs&quot;. &quot;So, Russian designers called the new weapon 'Father of All Bombs',&quot;
it said.

Showing the orange-painted U.S. prototype, the report said the Russian bomb
was four times more powerful -- 44 tonnes of TNT equivalent -- and the
temperature at the epicentre of its blast was two times higher.

In 1999 Russian generals threatened to use vacuum bombs to wipe out rebels
from the mountains during the &quot;anti-terrorist operation&quot; in its restive
Chechnya province.

New York-based Human Rights Watch then appealed to Putin to refrain from
using fuel-air explosives. It remains unclear if weapons of this type were
used during the Chechen war.

U.S. forces have used a &quot;thermobaric&quot; bomb, which works on similar
principles, in their campaign against al Qaeda and Taliban forces in the
mountains of eastern Afghanistan.

&quot;It (the bomb) will allow us to safeguard our state's security and fight
international terrorism in any circumstances and in any part of the world,&quot;
Rukshin said.

RUSSIAN ACADEMY OF MILITARY SCIENCES DEBATES ROLE OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS IN
CONFERENCE ON NEW MILITARY DOCTRINE

http://www.wmdinsights.com/I13/I13_R2_RussianAcademy.htm

March 2007 Issue

On January 20, 2007, the Russian Academy of Military Sciences held a special
conference to discuss a revision to Russia's military doctrine. In the
summer of 2005, President Vladimir Putin had declared the need to replace
the 2000 Military Doctrine, which gave a major role to the nuclear component
of Russia's military, but neither the Ministry of Defense nor the General
Staff had taken steps toward preparing a new version of the document until
the late January 2007 conference. [1] The 2000 Military Doctrine allowed
limited use of nuclear weapons for deterrence and &quot;de-escalation&quot; of
conventional attacks on Russia. Reliance on nuclear weapons was expected to
continue until Russia completed the modernization of its conventional
forces. [2] The meeting at the Academy of Military Sciences launched the
review process and outlined broad parameters for a new military doctrine.
The Academy, which was created in the mid-1990s, is primarily staffed by
retired or semi-retired high-level military figures who act in advisory
roles.

The roles and missions of nuclear weapons featured prominently in
deliberations at the January conference, and debates at the conference
suggested that nuclear weapons will retain their current role. Presenters
uniformly pointed to significant threats to Russia's interests and security,
including threats from the United States, that warranted continued reliance
on nuclear deterrence. In his opening remarks, for example, Chief of the
General Staff Yuri Baluevski said that &quot;the end of the ideological and
military confrontation of two political systems has not led to
demilitarization of world politics, as some expected.&quot; [3] He described the
international situation as &quot;dynamic, unstable, tense, and subject to
periodic crises.&quot; He noted that powerful threats emanate both from developed
states and their alliances, as well as from developing countries, some of
which have large well-armed militaries. His equating of the threat from
unnamed developing countries with that from the United States and its allies
represents a shift in the worldview of the Russian military, as the 2000
doctrine viewed nuclear weapons primarily in the context of the threatened
or actual use of force by the United States and its allies against Russia.

The United States and NATO, however, continued to be an important focus of
attention in the description of security concerns at the conference.
&quot;Cooperation with the West,&quot; Baluevski said, &quot;has not resulted in the
reduction of military threats.&quot; The main threat to Russia, he stressed,
comes from the &quot;desire of the United States for global dominance and
attempts to establish a presence in the regions where Russia has been
traditionally present.&quot; The next most important threats, Baluevski declared,
are NATO's eastward enlargement and local conflicts along the perimeter of
Russia's borders. Baluevski also emphasized the growth of international
terrorism, which &quot;has become a long-term element of contemporary political
life, a relatively permanent phenomenon in societal development.&quot; [4]

The keynote speaker, General (ret.) Mahmoud Gareev, offered a somewhat
different perspective on future threats. He predicted that &quot;in the next
10-15 years, ecological and the energy factors will become the main cause of
political and military conflicts.&quot; Apparently referring to the U.S. presence
in Iraq, he stated that some states will seek to control energy resources,
while others will have little choice except to perish or resist. [5] In
Gareev's assessment, competition for energy sources will pit Russia first
and foremost against the United States and other developed countries, but
will also spur nuclear proliferation, as other energy-rich countries seek
nuclear weapons to defend their resources from the United States. This could
lead to a &quot;war of everyone against everyone.&quot;

Given these conditions, Gareev asserted that nuclear weapons will remain the
&quot;central, most reliable means for the strategic deterrence of external
aggression.&quot; He predicted that although future wars will primarily be
conventional, the threat of nuclear use will always be present. Thus,
Russianeeds to rely on its nuclear arsenal given the unfavorable
balance of
conventional forces in all theaters. The role of nuclear weapons will be all
the more important, Gareev asserted, because the nuclear armaments of almost
all other nuclear weapons states are aimed at Russia; therefore, he
concluded, Russia must maintain a credible and robust strategic nuclear
deterrent. He noted, however, that due to the deterioration of Russia's
space-based observation capabilities, ground-based early warning systems,
and offensive weapons, Russia's &quot;ability to launch a strike on warning, much
less a second strike is becoming problematic.&quot; [6]

Continuing the theme that Russia needs to maintain a strong nuclear
deterrent, the first vice-president of the Academy of Military Sciences,
General Varfolomei Korobushin, declared that nuclear weapons remain &quot;the
most radical and the cheapest tool for security.&quot; [7] He charged that
the United
States is seeking to &quot;qualitatively upgrade&quot; its nuclear capabilities and to
develop earth-penetrating nuclear weapons that will be designed to minimize
fall-out. [*Editor's Note: To date, the **U.S.** Congress has refused to
authorize the development of new nuclear weapons with these capabilities.*]
He also said that the missile defense program pursued by the United
Statesis intended to undermine the effectiveness of
Russia's nuclear deterrence, but noted that the actual capabilities of
U.S.missile defenses will remain &quot;negligible&quot; until 2015-2020.

Conference speakers made it clear that Russia continues to rely on the
threat of limited nuclear use for the purpose of de-escalating large-scale
conventional conflicts. Thus, Chief of the Main Operations Department of the
General Staff, Aleksandr Rukshin, emphasized that &quot;the purpose of strategic
deterrence is prevention of aggression and the threat of force against
Russia in peacetime and, during war, de-escalation and termination of
hostilities on acceptable conditions….&quot; [8] Specifically, in a regional war,
the armed forces should be prepared to &quot;compel the aggressor to terminate
hostilities on the conditions that meet the interests of the Russian
Federation and its allies.&quot; (According to the 2000 Military Doctrine,
nuclear weapons can be used in &quot;regional conflicts&quot; – an intermediate class
of conflicts between local and global wars.) In particular, strategic forces
must be able to inflict damage that would offset the aggressor's goals. This
statement directly refers to the notion of &quot;predetermined damage&quot; (*zadannyi
ushcherb*), introduced in the 2000 Military Doctrine, which refers to damage
that is commensurate to the enemy's stakes in a conflict. For limited
conflicts (such as a regional war), such damage could be less than the more
traditional notion of &quot;unacceptable damage&quot; because the goals of the enemy,
while still significant, are expected to be limited. The flexibility
provided by the concept of &quot;predetermined damage&quot; effectively permits
Russian military planners to depart from the rigidity of &quot;unacceptable
damage&quot; or &quot;mutual assured destruction.&quot;

Even as conference participants insisted that Russia must continue to rely
on nuclear weapons, some called for further nuclear arms reductions. For
example, Academy Vice President Korobushin called for an agreement
with the United
States on the reduction of strategic nuclear arsenals to 1,500 deployed
warheads. The 2002 Moscow Treaty requires the two parties to reduce the
number of their deployed warheads to between 1,700 and 2,200. Korobushin
suggested that after the Russian and U.S. arsenals drop to 1,500 warheads,
three other nuclear weapons states – Great Britain, France, and China –
should join the disarmament process. [9]

The deliberations at the Academy of Military Sciences demonstrated that the
&quot;nuclear component&quot; of Russia's new military doctrine will likely remain
unchanged. It remains to be seen, of course, whether the conference is a
reliable predictor: the development of the new doctrine will now move to the
General Staff and will subsequently be reviewed by other agencies and
deliberated in the Russian Security Council before President Putin makes the
final determination as to the document's contents. Although significant
changes could be introduced at any of these stages, the conference
statements provide a useful guide to the current thinking of the military
establishment.

21. TU-160 BOMBER TAKING OFF

STORY: Russia has tested the world's most powerful vacuum bomb, which
unleashes a destructive shockwave with the power of a nuclear blast, the
military said on Tuesday (September 11), dubbing it the &quot;father of all
bombs&quot;.

The bomb is the latest in a series of new Russian weapons and policy
moves as President Vladimir Putin tries to reassert Moscow's role on the
international stage.

&quot;Test results of the new airborne weapon have shown that its efficiency
and power is commensurate with a nuclear weapon,&quot; Alexander Rukshin, Russian
deputy armed forces chief of staff, told Russia's state ORT First Channel
television. The same report was later shown on the state-sponsored Vesti
channel.

It showed a Tupolev Tu-160 strategic bomber dropping the bomb over a
testing ground. A large explosion followed.

Pictures showed what looked like a flattened multi-storey block of flats
surrounded by scorched soil and boulders. The report said the soil looked
like a lunar landscape.

Yuriy Balyko, Head of the Management of the Russian Defense Ministry's
30th Secret Research Centre, said: &quot;This allowed us to demand less accuracy
from the bomb, which made it cheaper to produce - something we need in
today's circumstances. We receive a comparably cheap weapon with great
destructive capability.&quot;

Such devices generally detonate in two stages. First a small blast
disperses a main load of explosive material into a cloud, which then either
spontaneously ignites in air or is set off by a second charge.

This explosion generates a pressure wave that reaches much further than
that from a conventional explosive. The consumption of gases in the blast
also generates a partial vacuum that can compound damage and injuries caused
by the

explosion itself.

&quot;The main destruction is inflicted by an ultrasonic shockwave and an
incredibly high temperature,&quot; the reports said. &quot;All that is alive merely
evaporates.&quot;

Rukshin added: &quot;At the same time, I want to stress that the action of
this weapon does not contaminate the environment, in contrast to a nuclear
one.&quot;

The Tu-160 supersonic bomber that dropped the bomb, widely known under
its NATO nickname of &quot;Blackjack&quot;, is the heaviest combat aircraft ever
built.  Putin, who has overseen the roll-out of new tactical and
anti-aircraft missiles and combat aircraft, has ordered &quot;Blackjacks&quot; and the
Tu-95 &quot;Bear&quot; bombers to patrol around the world.

The report said the new bomb was much stronger than the
U.S.-builtMassive Ordnance Air Blast bomb --
MOAB, also known under its name &quot;Mother of All Bombs&quot;. &quot;So, Russian
designers called the new weapon 'Father of All Bombs',&quot; it said.

Showing the orange-painted U.S. prototype, the report said the Russian
bomb was four times more powerful -- 44 tonnes of TNT equivalent -- and the
temperature at the epicentre of its blast was two times higher.

In 1999 Russian generals threatened to use vacuum bombs to wipe out
rebels from the mountains during the &quot;anti-terrorist operation&quot; in its
restive Chechnya province.

New York-based Human Rights Watch then appealed to Putin to refrain from
using fuel-air explosives. It remains unclear if weapons of this type were
used during the Chechen war.

U.S. forces have used a &quot;thermobaric&quot; bomb, which works on similar
principles, in their campaign against al Qaeda and Taliban forces in the
mountains of eastern Afghanistan.

Moscow Boasts No &quot;Environmental Pollution&quot; With Powerful New
Bomb&lt; http://mensnewsdaily.com/2007/09/13/moscow-announces-powerful-new-bomb/ &gt;

September 12, 2007 (RFE/RL) — It's being dubbed the &quot;father of all bombs&quot;
and it is alleged to have a capacity four times more powerful than its
U.S.equivalent.

Speaking on Russia's state ORT television channel on September 11, Colonel
General Aleksandr Rukshin, the deputy chief of Russia's armed forces, said
the bomb had been successfully tested at a military site.

&quot;The results of the trial of the newly created aviation bomb have shown that
its effectiveness and potential are comparable to a nuclear bomb,&quot; Rukshin
said. &quot;At the same time I particularly want to emphasize that this bomb does
not cause ecological or environmental pollution, in contrast to a nuclear
bomb.&quot;

Television pictures showed the bomb dropping by parachute from a Tu-160
supersonic bomber and flattening what appeared to be a four-story block. The
report said the bomb, technically known as a thermobaric device, contained 7
tons of explosives.

Old Technology, But On Larger Scale

Pavel Felgenhauer, who writes a column on defense issues in the &quot;Novaya
gazeta&quot; newspaper, explained how the so-far unnamed device works.

&quot;It's a bomb filled with flammable liquid,&quot; Felgenhauer says. &quot;The bomb
drops, breaks up, the liquid is released, it swiftly evaporates, and then
there is a delayed igniter that ignites the mixture of air and flammable
liquid. There's a terrific shock wave after such an explosion and very high
temperatures. The problem is, of course, that they are much heavier than
nuclear weapons.&quot;

The extra weight, Felgenhauer says, makes them harder to transport than
nuclear bombs. According to the report, the designers have used
nanotechnology to increase the power of the bomb. But Felgenhauer says there
is nothing new here.

&quot;Such bombs, of course, have already been used for 40 years,&quot; he says. &quot;They
were first invented by the Americans and used in Vietnam, then used very
much by the Russian military in Afghanistan. They were used in Chechnya.
Basically, such bombs are used against troops in bunkers, because the
exploding fuel-air mixture can also penetrate trenches and bunkers.&quot;

Military On Parade

The testing of the weapon comes at a time when Russia is attempting to
reassert itself on the international stage. In recent months, President
Vladimir Putin has revived the Soviet practice of sending heavy bombers out
on long-range flights.

&quot;I think that this is part of a sustained campaign just to remind people
that Russia is a powerful military force, &quot; says Robert Hewson, editor of
&quot;Jane's Air-Launched Weapons.&quot; &quot;This is not a majorly significant military
weapon, because it's a free-fall bomb that has to be dropped by bomber, so
it's not going to be used in any advanced conflict. But it is clearly
destructive and it's attention-getting, and that's what its most important
purpose is.&quot;

Already strained relations between Russia and the United States soured
further recently over Washington's plans to deploy parts of an antimissile
system in Central Europe. Moscow is opposed to the U.S. plans, saying they
are a threat to Russia's security. Washington says the shield is meant to
defend against potential attacks from states such as Iran.
