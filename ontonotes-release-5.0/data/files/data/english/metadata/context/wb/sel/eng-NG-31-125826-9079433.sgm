When will they ever learn? If you don't want fines don't use bus
lanes.

&quot;Shocked drivers have hit out at the company which owns the
controversial bus lane in Hounslow after it was revealed it has
scooped more than £100,000 in fines.

But Blenheim Norwest says it is considering putting in extra signage
following last week's outcry from motorists, who have been served with
penalties after driving along the road outside Asda at the Blenheim
Centre...&quot;

&quot;
A spokesman for the council confirmed the meeting, saying: &quot;As it stands,
the signage they have is adequate. However, our advice was it would be more
helpful to motorists if it was placed at locations well before you come to
this road.

&quot;It is not our responsibility to enforce any rules on signage, as this
matter is about a private road and not a public one.&quot;
&quot;

Bus lane on a private road?  Like thats enforceable.

Maybe Doug is having an effect on my sense of humour

BBC Wales had a story of a motorist in Llandovery who threw his £60parking
ticket @ the warden, he refused to pick it up so he also has a £75 ticket
for littering.

Sorry but that IS funny. I would have done exactly the same myself
though, or at the least threatened to insert it where the sun don't
shine. Can't say I have much time for traffic wardens, though I don't
doubt they do a useful job.

Check out EPA 1990 Ss 46,7 as amended by Clean Neighbourhoods and

Why? I never drop litter and would explode at my grandkids if they did.
I don't smoke, I don't chew gum, I don't spit in the street and I
recycle everything I can. Nowt to bother me in there, just as speed
cameras hold no fear for me, or DNA data bases.

Doubt if either outcome is likely.  In the event of your actually reporting
it, Virgin will look at all the evidence..... and probably come to the same

No, they write you a threatening letter with copies of the transcripts
of the offensive postings. In my case, they sent it to the wrong
address. You then have to reply stating that you apologise and that you
will not not use such language again. Failure to do so results in your
being cut off, simple as that. Then you have to speak to the head of
security at NTL who will not even continue the conversation unless you
agree to the apology over the phone. He was quite specific about that
particular word.

I notice you are with Virgin as well. You also used the same word. Oh dear.

Not really, mate. I am pretty much immune to such stuff. Just words. It
would be silly to lose sleep over such a petty matter. The security
bloke has his job to do and I respect that. Had I wanted to be bothered
to blag my way out of the situation then I could have done. I am
registered with Virgin as Rev, rather than Mr. Everyone believes a Rev,
my son.

The only thing that made me laugh was that if Virgin want to stop bad
behaviour on usenet then they are papering over the pinholes while the
huge holes are letting water by the gallon. Obviously theu can't stop
such behaviour, so why do they bother to try? If people don't want to
respect each others opinions then they wont.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; will not not use such language again. Failure to do so results in your
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; being cut off, simple as that. Then you have to speak to the head of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; security at NTL who will not even continue the conversation unless you
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; agree to the apology over the phone. He was quite specific about that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; particular word.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Heh, forced to eat humble pie... how that must have hurt.
&gt;&gt; Not really, mate. I am pretty much immune to such stuff.

&gt; But Brian, if it didn't offend you, care to explain why you decided to
&gt; &quot;report&quot; Firth and I? Because you're a vindictive maggot who wants to
&gt; 'win' at any cost, and you get some malicious hardon over someone else
&gt; being told off for something you've done several times yourself?

&gt;&gt; Just words. It
&gt;&gt; would be silly to lose sleep over such a petty matter.

&gt; Then why, pray, were you so keen to point out that you'll report the
&gt; use of the word?

&gt;&gt; The security
&gt;&gt; bloke has his job to do and I respect that. Had I wanted to be bothered
&gt;&gt; to blag my way out of the situation then I could have done. I am
&gt;&gt; registered with Virgin as Rev, rather than Mr. Everyone believes a Rev,
&gt;&gt; my son.

&gt; Hmmmm, I dunno. You've not been on this newsgroup long, maybe about
&gt; six months now, but you sure haven't wasted any time - Brian Robertson

I dont think so Brian. See, I've been reported before, and I've

they'll have to choose between closing my account or deciding that the

Brian, your last FIFTY posts here have deliberately inflammatory and
argumentative, and you seem to post purely to court controversy and
generally 'wind up' others.
So, how about answering the question. Since you use the same word
yourself, and state that it doesn't bother you, WHAT is the reason for
you reporting two other posters for using it?

Do you trust the law and do you trust the people who administer it are
two different questions. I believe in the death penalty for people like
Brady and the Yorkshire ripper. I don't trust the people who administer
the law to administer such a penalty though. Ergo, I would not vote for
the death penalty.

Back in the 1970s my family were closely involved in a campaign to
reintroduce the death penalty on the basis of the murder of a little
girl from Rochdale. Many of you will know the story. It left a lifetime
bitter taste in my mouth. Most mistakes I can put down to experience,
but that little episode shames me and I want it to continue shaming me
so that I don't forget.

I hope that those who think the McCanns murdered their little girl will
be as quick to pick up and carry their burden of guilt when they are
proved innocent.

your argument for the existence of a god? You claim to be a rev?

&gt;&gt; &quot;Shocked drivers have hit out at the company which owns the
&gt;&gt; controversial bus lane in Hounslow after it was revealed it has
&gt;&gt; scooped more than £100,000 in fines.
&gt; &quot;
&gt; A spokesman for the council confirmed the meeting, saying: &quot;As it stands,
&gt; the signage they have is adequate. However, our advice was it would be
&gt; more
&gt; helpful to motorists if it was placed at locations well before you come to
&gt; this road.

&gt; &quot;It is not our responsibility to enforce any rules on signage, as this
&gt; matter is about a private road and not a public one.&quot;
&gt; &quot;

&gt; Bus lane on a private road?  Like thats enforceable.

It does seem an odd arrangement. I thought that rules such as &quot;one way&quot;
couldn't be legally enforced on private roads such as supermarket car-parks.

I'm in favour of enforcing bus lanes in general, though I would like to see
the rules relaxed very slightly to allow cars into the bus lane briefly when
the *only* reason that they cannot proceed in their own lane is because
there's a car in front of them which is stopped waiting for a gap in
oncoming traffic so it can turn right.

Just where exactly did I say that Dawkins is useless? I said that one of
his main arguments is useless. Dawkins argues that God must have had a
creator. Ergo, he cannot be God. The very nature of an omnipresent God
must, of necessity, place him completely outside of the mathematical
model frequently refered to as the space/time continuum.

As three-dimensional beings, we perceive time only as a result of
memory. We remember what was as a variable interval from what is now. If
we had zero memory, we could not detect time - we would exist only for
the moment. The result of this is our apparent perception of time as a
linear line, always going forward.

For a God, time, space - and even creation - would look very different
to us. He may exist in only one instant, or all instants, or he may
exist beyond all instants. He certainly can't be dismissed by such a
weak argument.

On the other hand, the rest of what Dawkins says is rock solid. There is
no God.

I am a Rev. You can ALL be Revs. Sign up here: http://www.themonastery.org/

Even our budgie is a Rev!

&gt;&gt; Conversely, sending spurious abuse reports and using ISP's as weapons
&gt;&gt; does you *heaps* of credit, right?

&gt;Up to Virgin to decide if they are spurious now.

Nice sidestep, but what  I actually asked was - does your reporting
something which you acknowledge to be innocuous do you any credit?

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Maybe Doug is having an effect on my sense of humour

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; BBC Wales had a story of a motorist in Llandovery who threw his
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; £60parking ticket @ the warden, he refused to pick it up so he also
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; has a £75 ticket for littering.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. Now that IS funny!

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Heh.
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Wait 'til you get a FPN under the Environmental Protection Act 1990.
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Sorry but that IS funny. I would have done exactly the same myself
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; though, or at the least threatened to insert it where the sun don't
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; shine. Can't say I have much time for traffic wardens, though I don't
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; doubt they do a useful job.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Check out EPA 1990 Ss 46,7 as amended by Clean Neighbourhoods and
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Environment Act 2005 and hope your Local Authority isn't too
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; heavy-handed in application of FPNs.
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; http://tinyurl.com/39fjxx [1.5MB PDF]

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Why? I never drop litter and would explode at my grandkids if they did.
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; I don't smoke, I don't chew gum, I don't spit in the street and I
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; recycle everything I can. Nowt to bother me in there, just as speed
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; cameras hold no fear for me, or DNA data bases.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Myself similarly. However, there appears to be some inconsistently in
&gt; &gt;&gt; application of the guidance not least when targets are at issue whether
&gt; &gt;&gt; or not enforcement officers are employed directly or indirectly by a
&gt; &gt;&gt; Local Authority. For example, could you prove that you never put the
&gt; &gt;&gt; wrong things in a recycling receptacle belonging to your property?

&gt; &gt; Do you trust the law

&gt; Yes.

No.

&gt; &gt; and do you trust the people who administer it

&gt; Maybe.
">

No but fining motorists who break the law can't be bad, especially as
a large majority do when they exceed speed limits.
