I have alot of   geckos.  I do well with all of them and I am
preparing to breed my lepords.  Very  exciting! But I have a Gecko
Named Harvey.  Like two face from batman.  Since he's a fat tail and
looks a bit like he has two faces.&lt;heads&gt; any way i've had him since
january a bit of a late christmas gift from my cousin.  I love him and
want to keep him but I can't get him to eat.  I've tried everything,
wax worms, meili worms, crickets, earth worms, and much more.  I call
him hunger strike Harvey..  I've had him to the vet neumerous times.
and she's given him a solution to hydrate him , no good, a calcium
solution, no good , A substitute food, no good a few others.  At first
I thought he was impacted. because he wouldn't go to the bathroom even
though i was force hydrating and feeding him. Then he finally went
like a condor down my pant leg . I got him to eat a bit after that but
not now and the vet says she's not sure what else to do.  I'm at a
loss and just don't want to see him go on like this.  Does any one
know what to do I'm willing to send him to any one who can help him.
FOR FREE.  I just want him to get better.  All I ask is a follow up
email to see how he's doing.  Thanks much
