Jeremiah 21 - NASB

Jeremiah's Message for Zedekiah
Ê1The word which came to Jeremiah from the LORD when (A)King Zedekiah sent to him
(B)Pashhur the son of Malchijah, and (C)Zephaniah the priest, the son of Maaseiah, saying,

Ê2&quot;Please (D)inquire of the LORD on our behalf, for (E)Nebuchadnezzar king of (F)Babylon
is warring against us; perhaps the LORD will deal with us (G)according to all His wonderful
acts, so that the enemy will withdraw from us.&quot;

Ê3Then Jeremiah said to them, &quot;You shall say to Zedekiah as follows:

Ê4'Thus says the LORD God of Israel, &quot;Behold, I am about to (H)turn back the weapons of
war which are in your hands, with which you are warring against the king of Babylon and
the Chaldeans who are besieging you outside the wall; and I will (I)gather them into the
center of this city.

Ê5&quot;I (J)Myself will war against you with an (K)outstretched hand and a mighty arm, even in
(L)anger and wrath and great indignation.

Ê6&quot;I will also strike down the inhabitants of this city, both man and beast; they will die of a
great (M)pestilence.

Ê7&quot;Then afterwards,&quot; declares the LORD, &quot;(N)I will give over Zedekiah king of Judah and his
servants and the people, even those who survive in this city from the pestilence, the sword
and the famine, into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and into the hand of
their foes and into the hand of those who seek their lives; and he will strike them down
with the edge of the sword He (O)will not spare them nor have pity nor compassion.&quot;'

Ê8&quot;You shall also say to this people, 'Thus says the LORD, &quot;Behold, I (P)set before you the
way of life and the way of death.

Ê9&quot;He who (Q)dwells in this city will die by the (R)sword and by famine and by pestilence;
but he who goes out and falls away to the Chaldeans who are besieging you will live, and
he will have his own life as booty.

Ê10&quot;For I have (S)set My face against this city for harm and not for good,&quot; declares the
LORD &quot;It will be (T)given into the hand of the king of Babylon and he will (U)burn it with
fire.&quot;'

Ê11&quot;Then say to the household of the (V)king of Judah, 'Hear the word of the LORD,

Ê12O (W)house of David, thus says the LORD:
ÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊ&quot;(X)Administer justice every (Y)morning;
ÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊAnd deliver the person who has been robbed from the power of his oppressor,
ÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊ(Z)That My wrath may not go forth like fire
ÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊAnd (AA)burn with none to extinguish it,
ÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊBecause of the evil of their deeds.
ÊÊÊÊ13&quot;Behold, (AB)I am against you, O (AC)valley dweller,
ÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊO rocky plain,&quot; declares the LORD,
ÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊ&quot;You men who say, '(AD)Who will come down against us?
ÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊOr who will enter into our habitations?'
ÊÊÊÊ14&quot;But I will punish you (AE)according to the results of your deeds,&quot; declares the LORD,
ÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊ&quot;And I will (AF)kindle a fire in its forest
ÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊThat it may devour all its environs.&quot;'&quot;

Dearest Father God,
order my steps
this day.
In the busyness of my life,
allow me to keep my
God-given focus. My goal
each day is to make the time
for the things eternal
and to set aside those things
that clutter my life and
steal my joy.
In Jesus' name, Amen
and
Dearest Father God,
I know that You are
in control, I know that
You're going to see me
through; I trust You. I know
that no weapon formed against
me is going to prosper.

Today, I will focus on the
peace inside of me.
In Jesus' name, Amen.
Jesus said, &quot;I am the good
shepherd. I know my own
and my own know me, just
as the Father knows me and
I know the Father. And
I lay down my life for the sheep.&quot;
-John 10:14-15 (NRSV)

STANDING in the checkout
line of the grocery store,
I overheard two elderly
women in front of me lamenting
the problems of old age.
&quot;I think life is backwards,
&quot; said one. &quot;We should be
born alone and lonely and
die warm and cuddled
in loving arms.&quot;
Her words made me stop to
think. If we know Christ, we
do die warm and cuddled
in loving arms. We who trust
Christ as our Savior are his
tender lambs. We are born
into this earthly world to
be held in the arms of our human
parents, and we are born
a second time into the loving
arms of Christ when we
trust him as our Savior. These
arms will hold us when we
leave our temporary bodies
and enter eternally into the
presence of our loving God.
What a comfort to know that
we do not have to die lonely!
Christ has conquered death
and prepared a home for us
in heaven, where he waits
for us with open arms.
Caroleah Johnson
(California, U.S.A.)

Lets Pray
Precious Lord, thank you for each day of life you
give us on earth and for the eternal life that will
be ours in heaven. We trust that we will rest
eternally in the comfort of your embrace. Amen.

&quot;There's Still Room&quot;

&quot;Blessed are those who are invited to the marriage supper of the Lamb. These are true words of God.&quot; (Revelation 19:9) &quot;'Sir,' the servant said, 'what you ordered has been done, but there is still room'&quot; (Luke 14:22).

The most remarkable eating place here in Lancaster County and actually perhaps anywhere I've ever eaten is the Shady Maple. It's an all you can eat buffet so I approach cautiously and rarely. I would have an even bigger pouch if I went there as often as I like! The food is great but the most outstanding feature is the tremendous variety of about everything edible. It's by far the biggest restaurant I've patronized with the main dining area seating 1,200 people and the banquet facilities another 1,000. As much as I look forward to a visit to the Shady Maple, it pales in comparison to the anticipation I feel as I contemplate the great banquet Jesus is preparing for believers in heaven.

Heaven is going to be an extraordinarily remarkable place. Among our blessings will be the Marriage Supper of the Lamb, an absolutely incredible banquet that will surely be unlike any on this earth. When I try to figure out how all this will happen I quickly realize that while I live in this tent of a body I &quot;see through a glass darkly.&quot; Or as the old hymn says, &quot;the half has never yet been told.&quot;

Perhaps Jesus had this marriage supper in mind when He told the Parable of the Great Banquet in Luke 14:15-24. The overall message of the parable is about the excuses and outright rejection of many in regard to entering God's Kingdom. That's still true today! The Master instructs His servants to go out and extend invitations to a great banquet. Many who were invited made excuses as to why they couldn't come.

The banquet invitation was then extended further, &quot;Go out quickly into the streets and alleys of the town and bring in the poor, the crippled, the blind and the lame.&quot; The servants returned to their master with the report found in the daily text, &quot;what you ordered has been done, but there is still room.&quot;

Yes indeed, there's still room. And today the Master's servants continue to extend the invitation to a great banquet. Scores of devoted missionaries, evangelists and pastors are proclaiming &quot;There's still room.&quot; Dedicated lay people are taking this message to their world today, &quot;There's still room.&quot; Through this internet ministry Brooksyne and I want to declare, &quot;There's still room!&quot;

And of course many people continue to make excuses. What a great truth is found in verse 23 where we read of God's desire &quot;that my house will be full.&quot;

Let me ask you today. Have you accepted the invitation or are you still making excuses? If you have accepted the invitation, are you joining the servants in faithfully proclaiming, &quot;There's still room!&quot;

Be encouraged today,

Stephen &amp; Brooksyne Weber

Daily prayer: Jesus, the theme of the great banquet parable calls to mind another parable where You challenge the conventional way of thinking as You forthrightly tell Your listeners, &quot;the first shall be last and the last shall be first.&quot; We see a lot of people who've been invited to the banquet table to eat of the Bread of Life. Some have tasted and seen that the Lord is good while others continue to crave the pleasures of this world instead. You are the Bread of Heaven that nurtures our spiritual hunger and the Living Water that quenches our eternal thirst! Our lives will never be the same as they were before we drew from Your well of salvation. Since Your well is bottomless and Your supply unending we invite all to inherit eternal life, for there is still room because You are not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance. Amen.

---------------------------------

Note from Brooksyne: One of the ways we can reach others to let them know &quot;there's still room&quot; is by sharing our testimony. Since that can be very difficult to verbalize when one is nervous or limited for time it's great to have it available in print. When people meet me as a &quot;seasoned&quot; believer it can be difficult for them to picture my life before I made a decision to follow Christ. I wrote a brief testimony about my salvation experience about four years ago and often share it in my chaplaincy role, in letters, and in other settings so that I can reveal the miraculous redemptive work God has done in my life at an early age. If you haven't already, may I challenge you to write your testimony and distribute it to those you seek to influence for Jesus. When Christ calls me home I can think of no other way to influence people for Jesus than to have my testimony read at my funeral. Should you consider doing this spiritual exercise here's an easy outline I devised that
may be of help to you as well:
1) My life before Christ
2) The way I came to Christ
3) The changes in my life after I received Christ
(It's important not to be too wordy or people will not spend the time reading it. Major on the majors and minor on the minors.)

Here's an online version of my testimony.

---------------------------------

Parable of the Great Banquet (Luke 14:15-24)

---------------------------------

Jim and Wendy have been our friends since we moved down from New England in early 2001 and he is the former pastor of the church we attend. This last Saturday their son Jonathan married Norma and we attended the wedding and reception. Jim is a good man with an earnest walk. Wendy is a wonderful compliment to him and one of the kindest persons we've ever met. Both have been very loving to Ester and attentive to her. Since Wendy is often mistaken for Brooksyne's sister Ester calls her Aunt Wendy and certainly loves her as though she were blood related.

This wedding was a lot different than any I've ever been to:

Jonathan is a very colorful young man and he had all the men in the wedding party dress in kilts (you can't tell from the photo but Jim is wearing one.) That's interesting since Jim is Italian!
The flower girl pulled the ring bearer, a little guy about eight months old, in a wagon! That was sure cute.
But the highlight, hopefully captured on video for America's Funniest Videos: When the bride and groom were ready to walk back down the aisle after getting married the minister had mistakenly stepped on her train. Since she had some slack she walked a bit before being snapped back. He then lifted his foot and she lunged forward! Her new husband caught her. He already proved his worth as a husband minutes after saying &quot;I do.&quot;

---------------------------------

The Shady Maple is a huge restaurant well known in these parts.

---------------------------------

Today's music:
As we considered music for today's message an old gospel song came to mind, &quot;There's Room At The Cross For You&quot;, but I was unable to find an audio online. But here are some great songs.
&quot;Come Just As You Are&quot; (Audio)
&quot;Come To Jesus&quot; (Video) A beautiful song set to some wonderful photos.
Another version (Same song with different background images) The young people who put these together really do a great job (I assume they are young people!)

As I prepared today's message and viewed these videos I have several specific people on my heart today that I hope and pray will view them and indeed come to Jesus.

---------------------------------

Anytime these messages are prepared some readers are going through a trial of some type. This morning we are remembering in prayer our readers in southern California.

Here is Billy Graham speaking about rules in the game of life:

Can you imagine a game without rules? What if anyone could just make up his own rules as he went along? There would be as many rules as there would be players, and the game wouldn't be fun anymore. And in the game of being a Christian there are rules too. There are the Ten Commandments, the Sermon on the Mount. But the trouble is, nobody can live up to them. You haven't &quot;[loved] the Lord [your] God with all [your] heart, and all [your] soul, and all [your] mind.&quot; I haven't. You haven't either. We've come short of God's requirements. We're short of what God says you have to have to get to heaven. I don't have it. It has to be provided for me and that's what Christ did on the cross. He provided a righteousness and a goodness for me that I normally do not have.

2008 &quot;The Year of the Church&quot;
by Dr. Larry Ollison

A few weeks ago while spending time with the Lord, I had this question on my heart. &quot;What are Your plans for me and for my ministry?&quot; From deep within my spirit I heard these words. &quot;This coming year will be the year of the church.&quot;
My first question was this. &quot;What does it mean that 2008 will be the year of the church?&quot; The church was here this year and last year. In fact, the church has been on the Earth every year since the time Jesus put His blood on the Mercy Seat. When Jesus became the firstfruits into the Kingdom and became the firstborn among many brethren, the church was established. Jesus then took His position as the head of the church and all who received Him became a part of His body. The church has existed for centuries, so what does it mean &quot;2008 is the year of the church?&quot;
Over the last few weeks I have meditated on this and God has spoken clearly to my heart. As for me and those who attend my church and receive from this ministry, 2008 is the year for every member of the church to stand up and be the church. The time that once was future is now here. We are truly living in the last moments of the last days. We are the generation that will usher in the return of the Messiah. The waiting is over and the time is at hand for the church to stand up and operate in the power and authority that was prophesied by Jesus.
2008 is the Year for the Church to Stand Up and Be the Church
It is time for the church to quit being &quot;seeker friendly&quot; and become &quot;Holy Spirit friendly.&quot; When the world looks at Christians, they should see the light shining in such a way that they are drawn to a loving God instead of being drawn to God’s stuff. While it is true that God wants to prosper every believer physically and financially, the gift should not receive more glory than the giver.
Jesus told us that Christians were to be fishers of men, but a BMW or a Mercedes should not be the bait on the hook. Now don’t take me wrong. There is nothing wrong with owning a BMW or a Mercedes. Personally, a silver BMW Z-4 is a beautiful car and there is nothing wrong with having one. If you see one in the Pastor’s parking spot at church, it’s okay. God doesn’t mind. However, the motivation of Jesus being pierced with nails and dying on the cross was not so you could have a new BMW and it shouldn’t be your motivation for spreading the gospel either. We should attract people to a loving God in such a way that they will love Him more than His stuff.
Many people in the church are hurting, offended, and bitter. I heard a man say last week that life had been bad to him. While it may be true that the world has treated him poorly, God is a good God and His plan is full of goodness.
It’s time for the church to get over bitterness, discouragement, depression, and fear of people. This is the year the church must take a stand and proclaim the Word to the world with strength and authority.
Psalm 119:165 says, &quot;Great peace have they which love Thy law and nothing shall offend them.&quot; The church must quit talking about what the world has done to them and start talking about what God has done for them. This is the time, this is the year for the church to stand up and be the church.
While in Old Jerusalem, a storekeeper told me that Christians often leave tracts in his store hoping that he will find them and receive Jesus. He made an interesting statement to me. He said, &quot;Instead of Christians leaving a tract, they should become a living tract, and then being a Christian would be attract-ive.&quot;
It’s time for Christians to quit talking about what they are in the world and be who they are to the world.
2008 is the Year the Church Walks in Correction
As a pastor, I have discovered that people enjoy coming to me for advice and they accept it as long as the answer is what they want to hear. We must develop the ministry of receiving the word &quot;no.&quot; To hear quickly, and to be obedient without question makes one usable to God.
Over the years I’ve had many approach me about their call into the ministry. There are those who truly will do whatever God calls them to do, but there are also many who will only answer the call if it involves a platform, podium, microphone, and cameras. There is nothing wrong with being famous. The Bible says that Jesus’ fame spread throughout the country and multitudes came to hear him. Jesus didn’t seek fame, but used it as a tool. Likewise, fame should never be a ministry goal.
In order for the church to be the church, Christians must be obedient to every word and not just to the ones they want to receive. We must go where He tells us to go, or stay where He tells us to stay without regard to fame or fortune. The Blessing will chase you down and catch you, but The Blessing only travels on the street named Obedience.
God’s Word may be served on a table, but it’s not a smorgasbord. There are desserts, but you must also eat the vegetables.
My wife, Loretta, is devoted to prayer. Privately she spends time in prayer, but also hosts several prayer sessions each week. I recently heard someone say that they were not going to prayer because they didn’t get a lot out of prayer meetings. It reminded me of the time that a couple met me in my office to inform me that they were no longer going to work with children because no one appreciated what they were doing.
When did appreciation become the motivation for ministry? When did we start judging prayer by how much we got out of it? Much of the focus has been wrong and needs to be corrected.
We were created to worship Him. When we pray, we pray to the Father. If talking to the Father does not bring satisfaction, then an adjustment needs to be made and it’s not the Father that needs to be adjusted. 2008 is the year the church walks in correction.
2008 is the Year the Church Must Obey Without Hesitation
The church has been commanded to &quot;go ye therefore and make disciples.&quot; Whether or not you feel appreciated while doing it, is irrelevant. It’s a command. Imagine how an army would function during a time of war if each soldier decided himself whether or not he was going to obey the commands of the General on the basis of how appreciated he felt. The war would be lost. That is one of the basic problems that has developed in the church. We must obey our commands without hesitation.
Many times a statement that sounds good, if carried to the extreme, can be harmful. A lady told me once that she couldn’t teach the children because she needed to be sitting in adult church where the pastor put the food on the table. While this is a good concept, the reality is this. If everybody is sitting at the table and nobody is in the kitchen, everyone starves. In order to eat, we must all take our turn in the kitchen.
While in the heart of God, it is true that it’s all about us, in our hearts we should have the attitude that it’s all about Him. The church must have the right perspective and have its priorities in order. Although we receive when we come to God’s house, our hearts should be the heart of a servant and we should come to give worship to God and minister to others.
Many churches are looking for revival within their own building. They have become frustrated over the years trying to obtain it because the real heart of revival is ministering to someone else. The church should overflow into the world instead of attempting to overflow back onto itself over and over. True satisfaction and accomplishment in the heart of a believer is when they see the Word flowing out of themselves and into the lives of hurting people and seeing those hurting lives becoming fruitful and abundant in all things.
2008 is the Year the Church Must Cleanse Itself of the World
2008 is the year for the church to stand in honesty, character, and integrity. In today’s society, I have seen a disturbing trend. People are accustomed to being tantalized, mesmerized, and sensationalized and this has been brought into the church. While I truly believe that worship services should promote excellence in music and teaching and that musicians should practice and rehearse in order to promote excellence in worship, I have noticed that some church services are such choreographed, theatrical, made-for-television performances, that there is little difference between church and the half-time show at the Super Bowl (without the fireworks).
A minister recently indicated to me that he was unable to allow the gifts of the Holy Spirit to operate in his church service because there was no way that it would fit into his television programming.
It’s sad when we allow directors to eliminate the move of the Spirit from our worship services. It’s robbing God of His opportunity to speak intimately with His children. This is the year the church must cleanse itself of the world and worship the Father in spirit and in truth.
When I told a minister at a ministers’ conference that I had sold my airplane, he said, &quot;But what about your image? Don’t you know that not having an airplane will affect the image of your ministry?&quot; We must get over this crazy thinking and realize that ministry is not about the building of our image.
2008 is the Year for the Sleeping Giant to Awake
Sometimes I feel like the church has been lulled into a deep sleep. Twenty years ago there were things we would not allow in our homes that today we are using to babysit our children. But this is the year for the sleeping giant to awake.
It has been estimated that there are over 75 million evangelical Christians in America alone. If we could unite as one body in agreement with the Word of God as our guide, nothing could stop us.
While the world may wax worse and become more deceived, the church should become brighter and brighter until we shine the Gospel into all the world.
2008 is the Time for the Church to Be All That Jesus Prophesied it Would Be
There is so much more that God is speaking in these last moments of the last days. When my grandmother was a teenager, she saw her first automobile. During all of her youth she traveled by way of horse and wagon. Before she passed away, she saw astronauts go into outer space and men walk on the moon. From the creation of man through six thousand years, man traveled with the assistance of animals. In one generation that changed. The scriptures tell us that in the last days knowledge will increase. We are truly in the last days.
The prophetic times spoken by our Lord and Savior, Jesus, are upon us. The time of waiting is behind and the time of action is at hand. It’s time for the church to stand up and be all that Jesus prophesied the church would be.

Messages in this topic (4) 8a. LIVING BY HIS POWER from the book Daily Overcoming Posted by: &quot;Nathaniel &amp; Margaret Williams&quot; nat@hal-pc.org natcmf Thu Oct 25, 2007 11:51 am (PST) BlankOCTOBER 25

LIVING BY HIS POWER

“For though He was crucified through weakness, yet He liveth by the power of God – for we also are weak in Him, but we shall live with Him by the power of God toward you.” – 1 Cor. 13:4

While others focus attention upon self, various methods of self-improvement and final self-conquest, Christ alone laid down the principle, “He that loseth his life for My sake shall find it.”

– Matt. 10:39

Many are familiar with Luke 24:49, “Tarry ye… until ye be endued with power from on high.” The word “endued” meaning TO BE CLOTHED UPON. How we have desired to be clothed upon with power that we might DO exploits. Thoughts of great ministries flood our minds, to heal the sick, raise the dead, amaze the world with our ability to perform miracles, to do, do, do for the Lord. Then the Spirit begins to unfold the deeper truth that it is not in our “doing” but in our “BEING.” We can only be a manifestation of His life according as to how we lay down our own self-life. The ultimate witness is our STATE OF BEING, which is to be HIS LIFE lived through us.

From the human angle the cross looked like defeat, failure, a dismal end to a ministry of miracles. But it was the beginning of the greater and more abundant life. What appeared to be the “weakness of the cross” suddenly turns to be strength, and we see that “the weakness of God is stronger than men.” (1 Cor. 1:25). By His submission to death HE CONQUERED DEATH, as He did “by the grace of God taste death for every man.” (Heb. 2:9). He also “Himself took our infirmities (weaknesses).” (Matt. 8:17). Therefore all of our weaknesses now belong to Him, HE TOOK THEM, and now uses them for a purpose unto victory. “He weakened my strength in the way,” (Ps. 102:23), and then He infused me with His power and life, so that henceforth we might LIVE BY THE POWER OF GOD.

“God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things that are mighty.” (1 Cor. 1:27). One with His Cross we are made weak, yet we shall also become one in His resurrection life and power. Praise God!

a father; and the younger men as brethren; The elder women as mothers; the
younger as sisters, with all purity.
1 TIMOTHY 5:1-2 NEW INTERNATIONAL VERSION. Do not rebuke as older man
harshly, but exhort him as if he were your father. Treat younger men as brothers,
older women as mothers, and younger women as sisters, with absolute purity.

Thank You, Father, that Your people at our church are no longer
children, tossed like ships to and fro. They are enfolded in love, growing up in
every way and on all things into Him, Who is the Head, Christ, the Messiah, the
Anointed One.
Father, You are effectually at work in our teachers~energizing and
creating in them the power and desire~both to will and to work for Your good
pleasure and satisfaction and delight. Father, in the name of Jesus, their power
and ability and sufficiency are from you. It is You Who have qualified them
(making them to be fit, worthy and sufficient as ministers and dispensers of
the new covenant. They are not ministers of the law which kills; but of the
Holy Spirit. which makes us alive.
Father, we rejoice in the Lord over our teachers and commit to undergird
them with our faith and love.We will not judge or criticize them, but speak
excellent and princely things concerning them. The opening of our lips shall
be for right things.
Thank You, Father, that the teachers live in harmony with the other
members of our church, being in full accord and of one harmonious mind and
intention. Each is not merely concerned for their own interests, but each for the
interest of others. Jesus is our example in humility, and our teachers shall
tend~nurture, guard, guide and fold~the flock of God which is their
responsibility, and will be examples of Christian living to the flock, the
congregation.
Thank You, Father, for the performance of your Word in our midst.
IN JESUS' NAME, AMEN!
Always in His love and Spirit, Dennis!

Urgent Prayer
Thursday, October 25, 2007

I'm in over my head.
Psalm 69:1 TM

A woman driving through Texas saw a tornado approaching, so she hid behind her car and watched as it demolished a little house nearby. Running over to what was now just a hole in the ground, she saw a man with his eyes closed. &quot;Are you okay? Is anybody down there with you?&quot; she asked. &quot;No,&quot; he replied, &quot;Just me and God. having an urgent conversation!&quot;

Nothing fuels prayer like real need. In crisis even professed unbelievers will try to pray. Despite our accomplishments we all need God. There are some issues we simply can't resolve on our own. The Psalmist wrote: &quot;At night You give me a song as my prayer to You&quot; (Psalm 42:8 CEV); &quot;When I am in trouble, I pray, knowing You. listen&quot; (Psalm 86:7 CEV). Sometimes your prayers, whether sung or shouted, are midnight cries for divine assistance meant only for God's ears. When you're out of options your faith develops fast, and emergencies become opportunities to experience God's power in a greater way.

So, if you're &quot;in over your head&quot; today, here's a prayer just for you: &quot;Father, it feels like I'm in an impossible situation with no way out. I need to feel Your presence, the encouragement of Your Spirit, and to be reminded that with You all things are possible. Bring the answers of Heaven to my earthly situation. Touch it with Your grace. On the outside things look hopeless, but You're the God who created the earth from nothing and rolled back the Red Sea so Your children could cross over safely. You make the blind see, the lame walk, and the deaf hear. Today I thank You that You're my God, and with You nothing is impossible.&quot;

Messages in this topic (3) 12.1. Today's Scripture Posted by: &quot;April Hunt&quot; pastor_april@yahoo.com pastor_april Thu Oct 25, 2007 4:53 pm (PST) Today's Scripture

Jonah 3: 1-2
Then the Lord spoke to Jonah a second time: “Get up and go to the great city of Nineveh, and deliver the message I have given you.”

Jonah had run away from God but was given a second chance to participate in God's Work. You may feel as though you are disqualified from serving God because of past mistakes. But serving God is not an earned position. No one qualifies for God's service, but God still asks us to carry out His work. You may yet have another chance ; as did Jonah.
Remember God doesn't call the qualified. He qualifies the called!

Thank You Lord for choosing us to do Your Work here on earth. May we humbly represent You to a hurting world. In Jesus' Name, Amen..

God bless you this weekend!
Love in Him,
April

PLEASE KEEP ALL IN THE FIRE AREAS IN CALIFORNIA IN PRAYER.
SO MANY HAVE LOST MUCH AND ARE WITHOUT HOMES. GOD WILL PROVIDE AS WE PRAY FOR ALL IN NEED OF HIS TOUCH AT THIS TIME.
~~
I am still praying about the fires in California, and the drought in Georgia and the Southeast. Jesus said in Luke 10; 19, &quot;Behold, I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy; and nothing shall by any means harm you.&quot; Isa. 54; 17, &quot;No weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper; and every tongue that shall rise against thee (even satan) in judgment thou shalt condemn. This is the heritage of the servants of the Lord and their righteousness is of me, saith the Lord.&quot; Father God in the name above all other names, Jesus Christ of Nazareth, I pray that Your perfect will be done on earth as it is in the heavens, but I am standing firm on Your Word for all Christians that belong to Jesus. Thank You Father God for loving us so much, and we know that Your Word is true and will endure forever even into eternity.

Love, Your daughter Karen

Please pray for all these folks! There are tons of fires out here in California. I live way up north so they aren't affecting me (two hours from Oregon border) but our firefighters are all going down there to help which leaves us all in a very vulnerable position. Please pray for all the firefighters risking life and limb to get this under control. God can put it out with a blink of his eye!

Callie had a phenomenal two weeks. There were no secretions and she was more active and playful than I had ever seen her. They hard part was that she was attached to High Flow (thermal) oxygen which kept her stuck in her crib. They tried to trial her off to regular cool air which would allow her to travel around the hospital with an oxygen cannister. That seemed to trigger a very bad &quot;downswing&quot;. To those of you new to Callie's story, Callie has been plagued by these episodes of horrible pain, retching, eye gouging, constipation, bilious green gi output, eye rolling, and excessive salivation and secretions. No one knows the source of them. She has been in horrid pain. They detected another UTI in her which they will be treating with antibiotics but that is not where the bulk of her discomofort is coming from. Callie's pain doesn't seem to be lessening from the Benadryl/Motrin cocktail we've given that worked in the past, nor does the codeine seem to be working. I asked that they introduce some Ativan temporarily to see if that helps. Right now, she needs pain management until this nasty little episode runs it's course. Please pray for healing and that this pain abate. Noah is okay. Cozy is well in Massachusetts.

Dear friends,

I'm writing to ask for prayers for myself. Lately I have been suffering some extreme anxiety and some depression to go with it. I haven't seen a doctor for this in over a year, and have been dealing with it lately waiting for my new insurance to kick in. It finally has, and I have an appointment with a new psychiatrist 10/25 (this thursday). The doctor I'm going to is in cuyahoga falls, and works in conjunction with my pain management doctor, which gives me hope that the right hand will know what the left hand is doing so to speak, and both doctors can work together to find the best treatment options for me. I know a lot of people that feel psychiatric meds cause more harm then good, but this is the treatment that I have decided to pursue, and I'm just asking that you pray that working together with the doctors that we can find a good treatment plan that will help me, and allow me to resume my life.

Thanks &amp; God Bless!

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I don't know how many of you heard about the pastor of a church in Wellington whose wife was killed and he was shot and is in the hospital. I wondered if it was my sister's pastor. She called me tonight and it was. Their 16 year old son was angry because his parents would not let him get a certain video game because it was too graphic and violent. Apparently, he ran away for three days and when he came back, he shot his mother dead and turned the gun on his dad. When he arrived home, he told his parents to close their eyes, he had a surprise for them. It was then he killed his mother. He then said to his dad, &quot;I'm surprised you closed your eyes and then shot him. According to my sister, he will survive but much of his face was shot away. My sister and brother-in-law are very good friends of these people and it has hit them very hard. It is a small church. I think it is an Assembly of God church and the entire church needs our prayers and please pray for the pastor. It is hard for my sister because in a sense it could have been them because her youngest son has mental problems also. Finely after about 18 years, he was diagnosed as bipolar. They are probably still alive because none of us ever had guns in the house. This is all too close to home. Thanks, Jan

While those issues are of importance, dear Father, I long to be with
you -- to know you, to be able to see you face to face, to honor you

your grace. You paid the price for my sins at incredible cost to

Subject: Prayers for Whitney requested

Greetings in the Name above every name.
We received a call this evening from a very dear friend of ours, Vern Abram. Vern just learned that Whitney, his 28-year-old second cousin has to undergo brain surgery in the morning. She had to be transported from Waco, Texas to a Dallas hospital for a conclusive diagnosis. She and her husband, Seth, have been married only a year and don't have any children yet.
A tumor, the diameter of a baseball, was found in the right frontal lobe of her brain. It is relatively flat but the Doctors don't believe that they will be able to remove the entire tumor without causing more brain damage. But we know the Great Physician who is WELL ABLE to do more than we can ask or imagine.
So please join us in lifting-up Whitney before Our Father. She is even now encircled with Peace and this temporal condition is unto Victory.
Vern Abram is currently working in the Dallas area and you can direct any comments to him at aironetx@msn.com

Thank you for your prayers of Faith.

I was involved with a scammer, and got put in the middle of the mix!!! Now I'm being threatened by law enforcement as well as the individual I received a wire transfer from. BTW, I sent the money on.

If there is an attorney on this list, please contact me. I am just now getting back on track, so I don't have money for a high priced attorney.

I am scheduled for a permanency hearing on getting my son back Tuesday. Please pray this goes well and that I am not in jail unable to go to it!!!

Thank you all for your prayers. God has sustained me, but right now, I don't even feel like living!!!!

Blessings in Christ, Marian

Brothers and Sisters, please join me in prayer for this lady I have gotten to know. She is from Ohio and her name is Misty. She had breast cancer and was clear for 3 years, and then it metastasized in her lungs. Please pray for her healing and that God give her and the family strength to endure this trial.

Subject: Prayer for Judy

I would like to request prayer for one of my sisters, Judy. She is having problems with her feet. She tried to call a podiatrist yesterday because she couldn't even walk on her feet but to no avail. Some reasons all of the doctors were out. Please pray for her feet as well as the rest of her body. Pray for her spiritually, physically, mentally, emotionally, socially, financially and legally.

Also, remember Ken and Tammy to be touched.

Thanks and God bless---Gwen

Rejoice and be glad in this day; for it is the day that the Lord has made. www.harvesttimechurchofgod.net

Please pray for my sister-in-law's uncle. This is the uncle who had a work injury September 4th to his leg. He was put back in the hospital @ Hermann on Saturday due to fever and redness in his leg. They will be having to re-do his surgery today. They have to replace the artery they put in his leg. He has infection I assume in the tissue, but not in the blood. Therefore his leg is swollen, red and with fever. Please be in prayer for him because this has taken an emotional toll on him to have to be going thru this again.

Also, please pray for my dad. He will be having a fibrillator put in on Wed. Oct. 31.

Thanks. Sis. Debby Chennault

Our hearts go out to John in his suffering. We pray that the Lord will lift this pain and his limitations when His loving wisdom allows with the hope that he and Noralyn will be able to be with family at Thanksgiving.
