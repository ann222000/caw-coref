Pleast post feedback here. I'm not allowed to get email on this account.

I'm a receptionist at a community mental health center and I'm in a bit
of a jam. I overheard a patient arguing with a nurse about paging her
doctor. Apparently she needed her psychiatrist to phone in her
prescription meds so she can pick them up on the same day. The nurse
had just paged the doctor and apparently there was a mixup and the
patient wanted the doctor to phone in for another drug she's on. For
some reason the nurse did not want to do this, and I overheard her
almost yelling at the patient that she had just paged him and the doctor
would be upset to be disturbed again. The patient, who apparently is
one of the &quot;difficult&quot; ones, didn't care and wanted the doctor paged and
told to call in for the right medicine. They went back and forth for a
while, and finally the nurse agreed to page the doctor to correct the
mistake. I thought that would be the end of it, but I just found out
the nurse never paged the doctor, but left a voice message instead. The
doctor didn't get the message until the next day so the patient never
got her meds. Now there is an incident report filed and the nurse is
saying she never told the patient she was going to page the doctor, but
offered only to leave a voice message. The patient was without one of
her meds for only a day but she's making a big deal over it.

I could have just said I didn't hear anything and not get involved, but
I did tell the patient to calm down because the nurse is paging the
doctor like she wanted. If I deny saying anything to the patient, the
health center will most likely side with the nurse and things will blow
over. However, I'm concerned that if I do that, and the patient is able
to find some other way to prove her version of the story, I'll probably
be fired. But if I verify the patient's claim that the nurse promised
the page the doctor, the nurse will probably get fired. Since the nurse
and the supervisor are pretty close, I'm afraif she'll make it very hard
for me to continue working there.

I really don't want to get sucked into this, but it looks like I can't
avoid it. The patient is now claiming she was carrying a tape recorder
and recorded the arguement with the nurse. I'm not sure if this is true
or just a bluff. I really don't know. Management is investigating her
allegations and I'm sure they'll call me in for questionining.

It sounds like I should just quit, because no matter what happens with
the investigation, I'll be on someone's bad side once it's over.

Anyone been in a similar situation?

Chances are you'll never be asked. Since the patient says she has the whole
thing on tape, your employers will likely insist that she produce the tape
and substantiate her allegations herself. If she can't, the whole thing will
die at that point.

Yo, Dude:

Get ahold of yourself. The nurse lied to a patient and a psychiatric
patient at that. Psychiatric patients are at times difficult but that's why
they need help. Furthermore, there is no greater aspect of care for a psych
patient than to be able to trust health care providers. This nurse blew it
not only for herself but other health care professionals who follow behind
her.

What job is worth compromising your values, especially at the expense of a
patient?

As a patient, I would want you to tell the truth and for the nurse to be fired.

If you can't trust your doctor or nurse, who can you trust?

Do not quit your job. Tell the truth as you heard it, and nothing
more than they ask. Tell them your interrogation must be
confidential. Missing even one day of meds can have terrible
ramifications for patients.
If the nurse is too afraid to call the doctor, perhaps she shouldn't
be working there.
This is a Q/A issue which should be used for quality improvement, not
firing purposes. It sounds as though the patient also needs
education concerning the time frame needed for renewing a
prescription.
Good luck.

I'm also thinking that perhaps you don't know the whole story, so it's
probably best to be as honest and non-judgemental in your report of
events as you can be. Ther could be a whole load of contextual issues
you are missing in this situation.

I would be careful of using such words as &quot;abuse&quot; as well. It sounds
to me like the nurse didn't respond to this situation in quite the
best way possible, but his/her actions are hardly what I would call
abuse.

You know, I found the original post a bit theatrical and subjective for my
taste and felt a bit wary of the intent.

Now I read your interpretation of &quot;For some reason the nurse did not want to
do this, and I overheard her
almost yelling at the patient ...&quot; as 'screaming at someone who has
legimate concerns&quot;.

Why did you make up the 'screaming' part and how do you come to the
assessment of whether or not the patient's concerns were legitimate?

Perhaps they were ...perhaps not. I don't know and unless you were there,
neither do you ...YET, you have reached conclusions and even upped the ante
on the supposed behavior based on ...what?

You see why I cautioned about objectivity? If the original poster felt the
behavior was abusive or in some other way inappropriate, then by all means,
I encourage them to calmly and objectively tell what they observed to
whoever is appropriate. The original post did not have that flavor ...nor
did your response.

Quite frankly, the tone of the original post was such that I'm curious about
the receptionist's experience and whether or not there had been any
previous...significant interactions with the nurse mentioned. In short (too
late, eh?) I'd like to know a lot more about what happened before we take
the nurse out back and kick the shit out of her.

Addendum: It seemed apparent to me by the statement ... &quot;I overheard a
patient arguing with a nurse about paging her
doctor. Apparently she needed her psychiatrist to phone in her prescription
meds so she can pick them up on the same day.&quot;

...that the patient was an outpatient who wanted the script called in to the
drug store.

Perhaps I am incorrect in this, but you (once again) drama it up with
&quot;Screaming at someone who has legitimate concerns and who doesn't have the
option of simply walking away (most psych. units have locked doors)&quot;.

Drama Queen!

&gt;&gt; Screaming at someone who has legitimate concerns and who doesn't have
the
&gt;&gt; option of simply walking away (most psych. units have locked doors) has
to
&gt;&gt; be considered abuse. If someone witnessed this they are entirely correct
&gt; in
&gt;&gt; wanting the incident investigated.

I cannot attest to what Mike is saying but a couple of posters did make a
good point about presenting an emotional story.

When I am dealing with either a nurse or a patient who is not in immediate
danger, I always suggest waiting a day or two before they put their account
of activity into writing. A 'just the facts, ma'am' approach eliminates the
recipient of the information from getting the idea that personal likes or
dislikes has anything to do with the original complaint.

As a receptionist in an outpatient clinic, the OP should not present
clinical judgments. Rather, she should present the facts and let others
determine if the behavior was clinically warranted. However, it seems from
the OP that the nurse lied to the patient about paging the doc and instead
left a voice message which was not retrieved until the following day. Lying
to a patient is never acceptable.

Think about how you'd feel if it were a member of your family -- or you,
someday -- as a mental patient. One day without meds can make a huge
difference in some patients.

If you don't tell the truth, you'd better stay with Nurse Ratched for the
rest
of your career. Most health professionals wouldn't want their reputations
sullied to protect a negligent nurse.

: Pleast post feedback here. I'm not allowed to get email on this account.

My mother was a psych RN for years. She once told me a similar
story about the mental hospital where she worked.

Part of the reason why bad apple staff get away with such lies is because
they know psych pts are viewed as &quot;crazy&quot; anyway. These Pts are
vulnerable, and some staff exploit that fact.

But when, as Mom told me once, you have the same RN on duty when things
&quot;go missing&quot; 14 x in a row (always on *their* shift/patient load), it gets
pretty hard to deny that something is wrong.
