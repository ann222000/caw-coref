ENDTIME BIBLE STUDY

The Prophetic Trigger of God's Timeline

For hundreds of years, it has been common knowledge within the Church,
that mankind's life span upon this earth would be 6,000 years. This was
gleaned from Exodus 20:9-10, which says: &quot;Six days shalt thou
labor...But the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God.&quot; Like
many things in the Scriptures, it had a deeper meaning beyond what was
being conveyed about their calendar, which was later revealed in 2 Peter
3:8 - &quot;But, beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day is
with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.&quot;

In 1650, using these Scriptures, Archbishop Jacob Ussher of Armagh in
Ireland, attempted to calculate when the Creation took place by using
chronological information from the Bible and counting backward from the
date of the birth of Christ. At that time, it was believed that Christ
was born in 4 BC (some calculations had indicated that it may have been
as late as 1 BC or as early as 6 BC; however, recent evidence have
determined it to be 3 BC), so Ussher theorized that the Creation took
place in 4004 BC, and the passing of four &quot;days&quot; (two thousand years
before the law, and two thousand years after the law) took us to
Christ's birth in 4 BC, so two more &quot;days&quot; would end the six &quot;days&quot; at
1996. The Sabbath, or the seventh &quot;day,&quot; is the Millennium, or the
thousand-year reign of Jesus Christ upon the Earth, which is referred to
in the 20th chapter of Revelation.

An apocryphal book known as the Epistle of Barnabas, which early church
leaders such as Origen and Jerome believed had been written by the first
recruit of the Apostle Paul, Barnabas said: &quot;And God made in six days
the works of His hands; and He finished them on the seventh day, and
rested on the seventh day and sanctified it. Consider, my children, what
that signifies, He finished them in six days. The meaning of it is this:
that in six thousand years the Lord God will bring all things to an end.
For with him, one day is a thousand years; as Himself testifieth,
saying, behold this day shall be as a thousand years. Therefore
children, in six days, that is, in six thousand years, shall all things
be accomplished. And what is it that He saith, and He rested the seventh
day; He meaneth this; that when his Son shall come, and abolish the
season of the wicked one, and judge the ungodly; and shall change the
sun and the moon, and the stars, then He shall gloriously rest in that
seventh day.&quot;

Irenaeus, an early church leader, while writing in 150 AD about the
book of Genesis in his book _Against Heresies_ said: &quot;This is an account
of the things formerly created, as also it is a prophecy of what is to
come. For the day of the Lord is as a thousand years; and in six days
created things were completed; it is evident, therefore, that they will
come to an end at the sixth thousand years.&quot; Around 300 AD, in the
writings of Christian scholar Lactantius, he says: &quot;Because all the
works of God were finished in six days, it is necessary that the world
should remain in this state six ages, that is six thousand years.
Because having finished the works He rested on the seventh day and
blessed it; it is necessary that at the end of the sixth thousandth year
all the wickedness should be abolished out of the earth and justice
should reign a thousand years.&quot; Other writers during the early Christian
era also reflected this premise.

Some researchers have sought to adjust the calculations of this theory.
The Jewish calendar conformed to the solar year, which contained 360
days, or 12 months of 30 days. In 1583, the Gregorian calendar was
adopted, which added an extra 5.25 days to that year. If you add
2,160,000 days (6,000 years X 360 days) to 2,173.50 days (414 years of
5.25 days), you get 2,162,173.50 days, which divided by the Jewish year
of 360 days, would make the end of the sixth day, the year 2002. When
you deduct from that figure, the seven year period which is commonly
referred to as the Tribulation period, that leaves us with the year of
1995 as the culmination of the efforts to establish a New World Order.

There is another theory, which has to do with the amount of time that
the Jewish race would be dispersed across the Earth. The Jews were in
bondage in Egypt for 430 years, and later for 70 years in
Babylon. These dates were foretold. The purpose of the prophecy
which is given in Ezekiel 4:1-8 was to show how long the Jews would be
scattered as a people. Other Scriptures deal with the extent of the
dispersal: Deut. 28:25, Deut. 28:64, Jer. 24:9, and Amos 9:9. Adding the
390 and 40 years, gives you 430 years. Leviticus 26:18 says: &quot;And if ye
will not yet for all this hearken unto me, then I will punish you seven
times more for your sins.&quot; From 430, subtract the 70 years they were
punished in Babylon, and what God was telling Moses, was that the
Jewish people would be dispersed for 2,520 years (360 years X 7).

Now here is where it gets a little tricky. Nebuchadnezaar's first
return of his Jewish captives was in 536 BC, and the final return was in
516 BC. Again, using the adjustment for the two calendars, and using the
earliest date of 536 BC, we get these calculations: 907,200 days (2520
years X 360 days) plus 2,110.50 days (402 years X 5.25 days) is
909,310.50 days divided by 360 days of the Jewish calendar is 2525.86
years, or the year 1990. But then, the latter date of 516 BC, would give
us the year 2010.

The Bible also says that the events of the end times would not take
place until all of the Jews returned to their homeland, and this return
is referred to in: Isa. 5:26, Isa. 11:11-12, Isa. 43:5-6, Jer. 16:15,
Jer. 30:3, Ez. 34:11-13, Ez. 36:24, and Zech. 10:8. This return of God's
chosen people, only refers to pure, full-blooded Jews (Gen. 6:1-4, Ezra
10:2-18, Neh. 13:27, Jude 1:7). In 1800, Palestine had a
population of 150 Jews; 1827- 1,500 Jews; 1850- 8,000; 1910- 41,000;
1914- 100,000; 1930- 170,000; 1935- 300,000; 1939- 450,000; 1948-
650,000; 1953- 1,300,000; 1962- 2,000,000; 1970- 2,500,000. Now there
are overy four million Jews in Israel which have been gathered up
from over 102 different nations.

A gentleman by the name of Joe Marler has proposed a theory based on
Daniel 9:25-26 which says: &quot;Know therefore and understand, that from the
going forth of the commandment to restore and build Jerusalem unto the
Messiah the Prince shall be seven weeks, and three score and two weeks:
the street shall be built again, and the wall, even in troublous times.
And after threescore and two weeks shall Messiah be cut off...&quot; The
Hebrew word for &quot;week&quot; is &quot;shabula&quot; which means &quot;seven,&quot; which means
that a &quot;week&quot; is actually 7 &quot;weeks&quot; of years, or 49 years, which is
known as the Jubilee cycle (Lev. 25:8: &quot;And thou shalt number seven
sabbaths of years unto thee, seven times seven years; and the space of
the seven sabbaths of years shall be unto thee forty and nine years&quot;).

The 62 weeks began when the city of Jerusalem, and its Temple,
which was destroyed in 586 BC, were rebuilt. Three such decrees were
given. The first came during the first year of the reign of Cyrus (King
of Persia, 536-527 BC), who ruled for nine years, after which his son
Cambyses (527-520 BC) took over, and all the work on the Temple was
stopped for seven years. The second decree was made by Darius I, in the
second year of his 35-year reign (520-485 BC). Construction resumed on
the Temple in 520 under Zerubbabel, the Persian governor, and was
completed between 516-514 BC. Then Xerxes reigned 21 years (485-464 BC).
Artaxerxes ruled 40 years (464-424 BC), and during his seventh year, in
457 BC, he decreed that Jerusalem be restored. Nehemiah, the
cupbearer to Artaxerxes, was sent to Jerusalem in 444 BC to complete
the work on the walls of the city to fortify it. Thus the period of 62
weeks represents 434 years, which added to 444 BC, indicates the date of
10 BC, which is close to the time of the birth of Christ.

Marler's research somehow led him to the period of 440-438 BC, and
adding 434 years to 438 BC led to 4 BC, which is closer to the actual
date of the birth of Jesus. Marler believes that the other seven &quot;weeks&quot;
or 49 years apply to the second coming of Jesus. Rather than using the
date of May 14, 1948, when Israel officially became an
independent country, he used the date of November 29, 1947, when the
United Nations voted 33-13 to approve a Jewish homeland. Adding 49 years
indicated a date of November 29, 1996, as the end of man's rule on
this Earth. By counting back 31/2 years, he theorized that the period
known as the Tribulation would begin May 29, 1993. The irony here,
is a story that was reported on the news on May 19, 1993. Big Ben, the
renowned tower clock famous for its accuracy, which was installed in
1859 at the eastern end of the Houses of Parliament in London, had
mysteriously stopped running. Would the most recognized time piece in
the world stopped through divine means to signal the beginning of the end?

There are also those researchers who have chosen to totally base all of
their calculations on the premise of 360 days indicating a Biblical
year. For instance, in Hosea 6:1-2 it says: &quot;Come, and let us return
unto the Lord: for he hath torn, and he will heal us; he hath smitten,
and he will bind us up. After two days will he revive us: in the third
day he will raise us up, and we shall live in his sight.&quot; From the
initiation of Christ's ministry, in the fall of 28 AD, and adding two
&quot;days&quot; (2 years X 360 days) would give us 720,000 days, which adjusted
to our calendar by dividing into that 365.25 results in 1971.25 years,
which added to 28.75, takes us to the year 2000.

Another one, has to do with the cleansing of the Temple. In 168 BC,
the Syrian King Antiochus IV Epiphanes attacked Israel, and
sacrificed a pig to Zeus on the Temple altar, an event that is
referred to as the Abomination of Desolation. The period till cleansing,
according to Daniel 8:14, was 2,300 days, which some scholars feel
refers to 2,300 morning and evening rituals, or 1,150 days (3 years, 2
months and 10 days), which seemingly points to the ritual cleansing
performed by Judas Maccabaeus three years later, after the success of
the Hasmonean revolt. However, according to the book of the Maccabees,
the Temple was cleansed in 1,080 days.

To make matters worse, while the King James version states 2,300 days
for this period, the Greek Septuagint, which was used during the time of
Christ, says 2,400 days. In his 1754 book _Dissertations on the
Prophecies_, Bishop Thomas Newton wrote about the existence of a third
manuscript of the book of Daniel, which was mentioned in a Commentary of
Jerome, the early church leader. This manuscript gives the figure of
2,200 days. Since this figure can not be applied literally to the events
of that time, it is believed that the figure should be considered as
years. This assumption is based upon Ezekiel 4:6, which says: &quot;I have
appointed thee each day for a year.&quot;; and Numbers 14:31, which talks
of &quot;each day for a year.&quot; If the figure of 2,200 &quot;days&quot; is used, the
following calculation is then applied: 2,200 years X 360 days = 792,000
days, which adjusted for our calendar year of 365.25, results in 2,168
years. When this figure is added to 168 BC, it leads us to the year 2000.

Let me throw one more at you, which deals with the Times of the
Gentiles. This phrase stems from a statement by Jesus in Luke 21:24:
&quot;...and Jerusalem shall be trodden down of the Gentiles, until the
times of the Gentiles be fulfilled.&quot; This refers to a period which
began in 606 BC when the Babylonians conquered Jerusalem. In Daniel
4:23, according to Nebuchadnezzar's vision (who is represented by a
tree, as men sometimes were: Psalms 1:3, Psalms 37:35, Ez. 31:3), &quot;seven
times&quot; were to pass over him. Revelation 11:2-3 (&quot;42 months&quot; X 30= 1,260
days), 12:6 (&quot;a thousand two hundred and threescore days&quot; or 1,260
days), 12:14 (&quot;a time, and times, and half a time&quot; or 360 + 720 + 180=
1,260 days) indicates that a &quot;time&quot; is 360 days, which means that seven
&quot;times&quot; would be 2,520 &quot;days&quot; or years (on top of referring to the seven
years God struck him down with a period of insanity to show his power).

The calculation would go like this: 2,520 years X 360 days = 907,200
days, which adjusted to our calendar year of 365.25 days, results in
2,483.78 years. When this figure is added to 606 BC, it leads us to the
year 1878, which is believed to be the end of &quot;the times of the
Gentiles.&quot; Now comes an interesting proposal. When Jesus spoke of the
way things were in the &quot;days of Noah,&quot; when God gave mankind an
additional 120 years (Gen. 6:3) to repent, before he sent the flood;
this period has been added to the year 1878 (of course in the adjusted
form of 118.28 of our calendar years), which indicates the year of 1997
as the end of &quot;the times of the Gentiles&quot; and the beginning of the
judgment period known as the Tribulation, which when you add this 31/2
years, leads us to the year 2000.

All of these calculations can be somewhat correlated to the six &quot;day&quot;
theory, in that it indicates a time frame for events within this 6,000
year period. Jesus was very specific when He spoke about the signs of
His return, and He exhorted His disciples to watch, and pray. Because of
the symbolism, type and anti-types, and dual prophecies used in the
Bible, was there something that would signal the end of time as we got
closer to the end of the six &quot;days&quot; or 6,000 years? In Luke 21:25, Jesus
talked about the &quot;signs...upon the earth distress of nations, with
perplexity...&quot;

There was a period in our history when a sequence of events occurred
which seemed to set the stage for the fulfillment of Bible prophecy.
Lets look at the events which happened during the three year period of
1945 - 1948.

On June 26, 1945, at a San Francisco conference, 50
nations met to adopt the United Nations charter. The UN General
Assembly held their first meeting in London on January 10, 1946.
A UFO was reported to have crashed in Roswell, New Mexico
on July 4, 1947.
On November 29, 1947, the UN voted to approve a Jewish
homeland, and on May 14, 1948, Israel became a nation.
It has been long accepted that the Dead Sea Scrolls were
discovered in 1947, but according to Randall Price in his book
_Secrets of the Dead Sea Scrolls_ he found out that they could
have actually been discovered as early as 1936. However, 1947 was
time when their existence was revealed.
The World Council of Churches was established on August 23, 1948.

Just as we are able to interpret prophecy, and determine the signs of
the times- so has Satan. He knew the time that Israel would
prophetically be resurrected as a nation, and he had to make sure his
plans would be in place, so, when the time came, he would be able to
deceive the world into accepting the Antichrist as the messiah.

Lets look at the events surrounding Israel becoming a nation. The
establishment of the United Nations would herald the move toward
one-world government. A recent expose' has shown that there was a UFO
crash at Roswell, and among the technology gleaned from it was
integrated circuit chips, fiber optics, and lasers. The treasure of
ancient documents found at Qumran has yielded copies of nearly every
Old Testament book, however, it has also turned up documents from a
Jewish sect known as the Essenes. As these Dead Sea Scrolls were
translated in secret, the scholars behind them began to use them to
undermine the divinity Jesus, by saying that the Essenes were the true
originators of what became known as Christianity. And the World Council
of Churches would begin the move toward ecumenicalism that is seeking to
bring all the world's religions together into one unified body.

Now lets put these events in perspective with Bible prophecy.

Jesus said in Matthew 24:34 - &quot;Verily I say unto you, This generation
shall not pass, till all these things be fulfilled.&quot; Jesus was speaking
to his disciples concerning the last days, and had just told them about
the parable of the fig tree. Some Bible scholars have interpreted
Ezekiel 36:8 to mean that the fig tree represented the nation of
Israel. So it is believed that Jesus was referring to the generation
that would be alive when Israel became a nation on May 14, 1948. Job
42:16 refers to a generation as being 35 years, while Webster's
Dictionary indicates that it is forty years. The figure of 40 years is
echoed in Hebrews 3:9-10 which says: &quot;When your fathers tempted me,
proved me, and saw my works forty years. Wherefore I was grieved with
that generation...&quot; Adding 40 years to 1948 would give us the year 1988,
which puts us in the general area of the above calculation.

But let me add another wrinkle to this theory. It is no secret that
Bible prophecy, and the understanding of it, revolves around Israel.
Israel is the only nation that is referred to in the masculine
gender. According to Jewish custom, a male is labeled under the
following age categories: child (1-12), young man (13-19), warrior
(20-29), and mature man (30-50, who is able to officiate in the
Temple). The age of 50 is the age of retirement (and Jubilee). So if
you interpret this as being symbolic and add 50 years to 1948, you get
the year 1998, which is more closely aligned with the other calculations.

I think you'll agree that this sequence of events was unprecedented,
and that it was no coincidence that these major events happened in such
a short period of time. This is why I believe, that collectively, they
represent the prophetic trigger that has set into motion the time which
has come to be known as the &quot;last days.&quot; These events began the toppling
those prophetic dominoes that will lead to the fulfillment of all
things, and the culmination of the events foretold in the books of
Daniel, Ezekiel, and Revelation.

Though Jesus said in Matthew 24:36 &quot;... of that day and hour knoweth no
man,&quot; the prophetic outline He gave indicated the signs we are to look
for, and He replied in 24:33 that &quot;when ye shall see all these things,
know that it is near...&quot; We are seeing the signs. The end is near. Make
sure that your heart is right with God. Watch, and pray.

&quot;On Nov. 10, 2000, the American-Jewish editor in chief of the Kansas
City Jewish Chronicle, Debbie Ducro, published an impassioned 1,150
word article from another Jew decrying Israeli atrocities against the
Palestinians. The writer, Judith Stone, even used the term Israeli
Shoah, to draw allusion to Hitler's genocidal war against the Jews.
Ducro was fired on Nov. 11.&quot;
