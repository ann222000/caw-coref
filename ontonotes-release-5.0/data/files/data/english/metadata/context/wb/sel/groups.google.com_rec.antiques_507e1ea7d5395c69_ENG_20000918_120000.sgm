I bought the following smoke stand (OK, I don't know if that's one word
or two.) a month ago and have learned a lot about it since then.
Although bronze in color, it's actuall made of a ferrous? metal. (a
magnet sticks to it) so, wrought iron I'm assuming, with a heavy bronze
colored finish. My first impression was definitely deco. But the lower
part, (It's original, I saw another just like it) looks more art
nouveau. The rose in the center, and near the top still have traces of
red and green polichrome? paint, as does the deeper ares of the base.

The company that made it (Veroni) is an art metal furniture division of
the Chicago Metal foundry, which made trains for the Chicago railway. I
found a copy on the internet of a catalog about the Veroni metal art
furniture co, that was dated 1927.

My questions are, is this art deco or art nouveau, and if there was a
transitional period, where would this be between 1890-1930's? I can't
seem to find out when Veroni first began, How early or late might this
be? Also, the glass insert I believe is original.
It fits nicely all the the way to the metal cigarette and pipe rests.
The other one I saw had an ashtray with rests and it looked totally
wrong. The glass has an unusual faint amber tinge to it, but only when
the light hits it in certain places. Is there a name for this type of
glass?
Would this help in dating it? Thanks for your opinions in advance.

Mari,
you've found out who made it. You've also found a likely date of
manufacture within 40 years; I doubt you'll find the day of the
month and year it was made. It has an ashtray that sounds like
it's made of pale amber glass. I'm not sure what else is important
about this piece, but perhaps you can contact this company -
they seem to be the last remnants of the company that produced
this piece.

But you might want to re-look at that piece of paper - it might be
better to inquire about Verona, rather than Veroni.

Kris, I
apologize for the mispellings, as I said, I researched it over a month
ago and I trusted mmory to at least let the group know I had donemy
homework. I really appreciate your bringing the site up for me.

My original intent of discussion however, isn't so much as
'pinpointing the date, as deciding if this is nouvous (bottom) Deco
(top) or dreco (transitinal). Based on general opinion, I thought I
might narrow the void by 10 years or so. I thought sharing some of the
background information would be of interest to others who might have
items (apparently a very prolific Co. ) made by VeronA. The stuff lasts
forever!

Again, thanks for finding the site for me again, but tell me, What would
YOU call the style?
Oh, and I know dreco isn't a word. but it should be.:-)

Too funny. I saw this exact smoking stand at an auction in Nazareth,
Pa., on Saturday. In fact, you can still see the listing in their
catalog at  www.dottaauctions.com . Twas cited as:
C. I. ASHTRAY STAND W/GREY- HOUND HANDLE.

Hi David,

Actually many items were made in the Deco style well before the Exposition, the
original Exposition was put on hold by World War I.

Christopher Dresser is regarded by some as the &quot;father&quot; of Art Deco. Some of
his designs from the 1870s/1880s- all created for mass production - were so
far ahead of their time, they would not look out of place today on the set
for Star Trek.

What's in a name? A 1880 plated toast rack by &quot;anyone&quot; might fetch twenty
quid. A Christopher Dresser Design for Hukin &amp; Heath will set you back two
hundred. About the same added value ratio as a Paul Storr piece of silver.

Convention sets the Deco period as from the 1925 Exposition, right up to the
1950s or even &quot;space age&quot; 1960s items. Art Nouveau ran from c.1890 - 1905 in
the UK. Mike can tell you more about the high-quality reproductions he saw
at the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum exhibition he visited in May this year.

Hi Jon,

The Deco style hit it's peak at different times in Europe and North
America, over here it didn't reach popular acceptance until the mid
1930's. When you look at film classics of the time, movies like the Thin
Man series, filmed from 1934 to 1947 , are just stuffed with Deco
designs during the the thirties and disappear in the later1940's films.
For anyone interested in styles of the past old photo's and films are a
great way to have a peek at the past.

"/> Also old books. I am one of those people who can not resist the 5 for
a $1.00 paper backs at flea markets so I just finished reading a
detective story published in the 1940's. the fascinating thing was
that everybody smoked! Much of the descriptive action in the book
revolved around the buying, lighting, smoking and sharing of
cigarettes. It was a revolation that societies attitude had really
changed so much.

Clarice Cliff was producing her best and most original work in the mid to

&gt;Dear Jon, this is hardly the same as declaring Art Deco to have been a
&gt;period within its own right, or even referring to the fashionable style
&gt;as the, &quot;Deco period.&quot; Do we declare Victorian to a period? perhaps the
&gt;'barley-twisty oak period?' or the 'big ugly sideboard period?' Indeed,
&gt;do we by &quot;convention&quot; even refer to the &quot;Arts and Craft period&quot;, or the
&gt;&quot;Art Nouveau period?&quot;

&gt;Are you trolling, Jon? You know perfectly well what I mean, as how we
&gt;NORMALLY use and apply the term period within the context.

&gt;Art Deco was but a chic style within a much bigger and more dominant
&gt;aesthetic and at the time of a more radical and far reaching movement.
&gt;Deco IMO, was a mere blip within that much bigger time frame. Should
&gt;this &quot;bigger&quot; time frame eventually be declared by &quot;convention&quot; to have
&gt;been a specific 'period', IMO, we will have to wait for the passing of
&gt;time itself and the perspective of experience.

&gt;Now where you personally place, or far you extend the date of the Deco
&gt;style is a matter for you. For me, it's much like any other style, when
&gt;the style wanders so far from its purist values and from its original
&gt;honesty, then for me, it ceases to hold any interest, either in the
&gt;historical context or in the pure aesthetic.

&gt;Doesn't mean I'll stop punting it for money, but it is what it is, or it
&gt;has become what it is. I let the others keep up the pretence.

&gt;IMO, by the early-mid 30s, Deco had become boring, no longer
&gt;spontaneous, sincere or original, by the early War years, as a &quot;new&quot;
&gt;style, a new aesthetic, it was dead in the water. After the death of a
&gt;style we can only have the inevitable, the regurgitated revival, and the
&gt;big YAWN. ;)

&gt;So what?

&gt;Art Deco was the fashionable sanitized face of Modernism .. so what?

&gt;Its sources go back to the years after 1905 when designers in France
&gt;reacted against the curvilinearity and insubstantiality of much Art
&gt;Nouveau. By 1910 Art Nouveau was viewed as &quot;old fashion&quot; dead in the
&gt;water, by then Modernism and a new Style had taken a racial hold - I am
&gt;well aware Mr. Bottomley when the term Art Deco was coined.

&gt;Were you just quoting dates? or suggesting a style for the ash tray stand?

"/> Actually, Ronnie, people do refer to the Victorian period or Victorian Era and
that conjures up certain ideas of decorating - gnerally dark, heavy with masses
of fabric and bric a brac everywhere. And even though Art Deco is only a
sub-element of a larger decorative arts movement, the name has now become
synonomous with that particular style. Actually, the term Art Deco wasn't even
used until around the 60s when the style, as you mentioned, became popular
again and was regurgitated. It is easily recognized by its sleek simplicity of
line and form and highly stylized motifs which allows most people with little
education as to various styles and periods to at least recognize this style and
appear somewhat knowledgeable. I see it as like the Porche (pronounced
Por-sha. The word is German and any time the letter &quot;e&quot; appears at the end of
a German word, it is always pronounced). At least in this country, almost
everyone calls it a &quot;Porsh&quot;. Unfortunately, when the majority of a population
are incorrect, eventually it becomes the accepted standard. So it goes with
Art Deco. So many magazines have extolled &quot;The Art Deco Period&quot; and &quot;The Art
Deco Style&quot;, it is now seen as something that stood alone in its own right.

&gt;Yea Ashley, but this is all retro revisionist codswallop.

&gt;I find it rip roaring side splitting hilarious when I hear folk talk
&gt;about the elegant Art Deco of the latter years of 1930s and Art Deco of
&gt;the 1940s.

&gt;I don't know about the USA, but just in case it has slipped some folk's
&gt;minds. Europe wasn't producing any decorative arts during the last years
&gt;of the 1930s nor, for the most part, during the 1940s decade. UK
&gt;government restrictions, in relationship to some decorative arts, still
&gt;prevailed even into the early 1950s. In the UK restrictions regarding
&gt;the production of decorative arts came into force from 1937 onwards. In
&gt;case some of you folks had forgotten, Europe was in mayhem during the
&gt;late 30s and 40s, over run by Mr Jackboot.

&gt; ... yea the chic bohemian 1940s, gives a break. I think the only thing
&gt;inventive, new and imaginative coming out of Europe during the 40s was
&gt;by Albert Speer.

&gt;From the late 50s, early 60s we moved from Modernism, up until then the
&gt;single most driving force, into Post-modernism, regurgitated Deco and
&gt;codswallop.

Try applying the same logic to &quot;Regency&quot; and see what you come up with:

Neo-classical?
Egyptian?
1810 - 1830?
Regency Period?
Regency Style?

I agree with the widespread influence of Dresser and his work is currently
being re-evaluated.

Significantly we are now beyond the magic 1830s dateline so loved by
&quot;antique&quot; purists and the passage of time and common usage (as quoted by
Ashley) will colour most thinking, fuelled by the media of the day.

I was pleased to note that your commercial instincts have not completely
deserted you ;~))

style, decry its devaluation in quality terms after about 1932, but if you
are in business, the first requirement is to pay the rent. Unfortunately
only Andy Warhol and Tesco's make money out of baked beans.

Referring back to you &quot;Neo-classical&quot; question

... neoclassicism related to a revival of a classical style or treatment
in art, literature, music, etc., etc., Neoclassicism had a theory, a
doctrine and an ideology. Neoclassicism was not confined to Britain alone
and the parochial, it's influence extended into all Western civilization as
a whole, and indeed into South, Central and Latin America, and many other
countries. Now none of this could really be applied or attributed to your
so called &quot;Regency Period&quot; .... chalk and cheese.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Regency Style?

"/> Decorative arts produced during the regency of George, prince of Wales, and
the opening years of the 19th century as well as his entire reign as King
George IV of England, ending (the purist) in 1830.

Architects John Nash, Henry Holland, Charles H. Tatham, and Thomas Hope
were the principal arbiters of Regency taste. Hope, Thomas Sheraton and
George Smith published designs for Regency furniture.

&gt;(As I said in my previous post) I would need to check out the dates of
&gt;the War time Act, but as this would mean rummaging in the loft looking
&gt;for a couple of dusty old books, I'll just go with your suggested date.

&gt;However, something in the back of my mind suggests that the &quot;Defence of
&gt;the Realm Act&quot; applied during the First World War. An act which was
&gt;brought about by the 1914 Liberal Government of Herbert Asquith. (??)

&gt;And the (D.O.R.A) act was later replaced by the 1920 Emergency Powers
&gt;Act, which gave the sovereign power to declare an emergency by
&gt;proclamation.

&gt;Anyways, I believe such (emergency) restrictions are declared and
&gt;administrated by ''Order In Council' - but please excuse me if some of
&gt;the above information isn't totally accurate as I'm digging deep and
&gt;relying on memory alone. I must admit, not my best time frame in
&gt;history.

"/> http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/FWWdora.htm:

On 8th August 1914, the House of Commons passed the Defence of the Realm Act
(DORA) without debate. The legislation gave the government executive powers to
suppress published criticism, imprison without trial and to commandeer economic
resources for the war effort.

During the war publishing information that was calculated to be indirectly or directly
of use to the enemy became an offence and accordingly punishable in a court of law.
This included any description of war and any news that was likely to cause any conflict
between the public and military authorities.

In August 1914 the British government established the War Office Press Bureau under
F. E. Smith. The idea was this organisation would censor news and telegraphic reports
from the British Army and then issue it to the press. Lord Kitchener decided to appoint
Colonel Ernest Swinton to become the British Army's official journalist on the Western Front.
Swinton's reports were first censored at G.H.Q. in France and then personally vetted by
Kitchener before being released to the press. Letters written by members of the armed
forces to their friends and families were also read and censored by the military authorities.

After complaints from the USA the British government decided to look again at how the
war was reported. After a Cabinet meeting on the subject in January, 1915, the government
decided to change its policy and to allow selected journalists to report the war. Five men
were chosen: Philip Gibbs (Daily Chronicle and the Daily Telegraph), Percival Philips (Daily
Express and the Morning Post), William Beach Thomas (Daily Mail and the Daily Mirror)
Henry Perry Robinson (The Times and the Daily News) and Herbert Russell (Reuters News
Agency). Before their reports could be sent back to England, they had to be submitted to
C. E. Montague, the former leader writer of the Manchester Guardian.

Over the next three years other journalists such as John Buchan, Valentine Williams, Hamilton
Fyfe and Henry Nevinson, became accredited war correspondents. To remain on the Western
Front, these journalists had to accept government control over what they wrote.

DORA was also used to control civilian behaviour. This including regulating alcohol consumption
and food supplies. In October 1915 the British government announced several measures they
believed would reduce alcohol consumption. A No Treating Order laid down that people could
not buy alcoholic drinks for other people. Public House opening times were also reduced to
12.00 noon to 2.30 pm and 6.30 to 9.30 pm. Before the law was changed, public houses could
open from 5 am in the morning to 12.30 pm at night.

The Ministry of Food did not introduce food rationing until January 1918. Sugar was the first to be
rationed and this was later followed by butchers' meat. The idea of rationing food was to guarantee
supplies, not to reduce consumption. This was successful and official figures show that the intake
of calories almost kept up to the pre-war level.

The growing disillusionment with the war was reflected in the novels that were written at the time.
A. T. Fitzroy's Despised and Rejected was published in April 1918. A thousand copies were sold
before the book was banned and its publisher, C. W. Daniel, was successfully prosecuted for
sedition. Another novel, What Not: A Prophetic Comedy by Rose Macaulay was due to be
published in the autumn of 1918. When the censors discovered that the book ridiculed wartime
bureaucracy, its publication was stopped and did not appear until after the Armistice.
