Hypocrisy, Cynicism and the
Homosexual Ideology

by Luiz Sérgio Solimeo

The scandal that resulted in Senator Larry Craig's resignation announcement
on September 2 proves how absurd it is to present homosexual vice as a
normal and acceptable lifestyle.

Taking the facts as they are reported by the media coupled by Senator
Craig's
guilty plea, the assessment of the situation of many Americans is that here
we have a member of Congress who showed himself incapable of mastering his
homosexual impulses-even at the risk of political suicide. This widespread
impression helps us measure the tyrannical stranglehold homosexual impulses
have upon those who surrender themselves to them. They become a true
obsession. They weaken man's will and cloud his intellect. He becomes
completely enslaved to these most irrational impulses.

If a man with strong reasons to abstain from this kind of behavior (not
wanting to jeopardize his political career) was unable to do so, what should
we imagine is the behavior of other homosexually addicted individuals who
lack strong reasons to practice self-restraint?

The brutality of the reported facts simply confirm what morality, history,
common sense, and serious studies conclude, namely, that the homosexual vice
is devastating to the human personality.1

Condemning hypocrisy instead of vice
In the brouhaha surrounding the senator, anyone who thought the homosexual
movement and its allies would take a low profile and wait out the storm, was
wrong. They successfully gave their spin on the scandal, continuing to cast
aspersion on anyone who opposes their ideology.

Not being opposed to Senator Craig's reported actions, they focused their
criticism on the hypocrisy they seemed to reveal. In fact, the
scandal-tainted politician has voted against the homosexual agenda in
Congress.

Thus, the more serious issue -the practice of homosexual vice-was passed
over in silence, and the movement's strident clamor highlighted the
inconsistency between the senator's alleged actions and his votes: while
personally indulging in homosexual acts, his legislative track record
hindered their normalization and acceptance in society.

In this line, the statement by Matt Foreman, Executive Director National Gay
and Lesbian Task Force, is quite telling:
&quot;What's up with elected officials like Senator Craig? They stand for
so-called 'family values' and fight basic protections for gay people while
furtively seeking other men for sex. Infuriating pathetic hypocrites. What
more can you say?&quot;2

Foreman goes on, making it clear that he is not opposed to the use of public
bathrooms for homosexual activity: &quot;And by the way, why are Minneapolis tax
dollars being used to have plainclothes police officers lurking idly in
airport restroom stalls?&quot;3

This is also why the homosexual movement has turned its guns on Jim Naugle,
the mayor of Fort Lauderdale, Fl., protesting against the enforcement
measures he has been taking to thwart those intent on using the city's
public restrooms for homosexual intercourse.4

The charge of hypocrisy voiced by the homosexual movement should, in all
fairness, be laid at its own doorstep: why does the movement seek to make
hay from the scandalous behavior attributed to Senator Craig when it defends
the public indecency he was accused of?

To avoid scandal is not the same as being a hypocrite
Setting aside the whole Craig episode, let us consider the various attitudes
a person can adopt regarding his own sin.

First of all, to call every concealment of sin an act of hypocrisy shows a
lack of understanding of the nature of sin and the human soul. It is a
psychological and moral oversimplification.

Sin does not affect only the person who commits it. If a sin is public, it
can influence others to evil. In such cases, the sinner is guilty not just
for his individual sin, but also, for the sin of scandal and all its serious
consequences.5 Thus, hypocrisy is not always and necessarily the reason for
the hiding of faults. The desire to do so could stem from a last vestige of
moral sense still at play within the soul and which leads one to search for
ways to avoid giving scandal.

On the other hand, we must remember that what characterizes hypocrisy is not
the concealment of sin, but rather to conceal sins in order to receive the
honors due to virtue, knowing full well that one does not deserve them.
Which is why the wit of La Rochefoucauld defined hypocrisy as &quot;the homage
which vice renders to virtue.&quot;

Cynicism is worse than hypocrisy
Like virtue, vice has degrees. And the least that can be said about the
sinner who tries to avoid giving scandal is that he has not fallen as low as
the cynic. Indeed, the latter, far from hiding sin, holds it up prominently
for everyone to see, showing how proud it makes him.
Just as there are cases of sick people that revolt against their illnesses
and who deliberately try to contaminate others, so also many cynics feel a
morbid pleasure in giving scandal and thus induce others to fall into sin.

From cynicism to ideology
No matter how low man falls, he can never discard his rational nature.
Consequently, the cynic who glories in his sin feels the need of finding a
rational justification for his behavior. This psychological imperative
facilitates the eruption or the acceptance of ideologies that &quot;justify&quot; his
conduct.

Acceptance of the &quot;justifying&quot; ideology is frequently followed by fanatical
adherence.

Once fanaticized, the cynic sins not only because he seeks an illusory
pleasure, but also and sometimes predominantly, for ideological reasons. Sin
is made to serve ideology, for unbridled human pride is more despotic than
the disorders of the flesh. Not only does the cynic strive to recruit more
ideological foot soldiers, but he uses the sin as a battering ram to attack
and demolish the moral structures of society.

This is the work of moral destruction caused by the homosexual movement.
Through many means, including its coast-to-coast homosexual pride parades,
the movement exerts a continual pressure on judges and lawmakers both to
grant its numerous demands and to paralyze, punish, and persecute its
opponents.

Although in the past, especially during the Renaissance, traces of this
homosexual ideology could be found in cabals of artists and writers, this is
the first time in the history of the Christian West that it has shaped a
worldwide movement.

To understand the nature and strategy of this movement is of supreme
importance for everyone wanting to defend the natural moral law and the Ten
Commandments. The homosexual movement's handling of the Senator Craig
scandal gives us an opportunity to observe and analyze some of the many
ploys used to further its subversive agenda.

Hello, my name is Sharon Scharf, ScottyFLL's mother. Let me start
by stating that Scotty is a liar and has been since childhood. We
tried to punish him, Scotty's father stuck his dick in his mouth
many times to stop the lies but it was useless. Scotty was a
problem child. Maybe it is because i am  bisexual with an
emphasis on the lesbian side, but who knows? Scotty is very
shy and afraid to show his face because as you probably know,
he isn't very good looking but i am not embarrassed. Here is my

Blobtardia, aka bobandcarole, posted in March of 2000 that he was
6'1&quot;
and 225 pounds.  That gives him a body mass index of 29.7.  This is
considered &quot;overweight&quot;.

At 29.9 one is considered obese.

We can expect, considering his severe laziness and the fact that he
was already fat in 2000, and that now he's in his 50s, that he has
gained weight since then.

So, his BMI is well over 30, which surpasses his IQ.

He's a FAT RETARDED PIG who had to marry a FAT RETARDED PIG WHO PEES

&quot;we are a white cpl, 40s, looking for bi female, or cpl w/bi female

ROTFLMAO. As if that Vitter guy (in the D.C. Madam's address book) was
doing any better.

And we don't really know if Craig was guilty of what he was arrested
for - the evidence is so weak that a conviction would be unlikely if
there was a trial.  There are, however, other reports suggesting he
might try gay sex every so often, assuming his self-proclaimed sex
partners are truthful about it rather than being activist types out to
get him for his homophobic positions on social issues.

Craig's problem (if he is gay) is that he has been repressing his
sexuality.  It's like putting a tight lid on a pot of water and
heating it until it boils.  Try that and see what happens (but keep a
safe distance).

&gt; Hypocrisy, Cynicism and the

&gt; by Luiz Sérgio Solimeo

&gt; The scandal that resulted in Senator Larry Craig's resignation announcement
&gt; on September 2 proves how absurd it is to present homosexual vice as a
&gt; normal and acceptable lifestyle.
">

Larry Craig is likely a well closeted polymorphous perverse bisexual.
He therefore would not be representative of the gay community,
His toilet forays do not constitute a relationship.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Taking the facts as they are reported by the media coupled by Senator
&gt; Craig's
&gt; guilty plea, the assessment of the situation of many Americans is that here
&gt; we have a member of Congress who showed himself incapable of mastering his
&gt; homosexual impulses-even at the risk of political suicide. This widespread
&gt; impression helps us measure the tyrannical stranglehold homosexual impulses
&gt; have upon those who surrender themselves to them. They become a true
&gt; obsession. They weaken man's will and cloud his intellect. He becomes
&gt; completely enslaved to these most irrational impulses.
">

Keep in mind that the man has a successful marriage as well, and as opposed to
Governor McGreevy, has not to anyone's knowledge formed a long term gay
partnership

This would make Senator Craig a bisexual with impulses that he chose to gratify
clandestinely, not a gay male. Polymorphous perverse, yes, bi, yes, polyamorous,
perhaps, but gay---no.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; If a man with strong reasons to abstain from this kind of behavior (not
&gt; wanting to jeopardize his political career) was unable to do so, what should
&gt; we imagine is the behavior of other homosexually addicted individuals who
&gt; lack strong reasons to practice self-restraint?
">

Lets start off with the fact, and I re-iterate fact, that homosexuality is not
an addiction or any other type of mental disorder. The largest and best educated
body of mental health researchers and clinicians in the world, the American
Psychiatric Association, has determined it not to be a disorder nor an illness,
and it is they, drawing upon years of past research and still ongoing studies,
who determine diagnostic legitimacy. Religious and political bodies do not, for
their own purposes, get to label something that they don't like as a disease,
disorder, or addiction. The last major attempt at this was in Soviet Russia with
dissidents, and the same people attempting to pathologize gays now were
condemning the Soviet Union then.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; The brutality of the reported facts simply confirm what morality, history,
&gt; common sense, and serious studies conclude, namely, that the homosexual vice
&gt; is devastating to the human personality.1
">

I have difficulty stretching the english language to the point where toe tapping
can be described in terms that would include the word &quot;brutality.&quot; My logic,
drummed into me by a Jesuit professor, tends towards the Thomistic and
Aristotelean. I am incapable of the kinds of gymnastics of semantics that the
author seems to be wandering into.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Condemning hypocrisy instead of vice
&gt; In the brouhaha surrounding the senator, anyone who thought the homosexual
&gt; movement and its allies would take a low profile and wait out the storm, was
&gt; wrong. They successfully gave their spin on the scandal, continuing to cast
&gt; aspersion on anyone who opposes their ideology.
">

There was no spin to give. The fact spoke loudly for themselves. A Senator noted
for anti gay positions was arrested while trying to solicit sexual favours from
a man.  No one came out and demanded a &quot;Toilet Sex Pride Day.&quot; We can be
forgiven for chuckling over the classical undoing of a long time foe, whose
political end reads like a Greek festival tragi-comedy from ancient Athens, with
hubris and self-righteousness making the fatal flaw all the more visible.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Not being opposed to Senator Craig's reported actions, they focused their
&gt; criticism on the hypocrisy they seemed to reveal. In fact, the
&gt; scandal-tainted politician has voted against the homosexual agenda in
&gt; Congress.
">

Other than equality and freedom from discrimination, what exactly is this fabled
and storied  &quot;homosexual agenda&quot; that the authors of the Right and particularly
the Christian Right keep referring to? Despite years of activism and authorship,
I have yet to receive a copy from national headquarters.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Thus, the more serious issue -the practice of homosexual vice-was passed
&gt; over in silence, and the movement's strident clamor highlighted the
&gt; inconsistency between the senator's alleged actions and his votes: while
&gt; personally indulging in homosexual acts, his legislative track record
&gt; hindered their normalization and acceptance in society.
">

Homosexual vice, which since Lawrence is no longer a crime, was not the issue of
the criminal case. Soliciting public sex was.
Again, I do not recall an occasion of large scale LGBT support demanding public
sex.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; In this line, the statement by Matt Foreman, Executive Director National Gay
&gt; and Lesbian Task Force, is quite telling:
&gt; &quot;What's up with elected officials like Senator Craig? They stand for
&gt; so-called 'family values' and fight basic protections for gay people while
&gt; furtively seeking other men for sex. Infuriating pathetic hypocrites. What
&gt; more can you say?&quot;2
">

Ok, Matt will never be one of the great speech writers of our time.
I am sure that Kate Clinton managed a better summation of the event in her most
recent comedy show.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Foreman goes on, making it clear that he is not opposed to the use of public
&gt; bathrooms for homosexual activity: &quot;And by the way, why are Minneapolis tax
&gt; dollars being used to have plainclothes police officers lurking idly in
&gt; airport restroom stalls?&quot;3
">

It is kind of silly in a city with a burgeoning drug problem.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; This is also why the homosexual movement has turned its guns on Jim Naugle,
&gt; the mayor of Fort Lauderdale, Fl., protesting against the enforcement
&gt; measures he has been taking to thwart those intent on using the city's
&gt; public restrooms for homosexual intercourse.4
">

No, the gay community turned on the mayor because he used a non issue, and it is
a non issue if you look at the paucity of arrests and low number of complaints
of sex in public toilets, to daemonize the gay community. The mayor is the chief
executive of a major gay and Lesbian tourist destination,  seems uncomfortable
with that and decided to do something about it by using his robo-potty press
conferences to go gay bashing. Perhaps the mayor will be more comfortable when
the millions of LGBT tourist dollars go elsewhere, while the city council pleads
with the LGBT leadership not to pull out and wipe out the economic base of the
city at the same time that the mayor continues his gay bashing.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; The charge of hypocrisy voiced by the homosexual movement should, in all
&gt; fairness, be laid at its own doorstep: why does the movement seek to make
&gt; hay from the scandalous behavior attributed to Senator Craig when it defends
&gt; the public indecency he was accused of?
">

We make hay of the hypocrisy of the downfall of one of our political enemies
through a behaviour that he accuses us of.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &lt;snip meanderings on the nature of sin, cynicism and hypocrisy&gt;

&gt; Cynicism is worse than hypocrisy
&gt; Like virtue, vice has degrees. And the least that can be said about the
&gt; sinner who tries to avoid giving scandal is that he has not fallen as low as
&gt; the cynic. Indeed, the latter, far from hiding sin, holds it up prominently
&gt; for everyone to see, showing how proud it makes him.
&gt; Just as there are cases of sick people that revolt against their illnesses
&gt; and who deliberately try to contaminate others, so also many cynics feel a
&gt; morbid pleasure in giving scandal and thus induce others to fall into sin.
">

You make the assumption that homosexuality is a sin, a theological position open
to debate and not held by many Americans just as you arrogated to yourself to
pathologize homosexuality despite the responsible medical body saying that you
are wrong in doing so.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; From cynicism to ideology
&gt; No matter how low man falls, he can never discard his rational nature.
&gt; Consequently, the cynic who glories in his sin feels the need of finding a
&gt; rational justification for his behavior. This psychological imperative
&gt; facilitates the eruption or the acceptance of ideologies that &quot;justify&quot; his
&gt; conduct.

&gt; Acceptance of the &quot;justifying&quot; ideology is frequently followed by fanatical
&gt; adherence.
">

And what fanatical adherence do you offer for accusing the gay community for
complicity in Senator Craig's toe-tapping in the toilet?
What fanatical adherence to an ideology is there at all in the LGBT community
given it's diversity of constitution? There is rarely agreement on any issue
outside of equality for all Americans amongst us. There is certainly no
agreement on any fanatical adherence to an ideology of any sort.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Once fanaticized, the cynic sins not only because he seeks an illusory
&gt; pleasure, but also and sometimes predominantly, for ideological reasons. Sin
&gt; is made to serve ideology, for unbridled human pride is more despotic than
&gt; the disorders of the flesh. Not only does the cynic strive to recruit more
&gt; ideological foot soldiers, but he uses the sin as a battering ram to attack
&gt; and demolish the moral structures of society.
">

That is an oft made and never supported accusation. Gay rights would have no
impact upon the morality of American society except for perhaps allowing people
to question whether faiths that damned us and portrayed us as monsters and
predators were accurate or honest. Most people who know gay or Lesbian couples
support LGBT equality. Perhaps that is the fear that drives you, the inability
to marginalize us.

It is easier to dissect the essay paragraph by paragraph and get to the
truth concerning the agenda of both the author and that agenda of the
Christian Right that all too often goes unspoken.

I honestly had fun doing so as this author actually dared to be fairly open
about the goals and fears of the Right.

Oh, far more fun and rewarding to use this essay to expose the Christian Right
agenda, which they nearly never discuss, though they all come from the same
school on the subject. Most leaders of the Christian Right either were
students of or embraced the ideas of Rousas Rushdooney and Gary North, then
were later careful not to mention them.

This author included a few to many of the precepts not to be recognized---

They want an end to the secular republic.

Vice in general is not a viable &quot;lifestyle.&quot; Doesn't matter if it's an obsession with the
penis, the vagina, the bottle, &quot;white powder,&quot; gambling, or any of the various and sundry
other outlets which comprise &quot;vice.&quot;

Sure, a little every now and then can make life more interesting: Beer and football, for
instance. When it becomes an uncontrolled urge, that's when problems happen; Even with the
various legal forms of vice.

But this isn't a screed about temperance and moderation. It's like reading a 1950's-era
tract about the dangers of masturbation. It compares to Clockwork Orange rather well too.
Lurid plot line, semi-plausible assertions, dire consequences, and then the formulaic
sermonette on sin.

Got a new lead on another member of the &quot;group of usual suspects,&quot; tip-o-the-hat for that;
But otherwise quite transparent and even somewhat amusing. Only thing that was missing was
a &quot;think of the children.&quot;

&lt;LOL&gt; This is my favorite part. &quot;Brutality&quot; indeed... Golly, how dangerous! There was an
emphatic &quot;No!&quot; uttered! Oh horrors!!!

No one was ruffed up. No rape. No beatings. No excessive force. The arresting officer even
says he doesn't want to create a scene... Quick! Lock the doors and hide the china!
Brutality's afoot!

&lt;guffaw&gt; Damn fine parody. And cross-posted to completely irrelevant groups too. That was
a nice touch.

I must remember to send the author a thank you card.

condemn people but it tells up to stop sinning period and in this case
homosexuality is one of them. u can yak all u want but think of the people
that have found solace in religion not every religion is negative and its
because the devil is at work and he doent want people to know the truth
thats why he is creating all this chaos and putting people off religion OR

fall i feel happier when i do good things and live according to the bible
but i feel a temporary high when i do wrong and after that i feel like crap.
God speaks to us in many ways through many sources it is lefy for us to
listen. it is not to tie u down or make u miserable but to free you and make
u grow up and evolve as a human being. to encourage you to dig deep within
urself and find out who you can really be. in the world today rich people
are important n looked after, beautiful people are worshipped, powerful
people are feared, but with GOD all men are equal and its in that equality
that u can find your true idendtity and purpose as a person not living inthe
shadow of some one else or a celebrity or beimg awestruck by anybody. GOD
loves us all but if we must know him we have to remove sin from our lives i
dont think giving up this is too much to ask. i guess as humans we all have
our princicles we live by or else we will be mad not to. God as well has his
principles we are so much like him in our core but if we want to partake of

I like the handle &quot;saved girl&quot; because it has been accepted by most
people that the most bitter and unhappy woman on the planet is one who
marries a homosexual whom as a good Christian lives the good life and
takes a wife for as long as he can, maybe even produces offspring.

When the gay Christian finally is driven to sin by the powers of Satan
and has homosexual sex inside or outside of marriage, whether he stays
within the marriage or leaves the marriage, keeps his wife or dumps his
wife - the wife feels betrayed and possibly destroyed when at the age of
40 to 50 with a few children grown or not is faced with some aspect of
her husbands homosexuality and all that that means.

The problems of the church is not the homosexual husband - the problems
of the church is saving and nurturing the wife back to physical and
mental health and a sense of well being.  Not an easy task even with
God's help.

&gt; &gt;urself and find out who you can really be. in the world today rich people
&gt; &gt;are important n looked after, beautiful people are worshipped, powerful

Don't be so sure.  To make that statement you have to be pretty young.

God loves everyone and has treated homosexuals very well and given them
a very good life.

The average homosexual lives a good life without harm or violence that
is close to perfect.

The only problems homosexuals have are those heterosexuals who hate them
or a million reasons and want to harm them.

But most heterosexuals who want to harm homosexuals also want to harm
children, wifes, family members and typically have lots of personal
problems.

If homosexuals didn't have a good life you would hear about it, read
about it and know about it.

Read any newspaper, watch any television show, go to any straight bar,
go to any church and it all about problems women have with men and men
have with women and problems men and women have with children and family
members.  It is not a pretty sight.  The church never talks about the
problems homosexuals have.

&gt; True.  Nowhere in the bible does it say it's ok to pack fudge.

For a simple, quick answer, there are more heterosexuals on the planet
than homosexuals.  Men for sure and some women talk about anal sex.  Men
love anal sex with their wifes or girlfriends if they can get it.
In simple math there are more heterosexual men and women doing anal sex
then all the homosexuals on the planet.

No where in the bible does it say its ok to let thousands of people

Actually, homosexuals have a happy life* in spite of God's direct,

&gt; Why does someone have to &quot;win&quot;?  Why can't you have your religion at the
&gt; same time others have theirs?

Didn't you look at his web page?  He seems to have some sort of breast
fetish.  He thinks Janet Jackson's superbowl thing has something to do
with Sodom and Gomorrah!  He seems to think that the sight of more and
more scantily clad people will make Christians start a war against
liberals and Jews (who he thinks always support liberals), and to win
the Christians will ask the Muslims for help and convert to Islam out
of gratitude.  Or something like that.  It's really kind of muddled.
The sequence of photos on his page seem vaguely reminiscent of a strip
show.

Don't try to discuss anything with this guy - he is completely
insane. :-)
