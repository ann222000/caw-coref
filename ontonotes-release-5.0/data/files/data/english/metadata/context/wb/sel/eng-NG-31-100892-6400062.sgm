one of the best contemporary writers shall be fondly and hilariously
remembered. something i can't say about dylan's or milton friedman's
or pope benedick's wanking. or all that utilitarianism masquerading as
''science''. after all, is this not the matrix youtube generation? why
is it i can never stop laughing? come on, it's like comparing
buzzcocks to comedy roast. yeah, the previous century was
baudrillard's and this one will certainly be his too. everything's
turning out just as he predicted.

&lt;1&gt; In many ways, Jean Baudrillard has never really attracted the
critical attention that he deserves; his early brilliant books, such
as For a Critique of the Political Economy of the Sign (1981) and The
Mirror of Production (1975)remain resolutely out of print, perhaps
because they do not accord with his recent high profile in the media.
The hermetic obscurantism of these older texts repels a more casual
reader, steeped as they are in poststructuralist theory and remote
Marxist anthropology. They are also more rigorously scholarly than
books such as Impossible Exchange, and therefore a less pleasurable
read for the academically uninitiated. However, Baudrillard's middle
phase, typified by Symbolic Exchange and Death (1993), is constantly
in print, although largely due to the earlier chapters on simulation,
which may appeal to those involved in careers in film or television;
the overall argument that he is attempting to make regarding symbolic
exchange receives far less critical attention. It is Baudrillard's
"fatal" phase of theory, published almost exclusively by Verso, which
has established his current notoriety.

&lt;2&gt; Baudrillard, referenced in J. G. Ballard's Super-Cannes (2000) and
the film The Matrix (1999), has now acquired a hip cultural cachet,
and this has sadly resulted in his academic marginalization; he is now
too popular, uncritical, or politically quietistic, divorced from
"real" social issues. But one cannot invoke the "real" to criticize
Baudrillard, and logically this has resulted in strong reactions
against him within the "theory machine" of the academy. But how many
academics, in all honesty, have taken the trouble to respond to
Baudrillard's provocations or trace the trajectory of his ideas?

About The Matrix

People behave like puppets guided by a virtual puppet-player, like
androids guided by The Matrix or adapted citizens guided by man-made
rules and requirements . They don't think themselves but others do
that for them and state the way they have to live. And God spoke:
"where are you Adam, but he only sees" christians, lawyers, Americans,
women, fathers, patients, scholars, and almost countless others masks
and complicated mixtures of them and many many more androids, but
there are no more men. And for generations and generations people have
excreted the work of their hands and behold all is vanity and vexation
of spirit and there is no profit under the sun. But their idols are
silver and gold ( and machines, computers, cars, guns, ships and
planes, cities etc.) the work of men's hands....they that make them are
like unto them; so is every one that trusteth in them. Working is for
the fools. Smohalla, Skokulk-chief spoke in 1850 the memorable words:
"Our young men never will work. Men who work cannot dream and wisdom
comes to us in our dreams". Every culture is a mistake.

....Baudrillard proclaimed that our world is no longer really "real"
but he didn't show at what moment the world split into two worlds and
I guess the problem is he isn't radical enough. Indeed there are two
worlds, the real world wherein everything is as it is and the world as
people perceive the world, filtered by their paradigms.

Baudrillard forgot when he was a small boy he only lived in one world
and there was only one reality for him, no future nor past troubled
him, and he was living in a eternal present. But his parents, plugged
in the Matrix, that complicated system of tradition, rules, moral,
unspoken codes, customs, constructed and justified by scientific
theories and religious systems, (Germans name it the Zeitgeist) broke
his self-image and so his image of the world in two.

Parents sacrifice their children to the Matrix by filling their heads
with that stuff that makes docile and uncritical consumers and
credulous worshippers of a self-created world. Only split people fit
in a split world. And it is not an existential melancholia but a
nostalgia to the lost paradise and the unbroken world people are
troubled with.

Plato's Allegory of the Cave shows the way people are chained to the
wall and they believe they see the real world. The myth tells how
dangerous it is to escape from the cave and the herd and how difficult
it is trying to free the chained. Indeed you first have to realize you
live in a dreamworld, like Leonardo da Vinci wrote: "We all are exiles
living inside the frames of a strange painting. He who knows this
lives grandly. The rest are insects". So you first have to realize you
are plugged into the Matrix by which you do what you won't to do and
do not what you really want to do.

In his time Sigmund Freud still named the Matrix the Super-ego as a
common multiple or resultant of all individual ego's and mutual they
maintain each other. Imprisoned in their cage, shackled to the Matrix,
people talk about freedom and they do believe and they even name it
freedom in restraint. It is dangerous to leave the cave or trying to
free yourself from the Matrix for most of the people who try to escape
are captured by the Agents and are locked in our mad-houses and
rechained to the wall, adapted by psychiatrists and other therapists
to society again.

A huge "health"-industry is needed to fight the symptoms of all
victims of the Matrix for there are only losers. Sometimes someone
escapes and beholds reality and people name him a mystic and they love
the beautiful words and poems by which he tells about the other world.
That's the way the plugged ones render him harmless. So it's not
enough to escape for you feel it like a mission to go back into the
cave to free the chained ones. First then you see the Matrix in his
horrible, all-enfolding and all-guiding omnipotence. You first have to
step out of the system to describe the system, for as long as you are
a part of the system your description of the system is not objective.
Then starts the task to decode and decipher the Matrix and that is a
hell of a job.

After our escape we puzzled more than twenty years to construct the
key to decode the Matrix and we experienced people are not "not ready
to be unplugged" but only mortally afraid. We mapped out the Matrix
but for years we couldn't find the right form and we knew we were not
allowed to make even one mistake. We found out the Matrix totally is
based on and penetrated by the Judeo-Christian thinking and that it is
the cement of the Colossos with feet of clay. And we knew we had to
defeat our enemy with his own weapons. Some three years ago we
understood we had to use the metaphore of the Gospel of Thomas and we
wrote the elucidations of the secret words.

Ultimately the people who created the figure of Jesus to hang on their
manual to escape from the Matrix saw what we see and experienced the
way we experience the world. We realize how dangerous it is what we do
and therefore we operate absolutely anonymous, sly as snakes and
harmless as doves. For us everybody is a potential Agent, for all
people are linked to the Matrix and we never do know if they choose
for freedom or for the apparent security of the Matrix. Even we are
not sure there isn't a Cypher among us.

The Matrix and Jean Baudrillard's "Simulacra and Simulations"*

The Matrix makes explicit reference to the work of Baudrillard,
especially the 1983 essay "Simulacra and Simulations". Baudrillard
assumes the proliferation of images in advanced capitalism, with the
expansion of commodities and the relentless advance of technologies of
visualization and simulation. In the essay, Baudrillard describes a
movement from "representation" (of something real) to
"simulation" (with no secure reference to reality). This movement from
representation to simulation changes the relation between sign and
referent, so that we lose the connection, once presumed to exist,
between sign or image and the reality to which both were thought to
refer. To develop this argument Baudrillard asks us to think about
situations where the simulating sign or image usurps the priority of
the reality it is supposed to "serve":

1: the perfect map as that which duplicates the extent and every
detail of the territory of an "empire" (in a Borges parable): as the
empire decays, the fragments of the map shows bits of its former
grandeur

2: the patient who simulates symptoms of madness so well he/she is
declared to be mad

3: the infantile simulation of reality and history that is Disneyland:
it secures the (comparative) "reality' of Los Angeles

4: the simulation of a hostage drama turns real when a hostage dies of
a heart attack and the police shoot

5: the image is supposed to help believers worship God; but they come
to rely upon these images so much that they become the true object of
worship; therefore iconoclasts (in the Byzantine Empire) attack the
images as an usurpation of the
