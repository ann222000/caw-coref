I have a laptop that was running Windows 2000 Pro. I cannot boot from
the
DVD/CD-ROM, nor can I boot from a floppy and then access the DVD/CD-
ROM
drive, because they share the same ultrabay location. I really wanted
to switch
this particular laptop to openSUSE 10.2.

I searched an ran across the instlux project (http://
instlux.sourceforge.net). This
worked great, and I was able to install openSUSE 10.2 without having
to boot
from a floppy or a DVD/CD-ROM drive. I completely wiped my W2K Pro
install
and now have a complete running system.

openSUSE seems great and I have no issues with running this distro,
but I am
curious about this in case I might want to try the new Ubuntu
release.

Is there a way to switch Linux distributions on the same laptop
without having to
boot from a floppy or the DVD/CD-ROM drive?

Can you start an Ubuntu installation while up and running openSUSE?

Or, maybe more appropriately, is there a utility, a project, or a
feature of a Linux
distribution that enables me to install a different distribution
without having to
boot from the DVD/CD-ROM drive?

I don't want to dual boot in the long run, but is this the way to
approach this?

In cases such as yours, where you are starting with the goal of testing
several GNU/Linux distributions, I have recommended that users lay out
their plan on paper. The plan usually takes the form of a table which
shows how disk space will be allocated between each distribution. Each
distribution will need a disk partition with adequate space. Also, some
consideration should be given to how the bootstrap will be accomplished
for each distribution. I have recommended the grub bootloader.

The complexity of dual boot systems is tamed considerably by using
grub. Grub is a very flexible boot loader, and can boot different OSs by
simply adding appropriate entries to its menu. It's really easy to use
after studying its documentation. Â You should practice and become
familiar with how it works, its naming convention, etc. Also, as a
prerequisite, make sure you are familiar with the rules for disk
partitioning in the PC world.

More about grub...
The grub bootloader can be thought of as a self-contained, mini-OS, whose
job is to load other OSs. It is not tied to a specific GNU/Linux
distribution. Because grub is self-contained it should probably have its
own place (partition) where it will "live." That way, you won't break the
loader if you decide to erase openSuse. That is one way to re-use
disc partitions and simply install a different GNU/Linux distribution for
testing.

I write about dual boot systems quite often. Here is a recent thread with
advice and links for setting up:
