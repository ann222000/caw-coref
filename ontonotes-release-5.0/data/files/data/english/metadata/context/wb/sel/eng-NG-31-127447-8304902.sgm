Brainwash summer camp

They run summer camps for children and teach them all about love,
modesty, and safe sex. They even hand out awards. Yet, it turns out that
behind the volunteers of the Association for Prosperity and Security in
the Middle East stands the disputed Scientology sect. Association
members insist they are not missionaries. 'Our aim is to teach values,'
they say. The surprised parents are not convinced. 'How come they run
such activities without even asking us?'

LOL.  Bigoted.  I don't prefer one religion over another.  I wish they'd all
go away.  I'm aware of many of the historical influences.  As to the
&quot;spiritual influences&quot;:  hooey.  Con-men, dictators, elitist scum-bags
ruling people through fear of punishments or rewards in an afterlife.  Lies.

People can remain ignorant if they wish, and pretend to knowledge of &quot;God&quot;
or avatars of gods, but it's all delusional bullshit, so why credit it?

Reason, logic, and direct experience can lead us out of the insanity of our
primitive religious past.

&gt; You can rest assured that we will control the Iranian nuke that will be
&gt; ready in the next six months. That day, we will openly state our
&gt; conditions for the final takeover of this entire planet.

&gt; Do you really think that the weak aberrated wog population would risk the
&gt; thought of let's say one million dead Americans in some city, and let the
&gt; U.S military launch a preemptive strike against let's say Tehran?

&gt; Oh no, forget that. The wog rule is over when we get the Iranian nukes,
&gt; have no doubt about that.

It is a frightening concept that more religious groups will have their
finger on the button, soon.  It's bad enough that our own &quot;neo-con&quot;
&quot;christians&quot; threaten the world with it.  Already, Hindus and Islamists
threaten each other, as well.  All we need is the radical Iranians to get
the bomb, too.  If the Scientologists had it, it couldn't be any worse than
this, already, is.

Ban  religions.

No, Arnie, that's not my game.  I don't hate religious people, I hate
religion.

BTW, I called you like you asked, but for some reason, you didn't pick up
the phone, and never called me back.  You sounded earnestly interested in
dialogue, that for some reason you couldn't engage in through
email/bbs/usenet.  So, I called, like you asked.  Feel free to call me, any
time, concerning your interest in whether or not I have some &quot;target&quot; with
regard to ARS, critics, or your other imaginings of yours.  BTW, is it still
your theory that long durations of very low voltage/amperage have the same
effect on the human body as higher voltages over shorter duration?  Or have
you decided that bullshit story won't float anymore?

Anyway, you can keep guessing, or you can just read what is written, or pick
up your phone when you tell people to call you, or even call ME.
