Its only a dream so don't get too excited yet.  India is being blocked
entry into the international space station project.  China has an even
lesser chance of gaining entry.  So why not India &amp; China collaborate
on :

a) an unmanned robotic mission to mars followed by
b) an Asian space station

both can share the cost and benefits.

India seeks Russian help to join ISS project.

India has sought the help of Russia [Images] to join the orbital
International Space Station [Images] project in the face of &quot;objection
by some other project partners,&quot; a top Russian space agency official
has said.

&quot;India has approached us, this (India) is a serious space power and
would like to join ISS project. However, objection by some other
project partners has put a question mark on this issue,&quot; Russia's
Federal Space Agency Chief Anatoly Perminov said responding to a
question about the expansion of the ISS project participants.

Besides Russian RKA, the ambitious ISS project includes the NASA
[Images] of the USA, Canada [Images], Japan [Images] and European
Space Agency.

&quot;I won't identify, who is concretely blocking India's entry, but they
argue that the number of participants of the project is set by the
international treaties and is enough to complete the construction of
the orbital station,&quot; Perminov told reporters at a news conference in
Moscow [Images].

Lauding India's achievements in unmanned space flights, Perminov said
that it was her natural desire to offer its contribution in the
development of ISS.

&quot;I am confident that sooner or later, in any case after 2010, this
issue (India's accession) will again be raised,&quot; Perminov said.

The Planet Earth is overpopulated to many times its natural carrying

never have those things without the colonization of space. Period.

By that logic, the US should never have undertaken it's Space Program
given the problems of both the huge black underclass and the
increasing numbers of poor (and often illegal) Latino immigrants. As
for Russia it's a basketcase with an economy worse than Mexico or

The same arguments have been made about the US space program, so why do we
have one?

The fact is that each government program has to stand on its own merits.
That and the size of NASA's budget is miniscule compared to the social
programs, so ending NASA wouldn't amount to much.

No you don't. 95% of all Indians lives in abject poverty and as a nation
India is very poorly developed, primitive even. Even in the 1950s the U.S.
was by far the richest nation in the world.

There is no evidence that  junking a nation's space programme will do
anything beyond lowering the educational and employment prospects of its
more restless and enterprising citizens ( without whom there is,
effectively, no nation at all worthy of the name). Would you rather they
took up arms instead?
The only hope for India and China, and most other nations, is in furthering
the peaceful and constructive ambitions and aspirations of its more
enterprising people- the standard bearers of Humankind. Space development,
it is widely acknowledged , assists greatly in this respect, as the debates
in India's Parliament have recognised in recent years.
As for the millions of poor and hungry,  Rome and Babylon had them , too-
without the aid of space programmes.
As Christ said, &quot;The poor shall be with you always&quot;- with or without space
programmes.

Before junking space programmes which add to our scientific,evolutionary and
cultural potential , let us junk war, gambling,  child pornography and
exploitation, illicit drugs,  and cigarettes- none of which do anything for
human advancement at all, and which cost a good deal more than the next few
decades' explorations  of the Moon and Mars could hope to do.
When all the foregoing have been finally abolished - if we still have
problems of hunger and poverty, we could consider scrapping our space
programmes- but ,thanks to our then  proven incompetence at solving  the
problems of hunger and poverty even after abolishing the vices above, I
doubt merely junking space programmes would do any good anyhow....
Poverty and hunger are not caused by space programmes but by incompetent
Governments and societies driven by clapped out creeds or sheer avarice
which conspire to assist the culling labours of an impersonal &quot;Mother&quot;
Nature.

Exploration of our world and , in our times, Space beyond , like Science in
general ,Philosophy, and Art  are among the few positive achievements of
human civilization- ones which, moreover, are beyond the scope of any of the
rest of the Animal Kingdom. These are to humans what spinning webs is to
spiders,- defining characteristics which give us our raison d'etre in the
Universal scheme,and without which we are merely a waste of space awaiting
extinction. Without them, the hundreds of millions of poor and hungry will
merely grow into billions, and the Human Enterprise would lose meaning
altogether

&gt; &gt; India seeks Russian help to join ISS project.

&gt; &gt; India has sought the help of Russia [Images] to join the orbital
&gt; &gt; International Space Station [Images] project in the face of &quot;objection
&gt; &gt; by some other project partners,&quot; a top Russian space agency official
&gt; &gt; has said.

&gt; &gt; &quot;India has approached us, this (India) is a serious space power and
&gt; &gt; would like to join ISS project. However, objection by some other
&gt; &gt; project partners has put a question mark on this issue,&quot; Russia's
&gt; &gt; Federal Space Agency Chief Anatoly Perminov said responding to a
&gt; &gt; question about the expansion of the ISS project participants.

&gt; &gt; Besides Russian RKA, the ambitious ISS project includes the NASA
&gt; &gt; [Images] of the USA, Canada [Images], Japan [Images] and European
&gt; &gt; Space Agency.

&gt; &gt; &quot;I won't identify, who is concretely blocking India's entry, but they
&gt; &gt; argue that the number of participants of the project is set by the
&gt; &gt; international treaties and is enough to complete the construction of
&gt; &gt; the orbital station,&quot; Perminov told reporters at a news conference in
&gt; &gt; Moscow [Images].

&gt; &gt; Lauding India's achievements in unmanned space flights, Perminov said
&gt; &gt; that it was her natural desire to offer its contribution in the
&gt; &gt; development of ISS.

&gt; &gt; &quot;I am confident that sooner or later, in any case after 2010, this
&gt; &gt; issue (India's accession) will again be raised,&quot; Perminov said.

&gt; If India and China can cooperate, what's next?  An Israeli-Palestinian

Great point.  Jim Relsh is obviously an ignoramus talking bullocks.
If nobody had purchased a computer in India 2+ decades ago, there
would be no IT industry.  There are hoards of educated but unemployed/
underemployed persons in both countries.

Getting back to the subject, India and China currently do not
collaborate on anything.  This is due to suspicion following the 1962
border war.  There should be a proposal that the two countries should
begin some form of collaboration in space - even if it is small scale.

The perfect step would be a robotic mission to mars or a hubble type

Yes, space exploration is a good place for both countries to do
something together because they're at about the same level and the
immense space frontier would make them realise that their own frontier

I reckon if the Chinese or Indians really want to go down in history,
they should organise a manned mission to Mars. I am not talking about
a high tech mission but a one way foot planting mission.
Find a few  volunteers (married couple for instance). Send enough food
for a few years.
A spacecraft the size of Apollo is all that is needed. Prefably
scientists should be sent who stand a good chance of survival.

What do we reckon is the minimum size of a mission that could

I think that is a truly interesting question. I fear that it would
take
alot. It woud require enough materials for extraction tech
infrastructure and processing
tech infrastruction to produce Mars grade mobility suits and build
pressurized green houses or perhaps solar cells and storage
to power plant grow units buried deep in the Martian earth and build
the excavating machines needed to dig the tunnels of the units.
Even if you find a cave, you still need a supply resources and
extraction
tech and processing tech.

Or they could &quot;just&quot; supply them with enough space suits for 60 years
and make sure they are sterile.

Mars might get really boring even with
a hot chick and lots of Viagra, Mars would get old. 9 millibars of CO2
and N2
and lots of rocks plus the chance of a little incoming from above
and the occassional wayward dust devil.

And then there is the issue of whether it possible to grow anything
useful
in Martian mineral soil in the greenhouses. Or do we need a separate
cargo from Home Depot with peat, 15-15-15 fertilizer, and soil
ammendments?

So the question is does a Martian mobile suit require less than
a Moon grade suit? Does that 6 to 10 millibars get us anything?

I suppose the Adam and Eve  of Mars may have to wait until someone
builds
the grand city of Mars Babel Nova. Perhaps Adam and Eve should be
super robots dedicated to building Mars Babel Nova for the humans
that come 30 years later. Unless the slaves revolt;-)

Is there something that China did that was nearly as bad off as what

There are so many different possible answers. A completely self
sustaining colony would be a VN machine. In a fairly short space of
time we will have the ability to provide manual dexterity equal or
exceeding that of the human operator. Is the question the minimum size
of a VN machine?

At present the answer is infinity, we do not yet have a Von Neumann
machine. What is the minimum for the future. An exact computation is
impossible but I would reckon considerably less than a milligram if
you are using nanotechnology.

What is the minimum human size of seed. Would you say one woman + a
load of ova and sperm, or would you be talking in terms of building
organs from stem cells?

Some time ago NASA calculated something of the order of 100 tons. I
think this is perhaps the sort of answer you have in mind. This
computation was based on the processing of rock in conventional
furnaces. If you have materials hot prcessed that sets a minimum size
in terms of conserving heat. Biological processing is cold, you don't
need a source of heat. Probably 100 tons is fair enough for hot
processing. That is to say electroysis of alumina in cryolyte for
example.

Also a Martian colony will not in practice be able to produce all its
own chips for a long time after it is self supporting in other ways.

We should not ignore biology in out considerations. Evolution has
produced self replicating entities of microscopic size.

I know that question came up in response to a post I made in
rec.arts.sf.written; many people said that what I felt was about as
large a colony as the United States could afford to start in the
foreseeable future - perhaps about 60 colonists, with about 60 or maybe
even 300 tons of supplies not requiring life-support - would be far too
small, and certainly doomed to failure.

Nobody can survive on Mars, unless he is protected against cosmic
radiation. I understand that in a single year, a human on Mars might
loose as much as 20% of his brainmatter, if he/she doesn´t live
beneath some seriously effective radiation shielding.

In addition, it´s very cold and the airpressure is truly minuscule.

The Moon is a far easier plase to live on, as it can be far more
easilly supplied from Earth.

Will Durant, The Story Of Civilization, tells the story about Roman
Emperor Vespasian going to see a large new technological marvel that would
save much labor on many projects. He curtly dismissed it as a device that
would leave more of his people poor, out of work and hungry.

In Colombus's time, after his initial voyage and well before Cortez and
Pizarro's conquests of the Aztec and Inca Empires, there were those in Spain
who decried all the tremendous expenses of sending fleets of ships and men
out to the savage hell of the Americas when the money could have been better
spent raising the lot of the Spanish poor at home. Not a single one of those
who were decrying the expenses and the fleets realized that none of the
money (money being a token of energy) even existed, or could exist, before
the [generation] of the frontier fleets and the tremendous effort to move
into new [outer spatial] frontiers.

So very few have learned anything at all in the last 18 centuries. That
such new technologies and awesome efforts -- the physics -- cannot be turned
inward instead of outward without rapidly resulting in diminishing returns
rather than increasing returns...an overall loss of what was rather than any
gain of anything new (inexorable accelerating drain of real principal rather
than any gain of real interest on the principal).

What is [unreal] interest gain on principal? When it takes a wheelbarrow
of money, a wheelbarrow of worthless paper, to buy a loaf of bread, a gallon
of petrol, one single share of stock, whatever. When ever increasing
&quot;conservation&quot; and &quot;efficiency&quot; is the order of the day -- a little
yesterday, a lot today, and killingly tomorrow.

With no support at all? What about knowledge transfer? Without this,
it would probably have to number in the thousands. With knowledge
transfer, its much less.

So much of our produce is now intangible, and can be transferred to
Mars at the speed of light. This includes software and 3-d designs. On
the moon, this could even extend to remote control, meaning the crew
only have to fix the machines. Crucially, without knowledge transfer,
the Science of a small base (&lt;X,000) couldn't be advanced, and without
advance, there is only decline.

Its also likely that in a few decades expert systems will be good
enough to allow humans to display a wider range of skills than they
can now.

So given a lot of computer support, a supply of knowledge from Earth,
and leaving aside the issue of genetics (solved by big sperm / egg

As for knowledge I think we have reached the state that
the scientists who are travelling to mars could bring
with them in an hard disk with terra bites of memory.

As for mars inhabitation I think it is possible if the

That's true, and even better yet if getting tossed at us from the
backside L2 wouldn't hardly take any deployed energy per given tonne,

our way at a terrific moon gravity assisted escape velocity, it's too
damn late.

But we are not planning that.  OBL is now working on
planting an earth generator under the white house.
