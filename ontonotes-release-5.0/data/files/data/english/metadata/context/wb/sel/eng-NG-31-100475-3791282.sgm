They sell bleeder valves with check valves for this purpose. There are other
things that you can buy too. Talk to the auto parts store.

Sometimes, this *gravity bleed* procedure works: open the bleed screw &amp;
let it sit a while (may take 1/2 hour) &amp; drain by gravity.  Close screw.
Fill reservoir.  Pump brake pedal.  Go and re-open the bleed screw &amp; let sit
long enough again until you see fluid has run out.  Close screw, refill
reservoir, &amp; it may be ok.  May hafta do again.  Luck to you, s

Another way is to attach a rubber hose of correct size to bleeder
nipple and make hose just long enough to rest the other end in the
bottom of a can or jar full of brake fluid so that no airs is sucked
back it when pumping/bleeding the system.

Thats a new one on me. Never heard of this one before and I have heard
some strange ones too. Now I have heard of some presurizing the master
cylinder resevoir with some air pressure to force the fluid through
when bleeders are opened.

Gravity bleeding will work sometimes, well, lots of times.  I lost my
master cylinder top on an off road run, a branch came up and hooked it I
guess and I ended up 25 miles from the nearest house with no brakes due
to all the fluid splashing out.

I was lucky and had a bottle of brake fluid along with extra oil and
coolant in my spare parts box as I was running solo.

I opened all 4 bleeders and just kept topping up my MC.  It took over a
half hour before I saw bubbles coming out and likely over an hour to
finish, but it worked.  That was 5 years ago and I haven't touched them
since.

Now if you have ABS then all bets are off.  I have no idea if a gravity
bleed will work on those systems.

When I do it this way, I wrap a lot of thread tape on the thread of the
bleeder valve to keep air from getting in that way.

Anti lock brakes have nothing to do with the brakes themselves other
than pulsing the caliper.  The process uses a Hall effects sensor on
either the spindle or the axle to prove that the axle or spindle are
still moving during braking action.  The long and short of it is that
it's a magnetic switch that I think creates a current that the
computer is able to read.  I've been working with them for years on
commercial heating and air conditioning equiptment.

What about the ABS pumps and things on 'cars'?

They are connected to the lines but are controlled by the computer
through the Hall sensors.  I really don't know much about how they
work together as a team other than when the sensors notice that the
wheels have stopped during a braking episode, the computer pulses the
brake that has stopped.
