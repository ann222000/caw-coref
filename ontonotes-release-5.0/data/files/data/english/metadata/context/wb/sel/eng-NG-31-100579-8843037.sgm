I have created a new n/group
alt.failed-writers
)This took me six days,  and today I am resting.)
And now I will, like some latter-day Moses, lead all such from this
cruel and inhospitable environment to the Promised Bland.
Note: any successful writer or author of any description who tries to
creep in will be stoned to death. I'd prefer they be nailed to a wooden
cross and hung up to dry, but have you seen the cost of timber these
days all right already?

I've always found it odd that some people - often the minor or
mediocre - dare to lay claim to being successful writers. Everyone
knows (or should know) that like actors, the vast majority are out of
work for very long periods of time, and subsist on tiny incomes.
Orwell, Joyce, Kafka, Thomas - I very much doubt they could have
bought more than a plate of peas on the salaries they drew from
writing during their lifetimes. Yet this in no way reflects the
quality nor importance of their work. If you measure success in purely
fiscal terms, then almost by default you have to condemn those who
achieve success as poor writers, because the greater majority of top-
selling fiction is truly awful. The unintellectual city worker whose
greatest achievement is to have read 'Bridget Jones' Diary' without
needing to consult a dictionary demands light, pappy magazine prose
that can be guzzled down with a tuna wrap and diet coke.

Robert Aickman won one of his meagre two genre awards for a short
story that he was paid peanuts for. No doubt some (casts eyes towards
New Mexico) would thus accord him an unsuccessful writer.

I think you should ask everyone who joins alt.failed.writers to assume
a famous nom-de-plume, ideally those of talented writers who were
derided and scorned by the critics and publishers of the time.

Well said. They also did not join any third-rate mutual admiration society
in order to get a forum for self-promotion. They had integrity in their art.

Ah, and sure   it saddens me heart  to see such bitter incredulity in a
lad of such  few years.
You can only see it and the joys therein if you're a   failed writer, see.
Er, you're not a failed writer, are you?
I'm told you can also probably see it,  and all sorts of other wonderful
things too,  if you smoke some illegal substance
- they call it 'joints'  I believe.  Never could afford such things
myself, so I wouldn't know.

I see he has failed at something else too.  Alas, poor Ian, we love
him anyway.

PS IAN: Not sure where Fort Worth is, (and cant be bothered to find
out - Google aint my friend), but I hope its well away from the
southern coast.  I know what those bloody hurricanes can do, from
first hand experience.

Yep: story of my life. I have the sidaM touch, you see: everything I
touch turns to mold. And there's no resale value in mold....

No, thanks for the concern, but the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex is away
up in the  north of the State, not many miles from the Oklahoma border.
Maybe 500 - 600 miles from the coast. Tornadoes  and giant sized
hailstones that can destroy your roof shingles are the main  weather
hazards here, but so far I've escaped both!

Very true: in  a nutshell, you *can*  make a  very good living from
writing, but almost never by writing really good  stuff that will still
be read  200 years from now.
Some first class writers have made it pay, - Graham greene ended his
days in the south of France; William Golding, well his first book made
it on to the big screen so presumably he did OK financially.
The top ten Best Sellers list is best regarded as a list of books it
would be a good idea to avoid - the average American's taste in reading,
if he/she reads more than the occasional magazine that is, is pretty
dire.  Childhood TV addiction and the education setup here are to blame
I suppose. (American readers of this group, of course, excepted!).

Excellent idea!I shall call myself George MacDonald Fraser (creator of
the Flashman series: not sure if his earlier books were derided by the
critics, but it's a safe bet they were burned by various Womens Movements
and Feminist fanatics! And he uses the dreaded 'nixxer' word freely
throughout so he was likely enough chastised for that too.
He resides now on the Isle of Man, a tax haven, so presumably he made it
pay.
