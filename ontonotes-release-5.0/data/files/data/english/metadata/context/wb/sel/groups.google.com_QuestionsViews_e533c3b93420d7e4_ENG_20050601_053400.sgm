Should a person be accountable for something they invent or discover?
No, they should not. A person who invents something should not be held
accountable if someone elses uses it for harm. A gun maker should
never be charged with murder just because a gun is used to kill
someone. A scientist who discovers something should not be blamed if
someone else used his discover for evil. e.i. Einstein discovered
Atomic Physics and thought they would be a great advancement in
science. He had no idea what would ultimatly happen because of his
discovery. He is in noway shape or form at fault for the Atomic bombs.
He even later stated that if he knew what would have happened, he
would have keep the discovery a secret. I know this is a post similar
to a debate i am having with another person in another group, but i
really liked it and i decided it to be my first topis in this group.
It is all original, and i have not copy &amp; pasted any of it.

Hi shughart7, great to see that you have your own group and thanks for
the invite! This is a great topic and I'll post a message here that is
similar to what I've posted at the epistemology group.

There are many aspects to this question of accountibility, especially
in relation to scientists, who may well be employed to create weapons
of mass destruction. I'll go over a few of them here:

1. Educational independence, accountibility and liability

How much accountibility should go to the educational institutions for
teaching anyone how to make bombs and biological weapons? Do such
institutions check the mental stability and the intention of the people
they give the technical details? Do they also insist that students
consider some ethical questions? Where educational institutions fail to
go into such issues, should they be held liable when it later becomes
clear there were shortcomings in their education? Is &quot;independence&quot; a
valid argument for educational institutions to escape liability? How
sacred is independence?

2. Trade practices and business conduct

Should companies that employ people to make such weapons escape
accountibility and liability? Should they be allowed to sell their
products to the highest bidder, no questions asked? Of course not,
companies are both sued criminally and privately all the time. But
court cases often demand evidence. Should there be intervention at an
earlier stage, e.g. when weapons of mass destruction are still being
developed, rather than actually sold and used by terrorist or
dictators? Should staff be fully informed about the character of their
work? Should investors, staff and customers be prosecuted for ordering
and producing such weapons in secrecy? How sacred is secrecy?

3. Obligation to blow the whistle?

If the companies that employ scientists act without conscience, should
scientists close their eyes when it's obvious that the product they're
asked to work on can only be used to kill people in massive numbers?
It's sometimes hard to know in advance whether employers are working
within the bounderies of what's acceptable. Just like there's a good
samaritan law, should there be an obligation on staff to become a
wistleblower, when circumstances call for it?

4. Personal responsibility and principles - a pledge for scientists

Finally, should the acceptance of personal responsibility be a
prerequisite for certain positions? When we consult a doctor, the
doctor could earn quite a bit of money by faking things, by telling us
we had diseases that we didn't have, by prescribing medicine that we
didn't need and that earned some kick-backs. Doctors pledge not to do
harm to patients. Shouldn't we demand the same from scientists?
Shouldn't scientists have a similar pledge? Do scientists have certain
principles? If so, what are they?

Indeed, a pledge for scientists would come a long way to improve the
situation on all the above points. Such a pledge should be explained to
scientists during their education and should be a prerequisite for
completing their study. When seeking emoployment, scientists should
inquire to ensure their work will comply with their pledge and the
pledge should include an obligation to blow the whistle where
appropriate.

Ok, as far as liability goes, i came up with a quote: the bullet maker
doesn't fire the gun. Do you get that? I tried to think it out and
make it a good quote. What i mean by it is; a person that creates
something should NOT under any circumstances be held accountable for
how others use it. Yes, WMD (weapons of mass destruction) are bad, but
they are just an &quot;illusion&quot; of safety. Let me try to explain another
example, besides the great Einstein one i have already talked about.
Ok, a fireworks factory makes many fireworks and distributes them all
over. Now, as soon as the store or where ever buys the fireworks from
the factory, the factory is not and should not be accountable for
anything that happens to those fireworks (unless they are defective,
which is different all together). It is now the stores reponsiblity.
So, if a minor bought them, the store is at fault for allowing it. If
an elligable consumer bought them though, the store is no longer
accountable. So, if a person bought a bunch of fireworks, made a bomb,
blew something up and killed people, it is in no way the factorie's
fault. About the pledge; while doctors do have to sign a pledge and i
fully agree with that, i do not believe scientists should be forced to.
It is mostly US Government R&amp;D that designs and manufactures weapons.
Individual scientists rarely set out to do this. Most scientists
discover something they think is great that would be a great
advancement in humankind, but someone turns their discovery into a
weapon for killing. ei.- atomic physics, partical acceleration, EM
(electromagnetic) waves, etc. It is because a scientist is not bound
that a lot of dicoveries/inventions are made, good and bad, but the
good surely out weigh the bad. Think how far humans have come in the
short time they have been on Earth. Blaming a gunmanufacturer for
murder is just another way society, in general, is trying to avoid
responsiblity for its actions. That's like saying &quot;the videogame made
me do it.&quot; In my book, that's bullshit. Well, anyways, i fell that
i'm starting to ramble. I hope this new group gets more to debating
and solving, rather than arguing and fighting. Thank you so much for
joining.

Well,

This is a long-standing debate. There is an excellent book that
illustrates the historical highlights written by Lelia Green called
Communication, Technology and Society.

Green illustrates the two dominant views:

1. Technology is neutral. &quot;Guns don't kill people, people kill people.&quot;
In this view, the objects cannot be blamed for their use, nor the
inventors of the objects.

2. Technology is embedded with an implied use. &quot;Guns are designed to
punch holes in flesh.&quot; In this view, there is an implied purpose
represented in the design of a gun. The presence of the implied use
encourages a particular use.

I used guns because this boils down neatly into the gun control debate.
Those who believe that technology is neutral believe that gun control
is useless. If murderers don't have guns, they will pick up knives or
sharp sticks. It's the people who are responsible.

Those who believe that technology is a shaped by culture and therefore
has an implied intended purpose believe that the ease and simplicity of
a handgun encourage its use to commit murder. They point out that a
murder will not commit as many murders (or perhaps none at all) if
killing were less efficient, or if the act cost the actor more than
simply squeezing a trigger and walking off.

Depending on which view you adopt, your views of gun control are shaped
into a specific perspective.

What I find ironic is that those who believe strongly in gun control
(typically Democrats) do not believe as strongly in controlling nuclear
and biological proliferation. And those who believe gun control is
wrong (typically Republicans) believe in strong WMD control.

But in terms of responsibility, the most interesting case is the
Grokster case being decided by the Supreme Court right now. Unlike the
Napster case, Grokster (the company) has no control over what users do
with its services, meaning the only accountability they have is for
what they have unleashed.

Hollywood, of course, believes that the protocol has only one designed
use: piracy. It wants Grokster held accountable for creating the
protocol.

Those who are arguing for Grokster are saying that if a technology firm
has to consider all the potential uses of a technology before they
produce it or face liability for its misuse, it will create a chill in
the technology sector that we may never recover from. (And of course,
the 1984 Betamax decision has a new relevance, no matter what the
decision is).

Personally, I tend to view how a technology is defined or how it is
used in a society as the responsibility of the society itself. The
inventor or deliverer of a technology can frame a technology's use to a
certain degree, but society can reject this framing or invent its own.

Society often repurposes a technology beyond its original design.
Technologies change and evolve not as a result of the original
innovator, but because of their appeal and creativity of the users.

iPods give birth to Podcasting, possibly changing the future of radio
forever. Does Steve Jobs (or the Apple designers) get the credit/blame?
Well, maybe some. They will claim it. But the users and hackers deserve
most of the credit for these developments.

So, no, I do not think researchers or scientists can be held completely
responsible for the effects and outcomes of the application of their
discoveries and knowledge. Their job is to present alternatives and
potential options for society. It is up to others to take
responsibility for their own use of a given tool or technology.

Should we blame the Chinese because they are generally credited with
the invention of gunpowder for all the gun-related violence in human
history? Or was gun powder irrelevant to the decision to use it to kill
human beings? Or is the responsibility somewhere in between these two
extreme views?

Good point. The Chinese did invent gunpowder, but they are not blamed
for the murder of billions of lives throughout history. Technology is
inanimate; it is not alive, so how could it or its creator be
accountable for anything someone does with it?

So, where does liability start? Someone invents a gun. No liability? Yet, to
have his patent accepted, he needs to produce a working model. So, he leaves
this working model and somehow is shot with the gun. Who is liable?

In the case of guns, the person who sell guns cannot escape liability.
Especially if the gun is sold to someone who is under age, has mental
problems or has previous convictions. That is the case in our current
&quot;social contract&quot;, which you seem to hold up as the measure of right
and wrong. Similarly, people cannot just leave loaded guns lying around
and expect that only the one who pulls the trigger will be held liable.

This is commonly accepted, due to the many cases where people have
become innocent victims of negligance.

In the case of new inventions, there is little that forces inventors to
take specific care, other than their conscience and common sense. A
pledge would encourage more care in this regard.

Please Sam, are you starting to change your view?...

"/> I think it begs to be said but, duh. That's why there is an
application process nowadays when you go to buy a gun. Gone are the
days where you could walk into a gun store and walk out with a loaded
.45. Backround checks are performed. If a gun is sold to a minor or a
mentally disabled person, then YES the salesman is liable. That is not
what i thought we were discussing here.
No matter what, the person who pulls the trigger will always be held at
fault, and rightly so.

If some small kid kills someone, the one who left the loaded gun on the
table should be held accountible, shouldn't he? Doesn't the law also enforce
some responsibility here?
In comparison, what responsibility does the law enforce upon inventors,
specifically scientists, who may create weapons of mass destruction that
members of any jury haven't heard about yet? Should we have to wait until
someone unleashed the power of their weapons before they can be held
accountible? How can such people be encouraged to take more responsibility?
Wouldn't a pledge be helpful in that regard?

Accountability- liable to being called to account; answerable.
Responsibility- a duty, obligation, or burden
For a doctor, they pledge to not murder. That's a black or white
pledge. All they have to do is not purposely kill their patients. How
can you make a pledge on a scientist? Whout would you say they can't
do? OK, no inventing weapons. That goes back to how Einstein
discovered Atomic Physics. He was excited about it with how much
advancement it would put in human kind; not thinking about killing
people. So, under your &quot;pledge&quot; rule, people like Einstein would have
been thrown in jail never to discover anything again. Well, his best
discoveries came after the war in my opinion.
All this &quot;pledge&quot; you speak of would do is limit a scientists full
potential. The people that invent all these new WMD, or whatever,
wouldn't sign the damn thing. If they did, and they worked for the
government; the government would just pardon them. A pledge would have
only a negative effect.

Well, but your example was the working model of something not yet
patented or introduced into society. So there would not yet have been
laws.

So don't jump on me for accepting the limits of your example. Once
somethign has diffused into society, we can write laws governing its
use and controlling its distribution. But at this point, the inventor
is not liable.

So in neither case are we holding the inventor responsible for use.

And I don't think your pledge idea is either sound or enforceable.

This is the same government who has contracted several American
scientists to develop a tactical nuclear device that can be legally
used on the field of battle, right?

I want to jump in here, but I need to provide a disclaimer up front. I
am a scientist. I have &quot;all but dissertation&quot; for a Ph. D. in physics
plus I have a Masters in engineering. I hold two patents and am a life
senior member of the IEEE. I am also a retired Navy officer. Now, I
could throw my weight around and claim that you must listen to me
because I have almost 40 years of experience in scientific development.
But, the truth is that there is almost as much variation in opinion
amoung scientists as there is between scientists and non-scientists.
So, I will sometimes attempt to bully you with &quot;appeals to authority -
me&quot; but my opinion is just that - my opinion.

Now, first off: There is no need to develop a working model in order to
get a patent.

"/> The gummint has a slick system: Weapons research is classified.
Anyone who divulges what goes on there is subject to imprisonment. So,
the courts will never get to judge because the financing and the
results belong to the gummint and those working in the field are thus
not subject to civilian authority with regard to their work.

Dave, appears that several of us must struggle not to assert our
credentials and be more patient with those judging systems and
institutions we have more experience with than they. Good luck on the
last mile of the journey.

The essence of the discussion appears to center around the question of
whether there needs to be some restriction on what a developer can or
can't pursue, and whether this person is accountable for how said
invention is used after it is brought to market.

I think that technology use is socially driven. We create needs and we
determine uses. Designers and scientists may seek solutions to problem
through their work, but ultimately it is he or she that uses the tool
created who must bear the responsibility for that tool's use.

Sam seems to think that there should be some kind of oath or pledge
that those who create new knowledge should take before pursuing an
endeavor.

But I think this is too vague and impractical. Who can say which values
are the best to uphold? Who can say before research is conducted what
they will agree to decide is the best course of action? Who can answer
ethical questions about a new technology before its abilities and
effects are discovered?

And where do we stop? Nuclear physicists? Engineers? Social scientists?
Religious scholars? All of these create new knowledge and new ideas,
much of which has powerful effects on our society.

I am still old school enough that I believe in the marketplace of
ideas. Let knowledge enter the marketplace freely and a society will
decide what is acceptable and what is not through law, commerce and
cultural values (in the form of social pressure).

Scientists should not all be social engineers (except for the social
engineers). Let them concentrate on their fields and let the users
decide how best to use and adopt their output.

"/>&gt;Sam

It is not a &quot;should&quot; or &quot;shouldn't&quot; thing. They would pardon someone
working for them, and they do it all the time. If you ever watch the
news and hear about some world leader dieing or getting captured, most
of the time it is due to &quot;a&quot; government. No matter what the new tells
you (most of it is lies, or not the whole truth), it is usally due to
something else. Criminals too are pardoned, if they decide to help the
government.
That was just an answer to your question.
To get back on topic; richard's views of an open market are, in my
opinion, the only way science and technology could ever function
properly. A scientist who invents a knife cannot and should not be
accountable for how someone uses it. Now if he takes his invention and
kills a view people, then hell yes, throw his ass in prison. If he
mass produces it though, and some jackass buys his knife and steals it,
then hell no that is not the inventers fault. Technology is something
that society should be left to decide whats rules are made about it.

All the scientist does is put the idea out there. Agree?
