Published: 28 July 2007

First published in 1908, a few months after the founding of the Boy
Scout movement, Scouting for Boys by Robert Baden-Powell went on to
become the 20th-century's fourth highest-selling book. It is no longer
used as a handbook by the Scout Association. Yet it still has a lot
more to offer to 21st-century children than we might imagine. These
extracts give a flavour of Baden-Powell's thinking ...

ON THE OUTDOOR LIFE

Camping is the joyous part of a Scout's life. Living out in God's open
air, among the hills and the trees, and the birds and the beasts, and
the sea and the rivers ... all this brings health and happiness such
as you can never get among the bricks and smoke of the town.

Hiking, too, where you go farther afield, exploring new places every
day, is a glorious adventure. It strengthens you and hardens you so
that you won't mind wind and rain, heat and cold. You take them all as
they come, feeling that sense of fitness that enables you to face any
old trouble with a smile, knowing that you will conquer in the end.

But, of course, to enjoy camping and hiking, you must know how to do
it properly ...

ON PITCHING CAMP

The best place for a camp is close by a wood where you have permission
to cut firewood and to build huts. So if you know of an owner in your
neighbourhood who may let you use a corner of his wood, there is your
chance ... Or you can go to mountains, moor, or river, and get
permission to pitch your camp.

In choosing the camp site, always think what it would be if the
weather became very rainy and windy. Choose the driest and most
sheltered spot, not too far away from your water supply. Remember that
a good water supply is of first importance. And make sure that your
drinking water is pure ... When you have chosen the spot for your
camp, pitch your tent with the door away from the wind. If heavy rain
comes on, dig a small trench about three inches deep all round the
tent to prevent it from getting flooded. This trench should lead the
water away downhill.

ON MAKING A SHELTER

If [a Scout] has no tent, he doesn't sit down to shiver and grouse,
but sets to work to rig up a shelter or hut for himself ... Notice the
direction from which the wind generally blows, and put the back of
your shelter that way, with your fire in front of it ... A bivouac
shelter is the simplest form of hut. Two upright stakes are driven
firmly into the ground, with a ridge-pole placed in position along the
tops. Against this a number of poles are made to lean from the
windward side, with crossbars to support the branches, reeds, sods or
twigs, or whatever is to form your roofing material ... When you start
to thatch your framework, begin at the bottom and lay your roofing
material in layers, one above the other in the way that slates are put
on a roof. In this way you make it watertight. For thatching you can
use thick evergreen branches, or grass, reeds, sods, bark or slabs of
wood (called &quot;shingles&quot;), or small twigs of heather closely woven in.
It is generally advisable to lay a few branches and stout poles over
the thatch when finished in order to keep it on if a gale springs up.

ON LEAVING CAMP

No Scouts ever leave a camp ground dirty. They sweep up and bury or
burn every scrap of rubbish. Farmers then don't have the trouble of
having to clean their ground after you leave, and they are, therefore,
all the more willing to let you use it again.

ON LOAFERS

A camp is a roomy place. But there is no room in it for one chap, and
that is the fellow who does not want to take his share in the many
little odd jobs that have to be done. There is no room for the shirker
or the grouser - well, there is no room for them in the Boy Scouts at
all, but least of all in camp. Every fellow must help, and help
cheerily in making it comfortable for all. In this way comradeship
grows.

ON MAKING A FIRE

Before lighting your fire ... remove all grass, dry leaves, bracken,
heather, from round the spot, to prevent the fire from spreading ...
The usual fault of a beginner is to try to make too big a fire. You
will never see a backwoodsman do that - he uses the smallest possible
amount of wood for his fire.

First collect your firewood. Green, fresh-cut wood is no good, nor is
dead wood that has lain long on the ground. Get permission to break
dead branches off trees for it ... To make your fire, you put a few
sticks flat on the ground, especially if the ground be damp. On this
flooring lay your &quot;punk&quot; - that is, shavings, splinters, or any other
material that will easily catch fire from your match. On this you
pile, in pyramid fashion, thin twigs, splinters, and slithers of dry
wood, leaning on the &quot;punk&quot; and against each other. These are called
kindling.

A good kind of kindling can easily be made by slitting a stick into
several slices or shavings. This is called a firestick. If stood up,
with the shavings downwards towards the ground, it quickly catches
light and flares up. A few stouter sticks are added over the kindling
to make the fire. Set light to all this, putting your match under the
bottom of the &quot;punk&quot;. When the wood has really got on fire, add more
and larger sticks, and finally logs.

ON MAKING FIRE WITHOUT MATCHES

The boy takes the spindle of hard wood and holding it upright with one
hand, the palm of which is protected by a wood or stone hand piece, he
twists it rapidly round by means of a bow whose string is twisted
round the spindle. The point of the spindle then works its way into a
board of soft wood, which the boy holds in place with one of his feet.

A slit at the side of the board leads to the hole made by the spindle,
and the hot ember which comes away from the wood falls into this small
opening and sets fire to the tinder which the boy has placed under it.

ON NOT GETTING LOST

When you start out for a walk or on patrol, note the direction by the
compass. Also notice which direction the wind is blowing; this is a
great help, especially if you have no compass, or if the sun is not
shining.

Every old Scout notices which way the wind is blowing when he turns
out in the morning.

To find the way the wind is blowing when there is only very light air,
throw up little bits of dry grass. Or hold up a handful of light dust
and let it fall. Or wet your thumb and let the wind blow on it; the
cold side of it will then tell you from which direction the wind
comes.

ON FINDING THE NORTH WITHOUT A COMPASS

At six o'clock in the morning Greenwich Mean Time the sun is east. At
nine it is south-east. At noon it is south. At three o'clock in the
afternoon it is south-west, and at six o'clock it is west. In winter
it will have set before six o'clock, but will not have reached west
when it is set ... To find the south at any time of day by the sun,
hold your watch flat, face upwards, so that the sun shines on it. Turn
it round till the hour hand points at the sun: allow for Summer Time
if it is in operation. Without moving the watch, lay a pencil or stick
across the face of the watch so that it rests on the centre of the
dial and points out half-way between the figure XII and the hour hand.
The direction in which it points is south. This applies only in the
northern hemisphere.

ON WEATHER

Every Scout ought to be able to read signs of the weather, especially
when going camping ... He should remember the following points: Red at
night, shepherd's delight (ie, fine day coming). Red in morning,
shepherd's warning (ie rain). Yellow sunset means wind. Pale yellow
sunset means rain. Dew and fog in early morning means fine weather.
Low dawn means fine weather. High dawn means wind (high dawn is when
the sun rises over a bank of clouds, high above the horizon). Soft
clouds, fine weather. Hard-edged clouds, wind. Rolled or jagged
clouds, strong wind.

ON DUTY

A Scout's duty is to be useful and to help others. And he is to do his
duty before anything else, even though he gives up his own pleasure,
or comfort, or safety to do it. When in difficulty to know which of
two things to do, he must ask himself, &quot;Which is my duty?&quot;; that is,
&quot;Which is best for other people?&quot; - and do that one. He must Be
Prepared at any time to save life, or to help injured persons. And he
must try his best to do at least one Good Turn to somebody every
day ...

A Scout is a friend to all, and a brother to every other Scout, no
matter to what country, class or creed the other may belong ...
Friends don't fight each other. If we make friends with our neighbours
across the sea in foreign countries, and if they keep friends with us,
we shan't want to fight. And that is by far the best way of preventing
future wars and of making sure of lasting peace.

Know your knots

[These] are useful knots which every Scout ought to know, and ought to
use whenever he is tying string or rope ... The best way to learn is
to get a fellow who knows to show you. You need to practise a lot, or
you will soon forget the knots.

THE REEF KNOT, for tying two ropes together under strain, as in tying
up a parcel. Being a flat knot, it is much used in ambulance work. The
best simple knot, as it will not slip and is easy to untie.

SHEET BEND, or common bend, for joining ropes of equal or unequal
thickness together. Make a loop with one rope and pass other end
through and around whole loop and bend it under its own standing part.

HALF HITCH, made by passing rope-end round standing part and behind
itself. If free end is turned back and forms a loop, the hitch can be
easily loosened. A round turn and two half hitches [illustrated] are
used for tying a rope to a spar.

THE BOWLINE, a loop that will not slip, to tie round a person being
lowered from a building, etc. Form a loop, then in the standing part
form a second, smaller loop. Through this pass the end of the large
loop and behind the standing part and down through the small loop.

Scouting for celebrities

Perhaps predictably, the Scouting movement has helped form many heads
of state, including Tony Blair and John Major and, overseas, Jacques
Chirac, George W Bush and Vaclav Havel. Nor is it surprising that many
adventurers, explorers and naturalists should have been Scouts, from
David Attenborough (&quot;It taught you self-discipline&quot;) to Richard
Branson (&quot;My Scouting days helped me to cope with adversity&quot;); or that
top sportsmen such as David Beckham and Andy Murray should have
enjoyed scouting; or even that chefs such as Antony Worrall Thompson
(&quot;To me it was 'How to set fire to things'&quot;) and Jamie Oliver should
have developed their cooking skills there.

What is perhaps more surprising is the number of ex-Scouts who have
gone on to reach the heights in fields of entertainment that might
have made Baden-Powell blanch. Liam and Noel Gallagher tend to play
down their Scouting days; but Jarvis Cocker remains so enthusiastic
that he donated the platinum disc for Pulp's Different Class for his
old Scout troop to auction. Other rock 'n' roll Scouts have included
Boy George, David Bowie, Keith Richards (who credits the experience
with teaching him the teamwork needed for performing in a band); and
Pink Floyd's Syd Barrett, who was a patrol leader. More controversial
ex-Scouts include Lord Archer (&quot;We had a quasi-uniformed discipline
that might be difficult these days&quot;) and Michael Barrymore.
