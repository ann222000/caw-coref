Living in the country, we are reminded every day that there is more
to life than the pursuit of income and the struggle to understand events
taking place in distant places.

There is an inexorable ebb and flow of wildlife activity that reminds
us that survival is an uncertain and risky business for those born
without opposable thumbs.

In the mornings, we see fawns like this one nibbling on new growth
just a few yards from our deck. In the late afternoons, we see herds of
deer silhouetted against the green meadow of a neighbor's field. These
graceful animals create the sense of a gentle pastoral existence.

However, in the long dark hours before dawn, we hear coyotes howling
in the woods around our house. The yelps and eerie howls that echo from
one quadrant are soon answered from another quadrant. This concert is
occasionally interrupted by the high-pitched screams of coyote prey and
the frantic yapping of the coyotes in at the kill.

Our cats no longer explore the nearby woods, which is a relief
because coyotes are fond of house pets as a change from their customary
diets. This USDA photo shows a coyote taking down a sheep, so I imagine
they take a toll of the deer in the area.

I need to investigate a huge brush pile which was created when we
cleared away trees for our house lot. I knew we were creating a habitat
for small animals, but we may have created a perfect setting for a
coyote den. If so, I will have to lay about with chain saw and shovel to
remove the coyote welcome mat.

These cunning &quot;singing dogs&quot; need to move out of our
immediate neighborhood because we have already noticed a significant
reduction in the chipmunk and rabbit population and one of our neighbors
has lost a couple of her cats. We don't have any cats to spare, so the
coyotes will soon be history, at least around here.

Keep an eye out for them as they are moving into heavily settled
areas now. Earlier this year, a coyote was captured in Central Park on
the island of Manhattan. Your neighborhood may be next.

Beautifully written, David, as well as giving me a dark chill. You
may recall (from my former blog) that we suffered the terrible loss of
Whitney, a young black lab pup, to a roving band of coyotes when we were
living near Asheville, NC. We did not know they had moved into the
ridgetop above our home. I'm not an alarmist,and respect the coyotes as
fellow creatures, but as human and wild animal habitats overlap and the
coyotes learn that pets make easy dinner, then our dogs, cats and other
small creatures become quite vulnerable.

In metro Atlanta, we recently lost a cat. Our guess is coyotes got
him. Though we do not hear them, they are in the area. In fact, GA
Wildlife says that coyotes can be found within every county of GA -
remote and densely populated. Good luck in your efforts to move them
from your area.

I once heard about a coyote that lived in a car park in Las Vegas and
survived off discarded donuts so they can live in urban areas. Foxes are
prevalent in Australia and an introduced pest. They were meant to
control rabbits but didn't do that well.

You observations resonate, David. We live just outside city limits
here in CO. With the foothills and a county-maintained open space only a
few miles away, we often hear coyotes in the evening, and have even
heard a mountian lion on one or two occasions. It's only prudent to keep
the cat indoors. Yet, I don't mind it, really. I like having nature that
close to my back door. I hope the coyote problem in your neck of the
woods takes care of itself. If it doesn't, and you have such a resource,
perhaps your county's Animal Control could provide assistance. Take
care, Linda

I would not worry about the coyotes as they are just a natural
predator doing what is needed and that is keeping populations of other
critters (rabbits, etc.) in balance. Your brush pile will attract and
protect many more rabbits than coyotes, so keep that in perspective. If
the coyotes keep you from sleeping and harrass all forms of pets, then
consider doing a little hunting. It is much more exciting than
marketing:)
