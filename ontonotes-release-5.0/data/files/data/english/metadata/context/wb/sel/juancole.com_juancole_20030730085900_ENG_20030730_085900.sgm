*Here's my post from Gulf2000 today:

What happened in Karbala this past weekend still seems a little
murky. I

am amazed that some enterprising reporter hasn't gotten the story out
(I

haven't seen a really good account in the Arabic press or the
Western).

Although it is murky, it is potentially much more significant than
the

deaths of Saddam's sons.

There was a demonstration on Saturday against Marine patrols coming
too

close to the shrine of Imam Husayn, among the holiest sites of Shiite

Islam. The demonstration turned ugly. The Marines fired tear gas, and

one cannister hit the shrine itself. Iraqi demonstrators maintained
that

the Marines killed one demonstrator. On Sunday the crowd assembled
again,

for another demonstration. It also turned ugly. About nine Shiites
were

wounded by US gunfire in front of the Imam Husayn Shrine. Another man
may

or may not have been killed, depending on which wire service you
follow.

The demonstrations were probably provoked by followers of Muqtada
al-Sadr.

The Marines maintain that the man who was killed was armed and had
fired

on them. I think it likely that someone did fire on them, to provoke
them

into injuring protesters. They fell for it.

Syed Saleem Shahzad, writing for the Asia Times, sees the

events in Karbala as part of a pattern of anti-US forces learning
ways of

provoking them and encourages popular discontent. He thinks its
emergence

in the South is an ominous sign, given the emergence of well
coordinated

guerrilla networks in the north. He maintains that the Pakistani
jihadi

organization Ansar al-Islam has infiltrated Kurdish regions and is

preparing attacks.

(See

http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Middle_East/EG30Ak02.html .

He adds of the Shiites:

"According to US authorities the emerging personality of firebrand
Moqtada

Sadr, a Shi'ite imam, is widely seen as a new threat in southern
Iraq. The

new administration is skeptical about his real designs as he does not
seem

to be interested in politics but to be motivated by extreme religious

obsessions. His followers consider him a mehdi (a promised messiah
before

the arrival of Christ, according to Islamic faith) and he seems to

encourage these trends. There are suspicions that he is stirring up

anti-US sentiment with his vehement speeches to further his religious

ends."

This is the first report I have seen of Muqtada being considered the

Mahdi, and it is possible, though I suspect it is a minority view. If

true, it confirms the sectarian character of his movement.

Ned Parker of AFP reports today that some of the problems derive from

misbehaving US troops, who are beating up suspects and over-reacting.

Some are frustrated, others just bullies. But it seems to me

that in Karbala the Marines were just tricked, with someone
deliberately

firing on them from the crowd or just beyond them, to produce this
result.

Shahzad says, ""A US official says: "The Islamic groups in Karbala
and

other southern cities have been advised to keep their demonsrations

peaceful and restricted. If these demonstrations continue to be
violent

and to be held every day, US forces would consider them as a threat
for

them and would be justified in taking action."

If the US military does not know better than to fire on civilian

protesters in front of the Shrine of Imam Husayn, it is a very, very
bad

sign for the future. Those nine wounded and one (or two) killed at
that

particular site have enormous anti-US propaganda value for the
Sadrists,

Hizbullah in Lebanon, and the hardliners in Iran. So far, urban
Shiites

have not proved willing to come out in a big way for the repeated
Sadrist

demonstrations, which have been 10,000 strong at most and more often
have

peaked at 2,500, in Baghdad, Najaf and Basra. But Shiites killed at
the

shrine of Husayn, that has the potential to get people out. It would
be

as though foreign occupying troops in New York shot down protesters
in

front the the Statue of Liberty.

I do not think the reaction will come in the short term. But people
are

going to start keeping accounts of grudges against the US if this
sort of

thing continues.

*Helena Cobban remonstrates gently with me at her Weblog over my
comment, "Look, I want the US to succeed in Iraq, just as I think all
responsible Americans do." She asks what I mean by "success" and whether
I think it is unpatriotic to hope for failure. Her comments are at:
http://justworldnews.org/

The bottom line is that I was very conflicted over the war in the
first place. I don't like wars, on principle, and think they should be a
last resort. The only wars I've wholeheartedly supported were the US
interventions against Milosevic in the Balkans (to stop a genocide
against Muslims and Croats), and the Afghanistan campaign, to get rid of
those horrific al-Qaeda training camps. Helena accuses me of a bit of
American triumphalism. I fear I am far too cynical and critical for
that. But I freely admit that September 11 had a big impact on me, and I
am a hawk in the war on terror. If I had been a younger man, I would
probably have joined the military on September 12. I know all about
blowback and the Reagan administration policies that helped set that
stage, but the practical task of keeping more buildings from being blown
up is in my view a noble and heroic one and I a make no apologies for
that much patriotism.

I don't think this Iraq war was a last resort, and I became
increasingly uncomfortable with the way the war fever was whipped up
with very dubious claims by powerful Iraqi expatriates and the right in
Washington. However, and this is the big "H," I have lived with Baathist
Iraq since I got into the Middle East field, and being a specialist in
Shiism and a friend to Iraqi Shiites meant that I knew exactly what the
Saddam regime had done to them. So, I refused to come out against the
war. I was against the way the war was pursued--the innuendo, the
exaggerations, the arrogant unilateralism. But I could not bring myself
to be against the removal of that genocidal regime from power.

Now that the war has taken place and Iraq is under Anglo-American
occupation (that is the legal situation according to the UN and even
according to US officials), it is important that Iraqis aren't
double-crossed yet again by the US. Americans, having caused the old
order to collapse, have a responsibility to nurture a new one before
they decamp. The new order should be a parliamentary democracy with an
independent judiciary and press. (Actually, both of the latter are
already showing signs of vigor). It would be unfortunate if Iraq were
just delivered to nouveau riche robber barons, as happened in
post-Soviet Russia. I am therefore heartened to hear that Bremer is
taking seriously the idea of an Alaska-style dividend for ordinary
Iraqis from the country's petroleum.

It would be highly irresponsible for the US military simply to
suddenly withdraw from the country at this juncture. I have called (on
national television, some months ago!) for the US to get a UN mandate
for its reconstruction efforts and to conduct them multilaterally. I
don't think this way of proceeding would in any way represent a US
failure in Iraq, quite the opposite. But internationalizing the effort
is different from leaving the Iraqis high and dry and at the mercy of
budding militias. Helena and I were both in Beirut, and I can't imagine
she wants that fate for the Iraqis. That is the sort of outcome that I
called "irresponsible." I didn't bring up anything about patriotism one
way or another.

As for the "white man's burden," the fact is that tens, maybe
hundreds of thousands of Iraqis, have died trying to overthrow the
Baath, and the war was spearheaded by the Iraqi expatriate community (4
million strong). My Iraqi neighbors in Dearborn staged a celebratory
march of 100,000 persons when Saddam fell. There is a real sense in
which Iraqis convinced the US to wage this war and rebuild their
country, at significant expense to the US. So I don't think 19th century
binary oppositions of a racial sort are really very helpful to analyzing
the situation, and they hold a real potential of depriving Iraqis of
their own agency. And, if you listen to Iraqis like Muhammad Bahr
al-`Ulum, they don't think that the UN or the 96% were terribly helpful
in stopping Saddam's genocide.

The evidence I have been able to gather suggests to me that the Iraqi
health system is back to functioning at a basic level, and that the
hospitals have been resupplied with medicines and equipment on the
whole. No one I know is suggesting that there is a medical health
emergency in Iraq. The sanctions regime had been manipulated by the
Baath so as to cause enormous harm to the health of Iraqi children, and
this harm is now ceasing. Iraq is now pumping over a million barrels of
oil a day, and there is reason to hope that it will be back up to
pre-war levels in the near future, providing income that can be used to
ensure public health, schooling, and so forth.

Helena asks three questions:

* 1. He seems to be arguing that a state of affairs in which Iraqis
can replicate India's success" would, for him, constitute a US "success"
in Iraq. Does he have any reason to believe that that goal is the one
that this US administration is actually pursuing there? In particular,
does he have any reason to believe that the political empowerment of the
Iraqis themselves is what the Bushites are aiming at?

I see camps in the Bush administration. Rumsfeld and Wolfowitz seemed
to want to just turn Iraq over to corrupt financier Ahmad Chalabi,
making him the Karzai of Iraq, without very much evident concern for
whether Chalabi would ever conduct free and fair elections. The State
Department and the CIA, in contrast, don't like Chalabi at all, and have
tried to sideline him. Bremer, who is closer to State, diluted Chalabi's
power. The Governing Council Bremer appointed would not even let Chalabi
address the UN, giving that privilege to Pachachi and Bahr al-`Ulum
instead. Bremer at first was going to try to be proconsul of Iraq for
two years, but the outbreak of guerrilla war in the Baathist/ Islamist
triangle forced him to give up some power in favor of an Iraqi
transitional governing council.

The upshot is that the Bushies are divided as to what they want in
Iraq, and that they probably can't have what they want, anyway. The best
exit strategy for Bush is now just to hold elections in 2004 before the
US elections, and turn power over to an elected Iraqi government. So,
yes, I think it now looks as though Bremer, Powell and Bush all favor
Iraq having a parliamentary democracy in the short term. I have no
illusions as to why they have ultimately tilted in this direction, but I
think they have. And if they don't, every evidence is that the main
Iraqi political forces will demand it in ways that the Americans will
find difficult to resist.

* 2. How does he assess the considerable weight of counter-evidence
that there is out there, regarding this administration's policies in
Iraq, elsewhere in the Middle East (where "empowerment" of local
pro-democracy forces seems nowhere to be on the effective agenda), or at
home here in the US (ditto)?

Things are changing, and Iraq policy represents a break with the past
efforts to shore up regimes like that of Mubarak in Egypt or the royal
family in Saudia. The Washington elite has decided that those regimes
are breeding Islamist terrorism that targets the US, and that they have
to be reformed in the direction of parliamentary democracy. Thus, it
seems to me clear that Musharraf held the Pakistani elections of
October, 2002, in large part under pressure from the US, and the recent
election in Bahrain was also supported by the US.

Of course, parliamentary governance can be more or less democratic.
Domestically, the Bushies favor a form of it that melds it with
plutocracy. (This is only possible, however, because the non-rich don't
bother to vote in sufficient numbers and so allow themselves to be
screwed over). I am not sure an Iraqi haute bourgeoisie unconnected to
the Baath even exists, and so it will be difficult for them to play the
plutocrat card in Iraq. Bremer had it explained to him that Iraq is a
welfare state, and if you just charge in and abolish all that, it will
make for trouble. Bremer is said to have been convinced. As I said, I
don't think the outcome is entirely his to decide, anyway (it is not
clear that Gen. MacArthur was trying to produce a corporatist state in
Japan, either).

All I would say is that parliamentary governance is a good start, and
it is a system that has the potential to become more democratic if the
people become exercised enough about it, whereas the Baath Party was
just going to go on producing its mass graves and destroying the Marsh
Arabs, etc. If the no-fly zone had been dropped by the US, the Kurds
would have been massacred in an instant.

3. Equally or even more importantly: How about the precedent set for
Iraqis, for that 96 percent of the world's people who are not US
citizens--and for the four percent of us who are US citizens-- if the US
administration is seen as "successful" in imposing its will on the
actions of a large and distant sovereign nation purely through the force
of arms and the waging of a war that was quite unjustified by any
criteria of "just war" or international law?

If the US acted illegally in international law, then the
international community should punish it. (In fact, the refusal of
India, Egypt, France and Germany to send troops despite US pleading is
already a form of punishment). But the Iraqi people do not deserve to be
punished, and the rebuilding of the country so that it ends up being a
parliamentary democracy with a free press and an independent judiciary
would be a good thing for Iraqis, the world, and even for the US.

My main concern is that a success in Iraq not encourage further
adventurism. I think, however, that the furor over the missing WMD, the
outbreak of the guerrilla war, and the unexpectedly high costs of the
Iraqi occupation have made it rather unlikely that Congress will give
out any carte blanches for going on to Damascus and Tehran. I don't
think it is very likely that the neocons are actually going to get what
they wanted in Iraq. Pachachi has already said that Baghdad won't
recognize Israel until the Arab League does. The forthcoming Iraqi
parliament is going to have lots of Sunni and Shiite Islamists in it.
The Lebanese Hizbullah is likely to pick up parliamentary allies. This
looming failure of the project may disillusion the architects of it,
themselves.

I suppose I just think the world is complex, and even wrong-headed
actions can sometimes have beneficial outcomes. I don't deny that it is
entirely possible that the Iraq adventure will go very badly wrong, and
then you get Lebanon 1975-1989 or Iran 1978-79. I just personally hope
that doesn't happen.
