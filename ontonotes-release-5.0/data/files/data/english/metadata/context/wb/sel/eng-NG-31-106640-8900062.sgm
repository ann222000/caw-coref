Does anyone need creative nail racks?  They are the steel colored ones sitting on a oak base.  Very classy.

Has three rows, each row has 6 spaces.  Would hold 18 different colors.  Each space holds two bottles.  So actually holds 36 of them.

Free to who ever wants them,,,,,,,,ah free day today huh Kammie!!!!!!!!!!! Pay shipping and they are yours.  If three different people want them fine.

Threw a bunch of stuff away, had some homeless guy going thru the stuff when I cam home from the Goodwill  place .jeez, was taking the quarter used bottles of lotion!!!!!!!!!!!! LOLOL diana from indiana
