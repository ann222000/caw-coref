Hi, I was rounding the Guadalupe Mountains once, on a two-lane road, at
dusk (the sunset was absolutely awesome), running about 85 and a large
buck mule deer suddenly appeared in the middle of the road.

There was no other traffic for miles and this guy decides to challenge
me by putting his horns down directly towards me. You have to
understand the terrain to appreciate this, because it's open country
for many miles. On the right (East) Desert, cactus and scrub brush; on
the left (West) a mountain range.

I've been Blessed to have never having had an accident on two or four
wheels (Guardian Angel). I simply did evasive maneuvers and grabbed a
whole lot of brake (front &amp; rear disc). I think the Buck lost interest,
because he continued his saunter into the Desert area to graze.

I found a little Texas Motel to sleep in, because there's Mountain
Lions in the Guadalupe and I was alone.

Ted
