&quot;Some of this data was used to prepare a clarification request submitted
to the FIA, aimed clearly at us, given that throughout the Melbourne
weekend, McLaren team principal and his closest colleagues made
statements in which they threw doubt over 'some cars'.

&quot;Therefore, such information was in fact used to obtain an advantage
over us: not through an improvement in their performance, but instead
through limiting ours.&quot;

So, Ferrari are pissed because the information passed to McLaren stopped
them [Ferrari] cheating.

McLaren convinced the powers that be the rule should be interpreted in a

It is wrong and must not be allowed because it is subjecting one team to a

Exactly.  Throw in some blatant political games and suddenly Ferrari's

I've never had the slightest respect for Todt, and this latest round of
underhanded politics and deliberate disinformation sure doesn't improve
my opinion.  Some have suggested that this whole mess may reach critical
mass and blow up in his face.  One can only hope.

They did no such thing. They took a very neutral &quot;What would be your
view if we ran this&quot; stance. And the response from the FIA was that
without any clarifications needed, the design quite obviously broke the
rules. Not bent them. Not exposed a loophole that needed plugging. But
was a quite obvious and blatant illegality. As many informed
commentators on F1 had already observed.

I am afraid you are misunderstanding what has happened. The component
they are referring to, as I am sure you know, is the bottom component
of the F2007. This component has since been outawed, however it was
perfectly legal, as attested by the FIA, while in use by the Scuderia
Ferrari. It is a mistake to claim that Ferrari were cheating. They
followed the rules, and their car was checked by the FIA using
regulamentary tests, which certified the car as legal. After McLaren
protested, the FIA decided, for their own reasons, to chancge the
rules on the component, and Ferrari aknowlged the fact without
protesting, and modified its car.

Well, I would agree if it wasn't for a couple of facts... Michelin
retired from formula one due to problems with the FIA governing body,
and because the FIA was going towards single supplier, it wasn't
Ferrari who got Michlin tires to be outlawed, they may (I do not
recall but may very well be mistaken) have expressed complaints about
it, but they were definitelly not instumental to the decision. On top
of this, why are you trying to defend somone I did not explicitly or
implicitly attack? I do not beleave any Michelin team cheated during
the previous championships.

A good retort to my post, if there was a need of one, would have been
to remember the Renault's Mass Damper, however even there  do not
beleave the team cheated, even though it was possibly a wee bit more
shady than the bottom.

I don't interpret the extract in that way. In fact I don't think it makes
sense.

As long as Ferrari and McLaren develop their cars within the rules, how
could McLarens possession of Ferrari data give them an advantage, or limit
Ferraris development?

Reading between the lines, suggests to me that Ferrari are/were, maybe
bending the rules slightly, hence the use of the report by McLaren to ask
the FIA for clarification.

What it seems to come down to IMO, is that Ferrari don't like McLaren using
the data to draw attention to areas of the Ferrari cars that 'might' be
contravening the regulations.

AIUI though 'all' the teams try to get an edge on performance within the
rules, so it's a given that occasionally they'll push those rules a little
too far, so unless it's blatant, I don't think any team can really be blamed
for trying to find something that will give them an advantage, and that
includes Ferrari.

Had they really explicitly breached a regulation, the FIA would have
prosecuted and penalised them. Fundamentally, what happened is that
McLaren, in a technical request to the FIA officials, requested the
possibility of adding such a component, raising some suspition as
wether it was allowed or not. In the end, what happened was a change
in the testing regulations &quot;From round two in Malaysia such devices
must be removed before the car undergoes the floor deflection test.&quot;

In all cases where there was a technical cheat, the teams were heavily
penalised, and that combined with a lack of even a reprimand to
Ferrari shows they were not cheating.

I'm not saying you can cheat if you can hide it (even though the FIA
just sanctioned that Thursday in Paris), I'm just saying that it is
silly to summerise this whole story by saying that Ferrari is just
moaning due to it's lost (inexistent) cheat.

F1 is such a nice sport it's very annoying to see it so burdened by
fruitless accusations and hatred.

The rule specified the max width of the tyre. It was found that they
increased as they warmed up. Now If they had measured the modified ones
while going round at speed, I'm sure they would have been wider then
permitted. Hence giving larger contact area and grip.

consistently pro-cash, that's all, they look at the short term

Not that enormous really, and completely unavoidable when absolutely
everyone was saying that it was a deliberate and blatant cheat that
could not be allowed to stand. Just because they *did* get punished for
one of the most blatant and public displays of cheating in the whole
history of Formula 1 does not mean that they have not got away with one
hell of a lot.

The English stealing from Ferrari? I notice that they say &quot;Ferrari&quot;, and
not &quot;the Italians&quot;, since the team is what it is because of the English,
the Germans and the French as much as the Italians. That's why so many of
us love them so much - we can all be proud of them.

This spying thing is all just Journalist fodder: It's been going on for
yonks in various guises. Every team will try to find out what they can
from others and every team will try to protest everything done by other
teams if they think there's an advantage in it. Why do people think the
teams use double glazing in their motorhomes? It's not to save the planet
from &quot;Carbon&quot;, it's to stop other teams being able to listen in on them
by bouncing laser beams off the windows.

&gt; I am afraid you are misunderstanding what has happened. The component
&gt; they are referring to, as I am sure you know, is the bottom component
&gt; of the F2007. This component has since been outawed, however it was
&gt; perfectly legal, as attested by the FIA, while in use by the Scuderia
&gt; Ferrari. It is a mistake to claim that Ferrari were cheating. They
&gt; followed the rules, and their car was checked by the FIA using
&gt; regulamentary tests, which certified the car as legal. After McLaren
&gt; protested, the FIA decided, for their own reasons, to chancge the
&gt; rules on the component, and Ferrari aknowlged the fact without
&gt; protesting, and modified its car.

&gt; Now, in this whole story, where did Ferrari cheat?
">

Top Gear did a report a while back on how fast a car has to be going
through a speed-camera before the speed camera simply can't catch the
offence.  I can't recall how fast this was.

So, if the test is &quot;are you caught by the speed camera&quot; are you
breaking the law by going through at that pace?  Of course you are.

It doesn't matter if the test is ineffective in proving the violation
if the violation still occurs (albeit undetectably).

That's what happened with the sprung floor.  The inherent design was
such that it would always pass the test, but strictly reading the
rules it was also always illegal.

I used to work at Shalford, and Cateshall Lane, and at Woking and later
at both Farnborough and Bedford so I have a decent knowledge of the
extent of UK involvement in F1, sadly most Italians don't they really
think of Ferrari as 100% Italian. So I suspect that the use of Ferrari
doesn't signify much other than the Italian belief that Ferraris is
*the* Italian national team.

Still, made oi larff, the current hysteria in the Italian press.

I'm not sure how the pages were intended to work, but I wanted to check
if the places I stay near Modena and Monza were listed.

Oddly enough, I usually stop at a five star hotel on Lake Como, but this

While I was working at a wind tunnel, shared by several teams, I saw the
paranoia in full flow. After a succesful series of tests there was the
usual cheese, wine and whatever reception for all involved. One of our
engineers had a bit too much champers and the team tech. manager was
chatting to him and said &quot;I notice (xxx) team is here next week, but
they only have a week booked and we needed three weeks to do our tests.
Why do they only need a week?&quot; Engineer being pissed cracked a joke. &quot;Oh
that's easy we'll give them your results and that will speed up their
testing.&quot;

You could hear a pin drop.

The subsequent investigation took the best part of a year, with every
single line of code, set of disks, computers, procedures, network etc
beign analysed to make damn sure we hadn't exported data to anyone other
than the team that had commissioned the work. Very unpleasant
experience.

Not that job. He was promoted sideways, and I suspect a little bit
downwards as well. I can recall meeting where someone said &quot;He's good at
his job, just don't ever let him loose near a customer.&quot; Which was
fairly accurate.

&gt;Top Gear did a report a while back on how fast a car has to be going
&gt;through a speed-camera before the speed camera simply can't catch the
&gt;offence.  I can't recall how fast this was.

&gt;So, if the test is &quot;are you caught by the speed camera&quot; are you
&gt;breaking the law by going through at that pace?  Of course you are.

&gt;It doesn't matter if the test is ineffective in proving the violation
&gt;if the violation still occurs (albeit undetectably).

&gt;That's what happened with the sprung floor.  The inherent design was
&gt;such that it would always pass the test, but strictly reading the
&gt;rules it was also always illegal.
">

It would appear that scrutineering did not disclose the illegality, and
that when the FIA ruled on the McLaren-submitted design, they
effectively turned a blind eye, saying &quot;It is illegal, so don't let us
catch anyone using it&quot;. They had no concrete proof that anyone had used
an illegal floor, but they made it clear that they would be looking for
it and would penalise it, so Ferrari and others changed the designs back
to something legal.

Now in his recent statements, Todt has stated publicly on the record
that Ferrari ran an illegal car. I know that the precedent of the
bargeboards shows how little that can mean, but there does seem to have
been a change of wind direction now, and if the FIA has decided that its
pro-Ferrari stance has run its course, it is quite possible that the FIA
could take action against them based on the admission.

What exactly does/did this &quot;sprung floor&quot; do?  I'm not
questioning its illegality on contravention of the regs -- just
interested to know how it would have contributed to increasing
the car's performance...

The floor was tested to not bend at 500Nm pressure.
If you have a solid fitted floor, it may flex slightly, but will not
move much more if the pressure is higher at racing speeds, because the
bolts will not allow it to flex any more.
However, if you have it fitted onto springs, the springs will allow
some movement as they compress and then some more as the floor
flexes(just as the bolted ones do) when the springs bottom out.
A couple of mms of anything in F1 could mean a much better aero
efficiency and of course performance..

the simplest difference I can imagine is that, it permitted the
floor to move more, independently of the rest of the body, under
loads higher than those tested. Thus when it got kicks from kerbs,
the rest of the car would move less. So you stay pointing in the
right direction longer, and with your tyres in contact with the
ground longer.

Allegedly, it flexes to reduce the amount of air going under the car,
reducing the downforce and drag from the aero package at high speeds. At
the beginning of the year some teams top speeds were apparently
questionable given their cornering ability at the same time - IOW they
appeared to change aero characteristics with speed, something that
implies moveable aero parts.
