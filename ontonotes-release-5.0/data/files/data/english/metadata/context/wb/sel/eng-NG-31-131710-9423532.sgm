Just got back from seeing VH at the Staples Center, it's after 1 in the
morning.

Had some Jacks and smoked a joint before I went in with my bro.

Bought a couple of beers for about $10 before finally sitting down.

Never saw any VH blimps, VH started without any announcement.

I didn't think it was too loud at all, at least my ears aren't ringing, but
then again, I was sitting half way down on Wolfies side in the nosebleeds.
The mix seemed to favor the high end with very little midrange and bass.
Sometimes I could barely hear Roth sing, but it was consistent and didn't
seem to change througout the show. Never heard Roth say &quot;Turn it up&quot; or seen
Eddie throw any tantrums.

Seemed pretty text book to me. Musically, they were great. Roth's voice
never sounded closer to the records than tonight. If you like VH just for
the music and not a fan of DLR's gab, this was the concert for you. Dave
definitely still can sing.

They went from one song into another with no interuption until two hours had
passed. Almost like they wanted you to be impressed that at 50 yo, they
could still still bring it without stopping for air.

Nobody sat down till Alex's solo. The only other two times were during I'll
Wait and Ed's solo.

Wolfie seemed fine to me. He didn't take away from anything, although his
bass seemed to buried in the mix.

Ed's solo seemed kinda short to me. Basically 316, Women in love intro,
Cathedral and Eruption. Don't believe I saw Ed and Dave hug each other at
all during the concert like they have been.

Not much interaction with the audience, besides Dave's Ice Cream Man intro.
The crowd seemed to be begging to be talked to, every time Dave would ask
them a question like &quot;Everybody having a good time?&quot; the crowd would erupt.
Overall a loud and receptive crowd.

It was a two hour show, but seemed like only an hour. Smelt a lot of herb
being smoked throughout, made me wish I'd brought some in.

I've seen Dave with Van Halen 4 times in the 80's, sadly, this show was
nowhere near close to the special concerts I remember.

Overall, a very tight and veteran band that still has it and better than
anything else out there, but if you're going to find or re-live your youth,
you won't find it.

A few times I wondered what it would have been like with Sammy singing, with
him signing autographs and giving a half-assed performance. It made me
appreciate their effort even more. It was good to see VH firing on all
cylinders.

I'm also glad I got to see Vh in the 80's, it's something that will never be
duplicated and this concert made me appreciate that experience even more.

Maybe it's different for those that have seen VH though the years with Hagar
and Cherone, I'm sure this concert ripped apart the 2004 tour, but I haven't
seen VH since 1984, so they had a lot to live up to. I think it's the next
tour that will be what we've been waiting for. They still seem like a new
band still feeling each other out, albeit with a huge catalogue.

All I can say is bring on the album, I'm sure it will be great. Van Hagar
RIP!

I  take it they ditched the silly huge microphone Roth was bouncing around
on in the early shows. The Zeppelins too.

Sure didn't need em and that giant Dildo microphone was downright goofy.

Unfortunately, these guys (except for Wolfgang) aren't getting any younger.
And what they did between 78 and 84 was something that could not be planned
nor be recreated.  Anybody who witnessed the band during that era was lucky
enough to be part of something special.  But those days are gone and some
things we cannot change.

Did you meet TB at the show?

And all because I crossed his Mike Anthony picket line!

Yeah, we drank outside in the halls and checked out the merchandise and
people.

When we finally sat down, VH came on within a couple of minutes, I guess
that's why I didn't see any blimps.

Yep, and everyone went wild when he mentioned Pasadena.

It was the closest they came to acknowledging this was their home.

Oh yeah, that too, but it's not so much because of thier age, it's more that
they just got back together and threw a greatest hits tour together.

The stage seems very generic and I didn't like the &quot;S&quot; at all. They should
also hang a giant VH logo in the back (although hard with the monitor).

Before, the stage would tie in to the latest album, this time there was no
album to tie into and they seemed to lack an atmosphere they had before.

That's why to me they seemed like a new super band that formed that's still
trying to find it's image.

The atmosphere, the attitude and the interaction of the old shows was what
was missing, the music was as good as ever.

It could also be the drugs I took back then before the shows were a lot
stronger as well!

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Did you meet TB at the show?

Yeah, I looked down from the other end of the arena and scanned the fifth
row and saw a head that might be his and yelled &quot;TB!&quot;

Don't know if he heard me though...

I may have missed the blimps, as I didn't get to my seat until just minutes
before the show started.

The big inflatable mic was there, only DLR did not ride it from what I could
tell.

Maybe he didn't want to fall on his ass like a few concerts ago.

Same with the Unchained &quot;chains&quot;. He picked them up from the drum riser and
held them up momentarily as to say &quot;look, here's the chains you saw on
youtube&quot; and dropped'em like he didn't care about them anymore.
