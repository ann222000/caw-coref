Developmental biology: Gender switch

Nature Genet. doi:10.1038/ng1907 (2006)

Researchers have discovered a gene in humans that, when mutated, causes
embryos with a female complement of sex chromosomes to develop as
males.

Giovanna Camerino of the University of Pavia in Italy and her
colleagues studied a family in which four brothers each had two Xs
instead of the normal male complement (XY). Most female-to-male sex
reversals result when the X chromosome inherited from the father
accidentally acquires a part of his Y chromosome, carrying a gene
called SRY. But the brothers had no copies of SRY at all. Instead, they
had a mutation in a gene called RSPO1.

The team suggests that RSPO1 normally helps to drive the developing
gonad to become an ovary. In its absence, genes promoting the formation
of a testis take over
