For those who don't subscribe, there's an interview with Sir Ian (or Serena,
as he calls himself at times...) including a bit on why he didn't want to
play Dd http://www.guardian.co.uk/weekend/story/0,,2214703,00.html

Quote:
When the offer came in to play Gandalf in Peter Jackson's Lord Of The Rings,
lots of fine British actors had already turned it down, including,
reportedly, Anthony Hopkins and Sean Connery. How they must be cursing
themselves now. The success of the films has made McKellen not only richer,
but celebrated to a degree that gives him freedom to do more of what he
wants. The role must have been a walkover - Gandalf speaks with a
Shakespearean intonation but without the difficult sentence structure. I
wonder if he has discussed how to play a wizard with his friend Michael
Gambon, who does Dumbledore over in the Harry Potter franchise. &quot;Funnily
enough, we never have.&quot; He grins.

Who'd win if it came to a ruck? McKellen puffs out his chest. &quot;Gandalf. Of
course. People say to me, don't you wish you'd played Dumbledore? I say no!
I played Gandalf! The original. There was a question as to whether I might
take over from Richard Harris [Gambon's predecessor in the Dumbledore role],
but seeing as one of the last things he did publicly was say what a dreadful
actor he thought I was, it would not have been appropriate for me to take
over his part.&quot; He smiles icily. &quot;It would have been unfair.&quot;

Looks like there wasn't much love lost between them. Shame though - it would
have kind of fitting to have Sir Ian playing Dd!

After Rowling's recent revelations about DD, Sir Ian seems even more

I believe O'Toole appears to be closer to death than Harris was. Up
until the battle in the MoM, Harris was or would have been fine. Not to
mention having to swim in the cold sea to a cave. I don't believe either
could have convincingly portrayed the decline in health after the curse
of the ring horcrux. I'm no Gambon fan and perhaps other people here
will also be better able to accept seeing _him_ blown off of the
lightning struck tower. For me, it would all be over if anything were to
happen to Rickman.

With his performances in POA and GOF to go by McKellin would have been
vastly better in the role.  Gambon has redeemed it somewhat in OOTP but I
think the damage has already been done to the movies.

I am baffled by all the antipathy to Gambon. But it will not be Gambon
or anybody being blown off a tower, it will be a CGI effect.

That's sort of what I was alluding too, lol.

Though according to Dan, since JKR outed Dd, Gambon has been camping it up
on set (hard to see how he could camp it up much more, being yet another
&quot;Grand Olde English Actorr&quot; - pretty much the personification of camp!)

Haven't you ever seen a movie in which someone appears to be shot,
or fall from a height?  Remember the duel scene in Chamber of
Secrets?  Lockhart was thrown off the table and against the wall
with no CGI involved.  There are all kinds of ways to get the
effect safely without using CGI.

Having the same actor playing to &quot;similar&quot; characters would just have
been confusing so despite the fact he would have made a jolly good
Dumbledore I feel it is best he did not take the part.

I just wish Gambon hadn't taken the part either!

We can only hope...

But given that most people think HBP was a very poor book, that Gambon
pretty much ruined the role of Dd in PoA and GoF, how pants the film OotP
was, and that it's the same director for HBP, I'm not exactly optimistic. As
Aaron says, this probably will be the first time Gambon decides to add
something to the character that wasn't in the script (nor in the books but
that won't stop him) - he'll probably decide that's a great &quot;source of
sub-textual motivation&quot; or something...

I'd love to say I'm not even going to bother going to see HBP - but I know I
will, lol.
