I recently discovered Vassal. It's a tool that makes it possible for
folks to play board style wargames online. It looks like something that
might be useful. Lots of modules for it too.

Anyone use this tool?
What do you think about it?

Without stepping into another board wargame vs computer wargame debate
here, I'll say that yes, I use VASSAL almost exclusively for gaming
now days (currently pbem'ing &quot;Fire in the Sky&quot; and ASL (using VASL -
www.vasl.org )).  I have 13 modules uploaded to the site that I've made
and another 4 or 5 that I'm working on (in various states of
completion).  The program is well supported with new features being
added all the time (it just recently went through a major upgrade from
version 2.99 to 3.0x).  VASSAL was the tool that made me go back and
look at my old board wargames- which has led to some compulsive
shopping for new games.  :)

Also, check out Cyberboard: http://cyberboard.brainiac.com/ and
ZunTzu: http://www.zuntzu.com .  The latter program has particularly
interested me with it's smooth scrolling, zoom and animated dice
features.  Very well done program - doesn't support pbem play though
unfortunately.

Very good tool.  A bit rough around the edge and slow at times, but
for the price you pay, it's OK (note : it's free).

I used it only once for a game of LnL.  It's as close as you can get
to FtF.  I know some people combines it with some audio connection
tools like Skype or TeamSpeak for a better experience.

And I also recommend the two (free again) software recoomended by GJK.
Cyberboard is a bit more crude, but has a lot of supporters in the
PBEM crowd AFAIK.
I haven't tested ZunTzu yet, but I heard a lot of good things about
it.

Cheers,

JeF.

I'm a big Vassal user and supporter.
I'm currently playing a few games of ASL, Monmouth and Europe
Engulfed.
I've contributed a few modules and have worked on the base code to
clean up image scaling.  Added a few features such as the &quot;Map View&quot;
function, I think I stole the little globe icon from some old version
of Mosaic.  ;)
I hate having to sit and wait for my opponent to make decisions in
face to face play.  At least with Vassal I can go somewhere else while
I'm waiting, much more time efficient.

Sadly, the code base is somewhat clunky and hard to decipher;
Features which really should be easy to add can be painfully time-
consuming.  As much as I love Java, for apps such as this I think the
platform specific .NET would have been better suited.

Well, the most recent article on The Wargamer neatly fits this thread

http://www.wargamer.com/articles/on_board_10/

It's about how Vassal rejuvenated an old boardgame favourite and how
it let players build an online community / gaming group.
