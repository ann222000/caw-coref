Water-dropping aircraft yesterday attempt to extinguish a fire that
broke out at the foot of Mount Hymettus, eastern Athens. The cause of
the blaze was not immediately clear but police are investigating the
possibility of arson after witnesses said they saw several fires start
at once.

A forest fire that broke out early yesterday afternoon at the foot of
Mount Hymettus, in eastern Athens, was contained after threatening
several houses, a children's home and a military base. No injuries or
damage to buildings was reported.

Thick black smoke engulfed much of the capital as the fire spread
quickly, fanned by strong winds reaching up to 8 on the Beaufort
scale. Police closed off a kilometer stretch of Katehaki Avenue, a
major road linking the suburbs to the city center, causing traffic
chaos. Some districts near the fire were hit by cuts to power and
water supplies.

It was unclear what started the blaze but authorities were
investigating the possibility of arson after several witnesses claimed
to have seen several fires breaking out at the same time.

The fire was extinguished within three hours following a mammoth
rescue effort involving six water-dropping aircraft, three helicopters
and some 100 firefighters. The fire service remained on standby last
night to extinguish a possible rekindling.

During their efforts to contain the blaze, firefighters discovered a
weapons cache which had been hidden in the forest. The cache included
a Kalashnikov assault rifle, a hand grenade, a shotgun and several
rounds of ammunition. Police could not say where the weapons had come
from or who may have hidden them.

Several other fires were reported around Greece yesterday, including
blazes in northern Evia and in Pelasgia, in Fthiotida prefecture.There
were also fires on Kos and in Pirgos, western Peloponnese.

In Cyprus, a large fire forced the evacuation of two villages in the
island's south, between the resorts of Larnaca and Limassol. There
were no reports of any injuries.

According to forestry experts, the fact that Attica's forests have not
been purged of garbage, weeds and other flammable substances helps
fuel fires. &quot;There is no forest management and so every time we have
conditions like those today, a large fire is inevitable,&quot; said
Aristotelis Papageorgiou, a forestry expert at the University of
Thrace.
