Why do most cars not have any hood vents?   In the summer the temp under
the hood is very high.  (If you want proof, just raise the hood after a
summer trip)

Wouldn't it make more sense to design hood vents into every car?
Wouldn't the entire under hood  area benefit if the max temp was
significantly lower?  I had a Datsun 280Z and it had a hood vent.  It
was designed not to let rain water come in.

Installing one myself would be costly, require some repainting, and
prone to rust.

Several reasons - first, you don't want the underhood bits getting wet.
Yes, I know you had a car that was &quot;designed not to let rain water
come in&quot; but it eventually will.  Secondly, you have to have pretty good
control over the underhood fluids to keep Bad Things from happening to
your windshield (the latter learned the hard way while stuck in traffic
in a '53 Studebaker with a louvered hood and no &quot;catch can&quot;)

If underhood heat is a real concern - and it does not appear to be in
most cases - fender vents would be much more practical.

Well you hit on a few of the good reasons they don't do it right
there....

I live in sunny FL so it isn't a problem for me but I understand that
for those who live in the frigid north (anything above the GA state
line if you ask me) snow build up on a hood that isn't flat can be
quite a problem as it is hard to clear.

Under-hood temperatures were a problem when they sealed the cooling
system and went to higher temp thermostats, many years ago.  Many
elastomers were inadequate tor the higher temps.  Fuel lines broke and
there were a rash of engine fires.  Electronics, just coming on board,
failed a lot.

The car mfgrs answer, rather than lower the environment temperature,
was to develop higher temp elastomers and electronics.

Airflow can be tricky; in front of the windshield is a high pressure
area. (look at the cowl induction gadgets). Those old MGs with little
vents in the tops of the fenders; even that far forward, it turns out
that they ended up pushing air into the engine bay.
