Good sign. This is exactly what the CF should be doing at home.

For those who scoff at the small numbers of military involved, not even the
US could put much larger numbers into that environment, not without great
cost. For starters, any non-prepared troops will die or be cold casualties -
end of mission. You need to handpick and/or prepare your people, just like
the Chinese did with their war with India, when they quartered thousands of
troops on the Tibetan plateau for months to get them ready to go even
higher.

It'll be interesting to see what the Danes make of this. As for the US
(speaking in my schizo role as a Canadian) I'd be after setting up some
passive/active sonar belts in the Archipelago, and considering global
warming, I'd even start thinking about setting up some coastal defense
stations with SSMs.

I recently had an interesting conversation with a manager from First
Air, the airline owned by the Inuit. He had been to Greenland on a
charter and found that the Greenlanders' reaction to the presence of
Canadians ranged from wariness to downright hostile -- unless the
Greenlander was an Inuk, in which case the reaction was pretty
friendly. Apparently many of Greenlanders of Scandinavian descent
think we covet their rock and ice.

It's not like we ever did anything hostile in that neck of the woods,
like occupy Iceland... oh, sorry, we did do that. Oh, well.

That reaction _is_ interesting. It surprises me some, anyway.

I suppose some Canadians do covet their (the Greenlanders') rock and ice,
and maybe also some Americans, but by and large it's a matter of us
protecting our own rock and ice. I think the sovereignty patrols we have
been running the past few years are excellent - they serve a number of
important functions:

1) it shows that we're interested;
2) it gets reg force CF working with Rangers a lot more;
3) it starts building up a core group of people that can operate in that
terrain.

The latter point can't be over-emphasized. Most Canadian military come from
the inhabited belt near the US border, and they don't spend their formative
years before enlistment trapping and snaring, logging, and going out at 3 AM
on a Cape Islander to haul traps. In short, they have experience of the cold
like very many Americans do - the US has a much larger pool of people to
draw on that have equal temperate winter experience.

4th MEB - when it was still the USMC contribution to Norway - found it
necessary to put us through a 3-4 month workup just to get us ready to
operate in northern Norway. Having done that, it surely must have put the
Soviets on notice that if they tried to take that terrain they'd have a
serious fight on their hands.

Similarly, with all due respect to CF units - both regular and reserve -
nobody seriously believes that they can fight in the Arctic until they
demonstrate an operational capability to deploy there, and do extended ops.
The Germans had a beastly time of it in the winter of '41-'42, but they had
villages and woods they could lodge in - try doing that in the Canadian
Arctic.

I know that the Danish navy currently is beating us in terms of operating up
in that neck of the ice. We'll likely not match them there any time soon.
But in the meantime we can build and demonstrate a capability to deploy
platoons and companies to any island in the archipelago - not just cannon
fodder, but people that can fight there for an indefinite period.

One thing the Greenlanders know is that their survival, when it comes to the
difficult stuff or that which comes up on short notice, depends on what they
can get from Canadian sources. If you need the sort of surgery you can only

In cases where the hospitals in Greenland cannot cope, the patients

I was also puzzled by Andrew's statement, since the whole of Greenland's
public sector is heavily based on the Danish model. It's also financed
by Denmark, so sending patients to Denmark (approx. 4 hours from the
main airport at Sønder Strømfjord) is far cheaper than sending them to
Canada.
Then there is the language thing - most of the population speak Danish
as well as Greenlandic, but only a minority speak English (or Canadian
for that matter.....).

Greenland is generally trying to get closer links to Canada &amp; the US,
especially in the tourist trade, but there is quite a way to go yet.

Nuuk has a fairly large hospital (DIH) that acts as a central
hospital for Greenland. There are about 12-15 local hospitals.

Patients that need very specialised medical care or surgery are usually
transferred to
Rigshospitalet in Copenhagen.

Psychiatrich patients are transferred to the specialised hospital in
Vordingborg.

In an acute emergency patients are transferred to whatever hospital is
capable
and within reach.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Good sign. This is exactly what the CF should be doing at home.

&gt;&gt;&gt; For those who scoff at the small numbers of military involved, not
&gt;&gt;&gt; even the
&gt;&gt;&gt; US could put much larger numbers into that environment, not without
&gt;&gt;&gt; great cost. For starters, any non-prepared troops will die or be
&gt;&gt;&gt; cold casualties -
&gt;&gt;&gt; end of mission. You need to handpick and/or prepare your people,
&gt;&gt;&gt; just like
&gt;&gt;&gt; the Chinese did with their war with India, when they quartered
&gt;&gt;&gt; thousands of
&gt;&gt;&gt; troops on the Tibetan plateau for months to get them ready to go
&gt;&gt;&gt; even higher.

&gt;&gt;&gt; It'll be interesting to see what the Danes make of this. As for the
&gt;&gt;&gt; US (speaking in my schizo role as a Canadian) I'd be after setting
&gt;&gt;&gt; up some passive/active sonar belts in the Archipelago, and
&gt;&gt;&gt; considering global warming, I'd even start thinking about setting
&gt;&gt;&gt; up some coastal defense stations with SSMs.

&gt;&gt; I recently had an interesting conversation with a manager from First
&gt;&gt; Air, the airline owned by the Inuit. He had been to Greenland on a
&gt;&gt; charter and found that the Greenlanders' reaction to the presence of
&gt;&gt; Canadians ranged from wariness to downright hostile -- unless the
&gt;&gt; Greenlander was an Inuk, in which case the reaction was pretty
&gt;&gt; friendly. Apparently many of Greenlanders of Scandinavian descent
&gt;&gt; think we covet their rock and ice.

&gt;&gt; It's not like we ever did anything hostile in that neck of the woods,
&gt;&gt; like occupy Iceland... oh, sorry, we did do that. Oh, well.

&gt; That reaction _is_ interesting. It surprises me some, anyway.

&gt; I suppose some Canadians do covet their (the Greenlanders') rock and
&gt; ice, and maybe also some Americans, but by and large it's a matter of
&gt; us protecting our own rock and ice. I think the sovereignty patrols
&gt; we have been running the past few years are excellent - they serve a
&gt; number of important functions:

&gt; 1) it shows that we're interested;

That is exactly it.

It is hard to claim sovereignty over an area where you dont "show the flag"

It is not about military might.
