I just saw on the Provo Craft website and others as well that they finally
made the software for the Cricut machine.
Here is a link to one of the sites talking about it:

I find it a big disappointment as they are still limiting you in that you
must buy their cartridges to use with it. When the Cricut first came out I
inquired about the usb port and the ability to use any fonts on the pc and
it was strongly hinted at that this was possible in the future. Looks like
it was a big lie. I am not buying any more cartridges and I won't give
provocraft another single cent of mine.

I agree.  That's why I'm going with the Klic-n-kut.  Even though the cricut
can hook to the computer, you still have to by the clipart.

I found this pretty disappointing, too. I emailed my husband to warn him to
*not* buy me this for Christmas. He's always been intrigued by that USB
port. Looks to me like the Craft Robo is what I'll be looking at seriously now.

Maybe once this gets off the ground they will expand it to all fonts on your
computer. We can hope anyway.
