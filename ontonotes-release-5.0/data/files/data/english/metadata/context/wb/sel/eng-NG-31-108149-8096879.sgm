Hey Brian, if I use your pre-production-stage-for-almost-a-year-now
processor to ask why you refuse to post your now defunct non-linear
linear, like I've been doing for over a year, would you be able to
hear me THEN?

WOW, that was FAST!!! Is that all you do? Sit there in your parent's
basement waiting for someone to order one of your hack-jobs when you
can't even give an estimate on when they will go into full production?
Don't you have anything better to do? I mean, heck...... look at posts
from yesterday afternoon, one of the biggest national holidays, when
just about everybody can find something to do besides jerking off in
front of a computer. It seems that the only people who posted were you
and the trolls. And yet, even with all that spare time because you
couldn't drag your ass away from the computer and out of the basement
long enough to join the rest of humanity in a barbecue, you AGAIN
refused to answer the tough question, just like you have done for
several years now.....

Where's the schematic for your hacked amp, Brian?

Oh dear, are you selling oscilloscopes and test sets in order for buyers to
set their radios correctly?
You really don't have any technical knowledge.  All you seem to do is
re-sell boards made by other companies.
You should see what people are saying about you in other groups, you have a
terrible reputation.

Absolutely right. These are discussion groups, but some people would
rather use them as their own personal media for spamming products that
would otherwise be pulled from the market for patent violations and/or
false advertising. It's truly shameful how these basement-dwellers

&gt;An external device as you describe was considered during the design
&gt;phase... but we decided that an external box (although easier to hook
&gt;up initially) was unsightly with all the wires hanging all over, had
&gt;mounting issues, and therefore was much less reliable in the long run.
&gt;It also has problems accomodating different mic/radio plugs. The
&gt;VoiceMax requires the cutting of a single trace within the receiver
&gt;and works with any non-amplified dynamic mic. Since it's inside the
&gt;rig... you set it up once... and enjoy the benefit each &amp; every
&gt;transmission without doing a thing. Hope that answers your comment/
&gt;question.
">

So you can't adjust the threshold on the noise gate? That's pretty
lame. So you set the threshold to trigger at a certain level, like
during normal driving. So what happens when you are towing a boat up a
hill with the windows open? How do you prevent it from chattering like
a chimp with the hiccups? Does it have hysteresis to smooth out the
chatter? If so, how long do you have to hum into the mic before you
can start talking? If not, and you have to set it high enough to
prevent chatter, how loud do you have to speak so your audio isn't
chopped up?

I don't think you've thought through this whole noise gate thing,
Brian. You certainly haven't tested it much under real conditions, if
at all. If you did you wouldn't be selling it.

And BTW, since your non-linear linear has been discontinued, why won't
you post the schematic?

Power mics have batteries but people still buy them. Or why not tap 12

Wrong. They are set at the factory for 95 to 98% modulation, as per
just about every service manual I've ever seen. And that's a lot of
manuals. An additional 2 to 5% is, for all practical purposes,
insignificant, translating to a peak power increase of less than 1%.

Wrong. The limiter in the radio is set for the specific radio, and is
usually integrated into the audio AGC that's already built into the
radio (which makes your processor somewhat redundant except for the
noise gate). Disabling the internal limiter and using an external
limiter will almost certainly result in clipping, especially when the
person setting it has no calibration equipment.... that is, assuming
your processor's limiter can be adjusted. Can it?

The only reason I see for doing a internal board and not an external
unit is that a board has to be bought for every radio a person owns if
they want to have the same capabilities on all their radios. Thus more
potential sales. The rest of your explanation is pure hogwash.

***************

Hogwash and plenty of it.

the SSM2166 draws about 10mA of current. Four NiMH AA batteries have
1800mAhr capabilities. At full charge that delivers 5.6VDC to the
chip. Well within the operating range. Should get about 150 hrs of
operation. Add a charging circuit and you have no more issues.

Yep the internal audio power amp has some form of limiting
(compression) that keeps the modulation percentage in the 85 to 100%
range. Often that feedback path is the first thing that most CBers cut
out when they buy their radios. So what is the need for another
internal compression unit when CBers don't want aduio compression?
Secondly why add another compressor when you already have sufficient
compression built into the radio? If I wanted more, I would increase
the negative feedback to the controlled gain stage of the audio
modualtor section. Often this is just a resistor value change.

Beisdes increasing modulation percentage from 85% to 100% gains little
in range or intelligability. Often not worth the effort. Adds about 7%
audio power into the each of the two sidebands. Even if the limiter
section of the modulator section is not disabled adding your
compressor is not going to increase the percentage of modulation. So
why waste the money to buy and install it unless you disable the
radio's internal limiter?

After doing all that to gain up to 15% increased modulation
percentage? Cheaper to clip and/or alter the feedback in the
modualtion stage.

Unless it's an old tube-type radio, your original radio was broke.
Just about every solid-state radio built since the 1960's has the

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

It varies as much as people have different voices and speaking styles,
but it is generally accepted to be in the 20 to 25% range (peak to
average ratio from 5:1 to 4:1).

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; The VoiceMax brings the average

Impossible, and you prove it yourself with your implementation of a
noise gate. You can push 40 to 50% with heavy filtering, and that's
about the best you can do, but it still causes moderate distortion.
Even if your &quot;constant 100%&quot; modulation applies only to unmuted voice,
it would be completely unintelligible. You can pick up almost any book
on radio communications and it will say the same thing.

&gt;modulation. Granted, that is a great improvement from the original
&gt;radio modulation... but to get full advantage from VoiceMax (the
&gt;VoiceMax installation instructions are quite clear on this point)...
&gt;you need to adjust or disable the radio's limiter so you're able to
&gt;reach the 100% modualtion point. Once there... the VoiceMax has an on-
&gt;board adjustable limiter that will hold you precisely at the 100%
&gt;level. You can't do any better than that!
">

Assuming you set your processor's limiter to 100% mush, you still need
to set the output level to the radio so it doesn't overmodulate. Even
just 101% modulation means clipping; pump that with 100% average noise
and you have the potential for some serious bleedover. And there's no
way for the average user to determine the precise point at which his
radio is at 100% modulation. Radios are set at the factory for 95% to
98% modulation to allow for slight variations in tolerance that happen
during normal operation; for you to claim that your processor limits
modulation to 100% all of the time is not only absurd, it's impossible
because of the tolerance limitations of the radio.

These are the hard questions, Brian. And this is not a rant. I'll even
grant you clemency from your now broken promise not to reply to my
posts. You have no excuse not to reply.

&gt; An external device as you describe was considered during the design

&gt; I'm not trying to encourage or discourage you... just trying to
&gt; give you the facts.

But, by making it internal only, you ARE encouraging the hacking of
radios.
I don't know about America, but there are very few real radio techs in
this country willing to take on CB work.  It simply doesn't pay what a
real tech is worth.  If they try to charge what they are worth, the
CBer will simply find a cheap &quot;rig doctor&quot; who has no real training.
Alternatively, they will try  to fit it themselves... they will ask in
some group, and most likely get help from one of those &quot;rig doctors&quot;.

Either way, &quot;rig doctor&quot; or DIY, they are likely to end up with
a hatchet job.  When the system sounds like crap, will they really
blame their work - or your product?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I agree that there are many people that don't have the
&gt; expertise to install such a device. These folks would have to seek the
&gt; help of a technically competent person... such as a CB shop as you
&gt; mention.
">

Some time back, a regular customer brought in their radio and a
speech processor, which they wanted fitting.  The speech
processor was a well known type, and had been obtained from
a well known UK supplier.
I believe that that the shop purchased the processor in kit
form, putting it together, to allow for their profit margin... because
I simply refuse to believe that the manufacturer makes such a
hatchet job of their soldering and wiring.

Proving that, even if your product only goes to retailers or
is only fitted by retailers, it may still end up as a hatchet
job... and your product could get the blame.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; As for your question about the Turner... sorry... I have no
&gt; knowledge regarding this unit.
">

You have no knowledge of the products you are competing with?
And no intention of providing what the customer desires?

I can understand you ignoring the rantings of a bitter, twisted
old man who may have a grudge... but someone interested in your
product?
This seems to suggest that YOU decided that YOU want to
make and sell a product based on YOUR desires... not on what
the consumer wants or needs.

It reminds me of a certain singer who said that he didn't care
that his latest stuff was not what the public wanted... he
liked it.
Last I heard, I believe he was cleaning streets somewhere in
America.

This group has shown much hostility towards Brian, and I was about to
Email one of the regulars to ask what the history is.  Because, so far,
I had not seen the reason for it apart from the usual p1ss1ng
contests and opposing groups within rrcb.

However, Brian himself appears to have given what could be a real
good reason to avoid his products... his apparent disregard for
the customer's needs or desires.
That, for me, raises concerns about whether he would provide
good customer care or simply blow the customer off once he
has their money.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; The funny thing is, I don't have the theory expertise that you,
&gt; James, or Frank have.
">

Most CBers do not have technical expertise, it is not a
requirement. In fact, CB is for those without such expertise.
That is why, as a consumer, you need to be aware. Many companies
have used this lack of knowledge against their customers, selling
them total crap.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; But I am one of the few people that uses CB, that can open the
&gt; radio up and read schemtics, and follow directions for mods.
">

I don't know about &quot;few&quot;.  Over the years, I have seen a
large amount of fekked up equipment, due to people who are
willing to go inside their radio... and those willing to do
other people's radios the same way.
One person I knew would do this with every radio he had, he
was famous for it. Every time he got a radio, he would go
inside and feck it up.  He would then sell it cheap t a tech,
and buy another.
The tech would put everything right and make a killing
on the sale.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; As far as the battery problem, there are a couple options. One
&gt; is to put 12VDC terminals on it, or simply use a 12V battery.
&gt; Hell, the 9V battery in my mike lasts for years.
">

Over the years, I have seen many battery operated CB
accessories and many with wires for 12v supply.
Power microphones, base microphones, echo boxes, speech
processors, VOX, preamps, power amps, etc.

None of the manufacturers had a problem with external
units, or the selling of them.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Second question is, before I hack into my radio, how much better
&gt; is this than my Turner +3B with Speech Compression?
">

Do they still make this, to the same old specifications, or is
it an old one still in use?

This is from an old catalog, really old...
Model +3B
Frequency range:  300-3500Hz
Impedance:  1K Ohm
Output level:  -42dB adjustable
Battery type:  7v Turner / Mallory.

That is all it gives, and it is not clear whether that
&quot;-42dB&quot; is dBm and whether that is maximum, minimum
or some middle figure.

There is another processor in this catalog, anyone remember
the MC902 processor?  Remember the days of &quot;Solid-State&quot;
equipment?
Loads of switches, knobs, and even a meter on this one.

Does Brian give out full spec on his processor?

Peter.
