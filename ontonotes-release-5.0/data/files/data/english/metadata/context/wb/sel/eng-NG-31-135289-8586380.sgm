Do You Get Motivated or Do You Get Defeated

Answering this question honestly is can lead to the development of a
success consciousness.  Most times in life, things simply do not go as
we planned them to.  Too often people behave in ways that conflict
with our desires.  Life has a way of unfavorable circumstances our
way.  How we handle these situations is what catapults one into the
success realm.

Are you one of those who allow unenviable situations to get you
down?  Do you fall into depression when you don't get your way? Get
angry? Feel like crying?  Well, it is time to grow up.  If you are one
who continually allows these circumstances to take hold of you, I can
guarantee that you are destined for a life of failure.  Instead of
getting down, the successful get motivated.

Here is a great secret of life: Everyone gets knocked around from
time-to-time.  No one gets everything they want all the time.  Let me
repeat that. No one gets everything they want all the time.
Disappointment is shared among each person on the planet.  The
difference is how we respond to that disappointment.  In fact, how we
react in any situation  is truly the only thing that we have full
control over.

There was a salesman that I was working with who had a situation that
arose that cost him a fair amount of money.  He wrote enough business
to qualify for his bonus.  Due to a business owner being out of town,
he was not able to get all the paperwork done by the close of
billing.  However, he talked with several managers who assured him the
deal would be billed, thus preserving his bonus.  Well, someone failed
to bill the deal and the salesman lost his bonus.  This was the latest
in a long line of struggles within this company.

Initially, the salesman thought of quitting and going to another
company.  He knew that he had the ability to land a job with any of a
number of competitors in his field.  However, due to our working
together, he was able to reason it through.  Instead of letting this
get him dejected, he decided to use this to motivate him.  He went on
to have one of his biggest months with the company far surpassing the
money that he lost the previous month.   This is an example of turning
a &quot;losing&quot; situation into a winning one.

Too often, we will not do things until we are at the point of
complete frustration.  If you are presently experiencing some major
disappointment in any area of your life, then get excited.  This
typically is a sign that a substantial breakthrough is about to occur
However, this is true only if one is taking the action necessary to
move forward.  Focused action in the &quot;down&quot; times is usually a proven
method for turning things around.

Another factor worth mentioning is the time lag that often occurs.
When one begins to take action towards a desired outcome, there will
be a lag between when the action was taken and the planned results.
Perseverance is vital at this point.  A strong mental outlook will
carry you through until the results begin to appear.

Think of the successful athlete.  Often, they suffered a setback
somewhere in their careers.  Perhaps they were cut from a team or they
suffered an injury.  These situations were used as motivation to put
in the effort to make themselves better.  Ultimately, they overcame
the circumstances.  Implement this strategy in your life when things
seem to be going against you.

Get motivated and take focused action in the direction of the goals
that you most desire.
