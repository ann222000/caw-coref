It's supposed to hit the high 70s today, so my thoughts turned to
grilling.   I picked up the following hints, which will probably bring
out all the grilling aficionados:

" I would suggest a method that takes very little practice to master,
and is extremely accurate:   use your finger to tell the doness level of
your steak.

"Rare- Touch your thumb and forefinger together and press on the fleshy
part below your thumb.  It should feel soft to the touch with your other
forefinger and a little bouncy.  This is how a rare steak feels.

"Medium- Touch your thumb and middle finger together and press on the
fleshy part below your thumb -- there's some give and it's springy to
the touch. A medium steak will feel the same.

Well Done- Touch your thumb and little finger together and press on the
fleshy part below your thumb -- there's no give and it's quite firm.
This is what a well-done steak feels like."

On a steak? No way, nice bloody juice is what you want.

You are confusing steak with chicken.

sorry if this suggestion has been given I am coming into this discussion just
now.  There was a rule testing grill ed steak about pressing your finger  your
finger tip to the meat and if it  felt like your nose or your chin  or cheek
something like that it was rare or medium or well.  Don't. I remember.  Does
anyone remember that simple rule for testing doneness of beef ?

Here is what I do
hold your open hand palm side down about a beer can in height above the
grill.if you can count to five Mississippi's before you pull your hand away
the grill is hot enough.Slap your 1.5 inch thick room temperature steaks on
the grill and sprinkle with a little kosher salt.go grab a beer. don't
piddle around in the kitchen- you got food on the grill.drink the beer,flip
the meat,sprinkle with salt and go get another brewski.if you get flame ups
pour your wife's beer on the flame to put them out.
When I see the fat around the edges start to sizzle and I get about a
teaspoon of juice on the top of the steak I pull it off.get another beer let
the meat rest and then dig in

There was concern about T-bone steaks, as they contain part of the
backbone. I believe those were generally banned in Europe because of
that.

I cook steaks by touch.  Rare feels like pressing your thumb against
your lower lip.  Medium feels more like the palm of your hand.  Well

There are other biohazards associated with meat besides mad cow prions.
Some are from the animal itself, and others are outside contaminents.   They
get into and onto the meat during the animals life,  as well as during
slaughter, butchering, and processing.

The list  includes parasites and bacteria.  My guess would be that a
grilling process that sears the outside will likely kill common surface
organisms like salmonella.  But leaving the inside extremely rare may be
risky.

Putting your hand that close to the grill could cause an
uncomfortable burn.

Some people test ribs for doneness by poking them with a BBQ
tool, seeing if there is a sort of "hollow" response.  But
this has nothing to do with steaks.

In my experience the best way to cook a steak to the desired
doneness is to time it.

There is an inherent risk of being burned when using the grill.  A quick touch
should just take a fraction of a second. If you are afraid of being burned go to
a good restaurant for your steak.   Really stupid people should just burn
themselves to death and spare the rest of us from having to listen to then any
longer,  IMHO

She's not placing her hand on the grill, she's placing her finger on

No, I do grill them on a Weber and putting you hand anywhere close
to right over the grill is too hot.  The Weber is 18" in diameter,
few steaks are that large.  (And yes, for steaks I use the direct

You must have some very tender baby fingers.

I wonder if there's a direct correlation between physical stature and
IQ, because you're definitely short on both.  If you climb up on a
ladder then you can reach down and not burn yourself... or you can
shorten the legs on your grill. LOL  I can't offer any help with your
low IQ, it's way too late for remediation... what a moroon!

I believe that an 18" Weber is the Smokey Joe?  If so, that will get
much hotter than the Weber gas grill Sheldon uses.   I think Weber gas
grills suck, but the Smokey Joe and the full sized kettle are amazing
products.  They can reach 800 degrees.  I usually do rib-eyes or NY
strips.  About 4 minutes per side.  I use a very long pair of tongs.
There's no way I'm putting my hand in there.  LOL.  I've never been
able to master the touch method of doneness, but I only cook steaks
rare so it's not an issue.  If a guest wants one medium I can handle
that.  On the rare occasion someone wants one well I hand them the
tongs and tell them to ruin their own steak.  People who like well
done steaks are kinda like veg-heads and we'll have other differences
so they usually don't get invited back.  Back when I was dating if a
woman ordered a well done steak or just a salad it was always in
indication that the relationship wasn't going anywhere.

Sorry I drifted a bit.

No, the Smokey Joe is yet smaller.  The 18" is the smallest
size that's capable of most Weber tricks like indirect cooking,
or that has adequate coal/grill spacing for grilling steaks.

That's pretty much my experience -- 3 to 4 minutes per side,
depending on whether the diner wants them rare or medium-rare.

in its electric steak ovens.

I'm not a fan of gas grills for steaks.  (But I haven't owned
one myself, it just seems people I know who have them have
not perfected a good steak technique with them; I am not
saying it's impossible.)

How illogical and assuming, like you know me up close and personal for
my entire life...I've been grilling with charcoal probably from before
you were born, and certainly from long before there was a Weber gas
grill.  I don't care if grill surface temperature is 1000 degF, a slab
of meat will prevent that heat from reaching your hand (the top
surface of a grilling steak won't much warmer than the same
temperature of breast milk on tap).  What you're so *zealously*
attempting to describe here proves absolutely that you've never cooked
anything on any grill... you sir are a creep, a liar, both.

Your use of the word "bad" is not a difference of opinion, it's a
nasty judgemental remark.  There is nothing bad about making pesto
with almonds, walnuts, hazel nuts, most any nuts... in fact the nuts
can be omitted and it's still pesto.  Also there is no rule that basil
has to be used, could be parsley too, or any green herb.  And in fact
what most folks make is not pesto at all.  Pesto is made with a mortar
and *pestle*... made with a food processor (or any machine) it's not
pesto because the texture is just so wrong it's a pathetic waste of
ingredients.  By his almonds are bad fo rpesto remark Steve Pope has
proven absolutely that he has never made pesto, he's never cooked
anything, I knew by his first week's postings he's a fraud... he's not
even who he says he is.

If you're intent on mischaracterizing every opinion as
"nasty and judgemental" then that's all you're going to see.
Doesn't have anything to do with what I wrote.

Sheldon

he must have made the comment about the nuts after i blacklisted him because i
never saw him say that about a post of mine.  Steve has negative  comments about
anything i post.  We are not talking about my pesto post - that was clearly my
opinion and i still believe a genuine pesto would not have almonds in it. My
opinion my preference.We were not even talking about pesto here any way. Live
and ignore the mouths that roar. That is my opinion.
