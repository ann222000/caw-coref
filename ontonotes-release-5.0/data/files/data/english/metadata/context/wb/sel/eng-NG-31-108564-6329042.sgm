Sure and good wishes indeed for a very good searing season anticipated
for the Toadland this year, with a reporting in the coming  months of
those wonderful bushfires lighting up the country side with some 100 ft
high flames ... may be &amp; hopefully upgraded those bushfires into cities
fires !!!

Good prognostic as well for the continuous loss of water reserves in
dams ( I know some have been replenished around Tenant Creek and the
Alice ... and as well  the Todd river apparently overflowed for the 1st
time in 50 years ! but fortunately all other dams in the East as in the
West are down and doomed to go further down to mud cake level ! This is
excellent !

Also with the McNaught Comet rising in the sky towards the Earth, I
anticipate this could be that little push needed for the magnificently
terrible  9.2 Great Sydney Quake. I anticipate it will be quite a
show... especially with the consecutive monstrous tsunami following in
phase !

What else could I wish for that infamous Toadland ??? ZZEE Land of
Bastards indeed riddled by that Convict Rabble supporting shamelessly
all types of Mining, Political &amp; Financial Criminals ??? ... praising
the Frauds, honouring the Thieves, in awe of the legerdemain Liars &amp;
Con men !

It is proper then that the Fanatics legion, whose main traits are
immorality and dishonourably should lift a toast to the like of it :
Australia. By the way do you expect anything in return for your good
wishes like gratitude &amp; recognition, poor dude ? Forget it, the
Antipodean Toads are completely unable of any human feelings ...and
evidently

I will not be party to such abjection,  ...hence my objection well &amp;
clearly put in writing

by the way the Divine Drudging Drought is still ploughing ahead...
don't forget.DC !

Three barges of fireworks were blasted sky high in Fremantle harbour
last night i.e. Australia Day by their completely pissed &amp; still
boozing technical attendants. Former WA Premier Lawrence and now Feral
Back bencher as Member for Fremantle &amp; also Pedo-Psychologist ( PhD WA
Uni ) went immediately to the scene with the some ABC crew headed by
famous Acan Larpenter

Interviewed by Acan Larpenter, the stern comments of Lawrence took
everyone by surprise:
Quote :
I am appaled by the complete loss of 10 full casks of excellent Swan
beer in the incident... this is a terrible loss for the nation and
although a good 200 people have been burnt up to 3rd degree &amp; send to
St John of God  &amp; some in desperate situation,  this is something to
which we may easily bring remedy by importing  migrants ... while the
loss of that Swan beer is consumed for Eternity !
.. to which Acan Larpenter replied that it was a pity the death penalty
had been phased out of Australia legislation !
End of story

PATHETIC !

Now I am kindly forwarding to you my reply to some Hunter $ Thomson, a
well known commentator of Australian Politics
*************************************************************************** *******

Dear Hunter $ Thomson,

Well found : Your effluent Prime Minister !
You have a marvellous sense of humour indeed.

Good,  especially that the consequence of such denegation of mankind
basic right to proper, pure, acidic, low rH2, high resistivity is
completely beyond the competence of that poor unlearnt Solicitor ! The
Laws of life whose only strict application maintain not only the
quality of life of population but as well its propensity at having
children are by the present irresponsible move completely trodden
underfoot !
This, and this is indeed the main concern of the Prime Minister that it
will profit directly the DI ( Disease Industry ) with new dezzzeazezz
new drugs, new Quacks vermines wasting money on worthless AND all that
new employment justified according to the fraudulent economics
presiding over decisions taken in Canberra

I have as simple question to you, dear Hunter, what would be the
consequences of such  discoveries relative to cancer cure in 5 days,
Avian flue controlled easily by superior knowledge, brain tumour
suffering alleviated in a mere hours etc  What would be then according
to your effluent Prime Minister s standards the terrible economics
consequences of this upon the DI with all those vermines out of work,
with people realising at long last their dependence upon the drug
pushing industry ?

See ?

There is NO interest in providing the Australians at large with the
possibility of living healthy .... only that artificial alleged health
which is  in fact a  permanent sickness alleviated by drugs,  hiding
symptoms is of value in the understanding the causes &amp; the causes
behind the causes. The dependency on the Quacks  business and their
best cash flow goodies such as Cancer, AIDS, m-sclerosis is of interest
to your Treasurer Costello and to his little boss Howard ! Hey ?

Hence go ahead with your recycled water and just like with Vincent of
the famous "Take Vincent with confidence" fame, you need to be docile &amp;
trusty towards your clueless leaders. Indeed when you will be sick, and
thanks to medicare a quick spin to the good bed sided manners doctores
will put you back to work

Of course and to complicate indeed the problems, the real origin of
water is completely unknown by the fraudulent sci000nce masquerading as
Geology, and hence the tapping of proper pure water for the good of
people is certainly not the concern of those poor brainwashed sods of
Curtin, Monash etc and the ANU. Biologically pure water is only their
concern and the physical characteristics of such leading population to
a permanent health is certainly not their concern ! Indeed those people
are still on the hook to such abominable theories as Glaciations, Paleo
Glacial Climates ... hence the real source of water, oil &amp; all elements
on Earth is certainly their concern

My best advice to you is to immediately move to New Zealand &amp; move to
the vicinity of Mt Cook to tap some of the good glacier water flowing
from it... in the meantime and for God's sake never touch that filthy
australian tap water either for drinking or cooking ! IT WILL KILL YOU
IN THE SHORTEST TIME

With best regards

Sir Jean-Paul Turcaud
Australia Mining Pioneer

BEER!

Unless you are a "rum pig" then it's a "BUNDY"

As for me, I love Tooheys, VB, and I can give a water buffalo a run for his
money on a "NT Stubby",
But Bundy mate, now you're talking Rum.
If you've never had Bundy, think of it as drinking better than "Mount Gay"
rum, even at the over proofed level..
Best Rum on the planet.

I remember Queens Birthday (they moved Fireworks Night from Guy Fawkes
because it was in Winter instead of almost summer.)  Was always good fun
even after they banned crackers (just the 'pretty stuff' then the media
circus kept bemoaning the kids with burns and the odd eye taken out by a
rocket and they banned private use without a permit.
You CAN get a permit and run your own display though.  But the days of
just waltzing into a shop and loading up are gone - another media hype
that got something that was fun banned because the govt want's to deny
dimwits there shot at a Darwin Award or at least an honourable mention.

same reality by increasingly turning to drugs. Russians, back in the
days of the Soviet Union, were such notorious drunkards that they had to
post armed guards around fighter aircraft while they were being worked
on, to keep the mechanics from drinking the alcohol in the fuel tanks.
Of course, it didn't work: the guards just joined in the party! --MJ}***

I just discovered that my newsreader automatically sets the "reply to"
switch to direct all replies to the preceding poster via email, when 6
or more groups are specified. The idea is apparently to spam the hell
out of anyone who posts to more than five groups, to punish him for
doing so. For the record: I didn't do that, and I consider it stupid to
hard code that sort of busybody crap into a program. However, it is
there and I don't have time to change it, so I suggest that anyone who
replies to this or to my preceding message should delete the "reply to"
setting and make sure their newsgroups line reads as follows:

sci.geo.geology, sci.geo.earthquakes, sci.engr.mining,sci.physics,
sci.astro, aus.science, alt.august

That's the way it was before.

It pops up a warning and invites me to use the Followup-To header to

***{Very frustrating. I sent the earlier post twice, and both times it
went off instantly, rather than lingering as it normally does for a
second of so. Result: it all happened too quick for me to see whether a
"Followup-to" was added or not. Since nobody has complained about being
spammed, and since I haven't been getting a deluge of emails, I am at a
loss to explain what I saw when the post lingered. I am, however, quite
sure that, in fact, I saw a "Followup-to" that had been set to direct
all replies to the guy I was responding to, when I made my original post
to this thread. Evidently it didn't take effect, even though it briefly
showed on the screen.

Anyway, for the record, I despise the thinking behind the "Followup-To"
option. The idea is that some busybody ought to have the power to set
where my response goes, thereby forcing me to check every post before I
send it off, to make sure it hasn't been set to go somewhere I do not
intend. Nobody has a right do do that, and I am amazed that anyone who
wrote a newsreader program would set it up to allow that. The program
ought to be designed for the convenience of the user, not to comply with
some external control freak's ignorant guesses about whether what you
are about to do is appropriate. Bottom line: the "Followups-To" option
is an excrescence that ought to be surgically removed from any program
that contains it.

&gt; Use model rocket motor igniters. It works.

High resistence wire is cheaper and easier.... Plus the heating delay is
about 1/10 of a second..
