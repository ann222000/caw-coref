That engine is not a true &quot;hemi&quot; it is a light duty ohv engine with
POLYspherical heads and had a 3 1/16x3 1/4 bore and stroke and had a
advertised rating of 145hp and a was a extra cost option on all light duty
truck in that year.
There was a total of 104,966 dodge trucks made in that production year not
sure how many with that engine option.
Also the factory radio is a 3 piece unit and was mounted in the dash on the
left side.. and is a Model 611-T it consisted of 3 parts control unit,
power unit and speaker, they where installed either by the dealer. or the
buyer could install it him or herself...
seeing as how it has the v8 poly engine option.. there are some people out
there who would like it.. I myself just like the body style.. if you havent
already guessed I own a 1954 5 window shortbox, mine had the old flatty
that died long ago.. I'm starting the project this friday.. finally after
letting it sit at my folks farm for 8 years...

get in contact with me and lets trade info
