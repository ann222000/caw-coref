Commander Reedy,

Mission accomplished. We re-established connection with Agent Ross, and
brainwashed the Kositsky woman. When we left she was babbling of Minerva
Britannia. We attempted to turn Dr. Stritmatter, but failed - we got bogged
down in a debate oVER Leslie Howard instead. HoweVER, we did get his &quot;Oxford
is Shakespeare&quot; bumper sticker removed from his car.

All in all, it was a successful mission for the Trust. Please make check
payable to &quot;Neil R. Brennen&quot;.

Although Agent Brennen managed to reconnoitre the land (several times)
and meet up with Superior Officer Terry Ross, whose code word,
apparently, was Mar-Vell, Stritmatter and Kositsky, those two intrepid
Oxfordian spies, managed to evade Brennen at the last, leaving him
stranded in Mount Washington after Mickey Finning his drink at supper,
which, not to be too indelicate, was a load of crepe.

P.S. It's BRITANNA, Brennen, not Britannia. No wonder you couldn't
close the deal.

Fool! You actually tried to go head-to-head with the Mastermind who
possesses the sensitive soul and the correct Oxfordian mindset necessary to

I see that although you were in his home territory, you were unable to stop

The Folger's wasn't aware we were spies and we gained access this
afternoon, tellingly enough on the birthday (maybe) of Shakespeare of
Stratford.

I can now say (and this is an absolute thrill) that I've held in my
hand, or at least touched

A first folio
The Edward de Vere Geneva Bible
The Bishops Bible of Elizabeth I--very big, for a pulpit, I believe
Emilia Bassano Lanyer's first edition of her book of poetry, _Salve
Deus Rex Judaeorum_

Sigh.

Lynne said that she noted your misspelling but didn't see making a big
point of it.

&lt;&lt;The old word &quot;strait&quot; (&quot;narrow, tight&quot;) has survived only as a noun in
geography referring to a narrow body of water (&quot;the Bering Strait&quot;) and in a
few adjectival uses such as &quot;straitjacket&quot; (a narrowly confining garment)
and &quot;strait-laced&quot; (literally laced up tightly, but usually meaning
narrow-minded). Its unfamiliarity causes many people to mistakenly
substitute the more common &quot;straight.&quot;&gt;&gt;

A beanie not for the masses. Shakespeare wears a period style black
velveteen nickers and ruffled shirt. Great fun. Ideal gift for a performer

&quot;BEANY AND CECIL&quot;

The characters introduced on the first telecast included CECIL the Seasick Sea Serpent, Captain HORATIO K. Huffenpuff (a Baron Munchausen-like character which Clampett originally considered naming Captain Hornblower), and Huffenpuff's nephew Beany Boy (reminiscent of the precocious Charlie McCarthy) a cheery bright-eyed lad dressed in blue coveralls and wearing a cap with a propeller on top. Another of his characters was the villainous Dishonest John, patterned after one of Clampett's former Warner Brothers bosses. Captain Huffenpuff, the commander of the good ship &quot;Leakin' Lena&quot;, was a braggart with a penchant for telling tall tales. Along with CROwy the CROw, they sailed the seven seas in pursuit of adventure, exploring the universe from the undersea world to outer space. Their familiar arch foe was Dishonest John, whose sneering-laugh &quot;Nya ha ha!&quot; was echoed nation wide by delighted fans. These fans included many noteable personalities including Lionel Barrymore, Jimmy Stewart and Joan Crawford. Albert Einstein, addressing a group of Nobel prize winners in 1950, stopped abruptly at 5 pm, telling his audience he had to leave as it was &quot;Time for Beany&quot;.

---------------------------------------------------------

&lt;&lt;Sir Walter Raleigh was already planning another colony in Virginia.
This one would be more ambitions, with its own coat of arms and the title,
&quot;Cittie of Ralegh.&quot; It would be agrarian rather than militaristic, less
an adventure than a commitment. Raleigh's decision to locate it on
the lower end of the Chesapeake Bay was prompted by Lane's report of
friendly Indians and a good natural harbor. The inclusion of 17 women
and 9 children among the 110 colonists would make this a long-term,
self-perpetuating settlement. Instead of wages, each settler was deeded
a 50-acre plot, thereby giving him a stake in the undertaking. John
White, the artist who had accompanied the first voyage,
was appointed Governor, to be aided by 12 assistants.

When the three ships sailed in May of 1587, the plan was to stop briefly
at Roanoke Island to resupply Grenville's party. But when they arrived
in July, the pilot Fernandez insisted that the summer was too far
advanced to go further, and the colonists were left at Roanoke.

In 1590, John White got passage on a privateering voyage.
As the party stepped ashore, there was no sign of the colonists
except the letters &quot;CRO&quot; carved on a tree. The houses had been
taken down and a palisade constructed, on one post of which
was carved &quot;CROATOAN,&quot; but there was no Maltese CROss.&gt;&gt;

Yes, this actually happened. I was being charitable and assumed it was not
done deliberately. It's too much like the sort of adventures Sam Sloan has

I also met the famous Terry Ross, a man who appears to know everything about
everything - a sort of John Kennedy squared. We had a meeting of minds, and
yes, Terry did have to stoop very low....

You can call her 'ducks' Art, or even &quot;ducky&quot;. Its not rude, however, I
suggest you decline the Ovaltine which is, and made from the sediment of wee
paleolithic beasties mixed with a coloidal substance, possibly river-clay,
plus tepid milk. Important: Should you meet The Quaen, avoid use of this
term.

Whereas, where I come from, you could call me &quot;my 'ansome&quot;, but not &quot;my
cocker&quot; unless you were female (these protocols are strictly observed) which
is also not rude, though startling to emmetts.

And whereas a male would address a female of any age as &quot;maid&quot; as in
&quot;Sheem've turned into some fine great maid, inun?&quot;, or possibly a more
fraternal &quot;my 'ansome&quot; depending on one's intent, if unsure of your
interlocutors sex and with all obvious Saxons, use &quot;my 'ansome&quot;, as in the
formally polite: &quot;Whyne youm didun look where'ns youms arr goin' my 'ansome,

I avoid writing words containing the letter r, Phil? What? How on

I actually say &quot;Art&quot; and London, just like everyone else. I must say
I've hardened my r's as a Canadian (take a careful look at that

LINES ON THE MERMAID TAVERN by John Keats

Souls of Poets dead and gone,
What Elysium have ye known,
Happy field or mossy cavern,
Choicer than the MERMAID Tavern?
Have ye tippled drink more fine
Than mine host's Canary wine?
Or are fruits of Paradise
Sweeter than those dainty pies
Of venison? O generous food!
Drest as though bold Robin Hood
Would, with his maid Marian,
Sup and bowse from horn and can.
I have heard that on a day
Mine host's sign-board FLEW AWAY
,
Nobody knew whither, till
An astrologer's old quill
To a sheepskin gave the story,
Said he saw you in your glory,
Underneath a new old sign
Sipping beverage divine,
And pledging with contented smack
The MERMAID in the Zodiac.

Souls of Poets dead and gone,

&gt; I am become a Fille du Roi. Art is too tall, I fear, to be an ideal

One could try to argue that Paris Match is to journalism as Art is to
Shakespeare scholarship, but I fear that the former is far too sane to
be likened to the latter.

At one period the obscure west country sect/Devon, the Sethians, would not
use the letter 'S' except for the singular word 'Seth'.

And certain catholic choir-boys.

I suppose I made the whimsical comment to Lynne because I was looking at two
earlier English alphabets in association with the first public hornbooks,
both of 23 letters, and both with two &quot;a's&quot;, presumably pronounced
differently. My comment to Lynne was not intended to be as solemn as its
reception now suggests :(

As a general comment; people from East Anglia and the home counties suppress
the 'r' in speech and also express from much higher in the palate, and these
folks moved to New England in the Puritan migrations accounting for much of
New England's somewhat metallic accent, and 'paak the cah in the yahd...
Whereas the Carolinas were settled from a wider variety of counties
including many people from Wessex who seem to add gratuitous r's to their
speech! And also sound more from the throat.

There is a peculiar island in the Chesapeake [not quite over-run by
modernism still], but in the 1950s contained enough Cornish people that the
pronounciation of that language and/or dialect some 200 years ago could have
been heard. These are interesting anthropological studies. Another parallel
is in Scottish traditional music, far better preserved in Nova Scotia than
in Scotland itself [according to Dougie Maclean].

Cordially, Phil

&quot;MONSTER LORD (ANAGRAMMED)&quot;
----------------------------------------------------------------
Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,
In there stepped a stately RAVEN, of the saintly days of yore.
Not the least obeisance made he; not a minute STOPPED or stayed he;
But with mien of LORD or lady, perched above my chamber door.
PERCHED upon a bust of PALLAS, just above my chamber door,
PERCHED, and sat, and nothing more.

Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,
By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,
&quot;Though thy crest be shorn and shaven thou,&quot; I said, &quot;art sure no CRAVEN,
Ghastly, grim, and ancient RAVEN, wandering from the nightly shore.
Tell me what the LORDLY NAME is on the Night's Plutonian shore.&quot;
Quoth the RAVEN, &quot;NEVERmore.&quot;
-----------------------------------------------------------------

&lt;&lt;In the vaulted border of the cave behind Mithras there is often a
RAVEN, sometimes PERCHED on the god. He brings a message to which
the god listens. In classical literature the RAVEN is the messanger of APOLLO,
and in the Mithraic ritual he is evidently associated with the APOLLO
like Sun-god seen in the top left-hand corner of the relief. During the
course of the actual mysteries the duties of those with the grade of
RAVEN vividly recall the bull-slaying scene; they wear RAVEN's masks
(Fig. 5) and perform as heralds the same role as the RAVEN performs for
Mithras. The bird conveys Sol's orders to Mithras to kill the bull, and
the god carries out the order, although with an expression of anguish on
his face. It grieves him to slay the magnificent beast, but like a true
soldier he obeys in the knowledge that in the end life will be renewed.

Nevertheless the scene is strange because there is no doubt from
the evidence that the Sun-god was considered to be inferior to Mithras.
Moreover, Mithras himself was also regarded as Sol invictus. One theory
has it that Sol was the mediator who, through the RAVEN, conveyed
knowledge from Ahura-Mazda or Zeus-Jupiter. A second view is that Sol
was originally the superior of Mithras and both were later incorporated
into one mighty sun-figure, as When Mithras and Sol ascended
to heaven in their chariot.&gt;&gt;
---------------------------------------------------------------
APOLLON was the great Oympian god of Oracles, Music and POEtry,
Plagues and Healing, Archery and Hunting, Cattle and Herdsmen; and the
Protecting God of Streets, Entranceways, Embarkations, &amp; STRANGERS.

&quot;Beyond the Olympion [temple of Zeus in the market-place of Patrai,
Akhaia] is ... a sanctuary of APOLLOn.
The god is of bronze, and naked. On his feet are sandals,
and one foot stands upon the skull of an ox.

That APOLLOn takes great pleasure in oxen is shown by Alkaios
in his hymn to Hermes, who writes how Hermes stole cows of APOLLOn,
and even before Alkaios was born Homeros made APOLLOn TEND cows
of Laomedon for a wage. In the Iliad he puts these verses in the mouth
of Poseidon:- 'Verily I built a wall for the Trojans about their city,
a wide wall and very beautiful, that the city might be impregnable;
and thou, Phoibos, didst TEND the shambling cows with crumpled horns.'
This, it may be conjectured, is the reason for the ox skull.&quot;

&quot;DREAMNG DREAMS NO MORTAL&quot; Sunday May 29, 1921
&quot;MONSTER LORD (ANAGRAMMED)&quot;
----------------------------------------------------------------
Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,
In there stepped a stately RAVEN, of the saintly days of yore.
Not the least obeisance made he; not a minute STOPPED or stayed he;
But with mien of LORD or lady, perched above my chamber door.
PERCHED upon a bust of PALLAS, just above my chamber door,
PERCHED, and sat, and nothing more.

Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,
By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,
&quot;Though thy crest be shorn and shaven thou,&quot; I said, &quot;art sure no CRAVEN,
Ghastly, grim, and ancient RAVEN, wandering from the nightly shore.
Tell me what the LORDLY NAME is on the Night's Plutonian shore.&quot;
Quoth the RAVEN, &quot;NEVERmore.&quot;
-----------------------------------------------------------------

&lt;&lt;In the vaulted border of the cave behind Mithras there is often a
RAVEN, sometimes PERCHED on the god. He brings a message to which
the god listens. In classical literature the RAVEN is the messanger of APOLLO,
and in the Mithraic ritual he is evidently associated with the APOLLO
like Sun-god seen in the top left-hand corner of the relief. During the
course of the actual mysteries the duties of those with the grade of
RAVEN vividly recall the bull-slaying scene; they wear RAVEN's masks
(Fig. 5) and perform as heralds the same role as the RAVEN performs for
Mithras. The bird conveys Sol's orders to Mithras to kill the bull, and
the god carries out the order, although with an expression of anguish on
his face. It grieves him to slay the magnificent beast, but like a true
soldier he obeys in the knowledge that in the end life will be renewed.

Nevertheless the scene is strange because there is no doubt from
the evidence that the Sun-god was considered to be inferior to Mithras.
Moreover, Mithras himself was also regarded as Sol invictus. One theory
has it that Sol was the mediator who, through the RAVEN, conveyed
knowledge from Ahura-Mazda or Zeus-Jupiter. A second view is that Sol
was originally the superior of Mithras and both were later incorporated
into one mighty sun-figure, as When Mithras and Sol ascended
to heaven in their chariot.&gt;&gt;
---------------------------------------------------------------
APOLLON was the great Oympian god of Oracles, Music and POEtry,
Plagues and Healing, Archery and Hunting, Cattle and Herdsmen; and the
Protecting God of Streets, Entranceways, Embarkations, &amp; STRANGERS.

&quot;Beyond the Olympion [temple of Zeus in the market-place of Patrai,
Akhaia] is ... a sanctuary of APOLLOn.
The god is of bronze, and naked. On his feet are sandals,
and one foot stands upon the skull of an ox.

That APOLLOn takes great pleasure in oxen is shown by Alkaios
in his hymn to Hermes, who writes how Hermes stole cows of APOLLOn,
and even before Alkaios was born Homeros made APOLLOn TEND cows
of Laomedon for a wage. In the Iliad he puts these verses in the mouth
of Poseidon:- 'Verily I built a wall for the Trojans about their city,
a wide wall and very beautiful, that the city might be impregnable;
and thou, Phoibos, didst TEND the shambling cows with crumpled horns.'
This, it may be conjectured, is the reason for the ox skull.&quot;

Oh. . .you mean Alfred Russel Wallace's theory!
---------------------------------------------------------

&lt;&lt;[Wallace] was a pioneer in the application of sound scientific reasoning methods to the assessment of Martian geographical and climatological conditions (in a successful effort to counter the claims of Percival Lowell and others regarding the Martian &quot;canals&quot;).

Thomas VERE Wallace, Wallace's father, did not die when Wallace was a child. In Wallace's autobiography My Life he specifically states that the family moved &quot;to Hoddesdon in 1837 or 1838, where my father died in 1843.&quot; Wallace was not &quot;lower class&quot;; in fact, his parents came from quite upstanding stock: his father had been trained and sworn in as a lawyer (but because of inherited wealth did not practice), and had reputedly hung around with leisure-seekers (and met Beau Brummel) when he was younger.

The famous papers on natural selection were delivered in July 1858 at a meeting of the Linnean Society, not the Royal Society.

Wallace did not coin the phrase &quot;survival of the fittest&quot;--Herbert Spencer did. It was Wallace, however, who suggested that Darwin use the phrase as a means of conveying the basic idea of natural selection to nonspecialist readers.

Wallace was not a spiritualist in his &quot;later years&quot; only. He first publicly supported study of the belief in 1866 (and was certainly a full convert by 1869); thus, he lived as much of his life as a spiritualist, as not.

Wallace did not abandon natural selection in his later years. He aggressively defended the theory in print right up through his final year of life at the age of ninety.&gt;&gt;

How did Faustus manage to wrangle 24 years?

_The English Faust Book_ (1592)

Further, I couenant and grant with them by these presents, that at the end of 24. yeares next ensuing the date of this present Letter, they being expired, and I in the meane time, during the said yeares be serued of them at my wil, they accomplishing my desires to the full in al points as we are agreed, that then I giue them full power to doe with mee at their pleasure, to rule, to send, fetch, or carrie me or mine, be it either body, soule, flesh, blood, or goods, into their habitation, be it wheresoeuer: and herevpon, I defie God and his Christ, all the hoast of heauen, and all liuing creatures that beare the shape of God, yea all that liues; and againe I say it, and it shall be so. And to the more strengthning of this writing, I haue written it with mine owne hand and blood, being in perfect memory, and herevpon I subscribe to it with my name and title, calling all the infernall, middle, and supreme powers to witnesse of this my Letter and subscription.
-----------------------------------------------------------

&lt;&lt;In the early part of the sixteenth century a magician by the name of Johann Sabellicus also known as Georg Faust attracted notoriety all across the German speaking lands. During the same era, Johann Fust, Gutenberg's respected collaborator and successor, practiced his printer's trade in the city of Mainz. The earliest record we have of Faust's existence is a letter Johannes Trithemius of Sponheim wrote on 20. August 1507 to the court mathematician-astrologer Johann Wirdung of Hassfurt who had apparently inquired about Johann Sabellicus and was eagerly awaiting the magician's arrival. Trithemius called Faust a glib con-man and drifter who beguiled a gullible public for glory and profit and should be whipped for blasphemy. He mentioned that Franz von Sickingen had recommended Faust for a teaching position in Kreuznach, and that Faust molested several boys under his care. Faust fled when the affair became known. It is interesting that Trithemius links pederasty and black magic (Palmer 82-86, Theens 17).

Doctor Faustus: the Volksbuch

In 1587 the Spies Volksbuch was published and became a bestseller. An English translation followed almost immediately (Marlowe wrote his Doctor Faustus at some point between 1589 and 1592 after reading the English version). The Volksbuch describes Faust as having been born FROM PIOUS PEASANT PARENTS. He moved to WITTENBERG, where he lived with A WEALTHY UNCLE who loved him like a son. He studied theology but kept evil company and began to lead a godless life. Frustrated with theology he called himself a physician. Paracelsus comes to mind. Despite his success, Faust was still dissatisfied, and finally conjured up a member of the Satanic horde, Mephostopheles. Believing that he would be able to control the demonic forces he had unleashed, he entered a contract with that representative of Satan who promised to help him discover the secrets of the universe which up to that point had been concealed from his mind.

Faust signs the contract in blood, and proceeds to crisscross the land as travelling philosopher, lecturer, magician, astrologer, clairvoyant. Mephostopheles takes him on several major excursions--all across Europe, beyond the clouds to the stars, and through hell. The demon answers Faust's questions concerning the origin and destiny of the universe in purely materialistic terms and helps him perform such feats as building a castle in the mountains, flying, re-attaching severed body parts, growing flowers and grapes in mid winter, and siring a son with Helen of Troy. Toward the end of the twenty-four years, Faust installs his apprentice, WAGNER, as his heir, and, on the final day of his life, accompanies a group of students to an inn in the vicinity of Wittenberg where the devil tears him to pieces and leaves the horribly mutilated corpse, limbs still twitching, ON THE DUNG HEAP.&gt;&gt;

&gt; http://www.usao.edu/~facshaferi/FAUST.HTML

&gt;&lt;&lt;In the early part of the sixteenth century a magician by the name of Johann
&gt; Sabellicus also known as Georg Faust attracted notoriety all across the
&gt; German speaking lands. During the same era, Johann Fust, Gutenberg's
&gt; respected collaborator and successor, practiced his printer's trade in the
&gt; city of Mainz. The earliest record we have of Faust's existence is a letter
&gt; Johannes Trithemius of Sponheim wrote on 20. August 1507 to the court
&gt; mathematician-astrologer Johann Wirdung of Hassfurt who had apparently
&gt; inquired about Johann Sabellicus and was eagerly awaiting the magician's
&gt; arrival. Trithemius called Faust a glib con-man and drifter who beguiled a
&gt; gullible public for glory and profit and should be whipped for blasphemy. He
&gt; mentioned that Franz von Sickingen had recommended Faust for a teaching
&gt; position in Kreuznach, and that Faust molested several boys under his care.
&gt; Faust fled when the affair became known. It is interesting that Trithemius
&gt; links pederasty and black magic (Palmer 82-86, Theens 17).

&gt; Doctor Faustus: the Volksbuch

&gt; In 1587 the Spies Volksbuch was published and became a bestseller. An English
&gt; translation followed almost immediately (Marlowe wrote his Doctor Faustus at
&gt; some point between 1589 and 1592 after reading the English version). The
&gt; Volksbuch describes Faust as having been born FROM PIOUS PEASANT PARENTS. He
&gt; moved to WITTENBERG, where he lived with A WEALTHY UNCLE who loved him like a
&gt; son. He studied theology but kept evil company and began to lead a godless
&gt; life. Frustrated with theology he called himself a physician. Paracelsus
&gt; comes to mind. Despite his success, Faust was still dissatisfied, and finally
&gt; conjured up a member of the Satanic horde, Mephostopheles. Believing that he
&gt; would be able to control the demonic forces he had unleashed, he entered a
&gt; contract with that representative of Satan who promised to help him discover
&gt; the secrets of the universe which up to that point had been concealed from
&gt; his mind.

&gt; Faust signs the contract in blood, and proceeds to crisscross the land as
&gt; travelling philosopher, lecturer, magician, astrologer, clairvoyant.
&gt; Mephostopheles takes him on several major excursions--all across Europe,
&gt; beyond the clouds to the stars, and through hell. The demon answers Faust's
&gt; questions concerning the origin and destiny of the universe in purely
&gt; materialistic terms and helps him perform such feats as building a castle in
&gt; the mountains, flying, re-attaching severed body parts, growing flowers and
&gt; grapes in mid winter, and siring a son with Helen of Troy. Toward the end of
&gt; the twenty-four years, Faust installs his apprentice, WAGNER, as his heir,
&gt; and, on the final day of his life, accompanies a group of students to an inn
&gt; in the vicinity of Wittenberg where the devil tears him to pieces and leaves
&gt; the horribly mutilated corpse, limbs still twitching, ON THE DUNG HEAP.&gt;&gt;

SONNET II &quot;AMORETTI&quot; (1595) by EDMUND SPENSER

But if in presence of that fairest proud
thou chance to come, fall lowly at her feet:
and with meek humbless and afflicted mood,
pardon for thee, and grace for me intreat.
Which if she grant, then live and my love cherish,
if not, die soon, and I WITH THEE WILL PERISH.

&gt;&gt; I know how fond you are of the Weekly World News; I have little doubt
&gt;&gt; that you will hail the document as genuine.
&gt; David, do you mean the story of the space alien that was kept as a pet?

"/>

I haven't seen that one, but it sounds pretty typical of the Weekly
World News. Rather surprisingly, one of the unanticipated outcomes of
the demise of the Soviet Union is that &quot;Pravda&quot; has become a tabloid, as
the story whose link is provided above underscores. Some months ago
_Pravda_ ran an article suggesting that the reason the U.S. was so eager
to attack Iraq was that Saddam Hussein was very close to reverse
engineering a UFO that had landed in the desert, and the U.S. wanted to
beat him to it (evidently the results of trying to reverse engineer the
one that landed at Roswell have thus far proved disappointing).

Since Art has a most amusing history of relying upon farcical web
sites of what can only very charitably be called dubious reliability
(e.g., Brotherblue, a site exposing various conspiracies of space aliens
from so many stellar systems that one would need a scorecard to keep
track of them all), I have little doubt that he found the _Pravda_
article both interesting and authoritative.

SARTOR RESARTUS (1835) - Thomas Carlyle

The first has now no date, or writer's name,
but a huge BLOT; and runs to this effect:
---------------------------------------------------------------------

'SARTOR RESARTUS ', which is considered Carlyle's masterpiece, is one
of the oddest books ever written, supposedly part book review and part
biography. The writer said that he patched it together from another
book, 'The History of Clothes, Their Origin and Influence', and
from the life of its supposed author, Herr Diogenes Teufelsdröckh.
The Latin title means &quot;the Tailor patched.&quot;

Both the German professor and his book existed only in Carlyle's
imagination. But in the professor's name he poured out his own soul.
Teufelsdröckh's spiritual struggles, loves, and hates were Carlyle's
own. The book is written in a rhapsodic, broken style
that has since been called &quot;Carlylese.&quot;

Thomas Carlyle, the eldest son of a Scottish peasant family, was born
in the lowland village of Ecclefechan on Dec. 4, 1795.

When he was still in his 20s he began to suffer from a stomach ailment,
and for the rest of his life he was almost constantly in pain. In 1821
he met Jane Welsh, whom he married after a five-year courtship.

In 1834 the Carlyles moved to London, where they spent their remaining
years. The following year 'SARTOR RESARTUS ' was published in Boston,
Mass. Ralph Waldo Emerson, one of Carlyle's earliest disciples, had the
book published in America because no British book publisher would accept it.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
The Tempest Act 4, Scene 1

CALIBAN Be patient, for the prize I'll bring thee to
Shall HOODWINK this mischance: therefore speak softly.
--------------------------------------------------------------------
.

&lt;&lt;[Kathman states:] Strachey also mentions &quot;HOODWINKed men&quot;,
and Shakespeare's use of the word &quot;HOODWINK&quot; at 4.1.206
(&quot;HOODWINK this mischance&quot;) is one of three in the canon.

[Volker's reply:] Not true.
&quot;HOODWINK&quot; occurs six times in thecanon.&gt;&gt;
---------------------------------------------------------------------
SARTOR RESARTUS - Thomas Carlyle

&lt;&lt;&quot;If aught in the history of the world's blindness could surprise us,
here might we indeed pause and wonder. An idea has gone abroad,
and fixed itself down into a wide-spreading rooted error, that Tailors
are a distinct species in Physiology, not Men, but fractional Parts of
a Man. Call any one a _Schneider_ (Cutter, Tailor), is it not, in
our dislocated, HOODWINKed, and indeed delirious condition of
Society, equivalent to defying his perpetual fellest enmity? The epithet
_schneidermassig_ (Tailor-like) betokens an otherwise unapproachable
degree of pusillanimity; we introduce a _Tailor's-Melancholy_, more
opprobrious than any Leprosy, into our Books of Medicine; and fable I
know not what of his generating it by living on CABBAGE. Why should I
speak of Hans Sachs (himself a Shoemaker, or kind of Leather-Tailor),
with his _Schneider mit dem Panier_?

Why of Shakspeare, in his _Taming of the Shrew_, and elsewhere?

Does it not stand on record that the English Queen Elizabeth,
receiving a deputation of Eighteen Tailors, addressed them
with a 'Good morning, gentlemen both!' Did not the same virago
boast that she had a Cavalry Regiment, whereof neither horse nor
man could be injured; her Regiment, namely, of Tailors on Mares?

Thus everywhere is the falsehood taken for granted,
and acted on as an indisputable fact.&gt;&gt;
--------------------------------------------------------------------
FEEBLE I WILL do my good WILL, sir; you can have no more.

FALSTAFF Well said, good woman's Tailor! well said,
courageous FEEBLE! thou wilt be as valiant as the
wrathful dove or most magnanimous mouse. Prick the
woman's Tailor: well, Master Shallow; DEEP, Master Shallow.

Rare Venus - Jupiter Occultation on January 3, 1818

Bethlehem Star? Near Occultation - Venus and Jupiter , June 17, 2 BC

Probably one of the most impressive conjunctions with the two brightest
planets passing each other in the sky. The full occultation only occured
in the far southern hemisphere. In the middle east, the two planets were
in contact at sunset (in the western sky). Venus passes Jupiter
at about 2' arc per hour. The eye has a resolution of 1' arc so
the two will appear as one only for a little more than 1 hour.

&lt;&lt;[Alice] took down a JAR from one of the shelves as she passed;

it was labelled '[ORA]NGE MARMALADE',

&quot;The Pig-Tale&quot; _Sylvie and Bruno Concluded_

&quot;Once there were a Pig, and a Accordion,
and two JARs of [ORA]NGE MARMALADE--

&quot;The dramatis personae,&quot; murmured the Professor. &quot;Well, what then?&quot;

&quot;So, when the Pig played on the Accordion,&quot; Bruno went on, &quot;one of
the JARs of [ORA]NGE MARMALADE didn't like the tune, and the other JAR
of [ORA]NGE MARMALADE did like the tune--I know I shall get confused

'SARTOR RESARTUS ', which is considered Carlyle's masterpiece, is one
of the oddest books ever written, supposedly part book review and part
biography. The writer said that he patched it together from another
book, 'The History of Clothes, Their Origin and Influence', and
from the life of its supposed author, Herr Diogenes Teufelsdröckh.

The Latin title means &quot;the TAILOR patched.&quot;

Both the German professor and his book existed only in Carlyle's
imagination. But in the professor's name he poured out his own soul.
Teufelsdröckh's spiritual struggles, loves, and hates were
Carlyle's own. The book is written in a rhapsodic,
broken style that has since been called &quot;Carlylese.&quot;

Thomas Carlyle, the eldest son of a Scottish peasant family,
was born in the lowland village of Ecclefechan on Dec. 4, 1795.

When he was still in his 20s he began to suffer from a stomach ailment,
and for the rest of his life he was almost constantly in pain. In 1821
he met Jane Welsh, whom he married after a five-year courtship.

In 1834 the Carlyles moved to London, where they spent their remaining
years. The following year 'SARTOR RESARTUS ' was published in Boston,
Mass. Ralph Waldo Emerson, one of Carlyle's earliest disciples, had the
book published in America because no British book publisher would accept it.

SARTOR RESARTUS - Thomas Carlyle

&lt;&lt;&quot;If aught in the history of the world's blindness could surprise us,
here might we indeed pause and wonder. An idea has gone abroad,
and fixed itself down into a wide-spreading rooted error, that TAILORs
are a distinct species in Physiology, not Men, but fractional Parts of
a Man. Call any one a _Schneider_ (Cutter, TAILOR), is it not, in
our dislocated, HOODWINKed, and indeed delirious condition of

Yes indeed -- his belief that Anne Hathaway was Shakespeare's mother
was nothing if not interesting, as was his theory that the addressee of
Sonnet 20 was the Earl of Oxford's own penis. His brilliant discovery
that the number 19 is both the sum of two consecutive integers and the
difference of their squares was quite fascinating, if only to persons
interested in the abnormal psychology of certain complete mathematical
illiterates. Particularly interesting were Art's suggestions that
Shakespeare was being ridiculed in the First Folio commendatory material
by the use of the word &quot;moniment&quot; in the Scottish dialectal sense of
laughingstock, a sense that the word would not even attain until the
nineteenth century, and his assertion that Aleksandr Nevskii was &quot;tsar,&quot;
a distinction that would not exist for another several centuries --
indeed, these and other cretinous chronological gaffes strongly suggest
that Art believes in time travel, a belief that furnishes fascinating
insights into Art's abnormal psychology. On the other hand, Art's Peter
Gay idiocy was too tasteless to be interesting. But which of Art's
interesting topics did you have in mind, Lynne?

Good idea, Art! That way you'll always have at least one (and
probably at most one) reader -- yourself.

Walsingham dragged his sore leg as he walked alongside Cecil, who was

I have only succedded in laming myself.&quot; His right leg was splinted

Walsingham. &quot;My stomach churns, my knee swells, my leg bleeds. . . &quot;

PETRUCHIO Why does the world report that Kate doth LIMP?

'THE KING WHO COULD NOT STOP THE SEA
BUT STEMMED THE VIKING TIDE ON ENGLAND'S SHORES'

by Barrie Markham Rhodes

Most people think of Canute in connection with the story about him
commanding the tide to HALT. But he should be remembered for more than
this. He was perhaps the first king to successfully rule over a truly
united realm of England, free from internal and external strife and
unrest. Canute had great respect for the old English laws,
to which he brought a keen sense of justice and a regard
for individual rights. As part of his promotion of himself as an
'English' king, he did penance for the wrongdoings of his Viking
forefathers, building churches and making many generous gifts to others.
------------------------------------------------------------------
PSALM 38:16 Hear me, lest otherwise they should rejoice over me:
when my foot slippeth, they magnify themselves against me.
For I am ready to HALT, and my sorrow is continually before me.
----------------------------------------------------------
The Tempest Act 1, Scene 2

TRINCULO Were I in England now,
as once I was, and had but this fish painted,
not a holiday fool there but would give a piece
of silver: there would this monster make a
man; any strange beast there makes a man:
when they will not give a doit to relieve a LAME beggar,
they will lazy out ten to see a dead Indian.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;&lt;The end of BELLEROPHON's life was most tragic. Two of his children,
Laodameia &amp; Isandrus, were slain, the first by Artemis, and the second
by Ares. Finally, perhaps driven by the grief for his slain children,
BELLEROPHON mounted PEGASUS one last time. Perhaps to challenge Ares and
Artemis, perhaps to claim some perceived birthright or earned heroic
merit he intently drove straight toward the throne of Zeus: Mount
Olympus. Affronted by such conceit, Zeus formed the gadfly, Brize, and
sent it to sting PEGASUS under the tail, causing him to rear and sending
his rider tumbling to the earth. PEGASUS, however, completed the journey
to Olympus and was welcomed by all the gods. Some accounts say that
BELLEROPHON perished in the fall, while Homer tells us that
BELLEROPHON was left LAME and half blind instead.
Odious to all Immortals, BELLEROPHON wandered the earth,
his heart consumed with misery, alone, fleeing the haunts of men.&gt;&gt;
-------------------------------------------------------------------
The Taming of the Shrew Act 4, Scene 4

Pedant Ay, what else? and but I be deceived
Signior Baptista may remember me,
Near twenty years ago, in Genoa,
Where we were lodgers at the PEGASUS.
-------------------------------------------------------------

&lt;&lt;BELLEROPHON was raised as the Prince of Corinth.

Traditionally BELLEROPHON is regarded as a nickname or epithet,
since he earlier killed a tyrant (according to some versions,
his half brother) named Bellerus. His original name was Hipponous
meaning 'horse wisdom', while BELLEROPHON means 'slayer of BELLERUS'.

Being summoned to the palace of King Proetus of Tiryns,
BELLEROPHON was approached by the king's wife, Stheneboea.
When she failed to seduce him she tried to bring about his death.

Having been scorned she told her husband that BELLEROPHON
had attempted to seduce her. Proetus did not dare kill a man
who was a noted hero &amp; a guest in his palace, instead,
sent him to his father-in-law,
Iobates, King of Lycia, with a sealed message containing his death
sentence, saying &quot; Pray remove the bearer from this word; he has
tried to violate my wife, your daughter&quot;. This is the origin of
the literary phrase &quot;BELLEROPHONtic letters,&quot; which is used
to describe any communication designed to bring harm to
the unwitting bearer of the message.

Iobates imposed several impossible tasks on BELLEROPHON,
trusting that he would perish in the attempt. The first task required
BELLEROPHON to slay the Chimaera. To accomplish this deed BELLEROPHON
sought the advice of the Argive seer, Polyeidus who told him:

&quot;to tame the winged steed, PEGASUS, and then, with the aid
of Athena (Minerva) he would defeat the Chimaera.&quot;

Athena appeared to him in a dream and gave him a magic
golden bridle, Chalintis. He quickly left for Mt. HELICON,
to the fountain Peirene, sacred to the Muses &amp; Aphrodite&gt;&gt;

SPENSer dedication in Fairie Queene (1590)

To the right Honourable the Earle of Oxenford,
Lord high Chamberlayne of England. &amp;c.

To th'HELICONian ymps, and they to thee,
They vnto thee, and thou to them most deare:
-----------------------------------------------------------

&lt;&lt;BELLEROPHON easily bridled &amp; mounted PEGASUS.
Armed with the golden sword, Chrysoar, a gift
from his father, Poseidon, they flew over the
Chimaera and stuffed the beast's jaws with lead.

Iobates &amp; Proetus were so impressed with BELLEROPHON's
relentless courage &amp; selflessness that they ceased
hostilities and Proetus gave his daughter,
Philonoe, to
