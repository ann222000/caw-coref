&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;Reread what you wrote. See any content?

&gt;&gt;&gt; [Hammond]
&gt;&gt;&gt; Yeah asswipe... the content is in the signature file which
&gt;&gt;&gt; you snipped:

&gt;&gt;&gt; ========================================

&gt;&gt;Still no content besides rants and invective. You call this science?

&gt;[Hammond]
&gt;Look Jan... _The God Delusion_ by Richard Dawkins is
&gt;currently #2 on the NYT best seller list. Dawkins is the
&gt;world's most famous atheist and has said that:

&gt;        &quot; the only area of theology which could command
&gt;          my attention would be a claim to be able to
&gt;          demonstrate God's existence&quot;

&gt;Well.... I've got BIG NEWS for Dicky Dawkins:

&gt;            George Hammond has rigorously
&gt;            scientifically proven Gods existence, and
&gt;            has published the proof!

&gt;that proof is contained in my peer published paper:

&gt; http://geocities.com/scientific_proof_of_god/Hammond5s1.html
&gt;which is located on my website  which is cited in the
&gt;signature file above!

&gt;You think I'm going to sit here and trade insults with some
&gt;half baked amateur dipshit like you when Dawkins himself
&gt;couldn't refute the SPOG !  You can sit there and spute
&gt;willy nilly NO CONTENT, NO SCIENCE ad hominem remarks
&gt;from now until doomsday and nobody could care less....
&gt;especially me..... the point is.... DAWKINS couldn't get
&gt;away with it... he'd fall flat on his face.  Fact is, I'm
&gt;holding a royal straight flush in Spades and CAN'T BER
&gt;CALLED in this poker game with  DAWKINS and all the other
&gt;BIG SHOTS of atheism (and anti Creationism) and its JUST A
&gt;MATTER OF TIME before one of the CREATIONISTS is going to
&gt;throw the name &quot;Hammond&quot; in Dawkins' face in public... and
&gt;THEN the shit will FINALLY hit the fan.  In the meantime...
&gt;all I have to do is keep pissing on hecklers like you on
&gt;Usenet until the CREATIONISTS and/or FUNDAMENTALISTS finally
&gt;notice me and realize they've found the &quot;SILVER BULLET&quot;
&gt;theyve been looking for ever since Darwin!

Did you ever go back to a place you havn't been to since your a child
and notice that everything seemed smaller than it did back then?

Some psychologists believe that this results from "subjective
distribution changes" and how the areas in the brain where a few
memories are stored have many more uses and memories in the adult.

The world IS SMALLER than it was then!

Actually your BODY has GROWN twice as big as it was then....
so what you ACTUALLY SEE is that the WORLD LOOKS HALF THE
SIZE IT USED TO BE !

The SAME THING would happen if you were suddenly to reach
FULL GROWTH  (actually right now you are only 85% full
grown, and will stay that way the rest of your life).  If
you were suddenly to gain that last 15% of growth... the
world would SHRINK 15% and SLOW DOWN 15% !

But that's not even the AMAZING PART OF IT.

Remember... a 15% difference in size and speed is probably
all that seperates you from your boss !  How would YOU like
to be sitting in his office and have him sitting at your
desk !  That's the difference !

BALONEY... the effect you described is caused by GROWTH...
pure and simple !  GOD is caused by differences in human
GROWTH !

PS... you're a smart cookie Immortalist... I'd nearly
forgotton how well known the effect you mentioned actually
is !
In the same vein, Dwight Eisenhower mentioned how in his
later years he visited the Holy land and was "amazed" to
find out how small the placeactually  is... it being only 5
miles from Jerusalem to Bethlehem and only 2 miles to
Bethany and only 10 miles to Jericho!  Practically the
entire action of the New Testament took place within a
distance of 10 miles... and yet to read it in the Bible
you'd think the place was the size of the United States!

God is small-minded and can't get His science right -- and the Universe is the
same?

God (aka the Universe) is not small minded.

We are small minded.

But we have now developed the web and there are 6 billion of us.

In toto we are God-like, or Universe like, n e weigh.

And then there's SETI waiting in the wings for the next level.

I think.
