Spammer. He was stupid enough to post his ad to alt.computer.security.
here are a few of the replies.

&lt;&gt; wrote a lot of crap.

Yes, Virus's, spyware and hackers can be stopped. But not by urging
people to randomly clicking links.&quot;

&quot;Please, take your post to alt.soliciting.advertising&quot;

&quot;Little do you know&quot; followed by:
&quot;Yes, for example, why are you offering three-to-five year old versions
of software? PestPatrol from December 2004? Heh.&quot;

and &quot;Anyone who uses a plain mailto link like
on their website is unfit to lecture others on security.&quot;

&quot;did a little digging and posted this to a couple of other groups
where the original post appeared:

Smith Family Robinson is trying to make a little money by touting
Invisus PestPatrol, a rebranded anti-spyware product. It is listed
here under &quot;Legitimate/Licensed Clones&quot;:
http://www.spywarewarrior.com/rogue_anti-spyware.htm

People looking for such software should scroll down to the
&quot;Trustworthy Anti-Spyware Products&quot; section and choose one of those
instead. The original Pest Patrol can be found here:
http://www.ca.com/products/pestpatrol/

Don't support spammers.&quot;

And the spammer is lying. There is some very good free stuff out
there. Not industrial grade, but fine for private use.

Ah, I see he posted here on the 4th. Christopher Humphreys said he used AVG.
Well, on the 4th SmithFam1 posted these same lies to
alt.computer.virus. A reply:
&quot;I hope anyone reading the antivirus newsgroups will not trust someone who
spams the newsgroups with the same canned response, time after time.

Free Anti-Virus and Free spyware/trojan scanners work very well for most
people. Â Trying to gouge those who don't know how to fix their systems
themselves, is what I would expect from an obvious spammer. &quot;

Mike, this guy is dangerous, boot him off the list please.
