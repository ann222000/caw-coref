Oh yeah!  What a blast that was.  I can't wait to do it again.  Next
season is too far away.  It was great to see you all out there in the
HPDE.  And fun, if noisy, to watch the Club Racers.  I was a bit
hesitant about going all out on the LONG straight and taking off the
speed in time, but it turns out I own a Porsche !  (130 mph Club in a
stock machine - no problem.)  :)

Since I sold my 928, I had to watch, but you all did not disappoint!  I
had a blast watching everyone on Friday.  Congrats for a
well-organized, exciting event!

The SCCA has still a couple of DE spots open for Sunday, Oct. 8. Email
me if you would like specifics. I'm not sure if a direct web link to
the SCCA is appropriate in this message group.

I agree that it was a great and well organized event. I have some
in-car video footage that I'll post here once I get around to edit it.

Huge thank you to all who helped organize and run the event. I had a
great time participating and helping out.

I drove in the DE all three days but I couldn't get my tip car to 130
mph. I got to 129 mph at the end of the straight once. My typical lap
times (with no traffic) were 3:37 with a max speed of 127 mph.

Louis,

I gained almost  5mph from Friday to Saturday on the main straight
away. Sure some of it can be attributed to me being faster out of the last
corner, but some of it had to be the mix of 25% 100 octane and 75% 91 octane
to filled up with on Sat.

Kudos to all the Organizers and Participants, It really was a blast!!!.

On Friday I ran 92 octane from the pump at Craig's Service on 13th
East. Saturday and Sunday I ran 94 octane by mixing 3.3 gallons of 91
octane with 6.6 gallons of 100 octane. I didn't see any difference
between the 92 and the 94.

Unless you are running a very high compression ratio, your not going to see
any difference at this altitude.  A naturally aspirated at 12 to 1
compression maybe, or a turbo/supercharged may change things a bit.

Remember that octane has nothing to do with "extra" power.  It simply will
retard detonation at higher compression ratios.  With the very light air
here you just don't see any benefit unless your very high in that ratio.

As for the weekend, yes great job everyone.  This region puts on one hell of
a club race and DE weekend!

The question is more complex.  Newer machines, including my '96, have an electronic system to "compensate" for below spec (low octane, or anti-knock rated) fuel.  Check your owner's manual.  They alter the fuel-air ratio and perhaps the spark timing as well to prevent pre-detonation, which does indeed rob power.   Full power is not restored, as altering these parameters from sea-level optimum reduces full combustion, but it beats having the engine "knock."

Since the mixture is being altered from optimum to compensate (actually for both sub-par fuel and altitude), using higher octane fuel surely can't hurt.  Any time you don't get full (maximum theoretical anyway) combustion you're losing power.  Any time you get pre-combustion you're losing power.  Fuel rated at the minimum design level (93 Octane for my car) should always be used if it's available.  Sadly, 91 seems to be tops here in Utah's regular retail outlets.

As to whether any of us are good enough to actually see the difference . . . :)

Yeah, were not going as fast as you racers though so it's not bad.  I was
glancing down at about mid point of the West pits so I had plenty of time to
downshift and brake with no issues at all.

Regarding octane rating and power increase - from:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octane_rating

"The power output of an engine depends on the energy content of its fuel,
and this bears no simple relationship to the octane rating. A common myth
amongst petrol consumers is that adding a higher octane fuel to a vehicle's
engine will increase its performance and/or lessen its fuel consumption;
this is mostly false-engines perform best when using fuel with the octane
rating they were designed for and any increase in performance by using a
fuel with a different octane rating is minimal."

Altitude also affects detonation (the main problem with using lower octane
fuel in higher compression engines).  From the same reference:

"For each 1000 feet of altitude the atmospheric pressure will drop by a
little less than 1 inHg (11 kPa/km). An engine that might require 93 octane
at sea level may perform at maximum on a fuel rated at 91 octane if the
elevation is over, say, 1000 feet."

I have been told that the octane rating of fuel in Utah is lower because of
the altitude, and that 91 octane in Utah is the same as 93 octane at sea
level.  The above comment on octane requirements suggests that the reason
Utah gas is 91 octane is that the altitude reduces the octane need, so lower
octane fuel works OK here.  The fuels may, however be different.  That said,
it sounds like, when racing in California, it is a good idea to wait till
California before filling the tank, to avoid detonation.

FWIW I measured an 8% gain in my '99 Boxster moving from
91 to 96 octane.
It depends on the maximum octane rating the engine is designed to benefit
from. Obviously
running 110 would not create any more power in my Boxster as it was not
designed to run such
high octanes.

Yep, and the key there is that the engine will perform best on the octane
it was designed for. Modern engines are designed to run a large range
of octanes so it performs best at the highest octane it was designed for.

The lower octane at higher altitudes is to compensate for lower air
pressure.
running 91 octane here will certainly not give the power output that 93
octane
will at sea level as we lose about 18% of the engines performance in SLC.

But I guess the ultimate test is a dyno comparison.

That's one reason I have really liked my turbo Audi's up here.  The A6 2.7T has twin turbos and it forces so much air that you don't take a huge hit as you would with the non turbos.

Yep, and the key there is that the engine will perform best on the octane
it was designed for. Modern engines are designed to run a large range
of octanes so it performs best at the highest octane it was designed for.

The lower octane at higher altitudes is to compensate for lower air pressure.
running 91 octane here will certainly not give the power output that 93 octane
will at sea level as we lose about 18% of the engines performance in SLC.

But I guess the ultimate test is a dyno comparison.

My results were strictly from the seat of my pants.

I know, I was cornering much better on Saturday than I was on Friday.

My lap times show it. I do believe part of it is because I was learning the
track and was improving as a driver.

Some of it had to be the quality of the fuel and the octane rating.

Quoting "Paul T. Larsen" &lt;911 ... @xmission.com&gt;:Paul is correct . As I understand
such things the octane rating has absolutlely nothing to do with the heat energy
of the fuel . It has to do with the ability of the fuel to prevent detonation
and pre-ignition which can happen in high compression ratio engines . At our
altitude our relative compression ratio falls because there is just less air to
compress . Unless you are running ultra high compression engines or  extreme
turbo boost there is no advantage to running extra high octane fuel.

&gt;     &gt;&gt;&gt; East. Saturday and Sunday I ran 94 octane by mixing 3.3 gallons of 91
&gt;     &gt;&gt;&gt; octane with 6.6 gallons of 100 octane. I didn't see any difference
&gt;     &gt;&gt;&gt; between the 92 and the 94.

The event committee had a great weekend.  It exceeded our expectations in
terms of participation and enjoyment by participants.  The reason you saw us
smiling so much was because so many of you were smiling.

Attached is our list of people who volunteered to help. Thanks to all of
you.  I know some who helped are not on the list, as we dragged you off the
pavement when we were short handed, and I apologize for not being able to
give you credit here.  The event is a major team effort and it's success
depends on the strength of the volunteer corps.

Next year will be even bigger and better.

&gt; Huge thank you to all who helped organize and run the event. I had a
&gt; great time participating and helping out.

&gt; I drove in the DE all three days but I couldn't get my tip car to 130
&gt; mph. I got to 129 mph at the end of the straight once. My typical lap
&gt; times (with no traffic) were 3:37 with a max speed of 127 mph.

You guys might be going faster than you realize! Some cars have a
significant amount of speedometer lag. On my daily driver (admittedly
not a fine German machine), it calibrated to be 102 mph for a steady
100 mph indicated, but while accelerating indicated low 120's for 133
mph accurately measured. A friend of mine thought he was going ~155
mph but was clocked at 161 mph. This was doing the 130 and 150 clubs
on the Salt Flats.

So who knows, use a GPS and you might pick up a few mph of bragging
rights.

I agree. I saw about 112mph maximum but my data logger (with GPS)
showed a best of 116mph, for the slow rate at which the needle crept up that
was quite a surprise.
A max of 1.28G in the turns helped keep my lap times reasonable ;)

I use the trip computer that shows a digital speed. If there are no
other cars around at the end of the straight I pass the 4 marker,
glance at the speed, brake at 3.5, turn in, back on the gas and shift
(tip). If there are any other cars around I skip the glance at the
speed. I could never look around the steering wheel to find the speedo
at the end of the straight. :~) My speed at the end of the straight is
pretty consistent at 126-127 mph.

As has been said the octane question is not as simple. I ran 91 vs 92
octane on the full track with NASA in June and I think it made a
difference. So this time I ran 92 vs 94 octane and I don't think it
made any difference. So, for my car, 92 or 93 is about the limit at the
altitude of MMP. Now considering temperature , ... blah, blah.  :~)
