everytime I see one of these.. I laugh.
they all remind me of american idol...
I have no idea who the judges are, nor does it seem to make any
difference.
I only know that I've never heard anything by the winners that I
didn't pretty much dislike.

they rake in a lot of money from people hoping to catch some sort of
easy break..

I'm not telling you not to do it..
