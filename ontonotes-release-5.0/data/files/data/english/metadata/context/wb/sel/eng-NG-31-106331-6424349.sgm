"I place a high moral value on the way people behave. I find it
repellent to have a lot, and to behave with anything other than
courtesy in the old sense of the word - politeness of the heart, a
gentleness of the spirit."

-Fran Lebowitz (b. 1950), author

*************************

I'm not supposed to get upset. I'm not allowed to get upset. But here
I sit with steam coming out of my nostrils. Come to think of it, it's
a waste of precious energy to even bother with it. Uhm. Hear me out
and you tell me...

I once wrote about jealousy.  But I'm going to talk about it today
because that is the bottom of it all.

Jealousy is that ickkky feeling of discomfort when you see somebody
own things, or acquire things, or possess things that you don't.  It
could be as little as a material belonging or as big as a desperate
"wish to be" -- a "wann-be".  You covet the personal attributes, the
advantages, and the accomplishments. And it is just eating you up
inside.  Hah! Tough schitt, scherlock!!
So then, how do you vent out that frustration? How do you let that
green monster crawl out of your system? It's either you schmack the
other person right in the face and get it over with, or you simply
roll out your brainless sappy antics disguised in your "oh-so-obvious'
phony sweetness. It is a crying shame how your insecurity flashes out
like a red flag. You can't even hide that bitter resentment from your
expositions. It is indeed pathetic!

Really, now. Why do I feel perturbed and disquieted? If it didn't
bother me, I would have been snoring by now (it is 10:42 p.m. already,
by the way). BUT NO! Here I am trying to assuage the clamor of
upheaval caused by one nitty-gritty remark.

It bothers me when a person doesn't know how to communicate. The
language one speaks -- speaks of the person itself. The lack of
diplomacy in communicating the message can drop the bomb, so to speak.
Now, whether my perception's standards are way too strict or not, that
is not the point.  The point is:"be POLITE", in whatever you say or
do. Don't act like the bitch that I am! LOL. I don't want any other
BITCH "over-bitch" me! Ha-ha.

Sssh. I hear a voice telling me to snitch it out: "yeah, monn, get
even monn!" and another telling me to give it up: "dork, it's not
worth a sleepless night".  Hmmm. Which one will I choose?  Should I
drum out the "memo" or should I just brush it off like a lint from my
sleeve?

Time's up! Gotta get this heiney to bed. I'll let you know by
tomorrow. Promise. I'll keep you posted. Click!  ~itsduhattityood

PS. YA WANNA KNOW SUMPTIN'? YER PROBLEM AIN'T MY PROBLEM... SO ASK ME
IF I CARE?

I thought "jealousy" was: mistrust of a loved one...Aren't you
referring to "envy" : a desire to covet another's possessions???

you could be courteous with or without alot (or so you would think)...
