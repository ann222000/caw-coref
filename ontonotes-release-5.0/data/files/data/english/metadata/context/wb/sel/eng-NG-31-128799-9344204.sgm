*A state trooper pulls over a car on a lonely back road and approaches
the driver. &quot;Sir, is there a reason you're weaving all over the road?&quot;

The driver replies, &quot;Oh officer, thank goodness you're here! I almost
had an accident. I looked up and there was a tree right in front of me.
I swerved to the left and there was another tree in front of me. I
swerved to the right and there was another tree in front of me!&quot;

Reaching through the side window to the rearview mirror, the officer
says, &quot;Sir, that's your air freshener.&quot;

Stumpy prepared a pasta dish for a dinner party he was giving. In his
haste, however, he forgot to refrigerate the spaghetti sauce, and it sat
on the counter all day. He was worried about spoilage, but it was too
late to cook up another batch. He called the local Poison Control Center
and voiced his concern. They advised Stumpy to boil the sauce again.

That night, the phone rang during dinner, and a guest volunteered to
answer it. Stumpy's face dropped as the guest called out, &quot;It's the
Poison Control Center. They want to know how the spaghetti sauce turned
out.&quot;

Two Mexican detectives were  investigating the murder of Juan Gonzalez.
*&quot;How was he killed?&quot; asked one detective.*
*&quot;With a golf gun,&quot; the other detective replied. &quot;A golf gun?!*
*What is a golf gun?&quot;
&quot;I  don't know. But it sure made a hole in Juan.&quot;*

*Moe: &quot;My wife got me to believe in religion.&quot;*
*Joe: &quot;Really?&quot;*
*Moe: &quot;Yeah. Until I married her I didn't believe in hell.&quot;*

*A man is recovering from surgery when the Surgical Nurse appears and
asks him how he is feeling.*
*&quot;I'm O. K. but I didn't like the four-letter-word the d octor used in
surgery,&quot; he answered.*
*&quot;What did he say,&quot; asked the nurse.*
*&quot;OOPS&quot;*
*------------------------------------------------------------*
*While shopping for vacation clothes, my husband and I passed a display
of bathing suits. It had been at least ten years and twenty pounds since
I had even considered buying a bathing suit, so sought my husband's
advice.*
*&quot;What do you think?&quot; I asked. &quot;Should I get a bikini or an all-in-one?&quot;*
*&quot;Better get a bikini,&quot; he replied. &quot;You'd never get it all in one.&quot;*
*He's still in intensive care.*

*Two Ponca men were sitting out on a back road visiting. All at once
there was a tapping on the window.

&quot;Ah Hoh!&quot; &quot;Hey guy!&quot; &quot;I think there is a ghost tapping on the window!&quot;

Sure enough a wizened face with long flowing white hair was there just
out side the window.

The Ponca man driving shoved his foot down on the gas and immediately
was doing 60 miles and hour.

&quot;Step on it!&quot; &quot;He's still out there!&quot; And sure enough, there was another
tapping at the window.

The driver shoved his foot to the floor again! This time he was doing
ninety (90) miles an hour.

Still the ghostly figure tapped on the window.

&quot;You better giver 'er some more gas!&quot; &quot;He's still out there.&quot;

&quot;I can't go any faster, I've got her up to 120 miles an hour.

About that time the little old man motioned for the passenger to roll
the window down, which he did.

&quot;Say Boys!&quot; &quot;I was wanting to know, do you need a shove to get out of
this mud hole?&quot;*
