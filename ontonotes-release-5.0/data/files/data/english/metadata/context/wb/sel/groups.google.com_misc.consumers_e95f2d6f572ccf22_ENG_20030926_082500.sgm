I didn't realize till today that the list does not
restrict calls from political organizations or so-called
charities. Hell, most of the calls I get are probably from
those sleazy &quot;charities&quot; (e.g. &quot;support our firemen,&quot;&quot;help our
cops get bullet-proof vests,&quot;&quot;help the &lt;insert&gt; children who
need our help,&quot; blah blah blah). I say &quot;probably get&quot; because
I stopped answering my phone a couple of years ago. I let
the answering machine screen my calls at home.

From todays's NY Times:

&quot;The second ruling, issued today by Judge Edward W. Nottingham of
Federal District Court in Denver, threw a more effective obstacle in
the way of the list on the ground that it discriminates against
for-profit businesses; the registry program still allows political and
charitable solicitation calls to be made. Judge Nottingham ruled that
by exempting the nonprofit solicitors from the registry, the F.T.C.
&quot;has imposed a content-based limitation on what the consumer may ban
from his home.&quot;&quot;

speech, but an audience.

that he should get one call a minute -- not only on his home phone, but

Seriously, I would think that the problem could be solved by giving
those who wish to sign up for the do-not-call list the right to designate
whether they will accept calls from commercial, charitable, or political
solicitors, and make access to the registry free for all.

Why shouldn't the judge or his clerk have tried to get their numbers
on the DNC list? Why do you require that the judge be corrupt and
dishonest? It is perfectly reasonable to want to use the DNC. If
you also happen to be a judge and you are given a DNC case, should
you decide based on your personal convenience?

As for reclusing himself, given the popularity of the DNC, that
would be silly. Would you require judges who drive to recluse
themselves from any case that involves cars or roads? Besides, a
better demand that he recluse himself could have been made if he
had *not* signed up for the DNC.

will be getting publicity allright, but what you are suggesting is perhaps a
federal offence.
you can attempts to rationalise it with, &quot;...but I have a right to express
my opinion etc...&quot; but that is crap. Once you step ovet the line in the

however noble, you have sullied the cause, and you are what you hated most.

This latest call to abuse by anti-spammers is going to further divide the

that if allowed to stand would make your telephone even more of an annoyance

congress critters could care less about charities - really. This is ALL
about them wanting the right to call you up and ask for a campaign /
party contribution. Unless this is overturned in the supreme court, say
&quot;bye bye DNC list&quot; 'cause it will NEVER EVER be modified to include ALL
unsolicited calls.

Frankly, you can solve this with technology. I put in a phone system
that requires callers to &quot;press 5 to talk to&quot; me as well as telling
telemarketers that their calls are not wanted. It's a wee bit more
trouble for family / friends to call me, but when they find out that
TM calls have gone from several a day to zero in the past year, they all
want one. Frankly, I wish the unit were smarter and white-listed the
caller-id info to bypass the check, but it can't. It's just a matter of

"/> While the FTC DNC rules exempt charities, they are now required to honor
the Telephone Sales Rule.

http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/pubs/buspubs/tsrcomp.htm#charity

Telefunders are prohibited from:
* making a false or misleading statement to induce a charitable
contribution.
* making any of several specific prohibited misrepresentations.
* engaging in credit card laundering.
* engaging in acts defined as abusive under the TSR, such as calling
before 8 a.m. or after 9 p.m., disclosing or receiving consumers’
unencrypted account information, and denying or interfering with a
consumer’s right to be placed on a Do Not Call list.

As for the legitimacy of charity solicitations, it varies widely. Both
NY and Kentucky require professional solicitors to report the results of
their various campaigns. You can view the most recent results at:
http://www.oag.state.ny.us/charities/pennies02/penintro.html
http://www.law.state.ky.us/cp/active.htm

In NY, the lowest two tiers, (those where the charity received from
0-19% of the money raised), accounted for 25% of the total number of
campaigns. The amount of money raised in this grouping was
$70,351,111.82, of which the charities received $8,357,622.53, resulting
in &quot;operating expenses&quot; of $61,993,489.29. The total percentage of
money that the charities received in all the campaigns was 31.9%.

In Kentucky, one company, Facter Direct, reported 19 campaigns for such
organizations as the ASPCA, the Heritage Foundation and Planned
Parenthood and in every single one the solicitor retained 99% of the
money raised.

"/> Boy, do I ever *not* want to live in your world. I think the judge
was dead wrong on this one, but I don't want judges to decide cases
based on whether they may be physically attacked for their decisions.

A judge -- or anybody else making decisions about anybody else's life
-- should be able to endure verbal abuse. If people write nasty
letters about him to the local paper, that's just part of life.
&quot;Sticks and stones may break my bones...&quot;

And that's why it should be OK for you (or millions of &quot;you&quot;) to call
the judge, either at his chambers or at his home (assuming we can find
his home phone). That is a _person_to_person_ contact, exactly what
the phone system was created for. Each of us has the right to express
our opinion, once. If you call him repeatedly, that's harrassment.
If you use abusive language, that _might_ be harrassment and in any
case won't help change his mind. Threats are right out. But a calm,
rational statement of why you think he was wrong is well within our
rights as US citizens and might actually persuade him to change his
ruling.

Your approach -- a stab wound in the thigh -- is like the old method
of &quot;concerned white citizens&quot; letting black families know what they
thought of having a black move into &quot;their&quot; neighborhood, with a nice
cheerful light on the lawn (burning cross) and/or some bullets through
their windows.

No thank you.

&gt;&gt;&gt; A judge needs to interpret the law and apply it as (he/she) honestly
sees
&gt;&gt; it
&gt;&gt;&gt; should be applied. Regardless of their own personal feelings.
&gt;&gt;&gt; In this case it seems that the Judge would rather not have the
&gt;&gt; telemarketers
&gt;&gt;&gt; calling his home just like you, but in the interpretation of the law
&gt;&gt;&gt; he found some things that he honestly consideres to be incompatible
with
&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt;&gt; constitution, and according to his moral/ethical stand on the matter
&gt;&gt;&gt; (regardless that the outcome was not what he personaly wanted) he made
his
&gt;&gt;&gt; decision.

&gt;&gt; And if charities lose their exemption from the DNC list I doubt many
here
&gt;&gt; will be crying and will be thanking that judge down the road. I have
never
&gt;&gt; had what I consider to be a legitimate telephone solicitation from a
&gt;&gt; charity.

&gt; Um, the charity thing is the &quot;bone&quot; the politicians were throwing. The
&gt; congress critters could care less about charities - really. This is ALL
&gt; about them wanting the right to call you up and ask for a campaign /
&gt; party contribution. Unless this is overturned in the supreme court, say
&gt;&quot;bye bye DNC list&quot; 'cause it will NEVER EVER be modified to include ALL
&gt; unsolicited calls.

"/> No, political calls had nothing to do with this. No matter which way this
plays out there will be no regulation preventing people from calling asking
for your vote or any non-commercial call. Solicitations for donations may be
banned under the DNC list when it's all played out, but you'll just get
calls asking for your &quot;support&quot; without directly asking for donations. The
government will not be able to ban such speech.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; Frankly, you can solve this with technology. I put in a phone system
&gt; that requires callers to &quot;press 5 to talk to&quot; me as well as telling
&gt; telemarketers that their calls are not wanted. It's a wee bit more
&gt; trouble for family / friends to call me, but when they find out that
&gt; TM calls have gone from several a day to zero in the past year, they all
&gt; want one.

"/> I got around that by simply having my phone number listed with no mailing
address. Since the reverse directories created from TPC directory doesn't
have my address, they apparently don't bother me. There's no charge for not
printing your mailing address. I get very few telemarketing calls.

&gt; In Kentucky, one company, Facter Direct, reported 19 campaigns for such

&gt; Dude, we're trying to build a case that sending a goofball judge a few

blocklists and filters and AUPs that are actually enforced. Nothing we do

"/> No, I *don't* approve of a threat to a judge. I approve of people
phoning the judge and telling him that they think his decision was
wrong *and why*.

My point was that it if somebody does something that unpopular, they
should expect to get a zillion phone calls (or voice mail messages,
since nobody answers at the judge's chambers). Too bad he won't
actually _listen_ to them.

Now, if the phone calls get abusive or threatening, that would be out
of line. And our laws quite properly ban threats, whether delivered
in person or over the phone.

Did you miss the rest of my post, where I pointed out that the calls
should not be abusive?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; more important speech than commercial solicitations.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I don't have it handy, but it's all cited in _Destination Ventures
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; v.
&gt;&gt;&gt; FCC&quot;,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; which was a test of the federal anti-fax spam law.

&gt;&gt;&gt; When you find the cite to back up your claim, please post it.

&gt;&gt; The necessary references are in the case cited. Hell, the Nike case
&gt;&gt; from a few months ago works. Commercial speech can be regulated.

&gt; The question may be if the charity asking for money is non-commercial
&gt; speech. &quot;Nottingham ruled the do-not-call list was unconstitutional
&gt; under the First Amendment because it does not apply equally to all
&gt; kinds of speech, blocking commercial telemarketing calls but not calls
&gt; from charities.&quot;

"/> That's less clear, but I seem to recall charities being specifically
mentioned somewhere in the Destination Ventures references.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; http://www.spamlaws.com/cases/destination.html  has the text of the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ruling, which cites the relevant ones.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I'm glad the decision will probably lead to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a law that bans all telephone solicitations asking for money.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It won't. Guaran-fucking-teed it won't, and can't. Go read the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; case law.

&gt;&gt;&gt; If it ends up being ruled on by SCOTUS that case law is out the
&gt;&gt;&gt; window.

&gt;&gt; They don't make a regular habit of overturning their previous
&gt;&gt; decisions. Which are quite clear.

&gt; I didn't know they had ruled on phone calls, not faxes, before this.

"/> Destination Ventures never made it to the Supremes (nor did it need to,
since it relied on well established case law), but the fax law is TCPA, and
TCPA is TCPA. What was ruled on was commercial speech, period. The case law
is a bit complicated, but isn't obscure.

Frankly, the Colorado judge should be impeached. His ruling is that
blatently out of line.

Americans want. He's not a legislator. He's not there to act in accordance
with the will of the people, much less his impression of what that will
might be. He's there to interpret the law.

Beyond that, if the question is looked at on a first amendment basis, the
telemarketers are probably right. The government cannot silence people from
saying what they want as long as what they say is not wildly unreasonable.
However, the issue that the judge, and the FTC missed, is that there is no
constitutional freedom to use an appliance that belongs to someone else, nor
the services they pay for.

IOW, no one has the constitutional right to make the bell on my phone ring,
nor to use the electricity I pay for to make it ring, nor use the service I
pay for to get through to me. The telemarketer can say whatever they want,
but I have no obligation to furnish the means by which they get me to
listen.

That should have been the governments case. They should have stipulated as
to the free speech issue.

&gt;&gt; hopefully soon the President once he signs the bill) are wrong in the
&gt; belief
&gt;&gt; that we should have the ability to say enough is enough, no more
&gt;&gt; solicitations...

&gt; What he thinks about what Americans want is just as irrelevant as what
&gt; Americans want. He's not a legislator. He's not there to act in accordance
&gt; with the will of the people, much less his impression of what that will
&gt; might be. He's there to interpret the law.

&gt; Beyond that, if the question is looked at on a first amendment basis, the
&gt; telemarketers are probably right. The government cannot silence people from
&gt; saying what they want as long as what they say is not wildly unreasonable.
&gt; However, the issue that the judge, and the FTC missed, is that there is no
&gt; constitutional freedom to use an appliance that belongs to someone else, nor
&gt; the services they pay for.

&gt; IOW, no one has the constitutional right to make the bell on my phone ring,
&gt; nor to use the electricity I pay for to make it ring, nor use the service I
&gt; pay for to get through to me. The telemarketer can say whatever they want,
&gt; but I have no obligation to furnish the means by which they get me to
&gt; listen.

&gt; That should have been the governments case. They should have stipulated as
&gt; to the free speech issue.

"/> Hear, hear. This is my exact feeling as well. It's hard to believe
that none of the parties in this whole fiasco has even mentioned this
aspect.

"/> That's not what the court said. It said that the Feds cannot punish those

The term reasonable means not liable, slanderous, wildly offensive (e.g.,
pornographic), etc.

What the FTC failed to argue, and so the court never addressed, (and which
you actually correctly touched upon) is whether or not the telemarketer has
the right to use *your* appliance. Clearly, they have no constitutional
right to do so, and if the enabling legislation were to make the use of
another's appliance, against their will, an offense, then the
do-not-call-list would probably pass muster.

&gt;&gt; Out of curiosity, where did you stand on the Something Awful invasion
&gt;&gt; here? Did you find what they did abusive?

&gt; An attempt to disrupt the operation of a newsgroup by a group of petty
&gt; vandals who don't like their online hangout being called to account being
&gt; compared to voters and taxpayers expressing their opposition to a legal
&gt; decision that will directly influence the quality of their lives, hmmmmm,
&gt; something of a difference there.

&gt; I believe part of the problem with the law is judges making decisions that
&gt; fly in the face of what is right, ie. a burglar slips and falls while
&gt; breaking into your home and successfully sues you. I have no problem with
&gt; judges being made aware of just how out of tune they are with the real
&gt; world, sending threats etc. is another matter.

"/> The clerk of the court's home number was posted. So it's ok with you
that everyone calls that number? You don't see anything wrong with
that? If not, post your number so everyone can call you to express
their disdain for the ruling, it will have the same effect on that judge
as calling the clerk will. Anyway, a coordinated attack on a phone
number designed to cause grief by excessive calls is abuse regardless of
how you cloak it.

&gt; Exactly why the telemarketer case was brought in OK.

"/> Perhaps because one of the telemarketing companies is located in Oklahoma or
Nebraska. Back when AT&amp;T offered banded WATS telephone service, you paid for
incoming calls to an 800 number - or outgoing ones - based on how far the call
was going. Since Nebraska (and Oklahoma) are in the center of the country, a
large percentage of the telephone &quot;boiler rooms&quot; for telemarketers are located
in Nebraska.

If one of them is in Oklahoma, that would explain it.

If one of them is in Nebraska, it could be for that part of Nebraska where one
of the telemarketers who sued is located, Oklahoma City has the nearest
Federal Courthouse.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I didn't know they had ruled on phone calls, not faxes, before
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; this.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Destination Ventures never made it to the Supremes (nor did it
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; need to, since it relied on well established case law), but the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; fax law is TCPA,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; TCPA is TCPA. What was ruled on was commercial speech, period.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; What was ruled on was cost shifting commercial speech.

&gt;&gt;&gt; In DV v FCC, yes. The case law it was based on applies to commercial
&gt;&gt;&gt; speech, and restricting speech at all, and sepcifically so.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;Because Congress's goal was to prevent the shifting of advertising
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; costs, limiting its regulation to faxes containing advertising was
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; justified. The ban is evenhanded, in that it applies to commercial
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; solicitation by any organization,...&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The case law
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; is a bit complicated, but isn't obscure.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; No, it's not.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Not complicated, or not obscure?

&gt;&gt; In this case, which is the case you seem to want to cite,

&gt; As I have said several time, this case cites SCOTUS case law on the
&gt; regulation of commercial (and other) speech. Try to pay attention. I'm not
&gt; going to repeat it again.

"/>&quot;Regulation of commercial speech must directly advance a substantial
governmental interest in a manner that forms a &quot;reasonable fit&quot; with the
interest. {Central Hudson Gas and Electric Corp. v. Public Service
Comm'n},
447 U.S. 557, 566, 65 L. Ed. 2d 341, 100 S. Ct. 2343 (1980);

The burden is on the government to demonstrate the reasonable fit.
{Board of Trustees}, 492 U.S. at 480. The government's burden &quot;is not
satisfied
by mere speculation or conjecture; rather, a governmental body seeking to
sustain a
restriction on commercial speech must demonstrate that the harms it
recites are real
and that its restriction will in fact alleviate them to a material
degree.&quot;

I don't want to get into the economic debate of who *truly pays*, but the

less.

You've fail to follow along. That's what happens with over parsing a post.
There are many reasons why some law or other can fail or survive. The DNCL
can survive on constitutional free-speech grounds but it can fail when those
grounds are found to be irrelevant. The issue should have been fought on
the grounds that the caller has no constitutional right to use my appliance.

Commercial speech is given intermediate First Amendment protection,

supposedly granted the highest level of protection possible. What that
means in practice is a bit fuzzy -- at least, in the Sherriff of Nottingham's
court.

It seems to me that if the government initiated a do-not-call list that
enabled citizens to declare whether they wanted to receive charitable,
commercial, or even political calls, it would be constitutional. But it

&gt;&gt;&gt; So you wholeheartedly agree with the judge's decision, then? The

&gt;&gt;&gt; the telemarketers' numerous phone calls and listen to their spiels.
&gt;&gt;&gt; -Dave

&gt;&gt; No, the judge interpreted the First Amendment to say the government
&gt;&gt; can't prohibit the telemarketer from calling you based on the fact
&gt;&gt; that they don't prohibit charities from calling you.

&gt; Which is in clear conflict with existing case law. The judge is a retard.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Incorrect. The First Amendment prohibits the (U.S.) Government (and

&gt; It
&gt;&gt; gives them the

the

&gt;&gt;&gt; heard. The recipient of a message has every right to ignore it.

&gt;&gt; And the caller does not have the right to use my appliance to facilitate
&gt; his
&gt;&gt; right of free speech. He can say whatever he wants as much as he wants

&gt;&gt; his phone for as long as he wants. But where does it say he has to

"/>  I don't concur they have the right to interrupt me while I am eating
dinner; the only problem heretofore has been the technical question
of how to stop them from doing so. If I want to stop solicitors from
knocking on my door, I can put up a sign saying that they can't, and
they are required by law to respect that -- there is no First Amend-
ment right to trespass on my property for commercial purposes.

How is it any different for telemarketers?

The telephone is simply another mode of access to one's home,
and it is a facial invasion of one's privacy. Surely, the government
could stop that, consistent with the First Amendment. What they
cannot do is stop one set of commercial solicitors from knocking
on my door, but not another. Charitable and political speech are
different from commercial speech, according to the courts. But

low binding precedent....

exempting

"/>  It is a long-standing foundation of First Amendment law that prior

The law that was passed, by restricting commercial telemarketing calls,
but not political or charitable calls, clearly is restraining speech
based on its &quot;content&quot;. So, even though unpopular, the judge did make
the Constitutionally correct call. I believe that if the Congress had
passed a law that made the Do Not Call list apply to all telemarketers,
it would pass constitutional muster.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the number on superpages is his chambers number, not his home
&gt;&gt; number.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the Denver Post says that his staff disconnected the ringers
and
&gt;&gt; let
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the voice mailboxes fill up, in clear violation of the
callers'
&gt;&gt; first
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; amendment right to be heard

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; More BS. If there was a &quot;right to be heard&quot;, then the
&gt; telemarketers
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; have it also.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; So you wholeheartedly agree with the judge's decision, then? The
&gt;&gt; judge
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; interpreted the First Amendment to mean that you MUST accept the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; telemarketers' numerous phone calls and listen to their
&gt; piels. -Dave

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; No, the judge interpreted the First Amendment to say the government
&gt;&gt; can't
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; prohibit the telemarketer from calling you based on the fact that
they
&gt;&gt; don't
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; prohibit charities from calling you.

&gt;&gt;&gt; And again, that is nonsense -- even though it would be a good idea
&gt;&gt;&gt; to prohibit supposedly &quot;charitable&quot; telemarketing, as well. The two
&gt;&gt;&gt; are separate classes of speech under the First Amendment, and any
&gt;&gt;&gt; distinction consistent with the Commerce Clause should be constitu-
&gt;&gt;&gt; tional.

&gt;&gt; I don't see any difference between a charity/telemarketer asking for
money
&gt;&gt; and any other telemarketer trying to sell me something and apparently
&gt;&gt; neither did the judge from a First Amendment standpoint.

&gt; Actually, IIRC, the judge said that the violation rose from the fact that
&gt; the rule differentiated between charitable organizations and commercial
&gt; ones. So he apparently *did* see a difference.

"/> No, he said the law he was ruling on differentiated between them. He,
apparently, didn't think they should be treated differently so ruled the
charities were getting preferential treatment and their speech was being
regarded by the government as deserving greater protection, which the judge
apparently felt violated the First Amendment rights of the commercial
telemarketers. If anyone calling you seeking something of monetary value
were treated the same under the law, (e.g. prevented from calling anyone on
the list), then I don't think he would have decided the way he did. But, as
the FCC is now enforcing it, the whole thing seems moot since the ruling was
against the FTC.

speech greater protection. So content of the speech is an issue in certain
cases.

FTC was the protection of the consumer's privacy, but the FTC took away the
consumer's choice of privacy protection by exempting charitable calls asking
for money which made the government into censors of what calls can be made
and what calls you can elect not to receive.

"/> Reference? AFAIK prior restriants are themselves restricted - in

Here the issue is not what the marketer can say but how he can say it.
If the call says that Blotto pens are the greatest ever that's OK with
me and I think with the government. The issue is not that they say that
but that my rights are not to be violated when they say that. I have a
right not to be annoyd by their commercial speech. As with any law
Congress can make it selectively applicable - just like for states
grocery food may be exempt from sales taxes but restauarant meals are
not. I'd far prefer an absolute prohibition but that's not what the law
does.

The judge can't whip up a bogus &quot;free speech&quot; issue and then say that
all speech must be treated equally. That is not in any way what the
Consitution says. It says freedom of speech must not be impaired.
Period. It doens't say that if any speech is impaired then all speech
must be impaired the same way. That is not in the consitution.

based on Constitutional principles. The reasoning seems to be that the

that as ever surviving. It creates a whole new meaning that isn't there.

Granted there's lots of precedent. Ashcroft (and some before him) want
to change the absolute requirement for a search warrant based on
probable cause and naming the things sought to something far less

I'll put it a different way. Congress and the the FTC/FCC did not say
&quot;Here's categories of speech and here's where we will allow them.&quot;
That's forbidden, I'd say.

Instead they said &quot;Here's a mode of communication - one not pertinent to
free speech, one characterized by private conversations between parties
each of whom is willing to have the conversation. We forbid certain
uses of that mode of communication.&quot;

I'd say that restricting opponents of the President and his policies to
a designated &quot;free speech&quot; area remote from where the President is
appearing is a classic violation of the right of free speech.
Restricting those with such views selectively, in any manner, is a
violation of free speech. If the courts want to protect free speech
that's where they should direct their gaze.

Free speech is that which is untrammeled, unregulated. Forcing those
with particular points of view into a restricted area while allowing
those with opposite views to express themselves without restriction
anywhere is in violent opposition to the First Amendment - any President
fostering such behavior is violating his oath to uphold the
Constitution. Bogus reasons given for the restriction do not remove the
violation - bogus reasons never justify violations of the Constitution.
The Constitution has no &quot;bogus reason&quot; escape clause.

Grounds for impeachment - right there.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Out of curiosity, where did you stand on the Something Awful invasion
&gt;&gt;&gt; here? Did you find what they did abusive?

&gt;&gt; An attempt to disrupt the operation of a newsgroup by a group of petty
&gt;&gt; vandals who don't like their online hangout being called to account being
&gt;&gt; compared to voters and taxpayers expressing their opposition to a legal
&gt;&gt; decision that will directly influence the quality of their lives, hmmmmm,
&gt;&gt; something of a difference there.

&gt;&gt; I believe part of the problem with the law is judges making decisions that
&gt;&gt; fly in the face of what is right, ie. a burglar slips and falls while
&gt;&gt; breaking into your home and successfully sues you. I have no problem with
&gt;&gt; judges being made aware of just how out of tune they are with the real
&gt;&gt; world, sending threats etc. is another matter.

&gt; The clerk of the court's home number was posted. So it's ok with you
&gt; that everyone calls that number? You don't see anything wrong with
&gt; that? If not, post your number so everyone can call you to express
&gt; their disdain for the ruling, it will have the same effect on that judge
&gt; as calling the clerk will. Anyway, a coordinated attack on a phone
&gt; number designed to cause grief by excessive calls is abuse regardless of
&gt; how you cloak it.

their favorite tactics.

&gt;&gt; If, OTOH, the *people* who own those phone lines *each* decide to place
a
&gt;&gt; single call to that number, that would *not* be a &quot;denial of service
&gt; attack&quot;,
&gt;&gt; because in order to be a &quot;denial of service&quot; attack, it first has to
*be*
&gt; an
&gt;&gt;&quot;attack&quot; -- and it's not.

&gt; That point seems to be escaping some folks, this was taxpayers outraged
that
&gt; their privacy was once again to be thrown to the wolves by a judge who
cares
&gt; more about legal technicalities and getting his name in the history books
&gt; than about common sense. Taxpayers always have the right to be heard,
&gt; without them the courts would have to have pay toilets to pay the judges'
&gt; salaries.

"/> The point that seems to be escaping you is that we may as well not have
judges if all they're gonna do is decide questions of law based upon popular
sentiment. That's what we have the legislative branch of government for.

The people are heard over and over again. And they can even be heard in the
courts. But courts are where questions of law are decided, not popular
opinion.

&gt;&gt;&gt; It is a long-standing foundation of First Amendment law that prior
&gt;&gt;&gt; restraints on speech based on their content are not to be tolerated.

&gt;&gt;Reference? AFAIK prior restriants are themselves restricted - in
&gt;&gt;particular for non-commercial speech.

&gt;&gt;Here the issue is not what the marketer can say but how he can say it.
&gt;&gt;If the call says that Blotto pens are the greatest ever that's OK with
&gt;&gt;me and I think with the government. The issue is not that they say that
&gt;&gt;but that my rights are not to be violated when they say that. I have a
&gt;&gt;right not to be annoyd by their commercial speech. As with any law
&gt;&gt;Congress can make it selectively applicable - just like for states
&gt;&gt;grocery food may be exempt from sales taxes but restauarant meals are
&gt;&gt;not. I'd far prefer an absolute prohibition but that's not what the law
&gt;&gt;does.

&gt;&gt;The judge can't whip up a bogus &quot;free speech&quot; issue and then say that
&gt;&gt;all speech must be treated equally. That is not in any way what the
&gt;&gt;Consitution says. It says freedom of speech must not be impaired.
&gt;&gt;Period. It doens't say that if any speech is impaired then all speech
&gt;&gt;must be impaired the same way. That is not in the consitution.

&gt;&gt;&gt; The law that was passed, by restricting commercial telemarketing calls,
&gt;&gt;&gt; but not political or charitable calls, clearly is restraining speech
&gt;&gt;&gt; based on its &quot;content&quot;. So, even though unpopular, the judge did make
&gt;&gt;&gt; the Constitutionally correct call.

&gt;&gt;That's difficult for me to see. He made a call that he cast as being
&gt;&gt;based on Constitutional principles. The reasoning seems to be that the
&gt;&gt;material in the telemarketing calls is speech, therefore the
&gt;&gt;Constitutional prohibition against restricting speech holds, but only if
&gt;&gt;the speech is restricted differently from similar speech. I don't see
&gt;&gt;that as ever surviving. It creates a whole new meaning that isn't there.

&gt; If the judge *really* wanted to play the First Amendment card, and he
&gt; *really* wanted to be a stickler about it, he could have said that they
have
&gt; a right to *speak* into their telephones, but, they were not allowed to
&gt; *dial* them. (Or, they could dial them, but they could not plug the into
the
&gt; wall, etc.)

&gt; That he did what he did indicates IMO either ignorance, stupidity, or
&gt; arrogance -- arrogance combined with an agenda, namely, not hampering the
&gt; putative &quot;right&quot; of fonespamboyos to pester us against our will.

"/> The judge didn't play the card, the telemarketers did and the FTC stupidly
played along. It's the FTC who should have argued that free speech wasn't
the issue. The issue was maintaining control of my appliance and who uses
it to reach me.

always transposing two digits when they call for a cab at shutting-down
time, and getting us instead).

So long as *I* am the one requesting not to be called by some category of

where the existence of other categories has anything to do with it.

&gt; Yes, but the judge cited other First Amendment cases involving commercial
&gt; speech for that ruling.

&gt;&gt; The FTC should have taken free-speech out of it and made
&gt;&gt; it's case on the basis that consumers have the right, by whatever means
&gt; they
&gt;&gt; chose, to keep others from using their appliances.

&gt; You do, but the FTC isn't giving you that choice. You either use the FTC
&gt; content based guidelines on who you can block you you can't block. That's
&gt; not a choice. The government shouldn't be in the business of deciding who
&gt; can call me based on content. They should just enforce the consumer's
&gt; absoute right to be left alone, period. The same reason when you fill out
&gt; the form at the PO that says you find a mailing objectionable, the PO
can't
&gt; look at the content and disagree.

"/> In the case of the PO, they're not using my appliance, my service, and my
electricity to do it. All that you've said above still reies on the issue
of content of speech. The point I'm making is that speech is irrelavant.

Let's take an analogy of trespass. I have the right to keep anyone off my
property for whatever reason. It could be because they wear red pants,
because they're black, or because I don't like what they say. It doesn't
matter. It's my property. In that case, the government wouldn't be
enforcing the speech, race, or fashion issues, they'd be enforcing the
trespass.

Let's take that issue one step further. Let's say that I let the government
decide for me who fits into which catagories. Again, forgetting the
practical ramifications, what is it that I'm asking the government to do?
There's no constitutional protection against being classified. The
government does it all the time. Just look at your cencus. And as to
enfocement, they wouldn't be punishing anyone for what they say, just for
using my appiance against my will. No one has that constitutional
protection either.

IOW, no one would be penalized for saying whatever it is they want to say.
They would just get penalized for using my stuff to say it.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; If the consumer
&gt;&gt; voluntarily chooses to let the FTC, or anyone else, decide who can get
&gt;&gt; through their filter in order to access the bell on the consumers'
phone,
&gt; no
&gt;&gt; constitutional right has been violated.

&gt; Yes, in the court's opinion the FTC has set itself up as the censor and is
&gt; deciding for the consumer who they will block and won't block based on
&gt; content.

"/> Again, see above. I'm afraid you've been seduced in the same way that the
FTC was. The telemarketer would not be cencored. They just wouldn't have
the ability to use what belongs to me. I can prevent anyone from using
anything I own if that's what I so choose. IOW, when someone calls, I can
ask if the government considers them a telemarketer. If they say yes, I can
hang up strickly on that basis alone. In that case, I'm letting the
government decide who a telemarketer is and whether or not I want to let
them use my phone.

So what's wrong with telling the FTC that I no longer want to let anyone
whom they consider a telemarketer from using my phone. I wouldn't be asking
the government to sanction the telemarketer for what they said, but rather,
for using my phone. Certainly, the underlying reason might be because of
their classification, but just as in the case of trespass, the undelying
reason is not the offense, the use of the phone is.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; The whole lynch-pin of the telemarketers arguments, and of the judges
&gt;&gt; decision, is free speech. Take speech out of the equation, and their
&gt; whole
&gt;&gt; case falls apart.

&gt; You can't take free speech out of the argument because that's the
argument.
&gt; The government decided that telemarketing calls are an annoyance and
&gt; invasion of privacy. Great. All telemarketing calls are equally invasive.
&gt; None should be getting special protection based on content. It's not the
&gt; role of the government to decide what is OK telemarketing and what isn't
if
&gt; they're going to claim that they're all equally invasive.

"/> I'd just be repeating myself here. Please see the above.

"/> No. In fact, TCPA has exemptions for non-commercial phone calls because
SCOTUS case law requires such exemptions. Phones aren't really private
property. You don't any your phone line, any more than the average email
user owns his mailbox. The mailbox belongs to his IPS, and your phone line
belongs to the phone company. In both cases, there is a degree of &quot;my
network, my rules&quot;, and the &quot;my&quot; does not refer to you. Since the phone
company has no problem whatseover with telemarketing - they make money from
it whether the telemarketers do or not - why should &quot;my network, my rules&quot;
apply to your mail server, but not the telephone company's lines?

There are differences, however. Telephone service is a regulated utility,
and phone companies are common carriers. Internet service isn't. That means
that private property rules apply to internet service in ways that they
don't to telephone service.

And that is why TCPA (and the DNC list) have exemptions required by case
law for non-commercial speech. The phone system is a public resource, even
if it is run on private equipment.

&gt; No. In fact, TCPA has exemptions for non-commercial phone calls because
&gt; SCOTUS case law requires such exemptions. Phones aren't really private
&gt; property. You don't any your phone line, any more than the average email

popular

&gt; *LMAO*

&gt; What we have here is just the opposite -- judges deciding questions upon
&gt; UNpopular sentiment! Unpopular, but, *very* well-heeled, and *extremely*
&gt; influential.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It is a long-standing foundation of First Amendment law that
prior

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Reference? AFAIK prior restriants are themselves restricted - in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;particular for non-commercial speech.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Here the issue is not what the marketer can say but how he can say it.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;If the call says that Blotto pens are the greatest ever that's OK with
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;me and I think with the government. The issue is not that they say
that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;but that my rights are not to be violated when they say that. I have
a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;right not to be annoyd by their commercial speech. As with any law
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Congress can make it selectively applicable - just like for states
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;grocery food may be exempt from sales taxes but restauarant meals are
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;not. I'd far prefer an absolute prohibition but that's not what the
law
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;does.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The judge can't whip up a bogus &quot;free speech&quot; issue and then say that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;all speech must be treated equally. That is not in any way what the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Consitution says. It says freedom of speech must not be impaired.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Period. It doens't say that if any speech is impaired then all speech
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;must be impaired the same way. That is not in the consitution.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The law that was passed, by restricting commercial telemarketing
calls,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; but not political or charitable calls, clearly is restraining speech
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; based on its &quot;content&quot;. So, even though unpopular, the judge did
make
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the Constitutionally correct call.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;That's difficult for me to see. He made a call that he cast as being
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;based on Constitutional principles. The reasoning seems to be that
the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;material in the telemarketing calls is speech, therefore the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Constitutional prohibition against restricting speech holds, but only
if
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the speech is restricted differently from similar speech. I don't see
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;that as ever surviving. It creates a whole new meaning that isn't
there.

&gt;&gt;&gt; If the judge *really* wanted to play the First Amendment card, and he
&gt;&gt;&gt; *really* wanted to be a stickler about it, he could have said that they
&gt;&gt;have
&gt;&gt;&gt; a right to *speak* into their telephones, but, they were not allowed to
&gt;&gt;&gt; *dial* them. (Or, they could dial them, but they could not plug the
into
&gt;&gt;the
&gt;&gt;&gt; wall, etc.)

&gt;&gt;&gt; That he did what he did indicates IMO either ignorance, stupidity, or
&gt;&gt;&gt; arrogance -- arrogance combined with an agenda, namely, not hampering
the
&gt;&gt;&gt; putative &quot;right&quot; of fonespamboyos to pester us against our will.

&gt;&gt;The judge didn't play the card, the telemarketers did and the FTC
stupidly
&gt;&gt;played along. It's the FTC who should have argued that free speech
wasn't
&gt;&gt;the issue. The issue was maintaining control of my appliance and who
uses
&gt;&gt;it to reach me.

&gt; The court backed up the Frea Speach lie.

you
&gt;&gt;&gt; can block.

&gt;&gt;But all on free-speech grounds. The 1st Amendment is the underpinning of
&gt;&gt;the whole case. The FTC should have taken free-speech out of it and made
&gt;&gt;it's case on the basis that consumers have the right, by whatever means
they
&gt;&gt;chose, to keep others from using their appliances. If the consumer
&gt;&gt;voluntarily chooses to let the FTC, or anyone else, decide who can get
&gt;&gt;through their filter in order to access the bell on the consumers' phone,
no
&gt;&gt;constitutional right has been violated.

&gt;&gt;The whole lynch-pin of the telemarketers arguments, and of the judges
&gt;&gt;decision, is free speech. Take speech out of the equation, and their
whole
&gt;&gt;case falls apart.

&gt; And by the same token, leave it IN, and *our* whole case (my server, my

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The FTC _couldn't_ do that.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If the FTC came up with a database that allowed you
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to select:
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; A. Block all marketing calls no matter who they're from B. Block
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; only commercial telemarketers C. Block only charity requests

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; See above. They can only regulate commercial activity.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Then I believe the judge wouldn't have blocked the law as the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; FTC wasn't making decisions for you on who should be blocked.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This is moot as enforcement has passed to the FCC and there are a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; raft of TCPA decisions on this which would invalidate any attempts
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to stop them doing so.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; IIRC, all of which on based upon speech. None of them have
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; anything to do with the unauthorized use of the possessions or
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; services of others.

&gt;&gt;&gt; No. In fact, TCPA has exemptions for non-commercial phone calls
&gt;&gt;&gt; because SCOTUS case law requires such exemptions. Phones aren't
&gt;&gt;&gt; really private property. You don't any your phone line, any more than
&gt;&gt;&gt; the average email user owns his mailbox. The mailbox belongs to his
&gt;&gt;&gt; IPS, and your phone line belongs to the phone company. In both cases,
&gt;&gt;&gt; there is a degree of &quot;my network, my rules&quot;, and the &quot;my&quot; does not
&gt;&gt;&gt; refer to you. Since the phone company has no problem whatseover with
&gt;&gt;&gt; telemarketing - they make money
&gt;&gt; from
&gt;&gt;&gt; it whether the telemarketers do or not - why should &quot;my network, my
&gt;&gt;&gt; rules&quot; apply to your mail server, but not the telephone company's
&gt;&gt;&gt; lines?

&gt;&gt; But I own the phone, the bell in the phone, and the electricity to
&gt;&gt; make it work.

&gt; I own my computer, the modem, and the electricty to make it work.

&gt;&gt; Phone lines might not be private property, but when I
&gt;&gt; went to Wall-Mart and bought my phone, it became *my* phone.

&gt; Mailboxes might not be mine, but when I signed up with my ISP, and bought
&gt; my computer, it became *my* computer.

&gt; The analogy is very close.

"/> But still not quite. Look, there are no absolutes and no clear lines of
demarkation with hardly anything in life. With most things, we can up with
analogies which very closely related, but eventually, we get pretty far
apart. In the case of spam, it would have been very tough to claim that the
spammer uses more electricity than would otherwise have been consumed, or
that the life of the computer was *consumed* more than it otherwise would
have been. That's probably why the argument was never made, although, quite
frankly, I think it should have been.

But in this case, the argument is much more clear and most definately should
be made.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Why does &quot;my network, my rules&quot; apply to your mail server, but not the

"/> It can apply to the line, just not my phone.

&gt;&gt; There are differences, however. Telephone service is a regulated

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt; utility, and phone companies are common carriers. Internet service
&gt;&gt;&gt; isn't. That
&gt;&gt; means
&gt;&gt;&gt; that private property rules apply to internet service in ways that
&gt;&gt;&gt; they don't to telephone service.

&gt;&gt;&gt; And that is why TCPA (and the DNC list) have exemptions required by
&gt;&gt;&gt; case law for non-commercial speech. The phone system is a public
&gt;&gt;&gt; resource, even if it is run on private equipment.

&gt;&gt; Which is why this fight should never have been about speech.

&gt; I agree. But the FTC didn't make it about speech, the telescum did. If the
&gt; FTC hadn't address the free speech issues, they would have lost by
default,
&gt; and had no grounds for an appeal.

"/> I'm walking down the street, minding my own business and not saying a word,
and suddenly, you come by and start ranting that I'm infringing upon your
right to free speech. You take me to court. Your brief is full of case law
concerning the right to free speech in a public place and how what you were
saying is allowed, and how my presence there infringed upon your rights. I
now have a choice. I can try to discredit your claim on the basis that your
case law is faulty and that what you were saying wasn't really protected
speech, or I can simply make the case that your right to free speech had
nothing to do with what I was doing.

That's what the FTC should have argued. They should have stipulated as to
rights of the telemarketer to say whatever they want, and that the speech
was only the cause for the abuse that the rule was protecting against; the
unauthorized use of property.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;It's
&gt;&gt; about the unauthorized use of my stuff.

&gt; No, it's about privacy. Becuse that's a fight we can win. &quot;My network, my
&gt; rules&quot; is a fight the telephone companies _might_ be able to win, but they
&gt; aren't interested in fighting it. But privacy, we *can* win, and *have*
&gt; won, many times.

"/> But the FTC should have argued that the free speech argument wasn't
applicable. What would have happened if the telemarketers would have argued
that the issue was racism, or slander, or any other argument. It has to
have some applicability. The FTC never tried to force the telemarketers
that the free speech issue even applied. In fact, they wrongly acknowledged
that it did apply by arguing it.

&gt; In the case of the PO, they're not using my appliance, my service, and my

&gt; of content of speech. The point I'm making is that speech is irrelavant.

"/> The rules aren't put in place because they're using your &quot;stuff&quot; they're put
in place because it's an invasion of priavcy and your right to be left

there's no cost to you. IIRC, it's already illegal for them to call your
cell phone.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; Let's take an analogy of trespass. I have the right to keep anyone off my
&gt; property for whatever reason. It could be because they wear red pants,
&gt; because they're black, or because I don't like what they say. It doesn't
&gt; matter. It's my property. In that case, the government wouldn't be
&gt; enforcing the speech, race, or fashion issues, they'd be enforcing the
&gt; trespass.

"/> But in this case, the government is saying it's OK for charities to
tresspass based on the message they're delivering.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Let's take that issue one step further. Let's say that I let the
government
&gt; decide for me who fits into which catagories. Again, forgetting the
&gt; practical ramifications, what is it that I'm asking the government to do?

"/> You're asking the government to censor, which I don't think they can set
themself up to do, regardless of whether or not you want them to.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; IOW, no one would be penalized for saying whatever it is they want to say.
&gt; They would just get penalized for using my stuff to say it.

"/> That isn't the bases for the do-not-call list because there is no cost to
you there is no governmental interest in preventing anyone from calling you
on that basis.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;&gt; If the consumer

&gt;&gt; Yes, in the court's opinion the FTC has set itself up as the censor and
is
&gt;&gt; deciding for the consumer who they will block and won't block based on
&gt;&gt; content.

&gt; Again, see above. I'm afraid you've been seduced in the same way that the
&gt; FTC was.

"/> Then the FTC seduced themselves as the law isn't based on someone using your
stuff like the junk fax law.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; The telemarketer would not be cencored. They just wouldn't have
&gt; the ability to use what belongs to me. I can prevent anyone from using
&gt; anything I own if that's what I so choose. IOW, when someone calls, I can
&gt; ask if the government considers them a telemarketer. If they say yes, I
can
&gt; hang up strickly on that basis alone.

"/> The government considers the charities that call you telemarketers and
usually it's the same telemarketers that call to solicit for charities as

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

"/> According to the judge, the government can't agree to take on that role.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; So what's wrong with telling the FTC that I no longer want to let anyone
&gt; whom they consider a telemarketer from using my phone.

"/> If they ever pass such a law, maybe you can try it. If that was the case
now, all telemarketing calls would be blocked since they consider all of
them to be telemarketers.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I wouldn't be asking
&gt; the government to sanction the telemarketer for what they said, but
rather,

"/> Lobby for such a law then. That's not the basis for the do-not-call list.
There is no mention of &quot;your equipment&quot; in the law.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Certainly, the underlying reason might be because of

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; That is the judge's point it seems to me from a little more than a
&gt; cursory
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; glance at the ruling. It's the FTC, not you, making the choice on who
&gt; you
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; can block.

&gt;&gt;&gt;But all on free-speech grounds. The 1st Amendment is the underpinning
of
&gt;&gt;&gt;the whole case. The FTC should have taken free-speech out of it and
made
&gt;&gt;&gt;it's case on the basis that consumers have the right, by whatever means
&gt; they
&gt;&gt;&gt;chose, to keep others from using their appliances. If the consumer
&gt;&gt;&gt;voluntarily chooses to let the FTC, or anyone else, decide who can get
&gt;&gt;&gt;through their filter in order to access the bell on the consumers'
phone,
&gt; no
&gt;&gt;&gt;constitutional right has been violated.

&gt;&gt;&gt;The whole lynch-pin of the telemarketers arguments, and of the judges
&gt;&gt;&gt;decision, is free speech. Take speech out of the equation, and their
&gt; whole
&gt;&gt;&gt;case falls apart.

&gt;&gt; And by the same token, leave it IN, and *our* whole case (my server, my
&gt;&gt; rules, etc.) falls apart.

&gt;&gt; There is a LOT at stake here.

&gt; No shit.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The FTC _couldn't_ do that.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If the FTC came up with a database that allowed you
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to select:
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; A. Block all marketing calls no matter who they're from B.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Block only commercial telemarketers C. Block only charity
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; requests

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; See above. They can only regulate commercial activity.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Then I believe the judge wouldn't have blocked the law as the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; FTC wasn't making decisions for you on who should be blocked.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This is moot as enforcement has passed to the FCC and there are
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a raft of TCPA decisions on this which would invalidate any
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; attempts to stop them doing so.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; IIRC, all of which on based upon speech. None of them have
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; anything to do with the unauthorized use of the possessions or
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; services of others.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; No. In fact, TCPA has exemptions for non-commercial phone calls
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; because SCOTUS case law requires such exemptions. Phones aren't
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; really private property. You don't any your phone line, any more
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; than the average email user owns his mailbox. The mailbox belongs
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to his IPS, and your phone line belongs to the phone company. In
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; both cases, there is a degree of &quot;my network, my rules&quot;, and the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;my&quot; does not refer to you. Since the phone company has no problem
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; whatseover with telemarketing - they make money
&gt;&gt;&gt; from
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; it whether the telemarketers do or not - why should &quot;my network,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; my rules&quot; apply to your mail server, but not the telephone
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; company's lines?

&gt;&gt;&gt; But I own the phone, the bell in the phone, and the electricity to
&gt;&gt;&gt; make it work.

&gt;&gt; I own my computer, the modem, and the electricty to make it work.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Phone lines might not be private property, but when I
&gt;&gt;&gt; went to Wall-Mart and bought my phone, it became *my* phone.

&gt;&gt; Mailboxes might not be mine, but when I signed up with my ISP, and
&gt;&gt; bought my computer, it became *my* computer.

&gt;&gt; The analogy is very close.

&gt; But still not quite. Look, there are no absolutes and no clear lines
&gt; of demarkation with hardly anything in life.

"/> True. And telemarketing is not a property right.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; With most things, we can
&gt; up with analogies which very closely related, but eventually, we get

"/> Or we can look at case law, which in the case is very clear.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;In the case of spam, it would have been very tough
&gt; to claim that the spammer uses more electricity than would otherwise
&gt; have been consumed, or that the life of the computer was *consumed*
&gt; more than it otherwise would have been. That's probably why the
&gt; argument was never made, although, quite frankly, I think it should
&gt; have been.

"/> Spam, right now, is really a property rights issue. Telemarketing isn't.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; But in this case, the argument is much more clear and most definately
&gt; should be made.

&gt;&gt; Why does &quot;my network, my rules&quot; apply to your mail server, but not
&gt;&gt; the phone company's phone line?

&gt; It can apply to the line, just not my phone.

"/> Case law says otherwise. Deal with it.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;&gt; There are differences, however. Telephone service is a regulated
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; utility, and phone companies are common carriers. Internet service
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; isn't. That
&gt;&gt;&gt; means
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that private property rules apply to internet service in ways that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; they don't to telephone service.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; And that is why TCPA (and the DNC list) have exemptions required
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; by case law for non-commercial speech. The phone system is a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; public resource, even if it is run on private equipment.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Which is why this fight should never have been about speech.

&gt;&gt; I agree. But the FTC didn't make it about speech, the telescum did.
&gt;&gt; If the FTC hadn't address the free speech issues, they would have
&gt;&gt; lost by
&gt; default,
&gt;&gt; and had no grounds for an appeal.

&gt; I'm walking down the street, minding my own business and not saying a
&gt; word, and suddenly, you come by and start ranting that I'm infringing
&gt; upon your right to free speech. You take me to court. Your brief is
&gt; full of case law concerning the right to free speech in a public place
&gt; and how what you were saying is allowed, and how my presence there
&gt; infringed upon your rights. I now have a choice. I can try to
&gt; discredit your claim on the basis that your case law is faulty and
&gt; that what you were saying wasn't really protected speech, or I can
&gt; simply make the case that your right to free speech had nothing to do
&gt; with what I was doing.

"/> If you don't address the issues in the complaint, you'll lose. You can
address them by saying &quot;There's no legal basis for a free speech argument,&quot;
but that is still addressing the issue.

Most courts frown on defenses that have nothing to do with the complaint.
The the argument was that telemarketing is a property ownership issue,
which is *clearly* is *not*, based on extensive case law. Get over it.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; That's what the FTC should have argued. They should have stipulated
&gt; as to rights of the telemarketer to say whatever they want, and that
&gt; the speech was only the cause for the abuse that the rule was

"/> No, they handled it entirely correctly. The complaint made an argument that
has been shot down every single time it has been brought to court. At this
point, they are as close to guaranteed to win the appeal as it gets in a US
court. The judge didn't just make a mistake, he made an obvious, and
unforgivable mistake. He might as well have ruled that the Constitution
doesn't apply in his court. His ruling is *that* bad.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

"/> No, they should have argued that there were no issues in this matter, and
that the exact same restrictions have been applied in federal and state
court before, and upheld at the Supreme Court level ever time. I suspect
they *did* argue that.

I honestly wonder if the judge was actually bribed in this. It's the only
thing that makes sense. That, or serious brain damage recently.

In any event, it's obvious that no argument the FTC could have presented
would have made any difference to this retard. As it is, they have a very
clear appeal, and they will win. Obscuring the issue by trying to change
the subject is not a good idea, when you're already clearly in the right.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; It has to have some applicability. The FTC never tried to force the

argued?

This is not a new legal issue. It's been tried, and lost, many times by
telemarketers. It will be again. It's routine.

&gt;&gt; In the case of the PO, they're not using my appliance, my service, and
my
&gt;&gt; electricity to do it. All that you've said above still reies on the
issue
&gt;&gt; of content of speech. The point I'm making is that speech is
irrelavant.

&gt; The rules aren't put in place because they're using your &quot;stuff&quot; they're
put
&gt; in place because it's an invasion of priavcy and your right to be left
&gt; alone. The courts don't care about them calling on your phone because
&gt; there's no cost to you. IIRC, it's already illegal for them to call your
&gt; cell phone.

"/> The point I'm trying to get across is not how the arguments were made. We
know how they were made and we know the result. My point is how they should
have been made. To that end, let's take the issue of trespass. If someone
trespasses on my property, it may not cost me a dime, but they still don't
have the right to do it. What's more, the courts will enforce my right,
even if the reason why I don't want someone on my property is because of
what they say.

If we currently have no laws on the books WRT the use of another's property
(similar to trespass), then let's do so and go to battle again.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Let's take an analogy of trespass. I have the right to keep anyone off
my
&gt;&gt; property for whatever reason. It could be because they wear red pants,
&gt;&gt; because they're black, or because I don't like what they say. It
doesn't
&gt;&gt; matter. It's my property. In that case, the government wouldn't be
&gt;&gt; enforcing the speech, race, or fashion issues, they'd be enforcing the
&gt;&gt; trespass.

&gt; But in this case, the government is saying it's OK for charities to
&gt; tresspass based on the message they're delivering.

"/> The government is providing me with a way to tell commercial telemarketers
not to use my stuff. the fact that they don't provide the same service for
other types of callers is irrelevant. The governmant isn't saying that it's
OK for charities to call, they're just not giving me a way to keep them from
doing so.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Let's take that issue one step further. Let's say that I let the
&gt; government
&gt;&gt; decide for me who fits into which catagories. Again, forgetting the
&gt;&gt; practical ramifications, what is it that I'm asking the government to
do?

&gt; You're asking the government to censor, which I don't think they can set
&gt; themself up to do, regardless of whether or not you want them to.

"/> Now your over parsing my post and jumping ahead to a point I've yet to make.
Stay with me. At the point in the process where all the government has done
is catagorize callers, has the government infringed on anyone's rights?
We'll get to what I do with that catagorization later.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; IOW, no one would be penalized for saying whatever it is they want to
say.
&gt;&gt; They would just get penalized for using my stuff to say it.

&gt; That isn't the bases for the do-not-call list because there is no cost to
&gt; you there is no governmental interest in preventing anyone from calling
you
&gt; on that basis.

"/> The point of the do not call list, starts with the interruption of my peace
at home with an unwanted ring. The fact that they *aren't* saying anything
I'm interested in hearing is actually more significant than any objection
that I have as to what they *are* saying. If they called and said nothing,
I'd still be pissed. If you probe all those who favor the DNCL, I'm sure
the overwhelming majority would agree. Therefore, the point of the DNCL is
not to censor, it's to keep telemarketers from disturbing me. In order to
disturb me, they need to use my stuff. Whereas they have no constitutional
right to use my stuff, they have no right to be protected from my preventing
them from calling me.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If the consumer
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; voluntarily chooses to let the FTC, or anyone else, decide who can
get

&gt;&gt; phone,
&gt;&gt;&gt; no
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; constitutional right has been violated.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Yes, in the court's opinion the FTC has set itself up as the censor
and
&gt; is
&gt;&gt;&gt; deciding for the consumer who they will block and won't block based on
&gt;&gt;&gt; content.

&gt;&gt; Again, see above. I'm afraid you've been seduced in the same way that
the
&gt;&gt; FTC was.

&gt; Then the FTC seduced themselves as the law isn't based on someone using
your
&gt; stuff like the junk fax law.

"/> That's your opinion. And if it's correct, then amend the law and go right
back to market.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; The telemarketer would not be cencored. They just wouldn't have
&gt;&gt; the ability to use what belongs to me. I can prevent anyone from using

can
&gt;&gt; ask if the government considers them a telemarketer. If they say yes, I
&gt; can
&gt;&gt; hang up strickly on that basis alone.

&gt; The government considers the charities that call you telemarketers and
&gt; usually it's the same telemarketers that call to solicit for charities as
&gt; for long distance companies.

"/> so what?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; In that case, I'm letting the
&gt;&gt; government decide who a telemarketer is and whether or not I want to let
&gt;&gt; them use my phone.

&gt; According to the judge, the government can't agree to take on that role.

"/> I know what the decision was. That's the basis of this debate. If it's all
gonna come back to what the judge decided, we're wasting our time on
debating what he should have decided, or on what arguments were made or
should have been made.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; So what's wrong with telling the FTC that I no longer want to let anyone
&gt;&gt; whom they consider a telemarketer from using my phone.

&gt; If they ever pass such a law, maybe you can try it. If that was the case
&gt; now, all telemarketing calls would be blocked since they consider all of
&gt; them to be telemarketers.

"/> You're starting down the slippery slope of semantics now, and it's a game
I'm not gonna play. The government has distinguished between commercial and
other telemarketers. So I'll ask the question again, but with the
corrections you seem to crave: So what's wrong with telling the FTC that I
no longer want to let anyone whom they consider a *commercial* telemarketer
from using my phone?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; I wouldn't be asking
&gt;&gt; the government to sanction the telemarketer for what they said, but
&gt; rather,
&gt;&gt; for using my phone.

&gt; Lobby for such a law then. That's not the basis for the do-not-call list.
&gt; There is no mention of &quot;your equipment&quot; in the law.

"/> There doesn't have to be.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Certainly, the underlying reason might be because of
&gt;&gt; their classification, but just as in the case of trespass, the undelying
&gt;&gt; reason is not the offense, the use of the phone is.

&gt; They never touch or use your phone. You use your phone they use their

"/> phone.

Of course they use my phone. The test of use in not touch. If your
neighbor has a remote control that just happens to work with your TV and he
uses it to watch your TV when you're not home, did he use your TV and
consume your electricity just because he didn't touch it?

Please tell me this isn't gonna degenerate into another one of those hair
splitting semantically, over parsed discussions that's doomed to

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; That is the judge's point it seems to me from a little more than a
&gt;&gt; cursory
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; glance at the ruling. It's the FTC, not you, making the choice on
who
&gt;&gt; you
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; can block.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;But all on free-speech grounds. The 1st Amendment is the
underpinning
&gt; of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the whole case. The FTC should have taken free-speech out of it and
&gt; made
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;it's case on the basis that consumers have the right, by whatever
means
&gt;&gt; they
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;chose, to keep others from using their appliances. If the consumer
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;voluntarily chooses to let the FTC, or anyone else, decide who can
get
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;through their filter in order to access the bell on the consumers'
&gt; phone,
&gt;&gt; no
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;constitutional right has been violated.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The whole lynch-pin of the telemarketers arguments, and of the judges
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;decision, is free speech. Take speech out of the equation, and their
&gt;&gt; whole
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;case falls apart.

&gt;&gt;&gt; And by the same token, leave it IN, and *our* whole case (my server,
my
&gt;&gt;&gt; rules, etc.) falls apart.

&gt;&gt;&gt; There is a LOT at stake here.

&gt;&gt; No shit.

&gt; No, there isn't as it has zero to do with using your property. The use of
&gt; your property is not covered in the law in any way.

"/> Probably only because it wasn't argued. But if it isn't, then it's a simple
fix.

So do you agree that if the rule is changed to include the use of anothers
property (i.e., their phone) as an offense, the law would be fine?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The FTC _couldn't_ do that.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If the FTC came up with a database that allowed you
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to select:
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; A. Block all marketing calls no matter who they're from B.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Block only commercial telemarketers C. Block only charity
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; requests

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; See above. They can only regulate commercial activity.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Then I believe the judge wouldn't have blocked the law as the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; FTC wasn't making decisions for you on who should be blocked.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This is moot as enforcement has passed to the FCC and there are
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a raft of TCPA decisions on this which would invalidate any
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; attempts to stop them doing so.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; IIRC, all of which on based upon speech. None of them have
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; anything to do with the unauthorized use of the possessions or
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; services of others.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; No. In fact, TCPA has exemptions for non-commercial phone calls
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; because SCOTUS case law requires such exemptions. Phones aren't
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; really private property. You don't any your phone line, any more
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; than the average email user owns his mailbox. The mailbox belongs
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to his IPS, and your phone line belongs to the phone company. In
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; both cases, there is a degree of &quot;my network, my rules&quot;, and the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;my&quot; does not refer to you. Since the phone company has no problem
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; whatseover with telemarketing - they make money
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; from
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; it whether the telemarketers do or not - why should &quot;my network,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; my rules&quot; apply to your mail server, but not the telephone
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; company's lines?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; But I own the phone, the bell in the phone, and the electricity to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; make it work.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I own my computer, the modem, and the electricty to make it work.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Phone lines might not be private property, but when I
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; went to Wall-Mart and bought my phone, it became *my* phone.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Mailboxes might not be mine, but when I signed up with my ISP, and
&gt;&gt;&gt; bought my computer, it became *my* computer.

&gt;&gt;&gt; The analogy is very close.

&gt;&gt; But still not quite. Look, there are no absolutes and no clear lines
&gt;&gt; of demarkation with hardly anything in life.

&gt;&gt;&gt; There are differences, however. Telephone service is a regulated

they
&gt;&gt;&gt; don't to telephone service.

&gt;&gt;&gt; And that is why TCPA (and the DNC list) have exemptions required by
case

&gt;&gt;&gt; if it is run on private equipment.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; That is the judge's point it seems to me from a little more than
a
&gt;&gt;&gt; cursory
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; glance at the ruling. It's the FTC, not you, making the choice on
&gt; who
&gt;&gt;&gt; you
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; can block.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;But all on free-speech grounds. The 1st Amendment is the
&gt; underpinning
&gt;&gt; of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the whole case. The FTC should have taken free-speech out of it
and
&gt;&gt; made
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;it's case on the basis that consumers have the right, by whatever
&gt; means
&gt;&gt;&gt; they
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;chose, to keep others from using their appliances. If the consumer
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;voluntarily chooses to let the FTC, or anyone else, decide who can
&gt; get
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;through their filter in order to access the bell on the consumers'
&gt;&gt; phone,
&gt;&gt;&gt; no
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;constitutional right has been violated.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The whole lynch-pin of the telemarketers arguments, and of the
judges
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;decision, is free speech. Take speech out of the equation, and
their
&gt;&gt;&gt; whole
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;case falls apart.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; And by the same token, leave it IN, and *our* whole case (my server,
&gt; my
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; rules, etc.) falls apart.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; There is a LOT at stake here.

&gt;&gt;&gt; No shit.

&gt;&gt; No, there isn't as it has zero to do with using your property. The use
of
&gt;&gt; your property is not covered in the law in any way.

&gt; Probably only because it wasn't argued.

&gt;&gt;&gt; That's what the FTC should have argued. They should have stipulated

&gt; speech
&gt;&gt;&gt; was only the cause for the abuse that the rule was protecting against;

&gt;&gt; Except the law says nothing about use of anyone's property. It's all
about
&gt;&gt; invasion of privacy and classifying types of speech. School band candy
&gt; sales
&gt;&gt; calls are somehow better than Hershey Co. candy bar sales calls. The FTC

&gt;&gt;&gt; Nope. The government is categorizing different types of callers based
&gt;&gt; upon
&gt;&gt;&gt; the content of their speech. I'm accepting their methodology of
&gt;&gt;&gt; categorization and indicating that I don't want callers of a
particular
&gt;&gt; type
&gt;&gt;&gt; to use my phone, my electricity, and my phone service.

&gt;&gt; You can accept it, but this judge feels the government doesn't have the
&gt;&gt; right to categorize basically identical forms of speech as good and bad.

&gt; And he's right. but the government isn't saying that one is good or bad.
&gt; They're leaving that to me.

"/> No, they're not since they won't block all sales calls. They're telling you
which you can block with the DNC. You don't have the choice. It's commercial
or nothing, even though they admit they're both bad.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; The
&gt;&gt; call selling you school band candy is allowed, but the call from Hershey

"/> Fine, but by me it's not.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; They're also not using your phone. You are using your phone to listen to
&gt;&gt; them, which you don't have to do. Since, unlike your server and the disk
&gt;&gt; space that spam takes up, your phone is no less usable after a

&gt;&gt; calls than before.

it's
&gt;&gt; my
&gt;&gt;&gt; right to make that call.

&gt;&gt; Yes, but not the government's right.

&gt; Fine, but they're not the one's who decided. I did.

"/> No, they never gave you that choice. They made the choice for you and said

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The point that seems to be escaping you is that we may as well not
have
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;judges if all they're gonna do is decide questions of law based upon
&gt;&gt;popular
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;sentiment. That's what we have the legislative branch of government
for.

&gt;&gt;&gt; *LMAO*

&gt;&gt;&gt; What we have here is just the opposite -- judges deciding questions
upon
&gt;&gt;&gt; UNpopular sentiment! Unpopular, but, *very* well-heeled, and
*extremely*
&gt;&gt;&gt; influential.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Your argument boils down to &quot;shut up and eat your spam&quot; -- a remedy
that I
&gt;&gt;&gt; will politely characterise as &quot;discredited.&quot;

&gt;&gt;If you've followed any of this you'd know that I think the decision was
&gt;&gt;wrongly argued and decided. However, you seem to keep confusing the law,
&gt;&gt;popular opinion, and motivation. Try to think a little logically. A
judge
&gt;&gt;has no business deciding cases by taking a poll to see what the people
want
&gt;&gt;him to do.

&gt; Then by all means let's get rid of juries, shall we?

"/> If they're made up of peaople like you, yes, let's get rid of juries.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; But I digress. My point is that the courts *are* deciding issues based on
&gt; what *some* people want. Those people are called &quot;interests&quot;, of the

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If, OTOH, the *people* who own those phone lines *each* decide to
place
&gt;&gt;a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; single call to that number, that would *not* be a &quot;denial of service

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; because in order to be a &quot;denial of service&quot; attack, it first has to
&gt;&gt;*be*
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;an
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;attack&quot; -- and it's not.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;That point seems to be escaping some folks, this was taxpayers
outraged
&gt;&gt;that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;their privacy was once again to be thrown to the wolves by a judge who
&gt;&gt;cares
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;more about legal technicalities and getting his name in the history
books
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;than about common sense. Taxpayers always have the right to be heard,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;without them the courts would have to have pay toilets to pay the
judges'
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;salaries.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Bingo. Some people seem to be of the opinion that if ten thousand
people
&gt;&gt;are
&gt;&gt;&gt; outraged, and call &quot;he who outraged 'em&quot; to *voice* their outrage, then
an
&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;abuse&quot; has been committed -- and the &quot;abuser&quot; is the reporter who
&gt;&gt;delivered
&gt;&gt;&gt; the *news* to those ten thousand people.

&gt;&gt;&gt; This is insane -- but sadly, common.

&gt;&gt;What's crazy is that you don't see the difference between the judge
telling
&gt;&gt;what the law allows and doesn't allow, and whether or not he likes it.
If a
&gt;&gt;doctor tells you that you have cancer, does that mean that he's happy you
&gt;&gt;have it, or the he deserves it too?

&gt; Well; strangely enough, when I *was* told I had cancer, the diagnosis was
&gt; just as accurate as this judge's diagnosis of what the First Amendment
means.

&gt; My point, which *you* seem oblivious to, is that if the judge says that
such
&gt; and such is legal -- a protected Constitutional right, in fact -- he has
&gt; relinquished the right to object to those who undertake to *exercise* that
&gt; right.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; That is the judge's point it seems to me from a little more
than
&gt; a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; cursory
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; glance at the ruling. It's the FTC, not you, making the choice
on
&gt;&gt; who
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; you
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; can block.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;But all on free-speech grounds. The 1st Amendment is the
&gt;&gt; underpinning
&gt;&gt;&gt; of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the whole case. The FTC should have taken free-speech out of it
&gt; and
&gt;&gt;&gt; made
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;it's case on the basis that consumers have the right, by whatever
&gt;&gt; means
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; they
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;chose, to keep others from using their appliances. If the
consumer
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;voluntarily chooses to let the FTC, or anyone else, decide who
can
&gt;&gt; get
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;through their filter in order to access the bell on the
consumers'
&gt;&gt;&gt; phone,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; no
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;constitutional right has been violated.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The whole lynch-pin of the telemarketers arguments, and of the
&gt; judges
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;decision, is free speech. Take speech out of the equation, and
&gt; their
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; whole
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;case falls apart.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; And by the same token, leave it IN, and *our* whole case (my
server,
&gt;&gt; my
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; rules, etc.) falls apart.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; There is a LOT at stake here.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; No shit.

&gt;&gt;&gt; No, there isn't as it has zero to do with using your property. The use
&gt; of
&gt;&gt;&gt; your property is not covered in the law in any way.

&gt;&gt; Probably only because it wasn't argued.

&gt; You can't just make shit up in a court argument. The law was not written
&gt; about using anyone's property so it's not at issue.

"/> Well, apparently you can. The telemarketers argued free speech when it was

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; But if it isn't, then it's a simple

&gt;&gt; So do you agree that if the rule is changed to include the use of
anothers
&gt;&gt; property (i.e., their phone) as an offense, the law would be fine?

&gt; They would have to break into your house to use your phone. The &quot;use&quot; of

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Fine. Only problem is, it is not you that is suing these people
if
&gt;&gt; they
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; violate
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the law, it is the government. And thus it is not your action
that
&gt; is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; involved,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; it is the government acting to suppress certain types of speech.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; That's no different than the government prosecuting someone for
&gt; trespass
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; even though it was my property upon which they trespassed.

&gt;&gt;&gt; It would be if they only arrested people for knocking on your door to
&gt; sell
&gt;&gt;&gt; you house painting, but if the same person knocked on your door to ask
&gt; you
&gt;&gt;&gt; to buy band candy they wouldn't arrest them.

&gt;&gt; They'd arrest them on the basis that they were trespassing after I
&gt; informed
&gt;&gt; them not to do it. The reason they were there would be irrelevant.

&gt; Stop talking in circles. Your trying to make analogy to trespassing using
&gt; this law. The situation I described is how it would work under this law.

"/> It only seems that I'm talking in circles to someone who lacks the intellect
to understand. Let me go more slowly for you and let's use the situation of
trespass. If someone comes onto my property, I have the right to tell them
to get off and to prosecute those who do not. I can decide this on any
basis I want. If the basis is what they are saying, it doesn't matter.

In your analogy, you set up the case of two different people who trespass
for two different reasons. If I know why someone is going to enter my
property, I have the right to tell them not to do so. They have no right to
enter even though I've already told them not to.

If I know, in advance, why someone is going to call me, and I tell them not
to, they have no right to do so. For instance, if a telemarketer calls, and
I tell them to put me on their do not call list, they must do so or be
subject to fines. The national DNCL just facilitates the process.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Nope. The government is categorizing different types of callers
based
&gt;&gt;&gt; upon
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the content of their speech. I'm accepting their methodology of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; categorization and indicating that I don't want callers of a
&gt; particular
&gt;&gt;&gt; type
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to use my phone, my electricity, and my phone service.

&gt;&gt;&gt; You can accept it, but this judge feels the government doesn't have
the
&gt;&gt;&gt; right to categorize basically identical forms of speech as good and
bad.

&gt;&gt; And he's right. but the government isn't saying that one is good or
bad.
&gt;&gt; They're leaving that to me.

&gt; No, they're not since they won't block all sales calls. They're telling
you
&gt; which you can block with the DNC. You don't have the choice. It's
commercial
&gt; or nothing, even though they admit they're both bad.

"/> They make no value judgement. They classify a caller based upon their
intent. *I* decide that callers fitting that classification are &quot;bad&quot;, not

&gt;&gt;&gt; Yes, but not the government's right.

&gt;Incorrect. The First Amendment prohibits the (U.S.) Government (and by

&gt;It gives them the
&gt;right to speak and to express their opinions. It does not give them the
&gt;right to be
&gt;heard. The recipient of a message has every right to ignore it.

"/> This brings up another related topic: why does the U.S. Postal
Service have any business doing any of the following?

- Delivering mail to &quot;Occupant&quot; when the recipient has requested that
it not be delivered.
- Delivering mail to &quot;Resident&quot; when the recipient has requested that
it not be delivered.
- Delivering bulk-rate mail when the recipient has requested that it
not be delivered.
- Delivering mail with *NO* address on it when the recipient has requested
that it not be delivered.
- Giving my address to ANYONE (especially not Direct Marketing
Association members), even when it is not personally identified
(e.g. Main Street in Spameeville has house numbers 101-139,
102-156, 201-237, 202-214, ... on the odd/even sides of the street)
- Delivering *ANY* mail when the recipient has requested that it
not be delivered. (It is not a good idea to cut off all postal
mail. However, some senior citizens are definitely in danger
trying to receive their mail at a common apartment-house or
neighborhood mailbox, where the local gang members hang around
waiting for people to get their social security checks and get
mugged, when they'd rather get ALL their mail at a post office
box where it's safer to pick it up, even from some stubborn
government agencies that won't take a change of address notice
(such as property-tax offices, voter registration, water/sewer
companies run by the city, etc. Some of these may cooperate.
Some don't.). Even if they can get their social security checks
elsewhere, having to pick up mail *AT ALL* at the apartment house
or neighborhood mailbox puts them in danger. Some of them want
to simply destroy their physical address as a valid mail destination).

- Delivering any mail addressed to &quot;Occupant&quot; whether or not the
recipient has requested that it not be delivered.
- Delivering any mail addressed to &quot;Resident&quot; whether or not the
recipient has requested that it not be delivered.

No, I don't expect the U.S. Postal Service to take a complex filter
list and apply it before delivering mail.

Next up: the FBI announces the National Do-Not-Murder List. With
your help, telemarketers can be made ineligible to join this list.

mode where the phones may function with only telco power. The one
I use at home has both. It still remains, though, that normally
if my phone rings it's MY electricity ringing it.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Fine. Only problem is, it is not you that is suing these people
&gt; if
&gt;&gt;&gt; they
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; violate
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the law, it is the government. And thus it is not your action
&gt; that
&gt;&gt; is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; involved,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; it is the government acting to suppress certain types of speech.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; That's no different than the government prosecuting someone for
&gt;&gt; trespass
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; even though it was my property upon which they trespassed.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It would be if they only arrested people for knocking on your door
to
&gt;&gt; sell
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; you house painting, but if the same person knocked on your door to
ask
&gt;&gt; you
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to buy band candy they wouldn't arrest them.

&gt;&gt;&gt; They'd arrest them on the basis that they were trespassing after I
&gt;&gt; informed
&gt;&gt;&gt; them not to do it. The reason they were there would be irrelevant.

&gt;&gt; Stop talking in circles. Your trying to make analogy to trespassing
using
&gt;&gt; this law. The situation I described is how it would work under this law.

&gt; It only seems that I'm talking in circles to someone who lacks the
intellect
&gt; to understand. Let me go more slowly for you and let's use the situation
of
&gt; trespass. If someone comes onto my property, I have the right to tell
them
&gt; to get off and to prosecute those who do not. I can decide this on any
&gt; basis I want. If the basis is what they are saying, it doesn't matter.

"/> Then you lack the intellect to make the analogy. In the case of this law,
what they're saying does matter.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; In your analogy, you set up the case of two different people who trespass

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; apply to your mail server, but not the telephone company's
lines?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; But I own the phone, the bell in the phone, and the electricity to

&gt;&gt;&gt; it
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; work. Phone lines might not be private property, but when I went
to

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Nope. The government is categorizing different types of callers
&gt; based
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; upon
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the content of their speech. I'm accepting their methodology of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; categorization and indicating that I don't want callers of a

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; type

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You can accept it, but this judge feels the government doesn't have
&gt; the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; right to categorize basically identical forms of speech as good and
&gt; bad.

&gt;&gt;&gt; And he's right. but the government isn't saying that one is good or
&gt; bad.
&gt;&gt;&gt; They're leaving that to me.

&gt;&gt; No, they're not since they won't block all sales calls. They're telling
&gt; you
&gt;&gt; which you can block with the DNC. You don't have the choice. It's
&gt; commercial
&gt;&gt; or nothing, even though they admit they're both bad.

&gt; They make no value judgement. They classify a caller based upon their
&gt; intent. *I* decide that callers fitting that classification are &quot;bad&quot;,
not
&gt; the government.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; them not to do it. The reason they were there would be irrelevant.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Stop talking in circles. Your trying to make analogy to trespassing
&gt; using
&gt;&gt;&gt; this law. The situation I described is how it would work under this
law.

&gt;&gt; It only seems that I'm talking in circles to someone who lacks the
&gt; intellect
&gt;&gt; to understand. Let me go more slowly for you and let's use the
situation
&gt; of
&gt;&gt; trespass. If someone comes onto my property, I have the right to tell
&gt; them
&gt;&gt; to get off and to prosecute those who do not. I can decide this on any
&gt;&gt; basis I want. If the basis is what they are saying, it doesn't matter.

&gt; Then you lack the intellect to make the analogy. In the case of this law,
&gt; what they're saying does matter.

"/> What law? The law that the newest decision created? If so, then what's the
sense of debating how the decision was argued and made if all your gonna do
is accept it as a basis for the debate? And if not, then let's debate. If
there's any lack of intellect here, it's your ability to understand this
pretty simple concept.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; In your analogy, you set up the case of two different people who
trespass
&gt;&gt; for two different reasons.

&gt; Because that's how this law works with your analogy. You want to talk
about
&gt; real trespass, please start a new thread instead of diverting this one.

"/> Ahhhhh, the sure sign of someone on the losing side of a debate; selective
snipping. You think if you snip the context of what I post and parse what I
say all out of context that you'll have a winning argument. Why not just
concede gracefully.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; apply to your mail server, but not the telephone company's

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; But I own the phone, the bell in the phone, and the electricity
to
&gt;&gt;&gt; make
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; it
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; work. Phone lines might not be private property, but when I
went
&gt; to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Wall-Mart and bought my phone, it became *my* phone.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; And nobody but you is using your phone. As for the electicity,
&gt; unless
&gt;&gt;&gt; you
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; have some strange phone company, you could turn off all your
&gt; breakers
&gt;&gt;&gt; and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; your phone would still ring. You don't pay for the electricity.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; When the telemarketer rang my phone, he used my phone. and I most
&gt;&gt;&gt; certainly
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; paid for the electricity. It's not furnished for free.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Telephones don't need any electricity from your house. They work just
&gt; fine
&gt;&gt;&gt; in a blackout.
&gt;&gt;&gt; The phone company rang your phone, not the telemarketer, unless maybe
he
&gt;&gt; hit
&gt;&gt;&gt; the bell with a hammer.

&gt;&gt; A) I paid the phone company for the service, including the electricity,
&gt; and

&gt; You paid for phone service.

"/> Which includes the electricity. If the phone company doesn't provide it,
I'd have to and my point would be the same. Why not just acknowledge this

&gt;&gt; for the service that required them to. But because I paid for the
&gt; service,

&gt; They used their service. Don't like it? Write your congressman or the FTC
&gt; and ask them to rewrite the law. Or, go sue the next person who calls you
&gt; for tresspass because they used your phone. Be sure to bring your straight

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Nope. The government is categorizing different types of callers
&gt;&gt; based
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; upon
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the content of their speech. I'm accepting their methodology of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; categorization and indicating that I don't want callers of a
&gt;&gt;&gt; particular
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; type
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to use my phone, my electricity, and my phone service.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You can accept it, but this judge feels the government doesn't
have
&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; right to categorize basically identical forms of speech as good
and
&gt;&gt; bad.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; And he's right. but the government isn't saying that one is good or
&gt;&gt; bad.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; They're leaving that to me.

&gt;&gt;&gt; No, they're not since they won't block all sales calls. They're
telling
&gt;&gt; you
&gt;&gt;&gt; which you can block with the DNC. You don't have the choice. It's
&gt;&gt; commercial
&gt;&gt;&gt; or nothing, even though they admit they're both bad.

&gt;&gt; They make no value judgement. They classify a caller based upon their
&gt;&gt; intent. *I* decide that callers fitting that classification are &quot;bad&quot;,
&gt; not
&gt;&gt; the government.

&gt; Really? Suppose you classify charity callers as bad. What then?

"/> Then I get pissed when they call. Just because the government doesn't
supply all the options I'd like to see doesn't change the fact that you're
wrong when you say I didn't have a choice on whether or not it was me who
decided that commercial telemarketers were *bad*.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Also, I'm the one with the choice. I have a choice to ban
&gt;&gt; callers fitting that classification or not.

&gt; You can only ban the classification the government lets you. You don't
have
&gt; any choice.

"/> Sure I do. I can ban callers in that classification or not. See? A
choice. I don't have some other choices, but that doesn't mean I didn't
have this choice. You really don't get the whole concept of choice do you?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; call selling you school band candy is allowed, but the call from
&gt;&gt; Hershey
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; sell you candy isn't allowed.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; By me, that's right.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Fine, but by me it's not.

&gt;&gt; Then don't sign up. No one required you to. Now you can get all the
&gt; calls
&gt;&gt; you want, and so can I.

&gt; I don't want any telemarketing calls.

"/> Then don't pay for phone service. but at least limiting some callers is
better than letting a whole bunch through just because some others will
sneak by.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt; No, they never gave you that choice. They made the choice for you and
&gt; said
&gt;&gt;&gt; here, take it or leave it.

&gt;&gt; You begin by saying that they never gave me a choice, and then go on to
&gt;&gt; describe the choice they gave me.

&gt; I just said they don't give you a choice as to what kind of calls to ban.

"/> Sure they do. They give a choice as to whether or not to ban commercial
telemarketers.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; They gave me one more choice than I now
&gt;&gt; have. If it's not good enough, I don't have to sign up. But before the
&gt;&gt; DNCL, I truly had no choice. At least with the DNCL, I have one.

&gt; Yeah, the choice Big Brother lets you make. Are you people or sheeple?

"/> Are you people stupid? Big Brother didn't decide anything for me. They
simply provided me with a classification which I'm free to accept or not.
The fact that this choice sits out there for me doesn't mean that I have to
avail myself of it. The courts' decision denied me that choice.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Except this law, as much as you would like it to be, is not about

&gt;&gt;&gt; No, go read the law.

&gt;&gt; It's the application of the law and how the new law fits to it that
we're
&gt;&gt; debating. Do you understand this concept?

&gt; I do, do you? You keep saying it's about people using your stuff. Please
&gt; show me where that is covered in this law?

"/> I've said from the very beginning that if it's not implicit in the current
rule, then let's make it so and resubmit. Now answer my question. If the

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Wall-Mart and bought my phone, it became *my* phone.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; And nobody but you is using your phone. As for the electicity,
&gt;&gt; unless
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; you
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; have some strange phone company, you could turn off all your
&gt;&gt; breakers
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; your phone would still ring. You don't pay for the electricity.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; When the telemarketer rang my phone, he used my phone. and I most
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; certainly
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; paid for the electricity. It's not furnished for free.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Telephones don't need any electricity from your house. They work
just
&gt;&gt; fine
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in a blackout.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The phone company rang your phone, not the telemarketer, unless
maybe
&gt; he
&gt;&gt;&gt; hit
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the bell with a hammer.

&gt;&gt;&gt; A) I paid the phone company for the service, including the
electricity,
&gt;&gt; and

&gt;&gt; You paid for phone service.

&gt; Which includes the electricity. If the phone company doesn't provide it,
&gt; I'd have to and my point would be the same. Why not just acknowledge this
&gt; point? You're really looking silly now.

&gt;&gt;&gt; B) the phone company no more rang the phone than I did. Besides, you
&gt;&gt; can't
&gt;&gt;&gt; have it both ways. If the phone company rang my phone, it's because I
&gt;&gt; paid
&gt;&gt;&gt; for the service that required them to. But because I paid for the
&gt;&gt; service,
&gt;&gt;&gt; the telemarketer used that service over my objection. Pick your
poison.

&gt;&gt; They used their service. Don't like it? Write your congressman or the
FTC
&gt;&gt; and ask them to rewrite the law. Or, go sue the next person who calls
you
&gt;&gt; for tresspass because they used your phone. Be sure to bring your
straight
&gt;&gt; jacket measurements to court.

&gt; Is that your response to debate? Write your congressman if I don't agree
&gt; with you? You're stuck with a losing argument, or lack the intellect to
&gt; make it effectively, and that's where you end? And you say that I lack
&gt; intellect?

"/> You don't, because all of your arguments have nothing to do with the content
of the DNC law or the court ruling.

&gt;&gt;&gt; That depends on your phone setup. My ISDN line *DOES* need power

&gt;&gt;&gt; Small office phone systems need local power to function, although
&gt;&gt;&gt; they may (a) have battery backup, and (b) have some kind of fallback
&gt;&gt;&gt; mode where the phones may function with only telco power. The one
&gt;&gt;&gt; I use at home has both. It still remains, though, that normally
&gt;&gt;&gt; if my phone rings it's MY electricity ringing it.

&gt;&gt; It's still to insignificant for the government to be concerned with and
&gt;&gt; there is no law that addresses it.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; And you think the Telco provides that ringing signal (and
voltage)
&gt;&gt; for
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; free?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Not around Oregon, they don't!

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; And where on your electric bill does it show up? I've never seen
any
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; connection from the home 110v to the telco.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Who says it has to be itemized?

&gt;&gt;&gt; It wouldn't matter. Your electricity doesn't feed the phone, or at
least
&gt;&gt;&gt; doesn't need to with a standard phone. The telco provides the ringer
&gt;&gt;&gt; voltage, not the electric company from your household current. Your
&gt; phone
&gt;&gt;&gt; can ring with your home electricity turned off.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Where I used to work we had relays set up in case of a power failure
so
&gt;&gt;&gt; bells powered by the telco would ring if the PBX lost power.

&gt;&gt; First you make the case as a key point of your argument, then when faced
&gt;&gt; with the silliness of it, you say it doesn't matter. If it didn't
matter,
&gt;&gt; then don't state it in order to obfuscate the discussion. Moreover, the
&gt;&gt; argument you're now trying to make is that I somehow have a
responsibility
&gt;&gt; to share my electricity with others if I choose to buy a phone that uses
&gt;&gt; house current. And you say I lack intellect? It's still my
electricity,
&gt;&gt; whether it comes from the phone company, or from my household current.
&gt; And
&gt;&gt; it's still my phone and my bell. Stop the insanity and retreat with
&gt; dignity
&gt;&gt; while you can still salvage some.

&gt; Why do you keep arguing about the use of your phone which has nothing to
do
&gt; with the DNC list?

"/> We've been there already. My whole premise is that the government should
have made the argument that the DNCL rule is to protect against the
unwarranted use of the phone, not to quell speech. We can debate that, or
we can simply say &quot;it's the law&quot;. You choose.

So now answer the question. You've tried to make the case that the
government needs to have a significant interest in a situation in order to

trespasses on my property? Why have you never answered that one?

example and points out to you that if trespass laws were designed the same
way as the DNC list, then people from charities would be allowed to trespass
because the DNC list gives those trespassers special privileges, you simply
change from it being an analogy to saying nobody can trespass. Which is why
your analogy is useless.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; mode where the phones may function with only telco power. The one

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; if my phone rings it's MY electricity ringing it.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It's still to insignificant for the government to be concerned with
&gt; and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; there is no law that addresses it.

&gt;&gt;&gt; What's the significance of trespass?

&gt;&gt; Phone calls are not trespass. Think they are? Call the police when
someone
&gt;&gt; calls you.

&gt; I've explained to you on numerous occasions that I'm not making the case
&gt; that it is, but rather using it as an analogy. for you to constantly
&gt; suggest that I have either means that you're stupid or that you're just
&gt; playing games to mask a losing position. Take your choice.

&gt; So now answer the question. You've tried to make the case that the
&gt; government needs to have a significant interest in a situation in order to
&gt; get involved. Well? What's the significant government interest if
someone
&gt; trespasses on my property? Why have you never answered that one?

"/> Because the answer is obvious if you look up trespass laws. There are laws
against trespass. The government decided that a long time ago. But I still
have no idea why you keep wanting to discuss trespass since it's irrelevant
to the DNC list.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Then why do you keep trying to divert this to discussion about
trespass
&gt; if
&gt;&gt;&gt; trespass has nothing to do with the DNC list?

&gt;&gt; It was an a-n-a-l-o-g-y. How else do your want me to say it? I can
keep
&gt;&gt; someone from entering my property regardless of the reasons. It might
be
&gt;&gt; because of what they want to say, but that doesn't give them 1st
amendment
&gt;&gt; protection to enter my property. Same with calling my phone. It's *my*
&gt;&gt; phone and it doesn't matter what they want to say. I can't keep them
from
&gt;&gt; saying it, but I can keep them from using my phone to say it. IOW, in
&gt; both
&gt;&gt; cases, free speech isn't the basis for the offense.

&gt; Yes, and do you know how to follow an analogy? If so, you would realize
how
&gt; faulty your analogy is. But when someone follows your analogy using the
DNC
&gt; example and points out to you that if trespass laws were designed the same
&gt; way as the DNC list, then people from charities would be allowed to
trespass
&gt; because the DNC list gives those trespassers special privileges, you
simply
&gt; change from it being an analogy to saying nobody can trespass. Which is
why
&gt; your analogy is useless.

"/> Right. If trespass laws were designed like the DNCL was decided so far by
the courts, I wouldn't have any choice but to allow charities on my
property. Thanks for making my point. Now all you have to do is reverse it
because we're not debating how the trespass laws were decided, but how the
DNCL was. If you use the trespass model as a valid basis to view the DNCL,
which, after all, is the one we're debating, then the inconsistency which
you now admit exists points to the fact that the DNCL is faulty, not the
trespass laws.

My reason for not letting someone use my stuff doesn't matter. It's my
stuff and I have the right to control who uses it.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Telephones don't need any electricity from your house. They
work

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; fine
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;in a blackout.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; That depends on your phone setup. My ISDN line *DOES* need
power

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Small office phone systems need local power to function,
although

&gt;&gt;&gt; you're right, then you must be able to describe the governments'
&gt;&gt; significant
&gt;&gt;&gt; interest in trespass. Why don't you answer that one? It's the
&gt;&gt; underpinning
&gt;&gt;&gt; of your argument.

&gt;&gt; I have answered that. The &quot;use&quot; of your phone, as you seem to think
others
&gt;&gt; calling you are using your phone and their phone at the same time, is
what
&gt;&gt; the law refers to as de minimus use. The use is so insignificant as to
not
&gt;&gt; be important. If you think there should be a law against someone &quot;using&quot;
&gt;&gt; your phone by calling you, I suggest you try to get one enacted as there
&gt; is
&gt;&gt; no such law now.

&gt; Try again. Why is someone trespassing on my property so significant that
&gt; the government has a role? It's your assertion, you should be able to
&gt; defend it.

"/> No, using your phone is not trespassing. They are two different things. Quit
talking about trespassing when you mean phone calls. If you insist that a
phone call = trespass, please say so. Then I can just add you to the kook
filter.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; get involved. Well? What's the significant government interest
&gt; if
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; someone
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; trespasses on my property? Why have you never answered that
one?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Because the answer is obvious if you look up trespass laws. There
&gt; are
&gt;&gt;&gt; laws
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; against trespass. The government decided that a long time ago. But
I
&gt;&gt;&gt; still
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; have no idea why you keep wanting to discuss trespass since it's
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; irrelevant
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to the DNC list.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Because you're not that smart. But you've still avoided the
question.
&gt;&gt;&gt; You
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; keep making the case that the government must have a significant
&gt;&gt; interest
&gt;&gt;&gt; in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a law. That's why you say that the government would never enact a
law
&gt;&gt;&gt; which
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; prevents others from using my phone. So I'm challenging your
&gt; assertion.
&gt;&gt;&gt; If
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; you're right, then you must be able to describe the governments'
&gt;&gt;&gt; significant
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; interest in trespass. Why don't you answer that one? It's the

&gt;&gt; Try again. Why is someone trespassing on my property so significant
that
&gt;&gt; the government has a role? It's your assertion, you should be able to

&gt; No, using your phone is not trespassing. They are two different things.
Quit

"/> I don't know how many more ways to tell you that trespassing is just an
analogy. but you seem to resort to this brain lock whenever I ask you to
defend your position. You've made the statement over and over again that
the government needs an to have a significant interest in a situation in
order to get involved. If that were universally true, you'd be able to
explain what the significant government interest is if someone trespasses on
my property. I'm not saying that trespass has any relevance to the DNCL.
It only has relevance to your assertion to the sign interest issue.

So why can't you answer the question?

Look, it's pretty clear that you've boxed yourself into a corner here and
that you don't know how to get out. Just be an adult about it and address
it head on. You've tried to poke a hole in my argument that the government
could or should protect the use of my stuff by asserting that the government
must have a significant interest in order to do so. Well, if that were true
WRT my stuff, why isn't it true WRT my trespassing on my property? Forget
the DNCL for the moment and let's just focus on your assertion regarding
significant interest. Why can't you explain where the significant interest
is WRT trespass? If you're convinced you're right, why do you avoid
answering the question?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

the DNCL.

Tell you what; forget the DNCL for now. Based upon your assertion as I've
described above, just answer the question. Why are you so afraid to do so?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; get involved. Well? What's the significant government
&gt; interest
&gt;&gt;&gt; if
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; someone
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; trespasses on my property? Why have you never answered that
&gt;&gt; one?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Because the answer is obvious if you look up trespass laws.
&gt; There
&gt;&gt;&gt; are
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; laws
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; against trespass. The government decided that a long time ago.
&gt; But
&gt;&gt; I
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; still
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; have no idea why you keep wanting to discuss trespass since
it's
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; irrelevant
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to the DNC list.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Because you're not that smart. But you've still avoided the
&gt;&gt; question.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; keep making the case that the government must have a significant
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; interest
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a law. That's why you say that the government would never enact
a
&gt;&gt; law
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; which
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; prevents others from using my phone. So I'm challenging your
&gt;&gt;&gt; assertion.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; you're right, then you must be able to describe the governments'
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; significant
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; interest in trespass. Why don't you answer that one? It's the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; underpinning
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of your argument.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I have answered that. The &quot;use&quot; of your phone, as you seem to
think
&gt;&gt;&gt; others
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; calling you are using your phone and their phone at the same time,
&gt; is
&gt;&gt;&gt; what
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the law refers to as de minimus use. The use is so insignificant
as
&gt; to
&gt;&gt;&gt; not
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; be important. If you think there should be a law against someone
&gt;&gt;&quot;using&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; your phone by calling you, I suggest you try to get one enacted as
&gt;&gt; there
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; no such law now.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Try again. Why is someone trespassing on my property so significant
&gt;&gt; that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the government has a role? It's your assertion, you should be able
to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; defend it.

&gt;&gt;&gt; No, using your phone is not trespassing. They are two different
things.
&gt;&gt; Quit
&gt;&gt;&gt; talking about trespassing when you mean phone calls. If you insist
that
&gt; a
&gt;&gt;&gt; phone call = trespass, please say so. Then I can just add you to the
&gt; kook
&gt;&gt;&gt; filter.

&gt;&gt; I don't know how many more ways to tell you that trespassing is just an
&gt;&gt; analogy. but you seem to resort to this brain lock whenever I ask you
to
&gt;&gt; defend your position.

&gt; Because everytime I do, you insist on your whacky assertion that anyone
&gt; calling you is using your phone and then you say, &quot; I have the right to
&gt; control who uses it.&quot; So there is nothing to defend since nobody is using
&gt; your phone and nobody is trespassing.

"/> More slip and slide and the rediculous combining or statements to create a
smoke screen. Defend your position. That's all I ask.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; You've made the statement over and over again that
&gt;&gt; the government needs an to have a significant interest in a situation in
&gt;&gt; order to get involved. If that were universally true, you'd be able to
&gt;&gt; explain what the significant government interest is if someone
trespasses
&gt; on
&gt;&gt; my property.

&gt; The government has decided there is an interest in preserving private
&gt; property rights. Therefore they prohibit trespassing. Happy?

"/> Finally! Whew. I can't belive it took that long to pin you down. you've
obviously back off your notion that there had to be some finacial interest,
so let's remember that.

Now that we've established that there can be some basis, other than finacial
loss, for the government to decide that they have an interest, it's
perfectly logical that the government could decide that they have a
significant interest in who uses the belongings of others. Specifically,
they could decide that they have an interst in who uses my phone, my
electricity, and my phone service.

If they do that (which I maintain is implicit in many different places in
the law such as theft of services, etc.), let's say in the DNCL, then
someone who uses my stuff but who's been told not to would be violating the
law. See? Free speech is not the issue.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; I'm not saying that trespass has any relevance to the DNCL.
&gt;&gt; It only has relevance to your assertion to the sign interest issue.

&gt; Sign interest issue?

"/> Moron.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; So why can't you answer the question?

&gt;&gt; Look, it's pretty clear that you've boxed yourself into a corner here
and
&gt;&gt; that you don't know how to get out. Just be an adult about it and
address
&gt;&gt; it head on. You've tried to poke a hole in my argument that the
&gt; government
&gt;&gt; could or should protect the use of my stuff by asserting that the
&gt; government
&gt;&gt; must have a significant interest in order to do so. Well, if that were
&gt; true
&gt;&gt; WRT my stuff, why isn't it true WRT my trespassing on my property?

&gt; Because when someone calls you they're not using your stuff. If you think
&gt; they are, call the police and have them arrested for trespass to chattles.

"/> Technically I could. As a practical matter, the police won't enforce it for
many reasons. First of all, by allowing my number to be published or
otherwise circulated, I've implicitly invited them to call me. Second, I'd
have to prove that I've specifically notified them not to call. Then
there's the whole issue of jurisdiction. My home town cop isn't gonna press
charges against someone in another state.

That's why the feds need to get involved. The DNCL serves as prior
notification to the telemarketers that I don't want them calling me. It
also provides a mechanism to establish that the unauthorized use of my
phone, etc, is an offense which the Feds can prosecute. And keep in mind, I
wouldn't notify them not to call because of what they might say, but because
of who they are.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Forget
&gt;&gt; the DNCL for the moment and let's just focus on your assertion regarding
&gt;&gt; significant interest. Why can't you explain where the significant
&gt; interest
&gt;&gt; is WRT trespass?

&gt; See above. Or google for private property. It's pretty obvious that if the
&gt; government didn't enforce trespass laws there would be anarchy with people
&gt; wandering into other people's homes.

"/> and indiscriminately disturbing people at all hours of the day or night thus
making their lives miserable.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Your assertion was that the government had to have a significant
&gt;&gt; interest
&gt;&gt;&gt; in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; getting involved. I'm simply asking you to demonstate that if this
is
&gt;&gt; so
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; universal as to be applied to the DNCL, you should be able to
&gt;&gt; demonstrate
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the application of this principle in other situations (i.e.,
&gt; trespass).
&gt;&gt;&gt; Can
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; you or can you not?

&gt;&gt;&gt; What principle? The DNCL is based on your established right to
privacy.
&gt; It
&gt;&gt;&gt; is not based on any trespassing laws.

&gt;&gt; More obfuscation. You've asserted a principle that the government needs
a
&gt;&gt; significant interest to get involved. Where's the significance in the
&gt; case
&gt;&gt; of trespass? It's really just that simple.

&gt; Only an idiot couldn't see the harm to soceity if anyone could enter your
&gt; home without permission.

"/> Then why'd you have such a hard time answering the question? It was pretty
simple.

And only a moron can't see the harm in having telemarketers ruin the peace,
quiet, and solace of the home. IOW, your argument that the government has
no compelling interest in keeping telemarketers from calling the house is
just *your* opinion. If the public decides that it is significant, then it
is.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; I don't know why asking this
&gt;&gt; question leads you to believe that I'm saying that trespass is relevant
to
&gt;&gt; the DNCL.

&gt; Because you keep trying to equate a phone call to someone &quot;using my stuff&quot;
&gt; as you put it.

"/> so where did I say that ever lead to trespass?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;So let's say someone intruded on my property after I've told them not
to,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;and the reason was because I didn't liked what they were saying. If I
&gt;&gt;press
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;charges, the government would prosecute them for trespass. If the

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;because the underlying reason for my actions was their speech, they'd
&gt;&gt;lose.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Trespass was the offense, not the speech.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Then why do you keep trying to divert this to discussion about
trespass
&gt;&gt;if
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; trespass has nothing to do with the DNC list?

&gt;&gt;&gt; It was an a-n-a-l-o-g-y. How else do your want me to say it? I can
keep
&gt;&gt;&gt; someone from entering my property regardless of the reasons. It might
be
&gt;&gt;&gt; because of what they want to say, but that doesn't give them 1st
amendment
&gt;&gt;&gt; protection to enter my property. Same with calling my phone. It's
*my*
&gt;&gt;&gt; phone and it doesn't matter what they want to say. I can't keep them
from
&gt;&gt;&gt; saying it, but I can keep them from using my phone to say it. IOW, in
&gt;&gt;both
&gt;&gt;&gt; cases, free speech isn't the basis for the offense.

&gt;&gt;Yes, and do you know how to follow an analogy? If so, you would realize
how
&gt;&gt;faulty your analogy is. But when someone follows your analogy using the
DNC
&gt;&gt;example and points out to you that if trespass laws were designed the
same
&gt;&gt;way as the DNC list, then people from charities would be allowed to
trespass
&gt;&gt;because the DNC list gives those trespassers special privileges, you
simply
&gt;&gt;change from it being an analogy to saying nobody can trespass. Which is
why
&gt;&gt;your analogy is useless.

&gt; No, his analogy is fine. It's the telemarketslime *law* that's useless,
&gt; because it forces private citizens attempting to quietly enjoy the
sanctity
&gt; of their own homes the same restrictions placed upon proprietors of public
&gt; accomodations.

"/> No, the DNCL rule is trying to do exactly the opposite.

&gt;&gt;trespass
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;if
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; trespass has nothing to do with the DNC list?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It was an a-n-a-l-o-g-y. How else do your want me to say it? I can
&gt;&gt;keep
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; someone from entering my property regardless of the reasons. It
might
&gt;&gt;be
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; because of what they want to say, but that doesn't give them 1st
&gt;&gt;amendment
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; protection to enter my property. Same with calling my phone. It's
&gt;&gt;*my*
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; phone and it doesn't matter what they want to say. I can't keep
them
&gt;&gt;from
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; saying it, but I can keep them from using my phone to say it. IOW,
in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;both
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; cases, free speech isn't the basis for the offense.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Yes, and do you know how to follow an analogy? If so, you would
realize
&gt;&gt;how
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;faulty your analogy is. But when someone follows your analogy using
the
&gt;&gt;DNC
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;example and points out to you that if trespass laws were designed the
&gt;&gt;same
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;way as the DNC list, then people from charities would be allowed to
&gt;&gt;trespass
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;because the DNC list gives those trespassers special privileges, you
&gt;&gt;simply
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;change from it being an analogy to saying nobody can trespass. Which
is
&gt;&gt;why
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;your analogy is useless.

&gt;&gt;&gt; No, his analogy is fine. It's the telemarketslime *law* that's
useless,
&gt;&gt;&gt; because it forces private citizens attempting to quietly enjoy the
&gt;&gt;sanctity
&gt;&gt;&gt; of their own homes the same restrictions placed upon proprietors of
public
&gt;&gt;&gt; accomodations.

&gt;&gt;No, the DNCL rule is trying to do exactly the opposite.

&gt; No, it says I have to allow charities, politicians, etc. -- basically
&gt; *everyone* other than for-profit outfits -- to use my property.

"/> No, that's what the judge said

it's a hollow victory. Most people will never do what you do so the wasted
investment on their part is minimal and doesn't put a dent in their bottom
line. You might have affected the commissions of one sales person, but
there are twenty more where he/she came from just waiting to fill the void
if they quit in frustration.

Essentially, you're shoveling sand against the tide in trying to prove a
point to the ocean. Face it, until they're stopped from calling in the
first place, they win and you lose. That 20 minutes was meaningless to
them. Was it to you?

"/> Right. But any discussion of the *here and now* worth having includes the
possibilities of what could be. Besides, The *here and now* is that the
decision is under appeal and therefore imminently subject to change. The
*here and now* also includes the predisposition of Congress to fix the law
and make it workable. The *here and now* is also the view of whether or not
any judicial decision was rightly made in order to affect public opinion and
therefore the course of this society.

If facts are facts and the only thing you can do is bitch about the ones you
don't like, have a ball. But if you want to discuss whether or not facts
can be changed, and if so how so, then join the club.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Telephones don't need any electricity from your house. They work
&gt;&gt; just
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; fine
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;in a blackout.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; That depends on your phone setup. My ISDN line *DOES* need power
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to the terminal adapter, or it doesn't work (for voice OR data).

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Small office phone systems need local power to function, although
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; they may (a) have battery backup, and (b) have some kind of
&gt; fallback
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; mode where the phones may function with only telco power. The one
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I use at home has both. It still remains, though, that normally
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; if my phone rings it's MY electricity ringing it.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It's still to insignificant for the government to be concerned with
&gt;&gt; and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; there is no law that addresses it.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; What's the significance of trespass?

&gt;&gt;&gt; Phone calls are not trespass. Think they are? Call the police when
&gt; someone
&gt;&gt;&gt; calls you.

&gt;&gt; I've explained to you on numerous occasions that I'm not making the case
&gt;&gt; that it is, but rather using it as an analogy. for you to constantly
&gt;&gt; suggest that I have either means that you're stupid or that you're just
&gt;&gt; playing games to mask a losing position. Take your choice.

&gt;&gt; So now answer the question. You've tried to make the case that the
&gt;&gt; government needs to have a significant interest in a situation in order to
&gt;&gt; get involved. Well? What's the significant government interest if
&gt; someone
&gt;&gt; trespasses on my property? Why have you never answered that one?

&gt; Because the answer is obvious if you look up trespass laws. There are laws
&gt; against trespass. The government decided that a long time ago. But I still
&gt; have no idea why you keep wanting to discuss trespass since it's irrelevant
&gt; to the DNC list.

"/> Actually, I disagree. There is no reason why calls made after
you've informed the company (not the telemarketer, the company
that they represent) that you don't want their calls could
NOT be declared trespass. Congress can define things any way
they want to. They didn't, but they COULD.

They (or the FCC, by regulation) could establish the Do-Not-Call
list as appropriate notice that you don't want the company to call you.

(Hint to all you Congresspersons out there.)

The only problem with that approach is that trespass is not
normally a Federal crime.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Telephones don't need any electricity from your house. They
work
&gt;&gt;&gt; just
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; fine
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;in a blackout.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; That depends on your phone setup. My ISDN line *DOES* need
power
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to the terminal adapter, or it doesn't work (for voice OR
data).

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Small office phone systems need local power to function,
although
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; they may (a) have battery backup, and (b) have some kind of
&gt;&gt; fallback
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; mode where the phones may function with only telco power. The
one
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I use at home has both. It still remains, though, that
normally
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; if my phone rings it's MY electricity ringing it.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It's still to insignificant for the government to be concerned
with
&gt;&gt;&gt; and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; there is no law that addresses it.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; What's the significance of trespass?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Phone calls are not trespass. Think they are? Call the police when
&gt;&gt; someone
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; calls you.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I've explained to you on numerous occasions that I'm not making the
case
&gt;&gt;&gt; that it is, but rather using it as an analogy. for you to constantly
&gt;&gt;&gt; suggest that I have either means that you're stupid or that you're
just
&gt;&gt;&gt; playing games to mask a losing position. Take your choice.

&gt;&gt;&gt; So now answer the question. You've tried to make the case that the
&gt;&gt;&gt; government needs to have a significant interest in a situation in
order to
&gt;&gt;&gt; get involved. Well? What's the significant government interest if
&gt;&gt; someone
&gt;&gt;&gt; trespasses on my property? Why have you never answered that one?

&gt;&gt; Because the answer is obvious if you look up trespass laws. There are
laws
&gt;&gt; against trespass. The government decided that a long time ago. But I
still
&gt;&gt; have no idea why you keep wanting to discuss trespass since it's
irrelevant
&gt;&gt; to the DNC list.

&gt; Actually, I disagree. There is no reason why calls made after
&gt; you've informed the company (not the telemarketer, the company
&gt; that they represent) that you don't want their calls could
&gt; NOT be declared trespass. Congress can define things any way
&gt; they want to. They didn't, but they COULD.

&gt; They (or the FCC, by regulation) could establish the Do-Not-Call
&gt; list as appropriate notice that you don't want the company to call you.

&gt; (Hint to all you Congresspersons out there.)

&gt; The only problem with that approach is that trespass is not
&gt; normally a Federal crime.

"/> I basically agree with everything you've said. Well done.

&quot;We conclude there is a substantial likelihood that the FTC will be able to

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Nope. The government is categorizing different types of callers
&gt;&gt; based
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; upon
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the content of their speech. I'm accepting their methodology of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; categorization and indicating that I don't want callers of a
&gt;&gt;&gt; particular
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; type
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to use my phone, my electricity, and my phone service.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You can accept it, but this judge feels the government doesn't
have
&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; right to categorize basically identical forms of speech as good
and
&gt;&gt; bad.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; And he's right. but the government isn't saying that one is good or
&gt;&gt; bad.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; They're leaving that to me.

&gt;&gt;&gt; No, they're not since they won't block all sales calls. They're
telling
&gt;&gt; you
&gt;&gt;&gt; which you can block with the DNC. You don't have the choice. It's
&gt;&gt; commercial
&gt;&gt;&gt; or nothing, even though they admit they're both bad.

&gt;&gt; They make no value judgement. They classify a caller based upon their
&gt;&gt; intent. *I* decide that callers fitting that classification are &quot;bad&quot;,
&gt; not
&gt;&gt; the government.

&gt; Really? Suppose you classify charity callers as bad. What then?

&gt;&gt; Also, I'm the one with the choice. I have a choice to ban
&gt;&gt; callers fitting that classification or not.

&gt; You can only ban the classification the government lets you. You don't
have
&gt; any choice.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; call selling you school band candy is allowed, but the call from
&gt;&gt; Hershey
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; sell you candy isn't allowed.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; By me, that's right.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Fine, but by me it's not.

&gt;&gt; Then don't sign up. No one required you to. Now you can get all the
&gt; calls
&gt;&gt; you want, and so can I.

&gt; I don't want any telemarketing calls.

&gt;&gt;&gt; No, they never gave you that choice. They made the choice for you and
&gt; said
&gt;&gt;&gt; here, take it or leave it.

&gt;&gt; You begin by saying that they never gave me a choice, and then go on to
&gt;&gt; describe the choice they gave me.

&gt; I just said they don't give you a choice as to what kind of calls to ban.

&gt;&gt; They gave me one more choice than I now
&gt;&gt; have. If it's not good enough, I don't have to sign up. But before the
&gt;&gt; DNCL, I truly had no choice. At least with the DNCL, I have one.

&gt; Yeah, the choice Big Brother lets you make. Are you people or sheeple?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Except this law, as much as you would like it to be, is not about
&gt;&gt; anyone
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; using your stuff.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; That's the whole point of the debate. It *is* about using my stuff.

&gt;&gt;&gt; No, go read the law.

&gt;&gt; It's the application of the law and how the new law fits to it that
we're
&gt;&gt; debating. Do you understand this concept?

&gt; I do, do you? You keep saying it's about people using your stuff. Please
&gt; show me where that is covered in this law?

&gt;&gt; Beyond that, if the question is looked at on a first amendment basis,
the
&gt;&gt; telemarketers are probably right. The government cannot silence people
from
&gt;&gt; saying what they want as long as what they say is not wildly
unreasonable.
&gt;&gt; However, the issue that the judge, and the FTC missed, is that there is
no
&gt;&gt; constitutional freedom to use an appliance that belongs to someone else,
nor
&gt;&gt; the services they pay for.

&gt; If you take that argument it's easy enough to ban someone from using the
mails
&gt; to send out advertising literature, since you pay for the mailbox your
mail
&gt; comes through.

&gt;&gt; IOW, no one has the constitutional right to make the bell on my phone
ring,
&gt;&gt; nor to use the electricity I pay for to make it ring, nor use the
service I
&gt;&gt; pay for to get through to me.

&gt; The phone company pays for the electric current used to make the phone
ring.
&gt; You may have one of those phones that is a portable or other type that
doesn't
&gt; rely on current from the phone company to make it ring but the signal to
do so
&gt; (and the electric current to make it happen) is sent by the telephone
company.
&gt; Your phone line when on or off hook is, I believe, about 12 volts DC or
less.
&gt; When it rings the current jumps to 48 volts DC. That you choose to use a
phone
&gt; that requires additional electricity above and beyond what the phone
company
&gt; provides is not relevant.

&gt;&gt; The telemarketer can say whatever they want,
&gt;&gt; but I have no obligation to furnish the means by which they get me to
listen.

&gt; No, but should someone's ability to communicate to others be dependent
upon
&gt; whether the content of the material is commercial in nature? If we go
that
&gt; route we might argue that they can pass a law that allows people to
restrict
&gt; certain types of callers based on the content of their message, so that
people
&gt; calling about, say, supporting the death penalty can be prohibited from
calling
&gt; people who signed up on the &quot;oppose the death penalty register&quot; and those
who
&gt; don't want calls in favor of gun control can prevent anyone presenting a
message
&gt; supporting a handgun ban by having a list for that purpose.

&gt; Why is it that someone presenting a message to save the whales has a
greater
&gt; protection for his speech than someone presenting a message to save at
First
&gt; National Bank?

&gt;&gt; That should have been the governments case. They should have stipulated
as
&gt;&gt; to the free speech issue.

&gt; If you stipulate that the restriction violates free speech you're
stipulating
&gt; that the do-not-call list is unconstitutional.

&gt; --
&gt; Paul Robinson &quot;Above all else... We shall go on...&quot;

&gt; that nobody learns the lessons that history teaches us.&quot;
