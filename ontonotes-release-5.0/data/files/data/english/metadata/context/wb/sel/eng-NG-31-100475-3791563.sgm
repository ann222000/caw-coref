Target: Left Lane Hogs - Finally!
by Eric Peters

Some good news: Left lane hogs are finally getting the attention they
deserve from traffic cops -- and traffic laws.

In at least two states -- Colorado and Florida -- cops are begiining to
target drivers who squat in the far left lane and refuse to move right
to let faster-moving traffic get by. For decades, these drivers have
been allowed to create rolling roadblocks and interrupt the smooth (and
therfore safe) flow of traffic with virtual impunity because "faiure to
yield" laws were either not on the books -- or not enforced. And
twenty-plus years of ddumbed-down, politicized "driver's education" and
"safety" campaigns had effectively propagandized the populace into
believing their was only one cardinal sin -- "speeding."

And so the focus of traffic "safety" enforcement was speed limit laws
-- which of course were often ridiculous (the best example being the
55-mph National Maximum Speed Limit that Congress finally repealed in
1995. But these under-posted, artificially low speed limits were found
to be very useful in terms of generating an unforseen flow of easy
money for state and local governments -- who soon became addicted. And
it was so much easier for traffic cops to simply shoot fish in a barrel
with their radar guns -- because almost every car on the road was going
faster than the absurdly low posted limits.

Much easier than actually looking for dangerous drivers, anyhow.

This is finally changing, though.

In Colorado, state police have written more than 500 tickets to left
lane hogs since the beginning of the year; in Florida, a bill is on the
legilstive docket that would impose a $60 fine and four DMV "demerit
points" on the driving record of motorists who refuse to allow faster
moving traffic by.

Twenty years ago, this would have been an unthinkable violation of the
politically correct orthodoxy that onle "speed kills" -- and therefore
only enforcing speed limits (no matter how absurd or contrived)
matters.

But in fact, people who refuse to move right represent a major traffic
safety hazard -- whether "they doing the speed limit" (as they often
bleat in self-righteous high dudgeon) or not.

By refusing to allow other motorists to get by, the left lane dawdler
causes traffic to back up unnaturally; drivers then angrily jockey for
position -- and typically are forced into making a passing attempt in
the right lane to get around the hog -- who seems to get some sort of
weird passive-aggressive satisfaction from his obstinancy.

The situation is frustrating, distracting -- and very unsafe. In fact,
the lack of reflexive lane courtesy in this country is arguably the
biggest single safety problem we have -- not "speeding."

Consider the example of Germany -- where yielding to faster-moving
traffic is part of the national culture and adhered to religiously. As
a result, it is possible for the Germans to have unlimited speed
Autobahns -- where drivers in the left lane often overtake other cars
at tripe digit speeds. But because German drivers are taught to use
their mirrors -- and immediately move right to allow faster-moving
approaching cars to pass -- they have a lower accident and fatality
rate than we do here in the United States with our dumbed-down speed
limits.

It will take time for the facts about the danger of left lane hogging
to sink into the general consciousness -- the consequence of 20-plus
years of neglect and outright disinformation peddled by know-nothing
"safety" advocates.

But, at last, things are beginning to change for the better.

Target new drivers, not the hapless ones

BY LARRY LEBOWITZ

The debate rages on across the Sunshine State over Gov. Jeb Bush's veto
of the shrewdly misnamed Road Rage Reduction Act.

The bill -- which passed both houses of the Legislature with just four
dissenting votes -- would have required drivers in the left lane of any
limited-access four-lane roadway to get out of the way when a faster
driver approached from behind, even if the lead driver was traveling at
the speed limit.

Drivers who didn't yield would have been ticketed.

Proponents said the bill, modeled on similar measures in 21 states,
would have provided relief from the phenomenon of ''rolling
roadblocks'' caused by slowpokes driving in the fast lane and impatient
speeders darting through traffic to bypass them.

Citing a lack of empirical evidence, Bush said the bill was trying to
offer relief to the wrong people: ``those traveling at high rates of
speed, or possessed of emotional intemperance, at the expense of
cautious and careful drivers.''

Don't misunderstand: There is a legitimate problem here. Plenty of
oblivious doofuses are puttering along in the far-left lanes of
Interstate 95, the Palmetto Expressway and Florida's Turnpike, where
they have no business. But this bill wasn't the answer.

Here's a novel idea -- one espoused by many Streetwise correspondents.
Instead of pandering to speeders, perhaps lawmakers ought to demand
greater accountability and efficiency from the state Department of
Motor Vehicles.

Why not make sure that new license recipients actually learn the
Florida traffic laws before they legally hit the road?

You know, regulations like slower traffic should stay to the right.

Or that stopping in the middle of the interstate and backing up to the
exit ramp is verboten.

How about finding more money to hire troopers to clear accidents
faster?

Better yet, how about crafting laws that reinforce the rapidly
disappearing concept of personal responsibility, that all drivers
should have a grip on their emotions when they get behind the wheel?

VERSE 1
every car is passing on the right
they're honking and flashing their brights
they're just a bunch of bellyachers
I have to punish those lawbreakers
I don't care if this trip takes all night

CHORUS:
I'm a Slow Driving Man
Driving as slow as I can
Every time you need to go

because I'm a slow driving man

I'm the self appointed keeper of the law
making sure that speeders don't get far
now they're driving on the sidewalk
cause I've made a rolling roadblock
by blocking off the fast lane with my car

CHORUS:

I'm old and I'm slow
got no particular place to go

Every time you need to go

Road rager, eh?  You're the scourge of society.  Eat shit and die,

You crossposted this to rec.motorcycles.  So I'll give you my opinion.  I
own the road on my bike.  When I encounter a slowpoke in the fast lane, I
split the lane and pass.  Big fuckin' deal.  No emotion involved.  No need
to kick out the passenger side mirror, no need to yell in the window, just
get by and get on yer way.

Why would you want to kill someone because he's driving a little slower
than you would like to drive?  You make as much sense as a Christian.

And I say that because I've seen your anti-christian posts in alt.atheism.
Which means you're a bush-licking hypocrite.

The problem most people have with these laws is. People somehow seem to
think that lane restrictions translate to an exemption from the speed limit.
In other words if the speed limit is 65 MPH and someone is driving 65 MPH in
the left lane. Are they "Hogging the road" if someone else wants to drive 75
MPH? If so what exactly are you going to ticket them for? Oh and can I be in
court when you face the judge and the drivers attorney? I'll bring the
doughnuts it  should be fun. Please let it be an older judge with a good
sense of humor, preferably one who is known for liking his i's dotted and

Most states have laws dealing with aggressive drivers. It is amassing how
many people get overly emotional when driving. The best way to determine how
fast you should be traveling is,  look at a car five or ten cars ahead of
you. If that car is traveling at the same speed as the one in front of you.
There is no reason to waste effort passing. Just accept the speed of traffic
and drive safely.

&gt; &gt; The situation is frustrating, distracting -- and very unsafe. In fact,
&gt; &gt; the lack of reflexive lane courtesy in this country is arguably the
&gt; &gt; biggest single safety problem we have -- not &quot;speeding.&quot;

&gt; &gt; Consider the example of Germany -- where yielding to faster-moving
&gt; &gt; traffic is part of the national culture and adhered to religiously. As
&gt; &gt; a result, it is possible for the Germans to have unlimited speed
&gt; &gt; Autobahns -- where drivers in the left lane often overtake other cars
&gt; &gt; at tripe digit speeds. But because German drivers are taught to use
&gt; &gt; their mirrors -- and immediately move right to allow faster-moving
&gt; &gt; approaching cars to pass -- they have a lower accident and fatality
&gt; &gt; rate than we do here in the United States with our dumbed-down speed
&gt; &gt; limits.

&gt; &gt; It will take time for the facts about the danger of left lane hogging
&gt; &gt; to sink into the general consciousness -- the consequence of 20-plus
&gt; &gt; years of neglect and outright disinformation peddled by know-nothing
&gt; &gt; &quot;safety&quot; advocates.

&gt; &gt; But, at last, things are beginning to change for the better.

&gt; &gt; Target new drivers, not the hapless ones

&gt; &gt; BY LARRY LEBOWITZ

&gt; &gt; The debate rages on across the Sunshine State over Gov. Jeb Bush's veto
&gt; &gt; of the shrewdly misnamed Road Rage Reduction Act.

&gt; &gt; The bill -- which passed both houses of the Legislature with just four
&gt; &gt; dissenting votes -- would have required drivers in the left lane of any
&gt; &gt; limited-access four-lane roadway to get out of the way when a faster
&gt; &gt; driver approached from behind, even if the lead driver was traveling at
&gt; &gt; the speed limit.

&gt; &gt; Drivers who didn't yield would have been ticketed.

&gt; &gt; Proponents said the bill, modeled on similar measures in 21 states,
&gt; &gt; would have provided relief from the phenomenon of ''rolling
&gt; &gt; roadblocks'' caused by slowpokes driving in the fast lane and impatient
&gt; &gt; speeders darting through traffic to bypass them.

&gt; &gt; Citing a lack of empirical evidence, Bush said the bill was trying to
&gt; &gt; offer relief to the wrong people: ``those traveling at high rates of
&gt; &gt; speed, or possessed of emotional intemperance, at the expense of
&gt; &gt; cautious and careful drivers.''

&gt; &gt; Don't misunderstand: There is a legitimate problem here. Plenty of
&gt; &gt; oblivious doofuses are puttering along in the far-left lanes of
&gt; &gt; Interstate 95, the Palmetto Expressway and Florida's Turnpike, where
&gt; &gt; they have no business. But this bill wasn't the answer.

&gt; &gt; Here's a novel idea -- one espoused by many Streetwise correspondents.
&gt; &gt; Instead of pandering to speeders, perhaps lawmakers ought to demand
&gt; &gt; greater accountability and efficiency from the state Department of
&gt; &gt; Motor Vehicles.

&gt; &gt; Why not make sure that new license recipients actually learn the
&gt; &gt; Florida traffic laws before they legally hit the road?

&gt; &gt; You know, regulations like slower traffic should stay to the right.

&gt; &gt; Or that stopping in the middle of the interstate and backing up to the
&gt; &gt; exit ramp is verboten.

&gt; &gt; How about finding more money to hire troopers to clear accidents
&gt; &gt; faster?

&gt; &gt; Better yet, how about crafting laws that reinforce the rapidly
&gt; &gt; disappearing concept of personal responsibility, that all drivers
&gt; &gt; should have a grip on their emotions when they get behind the wheel?

Here's the road rage meter. If you thought your city was free from
it...

http://www.monkeymeter.com/citystats.php

I think that if road rage should be coupled with concealed weapon
permits, such as approved by governor Bush. It seems contradictory at
first sight, but (so long as you feel threatened*) you may take justice
in your hands and take care of the left lane hogs, and every person you
hate for that matter. And always remember, DO NOT RETREAT! ;)

*They got tinted windows... How do you know he/she is not pointing a
gun at you? And the LA shooter... Shouldn't all drivers pack a gun as
well?

"Here's a potential scenario: say someone gets upset with someone else.
He or she gets a gun and goes to the other person's home and starts to
shoot. Say the next door neighbor hears these shots and fears for the
safety of her children and husband. She grabs a gun, leaves her home,
and starts shooting. Other neighbors feel threatened, grab weapons, go
out into the street, and starting wounding and killing each other,
simply because they feel threatened. So, because one person was angry,
a block war has started. Could this really happen? It's definitely a
possibility."

Standing your ground
By Editorial Board

Two weeks ago, Florida governor Jeb Bush signed the new "Stand Your
Ground" bill into law. This bill says that a citizen has "no duty to
retreat and has the right to stand his or her ground and meet force
with force, including deadly force if he or she reasonably believes it
is necessary to do so to prevent death or great bodily harm to himself
for herself or another or to prevent the commission of a forcible
felony."

This means that, should someone break into your home, whether you see a
weapon or not, if you feel that your life is threatened - not just your
possessions, but your life - then you have the right to pull out a
weapon and kill that person, simply because you think your life might
be threatened. This means that the person who broke into your home, who
could be completely unarmed, could die at your hands. This law allows
people to do this without fear of prosecution, so you could murder
someone who never threatened you - had no intention of threatening you
- and get off scott free.

In her Time magazine article, Michelle Cottle says, "The Florida
courts, like those elsewhere, have long acknowledged that shooting
someone in self-defense is, on occasion, a tragic necessity. It's just
that, until now, most states have held to the notion that lethal force
should be avoided whenever a reasonable alternative, like running away,
is safely possible."

This makes sense. If violence can be avoided, and no one is hurt, that
would be better for everyone concerned. The intruder or the person who
is allegedly threatening someone else would not have to actually harm
the person who is in the way of their aim, and the person who is being
threatened does not have to worry about if he or she has the courage to
pull a trigger or jam a knife into someone's throat or chest. This
obviously also saves the lives of both the person who is allegedly
threatening someone else and the person who is threatened.

Here's a potential scenario: say someone gets upset with someone else.
He or she gets a gun and goes to the other person's home and starts to
shoot. Say the next door neighbor hears these shots and fears for the
safety of her children and husband. She grabs a gun, leaves her home,
and starts shooting. Other neighbors feel threatened, grab weapons, go
out into the street, and starting wounding and killing each other,
simply because they feel threatened. So, because one person was angry,
a block war has started. Could this really happen? It's definitely a
possibility.

&gt; Target: Left Lane Hogs - Finally!
&gt; by Eric Peters

&gt; Some good news: Left lane hogs are finally getting the attention they
&gt; deserve from traffic cops -- and traffic laws.

&gt; In at least two states -- Colorado and Florida -- cops are begiining to
&gt; target drivers who squat in the far left lane and refuse to move right
&gt; to let faster-moving traffic get by. For decades, these drivers have
&gt; been allowed to create rolling roadblocks and interrupt the smooth (and
&gt; therfore safe) flow of traffic with virtual impunity because &quot;faiure to
&gt; yield&quot; laws were either not on the books -- or not enforced. And
&gt; twenty-plus years of ddumbed-down, politicized &quot;driver's education&quot; and
&gt; &quot;safety&quot; campaigns had effectively propagandized the populace into
&gt; believing their was only one cardinal sin -- &quot;speeding.&quot;

&gt; And so the focus of traffic &quot;safety&quot; enforcement was speed limit laws
&gt; -- which of course were often ridiculous (the best example being the
&gt; 55-mph National Maximum Speed Limit that Congress finally repealed in
&gt; 1995. But these under-posted, artificially low speed limits were found
&gt; to be very useful in terms of generating an unforseen flow of easy
&gt; money for state and local governments -- who soon became addicted. And
&gt; it was so much easier for traffic cops to simply shoot fish in a barrel
&gt; with their radar guns -- because almost every car on the road was going
&gt; faster than the absurdly low posted limits.

&gt; Much easier than actually looking for dangerous drivers, anyhow.

&gt; This is finally changing, though.

&gt; In Colorado, state police have written more than 500 tickets to left
&gt; lane hogs since the beginning of the year; in Florida, a bill is on the
&gt; legilstive docket that would impose a $60 fine and four DMV &quot;demerit
&gt; points&quot; on the driving record of motorists who refuse to allow faster
&gt; moving traffic by.

&gt; Twenty years ago, this would have been an unthinkable violation of the
&gt; politically correct orthodoxy that onle &quot;speed kills&quot; -- and therefore
&gt; only enforcing speed limits (no matter how absurd or contrived)
&gt; matters.

&gt; But in fact, people who refuse to move right represent a major traffic
&gt; safety hazard -- whether &quot;they doing the speed limit&quot; (as they often
&gt; bleat in self-righteous high dudgeon) or not.

&gt; By refusing to allow other motorists to get by, the left lane dawdler
&gt; causes traffic to back up unnaturally; drivers then angrily jockey for
&gt; position -- and typically are forced into making a passing attempt in
&gt; the right lane to get around the hog -- who seems to get some sort of
&gt; weird passive-aggressive satisfaction from his obstinancy.

&gt; The situation is frustrating, distracting -- and very unsafe. In fact,
&gt; the lack of reflexive lane courtesy in this country is arguably the
&gt; biggest single safety problem we have -- not &quot;speeding.&quot;

&gt; Consider the example of Germany -- where yielding to faster-moving
&gt; traffic is part of the national culture and adhered to religiously. As
&gt; a result, it is possible for the Germans to have unlimited speed
&gt; Autobahns -- where drivers in the left lane often overtake other cars
&gt; at tripe digit speeds. But because German drivers are taught to use
&gt; their mirrors -- and immediately move right to allow faster-moving
&gt; approaching cars to pass -- they have a lower accident and fatality
&gt; rate than we do here in the United States with our dumbed-down speed
&gt; limits.

&gt; It will take time for the facts about the danger of left lane hogging

Yes!!  There are valid, legal reasons for exceeding posted speed limits.
These are few but the lane hog has no way of knowing if the person behind
him has one. Therefore, he is legally obligated to give way and move over,
at least in Va. You can look up your own states laws on www.findlaw.com .

Enforcement is anther matter.  It is illegal to drive in the left lane of a
multilane highway in Virginia but the state's attorney ruled that the law
was unenforcable so nobody gets ticketed.

I think they somewhat got to the point of a nation where laws work for
the people (as opposed to for the lawyers), but I understand they still
got much to do in this respect. I remember the opinion of a Canadian
truckdriver who saw with envy the lane discipline of France. Here it
goes...

WE SHOULD LISTEN TO THE VOICE OF EXPERIENCE

A wide variety of problems on our highways contribute to making driving

a difficult and patience-trying endeavour on most days. And for the
professionals who make a living behind the wheel, those problems can
even make for a hard day's work. Overcrowding of our road system, the
poor condition of major highways, and plain bad manners top my list of
grievances.

Recently I had the opportunity to drive on some highways in France and
couldn't help but notice remarkable differences in 'highway manners'
when compared to those of North American drivers.

One of the first things a person will notice is that on many stretches,

the speed limit on French highways is 130 km/hr. The most common speed
limit on similar highways in Canada is 100 km/hr, with the occasional
route at 110 km/hr. It took some adjusting for me to get comfortable
with the 130 km/hr limit, but not as much as one might have thought.
Before long I was keeping pace with the locals, and while moving along
with the traffic it was easy to observe some clear differences in
driving habits when compared to North American drivers, and to witness
how well the practice of sharing the road can work.

One such difference is the way in which drivers observe what Canadian
officials term "lane discipline".

On the French highways the outside lane is used for passing, not for
hanging around. While I was pushing my little rented Citroën along in
an inside lane I was regularly overtaken by larger, faster cars, all of

which promptly moved back to the inside lane once they were safely
around me, leaving the outside lane for the next vehicle that wanted to

move faster than the crowd.

A couple of years ago I participated on a road safety committee
organized by Ontario's then Minister of Transportation. There were a
number of associations and other safety and enforcement personnel on
the committee and we were charged with exploring ways in which
Ontario's roads could be made safer and to make specific
recommendations to the Minister.

I recall some senior enforcement officers on the committee voicing
their concern with the lack of lane discipline on Ontario's highways.
They described it as a principal cause of aggressive driving and road
rage, and urged us to raise the visibility of lane discipline as a
safety issue in our recommendations.

The officers felt that an educational program that would explain proper

lane usage could prove to be an enormous benefit. Drivers camped out in

the passing lane, or in some cases in the middle lane, routinely clog
up the highways, leading to frustration on the part of other drivers
and in some cases to those frustrated drivers taking risks that lead to

accidents and fatalities.

The officers on that committee lauded the European model of lane
discipline and advocated a campaign to convert our drivers to that
model. Unfortunately the recommendation was never acted on and we still

deal with problem drivers who will not yield the passing lane.

I confess that at the time I didn't see the problem as being quite as
serious as the officials described. Sure, I had experienced being held
up by someone who wouldn't move over and was impeding my trip to
wherever, but it seemed more of a minor and temporary inconvenience
than anything else.

But now, having reviewed in my mind the comments and recommendations
made by those enforcement officials, and having witnessed first hand
how well lane discipline works, I'm more inclined to agree with them.
This is a subject that is well worth the attention of Transportation
Ministers across the Country.

Is it actually enforced? I also wonder how this works given
that the rules on lane disipline vary drastically from state
to state. Are there signs at the Pa border warning me that
driving in the left lane except to pass is illegal and
subject to heavy fines? If I am on a federally funded
highway is it reasonable for Pa autorities to make unique
rules for Pa? Also, if there are three lanes in a direction,
is everyone required to drive in the right most lane? Hows
does that work? How soon can you move over to the left lane
to pass - just before you ram the car you are going to pass,
or 10 miles before you reach them? Seems like a very
diificult law to enforce, not matter how pure the motivation
behind it.

Speed limit rules is a poor counter example. Both states
have speed limits. Sure they vary from state to state, but
they also vary from road to road within a state, and even
road segment to road segment within a state. But the concept
is the same. You have signs with posted limits. Everyone
know what that means, no matter where they got their
license. The keep right except to pass laws are not the
same. It is not a crime to drive in the left lane in NC
(even in area posted with slower traffic keep right signs as
long as you are doing the speed limit), and it is legally OK
to pass on the right in NC.

I don't see them as disingenuous at all. Seem like lots of
loopholes that will make fair enforcement difficult. It
seems like the police have a lot of latitude for selective
enforcement. Any idea of the actual conviction rate for
people who choose to fight a ticket (don't include people
who find it more convenient to just pay the fine than go to
court).

Personally I wish all the states would adopt similar rules
and fines. It seems to me that $136 fine is a very high
price to pay for a relatively minor infraction. Most of the
people who are going to be offended by people driving in the
left lane are probably guilty of breaking other rules at
least occasionally (like speeding, running stop signs, not
yielding when turning right on red, making unsafe movements
at traffic signals, etc.). I would hope that the fine for
doing 75 in a 65 zone or running a red light is much higher
than for driving in the left lane (at least 2X).

Simply not true. Virginia has no requirements for traveling in any lane
except on certain roads. Localities can pass laws that restrict lanes, but
there is no state wide law. The only exception is for vehicles traveling at
excessively slow speeds. By definition a vehicle traveling at the maximum
speed limit is not traveling at an excessively slow speed. A vehicle
traveling at above the speed limit is not given any special right of ways.

&gt; &quot;Most states follow the Uniform Vehicle Code and require drivers to keep
&gt; right if they are going slower than the normal speed of traffic
&gt; (regardless of the speed limit; see below). These are listed as &quot;slower&quot;,
&gt; with an asterisk if vehicles lawfully using the left lane must yield to
&gt; overtaking traffic.&quot;
&gt; [Tx is noted as &quot;slower&quot;, so move right when someone overtakes you.]

&gt; TRANSPORTATION CODE
&gt; CHAPTER 544. TRAFFIC SIGNS, SIGNALS, AND MARKINGS

&gt; § 544.011.  LANE USE SIGNS.  If, on a highway having more
&gt; than one lane with vehicles traveling in the same direction, the
&gt; Texas Department of Transportation or a local authority places a
&gt; sign that directs slower traffic to travel in a lane other than the
&gt; farthest left lane, the sign must read &quot;left lane for passing only.&quot;

&gt; Added by Acts 1997, 75th Leg., ch. 628, § 1, eff. Sept. 1, 1997.

&gt; &quot;Driving slowly in the left lane
&gt; If you are in the left lane and someone wants to pass, move over and let
&gt; them by. You may be &quot;in the right&quot; because you are traveling at the speed
&gt; limit — but you may also be putting yourself in danger by making drivers
&gt; behind you angry. In many states and provinces the law requires you to
&gt; travel in the right lane and use the far left lane only for passing.
&gt; Besides, it's simple courtesy to move over and let other drivers by.&quot;
">

I agree with this for the most part. The problem I have is some people
forget it is a courtesy and not a law. At least not in many states. In
Virginia we have many roads that require you to be in the left lane to exit.
Therefore it is reasonable to be in the left lane and obey the speed limit.
This avoids putting drivers in a situation when they have to change lanes at
the last moment in order to take an exit.

A video camera showing more than one vehicle stuck behind a driver in
the passing lane should suffice.  IIRC, these laws have text that detail
how much distance you can travel before you must return to the right

It is rather simple to enforce.  If you drive in the left lane
except to overtake another vehicle you can get a citation,
period.  If you are going the same speed there is no reason to
overtake the vehicle ahead is there?

The fine for most moving violation listed in Pa Title #75, the
Motor Vehicle Code, is $25.  Additions like a CAT fee, EMS fee
and court costs make up the difference, taking the average fine
to $136.

&gt;&gt; same. It is not a crime to drive in the left lane in NC
&gt;&gt; (even in area posted with slower traffic keep right signs as

I'll do my very best to comply with your suggestion. Can you have a chat

what do gun laws have to do with traffic rules? The federal government has
forced lots of motor vehicle regulations by threatening to withhold road tax
revenues from states - why can't they force uniform traffic rules (see 55
mph speed limit for one bad example of this)? And to tie back into your
somewhat irrelevant comment on firearms, the Federal government has forced
certain firearm regulations on states despite the 2nd amendment. Encouraging
all the states to have similar motor vehicle laws should be a piece of cake.

I think you don't know what a straw man argument is. I do concede that I may

have any problems with keep right except to pass laws. I do have a problem
with the lack of uniformity (particularly as it applies to major Interstate
Routes) and the lack of clear definition of the rules. You (and others) may
think it is clear what constitutes a violation of the keep right except to
pass laws, but it is not at all clear to me. It seems to me that at least
some people in this newsgroup who constantly gripe about people driving in
the left lane really want a law that requires people to stay the heck out of
there way, no matter how they are driving. I agree that common courtesy
dictates that people should not hog the left lane or block faster traffic
for extended periods of time. However, I also believe that common courtesy
requires that faster traffic allow people to complete reasonably executed
passes without harassment (like flashing headlights, tailgating, etc.-
reasonably executed doesn't include "micro-passes").  Now if you want  some
straw man examples, I am sure I can think of a few. But if they are true,
are they really straw man arguments? It seems to me that the "anti-sloth"

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Hows does that work?

&gt;&gt;&gt;It works by one staying in the right lane until coming up on a slower
&gt;&gt;&gt;vehicle ahead of you.  Then one checks for and yields (as necessary) to
&gt;&gt;&gt;passing traffic before pulling out to pass.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;How soon can you move over to the left lane
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;to pass - just before you ram the car you are going to pass,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;or 10 miles before you reach them?

&gt;&gt;&gt;About the time you get to a 2 or 3 second following distance (or about
&gt;&gt;&gt;200 feet, give or take).

&gt;&gt; Is this in the law, or does the policeman get to decide?

&gt; As with most of life it's a &quot;for prevailing conditions&quot; issue. Take it up
&gt; with the judge.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Seems like a very difficult law to enforce

&gt;&gt;&gt;Only to those who ask disingenuous questions.

&gt;&gt; I don't see them as disingenuous at all. Seem like lots of
&gt;&gt; loopholes that will make fair enforcement difficult. It
&gt;&gt; seems like the police have a lot of latitude for selective
&gt;&gt; enforcement. Any idea of the actual conviction rate for
&gt;&gt; people who choose to fight a ticket (don't include people
&gt;&gt; who find it more convenient to just pay the fine than go to
&gt;&gt; court).

&gt; Who said life had to be fare. Take it up with the judge.

&gt;&gt; Personally I wish all the states would adopt similar rules
&gt;&gt; and fines. It seems to me that $136 fine is a very high
&gt;&gt; price to pay for a relatively minor infraction. Most of the
&gt;&gt; people who are going to be offended by people driving in the
&gt;&gt; left lane are probably guilty of breaking other rules at
&gt;&gt; least occasionally (like speeding, running stop signs, not
&gt;&gt; yielding when turning right on red, making unsafe movements
&gt;&gt; at traffic signals, etc.). I would hope that the fine for
&gt;&gt; doing 75 in a 65 zone or running a red light is much higher
&gt;&gt; than for driving in the left lane (at least 2X).

&gt; All of the above is specious. It's not your job to enforce traffic codes.
&gt; Take it up with the judge.

Wow, I must really be obtuse (or was I making a straw man arguement and

See, there's where we have a difference of opinion.  Failure to follow
KRETP is in my opinion more dangerous than just about any other action
except for something like actually cutting off another vehicle, not
signaling in an instance where it is important to show your intentions
to other traffic, etc.  Not only is it dangerous, but the traffic that
ensues undoubtedly has serious impacts both in time and fuel use, which
add up if you live in a generally congested area.  Not to mention that
it's just freakin' rude, and usually an infallible sign that the person
engaging in such behavior hasn't a clue how to drive.

&gt; You're being intentionally obtuse. 1 car length for each 10 mph of
&gt; speed. That means no closer than mph/10 (in car lengths). Closer than
&gt; that would then be tailgating. Maintain your distance or move left. If
&gt; you move left you are then in a situation where you are obligated to
&gt; pass and get back over. Otherwise, if you are unwilling to motivate past
&gt; the other vehicle appropriately (passing), then adjust your speed and
&gt; stay put.

&gt; It's really nothing more than putting together the pre-existing rules
&gt; into a cohesive solution to a driving situation. Anyone who can't do
&gt; these basic things shouldn't be driving.
">

A better method is to look at distance over time.  If a car behind you
in the left lane is closing on you, and then eventually reaches you and
needs to slow down to not hit you, if you had time anywhere up to the
point the guy is right behind you (or it soon opens up), and you don't
pull to the right, you are lane blocking.

It's really as simple as this:  You can stay in the left lane as long as
you want, as long as the lanes to the right of you aren't, in general,
passing you, or there isn't someone behind you in the left lane who was
clearly going faster than you before they reached you.  As soon as it's
clear the driver behind you wants to go faster than you, you pull to the
right as soon as safely possible.

I think what a lot of people are doing wrong is that they assume just
because you pull to the right, doesn't mean you can't immediately go
back in the left lane once the faster driver(s) pass you.  I do it all
the time; if I see a long line of cars in the non-left-lane I'm in that
I want to pass, I'll pull into the left lane and try to pass them all at
once.  If I notice someone getting close to me, as soon as I see an
opening I can pull into towards the right, I will until that driver
passes me.  If I still want to pass more cars, I go in the left lane as
if I were just pulling into that lane for the first time.

Also, cruise control...  I think part of the problem is that people who
use cruise control in the left lane (and are going faster than those in
the right lane(s)) don't understand that they can just step on the gas
to temporarily go faster to get around people so that they can yield to
faster drivers behind them in the left lane.

&gt; &gt; Virginia we have many roads that require you to be in the left lane to

&gt; &gt; speed limit. This avoids putting drivers in a situation when they have

&gt; those would then clearly be the exception. wouldn't they? it appears to me

Obeying the law is not "playing traffic cop" It is just doing what is right.

&gt;&gt;&gt;In Virginia we have many roads that require you to be in the left lane to
&gt;&gt;&gt;exit.

&gt;&gt;Which is why most, if not all, &quot;keep right&quot; laws have an exemption for
&gt;&gt;when you're preparing to make a left turn or exit.

&gt; So please define &quot;prepareing to make a left turn&quot;. As it would apply to a
&gt; person on the interstate who knows he/she has to make a left exit.
">

Is there a left exit in your _immediate_ future? Can you actually see
the exit? IMO, then you can prepare to take it.

The exact distance depends, of course, on conditions at a given place
and time and is subject to an officer's interpretation, but I use as
little as a couple hundred feet and as much as a quarter mile as my
personal rule of thumb.

&gt; The word Normal is something we could go on for days about. I'll just say

"Normal speed of traffic" usually refers to the 50th percentile speed of
free-flowing traffic at that place and time.

Which is, at least in the US, often in excess of the posted speed limit.

Of course; the 50th percentile speed (IOW, median speed) is about 5 to 7
mph lower than the 85th percentile speed.  On interstates, 65 mph
represents the 30th percentile speed of traffic.  Seventy mph represents
the 40th to 60th percentile speed.

Ok lets go with the guarter mile. Someone who wants to take a left exit (at
the speed limit) has to wait untill he is within a quarter mile than he can
get in the left lane. The next question is;  if several cars are going past
at 65 or 70 when he is trying to do it. At what point is it ok for him to
just pull in front of the speeder so he does not miss his exit? Do the
speeders have to slow down if they see the person to their right signaling
to change lanes? Or do they get to just keep going regardless.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;If you are in the left lane and someone wants to pass, move over and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;let them by. You may be &quot;in the right&quot; because you are traveling at the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;speed limit — but you may also be putting yourself in danger by making
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;drivers behind you angry. In many states and provinces the law requires
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;you to travel in the right lane and use the far left lane only for
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;passing. Besides, it's simple courtesy to move over and let other
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;drivers by.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I agree with this for the most part. The problem I have is some people
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;forget it is a courtesy and not a law. At least not in many states. In

&gt;&gt;&gt;AAA calls it a &quot;courtesy&quot;. Texas code (quoted) and others (inferred in
&gt;&gt;&gt;other posts) make it law.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Virginia we have many roads that require you to be in the left lane to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;exit. Therefore it is reasonable to be in the left lane and obey the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;speed limit. This avoids putting drivers in a situation when they have
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to change lanes at the last moment in order to take an exit.

&gt;&gt;&gt;those would then clearly be the exception. wouldn't they? it appears to
&gt;&gt;&gt;me that most of the people continuing this debate in the face of cited
&gt;&gt;&gt;laws are those seeking a way to rationalize their desire to play traffic
&gt;&gt;&gt;cop and moral custodian of other people's driving habit (in the face of
&gt;&gt;&gt;existing traffic codes).

&gt;&gt; Obeying the law is not &quot;playing traffic cop&quot; It is just doing what is
&gt;&gt; right. I sorry if obeying the law is offensive to you. Most people who
&gt;&gt; think they are exempted from speed limits are reading the law wrong.

&gt; once again, you're running in circles. that point has already been
&gt; addressed using the existing statutes. it was slapped down as the retreat
&gt; of the self-righteous the first time it was used. bringing it up for the
&gt; 3rd or 4th time doesn't chance the outcome. KRETP means just that; nothing
&gt; more and nothing less. It is NOT your place to try and enforce traffic
&gt; laws by violating those very laws you attempt to wrap yourself in to
&gt; justify your unwillingness to learn.
">

First off I get paid to enforce the laws. Second I am well aware of what
they are. I am trying to help some of you understand them better. If you
don't want to learn you can just keep pretending you know more than everyone
else. Also you should realise not all states have the same laws. Virginia
has no state wide KRETP law. Some states have very strict KRETP laws. I live
in Virginia. So I was discussing Virginia law. Somehow Texas got thrown in
there. Texas law doesn't apply to Virginia.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I don't see why not.  If PA can have 65 and 55 mph limits on its

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;certainly possible.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Speed limit rules is a poor counter example. Both states
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;have speed limits. Sure they vary from state to state, but
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;they also vary from road to road within a state, and even
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;road segment to road segment within a state. But the concept
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;is the same. You have signs with posted limits. Everyone
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;know what that means, no matter where they got their
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;license. The keep right except to pass laws are not the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;same. It is not a crime to drive in the left lane in NC
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;(even in area posted with slower traffic keep right signs as
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;long as you are doing the speed limit), and it is legally OK
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;to pass on the right in NC.

&gt;&gt;&gt;So stay in NC. Each state has different gun laws in spite of the 2nd
&gt;&gt;&gt;Amendment too. I dare you to apply NC's laws in NY with the expectation
&gt;&gt;&gt;of doing so with impunity.

&gt;&gt; I'll do my very best to comply with your suggestion. Can you have a chat
&gt;&gt; with NY residents and see if you can convince them to avoid NC? And
&gt;&gt; exactly what do gun laws have to do with traffic rules? The federal
&gt;&gt; government has forced lots of motor vehicle regulations by threatening to
&gt;&gt; withhold road tax revenues from states - why can't they force uniform
&gt;&gt; traffic rules (see 55 mph speed limit for one bad example of this)? And
&gt;&gt; to tie back into your somewhat irrelevant comment on firearms, the
&gt;&gt; Federal government has forced certain firearm regulations on states
&gt;&gt; despite the 2nd amendment. Encouraging all the states to have similar
&gt;&gt; motor vehicle laws should be a piece of cake.

&gt; My but aren't you the dense little droogie? Why should people who obey
&gt; VA's existing traffic laws be asked to stay away by locals who can't seem
&gt; to comprehend them (or refuse to in their headlong dash to stick their

No it hasn't. Pretending you somehow found that law in the code of Virginia
doesn't make it true. There is no state wide KRETP law in Virginia.

Here is a line from the often misunderstood 46.2-804
4. The Commonwealth Transportation Board, or local authorities in their
respective jurisdictions, may designate right lanes for slow-moving
vehicles;

Now if you have to stay to the right if you're going slower than everyone

&gt;&gt; a problem with the lack of uniformity (particularly as it applies to
&gt;&gt; major Interstate Routes) and the lack of clear definition of the rules.
&gt;&gt; You (and others) may think it is clear what constitutes a violation of
&gt;&gt; the keep right except to pass laws, but it is not at all clear to me. It
&gt;&gt; seems to me that at least some people in this newsgroup who constantly
&gt;&gt; gripe about people driving in the left lane really want a law that
&gt;&gt; requires people to stay the heck out of there way, no matter how they are
&gt;&gt; driving. I agree that common courtesy dictates that people should not hog
&gt;&gt; the left lane or block faster traffic for extended periods of time.
&gt;&gt; However, I also believe that common courtesy requires that faster traffic
&gt;&gt; allow people to complete reasonably executed passes without harassment
&gt;&gt; (like flashing headlights, tailgating, etc.- reasonably executed doesn't
&gt;&gt; include &quot;micro-passes&quot;).  Now if you want  some straw man examples, I am
&gt;&gt; sure I can think of a few. But if they are true, are they really straw
&gt;&gt; man arguments? It seems to me that the &quot;anti-sloth&quot; zealots constantly
&gt;&gt; report on people who don't drive to suit their tastes to justify their
&gt;&gt; bad behavior.

&gt; Lack of uniformity abounds around the country. That's protected in The
&gt; Constitution (power resides in The People, then the various States, then
&gt; such powers are loaned, to the fed -- 10th Amendment)

&gt; It's part of the human intellect to be able to learn and adapt to changing
&gt; environments. If a person is unable to do so, then at the very least they
&gt; shouldn't be doing a complex task like driving. Some would suggest that
&gt; Darwinism should claim them before they breed.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Also, if there are three lanes in a direction,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;is everyone required to drive in the right most lane?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;If they're not passing anyone, then they're required to drive in the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;right most lane.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;OK, but I was thinking of cases where there was a lot of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;traffic. Seems unrealistic to think that you'd have one lane
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;almost full of cars and two virtually empty lanes.

&gt;&gt;&gt;So you're a city boy without any experience outside of metroplexes. That
&gt;&gt;&gt;explains a lot. My daughter learned to drive in an area with about 3
&gt;&gt;&gt;million people crammed together. When she got out on the Interstates you
&gt;&gt;&gt;knew it, too. She'd tailgate like it was rush hour even when the other
&gt;&gt;&gt;car was the only other car for miles around. It took a lot of fatherly
&gt;&gt;&gt;concern and tempered words to get through to her that it's okay to be a
&gt;&gt;&gt;mile or two behind someone without fearing getting lost or whatever the
&gt;&gt;&gt;agoraphobic symptom is for drivers.

&gt;&gt; No I am not a city boy. I guess I was being obtuse again...or you are. I
&gt;&gt; have no idea why you decided I was a city boy, or what your daughters
&gt;&gt; dangerous driving habits have to do with keeping right except to pass
&gt;&gt; rules.

&gt; Clearly your &quot;where there was a lot of traffic&quot; is where the conclusion
&gt; came from. You stake a position, it gets knocked down with supporting
&gt; cites, you claim you don't understand why the point was even mentioned in
&gt; the reply. Rinse and repeat. You are either a troll or are retarded.

&gt; The example I gave was or a specific driver who insisted on following her
&gt; own rules that &quot;gave her comfort&quot; in some way in spite of them being
&gt; detrimental to her and other people's safety and well being. In her case
&gt; she was able to comprehend a dialog and followed an arc of learning which
&gt; resulted in a change in driving habits. But then she's a Cuma Sum Laud
&gt; (HS), National Honor Society (HS all 4 years), and was selected as THE top
&gt; Texas student in Dietetics during her Senior year of college.

&gt; I doubt that it takes that level of intelligence to be able to tie
&gt; together the general traffic laws into a cohesive plan of action for each
&gt; developing situation while driving. Have we devolved as a society to the
&gt; point where each and every situation need unique, explicitly detailed sets
&gt; of rules on how to act?  Surely there are people out there who can
&gt; function in all the different aspects of their lives with a minimal number
&gt; of basic guidelines and extrapolate from there.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Hows does that work?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;It works by one staying in the right lane until coming up on a slower
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;vehicle ahead of you.  Then one checks for and yields (as necessary) to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;passing traffic before pulling out to pass.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;How soon can you move over to the left lane
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;to pass - just before you ram the car you are going to pass,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;or 10 miles before you reach them?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;About the time you get to a 2 or 3 second following distance (or about
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;200 feet, give or take).

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Is this in the law, or does the policeman get to decide?

&gt;&gt;&gt;As with most of life it's a &quot;for prevailing conditions&quot; issue. Take it up
&gt;&gt;&gt;with the judge.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Seems like a very difficult law to enforce

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Only to those who ask disingenuous questions.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I don't see them as disingenuous at all. Seem like lots of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;loopholes that will make fair enforcement difficult. It
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;seems like the police have a lot of latitude for selective
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;enforcement. Any idea of the actual conviction rate for
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;people who choose to fight a ticket (don't include people
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;who find it more convenient to just pay the fine than go to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;court).

&gt;&gt;&gt;Who said life had to be fare. Take it up with the judge.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Personally I wish all the states would adopt similar rules
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;and fines. It seems to me that $136 fine is a very high
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;price to pay for a relatively minor infraction. Most of the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;people who are going to be offended by people driving in the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;left lane are probably guilty of breaking other rules at
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;least occasionally (like speeding, running stop signs, not
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;yielding when turning right on red, making unsafe

&gt;&gt;&gt; diificult law to enforce, not matter how pure the motivation
&gt;&gt;&gt; behind it.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Ed

&gt;&gt; You're being intentionally obtuse. 1 car length for each 10 mph of speed.
&gt;&gt; That means no closer than mph/10 (in car lengths). Closer than that would
&gt;&gt; then be tailgating. Maintain your distance or move left. If you move left
&gt;&gt; you are then in a situation where you are obligated to pass and get back
&gt;&gt; over. Otherwise, if you are unwilling to motivate past the other vehicle
&gt;&gt; appropriately (passing), then adjust your speed and stay put.

&gt;&gt; It's really nothing more than putting together the pre-existing rules
&gt;&gt; into a cohesive solution to a driving situation. Anyone who can't do
&gt;&gt; these basic things shouldn't be driving.

&gt; A better method is to look at distance over time.  If a car behind you in
&gt; the left lane is closing on you, and then eventually reaches you and needs
&gt; to slow down to not hit you, if you had time anywhere up to the point the
&gt; guy is right behind you (or it soon opens up), and you don't pull to the
&gt; right, you are lane blocking.
">

Are you the one from Texas? In Virginia we have exactly the opposite for
law. If you are in the left lane going 55 mph (speed limit) and someone is
coming up behind you. It is the responsibility of the overtaking vehicle to
change lanes. That part really confuses people from other states.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; It's really as simple as this:  You can stay in the left lane as long as
&gt; you want, as long as the lanes to the right of you aren't, in general,
&gt; passing you, or there isn't someone behind you in the left lane who was
&gt; clearly going faster than you before they reached you.  As soon as it's
&gt; clear the driver behind you wants to go faster than you, you pull to the
&gt; right as soon as safely possible.

&gt; I think what a lot of people are doing wrong is that they assume just
&gt; because you pull to the right, doesn't mean you can't immediately go back
&gt; in the left lane once the faster driver(s) pass you.  I do it all the
&gt; time; if I see a long line of cars in the non-left-lane I'm in that I want
&gt; to pass, I'll pull into the left lane and try to pass them all at once.
&gt; If I notice someone getting close to me, as soon as I see an opening I can
&gt; pull into towards the right, I will until that driver passes me.  If I
&gt; still want to pass more cars, I go in the left lane as if I were just
&gt; pulling into that lane for the first time.

The above doesn't make sense. In most states it is illegal to pass a car
while being passed. That doesn't exactly cover what (I think) you discribed
but it comes real close.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Also, cruise control...  I think part of the problem is that people who
&gt; use cruise control in the left lane (and are going faster than those in

&gt; temporarily go faster to get around people so that they can yield to
&gt; faster drivers behind them in the left lane.

Most people understand the word "normal;" in other words, a
representative number for the speed of the main flow of traffic.
Depending on how you interpret it, in this specific context it could
refer to the peak of the bell curve of speed distribution, or the 50th
percentile speed, but in either case it is entirely independent of the
speed limit.

No matter how you slice it, it is difficult to justify driving in the
left lane at the speed limit when other traffic wishes to pass, given
the above.  I've logged a few miles in Virginia; generally any
definition of "normal" is above the posted limit disregarding
especially congested areas like the DC Beltway and I-66 during rush
hour.

All that says is that "The driver of any vehicle traveling at an
unlawful speed shall forfeit any right-of-way which he might otherwise
have under this article."  I don't see that as relieving you (driving
at a supposedly legal speed) from your responsibility to obey the other
two sections above - it just means that the faster driver does not have
the legal right to expect you to move out of his way (even though you
are still required to do so.)  A hair-splitting point, perhaps, but
there you have it.

I have to admit that I am not a big fan of the way Virginia's laws are
written, as they do allow some room for misinterpretation by the
Claybrookian crowd, but that was the example given.  The fact that
normal travel speeds are often classified as "reckless driving" doesn't
warm the cockles of my heart much, either.  The good news is, that
outside of the metro DC area, Virginia drivers generally understand the
spirit of KRETP laws and drive in a sensible, considerate manner.

such lane is available for travel except when overtaking and passing another

the driver of an overtaken vehicle shall give way to the right in favor of
the overtaking vehicle on audible signal and shall not increase the speed of
his vehicle until completely passed by the overtaking vehicle.

§ 46.2-842.1. It shall be unlawful to fail to give way to overtaking traffic
when driving a motor vehicle to the left and abreast of another motor
vehicle on a divided highway. On audible or light signal, the driver of the
overtaken vehicle shall move to the right to allow the overtaking vehicle to
pass as soon as the overtaken vehicle can safely do so.

Note that there is NO mention of speed limits or emergency vehicles.

FYI

§ 46.2-857. Driving two abreast in a single lane.

A person shall be guilty of reckless driving who drives any motor vehicle,

Adapting is easier if you know you are supposed to adapt.
However, how are you supposed to adapt when you don't know
the rules have changed. I have a personal experience that
sort of illustrates the point. Years ago I took a job in
Michigan. Once in Michigan I applied for a drivers license.
They made me take the written test. I missed one question. I
said it was OK to pass on the right on a multilane highway.
In Michigan, it wasn't legal (although I saw it done many
times). I only stayed in Michigan for a short time before
moving back to NC. When back in NC, I applied for a new NC
drivers license. Again they made me take the written test.
Again I missed one question. I said it was illegal to pass
on the right. Guess what, in NC it was not illegal. In both
states people routinely passed on the right. In one they
were breaking the law, in the other they weren't. How am I
suppose to "adapt" in this situation? Observation would lead
me to believe it was legal, and therefore there was no
"legal" reason for me not to do so. However, in theory (and
maybe this is a straw man), a policeman in Michigan could
have given me a ticket for passing on the right.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;right most lane.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;OK, but I was thinking of cases where there was a lot of
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;traffic. Seems unrealistic to think that you'd have one lane
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;almost full of cars and two virtually empty lanes.

&gt; &gt;&gt;So you're a city boy without any experience outside of metroplexes. That
&gt; &gt;&gt;explains a lot. My daughter learned to drive in an area with about 3
&gt; &gt;&gt;million people crammed together. When she got out on the Interstates you
&gt; &gt;&gt;knew it, too. She'd tailgate like it was rush hour even when the other car
&gt; &gt;&gt;was the only other car for miles around. It took a lot of fatherly concern
&gt; &gt;&gt;and tempered words to get through to her that it's okay to be a mile or

&gt; &gt; No I am not a city boy. I guess I was being obtuse again...or you are. I
&gt; &gt; have no idea why you decided I was a city boy, or what your daughters
&gt; &gt; dangerous driving habits have to do with keeping right except to pass rules.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;people who are going to be offended by people driving in the

I have never claimed that "setting up camp in the left lane

North Carolina has similar signs on some roads as well (and
the "slower traffic keep right" signs too), but the actual
NC statues expempt cars moving at the posted speed limit. So
at least in NC, the officer would first need to determine
that you were driving under the speed limit and that you
were not actually passing a vehicle. And probably even then,
he would ignore you if there weren't any cars around but
you. Hardly seem like it would ever be enforced in NC (don't
know about Texas). In PA it seems that the law is a little
less vauge. Still I think the fine as quoted by Mike is
excessive. And I believe (an opinion) that it could be
subject to abuse (I am not saying it is, just that it could
be). Seems like the sort of law an officer might trot out if
he is having a bad day, or doesn't like the way you look, or
the car you drive, or the fact that you are from out of

&gt; &gt; Ed

&gt; You're being intentionally obtuse. 1 car length for each 10 mph of
&gt; speed. That means no closer than mph/10 (in car lengths). Closer than
&gt; that would then be tailgating. Maintain your distance or move left. If
&gt; you move left you are then in a situation where you are obligated to
&gt; pass and get back over. Otherwise, if you are unwilling to motivate past
&gt; the other vehicle appropriately (passing), then adjust your speed and
&gt; stay put.
">

You love that word obtuse. I think you are over simplifying.
Here's a case for you....

I am driving 85 in a 70 zone (people do it all the time on
I-95 in NC). I am approaching a car doing 45 (the legal
minimum). How far back should I begin to change lanes? Your
suggestion says I should begin to change lanes 8.5 car
lenghts behind the slower vehicle. This is around 135 feet.
It will take about 2.3 sec to close the gap between the two
cars with a 40 mph closing velocity. Don't you think it
would be better to move over sooner? At least give the guy
in the slower car a chance to realize what is happening.
Also, many times if I wait until I am only 10 car leght per
10 mph behind another vehicle, someone in the line behind me
will jump out into the left lane first, leaving me to decide
whether it is OK to pull over in the left lane in front of
the other car (which is often a cowardly duckling using me
as a shield), or that I need to get on the brakes hard to
fall in behind the slower car so that the lane jumper can
go. And if I actually jump on the brakes to fall in, doing
so will cause all the ducklings behind me to slow down
immeadiately, slowing the whole process down. So, at leaste
for this example (which you are free to claim is a straw
man, but I won't agree), I think your suggested lane
changing distance is not a good one. I'd prefer to move over
about 5 sec before I reach a much slower moving vehicle I
plan to pass. In my example, this would be about 300 feet
behind the slower car. For cars at close to the same speed
(like me doing 70, the other car doing 65), I'd be inclined
to follow your rule.

I have no problem with moving left to pass...but how do you
handle this situation -

I am driving 70 in a 70 zone (nice and legal). I catch up to
a tractor-trailer rig doing 65 (again legal) in the right
lane. As I get ready to pass the slower vehicle, there is
another car more than 250 yards (750 feet) behind me that is
doing 85 (illegal, but routine). At that distance, it is not
so easy to determine the closing rate of the car behind me.
I pull out to pass the slower vehicle when I am 7 car
lenghts behind (110 feet), at which point the 85 mph vehicle
is 250 yards behind me, also in the right lane. I pass the
truck and pull back in when I am 7 car lenghts ahead (110
feet) Assume a single trailer rig of 55 ft lenght for the
truck. Total time to pass the big rig would be about 38 sec.
However during this 38 sec, the 85 mph car would have caught
me and had to wait for approximately 2 sec for me to
complete my pass. Is it reasonable for me to expect the 85
mph driver to wait at extra 2 sec to complete my pass? Or
should I wait 34 sec for the 85 mph car to catch me and then
wait another 5 sec for the 85 mph car to get 7 car lenghts
ahead before I begin my pass. During these 39 sec, I'd be
travelling at 65 mph instead of 70 mph, so I have lost
around 3 sec myself. To net it out, is there any rule either
by statute, morals, or common courtesy that says someone
breaking the law has a right to expect me to lose 3 seconds
of travel time so they can save 2 seconds of travel time?

And yeah, you can claim this is a straw man...but I don't
believe it is. It is an example of what can happen.

Again, it seems to me that all the "sloth kills" and "krep"
terrorist want to simplfy everything down to one simple rule
- "stay the hell out of my way."

A good rule of thumb IMHO is that you should never cause another driver
to brake due to an action on your part.  I don't know about others but I
don't get all bent out of shape if that rule has to be bent slightly due
to big speed differentials, if the slower driver involved is passing
smartly and moves back over quickly (or is trying to execute a "jump
pass" to get around an exceptionally slow driver and accelerates with
authority, stuff like that.)  It's all in the attitude, really.  If it's
clear you're making an effort to play nice with others, I don't get
bent.  Drive like a dickhead, and I'll assume you're a dickhead (and
probably do whatever I can to get past and far away from you.)

I have to admit that LLBing is a big pet peeve of mine as here in MD
there is really no anti-LLBing law, and the habits of drivers here
certainly reflect it.  It's not uncommon to see a road at well below
capacity with a big clot of traffic caused by 3-4 cars abreast all
pacing each other, with lots of wide open space ahead (and a whole mess
of drivers behind all trying to guess who's going to pull ahead/drop
back enough to allow a quick lane change to get free of the whole mess.)
This behavior seems common in northern VA as well, at least around the
DC area.  IMHO a lot of the notorious traffic issues could be solved
around here by a) enacting (in MD) and enforcing (everywhere) a true
anti-LLBing law and b) teaching people how to use acceleration and
deceleration ramps properly.  There seem to be a lot of self-centered
people on the roads around here who think that as long as they aren't
breaking any actual laws that their driving is just fine - whether
they're LLBing, merging onto a nominally 65 MPH freeway at 45 MPH (and
sometimes diving into the passing lane before getting up to speed,)
braking before entering a deceleration ramp, whatever.  Sadly, this
inevitably leads to more laws, when people can't be trusted to act right
on their own...

OK so the law that clearly states that you don't have the right of way,

What is this nonsense about "supposedly legal speed"? A driver that is
breaking the sped limit is traveling at an illegal speed. 46.2-823 was
written to clarify just this point. In other words a driver obeying the law
is not required to change lanes so you can break it. Nor is he/she required

Virginia has several metropolitan areas. Richmond, Hampton roads ect.
Actually the laws are more written for some of them. The best example is
Portsmouth. They have an interstate highway that is about 14 miles long. it
has  about 20 exits in that stretch of road. Most of the exits are on the
right. That means traffic on the right is constantly speeding up and slowing
down, to allow people to enter and exit the highway. Now if someone chooses
to obey the speed limit, why should we punish them and force them to deal
with all that, when they can just stay in the left lane and go as fast as
the law permits?  Never mind the fact that allowing them to stay to the left
reduces traffic at the merge points. Also if you read the laws on passing it
says, a driver should move to the right to allow another vehicle to pass,
except when passing on the right is allowed. Which just happens to be
another example of KRETP not being part of the COV.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Bullshit...IF that were true then you would understand the law.

&gt;&gt; You think cops understand the laws they are supposed to enforce???

&gt;&gt; ROFLMAO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   -Dave

&gt; A Supreme Court Justice once warned that the last person to seek legal
&gt; advice from would be an LEO. They enforce laws based on how they are
&gt; told the laws were interpreted. They don't have the background to
&gt; interpret statutes. That's what lawyers and judges do. And I can assure
&gt; you that I know several cops personal who are dead certain about some
&gt; laws and are flat out wrong about them. That doesn't prevent them from
&gt; being highly passionate about their misunderstanding and extremely
&gt; dedicated to enforcing those laws based on their misunderstanding. After
&gt; all, that's how it was explained during the pre-shift briefing.

&gt; Most cops will give an answer to a legal question even without ever
&gt; being exposed to the correct answer. The perfect example was when one
&gt; state went to SSNs on the DL#. A few years later I thought I didn't care
&gt; for that, so went in to request that it be put back to the original
&gt; number. The cop flat out told me it couldn't be done as it was
&gt; &quot;illegal&quot;. I went around him to another facility higher in the chain and
&gt; a clerk processed the request without batting an eye.

&gt; BATF agents (and we know how they are in the food chain compared to an
&gt; LEO) have been documented as intentionally give wrong advise to FFL
&gt; dealerships. They'd log the contact and then use the situation to go to
&gt; an on-site inspection so they knew they'd help their enforcement
&gt; statistics without increasing their risk.

&gt; Don't seek and don't expect substantive legal advice from a cop.
">

And to top it off, how many times have you seen a cop actually drive
"illegally" on the road?  You'd be surprised at how many cops I've seen
don't have their headlights on in the rain, or run through red lights
like any other driver, or all the other things you're often told not to do.

My point, though, is that many of the laws and rules of the road are
either counter-productive, not enforced, or just generally misunderstood
(if they're known about at all).  Cops should enforce safety, rather
than laws.

Better drivers come about from better driver's training, and not
"better" laws.  If the legal speed limit for highways was reduced to 25,
you'd still have plenty of accidents from people doing stupid things.
The only "laws" that should exist are those which aide in traffic flow;
either for safety, or for efficiency.

Connecticut, actually.  And while what you describe works perfectly on

&gt;&gt;If I notice someone getting close to me, as soon as I see an opening I can
&gt;&gt;pull into towards the right, I will until that driver passes me.  If I
&gt;&gt;still want to pass more cars, I go in the left lane as if I were just
&gt;&gt;pulling into that lane for the first time.

&gt; The above doesn't make sense. In most states it is illegal to pass a car
&gt; while being passed. That doesn't exactly cover what (I think) you discribed
&gt; but it comes real close.
">

My point is, if you're in the left lane and a faster car is behind you,
you should pull into the right lane to let them pass.  This doesn't
necessarily mean that you are "passing" another car, as the right lane
may just be empty.  And if you're already in the left lane, there isn't
anywhere to go for the other driver to pass you, unless it's to the right.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;Also, cruise control...  I think part of the problem is that people who
&gt;&gt;use cruise control in the left lane (and are going faster than those in
&gt;&gt;the right lane(s)) don't understand that they can just step on the gas to
&gt;&gt;temporarily go faster to get around people so that they can yield to
&gt;&gt;faster drivers behind them in the left lane.

&gt; Scary. Uhh I can't work my cruise control, but I am such a good driver the
&gt; speed limit doesn't apply to me : )
">

More generally, using cruise control doesn't mean you have to keep it on
all the time and not manually vary your speed if and when it is
necessary.  But actually, most car manuals will say that you can step on
the gas with cruise control on for a temporary increase in your speed...

&gt; A good rule of thumb IMHO is that you should never cause another driver
&gt; to brake due to an action on your part.  I don't know about others but I
&gt; don't get all bent out of shape if that rule has to be bent slightly due
&gt; to big speed differentials, if the slower driver involved is passing
&gt; smartly and moves back over quickly (or is trying to execute a &quot;jump
&gt; pass&quot; to get around an exceptionally slow driver and accelerates with
&gt; authority, stuff like that.)  It's all in the attitude, really.  If it's
&gt; clear you're making an effort to play nice with others, I don't get
&gt; bent.  Drive like a dickhead, and I'll assume you're a dickhead (and
&gt; probably do whatever I can to get past and far away from you.)

&gt; I have to admit that LLBing is a big pet peeve of mine as here in MD
&gt; there is really no anti-LLBing law, and the habits of drivers here
&gt; certainly reflect it.  It's not uncommon to see a road at well below
&gt; capacity with a big clot of traffic caused by 3-4 cars abreast all
&gt; pacing each other, with lots of wide open space ahead (and a whole mess
&gt; of drivers behind all trying to guess who's going to pull ahead/drop
&gt; back enough to allow a quick lane change to get free of the whole mess.)
&gt;  This behavior seems common in northern VA as well, at least around the
&gt; DC area.  IMHO a lot of the notorious traffic issues could be solved
&gt; around here by a) enacting (in MD) and enforcing (everywhere) a true
&gt; anti-LLBing law and b) teaching people how to use acceleration and
&gt; deceleration ramps properly.  There seem to be a lot of self-centered
&gt; people on the roads around here who think that as long as they aren't
&gt; breaking any actual laws that their driving is just fine - whether
&gt; they're LLBing, merging onto a nominally 65 MPH freeway at 45 MPH (and
&gt; sometimes diving into the passing lane before getting up to speed,)
&gt; braking before entering a deceleration ramp, whatever.  Sadly, this
&gt; inevitably leads to more laws, when people can't be trusted to act right
&gt; on their own...

&gt; nate
">

It's not just in VA; there are countless times when two, three,
sometimes even *four* lanes have been blocked with wide-open space ahead
because everyone is going at the same speed.  I hate running at
*exactly* the same speed as the car(s) next to me, because 1) if they're
parallel to you, you may not see them well, 2) if one of them has to
swerve (or switches lanes in general) quickly, they're likely to hit me,
3) it actually becomes distracting, and 4) I [perhaps irrationally]
worry that if I happen to do something to "offend" them, they can easily
whip out a gun and shoot me.

Oh, and let's not even discuss people who take years to get up to
traffic speed from an onramp.  On-ramp merges are clear indications
where going below the flow of traffic--be it at the legal speed, or
above, or below it--is far more dangerous than not following the posted
speed limit.  Many times I've been starting to accelerate to get up to
speed with the other cars and find I have to stop short of the driver in
front of me who still isn't even up to 45 on a 65mph-limit highway.

That's why the right lane isn't supposed to be used as a passing lane.

I did not say that. In fact, I think common courtsey is the main reason KREP
laws are obeyed. I believe the intent of the law is clear, but not what
actually constitutes a violation. I also believe the Pa fine (if it as as
Mike claims) is excessive for a relatively minor traffic offense,
particaulry since I think it is difficult to prove, or fairly enforce the
law. I could see pulling over someone driving in the left lane for an
extended period if they were holding up a line of cars. I can't see pulling
over some little old lady doing 55 in a 65 for driving in the left lane of a
lightly travelled road. I would hope the police would use discression in
applying the law, but I unfortuantely have had enough bad experiences with
traffic enforcement to know that they don't always treat the public in a
fair and reasonable manner.

What does this have to do with the subject at hand? After you read up on
straw man arguments, do a little research on "non sequitur."

To make my position clear - I DO NOT advocate left lane blocking. I believe
people should drive in a reasonable, safe, and courteous manner. I don't
have any intention trying to enforce speed limits. However, I do not believe
any of the KREP or slower traffic keep right rules give people the right to
harass other drivers who are making a pass in a safe and legal manner. No
state has a law that requires a driver to exceed the speed limit in order to
complete a pass faster just so a rude driver doesn't have to slow down for a
few seconds. If KREP fanatics want other drivers to be courteous and get out
of the way, they should be courteous as well and allow others a reasonable
period of time to do so. Drivers who are not courteous have no right to
expect courtesy in return. I also think it is hypocrisy for KREP right
fanatics to demand that we "ticket left lane hogs" while many of them
routinely exceed the speed limits by 5, 10, or even 20 miles per hour. Would
KREP fanatics be happy if the police started strictly enforcing speed limits
and KREP rules?

Absolutely!  Not only would people get ticketed for blocking the passing
lane, but the fact that 100% of the drivers on the roads that I normally
drive would receive speeding tickets would cause the speeding ticket
racket to be exposed for the farce that it is and hopefully force some
positive change.

So, are you going to violate the maximum speed limit, tailgate, and
annoy law-abiding drivers legally cruising at the speed limit, just
because there's a lack of enforcement?

Of course you are, you've been doing that forever, and you're going to
continue to rationalize your self-absorbed misbehavior, hiding behind
specious arguments about "common courtesy", which, to you, is going
along with mob behavior anytime a Person In Authority isn't watching
you...

I challenge anybody reading this thread to go to their state's vehicle
code, and search it for for the terms "common courtesy", "courtesy", or
"courteous"...

I just did that in the California Vehicle Code at
http://www.dmv.ca.gov/pubs/vctop/vc/vctoc.htm

The only references to "courtesy" concerned "courtesy lamps", a
"courtesy warning" for failure to appear, and tow truck driver
telephone "courtesy"...

In the state of California at least, "common courtesy" is NOT a part of
the rules of the road. The rule of the road is the rule of whatever law
tells you how to drive under any given set of circumstances...

Sure, anybody can point to an instance where somebody gave up his right
of way in order to avoid getting hit by a scofflaw and maybe that would
be described as "common courtesy". But it's really *common sense* to
hang back to avoid being clobbered by a nutcase speeder with a
psychosocial adaptive disorder...

The highway isn't some kind of "democracy" or hippy commune or
kindergarten where everybody gets a vote over whether to have jello or
tapioca pudding for dessert. The highway is serious business for
psychosocially adjusted adults, not a playpen for oversized kids who
never learned the basic lessons of kindergarten: Stay In Line, Share,
Wait Your Turn...

No, there's no room for democracy on the highway. You didn't get a vote
when any given traffic law was written by your state legislator, and
you sure as hell don't get a vote out there on the highway, you do what
you're told to do, or the officer who sees you cites you and you can
rant and rave all you want to the judge about this fantasy of
"courtesy" and he will go right ahead and convict you of whatever you
did and fine you for it...

Go ahead, stand in front of the judge and say, "B-b-b-but, *everybody*
was driving 85 miles per hour, Your Honor! Wh-wh-wh-why did that mean
old cop pick me out and write *me* a ticket? Everybody was doing it! I
didn't want to speed! That old guy in the Buick in the left lane made
me do it! Why don't you give him a ticket&gt; I hate you! You're mean!

No, because the problem will affect the bypass as well.  Patients need
to follow a strict diet and excercise regimen after such surgery to
lower the likelihood of recurrence.

Similarly, drivers need to KRETP to maximize traffic flow by allow
faster traffic to efficiently flow around slower traffic (increasing
throughput).

&gt;&gt;&gt;A better method is to look at distance over time.  If a car behind you in
&gt;&gt;&gt;the left lane is closing on you, and then eventually reaches you and
&gt;&gt;&gt;needs to slow down to not hit you, if you had time anywhere up to the
&gt;&gt;&gt;point the guy is right behind you (or it soon opens up), and you don't
&gt;&gt;&gt;pull to the right, you are lane blocking.

&gt;&gt; Are you the one from Texas? In Virginia we have exactly the opposite for
&gt;&gt; law. If you are in the left lane going 55 mph (speed limit) and someone
&gt;&gt; is coming up behind you. It is the responsibility of the overtaking
&gt;&gt; vehicle to change lanes. That part really confuses people from other
&gt;&gt; states.

&gt; Connecticut, actually.  And while what you describe works perfectly on the
&gt; race track, KRETP works better in everyday traffic flow.  If you have
&gt; people weaving left and right to get around other cars, it impedes traffic
&gt; flow and makes your intentions less predictable to other drivers.
">

If you think about it, the way we do it makes perfect sense. If driver A is
in the left lane going as fast as the law allows. Driver B is going 10 MPH
faster, because he is so cool the speed limit is irelavant. Shouldn't it be
driver B's responsiblity to pass driver A? Just to be clear I am talking
about on a multi lane highway where passing on the right is legal..

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;It's really as simple as this:  You can stay in the left lane as long as
&gt;&gt;&gt;you want, as long as the lanes to the right of you aren't, in general,
&gt;&gt;&gt;passing you, or there isn't someone behind you in the left lane who was
&gt;&gt;&gt;clearly going faster than you before they reached you.  As soon as it's
&gt;&gt;&gt;clear the driver behind you wants to go faster than you, you pull to the
&gt;&gt;&gt;right as soon as safely possible.

&gt;&gt;&gt;I think what a lot of people are doing wrong is that they assume just
&gt;&gt;&gt;because you pull to the right, doesn't mean you can't immediately go back
&gt;&gt;&gt;in the left lane once the faster driver(s) pass you.  I do it all the
&gt;&gt;&gt;time; if I see a long line of cars in the non-left-lane I'm in that I
&gt;&gt;&gt;want to pass, I'll pull into the left lane and try to pass them all at
&gt;&gt;&gt;once. If I notice someone getting close to me, as soon as I see an
&gt;&gt;&gt;opening I can pull into towards the right, I will until that driver
&gt;&gt;&gt;passes me.  If I still want to pass more cars, I go in the left lane as
&gt;&gt;&gt;if I were just pulling into that lane for the first time.

&gt;&gt; The above doesn't make sense. In most states it is illegal to pass a car
&gt;&gt; while being passed. That doesn't exactly cover what (I think) you
&gt;&gt; discribed but it comes real close.

&gt; My point is, if you're in the left lane and a faster car is behind you,
&gt; you should pull into the right lane to let them pass.  This doesn't
&gt; necessarily mean that you are &quot;passing&quot; another car, as the right lane may
&gt; just be empty.  And if you're already in the left lane, there isn't
&gt; anywhere to go for the other driver to pass you, unless it's to the right.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Also, cruise control...  I think part of the problem is that people who

&gt;&gt;&gt;temporarily go faster to get around people so that they can yield to
&gt;&gt;&gt;faster drivers behind them in the left lane.

&gt;&gt; Scary. Uhh I can't work my cruise control, but I am such a good driver
&gt;&gt; the speed limit doesn't apply to me : )

&gt; More generally, using cruise control doesn't mean you have to keep it on
&gt; all the time and not manually vary your speed if and when it is necessary.

&gt; &gt;&gt; the law they did. See 46.2-823

&gt; &gt; All that says is that &quot;The driver of any vehicle traveling at an
&gt; &gt; unlawful speed shall forfeit any right-of-way which he might otherwise

&gt; &gt; at a supposedly legal speed) from your responsibility to obey the other
&gt; &gt; two sections above - it just means that the faster driver does not have
&gt; &gt; the legal right to expect you to move out of his way (even though you
&gt; &gt; are still required to do so.)  A hair-splitting point, perhaps, but
&gt; &gt; there you have it.

&gt; OK so the law that clearly states that you don't have the right of way,
&gt; should be ignored. But the one that sort of , if you interpret one way,
&gt; almost says you have the right of way, is the only law to pay attention to.
&gt; What is this nonsense about &quot;supposedly legal speed&quot;? A driver that is
&gt; breaking the sped limit is traveling at an illegal speed. 46.2-823 was
&gt; written to clarify just this point. In other words a driver obeying the law
&gt; is not required to change lanes so you can break it. Nor is he/she required

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Simply not true. Virginia has no requirements for traveling in any

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; lanes,
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; but
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; there is no state wide law. The only exception is for vehicles
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; traveling
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; at
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; excessively slow speeds. By definition a vehicle traveling at the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; maximum
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; speed limit is not traveling at an excessively slow speed. A
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; vehicle
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; traveling at above the speed limit is not given any special right
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; of
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; ways.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; unsupported and untrue claim.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; http://leg1.state.va.us/cgi-bin/legp504.exe?000+cod+46.2-804

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; unless you're going to make the specious claim that the wording
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;normal
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; speed of traffic&quot; refers somehow to the speed limit?

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; The word Normal is something we could go on for days about. I'll just
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; say
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; what I usually tell anyone who uses it on a report that crosses my
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; desk.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Please define normal.

&gt;&gt; &gt; Most people understand the word &quot;normal;&quot; in other words, a
&gt;&gt; &gt; representative number for the speed of the main flow of traffic.

&gt;&gt; Yes but the word normal is not defined in the code. Therefore if you use
&gt;&gt; it,
&gt;&gt; any good defense attorney will ask you to define it in court. Than you
&gt;&gt; have
&gt;&gt; to prove why your definition is valid. Trust me it can get real ugly.

&gt; Doesn't seem like rocket science; if the word &quot;normal&quot; is not defined
&gt; in the code, pick the dictionary definition that best fits its usage.

&gt;&gt; &gt; Depending on how you interpret it, in this specific context it could
&gt;&gt; &gt; refer to the peak of the bell curve of speed distribution, or the 50th
&gt;&gt; &gt; percentile speed, but in either case it is entirely independent of the
&gt;&gt; &gt; speed limit.

&gt;&gt; Ok again we are in court now. how are you going to prove that one driver
&gt;&gt; was
&gt;&gt; going slower than fifty percent of the other drivers?

&gt; Um, you're putting yourself in the place of the cop justifying his
&gt; ticket on the stand; all you have to do is say so.  If you really want
&gt; to prove it to yourself, it's easy to see whether a car is passing more
&gt; cars than it's being passed by.  A typical LLBer is usually passing
&gt; nobody and being passed by everyone, making identification easy.

No I am trying to get you to do it. It is easy to see. try saying that to a
defense atorney.

&gt;&gt; &gt; No matter how you slice it, it is difficult to justify driving in the
&gt;&gt; &gt; left lane at the speed limit when other traffic wishes to pass, given
&gt;&gt; &gt; the above.

&gt;&gt; Ok now lets take one sencerio. You write the ticket (MVS) for going 55
&gt;&gt; MPH
&gt;&gt; in the left lane. three days later the same driver gets a ticket for
&gt;&gt; going
&gt;&gt; 70 mph in the left lane on the same road. He shows up in court with both
&gt;&gt; tickets. Now what are we going to do?

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; It is actually a clarification
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; (exception) to another law 46.2- 842.

&gt;&gt; &gt; Which also supports KRETP.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; As for writing the speed limit into
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the law they did. See 46.2-823

&gt;&gt; &gt; All that says is that &quot;The driver of any vehicle traveling at an
&gt;&gt; &gt; unlawful speed shall forfeit any right-of-way which he might otherwise
&gt;&gt; &gt; have under this article.&quot;  I don't see that as relieving you (driving
&gt;&gt; &gt; at a supposedly legal speed) from your responsibility to obey the other
&gt;&gt; &gt; two sections above - it just means that the faster driver does not have
&gt;&gt; &gt; the legal right to expect you to move out of his way (even though you
&gt;&gt; &gt; are still required to do so.)  A hair-splitting point, perhaps, but
&gt;&gt; &gt; there you have it.

&gt;&gt; OK so the law that clearly states that you don't have the right of way,
&gt;&gt; should be ignored. But the one that sort of , if you interpret one way,
&gt;&gt; almost says you have the right of way, is the only law to pay attention
&gt;&gt; to.
&gt;&gt; What is this nonsense about &quot;supposedly legal speed&quot;? A driver that is
&gt;&gt; breaking the sped limit is traveling at an illegal speed. 46.2-823 was
&gt;&gt; written to clarify just this point. In other words a driver obeying the
&gt;&gt; law
&gt;&gt; is not required to change lanes so you can break it. Nor is he/she
&gt;&gt; required
&gt;&gt; to move off the road on a two lane.

&gt; Just because the faster driver does not have the legal right of way
&gt; does not excuse the slower driver from his responsibility to drive in a
&gt; legal manner.
">

You missed the point. "right of way" is what requires one drive to let
another driver proceed instead of him/her. In other words when it says "
traffic going slower than normal must move to the right" that is granting
right of way to the other drivers.

&gt;&gt; &gt; normal travel speeds are often classified as &quot;reckless driving&quot; doesn't
&gt;&gt; &gt; warm the cockles of my heart much, either.

&gt;&gt; Nobody who is in the bussiness of enforceing the law, thinks normal and
&gt;&gt; reckless are the same thing.

&gt; Practically nobody does.  However, when you post a speed limit of 55

&gt;&gt;   The good news is, that
&gt;&gt; &gt; outside of the metro DC area, Virginia drivers generally understand the

&gt;&gt; Virginia has several metropolitan areas. Richmond, Hampton roads ect.
&gt;&gt; Actually the laws are more written for some of them. The best example is
&gt;&gt; Portsmouth. They have an interstate highway that is about 14 miles long.
&gt;&gt; it
&gt;&gt; has  about 20 exits in that stretch of road. Most of the exits are on the
&gt;&gt; right. That means traffic on the right is constantly speeding up and
&gt;&gt; slowing
&gt;&gt; down, to allow people to enter and exit the highway.

&gt; Didn't I say something about merging skills being piss poor around here
&gt; as well?

Don't even get me started. I think merging should be a required skill on the
road test. If you do it wrong you automatically fail.

&gt; Because then you've just created a one-lane highway.  Congratulations.

&gt;&gt; Never mind the fact that allowing them to stay to the left
&gt;&gt; reduces traffic at the merge points. Also if you read the laws on passing
&gt;&gt; it
&gt;&gt; says, a driver should move to the right to allow another vehicle to pass,
&gt;&gt; except when passing on the right is allowed.

&gt; Which is a really unfortunate phrase, obviously intended to allow
&gt; people to pass other drivers turning left or preparing for left exits,
&gt; not garden variety idiots just camping out in the passing lane.

No. What would it take to convince you that Virginia does not recognize the
left lane as a passing lane? Every single reference to the lack of the law
is rewritten in your mind to say something other than what it says.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; unless you're going to make the specious claim that the wording
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;normal
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; speed of traffic&quot; refers somehow to the speed limit?

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; The word Normal is something we could go on for days about. I'll just
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; say
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; what I usually tell anyone who uses it on a report that crosses my
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; desk.
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Please define normal.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Most people understand the word &quot;normal;&quot; in other words, a
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; representative number for the speed of the main flow of traffic.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Yes but the word normal is not defined in the code. Therefore if you use
&gt; &gt;&gt; it,
&gt; &gt;&gt; any good defense attorney will ask you to define it in court. Than you
&gt; &gt;&gt; have
&gt; &gt;&gt; to prove why your definition is valid. Trust me it can get real ugly.

&gt; &gt; Doesn't seem like rocket science; if the word &quot;normal&quot; is not defined
&gt; &gt; in the code, pick the dictionary definition that best fits its usage.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Depending on how you interpret it, in this specific context it could
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; refer to the peak of the bell curve of speed distribution, or the 50th
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; percentile speed, but in either case it is entirely independent of the
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; speed limit.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Ok again we are in court now. how are you going to prove that one driver
&gt; &gt;&gt; was
&gt; &gt;&gt; going slower than fifty percent of the other drivers?

&gt; &gt; Um, you're putting yourself in the place of the cop justifying his
&gt; &gt; ticket on the stand; all you have to do is say so.  If you really want
&gt; &gt; to prove it to yourself, it's easy to see whether a car is passing more
&gt; &gt; cars than it's being passed by.  A typical LLBer is usually passing
&gt; &gt; nobody and being passed by everyone, making identification easy.

&gt; No I am trying to get you to do it. It is easy to see. try saying that to a
&gt; defense atorney.

My point was, that at least in the traffic courts I've been to
(admittedly limited; my experience has been limited to two appearances
- for the same ticket - and not in VA) is that if the cop actually
shows up, his word carries a lot more weight than that of the defense.
Unless the defendant has a solid case (i.e. the cop screwed up) AND he
has a good lawyer, the cop's testimony is good enough.  Generally I
consider that a Bad Thing; but I certainly would never argue with a cop
who wrote a ticket for LLBing.

Normal simply equals normal, whether it be legal or illegal.

Now what I *do* have a problem with is the fact that we're still
saddled with 1960s era speed limits when obviously vehicle technology,
road design and construction, etc. have all progressed in the
intervening years and actual travel speeds have risen to reflect that
thus normal behavior is now defined as illegal.  However, that's an

Actually I follow *all* traffic laws, with the exception of speed
limits (when it is safe to break them.)  Only reason that I choose to
ignore the speed limit is that it is statistically safer to stick with
the flow of traffic rather than create speed differentials.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; It is actually a clarification
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; (exception) to another law 46.2- 842.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Which also supports KRETP.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; As for writing the speed limit into
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the law they did. See 46.2-823

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; All that says is that &quot;The driver of any vehicle traveling at an
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; unlawful speed shall forfeit any right-of-way which he might otherwise
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; have under this article.&quot;  I don't see that as relieving you (driving
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; at a supposedly legal speed) from your responsibility to obey the other
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; two sections above - it just means that the faster driver does not have
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; the legal right to expect you to move out of his way (even though you
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; are still required to do so.)  A hair-splitting point, perhaps, but
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; there you have it.

&gt; &gt;&gt; OK so the law that clearly states that you don't have the right of way,
&gt; &gt;&gt; should be ignored. But the one that sort of , if you interpret one way,
&gt; &gt;&gt; almost says you have the right of way, is the only law to pay attention
&gt; &gt;&gt; to.
&gt; &gt;&gt; What is this nonsense about &quot;supposedly legal speed&quot;? A driver that is
&gt; &gt;&gt; breaking the sped limit is traveling at an illegal speed. 46.2-823 was
&gt; &gt;&gt; written to clarify just this point. In other words a driver obeying the
&gt; &gt;&gt; law
&gt; &gt;&gt; is not required to change lanes so you can break it. Nor is he/she
&gt; &gt;&gt; required
&gt; &gt;&gt; to move off the road on a two lane.

&gt; &gt; Just because the faster driver does not have the legal right of way
&gt; &gt; does not excuse the slower driver from his responsibility to drive in a
&gt; &gt; legal manner.

&gt; You missed the point. &quot;right of way&quot; is what requires one drive to let
&gt; another driver proceed instead of him/her. In other words when it says &quot;
&gt; traffic going slower than normal must move to the right&quot; that is granting
&gt; right of way to the other drivers.
">

I would think that the slower driver is still not relieved of his
responsibilities; but that if an incident were to occur that the faster
driver would be found at fault due to not having the legal right of
way.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; normal travel speeds are often classified as &quot;reckless driving&quot; doesn't

&gt; &gt;&gt; Nobody who is in the bussiness of enforceing the law, thinks normal and

&gt; &gt; Practically nobody does.  However, when you post a speed limit of 55

&gt; Sometimes no matter what you do, you can cause a driver behind you to

&gt; the center lane (which I was in to avoid the long line of cars merging
&gt; in from I-295) to the right lane to take the Rte. 152 exit.  Some
&gt; weaver behind me managed to get from the far left to the far right

Only reason that happened is because the right lane was apparently
flowing faster than the lanes to the left; if KRETP were followed by
more drivers this wouldn't be the case.  Sounds like if the people
doing as you did (merging left to allow onramp traffic in) had moved
right as soon as they were clear that the weaver wouldn't have seen a
"hole" in which to attempt a pass.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;  That law is refering to congested roads.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; unsupported assertion.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; No actually it is part ofthe DCJS training criteria.

&gt;&gt; &gt; Still not written into the law.  That's someone's interpretation of the
&gt;&gt; &gt; law, not what the law says.  See, the neat thing about US laws is that
&gt;&gt; &gt; they've always been written in &quot;plain&quot; English so the lay person can
&gt;&gt; &gt; read and understand them.

&gt;&gt; It is writen into the code. It may not be included in that particular
&gt;&gt; line,
&gt;&gt; but it is in there. You can't just follow one law and ignore all the
&gt;&gt; others.

&gt; Actually I follow *all* traffic laws, with the exception of speed
&gt; limits (when it is safe to break them.)  Only reason that I choose to
&gt; ignore the speed limit is that it is statistically safer to stick with
&gt; the flow of traffic rather than create speed differentials.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; It is actually a clarification
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; (exception) to another law 46.2- 842.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Which also supports KRETP.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; As for writing the speed limit into
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the law they did. See 46.2-823

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; All that says is that &quot;The driver of any vehicle traveling at an
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; unlawful speed shall forfeit any right-of-way which he might
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; otherwise
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; have under this article.&quot;  I don't see that as relieving you
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; (driving
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; at a supposedly legal speed) from your responsibility to obey the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; other
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; two sections above - it just means that the faster driver does not
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; have
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; the legal right to expect you to move out of his way (even though
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; you
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; are still required to do so.)  A hair-splitting point, perhaps, but
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; there you have it.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; OK so the law that clearly states that you don't have the right of
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; way,
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; should be ignored. But the one that sort of , if you interpret one
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; way,
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; almost says you have the right of way, is the only law to pay
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; attention
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; to.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; What is this nonsense about &quot;supposedly legal speed&quot;? A driver that is
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; breaking the sped limit is traveling at an illegal speed. 46.2-823 was
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; written to clarify just this point. In other words a driver obeying
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; law
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; is not required to change lanes so you can break it. Nor is he/she
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; required
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; to move off the road on a two lane.

&gt;&gt; &gt; Just because the faster driver does not have the legal right of way
&gt;&gt; &gt; does not excuse the slower driver from his responsibility to drive in a
&gt;&gt; &gt; legal manner.

&gt;&gt; You missed the point. &quot;right of way&quot; is what requires one drive to let
&gt;&gt; another driver proceed instead of him/her. In other words when it says &quot;
&gt;&gt; traffic going slower than normal must move to the right&quot; that is granting
&gt;&gt; right of way to the other drivers.

&gt; I would think that the slower driver is still not relieved of his
&gt; responsibilities; but that if an incident were to occur that the faster
&gt; driver would be found at fault due to not having the legal right of
&gt; way.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I have to admit that I am not a big fan of the way Virginia's laws

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Simply not true. Virginia has no requirements for traveling in any

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; except on certain roads. Localities can pass laws that restrict
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; lanes,
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; but
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; there is no state wide law. The only exception is for vehicles
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; traveling
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; at
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; excessively slow speeds. By definition a vehicle traveling at the
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; maximum
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; speed limit is not traveling at an excessively slow speed. A
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; vehicle
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; traveling at above the speed limit is not given any special right
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; of
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; ways.

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; unsupported and untrue claim.

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; http://leg1.state.va.us/cgi-bin/legp504.exe?000+cod+46.2-804

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; unless you're going to make the specious claim that the wording
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;normal
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; speed of traffic&quot; refers somehow to the speed limit?

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; The word Normal is something we could go on for days about. I'll just
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; say
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; what I usually tell anyone who uses it on a report that crosses my
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; desk.
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Please define normal.

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Most people understand the word &quot;normal;&quot; in other words, a
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; representative number for the speed of the main flow of traffic.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Yes but the word normal is not defined in the code. Therefore if you use
&gt;&gt;&gt; it,
&gt;&gt;&gt; any good defense attorney will ask you to define it in court. Than you
&gt;&gt;&gt; have
&gt;&gt;&gt; to prove why your definition is valid. Trust me it can get real ugly.

&gt;&gt; Doesn't seem like rocket science; if the word &quot;normal&quot; is not defined
&gt;&gt; in the code, pick the dictionary definition that best fits its usage.

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Depending on how you interpret it, in this specific context it could
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; refer to the peak of the bell curve of speed distribution, or the 50th
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; percentile speed, but in either case it is entirely independent of the
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; speed limit.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Ok again we are in court now. how are you going to prove that one driver
&gt;&gt;&gt; was
&gt;&gt;&gt; going slower than fifty percent of the other drivers?

&gt;&gt; Um, you're putting yourself in the place of the cop justifying his
&gt;&gt; ticket on the stand; all you have to do is say so.  If you really want
&gt;&gt; to prove it to yourself, it's easy to see whether a car is passing more
&gt;&gt; cars than it's being passed by.  A typical LLBer is usually passing
&gt;&gt; nobody and being passed by everyone, making identification easy.

&gt; No I am trying to get you to do it. It is easy to see. try saying that to
&gt; a defense atorney.

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; No matter how you slice it, it is difficult to justify driving in the
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; left lane at the speed limit when other traffic wishes to pass, given
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; the above.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Ok now lets take one sencerio. You write the ticket (MVS) for going 55
&gt;&gt;&gt; MPH
&gt;&gt;&gt; in the left lane. three days later the same driver gets a ticket for
&gt;&gt;&gt; going
&gt;&gt;&gt; 70 mph in the left lane on the same road. He shows up in court with both
&gt;&gt;&gt; tickets. Now what are we going to do?

&gt;&gt; Evaluate each ticket on its own merits, of course.

&gt; Did you hear the woshing sound as that went over your head?

&gt;&gt;&gt; I've logged a few miles in Virginia; generally any
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; definition of &quot;normal&quot; is above the posted limit disregarding
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; especially congested areas like the DC Beltway and I-66 during rush
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; hour.

&gt;&gt;&gt; lol. If you going to appear in court and define normal as breaking the
&gt;&gt;&gt; law.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Could you please post the date and time so we can all watch.

&gt;&gt; Anyone with half an ounce of common sense can see that normal often is
&gt;&gt; in technical violation of the speed limit.

&gt; Are you serious? Do you really believe that the legislators meant to
&gt; define breaking the law as normal?

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Don't you think
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; that if they meant &quot;speed limit&quot; they would have written the words
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;speed limit&quot; into the law?

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;  That law is refering to congested roads.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Nobody who is in the bussiness of enforceing the law, thinks normal and
&gt;&gt;&gt; reckless are the same thing.

&gt;&gt; Practically nobody does.  However, when you post a speed limit of 55
&gt;&gt; MPH on a 75 MPH road, then define reckless as 20 over, that's what you
&gt;&gt; get.

&gt; I was discussing the law the way it is written. The above comment just
&gt; declares that you have no respect for it or concern about what it actually
&gt; says.

&gt;&gt;&gt;   The good news is, that
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; outside of the metro DC area, Virginia drivers generally understand
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; the
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; spirit of KRETP laws and drive in a sensible, considerate manner.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Virginia has several metropolitan areas. Richmond, Hampton roads ect.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Actually the laws are more written for some of them. The best example is
&gt;&gt;&gt; Portsmouth. They have an interstate highway that is about 14 miles long.
&gt;&gt;&gt; it
&gt;&gt;&gt; has  about 20 exits in that stretch of road. Most of the exits are on
&gt;&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt;&gt; right. That means traffic on the right is constantly speeding up and
&gt;&gt;&gt; slowing
&gt;&gt;&gt; down, to allow people to enter and exit the highway.

&gt;&gt; Didn't I say something about merging skills being piss poor around here
&gt;&gt; as well?

&gt; Don't even get me started. I think merging should be a required skill on
&gt; the road test. If you do it wrong you automatically fail.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Now if someone chooses
&gt;&gt;&gt; to obey the speed limit, why should we punish them and force them to
&gt;&gt;&gt; deal
&gt;&gt;&gt; with all that,

&gt;&gt; Shouldn't.  Ticket all the people who can't merge that are clogging up
&gt;&gt; the right lane.

&gt; Do you own a bulk printing business?

&gt;&gt;&gt; when they can just stay in the left lane and go as fast as
&gt;&gt;&gt; the law permits?

&gt;&gt; Because then you've just created a one-lane highway.  Congratulations.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Never mind the fact that allowing them to stay to the left
&gt;&gt;&gt; reduces traffic at the merge points. Also if you read the laws on
&gt;&gt;&gt; passing it
&gt;&gt;&gt; says, a driver should move to the right to allow another vehicle to
&gt;&gt;&gt; pass,
&gt;&gt;&gt; except when passing on the right is allowed.

&gt;&gt; Which is a really unfortunate phrase, obviously intended to allow
&gt;&gt; people to pass other drivers turning left or preparing for left exits,
&gt;&gt; not garden variety idiots just camping out in the passing lane.

&gt; No. What would it take to convince you that Virginia does not recognize
&gt; the left lane as a passing lane? Every single reference to the lack of the
&gt; law is rewritten in your mind to say something other than what it says.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Which just happens to be
&gt;&gt;&gt; another example of KRETP not being part of the COV.

&gt;&gt; Still not getting it, I see.  The fact that you are apparently a cop
&gt;&gt; explains that, however - you're told how to interpret the laws, not to
&gt;&gt; think for yourselves.  How unfortunate that is,

Normal behavior is typical behavior.  One cannot change the definition
of normal by making by enacting law that makes typical behavior illegal.

Let's say that the normal walking pace of an adult was 3.5 mph.  If a
law is enacted that specifies an absolute speed limit of 2 mph on
sidewalks, then a 3.5 mph walking pace does not automatically become
abnormal behavior.

Similarly, if posted limits were 70 mph on Virginia interstates (as they
were in 1972), and most traffic drove at 70 mph at that time, then
that's what normal speed was.  Driving at 70 mph did not suddenly become
abnormal behavior at the beginning of 1974 when the speed limit changed
to 55 mph.

&gt; &gt;&gt; No I am trying to get you to do it. It is easy to see. try saying that to
&gt; &gt;&gt; a
&gt; &gt;&gt; defense atorney.

&gt; &gt; My point was, that at least in the traffic courts I've been to
&gt; &gt; (admittedly limited; my experience has been limited to two appearances
&gt; &gt; - for the same ticket - and not in VA) is that if the cop actually
&gt; &gt; shows up, his word carries a lot more weight than that of the defense.
&gt; &gt; Unless the defendant has a solid case (i.e. the cop screwed up) AND he
&gt; &gt; has a good lawyer, the cop's testimony is good enough.  Generally I
&gt; &gt; consider that a Bad Thing; but I certainly would never argue with a cop
&gt; &gt; who wrote a ticket for LLBing.

&gt; You have a good point. Most of my court appearances have to do with felony
&gt; arrests. I am used to dealing with a very vicious breed of defense
&gt; attorney's.
">

That's a whole different animal.  Most traffic offenses are
non-criminal offenses therefore they fall under "preponderance of
evidence" rather than "reasonable doubt" and generally the testimony of
a LEO is considered to be evidence.  Now that is not 100% true across
the board...  IIRC some traffic offenses that are considered reckless
driving may actually be considered criminal offenses but I don't have
the code handy off the top of my head.  VA actually does consider quite
a few things reckless driving, 20 over being one (feh) and also failure
to signal (wish it were enforced!)

That said, a friend of mine received a reckless driving ticket for some
ludicrous speed in a 25 zone entering Dulles International Airport to
pick up his fiancee.  Despite having a good case (he was driving a
Toyota Camry; the speed he was accused of was something in the
neighborhood of 60 MPH and probably would have involved a four wheel
drift were he actually going that fast) and hiring a lawyer, he was
still found guilty.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Evaluate each ticket on its own merits, of course.

Then both tickets should hold up, although I'd consider writing someone
for 70 in a 55 to be fairly ticky-tacky in many places (ever drive on

driving (she's got a heavier foot than I, not to mention a faster car)
and we were regularly traveling at 80+ (well, except for several
incidents where rubberneckers watching someone change a tire or
rearrange their trunk caused massive backups...) and still being
passed.  Yes, the radar detector was safely stowed in the trunk, and I
did remind her about the 20 over thing several times.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; It is actually a clarification
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; (exception) to another law 46.2- 842.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Which also supports KRETP.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; As for writing the speed limit into
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the law they did. See 46.2-823

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; All that says is that &quot;The driver of any vehicle traveling at an
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; unlawful speed shall forfeit any right-of-way which he might
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; otherwise
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; have under this article.&quot;  I don't see that as relieving you
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; (driving
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; at a supposedly legal speed) from your responsibility to obey the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; other
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; two sections above - it just means that the faster driver does not
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; have
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; the legal right to expect you to move out of his way (even though
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; you
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; are still required to do so.)  A hair-splitting point, perhaps, but
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; there you have it.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; OK so the law that clearly states that you don't have the right of
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; way,
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; should be ignored. But the one that sort of , if you interpret one
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; way,
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; almost says you have the right of way, is the only law to pay
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; attention
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; to.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; What is this nonsense about &quot;supposedly legal speed&quot;? A driver that is
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; breaking the sped limit is traveling at an illegal speed. 46.2-823 was
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; written to clarify just this point. In other words a driver obeying
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; law
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; is not required to change lanes so you can break it. Nor is he/she
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; required
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; to move off the road on a two lane.

&gt;&gt; &gt; Just because the faster driver does not have the legal right of way
&gt;&gt; &gt; does not excuse the slower driver from his responsibility to drive in a
&gt;&gt; &gt; legal manner.

&gt;&gt; You missed the point. &quot;right of way&quot; is what requires one drive to let
&gt;&gt; another driver proceed instead of him/her. In other words when it says &quot;
&gt;&gt; traffic going slower than normal must move to the right&quot; that is granting
&gt;&gt; right of way to the other drivers.

&gt; I would think that the slower driver is still not relieved of his
&gt; responsibilities; but that if an incident were to occur that the faster
&gt; driver would be found at fault due to not having the legal right of
&gt; way.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I have to admit that I am not a big fan of the way Virginia's laws
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; are
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; written, as they do allow some room for misinterpretation by the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Claybrookian crowd, but that was the example given.  The fact that
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; normal travel speeds are often classified as &quot;reckless driving&quot;
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; doesn't
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; warm the cockles of my heart much, either.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Nobody who is in the bussiness of enforceing the law, thinks normal
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; and
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; reckless are the same thing.

&gt;&gt; &gt; Practically nobody does.  However, when you post a speed limit of 55
&gt;&gt; &gt; MPH on a 75 MPH road, then define reckless as 20 over, that's what you
&gt;&gt; &gt; get.

&gt;&gt; I was discussing the law the way it is written. The above comment just
&gt;&gt; declares that you have no respect for it or concern about what it
&gt;&gt; actually
&gt;&gt; says.

&gt; I'm personally less concerned with the law than I am about getting to
&gt; my destination in a safe, hassle-free manner.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;   The good news is, that
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; outside of the metro DC area, Virginia drivers generally understand
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; spirit of KRETP laws and drive in a sensible, considerate manner.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Virginia has several metropolitan areas. Richmond, Hampton roads ect.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Actually the laws are more written for some of them. The best example
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; is
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Portsmouth. They have an interstate highway that is about 14 miles
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; long.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; it
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; has  about 20 exits in that stretch of road. Most of the exits are on
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; right. That means traffic on the right is constantly speeding up and
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; slowing
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; down, to allow people to enter and exit the highway.

&gt;&gt; &gt; Didn't I say something about merging skills being piss poor around here
&gt;&gt; &gt; as well?

&gt;&gt; Don't even get me started. I think merging should be a required skill on
&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt; road test. If you do it wrong you automatically fail.

&gt; *high-fives* I am so with you there.

&gt; Speaking of which, why is it that I have not taken an in-car driver's
&gt; test since I was 16 years old, and yet have held valid driver's
&gt; licenses in at least five different states at various times?  Only
&gt; state that had any kind of test at all was Ohio, I had to retake the
&gt; written test when I moved there.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Now if someone chooses
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; to obey the speed limit, why should we punish them and force them to
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; deal
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; with all that,

&gt;&gt; &gt; Shouldn't.  Ticket all the people who can't merge that are clogging up
&gt;&gt; &gt; the right lane.

&gt;&gt; Do you own a bulk printing business?

&gt; I can start one if it looks like a money-making proposition. :)  If you

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Never mind the fact that allowing them to stay to the left
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; reduces traffic at the merge points. Also if you read the laws on
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; passing
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; it
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; says, a driver should move to the right to allow another vehicle to
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; pass,

&gt;&gt; &gt; people to pass other drivers turning left or preparing for left exits,
&gt;&gt; &gt; not garden variety idiots just camping out in the passing lane.

&gt;&gt; No. What would it take to convince you that Virginia does not recognize

I do not believe that. In some areas yes. In urban areas I think exactly the
opposite is true. Think of it this way. Driver A is going 55 MPH. He has to
stay in the right lane until he is a mile from his left exit. Than he has to
go 10 MPH faster than all the other cars in his lane. How do you do that?
Answer you slow down until you have enough space in front of you to speed up
ten miles per hour than change lanes. Now if everybody goes the same speed
and uses the lanes as they need to, traffic flows better. Sure some people
will not get to where they are going as fast, but the majority of people
will get there faster.

People come here because the weather is so mild, and there is economic
opportunity unparalleled in rural states. Your highways in rural states
are almost empty, so you can continue to drive in the antiquated "left
lane for passing only" mode. California cannot afford to have ten
thousand miles of left lane concrete sitting unused except by speeders,
the left lane is needed to move traffic at whatever speed it can move,
even if that speed is only 15 miles per hour...

California has something like 15 million vehicles driving on the
highways and freeways every day. We can't afford the luxury of
reserving the left lane for passing or making it into a private
racetrack for psychosocially-maladjusted drivers...

California tried setting up a diamond lane system to attract car
poolers to get together and reduce traffic congestion by having two or
three people in one car, leaving the other car in a special parking
lot...

The few car poolers that did use the diamond lane could
save several minutes over the rest of traffic that was jammed bumper to
bumper. But hardly anybody wanted to car pool in the diamond lane...

The drivers who did use the car pool lanes somehow got the crazy notion
that the car pool lane was their own private speedway, and they tried
to drive 80, 90, 100 mph in the car pool lane. The highway patrol had a
field day writing them $1000 tickets...

Now California highway engineers are going to convert the diamond lanes
back into a much-needed ordinary lane of travel. In the state of
California, all lanes of a multiple lane highway have the same speed
limit, you can pass on the left or pass on the right, whichever side is
open. And, if you're speeding when a cop sees you passing all the other
cars on the road, you'll be cited for speed...

In the state of California, law-abiding motorists occupying the left
hand lane do not have to move over for speeders. But there are a lot of
out of state speeder who do not understand California's rules of the
road...

And they get their chance to argue with the judge about their problems
with obedience to the traffic laws. The local courts just *love*
excessive speed citations. Whatever fine the California Vehicle Code
requires gets *tripled* by mandatory penalty assessments, and the
speeding scofflaw's hard-earned money goes to
support the entrenched bureaucracy that owns the highways...

The people of California do not own the roads, the government just lets
them *use* the roads, and the scofflaws who can't understand that fact
wind up paying huge fines for speeding, until they learn that they
cannot speed and get away with it for very long...

Driving 80+ in VA isn't a good idea unless you're using a RD.  The last
thing I would do is stow it in the trunk if I planned to drive that fast.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Never mind the fact that allowing them to stay to the left

&gt; I do not believe that. In some areas yes. In urban areas I think exactly the

&gt; stay in the right lane until he is a mile from his left exit.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Than he has to
&gt; go 10 MPH faster than all the other cars in his lane. How do you do that?
&gt; Answer you slow down until you have enough space in front of you to speed up
&gt; ten miles per hour than change lanes.
">

...for exactly that reason.  Right exits don't have this problem.  But
if he has to slow down to allow enough space to accelerate 10 MPH
before changing lanes, I'd posit that he was following the vehicle in
front of him to begin with, or else was driving a car that I wouldn't
want to drive!  (I mean, I drive a Porsche 944 - a slow, underpowered
beast if there ever was one - and I don't have these problems.  Of
course, I'm not afraid to use the entire travel of the little skinny
pedal on the right when required, either)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Now if everybody goes the same speed
&gt; and uses the lanes as they need to, traffic flows better. Sure some people

">

The whole concept of a left exit disrupts the natural stratification of
slower = right, faster = left and causes exactly the situation you
describe.  Above and beyond that, if all lanes are traveling at
*exactly* the same speed, that leaves the average driver with less
opportunities to change lanes as required, as it's easy to get "boxed
in."  I personally am a little nervous in traffic flows like that, as
I'm left with significantly fewer "outs" than I am if I'm passing or
being passed.  IOW, if I'm passing or being passed, should I need to
change lanes quickly, a "hole" will open to my left or right within a
second or two, no matter what.  If there's a car right next to me and
pacing me, that's suddenly eliminated 25% of my options for evasive
action (i.e. move left, move right, brake, or accelerate.)

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Never mind the fact that allowing them to stay to the left
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; reduces traffic at the merge points. Also if you read the laws on
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; passing
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; it
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; says, a driver should move to the right to allow another vehicle to
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; pass,
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; except when passing on the right is allowed.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Which is a really unfortunate phrase, obviously intended to allow
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; people to pass other drivers turning left or preparing for left
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; exits,
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; not garden variety idiots just camping out in the passing lane.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; No. What would it take to convince you that Virginia does not
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; recognize
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; left lane as a passing lane? Every single reference to the lack of the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; law
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; is rewritten in your mind to say something other than what it says.

&gt;&gt; &gt; A suspension of common sense and forgetting all knowledge about a) how
&gt;&gt; &gt; drivers have been traditionally trained to drive and b) the evolution
&gt;&gt; &gt; of driving-related laws in the US.

&gt;&gt; Common sense and the law are often two different animals.

&gt; Heh, too true!

&gt;&gt; I personally like
&gt;&gt; the laws the way  they are here. Obviously many people don't. There are
&gt;&gt; lots
&gt;&gt; of laws I would love to change. Unfortunately they don't let me do that.

&gt; You underestimate the weight that the word of a LEO carries.  If you
&gt; put together a professional-looking letter to appropriate legislators
&gt; you might be surprised at how much more consideration that gets than a
&gt; similar letter from Joe Public Citizen.  Of course, you have to be

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Still not getting it, I see.  The fact that you are apparently a cop
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; explains that, however - you're told how to interpret the laws, not
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; to

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Well you are way off. You obviously know very little about law

&gt;&gt; &gt; OK, my statement might have been a little harsh, but you have to admit
&gt;&gt; &gt; that your interpretation of the laws is heavily influenced by what your
&gt;&gt; &gt; training classes have taught you that the correct interpretation ought
&gt;&gt; &gt; to be.

&gt;&gt; Well we get our interpretations from the legislators. They are the ones

&gt; Actually, you get your interpretations from the *courts...*  it's their

A little of both. We get bulletins from the legislator when they write new
laws and rulings from the court when they correct them.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; &gt; Can we at least agree that KRETP is a good principle and is conducive
&gt;&gt; &gt; to faster yet safer traffic flow?

&gt;&gt; I do not believe that. In some areas yes. In urban areas I think exactly
&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt; opposite is true. Think of it this way. Driver A is going 55 MPH. He has
&gt;&gt; to
&gt;&gt; stay in the right lane until he is a mile from his left exit.

Yea but they are a big part of the highway system in Virginia.

&gt;&gt; Than he has to

&gt;&gt; Answer you slow down until you have enough space in front of you to speed
&gt;&gt; up
&gt;&gt; ten miles per hour than change lanes.

&gt; ...for exactly that reason.  Right exits don't have this problem.  But
&gt; if he has to slow down to allow enough space to accelerate 10 MPH
&gt; before changing lanes, I'd posit that he was following the vehicle in
&gt; front of him to begin with, or else was driving a car that I wouldn't
&gt; want to drive!  (I mean, I drive a Porsche 944 - a slow, underpowered
&gt; beast if there ever was one - and I don't have these problems.  Of
&gt; course, I'm not afraid to use the entire travel of the little skinny

&gt;&gt; Now if everybody goes the same speed
&gt;&gt; and uses the lanes as they need to, traffic flows better. Sure some
&gt;&gt; people
&gt;&gt; will not get to where they are going as fast, but the majority of people
&gt;&gt; will get there faster.

&gt; The whole concept of a left exit disrupts the natural stratification of
&gt; slower = right, faster = left and causes exactly the situation you
&gt; describe.  Above and beyond that, if all lanes are traveling at
&gt; *exactly* the same speed, that leaves the average driver with less
&gt; opportunities to change lanes as required, as it's easy to get &quot;boxed
&gt; in.&quot;  I personally am a little nervous in traffic flows like that, as
&gt; I'm left with significantly fewer &quot;outs&quot; than I am if I'm passing or
&gt; being passed.  IOW, if I'm passing or being passed, should I need to
&gt; change lanes quickly, a &quot;hole&quot; will open to my left or right within a
&gt; second or two, no matter what.  If there's a car right next to me and
&gt; pacing me, that's suddenly eliminated 25% of my options for evasive
&gt; action (i.e. move left, move right, brake, or accelerate.)

&gt;&gt; &gt; nate

&gt;&gt; &gt; PS - despite the fact that we're obviously miles off in our actual
&gt;&gt; &gt; opinions, I actually do appreciate the discussion.  It's nice to see a
&gt;&gt; &gt; LEO at least taking an interest in driving-related issues.

&gt;&gt; I spend a lot of time driving. One of the reasons this issue is so dear
&gt;&gt; to
&gt;&gt; me is, I usually have my partner sleeping in the back of my blazer.  I am
&gt;&gt; on
&gt;&gt; call most of the time so if I am in my POV and my dog is in back. I have
&gt;&gt; to
&gt;&gt; obey the speed limit. Believe it or not, we are not exempt from tickets
&gt;&gt; when
&gt;&gt; we are off duty.

&gt; I believe it legally but not in practice :(  I've seen plenty of
&gt; *marked* vehicles violating several traffic laws with apparent
&gt; impunity.

&gt;&gt; When I see someone tailgating because I am obeying the
&gt;&gt; speed limit, I start thinking of what it would mean to be rear-ended. It
&gt;&gt; takes several thousand hours and at least a year to train a dog. The idea
&gt;&gt; that mine would get injured because someone feels the need to go a little
&gt;&gt; faster just pisses me off no end.

&gt; KRETP solves that problem, if the following driver is sentient enough
&gt; to change lanes to the left (a big assumption, I know...)

&gt;&gt; &gt; PPS - this discussion is going to become much more relevant to me
&gt;&gt; &gt; personally in the near future, as it looks like I will be starting a
&gt;&gt; &gt; new position based in NoVA soon, and it will entail lots of
&gt;&gt; &gt; construction site visits...

&gt;&gt; No VA is a terrible place to drive. I would sugest you just skip the
&gt;&gt; drivers
&gt;&gt; manual and rent a copy of mad max : )

&gt; I was wondering if my new employer would let me use my dad's old
&gt; International Scout as a company vehicle; sadly it looks like I'll be
&gt; issued Vlad the Impala :(

&gt; In all seriousness, I find that the best vehicle around here is one as
&gt; small and nimble as possible, I prefer to use maneuverability to my
&gt; advantage rather than intimidation through size and mass as many
&gt; drivers seem to employ...  I've been living in this area (I'm now
&gt; working in MD near DC) off and on for about 6 years now and still
&gt; scratch my head on a regular basis at the actions of some of the
&gt; drivers...

Gardenman's rationalization is the mirror image. Va's KR law is hard to

Lawyers are meticulous when they draft laws and contracts.  If you've
ever read through a contract (such as an end user license agreement),
they take the time to define all important terms that are used in the
contract.  Some of those definitions should be obvious, but they still
explicitly defined.

Similarly, state code starts out with a set of definitions relevant to a
chapter (such as intersection, law enforcement officer, driver, vehicle,
etc.), though those definitions should be obvious to most people.

If normal was to be defined as legal, then it would have been stated at
the beginning of the chapter.  The fact is that normal is not defined by
any state code that I've read through (VA, WV, CO).

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; In fact they did in several
&gt; others laws, that apply to the same subject, add lines about legal speeds
&gt; and complying with the law.

From what I read, legal and normal are never used in the same sentence
or particular statute.  For instance, they don't state that someone
proceeding at the normal and legal speed of traffic.

If one were to reword the law to state:

Any vehicle proceeding at less than the maximum legal speed of traffic
when no such condition requiring lower speeds exists, then that vehicle
must...

or if they explicitly defined normal as legal, then I would see your
point.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;Similarly, if posted limits were 70 mph on Virginia interstates (as they
&gt;&gt;were in 1972), and most traffic drove at 70 mph at that time, then that's
&gt;&gt;what normal speed was.  Driving at 70 mph did not suddenly become abnormal
&gt;&gt;behavior at the beginning of 1974 when the speed limit changed to 55 mph.
&gt; Now you are comparing apples to ball bearings. Cars don't just naturally go
&gt; 70 mph. I could see your argument being used to lower the minimum speed
&gt; limit to what cars normally idle at. But even that would be a stretch.
">

We're talking about drivers choosing speeds, not cars.  Speed limits are
determined, in part, by the speed most drivers travel at or under.
Therefore, they're supposed to be based on the normal behavior of
drivers with regards to choosing their cruising speed.

Therefore, if drivers typically drove 70 mph on Virginia interstates in
1972, then the normal speed of traffic on an interstate in Virginia at
that time was 70 mph.  That doesn't mean that the behavior suddenly
became abnormal at the beginning of 1974 when the maximum legal speed
limit was changed to 55 mph.

You probably live in a rural area that has obsolete laws and you want
to impose obsolete German traffic laws on other people, when you don't
understand the nature of the problem of moving massive amounts of
vehicular traffic. You just don't have the vehicular traffic in Florida
that we have here...

The Law of the Jungle does prevail on California highways, just as it
does on Florida highways. I've driven around Miami and Orlando and some
of those people are absolutely CRAZY. Some self-absorbed assholes will
drive 20 mph over the speed limit and they will almost run into the
back of a car ahead of them who is legally completing a passing
maneuver. People with big expensive cars think they have the right to
do as they please, regardless of the state they drive in...

I don't think for a second that I "own" the road, and driving at the
speed limit on a California highway is the limit of the "courtesy" I
will grant to overtaking speeders. If they had any courtesy at all,
they wouldn't be overtaking law-abiding drivers and expecting them to
just get out of the way so they can continue to overtake one
law-abiding driver after another and attempt to intimidate them...

Out on the wide open EMPTY interstate, between large metropolitan
areas, it's no problem to move over and drive in the right hand lanes
and let the self-absorbed assholes drive 100 mph in the left lane. They
may honk their horns and flash their lights when they overtake somebody
driving the legal speed limit in the left lane. I will honk my horn and
flash my lights when I see such a speeder pulled over by a California
Highway Patrol cruiser. I wish I could listen to their whining when
they go before a judge...

In California, the left lane is no different than any other lane, it's
NOT a passing lane or private racetrack for speed demons. Passing is
allowed on the left side or the right side, if there is room for a safe
pass...

Nevertheless, there is NO REASON for anything but an emergency vehicle
to be passing all other traffic that is proceeding at the legal maximum
speed limit. And the drivers of emergency vehicles usually do not
exceed the speed limit, either. The intent of the driver of the
emergency vehicle isn't to speed to the site of the emergency, his
intent is to arrive there without causing another accident. The
emergency vehicle's red lights and siren warn other drivers that the
ambulance or fire engine is coming, and that they should get out of the
way, but, in California there's usually no place for ordinary traffic
to go. Drivers on California freeways usually won't even STOP for an
emergency vehicle, as it might cause a massive pileup accident...

There is only one law in the California Vehicle Code that requires me
to get over and let speeders pass on a multilane highway. That's when
weather or road conditions are so bad that the prima facie safe speed
is reduced and I see the need to drive slower than the maximum speed
limit but the fools behind me can't see the need to slow down...

Then I have to move over and let the fools drive on to their doom. We
have
thick tule fog and blowing dust on multilane interstate highways in the
central valley, and the fools will try to drive 80 or 90 miles per hour
in the fog and dust and they get into 100 car accidents out there in
the tules. Fortunately, I don't have to commute through the fog and

You've jumped to the conclusion that I am a left lane blocker. I'm not.
I'm not "playing cop", or "playing judge". I'm telling you what's
happening here. When traffic piles up on the freeways during rush hour
and there's a line of bumper to bumper cars stretching from horizon to
horizon going 15 to 35 mph, I use the left lane because it's just a
hair faster than the other three lanes. And I hope that traffic will
get up to 65 mph, which it does, for short distances, before coming to
a complete stop...

Typing to NG's gives many cubicle workers something to do while they
wait for a layoff to emerge out of the chaos of mismanagement. Then
they re-invent themselves and jump into a new pool of chaos. It's the

It reminds me of a dialog in the movie NETWORK...

Mad As Hell
written by Paddy Chayefsky

Howard: I don't have to tell you things are bad. Everybody knows things
are bad. It's a depression. Everybody's out of work or scared of losing
their job. The dollar buys a nickel's worth. Banks are going bust.
Shopkeepers keep a gun under the counter. Punks are running wild in the
street and there's no one anywhere that seems to know what to do with
us. Now into it. We know the air is unfit to breathe, our food is unfit
to eat, and we sit watching our TVs while some local newscaster tells
us that today we had 15 homicides and 63 violent crimes as if that's
the way it's supposed to be. We know things are bad. Worse than bad.
They're crazy. It's like everything everywhere is going crazy so we
don't go out anymore. We sit in a house as slowly the world we're
living in is getting smaller and all we say is, "Please, at least leave
us alone in our living rooms. Let me have my toaster, and TV, and my
steel belted radials and I won't say anything." Well I'm not going to
leave you alone. I want you to get mad. I don't want you to protest. I
don't want you to riot. I don't want you to write to your congressman
because I wouldn't know what to tell you to write. I don't know what to
do about the depression and the inflation and the Russians and the
crying in the streets. All I know is first you've got to get mad.
You've got to say, "I'm a human being. God Dammit, my life has value."
So, I want you to get up now. I want all of you to get up out of your
chairs. I want you to get up right now and go to the window, open it,
and stick your head out, and yell, "I'm as mad as hell, and I'm not
going to take this anymore!" I want you to get up right now. Get up. Go
to your windows, open your windows, and stick your head out, and yell,
"I'm as mad as hell and I'm not going to take this anymore!" Things
have got to change my friends. You've got to get mad. You've got to
say, "I'm as mad as hell and I'm not going to take this anymore!" Then
we'll figure out what to do about the depression and the inflation and
the oil crisis. But first get up out of your chairs, open your window,
stick your head out and yell, "I'm as mad as hell and I'm not going to
take this anymore!"

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;A good rule of thumb IMHO is that you should never cause another driver
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;to brake due to an action on your part.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Sometimes no matter what you do, you can cause a driver behind you to
&gt; &gt;&gt; brake.  Case in point:  On I-95 N in Attleboro, Mass., I moved from
&gt; &gt;&gt; the center lane (which I was in to avoid the long line of cars merging
&gt; &gt;&gt; in from I-295) to the right lane to take the Rte. 152 exit.  Some
&gt; &gt;&gt; weaver behind me managed to get from the far left to the far right
&gt; &gt;&gt; lane just as I moved over to take the exit.  He slammed on his brakes
&gt; &gt;&gt; hard (front end dipping down), blasted his horn, and used his hand
&gt; &gt;&gt; signals.

&gt; &gt; Only reason that happened is because the right lane was apparently
&gt; &gt; flowing faster than the lanes to the left; if KRETP were followed by
&gt; &gt; more drivers this wouldn't be the case.  Sounds like if the people
&gt; &gt; doing as you did (merging left to allow onramp traffic in) had moved
&gt; &gt; right as soon as they were clear that the weaver wouldn't have seen a
&gt; &gt; &quot;hole&quot; in which to attempt a pass.

&gt; No instead you would have had dozens of cars changeing lanes for no real
&gt; reason.
">

a) I'm not convinced of the necessity to move over to let traffic merge
in.  If the merging driver has a Clue(tm) a simple lift of the
accelerator to open up a slightly larger gap in front of you should be
the maximum that would ever be necessary.  Sadly, the presence of a
Clue(tm) cannot always be safely assumed.

b) Assuming for the sake of argument that dozens of cars *did* move
left to allow merging traffic in, were KRETP understood and followed by
a majority of drivers, the lane changes would not be without reason,
and would be anticipated by all concerned.

depths of their hearts more easily deceived than they are consciously

them more easily prey to a big lie then a small one, for they
themselves often tell little lies but would be ashamed to tell a big

it intends to direct itself. What luck for cunning liars that most men
do not think. The art of lying consists in inflaming the attention of
the audience against a single adversary and taking care that nothing
will split up that attention. A liar of genius must have the ability to
make different opponents appear as if they belonged to one category.

The enemy is the Left Lane Hog and we must destroy them utterly and
restore Law and Order to our highways! And we must begin by disposing
of Jeb Bush! He is the Root of All Evil (well, at least in Florida,
where Donkey Hotay drives).

Now let us go forth, comrades, and set out upon the highways of this
great land, overtaking all slower left lane traffic, passing them and
peering into the faces of those benighted left lane blockers and
identifying which one actually is the Evil Jeb Bush, and crush him into

True but they did make sure to explain that all right of ways are canceled

true all the other statutes have wording about legal speeds or complying
with the law. The problem arises from the fact that they were trying to deal
with traffic jams. They didn't want to create a situation where everybody

&gt;&gt; Now you are comparing apples to ball bearings. Cars don't just naturally

&gt; We're talking about drivers choosing speeds, not cars.  Speed limits are

Here is an interesting article on the subject (from
http://www.nationmaster.com/encyclopedia/Road-transport )

"Interstate Highway System

"By 1956, most limited access highways in the eastern United
States were toll roads. In that year, the federal Interstate
highway program was established, funding non-toll roads with
90% federal dollars and 10% state match, giving little
incentive for states to expand their turnpike system.
Funding rules initially restricted collections of tolls on
newly funded roadways, bridges, and tunnels. In some
situations, expansion or rebuilding of a toll facility using
Interstate Highway Program funding resulted in the removal
of existing tolls. This occurred in Virginia on Interstate
64 at the Hampton Roads Bridge-Tunnel when a second parallel
roadway to the regional 1958 bridge-tunnel was completed in
1976.

"Since the completion of the initial portion of the
interstate highway system, regulations were changed, and
portions of toll facilities have been added to the system.
Some states are again looking at toll financing for new
roads and maintenance, to supplement limited federal
funding. In some areas, new road projects have been
completed with public-private partnerships funded by tolls,
such as the Pocahontas Parkway near Richmond, Virginia,
which features a costly high level bridge over the shipping
channel of the James River and connects Interstate 95 with
Interstate 295 to the south of the city."

And if you are worried about the spread of tolls on
Interstates, read
http://www.georgiatolls.com/SRTAExternal/eclips/04_2005/20050429%20e-...

"WASHINGTON -- A provision in the $284 billion highway bill
under consideration on Capitol Hill could open the way for
more tolls on the nation's congested interstates, marking a
departure from long-standing federal highway policy that has
traditionally frowned on collecting tolls to pay for roads
built with federal tax dollars.

"Under the transportation bill passed by the House of
Representatives last month, states would be allowed to
convert overall up to 25 segments of the interstate highway
system into toll roads over the next six years. The Senate
is expected to vote on similar legislation this month.

"The proposals, backed by the Bush administration, would
''greatly expand state tolling authority" over roads that
were constructed with federal dollars, said Darrin Roth, the
director of highway operations for the American Trucking
Association, which opposes the changes."

No. It makes more sense for every driver to stay right except to pass.
If a person, whose speedometer is incorrect and reads the legal limit,
but is doing 5mph less than the legal limit, is sitting in the fast
lane and someone comes up behind him doing the legal limit, you would
force the passing driver to weave around into a lane with even slower

&gt; &gt; As I have pointed out numerous times, KREP laws, when they

&gt; &gt; even when the road is posted &quot;slower traffic keep right.&quot;

&gt; &gt; Ed

&gt; So what's the sign for then?  -Dave
">

I am not sure, the law as currently written is confusing.
Here is the section defining what the sign means:

(e)       Notwithstanding any other provisions of this
section, when appropriate signs have been posted, it shall
be unlawful for any person to operate a motor vehicle over
and upon the inside lane, next to the median of any
dual-lane highway at a speed less than the posted speed
limit when the operation of said motor vehicle over and upon
said inside lane shall impede the steady flow of traffic
except when preparing for a left turn. "Appropriate signs"
as used herein shall be construed as including "Slower
Traffic Keep Right" or designations of similar import."

However, if you read all the section, it seems the signs are
superfluous, since another section said you should keep
right if you are doing lees than the speed limit. Here is
that section:

"b)       Upon all highways any vehicle proceeding at less
than the legal maximum speed limit shall be driven in the
right-hand lane then available for thru traffic, or as close
as practicable to the right-hand curb or edge of the
highway, except when overtaking and passing another vehicle
proceeding in the same direction or when preparing for a
left turn."

At least as I read it, Section b already requires vehicle
driving at less than the posted limit to keep right. Section
e just repeats this rule and adds the mention of a sign and
the word "unlawful." Not sure why this was done. It may be
that section b was reworded at some point and that in the
past it did not require vehicles to stay right on multilane
highways.

Still in NC, if you are driving at the speed limit, you are
not legally required to keep right whether there is a sign
saying slower traffic keep right or not.

This should put to rest the notion that "normal" is equivalent to legal
maximum speed in other state laws.

Come to think of it, one could interpret the section as requiring all
vehicles in a traffic jam to move to the right most lane since all
vehicles are going below the legal maximum speed in that case.

Sheeeit.  Had a cop run me off the road once in his hurry to get to his
exit (without signalling.)  This was in Baltimore.  Also have been
passed late at night by a cop doing at least 100 MPH with no lights or
siren.  (US-50 in MD, DC cop.)  One day I even watched two cops driving
down a surface street at about 60 MPH, one was following the other so
closely as they weaved in and out of decently heavy traffic that the
following car had to keep tapping his brakes to keep from rear-ending
the other one.  There was literally less than a full car length between
the two.  (PG county cops, MD 197 north, near Bowie Town Center.)  I
believe I posted just recently how I saw a cop pulling away from me
while I was doing 80 MPH on a 45 MPH road.  He then proceeded to
tailgate the car in front of him again at a car length or less because
that driver had the audacity to obey the speed limit when there was a
cop behind him.  (PG County cop, MD 197, between Bowie and Laurel)  IME
the cops are the fastest drivers on the road, the least likely to
signal, and the most likely to tailgate other drivers.

I'm sure there's good cops out there but it's the bad ones you notice...
and around here you don't have to wait too long to see a cop doing
something really boneheaded.

Last time I was in Miami, driving around in my red Geo Metro, I stopped
at Mickey D's in Oppalocka. There was a large motel next door that was
surrounded by razor wire to keep the n-words out. The motel I actually
stayed in was at Homestead. It, too, was surrounded by razor wire. We

&gt; Do you play VIGILANTE in other areas of life? &quot;If I don't get ahead, I

">

I don't play vigilante in ANY area of life. I obey the traffic laws of
the state of California when I'm on the highway because it is so
incredibly expensive to violate them. Whatever the California Vehicle
Code specifies for a fine has escalating penalties and the mandatory
penalty assessment TRIPLES the fine imposed by the judge. Before he
begins hearing pleas of guilty with an explanation or not guilty and
requests for traffic school the judge instructs all the violators
rounded up by the law enforcement agencies not to make a fuss with the
traffic court clerk about the penalty assessment. The fine for some
offense might be $350, but the traffic clerk is going to ask for
$1050...

I hear people pissing and moaning about how they have been driving for
umpty-leven years and routinely doing this trick or pulling that stunt
and getting away with it and the judge tells them, "Well, this time you
got caught didn't you. Pay the clerk. Next case."

Like I told Keith, California's freeways and interstates don't even
have a fast lane. Speed limit in all the lanes is exactly the same,
unless you're driving a 3-axle truck, then it's 55 and you have to
drive in the two right hand lanes. Otherwise, you're free to drive the
speed limit in whatever lane you please...

Some people just don't get it though. They *ass-ume* that the lefthand
lane is a "fast lane" or a "passing lane" and expect other law-abiding
motorist to just get out of their way. Some law-abiding motorists used
to do that. The would drive in the #2 lane instead of the #1 lane. And
the scofflaw speeders and self-righteous speeders would go blasting
down an empty lane...

The California Highway Patrol loved that. It was so easy to spot the
fools when only fools drove that way in the #1 lane. But, as I have
repeatedly stated, California can't afford to reserve a lane for
scofflaws and fools, the #1 and #2 lanes are now bumper to bumper with
cars driving 75 to 80 mph just one or two car lengths apart as they
enter the San Fernando Valley or the San Gabriel Valley. The #3 and #4
lanes are bumper to bumper 18-wheelers...

As traffic approaches downtown Los Angeles, it gradually slows to 15
mph, everyday during rush hour. If you're really lucky, you can drive
as fast as 60 mph half the time when you're within a ten mile radius of
Los Angeles.
But don't expect anybody in the #1 lane to get out of your way. They're
NOT going to do it, it's just too hard to break into the endless line
of cars in the #2 lane so one impatient asshole can go by. The left
lane drivers have to wait their turn and they find themselves going no
faster than anybody else in a line of traffic stretching as far as the
eye can see...

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Well, I didn't mean *you* personally but the you in &quot;anyone.&quot; Anyway
&gt; many factors are at play in that California bumper-to-bumper traffic:
&gt; lane indiscipline, lack of public transportation, urban sprawl...
">

I keep telling you that there is no "lane discipline" problem here,
there is a problem with undisciplined speeders. The police department
and highway patrol is too busy with the gangs and possible terrorism to
allot manpower to
patrolling the urban streets and rural highways. When asked about when
he was going to reinstitute traffic enforcement, the chief of the Los
Angeles police department denied that Los Angeles even had a traffic
problem. He's focussed on gangs and drugs.

Unwillingness to car pool means that there are two cars on the road
when there could be one car or two motorbikes. Los Angeles had a public
transportation system before the 1960's. I actually saw electric busses
in downtown Los Angeles in 1960. There were trolley tracks and there
was even a subway built thatwas never used. But General Motors (you may
have heard of them, they once built cars that your father drove) and
the tire companies conspired to get the public into automobiles and so
there was a need for highways. The number of passengers riding on
trains plummeted. The last time I travelled across the USA by train was
in 1960, though I've travelled in Panama by train...

Urban sprawl used to mean people lived about ten miles outside of town.
If you visit a town in Italy or Spain or Greece, you'll see that almost
nobody lives outside of town, if they do, they live in little villages
where they work and they don't commute to town everyday, they work in
their own little village...

But urban sprawl in California nowadays means that people live 60 or 70
miles from Los Angeles and commute by car. One coworker who lived 50
miles out told me that Riverside was the closest to Los Angeles he
could stand to live. Since he worked graveyard shift, he'd be on the
Pomona freeway every night about 8:30, speeding toward Playa del Rey
with a six pack gurgling in his belly...

The traffic in Shanghai or Beijing is just incredible. There are metal
barriers to keep the hoardes of bicycles off the sidewalk. There is an
incessant ringing of bells as one Chinese tells the other to get out of
the way, he's coming through. There is a metal barrier to keep the cars
and light trucks from driving in the bicycle lane. The biggest trucks
and tourist busses have the right of way over eveything else, stay the
heck out of their way, the big vehicle is the boss vehicle...

There are more bicycles in China being used for daily transportation
than
anyplace else in the world. America is probably #2 in bike usage. In

You are not correct. "Normal" speed of traffic in most of the codes

A proposal to the
Transportation and Appropriations Committees
U.S. House and Senate

for the creation of a
National Safe Driving Campaign

Presented By
Lisa Sheikh, Executive Director
The Partnership for Safe Driving
1312 18th Street, NW, Suite 501
Washington, DC 20036
www.crashprevention.org

Overview

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) estimates
that more than 11 million crashes take place on U.S. roads each year.
According to the agency, most crashes are not truly "accidents," but
rather a direct result of dangerous and careless driving. Thus, they
are preventable.

In addition to crashes, U.S. roads are littered each year by millions
of broken down vehicles and spilled truckloads. In most cases, proper
care and maintenance of vehicles by their owners would prevent these
events as well.

There is an urgent need to do so. According to a series of mobility
studies conducted by the Texas Transportation Institute, it is not
traffic volume but so-called "incidents," in the form of crashes, car
fires, broken down vehicles, and spilled truckloads, which are the
leading cause of traffic delays in urban communities across the nation.
In fact, these incidents account for more than half of all delays.

Besides the profound impact on road travel, car crashes represent an
ongoing humanitarian crisis in the U.S. During the past decade alone,
crashes killed 400,000 people on our nation's roads and critically
injured nearly four million more. Crashes are the leading cause of
death for children and adults age 6 to 34 and the leading cause of
long-term disability, including brain and spinal cord injuries, for all
age groups. According to NHTSA, crashes are costing the nation an
estimated $230 billion annually in lost wages and productivity,
property damage, medical care for injuries, travel delays, legal and
court fees, and emergency services.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;A good rule of thumb IMHO is that you should never cause another

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Sometimes no matter what you do, you can cause a driver behind you to
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; brake.  Case in point:  On I-95 N in Attleboro, Mass., I moved from
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the center lane (which I was in to avoid the long line of cars merging
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; in from I-295) to the right lane to take the Rte. 152 exit.  Some
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; weaver behind me managed to get from the far left to the far right
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; lane just as I moved over to take the exit.  He slammed on his brakes
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; hard (front end dipping down), blasted his horn, and used his hand
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; signals.

&gt;&gt; &gt; Only reason that happened is because the right lane was apparently
&gt;&gt; &gt; flowing faster than the lanes to the left; if KRETP were followed by
&gt;&gt; &gt; more drivers this wouldn't be the case.  Sounds like if the people
&gt;&gt; &gt; doing as you did (merging left to allow onramp traffic in) had moved
&gt;&gt; &gt; right as soon as they were clear that the weaver wouldn't have seen a
&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;hole&quot; in which to attempt a pass.

&gt;&gt; No instead you would have had dozens of cars changeing lanes for no real
&gt;&gt; reason.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;A good rule of thumb IMHO is that you should never cause another

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;to brake due to an action on your part.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Sometimes no matter what you do, you can cause a driver behind you to
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; brake.  Case in point:  On I-95 N in Attleboro, Mass., I moved from
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the center lane (which I was in to avoid the long line of cars merging
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; in from I-295) to the right lane to take the Rte. 152 exit.  Some
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; weaver behind me managed to get from the far left to the far right
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; lane just as I moved over to take the exit.  He slammed on his brakes
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; hard (front end dipping down), blasted his horn, and used his hand
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; signals.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Only reason that happened is because the right lane was apparently
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; flowing faster than the lanes to the left; if KRETP were followed by
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; more drivers this wouldn't be the case.  Sounds like if the people
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; doing as you did (merging left to allow onramp traffic in) had moved
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; right as soon as they were clear that the weaver wouldn't have seen a
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;hole&quot; in which to attempt a pass.

&gt; &gt;&gt; No instead you would have had dozens of cars changeing lanes for no real
&gt; &gt;&gt; reason.

Sure I have seen it work.  Chicago, Boston, NYC - there the locals
*expect* you to know how to drive, and if you don't - TFB, you get
stuck.  As a result, driving there (when traffic isn't stalled due to
sheer volume) is a pleasure.

Your definition of "well" is odd.  People can't get up to speed to
merge onto a freeway properly, so instead of letting them merge into a
lane with the slowest drivers, you'll now make them merge into a lane
with passing traffic.  Pardon my French, but that sounds really, really
fucking stupid.

have an easier time merging into a slower traffic stream as opposed to a

This article goes to reflect how deadly a license can be. Actually it
can become a License to Kill if you drive recklessly. Or if you engage
in lively conversations on the cell phone, oblivious to others. And the

Hit-run victim, 2, dies of his injuries: Meet Ryan Duffner

A toddler died Friday of injuries he suffered when he and his mother
were struck by a teenage driver using a cellular telephone, authorities
said.

Ryan Duffner, 2, was pronounced dead at 5 p.m. at Scottish Rite
Children's Medical Center, said Jim Dempsey, a forensic investigator at
the Gwinnett County Medical Examiner's Office.

An autopsy was scheduled for today, Dempsey said.

Ryan's mother remained in serious condition Friday at Gwinnett Medical
Center with head and leg injuries, said spokeswoman Paula Martin.

Ryan's death could lead to the teen being charged with felony vehicular
homicide, District Attorney Danny Porter said. Porter said he would
decide that, and whether to try the teen as an adult, after completing
an investigation.

Ryan suffered a heart attack early Friday morning, then hung on only
about 12 more hours. His death dashed the hopes of his family's
neighbors, who have kept a vigil since Tuesday night's accident in a
quiet subdivision between Lawrenceville and Dacula.

"It's just too close to home," said neighbor Becky Miles before she
walked out her door to take the Duffner family a supper of taco
casserole, Spanish rice and a gallon of iced tea. "Things like this
just don't happen in our neighborhood."

Neighbors now will organize supper for the Duffners for the next three
weeks, Miles said.

Lisa Duffner, Ryan and the family's other two children, Erica, 9, and
Kyle, 3, were near home after a daily neighborhood walk when the
Central Gwinnett High School student --- on the way home from visiting
a friend --- struck them as she used a cell phone, a family attorney
and police said.

The teenager, whose name is being withheld by The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, left the scene and drove to a gas station near
her Lawrenceville home, and her parents called police.

Don't know what this has to do with left lane hogs.  To me, this is a good
example of  why banning hand held cellular handset use while driving just
doesn't go far enough.  This girl wasn't dialing the phone when she killed a
pedestrian.  She was distracted by the conversation with her mother, who was
PISSED at her for stealing the family van and visiting a boyfriend she was
forbidden to see.  (so you know that wasn't a civil conversation)
Basically, while she's arguing with mom about how long she is going to be
grounded, she forgets that she's driving.

Meanwhile, CT wants to pass a law banning hand held (cellular) handset use
while driving.  Talk about missing the point.  Some people can safely talk
on the phone while driving.  Sadly, many people can NOT safely talk on the
phone while driving.  These people are going to be dangerous whether they
are holding the phone in their hands or not.

I don't want to see cell phone use while driving outlawed.  But if you must
outlaw it, do it in a way that will make a difference, at least.  Ban it
outright.  -Dave

Don't blame it on me picking up on the Bushes, just read the facts out
there. The lion always got the wrong set of priorities. His latest
"priority" is to send a space ship to Saturn, I believe it is...

PS: You know the story, right? Included at bottom.

Bush Administration Says Distracted Driving Not a Priority
by: Partnership Staff
Washington, DC September 18, 2004

In July, The Wall Street Journal reported that officials in the
Bush Administration had drafted a letter to all 50 U.S. governors
warning them that laws prohibiting hand-held cell phones while
promoting the use of headsets "will not address the problem" of
distracted driving and "may erroneously imply that hands-free phones
are safe to use while driving." Officials recommended that drivers not
use cell phones at all, except in an emergency. (Warning Call: As
Industry Pushes Headsets; In Cars, U.S. Agency Sees Danger Hands-Free
Cellphones May Be No Safer Than Hand-Held, Body of Research Says
Distracted Behind the Wheel, Jesse Drucker and Karen Lundegaard, The
Wall Street Journal, July 19, 2004; Page A1)

But the letter was never sent. Dr. Jeffrey Runge of the National
Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) told the Journal that he
didn't forward it on to the Secretary of Transportation for a
signature, in part because he felt that NHTSA had bigger priorities,
such as combating drunk driving and promoting seatbelts.

This is like officials at the National Institutes of Health
saying they cannot warn the public about the epidemic of diabetes in
America because they have bigger priorities, like cancer and AIDS.

NHTSA estimates that up to 30 percent of the more than 11
million crashes on our nation's roads each year involve distracted
driving. Research indicates that motorists in the U.S. are now spending
roughly one billion minutes per day talking on cell phones while
driving. To suggest that this problem is not worthy of the government's
attention is to reveal the depth of apathy in the Bush Administration
about the epidemic of dangerous driving in America.

HOW THE LION BENEFITS FROM THE LITTLE ANIMALS' POVERTY

One day all the little animals went up to the King of the Jungle and
complained about their poverty, and in particular about the fact that
every time, during the dry season, they had to travel long distances to
drink the precious fluid, and demanded a WATER WELL be built for
them... They cited how the resources that they contributed to the
kingdom were wasted in WARS and EXTRAVAGANT PROJECTS to the tastes of
the King... He, however, replied with all kinds of excuses: the lack of
resources, that it wasn't a matter of him not wanting it, but that it
was a matter of "priorities" --which was one of his favorite words...

Meanwhile, an Owl --who had very good eyes-- had been observing life in
the jungle, and thought this way: "Every time there's a dry season the
little animals must come to the little dirty waterhole where the Lion
waits for them... Had they been well fed and strong, he would have had
to run after them and even risk resistance. And, more importantly, the
little animals are forced to fight the Lion's wars as the quick way out
of poverty..."

And that's how the Owl landed an important --and well paid-- post in
the brand new Astronomy Department created by the King of the Jungle
--to the effect of exploring life in other planets...

You are correct, many people simply can not concentrate on two
thing at the same time.

In Pennsylvania, Delaware and NJ a driver can be, and is cited,
for using a cell phone.  They are charged with 'Careless driving'
if using a phone causes the driver to be distracted from the task
of driving..  The same is true of tuning a radio, inserting a CD,
applying makeup etc.  $136 if cited under the section in Pa.

You want to keep one: The Law of the Jungle.

But I'm dropping some that don't work (say speeding) and adding some
that do work (eg. lane discipline enforced). Don't worry though, even
the Libertarian Party calls for an Autobahn.

I don't agree with the privatizing solution (see at bottom), but here I
relay their solution...

Question

"Would a libertarian society have speed limits?"

--------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----

Answer

"In a fully libertarian world, roads would be owned and operated
privately, not by the government. Road owners would decide what speed
limits (if any) would be set. Some might have no restrictions, like the
European Autobahn.Others might have strict limits.Since safe travel is
important to drivers, owners would most likely monitor and ban reckless
drivers (slow or fast) from their roadways. The marketplace would
thereby impose "regulation" of its own, with emphasis on *safety*
rather than *speed*."

***

If the Autobahn works we may as well own it they way they do. I think
we need a more social behavior on the road, enforceable where needed,
and not paranoia. Public transportation would be a large part of the
solution, something the Libertarians reject. A 30% of drivers switching
to public transportation, would mean a considerable improvement to the
traffic jam problem, with considerable saving over building 30% more
roads. Alternative transportation would be rewarded with both SAFETY
AND SUBSIDIES, raised with gas tax money.

And we should have a chauffeur wating for us, just kidding. ;)

No. Absolutely not. The self-absorbed asshole speeders will just drive
faster and faster and cause worse multi-car fatal accidents. They
pissed and moaned about the 55mph national speed limit, and so it was
raised to 65 mph, but they aren't satisfied with that limit either,
they would drive 100 mph if the CHP didn't rein them in...

Since you like fairy tales, here's one for you, it's about Wayne
Dissapwin:

At first the Widdle Dwivers weren't the wee-est bit happy. They weren't
enjoying their concwete paved pwaypen, since they could not dwive their
toys as fast as they pweased. When they twied to dwive faster than 55
mph, some Mean Old Officers would always stop them and say, "Now you
know you're not supposed to do that!" The Mean Old Officers would
always make the Widdle Dwivers cwy...

"What fun is this? It's such a dwag, dwiving so swow!" cwied the
Unhappy Widdle Dwivers, gnashing their teeth and pulling their
forelocks, and rubbing the tears from their eyes...

They begged and pweaded, "Oh, pwease, Mr. Boss Man, Sir! Wet us dwive
65 miles per hour, and we'll never ask you for anything else. We
sowemnly pwomise, cwoss our widdle hearts, hope to die."

The Biggest Mr. Boss Man, Sir! of the California Highway Patrol said,
"OK, we're going to let you drive 65 mph, but that's IT. There will be
no tolerance for any speed above that maximum limit."

So the Widdle Dwivers said, "Okey-dokey, we pwomise we wont dwive any
faster, Mr. Boss Man, sir! We will be Happy Widdle Dwivers now!"

But they had their widdle middle fingers cwossed behind their backs,
and they knew that any CHP on the freeways was going to automaticawy
give them 5 mph, knowing that his citation would be contested in court
as being "chickenshit"...

The CHP believed that the accident rate on freeways outside of built up
urban areas would increase horrendously. The 55 mph speed limit still
prevailed in built up areas where the population was X-number of people
per square miles. That included most of the Los Angeles metropolitan
area extending for 50 miles in all directions...

But did the Happy Widdle Dwivers pay any attention to the fact that the
freeway speed wimit signs still wead 55 mph? No, they bewieved that
they had won an even gweater victowy. They bewieved that all speed
wimits had fallen to the weight of pwessure of their demands...

Soon the Happy Widdle Dwivers were feeling quite safe cwuising at 70
mph, then 75 mph, and some Bwave Widdle Dwivers who'd never been
allowed to Dwive Weally Weally Fast were testing their apparent new
found Fweedom of the Open Woad. They were dwiving at 80 and 85 mph, and
that was when they noticed The Others In Fwont of Them in the
Fabulously Fast Lane For Passing Only...

None of the Happy Widdle Dwivers ever thought for an instant that
Fabulously Fast Lane For Passing Only was anything but just that, a
lane where they could dwive as fast as they pweased...

The Others In Fwont of Them always seemed to be Weally Weally Old
People, who didn't Know How To Have Fun. The Weally Weally Old People
always spoiled the Bwave Widdle Dwivers' fun, and many Brave Widdle
Dwivers compwained and compwained and compwained. But Mr. Boss Man Sir
just wouldn't wisten when they compwained to him about The Weally
Weally Old People that were spoiling their fun and making them dwive
weally weally swow. 65 miles per hour was just too swow. It was bowing.
They weren't having any fun, if they got stuck behind Weally Weally Old
People...

The Bwave Widdle Dwivers would dwive right past the slow moving Weally
Weally Old People whenever they could, and they would stare and stare
and stare at the Weally Weally Old People and sometimes The Bwave
Widdle Dwivers would raise a middle finger and wave it at the Weally
Weally Old Person, but the Weally Weally Old Person wouldn't even look
at them...

So the Bwave Widdle Dwivers decided that the Weally Weally Old People
weren't just weally weally old, they must be weally weally stupid, and
everybody knows that stupid people are no fun...

One of the Bwavest Widdle Dwivers read a magazine article one day. It
was about a Magical Kingdom Acwoss the Sea, where a wonderful hewo
dwove his Powerful Sportscar as fast as he pweased. There were no speed
wimits in the Magical Kingdom Acwoss the Sea and there were no Weally
Weally Old People on the woads over there. And nobody ever got in the
way of that wonderful hewo to spoil his fun...

That hewo's name was Wayne Dissapwin. Some of the Bwavest Widdle
Dwivers went to visit the Magical Kingdom Acwoss the sea and they wrote
back home and told other Bwave Widdle Dwivers how wonderful it was to
be able to dwive with no speed wimits and no Weally Weally Old People
in fwont of them.

They knew that the wonderful hewo Wayne Discipwin had been dwiving
there, they could tell that because all the Weally Weally Stupid People
stayed out of their way and wet them dwive as they pweased. The Weally
Weally Stupid People acted scared though, but the Bwave Widdle Dwivers
didn't care, they didn't like Weally Weally Stupid People anyway. They
weren't any fun to be around...

Some of the Bwave Widdle Dwivers back home in California said, "Why
don't we twy to find Wayne Dissapwin and bwing him here and let him
scare all the Weally Weally Old People and all the Weally Weally Stupid
people off the woads? Then we will be able to dwive even faster and
have wots and wots of fun!"

Nobody could ever find Wayne Dissapwin in the Magical Kingdom Acwoss
The Sea, there was just the evidence of the Weally Weally Stupid being
being scared.

The Bwave Widdle Dwivers thought, "Well maybe Wayne Dissapwin is on
vacation. Maybe he's dwiving awound America. Wet's wook for Wayne
Dissapwin there!"

So the Bwave Widdle Dwivers formed a convoy of shiny Porsches and
TransAms and Corvettes and Miatas and Mustangs and Camaros and BMW's
and Mercedes Benzes, all washed an waxed and polished and tuned to the
highest wevel of performance and they set out upon their Quest for
Wayne Dissapwin...

They wooked for Wayne Dissapwin in Texas, because they knew that lots
of hewos wived there. Out on the woads, they saw that Wayne Dissapwin
must have happily dwiven through Texas, because there were
no Weally Weally Old People spoiling their fun, and all the Weally
Weally Stupid People acted so scared, they never even tried to get in
the way of a Bwave Widdle Dwiver, and they wouldn't even wook at a
Bwave Widdle Dwiver as he sped by...

And there were signs that said "Slow Traffic Keep Right" and "Left Lane
For Passing Only" so the Bwave Widdle dwivers knew that Wayne Dissapwin
had weft his mark for everbody to see....

The Bwave Widdle Dwivers rolled down their windows and shouted "Slow
Traffic Keep Right!" and "Left Lane For Passing Only!" at the Scared
Stupid People they passed but the Scared Stupid People were weally
weally dumb, they acted like they just couldn't hear a thing

Some Bwave Widdle Dwivers twied raising their middle fingers at the
Scared Stupid People but the Scared Stupid People wouldn't look back.
Some of the Bwave Widdle Dwivers started throwing things at the Scared
Stupid People's cars, but the Scared Stupid People Just would not wook
at the Bwave Widdle Dwivers.

The Convoy of Bwave Widdle Dwivers shouted "Wayne Dissapwin! Wayne
Dissapwin" as they drove down the highway in the Fabulously fast Lane
For Passing Only...

But there were Mean Old Officers in Texas, too, and they would stop the
Bwave Widdle dwivers and tell them that they couldn't dwive as fast as
they pweased, and that it was not OK to throw beer bottles at the
Scared Stupid People's cars or break their mirrors off to get them to
wook at the Bwave Widdle Dwivers...

When the Mean Old Officer made a Bwave Widdle Dwiver sit in his car
beside the road, the Bwave Widdle Dwiver would always try to tell the
Mean Old Officer about his hewo Wayne Dissapwin, but the Mean Old
Officer would just say, "Wayne Dissapwin? Never heard of him. Sign the
ticket please."

The Bwave Widdle Dwivers were upset. Some of them fought back tears of
humiliation. The Mean Old Officers must be making fun of their quest to
find the Wonderful Hewo Wayne Dissapwin...

So the Bwave Widdle Dwivers said, "Wet's go to Virginia. Wots and wots
of hewos wive in Virginia. Maybe Wayne Dissapwin is over there. But
they couldn't find Wayne Dissapwin in Virginia, either. Just a lot of
Scared Stupid People were dwiving awong on the wight side of the woad,
where they bewonged anyway. And the Mean Old Officers told them that
they'd never heard of Wayne Dissapwin and made them sign their names on
yellow slips of paper...

The Bwave Widdle Dwivers decided to go to Montana. They'd heard that
there were no speed wimits there. Dwiving as fast as they pweased, they
didn't even see very many Scared Stupid People. But they saw one big
twuck ahead of them. It was dwiving weally weally slow, so they decided
to pass the weally weally slow twuck, and one Bwave Widdle Dwiver threw
a beer bottle at the Scared Stupid Person that must be dwiving it...

The beer bottle bounced off the big gold star painted on the side of
the weally weally slow twuck, and the Mean Old Officer dwiving the
weally weally slow twuck turned his red light and siren on, and he made
the Bwave Widdle Dwivers stop. He looked at their license plates and
said, "Shee--it!
You boys ain't from around hereabouts. What y'all Californicators doin'
up here in Montana, throwin' beer bottle at Sheriff's SUV's for...

The Bwave Widdle Dwivers could hardly contain themselves, they pushed
and crowded each other. They wanted to tell the Mean Old Officer about
their quest for Wayne Dissapwin, and how he must be in Montana, because
they hadn't seen a Scared Stupid Person all day and they'd driven as
fast as they wanted and no Mean Old Officer had stopped them until just
now, so would he please tell them where

Almost a book... What's the name of it, "Scared Stupid People Own the
Rowd?" Nice effort at getting your point across though. ;)

I find it interesting that most people in the Autobahn do NOT travel at
supersonic speeds but rather at SAFE SPEEDS, or speeds dictated by the
TRAFFIC VOLUME, which results in not much higher AVERAGE speeds than
here. But the big difference is that they do not punish the fit, but
the stupid. Nothing wrong with that: the stupid should not be on the
roads, at least not in the freeways, expressways, Autobahns or whatever
road that requires high skills. Their reckless demeanor can endanger
innocent victims, and shouldn't deserve any pity, just condemnation.
There's a solution for them though: PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION.

Some facts...

Speed limits
The German autobahns are famous for being some of the only public roads
in the world without blanket speed limits for cars and motorcycles,
though traffic on them is usually heavy enough to restrict speeds to
little above the typical motorway speeds found elsewhere. However,
speed limits do apply at junctions and other danger points, like
sections under construction or in need of repair. (Speed limits at
non-construction sites are generally 100 km/h (62 mph) or 120 km/h (75
mph); construction sites have a usual speed limit of 80 km/h (50 mph)
but may be as low as 60 km/h or even 40 km/h (25 mph). Certain
stretches have separate, and lower, speed limits used in cases of wet
lanes.) Some limits were imposed to reduce pollution and noise. Limits
can also be put into place temporarily through dynamic traffic guidance
systems that display the according traffic signs. If there is no speed
limit the recommended speed is 130 km/h (80 mph) (German:
Richtgeschwindigkeit).

What's wrong with driving 100 MPH?  Is that some magic number above
which your car spontaneously veers into a busload of nuns and explodes?
Gee, all those Krauts must be Protestants, or worse yet, atheists or
heathens, since they don't seem to mind.  Must have killed off all the
nuns a long time ago, too, since you hardly ever hear of a car/bus
flaming wreck over there.

Oddly enough, both forms are used on signs in New York. Somewhere
between LeRoy (Exit 47) and Williamsville (Exit 50) on the Thruway, the
signs change from STKR to KRETP, my guess is it's on the boundary
between the Rochester and Buffalo DOT regions.

I'm not sure which is more accurate with respect to the law, or perhaps
the legal requirement depends on which sign is posted.

I've already posted a link to PA's law.  (I don't really consider myself
to be from Maryland, I just live there until I can afford to move back
to PA &lt;G&gt;)  You're right, "cooperation" and "courtesy" don't appear in
the law; it simply tells you what you must do, which is to keep to the
right unless passing (or other exceptions like preparing for a left turn
or exit.)  I imagine that they assume you'd understand that this is in
the spirit of cooperation and courtesy and not just the big bad meanie
state trying to boss you around.

The automobile and petrochem lobby would never allow it. They want as
many idiots on the road as they can manage. Retailers, Hotels, etc...
too much money involved in keeping people as mobile as possible.

And the insurance industry loves unleashing them out onto the road
too. Think about it, they typically make a set 3% on your premium and
are often regulated by the state. Now which is more profitable... 3%
of $100/yr or 3% of $2,000/yr?

So if you can ensure that costs remain sky high you can make more
money. If you can criminalise speeding (which moron drivers couldn't
manage anyways) and charge additional penalties for it, all the more
better.

So. A Bwave Widdle Dwiver is wooking for Wayne Dissapwin in the
California Vehicle Code and cites:

CVC 21654. (a) Notwithstanding the prima facie speed limits, any
vehicle proceeding upon a highway at a speed less than the normal speed
of traffic moving in the same direction at such time shall be driven in
the right-hand lane for traffic or as close as practicable to the
right-hand edge or curb, except when overtaking and passing another
vehicle proceeding in the same direction or when preparing for a left
turn at an intersection or into a private road or driveway.

Yup, that's the law that is often misinterpreted by halfwits to mean
that motorists of ordinary sensibilities of what is safe must get out
of the way of lunatics driving 100 mph as they wish to join a massive
hundred car pileup in a thick wall of tule fog that keeps them from
seeing 100 feet ahead of them...

The lunatics will swear to an arresting officer that they drive the
same highway every day at a high rate of speed and that they've never
been stopped before, so why should they be pulled over today, just
because "it's a little foggy" if they are just doing what "everybody
else" is doing. Isn't it "normal" to do what "everybody else" does?

If you look at the list definitions in the California Vehicle Code, you
won't find "normal" or "prima facie"...

I would like to think that "normal" didn't equate with "mob rule". I
would rather believe that "normal" means "free from mental disorder"
but the crazy driving of many motorists on California highways leads me
to wonder
if they are suffering from psychosocial maladaptive disorders or if
they are merely substance-impaired...

"Prima facie" means true, valid, or sufficient at first impression,
apparent or self-evident. I get the first impression that a reasonable
person wouldn't want to fling himself at a telephone pole at 100 mph,
and that a reasonable person would drive at a speed where he could stop
if a herd of range cattle were standing in the fog on the road ahead...

Whenever California's Basic Speed Law is discussed, "prima facie"
usually comes into the argument.

CVC 22350.   No person shall drive a vehicle upon a highway at a speed
greater than is reasonable or prudent having due regard for weather,
visibility, the traffic on, and the surface and width of, the highway,
and in no event at a speed which endangers the safety of persons or
property.

So, does CVC 21654 mean that drivers who want to drive faster than the
prima facie speed allowed by weather and road conditions can endanger
the safety of the drivers they are overtaking at a high rate of speed?
I don't think so...

And certainly CVC 21654 doesn't mean that the "normal speed of traffic"
may be in excess of the maximum speed limit for the type of highway and
the number of lanes and whether it's a controlled access highway or one
that range cattle might be wandering around on...

Maximum Speed Limit
CVC 22349. (a) Except as provided in Section 22356, no person may drive
a vehicle upon a highway at a speed greater than 65 miles per hour.
(b) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no person may drive a
vehicle upon a two-lane, undivided highway at a speed greater than 55
miles per hour unless that highway, or portion thereof, has been posted
for a higher speed by the Department of Transportation or appropriate
local agency upon the basis of an engineering and traffic survey. For
purposes of this subdivision, the following apply:
(1) A two-lane, undivided highway is a highway with not more than one
through lane of travel in each direction.

I certainly hope this helps any Bwave Widdle Dwiver wooking for Wayne
Dissapwin here in California. Wayne Dissapwin does not live here...

Not so much traffic stop, but post-incident.

I have to say however that I think the whole thing is blown way out of

even do randoms just as part of their CYA procedures (they call it "due
diligence" which is a fancy way of saying CYA) should something happen
that could potentially open them up to liability.  So drug users aren't
likely to be in positions where they're going to be able to cause
trouble; likewise, someone who wants to have a good job with a future is
going to decide not to use drugs, even if they become legal tomorrow.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Can we at least agree that KRETP is a good principle and is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;conducive
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;to faster yet safer traffic flow?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I do not believe that. In some areas yes. In urban areas I think
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;exactly
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;opposite is true. Think of it this way. Driver A is going 55 MPH. He
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;has
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;stay in the right lane until he is a mile from his left exit.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Well, personally I feel that left exits are the exits of the beast...

&gt;&gt;&gt;Yea but they are a big part of the highway system in Virginia.

&gt;&gt;simply bad engineering IMHO.  Causes problems that shouldn't exist.

&gt; Or could it be we need to change the way we think about lane useage.
">

I agree, but not necessarily in the way that you are thinking.  I think
it's time to move back to the original ideas of lane discipline that
were always codified into law and let lapse due to the Claybrookian
mentality that took over in the mid-70s.

Let's look at it from a purely pragmatic standpoint.  Whether or not you
agree with our current speed limits, I hope that you agree with me that
it is the place of the police to enforce them, and it is the primary
responsibility of each driver to drive in a safe and courteous manner.
So therefore there's really no place on the roads for drivers
deliberately acting in such a way as to impede the movement of other
drivers, no matter what their motives.

Secondly, no matter what the speed limits are, and regardless of whether
or not the majority of the drivers on a given multi-lane road obey them,
it is a simple fact of life that there will always be speed
differentials between different drivers.  There will always be a slow
moving truck, say... even if all drivers on a road are attempting to
drive at exactly the speed limit, there will be variations in speed -
due to speedometer error, someone installing non-OEM size tires on their
car without understanding the implications, whatever.

So, we have an inescapable fact that no matter what else we do, we are
going to have vehicles traveling at different speeds interacting with
each other.  Therefore, we have to have a set of rules so that each
driver clearly understands his or her responsibilities as to how to
interact with other traffic, and likewise be able to expect other
traffic to act in a predictable manner to allow them to plan their moves
ahead of time rather than being purely reactive to other traffic.

Given all that, the best set of rules that the various people who have
devoted any serious amount to this problem have come up with is STKR and
KRETP.  (assuming driving on the right hand side of the roadway as we do
in the US.)  These rules make sense for several reasons:

1) On a limited access roadway, traffic generally exits and enters on
the right.  Therefore, it makes sense to try to stratify the flow of
traffic so that the slowest traffic ends up in the rightmost lanes so
that vehicles to not have to accelerate or brake excessively to enter
the flow of traffic.

2) Since the slowest traffic ought to be on the right, by necessity
traffic wishing to pass must do so to the left of slower traffic.  It
makes no sense to have a different rule for the rightmost lane than any
other, so it is logical to extend this to all lanes.

3) In the interest of efficient traffic flow, it makes sense that slower
traffic should yield to faster traffic, until such time as all lanes are
fully utilized.  This is also an extension of right lane behavior, where
traffic merging in is required to yield to through traffic.  Thus,
applying this rule across the entire roadway simply states that one
cannot change lanes to the left if one will impede an approaching
vehicle by doing so.

4) Once you have accepted the three points above, by necessity to
accomplish the goals set forth in 1) and 3), you end up with (drum roll
please) STKR/KRETP.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;go 10 MPH faster than all the other cars in his lane. How do you do
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;that?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Answer you slow down until you have enough space in front of you to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;speed
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;up
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;ten miles per hour than change lanes.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;...for exactly that reason.  Right exits don't have this problem.  But
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;if he has to slow down to allow enough space to accelerate 10 MPH
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;before changing lanes, I'd posit that he was following the vehicle in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;front of him to begin with, or else was driving a car that I wouldn't
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;want to drive!  (I mean, I drive a Porsche 944 - a slow, underpowered
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;beast if there ever was one - and I don't have these problems.  Of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;course, I'm not afraid to use the entire travel of the little skinny
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;pedal on the right when required, either)

&gt;&gt;&gt;Well I was talking about in heavy traffic.

&gt;&gt;Doesn't matter, surely you shouldn't be following any closer just
&gt;&gt;because traffic is heavier...?

&gt; I try not to. Unfortunately many (bad) drivers see any opening in traffic
&gt; and just have to switch lanes. It doesn't matter that they wont go anywhere.
&gt; In there minds they are moving so they are accomplishing something. All they
&gt; really do is increase tailgateing and slow traffic.
">

Well, I can say from personal experience driving on highways where
STKR/KRETP is either not codified into law or else generally ignored by
all motorists, that "traffic weaving" while certainly an undesirable
behavior from an overall safety standpoint, often does offer real
benefits to an individual motorist by allowing him to break free from a
slow-moving clot of traffic where there's a real danger of being "boxed
in" and instead travel on a relatively deserted stretch of highway both
faster and without the risk of being "trapped."  Sometimes it is a near
necessity, if one is hung out to dry in one of the left lanes and due to
chaotic traffic flow one can't simply slow down a few MPH and slip into
a lane to the right, if one's exit is coming up.  The only effective way
to discourage "traffic weaving" is to remove the incentive to do so, by
encouraging a stratified flow where if one desires to go faster one
simply moves left, or if one wishes to slow down, one moves right.  If
everyone is playing by the rules, a driver stuck in the left lane at
below his desired travel speed is much less likely to try to "traffic
weave" to get out of the congestion as he has confidence that a) as soon
as the drivers in front of him pass the slower traffic to their right,
they will move over, and b) there is no benefit to his changing lanes as
he's

The only cite you need is to visit Virginia and drive on its highways and
byways.  You will soon see that the normal speed of traffic is 10-15 miles per
hour over the posted limit, except in residential neighborhoods, where it is 5-8
miles per hour over the posted limit.  If you drive the speed limit (and I've
been doing that a lot, having the third of three children going through learners
permits and driving instruction) you will be a moving chicane for NORMAL
traffic.

In Virginia, illegal speeds are VERY MUCH considered normal.

Perhaps the spelling impaired poster should read up on the corresponding

Do The RIGHT Thing!

June is Lane Courtesy Month

With summer just around the corner and visions of vacations dominating
Americans' thoughts, our highways will experience a dramatic increase
in traffic. To enhance the travel experience for motorists, the
National Motorists Association (NMA) has designated June as Lane
Courtesy Month and is kicking off the campaign with the slogan "Do the
RIGHT Thing!"

Lane Courtesy, also called Lane Discipline, has a powerful influence on
highway safety, traffic flow, and congestion. Arguably, its effect is
more important than speed limits, traffic enforcement, or any other
attempt to control driver behavior. Ask almost any motorist what most
raises their ire when using major highways and the answer will be
"failure of slower traffic to keep right or yield to the right when
faster traffic approaches."

The concept, or ethic, of lane courtesy evolved in the United States
with the development of the Interstate System. However, the concept of
slower traffic yielding to the right for faster traffic has its origins
in the older system of two lane highways. Almost all states have a
provision in their traffic law that requires slower traffic, upon being
signaled by a following vehicle, to pull to the right to allow the
faster traffic to pass.

Prior to 1973, rural speed limits reflected typical travel speeds.
Consequently, slower vehicles were not driving the speed limit and
there was no rationale for deliberately blocking the progress of faster
traffic. The 55 MPH National Maximum Speed Limit changed all that.

After 1973, there was a serious disconnect between speed limits and the
actual speed of traffic. There was also a total breakdown in lane
courtesy. The slower traffic that would normally stay in the right hand
lane could now linger anywhere on the highway, in any lane, and still
be traveling at the legal maximum speed of 55 miles per hour. This
counter productive process was reinforced over a period of 21 years,
influencing a whole generation of new drivers.

In 1995 the 55 MPH National Maximum Speed Limit was repealed and
several states raised speed limits to put the limits more in concert
with the reality of highway travel. However, the almost quarter century
habit of wallowing anywhere on the highway did not disappear with the
advent of new speed limit signs.

The lane courtesy ethic must be reinvigorated, promoted, and recognized
for the contribution it can make toward safer, faster and more
enjoyable travel. We hope the NMA's "Do the RIGHT Thing!" campaign and
declaring June as "Lane Courtesy Month" will reawaken interest and
support for this incredibly important and positive traffic safety
concept.

While they have many good ideas, NMA's policy in favor of cell phones
and driving is funny, and it's not in touch with the real world out
there. Predictably you see underspeeders to be engaged on the phone.
Also they are slow to react. And they are oblivious to pedestrians,
bicycles, dogs...

Cell Phone Use Turns Youth Drivers into Elderly Drivers
by: Partnership Staff
Washington, DC April 15, 2005

A new study of the dangers of talking on a cell phone while
driving confirmed that the reaction time of drivers is dramatically
reduced when talking on a cell phone. In addition, the study found that
young drivers become like elderly drivers when they're talking on a
phone.

The study's principal investigator, Professor David Strayer of
the University of Utah, compared it to turning a 20-year-old driver
into a 70-year-old driver. "It's like instantly aging a large number of
drivers," he said.

The study appears in the winter issue of Human Factors.

Motorists talking on cell phones were found to be 18 percent
slower to react to brake lights. They also took 17 percent longer to
regain their speed after they braked.

The latest study used high-tech simulators. Overall, it showed a
two-fold increase in the number of rear-end collisions by drivers using
cell phones.

Say WHAT? How does calling June "Lane Courtesy Month" do anything
"fight" law-abiding drivers legally occupying the left lane?

What kind of ideas are you trying to put into the heads of

Ask me what raises my ire. Go ahead. Ask me. Well, I'll tell you
anyway. I get annoyed by drivers who won't obey the speed limits, tail
gate, and refuse to wait their turn the stretch of road that I'm
already driving on.
I get annoyed by RUDE scofflaws who think that the open road is their
personal speedway. You want to talk about "courtesy"? Speeding and
overtaking traffic legally occupying the left lane is the worse kind of
rudeness. You want courtesy? Don't speed, don't tail gate, don't expect
the other guy to get out of your way just because he's already where
you want to go...

Watch how people who whine about "courtesy" behave in a supermarket,
bank, or public park where their rude behavior can be instantly
punished by a poke in the nose. The same assholes who tailgate and
speed and honk their horns and flash their lights at law-abiding
motorists turn into absolute PUSSIES when they are out of their cars...

Speed limits on rural two-lane roads are still 55 mph. But stupid
assholes assholes try to drive 75 or 80 mph on those deserted roads.
They run into cows and tractor, and, hopefully some of thos stupid
asshole run into each other, and that's really *nice* of them to remove
themselves from the gene pool...

There was a whole lot less traffic on the road in 1973, too. Here in
California, all lanes of a freeway had the same speed limit, and all
the lanes were needed to move commuter traffic. So people were as used
to driving in the left lane as they were in any other. Ordinary
law-abiding motorists continued to use the same lanes just as before...

But there were scofflaws who refused to slow down to the national speed
limit. They insisted on driving 65 mph in the new 55 mph zoned
freeways. They harassed law-abiding drivers. Soon, the law-abiding
drivers moved over one lane to the right, as expected by the scofflaw
speeders. There was an endless line of law-abiding drivers in that
lane...

The scofflaws thought, "Oh, boy, here's an empty lane, I can finally
drive as fast as I please!" The California Highway Patrol appreciated
how easy it was to catch the speeders. They were all in the left lane,
behaving like fools...

When you throw out your net, fishing for fools, you just don't catch
ALL the fools. Some fools get away while you're pulling the fool you
just caught out of the stream of traffic...

Gradually, though, more and more drivers thought, if that idiot can get
away with speeding, so can I. So, it wasn't long before there was an
endless line of fools going 65 mph in the so-called "fast lane", and
they were very seldom caught up in the fool net of the California
Highway Patrol. The odds were in favor of a fool getting away with his
foolishness
anytime traffic was so heavy that the CHP cruisers couldn't easily
maneuver through it...

But, heavy traffic is self-regulating. All idiots want to be on the
highway at the same time of the day, every working day, and so they get
caught in big traffic jams or get slowed down by drivers changing lanes
and entering and exiting the freeway...

">

On California freeways, car drivers always could drive in any lane they
pleased at any speed up to the speed limit, and the "slower traffic
keep right" laws could be easily and rightly enforced if somebody was
trying to drive 45 mph in a 55mph speed limit zone...

However, even though the national speed limit has been restored to 65
mph, scofflaw drivers don't want to obey the limit that they begged and
pleaded to have restored, they want to cruise at 80 or 90 or 100 mph
and constantly use the "slower traffic keep right" argument as a "red
herring"
to draw attention away from their speeding and generally rude road
behavior..

OK, so when was the last time YOU saw a so-called left lane hog
"wallowing" along at 55 mph anywhere on a Florida highway? Certainly
nobody "wallows" in the left lane of a California freeway doing 55 mph,
unless there's a whole line of traffic stretching from horizon to
horizon and they just cannot drive any faster...

Yes. It is incredible. I sure don't believe that lane courtesy is more
important to traffic safety than obeying the lanes against speeding and

tailgating and trying to pass every other car on the road...

Don't need no "lane discipline" out there on the empty roads o'
Airy-Zona. I love Airy-Zona. I'm a bird watcher. Airy-Zona's the home

Ain't hardly no traffic and no slow lane out there on them rural roads,
they's just 2-lane blacktop, stretchin' 'cross lonesome valleys from
one horizon to t'other.

What's the name of the bombing range between Gila bend and Buckeye?
Do Airy-Zona's finest still sit up on top of the hill radar-ing
speeders?

Damned shame when ya cain't speed crost a frikkin' *bombing range*
'thout bein' busted by Smokey tha Bear...

I showed him my speedometer that had numbers ever' 20mph and told him I
would be just a-guessin' if'n I said this here little bar on the speedo
mus' be 'bout 50mph, and this here little bar might just be 55 mph, but
I dunno fer certain. This here's a rental car, I just got it at Sky

Smokey Bear bought that, let me go with a warnin', said "Slow down and

could almost "beam" yourself, Spock-like, to the Vanishing Point, and
there'd be no bulldozers waitin' for ya---but I ain't sayin' I ever

rake towed behind a tractor wouldn't be purty, now, would it? Findin' a

Oh, my! Some of those ingredients are laxatives and one will make your
boyfriend call you "sweet pee"...

Maybe driving after ingesting artificially sweetened bubblegum or diet
sodas containing phenylalanine *should be* illegal. The body
synthesizes phenylalanine into tyrosine which becomes epinephrine (also
known as adrenaline)...

And the driver suffering from bubblegum-induced road rage may also
develop freckles from the melanin synthesized from phenylalanine...

&gt; In the case of the Hubble space telescope, the engineers are said to
&gt; have even gone as far as specifying limits on the magnitude of the
&gt; fourth derivative.  There is no universally accepted name for the
&gt; fourth derivative, i.e. the rate of change of jerk, The term jounce
&gt; has been used but it has the drawback of using the same initial
&gt; letter as jerk so it is not clear which symbol to use.  Another less
&gt; serious suggestion is snap (symbol s), crackle (symbol c) and pop
&gt; (symbol p) for the 4th, 5th and 6th derivatives respectively.  Higher
&gt; derivatives do not yet have names because they do not come up very
&gt; often.

&gt; Since force (F = ma) is rate of change of momentum (p, symbol clashes
&gt;  with pop) it seems necessary to find terms for higher derivatives of
&gt;  force too.  So far yank (symbol Y) has been suggested for rate of
&gt; change of force, tug (symbol T) for rate of change of yank, snatch
&gt; (symbol S) for rate of change of tug and shake (symbol Sh) for rate
&gt; of change of snatch.  Needless to say, none of these are in any kind
&gt; of standards, yet.  We just made them up on usenet.

Which pretty much squares with my recollection that jerk is fairly
useful but "yank" really isn't common usage; if you need the time
derivative of momentum you just call it the time derivative of momentum.

So as usual asshat is going on about stuff he knows nothing about.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I personally like

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;are
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;lots
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;of laws I would love to change. Unfortunately they don't let me do
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;that.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;You underestimate the weight that the word of a LEO carries.  If you
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;put together a professional-looking letter to appropriate legislators
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;you might be surprised at how much more consideration that gets than a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;similar letter from Joe Public Citizen.  Of course, you have to be
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;careful that any opinions expressed by you when it is made clear that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;you're a LEO aren't going to cause you political problems with your
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;job...

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;It would.

&gt;&gt;&gt;That's a shame.  (seriously.  hard to express tone of voice in a text
&gt;&gt;&gt;only forum, but there's no sarcasm there, trust me.)

&gt;&gt; It goes back to the theory that anything I say as a professional, is
&gt;&gt; eventually translated (by some people) to be the opinion of my employer.

&gt; I understand, believe me.  I made my original comments without knowing
&gt; what laws you wanted to have changed.  Now if we can get you onto the
&gt; subject of traffic law reform, that's a little less politicized :)

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Personally, if you feel a law should be changed, I'd encourage you to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;make your views known.  Nothing ever gets done by saying nothing.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Hmm I wonder what the boss would say if I joined normal : )

&gt;&gt;&gt;um, you mean NORML?  If you're implying that you privately support
&gt;&gt;&gt;their cause, I agree with you.  Not that I'm a dope-smoking hippie or
&gt;&gt;&gt;anything like that - but ISTM that a little MJ now and then causes far
&gt;&gt;&gt;fewer societal problems on a personal level than, say, alcohol abuse
&gt;&gt;&gt;for instance - and yet the criminalization of MJ causes quite a few
&gt;&gt;&gt;societal problems by creating a whole criminal underclass to handle the
&gt;&gt;&gt;production and distribution.  And that's coming from someone who's been
&gt;&gt;&gt;known to crack open a beer when getting home from work...

&gt;&gt; I believe the main reason it is still illegal is; there is no fast,
&gt;&gt; cheap, easy way  to detect intocicateing levels dureing a traffic stop.

&gt; Not so much traffic stop, but post-incident.

&gt; I have to say however that I think the whole thing is blown way out of
&gt; proportion; most companies do pre-employment drug screenings and some even
&gt; do randoms just as part of their CYA procedures (they call it &quot;due
&gt; diligence&quot; which is a fancy way of saying CYA) should something happen
&gt; that could potentially open them up to liability.  So drug users aren't
&gt; likely to be in positions where they're going to be able to cause trouble;
&gt; likewise, someone who wants to have a good job with a future is going to
&gt; decide not to use drugs, even if they become legal tomorrow.

&gt; Frankly, I'm surprised that alcohol and tobacco haven't been included in
&gt; this trend.  I suppose it's only a matter of time.

&gt;&gt;&gt;And, yes, since &quot;drugs are bad, m'kay,&quot; you might have an issue there.
&gt;&gt;&gt;Sadly.

&gt;&gt; Yep standing up in public and saying pot should be legal is a career
&gt;&gt; killer in many fields.

&gt; Well, just anything having to do with the government, is all.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;snip&gt;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Can we at least agree that KRETP is a good principle and is conducive
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;to faster yet safer traffic flow?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I do not believe that. In some areas yes. In urban areas I think
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;exactly
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;opposite is true. Think of it this way. Driver A is going 55 MPH. He
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;has
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;stay in the right lane until he is a mile from his left exit.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Well, personally I feel that left exits are the exits of the beast...

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Yea but they are a big part of the highway system in Virginia.

&gt;&gt;&gt;simply bad engineering IMHO.  Causes problems that shouldn't exist.

&gt;&gt; Or could it be we need to change the way we think about lane useage.

&gt; I agree, but not necessarily in the way that you are thinking.  I think
&gt; it's time to move back to the original ideas of lane discipline that were
&gt; always codified into law and let lapse due to the Claybrookian mentality
&gt; that took over in the mid-70s.

&gt; Let's look at it from a purely pragmatic standpoint.  Whether or not you
&gt; agree with our current speed limits, I hope that you agree with me that it
&gt; is the place of the police to enforce them, and it is the primary
&gt; responsibility of each driver to drive in a safe and courteous manner. So
&gt; therefore there's really no place on the roads for drivers deliberately
&gt; acting in such a way as to impede the movement of other drivers, no matter
&gt; what their motives.

other drivers? If so we are miles apart.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Secondly, no matter what the speed limits are, and regardless of whether

No it doesn't. It may be how you were taught to drive, but it actually makes
very little sense to put as much traffic as possible at the merge points.

It isn't logical at all. It is what you were taught. If you want to be

Why? It seems to me that faster traffic should yeild to slower traffic,
unless the slower traffic is slow to the point, of being less than a
predetermined speed.

This is also an extension of right lane behavior, where

True but these rules also assume that the traffic on the highway is
traveling at the speed limit. Entering traffic should enter at the speed
limit or close to it. Than if necessary slow down slightly to fit into the
stream, or speed up to stay in front of it.

If so little thought went into them, why are they used in nearly every
country with a developed highway system (OK, KLETP in countries where
they drive on the left) as well as most US states?  Why is driving so
much more pleasant in areas where KRETP is commonplace, regardless of
where one falls on the speed bell curve?  (I realize that as a regular
RAD reader and opponent of artificially slow speed limits, one might
assume that I often am on the high end of the speed distribution for
wherever I am driving.  That is not always a safe assumption; I have
driven in places where I have been slower traffic, sometimes due to
driving a large or heavily loaded truck, or because the locals had lead
feet.  Heck, I lived in Michigan for about a year :)  I still prefer
KRETP even in those situations.)

Why would it be "as much traffic as possible?"  Generally the
distribution of speed on a freeway conforms to a bell curve, therefore
on a six lane freeway the majority of traffic would be spending most of
its time in the *middle* lane.  The rightmost lane will have a lot of
the heavy trucks and slower drivers, but the majority of traffic will
be passing them.

Thus creating the typical condition commonly seen around here where
people merge onto the freeway at below the normal travel speed, and

KISS.  When something works well, why add complexity to it?  And who
determines what that predetermined speed is, anyway?  KRETP/STKR works
no matter what speed the drivers involved are traveling; your method
leaves a lot up to the interpretation of what an appropriate speed is
for the drivers involved, often leading to conflict.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Well I was talking about in heavy traffic.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Doesn't matter, surely you shouldn't be following any closer just
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;because traffic is heavier...?

&gt; &gt;&gt; I try not to. Unfortunately many (bad) drivers see any opening in traffic
&gt; &gt;&gt; and just have to switch lanes. It doesn't matter that they wont go
&gt; &gt;&gt; anywhere. In there minds they are moving so they are accomplishing
&gt; &gt;&gt; something. All they really do is increase tailgateing and slow traffic.

&gt; &gt; Well, I can say from personal experience driving on highways where
&gt; &gt; STKR/KRETP is either not codified into law or else generally ignored by
&gt; &gt; all motorists, that &quot;traffic weaving&quot; while certainly an undesirable
&gt; &gt; behavior from an overall safety standpoint, often does offer real benefits
&gt; &gt; to an individual motorist by allowing him to break free from a slow-moving

I don't really like that reference since it just repeats the

85th percentile "rule."
http://www.usroads.com/journals/aruj/9709/ru970901.htm is a

The conclusion I draw from these studies is that people are
going to drive a certain speed no matter how the speed limts
are set. This being the case, speed limits have little
effect on safety. However, this is not the same as saying
that if people actaully obeyed speed limts, there would not
be a safety improvement.

&gt; &lt;snip&gt;

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Can we at least agree that KRETP is a good principle and is
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;conducive
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;to faster yet safer traffic flow?

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I do not believe that. In some areas yes. In urban areas I think
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;exactly
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;opposite is true. Think of it this way. Driver A is going 55 MPH.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;He
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;has
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;to
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;stay in the right lane until he is a mile from his left exit.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Well, personally I feel that left exits are the exits of the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;beast...

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Yea but they are a big part of the highway system in Virginia.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;simply bad engineering IMHO.  Causes problems that shouldn't exist.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Or could it be we need to change the way we think about lane useage.

&gt;&gt; &gt; I agree, but not necessarily in the way that you are thinking.  I think
&gt;&gt; &gt; it's time to move back to the original ideas of lane discipline that
&gt;&gt; &gt; were
&gt;&gt; &gt; always codified into law and let lapse due to the Claybrookian
&gt;&gt; &gt; mentality
&gt;&gt; &gt; that took over in the mid-70s.

&gt;&gt; &gt; Let's look at it from a purely pragmatic standpoint.  Whether or not
&gt;&gt; &gt; you
&gt;&gt; &gt; agree with our current speed limits, I hope that you agree with me that
&gt;&gt; &gt; it
&gt;&gt; &gt; is the place of the police to enforce them, and it is the primary
&gt;&gt; &gt; responsibility of each driver to drive in a safe and courteous manner.
&gt;&gt; &gt; So
&gt;&gt; &gt; therefore there's really no place on the roads for drivers deliberately
&gt;&gt; &gt; acting in such a way as to impede the movement of other drivers, no
&gt;&gt; &gt; matter
&gt;&gt; &gt; what their motives.

&gt;&gt; Are you referring to obeying the speed limit as impeding the movement of
&gt;&gt; other drivers? If so we are miles apart.

&gt; Not at all.  I'm referring to impeding the movement of other drivers,
&gt; completely independently of speed.

&gt;&gt; &gt; Secondly, no matter what the speed limits are, and regardless of
&gt;&gt; &gt; whether
&gt;&gt; &gt; or not the majority of the drivers on a given multi-lane road obey
&gt;&gt; &gt; them,
&gt;&gt; &gt; it is a simple fact of life that there will always be speed
&gt;&gt; &gt; differentials
&gt;&gt; &gt; between different drivers.  There will always be a slow moving truck,
&gt;&gt; &gt; say... even if all drivers on a road are attempting to drive at exactly
&gt;&gt; &gt; the speed limit, there will be variations in speed - due to speedometer
&gt;&gt; &gt; error, someone installing non-OEM size tires on their car without
&gt;&gt; &gt; understanding the implications, whatever.

&gt;&gt; ok

&gt;&gt; &gt; So, we have an inescapable fact that no matter what else we do, we are
&gt;&gt; &gt; going to have vehicles traveling at different speeds interacting with
&gt;&gt; &gt; each
&gt;&gt; &gt; other.  Therefore, we have to have a set of rules so that each driver
&gt;&gt; &gt; clearly understands his or her responsibilities as to how to interact
&gt;&gt; &gt; with
&gt;&gt; &gt; other traffic, and likewise be able to expect other traffic to act in a
&gt;&gt; &gt; predictable manner to allow them to plan their moves ahead of time
&gt;&gt; &gt; rather
&gt;&gt; &gt; than being purely reactive to other traffic.

&gt;&gt; true, to an extent anyway.

&gt;&gt; &gt; Given all that, the best set of rules that the various people who have
&gt;&gt; &gt; devoted any serious amount to this problem have come up with is STKR
&gt;&gt; &gt; and
&gt;&gt; &gt; KRETP.  (assuming driving on the right hand side of the roadway as we
&gt;&gt; &gt; do
&gt;&gt; &gt; in the US.)  These rules make sense for several reasons:

&gt;&gt; I totally disagree. KRETP laws are an extension of two lane rules applied
&gt;&gt; to
&gt;&gt; multilane highway. Very little thought went into them.

&gt; If so little thought went into them, why are they used in nearly every
&gt; country with a developed highway system (OK, KLETP in countries where
&gt; they drive on the left) as well as most US states?
">

Do you or anyone else have nuimbers to back this claim? I don't measn to
sound arguementitive I am just curious.

Why is driving so

It is not.

(I realize that as a regular

&gt; driving a large or heavily loaded truck, or because the locals had lead
&gt; feet.  Heck, I lived in Michigan for about a year :)  I still prefer
&gt; KRETP even in those situations.)
">

While we are clearing up assumptions. I think it is reasonable to keep very
slow traffic to one side of the road. Or even outlaw it on certain roads. I
don't think that means people obeying the speed limit, should have to go out
of their way, to accommodate people, who ignore it. If you don't like speed
limits fine. Work with the legislator to get them changed. Please don't get
mad at the people who choose to obey them, no matter what lane they are in.

&gt;&gt; &gt; 1) On a limited access roadway, traffic generally exits and enters on
&gt;&gt; &gt; the
&gt;&gt; &gt; right.  Therefore, it makes sense to try to stratify the flow of
&gt;&gt; &gt; traffic
&gt;&gt; &gt; so that the slowest traffic ends up in the rightmost lanes so that
&gt;&gt; &gt; vehicles to not have to accelerate or brake excessively to enter the
&gt;&gt; &gt; flow
&gt;&gt; &gt; of traffic.

&gt;&gt; No it doesn't. It may be how you were taught to drive, but it actually
&gt;&gt; makes
&gt;&gt; very little sense to put as much traffic as possible at the merge points.

&gt; Why would it be &quot;as much traffic as possible?&quot;  Generally the
&gt; distribution of speed on a freeway conforms to a bell curve, therefore
&gt; on a six lane freeway the majority of traffic would be spending most of
&gt; its time in the *middle* lane.  The rightmost lane will have a lot of
&gt; the heavy trucks and slower drivers, but the majority of traffic will
&gt; be passing them.
">

wouldn't itmake more sense if those heavy trucks could just drive at one
speed and not have to worry about people trying to merge onto the highway
with them. On a six lane (with KRETP laws in effect) they should be in the
second and third lanes from the right.

&gt;&gt; &gt; 2) Since the slowest traffic ought to be on the right, by necessity
&gt;&gt; &gt; traffic wishing to pass must do so to the left of slower traffic.  It
&gt;&gt; &gt; makes no sense to have a different rule for the rightmost lane than any
&gt;&gt; &gt; other, so it is logical to extend this to all lanes.

&gt;&gt; It isn't logical at all. It is what you were taught. If you want to be
&gt;&gt; logical the best thing to do would be put most of the traffic in the left
&gt;&gt; and center lane. Use the right most lane for people entering and exiting.

&gt; Thus creating the typical condition commonly seen around here where
&gt; people merge onto the freeway at below the normal travel speed, and
&gt; immediately changing lanes to the left while still not up to speed.
&gt; Hilarity ensues.  The closest I've ever come to stacking up my car on a
&gt; freeway happened on an almost-deserted road, where I encountered two of

Don't I know it. I hate it when they try to pass while entering the highway.

&gt;&gt; &gt; 3) In the interest of efficient traffic flow, it makes sense that
&gt;&gt; &gt; slower
&gt;&gt; &gt; traffic should yield to faster traffic, until such time as all lanes
&gt;&gt; &gt; are
&gt;&gt; &gt; fully utilized.

&gt;&gt; Why? It seems to me that faster traffic should yeild to slower traffic,
&gt;&gt; unless the slower traffic is slow to the point, of being less than a
&gt;&gt; predetermined speed.

&gt; KISS.  When something works well, why add complexity to it?  And who
&gt; determines what that predetermined speed is, anyway?  KRETP/STKR works
&gt; no matter what speed the drivers involved are traveling; your method
&gt; leaves a lot up to the interpretation of what an appropriate speed is
&gt; for the drivers involved, often leading to conflict.

&gt;&gt; This is also an extension of right lane behavior, where
&gt;&gt; &gt; traffic merging in is required to yield to through traffic.  Thus,
&gt;&gt; &gt; applying this rule across the entire roadway simply states that one
&gt;&gt; &gt; cannot
&gt;&gt; &gt; change lanes to the left if one will impede an approaching vehicle by
&gt;&gt; &gt; doing so.

&gt;&gt; True but these rules also assume that the traffic on the highway is
&gt;&gt; traveling at the speed limit. Entering traffic should enter at the speed
&gt;&gt; limit or close to it. Than if necessary slow down slightly to fit into
&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt; stream, or speed up to stay in front of it.

&gt; No, it assumes no such thing.  Although I do agree with your assessment
&gt; of how to merge properly when traffic is flowing at or near the speed
&gt; limit.

&gt;&gt; &gt; 4) Once you have accepted the three points above, by necessity to
&gt;&gt; &gt; accomplish the goals set forth in 1) and 3), you end up with (drum roll
&gt;&gt; &gt; please) STKR/KRETP.

&gt;&gt; Well you certainly did a good job of describing the mindset that left
&gt;&gt; several states with these silly laws.

&gt; Why thank you, but a significant number of people who have spent a lot
&gt; of time thinking about and studying such things don't agree with you
&gt; that those laws are &quot;silly.&quot;

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Than he has to
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;go 10 MPH faster than all the other cars in his lane. How do you do
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;that?
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Answer you slow down until you have enough space in front of you to
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;speed
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;up
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;ten miles per hour than change lanes.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;...for exactly that reason.  Right exits don't have this problem.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Fortunately most people understand they are supposed to obey the law.

&gt;&gt;&gt;by
&gt;&gt;&gt;bureaucrats not our elected legislators. We, and the Va State Police,

&gt;&gt;&gt;and
&gt;&gt;&gt;becoming &quot;rocks in the stream&quot;.  But you and most LEOs find these laws

&gt;&gt; . The biggest opponents to lane restrictions is VDOT. The roads are

&gt;&gt; redesign the roads in Virginia just so our laws would reflect out dated

&gt; I think you meant to say that some of your engineers really bagged their

&gt;&gt; A far better approach would be (for everyone) to do away with the whole
&gt;&gt; notion that certain lanes should be reserved, for faster moving cars.
&gt;&gt;     No matter I would like to thank you for recognizing that these laws
&gt;&gt; don't exist in Virginia. So many people who are opposed to them refuse to
&gt;&gt; even consider that they are not a part of the COV. Obviosly you are

&gt; *EFFECTIVELY* do not exist.  It's like laws against oral sex, etc. They're

I took your statement about you trying to get the laws passed to mean you
knew what they said. Sorry. Virginia has no (state wide) laws that require
people who are drive at or very near the speed limit, to limit their lane

&gt;&gt; In Virginia illegal speeds are not considered normal.

First off let me apoligise to members of any group that is is cross posted

be made up of mainly law enforcement personel so we could talk about issues
pretaining to our work, and help motorists with questions about laws.

Now back to our discussion.

Prove it with a cite.
§ 46.2-823. Unlawful speed forfeits right-of-way.

The driver of any vehicle traveling at an unlawful speed shall forfeit any
right-of-way which he might otherwise have under this article.

So when you read the above article while it doesn't exactly say speeding is
not normal. It certainly does clear up any misconceptions, that any of the
traffic laws should be read to mean speeders are given special privileges.

A moment for a political ad:

An opinion by someone...

"DonQuixote is someone who recognizes that the country/world we inhabit

could be so much better. He recognizes that most of those with means
have a vested interest in maintaining the status quo, and have the
power and resources to do so while holding forth a facade of being an
advocate for change.

This country needs a catalyst. A kick in the ass. A slap in the face.
We have the resources to truly guide the world, but our leaders on both

sides of the aisle choose to squander them on ideology and greed. We
try to cure cancer with Neosporin and bandaids, when what we need is
some good invasive surgery."

Thanks. You put it so well that I feel like a surgeon, scalpel at the

That would be a fundamentally true statement, barring enforcement
"blitzes" or similar.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; This being the case, speed limits have little
&gt; effect on safety.
">

Eh, somewhat.  There is always a subset of people who will always obey
the speed limit, no matter whether it's reasonable or not.  In the case
of an underposted limit, this will actually have a safety-detrimental
effect of *increasing* speed differentials.  However, this effect is
probably very slight overall.  Additionally, let's say that the 85th
percentile speed of a road is 75 MPH.  If it's posted at 55 MPH but a
particular driver's personal comfort speed on that road is 80 MPH, he
will likely drive 80 MPH.  He's certainly not going to drive 55 (since
nobody else is anyway.)  However, if the road is posted at 75 MPH, he
may be more likely to obey the limit, since slowing down by 5 MPH is
not that big of a sacrifice (as opposed to slowing by 25 MPH.)  Again,
this has the overall effect of decreasing speed differentials, which is
a positive thing.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; However, this is not the same as saying
&gt; that if people actaully obeyed speed limts, there would not
&gt; be a safety improvement.
">

That is debatable, and also pretty much purely an academic question, as
there aren't enough police (and won't be) to ever make that a reality.
Until the risk of each individual driver getting a ticket is high
enough, people simply aren't going to obey non-85th percentile limits.

Unfortunately - or maybe fortunately for my sanity - my own '55 is so
far from being show ready that it's futile to even try to take both

The 46.2 part refers to *title* 46.2.
The 8xx part refers to *chapter* 8.

The last 2 numbers refer to articles.  The ten's digit, in some cases,
refer to a series of articles.

46.2-82x series deals with right of way at intersections, roundabouts,
and merge points.

46.2-83x deals with heeding signage and traffic control devices (at
least through 835.

46.4-84x deals with overtaking (at least the first 4 parts)

46.4-85x deals with forms of reckless driving.

Since 46.2-823 falls under the section dealing with intersection right
of way, that's what it applies to (since the text of the law itself
states "...he might otherwise have under this *article*."

Had that particular (sub)article stated "...under this *chapter*," then
your interpretation would be correct.  IOW, the law you cited has
nothing to do with yielding the passing lane (IOW, any other lane
besides the right most lane on a multilane highway), when the vehicle
behind signals as much.

The state of California tried special reserved lanes for car pools. If
two or three persons car pooled, they could drive in their own special
diamond lane and get to work several minutes quicker. But very few
drivers were willing to leave their car at home and give up their
independence. So most drivers wound up angrily driving in stop and go
traffic, or just sitting in their car fuming about the guy in front of
them who was blocking their passage. California has just about given up
on the notion of special reserved lanes for any vehicle, and are
studying converting the diamond lanes into just another lane of
traffic. This would raise the traffic throughput per hour by 15 to 20%,
but the lane discipline kooks will still think it's *their* lane and

&gt; better yet, laser tattoo the number on the forehead or palm so it only

Don't you think you are overreacting just a little bit? Every state has a
drivers license. They appear different in each state but you can use them in
any state. If you are so for state rights (if that is what it is) how about
if we make it a law that you have to apply for a different drivers license
in each state you drive in. Or would that be too inconvenient

I never said it is or should be about easy or convenient. I only asked what
is wrong with standardizing ID cards and drivers licenses? It isn't only
cops who use them. It is clerks at store who check ID's when they sell beer

wouoldn't you want it easy to tell that person wasn't you when they cash

&gt;&gt; Do you or anyone else have nuimbers to back this claim? I don't measn to

&gt; I don't mind the question at all, will have to respond to it (as well

&gt; pick up the ball in the meantime.  I'm currently cleaning out my office

&gt; Unfortunately - or maybe fortunately for my sanity - my own '55 is so
&gt; far from being show ready that it's futile to even try to take both

&gt; incidentals are keeping me a little busy to go link-hunting at the
&gt; moment.  You have seen John Carr's summary of the various US laws
&gt; haven't you?  In any case, even though we disagree, I'm glad to keep

Sounds great. Good luck at the show. Someday my 59 ford will be ready for

It's not change in subject.  Just look at the TOC of Title 46.2 chapter
8 and see for yourself.  The law you cite is in the 20s.  The law I cite
is in the 40s.  It's obvious that the entire chapter doesn't consist of
one article.

For instance, WV state code is divided into chapters.  Those are
subdivided into articles, and those are further divided into sections.
An example would be §17C-6-1 would be read as chapter 17C, article 6,
section 1.  In Virginia code, §46.2-823 would be read as title 46.2,
chapter 8, article 2, section 3.  Therefore, that particular statute
would apply to any section of article 2 (§46.2-820 through §42.2-829).

Sigh, I will try to explain. Tell me if the words I use are too big for
you and I will try to use little words next time.

A lane on a highway is a space about 10 feet wide, extending to
infinity. It is marked by painted white lines. Everybody in a lane of a
highway is going the same *direction*. The drivers who got onto the
highway first have the privilege to proceed in an orderly manner to
their chosen destination in the lane they choose to drive in. There are
signs that tell the drivers how fast they are allowed to drive. There
are signs that tell the drivers what side of the road to use. It's not
nice to to drive faster than the signs say they can drive. It's not
nice to drive so fast you overtake other cars. It's not nice to follow
another car too closely. It's not nice to honk your horn and flash your
lights or make faces at the other drivers. It's not nice to try to tell
other drivers what they can or cannot do. There are nice police
officers that will stop bad drivers who bother other drivers. There is
a nice judge who will punish drivers who behave badly. I hope you
understood all that I wrote, because the nice police officer and the
nice judge will not believe you when you try to tell them that they
should be spanking the other bad drivers instead of you...

I can change my nickname with every message, as the mood strikes me...

Strange you should call *me* a troll, with a handle like
"Scott en Aztlán". If that isn't a political troll, what is it?

So what if the Mesca once lived in a swamp called "The Place of The
White Heron" in the Colorado river delta and ate frogs and snails? Does
that mean they ever lived along the southern coast of California or
have a claim to it? Wouldn't the Chumash and Dieguenos and Luisenos and
Gabrielenos have a better claim?

The site of the Chumash village across the street from where I lived in
Ojai was also called "The Place of The White Heron", and I used to
crawl around on my hands and knees looking for shell beads there, but I
don't see any Chumash waving Mexican flags and yelling "Viva la Raza!"

The Chicano claim to some resurrected Aztlán taken back from the
Yankees makes about as much sense as eastern Europeans who'd converted
to Judaism and whose ancestors had never lived in Palestine at all
singing about, "Next Year in Jerusalem", and hoping to create a Zionist
state on lands belonging to Palestinians...

Does some fantasy of Aztlan give you the right to be a self-appointed
Parking Lot Prick at shopping centers in Lost Angeles and take picture
of cars parked taking two spaces? I mean, get a life, instead of
putting up a web page about MFFY drivers...

Hasn't anybody ever told you that "Viva Yo!" means MFFY in espanol, or
are you some kind of pocho that wouldn't know that? There was and is
social class stratification in Hispanic culture, just as there was and
is in American culture. The rich people have always believed they could
do as they pleased, whether it was Normans taxing Anglo-Saxon peasants
to the point of starvation, or hidalgos dressing up in armor and raping
Tenochtitlan for the gold they needed to cure a "disease of the
heart"...

Now it's BMW and Mercedes Benz and Lexus drivers improperly parking
their expensive vehicles that they are buying on credit that are the
biggest offense to your sensibilities?

One thing that growing up and going to school with Mexican kids and
dating Mexican girls in California taught me was capital-Respect for
the customs and dignity of other people...

If you had any such respect for the dignity of other drivers, you
wouldn't be involved in any "Lane Discipline" movement, you would
respect the drivers ahead of you and you'd expect the same respect from
them...

But, no, you're probably a pocho, knowing little of such things, and in
your heart you sincerely believe in "Viva Yo!" and MFFY. And that makes
you a hypocrite, Scott en Aztlán...

only seen one California Vehicle Code section that says don't pass if

*real* passing, when you're out on a 2-lane highway and you have to use
the oncoming lane to pass another vehicle. In that case, you better

&gt; Are you for real? The scofflaws speeding at 30 mph over the national
&gt; speed limit most certainly do begrudge law abiding drivers the
&gt; privilege of using the left lane to pass. They believe in their twisted
&gt; little minds that the left lane is their personal and private lane and
&gt; that *anybody* ahead of them shouldn't be there...

&gt; &gt; it's those who hang out there or &quot;pass&quot; without due alacraty that
&gt; &gt; gets people pissed.

&gt; Please quote the Texas &quot;alacraty&quot; (sic transit gloria mundi) law. I've
&gt; only seen one California Vehicle Code section that says don't pass if
&gt; you can't &quot;get 'er done&quot; within 1000 feet. That CVC section relates to
&gt; *real* passing, when you're out on a 2-lane highway and you have to use
&gt; the oncoming lane to pass another vehicle. In that case, you better
&gt; &quot;ger 'er done&quot;, or there will be a bad accident...

&gt; &gt; Passing someone at 3 mph faster than they are going while impeding other
&gt; &gt; vehicles is the major cause of road rage in our country.

&gt; No it is NOT the major cause of road rage in this country. Ignorance
&gt; and disrespect is the cause of road rage. The speeding scofflaw
&gt; overtaking and tailgating and flashing his lights and blowing his horn
&gt; and gesticulating obscenely at the law-abiding driver instigates the
&gt; road rage situation...

&gt; &gt; Pass if you're going to pass. Wait for other cars to pass you if
&gt; &gt; you're unwilling to do what it takes to pass the other car and get
&gt; &gt; back over in no more than 30 seconds.

&gt; That remark is utterly arrogant. Who do you think you are, anyway, some

People who hear me coming up faster behind them on the way in and out of my
office building move to the right to let me pass.  When I hear someone coming up
behind me in the stairwell faster than I, I move to the right to let them pass.
When I'm shopping with my wife, and a young couple are rushing to get out of the
supermarket in time for a movie, we stand to the right to let them pass.

If I'm casually chatting with a friend on the way out of my building, walking
side by side in the corridor, ambling along, and a woman I work with who has
been kept late by her boss is hurrying out the building to get to her daycare to
pick up her children, and wants to avoid a $5 per minute surcharge, I don't
FUCKING BLOCK HER ACCESS TO THE CORRIDOR BECAUSE I WAS FUCKING THERE FIRST.
There's nothing REMOTELY FUCKING PEACEFUL about acting like that.

But then, I'm not a holier-than-thou, never broken an artificially-low speed
limit, always obey the letter of the law even when the letter of the law is
patently bullshit, ASSHOLE like, well, apparently, YOU are.

Why do you act like an asshole on the highway and everywhere else, like
restaurants and banks and supermarkets?

You just like telling everyone else what the fuck to do, I suppose.

Oh, and KKK?  I don't honk, I don't flash my brights, and I don't gesticulate
rudely.  I simply use my vehicle's superior horsepower, superior handling,
superior acceleration, superior tires, superior steering, and my own superior
vehicular control to smoothly and cleanly leave you behind, without you ever
having to stop scratching your ass, picking your nose, talking on your cell
phone, adjusting your radio, listen intently to your wife complain about how you
couldn't get it up the night before, or any of the myriad other things that are
obviously polluting your mind rather than grasping the first INKLING of how to
drive properly.

Of course, many of your so-called "law-abiding drivers staying in line, waiting
their turn, obeying the rules, and peacefully sharing the road with drivers who
were there first" honk, flash their brights, gesticulate rudely, and otherwise
show their ASSES in public AFTER I've passed them.

It's not their fault, though.  They didn't expect to be AWAKENED between the
time they left point A and arrived at point B.

There's a lane discipline everywhere in Europe and far less road rage.

THE LAW OF THE JUNGLE RULES ON AMERICAN ROADS, TYPICAL OF A BANANA
REPUBLIC.

"On the Autoroutes (inter-state highways) stay out of the Left Lane!
Most Americans are terrible at maintaining right-lane discipline:  i.e.
keeping right except to pass.  Europe is just the opposite.  Cars
should only be traveling the right lane to pass, AND if a faster car is
approaching from behind , you should get into the left lane ASAP.
Police also enforce right-lane discipline."

Young Morrow fears that he will not enhance his pile of material

Superiority! What a concept coming from one who works for others in a
bureaucratic hierarchy! Such anger comes from Young Morrow! Such an
anally agressive fantasy!

You've never seen me, never seen me drive, and probably never will see
me. So, what makes *you* the Autocrat of Automotive Manners, Young
Morrow? Another fantasy, I suppose...

I'm not a bit surprised that law abiding motorists would react angrily
to your rude highway behavior. Probably the only reason that you don't
get bitch-slapped when you childishly run in the hallways at work is
that your co-workers are resigned to your rudeness and don't want a
confrontation that might result in all involved parties getting fired
because the boss doesn't know who is right or wrong, he'll just warn
everybody that they will be fired if they don't behave, and they will
keep misbehaving until somebody is eliminated from the situation...

So, here is Young Morrow, caught on a commuter treadmill. He gets up
early in the morning and rushes to work because he'll lose his job if
he's late too often...

Young Morrow's life is not in his control, he is controlled by others,
who are telling him what to do, where to go, or who to talk to. Other
people are even telling him *what* he should talk about and *when* to
talk about it...

The boss is in the same situation as Young Morrow. The boss has an
office where he's expected to stay, and Young Morrow has his cubicle
where the boss expects him to remain and be quiet, not making any
problems for the boss. Both spend their idle time e-mailing friends or
writing message to Kooknet...

Young Morrow deals with difficult situations all day, and finally the
big hand of the office clock rolls around to quitting time and he's
released from the confines of his cubicle where he's been typing to
newsgroups all day...

He runs in the hallways, and runs on the stairs and finally gets to the
single aspect of his life where he feels like he's in control of
*something*. That's his car or motorbike, be it ever so humble, it's
his castle, and he expresses himself and vents his anger upon any
law-abiding motorist who gets in his way...

And Young Morrow doesn't understand that most of the other drivers on
the road are
under similar pressures at work and at home. But they just don't
express their inner rage over their impotence at work and at home...

They don't do that on the highways, they save it for a private session
with their wife, who says, "Why are you dumping all this rage on me, I
have enough problems with the kids."

Or maybe they pay a psychologist for counseling, and the psychologist
tells them to quit worrying about what their coworkers and boss are
doing at work and what the other drivers on the freeway are doing that
upsets them so much. The psychologist tells them that it's just no use
worrying about things that aren't in their control...

Sometimes it's therapeutic and relaxing to just merge with the common
herd, stay in line, wait your turn, be quiet and just behave yourself.
I remember times when I was so mellow, driving my van, without a care
in the world...

Get mellow, Young Morrow. You don't need drugs or booze. Mellow is a
state of mind. It's bliss and it's free inside your own head...

After a while, you just don't *care* what the other drivers are doing,
you obey the laws because you don't attract any attention to yourself,
and you go where you want to go and you get back home and you don't
have anything to dump onto total strangers reading some Kooknet
newsgroup...

&gt; that your co-workers are resigned to your rudeness and don't want a
&gt; confrontation that might result in all involved parties getting fired
&gt; because the boss doesn't know who is right or wrong, he'll just warn
&gt; everybody that they will be fired if they don't behave, and they will
&gt; keep misbehaving until somebody is eliminated from the situation...

&gt; So, here is Young Morrow, caught on a commuter treadmill. He gets up
&gt; early in the morning and rushes to work because he'll lose his job if
&gt; he's late too often...

&gt; Young Morrow's life is not in his control, he is controlled by others,
&gt; who are telling him what to do, where to go, or who to talk to. Other
&gt; people are even telling him *what* he should talk about and *when* to
&gt; talk about it...

&gt; The boss is in the same situation as Young Morrow. The boss has an
&gt; office where he's expected to stay, and Young Morrow has his cubicle
&gt; where the boss expects him to remain and be quiet, not making any
&gt; problems for the boss. Both spend their idle time e-mailing friends or
&gt; writing message to Kooknet...

&gt; Young Morrow deals with difficult situations all day, and finally the
&gt; big hand of the office clock rolls around to quitting time and he's
&gt; released from the confines of his cubicle where he's been typing to
&gt; newsgroups all day...

&gt; He runs in the hallways, and runs on the stairs and finally gets to the
&gt; single aspect of his life where he feels like he's in control of
&gt; *something*. That's his car or motorbike, be it ever so humble, it's
&gt; his castle, and he expresses himself and vents his anger upon any
&gt; law-abiding motorist who gets in his way...

&gt; And Young Morrow doesn't understand that most of the other drivers on
&gt; the road are
&gt; under similar pressures at work and at home. But they just don't
&gt; express their inner rage over their impotence at work and at home...

&gt; They don't do that on the highways, they save it for a private session
&gt; with their wife, who says, &quot;Why are you dumping all this rage on me, I
&gt; have enough problems with the kids.&quot;

&gt; Or maybe they pay a psychologist for counseling, and the psychologist
&gt; tells them to quit worrying about what their coworkers and boss are
&gt; doing at work and what the other drivers on the freeway are doing that
&gt; upsets them so much. The psychologist tells them that it's just no use
&gt; worrying about things that aren't in their control...

&gt; Sometimes it's therapeutic and relaxing to just merge with the common
&gt; herd, stay in line, wait your turn, be quiet and just behave yourself.
&gt; I remember times when I was so mellow, driving my van, without a care
&gt; in the world...

&gt; Get mellow, Young Morrow. You don't need drugs or booze. Mellow is a
&gt; state of mind. It's bliss and it's free inside your own head...

&gt; After a while, you just don't *care* what the other drivers are doing,
&gt; you obey the laws because you don't attract any attention to yourself,
&gt; and you go where you want to go and you get back home and you don't
&gt; have anything to dump onto total strangers reading some Kooknet
&gt; newsgroup...

&gt; This message has been brought to you by a Karing Karmic Kritter who
&gt; does not seek to Kontrol other people, only to help them find their
&gt; place in an apparently chaotic universe and to simply *be in harmony*
&gt; with it and with others...
">

Wow.  Thanks for thinking of me as "young"!

Also, thanks for not addressing any part of my observations in any substantive
way, instead sinking to personal attacks, thus destroying any hope of
counteracting the complete demolishment of your idiotic "case."

Virginia Code:

§ 46.2-842. Driver to give way to overtaking vehicle.

Except when overtaking and passing on the right is permitted, the driver of an
overtaken vehicle shall give way to the right in favor of the overtaking vehicle
on audible signal and shall not increase the speed of his vehicle until
completely passed by the overtaking vehicle.

§ 46.2-804. Special regulations applicable on highways laned for traffic.

Whenever any roadway has been divided into clearly marked lanes for traffic,
drivers of vehicles shall obey the following:

1. Any vehicle proceeding at less than the normal speed of traffic at the time
and place and under the conditions existing, shall be driven in the lane nearest
the right edge or right curb of the highway when such lane is available for
travel except when overtaking and passing another vehicle or in preparation for
a left turn or where right lanes are reserved for slow-moving traffic as
permitted in this section;

So shut up and move over..... in Virginia.

California has the same law. That's been around since the 1950's when
some drivers objected to being passed by speeders and speeded up to
block the overtaking vehicle. Very dangerous business when a scofflaw
speeder tries to pass a law-abiding citizen and that citizen tries to
take the law into his own hands. Both are wrong in that situation, and
one might be dead if somebody doesn't yield to the other driver...

But, if there is a left lane and a right lane, and passing is permitted
on the right, it becomes obvious that the law-abiding overtaken vehicle
doesn't have to move over for the overtaking vehicle. The Lane
Discipline Nazis want the law-abiding driver out of the left lane,
under any feeble pretense, like Young Morrow has offered in citing VC
§ 46.2-842...

California has the same law. It hinges on whether scofflaws speeding is
somehow "normal". California does not define "normal speed". California
defines the maximum speed limits on highways as 65 or 70 mph, on state
highways as 55 mph,
in city limits, around schools, or senior centers the prima facie speed
is 25 mph (or higher as posted), and the prima facie speed when
crossing a railroad track or side street where traffic cannot be seen
for 100 feet, or in an alley, the limit is 15 mph. Virginia vehicle
code probably agrees with this too...

Intimidate readers?   No, I leave that to the netkooks who like to make up all
kinds of imaginary characteristics of people to whom they respond, since they
can't argue their own case on its merits.

For a counter example, see Scott Kozel's response.  No character assassination,
no idiotic imagining what my life is like (although, if you had the brains to
follow a few links, there's very little imagination required)  just a
thoughtful, researched response that calls my argument into serious question.

Hey.  I'll be thinking about Scott's response.   Yours is simply grist for the
laughter mill.

Please try to understand why Gardensman thinks like he does.  It makes
perfect sense to him.

Cops, like the rest of us, want promotions and bigger saleries, but every
police department in a bureaucracy so there are only two ways to get them -
wait for your boss to retire and hope to beat 12 other cops out of his job
or GROW the department. For every XX new cops a new sergeant billet opens,
then a lieutenant and captain - even the chief gets a raise. So the prime
goal of every cop shop is growth.

Nothing creates a cry for more cops than a crime wave, but a high traffic
death rate helps. So smart cops avoid doing anything to deter crime or
prevent fatal accidents - but they have to look busy and generate some
income. So they write lots of speeding tickets because they know that speed
limits are too low so ticketing speeders wont cut fatalities. They ignore
real hazardous driving cuz it will reduce deaths and, by concentrating on
traffic, they encourage crime, especially violent crime. Hey, a good serial
rapist can get cops promoted and you'll never catch him if you're busy
running a radar trap!  War on Drugs? Most crime is drug related. A cop's
worst nightmare is winning the WOD or worse, legalization. Jeeze, look how
many cops, judges, lawyers, et al would have to find honest jobs.  Best
stick to speeders!

Lane hogs are gardenman's best friends.  They make others do crazy things

Yeah. There is the "Basic Speed Law," which is a speed you may not
exceed, but all others are set arbitrarily. There are supposed to be
surveys taken, which should determine a safe speed, but the actual
posted limits may differ from that. You can contest a ticket based on
the lack of a survey or what the survey says.

Well, I'm not going to bother actually looking up the fine for
exceeding the
prima facie speed limit in, say, a school zone in Kalifornia when the
kiddies are going to or from school. But, by the time Hizzoner and the
court clerk has added the mandatory 200% penalty assessment, your Levis
are going to be lighter by about at least $300.

That's for the first offense. The law has a way of grinding on you
until you comply...

You could give your $300 to a lawyer and he might be able to dig up
some "competent evidence" that shows it really *was* safe to go
blasting through a school zone at whatever speed you found to be
exciting...

One way or another, you're going to pay for that error in judgement...

You could try what "Lay 'er down" Phil Scott is doing. He's in the
appeal process over a ticket where the cop claimed he was exceeding the
speed limit in a tunnel in Frisco. 64 in a 55. Now he's *hoping* the
judges will find for him and award him the $350 he's spent fighting the
"prima facie" speed limit, claiming that it's not safe to do anything
except ride with the
"flow of traffic" when you're on a motorbike.

Any fool knows that. But, The Law Is An Ass...

It's taken Scott six months and many hours of preparation and several
courtroom appearances to get him to the point where he has a
vanishingly small chance of getting his bail money back, plus
expenses...

I could tell you the relevent CVC sections where the prima facie limit
can be contested with "competent evidence", but the debaters of how
many angels can dance on the head of a pin would have a shit orgasm
arguing the applicability of the CVC sections and how it meant they
could always drive as fast as they pleased, anywhere they pleased and
they would always have a "Get Out Of Jail Free" card because they knew
about "competent evidence"...

If they want to play the Game of Justice, they are going to have to
Ante Up.
Justice isn't free...

I gave up on arguing cases in court many years ago. It's easier to obey
the laws, however unfair they may seem, avoid the citation, and focus
on other priorities. And I can spend the fine money or the lawyer's
fees on something I can enjoy...

Nothing in the chapter says they are separate from each other or attached to

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;We have a SS# to do that job. Perhaps having 50 different licences
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;makes for a more bureaucratic Gestadtspolizei.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I think having 50 differantlicenses and ID cards is insain. Why not have
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;one card that is the same everywhere? Even if they are still issued by
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the states.

&gt;&gt;&gt;better yet, laser tattoo the number on the forehead or palm so it only

&gt;&gt;&gt;two places! Make the number 2 sets of 3 bracketed with a separation
&gt;&gt;&gt;character... maybe something like a &quot;6&quot; between each set of numbers and

&gt;&gt; Don't you think you are overreacting just a little bit? Every state has a
&gt;&gt; drivers license. They appear different in each state but you can use them
&gt;&gt; in any state. If you are so for state rights (if that is what it is) how
&gt;&gt; about if we make it a law that you have to apply for a different drivers
&gt;&gt; license in each state you drive in. Or would that be too inconvenient

&gt; Not at all. Nationalized ID's are a far cry from national recognition of
&gt; state DL's. I propose that all cops only have authority within their own

">

That's not the point.  The website establishes the 46.2-8xx is referred
to as Title 46.2 Chapter 8.  That leaves the last 2 digits.  Either each
statute is an article in itself or groups of statutes are considered
articles with subsections.  Statute 46.2-8 "23" states that a driver
exceeding the posted limit loses the right of way he otherwise would
have had under this *article.*

I would like to know what article it's referring to.  If each of the xx
numbers (i.e., 23 in this case) is an individual article, then it
wouldn't make much sense since 23 would only be referring to itself (and
it doesn't specify right of way in the text).  If each xx was part of a
group that formed an article, then it makes perfect sense.  In the
latter case, the only question remaining is what group is it in.

If you peruse the TOC of Title 46.2 Chapter 8, you'll see that statutes
are, more or less, grouped by subject.  It stands to reason that if a
particular statute refers to an article, it would be referencing an
article pertaining to the subject heading it falls under.

Even if you don't agree with my interpretation, then please clarify your
position by answering the following two questions:

1. How many articles are in Title 46.2 Chapter 8 of the code of Virginia?
2. Which article does 46.2-823 refer to?

What if

I want to go as fast as possible
I do not want to do criminal things

I want to go at speed limit but people always merging in, esp in
northern virginia with an exit every mileon the rightmost lane. I hit
the breaks every 3 or 4 minutes. To avoid this I go in the next lane,
which pushed the semis from the second lane (from right) to the
third. The law-breaking speeders of all stripes then try to avoid the
semis and other slow traffic by coming after me (and sticking to me).
This is especially true of a 15 mile wide construction zone on either
side of a bridge where the posted speed limit is 50 and I drive at
exactly 50.

Arent the speeders being jerks?

I live in northern va and work in md. commute of 30 miles across teh
wilson bridge. My perspective is this:

I refuse to commit a crime by exceeding the speed limit. However I
want to as fast as possible. Hence I prefer to stay at 55 exactly.
not 54. not 56. I refuse to slow down even 1 mile per hour by moving
to the rightmost lane where people are merging in all the time. Most
of the time I am to be found in the second lane (from right) and on
rare occasions when there is a slow semi in the rightmost lane
driving all traffic to the second, the third lane. Never am I in the
leftmost lane.

Is it not my legal right to go at the speed I chose to? Am I to be
forced to break the law or be called a "Left Lane Blocker" or  "Lane
Hog"? What am I doing wrong?

That was rhetorical.

I made it clear at the outset that I don't tailgate, honk, flash my lights,
gesticulate, shout, or converse with someone who is blocking traffic.  I simply
wait until it is safe to do so, and then pass them.

Otoh, if someone approaches me from behind (walking, riding, or driving) and I'm
in the left lane, I move over and graciously and politely let them pass me.

But then, I'm like that!

West Virginia traffic laws are far better than VA's.  Our interstates
have 70 mph speed limits.  Radar detectors are legal.  We have a 10 mph
cushion law that even applies to out of state roads.  IOW, if a WV
licenced driver is convicted of speeding 10 mph or less over the
corresponding WV limit in another state, the conviction is not reported
to the DMV.  In effect, even I was convicted of driving 80 mph in a 65
mph zone, the violation wouldn't be reported to the DMV.

Then again, I take my chances and use a RD while driving in VA (why get
pulled over in the first place).

&gt; Cops, like the rest of us, want promotions and bigger saleries, but every

&gt; wait for your boss to retire and hope to beat 12 other cops out of his job
&gt; or GROW the department. For every XX new cops a new sergeant billet opens,
&gt; then a lieutenant and captain - even the chief gets a raise. So the prime
&gt; goal of every cop shop is growth.

&gt; Nothing creates a cry for more cops than a crime wave, but a high traffic
&gt; death rate helps. So smart cops avoid doing anything to deter crime or
&gt; prevent fatal accidents - but they have to look busy and generate some
&gt; income. So they write lots of speeding tickets because they know that speed
&gt; limits are too low so ticketing speeders wont cut fatalities. They ignore
&gt; real hazardous driving cuz it will reduce deaths and, by concentrating on
&gt; traffic, they encourage crime, especially violent crime. Hey, a good serial
&gt; rapist can get cops promoted and you'll never catch him if you're busy
&gt; running a radar trap!  War on Drugs? Most crime is drug related. A cop's
&gt; worst nightmare is winning the WOD or worse, legalization. Jeeze, look how
&gt; many cops, judges, lawyers, et al would have to find honest jobs.  Best
&gt; stick to speeders!

&gt; Lane hogs are gardenman's best friends.  They make others do crazy things
&gt; that get them killed and that gets him raises and promotions. And you thot
&gt; he was stupid ........
">

We experience the same "growth" in the parking ticket biz where they
have just expanded the hours of "business" from 8pm to 2am, in an area
where there's simply no business, other than the poor neighbors who
need to park there.

The same process happens in other areas where government growths at the
expense of the jungle. They never find real solutions other than more
income-generating enforcement. We got a HUNGRY LION indeed.

Lets stick to using the definitions in the code and not try to rationalize
using reason or common sense. To the best of my knowledge the traffic
regulations (chapter 8) don't have any subtitles or divisions by articles.
Therefore they would stand alone or be grouped with others. This is
generally referred to as "severed". In other words; If the code says in one
place it is illegal to go over 55 mph, than it is illegal to go over 55 mph
no matter what it might say somewhere else, unless it specifically gives an
exception. A good example would be allowing emergency vehicles to go faster
than the posted speed limits. They get a specific exemption in 46.2-920.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The exact distance depends, of course, on conditions at a given place

&gt;&gt;&gt;he can get in the left lane. The next question is;  if several cars are

&gt;&gt;&gt;for him to just pull in front of the speeder so he does not miss his
&gt;&gt;&gt;exit?

&gt;&gt; He needs to match the speed of the traffic in the lane he's merging
&gt;&gt; into, flip on his turn signal, and then slow back down for the turn.
&gt;&gt; Alternatively, he can wait until all faster traffic has passed and

&gt;&gt; Drivers wishing to merge must yield to traffic already in the lane

&gt; these are stupid questions. merging traffic always has to yield. changing

NO I don't but! If you are on a highway and someone is merging onto it. You
should allow them room to merge. If you are coming up behind them and it is

Duuuuuuuuh you already can't. There's a nationwide "no fly list"
shared amongst all 50 states. It's been that way for ages. You can
only get a license in another state if you have never had a license at
all or a valid license in your home. Suspended/revoked/etc DOES count.

Now as to why federalised points are dumb... America is big. There is
a wide variability in what's considered "law enforcement". Some towns
clearly abuse the process for revenue gain. Some places clearly abuse
out of staters knowing damn well they'll just mail the ticket and be
done with it. Some cops are just real assholes to anyone "not from
around here".

So why should every American place themselves at the mercy of the
lowest common denominator? You wanna burn your clean record because
there's some hick town in podunk you didn't know about that relishes
in giving Yankees the old in-out?

I realize if you're a milequetoast who never strays far from home and

Seat Belt laws
Posted by: rwven on Jun-21-05 6:40 AM (EST)
Fall under this also. Here in MD the State Police get paid overtime
rate to go out and enforce the seat belt law (click-it or ticket). They
would save more lives and prevent more property damage (not to mention
lost time due to left lane bandits and accident related traffic
stoppages) if they would enforce right lane discipline and tailgating
laws. Nah, they'd rather sit somewhere with a coffee and a radar gun
(or a pair of binoculars).

***

hmm
Posted by: Swedge on Jun-21-05 7:05 AM (EST)
Will I disagree on the seatbelt laws. THEY do save lives. I feel
strange when I don't have mine on. Just recently a guy I used to know
was driving 3 drunk friends home, He was the DD, He lost control of his
car and it rolled into a ditch, all 3 of the drunk passengers were
fine, he apparently broke his neck when he hit the roof of the car, he
didn't have his seat belt on, but the passengers did. ON the other
hand as far as Law enforcement goes. What bugs me is the Revenue
enhancement police who's only job is to pump up small back woods
towns with much needed cash by creating artificially slow speed zones.

***

not just binoculars...
Posted by: paddlinunit on Jun-21-05 9:17 AM (EST)
in Rockville &amp; other MD locations, police are using NIGHTVISION
purchased primarily to catch seat belt offenders! WHY?

I believe that seat belts save lives, &amp; I wear one, but I really don't
see why police are focusing on this issue when disregard for moving
traffic laws is so rampant.

How is Dan Deathwish creating a safety risk for others by refusing to
wear his seatbelt? That angry motorist following just inches from my
bumper, now he is posing an immediate safety risk. And so are the
speeders, red light &amp; stop sign runners. But forget about them, the
cops are too busy ticketing seat belt offenders!

Talk about denial.  Traffic studies show that 90% of drivers choose safe
speeds.  That is typically 10+ MPH over the posted limit on most
interstates, and you know it.  Everybody is moving along smoothly and safely
at 10 over when suddenly there is a rock in the stream - some poke doing 5

Sooner or later he'll drive somebody crazy then you can write a nice

I searched the code of Virginia for the word article.  There are a
number of references that give an article number referencing a title
number and chapter along with a link to the actual statute.

For instance, § 46.2-341.20:1 has a reference that reads as follows:

"...including but not limited to the provisions of Article 9 (§ 46.2-884
et seq.) of Chapter 8 of this title..."

So we know that Article 9 starts at statute number 84 in Title 46.2,
Chapter 8.  This confirms that this particular chapter has at least 9
articles.

§ 46.2-802 has a reference that reads as follows:

"...set forth in Article 4 (§ 46.2-837 et seq.) of this chapter."

§ 46.2-860 has a reference that reads as follows:

"...as required by Article 6 (§ 46.2-848 et seq.) of this chapter."

This means that Article 4 starts statute number 37 and Article 6 starts
at statute 48 in Title 46.2, Chapter 8.  This means that 46.2-842.1 must
be in either Article 4 or 5.  This also means that 46.2-823 could not
possibly refer to either of those two articles since that particular
statute is within the first three articles of Chapter 8.

Oh, so now Fat Boy is waffling on his arrogance in telling people that
if they ever come to Virginia, they should just get out his way. He has
a "superior vehicle" with "superior power" and he's a "superior
driver"---in his dreams!

And he thinks he's so-o-o-o courteous, too! Wazzup wif dat?

What makes Fat Boy feel like he's *hot shit on the highway*, anyway?

Let's go back to where courtesy all began, and what it has come to...

In feudal Europe, nobody got anywhere without kissing the king's ass.
The king owned all the land. Period. The king was the big boy, he ruled
by divine right. The king owned all the land, he made his best buddies
into nobles and he let them live on the best land, and the nobles had
the right to screw all the commoner's wives on their wedding night, so
they'd get the first chance at all the virgins. The king had his court,
where the best ass-kissers hung around, hoping they could do the king
or whatever it took to get him to let them have a big estate where they
could lord it over the serfs. And the king was surrounded by a bunch of
women who would put out for him, and please him in any way. The women
at the king's court were called courtesans. They were high priced
whores who did it for diamonds and rubies and pearls. But that's how
courtesy was born.

Over here in the colonies, the Puritans didn't like the idea of anybody
screwing or sucking their way up in social status, at least not
publically. If social climbers were going to enhance their status,
they'd have to do it with the curtains drawn, behind closed doors, in
private. The British were becoming uptight, too, during the Victorian
era...

The emergence of a larger middle class in British and American society
came in the early 1800's, as the industrial revolution and world trade
brought wealth to the more successful small businessmen. Though they
couldn't rise to the status of nobility, they could don the trappings
and affectations of the lords and ladies.
They could behave in a "genteel" manner, with a shallow display of
"courtesy" or "manners", that preserved their wealth and new-found
social status by following such rules as benefitted them personally.
They began to judge others by their dress and material wealth, and by
how others deferred to them in matters of "courtesy", false delicacy
and prudery.

Courtesy then became a way of getting what one wants from another
person without giving anything in return. Modern courtesy is not warm,
caring, or giving behavior, no bodily fluids are exchanged, and in the
end, the modern version of "courtesy" is about taking from others to
preserve and enhance one's own social status or material wealth.

Social revolution is an on-going process, and the middle class
Americans gained wealth that only the nobility of Europe knew 200 years
ago. Louis XIV, the Sun King, would have been awed by the ability of a
tradesman (who wires up burglar alarms or installs satellite dishes for
a living) to flip out a plastic card and make reservations for a
vacation trip to Fiji and then jump onto a jumbo jet and arrive there
in only 18 hours from anyplace on Earth...

College students graduating in the mid-1970's set aside their Viet Nam
war protest
signs with a sigh of relief, thinking, "Wow! That's finally over, I
won't have to go over there and mess up my life in the Army. Now I can
concentrate on the megabucks I'm going to make."

Each individual in modern society seems to believe that he or she is
going to achieve success independantly of everybody else and that their
social status is affirmed by the size of their personal pile of
material wealth and they judge others by their the relative size of
their piles and by how they defer to others...

The emergent "Me Generation" expects to be deferred to in every way.
Their possessions proclaim their unique status. One simply must defer
to the unique gentleperson, mustn't one?

And the manufacturers of consumer products know that the "unique
gentleperson" of the "Me generation" will buy prestige products,
especially if there is a certain air of customization. So the basic
stripped model of
Whatever The Desperately Poor People Drive can also be bought in a
re-badged version with a different name and it costs twice as much and
the "unique gentleperson's" special status is affirmed...

But look at the badge on the hood of the Sporty Special Edition For
Successful Entrepreneurs Only. Doesn't that badge remind you of the
shield of a feudal knight who was once a squire that kissed the ass of
an older knight that had sucked the cock of the king of France in order
to gain his spurs? What does one man do, anyway, when he gets down on
his knees in front of another man, besides give him at least a symbolic
BJ?

So the owner of the Sporty Special Edition For Successful Entrepreneurs
Only has ascended another rung on the social ladder and now he must
only associate with other "unique gentlepersons" of the "Me
Generation". He must subscribe to the special magazine that caters to
"unique gentlepersons". He must read Road&amp;Track, Car and Driver and
Motor Trend and become immersed in the philosophy of how a "unique
gentleperson" should drive and how he should be deferred to by all
those who, for some strange reason do not own their own SSEFSEO.

The "unique gentleperson" must learn to expect deferrence from others
on the highway too, not just from the Desperately Poor Person who
operates the computer at the self service gas station, or from the
Desperately Poor Person that bags his groceries.

The Desperately Poor Person who does his taxes must also genuflect to
him, but the
Police Officer in the black and white patrol car parked along the road
is an unknown quantity. The "unique gentleperson" is unsure about
whether the Police Officer is a Desperately Poor Person or not. The
Police Officer may be a Successful Entrepreneur in disguise. So the
"unique gentleperson" adopts a attitude of courtesy, as he understands
it, towards the cop, asking him, "What seems to be the problem,
officer. I didn't do anything *wrong*, did I?"

The cop goes ahead and write the ticket, and it is transmitted to the
court, and the "unique gentleperson" may boast and bluster about his
status as a "unique gentleperson", deserving of deferrence, and he may
get some modicum of courtesy from the Judge sitting on the bench. But
the "unique gentleperson" may never understand that the trappings of a
feudal society still exist in America. The Judge
is the modern version of a Robber Baron, and the inscrutable Police
Officer is nothing more than a Tax Collector for the Court, sent out on
the highways to fill up the treasury of the County and State...

So, back to Fat Boy, where I started. What makes him so arrogant? He
has a material pile of whatever. So he tells Kooknet what motorbikes he
owns and how to get to sites that tell about his materialistic
lifestyle. Read his webpage and you can see the evolution of his pile
of mass-produced consumer goods that convinced him at least that he had
a certain "savoir faire" in the selection of such status-confirming
goods. He studied up on them and knows all about them, he's an expert
and everybody should be impressed by him---shouldn't they?

No, what he owns doesn't impress me at all. Where he's been doesn't
impress me. What he has in his bank account doesn't impress me. Where
he lives doesn't impress me. What he does for a living doesn't impress
me. What he types to Kooknet impresses me. I'm impressed by his
arrogance and insensitivity to others who might just be reading Usenet
NG's looking for useful information unfiltered by some sense
of his social status as a "unique gentleperson"...

"Prima facie" simply shifts the burden of proof. Fine's the same IIRC. Below

What's justice cost? I was in court to make bail for a bro who'd hit a cop.
Case ahead of his was a huge man who was obviously very angry at the cop
who'd arrested him but was keeping his cool.  Judge listened to both sides
then found for the officer, but told the man he could file an appeal if he'd
wait while they tried Joe's case.

Judge listened to Joe's excuse (drunk) then after admonishing him about
striking a police officer fined him $200.  Whereupon the first men jumped up

A good laugh, that. You'd have no way of knowing this, but Barbara

Nothing really changes, English-speaking peoples of North America have
had some real losers for kings or presidents. My own family left
England during the reign of the House of Stuart, when the crown passed
to them because Elizabeth I was a lifelong virgin.

The text below reminds me of George Bush, and of Tim Morrow, too...

'Our cousin of Scotland' was ugly, awkward, and shuffling both in mind
and person. His tongue was much too large for his mouth, his legs were
much too weak for his body, and his dull goggle-eyes stared and rolled
like an idiot's. He was cunning, covetous, wasteful, idle, drunken,
greedy, dirty, cowardly, a great swearer, and the most conceited man on
earth. His figure - what is commonly called rickety from his birth -
presented a most ridiculous appearance, dressed in thick padded
clothes, as a safeguard against being stabbed (of which he lived in
continual fear), of a grass- green colour from head to foot, with a
hunting-horn dangling at his side instead of a sword, and his hat and
feather sticking over one eye, or hanging on the back of his head, as
he happened to toss it on. He used to loll on the necks of his
favourite courtiers, and slobber their faces, and kiss and pinch their
cheeks; and the greatest favourite he ever had, used to sign himself in
his letters to his royal master, His Majesty's 'dog and slave,' and
used to address his majesty as 'his Sowship.' His majesty was the worst
rider ever seen, and thought himself the best. He was one of the most
impertinent talkers (in the broadest Scotch) ever heard, and boasted of
being unanswerable in all manner of argument. He wrote some of the most
wearisome treatises ever read - among others, a book upon witchcraft,
in which he was a devout believer - and thought himself a prodigy of
authorship. He thought, and wrote, and said, that a king had a right to
make and unmake what laws he pleased, and ought to be accountable to
nobody on earth. This is the plain, true character of the personage
whom the greatest men about the court praised and flattered to that
degree, that I doubt if there be anything much more shameful in the
annals of human nature.---Charles Dickens,
A Child's History of England, Chapter XXXII, England Under James The
First...

I'm afraid they follow you. ;)

I wonder what's the difference by now between aristocracies over there
and wealthy elites over here. They are so close in spirit and purpose,
ie the Coalition of the Willing, if not in their despise for the
underclasses. Actually the little guy may be able to escape better over
there, at least they are not preyed upon that much...

"Unlike in the States where Mr. Policeman will sit / wait / and chase
you down for speeding, this practice is un-common here. There are
police patrols here of course, but you'd have to be doing something
very bad for them to take on a pursuit."

Passing:

You don't 'Pass' cars in England you 'overtake' them.
The only real difference for this in practice is: On American highways
where there is a slowpoke in the middle lane of a 3-lane highway and
you'd pass on either side of him to get around, you're not allowed to
do this here. You're only allowed to 'overtake' from the lane closest
to the median, so when driving on the left in England, that means the
farthest right, or 'fast' lane is the only one allowed for passing.

Speed:

Contrary to what some people might tell you that haven't been here, the
Brits DO measure their speed in Miles Per Hour, not Kilometers. The UK
is the ONLY country in Europe to do so. Even though Ireland drives on
the wrong side of the road too, they measure in Kilometers, but while
in England you'll be at home with MPH.

(Never mind that they sell gas by the liter rather than by the gallon -
generally they are quite a confused nation when it comes to metrics,
more so than the Americans.)

The highway (motorway) speed limit is 70mph, and then it varies right
down to 30mph in built-up city areas.
Unlike in the States where Mr. Policeman will sit / wait / and chase
you down for speeding, this practice is un-common here. There are
police patrols here of course, but you'd have to be doing something
very bad for them to take on a pursuit.

&gt; could lord it over the serfs. And the king was surrounded by a bunch of
&gt; women who would put out for him, and please him in any way. The women
&gt; at the king's court were called courtesans. They were high priced
&gt; whores who did it for diamonds and rubies and pearls. But that's how
&gt; courtesy was born.

&gt; Over here in the colonies, the Puritans didn't like the idea of anybody
&gt; screwing or sucking their way up in social status, at least not
&gt; publically. If social climbers were going to enhance their status,
&gt; they'd have to do it with the curtains drawn, behind closed doors, in
&gt; private. The British were becoming uptight, too, during the Victorian
&gt; era...

&gt; The emergence of a larger middle class in British and American society
&gt; came in the early 1800's, as the industrial revolution and world trade
&gt; brought wealth to the more successful small businessmen. Though they
&gt; couldn't rise to the status of nobility, they could don the trappings
&gt; and affectations of the lords and ladies.
&gt; They could behave in a &quot;genteel&quot; manner, with a shallow display of
&gt; &quot;courtesy&quot; or &quot;manners&quot;, that preserved their wealth and new-found
&gt; social status by following such rules as benefitted them personally.
&gt; They began to judge others by their dress and material wealth, and by
&gt; how others deferred to them in matters of &quot;courtesy&quot;, false delicacy
&gt; and prudery.

&gt; Courtesy then became a way of getting what one wants from another
&gt; person without giving anything in return. Modern courtesy is not warm,
&gt; caring, or giving behavior, no bodily fluids are exchanged, and in the
&gt; end, the modern version of &quot;courtesy&quot; is about taking from others to
&gt; preserve and enhance one's own social status or material wealth.

&gt; Social revolution is an on-going process, and the middle class
&gt; Americans gained wealth that only the nobility of Europe knew 200 years
&gt; ago. Louis XIV, the Sun King, would have been awed by the ability of a
&gt; tradesman (who wires up burglar alarms or installs satellite dishes for
&gt; a living) to flip out a plastic card and make reservations for a
&gt; vacation trip to Fiji and then jump onto a jumbo jet and arrive there
&gt; in only 18 hours from anyplace on Earth...

&gt; College students graduating in the mid-1970's set aside their Viet Nam
&gt; war protest
&gt; signs with a sigh of relief, thinking, &quot;Wow! That's finally over, I
&gt; won't have to go over there and mess up my life in the Army. Now I can
&gt; concentrate on the megabucks I'm going to make.&quot;

&gt; Each individual in modern society seems to believe that he or she is
&gt; going to achieve success independantly of everybody else and that their
&gt; social status is affirmed by the size of their personal pile of
&gt; material wealth and they judge others by their the relative size of
&gt; their piles and by how they defer to others...

&gt; The emergent &quot;Me Generation&quot; expects to be deferred to in every way.
&gt; Their possessions proclaim their unique status. One simply must defer
&gt; to the unique gentleperson, mustn't one?

&gt; And the manufacturers of consumer products know that the &quot;unique
&gt; gentleperson&quot; of the &quot;Me generation&quot; will buy prestige products,
&gt; especially if there is a certain air of customization. So the basic
&gt; stripped model of
&gt; Whatever The Desperately Poor People Drive can also be bought in a
&gt; re-badged version with a different name and it costs twice as much and
&gt; the &quot;unique gentleperson's&quot; special status is affirmed...

&gt; But look at the badge on the hood of the Sporty Special Edition For
&gt; Successful Entrepreneurs Only. Doesn't that badge remind you of the
&gt; shield of a feudal knight who was once a squire that kissed the ass of
&gt; an older knight that had sucked the cock of the king of France in order
&gt; to gain his spurs? What does one man do, anyway, when he gets down on
&gt; his knees in front of another man, besides give him at least a symbolic
&gt; BJ?

&gt; So the owner of the Sporty Special Edition For Successful Entrepreneurs
&gt; Only has ascended another rung on the social ladder and now he must
&gt; only associate with other &quot;unique gentlepersons&quot; of the &quot;Me
&gt; Generation&quot;. He must subscribe to the special magazine that caters to
&gt; &quot;unique gentlepersons&quot;. He must read Road&amp;Track, Car and Driver and
&gt; Motor Trend and become immersed in the philosophy of how a &quot;unique
&gt; gentleperson&quot; should drive and how he should be deferred to by all
&gt; those who, for some strange reason do not own their own SSEFSEO.

&gt; The &quot;unique gentleperson&quot; must learn to expect deferrence from others
&gt; on the highway too, not just from the Desperately Poor Person who
&gt; operates the computer at the self service gas station, or from the
&gt; Desperately Poor Person that bags his groceries.

&gt; The Desperately Poor Person who does his taxes must also genuflect to
&gt; him, but the
&gt; Police Officer in the black and white patrol car parked along the road
&gt; is an unknown quantity. The &quot;unique gentleperson&quot; is unsure about
&gt; whether the Police Officer is a Desperately Poor Person or not. The
&gt; Police Officer may be a Successful Entrepreneur in disguise. So the
&gt; &quot;unique gentleperson&quot; adopts a attitude of courtesy, as he understands
&gt; it, towards the cop, asking him, &quot;What seems to be the problem,
&gt; officer. I didn't do anything *wrong*, did I?&quot;

&gt; The cop goes ahead and write the ticket, and it is transmitted to the
&gt; court, and the &quot;unique gentleperson&quot; may boast and bluster about his
&gt; status as a &quot;unique gentleperson&quot;, deserving of deferrence, and he may
&gt; get some modicum of courtesy from the Judge sitting on the bench. But
&gt; the &quot;unique gentleperson&quot; may never understand that the trappings of a
&gt; feudal society still exist in America. The Judge
&gt; is the modern version of a Robber Baron, and the inscrutable Police
&gt; Officer is nothing more than a Tax Collector for the Court, sent out on
&gt; the highways to fill up the treasury of the County and State...

&gt; So, back to Fat Boy, where I started. What makes him so arrogant? He
&gt; has a material pile of whatever. So he tells Kooknet what motorbikes he
&gt; owns and how to get to sites that tell about his materialistic
&gt; lifestyle. Read his webpage and you can see the evolution of his pile
&gt; of mass-produced consumer goods that convinced him at least that he had
&gt; a certain &quot;savoir faire&quot; in the selection of such status-confirming
&gt; goods. He studied up on them and knows all about them, he's an expert
&gt; and everybody should be impressed by him---shouldn't they?

&gt; No, what he owns doesn't impress me at all. Where he's been doesn't
&gt; impress me. What he has in his bank account doesn't impress me. Where
&gt; he lives doesn't impress me. What he does for a living doesn't impress
&gt; me. What he types to Kooknet impresses me. I'm impressed by his
&gt; arrogance and insensitivity to others who might just be reading Usenet
&gt; NG's looking for useful information unfiltered by some sense
&gt; of his social status as a &quot;unique gentleperson&quot;...

&gt; The text below reminds me of George Bush, and of Tim Morrow, too...

&gt; 'Our cousin of Scotland' was ugly, awkward, and shuffling both in mind
&gt; and person. His tongue was much too large for his mouth, his legs were
&gt; much too weak for his body, and his dull goggle-eyes stared and rolled
&gt; like an idiot's. He was cunning, covetous, wasteful, idle, drunken,
&gt; greedy, dirty, cowardly, a great swearer, and the most conceited man on
&gt; earth. His figure - what is commonly called rickety from his birth -
&gt; presented a most ridiculous appearance, dressed in thick padded
&gt; clothes, as a safeguard against being stabbed (of which he lived in
&gt; continual fear), of a grass- green colour from head to foot, with a
&gt; hunting-horn dangling at his side instead of a sword, and his hat and
&gt; feather sticking over one eye, or hanging on the back of his head, as
&gt; he happened to toss it on. He used to loll on the necks of his
&gt; favourite courtiers, and slobber their faces, and kiss and pinch their
&gt; cheeks; and the greatest favourite he ever had, used to sign himself in
&gt; his letters to his royal master, His Majesty's 'dog and slave,' and
&gt; used to address his majesty as 'his Sowship.' His majesty was the worst
&gt; rider ever seen, and thought himself the best. He was one of the most
&gt; impertinent talkers (in the broadest Scotch) ever heard, and boasted of
&gt; being unanswerable in all manner of argument. He wrote some of the most
&gt; wearisome treatises ever read - among others, a book upon witchcraft,
&gt; in which he was a devout believer - and thought himself a prodigy of
&gt; authorship. He thought, and wrote, and said, that a king had a right to
&gt; make and unmake what laws he pleased, and ought to be accountable to
&gt; nobody on earth. This is the plain, true character of the personage
&gt; whom the greatest men about the court praised and flattered to that
&gt; degree, that I doubt if there be anything much more shameful in the
&gt; annals of human nature.---Charles Dickens,

Oh, yeah.  Waffling.  I went from my original observation of:

"I don't honk, I don't flash my brights, and I don't gesticulate rudely."

To:

"I don't tailgate, honk, flash my lights, gesticulate, shout, or converse with
someone who is blocking traffic.  I simply wait until it is safe to do so, and
then pass them.  Otoh, if someone approaches me from behind (walking, riding, or

That's a real sea change in my position.

A bit of humor in this debate...

"...have you ever driven at/near darwin? Now that's an experience."

Darwin proposed the "survival of the fittest." I think he also proposed
"size matters," though this may have been proposed by his wife. And
both laws fit our roads quite well. ;)

***

"And Mrs. Darwin accepted.....
were there any little Darwin's? Did they grow up to be highway
engineers? Inquiring minds want to know......."

Well, she had doubts about Darwin being the fittest or the biggest, so
she developed interest in another area of natural selection: "Mate
Selection: What Females Really Want."

American roads though would be the ideal place to test all these
theories.

Here's a local (to me) Darwinian turn:

http://home.comcast.net/~alan.s.moore/mc/hwy9_2.jpg

Descending CA Highway 9 southbound towards Boulder Creek, the road
turns about 200 degrees to the right, and the bottom drops out from
under you in the middle of it.  The road a few hundred feet ahead of
me in this picture is about forty feet down, and back over my right
shoulder.

The mapquest picture doesn't really do it justice:
http://tinyurl.com/bcjse

Riders from Kansas often meet an oncoming vehicle in mid turn.

Going the other direction, it's a nice fast turn, unless you've been
following too closely.

Yes sort of. But if you are going faster than is expected slowing down would
be a good idea. The person merging onto the highway usually has a very short
distance to estimate how fast you are going, while he (or she_) is
accelerating to highway speed. So if the speed limit is 55 mph and you are
going 75 mph you should accommodate the other driver and slow down enough to
let them enter the highway.

&gt;&gt; &gt;  So the prime goal of every cop shop is growth.

&gt;&gt; I'm already a Captian

&gt; Then you know how much per shift it costs to keep a car on the street and
&gt; how much ticket revenue each has to average before wasting time on real
&gt; crime.

&gt;&gt; &gt; Nothing creates a cry for more cops than a crime wave, but a high
&gt; traffic
&gt;&gt; &gt; death rate helps. So smart cops avoid doing anything to deter crime or
&gt;&gt; &gt; prevent fatal accidents - but they have to look busy and generate some
&gt;&gt; &gt; income. So they write lots of speeding tickets because they know that
&gt;&gt; &gt; speed limits are too low so ticketing speeders wont cut fatalities.

&gt;&gt; Pure nonsense. Writing speeding tickets reduces speeders....

&gt; Sure, but reducing speeders does NOT reduce violent crime or even traffic
&gt; fatalities. It simply creates capitan billets.

&gt;&gt; They ignore
&gt;&gt; &gt; real hazardous driving cuz it will reduce deaths and, by concentrating
&gt; on
&gt;&gt; &gt; traffic, they encourage crime, especially violent crime.

&gt;&gt; DO you really believe this?

&gt; Absolutely! You yourself admit ignoring lane hogs - a real traffic hazard.

&gt;&gt; The overwhelming majority of cops and judges are extremly honest. The
&gt;&gt; work
&gt;&gt; we do keeps everyone else safe. Maybe if all the criminals got honest
&gt;&gt; jobs
&gt;&gt; we would have to find a new line of work, but that wont happen anytime
&gt; soon.

&gt; Honest? So are politicians. They just have a different morality! Writing
&gt; speeding tickets keeps everyone else safe.  Bwahahaha!

&gt;&gt; &gt; Lane hogs are gardenman's best friends.  They make others do crazy
&gt; things

&gt;&gt; Doing crazy things are the decision of the person who does them.  While
&gt; they
&gt;&gt; often times try to blame others (denial). No one can force you to drive
&gt; like
&gt;&gt; an overbearing jerk. Here is a hint. If someone is in front of you,
&gt; driving
&gt;&gt; at the speed limit and you can't get past them, because of all the
&gt;&gt; traffic
&gt;&gt; around you. You need to slow down. It really isn't everyone else that is
&gt;&gt; crazy, it's you.

&gt; Unless I'm trying to get my sick kid to a hospital, or...., or....., or
&gt; .....

&gt; Talk about denial.  Traffic studies show that 90% of drivers choose safe
&gt; speeds.  That is typically 10+ MPH over the posted limit on most
&gt; interstates, and you know it.  Everybody is moving along smoothly and
&gt; safely
&gt; at 10 over when suddenly there is a rock in the stream - some poke doing 5
&gt; under in the left lane. He's not a problem?  Not to you. He's your buddy.
&gt; Sooner or later he'll drive somebody crazy then you can write a nice
&gt; expensive quota-making ticket, and go eat donuts for awhile - right?

&gt;&gt; Actualy I don't do traffic enforcement.

&gt; I believe that capitans don't do traffic.  They make sure their underlings
&gt; do!  But officers who waste time fighting crime instead of generating
&gt; ticket
&gt; income don't make capitan - right?  Right?
">

I can't even remember the last time I wrote a speeding ticket. I have
nothing to do with traffic enforcement. I haven't done traffic enforcement
in the last 15 years. I wouldn't even know how to turn on a modern day radar
gun. Heck I don't think they even use radar anymore some kind of lazer
thingy. I chase serious bad guys. I take on terrorists and killers and
occasionally get to find lost children. Ok my partner finds em I just fill
out the forms : )  I have never in my life been told, or told someone else,
to write tickets to raise revenues. It never comes up. I became a cop to
fight crime. I didn't do it to become a source of revenue for the government
or anyone else. I take great pride in what I do for a living. I am quite
sure the only time I raise revenues is when I clean up a neighborhood and
local businesses become more profitable and therefore pay more in taxes. But
even than we do it just so we can see little old ladies shopping in stores,
they used to be afraid to drive past.
My personal feeling about speeders and other dangerous drivers is; they
mostly either out grow it or die off. Sure they are annoying to be around
but when it comes down to it I don't really pay much more attention to them
than anyone else. The only time they really bother me is when they tailgate
and I have my partner in the back. That is the reason I take this whole left
lane privilege thing so seriously. So many people think only speeders are
allowed to drive in the left lane. I'm not allowed to get out and shoot them
(anymore). So I come in here and try and talk sense to some of you. Most of
you ignore me or insist that Iam wrong, but at least I am trying.

in places like England and Germany and sharing experiences,
strategies... Perhaps they can send you there and see it with your own
eyes. Perhaps you won't see speeders as monsters any more.

If you do hold contacts on the issue of terrorism, I don't see why not
on the issue of traffic safety. I mean, unless one safety was more
important than the other. And that's the problem with the lion and his
"priorities."

&gt;&gt; Lets stick to using the definitions in the code and not try to

&gt;&gt; traffic regulations (chapter 8) don't have any subtitles or divisions by
&gt;&gt; articles.

&gt; I searched the code of Virginia for the word article.  There are a number
&gt; of references that give an article number referencing a title number and
&gt; chapter along with a link to the actual statute.

&gt; For instance, § 46.2-341.20:1 has a reference that reads as follows:

&gt; &quot;...including but not limited to the provisions of Article 9 (§ 46.2-884
&gt; et seq.) of Chapter 8 of this title...&quot;

&gt; So we know that Article 9 starts at statute number 84 in Title 46.2,
&gt; Chapter 8.  This confirms that this particular chapter has at least 9
&gt; articles.

&gt; § 46.2-802 has a reference that reads as follows:

&gt; &quot;...set forth in Article 4 (§ 46.2-837 et seq.) of this chapter.&quot;

&gt; § 46.2-860 has a reference that reads as follows:

&gt; &quot;...as required by Article 6 (§ 46.2-848 et seq.) of this chapter.&quot;

&gt; This means that Article 4 starts statute number 37 and Article 6 starts at
&gt; statute 48 in Title 46.2, Chapter 8.  This means that 46.2-842.1 must be
&gt; in either Article 4 or 5.  This also means that 46.2-823 could not
&gt; possibly refer to either of those two articles since that particular
&gt; statute is within the first three articles of Chapter 8.

Good job. Now try this one on.

§ 46.2-870. Maximum speed limits generally.

Except as otherwise provided in this article, the maximum speed limit shall
be 55 miles per hour on interstate highways or other limited access highways
with divided roadways, nonlimited access highways having four or more lanes,
and all state primary highways.

The maximum speed limit on all other highways shall be 55 miles per hour if
the vehicle is a passenger motor vehicle, bus, pickup or panel truck, or a
motorcycle, but 45 miles per hour on such highways if the vehicle is a
truck, tractor truck, or combination of vehicles designed to transport
property, or is a motor vehicle being used to tow a vehicle designed for
self-propulsion, or a house trailer.

Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this section, the maximum speed
limit shall be 65 miles per hour where indicated by lawfully placed signs,
erected subsequent to a traffic engineering study, on: (i) interstate
highways, (ii) multilane, divided, limited access highways, and (iii)
high-occupancy vehicle lanes if such lanes are physically separated from
regular travel lanes. The maximum speed limit shall be 60 miles per hour
where indicated by lawfully placed signs, erected subsequent to a traffic
engineering study, on U.S. Route 360 where it is a nonlimited access,
multilane, divided highway.

Just what is too slow? Notice the part about HOV lanes they have to be
phiscally seperate from regular travel lanes, in order to have a 65 MPH
speed limit.

§ 46.2-877. Minimum speed limits.

No person shall drive a motor vehicle at such a slow speed as to impede the
normal and reasonable movement of traffic except when reduced speed is
necessary for safe operation or in compliance with law.

So what do you think if someone is traveling at the maximum allowable speed
are they violating 46.2-877 ? Or are they complying with the law?

"if the USA could match the leading OECD nation -- Sweden -- for the
per capita death rate, a stunning 25,500+ lives could be saved in
America each year."

Talk about SAFETY, and terrorism becomes an insignificant priority
compared to this. "But, well, you know, things are they way they are,
and not the way they should be, and you must understand the
priorities," or so they say. Which amounts to, "We give a damn about
safety!" Well, I tell them, "It's a jungle out there!"

"Maybe, for financial reasons or whatever, that's the way it has to be.
But we wish for pity's sake that people in positions of responsibility
or authority would stop crowing about how well the USA is doing in
terms of road safety. We all want the country to do well but pretending
that this is currently the case is not only ludicrous but it is also a
dangerous disservice to American people."

August 12, 2004 -- Misleading press release from a major U.S.
government body
(Not driving advice, as such, but dangerous, none-the-less.)

At the NTSB "Standards in Driver Education" Forum, in October 2003, an
invited speaker -- a professor of road safety -- made the utterly
baseless claim that America leads the world in road safety.

Not only was this a remarkable claim, given that at that time the USA
actually lay in 26th= position out of the 30 member- countries of the
OECD, for the per capita road death rate, and in 5th position out of
just 9 countries for deaths-by-distance- traveled (known in the USA as
the VMT rate), but it was also dangerously misleading. [1988-2002
figures -- data here. Also 2002 IRTAD -- data here.]

People around the world are all conversant with their own cultural
version of "if it ain't broke, don't fix it," so what possible good can
come from implying that the USA is performing well in the field of road
safety when in fact the opposite is much nearer the truth?

Yet still this myth refuses to die!  On August 12, a press release from
a government road safety body was issued in which it was stated:
"America's leadership in highway safety is not yet established but
we're going in the right direction."

Oh, really?

Why is it, then, that in 2003 figures the USA has slipped back two
places to be in 28th position out of the 30 OECD member-countries for
the per capita death rate (and also in 40th position out of 50 known
countries overall)? [2003 data here.]

At DSA, we would be as delighted as anyone to see the USA performing
brilliantly in terms of road safety for it would mean tens of thousands
of lives saved. Judging by the latest available figures [i.e. 2003], if
the USA could match the leading OECD nation -- Sweden -- for the per
capita death rate, a stunning 25,500+ lives could be saved in America
each year.

It simply is not good enough for official bodies to hide behind the VMT
rate -- a measurement which is not only quite meaningless to the
average person, but also is couched in small figures (n.b. currently
"1.48") that sound insignificant but in reality equate to around 43,000
lost lives each year.

In all other developed nations that the staff at DSA are aware of,
success is primarily being measured how much the number of actual
deaths has been reduced over past years -- not just on whether the rate
sounds good -- and major goals have been set for ambitious further cuts
in the number of deaths over the next few years. In America, however,
no such practical targets on actual human lives are brought to the
forefront and no such measurements are routinely given.

Maybe, for financial reasons or whatever, that's the way it has to be.
But we wish for pity's sake that people in positions of responsibility
or authority would stop crowing about how well the USA is doing in
terms of road safety. We all want the country to do well but pretending
that this is currently the case is not only ludicrous but it is also a
dangerous disservice to American people.

......

Trouble is you see "speeders" and "dangerous drivers " as one and the same.
Traffic experts do not. Everybody I know exceeds posted limits but none are
dangerous drivers. I'd bet you do too. That's why I dispise lane hogs, speed
limit or not. The vast majority of drivers choose safe speeds.  Anyone going
much faster or slower than "normal" tends to be a hazard.  But most speed
limits are too slow. I'm not talking about school zones, et cetera, I mean
highways where limits are 55, 65 or even 75, yet the average SAFE driver
will be doing 10 or more over. That's "normal".  In this case the lane hog
doing the speed limit (10 under normal) is the dangerous driver and, if LEOs
would enforce the law, we'd all be safer.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Yes you are trying &lt;grin&gt;, very trying, but also wrong - if only because you
think driving over unrealistic limits is dangerous driving.  If most
drivers - the normal flow of traffic - in a left lane are doing 75 MPH but
you, or anybody else, is in that lane doing 65 (the posted limit) then you
are creating a dangerous situation for dozens perhaps 100s of other drivers.
In this case the lane hog is the dangerous driver.  Does this give others
any right to tailgate or weave or shoot at him? No.  But if police were
really protecting John Q Public they'd be ticketing the lane hog.  And,
since the judge prolly drives 10 over too, you'd prolly get convictions too.

Well, netkooks that have responded to this thread with suggestions that
it would somehow be "OK" to physically assault or damage the
automobiles of law-abiding drivers proceeding at the speed limit in the
left lane certainly seem to me to be terrorists, and even potential
killers, if they should decide to press forward with their lunacy...

One netkook in this thread wanted to spray other motorist's cars with
paint stripper and claims he carries "caltrops" to throw on the highway
to puncture their tires. I've read discussions indicating that at least
one netkook thinks that shooting law-abiding drivers should be
permitted and seems to be trying to instigate others into shooting at
other drivers...

And a response to him indicated that law-abiidng drivers in at least
one state had the right to carry fireamrs in their cars and were likely
to shoot back if fired upon...

So, what's it gonna be on our nation's highways, Law and Order or Mad
Max, or Death Race 2000? Are the Lane Discipline Nazi's going to get so
far out of hand
that we see shootings over this issue again?

California has a problem with out-of-state drivers who've grown used to
driving at excessive speed on empty interstates in their rural home
state. The obsolete ideas of KRETP and STKR work usually work OK on
nearly empty roads, but near the large California metropoli they break
down. California needs every lane to carry traffic at the legal speed
limit just to move all the commuters, we can't afford the luxury of a
special lane for speeders...

And, even out in the rural areas where there's no crowding at all, we
still see out-of-state drivers trying to enforce the obsolete KRETP and
STKR notions of their own rural state...

About 20 years ago, California had a rash of road rage, with freeway
shootings over whether motorists could drive in the left lane at the
speed limit. Ignorant drivers who believed in the "left lane is the
fast lane" urban myth
persecuted law abiding drivers and the law-abiding drivers were simply
instructed to "move over when safe" and to "avoid eye contact" with
those nutcases...

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;    My personal feeling about speeders and other dangerous drivers is; they

You're doing a great job of trying to educate the misguided public who
believe in the "fast lane" urban myth. I have to salute you again for
your patience and your thoughtful responses to the cross-posting
netkooks who are reading this thread on automotive enthusiast NG's...

The problem with the automotive enthusiast press is that they tend to
create an arrogant readership. That's why you get so much argument back
from the netkooks on the enthusiast NG's. They think that they are
authorities because they own a performance automobile or motorcycle,
and that having attended a celebrity-taught driving or riding school or
perhaps competed in racing at an amateur level, they are somehow
entitled to be regarded as an authority on the subject of highway
laws...

The netkook automotive enthusiast probably believes that he's part of
some grass roots rules making commitee and that if enough opinions are
swayed by this type of netkookery there will be a grass roots movement
to sweep all the
slow drivers out of the "fast lane" so they can speed at will...

There was some talk in England several years ago about treating
speeders the same way that drunks are treated, that speeding is a
problem with willpower, and perhaps the speeder could be rehabilitated
if he would form the conscious thought that, "Just for today, I will
not speed and annoy others or endanger them"...

Some sort of speeding violator education needs to be adopted to make
the speeders less arrogant and more aware of the shameful nature of
their offense against public dignity...

Again, keep up the good work, don't stop trying...

If the normal flow of traffic is over the limit, as it usually is, I think
they are at once complying with the law but creating a danger to other
equally safe drivers. After all  the 55 limit was coerced out of the

&gt;&gt;that § 46.2-823 refers to is not the same article that contains §
&gt;&gt;46.2-842.  In short, § 46.2-823 is contained in either article 1, 2, or
&gt;&gt;3.  § 46.2-842 is contained in either article 4 or 5.

&gt; You claimed that the word &quot;article&quot; was not present.

&gt; A dictionary definition of 'article' is &quot;a separate and usually numbered
&gt; or otherwise marked section (as of a statute, indictment, will, or other
&gt; writing)&quot;.

&gt; &quot;This article&quot; would refer to at least everything in Title 46.2, Chapter
&gt; 8, which includes both of the laws that I cited --

&gt; § 46.2-842. Driver to give way to overtaking vehicle.
&gt; § 46.2-823. Unlawful speed forfeits right-of-way.
">

I think his point was, is an "article" a subsection of a chapter, or if
not, why was the word "chapter" or "section" not used instead of "article?"

Depending on interpretation, it could mean that the whole "loss of right
of way" argument is invalid in this case.

The way statutes are normally written, "article" is understood to mean
the first subsection just after the title, which is the major grouping
in the body of statutes.

So Scott is correct, the statute he cited that says unlawful speeding
results in loss of rights-of-way under that article refers to anything
under 46.2, which I take it is the MV code of VA.

It usually goes Title/Article/Part/Section.

It does.  It points to the article that it's located within.

Let's try this with the phrase "this chapter."

§ 46.2-802. Drive on right side of highways.

Except as otherwise provided by law, on all highways of sufficient
width, the driver of a vehicle shall drive on the right half of the
highway, unless it is impracticable to travel on such side of the
highway and except when overtaking and passing another vehicle, subject
to the provisions applicable to overtaking and passing set forth in
Article 4 (§ 46.2-837 et seq.) of *this chapter*.

Now, does the phrase "this chapter" refer to every single chapter in
title 46.2?  Even the chapters that have nothing to do with the rules of
the road in that title?

Or how about the phrse "this title."

§ 2.2-514. Compromise and settlement of disputes.

C. No settlement under subsection A shall be made subject to a
confidentiality agreement if such settlement requires that a matter or
issue shall be the subject of (i) regulatory action pursuant to Article
2 (§ 2.2-4006 et seq.) of Chapter 40 of *this title,* or (ii)
legislation proposed to be introduced in the General Assembly.

Does the phrase "this title" refer to every single title in the code of
Virginia.  Does it even include titles that don't even have a chapter 40?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I don't see a glossary on the Code of Virginia website
">

I have a feeling that the web version is missing the article number
labels that a hard copy version might have.

Again, here are the cites from the code of Virginia that show where
articles 4 and 6 begin in chapter 8, title 46.2.

§ 46.2-802. Drive on right side of highways.

Except as otherwise provided by law, on all highways of sufficient
width, the driver of a vehicle shall drive on the right half of the
highway, unless it is impracticable to travel on such side of the
highway and except when overtaking and passing another vehicle, subject
to the provisions applicable to overtaking and passing set forth in
*Article 4 (§ 46.2-837 et seq.)* of this chapter.

This states that article 4 starts at 46.2-837 and continues through a
sequence of statutes.

§ 46.2-860. Failing to give proper signals.

A person shall be guilty of reckless driving who fails to give adequate
and timely signals of intention to turn, partly turn, slow down, or
stop, as required by *Article 6 (§ 46.2-848 et seq.)* of this chapter.

This states that article 6 starts at 46.2-848 and continues through a
sequence of statutes.

Since 46.2-823 is before the sequence of statutes that make up article 4
and 46.2-842.1 is located in the sequence of statutes that make up
article 4 (or possibly article 5) and is located before the sequence of
statutes that make up article 6, it's clear that the 2 statutes in
question are not located within the same article and that the chapter
doesn't consist of one article.  The phrase "this title/chapter/article"
in the code of Virginia refers to the encompassing
title/chapter/article.  It cannot refer to all titles/chapters/articles
(depending on which word is used) since it's clear from the title
example that one cannot refer to a non existant chapter 40 in a subset
of all titles in the code of Virginia.

It doesn't make sense to conclude that the interpretations of the
phrases, "this chapter," "this title," or "this article," would be
inconsistent (if that's where you plan to go with this _pointless_
argument).

Not in this case.  The code of Virginia is divided into title,
*chapter*, article, statute.  There are several statutes that make
reference to a numbered article and then point to a particular statute
and note that it starts a sequence ("et seq.") of statutes.

The phrase "this article" will refer to the article that the statute is
located within.  The phrase "this chapter" will refer to the chapter
that the statute is located within.  The phrase "this title" will refer
to the title that the statute is located within.

against drivers who hit other cars from behind. Judge finds that the
speeding moron was 5 mph over the maximum speed limit when he hit the
car that wouldn't yield to his self-importance. Judge dismisses the
speeding moron's case, stating that speeding traffic forfeits right of
way. Judge finds for the real victim, who was unreasonably and brutally

In order to impede traffic, one must drive in such a way that traffic
behind them has no choice but to slow down.  A truck going 45 mph in the
right lane of an interstate while ascending a grade will not impede
traffic since traffic can easily maintain speed and pass him in the left
lane.  If there are two trucks both going 45 mph up the same grade, and
one of them is in the left lane besides the other, then the one in the

2005 Porsche Carrera GT

"find me a French car that is a sexy looking!! and as fast!!"

Yeah, but you want to compare pears and apples, besides it's German.
And what would you do with it if you can't drive fast or smart on
American roads?

But I'm comparing cheap French cars with the rest and they certainly
have a lot style and big sunroofs, not like the anonymous, boring
automatic Japanese or American cars...

"Unfortunately, it is a Chevrolet Cavalier. I should probably find
something kind to say about it, so I should say first that it is a
not-entirely-repugnant shade of gold. Other than that, I hate it."

Do you think this is a car for a smart person? Only in America... ;)

Driving in America
My employer has kindly paid for a rental car while I am here.
Unfortunately, it is a Chevrolet Cavalier. I should probably find
something kind to say about it, so I should say first that it is a
not-entirely-repugnant shade of gold. Other than that, I hate it.

For a start, it is an automatic. Which is to say, it is automatically
always in the wrong gear, and automatically takes several seconds to
realise that its wrong, and then automatically overcompensates, causing
the vehicle to lurch violently. When driving up-hill it whines like an
overexcited and elderly cat demanding attention. When driving downhill,
it accelerates wildly unless you ride the break so hard the pads almost
catch fire. When you put it in park, it rolls forward or backward
several inches at random. When you take your foot off the break it
starts moving. I have driven automatics I liked. The Smart Car, for
instance, has a very fine automatic gearbox. This thing does not.

Secondly, the steering is unresponsive. When I say unresponsive, I mean
like a supertanker. Lane changing manouvers must be planned well in
advance. Turns over fourty-five degrees require slowing to a crawl and
gently inching round. This isn't helped by the suspension, which is
akin to a bouncy castle. And of course, the car is so heavy it has no
traction. So those wierd 270-degree roads in cloverleaf junctions must
be navigated at 20 mph or less.

Also, the blind spots are so big you can fit a four-seater pickup truck
into them. There is no rear windscreen wiper at all. The right wing
mirror does not appear to be adjustable. The seats are so low, and the
windscreen so swept-back I feel I need to crane my neck to see more
than a couple of degrees up or down.

Having complained about my car, however, I must say that driving here
has been surprisingly pleasant. Other drivers are much less aggressive
than in Europe. Where you would need to hurry up and get our of the way
on a British road, people seem content to wait. Even when I forget the
right-turn-on-red rule people seem unbothered by it. People even slow
down to let you changed lanes, which in unheard of on a European
motorway. I reckon its combination of automatic gearboxes, which seem
to actively prevent you from accelerating hard, enormous vehicles with
poor visibility that force you to leave decent distance between cars,
and the construction of the roads, which discourages agressive driving
through the total lack of acceleration lanes, and the occasional
appearance of left-hand-lane exits.

So possibly the awful nature of my car is actually part of a conspiracy
to encourage polite driving. I hope so, but even if it is I will be
relieved to get back to throwing my fiesta round corners at 50mph in
third.

Go back, Young Morrow. Look at the VC section where it says that the
driver proceeding at the speed limit in the left lane isn't guilty of
negligence, per se, if he fails to yield the left lane to the Lane
Discipline Nazi flashing his lights and blowing his horn...

When public highway rudeness like that turns into an accident and it
finds its way into court, and the driver proceeding at the speed limit
can't be found negligent, who will be found negligent? Probably the
speeding scofflaw, unless he can arrange to pack the jury box with
other Lane Discipline Nazis...

That probably won't happen though. The Lane Discipline Nazi will
probably find himself short shrift by the very people he despises so
much, the quiet, law-abiding drivers who proceed at the speed limit and
never honk their horns or flash their lights at anybody. They will be
the majority in the jury box, and the Lane Discipline Nazi won't get

I've said American roads would be the perfect proving ground for the
Law of the Jungle... OK, here's one: SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST (SPEED) IS
A MECHANISM OF EVOLUTION. It makes our roads fit for the fittest,
without endangering the unfit. SURVIVAL OF THE STUPID (LEFT-LANE HOGS)
IS PLAIN STUPID.

Speed limits may not be saving lives
A new article publishing in the latest issue of Review of Policy
Research examines the evolution and devolution of speed limit laws and
their effects on fatality rates. The author did not find a significant
increase in fatalities per miles driven after speed limit laws ceased
to be national and states could, and some did, increase their highway
limit to more than fifty-five miles per hour. "Automobile safety
features and enforcement emerge as important factors in increasing
highway safety; speed limits are far less important," author Robert O.
Yowell explains.
Although speed limits bring to mind the notion of public safety, they
were formed in the 1970s to combat a gasoline shortage. In the 1980s
the focus shifted to public safety while some speed limit regulation
devolved back to states; the maximum speed on rural interstates could
be raised to 65 mph. In 1995 and involving some controversy, Congress
returned all speed limit authority back to the states. Analysis of the
highway deaths per mile driven after the 1974 nationalization of the
maximum highway speed indicates an initial greater decline in deaths
than had been the trend, but the long-term decreasing trend reemerged
following the shock. Dr. Yowell's research finds others reasons besides
speed for the long-term trend of increased highway safety. (From 1968
to 1991, the fatality rate per 100 million declined by 63.2%.)
Technical progress in car manufacturing, increased use of seat belts by
drivers and passengers, an increase in the minimum legal drinking age,
and the general maintenance of roads all affect this rate.

&gt; disappearing concept of personal responsibility, that all drivers
&gt; should have a grip on their emotions when they get behind the wheel?&quot;

&gt; Target: Left Lane Hogs - Finally!
&gt; by Eric Peters

&gt; Some good news: Left lane hogs are finally getting the attention they
&gt; deserve from traffic cops -- and traffic laws.

&gt; In at least two states -- Colorado and Florida -- cops are begiining to
&gt; target drivers who squat in the far left lane and refuse to move right
&gt; to let faster-moving traffic get by. For decades, these drivers have
&gt; been allowed to create rolling roadblocks and interrupt the smooth (and
&gt; therfore safe) flow of traffic with virtual impunity because &quot;faiure to
&gt; yield&quot; laws were either not on the books -- or not enforced. And
&gt; twenty-plus years of ddumbed-down, politicized &quot;driver's education&quot; and
&gt; &quot;safety&quot; campaigns had effectively propagandized the populace into
&gt; believing their was only one cardinal sin -- &quot;speeding.&quot;

&gt; And so the focus of traffic &quot;safety&quot; enforcement was speed limit laws
&gt; -- which of course were often ridiculous (the best example being the
&gt; 55-mph National Maximum Speed Limit that Congress finally repealed in
&gt; 1995. But these under-posted, artificially low speed limits were found
&gt; to be very useful in terms of generating an unforseen flow of easy
&gt; money for state and local governments -- who soon became addicted. And
&gt; it was so much easier for traffic cops to simply shoot fish in a barrel
&gt; with their radar guns -- because almost every car on the road was going
&gt; faster than the absurdly low posted limits.

&gt; Much easier than actually looking for dangerous drivers, anyhow.

&gt; This is finally changing, though.

&gt; In Colorado, state police have written more than 500 tickets to left
&gt; lane hogs since the beginning of the year; in Florida, a bill is on the
&gt; legilstive docket that would impose a $60 fine and four DMV &quot;demerit
&gt; points&quot; on the driving record of motorists who refuse to allow faster
&gt; moving traffic by.

&gt; Twenty years ago, this would have been an unthinkable violation of the
&gt; politically correct orthodoxy that onle &quot;speed kills&quot; -- and therefore
&gt; only enforcing speed limits (no matter how absurd or contrived)
&gt; matters.

&gt; But in fact, people who refuse to move right represent a major traffic
&gt; safety hazard -- whether &quot;they doing the speed limit&quot; (as they often
&gt; bleat in self-righteous high dudgeon) or not.

&gt; By refusing to allow other motorists to get by, the left lane dawdler
&gt; causes traffic to back up unnaturally; drivers then angrily jockey for
&gt; position -- and typically are forced into making a passing attempt in
&gt; the right lane to get around the hog -- who seems to get some sort of
&gt; weird passive-aggressive satisfaction from his obstinancy.

&gt; The situation is frustrating, distracting -- and very unsafe. In fact,
&gt; the lack of reflexive lane courtesy in this country is arguably the
&gt; biggest single safety problem we have -- not &quot;speeding.&quot;

&gt; Consider the example of Germany -- where yielding to faster-moving
&gt; traffic is part of the national culture and adhered to religiously. As
&gt; a result, it is possible for the Germans to have unlimited speed
&gt; Autobahns -- where drivers in the left lane often overtake other cars
&gt; at tripe digit speeds. But because German drivers are taught to use
&gt; their mirrors -- and immediately move right to allow faster-moving
&gt; approaching cars to pass -- they have a lower accident and fatality
&gt; rate than we do here in the United States with our dumbed-down speed
&gt; limits.

&gt; It will take time for the facts about the danger of left lane hogging
&gt; to sink into the general consciousness -- the consequence of 20-plus
&gt; years of neglect and outright disinformation peddled by know-nothing
&gt; &quot;safety&quot; advocates.

&gt; But, at last, things are beginning to change for the better.

&gt; Target new drivers, not the hapless ones

&gt; BY LARRY LEBOWITZ

&gt; The debate rages on across the Sunshine State over Gov. Jeb Bush's veto
&gt; of the shrewdly misnamed Road Rage Reduction Act.

&gt; The bill -- which passed both houses of the Legislature with just four
&gt; dissenting votes -- would have required drivers in the left lane of any
&gt; limited-access four-lane roadway to get out of the way when a faster
&gt; driver approached from behind, even if the lead driver was traveling at
&gt; the speed limit.

&gt; Drivers who didn't yield would have been ticketed.

&gt; Proponents said the bill, modeled on similar measures in 21 states,
&gt; would have provided relief from the phenomenon of ''rolling
&gt; roadblocks'' caused by slowpokes driving in the fast lane and impatient
&gt; speeders darting through traffic to bypass them.

&gt; Citing a lack of empirical evidence, Bush said the bill was trying to
&gt; offer relief to the wrong people: ``those traveling at high rates of
&gt; speed, or possessed of emotional intemperance, at the expense of
&gt; cautious and careful drivers.''

&gt; Don't misunderstand: There is a legitimate problem here. Plenty of
&gt; oblivious doofuses are puttering along in the far-left lanes of
&gt; Interstate 95, the Palmetto Expressway and Florida's Turnpike, where
&gt; they have no business. But this bill wasn't the answer.

&gt; Here's a novel idea -- one espoused by many Streetwise correspondents.
&gt; Instead of pandering to speeders, perhaps lawmakers ought to demand
&gt; greater accountability and efficiency from the state Department of
&gt; Motor Vehicles.

&gt; Why not make sure that new license recipients actually learn the
&gt; Florida traffic laws before they legally hit the road?

&gt; You know, regulations like slower traffic should stay to the right.

&gt; Or that stopping in the middle of the interstate and backing up to the
&gt; exit ramp is verboten.

&gt; How about finding more money to hire troopers to clear accidents
&gt; faster?

&gt; Better yet, how about crafting laws that reinforce the rapidly
&gt; disappearing concept of personal responsibility, that all drivers
&gt; should have a grip on their emotions when they get behind the wheel?

One comment - in my years family members and I have owned
several European cars (1 Fiesta, 2 VWs, 1 Audi, 2
Jensen-Healeys, 2 Austin-Healeys, 2 Land Rovers, a Volvo,
plus several more European cars owned by close friends).
I've never found them to be anything special. I don't think
Cavaliers are special either but I do believe of the implied
critims of the Cavalier represent some sort of European
chavanism. And with the possible exception of the Fiesta,
they were all horribly expensive to purchase and maintain.

&gt; Yeah, but you want to compare pears and apples, besides it's German.
&gt; And what would you do with it if you can't drive fast or smart on
&gt; American roads?

&gt; But I'm comparing cheap French cars with the rest and they certainly
&gt; have a lot style and big sunroofs, not like the anonymous, boring
&gt; automatic Japanese or American cars...

&gt; &quot;Unfortunately, it is a Chevrolet Cavalier. I should probably find
&gt; something kind to say about it, so I should say first that it is a
&gt; not-entirely-repugnant shade of gold. Other than that, I hate it.&quot;

&gt; Do you think this is a car for a smart person? Only in America... ;)

&gt; Driving in America
&gt; My employer has kindly paid for a rental car while I am here.
&gt; Unfortunately, it is a Chevrolet Cavalier. I should probably find
&gt; something kind to say about it, so I should say first that it is a
&gt; not-entirely-repugnant shade of gold. Other than that, I hate it.

&gt; For a start, it is an automatic. Which is to say, it is automatically
&gt; always in the wrong gear, and automatically takes several seconds to
&gt; realise that its wrong, and then automatically overcompensates, causing
&gt; the vehicle to lurch violently. When driving up-hill it whines like an
&gt; overexcited and elderly cat demanding attention. When driving downhill,
&gt; it accelerates wildly unless you ride the break so hard the pads almost
&gt; catch fire. When you put it in park, it rolls forward or backward
&gt; several inches at random. When you take your foot off the break it
&gt; starts moving. I have driven automatics I liked. The Smart Car, for
&gt; instance, has a very fine automatic gearbox. This thing does not.

&gt; Secondly, the steering is unresponsive. When I say unresponsive, I mean
&gt; like a supertanker. Lane changing manouvers must be planned well in
&gt; advance. Turns over fourty-five degrees require slowing to a crawl and
&gt; gently inching round. This isn't helped by the suspension, which is
&gt; akin to a bouncy castle. And of course, the car is so heavy it has no
&gt; traction. So those wierd 270-degree roads in cloverleaf junctions must
&gt; be navigated at 20 mph or less.

&gt; Also, the blind spots are so big you can fit a four-seater pickup truck
&gt; into them. There is no rear windscreen wiper at all. The right wing
&gt; mirror does not appear to be adjustable. The seats are so low, and the
&gt; windscreen so swept-back I feel I need to crane my neck to see more
&gt; than a couple of degrees up or down.

&gt; Having complained about my car, however, I must say that driving here
&gt; has been surprisingly pleasant. Other drivers are much less aggressive
&gt; than in Europe. Where you would need to hurry up and get our of the way
&gt; on a British road, people seem content to wait. Even when I forget the
&gt; right-turn-on-red rule people seem unbothered by it. People even slow
&gt; down to let you changed lanes, which in unheard of on a European
&gt; motorway. I reckon its combination of automatic gearboxes, which seem
&gt; to actively prevent you from accelerating hard, enormous vehicles with
&gt; poor visibility that force you to leave decent distance between cars,
&gt; and the construction of the roads, which discourages agressive driving
&gt; through the total lack of acceleration lanes, and the occasional
&gt; appearance of left-hand-lane exits.

&gt; So possibly the awful nature of my car is actually part of a conspiracy
&gt; to encourage polite driving. I hope so, but even if it is I will be
&gt; relieved to get back to throwing my fiesta round corners at 50mph in
&gt; third.

Trucks passing other trucks is no big deal in California. They do it
all the time and no truck is likely to be pulled over for hurting the
feelings of a
Rabid Lane Discipline Nazi...

We actually do have "lane discipline" in California, but the Lane
Discipline Nazis usually don't know it. Lane discipline is enforced on
the spot by professional truckers in the two right hand lanes. They
know they can't get away with much, the California Highway Patrol will
stop them before they will stop an idiot speeder in the "fast lane"...

Here in California, we have several mountain passes where the trucks
are restricted from driving in any lane except the two right hand
lanes. In fact, trucks are restricted to the two right lanes on any
freeway, unless they need to be in a lane further to the left in order
to proceeed along their intended route. Too bad if a speeding Lane
Discipline Nazi doesn't like that!

As the big trucks begin the 3000 foot climb out of the San Joaquin
valley to to the 4400 foot Tejon summit, I often see heavily laden
trucks laboring along in low gear in the right lane going 25 mph or
less and the less heavily laden trucks will be passing them at maybe 35
mph in the second from the right lane.
In the minds of some Lane Discipline Nazis, the trucks shouldn't be on
the highways at all, they should be a "special road" for trucks, out of
sight of the automobile drivers...

It only takes a car about 10 minutes or so, driving at the speed limit
to reach the summit, maybe it take the trucks twice as long...

It takes a little bit of planning and alertness on the part of
automobile drivers to remember to push the accelerator pedal down, and
perhaps even downshift into passing gear to get up that grade. Many
have probably never intentionally selected their passing gear for
climbing grades or descending grades in their entire lives. They don't
realize they can even *do* that, they are very skeptical when told that
it's really OK to move the shift lever into another position besides
"Drive"...

Some "fast lane" drivers who've been cruising at 80 mph on the flat
will find themselves suddenly bogged down at 60, or even 55 mph as they
try to go up the grade in a "Drive" position that is very tall geared
for fuel economy...

Alert, enthusiastic drivers who've been up the grade before try to
attack it at high speed. They hope to go up the grade at 80 mph, just
as fast as they cruised on the flat. They probably wouldn't use their
passing gear on the grade either...

When they see the less-than-alert drivers bogged down at 55 or 60 mph,
they start zigging-and-zagging around the "slowpokes". Sometimes one of
the speed enthusiasts trying to climb the grade at 70 or 80 mph would
find he's made a mistake, he gets stuck behind a big truck going 25 or
35 mph, and that will make him angry at all the "stupid slowpokes" that
spoiled his drive. After crossing over the pass at Tejon summit, he'll
drive 80 or 90 mph all the way down to the San Fernando valley. Boy,
that will sure teach those "stupid slowpokes" a lesson in who's "boss",
won't it?

Going down the Tejon grade towards Grapevine is even scarier. Gravity
is working for the dullest-witted drivers. The heavily-laden trucks are
restricted to the two right hand lanes at a limit of 35 mph. You can
see clouds of smoke coming off of brakes and smell burning brakes for
ten miles coming off the Tejon Summit into the San Joaquin valley...

But the speeding scofflaws are passing those trucks at 80 mph going
down that steep grade. Gawd help one of those fools if a runaway truck
needs to use the escape road on the center median. And gawd help them
if a big-rig should lose control and jack knife across all lanes of
traffic descending the grade...

If more than one truck should happen to break down ascending or
descending the Tejon pass, the truckers are going to just move over one
more lane and use that lane to pass slower trucks. Then there's only
ONE lane left for the speeders and the law-abiding drivers. Maybe it
makes the Lane Discipline Nazis cry to have to slow down a little, but
nobody cares if their little feelings are hurt...

As I descend the Tejon Pass, I stay the heck out of the "fast lane" and
watch my rear view mirror for fools approaching from behind. I'm still
driving 30 mph faster than the law-abiding trucks beside me, and an
exploding overloaded truck tire could frag my little pickup with chunks
of flying rubber, fabric and wire...

That might ruin my underwear...

Well, see, there's where anecdotal evidence proves its limitations.  I bought a
1988 Chevy Beretta, first year of production, GM car.  Sold it when my family
grew, some 88,000 miles later, having installed exactly one water pump, one
battery, and changed the tires and brake pads a couple of times.  I bought a
1999 GMC pick-up - first year of production of that generation, brand new Vortec
V8 engine, brand new chassis, all new interior, clean sheet design.  Drove it
47,000 hard miles, most pulling a 17-foot enclosed racing trailer, in 1.5 years
of racing, with ZERO initial delivery defects, and one change of tires, one
change of brake pads, and NO mechanical failures of any kind.  Needed a larger
bed, so I traded it in on a 2000 GMC longbed, drove it until this year, put
57,000 miles on it, ZERO initial delivery defects, and one change of tires, one
change of brake pads, and NO mechanical failures of any kind.  When I retired
from racing, I bought a brand new BMW 2001 Z3 3.0 Coupe.  Three trips to the
dealership to fix five various initial delivery defects, then the electrical
problems started cropping up.  The cruise control took FOUR trips to two
different dealers to fix, then the turn signals became intermittent, then the
radio blinked on and off, then the passenger door panel started to peel away
from the frame, then the weatherstripping went south...  I sold the car after
three years and only 17,500 miles because it was going to be out of warranty in
six months and I didn't want to pay for all the shit that was going to need to
be fixed.  I replaced it with a 15 year old (but NEW, from a collector who died)
Chevy 454SS pickup truck.  ZERO initial delivery defects, and NO mechanical
failures of any kind, to date, after a year of rather spirited driving.

My experience tells me to stick with GM and avoid German cars.  Well, except for
my wife's VW R32, but that's a different anecdote...

You got my point. A lot of California car drivers don't know how to
share the road with other drivers and the truck drivers are the most
disciplined and persecuted drivers on the highways. The truckers will
be stopped and inspected and rousted and shaken down for fine money,
because their company can afford it. The dipshit automobile drivers
will get out of their speeding tickets by taking traffic school...

California car drivers don't know what to do in dense fog either, they
keep trying to drive 80 mph and wind up ramming into each other,
causing 100 car accidents. And you can tell a California driver from
the big city when he/she gets onto the empty interstate. He/she will
continue to cruise in the left lane even though there's *nobody* in
either lane except for them and the kook coming up fast behind them
trying to drive 120 mph, thinking that the left lane is *his* lane,
just because he's speeding and he's been driving in that lane for 50
miles at illegal speeds...

One 4th of July weekend, I was headed out the the Colorado river on
Interstate 15. Driving about 75, I came up behind a Winnebago that's
legally, but stupidly driving in the left lane at about 65. Obviously a
city driver who didn't know that people were in a hurry to get to the
river...

As I went to legally pass him on the right, a four wheel drive pickup
truck going 100 mph passed me. He was driving on the shoulder, in the
dirt, weaving and wallowing and fishtailing...

That was the same area where Sam Kinnison the comedian rolled his
pickup truck over and was killed...

Same weekend, over by the south rim of the Grand Canyon, I come up
behind a
diesel pusher bus in hilly terrain. I can't see to make a safe pass.
Finally my chance comes, I duck out from behind the slow bus into the
oncoming lane. At the same instant, an idiot driving a Volvo is trying
to pass *both* of us. He's dead wrong for trying to pass two cars at

Ah yes, driving in the US. Automatics. Hate 'em. With a passion.

People are always surprised over here when I look at cars and insist on
manual transmission. I won't consider models that only have automatics
(yep, they exist) cos I just don't like the lack of control. Of course,
you have been blessed with what is commonly referred to as "a crap car"
or, more colloquially, a Chevy POS, which doesn't help. I drove a Buick
Skylark for a while (a rental, of course) - the only automatic I ever
had fun with, and that was only because it was a ridiculous car. Doors
larger than some garage doors in the UK and an engine that could only
honestly be described as unnecessary. It also had a pointy nose on the
front bumper which everyone dents when they park in a multi-storey and
where they cunningly hide the airbag sensor.

Ah, I misunderstood when you said "3 GM products that couldn't seem to put
together three solid months of trouble-free transport. ... those damn POS

problems with the cars.  I might be tempted to misinterpret your clarification,
as well, seeing as how you end it with "even when they run."  But now, at least,
I'm sure that's not what you mean.

I've yet to own a boring car, and I've owned precious few automatic cars, and I
don't remember ever owning a badly designed car... although I've certainly had
my share of differences regarding individual, specific design attributes.

However, I can't think of a single example of any automobile (including my
disappointing BMW) that would cause me to write off every product in every
product category of an entire manufacturer as a result of my personal
experiences with it.  And for that, I'm grateful.

I mean, who knows?  One day, Renault *might* return to the U.S.!

If an individual is prone to violence, he's probably going to get into
fights and will probably assault somebody whether he's in a car. in a
bar, or at home...

The road rage incidents stem from the pernicious urban myth that the
lefthand lane is a passing lane or a "fast lane". If you check the
California Vehicle Code, you will only find *one* mention of "fast
lane" and it has to do with commuter busses that load and unload
passengers at special stations on the freeway median strip. The
legislators didn't want the busses to have to cross lanes of
fast-moving *traffic* but they actually said *fast lanes of traffic*...

I repeat, the concept of the left lane as a "fast lane" or a "passing
lane" is a pernicious urban myth that gets impatient and ignorant
drivers into conflict with
law-abiding drivers proceeding lawfully in the left lane...

If there is a "passing lane" in the state of California, I've never
heard of it.
At one time, the two-way left turn lane in the middle of one of the
main streets in the town I lived in was mistakenly thought to be a
"passing lane", but then the city started painting left turn arrows
every hundred feet or so and the local police department started
nabbing drivers who'd thought it was a passing lane...

And, there are signs that say "Slower Traffic Keep Right". The slower
traffic usually know that they are slower traffic, they are trucks with
three axles, or
cars and pickup trucks towing trailers. They have to keep right and
drive 55 mph...

"Slow Moving Traffic" is a whole different concept from "Slower
Traffic". Golf carts and such are "Slow Moving Traffic". They don't
have to be registered or insured and can't drive on state highways or
freeways because they can't go fast enough...

Winnebagos and Greyhound busses don't have to keep right and drive 55,
they can drive 65 or 70 if the road is signed for those speeds. I don't
like the idea of such a behemoth proceeding in the left lane, blocking
my view of the road ahead, but they aren't illegal, and they sure as
hell down't try to move to the right for every scofflaw that comes up
behind them at 100 mph...

Not illegal to LLB??  Here is an excerpt from California's codes.

California VC 21654(a) says:
Notwithstanding the prima facie speed limits, any vehicle
proceeding upon a highway at a speed less than the normal speed
of traffic moving in the same direction at such time shall be
driven in the right-hand lane for traffic or as close as
practicable to the right-hand edge or curb, except when
overtaking and passing another vehicle proceeding in the same
direction or when preparing for a left turn at an intersection
or into a private road or driveway.

I don't recall when I harvested that.  It was a while back on this
forum on subject of LLB.  Thus 'normal' traffic in that is not being
defined as an arbitrary number on a sign.

That's just wishful thinking, Harry. That section does NOT relieve Lane
Discipline Nazis from the responsibility of driving at or below the
maximum posted speed limit. You might as well brew up a witches'
cauldron of eye of newt, tow of bat, as to chant that particular
mantra...

This section is often cited by Lane Discipline Nazis to justify their
claim that the left lane is for speeders only. The title of the section
is "Slow Moving Vehicles". That term in undefined in this section. And,
the supposedly slow moving vehicle that the Lane Discipline scofflaws
want out of their way is only the one immediately in front of them in
the leftmost lane, despite the fact that it may very well be in the act
of "overtaking and passing another vehicle proceeding in the same
direction" in another lane. So, clearly, the supposedly "slow moving
vehicle" proceeding at the speed limit isn't in violation of this
section as long as it is passing any other vehicle. It could be three
lanes away from the other vehicle it's passing. And, it doesn't matter
*which side* the supposedly slow moving vehicle is passing the other
supposedly even slower vehicle, because passing on the right is legal
on multi-lane highways...

Gosh, if you think about it, the Lane Discipline Nazis would have the
right to expect "slow moving vehicles"in the #2, #3, and #4 lanes to
get out of their way too, on the basis that the excessive speed they
are driving at is somehow "normal"!

"Normal" speed of traffic is undefined, too. "Normal" isn't defined.
But any speed in excess of the posted limits will have to be defended
by "competent evidence" in a court of law to be proven as lawful. It
will cost the mantra-chanting Lane Discipline scofflaw a few hundred
$$$ to dig up any "competent evidence" and it will hardly be worth
it...

Now, since you cut and pasted CVC 21654(a), I'll paste

21654(b) If a vehicle is being driven at a speed less than the normal
speed of traffic moving in the same direction at such time, and is not
being driven in the right-hand lane for traffic or as close as
*practicable* to the right-hand edge or curb, it shall constitute prima
facie evidence that the driver is operating the vehicle in violation of
subdivision (a) of this section.

Uh oh! California Vehicle Code doesn't define "prima facie", either.
"Prima facie evidence"
is that which is legally sufficient to establish a fact or a case
unless disproved. So, what the heck, the law-abiding driver is supposed
to have to dig up $300 to $400 out of his pocket
to prove what any *fool* knows, i.e., that *everybody else cannot drive
in the right lane just to satisfy a few self-absorbed speeders*?

On a crowded California freeway, with 4 to 6 lanes of traffic following
each other too closely already, and these lanes of traffic extend from
horizon to horizon and there are a quarter of a million cars trying to
cross, say, the San Fernando valley during rush hour, and a few
egotistical pricks want to drive 85 mph, while the rest of the traffic
is resigned to driving in the available space, regardless of lane,
aren't the law-abiding drivers actually driving as close to the
right-hand edge or curb as *practicable*?

Should a quarter of a million other cars all drive in the right hand
lane because a few stupid morons think that 21654(a) means "Awright,
everybody out of my way, I'm coming through!"? What is practicable
about *that*, Harry?

Finally, look at how *old* that section you quoted is.

"Amended Ch. 545, Stats. 1974. Effective January 1, 1975."

This section was enacted into law during the early days of the 55mph
national speed limit, when the California Highway Patrol was out making
sure we all died of old age on our way to work. *Everybody* on the
highways was a "slow moving vehicle", or they weren't moving at all,
they were sitting in their vehicle waiting for the CHP to run their
plate for wants and warrants and to write them a ticket...

No, Harry, 21654(a) doesn't do what you wish it did, and it has nothing
to do with what the Lane Discipline Nazis want it to do. It's NOT a
"left lane clearing" law at all. It doesn't get law-abiding drivers
proceeding at the legal maximum speed limit out of the way of speeding
scoflaws because, whatever lane they are driving in during peak traffic
hours is so full of traffic that *any* lane they are driving in is as
close to the right hand curb as "practicable"...

Again, if you missed the point, Harry, the majority of drivers cannot
all drive in the right hand lane to suit the whims of the few Lane
Discipline Nazis...

Now, during off-peak hours, it would be a very good idea if law-abiding
drivers would move as far to the right as "practicable". Then the CHP
would have a clear shot at running down the Lane Discipline Nazis,
citing them for excessive speed, and letting *them* prove the
"lawfulness* of their obnoxious behavior by citing "competent
evidence". I'd probably die of old age sitting in court waiting for a
Lane Discipline Nazi to prove that it was "lawful" to drive 85 mph in
the "fast lane" because of his superior skill as a driver...

The terms "article", "section", "chapter", and "title" all

You say that as if it's inherently a bad thing.  If the law, indeed,

to make that claim.

You, on the other hand, appear to be attempting to claim the law
applies despite all evidence to the contrary.

Article 4 starts at 46.2-837.  Therefore, 46.2-842 and 46.2-823 cannot
be in the same article.  Therefore, 46.2-823 cannot be applied to
46-2.842.

Other evidence in the code suggests that the article referred to in
46.2-823 comprises 46.2-820 through 46.2-823.  But without paying
money to a code publisher, or spending time in the law library, that's
probably not possible to determine.

Well, come ON, Harry! Just admit that you have NO reply because your
interpretation of that old CVC section was simply *wrong*!

Drivers of slow moving vehicles know who they are, just as I said in my
earlier post that you responded to. Three-axle trucks and single axle
vehicles pulling trailers are confined to the two right hand lanes.
Merging vehicles that are allowed to use other lanes than the slow
traffic lanes still have to stay in the truck lanes until they can get
up to "normal" speed for the lanes with 65 and 70 mph speed limits.
Once those vehicles have entered the lanes with high speed limits and
begin cruising at those limits, they are going to be constantly passing
the slow moving vehicles, so they will be legally occupying the higher
speed limit lanes no matter how much the Lane Discipline Nazis piss and
moan about how *unfair* the situation is and the CHP will ignore their
demands that law-abiding drivers be "spanked" for getting in the Lane
Discipline Nazis' way...

That's what this whole trolling thread is about. "C'mon America, ticket
left lane hogs" is a childish appeal to *law enforcement officers* to
spank law-abiidng motorists all over the country and allow the Lane
Discipline Nazis to drive as they please, expecting the traffic snarl
to automatically sort itself out if the anarchy they really want

It would take a traffic court judge to rule on exactly how those

C'mon, PERFORMANCE got nothing to do with RELIABILITY. A car may fast,
have high G on cornering, the best gear box, and still be in the shop
half the time.

The point I raise with performance is that these boring, automatic
American and Japanese car are the vehicle of choice of Mr. Left Lane
Pig. If we moved more people into higher performance stick shift cars
we would at least facilitate the mechanical part of the problem. Well
this should go together with moving people out of driving and into

&gt; Well, come ON, Harry! Just admit that you have NO reply because your
&gt; interpretation of that old CVC section was simply *wrong*!

&gt; Drivers of slow moving vehicles know who they are, just as I said in my
&gt; earlier post that you responded to. Three-axle trucks and single axle
&gt; vehicles pulling trailers are confined to the two right hand lanes.
&gt; Merging vehicles that are allowed to use other lanes than the slow
&gt; traffic lanes still have to stay in the truck lanes until they can get
&gt; up to &quot;normal&quot; speed for the lanes with 65 and 70 mph speed limits.
&gt; Once those vehicles have entered the lanes with high speed limits and
&gt; begin cruising at those limits, they are going to be constantly passing
&gt; the slow moving vehicles, so they will be legally occupying the higher
&gt; speed limit lanes no matter how much the Lane Discipline Nazis piss and
&gt; moan about how *unfair* the situation is and the CHP will ignore their
&gt; demands that law-abiding drivers be &quot;spanked&quot; for getting in the Lane
&gt; Discipline Nazis' way...

&gt; That's what this whole trolling thread is about. &quot;C'mon America, ticket
&gt; left lane hogs&quot; is a childish appeal to *law enforcement officers* to
&gt; spank law-abiidng motorists all over the country and allow the Lane
&gt; Discipline Nazis to drive as they please, expecting the traffic snarl
&gt; to automatically sort itself out if the anarchy they really want
&gt; occurs...
">

Okay, one last try (why bother, others have also tried?).

That is the second time you have referred to that quote as "old".  What
does that have to do with it?  It is part of the California code and
will remain so until repealed or amended until it no longer reads the
way it does even if it gets to be 200 or 1000 years old.

In plain language it defines 'normal' traffic as having nothing to do
with the posted speed limit.

No-one is saying that traffic cannot use the left lane WHILE PASSING.
Only that once clear they are required to move over at least one lane
if possible if someone wants to pass them.

Okay back to the regularly scheduled progarm of Kalifonia K refusing to
read plain English.

You are fond of throwing in the 'lane discipline nazi' bit.  What is
your term for someone who tries to force his speed on someone behind
them?

No, it does not define normal traffic as having nothing to do with the
posted speed limit. If you google up the Basic Speed Law, you'll
discover that you are not supposed to drive any faster than is safe.
The prima facie speed limits are defined as 15 in any alley, or cross
street where you can't see at least 100 feet, or crossing a railroad
track, and 25 mph in a school zone where children are present or near a
senior center or in a business district unless higher speed limits,
e.g. 35 mph are posted. You can be cited for driving less than 15 or 25
or 35 mph if some condition made your speed unsafe, and you'd have to
prove with *competent evidence*
that your speed was safe, just to be found "not guilty" at your court
trial...

The maximum speed limit on a 2-lane state highway is 55 mph *period*
and it's 65 mph *period* or 70 mph *period* on a highway. As above, you
can be cited for "unsafe speed" if you drive 49mph in a 55mph maximum
zone if some condition, like weather, or free roaming range cattle
walking across the highway make driving at the maximum 55 mph limit
unsafe...

Now along come the Endless Stream of Speeding Morons who've grown used
to driving with the pedal to the metal. They think there's something
wrong with the careful law-abiding driver who is aware of the weather,
road construction ahead, livestock hazards, gravel truck crossings,
logging truck crossings, or whatever...

So you have CVC 21654(a) telling the courteous, careful, law-abiding
driver he has to move over as far to the right as possible and let the
fools go by, and forget about slowing down for bad conditions, just let
the idiots GO!

I live in a small town of only 45,000 people. There's a much larger
town to the south, and I can pick one of two ways to get there. I can
take a state highway and west 15 miles at 55mph, and get on a large
4-lane highway and drive southeast 45 miles at 65 mph...

Or, I can take the straight shot, drive due south at 55mph for only 41
miles on the state highway. This state highway has had so many
accidents, it's been identified as a "traffic safety corridor". Signs
say that it is patrolled by radar. In a traffic safety corridor, fines
for speeding would be doubled. A normal $165 ticket for driving 65 in a
55 would become $330 for the first offense. But wait. There's a penalty
assessment of 200% of the fine tacked on to go into the public
treasury. So, if I drive 65 mph
on that highway, I'm looking at a $990 fine if I get caught...

I keep a low profile on that road, but the workers commuting home on
the
state highway seem to be totally unaware of what they are getting into
if they speed. Pulling onto the state highway today, I saw that a lot
of resurfacing was being done, and there were "No Passing" signs
everywhere...

I tried to get into "synch" with some reasonable drivers that were
maintaining at least *some* sense of speed discipline, and I drove as
close to the right hand edge of the road as "practicable", just as CVC
21654(a) tells me to drive. The speeding scofflaws were passing two and
three cars at a time! One large red pickup truck passed three cars
including me, and went on to pass four more cars at the speed he
thought was "normal", about 85 or 90 mph. And all this in construction
zones signed for "No Passing"...

I just drove on at my cautious but illegal 65mph in the 55mph traffic
safety corridor, hoping that I would see the red pickup truck pulled
over, but justice did not prevail today...

(Before the traffic safety corridor fiasco, I was driving along a
narrow road through a river canyon at about 45mph and feeling like I
was taking a bit of a risk going that fast. I was a bit above the prima
facie safe speed of about 35 to 40mph. Looking in my rear view mirror,
I noticed a huge pickup truck bearing down on me, so I pulled out, just
like CVC-21654(a) said I should. He passed and so did a PT Cruiser.
They drove about 55 or 60mph along the narrow winding river canyon road
which has no guard rails,
A car going over the cliff would land in the raging river below and the
driver would have about a 99% chance of drowning if he wasn't killed in
the crash. I knew I would see the pickup truck and the PT Cruiser
again, and sure enough, they were slowed down behind two cars that
wouldn't risk passing a U-Haul moving van. So, was he in violation of
CVC-21654(a), if the car drivers behind him weren't raving lunatics
like the pickup truck driver? He harrassed those cars until *they*
pulled over, and rabidly tailgated the U-Haul driver who was now
definitely in violation of CVC-21654(a), which should be titled "Sane
Drivers Must Pull Over For Lunatics". The pickup truck driver crossed
the double yellow line trying to get around the U-Haul on a blind
curve. I heard the screech of locked up brakes as he had to stop for
oncoming traffic who had to pull off the road to avoid the insane
pickup truck driver. Finally, the lunatic in the pickup truck did get
past the U-Haul driver. It was the third time he'd crossed the double
yellow line.)

Maybe the Lane Discipline Nazis are saying that, but CVC 21654(a)
doesn't prove the LDN case by a long shot

No, "lane discipline" is not what CVC 21654(a) is saying. It's telling
law-abiding cautious drivers to get out of the way of scofflaws and
lunatics who refuse take heed of adverse highway conditions, or obey
the posted maximum speed limits...

If anybody reading this thread really really really *wants* to drive in
some
authoritarian lane discipline scheme such as is enforced on the
autobahn, let him spack up his precious car and go drive there. In the
mean time, we have our own laws, which, sadly are misinterpreted by
morons, and aren't enforced often enough...

It's impossible for a law-abiding driver proceeding at the prima facie
safe speed or the maximum legal speed limit to "enforce" anything. If
the overtaking driver is as crazy as either of the two pickup truck
drivers I saw threatening public safety today, he's just going to put
the pedal to the metal and drive around the law-abiding driver and to
hell with everybody else on the road...

I suppose you did notice that you admitted -more than once- that that
law saws exactly what my post says it did.  Normal traffic is not
defined by a number on a sign post or as specified in the traffic codes
it is understood to be whan the -majority- of the traffic is doing,
i.e., the flow.  When traffic is moving at 10 over and someone is
trying to do 20 over, the 'normal' taffic is the bunch doing 10 over,
not the one doing 20 over.

But then this is pointless as you are nothing but a nazi yourself and
will refuse to see any reason at all if it conflicts with your warped
beliefs, even when it is spelled out in black letters on white paper

want everybody to just get out of their way? After the serious nutcases
in the big pickup trucks passed everybody on the road yesterday, the
less aggressive nutcases just tailgated the drivers ahead, trying to
get them to drive 15 or 20 mph over the speed limit. With all that open
space available, you'd think that intelligent people would be
reasonable and give the other guy some room to drive, but no-o-o-o! The
Lane Discipline Nazis were tailgating each other in a big pack about
half a mile ahead of me...

If you get stopped on a California highway, picked out of such a pack
of 10 or 15 mph over-the-maximum-speed-limit scofflaws, and you try to
tell the arresting officer that you were "just going with the flow of
traffic", you'll get the citation anyway...

When you appear in court and foolishly try to defend yourself by
telling the judge that you were just driving "like everybody else", he
will tell you that a group of citizens *cannot* decide amongst
themselves that they are going to disobey the law...

No, you'd have to post the full bail amount, get a lawyer and appear in
court with *competent evidence* that shows the speed limit was too low,
that an engineering survey hadn't been done in a long time, and that
the
vast majority of "normal" drivers were always driving at the high speed
you were travelling at. Maybe the judge would find you not guilty, if
he was in a reasonable mood...

And that's a one-shot deal! Next time you speed and get caught, you'll
have to post the bail, hire the attorney, and present the same
competent evidence all over again!

The only way the speed limit on any given stretch of road is going to
be raised is when the traffic engineers decide that it's safe for the
public to driver faster and the signs are changed. No sign is going to
be changed that allows drivers to exceed 55 mph on a 2-lane highway, or
to exceed 65 or 75 mph on a freeway until it's authorized by the
bureaucrats...

The scofflaw speed demon Lane Discipline Nazis can howl at the Moon and
post megabytes of argumentative trolling thread on Kooknet saying that
what they are doing is somehow "normal" but nothing will change until
the speed limit signs are changed...

Until then, the cops are going to be writing speeding citations and
we'll still have the "traffic safety corridors" and "special
enforcement zones" with double fines and 200% penalty assessments on
top of of the double fine...

As I said before, driving 10 mph over the limit is going to cost me
almost $1000. I can't afford to spend that kind of money on a speeding
ticket and wind up having my insurance rates raised just because
speeding scofflaws get their kicks playing Speed Racer on public
roads...

I used to notice those strange roadside memorials when I would visit
Mexico.
You know, the bunches of flowers and the cross along a straight rural
road where somebody had died and their relatives would deposit the
flowers to remember the tragedy. Nowadays, I'm seeing those memorials
alongside roads here in California. What they prove to me is that
people who can hardly drive in a straight line shouldn't be speeding or
driving drunk...

And, it's the people memorialized by these little roadside shrines that
are causing the state of California to declare one road after another
as a "traffic safety corridor" or a "special enforcement zone"...

If you live in California, Harry, google up "traffic safety corridor"
on the CalTrans website and see how many you find. There are a whole
bunch of roads where the state wants the speed demons to slow down and
drive intelligently...

Why would another "common person" harrass another "common person" who
was lawfully and peacefully occupying a lane of traffic? Are you the
kind of guy who pushes and shoves people in lines at banks, or in the
checkout lane at the supermarket? When the cabin attendant announces
that the flight is loading handicapped people who need assistance or
women with babes in arm, do you run to the front of the line, shouting,
"Hey, I'm in a hurry! I want to get onto the airplane *first*!"????

I knew a guy who behaved like that, he tried to jump all the lines. One
time he tried to jump in front of a bunch of people waiting to get on a
bus, and the others in the line grabbed him and physically moved him to
the back of the line...

Just the other day, at the DMV, I was second in line waiting for the
door to open, and about 20 people were in line, when some stupid old
woman walked up to me and the guy closer to the door and asked
what the line was for. She said that there were going to be six windows
open, and that she'd been there before, so she wasn't about to wait in
line
again, she was tired of waiting in line, and the people at the DMV had
made a mistake on her paperwork, so why should she wait in line again.
The other people waiting in line were getting pissed and yelling at
her, but she wouldn't go the the end of the line. She stood right by
the two of us at the head of the line and forced her way into the
building. The guy who yielded to her was too easy going. He let her cut
in and she walked straight to the first open window, ahead of everyone
else who'd waited in line...

Pre-school and kindergarten work fine for most children, they grow into
respectful adults who don't harass others. Some people can't learn to
stand in line, wait their turn, or share with others. Some people can't
learn to obey speed limits and not to tailgate other cars. Some people
never learn to wipe their own ass. They become Lane Discipline Nazis
and Kooknet trolls...

That's reasonable.  Anyone travelling more than 10 mph over the prevailing flow
of traffic is really quite visible to law enforcement.  They have to work hard
to work through traffic, and their brake lights, frequent lane changes, and
abrupt speed adjustments are very noticeable.  And the prevailing flow of
traffic is typicall 10 mph over the speed limit where I live.  30 mph over the
limit will garner you a good chance at having your vehicle impounded and
spending some time rustling up bail money.

Otoh, someone who just wants to go a little fast than the traffic in the right
lane understandably becomes frustrated with someone who drives for mile after
mile in the left lane side-by-side with another vehicle in the right lane, just
edging ahead or falling behind abit, never leaving room to pass.

One of the things that makes riding a motorcycle less frustrating than driving a
car in northern Virginia is the enhanced ability to see and get around these
types of rolling road blocks.

You say that like SL +30 speeds are uncommon.  Often the "normal" speed
of traffic is SL +20.  Just yesterday I had to go around the beltway
during the middle of the day; south of I-66 I was doing an indicated 80
MPH and couldn't have been more than the 50th percentile.  Yes that's a
55 zone, so most of the people on the road were technically "reckless."

The real problem is just that the speed limit is so completely out of
touch with reality, and yet it's still used for justification in
arguments like yours.  If the speed limits weren't a complete joke then
your statements might have some merit.

&gt; WTF is LDN?
">

LDN = Lane Discipline Nazi...

One can find striking parallels between the modern Lane Discipline Nazi
and the brown-shirted thugs that flocked to support Adolf Hitler during
the chaotic period between the German civil war of 1922. Then there was
the appeasement of the Nazis by the British before the annexation of
Czechoslovakia and the invasion of Poland in 1939, which set off WW2...

The majority of the brown shirts were veterans of WWI, moronic working
class men, many of whom were perverts, and this is strikingly similar
to the aging Viet Nam veteran bikers who are so likely to become ardent
Lane Discipline Nazis. One estimate of the sexual orientation of urban
bikers indicates that 50% are homosexuals. Generally speaking
homosexuality is such a bizarre pyschosexual personality disorder that
the homosexual is unwillingly to follow any externally imposed rule or
law, they believe that they are exempt from the law and will argue
forever that nobody can make them do anything...

Just try to tell a homo on a motorcycle or in a Porsche that he has to
slow down and stay in line...

The Nazi party had to purge the brown shirts and homosexuals from their
ranks after the NASDAP's assumption of power, as they were too
dangerous to
take part in the new order...

Adolf Hitler had some irredentist beliefs about Czechoslovakia.
Irredentism is a form of nationalism that regards territories that were
once part of some larger nation as being rightfully theirs. The
Zionists cast covetous eyes upon Palestine, even though many of that
nation in exile had no genetic ties whatever to the region. Saddam
Hussein cast irredentist eyes upon Kuwait, claiming it was once part of
the Iraqi province of Mestopotamia. The Chicanos in California have
irredentist claims to a mythical area called "Aztlan" but nobody knows
where it really was...

The future Lane Discipline Nazis suffered great psychological damage
under the 55 mph National Speed Limit. Their egos were badly hurt, they
refused to obey the National Speed Limit, but some finally did slow
down and they began begging and cajoling for the National Speed Limit
to be raised back up to the old 65 mph limit. This was irredentist, in
a way. The 65 mph limit was known and explored territory to the
emerging party of Lane Discipline Nazis...

(It reminds me of Adolf Hitler's demand for the Sudetenland. The Allied
politicians sincerely believed that Hitler wanted peace and that if he
was appeased he'd stop blustering and desist in his aggression towards
his neighbors. Everybody knows he didn't stop there, he wasn't stopped
until he bit off a chunk of territory that was too big for him to
digest: the Soviet Union...)

The emergent Lane Discipline Nazis claimed that they'd abide by the 65
mph limit and they were warned that there would be no tolerance for any
speed over 65 mph...

But the Lane Discipline Nazis also wanted more "territory". They staked
out the lefthand lane as their next "Lebensraum" and demanded that the
civil authorities deport the resident population of law-abiding
motorists. The Lane Discipline Nazi
will continue to make demands, just like Adolf Hitler and the Nazi
Party made demands upon the governments ofneighboring countries. They
let it be known that the other nations had better "just stay out of our
way, if you know what's good for you!"

It's perfectly clear that the Lane Discipline Nazis want NO speed
limits whatever for themselves and their own kind, and they won't be
satisfied until utter anarchy reigns upon the highways of the land...

And yet another parallel to the Nazis of the Third Reich is that they
claim that everything they do is perfectly legal, that they are
operating under the "Law of the Land"...

Of course the Lane Discipline Nazis point to the very extreme
regimentation of the German autobahns (which were originally built to
speed the Wehrmacht across Germany to invade their neighbors) as the
epitome of personal freedom combined with responsibility...

On the almost-empty German autobahn, the driver must drive only on the
right and pass only on the left or be cited. Yet the richest Germans do
get out into the left lane in their powerful luxury sedans and sports
cars and drive for miles, forcing all other traffic out of "their
lane"...

It would be too much to ask from the jungle to civilize itself, but New
Zealand, where Law and Order is still practiced, has some good ideas to
fight Road Rage. Judging by California and Florida (where I live)
Tarzan is still needed though...

Road courtesy initiative launched
National News Release 4:01pm 16 December 2004
Have you made a difference today?

The Canterbury Highway Patrol and the Waimakariri and Hurunui Road
Safety Committees today launched a new road safety campaign being
trialled in North Canterbury.

Sergeant John Robinson says that the campaign is based around the
simple idea that little things can make a big difference.

(...)

Some behaviours to be rewarded are:
· Slower drivers - pull over to let other vehicles past.
· When changing direction or lanes - indicate.
· Pull over and stop to take or make a phone call.
· Let other drivers in - help keep traffic flowing.
· Give them space- allow room around pedestrians, cyclists and horse
riders.
· Re realistic- allow plenty of time for your trip.
· Don't tailgate- keep your distance, remember the two second rule
· Be patient - courtesy is contagious.
· Don't forget to wave and says thanks.

Now be honest, can't you say exactly the same things about many of the
aggressive drivers who harass motorist who are doing nothing more than
trying to drive in a safe and courteous manner? And aggressive drivers also
usually are d) impatient and/or e) rude and/or f) reckless.

I can appreciate the need to remind true LLB's that they are holding up
traffic. However, all too often aggressive drivers take inappropriate
actions if they are forced to slow down to a semi-legal speed for even a few
moments. Someone in the left lane actively passing a slower vehicle is not a
left lane blocker. It is unreasonable for you or anyone else to expect them
to increase their speed to 10 or 15 miles an hour over the posted limits
just because you/they feel empowered to drive at very high speeds.

Courtesy works both ways. It seems to me that many of the more demonstrative
anti-LLB posters are demanding courtesy from others, while exempting
themselves from showing courtesy to others. The attitude expressed by many
of the anti-LLB posters seems to be "I am a qualified high speed driver and
therefore all lesser mortals should clear out of my way. I am special,
therefore I own the left lane. Lesser drivers should give way because I am
so special."

Further more it seems that many of the more demonstrative anti-LLB posters
want to identify anyone who interferes with their perceived (but
non-existent) right to cruise in the left lane at much higher than legal
speeds as an evil LLBer. This is an old technique employed by radicals on
either side of an issue - demonize the behavior of a small group, then
expand the definition of the group to others people you want to attack.

Speed limits are a joke becasue Citizens have made them a joke. Just becasue
everybody is doing it, it is not necessarily right. Maybe speed limits are
too low, I don't know that for a fact. I certainly prefer higher limits.
However, I routinely drive a road with a 65 mph speed limt and feel that
that limit is too high for conditions during certain periods. However, I am
no so stupid that I try to drive at what I consider a safe speed since this
would almost cerainly contribute to an already unsafe situation (just
driving the speed limit is a good way to be tailgated and flashed, even in
the right lane). However, if the speed limt was lower, say 60, and fairly
enforced, I believe the accident rate would be reduced.

I feel that many drivers are over confident of their driving abilities. Many
of the people who drive the most agressively are actaully among the worst
drivers on the road.

&gt;not at all. KRETP is there for a reason. if the passing person is

A big problem with hammering out an agreement on these two positions
is that they can each be equally valid, or invalid, depending on the
situation.  Many faster drivers are indeed overly aggressive and
impatient, and are not actively observing traffic when climbing up the
bumper of a vehicle in the LH lane.  Many slow drivers actively seek
leftmost lanes, largely out of laziness - it's less work when a driver
doesn't have to be observant of merging traffic.

&gt;and they either know it or have serious problems with reality.
">

And it is equally valid to state that a driver going 90mph has a
problem with reality if they expect a driver passing at 75 in a 65 to
speed up to 90 to execute the pass.  Sometimes, the driver of a
vehicle in the process of being passed will act in a manner to try to
hamper the passing vehicle safely completing the maneuver.  An
over-aggressive driver then tailgating the original passing vehicle
just adds to the mayhem.

The bottom line is courtesy, awareness, and knowledge of the law.  If
all drivers kept these parameters high in their minds on the road,
there would be far less chaos.  But then, that wouldn't be human.

There's a big difference between an "aggressive driver" as you describe

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I can appreciate the need to remind true LLB's that they are holding up
&gt; traffic. However, all too often aggressive drivers take inappropriate

My guess is that the speeds aren't quite as high as you're claiming, but
they're definitely not as low as Scott claims.  If I-495 is anything

68 to 73 mph and the 85th percentile speed is around 73 to 78 mph.

Just a comment. It's INHUMAN to keep the status quo, and has little to
do with "human nature" and much to do with LACK OF ENFORCEMENT AND THE
ABSCENSE OF THE RULE OF LAW. In the meantime, try to survive!

You may as well be armed against the likes of Kritter. Use your bazooka
bubblegum, or just show him the banana. ;)

Another argument for a Banana Revolution is as follows...

The monkey knows that the lion is more powerful than him, and knows he
better use his own weapons, so he decides to be funny, that being his
natural gift. And he also realizes that the lion--a beautiful
lioness--is very aggressive for lack of love. So the FUNNY MONKEY
offers his banana to the lioness who, moved by that act of tenderness,
and checking the banana, falls madly in love with him. And it is said
they lived happily ever after...

Moral: The best weapon the monkey got is the banana (symbolizing love
and laughter).

According to the Bible, the Lion was once a vegetarian, so, in order to
pacify him, we can "GIVE THE BANANA TO THE LION." See pictures...

">

You managed to step into a mild flame war between me and the troll who
started this silly thread demanding that law-abiding driver be spanked
by LEO's when they aren't the problem. I'm going to answer your
question...

I'm talking about California, here, I'm not talking about some rural
state with obsolete laws and no real traffic problems. I've been
driving here for 44 years, I know the laws, I know what's common
courtesy and what is abusive of the
law-abiding citizens who are suffering from the actions of
self-absorbed delusional speeders...

Right off the bat, forget the "line of 5 or more cars" straw that
you're obviously grasping at. There's a CVC section (CVC 21656) that
says slow-moving vehicles have to use the turnouts on *two-lane
highways* when five or more cars are behind them. Your scenario takes
place on a limited access freeway, and the law-abiding driver is NOT
wrong for obeying the speed limit, nor is he wrong for remaining in the
left hand lane...

But I wouldn't even BE in that hypothetical position. I know how and
when to move out of the #1 lane and when to move into it to reduce my
travel time without violating any law...

Whenever the road opens up ahead and there is 100 yards of clear space,
the out-of-control lunatics act like somebody has taken away their
lollypop, they've just *got* to speed up and get it back. If they see a
single car ahead in the left lane and there's a mile of empty space
ahead of that car, they act as though that driver is committing
blasphemy against all that is sacred...

I know that the lunatic left lane scofflaws are going to start
tailgating each other, and me, and that makes me very very nervous, so
I avoid cruising in the lefthand lane when speeds start getting into
the highly illegal lunatic range...

But, during rush hours, when traffic across the San Gabriel and San
Fernando valleys is at its peak, the left lane is regulated down to the
speed limit or less by the sheer VOLUME of traffic. Every lane is
needed to move the massive volume of rush hour traffic. California
CANNOT afford the luxury of reserving the left lane for speeders
only...

At that point, most of the left lane speed demons are resigned to the
fact that they just are NOT going to get around a lane of
bumper-to-bumper cars stretching from horizon to horizon. And the
majority of the morons are smart enough to quit changing lanes and
jockeying for position...

However, the fools usually do consider that any space of about two car
lengths is an invitation to move into it and tailgate the car ahead of
them. The 8 car length space you hypothesized would not exist for very
long on the Ventura freeway or the San Bernardino freeway from 7AM to
9AM or 3PM to 6PM...

But you wanted to talked about who is WRONG in the hypothetical case
you proposed. The cars passing on the right of the driver cruising at
the posted speed limit are in the WRONG, if they are exceeding the
maximum speed limit. They are not wrong for passing on the right, since
passing on the right is not illegal on California freeways...

Now, I'll address how the bunch of right hand passers got into the #2
lane in the first place to try to pass the law-abiding driver
proceeding at the speed limit. The #2 lane is an endless stream of
other law-abiding drivers who are doing what the #1 lane driver is
accused of. They are driving at the speed limit and they won't go any
faster. The law-abiders in the #2 lane are a wall of moving metal
restricting the scofflaws from easily moving around the law-abiding
driver to grab that precious few hundred feet of "fast lane" for
themselves...

The bunch of drivers wanting to pass the law-abiding driver that
supposedly "blocking" the #1 lane would have to make unsafe lane
changes and FORCE their way into the line of traffic in the #2 lane to
get there at all. It's highly unlikely that a whole line of faster cars
would be able to proceed for very far in the #2 lane during rush
hour...

The drivers bunched up behind the driver cruising at the speed limit
can't be speeding, but they are following each other too closely. They
are in violation of the Basic Speed Law that says you can't drive
faster than is safe. There are recommended following distances of about
2 or 3 seconds behind the car ahead...

The law-abiding driver should be from 190 to 286 feet beyond the car
ahead of him, but that safety cushion just isn't going to exist for
long with the impatient scofflaw drivers driving at excessive speed to
the right of the law-abiding driver. They are going to try to jam as
many of their cars into that space as possible, then they are going to
harass and tail gate each other as they continue down the road, trying
to force their way through the situation instead of relaxing and
obeying the speed laws and respecting each other's right to to use the
road lawfully...

The asshats passing on the right are going to jump into the law-abiding
driver's recommended safety cushion so they can continue to drive like
asshats...

And the law-abiding driver cruising in the #1 lane at the legal speed
limit is *NOT* slower traffic. The three axled trucks and two-axled
vehicles towing trailers are the "slower traffic" referred to by the
"SLOWER TRAFFIC KEEP RIGHT"
sign. If they are driving in lanes to the left of the two righthand
lanes, they may be cited unless the reason for being in another lane
besides the two righthand lanes is that they need to use, say, the #2
lane to continue on their planned route. But they are restricted to
driving at a maximum of 55 mph, and they are NOT illegal if they are
slowing the poor little speeders down below the 75 or 80 mph they would
like to believe they had the right to drive at...

If you carefully read CVC 21654(a) and (b) you will figure out that the
law-abiding driver in the lefthand lane only has to drive at the speed
limit or be passing *any other* vehicle and he can remain there for as
long as he wants...

If he's driving 65 in 65 zone, and the slower moving 3-axle trucks and
2-axle vehicles in the #3 and #4 lanes are driving at 55mph, there's no
lawful reason that the law-abiding driver has to move over to the right
for the scofflaws, since he is in the act of passing somebody slower
ALL THE TIME...

The business in CVC 21654(a) about "not withstanding the prima facie
speed limits" means that he can't defend himself by saying that he was
driving slower than the speed limit because it was "unsafe" to drive
that fast. The business about "normal speed in that situation" cannot
be interpreted to say that "normal speed" is a speed in excess of the
maximum speed limit, but "normal speed" might be much less than the
speed limit...

And, competent evidence to defend the law-abiding driver against a
citation of failing to move to the right would likely be nothing more
than a photograph of an existing speed limit sign and perhaps a speedo
calibration slip from AAA...

they effectively don't exist (even though GWB goes on and on about how
bad people are who "hate freedom") so moving to a country where at least
the drivers are courteous and they don't pretend to have the freedoms
that we used to might just work out to be better.

So... are you part of the problem, or part of the solution?  Sounds to
me like you're part of the problem.

&gt; IME, all it takes is a FOIA request along with a trip to the DOT

Well... I'm ASSuming that HQ would be in Richmond which is a little out

&gt; My guess is that the speeds aren't quite as high as you're claiming, but
&gt; they're definitely not as low as Scott claims.  If I-495 is anything
&gt; like a typical interstate highway, the median speed is probably around
&gt; 68 to 73 mph and the 85th percentile speed is around 73 to 78 mph.

I really don't feel that I am exaggerating AT ALL, but you do have to
hit the road at just the right time otherwise congestion slows it down.
However, those numbers are probably representative of what a speed
survey would show, due to the heavy volume of traffic at most times -
which still would prove my point, that a 55 MPH speed limit is just asinine.

Most of us live where we live because we're rooted in the locality and
our income derives from the local economy. The average American
probably couldn't afford to live in Germany.
But we are a hell of a lot freer than they are. At least we can move

Big Fat gummint ain't doing much but getting fat itself. I cited the
other day that 25,000 lives could be saved each year if we reached the
safety standards of Sweden. But Big Fat gummint choses to ignore that
SAFETY IS THE CONSEQUENCE OF A SMART AND COMPREHENSIVE LAWS, not just
DUIs and speeding. And if gummint doesn't like socialist Sweden then it
can choose "Nazi" Germany (he, he) or socialist UK, whith whom we are
partners in crime, if you know what I mean... ;)

So if you happen to bump into such dinosaur tell him to GET SMART,
EVOLVE, ALLOW COMPETITION AND GET ON A DIET. Banana doesn't sound bad
for starters.

EVOLVE OR ELSE!

Once upon a time lived a race of dinosaurs whose violence and appetite
alarmed everybody... One day a Little Ant, tired of feeling stepped
upon, and worried about her cooperative enterprise, came up to the
Americanus Raptor--the biggest dinosaur of them all--and asked: "Why
you eat and eat everything in your path? Why don't you slim down? Why
can't we little animals at least have our own way?" Then the dinosaur,
blowing the Little Ant away, shouted: "Bigger is better, so get lost!"

The Little Ant, then, gathered the whole cooperative and said:
"Comrades, our world is being threatened by the dinosaurs, so..." And
at that precise moment the Earth was hit by a big ball of fire,
destroying all but the small animals...

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Besides, using KK's analogy, what kind of person would walk along a corridor
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;side by side with another person, blocking someone (or dozens, or hundreds of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;persons!) behind them, without ever moving over or speeding up, out of common

In my experience, speeds on the capitol beltway have a bimodal

I wonder if we substitute a word in it, people would still trust it...

"A government of the lawyers, by the lawyers and for the lawyers, but
voted upon by the citizens..."

This is only a (paid) political ad...

"Greedy, money-grubbing lawyers control the Alabama legislature. Greedy
lying lawyers control Alabama's courtrooms. Most of the time a greedy
lying lawyer occupies the Governor's house. Heavily influenced by his
two lawyer children, Governor Riley wants Alabama citizens to believe
government can be -

By the people, For the People and Of the People

While lawyers control all state public offices - the people suffer
under tyranny.

Riley's billion $$$ tax plan will finance the greedy, money-grubbing
lawyers to take more and more from the poor. For those concerned about
helping our schools, Riley admits the billion $$$ tax plan will
actually take away tax revenues from several city school systems.

Even more depressing, our business and civic leaders are marching
lock-step in time with Riley's plan to rape and plunder Alabama
citizens.

Riley wants to lessen voters' cynicism about government. Justifiably
Alabama citizens are cynical about spend thrifty and unaccountable
government."

Speed limits actually contribute to more crashes.  See:

http://www.tfhrc.gov/safety/speed/speed.htm

Note that there are MORE crashes at any speed much above or BELOW the
AVERAGE speed.  Thus setting limits too low - much below average - actually
causes more wrecks.  Cars travelling as little as 10 MPH under have twice
the wrecks.

I seldom go to the links posted on NG's, then maybe I scan them and if
anything looks interesting, I bookmark them for future reference but
rarely return to that site, if ever

But, you must have read the info on the gummint website, so you can
tell me
how the gummint *knows* how fast cars were going at the moment of
impact...

What is the gummint basing this claim of twice the wrecks at 10mph
under the limit on, anyway? Anecdotal evidence based on the testimony
of the drivers involved in the accidents? What do you except drivers to
tell investigators, anyway?

Certainly the tailgating drivers and those drivers passing him are
wrong!

To sum up, the driver proceeding in the lefthand lane at the posted
speed limit, 8 car lengths behind the nearest car is doing nothing
unlawful.

The drivers that are driving bumper to bumper behind him are in
violation of CVC 21703 and CVC 22350.

The drivers that are passing the law-abiding driver are in violation of

CVC 22350, 22438, and 22349 or maybe even 22356. They are also probably
in violation of CVC 21703 as they jockey for position and tailgate each
other so they can duck into the 2 to 3 second interval recommended by
the DMV. Then they will be violating CVC 21703 for sure.

Problem is they could make the law-abiding driver violate CVC 21703
until he slows down to resume to safe recommended following distance.
Or he could decide to just go ahead and drive like an asshole, like the
rest of the scofflaws around him.

The reason that a lot of citations aren't written during peak rush hour
is that the California Highway Patrol can't easily maneuver their
patrol cars in heavy traffic. It's a lot easier to do a special
enforcement activity during off-peak hour traffic on the freeway. Then
they can catch the scofflaw dipshits driving at 100+ miles per hour...

Following Too Closely
21703. The driver of a motor vehicle shall not follow another vehicle
more closely than is reasonable and prudent, having due regard for the
speed of such vehicle and the traffic upon, and the condition of, the
roadway.

Excessive Speed and Designated Lane Use
22348. (a) Notwithstanding subdivision (b) of Section 22351,  a person
shall not drive a vehicle upon a highway with a speed limit established
pursuant to Section 22349 or 22356 at a speed greater than that speed
limit.

Maximum Speed Limit
22349. (a) Except as provided in Section 22356, no person may drive a
vehicle upon a highway at a speed greater than 65 miles per hour.
(b) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no person may drive a
vehicle upon a two-lane, undivided highway at a speed greater than 55
miles per hour unless that highway, or portion thereof, has been posted
for a higher speed by the Department of Transportation or appropriate
local agency upon the basis of an engineering and traffic survey. For
purposes of this subdivision, the following apply:
(1) A two-lane, undivided highway is a highway with not more than one
through lane of travel in each direction.
(2) Passing lanes may not be considered when determining the number of
through lanes.
(c) It is the intent of the Legislature that there be reasonable
signing on affected two-lane, undivided highways described in
subdivision (b) in continuing the 55 miles-per-hour speed limit,
including placing signs at county boundaries to the extent possible,
and at other appropriate locations.

Basic Speed Law
22350. No person shall drive a vehicle upon a highway at a speed
greater than is reasonable or prudent having due regard for weather,
visibility, the traffic on, and the surface and width of, the highway,
and in no event at a speed which endangers the safety of persons or
property.

Speed Law Violations
22351. (a) The speed of any vehicle upon a highway not in excess of the
limits specified in Section 22352 or established as authorized in this
code is lawful unless clearly proved to be in violation of the basic
speed law.
(b) The speed of any vehicle upon a highway in excess of the prima
facie speed limits in Section 22352 or established as authorized in
this code is prima facie unlawful unless the defendant establishes by
competent evidence that the speed in excess of said limits did not
constitute a violation of the basic speed law at the time, place and
under the conditions then existing.

http://www.dmv.ca.gov/pubs/vctop/d11/vc22352.htm

Increase of Freeway Speed Limit to 70 Miles Per Hour
22356. (a) Whenever the Department of Transportation, after
consultation with the Department of the California Highway Patrol,
determines upon the basis of an engineering and traffic survey on
existing highway segments, or upon the basis of appropriate design
standards and projected traffic volumes in the case of newly
constructed highway segments, that a speed greater than 65 miles per

Simple reply, unless you are actually passing people, get out of the

You might be breaking the law, by not allowing people to pass.

Pay attention, Harry! The subject of Skip's question was about cars on
the
FREEWAY! What kind of FREEWAY allows cars to turn LEFT, across oncoming
lanes of traffic that aren't going to stop? What could the legislators
have been thinking about when they wrote CVC 21654. Is a highway the
same thing as a freeway?

No, not exactly. CVC 332. "Freeway" is a highway in respect to which
the owners of abutting lands have no right or easement of access to or
from their abutting lands or in respect to which such owners have only
LIMITED or restricted right or easement of access. Oh, I suppose you
could find some limited access highway where a landowner could pull off
to the right and get on his property, but I doubt that you'll ever find
a limited access highway where a landowner can make a left turn onto
his land...

360. "Highway" is a way or place of whatever nature, publicly
maintained and open to the use of the public for purposes of vehicular
travel. Highway includes street.

And, why didn't you cite the entire text of CVC 21654? You neglected to
cut and paste:

(c) The Department of Transportation, with respect to state highways,
and local authorities, with respect to highways under their
jurisdiction, may place and maintain upon highways official signs
directing slow-moving traffic to use the right-hand traffic lane except
when overtaking and passing another vehicle or preparing for a left
turn.

Now, what exactly IS a slow moving vehicle? I told you on Sunday that a
slow moving vehicle was a 3 axled truck, 2-axled auto or truck towing a
trailer etc.
That's covered in CVC 22406 Speed for Designated Vehicles...

And where do the designated slow moving vehicles have to drive? That's
covered in
21655 Designated Lanes for Certain Vehicles...

So, what if CVC 21654 really was never intended as a "left lane
clearing" ordinance for a freeway? What section might actually apply?

Yes, the problem has been recognized that some scofflaw drivers really
will want to be Left Lane Blockers, that they will behave as
vigilantes, trying to regulate or interfere with other law-abiding
drivers trying to use the left lane to proceed at the speed limit...

22400 Minimum Speed Law
(a) No person shall drive upon a highway at such a slow speed as to
impede or block the normal and REASONABLE movement of traffic, unless
the reduced speed is *necessary for safe operation*, because of a
grade, or *in compliance with law*.
No person shall bring a vehicle to a complete stop upon a highway so as
to IMPEDE OR BLOCK THE NORMAL AND REASONABLE MOVEMENT of traffic unless
the stop *is necessary for safe operation* or *in compliance with law*.

(b) Whenever the Department of Transportation determines on the basis
of an engineering and traffic survey that slow speeds on any part of a
state highway consistently impede the normal and reasonable movement of
traffic, the department may determine and declare a minimum speed limit
below which no person shall drive a vehicle, except when necessary for
safe operation or in compliance with law, when appropriate signs giving
notice thereof are erected along the part of the highway for which a
minimum speed limit is established.
Subdivision (b) of this section shall apply only to vehicles subject to
registration.

Whoops! What does that "vehicles subject to registration" mean? OK,
these following vehicles might be found on a highway, requiring the
Slow Moving Vehicles Designated in CVC 22406 to move over into the left
lane, and that might seriously disrupt the anarchist Lane Discipline
Nazi's attempt to drive as fast as he pleases on the highway:

4010.   Special construction equipment and special mobile equipment are
exempt from registration.

4012.   Any vehicle, implement, or equipment specifically designed or
altered for and used exclusively in the maintenance or operating of
cemetery grounds, which is only incidentally operated or moved on a
highway is exempt from registration.

4013.   Any forklift truck which is designed primarily for loading and
unloading and for stacking materials and is operated upon a highway
only for the purpose of transporting products or material across a
highway in the loading, unloading or stacking process, and is in no
event operated along a highway for a greater distance than one-quarter
mile is exempt from registration.

4015.   Any privately owned vehicle designed or capable of being used
for firefighting purposes when operated upon a highway only in
responding to and returning from, emergency fire calls is exempt from
registration.

4018.   Any logging vehicle is exempt from registration.

4019.   A golf cart operated pursuant to Section 21115 is exempt from
registration.

4020.   A motorized bicycle operated upon a highway is exempt from
registration.

4021.   Any vehicle that is designed or altered for, and used
exclusively for, the refueling of aircraft at a public airport is
exempt from registration, if the vehicle is operated upon a highway
under the control of a local authority for a continuous distance not
exceeding one-half mile each way to and from a bulk fuel storage
facility.

Thanks for the cite, but it sounds like that 41 year old study is
obsolete. Automotive technology and driver skills and highway
experience have improved exponentially since LBJ was president.

We've had about two generations since then of drivers learning to
operate motor vehicles and getting licensed...

First was a rebellious generation who didn't trust government and broke
whatever rule was made just to show they could break it. My girlfriend
(who was about 10 years younger than me) demanded to know why I always
stopped for stop signs. She actually said, "No cop, no stop."

With parents like that who didn't believe in the basic rules of the
road, and the next generation having grown up with newer technology
cars that never broke down, never had brake failures or blown out
tires, it's not surprising that drivers get tail ended as the traffic
signal turns green.

The younger, unskilled driver has learned to drive 15 to 20 mph over
the limit, and expects that everyone else will do so and that none of
the other cars on the road will have a mechanical failure.

I didn't learn to drive that way at all. I was taught to drive by a
friend from Pennsylvania who taught me to test my brakes before
reaching a stop sign, and to go through intersections at less than the
speed limit. My friend told me that Pennsylvania didn't give away
driver's licenses as a Cracker Jack box
prize, that some people had to go back several times to get their
license...

I was surprised when I passed the California driving exam on the first
attempt. The bureaucrat gave me a score of 70, the minimum passing
score. I was a terrible, dangerous driver, hardly knowing the rules of
the road, but I was very cautious, remembering all the things my friend
had taught me...

For the first ten years I was probably kept alive by the patience and
experience of older drivers. Now I'm the one avoiding the dangerous
drivers doing stupid stunts. I keep my cool...

Cars and drivers have come a long way since then...

&gt; &gt; by a U-shaped curve. Crash rates were lowest for travel speeds near the mean
&gt; &gt; speed of traffic, and increased with greater deviations above and below the
&gt; &gt; mean. The estimated travel speed from the accident records were compared to
&gt; &gt; the speeds measured at representative sites within each study section. The

I cannot infer from the Solomon study that crash-involved drivers were
necessarily crashing into each other, but I can guess that may have
been true in some percentage of the accidents. You probably want to
believe the study was dealing mostly with faster vehicles crashing into
slower vehicles because this thread is about the on-going turf battle
for the left hand lane...

Still, the question remains, would you rather be rear-ended by a
scofflaw (who doesn't *care* about your safety) driving at 80 mph, or
be hit by a law-abiding citizen who makes a mistake at 40 mph?

You can take a plea for rational speed laws to great extremes. The
anarchists are in the ludricous position of saying they want a LAW that
says there are no speed limits...

Now you're throwing out the other extreme, suggesting a 5 mph national
limit...

Those of us who can remember the old 65 mile per hour limit of the
1960's also remember an era when we knew that we'd be cited for driving
over that limit. As I've stated many times, the anarchists begged for
the 55 mph national speed limit to be repealed so they could just drive
at 65 mph again...

But once the 55 mph limit was repealed and the states were able to set
their own higher limits, the anarchists went crazy on the highways,
driving 70, then 80, 90, even 100 mph on open roads where traffic was
sparse...

And they looked around themselves and said, "This is wonderful. Now we
can finally drive on these roads the way they were *intended* to be
driven on."

Problem is, the wide, straight empty roads were *never* designed so
anarchists could speed on them, they were designed to carry a lot of
traffic at peak hours, with all lanes being used, no lanes could be
reserved for speeding anarchists...

And the wide flat empty roads still have a lot of dangerous overpass
pillars and steel guard rails and things for the speeding anarchist to
hit and kill himself on...

And, if authorities continue to allow speeding anarchists to do as they
please, they will hurt innocent people who are driving "only" 65 mph...

If you want to throw out extreme suggestions like a 5 mph national
speed limit, let me throw one out. How about if the government says,
"OK, you really don't want any speed limits or any rules at all, so we
are declaring the vehicle code null and void, we're disbanding the
highway patrol, we're closing the DMV offices, we're no longer going to
maintain the roads or a 911 emergency call center. Go ahead, drive as
you please, don't bother to call for EMT's, we're laying all of them
off. If you crash and get hurt, you're on your own, nobody will come to
pick you up except the buzzards."

Then wait and see how long it takes for the anarchists to come crawling
back, begging, "Oh, pwease, sir. Give us our laws back. We need laws,
we just didn't know that before..."

No, I used some very long posts to carefully show how the vehicle code

I certainly hope that Harry doesn't drive in California with his
ridiculous ideas that everybody has to get out of his way so he can
speed. Eventually he may get into a road rage incident with a
law-abiding citizen who is ready for his assault and who is sick and

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Harry called it exactly WRONG. The section he took out of context and
cited incompletely is very obviously about driving on *surface
streets*, not on limited access FREEWAYS. Your question was about
driving on FREEWAYS and you obviously have some absurd idea that a
law-abiding driver has to get out of the way any time there are five
vehicles following him...

Then, if I told you what law did say that slower moving vehicles had to
turn out when followed by five cars, you'd claim that I was
"obfuscating" the issue...

If there is any "obfuscation" taking place, it's in your mind. You have
only the foggiest notion of the Rules of the Road which are codified in
the California Vehicle Code, and, if you drive as you seem to indicate
from your rigged question, you are are committing one infraction after
another...

Please tell me that you don't drive like that in California...

Oh, yes. Throwing out even more extreme suggestions and vilifying the
silent majority certainly helps the discussion....

Removing automobiles from society won't remove the problem of
transporting people from where they live to where they work. Efficient
public transportation systems don't exist in most parts of America, for
the simple reason that 85% of the country is interior and lightly
populated...

85% of the world's population lives near the ocean because water
transportation was historically the best way to transport raw materials
and manufactured goods. The cities and factories were usually built
within 15 miles of the ocean. The middle class people used to live in
the cities, now they've moved to the suburbs to be away from the cities
and they make each other miserable twice everyday commuting to and from
the city where thet still need to work...

Then some of them sit in their cubicles at work typing to Usenet about
how *bad* the traffic jams they cause themselves every day are...

The population should be forced to move back to the cities to be right
where they work. Factories should have barracks for the workers who
operate the machines, and office buildings should have dorms for the
cubicle workers to solve the people moving problem. Then the cubicle
workers won't have any traffic jams to complain about...

What will they type about then? Will they type, "Hey, John. You know
that fat broad two cubicles down? Well, that fat broad just farted
again. That's so selfish. We have to breathe the same air she just
polluted with her selfishness. Why couldn't she just hold it. I've been
holding my farts, waiting for the recess buzzer, you hold your farts
waiting for the recess buzzer, why can't she hold her farts? We need a
law to outlaw fat broads farting before recess, yannow?

Oh, wait, does my "move the middle class back to the city" idea sound
like a Socialist solution? Am I a brain-dead kommunist? Don't answer
that, or I'll call you an elitist dreamer...

Really? Thanks for the news flash. I understand well removing
automobiles won't remove the problem of transporting people, and that
the majority of our populace, being spread out as it is, can not rely

But it's not my idea to reduce speed limits in order to reduce
accidents; that's your idea, and that of a few other deluded twits who
run through this group. Your logic being that the lower the speed
limit, the less traffic accidents there will be. By extending your own

That misery can be easily alleviated with proper lane discipline. Of
course, without it, we turn a lot of asphalt into a parking lot, and
the only way to spend our time while we're parked is to fire up the
cell phone, play with the audio system, and munch on some fries.

Teach people how to drive, and watch people get to where they are

That doesn't answer the question of whether you'd rather be rear-ended
by a scofflaw (who doesn't *care* about your safety) driving at 80 mph,
or be hit by a law-abiding citizen who makes a mistake driving at 40
mph...

The scofflaws are everywhere now, believing that the lefthand lane is
some kind of lane reserved for speeders only, and they loudly claim
that the law-abiding driver occupying that lane is somehow rude or even
illegal...

Now you come along and say that I should watch my rear view mirrors and
be in the correct lane...

I have news for you. If I am in ANY lane on the freeway, driving at the
speed limit, I am in  the "correct" lane. There is NO "fast lane"
anywhere in California. We don't have the luxury of allowing the left
lane to be reserved for speeders only. We need ALL the lanes to move
rush hour traffic...

All lanes on a highway have the same posted speed limits. Drivers are
not allowed to exceed the posted speed limits on any silly pretense
that the law-abiding driver ahead of them is somehow being "rude"...

The worst of the speeding scofflaws will find that they are unable to
pass a group of cars
following a law-abiding driver in the left lane. They find that they
can't pass the endless line of law-abiding in the #2 lane either, they
can't get around that one law-abiding driver whose behavior upsets
them. So they drive all the way over into the TRUCK LANES, where the
truckers are required to drive 55 mph and 300 feet apart...

Then they cut between the trucks and maybe even use part of an extended
on-ramp to accelerate to 100 mph so they can move down the road half a
mile to find a place where they can jam their way back through the
law-abiding trucks, back through the line of law-abiding cars traffic

between the law-abiding driver and the several cars who are tailgating
the next law-abiding driver.

They will do this same trick several times over the next ten or twenty
miles and they won't gain a minute over the car that was behind them
before they started swooping around all traffic, risking everybody's
lives to feed their own petty egos. They are sometimes driving at a
differential speed of 35 to 40 miles an hour over what the law abiding
drivers are trying to do...

These speeding scofflaws have almost everybody on the freeway
terrorized. That's why there's an endless line of law-abiding drivers
stacked up from horizon to horizon going across the San Fernando
valley. Many of them wish they could just drive in the left lane
without being hassled by the crazy people...

How would you describe yourself, KK?  MFFY or wanna-be cop?  Considerate
driver sharing the road wouldn't fit you at all.

I'd love to see you try this tactic in Germany or Italy.  KRETP laws are
actually enforced there.

Ive found that if you ride, while finding yourself a safe zone to ride
in, you can stay out of most high risk situation. Keep a distance zone
around you and other vehicles. Always have an "exit" strategy, (A
direction go go when all hell breaks loose.) Or at least a soft place to
land. I like the right lane for that purpose. Defensive driving and
management of your space on the road and the space around you can do
wonders. After 45 years of driving and riding without an accident, This
IMHO. It is your job to not occupy the same space as another vehicle. If
it happens, you screwed up. It's also your job to master your vehicle.
How it moves, how it stops. Get good at that and you can minimize the
risk. Cause lightning or lack of attention to detail can happen to
anyone. Luck of the draw, you might say.

Nope, I not MFFY, nor a wanna-be cop. I'm a law-abiding drive. Most

it tough to commute to and from work in California. I'm an extremely

scofflaws who believe in the urban myth that the lefthand lane is some
kind of "fast lane" or "passing lane". In the state of California the
left lane is neither a "fast lane", nor a "passing lane". California
has so much traffic on its highways, all lanes are needed to move heavy
traffic. All that tailgating or flashing lights or blowing horns proves

Oh, yes it would. I've been driving for 44 years in California and have
never had an accident. And the California Highway Patrol pays no
attention to me as I drive my truck or car. They check out motorcycles
and sports cars though. Owners of those type of vehicles don't get away
with very much, especially when they are out there on a wide open
interstate trying to test their belief that the left lane is a "fast
lane"...

Cheezus, why don't they hang an "arrest me" sign in the back window of
their car? The highway patrol loves it when speeders confine themselves
to that one lane and make a high speed run. They are much easier to
catch that way. The CHP car just cruises along in the righthand lane
slightly ahead and to the right of a truck in the #2 lane and the the
speeding scofflaw doesn't see the cop car until it's on his rear bumper
with the red lights flashing...

What tactic? Why do you want to bring up this crap about Germany or
Italy, anyway? If you live there, drive according to the law. If you
don't live there, drive according to the law of the state you live
in...

Driving continuously in the left hand lane at the speed limit is NOT
illegal in the state of California as long as you're driving at the
normal speed of traffic for that situation or time of day. The normal
speed of traffic cannot exceed the maximum speed limits which I posted
previously...

California has NO "keep right except to pass" law. Your citing of such
a concept indicates that you probably live and drive in some rural
state where a "big" highway is two lanes in either direction separated
by a grass median strip. California has huge freeways with SIX lanes of
traffic separated by concrete barriers. Slower traffic is required to
drive in the two rightmost lanes. Slower traffic knows who they are.
Passenger cars and motorcycles are NOT slower traffic, they can drive
in ANY lane continuously, so long as they drive at, or near the speed
limit and they will never be stopped by the highway patrol...

However, they, they will be annoyed constantly by speeding scofflaws
who believe that the lefthand lane is some kind of "fast lane" or
"passing lane"...

Once more, California has NO passing lanes or fast lanes anywhere, and
you won't even find the term "fast lane" in the California Vehicle
Code...

Except for the fact of CA state law, which you continue to ignore. It

this:

21654.  (a) **Notwithstanding the prima facie speed limits,** any

be driven in the right-hand lane for traffic or as close as practicable

I proved you wrong on this about a week ago in this thread; I can't
believe you're still trying to sell that canard. "Notwithstanding the
prima facie speed limits" means that normal traffic speed is something
different than the speed limits. At times the normal flow could well be
under the limit; many times, it is over it, and this is what the
statute recognizes.

We were talking about what the responsibilities of a driver in the
lefthand lane of a California freeway were, if followed by five cars
and other cars were passing him on the right, even though he was
obeying the maximum speed limit...

Do you even have a FREEWAY around Lubbock which has four lanes in
either direction, divided by a concrete barrier topped by a fence with
aggressive
pickup truck drivers trying to get onto the freeway faster than traffic
on the freeway is going, so they can push and shove their way over to
the left lane and begin crowding the drivers already there?

Last time I was in Lubbock, there was nothing but a four lane divided
highway with 2 lanes in either direction and tumbleweed in the
middle...

If you don't have such a multi-lane divided freeway, and you haven't
driven in Los Angeles in rush hour traffic, you wouldn't know that the
righthand lane may be the most dangerous lane of all...

In the right hand lane, you can get hit from all sides. In the left
lane, it's not so bad. Most California riders use the lefthand lane so
they will be set up to "lane share" or "split lanes" when the cages
slow down...

You talk about "defensive driving and management of your space on the
road" as if that is even possible. When riding a motorcycle on
California freeways in the lefthand lane (which is not a "fast lane" or
a "passing lane") I can split lanes at high speed and get into a clear
space. But it won't *stay* clear for more than a few seconds before
cars from the crowded
#2 lane start filling up the open space, in the belief that they will
finally be able speed all the way to their destination.

So, very quickly my cushion space is gone, I'm following a car
following a car following a car, and so on, clear to the horizon, and a
tailgating scofflaw will be eating my ass up. If I don't drive dead
center on the cage in front of me, the tail gating scofflaw will take
that as an invitation to PASS me in the same lane, as if lane-sharing
was up to the car driver, not the motorcycle rider who's usually
passing cars while pretending he's just "lane-sharing"...

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;be hit by a law-abiding citizen who makes a mistake at 40 mph?

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Proper rear view mirror and lane utilization will greatly reduce the
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;possibility of being rear-ended by anyone, except at traffic lights.

&gt; &gt;&gt;That doesn't answer the question of whether you'd rather be rear-ended
&gt; &gt;&gt;by a scofflaw (who doesn't *care* about your safety) driving at 80 mph,
&gt; &gt;&gt;or be hit by a law-abiding citizen who makes a mistake driving at 40
&gt; &gt;&gt;mph...

&gt; &gt; It *does* answer the question, but perhaps not in simple enough
&gt; &gt; language for both your brain cells to comprehend. I spend a fair
&gt; &gt; amount of time examining my rear view mirrors, and am as aware of the
&gt; &gt; traffic behind me as I am to the traffic ahead and beside me. Your
&gt; &gt; inability to understand how rear view mirrors operate is just another
&gt; &gt; example of how easy it is for anyone to get a driver's license.

&gt; &gt;&gt;The scofflaws are everywhere now, believing that the lefthand lane is
&gt; &gt;&gt;some kind of lane reserved for speeders only, and they loudly claim
&gt; &gt;&gt;that the law-abiding driver occupying that lane is somehow rude or even
&gt; &gt;&gt;illegal...

&gt; &gt;&gt;Now you come along and say that I should watch my rear view mirrors and
&gt; &gt;&gt;be in the correct lane...

&gt; &gt; If you want to avoid being involved in an accident, sure. What does it
&gt; &gt; matter if the traffic approaching from your rear is doing 20mph or
&gt; &gt; 120mph, if you utilize your mirrors and act accordingly. It's saved me
&gt; &gt; from being rear ended or tail gated on countless occasions.

&gt; &gt;&gt;I have news for you. If I am in ANY lane on the freeway, driving at the
&gt; &gt;&gt;speed limit, I am in  the &quot;correct&quot; lane. There is NO &quot;fast lane&quot;
&gt; &gt;&gt;anywhere in California. We don't have the luxury of allowing the left
&gt; &gt;&gt;lane to be reserved for speeders only. We need ALL the lanes to move
&gt; &gt;&gt;rush hour traffic...

&gt; &gt; I'm not stating that the lane be reserved for speeders; I'm stating
&gt; &gt; that &quot;slower traffic keep right&quot; and &quot;keep right except to pass&quot; be
&gt; &gt; observed. Your errant belief that this applies for the convenience of
&gt; &gt; speeders isn't my fault. Failure to observe proper utilization of the
&gt; &gt; passing lane occurs on both sides of the speed limit.

&gt; &gt;&gt;All lanes on a highway have the same posted speed limits. Drivers are
&gt; &gt;&gt;not allowed to exceed the posted speed limits on any silly pretense
&gt; &gt;&gt;that the law-abiding driver ahead of them is somehow being &quot;rude&quot;...

&gt; &gt; Around here, we have signs that say &quot;slower traffic keep right&quot;, which
&gt; &gt; obviously is too complicated a concept for simpler minds to grasp.

&gt; &gt;&gt;The worst of the speeding scofflaws will find that they are unable to
&gt; &gt;&gt;pass a group of cars
&gt; &gt;&gt;following a law-abiding driver in the left lane. They find that they
&gt; &gt;&gt;can't pass the endless line of law-abiding in the #2 lane either, they
&gt; &gt;&gt;can't get around that one law-abiding driver whose behavior upsets
&gt; &gt;&gt;them. So they drive all the way over into the TRUCK LANES, where the
&gt; &gt;&gt;truckers are required to drive 55 mph and 300 feet apart...

&gt; &gt; The worst of the posting retards will errantly believe this is about
&gt; &gt; speeding, when it's not. Granted, with proper lane discipline and
&gt; &gt; driver training, speed limits could be set higher and everyone would
&gt; &gt; benefit as congestion would decrease. I personally don't want to be
&gt; &gt; trapped in some cluster of cars become some retard things that the
&gt; &gt; left lane is designed for traveling at the same speed as the traffic
&gt; &gt; in the right(ermost) lanes. One driver in that cluster screws up, or
&gt; &gt; an animal or person enters the road way, and you have a chain
&gt; &gt; reaction. Proper lane discipline will allow for the traffic to be less
&gt; &gt; clusters, providing everyone more maneuverability, which provides for
&gt; &gt; greater safety.

&gt; &gt;&gt;Then they cut between the trucks and maybe even use part of an extended
&gt; &gt;&gt;on-ramp to accelerate to 100 mph so they can move down the road half a
&gt; &gt;&gt;mile to find a place where they can jam their way back through the
&gt; &gt;&gt;law-abiding trucks, back through the line of law-abiding cars traffic
&gt; &gt;&gt;in the #2 lane, and maybe get into a quarter of a mile of empty space
&gt; &gt;&gt;between the law-abiding driver and the several cars who are tailgating
&gt; &gt;&gt;the next law-abiding driver.

&gt; &gt;&gt;They will do this same trick several times over the next ten or twenty
&gt; &gt;&gt;miles and they won't gain a minute over the car that was behind them
&gt; &gt;&gt;before they started swooping around all traffic, risking everybody's
&gt; &gt;&gt;lives to feed their own petty egos. They are sometimes driving at a
&gt; &gt;&gt;differential speed of 35 to 40 miles an hour over what the law abiding
&gt; &gt;&gt;drivers are trying to do...

&gt; &gt;&gt;These speeding scofflaws have almost everybody on the freeway
&gt; &gt;&gt;terrorized. That's why there's an endless line of law-abiding drivers
&gt; &gt;&gt;stacked up from horizon to horizon going across the San Fernando
&gt; &gt;&gt;valley. Many of them wish they could just drive in the left lane
&gt; &gt;&gt;without being hassled by the crazy people...

&gt; &gt; The crazy people are the ones who can't understand the very simple
&gt; &gt; terms &quot;keep right except to pass&quot; and &quot;slower traffic keep right&quot;.

In order to call me "son" you would have been born when Herbert Hoover
was president. And, I was discussing a scenario with Skip Bowman which
you are picking apart. CVC 21654 says you have to be passing other
vehicles are trying to turn left. You cannot turn LEFT on a freeway,
there's a concrete barrier between the lanes. You cannot turn left on a
freeway when the concrete wall ends, because it's illegal to turn
across a median strip. There has to be a plainly marked place to turn
left, and then there are signs that say END FREEWAY and CROSS TRAFFIC
AHEAD...

Now, I challenge you to reason this scenario out, if CVC 21654 means
what you think it means:

It's bright and early Saturday morning, and Siegfried Siegheil gets
into his Precious Porsche and heads for a Lane Discipline Nazi ralley
in a distant city. He knows it's a long way there, but he's got such an
early start, he's the only one on the freeway, and he sees that His
Very Own Left Lane is free of those wretched rolling roadblocks in
lesser automobiles, so he takes possession of What Is Rightfully His,
and he proceeds to drive at 95 mph, because he likes to drive at 95
mph, it just feels so go-o-o-od...

About 100 miles up the road, Siegfried Siegheil looks in his rear view
mirror and notices that he's being overtaken by Aryan Blondboy in his
Monster Mercedes. Aryan Blondboy flashes his lights and toots his horn
furiously, but Siegfried Siegheil doesn't budge an inch. He hunkers
down in his seat, resolving to hold onto His Very Own Left Lane...

But Aryan Blondboy believes that Siegfried Siegheil is occupying *his*
Unredeemed Lebensraum, and he *wants* it. He begins to pressure
Siegfried Siegheil, trying to get him to yield out of the "fast
lane"...

And, soon, the pair is joined by Dieter Bavarianmotorwerke in his V-12
sports car. Dieter is pissed by the pair of "Left Lane Blockers" and he
wants to claim *his* rights, so he flashes his lights, blows his horn,
and finally leaves his left turn signal on, just like everybody on the
Autobahn does, back in The Reich...

Unbeknownst to any of the trio, all this has attracted the attention of
the
Expressionless Officer With The Silvered Sunglasses, who pulls the
three speeders over. Dieter feels that he's done no wrong, that he was
driving with the "flow" of traffic on a deserted freeway. He tells
Silvered Sunglasses that "dose guys should have yielded to me, I vas
vanting to drife faster!"

Aryan Blondboy claims that Siegfried Siegheil should have yielded to
him, after all, "I vlashed my lights und blowed mein horn, but dot
prick chust vouldn't moof over and let me go by!"

Dieter and Aryan stand there with their arms folded triumphantly,
vaiting, err, I mean "waiting", yeah that's it---*waiting* for the
Expressionless Officer With The Silvered Sunglasses to write Siegfried
Siegheil a citation for violation of CVC 21654(a) and give him a stern
lecture about failure to yield to faster traffic or turn left...

Instead, Siegfried, Dieter, and Aryan are all issued speeding citations
and must sign their citations, promising to appear in traffic court...

My question to you, is why didn't the Expressionless Officer With The
Silvered Sunglasses jump into Siegfried's shit about failure to yield
to the "normal flow of traffic", seeing as how the freeway was deserted
and
Lane Discipline Nazis drive for hours in that lane *every* Saturday
morning, regardless of whether they are on their way to a Lane
Discipline Nazi Ralley or not? Why didn't Silvered Sunglasses jack
Siegfried Siegheil up for not turning left?

No, you did NOT prove me wrong. I am not trying to sell any geese,
either. Prove your point about "normal traffic speed" with a cite in
California case law, not just a claim pulled out of your ass.

"Prima Facie" is undefined in the CVC. There are CVC sections that say
a motorist citing for violating the prima facie limits has to prove
that the circumstances he was driving under weren't unsafe to prove
that his speed was lawful. But it's still gonna cost him at least $300
to $400 to win his case, and he's gonna have to post the full bail
amount just to get his trial...

Cities in California need all the lanes of all the streets to move
traffic. A left lane *cannot* be reserved for speeding scofflaws.

If CVC 21645(a) is a left lane clearing law, then why do you think
California legislators even bothered to write this section, with the
language it uses?

22400 Minimum Speed Law
(a) No person shall drive upon a highway at such a slow speed as to
impede or block the normal and REASONABLE movement of traffic, unless
the reduced speed is *necessary for safe operation*, because of a

Why on Earth do you think they said anything about *in compliance with
the law* if prima facie speed limits don't mean anything?

&gt; lefthand lane of a California freeway were, if followed by five cars
&gt; and other cars were passing him on the right, even though he was
&gt; obeying the maximum speed limit...

&gt; Do you even have a FREEWAY around Lubbock which has four lanes in
&gt; either direction, divided by a concrete barrier topped by a fence with
&gt; aggressive
&gt; pickup truck drivers trying to get onto the freeway faster than traffic
&gt; on the freeway is going, so they can push and shove their way over to
&gt; the left lane and begin crowding the drivers already there?

&gt; Last time I was in Lubbock, there was nothing but a four lane divided
&gt; highway with 2 lanes in either direction and tumbleweed in the
&gt; middle...

&gt; If you don't have such a multi-lane divided freeway, and you haven't
&gt; driven in Los Angeles in rush hour traffic, you wouldn't know that the
&gt; righthand lane may be the most dangerous lane of all...

&gt; In the right hand lane, you can get hit from all sides. In the left
&gt; lane, it's not so bad. Most California riders use the lefthand lane so
&gt; they will be set up to &quot;lane share&quot; or &quot;split lanes&quot; when the cages
&gt; slow down...

&gt; You talk about &quot;defensive driving and management of your space on the
&gt; road&quot; as if that is even possible. When riding a motorcycle on
&gt; California freeways in the lefthand lane (which is not a &quot;fast lane&quot; or
&gt; a &quot;passing lane&quot;) I can split lanes at high speed and get into a clear
&gt; space. But it won't *stay* clear for more than a few seconds before
&gt; cars from the crowded
&gt; #2 lane start filling up the open space, in the belief that they will
&gt; finally be able speed all the way to their destination.

&gt; So, very quickly my cushion space is gone, I'm following a car
&gt; following a car following a car, and so on, clear to the horizon, and a

&gt; that as an invitation to PASS me in the same lane, as if lane-sharing

&gt; passing cars while pretending he's just &quot;lane-sharing&quot;...

I just moved up here a couple of months ago. Drove Houston for about 15
years previously. So I hear ya. True there are times when you have no
choice but to ride in the box. Houston can get tight as well as having a
healthy share of aggressive and daring drivers. While always searching
for the safer spot to ride, I am also expecting someone to screw up and
do what they shouldn't. I try to expect the best but stay prepared for
the worst. And if I start getting too paranoid, I just take it home and
drink a half pint of Canadian ;)

Handbook caters to the urban myth that the left lane is the "fast lane"
buy using such language so less-intelligent drivers can understand what

http://www.dmv.ca.gov/pubs/hdbk/pgs19thru22.htm#speedlimits

SPEED LIMITS
California has a "Basic Speed Law." This law means you may never
drive faster than is safe for current conditions. For example, if you
are driving 45 mph in a 55 mph speed zone during a dense fog, you could
be cited for driving "too fast for conditions." You may never
legally drive faster than the posted speed limit, even if you think it
is safe to do so.

Maximum Speed Limit

The maximum speed limit on most California highways is 65 mph. You may
drive 70 mph where posted. Unless otherwise posted, the maximum speed
limit is 55 mph on two-lane undivided highways and for vehicles towing
trailers.
Other speed limit signs are posted for the type of roads and traffic in
each area. All speed limits are based on ideal driving conditions.
Construction zones usually have reduced speed zones.

Driving faster than the posted speed limit, or than is safe for current
conditions, on any road is dangerous and illegal. High speed increases
your stopping distance. The faster you go, the less time you have to
avoid a hazard or accident. The force of a 60 mph crash isn't just
twice as great as a 30 mph crash, it's four times as great!

REDUCED SPEEDS

Heavy traffic or bad weather

You must drive slower when there is heavy traffic or bad weather.
However, if you block the normal and reasonable movement of traffic by
driving too slowly, you may be given a ticket. If you choose to drive
slower than other traffic, do not drive in the "No. 1" (fast) lane.
Always move to the right when another driver is close behind you and
wishes to drive faster.

Towing Vehicles, Buses, or Large Trucks

When you tow a vehicle or trailer, or drive a bus or three- or more
axle truck, you must drive in the right-hand lane or in a lane
specially marked for slower vehicles. If no lanes are marked and there
are four lanes or more in your direction, you may only drive in either
of the two lanes closest to the right edge of the road.

Around children:

Within 500 feet of a school while children are outside or crossing the
street, the speed limit is 25 mph, unless otherwise posted. Also, if
the school ground has no fence and children are outside, never drive
faster than 25 mph. Always drive more carefully near schools,
playgrounds, parks, and residential areas because children may suddenly
dart into the street.

Near schools, look for:

Bicyclists and pedestrians.

School safety patrols or school crossing guards and obey their
directions. For the crossing guard's safety, allow him or her to
safely get to the side of the road before driving ahead.

Watch for bicyclists and pedestrians near schools.

Stopped school buses and children crossing the street. Some school
buses flash yellow lights when preparing to stop and let children off
the bus. The yellow flashing lights warn you to stop. When the bus
flashes red lights (located at the top front and back of the bus), you
must stop from either direction until the children are safely across
the street and the lights stop flashing. The law requires you to remain
stopped as long as the red lights are flashing (VC §22454). If you
fail to stop, you may be fined up to $1000 and your driving privilege
could be suspended for one year. If the school bus is on the other side
of a divided or multilane (two or more lanes in each direction)
highway, you do not need to stop.

Blind intersections
The speed limit for a blind intersection is 15 mph. An intersection is
considered "blind" if you cannot see for 100 feet in either
direction during the last 100 feet before crossing. Trees, bushes,
buildings, or parked cars at intersections can block your view to the
side. If your view is blocked, edge forward slowly until you can see.

Alleys
The speed limit in any alley is 15 mph.

Near railroad tracks:
The speed limit is 15 mph when you come within 100 feet of a railroad
crossing and you cannot see the tracks for 400 feet in both directions.
You may go faster than 15 mph if the crossing is controlled by gates, a
warning signal, or a flagman.

At railroad or train crossings:
Look in both directions and listen for trains. Many crossings have
multiple tracks so be ready to stop before crossing, if necessary.
Cross railroad tracks only at designated
crossings and only when it is safe to do so.

Expect a train on any track at any time traveling in either direction.
If you need to stop after crossing the tracks, make sure your vehicle
clears the tracks before you stop.

Never stop on the railroad tracks. Remember that a train cannot stop
quickly or swerve out of the way. If you are on the tracks, you risk
injury or death.

Watch for vehicles that must stop before crossing train tracks. These
vehicles include buses, school buses, and trucks transporting hazardous
loads. Remember that flashing red lights mean STOP! Stop at least 15
feet from the nearest track when the crossing devices are active or a
person warns you a train is coming. Stop if you see a train coming or
you hear the whistle, horn, or bell of an approaching train.

Do not go around or under lowered crossing gates, even if you do not
see a train. Wait for the gates to rise. If the gates are not working
correctly, call the railroad emergency number posted near the crossing
or notify the local police or California Highway Patrol.

Near light rail vehicle crossings
The same rules apply to light rail vehicle crossings as to train
crossings. Do not proceed across the tracks until you can see clearly
in both directions and are sure that no other light rail vehicle or
train is coming. Do not go around or under any closed gate. NOTE: Light
rail vehicles are very quiet and move more quickly than freight trains.

Near streetcars, trolleys, or buses
The passing speed limit, if it is safe to pass, is no more than 10 mph
at a safety zone or an intersection where a streetcar, trolley, or bus
is stopped and traffic is controlled by a police officer or traffic
signal. A safety zone is marked by raised buttons or markers on the
road and is set aside for pedestrians. You will most often see safety
zones in areas where street cars or trolleys and vehicles share the
roadway.

Business or residence districts
The speed limit is 25 mph, unless otherwise posted.

Near animals
If you see animals or livestock, slow down and obey the person in
charge of the animals. If you see a stray animal in your path, slow
down or stop, if safe to do so.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------
http://www.dmv.ca.gov/pubs/hdbk/pgs55thru57.htm

SLOW MOVING VEHICLES
Some vehicles are not designed to keep up with the speed of traffic.
Look for these vehicles and adjust your speed before you reach them.
Farm tractors, animal-drawn carts, and road maintenance vehicles
usually travel 25 mph or less. Slow moving vehicles have an orange
triangle on the back.

Also, be aware that large trucks and small, under powered cars lose
speed on long or steep hills and they take longer to get up to speed
when entering traffic.

Certain other types of slow moving motorized vehicles (such as
wheelchairs, scooters and golf carts) may legally operate on public
roads. Adjust your speed accordingly.

ANIMAL DRAWN VEHICLES
Horse drawn vehicles and riders of horses or other animals are entitled
to share the road with you. It is a traffic offense to scare horses or
stampede livestock. Slow down or stop, if necessary, and when requested
to do so by the riders or herders.

highway? If you could please outline the relevant portion in the
statute I helpfully pasted for you below, that would be most helpful
(but you won't find it):

21651.   (a) Whenever a highway has been divided into two or more
roadways by means of intermittent barriers or by means of a dividing
section of not less than two feet in width, either unpaved or
delineated by curbs, double-parallel lines, or other markings on the
roadway, it is unlawful to do either of the following:
(1) To drive any vehicle over, upon, or across the dividing
section.
(2) To make any left, semicircular, or U-turn with the vehicle on
the divided highway, except through an opening in the barrier
designated and intended by public authorities for the use of vehicles
or through a plainly marked opening in the dividing section.
(b) It is unlawful to drive any vehicle upon a highway,
except to the right of an intermittent barrier or a dividing section
which separates two or more opposing lanes of traffic. Except as
otherwise provided in subdivision (c), a violation of this subdivision
is a misdemeanor.
(c) Any willful violation of subdivision (b) which results in
injury to, or death of, a person shall be punished by imprisonment in
the state prison, or imprisonment in a county jail for a period of not
more than six months.

The above doesn't support anything you said.

Wrong still. Repeated assertions are not proof. The plain language of
the statute (that troublesome little "shall" thing you keep
ignoring) says you are wrong. Again, to rub your nose in it once more,
the actual law:

"Notwithstanding the prima facie speed limits, any vehicle proceeding
upon a highway at a speed less than the normal speed of traffic moving
in the same direction at such time ****shall****  be driven in the
right-hand lane for traffic or as close as practicable to the
right-hand edge or curb, except when overtaking and passing another
vehicle proceeding in the same direction or when preparing for a left
turn at an intersection or into a private road or driveway."

Note word "shall." That requires them to yield, contrary to your
mistaken belief, unless they are passing or turning left.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; you might incite some defensive postures if you ignorantly

I don't "aggress." Your law allows that, in fact it includes a
specific provision requiring people to yield when a faster driver
behind them flashes its lights or blows its horn. We don't have that
in CO. Therefore, what you presume to be the case here is not and is
actually the case in CA.

The CO statute isn't the same as CA. In CO, KRETP is only effective
on multi-lane highways where the posted speed limit is 65 mph or
greater. That leaves out urban freeways, which are mostly 55 and too
congested for KRETP to be easily obeyed.

Are you insane or only pretending to be? You're making this up. Go

is a freeway not a highway? Go ahead and try:

21654.   (a) Notwithstanding the prima facie speed limits, any vehicle

the right-hand lane for traffic or as close as practicable to the

Only your drug-addled imagination reads there that it doesn't apply
to freeways. Let me help you sober up. This is from the CVC definitions
section:

360.    "Highway" is a way or place of whatever nature, publicly
maintained and open to the use of the public for purposes of vehicular
travel. Highway includes street.

332.    "Freeway" is a highway in respect to which the owners of
abutting lands have no right or easement of access to or from their
abutting lands or in respect to which such owners have only limited or
restricted right or easement of access.

Repeat after me, clown: "A freeway is a highway, a freeway is a
highway, a freeway is a highway, a freeway is a highway..."

That doesn't mean it isn't illegal. Law-abiding drivers *will*

You're off the deep end. That has no application to the left-lane
clearing law that CA has on the books. 22400 appears to require minimum
speeds that don't block other traffic unless it is necessary for
safety to go slower or to comply with the law. If you feel you need to
comply with the speed limit, then please do so.

But *do it from the right lane, not the left,* if you are going *slower
than the rest of the traffic,* or else you are a violator of the law.

Clear yet, bozo?

I'm NOT wrong. I'm trying to interpret for you what the CVC *means*.
Sometimes the Drivers Handbook even has to stoop to the mental level of
the
semi-literate driver and use the urban myth concept of the "fast" lane
when referring to the #1 lane, since they concept of how lanes are
numbered is very hard for stupid people to understand...(1)

And, you, et al, have repeatedly mistakenly thrown out CVC 21654(a) as
a left lane clearing ordinance that forces law-abiding drivers to yield
to the right for
speeding scofflaws on some notion that they may ignore CVC 21650 (the
Basic Speed Law) with impunity...

Furthermore, you have still failed to explain this section, and why the
legislators would think they needed it, if CVC 21654(a) accomplishes
the left lane clearing so dear to your heart...

CVC 22400 Minimum Speed Law
(a) No person shall drive upon a highway at such a slow speed as to
impede or block the normal and REASONABLE movement of traffic, unless
the reduced speed is *necessary for safe operation*, because of a
grade, or *in compliance with law*.
No person shall bring a vehicle to a complete stop upon a highway so as
to IMPEDE OR BLOCK THE NORMAL AND REASONABLE MOVEMENT of traffic unless
the stop *is necessary for safe operation* or *in compliance with law*.

(b) Whenever the Department of Transportation determines on the basis
of an engineering and traffic survey that slow speeds on any part of a
state highway consistently impede the normal and reasonable movement of
traffic, the department may determine and declare a minimum speed limit
below which no person shall drive a vehicle, except when necessary for
safe operation or in compliance with law, when appropriate signs giving
notice thereof are erected along the part of the highway for which a
minimum speed limit is established.
Subdivision (b) of this section shall apply only to vehicles subject to
registration.

Why did the legislature choose the language "normal and REASONABLE",
anyway?
Isn't it "normal and reasonable" for a driver to want to put the pedal
to the metal anytime he sees 5 car lengths of empty space ahead of him?
Isn't it "normal and reasonable" for a driver to try to intimidate the
driver of the car ahead so he can get where he's going 2 or 3 seconds
sooner?

If you don't answer this with some thought, I will keep posting CVC
22400 until I do get an answer...

(1)Multi-lane highways did not just "grow" like mushrooms, sprouting up
overnight in empty pastures. First there was a single track trail, then
4-wheeled wagons followed it and heavier automobiles and soon the road
had to be paved and widened, since neither automobile driver would care
to risk getting stuck by pulling off for the other. As soon as lines
were painted, the #1 lane in either direction was born. When traffic
increased, a second, and third lane was added. These were called #2,
#3, et cetera...

But there was need for uniformity around 70 or 80 years ago, for some
order as to which side passing should occur on. It was decided that
passing should
take place toward the center of the 2-lane road, or that the #1 lane
should be used for passing. So far as I know, California never had a
"Keep Right Except To Pass" law, but the idea of the vehicle being
passed not speeding up and staying to the right, plus the fact that
passing traffic would of necessity have to be going faster than other
traffic led to the myth that the #1 lane is a "fast lane" or a "passing
lane". That just isn't true on multilane California highways where
passing on the right is permitted...

There are literally *millions* of licensed (and unlicensed) drivers on
California highways with no better understanding of the law than to

speed limit in the #1 lane...

If you are such a  brilliant legal theorist, why don't you take a stab
at explaining why the legislature would need to add CVC 22400 to the
Code, if
CVC 21654(A) does what you claim it does, i.e., require any vehicle
"proceeding upon a highway at a speed less than the normal speed of
traffic moving in the same direction at such time" to either ignore the
Basic Speed Law of CVC 21650, and run with the pack of jackasses, or
yield to the right...

22400 Minimum Speed Law
(a) No person shall drive upon a highway at such a slow speed as to
impede or block the normal and REASONABLE movement of traffic, unless
the reduced speed is *necessary for safe operation*, because of a
grade, or *in compliance with law*.
No person shall bring a vehicle to a complete stop upon a highway so as

What's "normal and reasonable"? Driving at or near the speed limit,
driving 10 to 15 over the limit, driving 15 to 20 over the limit? Or is
it "normal and reasonable" to throw all speed limits to the wind and
just "go for it, dude!"?

It is in chapter one. Most interpretations say that severability applies to

"If you choose to drive slower than other traffic, do not drive in the

Dipshit, read the other reply. Dealt with already. 22400 is for
slow-moving vehicles not to impede traffic. 21654 is for vehicles going

You have a problem with speeders, I get it. I have a problem with
speeders too. But normal, as I clearly showed you before, is the
predominant speed of traffic **notwithstanding** what the speed limit
might be. Reasonable is driving safely within that normal flow. For you
to ignore your clear legal obligation to get out of the left lane if
you are not passing, whether you are going the speed limit, under it or
over it, is unquestionably a violation of the law. It is clearly not
"reasonable" driving for you to park yourself at 55 or 65 in the
left lane if the normal flow of traffic around you is 70, even if 70 is
in excess of the limit.

Just move right after passing. Or do you think it's OK for you to
break one law if others are breaking another law?

Oh, now you're entering the realm of paranoia. I suppose your little

you're riding a motorcycle and you think that I have to "share" the

"lane sharing business" is a rude and arrogant form of *passing slower
vehicles on the right*. And you probably think that if a automobile
driver moves over to discourage you that he's doing something heinous.
He's not. He has the right to the full use of the lane from lane marker
to lane marker...

And then there's your little fantasy of reporting me as a "road rager".
That really gets you off, doesn't it? The idea that you can approach a
law enforcement officer and report some incident with another driver
that you were *fucking with* and the cop will happily drop his donut
and scratcher and run off down the road in pursuit of your victim...

I have news for you, Skipper. The cop isn't going to do anything. He'll
be polite at first and he'll tell you that he cannot make an arrest if
he doesn't see the offense take place. If you insist, he will be ever
more polite in discouraging you and sending you on your way. If you
keep insisting and insisting and insisting and frothing at the mouth
and jumping up and down and waving your arms as you stutter,
"B-b-b-but, Officer! He was trying to *kill* me!" the cop may warn you
that you are interfering with an officer in the performance of his
duty, which at the time may be to finish his jelly donut and coffee and
see if he won the Lotto. If you keep behaving in such an irrational
manner, he will handcuff you and place you in the back of his patrol
car while he runs your license for wants and warrants. If you're clean,
and you want to give up the claim that you've been assaulted, he might
let you go. But, if you keep behaving in a bizarre manner, he can take
you down to the jail, where they will move you into the psychiatric
ward and hold you for 48 to 72 for psychiatric examination, before you
are hauled before the judge to determine how
to dispose of the matter, whether to commit you for 90 days more, or to

Ah, yes. Hook baited and set. Now you're deep into looking up vehicle
code sections of a state you don't even live in. Again.

But, check it out, dude!

How could a cop write up a driver proceeding at the speed limit in the
left lane of a freeway with a center concrete barrier if he has no
place he can legally turn left at, and he's being followed by a long
line of cars and every one of those cars would like to pass the driver
ahead of him so he can drive what he considers to be a "normal speed",
e.g. 15 or 20 mph above the limit, and the lane directly to the right

The language of CVC 22400 does NOT require the driver to *move over to

legislature's desire to solve the problem of the REAL lane blocker (or
the
motorist who is simply tired of being tailgated mercilessly) who will
jam on his brakes to get the asshole off his tail. This all started
*before* the 55mph national speed limit. But it got worse when the
scofflaws said, "Hell, NO, we won't drive 55!" and started trying to
harrass law-abiding drivers out of the left lane by tailgating them...

CVC 22400 solves the problem of a real "slowpoke" doing 55 in a 65 or
70 mph zone on a perfectly clear day. He can be ticketed for driving
too slow, and there's NO question that he's driving too slow, but the
same driver could defend against a citation of violation of CVC
24651(a) by pointing out that, even though he was only doing 55mph, he
was in the act of passing all the big trucks lined up in the two lanes
to the right that were only doing 50 mph, when suddenly the speeder
came up behind him at 75 mph...

You seem to have decent luck with their trucks - maybe they're better

out of a fuel pump.  Seat heaters still work great, 15 years along.
Windows still operate properly - original motors and regulators.
Sunroof, power seats, AC...

Maybe I got lucky.  Maybe I got the only good ones.  Seems unlikely.
But I really like the perception that German cars are unreliable.

He couldn't. The conditions you cite indicate near-complete

he's lucky. If people are passing him on the right, however, he's

understand this: If, as you say, all the drivers in all the lanes are
moving at the speed limit, then that prima facie is the "normal speed
of traffic moving in the same direction at such time" which the law
spells out. As long as your left lane fellow is keeping that pace,

simply must merge right when you safely can. That simple enough for
you? "Shall" means you gots to! If it's rush hour bumper to

Sorry, Scott. His use of "Fat Jew Boy" is an immediate disqualifier.

Uh, now you've completely lost your mind.

The normal speed of traffic is what it is regardless of any speed limit
or condition on the road. The normal speed of traffic at any given time
is simply the speed at which the traffic happens to be moving then.
Speed limit has zippo to do with it.

And the normal speed of traffic usually *is* higher than the speed
limit on highways I've seen, in CA, in the LA basin and all around
the country. So even if you're going the speed limit, 21654 obligates
you to move right if the others are going faster.

It's black and white, sport. At some point, you gotta stop beating
your head against your own brick wall here and just obey the law like
you want everyone else to do.

about the hundredth time I've copied this law for you. Read it before
making more of a fool of yourself):

21654.  (a) **Notwithstanding the prima facie speed limits,** any
vehicle proceeding upon a highway at a speed **less than the normal
speed of traffic** moving in the same direction at such time **shall**
be driven in the right-hand lane for traffic or as close as practicable
to the right-hand edge or curb, except when overtaking and passing
another vehicle proceeding in the same direction or when preparing for
a left turn at an intersection or into a private road or driveway.
(b) If a vehicle is being driven at a speed **less than the normal
speed of traffic** moving in the same direction at such time, and is
not being driven in the right-hand lane for traffic or as close as
practicable to the right-hand edge or curb, it shall constitute **prima
facie evidence that the driver is operating the vehicle in violation**
of subdivision (a) of this section.

I especially like (b) since it makes even more clear that is you are
violating the law in the way I've said simply if you are going slower
than other traffic and you are not in the right lane.

This is endgame, dude. Your corpse is smelling here. Time to stop.

This is Scott.  He tried to argue that the language "this article" in
a statute meant "the entire chapter", even when presented with evidence
otherwise.  Took a Lexis/Nexis lookup to make him give up.  Don't

Basically, Atwell was a passenger who was injured in a vehicle collision
resulting from Watson pulling out in front of the vehicle Atwell was
riding in (Watson was taking a left turn from a side street).

Several witnesses stated that Goodwin (the driver of the car Atwell was
riding in) was travelling at an "excessive" speed though both Atwell and
Goodwin stated that they were proceeding at a "normal" speed.  The lower
court ruling was in favor of Watson.  The Virginia Supreme Court
overturned the ruling because the section of code that applied to the
right-of-way situation in this case did not have the "speeder loses the
right of way" clause.

So how about linking to an official copy of this court decision, so we
can see if that is in context with and is applicable to anything in this
thread.

If the decision happened 42 years ago, it really wouldn't be applicable
to a current interpretation of the code, in any event, since the code
changes over time.

Like I said in what you quoted above, you need a judicial interpretation
of this issue.  As many items as there are in the code, the judicial
opinion would undoubtedly draw from a number of items.  The judicial
opinion wouldn't cherry-pick the code to arrive at a preconceived
notion, unlike the LDN/DIG driver posters.

well... since the quote Arif provided matches up word for word with the
section of code under discussion (§ 46.2-823) with the exception that
"hereunder" has been replaced by "under this article" (likely a
clarification as a result of the aforementioned decision) and inputting
that text (minus the "hereunder") into the handy search feature provided
here:

http://leg1.state.va.us/000/src.htm

results in one and only one hit (§ 46.2-823) I think it's a fair bet

Gee I wish I didn't know what that was like. There is a better write line in

It does mention people obeying the law in the left lane.

&gt; Basically, Atwell was a passenger who was injured in a vehicle collision
&gt; resulting from Watson pulling out in front of the vehicle Atwell was
&gt; riding in (Watson was taking a left turn from a side street).

&gt; Several witnesses stated that Goodwin (the driver of the car Atwell was
&gt; riding in) was travelling at an &quot;excessive&quot; speed though both Atwell and
&gt; Goodwin stated that they were proceeding at a &quot;normal&quot; speed.  The lower
&gt; court ruling was in favor of Watson.  The Virginia Supreme Court
&gt; overturned the ruling because the section of code that applied to the
&gt; right-of-way situation in this case did not have the &quot;speeder loses the
&gt; right of way&quot; clause.

Why did they say normal speed?

It's all my fault man! I quoted the wrong law. (Article) The one thatreally

&gt; You, on the other hand, appear to be attempting to claim the law

&gt; Article 4 starts at 46.2-837.  Therefore, 46.2-842 and 46.2-823 cannot

It is very easy to determine. It is against the law to go faster than the
speed limit. No law says someone obeying the law, has to move for someone
disobeying it. Tailgating is illegal, as is deliberately hitting someone.
Attempting to intimidate other drivers  by swerving around them very closely
is not allowed either.
The truly scary thing is; some people (who already drive cars) have to
be told this.

Give it up guys.  It's a cultural issue akin to argueing Christianity versus
Islam.  Gardenman, like most LEOs, has the authoritarian attitude that the
Law comes first and must be obeyed, and they believe this with a religious
devotion, as deeply as devout Christians believe in God.  So did 'good
Germans' in Hitlers day, which allowed them to rationalize the murder of
1000s of people the law deemed unworthy. Funny thing is that worship of law
for its own sake also held Judaism together for millenia. Thank the VMAT
gene.

Today this allows LEOs to justify the incarceration of people who have
harmed no-one even if that means letting sociopaths loose on society to make
room for, say, some grandma with a marijuana plant. After all she broke THE
LAW (trumpets on high, angels singing). It is unrealistic to expect anyone
who thinks this way to bust some slowpoke to make way for a 'speeder' no
matter how sensible it is to sane persons. Easier to teach pigs to sing.

Radical Muslims hold the same ideas. That's why they hate democracy. "How
can man presume to make his own rules?" they ask, "the law comes from God!"

Intellegent, educated peoples know law is not sacred, but just a social
tool, invented by man, to be changed at will and ignored when necessary.
Thankfully our founding fathers understood that fact.  If Henry, Madison,
Monroe, Adams, Washington, Jefferson, Franklin and 1000s of other patriots
who paid dearly for our freedom had had Gardenman's unamerican love of law
we would be living in a 3rd rate colony singing 'God save the Queen, and the
USA would never have existed.  Thus the belief that law is sacred smacks of
treason to real patriots.

There is no way to bridge this gap between religious fervor and logical
patriotic thought.  You may as well try to convince the Pope that Jesus got
away.  That is why we will always have lane hogs.

Ah, there's a concept: BREAK THE LAW BECAUSE SOMEONE ELSE IS... Hey,

"moving roadblocks" by non-law enforcement people is against the law

The message to which I replied with the request "kindly cease using my

his screen name to reflect my email address. If you search on his

I drive a Hummer H1. I take many long distance trips. I drive at 59 to
60 MPH. I always use the right lane. I never have problems, except for
those idiots who get to the end of a merge ramp and then hit the
brakes. I yell (they can't hear)

"You can't merge with your brakes on!"

I'll slow tolet a car in that is trying to accelerate even if they are
not doing well. But that person with the brakes on, what do you do?
You can not slow down, or they will eventually stop! You go by them,
and they think "good thing I hit the brakes, he'd have run over me."

I'm going ot print some bumper stickers that say:

"you can't merge with your brakes on". &lt;bg&gt;

Yes, if you can't keep up with the fast(er) traffic, right lane is the
choice. Period, anything else is more dangerous.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; not, why was the word &quot;chapter&quot; or &quot;section&quot; not used instead of

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Depending on interpretation, it could mean that the whole &quot;loss of

&gt; &gt;&gt;Sounds to me like you and Arif are trying hard to find a way to claim
&gt; &gt;&gt;that this law doesn't apply to you.  I'm not surprised.

&gt; &gt; You say that as if it's inherently a bad thing.  If the law, indeed,
&gt; &gt; doesn't apply to them, there's nothing wrong with trying to find a way
&gt; &gt; to make that claim.

&gt; &gt; You, on the other hand, appear to be attempting to claim the law
&gt; &gt; applies despite all evidence to the contrary.

&gt; &gt; Article 4 starts at 46.2-837.  Therefore, 46.2-842 and 46.2-823 cannot
&gt; &gt; be in the same article.  Therefore, 46.2-823 cannot be applied to
&gt; &gt; 46-2.842.

&gt; 842? How does that apply to this discussion? Except to prove that you are
&gt; allowed to drive in the left lane.

&gt; &gt; Other evidence in the code suggests that the article referred to in
&gt; &gt; 46.2-823 comprises 46.2-820 through 46.2-823.  But without paying
&gt; &gt; money to a code publisher, or spending time in the law library, that's
&gt; &gt; probably not possible to determine.

&gt; It is very easy to determine. It is against the law to go faster than the
&gt; speed limit. No law says someone obeying the law, has to move for someone

No I wouldn't. My point was and still is. I live inVirginia. We do not have
a "passing lane" in Virginia. If you are traveling at the maximum allowable
speed in the left most lane of an interstate (in Virginia) you are not
required to change lanes, because the person behind you wants to break the
law and go faster than the speed limit. This applies to any divided highway
where passing on the right is allowed. There are some exceptions (locally)
and localities are given the ability to designate some lanes for slower
travel.

Missing front

Surely because it's illegal to drive a vehicle with improper lighting
or improperly displayed tags, I should be justified in blocking him.

Points well taken on both sides, but wasted IMO. The problem is vigilante
action, not minor traffic statute violations. Rather than enhancing safety,
intentional lane blocking creates dangerous situations. It is, in fact,
intentional and reckless endangerment. There seems hardly any point in
discussing it, however. Both sides are permanently polarized in their own
righteousness. The move to ticket lane blockers simply places both sides on
equal notice. Rather than stipulating right or wrong, the message is simple:
SHARE THE ROAD. It's harder to work yourself into a froth over unequal

Obviously speed limits are not the only traffic laws, but please tell
me if there is any traffic law more important than controlling the
velocity of your vehicle when it's aimed at innocent motorists!

California has some of the most crowded highways in the nation, we
can't afford the luxury of reserving one of only two CAR/MOTORCYCLE
lanes on the freeways for speeding scofflaws.

The other two lanes on the freeway are TRUCK/BUS/TRAILER lanes and the
trucks etc. are required to drive at 55 mph and keep 300 feet behind
the truck etc. ahead of them. This gives the truck etc. drivers the
ability to stop in an emergency and it gives cars room to enter and
exit the two CAR lanes safely.

Urban myth in California claims that the lefthand lane is some kind of
"fast lane" or "passing lane", even though there is NO mention whatever
of any "fast lane" in the California Vehicle Code. To my knowldege,
there are NO "passing lanes" anywhere in California, either.

But, drivers who enjoy speeding continue to behave as though the
so-called "fast lane" actually existed, and continue to believe that
they are somehow supposed to only pass other cars on the left when they
are on multi-lane highways where SAFE passing on the right or left is
equally legal...

Law-abiding drivers do not like to be assaulted from the rear by
speeding scofflaws, so most of them will line up in the second lane
from the left. This creates an endless line of cars moving from horizon
to horizon across the valleys. This line cannot be LAWFULLY penetrated
by cars wishing to move to and from the left lane. A driver in the 2nd
lane has to be FORCED to let cars through, or the maneuvering driver
needs to use hand signals and almost BEG his way through the line of
cars in the 2nd lane...

Suppose a true NUT CASE (and California has plenty of nut cases)
decides that the scofflaws proceeding at 75 miles per hour in the left
hand lane are just going too slow for his taste. After all, this nut
case has driven in the "fast lane" at 100 mph while racing other cars
on the freeway at midnight, and nothing happened, so he figures it's
safe. This nut case is very likely to be frustrated by the the
scofflaws driving 75 in the "fast lane", and be even more frustrated
with the "slow pokes" doing 65 in the second lane, and he will try to
pass ALL THE TRAFFIC ON THE FREEWAY, just to get to some open space
ahead of the pack of scofflaws he's following!

So, Mr. Nut Case will accelerate to over 100 mph, and cut through the
second lane, through the truck lanes, and run in the so-called "slow
lane" at 100 mph, endangering everybody on the road so he can cut back
through all lanes of traffic and get into some small empty space a few
hundred yards ahead of the position he was originally in. But he will
still be going 100 mph, and the scofflaws only doing 75 mph will be
slowing him down, so he will do the same screwball maneuver again and
again and again...

Fortunately, there are drivers on California freeways who do believe in
the maximum speed limits and do not believe that a bunch of drivers can
independantly decide that they don't want to be restricted to the speed
limits, so the law-abiding drivers do manage to keep the freeways under
control even while the California Highway Patrol ossifers are busy
eating donuts at Winchell's...

If you drive California freeways during rush hour, you will hardly ever
see a CHP stuck in all that traffic. They will be out on wide open
stretches of highway, catching scofflaw speeders where they most enjoy
speeding...

And the scofflaw speeder can go into court and rant and rave and make
all kinds of irrational claims that he was "only" driving at the normal
speed for that situation, that "everybody" drives 90 mph in that lane
every day, and that he's been driving 90 mph to and from work every day
and that he was never stopped before, so why suddenly stop him for what
seems to have always been "OK"...

And the judge will politely smile and explain that the speeding
scofflaw had previously been lucky, but that his luck had just run out
as he awards the scofflaw a "performance award" of a $350 fine plus a
$700 penalty assessment...

Do you even realize how STUPID you sound? "Right of way" is about who
has the *privilege* of using a particular piece of highway FIRST. If
you
overtake somebody driving at the maximum speed limit, there's NO
QUESTION about who has the PRIVILEGE of using the particular piece of
highway. The driver in front is ALREADY using that piece of highway.
It's HIS privilege, he got there FIRST, he has TAKEN the right of way,
and continues to lawfully exercise it as long as he drives at or near
the speed limit.

Any action you might take to insist upon your presumed "privilege"
under some vehicle code section you've committed to memory is nothing
but reckless endangerment of the other driver and is the act of a
self-appointed vigilante.

If you want to continue to speed and act like an asshole on the
highway, be prepared to pay the court clerk for your infractions,
misdemeanors and felonies. If you're going be be arrogant and play
vigilante on the nation's highways, you're going to get caught and
brought before a judge.

He will not be amused by your efforts to instruct him as to the meaning
of the right of way law or the speed limit.

Mr Hipson

You focus on a peripheral issues while ignoring the central plank of
the rant. Common courtesy is exceedingly rare on roads nowadays
(unless it is courtesy accorded by one crimminal speeder to another,
If I may add).

My driving habits are as follows:

- NEVER exceed speed limit. be it 15, 25, 30, 55 or 75. If speed limit
is 15 and in a down slope my car is exceeding 15, I brake.
- ALWAYS come to a full stop at all stop signs, even if there are no
other cars around
- A blinking red is a stop sign. see above.
- Never cross solid lines or cross hatched areas
- Religiously follow "no turn on red", "no left turn". "no U turn".
"no left between time X and time Y", "only right turn from this
lane", etc.

I get dissed all the time. Where is the courtesy?

No it doesn't. Prima facie speed limits as defined refer to when you

neighborhoods, for instance) in certain circumstances, and they are
prima facie precisely because they are *not* posted. They are

Not at all. When it says "notwithstanding" it means regardless of

means you must obey it no matter what the speed limit is.

Don't forget, the statute you're disputing refers to the normal speed

There is NO left lane clearing law in California. There is a law that

You apparently are too confused by your own twisted efforts to fit
round pegs into square holes to understand what we're discussing here,
sport. Let me remind you: No one is disputing that it is illegal to
speed. We all understand it is illegal to speed.

But what you don't understand, sonny, is that it is *also* illegal to
stay in the left lane in CA if you are going slower than the normal
speed of trafic at that time and place AND you are not passing another
vehicle.

Now that would be a new statute that hasn't been part of the

you engage in a fruitless search for the statute that specifically says
drivers going less than the *posted* speed limits from impeding the

"Notwithstanding the prima facie speed limits, any vehicle proceeding
upon a highway at a speed less than the normal speed of traffic moving
in the same direction at such time shall be driven in the right-hand
lane for traffic or as close as practicable to the right-hand edge or
curb..."

"Notwithstanding..." (that means "in spite of...")
"less than the normal speed...at such time..."
"Shall...shall...shall..."

The best part of course, which completely undercuts you, is the second
paragraph. That one says (have someone read and explain this to you,
KKK):

21654(b) If a vehicle is being driven at a speed less than the normal
speed of traffic moving in the same direction at such time, and is not
being driven in the right-hand lane for traffic or as close as

Of course not, son. Speeding is illegal. But so is driving in the left

California's Basic Speed Law takes precedence over the so-called "prima
facie"
speed limits of 15, 25, or 35 mph authorized by CVC 22352. It also
takes precedence over the 55 or 65 or 70 mph limits authorized in CVC
22349 and
CVC 22356. CVC 22348 says that a speeder just isn't going to get away
with violating the maximum speed limits by presenting competent
evidence in accordance with CVC 22351(b), which might be used to get
away with violating lesser prima facie limits such as those in CVC
22352...

Basic Speed Law CVC 22350.   No person shall drive a vehicle upon a
highway at a speed greater than is reasonable or prudent having due
regard for weather, visibility, the traffic on, and the surface and
width of, the highway, and in no event at a speed which endangers the
safety of persons or property.

So, the prima facie speed limit on a highway might be 35 mph, but if
there are a bunch of pedestrians running out into the street, the Basic
Speed Law prevails. The prima facie speed to drop to 5 mph. It could
drop to zero mph.

There might be other problems on the highway, weather, free range
cattle running loose, construction equipment, slower traffic, etc., but
motorists have come to believe that the MAXIMUM speed limit is a
MINIMUM speed limit and that they can push the limit as they please,
they will just *force* their way through all situations with the pedal
to the metal...

When combined with the urban myth that the lefthand lane is some sort
of "fast lane" or is always a "passing lane", this notion of the
maximum speed limit plus X number of miles per hour that busy traffic
cops will ignore leads to conflicts or collisions between motorists.

The highest speed authorized on any highway is contained in the
California Vehicle Code, which does not define "normal speed of
traffic" at all. Therefore, "normal speed of traffic" cannot possibly
be higher than what is authorized...

Speed Law Violations

22351.   (a) The speed of any vehicle upon a highway not in excess of
the limits specified in Section 22352 or established as authorized in
this code is lawful unless clearly proved to be in violation of the
basic speed law.

(b) The speed of any vehicle upon a highway in excess of the prima
facie speed limits in Section 22352 or established as authorized in
this code is prima facie unlawful unless the defendant establishes by
competent evidence that the speed in excess of said limits did not
constitute a violation of the basic speed law at the time, place and
under the conditions then existing.

&gt;is 15 and in a down slope my car is exceeding 15, I brake.
&gt;- ALWAYS come to a full stop at all stop signs, even if there are no
&gt;other cars around
&gt;- A blinking red is a stop sign. see above.
&gt;- Never cross solid lines or cross hatched areas
&gt;- Religiously follow &quot;no turn on red&quot;, &quot;no left turn&quot;. &quot;no U turn&quot;.
&gt;&quot;no left between time X and time Y&quot;, &quot;only right turn from this
&gt;lane&quot;, etc.
">

I do much the same as you do. I also signal when I turn... &lt;g&gt; I don't
try to enforce the law, ever. If I see something dangerous I pull over
and call 911, or ask my passenger to do so.

As to courtesy, I've found when you are considerate of other drivers,
often they are the same. Other than that, one can do as I usually do:
ride a bicycle whenever possible. Good for the environment, your
fitness, and it is one less car on the road.

No! Until Nixon imposed the 55 there were no maximum limits (the "limit" was
"safe and sane") and the 55 went away. Prima facie limits do nothing but
shift the burden of proof. You could well get ticketed for excessive speed
while driving under the posted limit, and many were, but the burden of proof
was on th state to show that speed was unsafe. Conversily, you could drive
well over the posted limit, as most people do, provided it was safe to do
so. And, if most people are safely driving faster than the posted limit
their speed is the "normal speed of traffic" and is NOT illegal. It is only
illegal to go faster than "safe and sane", and that is not for some road hog
to decide.

Virginia is different. Our government understands that many (most?) of our
LEOs are not bright enough to understand that concept, as witness your own
difficulty, so our limits are legally absolute - making most of us
criminals.

The "normal speed of traffic" at any particular time and place on a

What's sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander, bub. The "normal

I've pointed out numerous times that "normal" is undefined.

It's certainly not up to the speeding scofflaw to decide that his
unlawful driving is somehow "normal" just because he has gotten away
with it for a long time...

Well, I've said it before, I might as well say it again. There is NO
'fast lane" in the state of California. There are NO passing lanes.
The left lane has the same speed limit as any of the other lanes. The
left lane is there to be driven on. Californians drive continuously in
the left lane on all highways. Nobody cares except the speeding
scofflaws. The left lane is NOT reserved for speeders. Californians
will continue to drive in the left lane and ignore the speeding
scofflaws as best they can and the California Highway Patrol will
continue to ticket the speeding scofflaws. If a citizen complains about
being tailgated by a left lane speeder, the CHP officer will tell him
that, although he doesn't HAVE TO YIELD THE LEFT LANE, it would be
PRUDENT to do so...

If anybody has ever been cited for a violation of CVC 21654(a), I sure
as hell have never heard of it. It seems to be one of those strange
unnecessary laws that get enacted after some legislator gets a wild
hair up his ass, like "No person shall tie a giraffe to the railing of
the courthouse steps on February 29th." Maybe something like that
happens once in all eternity and a law gets passed and remains on the
books until somebody says, "What the fuck were they thinking of?"

Californians will continue to safely use the left lanes on freeways and
surface streets regardless of what you believe and the law enforcement
officers are about as likely to cite somebody for violation of CVC
21654(a) as they are to cite somebody for violation of the giraffe
statute...

And you are a masturbator, mentally speaking. Look, spunk-breath, of

structure to a logical syllogism that you need to follow if you want to
reach such a conclusion. We all see it here, 'cept you.

Here's your argument: "The highest speed that it is legal to drive is
specified in the CVC; the CVC has no definition of what the normal
speed of traffic is; therefore, it's completely impossible that the
speed at which traffic is moving normally at any given point in time
and place could ever be higher than the speed limit."

No. Those who heed your ill-advised LLB advocacy would be the ones

Seek professional help for this persecution complex of yours, and in

means. It's really that simple. Let the cops worry about the speed
lawbreakers; you just get yer ass outta the left lane if you're going

Only in the CVC is it undefined, oh Lord of the Idiots. That means

does refer to the "fast lane" of the highway. Checkmate.

The fact is also that 21654 requires you to get out of the left lane if
you're not passing and are going slower than other traffic. That, in
anyone's book but your "Golden Book of Wishful Thoughts If KKK Ruled

Hey smart guy.  Please post a link to the definition of "normal speed
of traffic" in the CA vehicle code.

this was all I could find:

http://www.dmv.ca.gov/pubs/vctop/vc/tocd1.htm

Apparently my search skills are not as good as yours, as I didn't see
one in there!  So I have no choice but to resort to a regular
dictionary:

http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=normal

Hmm, nowhere in there do I see the words "legal" or "speed limit."

You *are* the weakest link.  Goodbye.

Here is the law you asked for. Many people omit the first ten words so they
can pretend it says something else. But the truth be told it says..... if
you are in the left lane and someone wants to pass you what should you do?

§ 46.2-842. Driver to give way to overtaking vehicle.

Except when overtaking and passing on the right is permitted, the driver of
an overtaken vehicle shall give way to the right in favor of the overtaking
vehicle on audible signal and shall not increase the speed of his vehicle
until completely passed by the overtaking vehicle. Any over-width, or
slow-moving vehicle as defined by § 46.2-1081 shall be removed from the
roadway at the nearest suitable location when necessary to allow traffic to
pass.

If anybody needs to be reminded, tailgating is still illegal. Pay
attestation to that word "both"

§ 46.2-816. Following too closely.

The driver of a motor vehicle shall not follow another motor vehicle,
trailer, or semi more closely than is reasonable and prudent, having due
regard to the speed of both vehicles and the traffic on, and conditions of,
the highway at the time.

&gt;&gt;&gt; vehicle because he has a broken parking light lens?

&gt;&gt; No I wouldn't. My point was and still is. I live inVirginia. We do not
&gt;&gt; have a &quot;passing lane&quot; in Virginia. If you are traveling at the maximum
&gt;&gt; allowable speed in the left most lane of an interstate (in Virginia) you
&gt;&gt; are not required to change lanes, because the person behind you wants to
&gt;&gt; break the law and go faster than the speed limit. This applies to any
&gt;&gt; divided highway where passing on the right is allowed. There are some
&gt;&gt; exceptions (locally) and localities are given the ability to designate
&gt;&gt; some lanes for slower travel.

&gt; The law that has been quoted many times here says otherwise, despite what

&gt; &gt; harder concepts, like---no, I don't want to spoil it for you, I want
&gt; &gt; you to feel like you've discovered it on your own.
&gt; Hey smart guy.  Please post a link to the definition of &quot;normal speed
&gt; of traffic&quot; in the CA vehicle code.
&gt; this was all I could find:
&gt; http://www.dmv.ca.gov/pubs/vctop/vc/tocd1.htm
">

It would have been nice if the legislators had defined everything
instead of making us look up all the CVC sections regarding rules of
the road and figure it out from context. But "normal speed of traffic"
is going to be anywhere from dead stopped in bumper to bumper traffic
to the maximum speed limit authorized for that type of highway, be it
surface streets, 2-lane highway, or freeway. "Normal speed of traffic"
isn't going to be in excess of the maximum authorized speed limit. If
speed in excess of the authorized limit was "normal" the friendly
ossifers wouldn't be pulling you over to write you a citation, would
they?

No, there is something else hidden right before your eyes in CVC 21654,
pay attention, you'll find it. And you need to read a number of other
sections to get the meaning of CVC 21654 from the context of the entire
Rules of the Road article. Furthermore, the California Driver's
Handbook will explain a bit more about sharing the road with other
vehicles and lead to a satori about CVC 21654 and the nature of the
vehicle(s) it's talking about.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Reductio ad absurdum says that this is simply not the case; would you
&gt;&gt;&gt; argue that I don't need to yield the passing lane to a following
&gt;&gt;&gt; vehicle because he has a broken parking light lens?

&gt;&gt; No I wouldn't. My point was and still is. I live inVirginia. We do not
&gt;&gt; have a &quot;passing lane&quot; in Virginia. If you are traveling at the maximum
&gt;&gt; allowable speed in the left most lane of an interstate (in Virginia) you
&gt;&gt; are not required to change lanes, because the person behind you wants to
&gt;&gt; break the law and go faster than the speed limit. This applies to any
&gt;&gt; divided highway where passing on the right is allowed. There are some
&gt;&gt; exceptions (locally) and localities are given the ability to designate
&gt;&gt; some lanes for slower travel.

&gt; The law that has been quoted many times here says otherwise, despite what
&gt; you may mave been told by your supervisor/instructor/whatever.  I have not
&gt; seen a cite yet that backs up your assertion, and at least one fairly

Hey, Dimwit! I'm not enforcing ANYTHING. I'm telling you the Way It Is,
the Way It Was, the Way It Will Be...

The CHP's KNOW they can't catch the worst speeding assholes when the
majority of drivers are proceeding at the speed limit, so they don't
try, they stay off the freeways during rush hour. The Chippies go out
when traffic is light and catch the aggressive speeding drivers really
letting it all hang out.

Then the agressive scofflaw mumbles a bunch of crap about, "Is there a
problem officer? Why are you picking ME out of traffic? I was just
going with the flow of traffic. I just drive like everybody else
drives. 85 percent of traffic is exceeding the maximum speed limit.
Blah blah blah."

The ossifer has heard all that BULLSHIT before. So the cop tells the
idiot to tell it to the judge and the judge smiles and listens, hoping
someday he will hear a new excuse so the court staff can all get a good
laugh and Hizzoner finds the miscreant guilty as charged and fines him
according to the DMV requirements and the court clerk adds a 200%
penalty assessment and the revenue just keeps flowing in as the CHP
ossifers expand their waists at Winchell's during rush hour and then go

California has the same law, effective 1 January 1980...

Minimum Speed Law CVC 22400.   (a) No person shall drive upon a highway
at such a slow speed as to impede or block the normal and reasonable
movement of traffic, unless the reduced speed is necessary for safe
operation, because of a grade, or in compliance with law.

The section goes on to say that the department may erect minimum speed
limit signs, but this has never been done. That omission has probably
saved the sanity of thousands of speeding scofflaws who would have
argued, "B-b-but, your Honor! The driver ahead of me just wouldn't
drive at the minimum POSTED speed limit, and he didn't move over when I
blew my horn and flashed my lights, so I started bumping him to make
him yield the lane! And that's when the mean old cop stopped ME! Why'd
he stop ME? I wan't doin' nothin' wrong! Boo hoo hoo hoo!"

The section also goes on to say that any such minimum speed limits
would not apply to unregistered vehicles (like mopeds and logging
equipment) that also share our highways. Urban drivers enjoying a
moment of personal triumph while driving at high speeds on country
roads might be totally unaware that there was anybody else sharing
their imaginary kingdom and "freedom of the road"...

Go back and read the section again. Keep reading it until you find
enlightenment about what it means and what types of vehicles it refers
to. Think about Edgar Allen Poe. Then carefully read the ENTIRE section
for meaning and application. You can refer to the California Drivers
Handbook for more clues. Also, study ALL of Divison 11 until you get a
feel for what the legislators were up to. The CVC is a hodge podge of
ad hoc sections that grew like Topsy, without clear definitions and you
have to look at entire chapters and articles to understand what the
legislature was trying to accomplish with any vague section.

CVC 21654(a) is NOT the left laning clearing statute you so fondly wish
it was. I am about as likely to be driving a "slow-moving vehicle" in
the left lane as I am to wear a pink tutu to a class where third grade
students are
learning ballet. I have driven for 45 years in California and have
never been stopped for a violation of CVC 21654(a) and don't ever
expect to be stopped for such a violation...

As I have told you before, California has a law to deal with
intentional traffic blocking and it is NOT CVC 21654(a).

Argue with this section, and especially, explain to me what
"reasonable" means:

Division 11, Chapter 7, Article 2, Section 22400

Minimum Speed Law

22400.   (a) No person shall drive upon a highway at such a slow speed
as to impede or block the normal and reasonable movement of traffic,
unless the reduced speed is necessary for safe operation, because of a
grade, or in compliance with law.

No person shall bring a vehicle to a complete stop upon a highway so as
to impede or block the normal and reasonable movement of traffic unless
the stop is necessary for safe operation or in compliance with law.

(b) Whenever the Department of Transportation determines on the basis
of an engineering and traffic survey that slow speeds on any part of a
state highway consistently impede the normal and reasonable movement of
traffic, the department may determine and declare a minimum speed limit
below which no person shall drive a vehicle, except when necessary for
safe operation or in compliance with law, when appropriate signs giving
notice thereof are erected along the part of the highway for which a
minimum speed limit is established.

Subdivision (b) of this section shall apply only to vehicles subject to
registration

Amended Ch. 364, Stats. 1979. Effective January 1, 1980.

I previously expounded at great length about vehicles not subject to
registration which might commonly be encountered upon a highway and
which the aggressive speeding scofflaws might need to slow down for...

There are still no minimum speed limit signs anywhere I've driven in
California, but California's Basic Speed Law would make the minimum
speed limit moot, while driving the aggressive vigilante speeding
scofflaws absolutely INSANE with rage...

Since CVC 21645 was efective on January 1, 1975, it appears there was
five years of evolution of legal thought to determine how to deal with
intentional lane blocking, while at the same time dealing with
aggressive speeding scofflaws and also ignoring their territorial
claims to the left lane as a "fast lane" or "passing lane", neither of
which exist in the state of California!

Well, Mr. Nureyev, how about giving us a plie or two? Whether a vehicle
is slow-moving or not is an entirely relative matter, now, when you
factor in the actual language of the statute, which forms the actual
legal obligations and prohibitions. Learn how to read legislation. You
are a slow-moving vehicle in 21654 if you are going the speed limit at
65 but all those around you are going 75. Free klue, KKK: Re-read the

Minimum speed law has no bearing on the conditions under 21654 when you
have to clear the left lane. 21654 refers to highways with multiple

But, you stop prematurely. The implication of the CVC when taken as a
whole specifically requires that vehicle (farm tractor perhaps) to be
driven in the *right* lane and to *clear out* of the left lane under
the circumstances of 21654. So there. Thanks for further illustrating

Last night one of these idiots tried this shit with me.  He was
staying next to a clueless moron in the right lane, both doing 10
under the limit.  I got tired of the games, and brights not affecting
him, so I passed him.  All of a sudden, a miracle occurs, and he finds
his gas pedal.  Must suck to be him and get blown away by a mini van.

So I slow down, and allow the cars that had built up behind him to
pass.  They all move by on the right, why moron boy tries to
"intimidate me" with his brights.  Good thing dave head doesn't get
his way, as I could ignore him without even adjusting my mirror due to
the tint that comes standard.

Well idjit boy tries to pass me on the right, clueless and all that
the same sorry ass driver in a Mustang still can't pass someone in a
Honda who knows how to drive.  I decide to spoon feed him his medicine
one mile at a time.  For 10 miles.  (Note, no other drivers approached
from the rear in this time.)

As we come to the next town, the vehicle on my right, still clueless
that someone has been just off their quarter panel for 10 miles, turns
into their street.  Now dickless boy decides to accelerate past me and
show me who is superior.  Again, as you would expect, he failed.
First, because the red light up ahead prevents him from doing so, and
second because I am turning left.

I notice that he is now going to turn left, and presumably he plans on
trying to catch back up with me, so I turn up a side street to meet
him.  Virgin boy had decided to turn around and follow me from behind.
Of course as I am waiting for him to clear the light, I notice he
actually passes behind me and over some rail road tracks.  So I turn
left, and then left again, onto the street he is now on.

Sadly, my steering wheel malfunctions, and I accidentally continue to
turn into his vehicle, forcing him to drive to the curb with his eyes
as wide as saucers.  Pretty cool trick for an LLB who couldn't open
his eyes to see other traffic, and somehow funny in itself.

So I wave and pass by, content to know that he is incapable of
catching me.  I take an alley to where he will end up, laugh as he
goes by, and proceed to follow him.  Now, flustered beyond belief, he
tries to outwit me by cutting across traffic to lose me.  I notice the
cop sitting in the side street, where he is every day, and laugh as
the lights go on, as I cruise by smiling, knowing another LLB has
learned to not mess with superior drivers.

&gt; Well, Mr. Nureyev, how about giving us a plie or two? Whether a vehicle

&gt; factor in the actual language of the statute, which forms the actual

&gt; 65 but all those around you are going 75. Free klue, KKK: Re-read the

No, YOU read the CDH and you'll learn that a "slow-moving vehicle" is
NOT slow in relation to the speed that scofflaws are driving at, it's a
slow-moving vehicle PERIOD.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
California Driver Handbook - Sharing the Road with Other Vehicles        SLOW
MOVING VEHICLES Some vehicles are not designed to keep up with the
speed of traffic. Look for these vehicles and adjust your speed before
you reach them. Farm tractors, animal-drawn carts, and road maintenance
vehicles usually travel 25 mph or less Slow moving vehicles have an
orange triangle on the back.
Also, be aware that large trucks and small, under powered cars lose
speed on long or steep hills and they take longer to get up to speed
when entering traffic. Certain other types of slow moving motorized
vehicles (such as wheelchairs, scooters and golf carts) may legally
operate on public roads. Adjust your speed accordingly.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
There are situations where passenger cars temporarily are "slow-moving
vehicles"  because they lack the power or handling to climb a steep
grade or corner at high lateral accelerations like a Porsche, but they
are not ALWAYS slow moving vehicles.

Some scofflaw in a Dodge Viper on a wide open highway could claim that
a guy in a Honda Civic was a "slow-moving vehicle" because the Honda
driver wouldn't violate the 70 mph speed limit. After passing the
Civic, the Viper driver might slow down to, say 75. And then the
annoyed Civic driver might retaliate and crowd him and claim that the
Viper was a "slow moving vehicle"...

They could escalate this pissing contest at ever higher and higher
speeds with the Viper driver trying to intimidate the Civic driver and
back and forth. And if a CHP officer was watching all this, he would
stop BOTH of them and cite them for engaging in a speed contest. He
could impound their cars and leave them standing beside the road
scratching their heads as to why the CHP didn't just cite the
"slow-moving vehicle" and let the "normal flow of traffic" continue on
its meery way...

"Shall be driven in the right-hand lane for traffic or as close as

"any vehicle" to extend the applicability of the section to make it

should, in your Carollian Universe
yield the left lane (if there is one) or move over as far right
"as practicable" to allow vehicles travelling at the "normal speed of
traffic"...

Vehicles". All the 18-wheelers full of produce and livestock, and all
the duallie pickup trucks towing horse trailers, and all the busses
carrying senior citizens to the Indian casino up on the hill, all of
those "Slow-Moving Vehicles just drive right along at 55 mph and they
make no effort WHATEVER to move over "as far as practicable to the
right hand edge or curb", even though the paved shoulder is at least
SIX FEET WIDE...

And the drivers of fast passenger cars and unladen duallie pickup
trucks would all like to drive their "Normal Speed" of 75 or 80 mph in
that 55 mph zone...

And what I'm wondering, maybe you could explain it to me, why don't ANY
of those trucks and busses and pickup trucks towing trailers move over
as far to the right as "practicable"? Why do they just keep on
a-truckin', and
a-bussin' and a-towin' if CVC 21654(a) really means "Get The Hell Out
of My Way, I'm Comin' Through, You Lane Blockers!"????

And why is it that the California Highway Patrol doesn't stop those
Rolling Road Blocks and write them tickets for holding up the Sacred
Flow Of Traffic? They be a-blockin' traffic ever' day!

Enquiring Minds Want To Know...

And then there is this section, that uses similar language about
"normal flow of traffic at the particular time and place:

Turning Out of Slow-Moving Vehicles
21656.   On a two-lane highway where passing is unsafe because of
traffic in the opposite direction or other conditions, a slow-moving
vehicle, including a passenger vehicle, behind which five or more
vehicles are formed in line, shall turn off the roadway at the nearest
place designated as a turnout by signs erected by the authority having
jurisdiction over the highway, or wherever sufficient area for a safe
turnout exists, in order to permit the vehicles following it to
proceed. As used in this section a slow-moving vehicle is one which is
proceeding at a rate of speed less than the normal flow of traffic at
the particular time and place.

Hey, there's a long line of trucks and busses and trailer a-comin' the
other way too! Ever' day! All o' them "Slow-Moving Vehicles" are just
a-cruisin' along at 55 mph, and they're a-blockin' a whole shit pot o'
cars and pickup trucks that be a-wantin' to drive 85 mph so's they can
get to Happy Hour in the Loading Chute Bar and Grill before the beer on
tap runs out and they have to pay by the bottle...

And there ain't NONE o' them "Slow-Moving Vehicles" goin' either
direction that is makin' a move to pull over and let five cars go by!

Wazzup wif dat? Enquiring minds just got to know why they don't pull
out and why the CHP's don't bust their Rolling Roadblock asses!

A "highway" in California includes one-lane, two-lane, four-lane,

You friggin' idiot. You have not yet grasped a simple fact, have you?
If as you suggest all those vehicles are going whatever speed they're

That doesn't include you, impervious as you are to learning. But for

No. I referred to a CVC section which pointed out that a defendant
could prove that it was not unlawful to exceed certain lower posted
speed limits, i.e., the
15 mph limit at blind intersections, alleys and railroad crossings, or
the 25 mph limit around schools or senior centers or in nusiness
districts, or the higher posted 35 mph speed if that's what is in
effect for the business district. (1)

So far as the maximum 55mph on two-lane highways or the 65 or 70 mph
limits are concerned, they are absolute and sacrosanct. Presentation of
competent evidence that a driver could "safely" exceed those maximum
limits will NOT work. The violator would have to prove that the
violation did NOT take place, or that the officer could not have
actually seen the violation or that the officer did something illegal
when he stopped and cited the violator.

If you try to argue with an ossifer alongside the road, he'll tell you
that he just does what he's told, that he doesn't have a "crystal ball"
to tell him what's right and what's wrong, he writes down what he sees
and transmits that citation to the court and the miscreant can tell it
to the judge who's heard it all before and desperately wishes a
defendant would come up with something novel and interesting so the
whole court can get a laugh at the defendant's expense. If a driver or
biker wants to avoid all that courtroom farce, the best thing is to
stay alert, watch for cops and generally be obeying the speed limits
and traffic signs and road markings. There aren't enough cops to patrol
all the roads all the time so they do special enforcement "sweeps" that
drag in a lot of careless operators who have gotten into the habit of
speeding...

(1)Speed Law Violations

22351.   (a) The speed of any vehicle upon a highway not in excess of
the limits specified in Section 22352 or established as authorized in
this code is lawful unless clearly proved to be in violation of the
basic speed law.

(b) The speed of any vehicle upon a highway in excess of the prima
facie speed limits in Section 22352 or established as authorized in
this code is prima facie unlawful unless the defendant establishes by
competent evidence that the speed in excess of said limits did not
constitute a violation of the basic speed law at the time, place and
under the conditions then existing.

All the defendant would need to prove his speed was not unsafe is
competent evidence, like a traffic survey or an expert witness. The
whole trial should cost him no more than about $500 if he shops for an
attorney. And it's a one shot deal. Next time he violates the prima
facie speed limits mentioned above and gets caught, he has to start all
over again with new bail deposit of $300, hire an attorney for another
$300 and present the competent evidence all over again...

If you've been reading Phil Scott's rantings and ravings over in
alt.motorcycle.sportbike (and any *other* Kooknet NG where he thinks he
might get his screed read), old Filbert is trying to get what's called
a "narrative ruling" on his 54 mph in a 45 zone citation. He's already
admitted in writing that he was going that fast, but turns around and
says the ossifer couldn't have seen him doing 54 mph because it was in
a tunnel out of the ossifer's view.

Filbert doesn't just want the judge to find him not guilty or dismiss
the matter. He wants a "narrative ruling". He wants his hoped-for
victory in court to become case law, making it absolutely legal for
motorcyclists to keep up with the flow of traffic, whatever that may
be, making them immune from
speed limit violations.

If any of you are from texas, take note:

If you find an emergency vehicle (ambulance/fire) or police car in the
right shoulder with lights flashing, you should either vacate the lane
or go at 20 under the speed limit. Very steep fines!!

http://www.txdps.state.tx.us/director_staff/public_information/pr0819...

A real case of enforcement:
http://www.truthorfiction.com/rumors/t/texas-sb193.htm

When I go to texas this december, if I see a cop giving a ticket to a
motorist in the right shoulder I HAVE to go to the left lane or slow
down to 20 under. I guess I will follow the letter of the law. Worse
if emergency vehicle/cop car is in left shoulder. Then the LEFT LANE
has to be vacated or driven 20 under.

So I guess it's ok in some cases to be VERY slow in the left lane,
i.e. if you see a cop car flashing on the right shoulder and you MUST
be in that lane but you DO NOT believe in crimminal speeding.

The maximum speed limits on California freeways cannot be exceeded:

Excessive Speed and Designated Lane Use
22348. (a) Notwithstanding subdivision (b) of Section 22351,  a person
shall not drive a vehicle upon a highway with a speed limit established
pursuant to Section 22349 or 22356 at a speed greater than that speed
limit.

A motorist may be stopped and cited for driving  ANY speed up to and
including the so-called "prima facie" speed limits described in CVC
22352 if it isn't safe to drive at those speeds. He can be cited for a
violation of CVC 22350.

Basic Speed Law
22350. No person shall drive a vehicle upon a highway at a speed
greater than is reasonable or prudent having due regard for weather,
visibility, the traffic on, and the surface and width of, the highway,
and in no event at a speed which endangers the safety of persons or
property.

As an example, the prima facie speed limit at a blind intersection
might be 15 mph, but a motorist can't drive 15 mph through a blind
intersection if he can see there is a person that might be injured or
property that might be damaged. Under some conditions, the prima facie
speed limit could be ZERO miles per hour, because it would be unsafe to
move the vehicle at all!

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; 22350VC (basic speed law) doesn't apply for
&gt; people who go faster than these speed limits.
">

Of course it does. A violator may be stopped and cited and will have to
prove by competent evidence that exceeding the prima facie speed limit
was not unsafe by presenting competent evidence. If he wins the case,
and does the same thing again and gets stopped and cited, he's back at
square one, he has to prove that what he did was unsafe. If he keeps
violating the prima facie speed limits of CVC 22352, he'll eventually
go broke or regain his sanity and behave himself!

I don't think the legislators are stupid. Corrupt, maybe, but not
STUPID. They know that they can't turn the public loose to do as they
please, there have to be laws and cops and courts and traffic schools
to make them think about the folly of what they are doing...

You saw people driving 75/85 during non-peak traffic hours. They think
they can get away with anything they please if they don't see a cop
watching.

They play the odds, whether they realize that, or not. They may or may
not know they *probably* won't get stopped but about once every two or
three years if they just keep on speeding...

They speed, thinking they are just "going with the flow", and the CHP
will catch them, IF the CHP is ordered to run a "traffic sweep". Then
there will be SEVERAL CHP units having a ticket party on one stretch of
freeway...

But, I can't say that I believe that California drivers have the
slightest concept of what 'safe and sane' means, when I drive on
surface streets or freeways around the Los Angeles basin.

Gently sloping hills get the drivers up to 85 mph approaching the
heavily congested areas, and I am able to keep my speed under control.
However, even though I *know* where traffic is going to come to a
complete stop every day during rush hour, and I can *see* traffic
beginning to stack up ahead of me and I can *see* brake lights coming
on, several utter IDIOTS will pass me at 85 or 90 mph, aimed right at
the parking lot of stopped cars on the freeway! And they do it every
day, just like they've never SEEN the massive traffic jam before!

Maybe they remember ONE day when they were able to drive the speed
limit during rush hour, going to work, and they think they will repeat
that experience? Fat chance of that ever happening. The way to get to
work in the minimum amount of time is to START EARLY. Like, if they
have to be at work at 8:00 AM, start out at 6:30 AM, get to work early
and find something to occupy themselves during the extra half hour,
like read a book, or have a leisurely breakfast at a coffee shop.

At 6:30 or 7:00 AM traffic IS flowing at the speeds they can to drive.
During rush hours, traffic is utterly jammed. It's the same thing in
the San Francisco Bay Area, but worse. I remember coming back to L.A.
from Sears Point, and I got into rush hour traffic going past Walnut
Hill into San Jose. It was a 2-lane freeway and endless lines of cars
and me and just a few motorcycles splitting lanes, and the car drivers
were giving me evil looks like I was doing something felonious by
passing their miserable freeway parking lot. And they continue to do it
EVERY day.

If it's a "happy situation", why are the Virginia drivers whining about
"lane discipline"? They make it sound like having to drive the speed
limit, stay in line, and wait their turn is a horrible ordeal. The
little driving that I've done in Maryland and Virginia makes it look
like paradise compared to the overbuilt Los Angeles/Orange
County/Riverside/San Diego/San Bernardino county freeway Hell...

In California, the Highway Patrol is busy with a lot of tasks, like
guarding bridges from terrorists and inspecting trucks for overloading
and safety violations, and clearing accident scenes and investigating
crimes that take place on the highways, and chasing trucks filled with
illegal immigrants. It's all in a day's work to those highly trained
professional officers...

The CHP's are just too busy to catch all the drivers who are speeding
at 10 mph over the limit. But they will catch SOME of them in their
enforcement sweeps and SOME of them will be arrogant enough to claim
that they weren't doing anything so wrong and why whould they be picked
out of traffic, and the judge will convict them and fine them...

All you lane-discipine fanatics are crazy. If I am going at speed
limit, I should be able to travel in any lane. The fact that cops
give tickets for speeding means that it is illegal. When commiting an
illegal act, one loses his right-of-way on the road. Anybody wants to
refute my logic?

Let me give you an analogy. If a person trips another person who was
running and the runner gets hurt then the guy who trips can be sued.
Think of a twist in the tale, i.e. the runner was a crimminal (like
the speeders on the road) who was running away with a lady's purse.
Then if he was tripped and got hurt then the court and police will
laugh away any lawsuits.

Speeding is not a "soft" crime, despite whatever you folks think. Its
black and white. Are you following the letter of the law or not?? I
support you Kalifornia kritter and Guardenman.

This is not merely theoretical. I have a question. I wish to travel at
exactly speed limit, not one mile over but also not one mile under at
any point of time. exit and entry point traffic slows one down on the
rightmost lane. So in a 2 or 3 lane highway, when I move to the no 2
lane, I slow down traffic. However, isn't it my prerogative to do so?
What is wrong with not wanting to commit crime but travel as fast as
possible at the same time?

I sure agree

BUT I do hope you understand that you also have  a responsibility  not
to endanger other drivers, even if they are speeding...

By impeeding traffic you are just as irrsponsible  a driver as the guy
driving 20 or 30 mph over the limit....both of you are dangerous

Hi Bob

I see that you ignored my analogy. I drive strictly by the law and
expect every other driver to do so as well.

There is a small exit ramp from a stripmall near my aptment which is
right turn only (no signal present). When I am on the main road, I
frequently see people trying to turn left from there, which is
extremely dangerous in addition to being a crimminal act. I have seen
two accidents in as many years. Hence, if I see any moron trying to
turn left and there is a gap behind me as I pass the mall, I slow
down to "box him in". If there is a gap ahead of me, I speed up. When
I enter that complex, to turn left I go around the parking lot to the
traffic signal exit where you can legally turn left. It only adds a
few minutes to the drive. In fact, in one case, I took great pleasure
when one moron turned off his left turn signal and turned right (it
was rush hour and maybe when I blocked him it wore him down). I
stopped one crimminal act.

Near my work place there is a turn only lane separated from the travel
lanes by a solid white line. I have to turn right by taking the turn
only lane. Once I missed it, but rather than breaking the law by
crossing the solid white line I sent straight and did a U turn. Next
two signals are "no U tirn" so it added 10 minutes to my drive but
that was OK. I followed the law. In fact, I saw a crimminal doing an
illegal U turn at one of the signals.
Once, when I was about to turn right, I saw one guy in the travel lane
change his mind and give a right turn indicator. I sped up to cut him
off. There was traffic behind me and he was stuck in the travel lane
when the light turned green. He blocked one lane and was trying to
get into the turn lane. People were honking. Finally one
aider-and-abetter-of-crimminal-act let him in.

I also follow ALL speed limits (15, 25. 30, 35, whatever), come to a
complete stop for ALL stop signs, NEVER drive over a cross-hatched
area of the road, always brake for yellow, etc..

I know some people will take exception to my world view but if
everyone drives strictly according to the law then there will be no
accidents. If you were living in country X where murder is illegal
but *wink wink nudge nudge* and the cops dont enforce it structly,
that still does not mean killing another human being is right. Its
all black and white. There are only two possibilities: a) you follow
the law b) you are a crimminal

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; In the state of California the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; left lane is neither a &quot;fast lane&quot;, nor a &quot;passing lane&quot;. California
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; has so much traffic on its highways, all lanes are needed to move
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; heavy
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; traffic. All that tailgating or flashing lights or blowing horns
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; proves
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; about a tailgating driver is that he is ignorant of the law, or from
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; another state...

&gt;&gt; &gt; Except for the fact of CA state law, which you continue to ignore. It
&gt;&gt; &gt; doesn't have to use the term &quot;fast lane&quot; or &quot;passing lane&quot; as they
&gt;&gt; &gt; are lay colloquialisms. But the code you continually deny exists says
&gt;&gt; &gt; this:

&gt;&gt; &gt; 21654.  (a) **Notwithstanding the prima facie speed limits,** any
&gt;&gt; &gt; vehicle proceeding upon a highway at a speed **less than the normal
&gt;&gt; &gt; speed of traffic** moving in the same direction at such time **shall**
&gt;&gt; &gt; be driven in the right-hand lane for traffic or as close as practicable
&gt;&gt; &gt; to the right-hand edge or curb, except when overtaking and passing
&gt;&gt; &gt; another vehicle proceeding in the same direction or when preparing for
&gt;&gt; &gt; a left turn at an intersection or into a private road or driveway.

&gt;&gt; yes but doesn't California code define &quot;prima facie speed limits&quot; as
&gt;&gt; posted
&gt;&gt; speed limits less than the maximum speed otherwise allowable under the
&gt;&gt; law.

&gt; No it doesn't. Prima facie speed limits as defined refer to when you
&gt; should be going 15 (in alleys, for instance) or 25 mph (in
&gt; neighborhoods, for instance) in certain circumstances, and they are
&gt; prima facie precisely because they are *not* posted. They are
&gt; *superceded* by any posted limit.
&gt; http://www.dmv.ca.gov/pubs/vctop/d11/vc22352.htm

&gt;&gt; So when they say &quot;Notwithstanding the prima facie speed limits&quot; what they
&gt;&gt; mean is aslong as the speed remains the normal state speed limit (55 ?).
&gt;&gt; If
&gt;&gt; it drops down to35 while you pass threw cow town. throw the whole thing
&gt;&gt; out.

&gt; Not at all. When it says &quot;notwithstanding&quot; it means regardless of
&gt; whatever they are. So therefore, the left-lane clearing law there in CA
&gt; means you must obey it no matter what the speed limit is.

22351.  (a) The speed of any vehicle upon a highway not in excess of

&gt; All you lane-discipine fanatics are crazy. If I am going at speed

&gt; give tickets for speeding means that it is illegal. When commiting an
&gt; illegal act, one loses his right-of-way on the road. Anybody wants to
&gt; refute my logic?

&gt; Let me give you an analogy. If a person trips another person who was
&gt; running and the runner gets hurt then the guy who trips can be sued.
&gt; Think of a twist in the tale, i.e. the runner was a crimminal (like
&gt; the speeders on the road) who was running away with a lady's purse.
&gt; Then if he was tripped and got hurt then the court and police will
&gt; laugh away any lawsuits.

&gt; Speeding is not a &quot;soft&quot; crime, despite whatever you folks think. Its
&gt; black and white. Are you following the letter of the law or not?? I
&gt; support you Kalifornia kritter and Guardenman.

&gt; This is not merely theoretical. I have a question. I wish to travel at

I feel that we all see your logic.  But, for the sake of safety, I am
going to get out of that speeder's way by ceding the left lane.  That would
be a good way to instigate road rage.  By impeding his law-breaking act, if
I get hurt in the process, I will refrain in the future from such acts.  So
why wait until I get hurt?  I know if I chug a cup of McDonald's coffee, my
mouth will get burned, so why test it?  I'll leave that to the lawsuitors.
The whole idea might be better described as negative progressiveism.
There are too many speeders for me to undertake correcting them all.  Save
the leftmost lane for the speeders and it should make the patrolman's job
easier, as he'll  need to watch only one lane!!!
What I'm about to describe is impedance enough, but maybe more nearly
justified for those who wish to drive the speed limit.  Ever tried driving
the speed limit in the rightmost lane?  Try it on the i-state some time.
You can often drive for miles upon miles w/out having to break your speed or
drop your cruise control.  And, you'll often catch some of those passers
when you reach a metropolitan area.  You'll pass very few.  Many will pass
you.  Plus you can smile when you pass one of those speeders beside the
road, stopped by a patrolman. You've impeded, hopefully, no one--at least no
one who should point a finger at you!
Hopefully, this spiel will help somebody avoid getting hurt or hurting
someone else.  s

Don't do it in Pennsylvania, it is illegal for one to drive in
the left lane except to overtake another vehicle, whether one is
driving at the speed limit or not.  If you do and a cop sees you
it will cost you $136  ;)

hi Mike

I do not drive on the leftmost lane. When a highway has three or four
lanes on each side, I can drive in the no 2 lane (from the right) at
speed limit. Heck, even if I drive at speed limit in the rightmost
lane and am forced to go to 5 or 10 below speed limit for idiots who
merge in at 30, I am tailgated on an average twice in my 30 mile
commute. The traffic I am "impeding" can get into the left most lane
to pass me.
Speed limit is 50 for 10 miles around a bridge in teh DC area. I drive
at 50 exactly. In no 2 lane. It does seem silly. The road can support
higher speeds. But I will not break the law just because everyone
else is.

In long stretches of road with few exits I go at exactly speed limit
in the rightmost lane, as sdlomi suggests. It adds 5 to 10 minutes to
my commute, tops.

Summarizing, it is OK to go at exactly speed limit in rightmost or the
lane after that. Even if speeders come and stick to you in these two
lanes rather than going to "fast" lane to pass you when you do so.
What about neighborhoods with speed limit of 20 or 25? Hardly anyone
follows those laws to the letter. I believe in following THE LAW,
even if it annoys people following me. Please inform me as to where
is the lane for law-abiding citizens if all the lanes are for
law-breaking crimminals?

GLARING LIE popping up somewhere. Well, this is a case in point...

"Yet even while Armstrong has dominated a sport like perhaps no other
athlete, cycling still finds itself fighting for respectability in the
United States."

Yep, I got three bicycles that go unused, forcing me into the world of
the polluting pigs, because there are no BIKE LANES and OUR ROADS
REMAIN A JUNGLE. It's kind of ironic that you represent a nation where
only 1% of commuters use a bike. Perhaps we should be #1 in the
Paris-Dakar thanks to our almighty HUMMERS. But well, we live in a
world of images and lies, camouflage so to speak...

"The United States is basically a huge catastrophe.  Everything is
designed around the automobile, so much so that other essential forms
of transit such as walking, mass transit, and bicycling - which in any
sane society are the essential modes of transit - become unpleasant,
undesirable, and even dangerous."

European do not ride bikes by choice, they do so out of
necessity. They like the folks in may countries simply can not
afford to operate a vehicle, period.  If and when Americans, who
actually live where they can commute by bike, want to do so they
can and will.  I hear of TV recently that many Brits are
switching to bikes and motor bikes because of the subway
bombings.  I suppose they don't care that more people are injured
or killed in bike and motor bike accidents in a year than do
people die is subway bombings.  ;)

Well, many things are doable that don't look it at first sight. For
example you see people riding bikes in the middle of Oslo's winter...
Likewise biking is doable here in super hot Miami, particularly in the
cooler morning and evening since it's then that most commuting occurs.
What I'm talking about though is not the NEED, but the OPPORTUNITY to
ride it.

As for public transportation I see it working big time in other large
cities, so it's a matter of bringing some of that experience here, for
example...

Curitiba: Model city?

One of the biggest threats to sustainability is that for many countries
which are urbanising rapidly, for example India and China, a
Westernised style of city may be followed - meaning a city dominated
by cars and increasing 'edge' developments for housing and services.

The 'doughnut' model of an empty city centre and rapidly growing
fringe has led to efforts to curb such developments by many authorities
with the revitalisation of the city centre through prestigious retail
and leisure redevelopments on brownfield sites. Examples are La Defense

Cities will not evolve into a sustainable form since there are so many
different groups involved - speculators, individuals, pressure groups
and so on. Planning and proactive management is critical to resolve
differences in opinion and to safeguard minority social groups - but
it needs strict political resolve!

Transportation policies
Two-thirds of Curitibans used public transport by the 1990s - with 25
percent less congestion and noticeably cleaner air than cities of
similar size. Sophisticated bus services dominate, acting like railways
with 1.3 million people using the system daily. There is integration
between the different forms of transport.

&gt;&gt; I won't agree with the catastophe part, but there's not a lot of use of transit
&gt;&gt; if it can be avoided.  If you didn't have to _wait_ on transit to arrive, and
&gt;&gt; it didn't _stop_ at places where you aren't interested in getting on or off,
&gt;&gt; and you didn't have to _share_ space with strangers so you can't eat, smoke,
&gt;&gt; play the radio, etc, and if it would go exactly where you want to  - IOW, if it
&gt;&gt; worked like your car, then virtually everyone would want to ride it.  But it
&gt;&gt; doesn't work anything like that, and is a trial to use.  Its a pain in the ass.
&gt;&gt; Its _surprising_ that as many people use it as they do.

&gt;Well, many things are doable that don't look it at first sight. For
&gt;example you see people riding bikes in the middle of Oslo's winter...

Brrrr...

I'll bet its no _fun_, tho, and much less preferable than a good car with a
heater set to "creamate".

&gt;Likewise biking is doable here in super hot Miami, particularly in the
&gt;cooler morning and evening since it's then that most commuting occurs.

It's evening here - 6:48 PM, and the heat/humidity could be freeze-dried and
sold.  Any sort of exertion in this atmosphere would result in an instant
Niagara Falls of sweat.

&gt;What I'm talking about though is not the NEED, but the OPPORTUNITY to

Yeah, OK. &lt;G&gt;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;As for public transportation I see it working big time in other large
&gt;cities, so it's a matter of bringing some of that experience here, for
&gt;example...

Its just absolutely shocking that people put up with as much as they do.  But
I'm still pretty certain that a system that worked like your car, with no
waiting, privacy, no stopping along the way, fast, etc. would immediately steal
all the passengers from any existent mass transit system.

I'd like to see _why_ they use public transport before saying that its all that
great an idea.  If its all they can afford, then it not something that would
work all that well here.  Here, the system has to be _better_, in terms of its
speed, to win the transport battle.  People won't fall all over themselves to
ride it _just_ to save $2 - $5 a day and spend an extra 30 minutes waiting on
the thing and, if the thing is packed, or they _really_ have an  affinity for
controlling their environment with respect to temperature, the music that is
played, or they want to be able to eat/smoke, they probably _still_ won't ride
it.

&gt;One of the biggest threats to sustainability is that for many countries
&gt;which are urbanising rapidly, for example India and China, a
&gt;Westernised style of city may be followed - meaning a city dominated
&gt;by cars and increasing 'edge' developments for housing and services.

&gt;The 'doughnut' model of an empty city centre and rapidly growing
&gt;fringe has led to efforts to curb such developments by many authorities
&gt;with the revitalisation of the city centre through prestigious retail
&gt;and leisure redevelopments on brownfield sites. Examples are La Defense
&gt;in Paris, West Quay in Southampton or Docklands in London.
