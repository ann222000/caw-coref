&quot;THOMAS CHURCHYARD.&quot; LoveToKnow 1911 Online Encyclopedia.

&lt;&lt;CHURCHYARD, THOMAS (c. 152o16o4), English author, was born at Shrewsbury
about 1520, the son of a farmer. He received a good education, and, having
speedily dissipated at court the money with which his father provided him,
he entered the household of Henry Howard, earl of Surrey. There he remained
for four years, learning something of the art of poetry from his patron;
some of the poems he contributed later (155~) to Songes and Sonetles may
well date from this early period. In 1541 he began his career as a soldier
of fortune, being, he said, pressedinto the service. He fought his way
through nearly everycampaign in Scotland and the Low Countries for thirty
years. He served under the emperor Charles V. in Flanders in 1542, returning
to England after the peace of Crpy (1544). In the Scottish campaign of 1547
he was present at the barren victory of Pinkie, and in the next year was
taken prisoner at Saint Monance, but aided by his persuasive tongue he
escaped to the English garrison at Lauder, where he was once more besieged,
only returning to England on the conclusion of peace in 1550. A broadside
entitled Davy Dycars Dreame, a short and seemingly alliterative poem in the
manner of Piers Plowman, brought him into trouble with the privy council,
but he was dismissed with a reprimand. This tract was the starting-point of
a controversy between Churchyard and a certain Thomas Camel. The whole of
the flyting was reprinted in I56o as The Contenlion betwixte Churchyard and
Camell.
In 1550 he went to Ireland to serve the lord deputy, Sir Anthony St Leger,
who had been sent to pacify the country. Here Churchyard enriched himself at
the expense, it is to be feared, of the unhappy Irish; but in 1552 he was in
England again, trying vainly to secure a fortune by marriage with a rich
widow. After this failure he departed once more to the wars to the siege of
Metz (1552), and trailed a pike in the emperors army, until he joined the
forces under William, Lord Grey of Wilton, with whom he says he served eight
years. Grey was in charge of the fortress of Gaines, which was besieged by
the duke of Guise in 1558. Churchyard arranged the terms of surrender, and
was sent with his chief to Paris as a prisoner. He was not released at the
peace of Cateau Cambrsis for lack of money to pay his ransom, but he was
finally set free on giving his bond for the amount, an engagement which he
repudiated as soon as he was safely in England. He is not to be identified
with the T. C. who wrote for the Mirror for Magistrates (ed. 1559), How the
Lord Mowbray . . . was banished . . . and after died miserablie in exile,
which is the work of Thomas Chaloner, but Shores Wife, his most popular
poem, appeared in the 1563 edition of the same work, and to that of 1587 he
contributed the Tragedie of Thomas Wolsey. These are plain manly
compositions in the seven-lined Chaucerian stanza. Repeated petitions to the
queen for assistance produced at first fair words, and then no answer at
all. He therefore returned to active service under Lord Grey, who was in
command of an English army sent (I 56o) to help the Scottish rebels, and in
1564 he served in Ireland under Sir Henry Sidney. The religious disturbances
in the Netherlands attracted him to Antwerp, where as the agent of William
of Orange he allowed the insurgents to place him at their head, and was able
to save much property from destruction. This action made him so hated by the
mob that he had to fly for his life in the disguise of a priest. In the next
year he was sent by the earl of Oxford to serve definitely under the prince
of Orange. After a years service he obtained leave to return to England, and
after many adventures and narrow escapes in a journey through hostile
territory he embarked for Guernsey, and thence for England. His patron, Lord
Oxford, disowned him, and the poet, whose health was failing, retired to
Bath. He appears to have made a very unhappy marriage at this time, and
returned to the Low Countries. Falling into the hands of the Spaniards he
was recognized as having had a hand in the Antwerp disturbance, and was
under sentence to be executed as a spy when he was saved by the intervention
of a noble lady. This experience did not deter him from joining in the
defence of Zutphen in 1572, but this was his last campaign, and the troubles
of the remaining years of his life were chiefly domestic.

Churchyard was employed to devise a pageant for the queens reception at
Bristol in 1574, and again at Norwich in 1578. He had published in 15l5 The
fi,rste parte of Churchyardes Chippes, the modest title which he gives to
his works. No second part appeared, but there was a much enlarged edition in
1578. A passage in Churchyardes Choise (1579) gave offence to Elizabeth, and
the author fled to Scotland, where he remained for three years. He was only
restored to favor about 1584, and in 1593 he received a small pension from
the queen. The affectionate esteem with which he was regarded by the younger
Elizabethan writers is expressed by Thomas Nashe, who says (Foure Letters
Confuted) that Churchyards aged muse might well be grandmother to our
grandiloquentest poets at this present. Francis Meres (Palladis Tamia, 1598)
mentions him in conjunction with many great names among the most passionate,
among us, to bewail and bemoan the perplexities of love. Spenser, in Cohn
Clouts come home again, calls him with a spice of raillery old Palaemon who
sung so long until quite hoarse he grew. His writings, with the exception of
his contributions to the Mirror for Magistrates, are chiefly
autobiographical in character or deal with the wars in which he had a share.
They are very rare, and have never been completely reprinted. Churchyard
lived right through Elizabeths reign, and was buried in St Margarets church,
Westminster, on the 4th of April 5604.

The extant works of Churchyard, exclusive of commendatory and occasional
verses, include :A lamentable and pisifull Description of the wofull warres
in Flanders (1578); A general rehearsall of warres, called Churchyards
Choise (1579), really a completion of the Chippes, and containing, like it,
a number of detached pieces; A light Bondel of livelie Discourses, called
Churchyardes Charge (1580); The Worthines of Wales (1587), a valuable
antiquarian work in prose and verse, anticipating Michael Drayton;
Churchyards Challenge (1593); A Musicall Consort of Heavenly harmonic - - -
called Churchyards Charitie (1595); A True Discourse Historicall, of the
succeeding Governors in the Netherlands (1602).

The chief authority for Churchyards biography is his own Tragicall Discourse
of the unhappy mans life (Churchyardes Chippes). George Chalmers published
(1817) a selection from his works relating to Scotland, for which he wrote a
useful life. See also an edition of the Chippes (ed. J. P. Collier, 1870),
of the Worthines of Wales (Spenser Soc. 1876), and a notice of Churchyard by
H. W. Adnitt (Transactions of the Shropshire Archaeological and Nat. Hist.
Soc., reprinted separately 1884).&gt;&gt;
