Folks,

What a day!   More folks showed-up than I have fingers so I didn't get a
count.   Lois and John showed-up with new bikes.  Within the first 30
seconds of getting the group together we lost a cyclist,  Michael, to the
Recovery group  (I hope he enjoyed riding with those Hammerheads).   Hal,
for the last two weeks, primed the Touring/Beginner cyclists  so that  now
14-16 mph just doesn't cut it.  Thank you Hal. To boot, the term
'Beginner'  came under fire so our name is evolving to &quot;Intro To Touring&quot;.
Finally, after the ride lead clearly stated that we were altering the
route and going down Carpenter Pond and turning on Coley,  the statement
was completely ignored  and we took the same old route.  Aghhh!

Ah, but sometimes even when things don't go according to plan they work
out for the best anyhow.  We couldn't have had a better day.  Traffic was
very light.    It seemed that everyone had a good time.

Cheers,

Mike Dalton

Mike,

Is this ride still available to riders who can only manage 14 mph?

It was quite an enjoyable day to say the least.  This weekend has some
quite attractive temps listed so far also.

HI Mike.  Thanks for a great ride.  Afterwards, you mentioned that
there was possibly another &quot;beginner/intro to touring&quot; group that
rides on other days beside Sunday.  If you could, I would appreciate
it if you could forward me the contact info.    Thanks.

Thanks to everyone.  You've all been so much help, you're all so
welcoming, and everybody has chipped in to give me advice to become
better, I appreciate it so much.  Special thanks to Hal and Mike who
have taught me loads.  Everything from riding position to drills to
become stronger and faster.  I really enjoy riding with the Gyros you
are all lots of fun and really helpful.  I hope to continue riding
with you through the winter and for years to come, and hope to rise
through the levels.
