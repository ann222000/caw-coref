Young fruit, half ripe, as yet unpicked, hangs turgid on the vine,
else fully grown in form, in flesh, it begs the eye to dine.
In flawless form, drawn round in bloom, within a velvet skin,
delights man's vision yet disguise, the edge tart juice within.
Does nature bring to her design, or is it man's decree,
that fruit thus taken 'fore its time; should ever poisoned be?

Though swollen full in juv'nile bloom and fervid cast the vine,
convention counts its days too few and thus forbids the wine.
Until its sweetness full is found and seed full formed within,
it bars us from its tender flesh with juices sharp as sin.
'Til nature hands her blessings down, and fertile calls her seed,
a serpent's tongue awaits the bold, who dare succumb their greed.

Picked from the bough before its fall can perfect form despoil,
calls still the lure of virgin fruit, untainted by the soil.
To have what man has never known, an av'riced eye may dare,
to know, possess, one perfect form, such bitter goads to bear.
For might some jot of acid sting, and thus the tongue excite,
or sickly jaded palates fire with that first acid bite?

But fertile, full, it must become, when nature calls its day,
and free to shed its tether then, shall honeyed 'fore us lay.
Made full in form and fecund so, its ageless guiles beseech,
to taste its flesh, made sweet with youth, brought coy within our
reach.
To take its bounty, at its time, its juices nectar sweet,
with nature's blessing, as its days, to uberance fall complete.

If nature bids then, stay our hand, 'til ripe she calls her fruit,
then nature's beat should be our gauge, not custom guide our suit.
Not he who owns, nor tends, the vine; nor he who breaks the soil,
but mother earth's eternal beat dictate her daughter's spoil.
Does nature task what age the grape, or hand that tends the cup,
or when its bounty, ripe, o'erflows, the lips that from it sup?

reformatted this poem into common measure, just to show you what it

Thank you. Some people have been offended, which is why I asked; they
think I'm tryng a rewrite. To make it clear that this isn't, i'm going
to give only the third and fourth stanzas.

I did a couple of other things I'd recommend you consider as well. As
I think you've got some strong initial words, I also added initial
caps. [Plus, I changed a few phrases, mostly to get rid of
contractions; they're indicated by square brackets.]

[...]

Picked from the bough before its fall
Can perfect form despoil,
Calls still the lure of virgin fruit,
Untainted by the soil.
To have what man has never known
A [greedy] eye may dare,
To know, possess, one perfect form
Such bitter goads to bear.
For might some jot of acid sting
And thus the tongue excite,
Or sickly jaded palates fire
With that first acid bite?

But fertile, full, it must become
When nature calls its day,
And free to shed its tether then,
Shall [ripe before] us lay.
Made full in form and fecund so,
Its ageless guiles beseech,
To taste its flesh, made sweet with youth
Brought coy within our reach.
To take its bounty, at its time,
Its juices nectar sweet,
With nature's blessing, as its days,
To uberance fall complete.

Yes, and George would shape it well.

I was not keen to plough through it-- a bit too condensed

Thanks, Hugh. Since Dennis doesn't believe in Looking It Up - he'd
rather Make It Up - I think I'll paste the quote in as well:

COMMON MEASURE
A meter consisting chiefly of seven iambic feet arranged in rhymed
pairs, thus a line with four accents followed by a line with three
accents, usually in a 4-line stanza. It is also called common meter.
[...]
Sidelight: While essentially the same as ballad meter, common measure
is more regularly iambic.

Say what? Supernatural fits that definition?

Actually, it's just the combination of two apparently contradictory or
incompatible words. Could be two adjectives, for example:

... the maple's cold and fiery shade ... (Nemerov)

Perhaps an adverb/adjective:

... the blank marble gaze brilliantly blind ... (Merrill)

Bzzzt! Wrong again. Wordsworth's R&amp;I was parodied in the

Shelley knew nothing about prosody? Well, you might successfully
argue that Keats couldn't tell the difference between Cortez and
Balboa, but to presume to know more about prosody than PBS?
Seems a bit megalomaniacal to me.

That is not to say there isn't a *wealth* of fascinating information to be
found there, because there is. Still, these and other uncorrected errors
have been repeatedly brought to the author's attention. (See definitions of
pun, irony, sarcasm, synecdoche for instance.)

Perhaps the glitch is in the word 'fourteener'. Didn't this
error arise earlier, when it was confused with any 14-line poem?

&gt; &gt;bounds itself, and has no &quot;outside.&quot;

&gt; Say what? Supernatural fits that definition?

&gt; Actually, it's just the combination of two apparently contradictory or
&gt; incompatible words. Could be two adjectives, for example:

&gt; ... the maple's cold and fiery shade ... (Nemerov)

&gt; Perhaps an adverb/adjective:

&gt; ... the blank marble gaze brilliantly blind ... (Merrill)

&gt; (Examples from Western Wind by J.F. Nims, Chapter 5.)

&gt; &gt;A.E. Housman defined poetry as &quot;the best words in
&gt; &gt;the best order.&quot;

&gt; Nuh-unh, not Housman, sorry (STC).

&gt; &gt;/parody/ The mimicking of the form, style, or content of
&gt; &gt;a (well-known) piece of literature, to say something else
&gt; &gt;entirely, or merely to make fun of the original. Carroll's
&gt; &gt;&quot;Father William&quot; is better-remembered than Wordsworth's
&gt; &gt;&quot;Resolution and Independence,&quot; which it parodies.

&gt; Bzzzt! Wrong again. Wordsworth's R&amp;I was parodied in the
&gt; 'aged aged man, a-sitting on a gate' ditty. Father William was really
&gt; from Robert Southey's 'The Old Man's Comforts and How He
&gt; Gained Them'. (According to Martin Gardner's Annotated Alice.)

&gt; &gt;The objection that prosody is &quot;merely decoration&quot; is
&gt; &gt;made by those who know nothing about it, reading those
&gt; &gt;who, like, say, Shelley, know nothing about it, either.

&gt; Shelley knew nothing about prosody? Well, you might successfully
&gt; argue that Keats couldn't tell the difference between Cortez and
&gt; Balboa, but to presume to know more about prosody than PBS?
&gt; Seems a bit megalomaniacal to me.

&gt; That is not to say there isn't a *wealth* of fascinating information to be
&gt; found there, because there is. Still, these and other uncorrected errors
&gt; have been repeatedly brought to the author's attention. (See definitions of
&gt; pun, irony, sarcasm, synecdoche for instance.)

&gt; Perhaps the glitch is in the word 'fourteener'. Didn't this
&gt; error arise earlier, when it was confused with any 14-line poem?

That's the first time I remember Dennis Hammes ever shutting up about

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Thanks, Hugh. Since Dennis doesn't believe in Looking It Up - he'd
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;rather Make It Up - I think I'll paste the quote in as well:

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;COMMON MEASURE
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;A meter consisting chiefly of seven iambic feet arranged in rhymed
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;pairs, thus a line with four accents followed by a line with three
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;accents, usually in a 4-line stanza. It is also called common meter.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;[...]
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Sidelight: While essentially the same as ballad meter, common measure
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;is more regularly iambic.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; http://www.poeticbyway.com/gl-c.html#common_measure

&gt;&gt;&gt;It's nice to see babies entertaining each other with all their
&gt;&gt;&gt;fondling and *agreeing*, but if you meant &quot;common meter,&quot; q.v., you
&gt;&gt;&gt;shoulda put &quot;common meter.&quot;  Or even &quot;ballad meter,&quot; which is the
&gt;&gt;&gt;current and preferred term for the last couple centuries.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Poor Georgie has a Thing about Being Authoritative by using the
&gt;&gt;&gt;Oldest Word (that generally happens when babies reach a certain
&gt;&gt;&gt;Stage, you know; it kept the Mass in Latin for 1600 years, e.g.), a
&gt;&gt;&gt;rule that's gonna blow him out of the water here and elsewhere.

&gt;&gt;&gt;My hotmetal's older'n your hotmetal, and &quot;common measure&quot; is a
&gt;&gt;&gt;measure of /music/, children, though I admit /lots/ of fourteeners
&gt;&gt;&gt;are sung in it...

Ah, Nims (not to mention Nemerov), one of the reasons that the modern
-- or would that be &quot;postmodern&quot; -- student can't write and believes
firmly that he doesn't hafta learn how because his Wind flies a
Higher Plane.  But he'll pretend that the student /can/ write, so the
students LUUUve him.
Called the &quot;Laureate Syndrome,&quot; and what the hell else is a priest
for?
Those are not &quot;oxymorons,&quot; they are &quot;encrapulations,&quot; aka
&quot;diaphors,&quot; the random cramming of any damn two words together in a
vain attempt to sound &quot;novel.&quot;  I'd compare it to a windup
cymbal-monkey save that the monkey manages to maintain a rhythm.

However, &quot;brilliantly blind&quot; (if not already robbed of all attention
by the originally trite and subsequently hackneyed &quot;blank marble
gaze&quot;) may be construed as attempting to force the reader to a
further approximation of both briliance and blindness but esp. in
combination, where &quot;brilliance&quot; arrives not through the eye but in a
manner best expounded by our very own fulminant moron, George Dance.
It were novel save that Homer and Milton are both asserted to have
done it for the bulk of their professional lives.

Housman, somewhere, god only knows any more.  One of his essays on
the craft and/or attitude of poetry.  Q.v.; there aren't that many.
And yes, he was quoting Coleridge, to which he rebutted what may
be an even more famous dictum, that poetry was less a matter of
finding the right words than getting rid of the wrong ones.

Anybody who hasta (or does because he's lazy) bend grammar so
routinely to achieve scansion &quot;doesn't know anything about prosody.&quot;
Or maybe it's more fundamental than that.  Maybe when he got rid
of the wrong words, he didn't have anything left.
Then there's the matter of voice, at which Shelley is nowhere near
an Eliot, a Housman, or even a Coleridge.  Okay, so he liked to gush,
but then so did Barrett, whose sonnets he isn't up to, either.

&quot;Fourteener&quot; has sported both definitions, yes.
E.g., we'd do George an inestimable kindness simply to refer to
his attempts at sonnets as &quot;fourteeners,&quot; because then they'd
actually be something identifiable.
