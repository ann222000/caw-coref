I recently purchased an item with a $1 manufacturer's coupon. I ended up
returning the item, but the store deducted the coupon from the refunded
price. Is this right? Isn't the store then making an extra $1 on the item
since the manufacturer reimburses them for the coupon?

What is the correct way that retailers should refund an item purchased with
a coupon?

TIA

account for the refund on a coupon sale.

"/> The correct way is to undo the transaction: you give them back the
item you got, and they give you back the money and coupon they got.

If they can't return the coupon, then you're correct that they
should return its value to you -- the consumer amount, not including
the handling fee that the manufacturer pays them.

Unfortunately, this is one of those situations where enforcing your
legal rights would cost many times the value of those rights. Much
better to try to get a manager to agree with you.

Seems ok to me.
Lets say you buy something that costs $10. But only pay $9 because you
have a $1 coupon.
Now you return this. Do you get back $10 or $9?
You are getting back what you actually paid for it, not what it
originally cost.

If the reason is that the item was defective or otherwise unfit for

reasonable damages (e.g. a voucher or replacement cost reimbursement for an
equivalent item that does work.)

If the reason is that you just don't want it anymore, they owe you nothing

buying a used product back from you, sell it to someone else.

The OP paid _two_ things, $9 cash and a coupon that gave the right

As a matter of law, he's not entitled to the extra $1 in cash, but
to the $1 coupon. If the store can't return it to him -- which it
probably can't -- then the next best thing is to give him the $1.

People have raised the red herring of &quot;schemes to convert coupons to
cash.&quot; It staggers the imagination to think anybody would go to this
much trouble to convert _one_ coupon for _one_ dollar to cash. As
far as we've been told, if I remember rightly, the return was made
based on malfunction or misrepresentation of the item.

As an aside, the value of coupons has certainly dropped. They used to be
worth a mill, then 1/20th of a cent. I would have thought inflation alone
would have been enough devaluation of the coupon. Guess not...

If, for example, the coupon was for $1 off any CD-ROM published by
Walnut Creek, it's possible for the customer to buy a different
CD-ROM, one which does not have the same problem (say, not being
compatible with the customer's OS) as the one being returned.

I suspect the store would let you keep the value of the coupon if
you did an EXCHANGE, and the coupon was valid on both the goods you
are returning and the replacement goods. It seems to me I did this
once with a 20% off coupon, and I also ended up getting 20% off on
the difference between the new (slightly more expensive) item and
the returned one, so I ended up with exactly what I would have had
if I had just bought the new item with the coupon.

"/> Off the top of my head, several reasons why someone might return a
product and go back to the store and buy the same item later:

a) It was bought for a particular event, ended up not being used at
that event, but the buyer might need it later at a similar event, and
does not wish to store it / does not have space to store it / does not
wish for the money to remain invested in it / it is perishable and
does not want it to spoil before then.

b) The particular unit being returned is defective, and the buyer turns
out to no longer need a non-defective unit immediately (e.g., because
the need for it passed after the buyer discovered it was defective) but
may need it at some point in the future.

c) The buyer will not need to buy the same item again, but someone he
knows might; just as the coupon he used was transferable, the voucher
given to him by the store would and should be transferable as well.

That may be the way to completely &quot;undo the transaction&quot; but it
seems like insisting that the coupon be returned is silly. You
returned the product because you didn't want it. Why should you
want the coupon back when you have no intention of using it again?

coupon. If the item is returned, the merchant still collects the face value

Merchants are required to show proof that they've purchased
(not sold) sufficient quantity of the product. Considering
the cost of taking and refunding your money, I don't think
the store is going to make a great profit on your coupon.
