Women with increased levels of anxiety and nervous tension often need to
develop more effective ways of dealing with day to day stresses the minor
everyday pressures that women with a healthy emotional balance handle easily
but that can be overwhelming for women whose anxiety responses are easily
triggered. Such stress can include riding in an elevator, being in crowds,
going to the dentist, or any situation, place, or person that sparks a
woman's emotional charge. Often these charged issues evoke anxiety, fear, or
upset feelings. Moreover, significant lifestyle changes death of a loved
one, divorce, job loss, financial problems, major changes in personal
relationships can be almost impossible to handle when a woman is already
feeling anxious and tense. Being unable to cope with stress effectively can
also damage a woman's self esteem and self confidence. A woman with anxiety
episodes may feel a decreasing sense of self-worth as her ability to handle
her usual range of activities diminishes. Life stresses themselves don't
necessarily change, so how a woman copes with them can really make the
difference.
*How Stress Affects the Body*
Your emotional and physical reactions to stress are partly determined by the
sensitivity of your sympathetic nervous system. This system produces the
fight or flight reaction in response to stress and excitement, speeding up
and heightening the pulse rate, respiration, muscle tension, glandular
function, and circulation of the blood. If you have recurrent anxiety
symptoms, either major or minor lifestyle and emotional upsets may cause an
overreaction of your sympathetic system. If you have an especially stressful
life, your sympathetic nervous system may always be poised to react to a
crisis, putting you in a state of constant tension. In this mode, you tend
to react to small stresses the same way you would react to real emergencies.
The energy that accumulates in the body to meet this "emergency" must be
discharged in order to bring your body back into balance. Repeated episodes
of the fight or flight reaction deplete your energy reserves and, if they
continue, cause a downward spiral that can lead to emotional burnout and
eventually complete exhaustion. You can break this spiral only by learning
to manage stress in a way that protects and even increases your energy
level.
*Techniques for Relaxation*
Many patients have asked me about techniques for coping more effectively
with stress. Although I send some women for counseling or psychotherapy when
symptoms are severe, most are looking for practical ways to manage stress on
their own. They want to take responsibility for handling their own problems
observing their inadequate methods of dealing with stress, learning new
techniques to improve their habits, and then practicing these techniques on
a regular basis.

I have included relaxation and stress reduction exercises in many of my
patient programs. The feedback has been very positive; many patients report
an increased sense of well being from these self help techniques. They also
note an improvement in their physical health. This chapter includes fourteen
stress reduction exercises for women with anxiety. They will take you
through a series of specific steps to help alleviate your symptoms. The
exercises will teach you the following helpful techniques: focusing and
meditation, grounding techniques (how to feel more centered), exercises that
help you to relax and release muscle tension, erasure techniques (how to
erase old programs), healing the inner child, visualizations, and
affirmations. These techniques will help you cope with stress more
efficiently, make your thoughts more calm and peaceful, and help you learn
to relax, while you build self esteem and self confidence. Try them all;
then decide which ones produce the greatest benefits for you. Practice these
on a regular basis.
*Quieting the Mind and Body*
Women with recurring symptoms of anxiety and nervous tension are usually
barraged by a constant stream of negative "self-talk." Throughout the day
your conscious mind may be inundated with thoughts, feelings, and fantasies
that trigger feelings of upset. Many of these thoughts replay unresolved
issues of health, finances, or personal and work relationships. This
relentless mental replay of unresolved issues can reinforce the anxiety
symptoms and be exhausting. It is important to know how to shut off the
constant inner dialogue and quiet the mind.
The first two exercises require you to sit quietly and engage in a simple
repetitive activity. By emptying your mind, you give yourself a rest.
Meditation allows you to create a state of deep relaxation, which is very
healing to the entire body. Metabolism slows, as do physiological functions
such as heart rate and blood pressure. Muscle tension decreases. Brain wave
patterns shift from the fast beta waves that occur during a normal active
day to the slower alpha waves, which appear just before falling asleep or in
times of deep relaxation. If you practice these exercises regularly, they
can help relieve anxiety by resting your mind and turning off upsetting
thoughts.
*Exercise 1: Focusing
*Select a small personal object that you like a great deal. It might be a
jeweled pin or a simple flower from your garden. Focus all your attention on
this object as you inhale and exhale slowly and deeply for one to two
minutes. While you are doing this exercise, try not to let any other
thoughts or feelings enter your mind. If they do, just return your attention
to the object. At the end of this exercise you will probably feel more
peaceful and calmer. Any tension or nervousness that you were feeling upon
starting the exercise should be diminished.
*Exercise 2: Meditation*

Sit or lie in a comfortable position.
Close your eyes and breathe deeply. Let your breathing be slow and relaxed.
Focus all your attention on your breathing. Notice the movement of your
chest and abdomen in and out.
Block out all other thoughts, feelings, and sensations. If you feel your
attention wandering, bring it back to your breathing.
As you inhale, say the word "peace" to yourself, and as you exhale, say the
word "calm." Draw out the pronunciation of the word so that it lasts for the
entire breath. The word "peace" sounds like p-e-e-a-a-a- c-c-c-e-e- e. The
word "calm" sounds like: c-a-a-a-l-l- l-l-m-m-m. Repeating these words as
you breathe will help you to concentrate.
Continue this exercise until you feel very relaxed.
Grounding Techniques
Many women suffering from anxiety episodes often feel ungrounded and
disorganized. There is a pervasive sense of "things falling apart." When
anxiety episodes occur, it often takes a concentrated effort just to get
through the day, accomplishing such basic daily tasks as cooking,
housecleaning, taking care of children, or getting to work or school. The
next two exercises teach you grounding techniques that will help you feel
more centered and focused. Practicing either of these exercises will allow
you to organize your energies and proceed more effectively with your daily
routine.
*Exercise 3: Oak Tree Meditation
*
Sit in a comfortable position, your arms resting at your sides.
Close your eyes and breathe deeply. Let your breathing be slow and relaxed.
See your body as a strong oak tree. Your body is solid like the wide, brown
trunk of the tree. Imagine sturdy roots growing from your legs and going
down deeply into the earth, anchoring your body. You feel solid and strong,
able to handle any stress.
When upsetting thoughts or situations occur, visualize your body remaining
grounded like the oak tree. Feel the strength and stability in your arms and
legs.
You feel confident and relaxed, able to handle any situation.
*Exercise 4: Grounding Cord Meditation
*
Sit in a comfortable position, your arms resting comfortably at your sides.
Close your eyes and breathe deeply. Let your breathing be slow and relaxed.
Imagine a thick wide cord attaching itself to the base of your spine. This
is your grounding cord. It can be a thick piece of rope, a tree trunk, or
any other material that feels strong and stable. Make sure your cord is wide
and sturdy enough. Then imagine a thick metal hook attaching itself to the
end of your cord.
Now visualize your grounding cord dropping down two hundred feet below the
earth and hooking on to the solid bedrock below the earth.
Continue to breathe deeply and notice the sense of peace and stability that
your grounding cord can bring you.
Replace the cord with a new one each day or whenever you feel your emotions
getting out of control.
Releasing Muscle Tension
The next three exercises will help you get in touch with your areas of
muscle tension and then help you learn to release this tension. This is an
important sequence for women with emotional symptoms of anxiety and nervous
tension since habitual emotional patterns cause certain muscle groups to
tense and tighten. For example, if a person has difficulty in expressing
feelings, the neck muscles may be chronically tense. A person with a lot of
repressed anger may have chest pain and tight chest muscles. Contracted
muscles limit movement and energy flow in the body, since they tend to have
decreased blood circulation and oxygenation and accumulate an excess of
waste products, such as carbon dioxide and lactic acid. Therefore, muscle
tension can be a significant cause of the fatigue that often accompanies
chronic stress. The following exercises help release tension and the blocked
emotions held in tight muscles.
*Exercise 5: Discovering Muscle Tension
*
Lie on your back in a comfortable position. Allow your arms to rest at your
sides, palms down, on the surface next to you.
Raise just the right hand and arm and hold it elevated for 15 seconds.
Notice if your forearm feels tight and tense or if the muscles are soft and
pliable.
Let your hand and arm drop down and relax. The arm muscles will relax too.
As you lie still, notice any other parts of your body that feel tense,
muscles that feel tight and sore. You may notice a constant dull aching in
certain muscles.
*Exercise 6: Progressive Muscle Relaxation
*
Lie on your back in a comfortable position. Allow your arms to rest at your
sides, palms down, on the surface next to you.
Inhale and exhale slowly and deeply.
Clench your hands into fists and hold them tightly for 15 seconds. As you do
this, relax the rest of your body. Visualize your fists contracting,
becoming tighter and tighter.
Then let your hands relax. On relaxing, see a golden light flowing into the
entire body, making all your muscles soft and pliable.
Now, tense and relax the following parts of your body in this order: face,
shoulders, back, stomach, pelvis, legs, feet, and toes. Hold each part
tensed for 15 seconds and then relax your body for 30 seconds before going
on to the next part.
Finish the exercise by shaking your hands and imagining the remaining
tension flowing out of your fingertips.
*Exercise 7: Release of Muscle Tension and Anxiety*

Lie in a comfortable position. Allow your arms to rest at your sides, palms
down. Inhale and exhale slowly and deeply with your eyes closed.
Become aware of your feet, ankles, and legs. Notice if these parts of your
body have any muscle tension or tightness. If so, how does the tense part of
your body feel? Is it viselike, knotted, cold, numb? Do you notice any
strong feelings, such as hurt, upset, or anger, in that part of your body?
Breathe into that part of your body until you feel it relax. Release any
anxious feelings with your breathing, continuing until they begin to
decrease in intensity and fade.
Next, move your awareness into your hips, pelvis, and lower back. Note any
tension there. Notice any anxious feelings located in that part of your
body. Breathe into your hips and pelvis until you feel them relax. Release
any negative emotions as you breathe in and out
Focus on your abdomen and chest. Notice any anxious feelings located in this
area and let them drop away as you breathe in and out. Continue to release
any upsetting feelings located in your abdomen or chest.
Finally, focus on your head, neck, arms, and hands. Note any tension in this
area and release it. With your breathing; release any negative feelings
blocked in this area until you can't feel them anymore.
When you have finished releasing tension throughout the body, continue deep
breathing and relaxing for another minute or two. At the end of this
exercise, you should feel lighter and more energized.
Erasing Stress and Tension
Often the situations and beliefs that make us feel anxious and tense look
large and insurmountable. We tend to form representations in our mind that
empower stress. In these representations, we look tiny and helpless, while
the stressors look huge and unsolvable. You can change these mental
representations and cut stressors down to size. The next two exercises will
help you to gain mastery over stress by learning to shrink it or even erase
it with your mind. This places stress in a much more manageable and
realistic perspective. These two exercises will also help engender a sense
of power and mastery, thereby reducing anxiety and restoring a sense of
calm.
*Exercise 8: Shrinking Stress
*
Sit or lie in a comfortable position. Breathe slowly and deeply.
Visualize a situation, person, or even a belief (such as, "I'm afraid of the
dark" or "I don't want to give that public speech") that makes you feel
anxious and tense.
As you do this, you might see a person's face, a place you're afraid to go,
or simply a dark cloud. Where do you see this stressful picture? Is it above
you, to one side, or in front of you? How does it look? Is it big or little,
dark or light? Does it have certain colors?
Now slowly begin to shrink the stressful picture. Continue to see the
stressful picture shrinking until it is so small that it can literally be
held in the palm of your hand. Hold your hand out in front of you, and place
the picture in the palm of your hand.
If the stressor has a characteristic sound (like a voice or traffic noise),
hear it getting tiny and soft. As it continues to shrink, its voice or
sounds become almost inaudible.
Now the stressful picture is so small it can fit on your second finger.
Watch it shrink from there until it finally turns into a little dot and
disappears.
Often this exercise causes feelings of amusement, as well as relaxation, as
the feared stressor shrinks, gets less intimidating, and finally disappears.

*Exercise 9: Erasing Stress*

Sit or lie in a comfortable position. Breathe slowly and deeply.
Visualize a situation, a person, or even a belief (such as, "I'm afraid to
go to the shopping mall" or "I'm scared to mix with other people at
parties") that causes you to feel anxious and fearful.
As you do this you might see a specific person, an actual place, or simply
shapes and colors. Where do you see this stressful picture? Is it below you,
to the side, in front of you? How does it look? Is it big or little, dark or
light, or does it have a specific color?
Imagine that a large eraser, like the kind used to erase chalk marks, has
just floated into your hand. Actually feel and see the eraser in your hand.
Take the eraser and begin to rub it over the area where the stressful
picture is located. As the eraser rubs out the stressful picture it fades,
shrinks, and finally disappears. When you can no longer see the stressful
picture, simply continue to focus on your deep breathing for another minute,
inhaling and exhaling slowly and deeply.
Healing the Inner Child
Many of our anxieties and fears come from our inner child rather than our
adult self. Sometimes it is difficult to realize that the emotional upsets
we feel are actually feelings left over from childhood fears, traumas, and
experiences. When unhealed, they remain with us into adulthood, causing
emotional distress over issues that competent "grown up" people feel they
should be able to handle. For example, fear of the dark, fear of being
unlovable, and fear of rejection often originate in early dysfunctional or
unhappy experiences with our parents and siblings. While many of these deep,
unresolved emotional issues may require counseling, particularly if they are
causing anxiety episodes, there is much that we can do for ourselves to heal
childhood wounds. The next exercise helps you to get in touch with your own
inner child and facilitates the healing process.
*Exercise 10: Healing the Inner Child*

Sit or lie in a comfortable position. Breathe slowly and deeply.
Begin to get in touch with where your inner child resides. Is she located in
your abdomen, in your chest, or by your side? (This may actually be the part
of your body where you feel the most fear and anxiety, such as your chest or
your pelvis.) How old is she? Can you see what clothes she is wearing? What
are her emotions? Is she upset, anxious, sad, or angry? Is she withdrawn and
quiet?
Begin to see her upset feelings flow out of her body and into a container on
the floor. Watch the upset feelings wash out of every part of her body until
they are all gone and the container is full. Then seal the container and
slowly watch it fade and dissolve until it disappears completely, carrying
all the upset feelings with it.
Now begin to fill your inner child with a peaceful, healing, golden light.
Watch her become peaceful and mellow as the light fills every cell in her
body. Watch her body relax. Give her a toy animal or a doll or even cuddle
her in your arms.
As you leave your inner child feeling peaceful, return your focus to your
breathing. Spend a minute inhaling and exhaling deeply and slowly. If you
like working with your inner child, return to visit her often!
Visualization
The next two exercises use visualization as a therapeutic method to affect
the physical and mental processes of the body; both focus on color. Color
therapy, as it applies to human health, has a long and distinguished
history. In many studies, scientists have exposed subjects to specific
colors, either directly through exposure to light therapy, or through
changing the color of their environment. Scientific research throughout the
world has shown that color therapy can have a profound effect on health and
well-being. It can stimulate the endocrine glands, the immune system, and
the nervous system, and help to balance the emotions. Visualizing color in a
specific part of the body can have a powerful therapeutic effect, too, and
can be a good stress management technique for relief of anxiety and nervous
tension.
The first exercise uses the color blue, which provides a calming and
relaxing effect. For women with anxiety who are carrying a lot of physical
and emotional tension, blue lessens the fight or flight response. Blue also
calms such physiological functions as pulse rate, breathing, and
perspiration, and relaxes the mood. If you experience chronic fatigue and
are tense, anxious, or irritable, or carry a lot of muscle tension, the
first exercise will be very helpful.
The second exercise uses the color red, which can benefit women who have
fatigue due to chronic anxiety and upset. Red stimulates all the endocrine
glands, including the pituitary and adrenal glands. It heightens senses such
as smell and taste. Emotionally, red is linked to vitality and high energy
states. Even though the color red can speed up autonomic nervous system
function, women with anxiety-related fatigue can benefit from visualizing
this color. I often do the red visualization when I am tired and need a pick
me up. You may find that you are attracted to the color in one exercise more
than another. Use the exercise with the color that appeals to you the most.
*Exercise 11: Tension Release Through Color*

Sit or lie in a comfortable position, your arms resting at your sides. As
you take a deep breath, visualize that the earth below you is filled with
the color blue. This blue color extends 50 feet below you into the earth.
Now imagine that you are opening up energy centers on the bottom of your
feet. As you inhale, visualize the soft blue color filling up your feet.
When your feet are completely filled with the color blue, then bring the
color up through your ankles, legs, pelvis, and lower back.
Each time you exhale, see the blue color leaving through your lungs,
carrying any tension and stress with it. See the tension dissolve into the
air.
Continue to inhale blue into your abdomen, chest, shoulders, arms, neck, and
head. Exhale the blue slowly out of your lungs. Repeat this entire process
five times and then relax for a few minutes.
*Exercise 12: Energizing Through Color
*
Sit or lie in a comfortable position, your arms resting easily at your
sides. As you take a deep breath, visualize a big balloon above your head
filled with a bright red healing energy. Imagine that you pop this balloon
so all the bright red energy is released.
As you inhale, see the bright red color filling up your head. It fills up
your brain, your face, and the bones of your skull. Let the bright red color
pour in until your head is ready to overflow with color. Then let the red
color flow into your neck, shoulders, arms, and chest. As you exhale,
breathe the red color out of your lungs, taking any tiredness and fatigue
with it. Breathe any feeling of fatigue out of your body.
As you inhale, continue to bring the bright, energizing red color into your
abdomen, pelvis, lower back, legs, and feet until your whole body is filled
with red. Exhale the red color out of your lungs, continuing to release any
feeling of fatigue. Repeat this process five times. At the end of this
exercise, you should feel more energized and vibrant. Your mental energy
should feel more vitalized and clear.
Affirmations
The following two exercises give you healthful affirmations that are very
useful for women with anxiety. As described earlier, anxiety symptoms are
due to a complex interplay between the mind and body. Your state of
emotional and physical health is determined in part by the thousands of
mental messages you send yourself each day with your thoughts. For example,
if fear of public places triggers your anxiety symptoms, the mind will send
a constant stream of messages to you reinforcing your beliefs about the
dangers and mishaps that can occur in public places. The fright triggers
muscle tension and shallow breathing. Similarly, if you constantly criticize
the way you look, your lack of self-love may be reflected in your body. For
example, your shoulders will slump and you may have a dull and lackluster
countenance.
Affirmations provide a method to change these negative belief systems to
thoughts that preserve peace and calm. Positive statements replace the
anxiety inducing messages with thoughts that make you feel good.
The first affirmation exercise gives you a series of statements to promote a
sense of emotional and physical health and well being. Using these
affirmations may create a feeling of emotional peace by changing your
negative beliefs about your body and health into positive beliefs. The
second affirmation exercise helps promote self-esteem and self-confidence
and also helps to reduce anxiety. Many women with high anxiety lose their
self-confidence and feel depressed and defeated by their condition. They
feel frustrated and somehow at fault for not finding a solution. Repeat each
affirmation to yourself or say them out loud 3 to 5 minutes. Use either or
both exercises on a regular basis to promote healthful, positive thought
patterns.
*Exercise 13: Positive Mind/Body Affirmations
*
I handle stress and tension appropriately and effectively.

My mood is calm and relaxed.

I can cope well and get on with my life during times of stress.

I think thoughts that uplift and nurture me.

More Stress-Reduction Techniques for Anxiety
The rest of this chapter contains additional techniques useful for relief of
anxiety and relaxation of tight and tense muscles. These methods induce deep
emotional relaxation. Try them for a delightful experience.
Hydrotherapy
For centuries, people have used warm water as a way to calm moods and relax
muscles. You can have your own "spa" at home by adding relaxing ingredients
to the bath water. I have found the following formula to be extremely useful
in relieving muscle pain and tension.
Alkaline Bath. Run a tub of warm water. Heat will increase your menstrual
flow, so keep the water a little cooler if heavy flow is a problem. Add one
cup of sea salt and one cup of bicarbonate of soda to the tub. This is a
highly alkaline mixture and I recommend using it only once or twice a month.
I've found it very helpful in reducing cramps and calming anxiety and
irritability. Soak for 20 minutes. You will probably feel very relaxed and
sleepy after this bath; use it at night before going to sleep. You will
probably wake up feeling refreshed and energized the following day. Heat of
any kind helps to release muscle tension. Many women find that saunas and
baths also help to calm their moods.
Sound
Music can have a tremendously relaxing effect on our minds and bodies. For
women with anxiety and nervous tension, I recommend slow, quiet music
classical music is particularly good. This type of music can have a
pronounced beneficial effect on your physiological functions. It can slow
your pulse and heart rate, lower your blood pressure, and decrease your
levels of stress hormones. It promotes peace and relaxation and helps to
induce sleep. Nature sounds, such as ocean waves and rainfall, can also
induce a sense of peace and relaxation. I have patients who keep tapes of
nature sounds in their cars and at home for use when they feel more
stressed. Play relaxing music often when you are aware of increased
emotional and physical tension.
Massage
Massage can be extremely therapeutic for women who feel anxious. Gentle
touching either by a trained massage therapist, your relationship partner,
or even yourself can be very relaxing. Tension usually fades away relatively
quickly with gentle, relaxed touching. The kneading and stroking movement of
a good massage relaxes tight muscles and improves circulation. If you can
afford to do so, I recommend treating yourself to a professional massage
during times of stress. Otherwise, trade with a friend or partner. There are
also many books available that instruct people how to massage themselves.
Putting Your Stress-Reduction Program Together
This chapter has introduced you to many different ways to reduce anxiety and
stress and make each day calm and peaceful. Try each exercise at least once.
Then find the combination that works for you. Doing the exercise you most
enjoy should take no longer than 20 to 30 minutes, depending on how much
time you wish to spend. Ideally, you should do the exercises daily. Over
time, they will help you gain insight into your negative feelings and
beliefs while changing them into positive, self nurturing new ones. Your
ability to cope with stress should improve tremendously
