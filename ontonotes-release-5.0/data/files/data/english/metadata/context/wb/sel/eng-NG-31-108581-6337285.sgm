Hi,

My father, 65 years old, has a hepatocellular carcinoma that was
detected on September 2006. One month ago his doctor cancelled the
gemcitabin treatment because after ending the first cycle of the drug
the numbers weren't good as the doctor expected. Since that time he is
at home, tired, weak, with little or nothing of hunger.

By the time is was doing his gemcitabin treatment it was detected a
vein cava trombo so he has been taking Sintrom 4mg in order to
normalize his INR. His numbers has been:

06/Jan/02 INR 1,35 (dose 14)
06/Jan/31 INR 3 (dose 15,5)
06/Feb/28 INR 21,86

The laboratory specialist suspended today the dosage of Sintrom, He
has next control on March 7th.

This INR is too high. Don't know if his liver is working worse that
ever or if the Sintrom has been some incidence on that.  He has not
had bleeding, just a little gum bleeding over these last 10 days.

Why the INR number is soo high? Is it normal at this stage of his
cancer? We just want to give him the best that we could do.

Thank you,
Luis.

Luis, your father;s metabolism is out of whack because of the cancer,
so the way he metabolizes drugs is going to be different from healthy
people.  Don't worry about the high INR, that can be controlled with
proper monitoring and consistent adjustment of medication dosage.
Hope this helps.
