993 Tail Stuck

Hi All,

Searched google and found no helpful posts. Hopefully someone here can help.

Got a 97 993 C4 Cab. The tail is stuck in the up position. It does not go
down automaically, and the switch on the console has no effect.

I checked the fuse in the front and it is good with good power on both sides
of it. I checked the connector to the motor on the tail and it has no
voltage, even when the switch is activated. So, somewhere in between the
fuse and the motor something has gone bad.

I've looked online and could not find a wiring diagram anywhere. Does anyone
know what controls the tail and where it is located? I assume there is a
relay or some electronic module inline between the switch and the motor, but
I have no way to confirm this.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,
-roy-

I have the service manuals here, if no one else answers, bug me tomorrow and
I'll maybe have time to look it up for you.

Well, nobody else has offered to help out. I would greatly appreciate it if
you would look into this for me. Please email me at nos ... @cademo.com.

And, yes, that is a legitimate email address. :)

you want sheet 8 of the schematic - it doesn't tell you where the control
unit is exactly,but ...
ther is a brown wire from the motor that is grounded and a yellow/green wire
that goes to a connector "X24" pin 4, thence to pin 4 of the "control unit
rear spoiler".  Fuse 37 applies power to pin 6 of this unit.  There is a set
of signals from the "central  informer" and a pair of microswitches one for
"reetracted" one for "extended".  These switches are NO, and grounded via
brown wires.  Green/black, via pin 6 goes to pin 10 of the control unit,
extended is green/red via pin 7 to pin 8 of the control unit.  Both of these
are in parallel with the switch in the pass compartment for
raising/lowering.  The harness for the control unit is marked on the
schematic WL Passenger comp.

Connector X24 is a 10 pin connector "connection WL passenger compartment
WL Tailgate, at position 16CL, "box RH side of engine compartment

Sheet 16 says "control unit rear spoiler is at locaiton 7cm, on RH side of
transverse wall which places it on the right side of the firewall at about
the height of th etop of the wheel, aprox even with the top of the RH groove
in the hood

hope this helps

What made it stuck was interesting....

There were 2 rubber bolt head/nut covers floating around in the plastic
housing. One of them got stuck between the down-limit switch leaf and the
housing. The tail was in the up position, thus the controller saw both
switches closed. In other words, it thought the tail was up and down at the
same time, and therefore did not allow it to move. Removing the rubber nut
cover released the switch and the motor resumed normal operation.

The bizarre thing is that for the life of me I couldn't figure out where
they came from. There was only one bolt head that they fit under there, but
there were 2 covers. My simple solution was to just remove both, but I'm
curios where they are suppose to go.

Anyway, it works now and I'm glad I didn't have to pay the dealer the big
$$$ to change the controller.

&gt;&gt; Turned out to be a stuck microswitch.

&gt;&gt; Thanks for all your help!

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; you want sheet 8 of the schematic - it doesn't tell you where the
&gt; control
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; unit is exactly,but ...
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; ther is a brown wire from the motor that is grounded and a
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; yellow/green
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; wire
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; that goes to a connector &quot;X24&quot; pin 4, thence to pin 4 of the &quot;control
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; unit
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; rear spoiler&quot;.  Fuse 37 applies power to pin 6 of this unit.  There is
&gt; a
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; set
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; of signals from the &quot;central  informer&quot; and a pair of microswitches
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; one
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; for
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;reetracted&quot; one for &quot;extended&quot;.  These switches are NO, and grounded
&gt; via
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; brown wires.  Green/black, via pin 6 goes to pin 10 of the control
&gt; unit,
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; extended is green/red via pin 7 to pin 8 of the control unit.  Both of
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; these
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; are in parallel with the switch in the pass compartment for
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; raising/lowering.  The harness for the control unit is marked on the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; schematic WL Passenger comp.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Connector X24 is a 10 pin connector &quot;connection WL passenger
&gt; compartment
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; WL Tailgate, at position 16CL, &quot;box RH side of engine compartment

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Sheet 16 says &quot;control unit rear spoiler is at locaiton 7cm, on RH
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; side
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; of
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; transverse wall which places it on the right side of the firewall at
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; about
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the height of th etop of the wheel, aprox even with the top of the RH
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; groove
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; in the hood

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; hope this helps

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Well, nobody else has offered to help out. I would greatly appreciate
&gt; it
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; if
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; you would look into this for me. Please email me at
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; nos ... @cademo.com.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; And, yes, that is a legitimate email address. :)

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Thanks,

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;I have the service manuals here, if no one else answers, bug me
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;tomorrow
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;and
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; I'll maybe have time to look it up for you.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Hi All,

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Searched google and found no helpful posts. Hopefully someone here
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; can
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; help.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Got a 97 993 C4 Cab. The tail is stuck in the up position. It does
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; not
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; go
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; down automaically, and the switch on the console has no effect.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I checked the fuse in the front and it is good with good power on
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; both
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; sides
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; of it. I checked the connector to the motor on the tail and it has
&gt; no
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; voltage, even when the switch is activated. So, somewhere in
&gt; between
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; fuse and the motor something has gone bad.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I've looked online and could not find a wiring diagram anywhere.
&gt; Does
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; anyone
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; know what controls the tail and where it is located? I assume
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; there
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; is
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; a
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; relay or some electronic module inline between the switch and the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; motor,
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; but
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I have no way to confirm this.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Any help would be greatly appreciated.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Thanks,
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; -roy-
