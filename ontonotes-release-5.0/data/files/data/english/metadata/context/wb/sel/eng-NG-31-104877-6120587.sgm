Leonardo was born in Anchiano, near Vinci, Italy. He was an
illegitimate child. His father, Ser Piero da Vinci was a young lawyer
and his mother, Caterina, was probably a peasant girl. It has also
been suggested, albeit on scanty evidence, that she was a Middle
Eastern slave owned by Piero. However, the latter theory is unlikely
to be true.
.
As he was born before modern naming conventions developed in Europe,
his full name was "Leonardo di ser Piero da Vinci", which means
"Leonardo, son of Mister Piero, from Vinci". Leonardo himself simply
signed his works "Leonardo" or "Io, Leonardo" ("I, Leonardo"). Most
authorities therefore refer to his works as "Leonardos", not "da
Vincis". Presumably he did not use his father's name because of his
illegitimate status.
.
Leonardo grew up with his father in Florence. Here, he started drawing
and painting. His early sketches were of such quality that his father
soon showed them to the painter Andrea del Verrocchio who subsequently
took the fourteen-year old Leonardo on as an apprentice. Later, he
became an independent painter in Florence.
..
Modern critics contend that Leonardo's love of boys was well-known
even in the sixteenth century. Rocke reports that in a fictional
dialogue on l'amore masculino (male love) written by the contemporary
art critic and theorist Gian Paolo Lomazzo, Leonardo appears as one of
the protagonists and declares, "Know that male love is exclusively the
product of virtue which, joining men together with the diverse
affections of friendship, makes it so that from a tender age they
would enter into the manly one as more stalwart friends." In the
dialogue, the interlocutor inquires of Leonardo about his relations
with his assistant, Salai, "Did you play the game from behind which
the Florentines love so much?"&gt;&gt;
-------------------------------------
&lt;&lt;Leonardo kept his private life particularly secret, and there is no
evidence that Leonardo was ever intimately involved with any woman,
nor in a close friendship with one. He also surrounded himself with
handsome young men throughout his life, and his art reflects an
appreciation of androgynous beauty. It has, therefore, been assumed
that he was a homosexual. One of his loves may have been Gian Giacomo
Caprotti da Oreno (nicknamed Salai (Little Devil)). Gian entered
Leonardo's household around 1488 at the age of 10, becoming his
servant and assistant.
.
In 1506, Leonardo met Count Francesco Melzi, the fifteen year old son
of a Lombard aristocrat. Salai eventually accepted Melzi's continued
presence and the three undertook various journeys throughout Italy.
Though Salai was always introduced as Leonardo's "pupil", he never
produced any work of artistic merit. Melzi, however, became his pupil
and life companion. Leonardo had many other friends who are now
figures renowned in their fields, or for their influence on history;
these included Niccol? Machiavelli, Cesare Borgia and Franchinus
Gaffurius.
.
Disregarding the controversy of homosexuality, it is clear from the
works of Leonardo and his early biographers, that he was a man of high
integrity and very sensitive to moral issues. Hereby, it should be
noted that Leonardo was a vegetarian at least a part of his life and
often bought birds just to release them. He was also the respected
judge on the matters of beauty and elegance, particularly in
pageantry.
.
Leonardo kept his private life particularly secret, going as far as
writing his journals in code. He also claimed to have a distaste of
physical relations: The act of procreation and anything that has any
relation to it is so disgusting that human beings would soon die out
if there were no pretty faces and sensuous dispositions, a comment
later interpreted by Freud, in an analysis of the artist, as
indicative of his "frigidity" (Gesammelte Werke bd VIII, 1909-1913).
He concludes that Leonardo is driven by a homosexual libido, one that
is sublimated in his scientific investigations. Indeed, Leonardo
surrounded himself with handsome youths throughout his life, and
allowed his art to reflect an appreciation of masculine beauty. His
lasting and loving relationship with young men and lack of close
relationships with women, together with surviving legal records and
contemporary writings have led many modern historians to conclude that
he had a strong erotic interest, one focused exclusively on males.
.
Leonardo's alleged love of boys was a topic of discussion even in the
sixteenth century. In "Il Libro dei Sogni " (The Book of Dreams) a
fictional dialogue on l'amore masculino (male love) written by the
contemporary art critic and theorist Gian Paolo Lomazzo, Leonardo
appears as one of the protagonists and declares, "Know that male love
is exclusively the product of virtue which, joining men together with
the diverse affections of friendship, makes it so that from a tender
age they would enter into the manly one as more stalwart friends." In
the dialogue, the interlocutor inquires of Leonardo about his
relations with his assistant, il Salaino, "Did you play the game from
behind which the Florentines love so much?" Leonardo answers, "And how
many times! Keep in mind that he was a beautiful young man, especially
at about fifteen."
.
Gian Giacomo Caprotti da Oreno, nicknamed il Salaino ("The Little
Unclean One" i.e., the devil), was described by Vasari as "a graceful
and beautiful youth with fine curly hair, in which Leonardo greatly
delighted." Il Salaino entered Leonardo's household in 1490 at the age
of 10. The relationship was not an easy one. A year later Leonardo
made a list of the boy's misdemeanors, calling him "a thief, a liar,
stubborn, and a glutton." The "Little Devil" had made off with money
and valuables on at least five occasions, and spent a fortune on
apparel, among which twenty four pairs of shoes. Nevertheless, il
Salaino remained his companion, servant and assistant for the next
thirty years, and Leonardo's notebooks during their early years
contain pictures of a handsome, curly-haired adolescent.
.
Il Salaino's name also appears (crossed out) on the back of an erotic
drawing (ca. 1513) by the artist, The Incarnate Angel, at one time in
the collection of Queen Victoria. It is seen as a humorous and
revealing take on his major work, St. John the Baptist, also a work
and a theme imbued with homoerotic overtones by a number of art
critics such as Martin Kemp and James Saslow (Saslow, 1986, passim).
Another erotic work, found on the verso of a foglio in the Atlantic
Codex, depicts il Salaino's behind, towards which march several
penises on two legs (Augusto Marinoni, in "Io Leonardo", Mondadori,
Milano 1974, pp.288, 310). Some of Leonardo's other works on erotic
topics, his drawings of heterosexual human sexual intercourse, were
destroyed by a priest who found them after his death.
.
In 1506, Leonardo met Count Francesco Melzi, the 15 year old son of a
Lombard aristocrat. Melzi himself, in a letter, described Leonardo's
feelings towards him as a sviscerato et ardentissimo amore ("a
passionate and most fiery love"). (Crompton, p.269) Salai eventually
accepted Melzi's continued presence and the three undertook journeys
throughout Italy. Though Salai was always introduced as Leonardo's
"pupil", he never produced any work of artistic merit. Melzi, however,
became Leonardo's pupil and life companion, and is considered to have
been his favorite student.
.
Both of these relationships follow the pattern of eroticized
apprenticeships which were frequent in the Florence of Leonardo's day,
relationships which were often loving and not infrequently sexual. See
Historical pederastic couples Besides them, Leonardo had many other
friends who are now figures renowned in their fields, or for their
influence on history. These included Cesare Borgia, in whose service
he spent the years of 1502 and 1503. During that time he also met
Niccol? Machiavelli, with whom later he was to develop a close
friendship. Also among his friends are counted Franchinus Gaffurius
and Isabella d'Este, whose portrait he drew while on a journey which
took him through Mantua. &gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt;In 1466 Leonardo was apprenticed to one of the most proficient
artists of his day, Andrea di Cione, known as Verrocchio. The workshop
of this famous master was at the centre of the intellectual currents
of the day. Among those apprenticed or associated with the workshop
were Perugino, Botticelli, and Lorenzo di Credi, assuring the young
Leonardo of an advanced education in all branches of the humanities.
.
As a fourteen-year-old apprentice Leonardo would have been trained in
all the countless skills that were employed in a traditional workshop
in which the artists were regarded primarily as craftsmen and only a
master such as Verrocchio had social standing.
.
The products of Verrochio's workshop would have included decorated
tournament shields, painted dowry chests, christening platters, votive
plaques, small portraits, and devotional pictures. Major commissions
included altarpieces for churches, and commemorative statues. Although
many craftsmen specialised in tasks such as frame-making, gilding and
bronze casting, Leonardo would have been exposed to a vast range of
technical skills and had the opportunity to learn drafting, chemistry,
metallurgy, metal working, plaster casting, leather working, mechanics
and carpentry as well as the obvious artistic skills of drawing,
painting, sculpting and modelling.
.
Although Verrocchio appears to have run an efficient and prolific
workshop, few paintings can be ascertained as coming from his hand.
And on one of those, Vasari tells us, Leonardo collaborated.
.
The painting is the Baptism of Christ. According to Vasari, Leonardo
painted the young angel holding Jesus' robe and Verrocchio,
overwhelmed by the sweetness of the angel's expression, its moist eyes
and lustrous curls, put down his brush and never painted again. This
is probably an exaggeration. The truth is that on close examination
the painting reveals much that has been painted or touched up over the
tempera using the new technique of oil paint. The landscape, the rocks
that can be seen through the brown mountain stream and much of the
figure of Jesus bears witness to the hand of Leonardo.[6]
.
The other creation of Verrocchio's which is particularly pertinent to
the young Leonardo is the bronze statue of David, now in the Bargello
Museum.[7] Apart from the exquisite quality of this work of art, it is
significant in holding the claim to be a portrait of the apprentice,
Leonardo. If this is the case, then in the figure of David we see
Leonardo as a thin muscular boy, quite different to the rounded
androgynous figure made by Verrocchio's teacher, Donatello. [8] It is
also suggested that the Archangel Michael in Verroccio's Tobias and
the Angels is a portrait of Leonardo.
.
When Leonardo was twenty he joined the Guild of St Luke, the guild of
artists and doctors of medicine, but even after his father set him up
in his own workshop, his attachment to Verrocchio was such that he
continued to work with him.
----------------------------------
&lt;&lt;Gian Giacomo Caprotti da Oreno,[14] nicknamed Salai or il Salaino
("The little devil), was described by Giorgio Vasari as "a graceful
and beautiful youth with fine curly hair, in which Leonardo greatly
delighted."
.
Il Salaino entered Leonardo's household in 1490 at the age of ten. The
relationship was not an easy one. A year later Leonardo made a list of
the boy's misdemeanours, calling him "a thief, a liar, stubborn, and a
glutton." The "Little Devil" had made off with money and valuables on
at least five occasions, and spent a fortune on apparel, among which
were twenty-four pairs of shoes. Nevertheless, Leonardo's notebooks
during their early years contain many pictures of the handsome, curly-
haired adolescent. Il Salaino remained his companion, servant, and
assistant for the next thirty years.
.
As a painter, Salaino's work is generally considered to be of less
artistic merit than others among Leonardo's pupils such as Marco
d'Oggione and Boltraffio. In 1515 he painted, under the name of Andrea
Salai, a nude portrait of "Lisa del Giocondo", based upon the Mona
Lisa and known as Monna Vanna.[2] The Mona Lisa was bequeathed to
Salaino by Leonardo, and in Salaino's own will at was assessed at the
high value of £200,000.
.
In 1506, Leonardo took as a pupil Count Francesco Melzi, the fifteen-
year-old son of a Lombard aristocrat. Salaino, at first jealous of
Melzi, eventually accepted his continued presence and the three
undertook journeys throughout Italy. Melzi became Leonardo's life
companion, and is considered to have been his favourite student. He
travelled to France with Leonardo and was with him until his death.&gt;&gt;
----------------------------------
&lt;&lt;Leonardo had many friends who are figures now renowned in their
fields, or for their influence on history. These included the
mathematician Luca Pacioli with whom he collaborated on a book in the
1490s and Cesare Borgia, in whose service he spent the years 1502 and
1503. During that time he also met Niccolò Machiavelli, with whom
later he was to develop a close friendship. Also among his friends are
counted Franchinus Gaffurius and Isabella d'Este. Isabella was
probably his closest female friend. He drew a portrait of her while on
a journey which took him through Mantua which appears to have been
used to create a painted portrait, now lost.
.
Beyond friendship, Leonardo kept his private life secret. He commented
"the act of procreation and anything that has any relation to it is so
disgusting that human beings would soon die out if there were no
pretty faces and sensuous dispositions". [16]
.
Leonardo appears to have had no intimate relationships with women
beyond his friendship with Isabella d'Este. It has been claimed since
the 16th century that Leonardo's relationships with his pupils Salai
and Melzi were sexual in nature and since that date much has written
about this aspect of Leonardo's life. &gt;&gt;
