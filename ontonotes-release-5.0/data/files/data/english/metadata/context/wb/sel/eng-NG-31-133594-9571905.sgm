Do remember the company forbes and co.. is the Flagship co.. of Shapoorji
paloonji group.Sp is the one of the original investors in Tata sons and
still holds 18% stake in Tata sons.This company is a hidden gem and was
first caught by Team stockresearchers fundamental research team at 530
levels.Since then the stock has sky rocketed to 956 levels.We believe its
just the beginning.Much more gains coming in the stock.Do remember the SOTP*
* valuations of this stock will be too high.Whatever we have mentioned we
have given the attached links along with our valuations.do refer them.

*Before reading the report do understand there might be more real estate
which cannot be valued as there is a lack of information from the management
about the same.Company is 200 year old and prime office space owned
(shipping divison- http://www.forbespatvolk.com/branches.htm )and occupied
by it has not been valued by us.We have simply valued its swadeshi mills
stake,Euraka forbes (100% stake) and its other known subsidaries.Do read the
attached annual report before you make any query about the stock.Read the
consolidated financial statements and notes from the auditors.Also refer the
site of the company links given at the end for further info...

**A 1200 cr sales after demerger and a 70 cr pbt company and a 40 cr pat
co..

bourses as the company is undergoing a restructuring.Company last year hived
off the textiles divison.The company has given a return of 55% in past week.
