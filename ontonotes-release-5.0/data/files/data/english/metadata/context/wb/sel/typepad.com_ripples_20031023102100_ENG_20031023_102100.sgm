One of the benefits of having lived a relatively long time is that I
have tons of memories, mostly good, that come back to delight and
occasionally astonish me. These memories do not return full-blown with
all details razor-sharp, but modern search engines quickly fill in the
missing pieces.

I was savoring a glass of wine and a late afternoon snack today when
I suddenly remembered the sound of Bonnie Dobson singing "The First
Time", a folk song from the early sixties. Her songs made quite an
impact on me at the time and I even went to see her at Folk City in New
York.

Like so many things in life, anticipation was better than the actual
experience. I got a chance to talk to her and she was as warm and
gracious as I expected, but the club environment was somehow not
appropriate for her.

I think she would have presented better in a coffeehouse. Still, I
listened to her albums for years. My favorites were: Dear Companion, For
the Love of Him, and Good Morning Rain.

She enjoyed some success as a folk singer in the early sixties and
then faded from the scene. From Google, I learned that she had moved to
England in 1969 after an unsuccessful attempt to transition to rock
music. Too bad, because her folk songs conveyed messages of lasting
importance.

I feel the world is richer because of her work. It has nothing to do
with the number of records sold. It is because she could reach out to
people and touch them in ways they would never forget. Thanks, Bonnie,
wherever you are. oddly enough, an online friend from the US who knew
her years ago (Bonnie) was trying to track her down recently and asked
if I could help as she is supposed to be n the UK now (where I am
based). I dont suppose you have any idea where she is now? cheers K

In 1993, Bonnie was the head administrator for the Philosophy
Department at the Berwick College of the University Of London. See this
link for her interview by Randy Jackson.

Berwick College as a first step. Good luck!

I bought and listened to all of Bonnie Dobson's records. Her songs
sparked a lifelong involvement in social equality and change. Would love
to find cd's of all the music as wore out the 78's years ago. I also
went to all her Folk City shows,in the 60's.
