In one of the gaming forums that I frequent, there is quite a heated
debate going on about Crysis and its likeness to its predecessor, Far
Cry.

Some people (me included) are of the opinion that if it wasn't for the
cybernetic suit in Crysis, that the game really would just be more of
Far Cry gameplay but with prettier graphics.

The sounds are the same, many of the gameplay elements are the same.
The binoculars for example. Once enemies are &quot;tagged&quot; with them they
appear on the HUD map.

The boats cruising around on the water are the same. The water is much
prettier and the boat handling seems a lot more realistic. But it's
definitely Far Cry gameplay.

The vehicles are almost identical to those in Far Cry. Even the
outdoor environments are the same. Lush jungle and copious amounts of
beach and water. Even the sounds and dramatic scores are unmistakably
Far Cry.

For me, there is absolutely no way that you could mistake Crysis as
anything other than a follow-up to Far Cry, and almost a clone of it
at that.

Some people claim that the Far Cry 2 that is in the works will prove
that Crysis is clearly different from Far Cry. I disagree. I think
we're getting two separate Far Cry sequels.

In my opinion Crysis will be a good game, but could have been a lot
better if Crytek were brave enough to make it a whole lot more
different from Far Cry than it seems to have turned out.

More like business making the deciding factor than lack of creativity.
If you remember, Crytek was an independent studio when Far Cry came
out. Ubisoft published it and from what happened later, bought out the
rights to Far Cry. So, when EA bought Crytek, they couldn't take the
Far Cry franchise with them. Probably Crytek was working on the actual
sequel to Far Cry when all this happened and that is what became
Crysis. There are quite a few differences. Jack was the main character
in Far Cry and he was just a regular guy, not part of some elite
military squad. The main enemy was the mad scientist and the mutant
creatures he was creating.  Crysis has an extraterrestrial crash
landing with the North Koreans getting there first and the black elite
squad being sent in for covert ops. The combat is against regular
North Korean troops but there will be the ET's later and who knows?
As for the main elements of gameplay, EA is pretty conservative,
backward some may say, so they probably wanted to go with a sure thing
with the new Cryengine. Don't try some radical departure and get
caught up in a Duke Nukem development cycle.  It looks like it is
going to work out well and at least EA didn't screw with things to the
point of FUBAR.  I think the actual Far Cry 2 takes the same main
character and develops from there. It looks pretty good too, although
it is using the a modification of the original Cryengine which Ubisoft
also got the rights to.

I agree, and it was a smart thing to do. I'm already
beyond loyal to Far Cry, and that readily transferred
to Crysis. So they did it. We have Far Cry 2, and
the next Far Cry 2 will find its place along side of
Crysis as a partner in the best games ever written
for the PC. I include Gothic 3 in this heritage. That
means we will wait hoping for Gothic 4 to fix the
mess Jowood made of Gothic 3 by forcing it to
market too soon.

What I really like about Crysis is my stealth approach
from Far Cry transferred nicely to this game. The trailers
I saw for Crysis were so immature ( keybd beaters )
that I thought Crysis was merely just another Xbox360
POS like GOW. That disgusted me, and I was more
than ready to take them on for doing it to Far Cry.
Not true. Crytek knew that the embedded environ was
a major theme, and we would not tolerate anything
less. And they gave it to us. I am just delighted with
this demo, and $50 will go straight to the sales dude
with no hesitation at all.

I see your point, but when was the last time you played a demo and the
final game was completely different? By their very nature demos are there
to demonstrate what you're getting in the final version.

I suspect this Crysis demo was deliberately styled to be a Far Cry clone
because what they're encouraging us to look at are the differences
between this engine and the previous one. Plus the fact that Far Cry was
very successful and 'more of the same, but different' is a formula which
works very well in just about every from books &amp; movies to gaming!

I suspect we may see a divergence later on, with the game becoming less
Far Cry like. But even if it doesn't, I won't be complaining. All FPS
games have weak AI, cheesy plots, and their fair share of disappointments.
The key is whether they allow us room to use our own imagination when
progressing through the game. Far Cry, and now Crysis, seem to offer
that.

Maybe it's just another layer of illusion to be seen through, but it
works for me so far.

Andrew McP

PS I agree with the original post. Both sides of the argument are valid.
But I really do think Crysis moves FPS games into a new era of
capabilities and expectations in terms of the basic engine, which
dictates gameplay. So I'm *very* easily swayed to the positive side. My
first few minutes in the demo were spent wandering around in the dark
wondering what was different. But as the sun rose, so did my enjoyment. I
think it's a very cleverly designed level.

A bit late to the party, but I have only just got to play the demo and
I am completely under whelmed so far. It is definitely Far Cry, I fell
for the hype in that game a few years back and I am not about to do
the same with this one.

I had been hearing all sorts of guff in gaming Podcasts that had
played the beta that it redefined FPS gaming and that existing games
looked bland in comparison. I have see nothing so far that has
impressed me over Far Cry, but my list of cons so far are:

1)Plays like a dog on my C2D 6420, 8800GTS, 2GB RAM in Vista, I had to
turn graphics down to low to get it half playable. I ran it in high in
slideshow mode, it looked pretty, but not much more so than Far Cry.

2) You meet up with another member of your unit, he goes running off
with his flashlight blazing on a supposedly covert mission.

3) You find the guy stuck in the tree, you are told to go on, and your
team mate has to stay there to look after his weapons FFS.

4) Got in a firefight with an enemy, one minute he was facing me,
running for cover and shooting, the next he had his back to me and
wouldn't turn around even when I was shooting him.

5) Like Far Cry, still very limited interaction with vegetation and
obstacles. Vietcong was streets ahead how many years ago? Even Halo 3
on a &quot;dumbed down console&quot; has vegetation that moves when you brush
it.

6) It still has checkpoints. The fanboy's are going to rave about it
being non linear, but all the time, checkpoints show it is just
another linear game that doesn't have the highs that a properly
conceived linear game provides.

Hopefully the other Far Cry 2 will pull something out of the bag.

I hope we do too.

I've been trying to put my finger on just what jars me about how
similar Crysis seems to Far Cry. I'm still not completely sure what it
is.

The best I can come up with is that I hope there is greater variety in
the environments with a good balance between indoor and outdoor
combat. If Crysis is predominantly jungle/beach/coastal waters I'll be
very disappointed.

What I'm hoping for is that Crysis will make me remember it for the
other reasons apart from that it was very similar to Far Cry. The
cybernetic suit it is a nice addition, but for me it's not enough to
make Crysis memorable in its own right.

Perhaps the full game will change my view. We shall see.

I do like the different ways that you can achieve objectives in the
game. The suit makes for some interesting gameplay options.

I wonder whether the special suit will be as powerful as it is in the
demo from the start, or whether we'll be able to upgrade it as we play
through the game.

AA and high resolution are both killers from what I can see. x2fsaa seems
fine on my GTS, x4 is unplayable (by my standards). Lowering the
resolution helps a lot as well. At 1280x1024 my minimum FPS is about 2.
At 1024 that goes up to about 20. And IME it's minimum fps which matters
most.

I know these days it's unfashionable to play at lower resolutions/low
FSAA, but I advise everyone who's having problems to try it.

Apart from that, I can't help you like Crysis. I think it's safe to say
that anyone who disliked Far Cry will dislike this just as much.

LOL! And no other FPS game (say, HL2?) has such pathetic plot devices.
Sure, that (and other similar bits in the demo) is a bit rubbish. But
it's hardly a surprise. If I want intelligent team behaviour I'll play
something online... or maybe not, depending who I'm playing with. :-)

I'm not sure. But one reason Far Cry really appealed to me was its
emphasis on large, outdoor scenery. And I like the beach as much as the
next person, so islands are fine by me.

Some variation will be great though, and I'm sure we'll get it thanks to
the choice of geographical location. The designers must get tired of
island scenery, after all!

I haven't played the demo yet but if it is just an improved version of Far
Cry, what's the problem? Everyone always ridicules me for asking for more
new weapons and enemies in the HL2 episodes. Crysis gives you a whole lot
of new possibilities with the Nanosuit and people are critizing it already
to be too similar but the same people have no problems to accept that the
HL2 episodes are just more of HL2. That's selective thinking at it's best!

Well, the fact that Far Cry was one of the greatest games ever and
for-runner for &quot;greatest FPS ever&quot; means that it's no bad thing. I mean, at
least it's not another newbie game like Doom 3 or over-rated fanboi stuff
like HL2.

However, I don't like the fact thaqt there are no bullet wounds on bodies
and hope that this will be fixed for the rest of the world before or shortly
after release. There's a few other things I don't like as well such as the
fact that it doesn't seem as 'open' as FC was. Still, I'm aware that this is
only the first level and that things may open up later, but surely the point
of a demo is to impress the hell out of people and not leave them with
lingering doubts?

I just found this tip at:
http://forums.electronicarts.co.uk/showthread.php?t=287343

&quot;Make sure you turn off motion blur you can do this by editing the
postprocessing.cfg file. This seriously hits FPS at high settings by
default it is set to 3 but get rid of it or lower it to 1 and you will
see a difference.&quot;

Setting it to 0 made the game playable at medium settings for me.

sure, wouldn't that be nice? but at least in that example, don't you
think it might be a priority to take out the gps blocker first?

i will wonder myself if they couldn't have made things even more open if
the full game only offers what's possible in the demo level, but it
seems to me that it's not much more than a tutorial training mission.

but i think that should be enough for anyone who played far cry to know
if it's for them or not - don't like far cry, avoid crysis.

The read me easily shows that VIsta needs a high PC than if you run in
XP. I blame that on MS since it is obvious Vista is a blouted mess.

&gt;&quot;Make sure you turn off motion blur you can do this by editing the

From the readme:
&quot;Crysis also features HDR rendering which can be activated via the
shading quality in the advanced options menu. In HDR mode you can
notice bright image areas not appearing burned out. You can also
notice the eye adapting to the brightness of the environment.
Deactivating HDR can give you higher frame rates as it requires
more graphics card performance and graphics card memory.&quot;

&quot;Vertical Sync is a graphical option you can choose in your graphics
card driver. Switching this option off gives you best frame rate
but the image quality might suffer and the image may appear torn
apart. This is mostly noticeable when doing a quick horizontal
camera rotation. For benchmarking, this option is usually switched
off.&quot;

Nobody said it was a problem. The debate was about its likeness to Far

Werner, I don't know how you manage to get so many of these things

No complaints from me other than I was hoping that Crysis would be a

That is all.

As it stands, based on the demo, I believe that we are getting two
sequels to Far Cry.

YMMV of course.

Thanks, I have all the useful Vista hotfixes installed. With a bit of
playing with the settings, I have it working quite well now in high
settings and medium textures.

I have to say I after finishing the demo I prefer it to Far Cry, but
subsequently I have played some more HL2 Ep2 and while it looks a lot
worse, it achieves far greater excitement, and I am not even majorly
stoked with Ep2.

Once again I will be out of step with popular opinion and the Far Cry
fans will be all over this one for the next few months. At least they
will get some enjoyment from it.

The whole desert island bit had me bored and I was constantly reminded
of playing Just Cause where despite it being a pretty dumb game, it
was far more fun.

">

Yes, there are definite similarities to Far Cry such as what you
mentioned... same musical cues, the patrol boats puttering around, jungle,
etc.

But from the demo, we can't tell how far all those similarities are carried
through the game - i.e., how long do we stay in the jungle, etc.?

There was also the video that was released some time ago (was it at the
last big E3?) that showed a fight on the deck of an aircraft carrier.  When
that was released there were complaints all over the place about the game
not being like Far Cry.  Which I find ironic because now that we have the
demo, there are countless complaints about the game being the *same* as Far
Cry.  The developers are damned if they do; and damned if they don't.

Some of the gameplay footage that's been released over the past months has
had me concerned about the gameplay - I'm referring to the footage of
fighting the aliens.  This footage looked very much *unlike* farcry and
more like a spray and pray console shooter.  I'm *still* concerned about
that.

Myself, if it *is* like Far Cry, I won't mind at all.  I always hoped for
some Far Cry expansion packs but we never got them.  So if this game is
very much like Far Cry, then I'll look at as the expansion packs I never
got, with a new graphics engine as a big fat bonus.

SPOILERS BELOW.............

If I remember correctly, the game is devided into three major acts...

The first third of the game is supposed to be jungle-like, as in the
demo.

The second third is supposed to be primarily aboard an aircraft carrier.

The last third is a return to the jungle, but it's now been all frozen
and thus 'dead' (save for lots and lots of aliens).

There a game setting called something like &quot;enable suit shortcuts&quot; that
allow you to control the suit through the keyboard.

I don't remember the specific keys (I read about this at tweakguides.com
forums), but when you enable the 'shortcuts', the suit can be controlled by
double tapping certain keys. I remember double tapping the Space bar
triggered one function, double tapping 'S' switched to another function,
etc.

I remember when I was reading which keys did what, it sounded like it could
be somewhat cumbersome; e.g. you hit the 'S' a few times key to back up a
little bit and it causes your suit to switch functions.  But I've not tried
it so I have no clue.

&gt; Some people (me included) are of the opinion that if it wasn't for the

&gt; The sounds are the same, many of the gameplay elements are the same.
&gt; The binoculars for example. Once enemies are &quot;tagged&quot; with them they
&gt; appear on the HUD map.

&gt; The boats cruising around on the water are the same. The water is much
&gt; prettier and the boat handling seems a lot more realistic. But it's
&gt; definitely Far Cry gameplay.

&gt; The vehicles are almost identical to those in Far Cry. Even the
&gt; outdoor environments are the same. Lush jungle and copious amounts of
&gt; beach and water. Even the sounds and dramatic scores are unmistakably
&gt; Far Cry.

&gt; For me, there is absolutely no way that you could mistake Crysis as
&gt; anything other than a follow-up to Far Cry, and almost a clone of it
&gt; at that.

I'd agree to a large extent.  But 'improved'.  That's the key for me.  I
enjoyed FC (except for the mutants obviously) so I wanted more but
improved.  Not so much the better graphics (though that'll be nice
further down the line when I can play it as the devs see it) but other
elements.  Better physics, some destructible terrain etc.  I'd like to
say better AI but the jury's out.  I've seen it have great moments and
daft moments.  More of the same of a game I enjoyed suits me plus it
remains to be seen how far the similarity goes.

&gt; Some people claim that the Far Cry 2 that is in the works will prove

Far Cry 2 looks distinctly different to me - a bigger difference than I
see between FC and Crysis.  Obviously once (if) we get a demo we could
well find its FC in Africa.  Either way I'm looking forward to it.

Don't entirely agree.  I think it could well be different enough in
later parts of the full game.  I'm looking forward to seeing the frost
and snow and inside the alien ship etc

There was less needed to change. HL2 is a wildly successful
franchise. Far Cry was pretty much a failure with few people enjoying
it. Crysis looking and playing like Far Cry is, IMO, a joke since its
not supposed to by a follow up. It's supposed to be a completely
different game. Frankly I think its just more eye candy for people who
get suckered into thinking that big area = non linear and &quot;open&quot; game
