This was an e-mail I received, I removed the original and subsequent
headers to provide privacy to the senders, but there were thousands
of folks on it. I think this will work, if we can give it a chance.

: FW: How to lower gas prices

Join the resistance!!!!  I hear we are going to hit close to $3.00 a
gallon by the summer and it might go higher!! Want gasoline prices
to come down? We need to take some intelligent, united action.

Phillip Hollsworth offered this good idea: This makes MUCH MORE
SENSE than the "don't buy gas on a certain day" campaign that was
going around last April or May! The oil companies just laughed at
that because they knew we wouldn't continue to "hurt" ourselves by
refusing to buy gas.  It was more of an inconvenience to us than it
was a problem for them.   BUT, whoever thought of this idea has come
up with a plan that can really work.

Please read it and join with us! By now you're probably thinking
gasoline priced at about $1.50 is super cheap. Me too! It is
currently $2.09 for regular unleaded in my town. Now that the oil
companies and the OPEC nations have conditioned us to think that the
cost! Of a gallon of gas is CHEAP at $1.50- $1.75, we need to take
aggressive action to teach them that BUYERS control the
marketplace....not sellers. With the price of gasoline going up more
each day, we consumers need to take action.  The only way we are
going to see the price of gas come down is if we hit someone in the
pocketbook by not purchasing their gas! And we can do that WITHOUT
hurting ourselves. How? Since we all rely on our cars, we can't just
stop buying gas. But we CAN have an impact on gas prices if we all
act together to force a price war.

Here's the idea: For the rest of this year, DON'T purchase ANY
gasoline from the two biggest companies (which now are one), EXXON
and MOBIL. If they are not selling any gas, they will be inclined to
reduce their prices. If they reduce their prices, the other
companies will have to follow suit. But to have an impact, we need
to reach literally millions of Exxon and Mobil gas buyers.  It's
really simple to do!! Now, don't whimp out on me at this
point...keep reading and I'll explain how simple it is to reach
millions of people!!

I am sending this note to about thirty people. If each of you send
it to at least ten more (30 x 10 = 300) ... and those 300 send it to
at least ten more (300 x 10 = 3,000)...and so on, by the time the
message reaches the sixth generation of people, we will have reached
over THREE MILLION consumers. If those three million get excited
and! Pass this on to ten friends each, and then 30 million people
will have been contacted! If it goes one level further, you guessed
it..... THREE HUNDRED MILLION PEOPLE!!!

Again, all you have to do is send this to 10 people. That's all.
(If you don't understand how we can reach 300 million and all you
have to do   is send this to 10 people.... Well, let's face it, you
just aren't a mathematician. But I am ... so trust me on this one.)

How long would all that take?  If each of us sends this e-mail out
to ten more people within one day of receipt, all 300 MILLION people
could conceivably be contacted within the next 8 days!!!  I'll bet
you didn't think you and I had that much potential, did you!  Acting
together we can make a difference.

If this makes sense to you, please pass this message on. PLEASE HOLD
OUT UNTIL THEY LOWER THEIR PRICES TO THE $1.30 RANGE AND KEEP THEM
DOWN. THIS CAN REALLY WORK. Kerry Lyle, Director, Research Coordinator

you realize there is no possible way this will hurt any oil company.......

besides the fact that the logic is incorrect, since the big oil
companies sell their gas to smaller ones, they still make their profit....

=============================================
$1.30 range?!!!  lol, I guess thats what happens when the same crap is
copyed and pasted since 2001!

I wrote a little on this matter below. but if you dont want to read what I
have to say, then go to http://www.snopes.com/inboxer/petition/gasout.htm

Yet another feeble effort that will not work. If we all boycott Exxon/Mobil
we will still be demanding the same amount of fuel, just not from them. So
all the other fuel manufacturers will have an increase on their demand, and
be forced to raise their prices while Exxon/Mobil stays unchanged. As all
the other fuel prices rise, Exxon/Mobil will start to look more appealing
since their price has not gone up!

Come on folks. boycotting one supplier when there is a limited supply only
hurts yourself. We need to decrease the quantity demanded. In other words
just  plain buy less gas, from everyone! That's right, You are endorsing
these high gas prices when you buy these gas guzzling SUVs and giant trucks
that never hauls anything more then your fat butt.

Many car companies are offering alternative fuel vehicles, Natural gas cars,
electric cars, etc. Dumping the Ever-enlarging SUVs and getting smaller,
more fuel efficient, more economical cars that use less fuel will not only
cause the gas demand to go down, but most of these fuel efficient cars are
much cheaper (to buy AND to own)  this way you will then have more money to
spend on other things. OR maybe, just maybe you can... -gasp- SAVE some
money in the bank! I know, I know. a Honda Civic hybrid, or a Toyota Pirus
doesn't exactly that that "Bling" factor that so many weak-minded
Californian's have grown dependent on. So next time you fill up. just
remember, YOU bought your car. YOU can choose what ever car you want. Gas
prices are what they are and if we continue to buy SUVs and trucks that use
a lot of gas, then the gas prices will continue to rise. Its simply the
price you pay for your status. Swallow some pride and trade in that Hummer
H2, or YukonXL and get an Envoy, or Highlander. Still nice SUVs, still just
as capable as many larger SUVs.

Further more. The Chevy Suburban, one of the most commonly seen SUVs on the
road (could just be because of its size) from 5268-6073 pounds, it's a hefty
beast too! How about the Silverado 1500? Bet you have seen a few of those on
the road! 4225-5834 pounds! Then there is the all coveted H2, tipping the
scales at 6400 pounds.  Lets take a look at the Ford explorer shall we?
Currently weighing in at 4301 pounds. But in 1995, it came in at 3952
pounds. How about the Dodge Ram 2500? Currently, 6207, was just a shade over
5000 just ten years ago. Exactly how much steel is used in these SUVs? Since
its currently 11PM, and I am sure this email will surface in another six
months (as it has in the past) I will get into the cost of heating steel and
aluminum to melt it down to make the cars and trucks. The mere cost of the
steel that is used in a 6000 SUV compared to the cost of the steel in a 3000
pound SUV.. You can build twice as many cars with the same about of steel,
and the smaller cars get better fuel economy, AND usually carry just as many
people in a smaller area! The solution is not to boycott the fuel suppliers.
We need to boycott the ever popular trend of growing cars! They just keep
getting bigger!

I know quite a few people that commute over 60 miles each way for work. That
comes out to over 31k miles a year in JUST commuting to work. Its not just
the fuel economy though, its the size of the vehicles. One full size
consumes just about as much space as two economy cars. If we got rid of the
unnecessary big SUVs and trucks, then traffic would not be as bad ether..
and with better traffic comes a higher average speed, approaching closer to
a more efficient speed for the engine. Allowing the engine to operate in its
more efficient range AND less time is spent sitting in traffic. Less
traffic, less stress, less road rage, lower blood pressure and less
medication due to stress induced ailments.

Beyond the car market, there are other solution to saving gas. Take the bus!
Walk, ride a bicycle, or really push yourself and CARPOOL!  That's right!
share the commute with a coworker! Not only will this cut down on gas
consumption, but it will also remove cars from the freeways causing less
traffic. with less traffic, the cars will be able to actually move, a car
moving at 60 MPH on the freeway in over-drive is more fuel efficient then
the same car in second gear doing 20 MPH. Use less gas, AND get to work
sooner, and less stressed out from the drive.

So you want to pay less for gas? Gas prices are not going to fall. so you
will just have buy less gas. A new issue that has been coming up lately is
China. They are growing and developing at an amazing rate. They are quickly
becoming a major fossil fuel consumer. We need to reduce our fuel
consumption more, and faster then their ever growing rate of demand climbs!
WE only have so much oil, and the demand will only grow with the global
development and modernization.

Here is another thought. How much time do you spend sitting in your car in
line at the drive through? How much gas is burned in California while they
wait for their food to be cooked? Park your car, turn it off, get your lazy
butt out of your car and into the restaurant and eat inside. Or better yet,
just don't eat out! Most home made food is more healthy then fast food. And
is MUCH cheaper. AND you will not be using your precious gas to go get it.
Just throw a cooler in the trunk, and your set, fresh food on demand!

Just my $.02   do what you will, its your money.

Ahh yes, the cost of helping one's ego, even at $10 a gallon, some folks
will still need that social crutch to think they are "cool" or "popular"

Of course it is.  As you know, the price of fuel seems to have little to do
with the day's price of oil.  It seems that the oil execs are getting scared
with the recent rapid shift of Americans to more fuel efficient vehicles (as
seen by rapid market share loss of GM and Ford) and are trying to lull us
back into being the selfish ignorant people we are so good at being with
lower prices (for a while).  Fuel price by me is now back to $1.99 form
$2.24 a week ago but it will be for a short time.

You are trying to play the "supply and demand" game with the people that set
the supply. It won't work. Refinery production will be balanced with
whatever demand the consumer sets. Prices are not high because Mother Earth
ran out of oil. I know oil is a limited natural resource, but when are we
going to run out? I don't think any time in the immediate future. If we
reduce the demand, the refineries (who you want to boycott) will reduce
production to balance the demand, then RAISE prices to make up for lost
sales volume. If you think they will keep refining just to store the
products and create a supply "overstock" you are kidding yourself.

LOL, where do you guy's come up with this crap.  The market is what it is
and if demand goes down, so will the price.  Even now the price of gas is
falling fast in many areas because the oil companies see people rapidly
moving toward better mileage cars.  If they tried to raise prices in
response to lower demand it would drive even more people to even smaller
better mileage vehicles and reduce demand even further and then the
government would have to get involved since that would be price gouging and
the last thing the oil companies want is price regulations.  BTW, do you
happen to work for the oil company?

provide you with Regular at 2.40 avg (2.35 to 2.60) or diesel at
2.75avg.  And this is where the State Legislature is saying we need

No, I don't work for any of the oil companies.

Gasoline production is right on par with the trend of the last 10 years.
They are keeping up with demand nicely. In fact, we are producing 6,000
barrels a day more than in the same week of 2003. Here is the data up to
April 8 2005.

Yes, refining costs have gone up since January, but it still has less of an

The breakdown of what we pay for in a gallon of gas at American pumps.
March 2005 national average.

6% distribution and marketing
19% refining costs
21% taxes

The US is the largest user of crude oil, but we are not the only users.
North America (US, Mexico, and Canada) consumes 30% of the global market. If
the entire continent got together and cut our oil use overnight by a
staggering 50% the global market would only see a 15% reduction in sales.

Operating and materials costs of the oil companies are recovered in the
price of the product. When the sales volume goes down, the percentage of
those costs recovered in the product goes up. There is less product being
sold to recover the portion of overhead that does not change with production
levels. A 50% volume loss will have less than a 15% lowering effect on the
global market pricing of the crude oil, and crude oil is only 54% of the end
product price. That's an 8% operating cost break for a 50% reduction in
sales. Volume goes down, price goes up.

Even if all of alaska and everywhere else were to suddenly be opened up for
drilling. it would take years for anything to come of it.  Sorry Miles, but
drilling is neither a short or long term solution to the problem.
Concervation can be started today with results happening TODAY.  Sounds
pretty short term to me.  And then if the demand for more fuel efficient
cars continues, the builders will have no choice but to work on improving
the technology, perhaps to the point of not really needing oil at all for
fuel.  That sounds like a solid long term solution to me.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

The only one ignoring them is you.  Our dependence is caused in a big way by
our own hand and our continual waste of energy.  Everything most Americans
that can afford it have is way bigger than they need and if they want to
continue this way, it comes at a cost.  Just digging more well is truly
ignorong the problem and trying to deal with the symptoms.  The problem with

simply cut back and all that will happen is that we will be wasting our
resources.  As for the long term solution, that will only be found (if there

Well, the author of the website says conservation won't matter... any
advances in conservation &amp; efficiency will cause us to consume more and
total oil usage will continue to rise. It also states that hybrid cars
production is very oil- and energy- intensive, and in fact offsets any
savings made in decreased fuel consumption.

What really bothers me is that there's simply no way our energy needs can be
satisfied without oil... unless there is a breakthrough in nuclear fusion or

pollution output of the vehicle.  And on top of all of that good news, the

gasoline and reformers are not always 100% efficient.  If carbon oxides get

It's my understanding that the first fuel cell cars will probably get

Makes sense.  The infrastructure is already there, so might as well make
use of it.

Still some serious problems with fuel cell technology for automotive
purposes though.  The volume problem seems fairly serious.  How do you
pack enough H2 in the car to get a reasonable distance?  How do you
store the H2 safely?  Where do you get the H2 from (it's energy intensive
to produce)?

But I think this technology is going to fly!  Maybe 10 years?  And not
just in cars.  Instead of those AA batteries powering all your electronics,
you'll have a refillable miniature fuel cell that will do the job.

In the meantime, perhaps the prospect of $3/gal gasoline will get
America more serious about alternative energy.  It's only been 30
years since the first "wake up call" gas crisis!

That is because this author is to put it simply, FULL OF SHIT.  How does it
really take any more oil to produce a hybrid vehicle than a standard one and
over the life of the vehicle, it will use less petroleum products than a

use less, it lasts longer and there is no magic about that.  He is trying to
mix conservation with efficiency and they are two very different things.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I'd say it's too believable to be true... but would love to hear

&gt;&gt; Well, the author of the website says conservation won't matter... any
&gt;&gt; advances in conservation &amp; efficiency will cause us to consume more
&gt;&gt; and total oil usage will continue to rise. It also states that
&gt;&gt; hybrid cars production is very oil- and energy- intensive, and in
&gt;&gt; fact offsets any savings made in decreased fuel consumption.

&gt; That is because this author is to put it simply, FULL OF SHIT.  How
&gt; does it really take any more oil to produce a hybrid vehicle than a
&gt; standard one and over the life of the vehicle, it will use less
&gt; petroleum products than a conventional one.  As for conservation, how
&gt; could it have no effect?  If you use less, it lasts longer and there
&gt; is no magic about that.  He is trying to mix conservation with
&gt; efficiency and they are two very different things.

Of course! I'd estimate we use 60-70% of our resources (money) to buy things

TBone, there are cars out there now that are only 3 years old with
100,000 miles on them.  You're attempting to shoot for below or at
averages.  Why?  There are some well above average mileage.  You sure
squirm alot even though you'll deny it.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Why do you insist on spinning your own words?  You stated we need to
keep our own oil.  For what purpose?  We will use alot of oil for
decades to come.  Cars aren't the only thing to use oil.  New
technologies across all sectors aren't going to drastically reduce oil
consumption anytime soon, hybrids or not, high gas prices or not.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I would rather us be forced to do it now while
&gt; we still have oil to fall back on if things don't work unlike you who will
&gt; use oil blindly until we are out and then complain that nothing was done

&gt; less), you and those like you will do nothing.

Being dependent on foreign oil has nothing to do with that though.  Oil
prices won't come down if we use our own.  You say we should use others
first.  Why?

Oh geez.  You point to a biased tree hugger website for your 'evidence'.

news reports from traditional media outlets?  Didn't think so.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

We do need it to get off foreign dependency while working on other
energy sources that will take many decades.  Oil is used for far more
than just cars too.

done, just like now.  We need to move like there is no more oil if we are to
have any chance of this economy not crashing down around us in the not so
distant future and as long as that cushion exists, it aint gonna happen and
a current example is the current state of the American car companies.

&gt; &gt; I have no problem with that but the oil companies have shown time and
time
&gt; &gt; again that they cannot be trusted to hold to what they promise or take
&gt; &gt; responsibility when something goes wrong.  The problem Miles is that
they
&gt; &gt; are not looking for more oil out of need, they are looking for oil that
they
&gt; &gt; can pump cheaply with little concern for environmental issues (greed).

&gt; Thats typical of any industry.  If industry won't police itself then
&gt; someone else has too.
">

And that is exactly what is happening.  They have proven that they cannot be
trusted and the only way to police them is not to let them get started.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Oil industry is no different.  But your bleeding
&gt; heart story doesn't do anything to help.  You say it requires high
&gt; prices to drive new technologies.  Great, raise gas taxes to pay for
&gt; such technologies.  I don't care.  But we need oil and thus need to find
&gt; what we have now rather than wait.
">

Because raising taxes will do nothing at all besides hurt the people that
can afford it the least.  It creates little motivation for companies to
seriously more forward with developing new technologies when the only ones
that really need it can't afford it.  When the writing is on the wall that
the new technology IS going to be needed by the ones with the big bucks like
yourself, then there is a strong motivation to develope it and be the best
at it.

&gt; &gt; I didn't refuse anything and the only thing that is false is your spin.
&gt; &gt; Like I said before, the primary motivators are fear and greed and you
want
&gt; &gt; to remove the fear of running out in your lifetime because you are
greedy
&gt; &gt; for that resource and the fact that as long as it exists, you don't have
to
&gt; &gt; give up anything.  I hope that you don't have any kids because they are
the
&gt; &gt; ones that are going to have to live with the mess that you and those
like
&gt; &gt; you are leaving.

&gt; My lifetime?  You're the one who has said oil won't even last several
&gt; decades.  You made the rules, not me.  I want oil found for whenever it
&gt; is needed.
">

Of course you do, then you don't have to make any changes in your lifestyle
or give up anything.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; The only one ranting about this is you.  If you want to reduce our
&gt; &gt; dependency on foreign oil we can do that today with conservation but you
are
&gt; &gt; unwilling to even consider it.

&gt; Conservation today will cut dependency in an appreciable amount?
">

Absolutly and without question.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Hardly.  Conservation is great but you refuse to face the reality that
&gt; we do not yet have technologies available to reduce oil consumption on a
&gt; large scale.
">

Yet another complete right wing load of shit.  We probably waste about 80%
of the fuel that we use in oversized vehicles and homes that we simply do
not need.  If the private consumer cut energy consumption by even 25%,
(which could easily be done) the savings would be huge!  The point is that
we can begin to conserve today and if after a serious effort, we still
absolutely need more oil, then you will get no arguments from anyone to
begin seriously looking for more.  The problem is, that you and those like
you don't want to put in any effort at all.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Why do liberals ignore reality?  What you want to achieve
&gt; will take decades and does little for today.
">

Where do you get this decades crap from.  Please supply some valid data to
back this up.  This country can change things amazingly fast when the need
happens although it does require some sacrifice and I believe that is what
you are trying to avoid at all costs.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; No, we need to begin seriously working on different sources of energy
AND
&gt; &gt; conserving what we currently have.

&gt; I agree but if oil won't last several decades then you're saying the oil
&gt; won't even last until all those whiz bang new technologies are
&gt; mainstream public.  So what do we do during the period of no oil and
&gt; these new technologies taking its place?
">

Why do you think that everything takes so long to happen.  This is simply no
longer the case.  Sorry Miles, but your old conservative fear tactics really
don't hold water anymore.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt;&gt;Nope.  I don't argue with my own family that lives there.

&gt; &gt; LOL, just everyone else. who does.

&gt; And you argue based on no knowledge of your own nor from anyone you know
&gt; personally.

Really, when?  IIRC, I stayed out of that argument between you and a few
people
