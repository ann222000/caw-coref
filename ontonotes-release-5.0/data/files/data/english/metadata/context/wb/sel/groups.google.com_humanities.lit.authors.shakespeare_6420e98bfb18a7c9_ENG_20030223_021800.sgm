I love this. However, my first response never
made it to my server. Not that I care, in fact,
because here is the complete and slightly revised
version of my suggestions for the remainder.

A mad 'moiselle sets England by the ears.
A bully shows a harridan what's what.
A wife and daughter 'die' for sixteen years.
Two pairs of twins completely lose the plot.
A little academe's on hold a while.
A Hero's death turns out to be a lie.
A ship is wrecked upon a magic isle.
A mother eats some rather nasty pie.
A portly knight is shown to be a loser.
A king dies when his stuff's lost in the Wash.
A legal eagle weds a lead-box chooser.
A tearaway, once crowned, becomes all posh.
A duke's unrecognized in friar's gear.
All these, and more, alleged to be Shakespeare!

A man's friend cheats him while they're out of town.
A princess prophesies both woe and worse.
A banished earl comes back and claims the crown.
A troglodyte thinks mankind is a curse.
The Yorks v Lancs 'contention' starts its run.
A countess puts this black guy's father straight.
A duke (eponymous) dies in Act I.
An exile bets his wife's inviolate.
A king's Doc's pleased a countess ain't her Ma.
The late Queen's father struts his Tudor stuff.
A prince's rival is his girl-friend's Pa.
The play when Will (and Fletch?) said &quot;That's enough!&quot;
So - nine and thirty works from Shakespeare heaven.
In Sonnet-form 155, 6 and 7.

The *fun* part was in decimating Shakespeare to get the
line &quot;no matter how witty, so it be eloquent and fun&quot;
as a title because the context is toward *full*:

&quot;Go, write it in a martial hand; be curst and brief;
it is no matter how witty, so it be eloquent and fun
of invention: taunt him with the licence of ink:
if thou thou'st him some thrice, it shall not be
amiss; and as many lies as will lie in thy sheet of
paper, although the sheet were big enough for the
bed of Ware in England, set 'em down: go, about it.
Let there be gall enough in thy ink, though thou

Loved your work, Peter.
As good as the original gleaned from the tv listings.

Did you mean to capitalize Wash? (I figure that is

dictionaries on harridan and tearaway.

Yes, although Shakespeare said 'Washes'.

As you have not (yet) responded to this remark, I think
I may need to amplify *why* I said this.

The point is that you had said, referring to R.S. Gwynn's
poem, that it was &quot;with each line taken from the tv listings&quot;.
Now, if you go back and look at it again, I think you will
find that what *he* says is that it was &quot;with a first line taken
from the tv listings&quot;. This is makes things very different.

What I think he was saying is that he had seen in the tv
listings the following 'summary' of Hamlet. &quot;A man is
haunted by his father's ghost&quot;, and that, given that this is
generally believed to have been one of the greatest plays
ever written, such a description might fall a little short
of the ideal? That it happened to be in iambic pentameter
was fortuitous.

Is this really how people think of those very few Shake-
speare plays they have heard of, he is asking. What of
all the other plays that most of those who have done
&quot;Eng. Lit.&quot; may have come across? How would *those*
plays be described by them?

In other words, this is not just a clever editing of stuff
that happens to have appeared on the tv listings, but a
cogent and acerbic comment upon the way in which so
many people seem to view Shakespeare these days.

Having said that, and certainly bearing it in mind, here
is my latest version of those two sonnets I added to his.
The present tense in the last line is intended to support
what I *think* is the point that the poet was making.

A mad 'moiselle sets England by the ears.
A bully shows a harridan what's what.
A wife and daughter 'die' for sixteen years.
Two pairs of twins completely lose the plot.
A little academe's on hold awhile.
A Hero's death turns out to be a lie.
A ship seems wrecked, but on a magic isle.
A mother eats some rather nasty pie.
A portly knight is shown to be a loser.
A king dies when his stuff's lost in the Wash.
A legal eagle weds a lead box chooser.
A tearaway succeeds and turns all posh.
A duke's unrecognized in friar's gear.
All these and more, apparently, Shakespeare.

A man's friend cheats him while he's out of town.
A princess prophesies both woe and worse.
A banished earl returns and claims the crown.
A troglodyte thinks mankind is a curse.
The Yorks v Lancs 'contention' starts its run.
A countess puts this black guy's father straight.
A duke (eponymous?) dies in Act I.
An exile bets his wife's inviolate.
A king's doc's pleased a countess ain't her Ma.
The late Queen's father struts his Tudor stuff.
A prince's rival is his girl-friend's Pa.
The play when Will (and Fletch?) said &quot;That's enough!&quot;
So, nine-and-thirty plays from Shakespeare's plume?
Let's hope he writes no more - there isn't room!

I started my poem using the tv listings.
I abandoned it for now because February has caught me
short and I've finally gotten deep into T&amp;C. I wanted a
a quatrain each for Chris, Ed, and William with whatever
closing could be found. I could see it was going to take
too much time to &quot;find&quot; the poetry instead of write it.

I wasn't clear with what &quot;a first line&quot; meant, but I
assume it is the lead into each of the blurbs. (I did not
repeat it because it made no sense to me--they are
all first lines because they are full capsulizations I
figured.) So I don't know what is made &quot;very
different&quot; regarding my vs &quot;his&quot; wordings.

There must be many write-ups available to the tv
guide creators to slap onto each scheduled film's intro.
I am certain they rely on studios and networks and
distributors to supply these blurbs. And it is possible
these all came from distributor who concentrates in
Shakespeare films. I had no Shakespeare films
in my tv listings, but with so many subjects
and settings and characters in the plays, many non-
related stories have the same generic descriptions.

I was amazed that the tv listings in my newspaper
used iambic pentameter so heavily -- close to
half of the 20 or so I looked at were precise in
meter as they hit their final words on the
tenth beat. It seems intentional to me now.

Well, the main reason is the space constraints. You can't
tell the story of Lear in 12-20 words, I hope

Yes. Structured to fit our crowded lifestyles and our
little tiny attention spans. I think they are entertaining
unto themselves. If the writers didn't enjoy creating
them (and the writers of these have to know the
plays to isolate the identifying factor) at least Gwynn
and you took it flying.

These new ones are tougher, I'll get at it. Not knowing
some of the plays slows me down. Anyway, they read nicely.
I guess if you toss in three (or five!) poems, you
could round out the 42 lines for 3 sonnets with no
extra lines at all. And you may as well refurnish the
original subjects by Gwynn into a new sonnet unless
you want to share credit with a stranger who happened
to use a different technique than you did.
