This is a rant to all you losers out there on I88 every morning that have
no clue how to MERGE. The reason that there are traffic jams is that when
someone is merging into traffic, 1) the person mergeing does not speed up
to the flow of traffic they just merge in nice and cautiously slow and
make everyone behind them slow down and 2) when someone actually does
pick up speed and moves in then we have the over cautious idiot that
slows down in the lane and makes sure everyone behind them is slowing
down too. I am going to start running you pieces of crap off the road if
you keep getting in my way. LOSERS get off the road and take the train!!!!!

----------------------------------

The more I see stuff like the above... the more I realize that MFFY and
general incompetence is what eventually pushes people to the brink and
they become road rage statistics....

Drivers push -themselves- to &quot;the brink&quot; and &quot;act out&quot; incidents of
road rage because they don't get what they want.  Road rage is
emotionally identical to a temper tantrum of a three year old.

The validity of your source is zilch.  Traffic jams aren't caused by
poor merging, they are caused by too many vehicles in one area.  If
poor merges causes a traffic jam, then traffic was on the verge of
jamming anyway, and your source seeks to blame driving maneuvers they
disagree with.

Your source opines that slower drivers on an interstate &quot;force&quot;
everyone behind them to slow down, when in fact they do not; they
(should) always have the option to change lanes.

I suspect your source subscribes to at least one of two of the
greatest driving fallacies; velocity should remain constant and
drivers should never have to reduce their velocity and/or everyone
within sight should instantly identify me as the best driver who ever
lived (since that is so obvious to all but the brain dead) and drive
as I do.

Additionally, your conclusion that repetition of a spurious conclusion
lends validity speaks for itself... at about 130dB.

Well at least the turd is making progress on the denial front... he's

idiot moving in front of them at half their present speed and then
waiting a long ass time for them to get up to speed.

I rarely have drivers close a gap on me because I am already at speed
before the merge point. I am moving as fast or faster than the driver I
am merging in front of. If that driver does act to close the gap I
maintain his previous speed, he passes by and I merge into the space
behind him created by his acceleration.

The big problem with that particular philosophy is that you can't

Drive much?  The tendency of too many drivers to follow too closely -
is- a problem.

You'd have to assume a lot to come to that conclusion; that a
sufficient gap exists, for one, and that traffic on the highway to the
rear is visible to the merger for more than a few seconds before they
need to make their move to merge.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Well, that's an exaggerration or exceptional example, and not solely
the fault of a driver merging onto a highway zoned at 55.  Generally,
ramps on those highways are insufficient for the average driver to
accelerate to 70, leaving enough room to get safely stopped before the
ramp ends.

If we take into consideration ramp meters, managing to hit 70-75 is
quite impossible for the vast majority of production vehicles.

Uh... if such ramps and acceleration lanes exist in the Chicago area,
they are quite rare... or that Maverick has a 4 barrel 302 and 4:11
gears.

And even with that it seems to me your example would have to place you
always alone, or in front, every time you use an entrance ramp, and
never behind your impaired mergers, so let us conclude that you are
full of shit... as usual, and that impaired mergers are not so
prevalent, or quite the problem that you make them out to be.

It is definitely valid and real.  I see it every day; people
encouraging others to drive poorly and causing only confusion as a
result.  How often have you seen a driver with the right of way at a
four way stop simply sit there waiting for someone else to go, causing
a &quot;courtesy battle?&quot;

Sure you can.  If you suddenly slow in the right lane, you create a
big hole in front of you that's practically an engraved invitation for
a driver on an onramp to come in in front of you.  And far too many
people do that.

Not at highway speed.  Only the rare asshole will follow SO closely
that it is simply impossible to merge in between him and the car in

It is odd, then, isn't it, that my F-150 with the raging 300ci six,
slushomatic, 3.08's, and a full load of wood in the bed (last time I
did a dump run I tipped the scales at about 5800 lbs. and that was
with an open bed and the load piled no higher than the bed rails)
seems to have no problem merging into highway traffic.  Even a vehicle
with incredibly poor power to weight ratio can generally accelerate up
to an acceptable speed if the driver simply plans ahead and is capable
of pushing the little skinny pedal all the way down.

Which brings us to another bit of idiocy from your past posts, where
you claimed that it was better to come down the ramp slow and
accelerate to fit the gap.  Obviously if you have a poor power to
weight ratio but good brakes it is significantly easier to come in hot
and then brake to fit the gap, because your acceleration from, say,
50-70 will be very poor but if one is at 70 and needs to slow to 60
that can still be done very easily.  e.g. I may only be able to
accelerate at 0.2G or less but I will still be able to brake at 0.7G
or greater if necessary (although that would be extreme and alarming,
you get the point.)

Being behind a poor merger is definitely a problem, and is part of the

Since the troll mentions my maverick, it has 250cid 6, 3spd and 3.00:1
rear end gears. The maverick I had before that had a 200cid 6, 3spd and
2.79:1 gears. I did not have a problem merging in either car. They have
torque and accelerate well enough as they were made in the era of 70mph+
legal speeds on the interstates and the old style short ramps. The
torqueless wonder car I also had little problem with, but I had to start
accelerating in the curve of the ramp (not that I don't do that anyway)
but being force to means that I could fall victim to the asshats that try
to merge at 35 into 70mph traffic. And I encounter those sort of people
rather frequently around here.

The only car I've ever had some trouble merging with was my grandmother's
tempo. I took it out on to the expressway in an effort to diagnois a
problem and the automatic trans just sucked what life the engine had
away.

The troll is intentionally trying to confuse matters. When I am stuck
behind a merge impaired driver, then obviously it doesn't count for the
'gap closing' as I am unable to time the gap because of the merge
impaired driver.

I didn't even notice until I read your post that gpstroll made the
common error of quoting a common rear gear as 4:11 instead of 4.11:1.
It's either 4.11:1 or 37:9; 4:11 has no meaning.

just a pet peeve  (yes Brent you got it right)

You write about as well as you think, and drive.

I assume you mean stuck behind a merge impaired driver on an entrance
ramp.

If you are unaware that maintaining a safe following distance applies
on entrance ramps, that isn't surprising, considering your practice of

You can't time the gap because the merge impaired driver is forcing

&gt; &gt; maybe they are afraid their little 4-banger engines will fly apart
&gt; &gt; under the load (there IS a noticeable increase in noise and vibration
&gt; &gt; in my Civic when I floor it, which might be scary to the typical idiot
&gt; &gt; driver). Whatever it is that's holding these people back, it's NOT a

Spurious conclusion, retard.

I've served as a witness to an accident before, where the officer
asked all the occupants of the vehicle who's driver caused the crash,
where they were going when the accident occurred.

To which they replied &quot;we don't know.&quot;

When asked where they were going, the reply was &quot;we don't know.&quot;

When asked what street they pulled out, the reply was &quot;we don't know.&quot;

Certainly doesn't sound like a group of people who had clear, coherent
thoughts about their motoring activities.

Interestingly enough, as I had the advantage of observing both
vehicles involved in the accident for a reasonable period before they
collided, I noticed the &quot;at fault&quot; driver drives like a large segment
of the locals (ie, no concept of the significance of color red on
signs and signals). Ah well, $crewed over his caddy real good, and the
victim's lawyer had some fun, too. :-)

&gt; &gt; Like your drivers who are perfectly competent and safe to drive 75 in

&gt; &gt; danger of reducing velocity.

&gt; You just like being a rude, MFFY a-hole to everyone else on the road

">

No dumbass, I've just noticed that the velocity of traffic routinely
fluctuates, especially if you're going with the flow and/or following
too closely.  In trucking they call that &quot;letting someone else drive
your rig&quot;.  When you have to adjust to those fluctuations immediately,
the vehicle to your front is controlling your velocity, hence you have
relinquished at least partial control of your vehicle due to
insufficient space to your front.

If I lift off the throttle, and the driver to my rear is, according to
you, &quot;inconvenienced&quot;, it's their own fault for following too close,
not mine.  Either way, fluctuations of velocity are &quot;normal&quot;, and to
be expected.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The more significant problem is the merge impaired driver
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; who can't spot a gap, time a gap, nor accelerate properly.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You'd have to assume a lot to come to that conclusion; that a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sufficient gap exists, for one, and that traffic on the highway to the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; rear is visible to the merger for more than a few seconds before they
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; need to make their move to merge.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Which are true 99.44% of the time, if traffic is moving at a normal
&gt; &gt; &gt; speed.

&gt; &gt; What's &quot;true&quot;...?!

&gt; That a sufficient gap exists, and that there is enough visibility to
&gt; find it in time to properly merge.
">

Again, you contradict yourself yet again.  No sufficient gap exists
for you to change lanes, but there's always a sufficient gap for
mergers.

And your experience with entrance ramps must be severely limited.
They often provide limited visibility to both mergers of approaching
traffic and vice versa.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; merge impaired driver who attempts to merge at 35mph into 70mph traffic

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Well, that's an exaggerration or exceptional example, and not solely
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the fault of a driver merging onto a highway zoned at 55.  Generally,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ramps on those highways are insufficient for the average driver to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; accelerate to 70, leaving enough room to get safely stopped before the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ramp ends.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; am merging in front of. If that driver does act to close the gap I
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; maintain his previous speed, he passes by and I merge into the space
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; behind him created by his acceleration.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Uh... if such ramps and acceleration lanes exist in the Chicago area,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; they are quite rare... or that Maverick has a 4 barrel 302 and 4:11

Wow.  Just wow.

Are you REALLY that stupid?

It's the speed of traffic TO YOUR LEFT that is important.

If they are going faster than you are, which is eminently likely
assuming that everyone is following the rules and playing nice
(otherwise they wouldn't be to your left,) you are
not allowed to change lanes to the left.

This is not only the law, but also common courtesy, neatly summarized by
the phrase &quot;don't cut people off, asshole.&quot;

The way around this is, of course, to speed up to match their speed, but
then you'd be SPEEEEEEEEEEDING and we all know that you never speed, so
there you have it.

Now we all know that KRETP/STKR laws are rarely if ever enforced, but
they are still laws.  I thought you were a law abiding driver?

If traffic to your left is traveling faster than you, and is dense

That is not what the law specifies.  If you need to move left to pass,
you may.  You don't need to cut anyone off to do so, you must always
operate in a safe manner, but delaying traffic for a few seconds to
complete the maneuver is not prohibited by any law.

Your perspectives are simplistic, idealistic, unrealistic, short
