&quot;Museum in Docklands&quot;, Canary Wharf, London
(for map &amp; directions:  )

Food allergy appears to be increasing. Pressure is mounting to reduce
food waste. More consumers want to know where and how their food is
produced. Public concern about contaminants in food is growing.
Meanwhile a single source of food composition data for nutrients and
bioactive compounds is needed to validate the relationships between
dietary habits and diet-related chronic disease.

On 11 October in London, five new EU-funded research projects in the
food area will be launched in London. These European projects, all led
by UK institutions, will address above issues by generating new science
and new collaborations. The presentations will be introduced by
Christian Patermann, Director of Biotechnology, Agriculture and Food of
the Research DG of the European Commission. Then, the five project
coordinators will each present details of the research to be funded,
including scientific research on food allergy such as exploring whether
early signs of predisposition to allergy can be found in the human
genes. Other projects aim to reduce food waste, develop techniques to
verify the origin of food, establish better methods to monitor food
contaminants including pesticides and create a single authoritative
source of food composition data in Europe.

Programme - Tuesday, 11 October 2005

9:30 Registration / arrival
10:30 Speakers

(*) Dr Christian Patermann, European Commission, Director of
Biotechnology, Agriculture and Food research

(*) Prof Chris Elliott, Veterinary Sciences Division, Queen's
University Belfast. Coordinator for BioCop, a project to screen
foodstuffs for multiple chemical contaminants, including pesticides,
toxins and drugs.

(*) Dr Paul Finglas, Institute of Food Research. Coordinator for
Eurofir, a project to develop comprehensive food composition data to
underpin all food and health research throughout Europe.

(*) Dr Clare Mills, Institute of Food Research. Coordinator for
EuroPrevall, which aims to generate research findings to help
individuals, industry and policy-makers manage and reduce food
allergies.

(*) Dr Craig Faulds, Institute of Food Research. Deputising for
coordinator of REPRO (Dr Keith Waldron), a project to develop advance
methods to reduce food waste.

(*) Dr Paul Brereton, Central Science Laboratory. Coordinator for
TRACE, a project to develop methods, e.g. geo- and bio-climatic
mapping, to ensure food can be traced to its source. Some of the work
will focus on &quot;added value&quot; products labelled 'as of designated
origin' or 'organic'.

12:30-14:00 Lunch

Appendix - The 5 projects launched on 11 October 2005

Food allergy -

EuroPrevall aims is to deliver improved quality of life for food
allergic people. More specifically, EuroPrevall will:

(*) Characterise the patterns and prevalence of food allergies across
Europe in infants, children and adults.
(*) Use samples and information from the surveys to identify risk
factors (e.g. environmental, microbial or genetic) and novel predictive
markers (e.g. biochemical and genetic) for food allergy, which would
allow implementation of preventive measures, for example during
pregnancy).
(*) Improve the quality of food allergy diagnosis, reducing the need
for food challenge tests.
(*) Investigate how the food matrix affects allergenicity of foods,
including food processing procedures.
(*) Determine the impact of food allergies on the quality of life and
its economic cost for food allergic people and their families,
workplace and employers, and healthcare.

EuroPrevall involves 16 European member states, Bulgaria, Switzerland,
Iceland and Ghana.

Food waste -

Food processors and producers are under increasing pressure to reduce
their disposal of surplus co-products. Such residues are biologically
complex, and if discarded as waste can often be environmentally
unfriendly, and often microbiologically unstable.

Around 3.4 million tonnes of spent grain from the brewing industry and
over 1 million tonnes of vegetable trimmings from the vegetable
processing industry (Eurostat) are produced in the EU every year. Their
improved exploitation will:

(*) Reduce the environmental impact of food waste (reducing landfill,
lessening noxious residues and odours)
(*) Enhance the sustainable management of organic matter from food
production and processing;
(*) Contribute to integrated resource and waste management
(*) Promote environmentally-friendly processing methods
(*) Increase industrial competitiveness
(*) Provide natural ingredients for the food and feed industries
(*) Contribute to food quality and safety

Food origin and authenticity -

TRACE aims to improve the health and well-being of European citizens by
delivering improved traceability of food products along entire fork to
farm food chains. TRACE will develop cost effective analytical methods
integrated within sector-specific and generic traceability systems that
will enable the determination and the objective verification of the
origin of food.

TRACE will also assess European consumer perceptions, attitudes, and
expectations regarding food production systems and their
ability-to-trace food products, together with, consumer attitudes to
designated origin products, food authenticity and food fraud. A
programme of demonstration activities performed by the food industry
will critically appraise of the developed traceability systems to
ensure they are cost effective and fit for purpose. Technology transfer
activities will train industry, regulatory bodies and analysts in the
new systems and methods.

The project involves 47 European organisations from 12 EU Member States
and 3 Associated Countries plus one third Country (China) and has a
budget of €18.9 million (EC funding €11.96 million). The
organisations comprise of research institutes, universities and private
companies (of which 12 are SMEs).

The applicability of the project to the consumer and industry will be
assured through the combination of an Independent Advisory Board and
Observers. These represent major stakeholders, industry and consumers
associations and will ensure that the outputs of the project are
relevant and meet the needs of consumers and industry alike.

Food contaminants -

The BioCop initiative, led by Professor Chris Elliott from the
Veterinary Sciences Division, of Queen's University and the
Department of Agriculture and Rural Development, has received EU
funding of £6.7 million to screen a variety of foodstuffs for multiple
chemical contaminants, including pesticides, toxins and drugs. It is
believed this is the largest food safety project of its kind in the
world.

The research team from Northern Ireland will be joined in the five-year
project by 32 partners from 15 European countries as well as Canada in
an effort to develop new technologies which will help ensure that any
hidden dangers in many foods are detected long before being consumed by
the public.

The unique initiative involves the use of highly novel techniques aimed
at 'finger printing' foodstuffs to discover if they contain any
chemical contaminants.

Food composition data -

EuroFIR (The European Food Information Resource Network) is a five-year
project funded by the European Union's Sixth Research Framework
Programme. EuroFIR aims to build and disseminate a comprehensive,
coherent and validated databank to provide a single, authoritative
source of food composition data in Europe for nutrients, and newly
emerging bioactive compounds with potential health benefits. Data on
the composition of foods are essential for a variety of purposes in
many fields of work, for example this information will be used by food
manufacturers and producers, to calculate nutrient values for food
labelling purposes.
