I'm interested in what a state and/or locality might theoretically do
if there's a law at a higher level that they disagree with.

For example, assume that the San Francisco decides that the current
drug laws are a crock.  Some of those laws are purely federal and
enforced by the DEA, but some are state and normally enforced by
the SFPD.  So the city council passes an ordinance that says that
those sections of the California Penal Code are the absolute lowest
priority for the Police and other public safety agencies in the city.
*Any* other activity has higher priority -- as long as there's any
unanswered call anywhere in the city, any work they can do, they are
to do that first -- even leave a drug arrest in progress to answer a
parking enforcement call.

And since the City and County of San Francisco are the same entity,
they could also order the DA to give lowest priority to drug cases.
In practice I think that would mean they would have to be nolle
prosse'd, or perhaps allowed to be dismissed for failure to provide a
trial in the legally required time frame.

What could the state do?  Can they order an incorporated city to
change its priorities.  I suppose the CHP can go in and do drug
enforcement, but I doubt they have very many CHiPs to spare from their
usual duties (policing the state's freeways).  And the state Attorney
General could, in theory, remove cases from the county's DA and handle
them in his office.

What else can the state do?  What else can the city do to vitiate a
law they don't like?

And what can a state do about a US law they don't like?  Out-and-out
nullification isn't allowed -- that was settled in the 18th century.
But they can (I think) refuse to cooperate with the DEA/FBI on those
cases.  Can they go further?  Could San Francisco have its police
monitor DEA radio frequencies and show up at drug busts in the city?
They wouldn't be allowed to interfere with the DEA agents, but I would
think they could order their police to show up, record and photograph
are preserved, no?

Any other ideas?  What else could a state or city do?  What could the
higher-level government entity do in response, either to force the
lower-level government to enforce the law, or to dissuade it from its
current course of action?

For discussion purposes, assume that the federal and state constitutions
are followed, rather than that some sort of super-executive privilege or
&quot;it's an emergency&quot; override of normal procedure (like the so-called
USA PATRIOT acts).

Barry,

You ask what local government can do about laws it does not want to
enforce? The answer is that they do not enforce those laws. Around here
almost naked ladies strut around in establishments that serve alcohol. There
are a number of laws that may be used to harass the ladies and the
establishments. The local DA (elected at the county level) made it clear
(quite publicly, this was some years ago) that he would not prosecute such
cases. He was re-elected several times. Eventually attitudes changed, he
moved on, and a DA was elected who closed down a bunch of the bars.
Note that the law did not change, only the enforcement. This is quite
common.
The DA is locally elected but he technically works for the State-wide
elected AG. The AG can over-ride the DA by appointing a special prosecutor
to deal with naked ladies. Then such cases will be prosecuted, but only if
the local police decide to start arresting the naked ladies. The local
police work very closely with the local DA and do not want to piss him off.
I imagine it's the same everywhere. Note that this system encourages
corruption.
You ask whether a local police force can interfere with another police
force's prosecution of cases. Once again I'm left wondering if you read the
newspapers. The answer is yes, and it does happen. People have been informed
that the business needs to be really, really clean on Wed. because that's
when the door will be kicked in.

Good luck,
Dave M.

In Massachusetts District Attorney is an elected position.
The county government, in those few counties which still
have government, has no direct authority to set policy.

We have prosecutorial nullification already, not as much for
controversial laws like drug possession as for unpopular laws
with tenure.  You don't see much prosecution for adultery.
Rape charges are rarely brought when he's 16 and she's 15.
Police do it too: bicyclists are rarely charged with traffic
law violations and pedestrians almost never are.  Enforcing
speed limit laws as written is highly unpopular and rarely
done in the United States.  I don't mean writing a lot of
tickets or writing for small amounts over the limit.  I mean
really enforcing the letter of the law.  In Victoria, Australia
there are cameras that ticket substantially every vehicle that
passes at 3 km/h (2 mph) or more over the limit.

Except where certain state constitutions allow otherwise, city governments
are merely creations of the state government, which grants these governments
their charter.  They are subject to the control of the unitary authority of the
state government, which can, in theory, do anything up to and including
revoking their charter and directly exercising authority over the city.

They are more likely to exercise less drastic measures, however, such as
suing the mayor or police chief asking the court for a writ of mandamus
ordering them, essentially, to do their job.  I can't think of a case offhand
of a city government being dissolved involuntarily, perhaps because doing
so would be extremely unpopular.

In actuality, the power of a city government to be obstructionist, drag
their feet, do a poor job of enforcing a law even if ordered to enforce it
by a court, or otherwise weaken policies they don't like is likely to exist
to some extent, unless and until it becomes something about which the
state government feels compelled to expend a lot of effort bringing
the city government to heel.

But in theory, the city government IS simply a smaller unit of the state
government, cf. Dillon's Rule, Hunter v. Pittsburgh, 207 U.S. 161 (1907),
etc.

Who's &quot;they&quot;?  In San Francisco the DA is an elected official and as I
understand it does not answer to the city/county executives (mayor and
supervisors).

However, something of this sort actually happened not far from San
Francisco.  In the 90s, a man named Norm Vroman was elected district
attorney of Mendocino County on a platform of refusing to prosecute
marijuana cases (perhaps it was just &quot;minor&quot; marijuana cases).
Unfortunately the county sheriff, also an elected official, had not
run on any such platform.  This led to an awkward situation where the
sheriff would keep arresting people for possession, only to have the
DA dismiss the charges.  I don't know how it eventually settled out,
but I don't recall hearing about the state getting involved.  The DEA
presumably continued their activities as usual.

I could be misremembering this, and I can't find much online to verify
it.  Most of what I found about Norm Vroman talks about his work to
legalize medical marijuana, but as I recall it went further than that.

I think Wallace used the National Guard at the University of Alabama.
He used state troopers to close Tuskegee High School.

Wallace moved his troopers to Birmingham, but he didn't use them to close
the schools there.  After the start of civil unrest (prompted by a
bombing), Wallace used the violence as an excuse to close the schools.

The Alabama state constitution gave Wallace no direct authority over
local schools, and local school officials were reportedly none too happy
with the Governor's grandstanding.  But Wallace's claim of authority
gave federal judge Frank Johnson the excuse to hold Wallace responsible
for seeing that federal desegregation orders were obeyed.

them.)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

My recollection, and I could be wrong, is that Kennedy federalized
them when they were somewhere else, not there, and used them to keep
peace at the school.  Probably is slick, in that it took them away
from Wallace and it's harder for big fights to start between an
Alabama crowd and troops who are also from Alabama.

I suppose everyone here knows about this but I feel like mentioning
Wallace's eventual repentance, and the time he spent iiuc going to
many black churches to apologize directly.

You should read the other articles on this thread.  Perhaps the term I
should have used is &quot;vitiate&quot;: to render ineffective.  If the
higher-level government is dependent on a lower level to enforce the
law, there is little they can do if the lower level chooses to expend
its limited resources on other matters.

Perhaps one good example would be the &quot;double-nickel&quot; -- the law
requiring a maximum speed limit of 55 everywhere throughout the
states.  Of course, the Federal government does not have direct
jurisdiction over state highways (including the &quot;Interstate Highway
System&quot;, built by the states with mostly Federal money).  So Congress
put in a clause that states had to enact that limit or lose their
share of Federal highway construction money.

So the state legislatures duly enacted a 55 MPH maximum speed limit.
And motorists ignored it, and state and local police had other things
to worry about.  So Congress then required states to measure the
speeds on highways and keep a certain percentage of traffic below a
stated value.  That resulted in some enforcement, but speeds on rural
interstates still averaged well over 65(*) (by my observation on the
I-5 through California's Central Valley).  Eventually the public grew
so weary of this charade that the state of Montana told Congress where
they could put their highway money, and the double-nickel was repealed
a few years later.

(*) Excluding multi-part vehicles like tractor-trailer rigs.

By posting 70 miles per hour on an Interstate Nevada staged a revolt
that lasted the two hours it took for the federal government to inform
the state that no more money would be forthcoming.  Armed with a live
controversy, Nevada went to court and lost.

Montana's resistance was a $5 ticket for waste of resources for
those driving at a safe speed over 55.  Several other states had
speeding tickets with no &quot;points&quot; for speeds between 55 and the
former speed limit.  Some are still on the books.  Michigan's law
was invalidated a year or two ago due to a procedural error in
its passage many years earlier.

By the early 1990s the level of dishonesty in the certifications
of compliance with the national speed limit was rising and eventually
the Federal Highway Administration would have been forced to stop
looking the other way and start taking away money.  As of 1995
states were officially permitted to lie by up to five miles per
hour -- thus explaining the reported rise of speeds after speed
limits went up and there was no motive to lie -- and were unofficially
permitted to measure speed right after a visible speed trap.

What finally killed the national speed limit was a combination
of the Republican takeover of Congress, lobbying by the National
Motorists Association, and the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration's failed attempt to suppress a report it sponsored
that, contrary to the agency's intent, found that the numbers on
speed limit signs didn't really do anything.  The people would
have gone on agreeing that dangerous speeds over 65 must never
be tolerated as long as they were each individually permitted to
keep driving 70-75.

Although the national speed limit was repealed, the attitude it
created remains.  In most places the numbers on speed limit signs
have no relation to the safe speed or the speed which will result
in a speeding ticket.  The signs are merely decorative.
