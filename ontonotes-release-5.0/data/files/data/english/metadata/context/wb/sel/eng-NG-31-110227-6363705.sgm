So, in an effort to switch topics in a manner that will inevitably
return us to more of the same, I was wondering what everyone's take on
the Sokal hoax is.  We are talking about constructivism for the next
two weeks in my phil of science class, and there is one day where we
cover the Sokal hoax.  Pat's figure skating joke made me laugh, but
I'm not sure if he or the rest of you are familiar with this, so allow
me to try and give as unbiased an account of this event as I can, just
so everyone knows what happened.  PLEASE, no one take this as a
personal or professional attack on their position.  I just want to
know what your initial visceral reactions to this are, from each of
your own perspectives, in order to help me prepare to talk about this
in my class.

In 1996, Social Text, the leading journal in the field of cultural
studies, a postmodern quasi-academic journal dedicated an entire issue
to rebutting the charges that cultural-studies critiques of science
were founded on misuse and misunderstanding of techincal language,
that these critiques were riddled with incompetance, and basically
that cultural studies (especially when it went into science criticism
mode) was just a bunch of bullshit wrapped in grandiose language.  In
this special issue, after receiving the approval of five senior
editors, a paper by a fairly prominent physicist from NYU appeared
entitled "Transgressing the Boundaries: Toward a transformative
hermeneutics of quantum gravity."  This article was a hoax, a parody
of the types of articles that appeared in the journal, riddled with
citations from radical left-wing postmodern favorites like Althusser,
Bloor, Chomsky, Deluze, Derrida,  Feyerabend, Ginzburg, Harding, Kuhn,
Lacan, Latour, Lyotard, Ross (one of the editors of the journal), de
Sousa Santos, Smolin, Woolgar and Zizek as well as many famous living
and dead physicists including Bohr, Heisenberg, Einstein, Wheeler,
Weinburg, and Sokal himself.  All totaled there was over 150 citations
in this relatively short article (which can be found in full at
http://www.physics.nyu.edu/faculty/sokal/transgress_v2/transgress_v2_... )

The paper, by Alan Sokal, was intentionally crafted to begin by
soothing the editor's obvious biases with a fancy sounding critique of
modern scientists for (to quote the article we are reading about the
Hoax) "continuing to cling to the 'dogma imposed by the long post-
Enlightenment hegemony over the Western intellectual outlook': that
there exists an external world, whose properties are independant of
human beings, and that humans can obtain reliable, if imperfect and
tentative knowledge of these properties 'by hewing to the 'objective'
procedures and epistemological strictures prescribed by the (so-
called) scientific method'."

Sokal's essay itself was riddled with non-sequiturs.   For example,
after noting that in quantum mechanics "a complete elucidation of one
and the same object may require diverse points of view" he moves to
saying "in such a situation how can a self-perpetuating secular
priesthood of credentialed 'scientists' purport to maintain a monopoly
on the production of scientific knowledge? ... The content and
methodology of postmodern science thus provide powerful intellectual
support for the progressive political project, understood in its
broadest sense: the transgressing of boundaries, the breaking down of
barriers, the radical democratization of all aspects of social,
economic, political and cultural life."  He then goes on to insist
that this can only be achieved within the framework of a truly
liberatory mathematics (whatever that means), noting that: "Just as
liberal feminists are frequently content with a minimal agenda of
legal and social equality for women and are 'pro-choice,' so liberal
(and even some socialist) mathematicians are often content to work
within the hegemonic Zermelo-Fraenkel framework (which, reflecting its
nineteenth-century origins, already incorporates the axiom of
equality) supplemented only by the axiom of choice.  But this
framework is grossly insufficient for a liberatory mathematics, as was
proven long ago by Cohen 1996."

Now anyone who knows what ZFC set theory is should immediately think
that the connection between pro-choice feminists and the axiom of
choice is not much more than a linguistic accident.  The axiom of
choice simply states that given a collection of mutually exclusive
sets, there is always another set consisting of exactly one member
from each set.  Even if this strange wordplay in the first sentence
could somehow be made sense of, Cohen's 1996 paper simply shows that
whether or not there is a number between two other particular
transfinite cardinal numbers isn't settled by the axioms of Zermelo-
Fraenkel set theory (without the axiom of choice, I think).  Clearly,
this is non-sense.

As an explanation, co-editors Andrew Ross (yes, there are many of them
apparently) and Bruce Robbins have said that "a non-refereed journal
of political opinion and cultural analysis produced by an editorial
collective ... Social Text has always seen itself in the 'little
magazine' tradition of the independant left as much as in the academic
domain."  But, obviously, even opinion journals should care if what
they publish is intelligible.

So there's what happened, with some slight editorializing.
Reactions?  Thoughts?  Questions?  Or do any of you even care?

Yeah I think the Sokal hoax was neither surprising nor unduly
deserved.  Of course there is nothing these uncritical and
intellectually dishonest postmodern intellectuals like to hear more
than "there is not external world" or "science isnt objective".
Whatever it takes to give their literary disciplines more metaphysical
power and authority.  The appropriation of continental philosphy in
american english departments deserves ridicule.  They don't care about
understanding the philosophical tradition, or what philosophers really
mean, they just want the use philosophy and theory to one-up everyone
else in terms of intellectual authority.  Anyone with half a brain
ought to be at least suspicious when a literary theorist says
"everything is literature", or a mathmatician says "everything is
mathematics" or whatever else.

Of course none of this means that continental or postmodern philosophy
is intrinsically dishonest or inane.  There are surely brilliant,
rigorous, honest, and critical intellectuals working in all
traditions, just as well as there are many dupes who aren't really
intersted in any idea that doesnt reinforce what they already believe.

I don't think rigour or intellectual honesty has intrinsic connection
to any school of thought.  Mutual understanding and conversation about
different sorts of books is a virtue, not adhering to philosophical
principles like "valuing truth and objectivity".

If you disagree with my last claim, Forbes you should take a look at
Rorty's reply to Dennett in "Rorty and his Critics". You have that
book right?

I almost bought a book by Badiou yesterday, it was all shiney and red.
Then I thought "if I do this, I will be forced to admit that pat is
right about something" so I put it down, and bought Kurt Vonnegut's
memoirs and a travel book for India instead.

Colin. The MISappropriation of continental theory in english
departments ought to bother us, just like the MISappropriation of
physics/math etc should. You grossly overgeneralize in your above
statement however, so I really do hope that it is just your usual
overthetop bombastic rhetoric coming out. Not everyone who talks about
Derrida in an english class is a fucking idiot, just the fucking
idiots who do.

Curtis, this reminds me of the discussion I was telling you about
earlier, that we had in social epistemology. We were talking about why
philosophers don't acknowledge sociology as a legitimate challenger
discipline to philosophy, the way psychology is. I think the sokal
hoax goes a long way towards answering that question for me. A lack of
rigour and a hard-on for jargon.

Alan Sokal gets more credit than he deserves. OOOhh wow, he exposed an
academic journal for not proofreading their articles. What does that
have to do with postmodernism or poststructuralism?  How many people
even read academic journals anyway? If I was an editor of that lame
journal "social text" I don't think I'd waste my time proofreading
something that has a readership of five people. I would assume people
are sending legit articles. To fill up their CVs.

By attacking an insignificant academic journal Sokal has convinced
himself that he's launching some kind of crusade against
poststructuralism. Never mind the fact that he'll probably never take
the time to try and understand anything written by Derrida, Foucault,
Nietzsche, or others that get placed in this category.

People like Alan Sokal are not uncommon. We have even seen these types
on our own web board (anyone remember science undergrad?) These are
people who work in a highly specialized field; a field that demands
the practicioner to know specific and exact concepts and terms
exclusive to that field. Most sciences and mathematics fall under this
category -- you can't do physics without knowing very specific
theories, formulas, laws, etc.  Humanities subjects, on the other
hand, don't demand this kind of exactness or specialization; by their
very nature they allow for anyone to enter into a discourse regardless
of how seriously they've studied it. Normally this is a good thing,
but often people will take advantage of this openness, or they will
confuse the lack of specialization/exactness for lack of rigour.
Sokal's criticisms of poststructuralism are simpleminded because he
doesn't believe that it is the kind of topic that needs to be
rigorously studied before having a respectable view. It amounts to
something like saying "you don't understand what I've spent years
studying; but in five minutes I can understand what you've spent years
studying and I can tell you how stupid it is." He'll hide behind the
exclusivity of his own field so he can tell poststructuralists that
they are wrong because "they don't understand science", when really he
is not trying to merely defend "science" -- he's trying to defend
certain philosophical views on the objectivity of truth. Hence the
parody, which was a fucking waste of everyone's time, and all
it did was prove that academic journals are often not proofread; a
truth that probably every phd student already knows.

Everyone, be careful of parodies. They are an easy way to bash
something without having knowledge of it. They are cheap. They often
mark the downfall of a civilization.

Yes my original comments came out a bit one sided and harsh due to my
own frusterated experiences.  Indeed, Mary is right.  There are
rigorous, intelligent, critical, people reading philosophy books and
working in english departments.  They aren't all bad.

And I definately agree with Moe's comments here too.  Moreso than my
own.  Especially the point that "defending science" ultimately amounts
to defending certain philosophical views on objectity and truth.
These are in fact the exact points Rorty makes in his reply to Dennett
- albiet in a less caustic and more friendly way.

Believe it or not - He argued against the "blimpishness" of people who
choose not to enter into conversation and "fuse their horizons", but
would rather just lambast what they won't attempt to understand.

Yeah I'm with Moe.  I don't see what this hoax is supposed to reveal
other than sloppy academic practice at a lower tier journal (big
surprise).  And these kinds of cases are far outnumbered by overly
ambitious researchers in other fields who falsify data and pad their
results in scientific journals every year.  Not to mention that half
the authors on any given scientific article are, by their own
admission if you actually go and ask them, given credit for
contributing very little to a study or experiment.  I was just
recently talking to a grad student in biology who got his name on an
article when his only contribution was cleaning the lab.  He didn't
write or research anything, or help with the experiment except to
sweep up and wash test tubes afterwards.  This kind of thing is pretty
common practice in scientific authorship.  And no one takes exception
to it.

More seriously, though, to suggest as Sokal seems to suggest that good
thinking must meet the criteria followed by scientific authorship is
basically intellectual imperialism, and should be questioned.  He
wants to say that good thinking will follow the model of scientific
thinking.  That's a prejudicial legitimation of what should be taken
to count as good thinking.  It's the same thing that happens when
people insist that analytic methods are the methods proper to
philosophical composition.  Zwicky has very good arguments against
this completely unjustified bias in Lyric Philosophy.

First off, Social Text was apparently a well respected, pre-eminent
cultural studies journal at the time (so says the article we read, but
it could be wrong).

Second, I think a Feyerabendian light might be best put on this case.
As Feyerabend notes, the historical Galileo was in fact a cheat, and a
liar, and if he were found out today he would never be allowed to
practice academic science ever again.  He fudged results, said he did
experiments that he didn't, and all kinds of underhanded stuff in
trying to get his copernican system accepted.  In turn, the Church,
the most powerful defender of the Ptolemaic system, tried him and made
him renounce his theory.  As Feyerabend sees it, this is how science
works best: when the only rule is "anything goes," methodological
anarchy.  Galileo won in the end, and likely would have lost if he
hadn't fudged his results.  So, as I see it (through Feyerabends eyes)
it is both legitimate of Sokal to do this, and legitimate of the
poststructuralist, postmodern, cultural studies community to ignore
Sokal and have loose refereeing practices in order to get their voices
heard by publishing more volumously (if that's what they think will
help).  Still, and interesting intersection of two scientific
paradigms at conflict.  Quite heated indeed.

Finally, when did Moe get so jaded?

Forbes: uh, what 2 scientific paradigms?

&gt; First off, Social Text was apparently a well respected, pre-eminent
&gt; cultural studies journal at the time (so says the article we read, but
&gt; it could be wrong).

&gt; Second, I think a Feyerabendian light might be best put on this case.
&gt; As Feyerabend notes, the historical Galileo was in fact a cheat, and a
&gt; liar, and if he were found out today he would never be allowed to
&gt; practice academic science ever again.  He fudged results, said he did
&gt; experiments that he didn't, and all kinds of underhanded stuff in
&gt; trying to get his copernican system accepted.  In turn, the Church,
&gt; the most powerful defender of the Ptolemaic system, tried him and made
&gt; him renounce his theory.  As Feyerabend sees it, this is how science
&gt; works best: when the only rule is &quot;anything goes,&quot; methodological
&gt; anarchy.  Galileo won in the end, and likely would have lost if he
&gt; hadn't fudged his results.  So, as I see it (through Feyerabends eyes)
&gt; it is both legitimate of Sokal to do this, and legitimate of the
&gt; poststructuralist, postmodern, cultural studies community to ignore
&gt; Sokal and have loose refereeing practices in order to get their voices
&gt; heard by publishing more volumously (if that's what they think will

Except that a non-refereed journal doesn't strike me as one that would
be considered "leading" or "pre-eminent" in any field, but who knows,
it was 10 years ago.  But I don't get the sense that this particular
scholarship community sacrifices standards of peer review in order to
spread The Good Word.  The standards between our respective fields
aren't as disparate as people like Sokal would lead us to believe.  So
try to avoid making these loosely veiled jabs at an entire community
of scholars based on the sloppy practices of one journal.  I could
probably get my name on a scientific paper and draw the same
conclusions.

So I'm jaded because I don't appreciate intellectual dishonesty?
Oh Forbes I'm sorry for criticizing something, pass the joint, lets
not get into this negative vibe... lets spread the peace and love, man!

I hope that when Rorty dies, Colin, they take his skin, and empty out
his entire body cavity, and turn it into a kind of suit. That way you
can get inside of it, and just keep the rorty dream alive. I mean, I
rarely hear you say something he didn't say first, and better, so I
think it would work out quite well.

and moe, I love your hate. I thrive on it.

That's better.

It's not because you're critical ... you just posted like a madman all
of a sudden and seem so angry.

I hear you are moving to Ottowa.  What gives, man?

I would only engage in this fantasy furthur if we find some way to
imbue magical superhero pragmatism powers to the wearer of the
Rortysuit.  Maybe some kind of solidarity energy ray that transforms
philosophy books by Plato or Kant into novels by Nabakov or Orwell?

I'd be careful what you wish for, because I don't think I will be
playing the devil's advocate Rorty regurgitation game for much
longer...  the oedipal patricide is only a matter of time.

Isn't philosophy a kind of madness? Or maybe I'm just missing all of
you guys and I needed to simulate a past phil club debate.

I should be moving to Ottawa by the end of the month; probably going
to do a job in the technical writing field, but I might apply for the
MA program at the University of Ottawa (or Carleton) just in case I
fall prey to my mad, self-indulgent philosophical side.
You got any plans of visiting Ottawa this spring?

Well, I wasn't planning on going to Ottowa - even though my girlfriend
lives there - but now that you AND Hecky are living there maybe I will
come out for a visit.

But yeah, seriously, Jen would castrate me if I didn't come out to
visit her.  So, since I want to keep my balls, I will more than likely
be in Ottowa over the summer and sporadically over the course of next
year.  I will see you there I imagine?

And to give my two cents on your predicament, I think you are one of
the strongest philosophy students I know, especially when you are
debating something you enjoy thinking about.  I think you should go
for grad school: then you can be really overqualified to work at the
post office!  That is, unless you go all the way and get a PhD, which
we all know you could do.
