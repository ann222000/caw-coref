Following Ally Fogg's recent post on multi-cultural Britain, along with the installation of Islamophobia Watch on my blogroll, let's have a wee round-up of recent items on Muslims in Britain.

First of all, this brilliant article in last Friday's Guardian , pointing out the similarity between Britain's attitudes to, and treatment of, Muslims today and its treatment of Jews in the early twentieth century. The parallels are astonishing, including the accusations of international terrorism, complaints about use of religious dress as a mark of separation, along with all the now-familiar rhetoric of a "clash of civilisations and the establishment being in denial concerning the threat in our midst.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The article mentions the Islamophobe's poster-Muslim, Ayaan Hirsi Ali, properly Ayaan Hirsi Magan: the false name was adopted, like so much else in her story, as part of a fraudulent application for asylum in the Netherlands ("fleeing war-torn Somalia", "escaping an arranged marriage" - both lies; I believe she did undergo genital mutilation as a child though, which is horrible enough). Once in the Netherlands she obtained the free education she had come for, and entered on a joint political and literary career. The former saw her rising though the ranks of the far right and calling for more curbs on illegal immigrations, which curbs when implemented resulted in her exposure as a fraud and loss of her Dutch citizenship (see? there is such a thing as poetic justice). Not that you'd know that, or indeed that she left Somalia at the age of six for a comfortable life in Nairobi, in this lazy interview where she is described as a "Dutch-Somali human rights activist". Allowing that she was born in Somalia, one out of three is a little careless, as the only human rights for which Ms Magan has ever had much time are her own. Her literary career certainly gave her cause for concern on that score, as her collaboration with renowned ultra-rightist film-maker Theo van Gogh led to his murder and death threats against her. Now she is passing through London to promote her new autobiography, and gave this interview to the Evening Standard . The basic line is that Islam = fascism, as simple as that. Spouters of racist tosh like Magan apparently see themselves as anti-fascists. Marvellous. Anne Frank and all the other Dutch victims of real fascism would be turning in their graves if they had any.

It's interesting that in the interview she admits to having supported the fatwa against Salman Rushdie back in 1989. She considers this a sign of optimism, because if she can change, so can other Muslims; the change of course being conversion to not being Muslims. Some might consider it more of a case of hypocrisy and bandwagon-jumping: among Kenyan Muslims, she's a bloodthirsty Islamofascist, but when comfortably installed with a bunch of European racists she is reborn as a lover of peace and hater of Muslims.

In the light of that Guardian article, Magan's assertion that "Violence is inherent in Islam â€“ it's a destructive, nihilistic cult of death. It legitimates murder." can be seen as the exact parallel of the old anti-semitic blood libel, that Judaism is by its very nature a murderous cult which kills Gentiles.

One can see why American right-wingers (every one a purveyor of freedom and the American way ) took so strongly to her when she'd been given the bum's rush by the Dutch. Though why we would allow her into Britain to spread her poison here, God only knows.

My favourite moment in the Evening Standard interview: when this brave champion of liberty has a sudden burst of panic at the thought that she might actually still be in Britain when the interview is published. Talking big about the evils of Islamofascism is one thing; sticking around to take responsibility for her lies quite another. She's like a kid with a spray-can writing "Pakis Go Home" on a mosque (or maybe a Sikh Gurdwara - nice distinctions and inconvenient facts aren't such people's strong points) and then legging it before anyone spots her. Champion of human rights? Don't make me laugh. Champion of the drive-by slander, more like. Let's hope it's a long time before America sends her to darken our country again.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Then there's this post concerning the loathsome Michael Gove, the Conservatives' answer to Uriah Heep. It was Gove's repellent mixture of racism. anti-European rants and Zionist extremism in his columns in the Times that drove me away from that paper, of which I had been a reader for about twenty-five years. That he is the Conservative MP for Surrey Heath shows, I think, the difficulty David Cameron will have in passing off his party as one of
caring multiculturalism. This week, Gove has been spouting rubbish about Dr Muhammad Naseem, which is almost funny, as one of the few things I knew already about Dr Naseem was that he was praised by both Tony Blair and the police in the aftermath of the July 7th bombings for his condemnation of violence and attempt to calm the situation down.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Finally, this reminds us that despite all the rhetoric surrounding the supposed plot to kidnap and behead a British soldier, that's all it is: rhetoric. Here is a post from the Guardian 's commentisfree blog. I was actually looking for the Moazzam Begg post (or comment) on the raid printed in Friday's Guardian , where Begg (a Briton formerly held as a political prisoner in Guantanamo who was fortunate enough to be released) wrote:

The growing scepticism with which such headline-grabbing plots are met even has the police calling for a calm and responsible approach.

A lot of that has to do with the track record of at least some of the high-profile cases: the ricin plot, in which there was no ricin; the Forest Gate raids, where an innocent man was shot; and, most disturbing, the killing of Jean Charles de Menezes.

Most of the comments on Azzam Tamimi's post are the usual Islamophobery. But someone linked in this quote from Craig Murray (also on my blogroll ) written in the wake of the famous "plot" to blow up transatlantic aeroplanes using iPods and baby milk, or whatever it was. It's difficult to remember, as the story changed so often and not a scrap if evidence was ever produced to support any of it. Anyway, Murray (former British ambassador to Uzbekistan, kicked out for voicing concerns over Uzbek human rights at a time when Blair wanted to cosy up to the dictator there) had this to say last August - and it's just as true and relevant six months on:

In all of this, the one thing of which I am certain is that the timing is deeply political. This is more propaganda than plot. Of the over one thousand British Muslims arrested under anti-terrorist legislation, only twelve per cent are ever charged with anything. That is simply harrassment of Muslims on an appalling scale. Of those charged, 80% are acquitted. Most of the very few - just over two per cent of arrests - who are convicted, are not convicted of anything to do terrorism, but of some minor offence the Police happened upon while trawling through the wreck of the lives they had shattered.
