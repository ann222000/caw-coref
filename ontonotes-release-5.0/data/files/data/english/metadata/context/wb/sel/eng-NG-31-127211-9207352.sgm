I already seen the show here in Cleveland but with Megadeth warming up, not
Alice and Queensryche. In fact I seen all 4 bands before but Â todays &quot;Heaven
and Hell&quot; was of course Black Sabbath Mach 3 (No Ozzy or Bill Ward) back in
the day. Even tho it was their first without Ozzy &quot;Heaven and Hell&quot; (Ward
actually drummed on the album so it was 3/4 original Sabbath, but Ward quit
during the tour do to stress and alcohol abuse) was a great album and has
stood the test of time to become a classic album, as evidenced by Iommi and
co selling out Radio City Music Hall in 45 minutes.

The addition of Alice is worth another viewing. Cold Ethyl will want
in on this.
