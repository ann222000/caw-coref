Because the Chinese told Jeff and producers it is not religious ceremony. It
is partially true. First, there is no God in Buddhism. But there are Buddha.
And Buddha are human beings enlightened.

Second, there is no worship in Buddhism, actually it forbids worship. But
like any religion, people do what they want to do and they interpret their
sacred book from ancient time to fit their needs. There is no worship but
there is &quot;welcome ceremony&quot; because there is no better way to show their
belief by kneeling in a ceremony. Actually I have never seen any
non-believers do the bow and kneel &quot;welcome ceremony&quot; except these 16
suckers conned to pledge to the Buddha. Hehe.

Come on Ar Q, you _know_ that MB set this up with the monks
(and no doubt made a cash offering to make it happen) to get a
reaction out of the Christian-fundi he knew he cast this season.

JP's comment that this somehow wasn't a religious ceremony is the
clincher and was done to guarantee that she would at least go along
with it for a little bit.

There are differences between &quot;honor&quot; &quot;respect&quot; and &quot;worship&quot;,
and &quot;submission&quot;

This was supposed to have some of the first two and none
of the last two.  Some folks can't seem to tell the difference.

Then, if what you say is true about Buddha then any Christian would refuse
to bow down to any human being if they truly are Christian. She did right
but maybe for the wrong reasons. He mouth makes Christians look bad. How can
you have a personal relationship with Jesus Christ and not be religious?
Bad way to put it.

Jeff didn't say it wasn't a religious ceremony.

He said it wasn't a *worship* ceremony.

Even if Buddhists happened to worship deities (which they don't in
unadulterated Buddhism that hasn't been mixed with local religions
like Shintoism), the mere fact that the event took place in a temple
and was run by monks does *not* make it a worship ceremony.

Otherwise, playing bingo at a church, with nuns calling out the
numbers, with candles lit around the room for mood lighting and
pictures of saints and Mary and Jesus decorating the room, with the
ritualistic spinning of the tumbler, calling out of numbers, and
shouting of &quot;bingo!&quot;, would somehow suddenly mean that you are also
necessarily engaged in the worship of God.

The physical surroundings are utterly irrelevant.  If it's not in your
heart, it's not worship.

Would you call a Japanese tea ceremony religious as well? There are mats
and bowing and prescribed rites that must be observed to perform it
properly.  Different culture, different meanings to actions.

I can only give you an anecdote from my own experience...

I used to live in an apartment complex with a young couple and their
son, who were scientologists...I walked past their apartment one day to
see their 5 or 6 year old son banging his head repeatedly against the
glass of their front window - I immediately banged on their door in
alarm, they answered after a couple of minutes ( the door was right next
to the window and the kid just kept on banging his head against the
cheap apartment glass the whole time ). The boy's father answered the
door, and I could see his mother sitting on the couch a little way
inside the room, just a few feet from the kid. I asked them if they knew
that their child was about to injure himself badly...perhaps even
fatally, if the glass cut his throat when it shattered. Their answer to
me was...wait for it...

&quot;We are Scientologists and our Son is has achieved 'Clear' status...we
no longer have the right to tell him what to do.&quot; &lt; door slam &gt;

Remember - the kid was no more than 6 years old! I won't tell you what I
did next...but I hope this gives you some idea of the kind of
'hocus-pocus' ( I would have called it brain dead lunacy ) involved. I
told this story to another scientologist years later, just to see if it
might have been a one-off kind of incident, and his response was: &quot;Well,
if the child was really a 'Clear'...&quot; !!!

Your explanation is:

If you think you are sinning, then you are sinning.

The problem with that explanation is that it boils down to:  Leslie had an
incorrect thought, so thus her incorrect thought is justified.  It really is
no different than Todd claiming that he is following the Mormon way of life
and that God wouldn't really care if he was gay.  At that point, they aren't
worshipping anything more than their own value system.  If their own value
system is somehow worthy of unquestionable status, then so is everyone
else's.

It doesn't 'matter', until someone else comes along and claims that people

I'll grant you that no one knows what God thinks.  Maybe you should grant me
that the Moron religion tells its followers that homosexuality is wrong.
Therefore, one cannot claim to be a 'good Mormon following the Mormon way of
life' unless they actually follow their Mormon teachings.  Making up their
own belief system isn't 'being a Mormon'.

&gt;&gt; What is it that Scientoligists believe that is 'hocus-pocus'?

&gt;I can only give you an anecdote from my own experience...

&gt;I used to live in an apartment complex with a young couple and their
&gt;son, who were scientologists...I walked past their apartment one day to
&gt;see their 5 or 6 year old son banging his head repeatedly against the
&gt;glass of their front window - I immediately banged on their door in
&gt;alarm, they answered after a couple of minutes ( the door was right next
&gt;to the window and the kid just kept on banging his head against the
&gt;cheap apartment glass the whole time ). The boy's father answered the
&gt;door, and I could see his mother sitting on the couch a little way
&gt;inside the room, just a few feet from the kid. I asked them if they knew
&gt;that their child was about to injure himself badly...perhaps even
&gt;fatally, if the glass cut his throat when it shattered. Their answer to
&gt;me was...wait for it...

&gt;&quot;We are Scientologists and our Son is has achieved 'Clear' status...we
&gt;no longer have the right to tell him what to do.&quot; &lt; door slam &gt;

&gt;Remember - the kid was no more than 6 years old! I won't tell you what I
&gt;did next...but I hope this gives you some idea of the kind of
&gt;'hocus-pocus' ( I would have called it brain dead lunacy ) involved. I
&gt;told this story to another scientologist years later, just to see if it
&gt;might have been a one-off kind of incident, and his response was: &quot;Well,
&gt;if the child was really a 'Clear'...&quot; !!!
">

Now you have me curious!! What did you do?? And BTW why was the kid
doing this in the first place??

Oh. no...  far from it.

Scientology is based on L.Ron Hubbard's teachings in the book
&quot;Dianetics,&quot; which is more a psychology text than anything religious.
It's LRH's theories about how to rid yourself of all the crap that you
carry around in your head that weighs you down, in a nutshell.  Now
whether those theories are valid and/or accurate, that;s a topic for
discussion.

&gt;&gt; religious worship?

&gt; Bowing in Eastern culture is simply a sign of respect.  They bow to each
&gt; other the way we shake hands.

Not if it's to a statue of the Buddha. To the Chinese that's considered
&quot;bai-bai&quot; (worship).

&gt; The same way that bowing before the Japanese Prime Minister isn't
&gt; religious worship.

The Japanese Prime Minister is a living human being; the Buddha statue is a
religious icon. Anyway, in China, unlike Japan, people don't usuyally bow
before others except as an act of veneration or worship (e.g. to show filial
piety to parents, fealty to emperors, veneration to cult leaders, worship to
gods, etc.).

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism

Buddhism is often described as a religion[1] and a collection of various
philosophies.[2] To many, however, Buddhism is a set of spiritual
teachings and practices rather than a religion.[3] [4] Buddhism is also
known as Buddha Dharma or Dhamma, which means roughly the &quot;teachings of
the Awakened One&quot; in Sanskrit and Pali, languages of ancient Buddhist
texts. Buddhism was brought into being around the 5th century BCE by
Siddhartha Gautama, hereafter referred to as &quot;the Buddha.&quot; [5]

Origin

Siddhartha Gautama is believed by Buddhists to have been born in
Lumbini, Nepal[6] and raised in Kapilavastu near the present-day
Indian-Nepalese border.[7] The traditional story of his life is as
follows; little of this can be regarded as established historical fact.
Born a prince, his father, King Suddhodana, was supposedly visited by a
wise man shortly after Siddhartha was born and told that Siddhartha
would either become a great king (chakravartin) or a holy man (Sadhu).
Determined to make Siddhartha a king, the father tried to shield his son
from the unpleasant realities of daily life. Despite his father's
efforts, at the age of 29, he discovered the suffering of his people,
first through an encounter with an elderly man. On subsequent trips
outside the palace, he encountered various sufferings such as a diseased
man, a decaying corpse, and an ascetic. These are often termed 'The Four
Sights.'[8]
Gautama, deeply depressed by these sights, sought to overcome old age,
illness, and death by living the life of an ascetic. Gautama escaped his
palace, leaving behind this royal life to become a mendicant. For a time
on his spiritual quest, Buddha &quot;experimented with extreme asceticism,
which at that time was seen as a powerful spiritual practice...such as
fasting, holding the breath, and exposure of the body to pain...he
found, however, that these ascetic practices brought no genuine
spiritual benefits and in fact, being based on self-hatred, that they
were counterproductive.&quot;[9]
After abandoning asceticism and concentrating instead upon meditation
and Anapanasati (awareness of breathing in and out), Gautama is said to
have discovered what Buddhists call the Middle Way‹a path of moderation
that lies mid-way between the extremes of self-indulgence and
self-mortification. He accepted a little milk and rice pudding from a
village girl and then, sitting under a pipal tree or Sacred fig, (Ficus
religiosa), now known as the Bodhi tree in Bodh Gaya,[10] [11] he vowed
never to arise until he had found the Truth. His five companions,
believing that he had abandoned his search and become undisciplined,
left. After 49 days meditating, at the age of 35, he attained bodhi,
also known as &quot;Awakening&quot; or &quot;Enlightenment&quot; in the West. After his
attainment of bodhi he was known as Buddha or Gautama Buddha and spent
the rest of his life teaching his insights (Dharma).[12] According to
scholars, he lived around the fifth century BCE, but his more exact
birthdate is open to debate.[13] He died around the age of 80 in
Kushinagara (Pali Kusinara)(India).[14]
