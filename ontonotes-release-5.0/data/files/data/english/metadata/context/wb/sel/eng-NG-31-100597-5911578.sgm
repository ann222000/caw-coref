2. Non-Series Novels &amp; Collection

These novels were written before Terry's success with the Discworld,
though the revised edition of The Carpet People was - not exactly
re-written - later (Terry describes it as a collaboration between two
authors, both called Terry Pratchett...).

h/cvr blurb:

There is magic in every carpet. Cities and villages exist right
under your feet and the people who live in them are so small that
each tuft of wool stretches high above them like giant trees. A
grain of sugar which has somehow found its way into the world of
the carpet people, becomes a favourite mountain for the carpet
animals where they go as often as possible. Dust plants make up a
wonderful vegetation, and the world of the carpet people is as
real to them as the earth is to us.

But there are also creatures who live in the underlay; they appear
to be allies of that terrible and powerful Fray who lives above
the carpet. Whenever he passes above, he leaves destruction behind
him in the world of the carpet people, and the creatures of the
underlay try to take advantage of them.

This is the story of Snibril and Glurk, the leaders of the carpet
people and how they finally defeat the servants of Fray. It is
full of magic battles and the day to day struggle of the brave
and ingenious carpet people.

Children of all ages, from 5 to 50 will enjoy this book, and the
world of the Carpet People in the reader's own home will add a
new dimension to his imagination.

h/cvr blurb:

&lt;bold red font&gt;

In the beginning, there was nothing but endless flatness.
Then came the Carpet...

&lt;/bold red font&gt;

That's the old story everyone knows and loves (even if they
don't really _believe_ it). For now the Carpet is home for
many different tribes and peoples - from the empire-building
Dumii, to the nomadic Munrungs, the proud Deftmenes, and the
terrible creatures from the Unswept Regions.  And there's a
new story in the making.

The story of the time when Fray begins to move, sweeping a
trail of destruction across the Carpet.

The story of the power-hungry mouls, saddling up their snargs
and riding to the attack.

The story of Glurk and Snibril, Munrung brothers, who set out
on an adventure to end all adventures when their village is
flattened.

The story that will come to a terrible end - if someone
doesn't do something about it. If _everyone_ doesn't do
something about it...

p/b blurb:

as for h/cvr, with "But now.. ..to many..." for "For now..
..for many..." at start 2nd para; and "..peoples and now
there's a new story in the making. The story of Fray,
sweeping a trail of destruction across the Carpet. The
story of power-hungry mouls - and of two Munrung brothers,
who set out on an adventure to end all adventures when
their village is flattened.

It's a story that will come to a terrible end - if someone
doesn't do something about it. If _everyone_ doesn't do

h/cvr blurb:

_Probability Math:_ the science of foretelling the future. For
Dom Sabalos, heir to an immensely rich family, its forecasts
were curiously contradictory: he would be assassinated, and
_after_ that, find the fabulous, almost mythical, world of the
Jokers, who were only known by a few incredible artifacts
scattered throughout the Galaxy.

Any good P-Mathematician could find out this information. Some-
body certainly wanted to prove P-Math wrong as far as Dom was
concerned, and make sure that once he was dead, he stayed dead. A
robot assassin, with built-in `luck', had been put on his tail,
but what was it that protected Dom every time the assassin
struck?

To be sure, he had an excellent robot servant, Isaac; (class 5
with Man-Friday subcircuitry). a planet (the First Syrian Bank)
as a god-father, a determined and protective grandmother (who
looked as if she had been born aged eighty), a security chief who
even ran checks on himself, and a home world, where a missing
hand was only a minor mishap and even death was not always fatal
- but what protected Dom on his search for the world which he
knew lay on the dark side of the sun:?

p/b blurb:

Dom Salabos had a lot of advantages.
As heir to a huge fortune, he had an excellent robot
servant (with Man-Friday subcircuity), a planet (the First
Syrian Bank) as a godfather, a security chief who even ran
checks on himself, and on Dom's home world even death was
not always fatal.
Why then, in an age when prediction was a science, was his
future in doubt?

h/cvr blurb:

A flat earth? Impossible. Kin Arad is the 210-year-old super-
visor in charge of resurfacing the newly named planet, Kingdom.
When she finds Jago Jalo, a  man who has a cloak of invisibility
and should have died a thousand years ago, in her office, she de-
cides he must have an unusual tale. He has. He knows where such a
world is. It is like the medieval earth . . . almost. Leiv Eriks-
son is setting off for the New World, but he will never find it.
Instead he sails to the edge of the world and its eternal water-
fall.
It is obvious that this `earth' has been built by the Great
Spindle Kings, makers of universes, inventors of the strata mach-
ine and the ultimate in claustrophobes, anmd Jalo lures the human
Kin, the kung Marco Farfarer and the fifty-six-syllable-named
shand better known as Silver, to undertake a voyage of discovery
with him: the rewards must be beyond their dreams . . . or night-
mares.

p/b blurb:

The excavation showed that the fossilized plesiosaur had been
holding a placard which read, "End Nuclear Testing Now". That
was nothing unusual.
But then came a discovery of something which *did* intrigue
Kin Arad.
A flat earth was something new ...

3.  The Nomes Series  (The Bromeliad)

Overtly for children, this series has proved popular for both adults
and children and may be found in either the childrens', or the sf &amp;
fantasy sections of your bookshop - or in both... Diggers has been
made into a cartoon series by Cosgrove-Hall (- see 7.2 for the [o/p]
picture book based on this; and see the AFP-FAQ for more information).
uk editions have cover art by Josh Kirby, with that of the uk omnibus
being taken directly from the central image of the _Truckers_ artwork,
but with completely new and appropriate typography upon a buff, rather
than a bright blue field.

`Outside! What's it like?' Masklin looked blank. `Well,' he said,

`Yes? Yes?' `With, you know, things in it -'

sands of tiny nomes living under the floorboards of a large dep-
artment store, most of whom have never even set eyes upon the
outside world. Things like Day and Night and Sun and Rain don't
really exist, say all intelligent nomes. They're just daft old
legends.

But soon a devastating piece of news is to shatter the nomes' ex-
istence: the Store - their world - is to be demolished...

So it's up to Masklin, the last nome to come into the Store, to
mastermind the unbelievable escape plan that will take all the
nomes into the dangers of the great Outside.

It means they have to think. And they have to think BIG.

And they start to learn who they are and how they came to be
there, and where their fantastic journey must one day take them.

p/b Blurb:

To the thousands of tiny nomes who live under the floorboards
of a large department store, there is no Outside.  Things like
Day and Night, Sun and Rain are just daft old legends.
Then a devastating piece of news shatters their existence:
the Store - their whole world - is to be demolished.  And it's

to mastermind an unbelievable escape plan that will take all

h/cvr blurb:

`In the beginning...Arnold Bros (est. 1905) created the Store.'

When their home, a large department store, was demolished, thou-
sands of tiny nomes made a daring and dramatic escape on a stolen
lorry - and only just in the nick of time. The abandoned quarry
they found was perfect for their needs.

At last they are safe. Or are they?

Soon strange things start to happen. Like the tops of puddles
growing hard and cold, and the water coming down from the sky
in frozen bits. Worse is to come though. The quarry is to be
re-opened - their new home is under threat.

A newspaper cutting sends three brave nomes off on a desperate
mission which, if it succeeds, could lead them all to their ult-
imate home...

Meanwhile, back at the quarry, the remaining nomes prepare to
defend their home against the intruders. But how long will they
be able to keep the humans at bay - even _with_ the help of the
monster Jekub?

p/b blurb:

`And Grimma said, We have two choices. We can run, or we hide.
And they said, Which shall we do? She said, We shall Fight.'

A Bright New Dawn is just around the corner for thousands of
tiny nomes when they move into the ruined buildings of an
abandoned quarry.  Or is it?

Soon strange things start to happen. Like the tops of puddles
growing hard and cold, and the water coming down from the sky
in frozen bits.  Then humans appear and they _really_ mess
everything up.  The quarry is to be re-opened and the nomes
must fight to defend their new home.  But how long will they
be able to keep the humans at bay - even _with_ the help of
the monster Jekub?

Somewhere in a place so far up there is no down, a ship is
waiting to take the nomes home - back to wherever they came
from. With their home in a quarry under threat, one nome -
Masklin - knows that they've got to find a way of contacting
this ship.

It means going to Florida (wherever that is), then getting to
the launch of a communications satellite (whatever _that_ is).
A ridiculous plan. Impossible. But Masklin doesn't know this
so he tries to do it anyway. And the first step is to try and
hitch a ride on a new kind of truck, a truck with wings -
Concorde ...

He doesn't want to cause any trouble. He only wants to steal
one of those space shuttle things. But when you're only four
inches high in a world full of humans, things have a nasty
habit of getting rather complicated...

nothing like he expected. They don't lurch about. They don't
push through walls. They can't even _dance_ like they do in
videos. They're just people -- post-senior citizens -- and
they're always in.

At least, up until now. Now the council want to move them out
so the cemetery can be sold as a building site. But the dead
have learned a thing or two from Johnny. They're not going to
take it lying down... especially since it's Halloween tomorrow.

Besides, they're beginning to find that life is a lot more fun
than it was when they were... well... alive.  Especially if they

h/cvr blurb:

THERE WAS A FLASH OF LIGHT, THE AIR FLICKERED... AND THE WORLD
CHANGED. IT'S MAY 21, 1941, THOUGHT JOHNNY. IT'S WAR.

Mrs Tachyon the bag-lady is not the sort of person you'd normally
_choose_ to hang out with. But when Johnny Maxwell and his friends
find her semi-conscious in an alley, they have to do _something_...
as long it it's not the kiss of life.

The more time Johnny spends with her, the more he finds that Mrs
Tachyon isn't the ranting old nutter everyone thinks she is.
She seems to hold the key to different times, different eras -
including the Blackbury Blitz in 1941. Suddenly _now_ isn't the
safe place Johnny once though it was, as he finds himself bound
up more and more with _then_. And, as time shifts beneath him,
and the shopping mall and TV arials melt into air-raid sirens and
ration books, Johnny wonders just how much changing the past can
really change the future...

This time-stoppingly funny, richly entertaining new adventure from
the master of fantastical and irreverent wit, Terry Pratchett, is
the third in the series about Johnny Maxwell, following _Only You
Can Save Mankind_ and _Johnny and the Dead_.

h/cvr blurb:

According to the Nice and Accurate Prophecies of Agnes Nutter -
the world's only _totally reliable_ guide to the future - the
world will end on a Saturday.
Next Saturday, in fact.
Just after tea.
Which means that Armageddon will happen on a Saturday night.
There will be seas of fire, rains of fish, the moon turning to
blood and the massed armies of Heaven and Hell will sort it out
once and for all.
Which is a major problem for Crowley, Hell's most approachable
demon and former serpent, and his opposite number and old friend
Aziraphale, genuine angel and Soho bookshop owner. They _like_ it
down here (or, in Crowley's case, _up_ here).
So they've got no alternative but to stop the Four Motorcyclists
of the Apocalypse, defeat the marching ranks of the Witchfinder's
army* and - somehow - stop it all happening.
Above all (or, in Aziraphale's case, _below_ all) they need to
find and kill the Antichrist, currently the most powerful creature
on Earth.
This is a shame.
Because he's eleven years old, loves his dog even though it's real-
ly a Satanic hellhound under all that hair, really cares about the
environment and is the sort of boy anyone would be proud to have as
a son. He's also totally invulnerable, and a nice kid.
And if that isn't enough, they've still got Sunday to deal with. . .

Can you recognise a real, unadulterated cat when you see one?
Or have you too grown used to the boring, mass-produced cats
the advertising industry adores?

Real cats never eat from bowls (at least not the ones marked
CAT).

Real cats never wear flea collars . . . or appear on birthday
cards . . . or chase anything with a bell in it.

Real cats do eat quiche. And giblets. And butter. And anything
else left on the table. They can hear a fridge door opening two
rooms away.

Real cats don't need names.  But they often get called them.

- plus: a new episodic discworld story by terry is included in the
book, The Science of Discworld [see 7a.17; this story is illustrative
of some of the main points discussed by ian stewart &amp; jack cohen, but
it is, in my opinion, capable of being read by itself [ppint.]. its
chapters are entitled, but there is no title given for the story as a
whole, which is a story of Rincewind and the wizards of the Unseen
University].

Being Death's apprentice is a good job. Board and lodging, free
use of company horse, and you don't even need time off for your
grandmother's funeral. Looking like a skeleton is not compulsory,
either.

And you meet lots of interesting people. Although, of course, not
for very long.

All in all, it's a job for life.

Well, nearly. It would have been if Mort had remembered that he
wasn't supposed to rescue princesses. After that it all began to
go dead wrong.

Terry Pratchett takes Shakespeare's Macbeth and then turns it up
'till the knob comes off. It's all there - a wicked duke and
duchess, the ghost of the murdered king, dim soldiers, strolling
players, a land in peril. And who stands between the Kingdom and
Destruction? Three witches. Granny Weatherwax (intolerant, self-
opinionated, powerful), Nanny Ogg (down-to-earth, vulgar) and
Magrat Garlick (naive, fond of occult jewelly and bunnies)

Death comes to us all. When he came to Mort, he offered him a job.
But when Mort is left in charge for an evening, he allows his heart
to rule his head and soon the whole of causality and the future of
the Discworld itself, are at rist. Along the way, Mort encounters not
only Death's adopted daughter, Yeabell - who has been 16 for 35 years
and his mysterious man servant Albert - whose cooking can harden an
artery at 10 paces - but also an incompetent wizard with a talking
doorknocker and a beautiful, but rather bad-tempered and dead,
princess.

On Terry Pratchett's Discworld, Death really is a 7 foot skeleton in
a black hooded robe and wielding a scythe. He is also fond of cats,
enjoys a good curry, and rides around the scies on a magnificent white
horse called Binky.

Terry Pratchett's infamous city of Ankh-Morpork is under threat
from a 60-foot-fire-breathing dragon, summoned by a secret society
of malcontented tradesmen.

Defending Ankh-Morpork against this threat is the entire, underpaid,
undervalued City Night Watch - a drunken and world-weary Captain, a
cowardly and overweight Sergeant, a small opportunistic Corporal of
dubious parentage...and their newest recruit, Lance-Corporal Carrot,
who is upright, literal, law-abiding and keen. Aiding them in their
fight for truth, justice and the Ankh-Morporkian way are a small
swamp dragon and the Librarian of Unseen University (who just happ-
ens to be an orangutan).

Stephen Briggs has been involved in amateur dramatics for over 25
years and he assures us that the play can be staged without needing
the budget of Industrial Light and Magic. Not only that, but the
cast should still be able to be in the pub well before closing time.

Scarcely a year on from the events of _Guards! Guards!_, the Ankh-
Morpork City Night Watch find their services are once more needed
to tackle a threat to their city. A threat at least as deadly as a
60-foot dragon, but mechanical and heartless to boot.
It kills without compunction. It is the first gun on the Discworld.

The original Watch - Captain Vimes, Sergeant Colon, Corporal Carrot
and Corporal Nobbs - are joined by some new recruits, selected to
reflect the city's ethnic make-up - Lance-Constables Cuddy (a dwarf),
Detritus (a troll) and Angua (a w..., well, best to find out for

DISCWORLD IS ABOUT TO ROCK...

Deputising for DEATH was never going to be easy, not least when he
has gone walkabout in search of the Meaning of Life - without even
leaving a forwarding address. But for his granddaughter, Susan, it
becomes even more difficult when she breaks one of the cardinal
rules of the family business - don't get involved!

All around the Disc, crowds are shouting out for Buddy Celyn and
The Band With Rocks In. They are in the grip of a new and danger-
ous music and Buddy is under its thumb. It's alive, it changes
people - and it won't fade away.

Grain by grain, Buddy's time is running out and Susan has to save
him - it's not going to be easy when she looks more like the Tooth
Fairy than the Grim Reaper...

The World is Round... And Also Flat!

It's obvious really. Everyone [1] knows it.

The Disc rests on the back of four giant elephants, who in turn stand
on the back of Great A'Tuin, the only turtle to form the basis of an
entire branch of astrophysics.

For the last few years, events on the Discworld have been chronicled
in the works of Terry Pratchett. Fans have learned of the adventures
of Rincewind, the incompetent wizard, Granny Weatherwax, the witch
[known to trolls as "She Who Must Be Avoided]. Captain Carrot the six-
foot dwarf, Archchancellor Ridcully, Susan Sto Helit [granddaughter of
Death], and a cast of strange and unique characters.

Now, thanks to a special arrangement [rumoured to involve Mr Dibbler
of Ankh-Morpork, special consultancy on combat rules from Cohen the
octogenarian Barbarian, and a vampire lawyer], it's time for roleplay-
ers to make their way to the far end of the probability curve and...

THRILL to the distinctive sights, sounds, and smells [especially
smells] of Ankh-Morpork, most dubious city in the multiverse!

Sail the Circle Sea in ursuit of wealth, glory, pirate gold, or a
suntan!

INTERVENE in the on-going racial rivalry of trolls and dwarves [watch
out for flying axes]!

AVOID the attentions of Death, Fate, the Lady, and the Patrician!

WONDER why they bought a second meat pie from Mr Dibbler!]

RUN AWAY from an angry Swamp Dragon [two feet of mindless fury and
high-explosive digestion]!

LEARN why Casanunda [second greatest lover on the Discworld] needs
a stepladder.

Complete with Discworld magic, a guide to the best inns, Things from
the Dungeon Dimensions, Gaspode the Wonder Dog, and a Thousand Eleph-
ants. [Well, maybe we lied about the elephants.]

[1] Except the devout followers of the Great God Om, who firmly be-
lieve it's a sphere.

Three witches on a stormy heath, a king cruelly murdered, a usurper

sound familiar? Add to that a young prince adrift from his rightful
inheritance, a travelling band of thespians, a fool who speaks the
truth, and some jokes - and a play within a screenplay, and you have
the essence of Shakespeare without having to read thirty-seven plays.

All is not well in the Ankh-Morpork Opera House. A ghost stalks
the dark corridors, leaving strange letters for the management
and ... killing people. Granny Weatherwax and Nanny Ogg, two
Lancre witches, investigate, and are soon involved in all kinds
of skulduggery, mayhem and ear-splittingly loud singing.

Terry Pratchett's phenomenally popular Discworld novel, 'Maskerade',
has been skilfully adapted by Stephen Briggs with suitably dramatic
panache. Quirky and original characters, a labyrinthine plot and
numerous witty one-liners make this a treat for Discworld fans and
'uninitiated' theatregoers alike.

GURPS Discworld brought roleplayers to Terry Pratchett's
Discworld (and vice-versa). Now, GURPS Discworld Also
opens new areas of the Discworld's geography and recent
history for adventure.

This book includes:

A Guide to recent events on the Disc, including the Opening
of EcksEcksEcksEcks and the Communications Revolution.

Notes and GURPS packages for five new non-human types
(Bogeymen, Elfkin, Gargoyles, Gnolls and Zombies).

Additional ideas and optional rules concerning Discworld
magic and life at Unseen University.

Templates to make character generation easier, from Bandits
and Student Wizards to Assassins and Small Gods. (As a
bonus, many of these are suitable for use in a wide range
of other fantasy campaigns.)

Campaign settings - four previously undescribed locations
across the Disc, suitable as bases of operation or places
for long adventures.

Adventure ideas, from the Quest for Bananas [1] to Sektober-
fest in NoThingfjord.

All this, and rats, dinosaurs, backpackers, surfers, and a
lot of people called Igor . . .

[1] Much cooler than Fire.

%T The Streets of Ankh-Morpork
%I Corgi
%D 1993
ISBN 0-552-14161-5 (Folded Map and stapled street index in card cover)

Blurb:

Being a concise and possibly even accurate MAPP of the Great
City of the DISCWORLD

Including Unseen University and environs!

Also finest assortment of avenues, lanes, squares, and alleys for
your walking pleasure

"There's a saying that all roads lead to Ankh-Morpork. And it's wrong.
All roads lead away from Ankh-Morpork, but sometimes people walk along
them the wrong way."
from Moving Pictures

Ankh-Morpork! City of One Thousand Surprises (according to the famous
publication by the Guild of Merchants)! All human life is there!
Although, if it walks down the wrong alley, often quite briefly!

The city celebrated in the bestselling Discworld series by Terry
Pratchett has been meticulously mapped for the first time. It's all
here - from *Unseen University* to the *Shades*, from major landmarks
like the *Patrician's Palace* to little-known, er, nooks like *Dwarf
Bread Museum* in *Whirligig Alley*. See the famous streets along
which so many heroes have walked, in some cases quite hurriedly!

As leading Ankh-Morpork entrepreneur C.M.O.T. Dibbler would say:
A snip at any price - and that's cutting our own throat. Well, close.

Blurb:

For the newcomer and the old hand alike the Discworld can be a
fatally confusing planet. From the great city of Ankh-Morpork,
featuring a river you could skateboard across if it wasn't so
knobbly, to the distant Ramptop Mountains and the mysterious
Counterweight Continent, the Discworld is a place where Death
waits around every corner...

For safety's sake, you need a guide.

And here it is. Terry Pratchett and Stephen Briggs, respectively
chronicler and cartographer of the Discworld, have produced the
one and only definitive guide to the flat planet - its geography,
its flora and fauna, its (many) religions, its architecture and
customs, and its outstanding personalities.

What is a Quantum Weather Butterfly? What does Death keep on his
desk? Would you drink Bearhugger's Homeopathic Sipping Whiskey?
How are the kings of Ankh-Morpork different from the kings of Ankh?

Everything the Discworld traveller needs to know is contained in
these pages, together with useful maps and illustrations of
significant places and emblems in this unique world.

Blurb:
They said it couldn't be done. Well, it has been done, proving them
wrong once again. After years of research, cunningly contrived in as
many minutes, the discworld has its map. It takes full account of the
historic and much documented expeditions of the Discworld's feted (or
at least fated) explorers: General Sir Roderick Purdeigh, Lars
Larsnephew, Llamedos Jones, Lady Alice Venturi, Ponce da Quirm and,
of course, Venter Borass.

Now travellers on this circular world can see it all: from Klatch
to the Ramtops, from Cori Celesti to the Circle Sea, from Genua to
Bhanbhanduc. The great cities of Hunghung, Pseudopolis, Al Khali
and, of course, Ankh-Morpork are place with loving care upon this
world which is carried through space by Great A'Tuin.

As Prophesised by Achmed the Mad!
'And lo, it came to pass, the denizens of Perfect Entertainment
did construct a game known to the world as Discworld II. For
forty days and forty nights did the heroes struggle with the
fiendish quests, until finally their occidental lobes were sore,
and they cried out to Jaala, goddess of lateral thinking, parallel
parking, pinball and miscellaneous entertainments, saying "How do
I get bees to sweat?" and "What do I do with the ironing board?"
And the spirit of Jaala moved through the world, and thus was the
Discworld II Strategy Guide created.'
_The Book of Kash (Prophet, 2nd Grade)._

Discworld is a planet rife with danger and magical mayhem and, when
Death disappears, a hero is desperately needed to bring him back.
Unfortunately for everyone Rincewind, the hapless magician, lands the
job ... and with a hero like that you need all the help you can get.

ISBN 0-552-14608-0

Not only an artistic and breathtaking view of Lancre but also
an interesting and informative guide to one of the Discworld's
more, er, picturesque kingdoms.

Granny Weatherwax, Nanny Ogg and Magrat Garlick live there.
Lancre could hardly be somewhere ordinary, could it ?

Magic glues the Discworld together and a lot of it ends up in
Lancre, principal Kingdom of the Ramtop Mountains. Between
Uberwald and Whale Bay, the Octarine Grass Country and the
Widdershins Ocean lies the most exciting and dangerous terrain
in all Discworld. The Ramtops supply Discworld with most of its
witches and wizards. The leaves on the trees in the Ramtops move
even when there is no breeze. Rocks go for a stroll in the even-
ing. Even the land, at times, seems alive.

The mapp may only be two-dimensional, but watch it very carefully
and you might see it jostle about a bit.

365 invaluble facts for the discerning Discworld traveller

The unpredictable fantasy land of Discworld floats through
space on the back of four elephants standing on a turtle. In
this calendar, with text from _The Discworld Companion_ (pub-
lished in 1994/95), Terry Pratchett and Stephen Briggs provide
a wealth of detail to guide the adventurous, yet discerning,
Discworld traveller. With each page, a different aspect of Disc-
world is explored -- its geography, inhabitants, leading citiz-
ens, culture and history. In fact a whole calendar full of inval-
uable facts, from A to Z, that Discworld aficionados cannot
live without.

DEATH'S DOMAIN

It's no more than a breath away...
&lt;/"gothic" style font&gt;

Everyone needs a place to relax after a long day, after all. So
here is the place where the Grim Reaper can kick back and take
the load off his scythe. Here's the golf course that's not so
much crazy as insane, and the useless maze, and the dark gardens
- all brought (incongruously) to life. And here, for the first
time ever, you will find out the reason why Death can't under-
stand rockeries, and what happens to garden gnomes.

As Death rides Binky into the sunset (of other people's lives),
you can at last see what he gets up to when he's not at work.

ISBN 0-09-187477-7

this includes a new discworld story by terry, illustrative of
some of the main points made by ian stewart &amp; jack cohen; the
individual chapters have titles, but none is given in the book
for the story as a whole. the story occupies approximately one
third of the book, its chapters alternating with those of the
exposition.

h/cvr blurb:
In the fantasy universe of the phenomenally best-selling
Discworld series, everything runs on magic and common sense.
The world is flat and million-to-one chances happen nine
times out of ten. Our world seems different - it runs on
rules, often rather strange ones. Science is our way of
finding out what those rules are. The appeal of Discworld
is that it mostly makes sense, in a way that particle
physics doesn't.

_The Science of Discworld_ uses the magic of Discworld
to illuminate the scientific rules that govern _our_
world. When a wizardly experiment goes adrift, the wiz-
ards of Unseen University find themselves with a pocket
universe on their hands: Roundworld, where neither magic
nor common sense seems to stand a chance against logic.

Roundworld is, of course, our own universe. With us
inside it (eventually). Guided (if that's the word) by
the wizards, we follow the story from the primal sing-
ularity of the Big Bang to the Internet and beyond. We
discover how puny and insignificant lives are against a
cosmic backdrop of creation and disaster. Yet, paradox-
ically, we see how the richness of a universe based on
rules has led to a complex world and at least one spec-
ies that tried to get a grip on what was going on...

ISBN 0-09-188657-0 (ISBN given as 0-091-88657-0 on back cover)

New PPS to the introduction, The Story Starts Here:

"PPS Sometimes scientists change their minds. New Developments
cause a rethink. If this bothers you, consider how much damage
is being done to the world by people for whom new developments
do _not_ cause a rethink.

"This second edition has been changed to reflect three years
of scientific progress... forwards or backwards. (You will
find both.) And we've added two completely new chapters, one
on the life of dinosaurs, because the existing chapter on the
death of dinosaurs seemed a bit depressing, and one on cosmic
disasters, because in many ways the universe _is_ depressing.

"The Discworld story has proved more robust than the science.
As should be expected. Discworld makes so much more sense
than Roundworld does."
TP, IS &amp; JC, January 2002

(and hopefully corrects the odd slip in the earlier edition).

p/b blurb:
When a thaumic experiment goes adrift, the wizards of Unseen
University find that they've accidentally created a new uni-
verse. Within it is a planet that they name Roundworld, an
extraordinary place where neither magic nor common sense seems
to stand a chance against logic.

The universe, of course, is our own. And Roundworld is Earth.
As the wizards watch their accidental creation grow, we follow
the story of our universe from the primal singularity of the
Big Bang to the evolution of life on Earth and beyond.

This original Terry Pratchett story, interwoven with chapters
from Jack Cohen and Ian Stewart, offers a wonderful wizards-
eye view of our universe. Once you've seen the world from a
Discworld perspective, it will never seem the same again...
