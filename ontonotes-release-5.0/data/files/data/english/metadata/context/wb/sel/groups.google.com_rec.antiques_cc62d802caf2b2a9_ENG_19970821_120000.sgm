"/> I think you and the rest would do best to forget about ''Book Prices'' Anybody that has a
little working knowledge of this business is well aware that these 'Book Prices' are over
hyped and mean nothing in the real world. Any dealer that obtains his/her selling price
from some priceguide isn't worth the bothering with, you aren't going to be able to deal
with someone like that and generally such dealers lack knowledge and confidence in what
they are doing, therefore they are frightened to sell, incase they are underselling. Every
trade or business no matter what it is has its fair share of cowboys, the antiques trade
isn't any different, these ''book price'' dealers are the pain of this trade, real dealers
don't have much truck with these dipsticks, so don't see why you or the rest should,
you'll get burned if you do, unless you are one step ahead.

Iam always looking to buy a cheaply as possible .............. aren't you? So why should
a dealer be made to feel bad if he picks something up for a song, using his experience,
knowledge and hard earned cash. When someone (anyone) buys something from me I don't ask
them what they plan to do with it, and if I suspect someone buys from me to resell, I
don't refuse to sell to them, none of my business. In fact, if a fellow dealer buys from
me and sometime down the roads tells me he made 100% profit on it I don't care, the best
of luck, I've made my profit, if he makes money on EVERYTHING he buys from me then he
going to come back time and time again. No two objects are the same, so tell me how a
'priceguide' can reflect the GOING price, each object must stand upon its own merits, it's
all subjective.

Best to take all your 'priceguides' out to the back lawn, build a bonfire and burn them.
Then go down to your local bookshop or Public Library and get some real books on real
subjects and learn a bit about the chosen subject, do your own thing and stop worry what
the man in the antique shop is doing :-) ....... be a collector, (or pack your current job
and be a dealer) if what you buy turns out to be worth 'more' money then that's the bonus,
we are buying (or should be) objects that give pleasure, not dealing in currencies.

Go to any McCoy dealer and compare their prices with the book prices.
You will find most of them are the same. I beleive when a collectible
becomes HOT people (dealers and buyers) rely more upon value guides!&gt;&gt;

Go to any Roseville dealer and compare their prices with book prices.
You will find most of them price the items well above &quot;book&quot;. They price
them according to what the traffic will bear, and around here it seems to
bear a lot.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Unfortunately, your 'business' overlaps mine: Lionel and other 3-rail
&gt;trains. And in MY business, price guides are used EXTENSIVELY. That way,
&gt;sellers know they are getting the fair market price for their piece, and
&gt;buyers know they are paying fair market price.

&gt;At any of the train shows here in the US (GATS, TCA, LCCA, LOTS, local
&gt;shows) that feature Lionel/3-rail, you will see dealers pretty much
&gt;adhering to the price guides for selling. Why? Because the buying public
&gt;ALSO has access to what the fair market values are, and will not pay a
&gt;gouger. Additionally, auctions that have trains generally sell at fair
&gt;market for the same reason.

&gt;It only seems when an antique dealer manages to get ahold of a train do
&gt;their eyes light up with dollar signs, and then they price like it was
&gt;built by ol' Joshua Lionel Cowen himself (that is, if they even KNEW who
&gt;JLC was). Get a grip, folks. Most of what you have in your display cases
&gt;wouldn't rate 'Salvage' on TCA's grading list. Rusty Marx, Lionel
&gt;'Scout' locomotives with or without without tenders, train cars missing
&gt;wheels, mis-matched (mixed Lionel &amp; Marx) 'sets', trains that look like
&gt;they were repainted along with the jalopy in the driveway, ALL JUNK! And
&gt;the few (and I DO MEAN few) items that rate above 'good' condition get
&gt;priced like they are Mint-In-The-Box, or one-of-a-kind

&gt;The only ones who seem to be advoctating 'throw away your pricing
&gt;guides' are the ones who think what they have is somehow more valuable
&gt;than the tens of thousands of EXACT DUPLICATES that are out there. And
&gt;DON'T want you to know what it's REALLY worth.

"/> I think you make some good points. I don't disagree that priceguides are used
'EXTENSIVELY' of course they are, but unfortunately they are not always used correctly,
merely being used in many cases for a quick price check on something you have. It pains me
when some dealer offers me an item that he pick-up, doesn't know anything about it,
looks-up some guide, finds a simliar object and prices from that, and further insults me
by saying ''it's in the book.''

Example ...... I know ''nothing'' about your subject, it's a very special subject and
collecting hobby, so what do you suggest, do I look up a price guide? I've opened a
general price guide, the sort bought in any bookshop under ''antiques'' I have opened at
it the Model Rail section, prices of course make no sense to me, they could be high or low
or right, the examples illustrated, could be rare or run-of-the-mill or a lot of rubbish,
but if I read it correctly at least I can gauge (sorry) from where the author obtained the
prices in the first place and remembering of course, due to compiling and printing dates
etc the quoted prices can be up to a year behind. Checking the author's source key
revealed, all sources Sotheby's and Christie's. All the author has done here is lift
pre-sale estimates, from specialist catalogue sales, now what useful purpose does that
serve. It doesn't tell what the object 'really' made at the sale, or indeed if the object
sold at all, and at what price it failed, or how many times it had been entered.

You are correct when you say that most of what's out there is rubbish, not only your own
chosen items, but most other stuff as well. It has nothing to do with keeping value from
anyone, it's to with confusion and using such guides as a mere 'Pricelist.' I believe
people should look and study the merits of the object, without looking up the price guide
first. After are awhile, it doesn't matter much if it's made up or mass-produced 1920s
ones it ends up getting priced from the ''book'' Other thing to bear in mind with a
subject like yours and other special fields, there are a number of special price guides,
ones not normally bought by the general public and some of these may well indeed reflect a
truer picture. But the vast amount of priceguide publications are general and basic and
IMHO unrealible. For example my chosen special subjects on Irish Glass and Staffordshire,
I subscribe to all Sotheby's and Christie's specialist catalouge sales, the catalouge is
followed up with a results sheet, showing the 'real' hammer price and showing all unsold
lots, this for me, at least shows what *current* trends are, of course it doesn't tell me
who is paying the prices ......... ......... trade or private ....... but I've no doubt
the auctioneer leans a hand as well :-)

it antique dealer or &quot;civilian&quot;) tries quoting a price they saw in a
book for their piece (which, by the way, has the wrong tender, is
rusting, does not have the box, etc.), and refuses to back down. I
figure, they really must not want to sell it too badly. Maybe I'll just
wait until they go under and then buy it at the estate auction. :-)

"/> Agreed. I also looked at those &quot;everything&quot; books (mostly because I
wanted to see how far off-base they are. I was not disappointed; the
authors are clueless). I would almost suggest bringing in a train
collector as a consultant to help you accurately price your piece(s). I
realize this may be equated to heresy, but what is one of the rules of
business? REPEAT CUSTOMERS. If your consultant can tell you what you've
got and what it's worth, then you know you are not gouging the customer,
they know you're not out to gouge them and will be less likely to try to
get a price drop (because the price is not in the stratosphere), and
they will come back (and may bring friends also) periodically to see if
you've gotten more.

Example: At the shows that I regularly go to, I make it a point to visit
the folks I have bought from in the past to see how they are doing, what
new items they have that may catch my eye, and update them on an item I
would be in the market for, should they happen across it (I do the same
with the hobby shops in the vicinity). I give them repeat business
because they want to sell at a fair price and I want to buy at a fair
price.

"/> I would tend to think that someone getting in should START with the
price guides, and go to some auctions to learn how the auction prices
match to (or differ from) the price guides. Then they can start to build
trends for themselves. As an example, my wife and I were at an auction
in northern Wisconsin, USA, where one of the items was a Redwing crock.
We assumed it was a repro because it was WAY to shiny, and thought we'd
bid on it for a planter (no more than about $100). Boy, were we wrong.
It was the real thing, and it went for $1,595.00! From that, I learned
what the magazines devoted to toy trains have been advocating all along
applies to other branches of collecting: hook up with a knowledgable
collector to &quot;learn the ropes&quot; before diving in and either being
extremely frustrated, or broke with nothing valuable to show for it. I
would also like to suggest this to antique dealers who try to be &quot;jack
of all trades&quot; and end up being &quot;know-er of none.&quot; You will be more
respected if you know, REALLY KNOW, what you are selling, and are
willing to pass up on items that are either clearly junk, or that you
cannot claim knowledge about. Personally, I stay away from Prewar Lionel
because a) I really don't know a lot about it and really don't care to
get into it, and b) There are PLENTY of Prewar collectors out there who
DO that I could send someone to. Actually, I did that a while back, and
from what I heard, both buyer and seller were quite happy. It may end up
being a little less money in the short run, but in the long run you will
be able to populate your display cases with QUALTIY items for your
customers. Which, as I said before, will bring them back for more.
Regularly.

&gt; You've got me Michael, even with my 25+years experience in this trade, and over 30years
&gt; collecting ......... but really wish the hell I knew what you were talking about.

&gt; The whole antique trade doesn't revolve around ''McCoy'' or any other ''HOT'' collectible,
&gt; it's a little move involved than that. If you don't mind me saying, it would be a good
&gt; idea to take a wider look at the whole world of collecting and at the many fine objects
&gt; out there and not be sucked in by the bygones fads, but more important try and get a
&gt; handle on why we collect, in the first place. :-)

"/> You're sounding a bit smug to me! perhaps I'm not the expert you are,
Ronnie and I then have two options: ask a dealer and look it up in a

I do both and so do a lot of other people. Price Guides are just that-
GUIDES!
As for wasting my time and money on fads, you assume everything I
collect is fad-driven.
My partner and I have many collections in our home. Lots of
Staffordshire dogs and figures (hardly a fad, they've been popular for
years), hand vases (can't be a fad. No one even knows what a hand vase
is!), redware (not a fad), Victorian shell boxes (not a fad), Victorian
shadow boxes (not a fad and can be picked up really cheap...and we love
them!), Victorian furniture (just bought a 9 foot tall Eastlake Pier
mirror) etc etc.
I think I have a very good handle on why we collect. And as a collector
and NOT a dealer I think my opinion on price guides is valid.

Book Value means SQUAT!!!
The ONLY value an item has is what somebody is willing to pay you for it
Who cares what a price guide says when the only offer you get is 25% of
&quot;Book Value&quot;?

If you think auctions are bad, what about the auctioneers!

&lt;&lt;Remember, price guides don't just list values but also give information.
I rely upon them for both.&gt;&gt;

Good point. I have many price guides and often just pick them up for
educational reading, when I have no piece I am trying to price. I'd say
50% of my antique education has come from them and 50% from experience.
They are very valuable educational tools.

Oh come on Ronnie, what's wrong with someone saying they can gain some
knowledge from a price guide. Is everyone just supposed to innately
know everything? For example, a few months ago I was at a yard sale and
a gentleman had a pot lid for sale. He said it was 50 cents which I
gladly paid. In Shroeder's there is a section on pot lids. If I hadn't
looked through this guide when I first purchased it (meaning the price
guide not the pot lid) I would not have known what a pot lid is. I
would not have known that they &quot;appear&quot; to be valued in the hundreds of
dollars. And I would not have known that condition is not that
important where these are concerned (because, the American ones are rare
and most of them have been dug up after having been buried for some
time). Mine is damaged but I still have an auction estimate of
$400-$450 on it . Now, I probably would have bought it for 50 cents
anyway even if I had not read Shroeder's because it is old and &quot;cool&quot;
looking but if he would have said $50 I certainly would have passed.
But with that knowledge from the book I would have purchased it even for
$50. .........It irritates me too when someone quotes book prices as
though they are sent from above but to use them for education, I think
that is fine......By the way, what do you have against Superman?
Carol ..........Sorry this is so long - I lack the time to make it
shorter .......Ha,ha

"/> Hi Carol, first I'm not against a book that lists pictorial categories
on furniture and objects with an *honest* written appraisal on each
entry, but why is the importance placed most times on ''How Much Is It
Worth&quot; But books that don't include a 'priceguide' I don't suppose
sell that well and usually cost more to buy.

There are many factors that make sometimes worth what it's worth, the
problem is, many of the people that read these guides don't ponder or
wonder all that much and tend to use them as 'pricelists' - both
certain types of dealers and many members of the general public. In my
view that pushs up prices until many objects that were once buyable
become unbuyable because of overbuying and overpricing. It leds to
many dealers paying way overprice simply to get some stock.

Your very good Pot Lid example could be anything.

But someone new to this needs to be careful. Pot Lids prices for
example are by and large much of a muchness, it's the rare ones or the
desired ones that make the real money. An American Pot Lid in the UK
isn't worth that much, same go for an Irish one in England etc etc.
Same sort of thing applies to creampots, ginerbears, much other
printed pottery wares, as well as blue bottles, whiskey stoneware and
advertising collectibles. This is a whole field of collecting in its
own right and like many other collectibles. Even with a passing
knowledge gained solely from a 'Priceguide' book you may well then be
aware of Pot Lids and that some sell for high hundreds but a LOT sell
for the very low hundreds, and even lower, my advise to anyone with
that amount of knowledge would be to leave it alone even if 50bucks
looks good But if you didn't buy it at 50c why is it so wonderful and
a thing of beauty when you learn it's really worth 500dollars? If one
wants to really know about PotLids and all the related items read a
good reference book, talk to dealers and go to special antique
collectors fair the sort where you'll see hundreds of PotLids and
after awhile you pick it up ...... just like anything else really ;-)

Tell me Carol ;-) has America ALWAYS had antique 'Priceguides' did you
not have days before them?

Come on Ronnie, a good price guide lists more than prices, they give
historical background on the companies, include pictures for
identification, etc... one CAN learn a few things from even a crappy price
guide. : )

"/> OK, OK Jim :-) ............ I don't object to a book that provides

You know what I'm objecting too! .......... hey and this is about it,
I'm out of this thread, you'll be pleased to hear :-) I can say no
more on the subject ....... the ''pricelistings'' are misleading,
unreliable and play their part in pushing up overall prices, mainly in
the collectibles and fad markets, at least consider it :-)

"/> I stand corrected. Personally I don't do that. Don't want to look like a
bigger fool than I allready am. I find it scares a lot of people away if
the pre sale estimates are to high. Even though I don't normaly take
reserves I found that people were reluctant to bid on items with high
estimates figuring they couldn't buy it under the low estimate, which was
to high for them also, if you can understand what I'm trying to say. So
I'll stick to publishing what the items sold for after the fact. David

Sick crap -- like capitalizing on her death like you are?

Like the chicken and egg supply and demand are very real and it does not
matter which came first. When one is high and the other is low the price
will suck.
