I posted this on alt.autos.nissan, too (1987 Nissan Pulsar) but thought I
would do the same here as the Honda groups get more traffic and responses.
It's a pretty general question, also.

How do you remove the tie rods to get to the inner ends? The outer ends are
obvious, of course. Do you just 'unscrew' the tie rods until they come out?

Thanks,

I'll try to help, but it's pretty hard to explain. The car we did this
on was a 94 Accord EX.

We removed the boot covering the inner tie-rod and steering rack.
Basically there is a locking clip that is punched in that holds the
inner tie-rod in place. You have remove this clip, then you can loosen
the inner tie-rod. This would be much easier to do with the car on a
lift. On jack stands it was the most time consuming part of an almost
complete front end rebuild.

Install the new inner tie rod and punch the new locking clip. Make sure
you have new locking springs for the boot that goes over the steering
rack. You don't want any elements getting in the steering rack.

yes, but you need to do so from inside the boot.  extend the rod as far
as possible for the side you're going to do, pull back the boot, and the
inner end connector should be visible.  should be easy to figure out how
it comes off from there.  tip: try not to unscrew solely against the
rotation resistance of the rack rod - hopefully, yours has some flats on
it which can be held with a wrench.  if the rod end is stiff to unscrew
and the rod is unsupported, you're forcing it against the pinion gear,
which while it should be ok, nevertheless runs the theoretical risk of
some damage.
