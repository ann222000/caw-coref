"/> We went by their sale a few years ago when they came through our area.
The things they were selling were cheaply made, so we didn't buy a
thing. Those people that bought that crap should have been able to tell
just by looking at the stuff that it wasn't well made.

them is excellent &amp;, according to one of the rental places here, the same
quality as what they rent. On the other hand, there's some stuff there I
don't think would survive being transported home or being powered up. &lt;g&gt;

They were in our area a month or two back. We didn't see a flyer, but I
happened to see their sign at the entrance to the place where they had
set up their tent.

I walked around but was not impressed with what I saw and left without
buying a thing.

I saw the ad and went to the sale.

I also saw a lot of junk, but I did buy some stuff. I got a heavy duty set
of jumper cables for my son, a hitch hauler for an employee and a 12 volt
booster pack with a air pump.

You really have to shop these places, not take everything for granted that
it's going to be perfect.

&gt; I made the mistake of purchasing some of their junk tools, about a

&gt; after one or a few uses. I also bought a power tool, and when I got
&gt; home, I found this tool was damaged (in the box) beyond being usable.
&gt; After nearly one year of trying to get assistance from them, I finally
&gt; contacted the Better Business Bureau. They actually DID contact me
&gt; after that. However, that was all they did, because they did not

&gt; DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH THEM !!!
&gt; You will NOT be satisfied, and you will be throwing your money away.

"/> i went to one of their sales.. and found out that there stuff was just
junk from looking at it.... even comparing it to harbor freight you
could tell that it was not as good as their junk tools.. but at least in
my area harbor freight has a retail store and i have brought things back
to them and no problem....

Of course, they will be out of town by then, and they would be immune
to attempts to sue them because the game would not be worth the

"/> Is the tent on the dealer's premises?

(The rule is normally applied to door-to-door and in-home sales, but
it sometimes flexes to cover merchants doing business away from their
regular location. Auto dealers have their own special rules.)

All you say maybe true as can be but I do go to their sells for small cheap
items that they sell cheap and very seldom have trouble with them. here is the
items : Electric tap 4 rolls for a $1.00 , Hack saw blades 10 for a $1.00, 25
ft. measuring tapes $.99 , Cheap truck Dollie $14.99 , 4.5 inch grinder wheels
$.99 each, 10 pound sledge hammer 3 ft. handle $3.95, and 4.5 inch hand angle
electric grinder $5.95 . I don't use the gringers much but at $5.95 each who
cares if you burn one up every 6 months or a year. I bought 5 of them 2 years
ago and I still got 3 I have not opened to use and use them about 5 to 10 times
a year. I don't expect much from junk and that is what they are but they fill a
need that away.

The other stuff is junk but if you want good stuff buy a name brand locally.

Amen to what TURTLE said- use your eyes and your common sense. If a tool
looks and feels like junk, it probably is junk. For some applications, that
doesn't matter. For stuff that can kill you, it does matter. For example, I
would never buy jack stands at a traveling tool sale, but I might buy the
cheap floor jack there. I would need the floor jack maybe 3 times a year, so
as long as the seals didn't go, it would last forever. And if it fails, no
big deal- the car drops back down. Now if the jack stands fail while I am
under there, that is (to me, at least) a very big deal.

They have the best price around on mini-lathes and mill-drills.
Those are pretty much a known commodity, with plenty of online support from
individuals and 3rd parties.
I'll be spending about $900 next time one is in my area.
